3093031,3,B0012Q3SZ0,"The show itself, as originally produced by the talent involved 50+ years ago, is a great show. But for Shout Factory to rely on butchered ""syndication"" and rerun prints (22-mins) instead of the original 26-min prime-time network run is unforgiveable! At least they didn't do what Infinity/Roxbury did with another Columbia/Screen Gems classic (Route 66) and butcher off the tops/bottoms of all frames of all episodes to force a PHONY ""widescreen"" 16x9 aspect-ratio picture! (I hope I just didn't give SF or anyone else any ideas of butchering 4x3 pictures to force phony 16x9 widescreen!)

And prior to the 1963/64 TV season, Screen Gems (Columbia Pictures) had their closing Columbia Torch-Lady Statue logo actually integrated into the end of the closing credits/theme-song.

(With 1963/64, SG started using a seperate logo/jingle after the closing theme/credits had just finished, the animated ""sticks & dots"" visual with ""J-E-L-L-O-like"" fanfare jingle; with 1965/66 and for many seasons following, the animated 'S' visual with electronic Eric-Siday-composed jingle; the torchglow sunrise animated logo with new electronic music with 1976/77; and so forth; Sony has usually REMVOVED these 1960s/70s/80s standalone SG/Columbia logos of the original era and replaced them with the current Sony logo, unfortunately).

But the pre-1963/64 Columbia Pictures Torch Lady Statue logo (and there were two versions -- the 1955-60 and the 1960-63) were integrated into the closing theme song at the very end. You see it not only in FKB, but in Donna, Dennis, Route 66, Naked City, Hazel, and other 1950s/60s SG TV shows, if the show isn't edited. And in FKB's first season, SG used a different closing logo but also integrated into the end of the closing theme, the ""TV Screen"" logo.

For the most part the Shout Factory DVD 1st season set has these ""TV screen"" logos LOPPED OFF. The music of the closing theme song just ""stops"" without the proper ending, since the integrated closing logo was cut-off.

At least the ORIGINAL ""Promised Playhouse"" (which was 26-mins) has that ""TV Screen"" logo on the closing theme. The ""flashback"" version of ""Promised Playhouse"" (rerun-butchered to 22-mins) from a later season has the Columbia Torch Lady Statue logo included. And the ""special"" episode ""24-Hours in Tyrant Land"" has its closing theme with Columbia Torch Lady logo intact in the closing theme as well.

Didn't the Robert Young estate or Sony (formerly Screen Gems/Columbia Pictures) have the COMPLETE unedited prints in their libraries?

3093032,3,B0012Q3SZ0,"Lots of the syndicated (TVLand) versions here. So, if you focus on the great menus that Shout Factory created instead, you'll be much happier. Too bad, I used to think of Shout Factory as being a high quality operation. I guess I was wrong.

The show itself is good and worth purchasing if the price drops to reflect the syndicated shows. Especially with these great menus (they really are better than you can make on your own computer). That would be between $10 and $12.

It looks, to me, as though Shout Factory recorded most of these from TVLand and then cut out the commercials. There are many such versions widely available on the Internet and you can get the whole series almost for the price of this set, but the menus won't be nearly as good as what Shout Factory gives you. Since Shout Factory doesn't want to do better than this, you might as well buy the other versions. You really aren't getting your moneys' worth with this set.

Shout Factory just doesn't want to be bothered anymore with the little details - like providing full uncut shows. But they are really good with those menus!",1207267200,14,1100,4.545454545454546
3093033,3,B0012Q3SZ0,"Despite the fact that  almost half of the episodes are 22 minute cut prints, this set remains the only way of getting the series.  At least one bootlegged copy of the complete series is available but has numerous problems that render it worthless.  It is up to Shout.  I recommend that everyone implores Shout to release the complete series ASAP and restores as many uncut episodes as possible.  Maybe after that...

3093034,1,B0012Q3SZ0,"Father Knows Best was a wonderful television program.  A review of the show would get 5 stars.  These reviews are not supposed to be testimonials or nostalgic trips back to one's childhood; they should be reviews of the product.  That is the reason I am awarding this product a single star.  There is no excuse whatsoever for a company to give the buying public edited versions of tv shows that have been in existence for so many years.  I wrongfully assumed that since the Young family trust gave its blessing to this project that the dvd set would be top notch and first class.  Shout Factory could not even present episode number one in its original form.  The first show was barely 22 minutes with complete opening sequence and closing credits.  The editing to trim the show by the three minutes was done with a hatchet that a child of four could notice.  I suppose this is better than no Father Knows Best at all, but not by much. My advice is to check the manufacturer of dvd's and make sure that Shout Factory had nothing to do with it.  Otherwise, you will receive less than you hoped for and less than you paid for.",1207180800,150,1124,4.439024390243903
3093035,5,B0012Q3SZ0,"The 203 half-hour episodes of the situation comedy ""Father Knows Best"" were originally broadcast on CBS & NBC from 1954 to 1960. This DVD set includes the 26 episodes from the 1954-55 broadcast season. The set also includes several special features detailed on Amazon's item description.

The series itself was a well-written ""suburban"" version of ""Make Room For Daddy"" (which had premiered a year earlier on ABC) with Robert Young playing the Danny Thomas part.  The title character Jim Anderson (Young) is an agent with the General Insurance Company. He lives with his family on South Maple Street in Springfield (a town in an undisclosed Midwestern state).  Jim's character is to a large degree the featured player on the series.  Young had done ""Father Knows Best"" for five seasons on radio and was the only cast member retained for the television production.

Jane Wyatt (not to be confused with Jane Wyman) plays his wife Margaret, a simple 1950's homemaker. Former child star Elinor Donahue plays his oldest daughter Betty, Jim calls her ""Princess"". Billy Gray plays teenage son James Jr., called ""Bud"" by everyone in the series. Lauren Chapin plays younger daughter Kathy; called ""Kitten"" by her father. During Season One Betty is 17, Bud is 14, and Kathy is nine.

The Anderson's live in a nice ""Leave In to Beaver"" ""Brady Bunch"" type home and neighborhood. Although nothing really bad ever happens in Springfield (at least until ""The Simpsons"") the series was considerably less bland than your standard suburban sitcom and did not fall back on guest stars playing an assortment of silly characters.

Jim is not a raving nutcase (insert Danny Thomas here) and Margaret is not an airhead (insert Lucy here). Neither parent outshines the other in the wisdom or competence departments. Like Beaver and Opie the kids get into their fair share of trouble and have misunderstandings with their parents. Jim and Margaret know enough to get out of the way of their children and let them learn from their own mistakes.

Along with Young, Donahue and Gray are the strength of the series. The inexperienced Chapin was in over her head and I always wished that they could have swapped her for Angela Cartwright (or her sister Veronica), who could have passed physically for Donahue's sister.  But Chaplin did her best.  All three children have frequent moments of anger and self-centeredness. Betty is often realistically uptight, and it is likely Shelley Fabares used her as a model when she started playing teenage daughter Mary on ""The Donna Reed Show"" in 1958.  Donahue's character a few years later on ""The Andy Griffith Show"" was much softer and more relaxed.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1205798400,5,2709,4.955849889624724
3093036,5,B0012Q3SZ0,"Well, I have to agree with those who have already written.  I loved this series because they were everything my family wasn't. I'm thrilled to see this coming out for home ownership!  This series gave me hope for what could be in a family.  I wasn't so idealistic that I thought everything about them was real, but as a young kid I sure thought maybe we could have some of the dynamics I saw on the series.  Congratulations to everyone who starts collecting this series.  It just might put some seriously renewed hopefulness for the state of the family back into America.  Lord knows we need to take some lessons!",1204848000,6,613,4.527272727272727
3093037,5,B0012Q3SZ0,"This show was ""before my time"". I saw it in the early 70's when it was syndicated. I loved it then and still love it. It was very well written and was much more true to life than the ""Leave it to Beaver's"" and the ""Ozzie and Harriet's"" of that day. This show dealt with real family issues intelligently. The title ""dates"" it unfortunately, but the stories themselves are not dated at all. It had an outstanding cast with really good chemistry. Thanks Shout Factory for bringing back this true classic!",1203984000,12,501,4.516483516483516
3093038,5,B0012Q3SZ0,this is my very favorite old tv show.  It has really good morals and the family is kind to each other.  it is truly refreshing to watch and enjoy.  I cannot tell you how thrilled I am that it is being released as I could not find it anywhere and it is not on television anymore...thanks so much,1201910400,23,294,4.0344827586206895
3093039,5,B0012Q3SZ0,"I grew up in a very difficult, unconventional family during the 1950s that was anything but conservative. Nothing about it resembled the ""average, American middle-class"" family - the Anderson's - depicted so flawlessly on Father Knows Best. My family didn't look like the Anderson's, they didn't sound like the Anderson's, and they certainly didn't act like the Anderson's.

Nonetheless, I loved everything about that TV family just because it was so completely foreign to my life. I was totally, hopelessly captivated by their perfectly rosy lives. It wasn't that I wanted the Anderson's to be my family, I just loved visiting them each week, sort of like going to another planet without needing a space ship.

I grew up to be a liberal feminist, so nothing about my adult life now resembles the Anderson's in the least, even now. But, I STILL love them! I love the warmth, the messages, and even the strong patriarchal structure. In fact, that is exactly what distinguishes Father Knows Best from the other 50s all-white family shows, like Leave It To Beaver and the Donna Reed Show. Those other shows focus on the children, but it was the Dad that was paramount in this show - how he responded to his family and how they responded to him. So, major kudos to Shout! Factory for this wonderful release.

Father Knows Best was first a radio series on NBC Radio in 1949 before finally moving to CBS TV after more than four years. A Screen Gems production, the series aired from October 3, 1954 to May 23, 1960 for a total of 203 episodes. The series ended while it was still number 6 in the ratings. (Young left the series in 1960 at the height of the show's popularity, but reruns continued to air in prime time for another three years, on CBS from 1960-1962, and on ABC from 1962-1963. Following this, reruns were shown on ABC-TV in the early afternoon for several years.)

The Anderson family of Springfield, Mo., includes hardworking General Insurance agent Jim (Young), his levelheaded and lovely wife, Margaret (Jane Wyatt - who later became a cultural icon when she portrayed Spock's mother, Amanda, on Star Trek), and their kids, sophisticated teen Betty ""Princess"" (Elinor Donahue), befuddled James ""Bud"" Jr. (Billy Gray) and precocious Kathy ""Kitty"" (Laurin Chapin). Both Jim and Margaret where portrayed as responsible, caring parents, with Jim usually guiding the family (especially the children) through everyday problems and Margaret supporting them. Jim and Margaret always treated their children's youthful transgressions with authority, empathy and wisdom.

This first-ever DVD release of the series was endorsed and produced in tandem with the heirs of Robert Young and producer Eugene B. Rodney, co-proprietors of the TV series.

Father Knows Best: Season One DVD box set features all 26 classic episodes on four discs plus the never-before-seen episode 24 Hours in Tyrantland, which was created for the U.S. government in 1959, new cast interviews of the ""kids,"" Young's Home Movies, rare ""behind-the-scenes"" color footage, and the pilot episode of Young's TV series Window On Main Street.

Season One Episodes (1954-1955) are: Bud Takes Up The Dance; Lesson In Citizenship; Motor Scooters; Football Tickets; Live My Own Life; Grandpa Jim's Rejuvenation; Bud's Encounter With The Law; Thanksgiving Day; Second Honeymoon; Typical Father; Margaret Goes Dancing; The Christmas Story; Sparrow At The Window; Boy's Week; A Friend of Old George's; Bud the Snob; The Promised Playhouse (Apparently, this episode was not intact in the archives, but was loaned for inclusion here by a private collector in Dallas who had a 16mm copy!); Jim The Farmer; Father of The Year; The Mink Coat; The Matchmaker; Bud the Bridesmaid; Proud Father; Father Delivers The Papers; No Partiality; and  Close Decision.

DVD Special: 24 Hours In Tyrantland, the never-before-seen episode created especially for the U.S. government. In 1959 the U.S. Department of the Treasury paid to have a special episode produced. It was never broadcast, but was shown in schools, churches and civic groups for the purpose of selling U.S. Savings Bonds. When Betty, Bud and Kathy don't want to help sell U.S. Bonds, Jim teaches them a lesson by making them spend a day living under a tyrannical dictator - him!

I know, I know, Mrs. Anderson always dressed to the nines and NEVER worked out of the house, she and her husband slept in twin beds, their eldest daughter was nicknamed ""Princess"" and everything that was already perfect in their whiter-that-white world ended up even more perfect by the end of each episode. But, there was real love in the Anderson house. I know there was because my little-kid-self felt it. So, it may not be politically correct, but I rejoice in this show's release and look forward with eager anticipation to pulling my chair up to the Anderson's table for a very long-overdue home-cooked dinner.

Let's hope additional Season Sets on DVD of this TV Classic are forthcoming.",1200614400,154,4983,5.035194174757281

I have streamed many of the seasons of Father Knows Best when streaming became available, and now I'm deciding to add a few DVD's of their shows to my collection of 60's sitcom.  I learned some interesting facts off the special features section with Elinor Donahue actress and she tells her story of marrying young in life, and having a baby.  Thus she disappeared from Father Knows Best and when they decided to bring back the Betty character she told them that she had cut off her hair and had it real short. Thus the shortened hair look when she came back from the show.

Robert Young and Jane Wyatt play husband and wife ""Jim Anderson"" and ""Margaret Anderson"" who have 3 children daughter ""Betty Anderson"" played by Elinor Donahue and son ""James Bud Anderson Jr"" played by Billy Gray and daughter ""Kathy Anderson"" played by Lauren Chapin who live in Springfield. One of the best episodes is the episode where Margaret doesn't want son Bud having a motor scooter because she is worried he will not be responsible though there is a wonderful scene where he shows her how he is responsible and shows he has the safety rules book and he is following the safety rules and will be safe.",1427760000,,644,4.707964601769912

I was SHOCKED at the horrible CHOPPING!! (notice I didn't say ""editing"" because there was nothing that looked like editing....it looked like someone accidentally chopped the film during a scene!)  I am appalled that a company that sells DVDs can produce something this horrible.  If you can stomach watching a scene when it abruptly cuts out to black, then buy this set.  In between the ""black outs"" my family really enjoyed the show.  I agree with another reviewer:  Shame on Shout!",1417996800,8,676,4.7844827586206895

My problem was that most of these episodes paused and started and paused and started continually but it was worse on like the last five or six episodes of the set!!! A lot of times it would pause for at least a minute or two so it would take over an hour to watch an entire episode!!!! I bought mine from an Amazon third party seller named ""Greatstuffatlowprices"" which should be called ""Defectivestuffatlowprices""!!!! Still this is a one of the best old family sitcoms that even if you're not familiar with this series, you should like it.

It's a Family t.v serie fir to all. And the censors decided it's fit to al ages. So, you won't get disappointed. good acting, good stories. I recommend the serie!",1409356800,,602,4.128205128205129

A happy family lives in a pretty house, love abounds, and every upset is cured within 30 minutes. This may sound like a formula for a failed TV show, but for me and many other people born in the 50s, it's a slice of heaven. The clothes and cars are fun to see, the manners are sorely missed, and the positive feelings put me in a good mood. That's more than I can say for most of today's television programs. True, it made all of us wish we had homes like the Anderson family and might have made us feel like failures for not being more like them.

3093294,5,B0012Q3SZ0,"Fantastic show which is different from all other 1950s shows of its same time period.  Unlike Leave it to Beaver, it truly shows the give and take between siblings in a normal family and reminds us that kids have always been kind of squirrelly and unkind to each other!  lol  Great morals and shows the importance of a mom and dad who are willing to apologize to their kids when they are wrong and let their children have opinions of their own, while still being strong leaders who aren't doormats for their sons and daughters.  Great show!",1387065600,,540,4.536082474226804
3093295,5,B0012Q3SZ0,"I just got a new (Amazon) Kindle HDX 8.9 -- just yesterday.

Today a friend needed a driver for a visit to Mayo Clinic.
I sat in the waiting room for 2+ hours.
With earbuds I watched several episodes of Father Knows Best.
Two hours went by easily. The video and the sound are exceptional.
(I also downloaded and watched Dick Van Dyck shows with the Wi-Fi at Mayo. Fast. No streaming needed. Incredible.)

I have had almost every Kindle since the first Fire. My current Kindle HDX 8.9 is almost unbelievable:
1.) On the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9"" Episodes do not need to be streamed -- once downloaded, each episode plays without interruption;
2.) The Internet is incredibly fast;
3.) The clarity of the video and the Dolby sound are incredible.

You might surmise -- and you would be correct -- that this review is oriented more toward the new Kindle HDX than it is for the Father Knows Best Videos.

Conclusion:
1.) The Amazon Prime account that includes ""free"" (free after the yearly $79) videos is incredible;
2.) The quality of this Father Knows Best video is amazing -- as is the sound;
3.) New on my Kindle HDX -- I get closed captioning.

Five stars for the ""free"" Prime videos.
Then five stars for the new Kindle HDX.",1386892800,,1219,4.497737556561086

My only regrets are this show didn't go on for a few more seasons and that seasons 5 & 6 have some repeat episodes  such as ""Betty's Graduation,  Father The Naturalist, First Dillusionment etc. ""  I highly recommend this show for anyone looking for a quality family program that may have been over-looked due to time ( over 50 yrs old tv )",1331942400,2,655,4.371900826446281

It's still full of everyday antics that 3 children can come up with, and believe me these 3 are full of them.  The best thing is there's Betty who's a teenager, Bud who's almost a teenager and Little Kathy who's in grade school, there something for just about any age on this show and it's just a clean, fun show with wonderful actors who seem to really love what they are doing, you'd never know they weren't a real family.  Sure it's a little like Leave it to Beaver, but do they get any better???  The mother is Jane Wyatt, she's absolutely beautiful, and so smart and funny.  You'll be happy your purchased this one, we love it.  There's only one small thing we didn't like, the Father smokes sometimes, not very often, but it does have an ad for cigarettes at the beginning of one of the shows and when that show comes on, he's lighting one up.  I don't smoke, and don't want to encourage my child to smoke, so that disturbs me some, but I do realize that was a different era.  Buy this one, you'll love it, and your kids will long for those days or be happy for what they have in this day, either way it's a positive show about positive, good, things for the most part. No bad language, no fighting, no guns, just good old fun. Hope you enjoy!!!  Got mine from Amazon, they are the best!!! Thanks Amazon for having such a wide variety of Clean, Family Shows!!

3093352,4,B0012Q3SZ0,"As several reviewers have pointed out, SHOUT did a lousy job on the first year's episodes of FKB.  The video quality is nothing to brag about, nor is the audio.  You can easily see where certain episodes have been cut.  Shame on SHOUT.

But on the other hand, I don't know all the details of why.  Did the full episodes still exist?  After all, only a few of Roy Rogers old films exist in their entirety...many only exist as the cut versions to fit in an hour of television time (with commercials).  Many of the Hollywood Squares episodes are completely gone.  There are stories that virtually all of Perry Como's variety series programs (at one time the hottest program on television) were trashed.  I'd love to know the truth about FKB.

But, when I was growing up, FKB was considered the best situation comedy on television in our house.  Then, a few months ago, I decided to buy season 3 because of a couple of particular episodes, and after that, season 4.  What a polished show FKB had become, and there is little doubt in my mind that the ""kids"" here were probably the best child actors on television.  I began to realize that FKB wasn't really so much of a situation comedy, but portrayals of ideal family life (at least for the 1950s), with a great deal of humor added in.  So after watching seasons 3 and 4, it was interesting to later go back and watch season 1.  That pilot/first episode -- truly just a situation comedy; Bud and Kathy not smooth at all; and worst of all -- Jim Anderson smoking up a storm!  Then, episode 2 was already an improvement...still essentially a situation comedy, but this time with a moral message, too.  And that's how this show developed.  Thank goodness it survived low ratings that first year through the efforts of its fans!

Yes, disappointing quality for video and audio, but rewarding none the less.  But I really would suggest watching some later seasons first, then going back to the beginning.",1301356800,,1945,4.582608695652174

The introduction of the Anderson Family, one of the most beloved in television history is well represented in all of the episodes presented in this volume.  The DVD quality is excellent, I found no problems with audio or video in this set.  It is interesting to view the American home in 1954, with Margaret Anderson, typical housewife, in pearls, dresses and high heels (a la June Cleaver) doing housework!  In all truth, however, most housewives did not wear pants, my mom didn't, they were not as prevalent as today.
Regardless, all of these marvelous episodes, even in a ""genesis"" stage of an evolving sitcom, transmit such warmth, humor and humanity, a precursor to even better writing and situations in the next seasons, as the show ""grew"" into its legend status.

3093359,2,B0012Q3SZ0,"Sadly I must add to the complaints about SHOUT using the old, poorly transfered, 1980's filmchain transfers that Columbia Pictures Television made for syndicating the shows. Columbia hacked off 4 minutes as well as the original Screen Gems logo at the end.

Then the old reel-to-reel 1"" video tapes were copied & sent over to SFM who was going to synduicate the shows for FREE to TV stations in exchange for commercial time (called barter in the industry).  Now SFM replaced the Columbia Television logo with their tacky computer graphic SFM logo, replacing the original music as well.

Now that Sony owns Columbia Pictures, they retrieved the old edited 1"" reel-to-reel video tapes from SFM & converted them over to more modern Beta SP cartridge tape, complete with all of the 20 year old video tape glitches.  Now they tagger their new Sony Television logo to the end, often after the SFM logo.

With the copyright owners not interested in releasing this show to home video, SHOUT Factory contracted the rights to do so.  Unfortunetaly SHOUT does not own the show & releases only what they are given & Sony gave them the 3rd generation dubs of the 20+ year old video tape film transfers.  SHOUT also removed all evidence of the previous TV syndicators logos (abruptly cutting the end credits) in hopes that we would not notice they are the cut syndication versions.

Based on the very good bonus material in this DVD, some effort was put into this release. But nobody wanted to invest the money to re-master the original fim negatives for this release, or the posterity of preserving the show.

It would have been nice if Sony had accessed Columbia's oroginal transfers before the edits were made, but it is possible they were erased.",1262217600,5,1736,4.798657718120805

3093363,5,B0012Q3SZ0,"""Father Knows Best"" debuted in 1954 and has been captivating audiences for more than fifty years. The reason is simple:  Even though we all didn't have the perfect lives of the Anderson's, we still wanted to.  It was what we (down deep) really wanted.  Nobody can have a 'TV life"" and yet, we are drawn back to those halcyon times when life was simpler and richer.

I had the pleasure of growing up around the reruns of ""Father Knows Best"" and other shows like it and I gotta tell you, there is little today that can match it.  Why?  Have we become so sophisticated that we can't appreciate the simple things?  Do we have to have ""deep"" plots, or explosions, or morbid drama, or gut-wrenching social commentary?  There is a place for those things.  But there is also a place for this show.

You might know actor Robert Young from the many other roles he had not only in television but in film as well.  He went on after this series to play the distinguished and compassionate ""Marcus Welby, M.D"" from 1969 to 1974.  He was, in my opinion, one of the finest actors ever to step in front of the camera. (And one of the classiest too.)

""Father Knows Best"" takes place in Springfield, Ohio.  Robert Young's character Jim Anderson plays an easy-going, kindly insurance salesman with an abundance of patience and wisdom given to his children who always end up needing Dad's advice, or learning an important lesson from him.
Jane Wyatt plays his wife, Margaret with class, style and beauty.

To me, ""Father Knows Best"" is the gold standard for this type and genre of entertainment.  It was a TV show I could relate to.  Not that I had the ""ideal"" childhood.  But it was good and shows like these added to it.

This is a DVd set you will want to go back to many times.  The episodes are uncut for commercials so you get the full 30 minutes.  The quality is excellent and like the potato chips, once you watch one, you will have to have more.  But if 1950's television is not your thing you will probably want to pass this up.

Sometimes when I think about it, I sort of wish that with all our modern-day, real-life dramas, there was a Springfield, Ohio of the type on this show to get away to for a while.  But then, I pop one of these DVD's in the player and I'm taken away to a place I love to be.",1238198400,3,2292,4.338823529411765
3093364,5,B0012Q3SZ0,"A fun look back to the ""good old days"" of American television.  The Andersons were the family that everyone wanted to be a part of, and we were (if only one night a week)!  I was delighted to see this series come to DVD - a real treasure!

3093365,5,B0012Q3SZ0,"It's great that this set is out--the quality is great.  BUT it should only get 4 and 1/2 starts because there are few extras and it really needs some commentary tracks.  They could have gotten any of the remaining alive cast members to comment or had academics discuss the social aspects of the series.  It's amazing to see the father so often portrayed as the bad guy, the kids as very rebellious and the mom the hero.  It's very unlike what most media people claim about the show.  But there needs to be a discussion about some of the surprising scenes in this first season.",1230163200,,576,4.447619047619048

3093367,5,B0012Q3SZ0,"I used to watch this every morning & again late afternoons during the mid 1980s on The CBN Cable Network which was a channel that once showcased the finest vintage sitcoms ever.

I watched Bachelor Father, Dobie Gillis & Father Knows Best everyday & had my video machine going to put 'em all on tape.  As a result I've got loads of Father Knows Best episodes & have even transferred some to DVD as the show hadn't been yet made available on DVD, so my homemade DVDs were something to tide me over anyway.

I'm very pleased to see the series finally get the DVD treatment.  I, like some of the others am displeased & think it unfortunate that some of these are syndicated prints.  However, as this is a true rarity & has been scarce in rerun markets over the years, I'll gladly take the first & second season & every & any additional seasons that become available in the future. Episodes of Father Knows Best in any DVD offering, syndicated and/or otherwise is better than not having it in any form at all.  Sure, I'd love having the completely unedited prints same as many others who have griped about this, but if the syndicated are the majority of prints available in this set, then so be it.  They will due until some distributor makes the unedited ones available. For the time being, I'm satisfied.

Some of my favorite episodes were the one where Kathy played a sleuth to unravel a mystery, the one where Kathy is a real tomboy & in the closing scene she makes a grand entrance to her date in a lovely dress.  The one where Kathy takes a friend's baby sister & wants to be her mother which had been in one of the earlier shows.

Betty awaiting word on her boyfriend, the jet pilot, Betty being a snob to Bud around her friends, the christmas show which featured Wallace Ford as Santy.  Great, great episodes. These plots had morals & The Andersons are a staple of 1950s middle class wholesome americana.

I also LOVED Father Knows Best: Home For Christmas, one of the two reunion movies of 1977 (hadn't seen the previous one, Father Knows Best Reunion).

I thought Billy Gray (Bud) was so cute & endearing as he had gotten into his upper teens!

Elinor Donahue (Betty) was so down-to-earth & upbeat & had some of the most comical one-liners in some of the earlier episodes where she'd make a sharp-witted remark about Bud to Father!  She also had a warm & bright smile that was remarkable.

Lauren Chapin (Kathy) was everyone's favorite half-pint tomboyish kid sister who at times felt neglected & was always there with a shoulder.  I bought Lauren Chapin's Father Does Know Best autobiography back when it was first released & am proud to have it in my library of favorite publications/memorabilia.  I empathize with all she's overcome & the  inner strength & determination that got her through it in the long run.  We LOVE you, Lauren!

Jim & Margaret were there with words of wisdom & instilled values in their children which is timeless & makes this show appropriate for kids of all ages.  It's also clean & inoffensive & makes the grade as a classic worth having in your DVD library of really good 1950s family sitcoms.  I'm an avid fan of the vintage radio series as well!",1226275200,7,3183,4.526223776223776

3093371,3,B0012Q3SZ0,"I think we need to get past certain things; well, at least I do. I need to not get so cranky that these are the poorly edited syndication versions (and not the pristine looking, uncut episodes like we got from I Love Lucy and The Twilight Zone dvd collections).
I've gotten totally spoiled by some dvd releases of television programs, and it's really not realistic to expect all retro series to be that great. Right?

So, the quality here is like watching vhs tapes recorded off cable. Better than not having the show at all, some would say. It's just annoying when Jane Wyatt opens her mouth to say something and the scene suddenly fades to black, then we cut to the same scene moments later. It's disorienting. Someone did a lousy job of editing these programs for commercials. Certain segments are removed, and often we are brought into the action after some dialogue has already been established. Trimming has been done at the beginning of scenes, and before the end of scenes. It's a lowdown shame that the scissors have been taken to these programs so much to make room for more ads.

Plus, the very end of the closing credits has been chopped off (could be a trademark issue that Shout Factory couldn't legally show). But that's no big deal, it's just jarring to have the music stop out of the blue.

Father Knows Best is a fun show that many folks grew up with. It is a hoot to revisit the Andersons and witness the values, the fashions, the slang, the old furnishings. Certainly it has dated, but somehow that adds to the charm.
So, my rating is a mix between my feelings for the program itself and also my opinion of the dvd quality.

I feel glad that the show is coming to dvd but also gypped that the result is only fair at best.",1222992000,3,1741,4.448275862068965

3093373,5,B0012Q3SZ0,"This ""Father Knows Best"" Season 1 set is wonderful, especially for those of us who grew up with the Andersons and/or yearn for good, clean and decent TV. My family was not perfect (whose is?), but the idealized family of Jim and Margaret ""inspired"" me to realize that--perhaps--all of us could put forth a little more effort to BE like them. I was taught values in my church, at school and at home; and ""Father Knows Best"" reinforced those timeless values of problem-solving in a family, improving relationships, kindness, forgiveness, hard work, moral purity, etc. It also showed me values that I wish MY family had had and made me strive to be like the Andersons when I grew up. Well, I HAVE grown up (years ago), and I am pleased to say that ""Father Knows Best,"" ""The Donna Reed Show,"" ""Leave It to Beaver,"" ""Ozzie and Harriett"" and many more shows are a (good) part of who I am. I am sure that millions of my generation would agree with this, and I heartily recommend this set (and future ones) to people of all ages, alive in the '50's or not.

This was made in the early fifties, and the quality considering is exceptional and it has held up well.  I did see one instance where it kind of ended abruptly, but it did not hurt the scene or ruin your viewing. There was a complaint that it was not the original minutes.

I watched some of the first disc and I can tell you this, the episodes look better than they looked on TV in many years! The sound....well it's not all that great, but this show is quite old and it's not all 'that bad'. As for edited episodes, I can't remember the episodes that well to remember, but I haven't noticed anything missing so far. Although the fade out breaks seemed slightly rushed.

The editing of these episodes is obvious to even a casual observer, with dialogue and scenes simply fading out. To add insult to injury, even the closing credits are edited.

3093385,5,B0012Q3SZ0,"I have not seen this show in 30 years and I amazed how well the it holds up in the 21st century. The first season aired in 1954 and 1955 and it was based on the popular radio show that was broadcast from 1949 through 1953. Although the Anderson's do not look like any family you would see today, they do portray what every family wishes it could be. The Andersons represent a solid family where ever member is valued, and character and integrity are expected by all. The parents, Jim and Margret, work together to confront the difficulties of raising three children. Margaret looks to Jim as the head of the household. Jim does not abuse his position as the ""man of the house"" and constantly treats his wife Margret with the utmost respect and love. Therefore, Jim feels respected and Margaret feels loved and together they make a perfect team.

Bud, the second child, is the one who seems to always find trouble which sets the stage for endless hours of entertainment. Betty, the oldest, is very level-headed and responsible but as a teenage girl, she does encounter her share of problems. Finally there is Kathy, the little sister, who keeps the pot stirring by always making the inappropriate comment or lets the cat out of the bag by purposely repeating what she heard her parents say earlier.

Unlike today's shows, the teenage daughter is not promiscuous and does not reveal her body in a way that leads one to think she is a prostitute. The son is not on drugs, does not talk back to his parents, and does not have sex with every girl in the neighborhood. The youngest daughter is not one of those untamed little animals you see terrorizing her parents in the grocery store.

I know people mock the show because it is unrealistic. But it is only unrealistic in the sense that the Anderson's have set the bar very high and in all reality few families can be like them. American television used to portray what the ideal family should be in an effort to foster a desire to be better. Today's television family shows the worst in people so that even a semi-dysfunctional family will feel good about itself in comparison and therefore, not strive to improve or reflect on how it behaves.

I really like this show and my teenage son and 11 year old daughter really like it too. The stories are well written, the production values very high, and the actors perform superbly. This is perfect family entertainment.",1212364800,8,2413,4.604651162790698

I just got (Season 1) a few weeks ago and am loving it.
When discussing 1950's TV shows there is always talk about Real life vs the way it is portrayed on TV.
Well ofcourse no family is as perfect as they are portrayed on 'Father knows best' or 'Leave it to Beaver' but the point is that these shows used the families as role models so that we could see what we all should aspire to be like.
I know that when I was a child the values in these shows helped to teach
me what proper behavior and improper behavior looked like and what the consequences of each were.
Sure my parents taught me these things too but seeing it played out on TV really brought the lessons to my attention.
The core family and life values in this show are still valid today because they are timeless.
So I highly recommend 'Father knows best' to anyone who wants to see good clean television that will make you laugh and warm your heart.

3093396,5,B0012Q3SZ0,"Upon watching all of the episodes on Disc 1 of this 4-Disc ""Father Knows Best"" DVD set (none of which I remember ever having seen before, even though I recall watching this series many times in reruns over the years), I had simply forgotten how truly good these shows really are -- and right out of the gate too, from the very beginning of Season 1, which is a rather remarkable achievement all by itself.

And while some episodes in this DVD collection have been trimmed to 22+ minutes (which I don't like seeing), not every show seems to have fallen prey to the syndication axe, with some of the shows running more than 25 minutes.

The video quality on the DVDs looks pretty good to me too. Not perfect, but quite decent nonetheless, IMO. (Okay, shoot me...I'm just not going to complain a lot about this set at all, despite some cut shows.)

Maybe I'll sound like a sentimental sap by saying this, but some of these shows are so good and have such good acting that I found myself experiencing a large lump in my throat near the end of the last act -- particularly during the final minutes of ""Live My Own Life"" (where Bud leaves home to live in a shabby room above the local feed store) and ""The Motor Scooter"", which contains a very tender scene near the end between Bud and ""Mrs. Knows Best"" (played by the great Jane Wyatt).

Do any 21st-century TV programs ever leave a lump in your throat after watching them? If so, I'll bet there aren't many (especially comedies).

Even though it's not a perfect DVD set in every way, I'd still highly recommend ""Father Knows Best: Season One"" on Digital Versatile Disc.

Or, as Betty Anderson might put it, these FKB shows are simply ""excruciatingly divine!""

3093400,5,B0012Q3SZ0,Father Knows Best was one of the best situation comedies of all time with top notch acting.  All of the actors are great.  My opinion is that Billy Gray ( Bud ) is the best child actor of all time.  You will watch these over and over again if you like classic tv shows.,1207958400,2,269,3.9444444444444446
3093401,1,B0012Q3SZ0,"This show was a wonderful classic production that I have been eagerly anticipating for more than a year.  I was all prepared to purchase it the day of release when I saw the reviews saying that the company distributing the shows on DVD had chosen not to give us the full, unedited shows as orginally broadcast. Reviewers used the term ""butchered"" and that was enough for me to decide that I would NOT purchase this DVD set after all.  So, Shout Factory listen up - the consumers want quality, full broadcast versions - not what you edit to fit on a minium amount of space!  I urge all fans of ""Father Knows Best"" to wait for the best!",1207785600,58,634,4.3559322033898304

3327528,3,B0012Q3SZ0,"The show itself, as originally produced by the talent involved 50+ years ago, is a great show. But for Shout Factory to rely on butchered ""syndication"" and rerun prints (22-mins) instead of the original 26-min prime-time network run is unforgiveable! At least they didn't do what Infinity/Roxbury did with another Columbia/Screen Gems classic (Route 66) and butcher off the tops/bottoms of all frames of all episodes to force a PHONY ""widescreen"" 16x9 aspect-ratio picture! (I hope I just didn't give SF or anyone else any ideas of butchering 4x3 pictures to force phony 16x9 widescreen!)

And prior to the 1963/64 TV season, Screen Gems (Columbia Pictures) had their closing Columbia Torch-Lady Statue logo actually integrated into the end of the closing credits/theme-song.

(With 1963/64, SG started using a seperate logo/jingle after the closing theme/credits had just finished, the animated ""sticks & dots"" visual with ""J-E-L-L-O-like"" fanfare jingle; with 1965/66 and for many seasons following, the animated 'S' visual with electronic Eric-Siday-composed jingle; the torchglow sunrise animated logo with new electronic music with 1976/77; and so forth; Sony has usually REMVOVED these 1960s/70s/80s standalone SG/Columbia logos of the original era and replaced them with the current Sony logo, unfortunately).

But the pre-1963/64 Columbia Pictures Torch Lady Statue logo (and there were two versions -- the 1955-60 and the 1960-63) were integrated into the closing theme song at the very end. You see it not only in FKB, but in Donna, Dennis, Route 66, Naked City, Hazel, and other 1950s/60s SG TV shows, if the show isn't edited. And in FKB's first season, SG used a different closing logo but also integrated into the end of the closing theme, the ""TV Screen"" logo.

For the most part the Shout Factory DVD 1st season set has these ""TV screen"" logos LOPPED OFF. The music of the closing theme song just ""stops"" without the proper ending, since the integrated closing logo was cut-off.

At least the ORIGINAL ""Promised Playhouse"" (which was 26-mins) has that ""TV Screen"" logo on the closing theme. The ""flashback"" version of ""Promised Playhouse"" (rerun-butchered to 22-mins) from a later season has the Columbia Torch Lady Statue logo included. And the ""special"" episode ""24-Hours in Tyrant Land"" has its closing theme with Columbia Torch Lady logo intact in the closing theme as well.

Didn't the Robert Young estate or Sony (formerly Screen Gems/Columbia Pictures) have the COMPLETE unedited prints in their libraries?

3327529,3,B0012Q3SZ0,"Lots of the syndicated (TVLand) versions here. So, if you focus on the great menus that Shout Factory created instead, you'll be much happier. Too bad, I used to think of Shout Factory as being a high quality operation. I guess I was wrong.

The show itself is good and worth purchasing if the price drops to reflect the syndicated shows. Especially with these great menus (they really are better than you can make on your own computer). That would be between $10 and $12.

It looks, to me, as though Shout Factory recorded most of these from TVLand and then cut out the commercials. There are many such versions widely available on the Internet and you can get the whole series almost for the price of this set, but the menus won't be nearly as good as what Shout Factory gives you. Since Shout Factory doesn't want to do better than this, you might as well buy the other versions. You really aren't getting your moneys' worth with this set.

Shout Factory just doesn't want to be bothered anymore with the little details - like providing full uncut shows. But they are really good with those menus!",1207267200,14,1100,4.545454545454546

3327531,1,B0012Q3SZ0,"Father Knows Best was a wonderful television program.  A review of the show would get 5 stars.  These reviews are not supposed to be testimonials or nostalgic trips back to one's childhood; they should be reviews of the product.  That is the reason I am awarding this product a single star.  There is no excuse whatsoever for a company to give the buying public edited versions of tv shows that have been in existence for so many years.  I wrongfully assumed that since the Young family trust gave its blessing to this project that the dvd set would be top notch and first class.  Shout Factory could not even present episode number one in its original form.  The first show was barely 22 minutes with complete opening sequence and closing credits.  The editing to trim the show by the three minutes was done with a hatchet that a child of four could notice.  I suppose this is better than no Father Knows Best at all, but not by much. My advice is to check the manufacturer of dvd's and make sure that Shout Factory had nothing to do with it.  Otherwise, you will receive less than you hoped for and less than you paid for.",1207180800,150,1124,4.439024390243903
3327532,5,B0012Q3SZ0,"The 203 half-hour episodes of the situation comedy ""Father Knows Best"" were originally broadcast on CBS & NBC from 1954 to 1960. This DVD set includes the 26 episodes from the 1954-55 broadcast season. The set also includes several special features detailed on Amazon's item description.

The series itself was a well-written ""suburban"" version of ""Make Room For Daddy"" (which had premiered a year earlier on ABC) with Robert Young playing the Danny Thomas part.  The title character Jim Anderson (Young) is an agent with the General Insurance Company. He lives with his family on South Maple Street in Springfield (a town in an undisclosed Midwestern state).  Jim's character is to a large degree the featured player on the series.  Young had done ""Father Knows Best"" for five seasons on radio and was the only cast member retained for the television production.

Jane Wyatt (not to be confused with Jane Wyman) plays his wife Margaret, a simple 1950's homemaker. Former child star Elinor Donahue plays his oldest daughter Betty, Jim calls her ""Princess"". Billy Gray plays teenage son James Jr., called ""Bud"" by everyone in the series. Lauren Chapin plays younger daughter Kathy; called ""Kitten"" by her father. During Season One Betty is 17, Bud is 14, and Kathy is nine.

The Anderson's live in a nice ""Leave In to Beaver"" ""Brady Bunch"" type home and neighborhood. Although nothing really bad ever happens in Springfield (at least until ""The Simpsons"") the series was considerably less bland than your standard suburban sitcom and did not fall back on guest stars playing an assortment of silly characters.

Jim is not a raving nutcase (insert Danny Thomas here) and Margaret is not an airhead (insert Lucy here). Neither parent outshines the other in the wisdom or competence departments. Like Beaver and Opie the kids get into their fair share of trouble and have misunderstandings with their parents. Jim and Margaret know enough to get out of the way of their children and let them learn from their own mistakes.

Along with Young, Donahue and Gray are the strength of the series. The inexperienced Chapin was in over her head and I always wished that they could have swapped her for Angela Cartwright (or her sister Veronica), who could have passed physically for Donahue's sister.  But Chaplin did her best.  All three children have frequent moments of anger and self-centeredness. Betty is often realistically uptight, and it is likely Shelley Fabares used her as a model when she started playing teenage daughter Mary on ""The Donna Reed Show"" in 1958.  Donahue's character a few years later on ""The Andy Griffith Show"" was much softer and more relaxed.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1205798400,5,2709,4.955849889624724

I'm thrilled to see this coming out for home ownership!  This series gave me hope for what could be in a family.  I wasn't so idealistic that I thought everything about them was real, but as a young kid I sure thought maybe we could have some of the dynamics I saw on the series.  Congratulations to everyone who starts collecting this series.  It just might put some seriously renewed hopefulness for the state of the family back into America.

3327536,5,B0012Q3SZ0,"I grew up in a very difficult, unconventional family during the 1950s that was anything but conservative. Nothing about it resembled the ""average, American middle-class"" family - the Anderson's - depicted so flawlessly on Father Knows Best. My family didn't look like the Anderson's, they didn't sound like the Anderson's, and they certainly didn't act like the Anderson's.

Nonetheless, I loved everything about that TV family just because it was so completely foreign to my life. I was totally, hopelessly captivated by their perfectly rosy lives. It wasn't that I wanted the Anderson's to be my family, I just loved visiting them each week, sort of like going to another planet without needing a space ship.

I grew up to be a liberal feminist, so nothing about my adult life now resembles the Anderson's in the least, even now. But, I STILL love them! I love the warmth, the messages, and even the strong patriarchal structure. In fact, that is exactly what distinguishes Father Knows Best from the other 50s all-white family shows, like Leave It To Beaver and the Donna Reed Show. Those other shows focus on the children, but it was the Dad that was paramount in this show - how he responded to his family and how they responded to him. So, major kudos to Shout! Factory for this wonderful release.

Father Knows Best was first a radio series on NBC Radio in 1949 before finally moving to CBS TV after more than four years. A Screen Gems production, the series aired from October 3, 1954 to May 23, 1960 for a total of 203 episodes. The series ended while it was still number 6 in the ratings. (Young left the series in 1960 at the height of the show's popularity, but reruns continued to air in prime time for another three years, on CBS from 1960-1962, and on ABC from 1962-1963. Following this, reruns were shown on ABC-TV in the early afternoon for several years.)

The Anderson family of Springfield, Mo., includes hardworking General Insurance agent Jim (Young), his levelheaded and lovely wife, Margaret (Jane Wyatt - who later became a cultural icon when she portrayed Spock's mother, Amanda, on Star Trek), and their kids, sophisticated teen Betty ""Princess"" (Elinor Donahue), befuddled James ""Bud"" Jr. (Billy Gray) and precocious Kathy ""Kitty"" (Laurin Chapin). Both Jim and Margaret where portrayed as responsible, caring parents, with Jim usually guiding the family (especially the children) through everyday problems and Margaret supporting them. Jim and Margaret always treated their children's youthful transgressions with authority, empathy and wisdom.

This first-ever DVD release of the series was endorsed and produced in tandem with the heirs of Robert Young and producer Eugene B. Rodney, co-proprietors of the TV series.

Father Knows Best: Season One DVD box set features all 26 classic episodes on four discs plus the never-before-seen episode 24 Hours in Tyrantland, which was created for the U.S. government in 1959, new cast interviews of the ""kids,"" Young's Home Movies, rare ""behind-the-scenes"" color footage, and the pilot episode of Young's TV series Window On Main Street.

Season One Episodes (1954-1955) are: Bud Takes Up The Dance; Lesson In Citizenship; Motor Scooters; Football Tickets; Live My Own Life; Grandpa Jim's Rejuvenation; Bud's Encounter With The Law; Thanksgiving Day; Second Honeymoon; Typical Father; Margaret Goes Dancing; The Christmas Story; Sparrow At The Window; Boy's Week; A Friend of Old George's; Bud the Snob; The Promised Playhouse (Apparently, this episode was not intact in the archives, but was loaned for inclusion here by a private collector in Dallas who had a 16mm copy!); Jim The Farmer; Father of The Year; The Mink Coat; The Matchmaker; Bud the Bridesmaid; Proud Father; Father Delivers The Papers; No Partiality; and  Close Decision.

DVD Special: 24 Hours In Tyrantland, the never-before-seen episode created especially for the U.S. government. In 1959 the U.S. Department of the Treasury paid to have a special episode produced. It was never broadcast, but was shown in schools, churches and civic groups for the purpose of selling U.S. Savings Bonds. When Betty, Bud and Kathy don't want to help sell U.S. Bonds, Jim teaches them a lesson by making them spend a day living under a tyrannical dictator - him!

I know, I know, Mrs. Anderson always dressed to the nines and NEVER worked out of the house, she and her husband slept in twin beds, their eldest daughter was nicknamed ""Princess"" and everything that was already perfect in their whiter-that-white world ended up even more perfect by the end of each episode. But, there was real love in the Anderson house. I know there was because my little-kid-self felt it. So, it may not be politically correct, but I rejoice in this show's release and look forward with eager anticipation to pulling my chair up to the Anderson's table for a very long-overdue home-cooked dinner.

I have streamed many of the seasons of Father Knows Best when streaming became available, and now I'm deciding to add a few DVD's of their shows to my collection of 60's sitcom.  I learned some interesting facts off the special features section with Elinor Donahue actress and she tells her story of marrying young in life, and having a baby.  Thus she disappeared from Father Knows Best and when they decided to bring back the Betty character she told them that she had cut off her hair and had it real short. Thus the shortened hair look when she came back from the show.  I was also always curious about the time period she appeared on the Andy Griffith show as a love interest for Andy in the early years, but left abruptly as suddenly as she had appeared!",1438992000,,931,4.327586206896552

I am appalled that a company that sells DVDs can produce something this horrible.  If you can stomach watching a scene when it abruptly cuts out to black, then buy this set.

A lot of times it would pause for at least a minute or two so it would take over an hour to watch an entire episode!!!! I bought mine from an Amazon third party seller named ""Greatstuffatlowprices"" which should be called ""Defectivestuffatlowprices""!!!!

A happy family lives in a pretty house, love abounds, and every upset is cured within 30 minutes. This may sound like a formula for a failed TV show, but for me and many other people born in the 50s, it's a slice of heaven. The clothes and cars are fun to see, the manners are sorely missed, and the positive feelings put me in a good mood. That's more than I can say for most of today's television programs. True, it made all of us wish we had homes like the Anderson family and might have made us feel like failures for not being more like them.

Unlike Leave it to Beaver, it truly shows the give and take between siblings in a normal family and reminds us that kids have always been kind of squirrelly and unkind to each other!  lol  Great morals and shows the importance of a mom and dad who are willing to apologize to their kids when they are wrong and let their children have opinions of their own, while still being strong leaders who aren't doormats for their sons and daughters.

3327792,5,B0012Q3SZ0,"I just got a new (Amazon) Kindle HDX 8.9 -- just yesterday.

Today a friend needed a driver for a visit to Mayo Clinic.
I sat in the waiting room for 2+ hours.
With earbuds I watched several episodes of Father Knows Best.
Two hours went by easily. The video and the sound are exceptional.
(I also downloaded and watched Dick Van Dyck shows with the Wi-Fi at Mayo. Fast. No streaming needed. Incredible.)

I have had almost every Kindle since the first Fire. My current Kindle HDX 8.9 is almost unbelievable:
1.) On the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9"" Episodes do not need to be streamed -- once downloaded, each episode plays without interruption;
2.) The Internet is incredibly fast;
3.) The clarity of the video and the Dolby sound are incredible.

You might surmise -- and you would be correct -- that this review is oriented more toward the new Kindle HDX than it is for the Father Knows Best Videos.

Conclusion:
1.) The Amazon Prime account that includes ""free"" (free after the yearly $79) videos is incredible;
2.) The quality of this Father Knows Best video is amazing -- as is the sound;
3.) New on my Kindle HDX -- I get closed captioning.

Five stars for the ""free"" Prime videos.
Then five stars for the new Kindle HDX.",1386892800,,1219,4.497737556561086

The conflicts faced by the characters, even though artificial, remind one that we can find civil and kind ways to solve everyday problems.

The picture and sound quality are perfect.  My only regrets are this show didn't go on for a few more seasons and that seasons 5 & 6 have some repeat episodes  such as ""Betty's Graduation,  Father The Naturalist, First Dillusionment etc. ""  I highly recommend this show for anyone looking for a quality family program that may have been over-looked due to time ( over 50 yrs old tv )",1331942400,2,655,4.371900826446281

It's still full of everyday antics that 3 children can come up with, and believe me these 3 are full of them.  The best thing is there's Betty who's a teenager, Bud who's almost a teenager and Little Kathy who's in grade school, there something for just about any age on this show and it's just a clean, fun show with wonderful actors who seem to really love what they are doing, you'd never know they weren't a real family.  Sure it's a little like Leave it to Beaver, but do they get any better???  The mother is Jane Wyatt, she's absolutely beautiful, and so smart and funny.  You'll be happy your purchased this one, we love it.  There's only one small thing we didn't like, the Father smokes sometimes, not very often, but it does have an ad for cigarettes at the beginning of one of the shows and when that show comes on, he's lighting one up.  I don't smoke, and don't want to encourage my child to smoke, so that disturbs me some, but I do realize that was a different era.  Buy this one, you'll love it, and your kids will long for those days or be happy for what they have in this day, either way it's a positive show about positive, good, things for the most part. No bad language, no fighting, no guns, just good old fun. Hope you enjoy!!!  Got mine from Amazon, they are the best!!! Thanks Amazon for having such a wide variety of Clean, Family Shows!!  Hope you continue to offer these. Until next time, May God Bless you all with good health, happiness and prosperity.",1311379200,,1624,4.305921052631579
3327849,4,B0012Q3SZ0,"As several reviewers have pointed out, SHOUT did a lousy job on the first year's episodes of FKB.  The video quality is nothing to brag about, nor is the audio.  You can easily see where certain episodes have been cut.  Shame on SHOUT.

But on the other hand, I don't know all the details of why.  Did the full episodes still exist?  After all, only a few of Roy Rogers old films exist in their entirety...many only exist as the cut versions to fit in an hour of television time (with commercials).  Many of the Hollywood Squares episodes are completely gone.  There are stories that virtually all of Perry Como's variety series programs (at one time the hottest program on television) were trashed.  I'd love to know the truth about FKB.

But, when I was growing up, FKB was considered the best situation comedy on television in our house.  Then, a few months ago, I decided to buy season 3 because of a couple of particular episodes, and after that, season 4.  What a polished show FKB had become, and there is little doubt in my mind that the ""kids"" here were probably the best child actors on television.  I began to realize that FKB wasn't really so much of a situation comedy, but portrayals of ideal family life (at least for the 1950s), with a great deal of humor added in.  So after watching seasons 3 and 4, it was interesting to later go back and watch season 1.  That pilot/first episode -- truly just a situation comedy; Bud and Kathy not smooth at all; and worst of all -- Jim Anderson smoking up a storm!  Then, episode 2 was already an improvement...still essentially a situation comedy, but this time with a moral message, too.  And that's how this show developed.  Thank goodness it survived low ratings that first year through the efforts of its fans!

Yes, disappointing quality for video and audio, but rewarding none the less.  But I really would suggest watching some later seasons first, then going back to the beginning.",1301356800,,1945,4.582608695652174

The introduction of the Anderson Family, one of the most beloved in television history is well represented in all of the episodes presented in this volume.  The DVD quality is excellent, I found no problems with audio or video in this set.  It is interesting to view the American home in 1954, with Margaret Anderson, typical housewife, in pearls, dresses and high heels (a la June Cleaver) doing housework!  In all truth, however, most housewives did not wear pants, my mom didn't, they were not as prevalent as today.
Regardless, all of these marvelous episodes, even in a ""genesis"" stage of an evolving sitcom, transmit such warmth, humor and humanity, a precursor to even better writing and situations in the next seasons, as the show ""grew"" into its legend status.

3327856,2,B0012Q3SZ0,"Sadly I must add to the complaints about SHOUT using the old, poorly transfered, 1980's filmchain transfers that Columbia Pictures Television made for syndicating the shows. Columbia hacked off 4 minutes as well as the original Screen Gems logo at the end.

Then the old reel-to-reel 1"" video tapes were copied & sent over to SFM who was going to synduicate the shows for FREE to TV stations in exchange for commercial time (called barter in the industry).  Now SFM replaced the Columbia Television logo with their tacky computer graphic SFM logo, replacing the original music as well.

Now that Sony owns Columbia Pictures, they retrieved the old edited 1"" reel-to-reel video tapes from SFM & converted them over to more modern Beta SP cartridge tape, complete with all of the 20 year old video tape glitches.  Now they tagger their new Sony Television logo to the end, often after the SFM logo.

With the copyright owners not interested in releasing this show to home video, SHOUT Factory contracted the rights to do so.  Unfortunetaly SHOUT does not own the show & releases only what they are given & Sony gave them the 3rd generation dubs of the 20+ year old video tape film transfers.  SHOUT also removed all evidence of the previous TV syndicators logos (abruptly cutting the end credits) in hopes that we would not notice they are the cut syndication versions.

Based on the very good bonus material in this DVD, some effort was put into this release. But nobody wanted to invest the money to re-master the original fim negatives for this release, or the posterity of preserving the show.

It would have been nice if Sony had accessed Columbia's oroginal transfers before the edits were made, but it is possible they were erased.",1262217600,5,1736,4.798657718120805

3327860,5,B0012Q3SZ0,"""Father Knows Best"" debuted in 1954 and has been captivating audiences for more than fifty years. The reason is simple:  Even though we all didn't have the perfect lives of the Anderson's, we still wanted to.  It was what we (down deep) really wanted.  Nobody can have a 'TV life"" and yet, we are drawn back to those halcyon times when life was simpler and richer.

I had the pleasure of growing up around the reruns of ""Father Knows Best"" and other shows like it and I gotta tell you, there is little today that can match it.  Why?  Have we become so sophisticated that we can't appreciate the simple things?  Do we have to have ""deep"" plots, or explosions, or morbid drama, or gut-wrenching social commentary?  There is a place for those things.  But there is also a place for this show.

You might know actor Robert Young from the many other roles he had not only in television but in film as well.  He went on after this series to play the distinguished and compassionate ""Marcus Welby, M.D"" from 1969 to 1974.  He was, in my opinion, one of the finest actors ever to step in front of the camera. (And one of the classiest too.)

""Father Knows Best"" takes place in Springfield, Ohio.  Robert Young's character Jim Anderson plays an easy-going, kindly insurance salesman with an abundance of patience and wisdom given to his children who always end up needing Dad's advice, or learning an important lesson from him.
Jane Wyatt plays his wife, Margaret with class, style and beauty.

To me, ""Father Knows Best"" is the gold standard for this type and genre of entertainment.  It was a TV show I could relate to.  Not that I had the ""ideal"" childhood.  But it was good and shows like these added to it.

This is a DVd set you will want to go back to many times.  The episodes are uncut for commercials so you get the full 30 minutes.  The quality is excellent and like the potato chips, once you watch one, you will have to have more.  But if 1950's television is not your thing you will probably want to pass this up.

Sometimes when I think about it, I sort of wish that with all our modern-day, real-life dramas, there was a Springfield, Ohio of the type on this show to get away to for a while.  But then, I pop one of these DVD's in the player and I'm taken away to a place I love to be.",1238198400,3,2292,4.338823529411765

They could have gotten any of the remaining alive cast members to comment or had academics discuss the social aspects of the series.  It's amazing to see the father so often portrayed as the bad guy, the kids as very rebellious and the mom the hero.  It's very unlike what most media people claim about the show.

3327864,5,B0012Q3SZ0,"I used to watch this every morning & again late afternoons during the mid 1980s on The CBN Cable Network which was a channel that once showcased the finest vintage sitcoms ever.

I watched Bachelor Father, Dobie Gillis & Father Knows Best everyday & had my video machine going to put 'em all on tape.  As a result I've got loads of Father Knows Best episodes & have even transferred some to DVD as the show hadn't been yet made available on DVD, so my homemade DVDs were something to tide me over anyway.

I'm very pleased to see the series finally get the DVD treatment.  I, like some of the others am displeased & think it unfortunate that some of these are syndicated prints.  However, as this is a true rarity & has been scarce in rerun markets over the years, I'll gladly take the first & second season & every & any additional seasons that become available in the future. Episodes of Father Knows Best in any DVD offering, syndicated and/or otherwise is better than not having it in any form at all.  Sure, I'd love having the completely unedited prints same as many others who have griped about this, but if the syndicated are the majority of prints available in this set, then so be it.  They will due until some distributor makes the unedited ones available. For the time being, I'm satisfied.

Some of my favorite episodes were the one where Kathy played a sleuth to unravel a mystery, the one where Kathy is a real tomboy & in the closing scene she makes a grand entrance to her date in a lovely dress.  The one where Kathy takes a friend's baby sister & wants to be her mother which had been in one of the earlier shows.

Betty awaiting word on her boyfriend, the jet pilot, Betty being a snob to Bud around her friends, the christmas show which featured Wallace Ford as Santy.  Great, great episodes. These plots had morals & The Andersons are a staple of 1950s middle class wholesome americana.

I also LOVED Father Knows Best: Home For Christmas, one of the two reunion movies of 1977 (hadn't seen the previous one, Father Knows Best Reunion).

I thought Billy Gray (Bud) was so cute & endearing as he had gotten into his upper teens!

Elinor Donahue (Betty) was so down-to-earth & upbeat & had some of the most comical one-liners in some of the earlier episodes where she'd make a sharp-witted remark about Bud to Father!  She also had a warm & bright smile that was remarkable.

Lauren Chapin (Kathy) was everyone's favorite half-pint tomboyish kid sister who at times felt neglected & was always there with a shoulder.  I bought Lauren Chapin's Father Does Know Best autobiography back when it was first released & am proud to have it in my library of favorite publications/memorabilia.  I empathize with all she's overcome & the  inner strength & determination that got her through it in the long run.  We LOVE you, Lauren!

Jim & Margaret were there with words of wisdom & instilled values in their children which is timeless & makes this show appropriate for kids of all ages.  It's also clean & inoffensive & makes the grade as a classic worth having in your DVD library of really good 1950s family sitcoms.  I'm an avid fan of the vintage radio series as well!",1226275200,7,3183,4.526223776223776

3327868,3,B0012Q3SZ0,"I think we need to get past certain things; well, at least I do. I need to not get so cranky that these are the poorly edited syndication versions (and not the pristine looking, uncut episodes like we got from I Love Lucy and The Twilight Zone dvd collections).
I've gotten totally spoiled by some dvd releases of television programs, and it's really not realistic to expect all retro series to be that great. Right?

So, the quality here is like watching vhs tapes recorded off cable. Better than not having the show at all, some would say. It's just annoying when Jane Wyatt opens her mouth to say something and the scene suddenly fades to black, then we cut to the same scene moments later. It's disorienting. Someone did a lousy job of editing these programs for commercials. Certain segments are removed, and often we are brought into the action after some dialogue has already been established. Trimming has been done at the beginning of scenes, and before the end of scenes. It's a lowdown shame that the scissors have been taken to these programs so much to make room for more ads.

Plus, the very end of the closing credits has been chopped off (could be a trademark issue that Shout Factory couldn't legally show). But that's no big deal, it's just jarring to have the music stop out of the blue.

Father Knows Best is a fun show that many folks grew up with. It is a hoot to revisit the Andersons and witness the values, the fashions, the slang, the old furnishings. Certainly it has dated, but somehow that adds to the charm.
So, my rating is a mix between my feelings for the program itself and also my opinion of the dvd quality.

My family was not perfect (whose is?), but the idealized family of Jim and Margaret ""inspired"" me to realize that--perhaps--all of us could put forth a little more effort to BE like them. I was taught values in my church, at school and at home; and ""Father Knows Best"" reinforced those timeless values of problem-solving in a family, improving relationships, kindness, forgiveness, hard work, moral purity, etc. It also showed me values that I wish MY family had had and made me strive to be like the Andersons when I grew up. Well, I HAVE grown up (years ago), and I am pleased to say that ""Father Knows Best,"" ""The Donna Reed Show,"" ""Leave It to Beaver,"" ""Ozzie and Harriett"" and many more shows are a (good) part of who I am.

3327882,5,B0012Q3SZ0,"I have not seen this show in 30 years and I amazed how well the it holds up in the 21st century. The first season aired in 1954 and 1955 and it was based on the popular radio show that was broadcast from 1949 through 1953. Although the Anderson's do not look like any family you would see today, they do portray what every family wishes it could be. The Andersons represent a solid family where ever member is valued, and character and integrity are expected by all. The parents, Jim and Margret, work together to confront the difficulties of raising three children. Margaret looks to Jim as the head of the household. Jim does not abuse his position as the ""man of the house"" and constantly treats his wife Margret with the utmost respect and love. Therefore, Jim feels respected and Margaret feels loved and together they make a perfect team.

Bud, the second child, is the one who seems to always find trouble which sets the stage for endless hours of entertainment. Betty, the oldest, is very level-headed and responsible but as a teenage girl, she does encounter her share of problems. Finally there is Kathy, the little sister, who keeps the pot stirring by always making the inappropriate comment or lets the cat out of the bag by purposely repeating what she heard her parents say earlier.

Unlike today's shows, the teenage daughter is not promiscuous and does not reveal her body in a way that leads one to think she is a prostitute. The son is not on drugs, does not talk back to his parents, and does not have sex with every girl in the neighborhood. The youngest daughter is not one of those untamed little animals you see terrorizing her parents in the grocery store.

I know people mock the show because it is unrealistic. But it is only unrealistic in the sense that the Anderson's have set the bar very high and in all reality few families can be like them. American television used to portray what the ideal family should be in an effort to foster a desire to be better. Today's television family shows the worst in people so that even a semi-dysfunctional family will feel good about itself in comparison and therefore, not strive to improve or reflect on how it behaves.

I really like this show and my teenage son and 11 year old daughter really like it too. The stories are well written, the production values very high, and the actors perform superbly. This is perfect family entertainment.",1212364800,8,2413,4.604651162790698

I jumped on it and ordered it the same day. It's a heart warming tv show and i am very happy with the quality. I had read some of the reviews that are rather critical of this set prior to buying it and i'm really glad i didn't let these critical reviews sway me not to purchase this set. It's thoroughly enjoyable and is like owning a piece of television history. Although these episodes may be cut by a minute or two, it certainly wasn't noticeable. The episodes story line flowed well and the picture quality was better than i expected. I personally am thrilled to have season one of ""Father Knows Best"" It's absolutely worth the money!*I hope the following seasons are made available very quickly,so we all can enjoy more seasons of ""Father Knows Best""",1210982400,4,907,4.503030303030303
3327888,5,B0012Q3SZ0,At last the greatest TV show of the 50's. I watched it and it is just wonderful. Can't wait for Season 2. I don't know about anybody else but mine are in Black & White.,1209859200,,168,3.8285714285714287
3327889,5,B0012Q3SZ0,"I purchased this DVD on the day it was released & I don't find anything wrong with it. Some of the reviews were just terrible & I didn't know if I would buy it. But I did & there is nothing wrong with it. The picture was very good. Some of the episodes may be cut by a few minutes but, I didn't notice that at all. Also, the shows that one person said aren't on this DVD set are on there. The pilot episode was there also. If you like Father knows best then buy it today.

3327890,1,B0012Q3SZ0,"I bought this dvd because it was one of my favorite shows back in the 50's & 60's. Then before I even got it I looked at it again and found out it was in color. This show was never meant to be in color so why do the company's that put out these dvd's coloreise them????? just runions the whole dvd. This was made in Black & White and should be left in Black & White. I can't answer for everyone, but I want these old shows in Black & White like they were meant to be. Good luck on unloading these dvd's. I sent mine back when it arived without even opening it up. So sad these company's would do this to such a fine show. When they bring it out in Black & White I will pruchase it.",1209772800,7,681,3.8368794326241136
3327891,5,B0012Q3SZ0,"This SEASON 1 of the ""FATHER KNOWS BEST"" show is MORE
than I expected!  It brought back many memories of sitting
with the family on Wednesday nights in the early 50's enjoying
the antics and problems of the Anderson family. The BONUS
features are exceptional!  ANYONE wanting good, clean FAMILY
fun and entertainment should get this set.  As for us older
folks, there's plenty of nostalgic memories to test the senses!
CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON 2!!!",1209427200,2,445,4.828947368421052
3327892,5,B0012Q3SZ0,"This has been one of my all-time favorite shows ever since I was a kid in the late 1960's and early '70s.
I just got (Season 1) a few weeks ago and am loving it.
When discussing 1950's TV shows there is always talk about Real life vs the way it is portrayed on TV.
Well ofcourse no family is as perfect as they are portrayed on 'Father knows best' or 'Leave it to Beaver' but the point is that these shows used the families as role models so that we could see what we all should aspire to be like.
I know that when I was a child the values in these shows helped to teach
me what proper behavior and improper behavior looked like and what the consequences of each were.
Sure my parents taught me these things too but seeing it played out on TV really brought the lessons to my attention.
The core family and life values in this show are still valid today because they are timeless.
So I highly recommend 'Father knows best' to anyone who wants to see good clean television that will make you laugh and warm your heart.
I sure hope all 6 seasons get released as I will buy them all.",1209427200,7,1080,4.123222748815166
3327893,5,B0012Q3SZ0,"Upon watching all of the episodes on Disc 1 of this 4-Disc ""Father Knows Best"" DVD set (none of which I remember ever having seen before, even though I recall watching this series many times in reruns over the years), I had simply forgotten how truly good these shows really are -- and right out of the gate too, from the very beginning of Season 1, which is a rather remarkable achievement all by itself.

And while some episodes in this DVD collection have been trimmed to 22+ minutes (which I don't like seeing), not every show seems to have fallen prey to the syndication axe, with some of the shows running more than 25 minutes.

The video quality on the DVDs looks pretty good to me too. Not perfect, but quite decent nonetheless, IMO. (Okay, shoot me...I'm just not going to complain a lot about this set at all, despite some cut shows.)

Maybe I'll sound like a sentimental sap by saying this, but some of these shows are so good and have such good acting that I found myself experiencing a large lump in my throat near the end of the last act -- particularly during the final minutes of ""Live My Own Life"" (where Bud leaves home to live in a shabby room above the local feed store) and ""The Motor Scooter"", which contains a very tender scene near the end between Bud and ""Mrs. Knows Best"" (played by the great Jane Wyatt).

Do any 21st-century TV programs ever leave a lump in your throat after watching them? If so, I'll bet there aren't many (especially comedies).

Even though it's not a perfect DVD set in every way, I'd still highly recommend ""Father Knows Best: Season One"" on Digital Versatile Disc.

Or, as Betty Anderson might put it, these FKB shows are simply ""excruciatingly divine!""

3327894,2,B0012Q3SZ0,"Potential buyers should be aware that these Father Knows Best programs are NOT in color. They have NOT been colorized. I realize that many viewers want everything to be untouched and in the origional black and white. I, however, am dissapointed that this DVD is not in color as Amazon describes above. I also purchased the first season of Bewitched and the colorizing process is extreemly well done on that one.",1209168000,2,411,4.802816901408451

always been a favorite of mine and he is superb as Jim Anderson,husband and father of three wonderful children in a midwestern town of the 1950's.
This is a time when television shows were relaxing and taught a lesson.
I am very glad I made this purchase.",1208131200,5,391,4.36986301369863
3327897,5,B0012Q3SZ0,Father Knows Best was one of the best situation comedies of all time with top notch acting.  All of the actors are great.  My opinion is that Billy Gray ( Bud ) is the best child actor of all time.  You will watch these over and over again if you like classic tv shows.,1207958400,2,269,3.9444444444444446
3327898,1,B0012Q3SZ0,"This show was a wonderful classic production that I have been eagerly anticipating for more than a year.  I was all prepared to purchase it the day of release when I saw the reviews saying that the company distributing the shows on DVD had chosen not to give us the full, unedited shows as orginally broadcast. Reviewers used the term ""butchered"" and that was enough for me to decide that I would NOT purchase this DVD set after all.  So, Shout Factory listen up - the consumers want quality, full broadcast versions - not what you edit to fit on a minium amount of space!  I urge all fans of ""Father Knows Best"" to wait for the best!",1207785600,58,634,4.3559322033898304
