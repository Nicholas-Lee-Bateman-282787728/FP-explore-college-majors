8202815,4,B000RWGCXK,"There are four DVD's in this boxed set:
1. The Doors, ""1968 European Tour.""
2. Canned Heat, ""Live at Montreux.""
3. Jefferson Airplane, ""Fly Jefferson Airplane.""
4. Big Brother and the Holding Company With Janis Joplin, ""Nine Hundred Nights.""

I saw all of these bands live when I was a teenager in 1968 and this is a great set to have. It brings back great memories. Just so you know, the Canned Heat video is from their 1973 concert. Alan Wilson died in 1970, so he is not singing on this video. If you want to see Alan Wilson singing ""Going Up The Country"" and other great songs, get the ""Canned Heat On The Road Again"" DVD. It has lots of Canned Heat videos with all the original band members.",1333238400,9,696,4.3538461538461535
8202816,3,B000RWGCXK,"If you grew up in the ""days of agonizing reappraisal"", the 60's, these documentaries will be a fun reminder of the music of the time. the conversations with the artists are an interesting retrospective, they give you insight as to what was going on in their minds at the time. I love 60's culture and would receomend this for those who want to research the era. If you are just all about the music, you might have more fun just playing your old records, uh I mean cd's",1210982400,6,468,4.329545454545454
