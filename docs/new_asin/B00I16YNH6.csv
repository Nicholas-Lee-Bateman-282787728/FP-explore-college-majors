8638200,5,B00I16YNH6,"I suspect this film may be many viewers first encounter with Bunuel. It was mine years ago and I struggled while watching it, my literal mind trying to make sense out of scenes, instead of accepting that Bunuels lightly surreal world the marriage of reality and fantasy, of objective and subjective means that while the whole fits together quite nicely, getting too caught up in is this real? or more often how real is this? is a mistake.

Time and revisiting helped me appreciate the film more deeply (interesting how often that's the case with great films), but for the newcomer to Bunuel, I suspect the excellent interviews that Criterion includes on its blu-ray would help as well. These give a deeper understanding of Bunuels examination, without judgment, of a secretly sexually masochistic woman -- her tear between the reality she lives and the fantasies of what she wants, and how she tries to bring those two together.

A film to see many times. Its so full of wonderful details (in the soundtrack as well as the images) that I always look forward to re-immersing myself in it.

This release from Studio Canal is a fine blu-ray transfer, but the Criterion is even better (and you need a region-free or region B player for this).  Also, there are other national variations of this region B transfer (same transfer, different packaging) available in the 'main' listing for the film here on Amazon.  UK, France, etc all work off this Studio Canal version.  Let price and details be your guide.",1462060800,,1500,4.794573643410852
