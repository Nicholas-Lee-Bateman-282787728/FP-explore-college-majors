3521401,1,B001D0T4IK,"Warning! Spoilers ahead.

This second TV movie of the series is not as good as the first one because of the following reasons:

1. They reveal the faces of the bad guys too soon. They do that after 27 minutes into the film. It takes away the suspense for the remaining 60 minutes.

2. The story is so far-fetched that it's comical. For example, the bad guys beat C.B's daughter and son in their own houses to scare them away from the investigation. In reality, who would want to do that? How could you do that and expect the whole police department would leave you in peace?

3. There's no twist. It's predictable from the beginning till the end.

4. The worst thing is the action scene at the end. It's like a child's play. Charles Bronson, with empty hands, knocked out the guy sitting beside him in the car. That guy was pointing the gun to his left side of the body. The driver of the car, then, got out of his seat, opened the door to the rear seat, just to be punched down by C.B. The third bad guy, who was hiding in the house with lights out, stepped out in to the lighted area to be shot down by C.B. It was so bad that I could not believe it was a Charles Bronson' movie.

Compared to Family of Cops 1, I believe the script of this one was rushed to production. That's why it's so bad.

Save your time and money on this one.",1371772800,,1334,4.127413127413128
3521402,5,B001D0T4IK,"A family Cop show before Blue Bloods! Don't compare Mr. Select and Mr. Bronson. This review is about a three movie for TV with Bronson as tough and quiet as he is an adorable Father with his children and Grandchildren. As proud as he is of his children that have followed him into the Police Profession, he Hates that they are on the line of fire. But they have skills he wishes they used in another line of work. But when the bad guys target his family the gloves come off Grandpa and Bronson does Bronson like no one else. Always a pleasure to watch a master at work. This movie does not tip its hand on how or if the end is what we hope for.",1366329600,2,644,4.078740157480315
