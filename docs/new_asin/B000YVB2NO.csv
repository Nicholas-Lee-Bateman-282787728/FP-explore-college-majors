3036235,5,B000YVB2NO,"I like this documentary!  I recommend it for anyone who is curious about forgiveness and its power.  This documentary nearly covers the 'water front of forgiveness. It highlights different approaches to forgiveness, psychological, spiritual, interpersonal and even international. If you want a broad overview about forgiveness this is an excellent resource.  I have used it as stand-alone event  and I have used clips from it as part of workshops to generate forgiveness conversations.  I find it informative and inspiring.  It is not an instructional video oriented toward teaching forgiveness; there are other forgiveness videos more oriented for instruction. One I would recommend is Forgive for Good by Dr. Frederic Luskin.
There is one forgiveness approach, the inclusion of which would make the documentary feel more complete for me, which is Radical Forgiveness, the work of Colin Tipping.  If you are looking for an overview or introduction to forgiveness, I don't believe you a video much better than this.  If you are wondering if there is real power in forgiveness, I believe, in this video, you will find evidence that there is.",1458000000,,1140,5.259668508287293

But this movie was a powerful scientific and spiritual consideration of what forgiveness really is.

3036258,3,B000YVB2NO,"It's ok. A little depressing especially when they hit upon 9/11. I was shocked about the yard where they took all the stuff from the two towers. It is sad that it still has remains of loved ones there. And there is no memorial there to let this place be a sacred place for those who never recovered their loved ones. Not as much as a plaque or anything. I felt so bad for the one mother who was there and placed a bouquet of flowers into a very barren piece of land. She said ""my son is here someplace but who cares? No one. I have a son and tried to think what if that were my son? My heart was so torn for mer along with others who have loved ones there and no recognition. They are being treated like ""garbage and trash."" I never knew that!!!",1436745600,,745,4.006711409395973

3036269,4,B000YVB2NO,The DVD is an engaging introduction to the topic of forgiveness.  Thoughts are shared by some of the most profound people of our day including Weisel and the Dali Lama.  What is offered through review of specific experiences are the difficulties and possibilities among human relations be it individual or global.  What the DVD does not offer are evidence based studies (that do exist) that could have enlightened the path of forgiveness even more.,1426896000,,448,5.027027027027027

It shows the harmful effects of unforgiveness on health and how society and the world would benefit from learning to forgive. I love the beginning with the school in Ireland that started a Forgiveness curriculum to teach the younger generations how to forgive in order to help bring about peace in the future.

I watched it several times, once by myself and once with a friend at which time we kept pausing it to discuss the content.  I have since given my copy away to the local Woman's Shelter because I believed they could use it for the work that they do.  Hopefully it continues to do good there.

This film was one best films have EVER seen in this Genre!!! it is simple, pure as you see,hear,take In the experience of real people( who like on the cover lived this )and give us the gift of their words and experiences  Had more of an impact on the viewer than any other way of presentation or directing .YES it changed my life on how I perceive and understand the world -that's a 5 star film to be sure!.
I bought a copy for each of my sons and my parents.which I have never done before,ever.

3036332,5,B000YVB2NO,"This DVD is an excellent documentary about its title, THE POWER OF FORGIVENESS.  There are interviews and comments from such notable  intellectuals as Elie Wiesel and Thich Nhat Hanh. It is a moving story, as well, about the effects of forgiveness on both the person offering forgiveness as well as the person receiving it.  Unforgiveness poisons individuals, groups, and even countries against one another. It is such an apt topic for our times, for all times. In the future, I hope that  Amazon will offer more documentaries of this caliber that relate to spiritual issues.

Having the chance to see this film in their local cinema would have made the trip there worthwhile by itself as it has been a cornerstone in my reflections about peace. The film has brought it home to me that forgiving other people and foremost myself makes life a good deal easier and enjoyable. You get so many different views on forgiveness (from the Amish - the least appealing to me when I first heard about the film - across women who lost their husbands, sons in 9-11 up to Thich Nhat Hanh, whose say in forgiveness can't be overrated) and you learn that forgiveness always has its starting point in forgiving yourself.

3036335,5,B000YVB2NO,This is a very powerful and moving film.  It is professionally well done but highly emotional and sad in parts. This is not a film for children!

3036336,5,B000YVB2NO,"I can't believe I didn't review this before.  This was really useful for our forgiveness study group. One segment at a time, we discussed the immediate and far-reaching implications. We were a group of six, the ""forgiveness team"" resulting from a seven-week study I had led at Shepherd of the Hill Presbyterian Church in Chaska, MN. For that study we had used  Wilma Derksen's little (and very effective) Bible-based study guide. We plan to use this DVD as the core of a one-day forgiveness workshop sometime in the Spring. Each segment is powerful in demonstrating one of the many facets of forgiveness. From my point of view, this DVD has the advantage of not being Bible-based and useful, therefore, for a much broader audience.",1228953600,15,731,4.887096774193548

3036339,3,B000YVB2NO,"It is very unfortunate that this worthy project has been marred by Elie Wiesel, a follower of the revenge-filled Talmud who has never acknowledged his relationship with the Irgun terrorists who massacred the Palestinian village of Deir Yassin or decried the slaughter in Deir Yassin in any way. Of the Germans, Wiesel wrote the terrible words (which he has never recanted): ""Every Jew, somewhere in his being, should set apart a zone of hate - healthy, virile hate - for what the German personifies and for what persists in the German."" (Wiesel, ""Legends of Our Time"" [1968]). How on earth the producers of this DVD were so ignorant of Wiesel's record as to hoax their own forgiveness project with his presence is beyond fathoming.",1207440000,22,731,4.903225806451613
3036340,5,B000YVB2NO,"What does it mean to forgive someone? How do you go about forgiving? Does it mean that we forgo justice? Is forgiving simply a spiritual experience between an individual and God or does it play out on many different levels? These and other questions are addressed in this look at forgiveness by filmmaker Martin Doblmeier (Bonhoeffer). It looks at real life examples of forgiveness such as the Amish in the wake of the killing of five Amish schoolgirls that ripped their community. It shows the speech Elie Weisel made to the German Bundestadt challenging them to ask forgiveness of the Jewish people and then two months later, the speech made to the Israeli Knesset by the President of Germany asking forgiveness on behalf of Germany. It looks at forgiveness on many different levels including the physical level and how forgiveness (or lack of it) affects us physically and shows examples of forgiveness being taught in elementary schools as well as being offered in colleges. It shows three women who lost loved ones in 9/11 who travel to Lebanon to experience the Garden of Forgiveness established by the Lebanese and wonder why there is so much opposition to establishing a Garden of Forgiveness on the WTC site. While many might want to limit forgiveness to a theological discussion (and it certainly is a major if not THE major theological doctrine), this film shows the power of forgiveness beyond just the theological implications and how our world could be different if forgiveness were taken seriously and practiced by everyone. At the very least, this should be a wonderful conversation starter for those serious about studying forgiveness. Think of the political ramifications if candidates running for office would stand up and ask forgiveness of their opponents when they say something in error or intentionally malign them or if corporate leaders would ask forgiveness of shareholders for the mistakes they made in the name of corporate profits and greed. Perhaps, like most things, it works best if it starts from the individual and community level and works upward. That means it starts with you and me. [...]",1206835200,56,2127,5.028328611898017

There is one forgiveness approach, the inclusion of which would make the documentary feel more complete for me, which is Radical Forgiveness, the work of Colin Tipping.  If you are looking for an overview or introduction to forgiveness, I don't believe you a video much better than this.  If you are wondering if there is real power in forgiveness, I believe, in this video, you will find evidence that there is.",1458000000,,1140,5.259668508287293

It is sad that it still has remains of loved ones there. And there is no memorial there to let this place be a sacred place for those who never recovered their loved ones. Not as much as a plaque or anything. I felt so bad for the one mother who was there and placed a bouquet of flowers into a very barren piece of land. She said ""my son is here someplace but who cares? No one. I have a son and tried to think what if that were my son?

Unforgiveness poisons individuals, groups, and even countries against one another. It is such an apt topic for our times, for all times.

The film has brought it home to me that forgiving other people and foremost myself makes life a good deal easier and enjoyable. You get so many different views on forgiveness (from the Amish - the least appealing to me when I first heard about the film - across women who lost their husbands, sons in 9-11 up to Thich Nhat Hanh, whose say in forgiveness can't be overrated) and you learn that forgiveness always has its starting point in forgiving yourself.

One segment at a time, we discussed the immediate and far-reaching implications. We were a group of six, the ""forgiveness team"" resulting from a seven-week study I had led at Shepherd of the Hill Presbyterian Church in Chaska, MN. For that study we had used  Wilma Derksen's little (and very effective) Bible-based study guide. We plan to use this DVD as the core of a one-day forgiveness workshop sometime in the Spring.

Of the Germans, Wiesel wrote the terrible words (which he has never recanted): ""Every Jew, somewhere in his being, should set apart a zone of hate - healthy, virile hate - for what the German personifies and for what persists in the German.""

3270837,5,B000YVB2NO,"What does it mean to forgive someone? How do you go about forgiving? Does it mean that we forgo justice? Is forgiving simply a spiritual experience between an individual and God or does it play out on many different levels? These and other questions are addressed in this look at forgiveness by filmmaker Martin Doblmeier (Bonhoeffer). It looks at real life examples of forgiveness such as the Amish in the wake of the killing of five Amish schoolgirls that ripped their community. It shows the speech Elie Weisel made to the German Bundestadt challenging them to ask forgiveness of the Jewish people and then two months later, the speech made to the Israeli Knesset by the President of Germany asking forgiveness on behalf of Germany. It looks at forgiveness on many different levels including the physical level and how forgiveness (or lack of it) affects us physically and shows examples of forgiveness being taught in elementary schools as well as being offered in colleges. It shows three women who lost loved ones in 9/11 who travel to Lebanon to experience the Garden of Forgiveness established by the Lebanese and wonder why there is so much opposition to establishing a Garden of Forgiveness on the WTC site. While many might want to limit forgiveness to a theological discussion (and it certainly is a major if not THE major theological doctrine), this film shows the power of forgiveness beyond just the theological implications and how our world could be different if forgiveness were taken seriously and practiced by everyone. At the very least, this should be a wonderful conversation starter for those serious about studying forgiveness. Think of the political ramifications if candidates running for office would stand up and ask forgiveness of their opponents when they say something in error or intentionally malign them or if corporate leaders would ask forgiveness of shareholders for the mistakes they made in the name of corporate profits and greed. Perhaps, like most things, it works best if it starts from the individual and community level and works upward. That means it starts with you and me. [...]",1206835200,56,2127,5.028328611898017
