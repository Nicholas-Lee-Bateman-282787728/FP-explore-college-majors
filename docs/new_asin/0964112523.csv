7795817,1,0964112523,"There are conditions along the lines of locked-in syndrome (Tony Nicklinson), Motor Neurone Disease (Diane Pretty) and PVS (as in the case of Terri Schiavo). Such incurable conditions often lead to unrelenting existential suffering that can only be ""palliated"" by placing the patient into a coma until they die ""naturally."" There is no moral difference between this and a swift exit.

He also seems to imply that DNR orders are also a threat to ""vulnerable"" patients (which is another example of banal paternalistic tyranny). Well, why isn't he campaigning for the right to refuse respirators and dialysis to be revoked? Because he is a hypocrite, plain and simple.

I will append my review of the EPC's film, Turning the Tide, to this review. I hope readers find it helpful.

I would like to begin by reminding all so-called pro-lifers that compassion does NOT mean to ""suffer with"" someone. The etymology of a word does not necessarily have anything to do with its modern meaning. In this case, especially. If suffering with sentient beings was actually sufficient, we would not even have Aspirin in the world today.

The emotional ploys touted in this documentary rely on ad-hoc justifications for opposing assisted dying. They love to cite cases of patients coming out of their suicidal depressions. Good for them. Doesn't mean everyone else should be forced to die naturally. And until they can ease the pain of the 25% of patients who rate THEIR OWN PAIN as ""moderate to severe"" when in a hospice, they have no right to claim the compassionate high ground.

In recent years, there has been a shift towards ""secular"" language in arguments against assisted dying. This pretense is entirely dispensed with in one of the DVD interviews, in which a well-fed, pompous individual (the CEO of Salt and Light Productions) entreats everyone to suffer and die naturally, while gorging himself on the largess of his flock. To me personally, this was the most revolting, callous and arrogant part of this ""documentary."" It trivialises suffering and discourages further developments in analgesia.

For the case against assisted dying to carry any weight, those who oppose patient autonomy at the end of life need to present a case that everyone should be forced to die naturally. Their emotional arguments may pull a few individuals to eschew painkillers and elect for a natural exit, but this doesn't logically extend into mandating a natural death for everyone else. The only secular case would be to prevent abuse, which is quite difficult to justify, especially since peer-reviewed studies show that countries (such as Australia) with totalitarian laws against assisted dying have more abuses because of a loophole substantial enough to fly the US military air force through (I am referring, of course, to the doctrine of double effect and terminal sedation). What could be easier to abuse than the double effect doctine, which focuses on the intentions of doctors and nurses, while completely ignoring what the PATIENT wants for him or herself? When it comes to end-of-life care, I would rather die as the victim of a random back-alley stabbing than go into a hospice. At least then I would be guaranteed a quicker and more pain-free death.
