8514013,5,B007BOCCMC,"This movie was actually called A PORNSTAR IS BORN.  I loved it.  It was about a beautiful young girl who moves to Hollywood to become a star.  She can't find an acting job so you ends up working for a production company that does adult movies.  She ends up dating one of the porn stars and falls in love.

She ends up a major porn star and the guy she's dating ends up destroying his career through drugs.  She tries to save him and also tries to continue her dream of becoming a Hollywood Star.

The movie was very shocking and shows the inner workings of the adult business.  At the same time it is a nice romantic drama about their relationship.  Overall a great movie.",1358208000,,672,4.26984126984127
8514014,3,B007BOCCMC,"This is another mystery wrapped in an enigma - another Escher staircase of a drama that, after your climb, seems to land you impossibly where you started. So ""Mysteria"" isn't for viewers who like resolution.

But there's good acting here and arresting visuals. This movie also invites conjecture. Why does the lead character seem to exist in a 1940's noir world, chain-smoking in his seedy hotel room furnished with an old black dial phone? Meanwhile, there's a whole modern world outside, with cell phones and late model cars.

Is the scriptwriter dreaming the grisly murders? Are they part of the script he's writing? Or are they all too real? You might want to check out this movie and decide for yourself.",1350345600,,709,4.851239669421488
