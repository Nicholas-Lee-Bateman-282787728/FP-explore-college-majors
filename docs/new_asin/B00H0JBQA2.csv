6126574,4,B00H0JBQA2,"""Doom"" is a very underrated game adapted movie. At 1st I thought the movie was ok at best, then after watching it again its not bad. It's certainly better than any of the uwe boll game films. Most of the movie does follow the doom game premise even though hollywood adds it's own twists!",1389225600,,287,4.333333333333333
6126575,5,B00H0JBQA2,"Love this Movie!!!  It has action, dark comedy and Dwayne the Rock Johnson... What's not to love!!! I would recommend this to friends..",1375142400,,135,4.869565217391305
6126576,5,B00H0JBQA2,The sole reason for me buying this movie is because I am a collector. The product arrived on time and in great condition. I did not open the package... simply added it to my other Steelbox movies. If you are a fellow collector... I would not hesitate to recommend this Steelcase movie for your collection.,1371772800,,305,4.5636363636363635
6126577,5,B00H0JBQA2,"I don't know what all the fuss is about, but I had a great time sneaking into ""Doom"" during its theatrical release in 2005, and, to this day, enjoy it fairly regularly as part of my action genre movies of choice.

""Doom"" is, and will always be, one of my most adored action movie guilty pleasures. It is a great ""bad"" action film: it's got tons of bullets that fly, as they are won't to do in these types of movies, it's got a great lead male duo--Dwayne Johnson and Karl ""Dredd"" Urban, two hardened action veterans at this point--it's got plenty of blood and ghastly gore effects, and finally, it's got a superb female co-lead, the absolutely stunning Rosamund Pike.

I'd write more but this isn't the sort of film that lends itself to my writing more about it. It's ""Doom""; it's got action and gore and more and more.

What more do you want? ""Doom"" satisfies on every level it promises to, and while it is not a great film, it is a good one, and that is no small achievement.

5/5",1369008000,13,982,4.320652173913044
6126578,1,B00H0JBQA2,"I saw this movie in theaters and I was one of 4 people in the theater opening week. It didn't last past that. I loved the video game and I wanted to see just how bad that would actually make a movie based on the following premise: A lab facility on Mars is working on experimental gene mutations to create super soldiers but (wait for it) an accident happens and (wait for it...) the virus escapes. All of those poor lab technicians, graduate students, doctors, engineers, food workers, ney everyone in the whole facility, is transformed into super killing alien soldier things which must be slaughtered with enormous weapons including (yes wait for it) the BFG9000. This movie is terrible. It is barely watchable and is worthy of only MST3K. Watch it for a laugh or for a fantastic performance by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. There is only one way to possibly describe his performance as epicly bad. You could not pay me to watch this again without a rif track.

If you want a movie exactly like this but better, Resident Evil is the way to go. Even that wasn't a great movie but it is leaps and bounds better than DOOM.",1368057600,6,1119,4.512315270935961
6126579,1,B00H0JBQA2,"For the record, I have never played ""Doom."" Pretty much everything I know about the original video game came from wikipedia.

And yet, even I know what that the movie ""Doom"" doesn't have a lot in common with its source material. But even taken on its own, this movie is kind of a mess -- Karl Urban is one of the few bright spots in an ugly, dragging story that seems to be taking cues from ""Resident Evil."" By the time it grinds to its predictable ending, you'll wish someone would pick up the BFG and shoot the camera.

When a research facility on Mars suddenly goes quiet, a squad of space marines are sent in, led by Sarge (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson). The goal is to neutralize the threat and allow Dr. Samantha Grimm (Rosamund Pike) to recover the genetic data the scientists left behind -- which doesn't sit well with her brother John aka ""Reaper"" (Karl Urban) who happens to be on the team.

But things go dramatically wrong right away -- the scientists have gone mad, mutated and/or transformed into grotesque creatures. And in true horror movie style, they immediately begin picking off the marines one by one. As Samantha tries to unravel the secret of the extra chromosomes that caused this disaster, Reaper finds that the biggest threat may be from his own team.

Andrzej Bartkowiak is one of those directors who just does everything wrong whenever somebody lets him sit in a director's chair -- and he has a special talent for ruining preexisting franchises. Right from the beginning, ""Doom"" is depressingly mediocre, with a lurching, sludgy pace that tries to use jump scares and graphic gore to distract you.

Not that I could see half of the jump scares and gore, because Andrzej Bartkowiak apparently decided to save money by never turning on the lights. Perhaps he means for this to be symbolic, especially given the amount of clunky hell/devil/demon references he sprinkles in there... but I suspect it has more to do with really bad direction.

But the script is even worse. Movie science tends to be unrealistic at best, but this one introduces a pair of extra chromosomes that give superstrength, super-healing and super-intelligence... instead of, you know, massive birth defects. The most ridiculous part is when we're told that THERE IS A GENE FOR EVIL.

It doesn't help that not a single character in this movie is likable. Karl Urban gives a fairly decent performance as the suitably-named Grimm, but his character is still bossy and humorless. Most of the others are either faceless cannon fodder or despicable jerks. We have a drug-addled teenager, a lecherous pedophile, and the charmingly nondescript Rock (whose character only acquires a personality near the end... and it's a hammy one).

""Doom"" pretty much describes itself with that title -- a doomed movie that Bartkowiak hammered into the ground in every artistic way. Time for a reboot with someone competent!",1365206400,,2897,4.850202429149798
6126580,3,B00H0JBQA2,"I expected this set to be a typical blu-ray combo set (1 case, with 2 discs inside). That was a copy of the Doom DVD in its original case and another copy of the Doom blu-ray in its own case. If I had known this, I would have just purchased the Blu-ray and DVD separately, as they cost less than this ""combo pack"". Had to buy a separate 2-disc case on eBay so that this wouldn't waste space on my movie shelf. Bottom line-- If you want a combo pack, buy these separately because they're cheaper and the same thing you'll get if you purchase this.",1307923200,,546,4.160377358490566
6126581,5,B00H0JBQA2,"Funny, 5 years later... I really liked it! I hated Doom when it first came out. The plot was very different from the game, and not better, it had ""The Rock,"" the next Hulk Hogan wannabee as a main actor... and just wasn't what I expected, so I was disappointed.
So I just popped it back in years later... and enjoyed every minute. It's actually a pretty decent movie in it's own right. The plot, while different, is pretty good, the effects well done, excellent sets and I don't have the same problem with The Rock as I did back then.
Some movies, like The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Van Helsing and Doom, are much better once you get over the ""they weren't what I was expecting or what I wanted"" disappointment.
So give it another try... and enjoy.",1263859200,8,757,4.453237410071942

8629042,5,B00H0JBQA2,"I'm starting up a nice little collection of these comic style steelbooks and my only complaint is the extremely limited library.

First, this is a Universal exclusive. Other companies make steelbooks, but the comic book cover style is exclusively Universal.
Second, Universal didn't release that many of their movies in this format. So your options are limited. Personally, I think this style is perfect for comic book movies (go figure) but also cult classics like Hot Fuzz or Blues Brothers. I think there's even a Big Lebowski one.

Other than that, the movie itself is great. I saw this when it first came out and, while it wasn't exactly what I was expecting, it was still fun. You have to know what you're getting going into it though.

For starters, the whole movie isn't First Person like the game or many of the trailers, that's about a 3-4 minute scene. Second, it's not an epic blockbuster. It's just a fun, sci-fi shoot-em-up. And honestly, that's ok with me.

It's a lot better than most of the Rock's movies largely due to the fact that Karl Urban consumes much of the spotlight in this movie.

Closest comparisons I can think of would be Resident Evil (the first one) and Dredd (the action not the story)

Bottom line, if you're in the mood for a lazy afternoon watching space marines shooting aliens then this is your movie.",1432166400,,1340,4.680851063829787
8629043,5,B00H0JBQA2,"As someone who grew up with the games (both PC and console), the movie was nothing like that. At all. But it was still a fun ride. I really did enjoy watching, though I do wish they'd delved more into why it was Reaper was to stay behind initially.  Yes, I read the book. I know why. But to people watching the movie, they really have no clue.

Another cult classic. It's cheesy, it's uber violent, it's awesome.  This is a perfect Saturday night movie because it's not gonna ruin the rest of your day.  Love it. You know you want to",1427846400,,533,4.196078431372549
