8106978,5,162890769X,"To start off, I have always been fascinated with the piano, primarily church piano -- I just love the lush sounds it provides. With that said, I taught myself some piano before taking formal lessons a couple of years ago. Let me just say there is A LOT to learn on the piano. With regards to theory, in my current piano lessons, I just study theory on the side and then clarify with my instructor. About a year ago, I even purchased a music theory course -- however, I was unable to finish it because I lost interest (although I got through half of it). Now, moving onto the first foundational course of the series: Theory for Church Pianist.

Greg does a good job of presenting enough (theory) information and then providing lessons (in a workbook/study guide that corresponds with the lesson). This works for me because it gives me a structure and a routine. I don't really find courses that just disseminate information particularly useful and motivating. The lessons are concise enough but packed with very good information. You have to get down to the nitty gritty and work on some things -- for example, having to write out triads, having to write out 4 note chords, having to find color notes in certain keys, etc. With that said, one of the only pitfalls was I did find a discrepancy with the answers for the ""diatonic 4-chord"" checkpoint answers (in the workbook); however, upon watching the dvd (where he also goes over the answers), he talks the reader through the correct answer -- so although there was a moment of confusion and panic, those feelings were resolved when I popped in the dvd (to that particular section) -- as he provides an answer key (in the study guide) but also goes over the answers on the dvd.

Overall, I feel that these may be advanced concepts, but Greg does a good job of presenting this theory in a way that is inviting to the student and he does have a knack for being able to progress the students through these concepts. I am currently working on going over the Circle of Fifths in all 12 keys ... although it is a cumbersome task, I am motivated to do so ... and Greg has a huge role in that! I believe this course will provide a good foundation for the types of things I want to learn on the piano. And it is important that I stay diligent ... as there are more dvds I can't wait to work on in the series! But just taking it one step at a time!",1394496000,,2388,4.400452488687783
8106979,5,162890769X,"I went through this entire course about a year ago and am getting ready to go through it again and see what else I can pick up. I was a good classical pianist and competent in basic diatonic harmony, but had no formal training in theory and found even the apparently most basic introductions to advanced harmony to be incomprehensible. The format of this course, the well defined topics and progression, the informal discussion, the examples and the exercises provide just enough of the missing clues I needed to start 'getting' the structure of the music I had always been playing that had previously seemed just arbitrary. My playing immediately became enormously richer and I am still working on being able to proficiently apply many of the ideas. I was also able to finally start making headway with some Jazz harmony books that had long defeated me.

One important practical lesson was the importance of building a competent but unconscious knowledge of the basic before being able to build on it. The assignment for lesson 1 is basically 'learn the major and minor scales in all keys'. You will get much more out of these lesson if you do so, and likewise for learn of the 7th chords cold, .... The importance of voicings and the ideas for choosing them was also a revelation.

The material is very well produced, though there are some rough edges, some videos could have used more editing, and there were some discrepancies between things in some videos and the corresponding exercises. I would also have liked almost complete transcriptions of everything that was played. Some of the illustration that were played we hard to follow or untangle or appreciate even with the live virtual keyboard. I would also have really liked some specific suggestions about where to move on from various topics, what is a good reference for classical functional harmony, what are some more songs that illustrate this kind of transition or re-harmonization, ...? Finally I could have used more applications or analysis of harmony as used in more contemporary popular songs.

I do play in church and came across this through that, but I haven't now found any similar sort of program that covers the breadth of topics so completely and coherently and presented so well. So while there are some church specific topics (hymns, stride,...) this material is really very general and I can recommend it to anyway needing some help over the hump from basic competence to a deeper understanding in the hope of becoming a more inspired player.",1390348800,2,2523,4.876456876456876
8106980,5,162890769X,I read music but because I had never learned how to chord I had been chained to my music books and it was difficult to keep practiced on all the pieces I need to play.  This is the way to freedom--thanks for thoroughly covering all I will ever need to be an accomplished church pianist.,1390176000,2,286,4.2
8106981,5,162890769X,"What I appreciate most about Greg is his teaching on theory, and even more importantly, how to use the theory.  He gives you the foundation you need to go anywhere you want to with your music, unlike some teachers who show you how to play a few songs, but by the time you get home you can't remember what they told you to do.  It has helped me to be able to take ideas I hear and use them in my own music, or to be able to make my own arrangements.",1390003200,,448,3.858695652173913
8106982,5,162890769X,"I was so excited when my parents purchased the Complete Set of Church Pianist Courses by Greg Howlett. For me, as a 16-year-old early-advanced pianist, I was looking for something that would challenge me at my current level without necessarily taking the college route. I showed this set to my piano teacher, and she said it was the first time she had seen someone so thoroughly explain the concepts and principles that church pianists use when accompanying. I really appreciate how Greg Howlett explains the ""why"" of piano playing, giving you practical advice which you can apply to your own music.",1389916800,2,599,4.9405940594059405
8106983,5,162890769X,"I have worked through about a third of the Complete Set of Church Pianist Courses by Greg Howlett and have thoroughly enjoyed and understood each concept taught! It is very organized and not confusing at all.  The homework is very helpful in solidifying what was taught in the previous section. I have learned very much so far on becoming a better church pianist and can't wait to finish the course!

8106984,5,162890769X,I bought Greg Howlett's whole sets of instructional DVDs last year. I have studied half of them and it has been a great and rewarding lesson. I live in Indonesia and so I had the softcopy version .mp4 downloaded to my laptop. It has Greg's live teaching on that DVD and I feel that he's very easy to understand although sometimes the subject itself is not that easy. But I improve a lot by learning his DVDs and thus better serve the church I'm accompanying :) Praise the Lord!,1389657600,,477,4.370786516853933
