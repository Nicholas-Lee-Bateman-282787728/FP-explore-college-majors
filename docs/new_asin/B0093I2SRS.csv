5256045,1,B0093I2SRS,"this movie sucks....nothing is credible, the actors have no idea what ""acting"" might look like...we have a bunch of nineties cutie poster boys and girls, lipping lines...pathetic!  Bad bad bad....save your money...I'm really pissed I rented this.  Plus, none of the ""photo-shopping"" looks remotely real, and I guess the director thinks women are totally stupid and giggly, no matter their title and position...save yourself the offense and insult...Do Not Rent this Movie!!!",1354579200,2,474,5.569444444444445
5256046,3,B0093I2SRS,"When a colossal tectonic shift causes the sea level to start rising, a microbiologist gathers the DNA of as many species as she can, all while the military creates an ""ark"" in a desperate attempt to preserve life on Earth and time is running out.

40 Days and Nights, I have to admit, is a pretty decent movie despite its' premise and execution. Cheap CGI aside, it's boatloads better than Super Cyclone was(sadly, that one reeked). Least, these people can act and none of the actors/actresses in this movie are well known(which is more than I can say for the aforementioned). None that I know of, anyhow.

It's definitely worth a rental or even a purchase(providing you can find it for a ten spot or less). I, personally, thought it was an okay movie myself. As I've stated before, I've seen far far far worser movies. The Asylum does put out good movies..when it wants to.

5256055,1,B0093I2SRS,"The great flood is coming, but no one knows.  It is a secret.  It starts with the Sahara Desert becoming an ocean.  Of course, no one knows this is an extinction event.  It is punctuated with a microbiologist desperately trying to get her DNA samples, and the secret building of an ark in a government installation.

Bad acting, bad special effects/ CGI, unrealistic scenes of building an ark, and bad science is the basis for this total flop.  Sadly, these people have never seen a shipyard.

I almost fell over when they showed a funky turbine and the sound of riveting when building the ark.  Not a single crane was present, and there wasn't a welder to be seen.

And the DNA canisters couldn't be found for the bees, but luckily they came up with some bee corpses.  Ugh!",1387152000,,774,4.503597122302159
5256056,2,B0093I2SRS,"""40 Days and Nights"" was a little better than ""500 MPH Storm"", but it was still pretty bad. After reading about the plot it sounded interesting but there was too little focus on the ark and too much on the same old about people trying to outrun bad cgi effects to get to the safety of the ark. Unfortunately, it also doesn't have even one well known actor in it.

So ""40 Days and Nights"" is pretty bad but not terrible. Not really worth wasting money on.",1383350400,,454,4.218390804597701
5256057,3,B0093I2SRS,"This movie seems to be sort of a knock off of '2012' and a few others. The acting is ok, special effects, ok (could be better)and it's obviously not a big budget production.

5256059,1,B0093I2SRS,"This movie is so bad it is hard to write a review. I don't know where to start. First off Amazon should be ashamed to have it in thier.
 inventory and charge 4.99 for HD version.
The casting: terrible no one looked or acted or was believable in thier character.
The whole movie built around animation which was completely unbelievable.
The science had no believable elements, which is a nessecary in a Sci Fy Flick.
All in all I could not watch it much passed the middle. They lost me the first time the female seal called a C130 (an LM130) she was wholly unbelievable as a Navy seal in her actions and mannerisms, as was all the military people and procedures.

I wish I could get my money back but the trailer was very decieving and I fell for thier Con Job. Amazon really needs to review these less than grade ""B' movies and only offer legitimate coherent movies and punish bad offerings by not carrying them.",1379116800,4,912,4.4226190476190474

5256066,5,B0093I2SRS,"I just finished watching 40 Days and Nights. I was skeptical at first, as all the reviewers have been incredibly negative. However, much likes sports, where everyone thinks they know better but none of them are actual professional athletes, this movie defied expectations and pleasantly surprised me at every turn. We begin in the Sahara, with some fun loving teens driving around in a jeep. This scene showed the majesty and beauty of the desert. It was a powerful scene featuring what I can only consider future stars of cinema taking their first leap into mainstream movies. After the oceans come crashing down over the tree-lined Sahara mountains, we cut to a massive top-secret military base hidden in plain sight in a mountain valley in what appears to be Colorado. Here, the tension really starts to ramp up as an intrepid and brave team of the military's finest are determined to finish the build out of an ark that will save humanity. Designed to carry 50,000 plus people, this ship appears to have the finest technology that our military has been able to gather. After a particularly harrowing scene in the Florida Keys shows a poor 4Runner getting washed to sea, we cut back to Colorado to discover that a train carrying water bottles filled with specimens of moths (which will save humanity) has been blocked by a tunnel collapse. So, the Navy's finest Seal is sent in to rescue the moths. Once she arms herself with one handgun in her pant waist, this skilled SEAL takes the brave doctor to collect the moth specimens. At this point, the tension is truly building and I can feel the epic nature of this movie weighing heavily on my soul. I began to ask myself the deep existential questions a movie of this caliber would bring out in me. I liken it to Philadelphia or Lawrence of Arabia in gravitas. Powerful imagery soon followed as our hero doctor and SEAL found a cave with bees that would also rescue humanity. The harrowing scene in which they lose their C130 pilots and escape the crushing water was amazing. People may complain that the plane appeared to land on a rocky outcropping and took off almost vertically, but I believe that this was secret technology that gave this C130 vertical take-off capability. While it appeared that all was lost, the brave SEAL managed to secure three bees in her pocket, which would no doubt make the difference for humanity.

At the same time, another scientist was seeking a power source from a buoy in Illinois. This powerful and highly theoretical piece of military hardware was stored in a shipyard guarded by the American military, but possibly a rogue branch that knew that they had a rare power source that could fit inside a kettle bell. Someone foolishly suggested it was a grapefruit, but having read many online articles and read several comics and knowing that Iron Man can rocket in his suit with some glowing chest piece, I felt that this was entirely plausible. This experimental power source was going to power one of two experimental turbines to power a million ton ship. I am going to save you all a lot of the smaller details. Needless to say this is a love story during the end of days and this movie delivers on both the thrills and excitement. As I watched this movie in slack-jawed awe, I thought to some of the performances I had seen from the greats - Daniel Day Lewis, Tom Hanks, Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, Jamie Foxx, Carrot Top, Kermit the Frog, and thought that these actors deserved to be right up there with them. I realized that a script is only as good as you make it and that these powerful performances added something to this script that literally created cinematic magic. The special effects in this movie rivaled the work coming from ILM or WETA. I think I read that Peter Jackson was even considering hiring the SFX team behind this movie. You will have your naysayers, but trust me when I say that this movie will inspire you to do great things. I cannot recommend this movie highly enough and I can hardly wait for the extended edition blu-ray.",1367798400,6,4041,4.667601683029453
5256067,1,B0093I2SRS,"I rented this video and GOOFED BAD! Let me say there is a BIG difference between this "" 40 days and nights'"" and the movie I wanted ""40 days and 40 nights"". I turned it off after a short time, but came back, for some reason, and waited for the ""its about time"" ending. Ignoring the illogical SiFi link, the story was not only improbable, illogical, ill causing, ""illy"" written, directed, acted and when the illogical ending occurred it would be illogical for them to survive (they failed to saving inserts and honey bees),and had few plants and almost no animals.  I liked the three block long ship (holding 1000's of people"" bobbing up and down some 20 or 30 feet (given the scale) and everyone walked normal, unless you count hitting a mountain and having it produce a small bump that make them hang on to their chairs. And the 12"" rock that the ship was hung up on ""barely"", then being blowed up by a mystery chemical mixture, and the captain moving the ""shift lever"" from forward to reverse 6 times was really awe inspiringly stupid.  The time warp scene changes were really bad, planes taking off without a run way, dayschanging about 5 minutes apart, 1000's of ""relatives from St Louis"" being represented by 10 or 12 ""actors?"" they could afford to hire and illogically and effectively killing one of the two persons that could fix and install the ""miracle"" power generator the size of a small end table, seemed dumb because he told his girl friend there was a terrible storm coming. YAA REALLY? I could list a lot of other bad things but will end on perhaps the only positive note. That being a 5' heroine (Tessa ""played by"" Monaca Keena..I think) who they kept in tight wet fitting T-shirts who must have been standing in a cold breeze given the view it repeatedly advertised. Sorry for adding that, and forgive me I am not a male chauvinist pig...honest. DO NOT RENT THIS VIDEO, GIVE IF TO SOMEONE YOU DISLIKE AS A PRESENT.",1365033600,6,1931,4.545977011494253
5256068,3,B0093I2SRS,"Most reviewers gave 40 DAYS AND NIGHTS one star, but I shall be slightly more generous. True, the acting,scripting, FX, and pacing were cellar dwelling, but occasionally the theme of a film emerges to pick up one's interest if one is previously inclined as I was to get involved. The end of the world via a biblically based deluge had been done recently in 2012, but 40 DAYS AND NIGHTS pushes the viewer to see the human race under a cyclical lens. Most of the characters were interested more or less in saving humanity and their desire to save a selected few reduced what otherwise would have been pointless drivel. I was reminded of the 50's disaster film WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE in that both dealt with the morality of choosing a few to live from unsuspecting billions with no chance. Do I recommend 40 DAYS AND NIGHTS? Yes, but only to those who prefer their scyfy mixed with a bit of Genesis.",1364688000,,893,4.518518518518518
5256069,1,B0093I2SRS,"Ok, maybe not the worst, but in the bottom 5. No reason to write this review since it's pretty clear from other reviews just how bad it is. Plus, while I lasted longer than the reviewer who turned it off after 20 minutes, I only lasted 10 minutes longer, so this is only a review of the first 30 minutes. A shot of dark gray ominous clouds overhead, and then our heroes running around in sunshine with some blue sky and puffy white clouds in the background. And the effects were horrific. I'm sure the helicopters were toys, poorly reproduced to be life-sized.  The ""John"" character was familiar and his acting credible; otherwise the acting was amateur.

5256072,1,B0093I2SRS,"This movie was a complete waste of the $5 rental fee.

The only reason I had even an inkling of what was happening in the movie, is because The synopsis Stated that an earthquake caused the ocean levels to rise.

The movie itself gave no indication as to why the seas were enveloping the land masses. The only thing it really said was that something happened 2 1/2 years ago & they were supposed to have 3 years to build a series of arcs before the great flood hit.

No reason was given why the timetable had suddenly accelerated.

I found that what ""LITTLE"" plot the movie had was extremely disjointed. It also had a lot of continuity problems.  An example is in one shot the obviously fake torrential rains were inundating the deck of the ship. The very next scene showed the actors on the deck of the ship with a little wind, no rain & a hint of sunshine bleeding through into the scene. The very next scene was back again to the rain drenched deck of the ship.  What The ?????

I  found the cgi extremely fake looking.  The acting ( i use this term lightly ) was pathetic.

95% of the b level disaster flicks on the sci fi channel have better cgi, acting, & plot twists.

I wish there was a way to rate with neg. star ratings. I'd give this one a minus 3.

This is the type of movie that you & a group of freinds should watch this movie some Fri. night while imbibing your favorite spirts, & Just make fun of all the horrendous(pathetic) mistakes are in the film.

5256077,1,B0093I2SRS,"Once again The Asylum Home Entertainment has conned me into buying an utter piece of garbage. I should have been checking before buying, but now I will be actively avoiding anything with their name on the back cover.

How was the movie you ask? The plot was... Wait? Was there a plot? Oh ya, Water, like lots of it. Why? None of the actors seem to know or care! It just keeps raining for no good reason. It's pretty clear that no adults were given access to the script before shooting began.

And oh, we just so happen to have this big, phallic, really poorly designed & built boat. The boat. Lets talk about the boat, shall we. Giant boat. Check. 50,000 people capacity. Check. No way to generate power. Check. Wait, What?  That's right, no way to generate power, except these two tiny turbine things that run on dinky power generators designed for buoys. Designed for Small buoys. Really small buoys. The buoy they jacked it from was like 3 feet across. The generator itself is about the size of a grapefruit. Megawatts? Kilowatts? Watts? I'd be surprised if one of these things could power much more than a 12v light bulb. The characters are then SHOCKED when this truly poor arrangement fails to power the GIANT boat. So they proceed to pull poorly designed  sails out of their collective ass. (no, the sails don't save the day ether) As the lousy captain reports from his lousy, tiny, dirty?, bridge. (the ship is new, and I assume cost many tens of dollars to construct. why does the tiny bridge look so crappy & beat up?)

Now, lets talk about the acting a bit. The character interaction was forced and unrealistic. I never got the sense that any one character really cared if the others lived or died. They just kept kinda plugging along. Screwing up one thing after another. I don't blame the actors. They were just trying to muddle through the crap they were given and trying to get a paycheck. I put the blame entirely on the writers. And the producers for not beating the living hell out of the writers.

And then we get to the ""special"" effects guys. To them I give many kudos and much high acclaim for using tech that is at least 10 years out of date and with few exceptions, for generally sucking out loud. Oh, and reusing cheaply obtained footage of idiots in a jeep. W.T.F.? Oh, and for having pouring rain scenes with heavy rain in the foreground - not dripping, but damp actors in frame, and more heavy rain in the background. (how did you manage that?) And do helicopters have doors where you come from? Do people use them when its raining or if they might loose valuable stuff while flying around? (I understand that in addition to helicopters, the military has access to small bits of rope and or carabiner clips. you might want to look into that) And before I forget, DNA samples stored in empty non frozen, crappy disposable water bottles? Those scenes look like they were shot in the empty back room of another film crews set. Using the trash from the set.

It's kind of cool to know that there are still low budget movies being shot. And I would have forgiven almost everything in this movie if they had just done some more work on the plot. And fact checked the science, just a little. And addressed a couple of the other half dozen or so major problems that this film had.
