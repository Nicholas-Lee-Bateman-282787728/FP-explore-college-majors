8167141,2,B000M8HH3I,Not very interesting. Boring in fact. Donated it to the DAV. Don't recomend it to anyone if they like westerns,1367452800,,110,4.55
8167142,4,B000M8HH3I,"Haven't watched it yet, but all is as it was said to be.  We look forward to watching it.  My husband was surprised.",1326067200,,116,4.0
8167143,3,B000M8HH3I,"Dead For A Dollar:
not Clint Eastwood and my version stops in the middle.
Cain's Cutthroat's:
A little sexy with it's rape scene and my disk had bad spots.
Massacre at Fort Holman:
Probably the one that makes the others worth while. A well
acted movie that must of missed at the box office.
Hot Lead:
The fake eye lashes in the female lead (who deservedly isn't
mentioned on the cover) put me off this one. A really faked up cattleman's range war...with an all star cast who should have known better.
Three of these movies could have killed the western for all time...",1184025600,,568,4.471153846153846
