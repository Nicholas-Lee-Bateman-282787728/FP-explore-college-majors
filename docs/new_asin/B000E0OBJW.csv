2477098,5,B000E0OBJW,"Hello Everyone,
First of all let me tell you that I haven't finished watching all 25 discs. So far I have watched 8, UFO's and Strange Legends. I am very pleased. If I would have to give a con about this collection is that the stories are very old, some back in the 1800's and the newer stories are around 1992. Considering that I was born in the year 1990. I kind of have some thirst for more recent stories, something like 2000's and up. Anyways since neither Unsolved Mysteries nor Beyond Belief have came back for new seasons with newer stories I guess we don't have a choice but to wait. In any event Im very satisfied with my purchase and remember: Even if you don't like it you can always sell them on ebay for $10 a pop, do the math!",1224460800,7,741,4.188811188811189
2477099,5,B000E0OBJW,"Unsolved Mysteries really turns me on! It's easy to not have faith in tv, especially when most of it is mindless drivel, but this kind of show still does it for me. I love to watch it alone, in a darkened room, in the middle of the night. Erotic.",1221004800,6,246,4.040816326530612

2477101,5,B000E0OBJW,"I remember watching this show with joy when i was a kid and upon seeing the release of this best of boxset purchased the product, not sure if my childhood enjoyment perhaps had changed in the years between viewings.  Well i can gladly say that this show still remains the benchmark for murder/mystery type shows everywhere. I highly recommend the strange legends and bizarre murders best of sections which contain some of the best creepy and intriguing material.  Robert Stack lends the show his trademark stoicism and presents the stories with style and dignity.  Perhaps one of the best things about Unsolved Mysteries is that when compared to other similar style shows, the re enactments stand head and shoulders above the rest.  In most cases the actors are believable and the costumes and music well placed and authentic.  I highly recommend this show for lovers of mystery and the paranormal everywhere.  You never know, this show may even change your opinions on some famous mysteries like it did for me on the episode which argued that Billy the Kid did not die at the hands of Pat Garrett.  This boxset is the best way to purchase  as it compiles the greatest episodes together all for one fantastic price (considering the 25 discs on offer). Sit back and enjoy weeks of enjoyment. Why don't they make shows like this anymore?",1218326400,7,1335,4.799126637554585

2477103,5,B000E0OBJW,"I freakin love Unsolved mysteries. I loved it when I was 9 years old and not much has changed. Some segments are still scarrier than 99.9% of the horror movies put out in the US over the last 20 years. The early episodes (89'-93') are a bit better then the later ones, that said there is alot to admire about the stuff they kept putting out. I think the combination of perfectly creepy music and the inflection of Robert Stacks voice is what makes these segments so chilling. The early episodes are also aided by the film stock they were shot on which gives the images a much more mirky, ghostly tone. Anyhow buy this set or at the very least rent them from netflix. All hail the Unsolved!",1203724800,32,689,4.348837209302325

2477105,5,B000E0OBJW,"I want to start by stating that I own A LOT of tv shows on DVD.  This collection is my favorite out of all of them!  I can sit and watch these for hours and never get tired of watching.  I think the charm of ""Unsolved Mysteries"" lies in it's host...Robert Stack.  He sets the mood for every story.  The set itself is put together very well.  It covers all of the DVD's that were released on their own and an added feature of 5 new Ghost Stories and 5 Lost Treasure Stories.  If you loved ""Unsolved Mysteries"" then this is the ultimate collection for you!  I only hope that they release more someday!",1173916800,52,599,4.192982456140351
2477106,5,B000E0OBJW,"I always loved this show, even when the broadcast schedule became erratic after 1997 and I had to chase it all over the schedule and from network to network. Robert Stack - Elliot Ness himself - was the definitive host, and is irreplacable in the role he had. There were really two forces at work here that made the show a success. First, the producers of the show didn't put every backwoods legend that came across their desks on the air. They tried to document events and stories that could have happened. Second, Robert Stack was a great host, his trenchcoat-clad presence and dignified and sincere narration bringing respectability to each segment. Thus, no matter how fantastic something might appear on paper, it was presented as something that a rational person could believe was possible. Here is a brief synopsis of the 25-disc set:

""Unsolved Mysteries: UFOs"" - Explores some fascinating extraterrestrial encounters with this segments that includes episodes devoted to alien abductions, crop circles, and the controversy surrounding Roswell and Area 51. A tribute to Robert Stack is included here. 6 hrs. on four discs.

""Unsolved Mysteries: Ghosts"" - The world of the paranormal is the subject of this collection.  There's a friendly ghost (not Casper), a matchmaker ghost, a court case with new homeowners suing old homeowners because they weren't told the house was haunted, and other assorted ghost tales. 6 hrs. on four discs.

""Unsolved Mysteries: Miracles"" - Divine influence and angelic interventions are examined in a series of episodes that cover everything from inexplicably answered prayers, to alternative medicines, to religious visions. Not really as interesting as the others, because miracles always imply something good happens for no known reason. 6 hrs. on four discs.

""Unsolved Mysteries: Psychics"" - Accounts of ESP, fortune telling, past-life regression, strange seers, and other tales of mental magic. The more interesting segments involve psychics helping the police solve crimes. 6 hrs. on four discs.

""Unsolved Mysteries: Bizarre Murders"" - Focuses on some of the most notorious murders in history. Examines such infamous criminals as the Boston Strangler and the Zodiac Killer, as well as a woman possibly killed by one of her own alternate personalities, and the psychology behind well-known homicidal world leaders are among the segments in this set. 6 1/4 hrs. on four discs.

""Unsolved Mysteries: Strange Legends"" - Investigates Bigfoot, what happened to famed skyjacker D.B. Cooper, skunk apes, and other such matters. Also includes segments on the legend of the Mothman, the fate of Amelia Earhart, the death of ""Adventures of Superman"" star George Reeves, and the strange legacy of the Bermuda Triangle. 6 hrs. on four discs.

""Unsolved Mysteries: Hidden Treasure"" examining tales of lost fortune. 1 disc.

The first six DVD-sets that are part of this release have been previously released separately. The ""Hidden Treasure"" disc appears to be new material.",1169424000,136,3003,5.278825995807128
2477107,5,B000E0OBJW,"Great Series, many episodes just too short.",1435017600,3,43,5.285714285714286
2477108,5,B000E0OBJW,"This was one of the absolute best shows of the 80's & 90's I can remember.  Everything about this series I loved, the late Robert Stack & later the late Dennis Ferrena had hosted this series along with it's reboot on Lifetime Network.

 They have taken out some of the best elements and episodes from this series and made them into specialized DVD boxed sets, including the UFO-Aliens episodes, the very freaky & eerie ghost episodes, and one of my favorites the violent crime mystery episodes.

 The late Robert Stack was an amazing man (star of the 1950's Untouchables & the 80's Transformers the Movie), and fine actor who represented a lot of class & deep insight.  This was the ONLY tv show I can ever remember that truly freaked me out and brought some chills into me as a youth, not only with the show's theme song but the strange some times other worldly cases.

 The ghost stories alone were incredibly scary, especially this one story that had always stuck out in my memory about a woman in Chicago who was murdered by this guy, where her ghost haunted her co-worker who helped the Chicago police solve the violent homicide and arson.  If it were not for that lady's detailed information from beyond the grave, then the case would have never been solved & the killer would have never been caught.

 There has never been another show like this one with the exception of John Walsh & Fox's America's Most Wanted, but this show was much better and now all of these years later they still have not been able to replace the high level of professionalism and detail that this show provided audiences.  This show had been produced before the days when extreme politics and political correctness had infiltrated and dominated every aspect of the NBC network, back when non-political and professional adults had been in charge of the programing & not Radical Left Wing adolescents with twisted agendas to push on the American public.

Dear executives at NBC, bring this show back with updated stories from the 2010's.  A+ & thumbs way up for the late Robert Stack.  A fine gentleman he was.",1432339200,2,2091,4.674863387978142

2477121,4,B000E0OBJW,"I am a big Unsolved Mysteries fan.  The show has an excellent quality along with Robert Stack's announcer voice to share frightening and compelling stories of mysteries and the supernatural.  This set has episode segments divided into categories: murders, ghosts, psychics, ufos, legends, miracles, and one disc combining treasures and ghosts.  So I can remember two categories from the television show that are not present: fraud and reuniting family members.  So if you pop in a disc from the category you will have hours of entertainment from each category!  It's still a great programme.

Now Unsolved Mysteries is a great programme but there are some flaws in this set.

-The biggest flaw is that the volume is very unsteady and uneven.  This occurs in three ways.  First, sometimes the sound drops out in the middle of an episode part so you have to crank up the volume, then it blasts you when it comes back.  Second, each episode segment has a different volume than the ones before or after so you have to adjust.  Third, the music is really loud compared to the voices, so it is hard to find a balance so you don't have blaring music, but also so you can make out what they are saying.  My solution is to have the remote control in hand and manually adjust the volume the whole time.  This sounds like a pain but Unsolved Mysteries is a really good show!  So I just get used to it.  There aren't any other manufacturers producing the DVDs, so this is the only one.

-Another minor flaw is that the episodes are not updated.  If a crime happened in 1990, I would like an update like they did in the television show.  But they are shown as they aired on television.  I wonder if some of these mysteries were solved.

-And the final flaw is that I am disappointed that they cut out episode parts to form these categories instead of releasing all episodes.  I really hope they make a new one with all the episodes even though I spent a lot of money on this one.  I miss the reuniting families, that was always so nice to see.",1298073600,3,2030,4.4890710382513666
2477122,4,B000E0OBJW,"This is an awesome collection of Unsolved Mystery shows on DVD.  The only thing is, is that it's seperated by topics instead of full shows.  It's still an awesome buy!",1295222400,,167,4.533333333333333
2477123,5,B000E0OBJW,"Hello my sister bought me this unsolved mysteries set as a christmas gift
and i have to say it is very very high quality from the dvd series
to the beautiful treasure chest type box it comes in i have heard
my friend complain that the box is made of cardboard this is true but the box
is very heavy and sturdy it is about 1/4 of an inch thick and is laminated
the unsolved mysteries logo is imbosed on the laminated box with gold or matallic
letters the box lid is hinged like a treasure chest at first glance from the back
it looks like it might give way after a lot of use but after closer  examination
i found that the lid is hinged buy a thick piece of cloth book binding tape
which means that even if after much use the outside back panel where the lid
hinges to the box seems like it could start to show ware the strip of cloth
book binding tape will defently keep the box in great working condtion there
is no reason why this set shouldn't last a life time if you take care of it

2477124,5,B000E0OBJW,"This collection was the single best DVD purchase I ever made. Robert Stack MADE this TV series a hit, his voice adds an element of creepiness. I have been a huge fan of the original U.M. since I was 10 years old in 1985. Even when the show went of the air I continued watching the show for years on the Lifetime channel. If you are a big U.M. fan like I am then you will love this collection. The new U.M. with Dennis Farina cannot replace Robert Stack's U.M., not even close.

I haven't personally seen many repeat episodes on television since this show's cancellation and this is a great way to rewatch it again at your own pace.  Granted, this is NOT the full series.  If you expect that in only 25 disks, you are sadly mistaken.  It is more of a collection of the 'best of' Unsolved.  Robert Stack is in all of them and each disk has approximately 7 stories on it.  The collection is broken down into mini collections of 4 disks (4 bizarre murders, 4 UFOs, 4 Strange Legends, etc.).  Definitely worth the money!!  Also, mine must be a newer version because my box is still like a little treasure box but much smaller and the disks are in the super slim DVD cases, not full-sized ones.

I highly recommend this Treasure Chest if you like the original series, R.I.P Robert ""Bob"" Stack, he made this show what it is!",1445212800,3,291,4.214285714285714
