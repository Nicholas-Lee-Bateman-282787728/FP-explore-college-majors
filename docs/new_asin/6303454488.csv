661217,2,6303454488,"I just came across the great music of Bob Dylan a few weeks ago I have since downloaded many of his albums and bought the famous D.A. Pennebaker film Don't Look Back, a great film with the amazing music of Bob Dylan at his best still playing without a band.
Bob Dylan Unplugged is Bob Dylan at his worst that will actually make you feel sorry for him.  Unlike Johnny Cash who is able to use his aged voice to bring power to his songs Dylan just sounds like he needs to get out of music.
It is amazing how silly he sounds singing the words of Desolation Row and The Times They Are A-Changin'.  These great sounding songs with great lyrics are not only sung horribly but thrown into an electronic mess of sound with Dylan sounding comical with a voice worse than anything you will ever hear.  Like a Rolling Stone is almost funny on this film, you don't think about the words you think about Dylan's horrible voice and him changing it every few lines.
Usually for a bad concert tape you would say ?buy this only if I was a diehard Dylan fan.?  I am a diehard fan.  I say only buy this horrible film if you hate Bob Dylan and want to laugh at him.",1057363200,12,1144,4.181818181818182

It's the music and words that made Bob Dylan great. On this video  Dylan sings like he never did in the 80's. He is coming back and so is his  {new}band. In the mid 80's his concerts was not what you expected. But now on  this video you will see Dylan reborn. Lots of songs who was sung by others  can not reach that spirit like Dylan does on this video. Bob Dylan is always  on tour and the concerts is still growing with it.

661321,5,6303454488,"MTV's Unplugged series over the years brought to television some of the very best musicians in rock, pop, grunge and even jazz put them in an intimate studio setting with acoustic instruments and perform some of their biggest hits. This was back in the day when the ""M"" in MTV meant music. Nowadays it seems like the ""M"" in MTV means mundane. Anyway I digress.

In 1994 MTV brought to the studio Bob Dylan himself for a live acoustic performance 29 years after Dylan shocked the world during the Newport Folk Festival by bringing out and playing an electric guitar. The results of that performance in November of 1994 was pure joy to watch. The audience was eager and waiting for something special to happen that night and Dylan and his excellent backup musicians did not disappoint and in fact looked eager to perform. It showed during the concert.

Dylan himself sounded pretty good in voice and on the guitar. The backup musicians themselves were enjoying performing as they helped to bring a different look and feel to many of Dylan's classic hits. The songs Dylan performed that night spanned from the '60s to the early '90s and from albums like ""The Times They are A-Changin'"" to ""Oh Mercy"". For the older songs Dylan and his group mixed up and changed around a bit the style and tempo making the songs for the listener familiar yet not predicable. Bet best songs during the performance however were the newer numbers. ""Shooting Star"" from the ""Oh Mercy"" album, and my favorite song from that album, is beautiful while ""Dignity"" which would appear on ""Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Volume 3"" has some of the best lyrics Dylan has ever penned and that says a lot considering how many songs he has written over the years.

Production wise the DVD is first rate both in sound and video. This is a good addition for anyone who is a hardcore or even casual fan of Dylan and a video that you will surely watch again and again.",1429660800,,1922,4.614035087719298

I recommend this to anyone that is into Dylan's lyrics. Make sure it's played with a good sound system, very good acustic music. My favorite is ""Dignity"" Great show, Thank you Bob Dylan and I'll cya in Vegas. Not bad for a old man like me. I'd like to find a Petty acustic concert DVD, no luck yet.

661470,3,6303454488,"Bob Dylan. MTV Unplugged.
I have to admit that I have mixed feelings about this DVD. It is always nice to see a performance by one of your favorite singers, but rather painful to watch when they are not at their best. On this album, Bob mumbles and sometimes forgets the words to songs that he has sung for years, leaving you to coach him along by using your memory to fill in the words for him. On a few songs, his overtaxed voice starts to fail him, and the band has to carry him along to keep the songs going. The instruments of the other five band members sometimes drown him out completely, and the album has a general feeling of  going through the motions. A flat performance. I tried using both of the DVD's audio settings, PCM Stereo and Dolby  Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, but on a computer with a pair of amplified desktop speakers, there is only so much you can do to improve the sound. I much prefer his early black and white film recordings, when his voice and memory were better, and where it was only Bob, his guitar, and his harmonica...as simple and as close to perfection as it gets. You couldn't reasonably ask for more.",1247184000,,1138,4.363207547169812
661471,4,6303454488,"Not intentionally, a least I do not think that is the case, I watched this Bob Dylan MTV Concert from 1995 directly after watching his Bob Dylan: The Other Side of The Mirror: Live at The Newport Folk Festival 1963-1965, Bob Dylan and various other artists, 2007. I have reviewed that documentary separately in this space. However, comments, and of necessity, comparisons between the two are in order here. I will not go on and on about hair styles and clothing as I did in the earlier film, in order to draw contrasts, because except wearing some sunglasses his persona has not changed dramatically from the 1965 Concert where he set himself on his own personal rock and roll (or better, I think) folk rock path.

Obviously, there cannot be a complete comparison between play lists for the two films because in 1965 some of the material covered in the 1995 film had not been created like Knockin' On Heaven's Door or things like that. Others are older works, like a well- done John Brown, which had not been released earlier. Or the 1990's-created Dignity. One can, however, compare certain material covered in both films like The Times They Are A- Changin' , the classic Like a Rolling Stone and Love Minus Zero, No Limit (hereafter, No Limits).

Two things are clear by 1995. One is that Dylan, either by design or happenstance, had changed the mood and the manner in which he sang those songs, some for the better, some not. I believe that his newer version of Like a Rolling Stone geared to the musical tastes of a new generation works, No Limits does somewhat and Times not at all. First, I had to get over the sentimentally of knowing how these songs were played in my youth and wanting to cling to that notion, especially on a favored love anthem like No Limits. Still the changed-up in rhythm only partially works to demonstrate the original pathos of that song.

Second, and this is something I had also observed in a live concert that I attended in the early 1990's, old Bob had lost his voice and had adjusted some of his material to that new fact. Here comparison with the strong vibrant voice of 1965 is truly amazing. His adjustments worked best on a then new song like Dignity that has lyrics like in the old days but reflected his new vocal range. Nice. So is this thing worth seeing and hearing. Sure. But I would get that old The Other Side of the Mirror documentary - on purpose- to check out why, for a minute anyhow Dylan was the voice of my generation, the generation of '68.",1218153600,2,2498,4.534368070953437
661472,4,6303454488,"This is the famous ""Unplugged"" concert recorded for MTV in 1994. Of course all Dylan fans should have this DVD, for others a few comments:
(1) Dylan often rethinks his songs in concert so the version of a song such as ""Love Minus Zero/No Limit"" is quite different to what was recorded in the studio - this is neither a good or bad thing - just something to be aware of.
(2) Also when people say Dylan was in ""good voice"" here, the initiated may not be so convinced. Again Dylan live - especially in his later years - is a somewhat acquired taste.
(3) The song select could have been better. There are so many other songs I would rather have here, but obviously this is a matter of personal taste.",1208995200,2,696,4.28030303030303

661548,5,6303454488,"Dylan concerts are famously uneven: Some are magical, some are dead, but this is one of the magical ones.  Not only are the performances terrific with Dylan upbeat and engaging the audience, but he shows how a performer should age.  Rather than try to recreate the youthful rock and rolling that existed when ""Tombstone Blues"" and ""Like A Rolling Stone"" were recorded, Dylan brings the tempo down and provides arrangements that are different but just as good as the originals.  The best part is the music fits the man singing it, so instead of looking like a middle aged rocker clinging to youth, Dylan has recreated his music to age with him.

Dylan's music has always been timeless, and it's wonderful to see he has the creativity and self-awareness to make himself timeless in the vein of BB King, John Lee Hooker, Johnny Cash, Ray Charles, and not a ridiculous looking Mick Jagger pretending he's still twenty-five.",1141948800,13,919,4.834394904458598

I also know what it feels like to have aged enough that many might wonder if you have enough left to deliver - as you once did. Critics may be helpful in pointing out areas of their experience and expertise, but unitl you perform on a stage like Bob Dylan did with one of the best back up bands I have ever heard (...even an orchestra can be ""back up""), we'd all be better off to take in and enjoy as much of this unparalleled artist, poet, musician, composer, arranger as we can while gifted with that intangible illumination rendering one completely still and...in tears.",1134172800,10,885,4.6075949367088604

From the mellow country feel of ""Shooting Star"", the up-tempo ""Dignity"", or the somber ""With God on Our Side"", the musicianship is a marvel, and being a ""nobody sings Dylan like Dylan"" person, I love the way he sings his music with his gravelly voice that gets rougher as the years go by.

661551,5,6303454488,"Dylan's more than deserving resurgence in recent years traces its birth back, in my opinion, to this incredible live performance from 1994. This show has it all, mixing old and new music that more than satisfies longtime fans such as myself while also managing to appeal strongly to the younger generation, many of whom would know Dylan only by name had MTV not provided the medium for him to prove his genius and longevity to them first-hand. Dylan's tendency to be reclusive and mysterious has made him inaccessible to some listeners in the past, but the energetically appreciative audience is an important part of this recording, and you can tell that Dylan is really enjoying the whole performance. He even smiles at one point; having seen Dylan perform live, I know just how rare an occurrence this can be.
The older songs are great, but they differ significantly from the original recordings (Dylan is constantly redefining and recreating his legendary classics); this may disappoint some fans, and I admit it took me a while to appreciate this particular version of The Times They Are A-Changin', but the soul of each song remains the same, no matter what kind of modernized or different interpretation Dylan decides to go with on a certain night. I love Tombstone Blues, and it does start the show off with a great kick. It's always nice to hear Dylan's All Along the Watchtower, if for no other reason than to let people know the song didn't originate with Jimi Hendrix. Rainy Day Women #12 & 35 has never been a favorite of mine, but this version is an enjoyable splash of fun in between a couple of slow, serious songs. John Brown is a significant track, dating back to 1963 but never having been released. It vividly reflects the anti-war feelings Dylan expressed so forcibly in his formative years.  Dylan's newer songs only build on the musical momentum.  I was a little surprised to see Shooting Star from the Oh Mercy album included, but the track looks and sounds great and fits right in. Dignity was a brand new song at the time, standing as a true showcase of Dylan's unparalleled songwriting and performing skills.  He may have aged, but his musical vision and talent are eternal.

Three songs particularly stand out to me. Desolation Row is a truly incredible, meaningful song that only Dylan could write and perform. Lasting more than eight minutes, it's the kind of song you never want to end. Knockin' on Heaven's Door really starts building the momentum that reaches its crescendo with my favorite Dylan performance ever of his greatest song, Like a Rolling Stone. Having wowed his audience for close to an hour, Dylan is definitely ""feeling it"" when he gets to this crowd-pleasing classic (after a rather humorous false start). Its length is matched only by its powerful delivery, and I get the feeling watching it that even Dylan is a little surprised at how great a show he is putting on.  He is absolutely on fire, and he knows it.  With God On Our Side is an interesting song with which to end the show, but it reflects the heart and soul of music's greatest songwriter. Following on the heels of a rocking performance, it reminds the audience that the old Dylan so many have loved for decades is still there, even if his classic songs have been given a fresh overhaul.
Having a rather small audience so close to the musicians makes this live performance a true personal triumph for Dylan, and the sense of intimacy between the legendary performer and his fans is powerful and palpable. Dylan never looked or sounded better than he did on this unforgettable night in 1994.  If you saw the performance on MTV, you should know that the DVD contains four bonus songs not included in the television broadcast (as well as one song - Love Minus Zero/No Limit - not included on the CD).  If you already have the CD, buy the DVD as well - the visuals capture the magical effects of the performance in ways the audio cannot.",1086134400,62,3945,4.698986975397974

Los temas elegidos son tocados con esa ""magia"" increible, tipica de Dylan.
Este DVD es sumamente recomendable tanto para fanaticos como para aquellos que no conozcan mucho su obra.
Brillante una leyenda viviente de la musica.",1082419200,7,450,5.013333333333334
661553,3,6303454488,"What we have here is the video replica of the self-titled 1995 live cd, with an identical setlist of songs extracted from 2 gigs at NYC Sony studios. The owners of the previous VHS tape edition can now throw it away or give it as a present to some annoying relative, and enjoy the four ""new"" songs (that do appear in the cd, they are 'Tombstone Blues', 'John Brown', 'Desolation Row', and 'Love Minus Zero/No Limit') and the improved image and sound (both PCM stereo & Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround) quality.

These differences with last century's tape version are boasted on the dvd cover as 'special features' (cheeky guys!) and, yes, that's all there is. No previously officially unavailable songs from the sessions have been added (big 'OOOH' here), nor anything at all anybody might have expected or fantasized with. The disc contains 4.20 Gb of information consisting in a 73 mins concert, and nothing else, that's all, folks. It neither has subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing which, given the state of Dylan's voice, might've been welcomed. But i know every word of the lyrics, and so do you. At least it's cheap, and cheaper than here in Spain, my dear lucky americans, i paid 17+ euros for my fresh copy.
As for concert itself ... well, we've all heard or seen it, don't you? ye fellow dylan-iacs. I quite like it, especially the totally plugged rocking acoustic guitars. Not your average mellow unplugged 'oh-but-we-are-sensitive-souls-deep-inside' concert, thanks Bob. The Major drawback is the cinematic quality itself: dull, unimaginative, repetitive. what can you expect from an awful channel such as MTV? the thing is filmed in a kind of loop of a few shots with lots of showoff dollys showing nothing interesting. the same shots over and over again. you can predict which will come next like with the lyrics of a bad song. Sometimes Bob starts a solo and boom! they cut to the bass player or something. maybe it's very avant-garde and i didn't get it. or maybe it's that i bought 'The Last Waltz' dvd the same day and watched bits of it before and, boy, 'The Last Waltz' is, simply put, the best filmation of a concert EVER made, and comparing the work of Martin Scorsese with that of some MTV director is well, like comparing the animation of Walt Disney's 'Pinocchio' with that of 'Beavis and Butthead'.",1080691200,26,2326,4.757425742574258
661554,1,6303454488,"Let me begin by saying how excited I was when I picked up this DVD.  However, as the first track passed, it was very apparent that the quality of Bob Dylan's performance was definitely lacking.  I'm sitting here guzzling a couple beers to contain my frustration.  I would strongly discourage anyone from getting this awful DVD.",1080604800,8,327,4.803571428571429

I'm surprised they didn't fix the microphones since it was produced to be filmed.",1509926400,,244,4.902439024390244

I wanted a DVD of bob.  The concert was only fair but I got to see one of the greatest musical icons of all time.  And this DVD does the same! A great memory to have bob on DVD.

Anyway this has some versions of some of his classics I'd recommend only if your collecting  some memorabilia of Dylan.  He's pushing on now but he's a legend  nonetheless
The music is fab bob mightn't be the clearest voice right now but I have s piece of history",1503273600,,504,3.892156862745098
