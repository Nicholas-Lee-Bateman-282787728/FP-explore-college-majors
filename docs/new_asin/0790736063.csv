104999,3,0790736063,"Sorry but I don't feel this is the best of the Hammer Frankenstein series.  That honor belongs to REVENGE OF FRANKENSTEIN.  I even found CURSE more satisfying.  The film starts with the mad Baron, wearing an ugly mask, decapitating a critic of his work.  Considering he had been sort of heroic in the previous film, where did this Baron suddenly come from?  The writing in this series was very inconsistent.  The Hammer DRACULA series is much better overall.
  Anyway, the movie seems more interested in a look at society's evils and less on the Frankenstein legend.  All the Baron does is transplant a brain from one man to another.  The man who created life and transplanted souls is little more than a mad doctor in this film.  And having Frankenstein rape the woman was totally out of character for the Baron, thrown in by the producer.  None of the actors wanted it used.
  True it has all the famous Hammer expertise.  It looks very atmospheric and gothic, is well acted and directed.  But it left me wanting to see a real FRANKENSTEIN movie.",1006214400,4,1048,4.644808743169399
105000,3,0790736063,"The mad scientist carries on his dark science. Peter Cushing typically appears in Hammer flicks as a benevolent professor type. Dr. Frankenstein is portrayed frequently as well intentioned, but misunderstood. This time, the doctor pursues his research with relentless malice. Brutal murder, blackmail, and even rape befall those in his way. Cushing's cold-blooded and vicious portrayal is really a change of pace. To those who picture the old Boris Karloff version of Frankenstein's monster, this version of the story goes off in yet another direction. Instead of a hulking creature with neck bolts terrorizing torch-bearing villagers, we have the hapless victim of a brain transplant. Dr. Brandt, an associate of Frankenstein's, is the unfortunate person whose brain is now in another body. Not happy with this development, he decides to foil Frankenstein. The large cranial scar is grotesque, but he is otherwise human. The script and director blend pathos with shock appeal. The subplot of the young couple who is forced to assist Frankenstein serves as an excuse for most of the subterfuge of the story. Expect a lot of running around and hiding from the police. Simon Ward and the delectable Veronica Carlson make it endurable. Carlson's appearance in a diaphanous nightgown drives Frankenstein from research to rape and beyond. Thorley Walters provides timely comic relief as a pompous police official. The usual Hammer production values of rich color photography and 19th century European settings are present. Genre fans and collectors should be pleased. It's a change of pace from the mad-slasher type horror flick. ;-)",1002240000,5,1628,5.33852140077821
105001,5,0790736063,"""Don't listen to the last reviewer, It's quit obvious that some people don't know what films are about sometimes--sometimes they amount to more than just simple plain entertainment. Just like Martin Scorcees's ""Taxie Driver"" the film mirrors the nilihism, cynicism of soecity, here being-- of the late 1960's.  Reflecting Fisher's parinoia take and look on society. This time The Baron is not the anti-hero, he is the monster, who is simply alienated in a soceity that refuses the ethics of science. He has tried many time, countless experiments, countless failures, he has become sick and embittered with soceity, and downright misanthorpic. There's alot that this film offers, but if you merely decide to dissmiss the film as just another Frankestein film, or if your one of those people who prefer the Universal Frankenstein series---then ur lost. At least Hammer came up with something new everytime, it kept the whole Frankenstein myth fresh, and if anything Hammer's Frankenstein series is vastly superior to there often Overrated Dracula films (excluding ""Horror"", Prince of Darkness"" and ""Taste"")  And like the movie ""Taxie Driver""-which was Scorsess's masterpiece, Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed"" is Terence Fisher's Masterpiece.",991958400,,1238,5.476439790575916
105002,5,0790736063,"The good doctor is back to transplanting brains in this fifth entry in the Hammer Frankenstein series.  Baron Frankenstein (Peter Cushing) is on the run again and has moved into a boarding house run by lovely Anna Spengler (Veronica Carlson), whose boyfriend Karl (Simon Ward) is a doctor at the local asylum who has been selling drugs to help support Anna's sick mother.  The Baron blackmails the couple into helping him with his latest plan.  One of the inmates in the asylum is Dr. Brandt (George Pravda), and the Baron wants to use brain surgery to cure his insanity.  Unfortunately, Brandt dies from a heart attack during the kidnapping, so the Baron kills the handy Dr. Richter (Freddie Jones) and ends up using that body for Brandt's brain.  Frankenstein has never created a more sympathetic figure than we have hear, Richter with Brand's brain in a shaven head covered with stitches.  The strength of this film is that it explores the ""reality"" of the situation, such as when this pitiful creature stands outside his home and tries to make his wife understand what has happened.  Of course the title gives away the film's intended climax.
Director Terence Fisher considers ""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed"" to be one of his two best efforts for Hammer films.  Judging the film is an interesting balance between the compelling pathos of Brandt with his brain in another man's body and the abrupt changes in Baron Frankenstein from the rest of the series in this 1969 film, undoubtedly due to the appearance of two new screenwriters, Bert Batt and Anthony Nelson-Keys.  Cushing's character is no longer a sympathetic figure as he was in most of the earlier films...In the end I judge Freddie Jones' performance as two steps forward to negate the nonsense with Cushing's one step back.",989712000,3,1789,4.897350993377484

The film starts off with a quick little beheading with a  scythe, then it's off to the lab. A drunk intruder, looking to burglarize  the good doctor, foils Frankenstein's plan forcing him to find other  accomodations. He moves into a bed n breakfast and terrorizes a young  couple, and blackmails them into doing his bidding. Frankenstein gets the  young man to murder, rapes the girl, and steals a colleagues brain, all in  the name of science. This is by far the darkest of the Hammer Frankenstein  series, and the best. We see that the doctor will stop at nothing to prove  a point . Lots of suspense, blood, and lots of the beautiful Veronica  Carlson. My only complaint is the reproduction is not the greatest.

This is the fifth of the seven  Frankenstein films and the only one of the last five that comes close to  being as good as Curse and Revenge. FMBD has a strong script, the story is  very simple, but  never lets up. We have a scientist who was doing similiar  work to Frankenstein and now he has become a victim of the same type of  work that was once his life. I find this this whole concept very  interesting and the film just never slows down. Peter Cushing is sinister  and relentless in his pursuit of ""knowledge"", his biting humor in  this film is classic. The whole supporting cast does well, although Thorley  Walters' character becomes a little too much at times.

105019,2,0790736063,"Warner Bros BD release: The film: 3 stars. This BD presentation: 1 star.  This isn't one of Hammer's best Frankenstein films but it is well put together and does entertain, and the mounting dramatic tension towards the end is a triumph of direction. The makeup of the large scar around  Freddie Jones's head was convincing in a sickly way! Interesting too to see 'that' scene with Peter Cushing and Veronica Carlson which I do not recall having viewed before - perhaps having been censored previously. It was added against Director Terence Fisher's wishes at the insistence of James Carreras but after several takes Terence just said, ""Cut! That's enough."". What I really want to comment on is the dreadful picture quality of this release (based on viewing the film through a quality pj system). The colours were muted, even washed out and lacked any vibrancy; the dark/black scenes (eg Frankenstein's jacket) were bereft of any significant definition and detail, leaving viewers with an overall dim/dull picture. Sound quality was average but in places badly muffled (at c. 0:55 and c. 1:31). This is an appalling so-called high definition release. There really needs to be some regulation made forcing distributors to accurately advertise exactly the level of quality the customer is paying for. I am disappointed with such a major distributor such as Warner Bros creating such a POOR release with no obvious signs of restoration: You could learn something by examining Hammer's latest release of the original 1958 film 'Dracula', and their latest BD release of Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell, where the brilliance of the film and all the hard work that went into the production values shine through.",1451692800,5,1710,5.081850533807829

105022,4,0790736063,"Hammer Film definitely made better films about Baron Frankenstein (as played by Peter Cushing) than those dealing with the Count Dracula (with Christopher Lee). ""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed"" is a superb entry, with a script written by the man Orson Welles once called one of the two best A.D. in the film business. The scientist is again ruthless and cruel, stopping at nothing to keep experimenting with life and human organ transplants. He blackmails a young couple that is planning to wed: the girl administers the guesthouse Frankenstein takes hold of, while her groom is a surgeon. As the story unfolds, Frankenstein turns into a real wicked old man (excellent ""el Cushing"") As in ""The Revenge of Frankenstein"" there is no monster in the plot and the surgeries are successful, so the writers had to create potent dramas dealing with medicine, ""progress"", death, the infinite possibilities of scientific experimentation, the negative effect of the ignorant's slander, the selling of drugs as modus vivendi, and of course with erotic elements.

105025,5,0790736063,"I hope that Warner will continue to release their library of Hammer Horror onto HD Blu-ray (and, hopefully, even beyond to 4K!).

""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed"" -- The 5th film in Hammer's Frankenstein series -- is generally considered one of the 2 best of the 7 Frankenstein feature length motion pictures made by Hammer (with 6 of them starring Peter Cushing as our favorite Dr. Frankenstein). The other favorite is ""The Revenge of Frankenstein,"" released by Columbia Pictures in 1958 and now owned by Columbia purchaser Sony Pictures, was the 2nd film in the series and is badly in need of restoration (as ""The Revenge of Frankenstein"" looks flat and dirty on the old Columbia Tri-Star Home Entertainment DVD. Please, Sony, restore Horror Classic ""The Revenge of Frankenstein""!!!).

""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed"" benefits both from
(1) the improved resolution of this HD Blu-ray
and
(2) a minor but totally annoying problem with a couple reels (for around 20 minutes or so) on the old DVD --There was obviously some liquid droppings (making spots in the frame look like white burned-out pixels) on the telecine glass during the older transfer for DVD, and once you notice them you can't stop being annoyed by it. Well, while it was not on the entire movie, that problem is totally gone here in HD, and I'm thankful for that as I love this film!

But, I will complain that this transfer does some minor ""revisionist"" color timing work here that does not benefit the film (and this was not the case with the older DVD) -- The ""reds"" are pushed too high on this new transfer. The more natural skin color found on the older DVD transfer has been replaced by a more ruddy and not complementary red/yellow/orange look, and it does not suit nor benefit the film.

While overall I'm still happier with this HD version than the older DVD, I think Warner turned the wrong guy loose with this one! This could have been perfect. I was certainly hoping to see the beautiful skin of Veronica Carlson look more like it does in ""Dracula Has Risen From the Grave."" No, not the same, but just more natural. I will say that this ""red shift"" is wrong and I would not be lead to believe that it is the original intent of the artists. This is a decent looking film if you turn up the Black Levels on your HDTV (yes, the ""blacks"" are pushed a little too black here), as that will lessen the reddish look on many HDTV's, but it is still not perfect. I really wish that Warner would fix this, but I think that they will defend their choice and this will be what we have for the next decade.

So, despite any complaints, I say come on with more Hammer Horror Films for me, Warner Brothers.",1445731200,3,2671,4.579497907949791

In this case, he commandeers a boarding house when he discovers the proprietress' fianc (Simon Ward) is stealing drugs to help support his girlfriend's ailing mother.

Unfortunately for the Baron, there's a stupid inspector (Thorley Walters) a mile behind, trying to piece together a crime to blame on the bad doctor.  He never quite makes it to his goal but it's not for want of trying.

I loved everything about this movie except for an abrupt abbreviated rape sequence that neither Peter Cushing, Actress Veronica Carlson, nor director Terence Fisher wanted to film.

He exploits and blackmails a young Doctor Simon Ward and his girlfriend Veronica Carlson to help him in creating a new monster. Both Ward and Carlson give great supporting performances. Carlson is nice to look at and a very nice woman which derives a lot sympathy from the viewer since Frankenstein mistreats her and is mean to her. I liked seeing Frankenstein get more physical in this one. There are a lot of awesome fight scenes. Freddie Jones was outstanding as the monster. His small supporting part helped it to be a better movie. Jones is a real good actor. It had one of the greatest endings to a Frankenstein movie.

105047,4,0790736063,"Hammer Films once was the place for classic Gothic Horror.  The small British studio made lower budget films that had a big budget feel and look.  Peter Cushing was always the best Dr. Frankenstein, portraying him as a driven scientist who was so focused on knowledge that he had lost his moral compass.  Frankenstein Must be Destroyed was an entry made after the implementation of the Movie rating system.  In 1968, Dracula Has Risen from the Grave garnered a ""G"" rating.  That tag was then is it is now, the kiss of death for a horror flick.  Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed has several facets that would insure the movie would earn an ""R"" rating.  Cushing's portrayal of the good doctor is more sinister than usual.  The movie also has a beheading and a rape scene that were included to insure the more adult rating.  Although these scenes actually detract from the pace of the story, the overriding themes of science myopia, morality and the soul are still very prominent in this film.

105060,5,0790736063,"The reasons why some connoisseurs of the horror film genre...Hammer Films specifically...will LOVE this movie are perhaps the SAME reasons why others won't like it at all.

1). It is NOT a ""monster movie."" Those who are familiar with Hammer's late 50s - late 60s glory days already know that Universal's ""Frankenstein Monster"" makeup was trademarked / copyrighted / etc...so the ""monsters"" in EVERY Hammer Frankenstein film look different, with ""Evil of Frankenstein"" coming closest to the ""look"" of the Universal monster. The ""monster"" in this one is a guy with the top of his head sewn back on after a brain transplant. He could be any guy down at the local pub if it weren't for the scar circling his scalp.

2). The ""Monster"" in this film is Baron Frankenstein. There is some surgery (as well as severed heads), but the real monster here is the Baron. His unrepentant (and often sly, gleeful) evil is far beyond anything perpetrated by the various patchwork quilt reanimated corpses we've seen in horror films throughout the years.

3). Even the ""bloodiest"" Hammer movies drew most of their power from the heavy Gothic atmosphere, and you'll find plenty of it here. Some blood, too...just not gallons of it. You have to immerse yourself in a Hammer film, you can't just casually glance over at the screen every now and then. That said, if you jump into the deep end, you will be amply rewarded.

I could go into greater detail, but the more I give you specifics, the more I'll be giving you spoilers (like the quote in my review title...Cushing delivers the line magnificently, as if he's proud of himself for ""GREATLY breaking the law).

The short version of what I would like for you to know about this film is that it is absolutely a star vehicle, a tour de force, for Peter Cushing. Along with Christopher Lee, he formed the rock-solid foundation of Hammer's golden era, but in this film, there's a little something extra...and it is subtly woven throughout his entire performance. The Baron is brilliant...that can't be denied. He's skilled. He's resourceful (no matter how many times you chase him away, he will always set up shop somewhere else). And as evil as he is, he still has this raw, electric charm that gets him from one bloodbath to the next. Cushing's Frankenstein is easily the most complex take on the character out of ANY of the film adaptations...the guy you love to hate, the guy you hate to love.

SO...don't expect ""monsters"" in the classic sense, DO expect SUPERIOR acting and story lines, and add this one to your collection.",1365897600,2,2556,4.758465011286682

Frankenstein hopes to transplant the brain of an old colleague, Dr. Brandt, into a fresh new body to clear his mind of the debilitating disease which has driven him mad so that he may steal Brandt's secrets, but the revived doctor will have no part in Frankenstein's evil plan! Terence Fisher turns out another Gothic masterpiece in FRANKENSTEIN MUST BE DESTROYED, the fifth installment from Hammer's thrilling horror series! Here, the baron takes a sinister turn for the worst under the controlled guidance of Peter Cushing, who gives his best performance in the series. It is this vile take on the character for which he is most often remembered. Cushing is given strong support by Simon Ward as his unwilling apprentice and especially by Freddie Jones as the unfortunate Dr. Brandt. The scene in which the recently revived Brandt is rejected by his horrified widow strikes a devastating blow to the viewer's emotion. As always, Fisher delivers many artful touches along the way, despite the smaller production. It all ends in a fiery finale, which should have served as a fitting end for our wayward doctor before the series could begin to fall into decline. FRANKENSTEIN MUST BE DESTROYED is in top contention with FRANKENSTEIN CREATED WOMAN as being the strongest sequel in the series, and one of Hammer's finest films.

105063,4,0790736063,"Mary Shelly has no doubt rolled in her grave over most adaptations of her novel; FRANKENSTEIN has never been accurately adapted to the screen.  Released in 1969 and the fifth in the 'Hammer Horror' Frankenstein series, FRANKENSTEIN MUST BE DESTROYED has about as much to do with Mary Shelly as it does with Peter Pan.

This is not to say it isn't an interesting movie, and it may actually be the single most interesting Frankenstein flick to come out of the 'Hammer Horror' series.  In this particular go round, Frankenstein (Peter Cushing) is desperate to obtain research knowledge from a collegue who has gone mad--and when he realizes that the problem is not so much insanity as it is the inability of the collegue's body to accept oxygen, Frankenstein sets out switch the man's brain into a new body.  In order to accomplish this, he blackmails a boarding house owner (Veronica Carlson) and her lover Karl (Simon Ward) to break the scientist out of the asylum and perform the brain transplant.  Unfortunately, the man's wife (Maxine Audley) recognizes Frankenstein in the street, tracks him to her husband, and causes no end of trouble.  It is a situation in which the operation is a success, but the patient dies...taking his doctor along with him.

Indeed, FRANKENSTEIN MUST BE DESTROYED has an unusually high body count, with all but two of the major characters dead by the time the credits roll.  It also has a somewhat notorious rape scene.  According to film lore, the producers felt the film needed an extra jolt of sex to be successful at the box office, and when principle shooting wrapped Hammer Pictures demanded that director Terence Fisher film a sequence in which Peter Cushing rapes Veronica Carlson.  All three were appalled, and all three tried to refuse, but a contract is a contract and the scene was done.  Legend has it that Cushing found the whole thing so distasteful that he afterward apologized to Veronica Carlson for the whole thing.

This aside, and in spite of the inevitably cheap sets and costumes that go along with a Hammer Horror film, FRANKENSTEIN MUST BE DESTROYED is an entertaining film, with everything from bodies buried in the courtyard to rooms in flames.  The DVD is not pristine, but it is very good, and fans of the genre should enjoy it.

105064,4,0790736063,"Director Terence Fisher had quickly grown bored with the Hammer Dracula series, along with the character of the Count.  For the two sequels, Fisher omitted the title character from the first (Brides of Dracula, 1960) and then made him secondary to Barbara Shelley's character in Dracula, Prince of Darkness.  However, Fisher clearly reveled in the Baron Frankenstein character and focused primarily on the creator, as opposed to the creation.

In the fourth of the series, Frankenstein Created Woman (1967), the Baron allegorically became God the Father in Fisher's idiosyncratic take on the Trinity.  In that film, Peter Cushing's Baron is empathetic and waxes poetic at the tragic conclusion.  In the fifth film, Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed (1969), Fisher and Cushing create an alternative perspective on Frankenstein.  Here, the Doctor is at his most obsessed and least sympathetic.

Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed is a relentlessly paced, visceral, and nihilistic film.  The opening, bouncing-off-the-wall sequence, in which the masked Baron interrupts a potential burglar--who in turn stumbles upon a gruesome laboratory straight out of a Josef Mengele nightmare--juxtaposed, as usual, to James Bernard's athletic score,  is all worthy of Franjou.

The striking Veronica Carlson gives the best performance of  her short-lived career as the tragic Anna; the Baron's landlord, whom he blackmails and brutally rapes.  Carlson registers complete devastation in a skillfully tense scene in which a water main bursts at the boarding house to reveal the hand of the Baron's latest victim.

Unfortunately, the rape scene, inserted by the meddlesome producer, throws off the film.  Fisher, Cushing, and Carlson all rightfully objected to it as it is unnecessary, nonsensical and cheapening.  That scene aside, the rest of the film is so well directed and acted that it clearly is the best of Hammer's Frankenstein series.

The dependable Thorley Walters returns as an acidic inspector, Freddie Jones brings real pathos to the transplanted Dr. Brandt, and Maxine Audley even evokes sympathy as the much put upon Ella, who is, on the surface, an unsympathetic character.  Still, the film belongs to the Cushing's increasingly emaciated egomaniac Baron Frankenstein, who is vile here, yet never cartoonish.  Cushing is hopelessly charming, a progressive whom we root for (when putting bourgeoisie conservatives in their place), yet he is callous, single-minded,  and dangerously narcissistic .

Together with The Devil Rides Out (1968), The Horror of Dracula (1958), and The Hound of the Baskervilles (1959), Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed is Fisher at his most assured and at the top of his form.

105065,3,0790736063,"...is how you would describe the character of Baron Frankenstein in this 5th entry in the series and that takes it down a star in my estimation. This is a return to the original characterization in 1957's THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN after years of Peter Cushing gradually developing the character into the role of a misunderstood genius as opposed to a heartless experimenter. The difference this time around is that now the year is 1969, movie standards have changed, and this film takes its cue from the previous year's WITCHFINDER GENERAL where Vincent Price played a cold and sadistic character with no redeeming qualities which ultimately led to an unhappy ending for everyone involved. That film, made by Hammer's competitor Tigon, shook the British horror film down to it's very foundation and the cynical FRANKENSTEIN MUST BE DESTROYED was one of Hammer's answers.

Unlike the relatively sympathetic character the Baron was in 1966's FRANKENSTEIN CREATED WOMAN, this Baron is his complete opposite. It's as if Hammer had forgotten that the previous three films had even been made. The Baron's burned hands from the previous film have disappeared and in addition to his general out and out villainy, the Baron now forces himself on a young woman without even thinking about it. This rape scene, which was added by Hammer's producers and strenuously objected to by Cushing, was actually cut from release prints and only restored for the DVD. The overall look of the film is better than usual and it's a strong script for the most part with above average supporting performances (especially from Freddie Jones and Veronica Carlson) but a one-dimensional Baron Frankenstein is a very serious flaw.",1267920000,2,1699,5.089605734767025
105066,5,0790736063,"With a title like ""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed"", my initial impression was that this was going to be one of those over-the-top horror features that are quite characteristic of Hammer Films Productions. That opinion was soon revised after watching this movie, a perfect blend of drama, suspense, and great acting, especially by the talented Peter Cushing (one of my all-time favorite actors in the horror genre). Here, Cushing portrays the manic-obsessive Baron Frankenstein who flees from a scene of horror, only to visit his evil upon a pair of hapless lovers, a young doctor (Simon Ward) at an insane asylum, and his fiancee (Veronica Carlson), who makes the unfortunate decision of renting a room in her boarding house to Frankenstein. The pair are soon blackmailed to aid the nefarious Baron in his illicit activities, whilst the authorities try to track him down.

There are many chilling scenes in this movie - memorable ones such as the scene of a petty thief breaking into Frankenstein's lab, only to find himself facing a scene of indescribable horror and in mortal danger. There is also, disturbingly, a scene of assault in this movie involving a female character and the Baron, which I was quite taken aback by (definitely not a typical role for Cushing who always seems gentlemanly even when portraying 'monsters').

All in all, this is a well-made, atmospheric horror movie starring the great Peter Cushing in a monstrously evil role. A must-have for fans of classic horror.",1254355200,2,1490,5.0528455284552845
105067,4,0790736063,"In this splendid Hammer Production, Peter Cushing portrays a most evil, merciless Baron Frankenstein; he will kill anyone in order to ensure the success of his latest experiment: the transplanting of a brain from one human to another.  He wields sickles, knives, and torches as he dispatches anyone who interferes.  Peter Cushing reminds me of Vincent Price when he portrayed Dr. Phibes in his revenge movies.  From its blood-splaterring beginning to its fiery end, this movie continues to shock and horrify.  I'm surprised it didn't receive an ""R"" rating.  As always, with a Hammer movie, the film and audio quality are excellent.  The sets are lavish.  The acting is superb.  Veronica Carlson and Simon Ward protray a gorgeous couple who are in love and are being held captive against their will by the baron.  They are forced to help him carry out his evil plans.  This gothic horror has it all and is a definite must see for fans of Hammer Productions and Peter Cushing.  It has a moderate body count.  A higher body count would have earned it five stars from me.",1200614400,2,1067,4.770491803278689
105078,5,0790736063,"The Hammer Horror films have a tendency to take the suspense edge off so that the viewer can enjoy the saga as it unrolls. That's what I especially like about all their productions. And this one was simply superb in that realm, as well as in so many other facets.

First, the cinematography is just spectacular which is a hallmark for Hammer. There's nothing cheap or cheesy about this well-crafted film. The color saturation is just as I liked it. The sets were incredible.

Second, I enjoyed the story. With just a tiny glitch or two, it was as plausible as any horror flick of the era and moreso than most. Of course, they always get into trouble with selling the idea of the simplicity of a brain transplant, but HEY -- that's what Frankenstein ALWAYS does and we just have to eat that one! Mary Shelly gave the movie people no choice when she envisioned her early monster.

Third, I was sated with the ending, upon which I will not elaborate here -- but I thought it was a great one, albeit not a happy one for all the principals.

Last, looking at the film overall, I had an impression of ""film art"" (pretty rare feeling with horror flicks!) and I thought the whole thing was tastefully done and yielded a classy product. The one exception here was the rape scene (which was added to make us hate Cushing/Frankenstein), but I found it unnecessary and not relevant to the larger theme of the picture. Still, I'm sure others found it A-O-K -- life is not the same for everybody.

Finally, I'll state that this is one of my 3 favorite horror films, from any era of film-making. A fine job and a steller performance by all the actors, especially Peter Cushing.",1192060800,4,1662,4.490066225165563
105079,4,0790736063,"Hammer's 5th Baron Frankenstein film is, by far, their nastiest-- and in some ways, I must admit, perhaps their cleverest. Gone is any pretense of sympathy in the character-- in this, he's devolved into irredeemably evil. What kind of a ""hero"" (protagonist at best) DECAPITATES an innocent passer-by to aid in an experiment? Long way from digging up dead corpses, isn't it! What horrible fate brought dear, sweet, gentle Peter Cushing (Van Helsing in HORROR OF DRACULA and others, Sherlock Holmes in HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, a 60's tv series & MASKS OF DEATH) to such an utterly dispicable (and frighteningly convincing) portayal??? With such an outrageous title, you kinda know what you're in for.  The film really lives up to (or is down to?) its name.

Focused on brain transplants, the Baron blackmails a young couple to help him. What follows involves theft, murder, 2 kidnappings, another murder, deceit, rape (how'd THAT get in there?) and, finally, arson. (It's a horror film-- how ELSE would it end??) You feel sympathy for Simon Ward and Veronica Carlson, whose only original crime involved trying to get money to pay for her hospitalized relative. You feel NO sympathy whatsoever for the Baron, as he cold-bloodedly violates every law he can (among other things) on the road to ""scientific knowledge"".

Among the supporting cast are George Pravda as the Baron's insane collegue. Pravda was clever if wimpy as the atomic scientist in THUNDERBALL, and brilliant as the police chief in the DOCTOR WHO story, ""The Deadly Assasin"". Here he's merely a pathetic victim. Also on hand are  Freddie Jones (the scientist who sent Clint Eastwood on a spy mission in FIREFOX), who brings true sympathy to his role as the Baron's ""creation"". I watched the film several times without even noticing the parallel with the Mary Shelly story, as the ""monster"" seeks revenge for the man who thoughtlessly ""created"" him. (With Hammer films, sometimes it's hard to recognize the original source materials!) Peter Copley, a veteran of several DOCTOR WHO stories, has a small role as the head of the asylum. Blink and you might miss (I did) Frank Middlemass-- ""Rocky Hardcastle"" from AS TIME GOES BY, as one of the 4 ejected houseguests. Also hard to spot is Windsor Davies (""Sergeant-Major Zero"", my favorite character on Gerry Anderson's TERRAHAWKS series), one of the policemen who search Carlson's house. More of a standout is Geoffrey Bayldon, one of my favorite character actors (HORROR OF DRACULA, TO SIR WITH LOVE, CASINO ROYALE, THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD, and ""The Creature From The Pit"" on DOCTOR WHO) as the ""Police Doctor"". He's harrassed by the boisterous, loud-mouthed police inspector played by Thorley Walters. Here's an actor who's really gotten around-- over the years he's played Dr. Watson opposite 3 different Sherlock Holmes (Chris Lee, Douglas Wilmer & Christopher Plummer), was a psuedo-Renfield type (in DRACULA PRINCE OF DARKNESS), played the Baron's assistant (FRANKENSTEIN CREATED WOMEN) and here, a well-meaning cop who's so abbrassive you almost HOPE he doesn't get his man (and sadly he disappears about halfway thru the film). I swear, watching this film again, I found myself thinking-- I used to WORK for that man!!! (The character reminds me EXACTLY of a software writer I know in Cherry Hill who shall, of course, remain nameless.)

Legend has it director Terrence Fisher thought the film was getting a little dull in one spot, thought about it for awhile, then suggested, ""HOW ABOUT A RAPE SCENE?"" Said scene was quickly written & shot, at the objection of Peter Cushing, who felt it not only offensive, but not properly built up to, plot-wise. Someone agreed, as it was cut from all original release prints.  But its noteriety was such, apparently, that it's been restored to the latest prints (just as 5 different offending scenes were eventually restored to the 1931 FRANKENSTEIN).

The plot is one of those ""rat-maze"" affairs, as characters are trapped in a bad siaution that just keeps getting worse, and the audience is forced to suffer thru one horror after another for an hour and 40 minutes... before the climax, which almost makes it worthwhile! In a sequence that only now reminds me of the climax of HALLOWEEN 5, the overweight, balding character (the creature) lures his intended victim to a large house. But where Dr. Loomis wanted only to capture Michael Myers, here, nothing less than the DEATH of the Baron will suffice. In true Roger Coman tradition (which also goes back to the 1931 FRANKENSTEIN!), before you know it, the house is ablaze.  Somehow, the Baron escapes... only to be stopped by a vengeful (if completely inept) Simon Ward, who's kicked aside by the creature. Then, hefting the Baron over his shoulder, he walks, straight back INTO THE FIRE, the Baron screaming ""No! NOOOOO!!!!"" the whole way.  The first time I saw this, I stood up and CHEERED as the end credits rolled! The whole time, I was thinking, it was TOO GOOD for him!

Love it or hate it, this is one not to be missed.",1180051200,2,5041,4.947990543735225
105080,5,0790736063,"Hammer did 7 Frankenstein films from the late 50s to early 70s:

The Curse of Frankenstein (1957)

The Revenge of Frankenstein (1958)

The Evil of Frankenstein (1964)

Frankenstein Created Woman (1967)

Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed (1969)

The Horror of Frankenstein (1970)

Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell (1973)

Peter Cushing played Baron Frankenstein in every one of these except ""The Horror of Frankenstein"" because it was a remake of the original story and they needed a much younger actor to play the role; they chose Ralph Bates (who superbly played the love-to-hate OTT satanist in ""Taste the Blood of Dracula"" released the same year).

In any event, we all know the basic Frankenstein story: A mad scientist is obsessed with creating life from an assortment of body parts. Eventually he succeeds and his creation goes on a killing spree, although the creature is nice to kids 'cause they're innocent. Ultimately the monster must be destroyed (and the Baron usually goes with him).

Ho Hum. Forgive me if this basic plot no longer trips my trigger. Thankfully, I recently saw a couple of Frankenstein flicks that stirred my interest in this age-old predictable story.

Hammer's ""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed"" from 1969 was, as noted, the fifth film in their 7-film Frankenstein series. THE PLOT: Baron Frankenstein is a fugitive who goes by a different name but is intent on continuing his gruesome work. He ultimately blackmails a young couple in assisting him. They steal a patient from the local insane asylum and successfully transplant his brain into another body, curing his madness.

The film is highlighted by Veronica Carlson, who looks a lot like Ursula Andress, but possibly even more beautiful (if you can imagine that).

FINAL ANALYSIS: ""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed"" is one of the best Frankenstein flicks I've seen. It's creative, labyrinthian and full of pizazz. Being a sequel, the film retains the essential elements of the original story but is a natural progression. The REAL monster in this picture is Baron Frankenstein himself; he's no longer a basically good person obsessed with creating life from corpses. His obsession has defiled him to the point of enmity, hate, arrogance, violence, rape and murder.

Another great 70's Frankenstein film is the Italian ""Lady Frankenstein"" from 1971, which starred Rosalba Neri (AKA Sara Bey) as the Baron's daughter who overtakes his work after his death. See my review for details.

105081,5,0790736063,"The fifth entry in Hammer's Frankenstein series, FRANKENSTEIN MUST BE DESTROYED, is probably the best.  Director Terence Fisher thought so as well.

The plot has been well-covered by other reviewers, so I won't bother rehashing it.  The acting in this movie from the whole cast is top notch.  Peter Cushing is great as usual and he really pulls off Frankenstein's split personas: the charming public figure and the cold, ruthless madman.  Simon Ward and Veronica Carlson are both good as the young couple held captive by Frankenstein's demands.  Thorley Walters is an amusing police inspector.  And Freddie Jones is great as the ""creature,"" a once insane scientist cured but trapped in a body that's not his.

Terence Fisher was a great horror director and three sequences in this film rank among his best: the opening with the Hitchcockian beheading sequence, followed by the scene where Frankenstein unmasks himself (that shot in particular is great); the scene where the watermain bursts and the dead Dr. Brandt's hand is forced up causing poor Anna (Carlson) to hide it; and the final confrontation between the Baron and his unwitting creation.

Warner Brothers' DVD is far from a deluxe edition but it'll do.  The widescreen transfer looks great, much better than the old VHS I had.  The only extra is the trailer, but those old trailers were so much fun than what we have today.

Anyone who is a fan of Peter Cushing or Hammer's horror films must get this DVD.  You will not be disappointed.",1159142400,4,1497,4.892857142857143
105082,4,0790736063,"The fifth entry in Hammer Productions' ""Frankenstein"" franchise, FRANKENSTEIN MUST BE DESTROYED again stars Peter Cushing as the malevolent Baron Frankenstein.  A boarding house in the heart of the city, owned by lovely Anna Spengler (Veronica Carlson) becomes the setting for the Baron's next experiment in terror.  He forces Anna and her young fiancee, Dr. Karl Holst (Simon Ward) to assist him in transplanting the brain of his former partner Dr. Brandt (now a raving lunatic in an asylum) into the body of another unwilling participant, Professor Richtor (Freddie Jones).  The operation is carried off without a hitch, and the body of Brandt is buried in the vegetable garden...but when a burst water-main exposes the corpse, Anna and Karl are hurled headlong into a terrifying ordeal where their fates are controlled by the evil Baron.

Cushing's Baron is even more chilling and callous than usual in this entry of the series, and the performances of Veronica Carlson and Simon Ward as the bewildered young lovers are equally fine.  Freddie Jones is memorable playing the most sympathatic of Frankenstein's creations.

A Hammer films mainstay, Veronica Carlson would appear in the next sequel (""The Horror of Frankenstein"") playing a different character; and also played the ingenue in ""Dracula Has Risen from the Grave"".

105083,5,0790736063,"Frankenstein's last few failures must have really pissed him off, coz in this film Frankenstein is just plain wicked.  Sure, he's always been obsessed, mad, and at times, homicidal, but in this film he's just cold blooded through and through.  This goes to show how good of an actor Cushing is because he can play this to the friggin hilt!  It was always difficult not to like Frankenstein even if he was doing something evil coz Cushing was so charming.  This is the first time you'll be rooting for everyone else in the film to stop him.  I loved this change in the series.  It kinda makes sense too that the doctor would get worse and worse as the years go by.  He even rapes a woman!  Cushing raping a woman??  Never before could you imagine the man even thinking about sex, let alone indulging in it!  Considering the film was done in 69, the gore is upped a little as well, and that's fine and dandy with me.  The plot revolves around Cushing blackmailing a young couple to help him breakout an old colleague of his so he can learn once and for all how to successfully transplant a brain.  There really isn't a ""monster"" this time around, just a doctor with a new body.  You're instantly on this doctor's side too coz he's a cool guy(played by the great character actor Freddie Jones).  The ""monster"" of the film is definately Frankenstein himself.  Watching this, you get the idea that this was intended to be the last of the Hammer series, but worry not!  Hammer managed two more Frankenstein flicks, one with Cushing and one without.  I'd personally say Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed is without a doubt one of the very best of the series.",1126915200,3,1648,4.513513513513513
105094,4,0790736063,"Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed represents one of Hammer's most delicately crafted productions. Production values are above par. Bert Batt and Anthony Nelson-Keys deliver an excellent script. Arthur Grant's photography, James Bernard's score and Terence Fisher's direction are all exemplary. The talented cast includes Peter Cushing in one of his greatest performances, an amusing Thorley Walters and an early appearance from Freddie Jones, as the screen's most tragic and pitiful Frankenstein's ""monster"" since Christopher Lee (1957) if not Boris Karloff (1931).

Central to the film is a pervasive irony: The irony of a man whose everyday manners are impeccable and gentlemanly, but whose total contempt for human life will lead him to murder and rape without a second thought; the irony of a man given back life only to be cheated out of the one thing in life he loves. Never is this irony more clearly captured than in the very first scene, in which a lilting ballad accompanies a beheading, or (a few scenes later) the quick cut from Anna's words, ""You'll find it very quiet here,"" to a screaming patient in an insane asylum (a surprisingly effective shock moment).

Baron Frankenstein here is no longer the ambiguous anti-hero of sorts that he was in Hammer's previous Frankenstein outings (excepting The Evil of Frankenstein). In Fisher's Hitchcockian opening sequence the camera follows a pair of black and white shoes, suggesting a certain ambiguity, as they make their way through the Victorian streets, but when the owner of the shoes (having just committed one murder and an attempted murder) tears off his hideous mask, it is revealed to be none other than Frankenstein himself. Now the Baron is clearly the monster, and it is he who must be destroyed.

The Baron here takes on god-like dimensions like never before. In Fisher's series there were always clear allusions to the wrongness of the Baron's attempts to usurp the place of God; here Frankenstein's spiral of descent into degeneracy, tyranny and blasphemy is complete. With great command, he exerts an almost supernatural force over the two young lovers he blackmails into assisting him in his experiment.

The first hint of his demise is towards the end of the film when Karl (Simon Ward) watches him, unbeknownst to the Baron, and discovers his plans, which information he then uses to foil the Baron. Thus for the first time, the shoe is on the other foot: Frankenstein is no longer in control, and his destruction is imminent.

His destruction is one of the film's finest sequences. The shoe really is on the other foot now: ""I fancy... that I am the spider and you are the fly,"" says the creature. Frankenstein is trapped inside a burning house with the police waiting outside. In the words of his creation, he must choose between ""the police and the flames."" The implication is clear: Even if Frankenstein manages to evade human justice, ""the flames"" (a symbol of divine judgment) are totally inescapable. In a finale that harks back to Mary Shelley's original novel, the embittered creature himself carries his creator with him to their shared fate.

Other fine sequences include the water-pipe bursting, forcing the cadaver of one of the Baron's victims to resurface, as well as the forceful scene in which Professor Richter, transplanted into the body of Freddie Jones, and hidden behind a screen, pleads with his frightened wife to believe his story.

105096,4,0790736063,"The UK studio Hammer films did the horror genre a big favor when they bought the rights to the old classic Universal Studio movies and then introduced us to the delights of such things as Christopher Lee as Count Dracula and Peter Cushing as Dr. Victor Frankenstein.  They went on to produce an entire series of Dracula and Frankenstein movies as well as the occasional mummy movie and others.  The Dracula series peaked with the excellent Dracula Has Risen from the Grave and the Frankenstein series peaked at about the same time with this equally excellent movie Frankenstein Must be Destroyed.  Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory is inadvertently discovered and he is forced to abandon everything and move to another location to start all over again.  He moves to a new city where he takes up residence in a nice boarding house owned and managed by gorgeous blonde Hammer glamour girl Veronica Carlson whose fiance is a young doctor who works at an insane asylum.  It happens that this is the same asylum where a former colleague of Frankenstein's is now committed following a mental breakdown caused by the strain of his work combined with the hostility of the medical establishment to their extremely advanced concepts of brain transplants, etc.  When Frankenstein discovers that Veronica and the young doctor have been supplementing their income by selling narcotics stolen from the asylum he uses the information to blackmail them into becoming his accomplices.  He plans to break his former colleague out of the asylum and then cure his insanity so that he can retrieve vital information which will save him years of experimentation.  Mary Shelley created a Victor Frankenstein that is a tragic character, a modern prometheus, a young and naive scientist who lets yet another powerful and dangerous genie out of the bottle and then ends up trying to cope with the consequences.  In stark contrast, Peter Cushing's character is a brilliant, mature, worldly, and cultured man who is proceeding entirely with his eyes wide open.  At the same time, he is an utterly ruthless man, driven relentlessly by the ambition for more scientific knowledge and power, who will stop at nothing to get what he wants.  He commits numerous felonies including several murders without any hesitation or remorse whatsoever.  The monster he creates this time has the mind of a fellow doctor and scientist.  The monster has become the tragic character, an intelligent and gentle man who returns from the anguish of insanity only to be rejected as a hideous stranger by his beloved wife.

Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

Baron Frankenstein (Peter Cushing) blackmails a young medical student (Simon Ward) and his fiancee (Veronica Carlson) into helping him with a brain transplant which goes horribly wrong.

Following a long period of cheap-looking productions designed to play as double-features on their home turf, Hammer returned to premium quality horror with FRANKENSTEIN MUST BE DESTROYED, arguably the company's finest hour, and certainly Peter Cushing's definitive portrayal of the monstrous Baron. Instead of the misguided adventurer depicted in previous films, screenwriter Bert Batt emphasizes the Baron's ruthless pursuit of knowledge and power, culminating in an unexpected sequence in which Cushing's domination of Carlson segues from mere tyranny to rape, a scene which Cushing reportedly found distasteful. Overall, however, Batt's script allows the characters to evolve via a skilfully constructed plot which employs levels of drama and emotion largely absent from much of Hammer's output at the time, alongside the usual elements of horror and suspense. Director Terence Fisher rises to the occasion with remarkable dexterity, orchestrating set-pieces which have been compared to Hitchcock in some quarters, especially the opening sequence in which a petty thief (Harold Goodwin) breaks into the wrong house and has a truly hair-raising confrontation with its volatile owner (leading to a truly great 'reveal'); and the traumatic moment in the back garden of Carlson's boarding house, when she's forced to deal with a corpse (one of Frankenstein's cast-offs) ejected from its makeshift grave by a burst water pipe.

Freddie Jones adds pathos to the proceedings as the helpless victim of Frankenstein's latest experiment, his brain transplanted into another man's body against his will, traumatizing his incredulous wife (Maxine Audley) who refuses to accept his new identity (a scenario echoed by a similar plotline in John Woo's FACE/OFF in 1997). The period decor may look a little cramped and cut-price in places, but this is Hammer/Fisher/Cushing at the very height of their creative powers, and the film is a small masterpiece of British Gothic.",1085443200,25,2242,5.621301775147929
105099,5,0790736063,"This is one of Hammer's very best productions as well as their best Frankenstein film.  Peter Cushing is wonderful as the Baron, more ruthless and sadistic this time out--he stops at nothing to get his way.  The supporting cast of Veronica Carlson, Simon Ward and Freddie Jones are excellent.  And the fiery cat and mouse finale is a total knockout--the best finale in the Hammer canon.
Warner's DVD is excellent.  Picture and sound are sharp and robust.  The 1.85:1 framing seems perfectly accurate.  Theatrical trailer included.",1082937600,3,530,5.104651162790698
105100,3,0790736063,"In this episode of Frankenstein the baron has become so obsessed  with his own hatred and anger that the character loses much of the dimension from the previous films.  He murders without hesitation, blackmails a young couple into assisting his work and brutaly rapes the woman.  The violence of this movie distracts somewhat from plot and character development.  The treatment of the creature is much more sympathetic- he is a human victim of the Baron and not a monster. The film has some entertainment merit but is not for the weak of heart.",1035504000,,544,4.817204301075269
105101,3,0790736063,"This could have been a five-star entry into Hammer's Frankenstein series--one which I consider superior to the one produced by Universal. But, unfortunately, the portrayal of the central character, Baron Frankenstein, is off when compared to other entries in the series, particularly high-points like ""Curse of Frankenstein"" and ""Frankenstein Created Woman.""
In those films, there was something twistly heroic about Frankenstein... one almost finds oneself hoping he'll succeed. But here, he is just a vicious killer, a brutal rapist, a creature with no redeeming qualities safe for the inherent charm of Peter Cushing, the actor who portrays him.
The tale has Frankenstein blackmail a crooked doctor at a local asylum into giving him access to a mad scientist so
Frankenstein can cure the madness through brain surgery. The corruption of Frankenstein and the crooked doctor spread to engulf the doctor's otherwise innocent fiance. On the very night of Frankenstein's seeming triumph, everyone ends up paying for their crimes, including Frankenstein himself.
The ""morality play"" aspect of this film works extremely well. What doesn't work is Frankenstein's completely monstrous nature. And it's made worse by the brutal rape he visits upon Victoria Carlson (who gives what is probably her best performance in this film). It's a shame really that the central character should be so off in the way he was written.",1012521600,3,1411,5.389140271493213
105102,5,0790736063,"In this one the Baron goes way past insane in an effort to regain secrets lost in the mind of a mad man. Frankenstein stops at nothing, blackmail, rape, theft and of course murder in this masterpiece from Hammer Studios. A new twist for the twisted Dr. My only question is, where is the DVD???",1012003200,,293,4.345454545454546
7791310,4,0790736063,"This is a pretty good Hammer Production. This version of Frankenstein shows a different sort of Dr. Frankenstein. Once again Peter Cushing does an excellent job of acting, showing a Brilliant Doctor, but lacking the moral bases that make us human. Cushing shows a diabolical side to Dr. Frankenstein's personality. This is certainly a completely different version of any Frankenstein stories you might have seen.  If you like old Hammer films you will certainly like this one.",1517270400,,476,5.181818181818182
7791311,5,0790736063,"If you are a fan of this movie, you have to get this on Blu-ray. It looks really good on the Ultra 4K TV and sounds good as well. Peter Cushing stars as Baron Frankenstein who seeks out to finish his experiments on human brain transplants. Starring the lovely Veronica Carlson (Dracula Has Risen From The Grave), her and her husband are bound to ""Frankenstein"" for deeds they have been committing on the side with illegal drug deals.
The Baron knows this and uses this to his full advantage, for the time being. Things get tense once the police ""catch on"" to the murders associated with the Doctor's experiments.

7791312,5,0790736063,"I thought I saw them all, but I missed this one.  This is the first in which Dr. Frankenstein is portrayed as a ""bad person"" even raping a servant/girlfriend of his partner.  That was a shock for me, but made for an unusual DVD in my mix. I liked the plot and the more sinister take on Dr. Frankenstein.  The resolution was nicely done.  After it dawns on you how sinister Dr. Frankenstein has become, the title of ""Frankenstein Must be Destroyed"" makes sense. It didn't at first. It's not the monster that must be destroyed. The monster is nicer. It is Dr. Frankenstein. I read that Peter Cushing didn't like the rape scene he was forced to do.",1502582400,2,645,4.394957983193278
7791313,5,0790736063,"If he had one to begin with. Peter Cushing in this variation on the Frankenstein legend is more ruthless than ever. The first thing we see here is the Baron lopping some poor guy's head off & carrying the head back to his lab--a lab with more than a few corpses in it. And, the somewhat infamous ""rape"" scene. It seems the good Doctor has lost all moral code in this film.

The motivation for the Baron this time is brain transplants & getting a secret formula from an old colleague. The surgery--of course--is a success, but this time, Frankenstein's subject is neither a ""creature"" or ""monster."" But rather a somewhat sympathetic figure looking for revenge for what has been done to him. This sets up the great, fiery climax where Frankenstein is indeed destroyed.

Honorable mention also to Veronica Carlson, looking absolutey stunning throughout the whole movie. Another great Hammer feature....",1499299200,,899,4.907894736842105

7791316,4,0790736063,"I love this movie. The Baron is full on villain, his accomplices completely sympathetic, and the costumes and sets are awesome. The script is great. The ending is great. One problem: SPOILERS: that rape scene. It's helpful to know that everyone, from the director to the writers to BOTH actors involved, heartily objected. The producer leaned on them to sex it up for American audiences. The result is a 3 minute loop of fabric ripping, horrific screaming, and general uncomfortableness....because it's never mentioned or addressed again. It literally feels like a deleted scene just dropped in, slowing down the action in the back half of the film. We already know Frankenstein is a cad from Curse of Frankenstein, but the implication or threat would have gone way farther than the end result, which is two obviously unhappy actors doing the absolute bare minimum. But! Otherwise, this movie is so much fun.",1486598400,2,908,5.0198675496688745
