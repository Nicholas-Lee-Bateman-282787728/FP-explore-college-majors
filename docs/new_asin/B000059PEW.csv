1409571,5,B000059PEW,Totally absorbing play.  Saw it on Play of the Week in the early 60s and never forgot it.  Robard's portrayal of Hickey is probably the best acting I have ever witnessed.  The weakest acting in the play is from a very young Robert Redford who had not yet sufficiently developed his skills.,1126396800,6,289,4.519230769230769
1409572,5,B000059PEW,"I don't need to add superlatives to Robard's signature performance in the role of Hickey. Instead I want to mention a scene in Act 2 (first cassette of the vcr version) between Larry Slade (Myron McCormick) and Don Parrit (Robert Redford).

The bums are starting to gather for Harry's birthday, and Parrit makes his way to Larry's table, where he tells him of Hickey's hounding him. The camera is close on the two men at the table; Larry, suspecting the worst, does not want to listen as Parrit repeats what Hickey has been saying to him about guilt and admitting the truth. In the background, Cora, one of the 'tarts' is practicing ""The Sweetheart Of Paradise Alley"" to sing for Harry, in a sweet, halting voice.

It is an absloutely stunning scene, and Redford somehow makes it believable that he has remembered all that Hickey has said to him: ""what did he mean by that, Larry?"" he keeps asking McCormick, who can't bear to look him in the eye.

The play itself is embedded with such scenic images, where characters, and dialog, and setting, and antiphonal voices communicate the essence of longing or hope or dispair or delusion or faith or enmity -- the complete range of human emotion and experience. All of this realized in this production.

Another dimension that comes across in this production is the role of women in the lives of men. The three tarts in the play comically and pathetically balance three offstage women who haunt the play: Parrit's mother, Harry Hope's Bessy, and Hickey's Evelyn.",1092096000,22,1507,4.762452107279693

1409574,5,B000059PEW,"All you have to do is look at the artists involved in this production to realize the landmark importance of this staging. Robards, considered the quintessential interpreter of O'Neill, reprises the role that first caused critics to sit up and take notice that a major league actor had arrived on Broadway. O'Neill roles were more like autobiographies for Robards. He faced the same alcohol-induced demons in real life as confronted such characters as Hickey and James Tyrone.

  Though Lumet may not be in the same league as Jose Quintero as far as O'Neill directors are concerned, he nevertheless wrings solid performances out of every cast member involved in this historic production.
  If you can, you may want to purchase this in conjunction with the 1976 Broadway Archive tape of William Saroyan's ""The Time of Your Life."" Both plays have similar bar room settings, about the same size cast, and similar themes. It's interesting to see how two major playwright's handle diologue and monologue, dramatic conflict and themes of dissipation. Personally, I've always felt O'Neill digs a lot deeper than Saroyan, but both productions are superb, as are most plays in the Broadway Theater Archive series.",1046304000,17,1203,5.148717948717949
1409575,5,B000059PEW,"About 17 years ago I was fortunate enough to see Jason Robards perform the part of Hicky live, in Los Angeles.  Needless to say, it was a riveting 5+ hours of theatre.  I knew about this televised version from readings, but had never seen it - until now.  It's almost as good as being there!  Purests might be upset that the script IS cut - but as much as I love O'Neill, I didn't really miss the cut sections. (Much as with Lumet's ""cut"" version of ""Long Day's Journey"").  In fact, this version may actually be more palitable to the less ""hard core"" watchers.  Interesting to see Robert Redford's rather lackluster performance; he may be the weak link in the supporting cast.  In any case, a MUST for any student of the theater!",1043971200,15,729,4.43609022556391

I rented this one not long ago and sat through its
mammoth performance straight.  This broadcast from
the end of the live television era reaps the benefits
of everything that was developed in that art form's
brief lifespan.  'Iceman' practically hums with the
energy, dedication and craft of its performers.  It
is just plain exciting to watch.
I've never been too big a fan of Eugene O'Neil and
his (from today's vantage point) rather overworked
writing style, but I was grateful that 'Iceman' was
as long as it was, and that it permitted me as much
time with its excellent stage actors as it did.  Their
work, and the earnest compassion of O'Neil's writing,
are to be savoured.  In comparison to today's diet
of ego-rich, hype-rich, ironic-rich, style-rich, but
often craft-deprived efforts--faults evident even
within the independent film scene--'Iceman' is an
electric piece of work.
Jason Robards is terrific, one of my favorites.  Now
if only they'd release 'A Thousand Clowns' on DVD.",1040342400,11,1009,5.048192771084337
1409577,5,B000059PEW,"I just got this DVD, and I'm here to tell you that it is the actual 'live television' essence: a digitally remastered 1960 videotape broadcast of the play which celebrated Eugene O'Neill and introduced Jason Robards. What you see isn't a film (though the introduction by Worthington Miner looks a bit 'kinescopic'); it is an approximation of early 2-inch videotape, which was still fairly new back then. Because it is tape and not film, it reads and moves as a play, which makes the central performances by Robards and McCormick all the more shattering. It *is* over 4 hours, but it is worth every penny.",1037232000,8,604,4.761904761904762

He can be watched over and over again, so this video has my bet as a good one to shell out for and own.  Robards was also filmed playing Jamie in Long Day's Journey Into Night (with Hepburn and Ralph Richardson) and in a recording of O'Neill's short play, Hughie (somebody please bring that back in print!)- in both he's excellent.
Some of the supporting cast are pretty good, but oddly (or no?) the one weak performance, in my view, is a very young Robert Redford as the young whimpering blackguard, Parrit.",1017100800,9,779,4.762962962962963
1409579,4,B000059PEW,"This filmed version of one of the most famous of all American stage plays contains dynamite performances from Jason Robarts as Hickey, a jovial if drunken traveling salesman, and from a young Robert Redford as Don Parritt, the troubled son of a dogmatic and free-loving anarchist woman (who does not appear in the play).  The character of Larry, an ex-anarchist philosopher, however, didn't reach its potential; Larry is arguably the most central character but seemed muted in this film.  Most supporting actors, however, are excellent.  The viewer should know that the presentation is somewhat reduced from the original 4-1/2 hour script.  The black-and-white film and crude set enhance the passion of this tragic work by the tortured Eugene O'Neill.

This performance of the complete ""Iceman Cometh"" was originally aired on CBS in 1962, as a live two-part performance, and the video and audio quality suffer from the transferral, but what remains is an extremely well-directed version of this play, which preserves Robards in the role that first brought him acclaim.  The supporting cast in generaly excellent, with standout performances from James Broderick and a very young Robert Redford.  This version of the play makes an interesting contrast to the 1973 film version, directed by John Frankenheimer, which features a decent, though limted, Lee Marvin as Hickey, but which also displays two incredible actors, Robert Ryan as Larry, and Frederick March as Harry Hope, who are so wonderful in their final screen roles that they overshadow the rest of the characters, Hickey included.  One can only lament the director's choice not to cast Robards, thus missing the opportunity to unite three of the greatest O'Neill interpreters in these three splendid roles.

I have just always found the play to be too improbable. For reasonably intelligent characters to be so extremely self-delusion stretches the bounds of credulity. And for Hickey, in spite of being a master salesman, to be capable of manipulating every character to such a large extent seems far too unlikely. In the real world, one or more of the victims of Hickey's cajoling would have eventually gotten fed up, grabbed him by the back of the collar, and thrown him out of the door.

1409597,4,B000059PEW,"The Iceman Cometh is a contender for being, and it is my personal pick for, the Great American Play.  Its freighted central premise is that mankind cannot live without deep personal illusions - pipe dreams - that each of the characters can recognize in others but not in himself.  Facing the truth leads not to liberation, but to spiritual death and despair - complete emotional paralysis and collapse. All the action takes place in 1912 in Harry Hope's saloon smack dab in the middle of Tammany Hall corruption of which the aging Hope was long ago a peripheral player.  The characters - ex-cops and socialists, former newsmen and military men, bartenders, pimps and hookers - are all portrayed with both a gritty realism yet tenderness that reflects O'Neill's refusal to pass judgment on human frailty.  Into this atmospheric haze of drunken self-deception strides like a behemoth one Theodore Hickey, a good-time merchandise drummer liked and loved by them all, but now a self-declared convert to the truth who declares that he has cast aside all his pipe dreams, liberated himself, and with missionary zeal is determined to share his good fortune with all the others by bringing them the same peace he claims to have found.  It should not betray too much to say that Hickey, the play's core, has only inveigled himself deeper into self-deception.  The play's only structural weakness is that O'Neill clearly wants to say something about all humanity, but in being forced to write what he knew best, wrote only of barflies, alcoholics and patent losers so that it is far too easy to dismiss his message as being about them, but not ourselves, the literate readers or audience of Iceman.

The theatrical production runs five hours and it is all but impossible to find a live production of it even in major metropolitan centers, so aside from the enormous pleasure of reading the text and imagining the play as it was intended - which I strongly recommend in any case - there are only the 1960 Broadway Theater Archive (BTA) and the 1973 American Film Theater (AFT) productions available.  If you were forced to choose, then the BTA production with Jason Robards as Hickey is the one to watch, despite its being pared down to little more than three hours so that some of the understanding of and affection for the minor characters is lost.  Robards and director Sidney Lumet grasp that at his core Hickey is a charmer and a salesman, holding himself to be no better than others and happy to wallow and cavort in the mud with them with the blessed relief of not having to pretend to be better than he is.  Hickey sees everyone else's pipe dreams and plays to them so surely and instinctively as a fish swims in water that he is loved by all who await his arrival for Harry Hope's 60th birthday celebration.  The havoc Hickey wreaks in stripping illusions from his brethren occurs despite himself, causes him pain and distress, and is tinctured with the true believer's conviction that all the pain is only in transition.  Hickey's own vulnerability while proselytizing is essential to the performance: unless he can convert the others to the peace he claims to enjoy his own alleged peace stands in doubt.  This dynamic creates an almost perfect opportunity for the subtlest and deepest interactions among the performers whose words, gestures, facial expressions and hesitations must reflect the multiple layers of the drama enacted and unfolding.  Robards does this magnificently and would be a tough act to follow in any case.

Unhappily, the central defect with the AFT production was not Lee Marvin's failure to measure up to Robard's Hickey, but an utter failure on Marvin's part to understand his character and the unfortunate and harder to understand failure of director John Frankenheimer to set his actor on the character's proper course.  There are long, unnerving, and quite puzzling interludes with Hickey present during which the assembly of fine actors seems simply to be waiting for others to finish in order to say their lines.  The reason that they are unable to do better is that they are acting their parts in the Iceman while Marvin is not, and probably cannot.  Perhaps Frankenheimer tried to do more with Marvin but reconciled himself to not having a silk purse.  I suspect that Marvin was given this role to show the range and depth of his talent and this range and depth turned out to be considerably less than any could have imagined.

Instead of playing Hickey as a charmer and missionary salesman, Marvin plays him like a tough-guy cop trying to beat a confession out of his victims: by god they are going to face the truth and like it even if it hurts.  Instead of the promise of liberation and peace that Robard's Hickey offers, Marvin's pushes their faces into it as though he were potty training a puppy by rubbing its nose cruelly, until it can hardly breath, into just the mess he or she has made here!  With Marvin the words of empathy for the suffering he causes sound like lip service rather than compassion and more than once you may find yourself asking how or why this saloon full of lushes could ever have loved this Hickey as they did.  Where Robards lays on a healing balm, Marvin demands a stiff upper lip. Hickey's major soliloquy is couched in loving sentiment until its end when a vital angry truth escapes him and lays him low, but Marvin's rendition is so full of uncontrolled rage and venom that it leaves no room for surprise or contrast when it finishes, gutting so much of the play's force.

Still, if you can stand the sensation of listening to fingernails scratch the blackboard when Marvin's Hickey is in play, the AFT versions offers a magnificent performance by Robert Ryan as Larry Slade, the former anarchist and self-declared fence-sitter who strives to remain detached from humanity's struggles even while still being deeply affected by them.  The AFT DVD cover identifies Ryan's major prior roles in ""The Wild Bunch"" and ""The Dirty Dozen,"" both the kind of violent action films that seem to be in Marvin's DNA.  But in Iceman, when Hickey is on the sideline, there are breathtaking stretches in which others talk and Ryan, playing the hollowed-out Slade, listens while his face flickers with a Buddha-like humanity that makes one want to cry.  The Richard Gere of ""Pretty Woman"" has traveled a similarly long road from Hollywood schlock to the deeper humanity found in his performance of the eviscerated cop of ""Brooklyn's Finest"" who long ago lost any connection with ideals that once gave life meaning and yet has to struggle on in a life without them.  Ryan's performance alone - and there are other treats as well such as Tom Pedi's reprise of his BTA role as bartender Rocky - may be worth the price of admission.

This very adult adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's THE ICEMAN COMETH is a two-part television special originally broadcast on the CBS network in 1960. Directed by Sidney Lumet, it aired two weeks apart, from 10:30 pm Eastern time to 12:30 am.

Set in the 20th Century's second decade, ""Iceman"" stars Jason Robards Jr., in a recreation of his Tony-winning role of Theodore 'Hickey' Hickman, a traveling salesman who comes twice a year to a dead end Bowery tavern owned by Harry (the Hat) Hope (Farrell Pelly). Harry's a small time philanthropist who supports and shelters a number of alkies and tarts. Co-star is Myron McCormick as Larry Slade, a disillusioned Red who publicly says he awaits the peace of death, but privately fears the darkness of eternity.

Robert Redford is Don Parritt, a young man who knew Larry when he lived with his mother on the West Coast, back when Larry was still involved with the ""movement."" We guess, based on physical resemblance, that Larry is Don's father, but it's never verified. It is clear though that Don's mom was a prostitute. One of the story's dramatic revelations is that he betrayed her after a terrorist bombing, and she's now in jail.

There's a variety of other characters.

An Italian-American bartender named Rocky Pioggi (Tom Pedi) is a part-time pimp to a couple of tarts** that also hang around for free lunch and drinks on Harry. The General (Roland Winters) and the Captain (Roland Radd) were foes in the Boer War, the General on the farmers' side, the Captain a British officer. They spend their conscious moments arguing about the long-gone war. Jimmy Tomorrow (Harrison Dowd) was a newspaper correspondent during that struggle. When his wife left him for a sober officer, Jimmy used it as an excuse to stay permanently stinko.

Willie Oban (James Broderick) is a Harvard law school failure who still dreams of trying a case. Hugo Kalmar (Sorrell Booke) is a Dutch Uncle-accented pal of Larry's; they were once comrades in the movement, where Hugo edited articles for a radical paper. His reasons for insobriety are unclear, for Hugo is mostly passed out from booze. Chuck Morello (Michael Strong), Harry's daytime bartender, is always blowing smoke about marrying one of the tarts, Cora (Joan Copeland). **The other two are Margie (Hilda Brawner) and Pearl (Julie Bovasso).

Joe Mott (Maxwell Glanville) is this motley group's only man of color. Joe used to own a Harlem gambling joint and thinks he will again one day. For now he's reduced to sweeping floors for Harry. Ed Mosher (Walter Klavun) and Pat McGloin (Charles White) are drinking companions. Ed, a fired circus man, is Harry's brother-in-law. Pat is a disgraced cop. Both dream of getting their jobs back. A main theme of the play is pipe dreams such as Harry's. He hasn't left the bar in 20 years, not since his wife died. Harry thinks someday he's gonna take that walk around the ward and visit old pals.

When Hickey shows up to finance Harry's 60s birthday bash, he's not the party animal of the past. Hickey is here to proselytize his new religion: no more pipe dreams, no more ""I'll do it tomorrow."" There's a reason for Hickey's fervent conversion, but before we learn what it is, he convinces Harry and the barflies to end the procrastination and ACT on their dreams. All of them try to, all but Larry, who's either too jaundiced or too smart to fall for Hickey's line of bull. Meanwhile Don confesses his sin of betraying his own mom to Larry, who tells Don to kill himself if he can't live with it.

Before this moment and as Don is obviously becoming unglued, Larry goads the now unbearable Hickey into revealing some details of his own wife's recent death. Hickey explains the bullet in her brain wasn't suicide but murder and adds that soon the police will know who the killer is....

Paul Giamatti did a ""Jimmy Tomorrow"" on Broadway that stole this version's thunder(to me at least). And a couple have produced an engaging Hickey. They've even been superb (Kevin Spacey was my other favorite Hickey; same charisma with a touch of danger). This is a long piece to be sure. But Robards still rules. And the wordy play in the hands of this dynamic cast (surprises await) the hours fly by. I could go on (and have) for hours about this play - and this production. Just get it.

1409607,5,B000059PEW,"In the Golden Age of Television, there were some productions which became instantly legendary. Some have (unfortunately) disappeared; others are making their way back into the public eye, thanks to enterprises like the Broadway Theater Archive. And so this famous production of O'Neill's THE ICEMAN COMETH, directed by Sidney Lumet, has been available, and it remains a revelation.

The power of O'Neill's writing, rendered with conviction and total empathy by the impeccable cast, is overwhelming. And Jason Robards justifies all the claims of his greatness as the quintessential O'Neill interpreter. With this production, his role in LONG DAY'S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT and A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN, Robards made his claim as the premier O'Neill actor, a claim which has not yet been disputed. Here, as Hickey, he brings so much dread and horror, yet also so much humor and brashness, that Hickey becomes totally mythic, a man who has set out to live out an extreme truth, because he has faced life and found it intolerable.

In terms of the production: the production values were skimpy at best, and the visual quality... who are we kidding? There is no visual quality! But there is great energy and pacing, and Lumet shows some of his talent for unleashing the resources of his actors. So many of the actors, for years afterwards, remained so associated with their roles here that it was often a shock to see them in other work. For all its shortcomings as an audiovisual work, as a record of one of the classic theater events of the 1950s, this DVD is invaluable.",1209945600,3,1564,4.89811320754717

Very little action, lots of drinking, lots of dreaming, lots philosophizing and in a low down gin mill to boot doesn't sound like the makings of a great American play. But, it is. This thing turns into a microcosm of American society in the early part of the 20th century. Between shots of whiskey and beer the denizens of this small work exhibit all the emotions, contradictions, fear of failure, fear of success, fear of life that the rest of us `normals' have to face. Except, for dramatic effect, those flophouse devotees get their noses rubbed in it by one Harry Hickey- traveling salesman, former chief denizen who now has got `religion' and wants to spread his newfound  `glad tidings'. Spare us from the Hickeys of the world-a little dreaminess and a couple of illusions never hurt anyone. Did they? Although in O'Neill's hands the dialogue is a little stilted and the characters are a little stereotyped and wooden the point he is trying to make gets across just fine.  This is a must read on your American drama list. Needless to say Jason Robards as elsewhere in O'Neill's work defines the role of Harry Hickey",1182297600,2,1270,4.64

His portrayal of Jamie in ""Long Day's Journey..."" was also incredible. It brings tears to my eyes.

Robards' interpretation of the dispossessed strikes a cord deep within that you might find hard to listen to.

I wasn't around when he gave his performances of these two O'Neill plays in 1956-58 but I am so glad someone had the good sense to capture the ""staged"" production of ""Iceman"" on celuloid. If only ""Long Day's journey..."" were similarly captured.",1153353600,7,816,4.891304347826087

The bad news about the Broadway Theater Archive DVD (originally released as a teleplay by CBS in 1960) is that its production values are primitive.  The good news is that this Sidney Lumet television version is based on Jose Quintero's definitive 1956 Broadway production.  The best news is that Jason Robards reprises his Broadway role as Hickey.

The setting is Harry Hope's saloon, and the year is 1912.  Harry's regulars, a diverse lot of misfits and failures, spend their days drinking and dreaming of the things they're going to do when they get right again.  Into their midst bursts the drummer Hickey, right on time for his annual bender.  But this year Hickey's different.  He's not drinking; he's not making his usual jokes about finding his wife in bed with the iceman; and he's on a mission to help Harry's regulars wise up and let go of their pipe dreams.

Hickey uses his salesman's pep and charm to convince his old drinking buddies to pick up the burdens they set down in favor of gin-induced oblivion.  The toughest nut for Hickey to crack is Larry, a former labor radical who claims to be sick of life and through with caring about other people.  Larry has his own distraction.  Don, the son of Larry's old girlfriend, has shown up bearing a load of guilt he wants Larry to help him carry.  Larry's mask of indifference keeps slipping, and he keeps trying to push it back into place.

Over four mesmerizing acts we see what happens to Harry's little community when they cast off their illusions.  We learn why Hickey's changed, and why it's so important to him that the others wise up, just like he has.

With one glaring exception, the large cast is excellent.  Farrell Pelly as Harry Hope and Myron McCormack as Larry anchor the rolling chaos of the saloon.  Tom Pedi as the bartender Rocky provides a rude energy that keeps things moving.  Jason Robards lit up the theater world when he played Hickey on Broadway.  His is the definitive portrayal, one of the great turns on the American stage.  Hickey's final speech, about how he overcame his own pipe dreams, is worth the price of the DVD by itself.  The glaring exception is Don, played by a very young Robert Redford.  Don is a difficult part, a weak man who's done an unsavory thing, for whom we're supposed to feel pity.  Redford just isn't up to it, which drags down this part of the plot.

O'Neil is showing us the American Century in embryo. Its bottom social layer was awhirl in vague dreams and murderous rages, filled with people fighting a desperate rear guard action against despair.  O'Neil isn't judging here, simply trying to understand.  His language and his compassion for these characters pin the play down in time and space.  His insight that human illusions are both necessary and lethal give the play universal implications.

Iceman has been revived several times since this version aired.  I'm not sure modern American actors can get to the emotional core of this play any more.  For all of its criminality, all the boozing and profanity and violence, there's innocence in these characters, and a sweetness in the way they care for one another that's probably passed out of American life.  Mid-century America still had it to some degree, which is why this is the version of Iceman you want to see.",1138752000,52,3505,4.712171052631579

7934265,5,B000059PEW,"Eugene O'Neil's play The Iceman Cometh is a revelation! I felt as if I had a front row seat watching this play. I was also amazed to find a ton of plays I have wanted to see but never knew were available online.  Amazon has a fantastic selection of films and now I find they also have a fantastic assortment of truly wonderful plays to watch as well.  The Iceman Cometh was O'Neil's last play and what a play it is.  If your wanting to sit down and relax and have a big belly laugh...Do NOT rent this play.  If you know O'Neil's work it goes without saying.  If you love quality acting and a cast of actors that will blow you away then this is for you.  It hit me especially hard and I could relate to the story in so many ways.  Jason Robards was one of our greatest actors and even as young as he was in this play he was just so natural.  If there was a weak link anywhere it would be the VERY young Robert Redford.  He was so young and I'm guessing a little out of his league with all the other older and more experienced actors on stage with him.  It was interesting to see his beginnings and what a fine actor he did turn out to be.  Sidney Lumet directed this play and is one of my favorite directors so I guess for me, I couldn't go wrong.  Films, music, the arts are hard to review.  They are such personal things in our lives. Obviously not everyone will like this.  It is raw, heart wrenching and above all honest. Lumet always is. This is a play you will think about long after it is over.  That is always a sign you have chosen correctly and have learned something in the time you spent watching. For me that is what real entertainment is all about.  If I was not moved to feel something, think, laugh or cry, then most likely I'm not going to like it.  I loved The Iceman Cometh.",1426204800,,1792,4.088825214899713
7934266,5,B000059PEW,"In the 1961 ""Iceman Cometh,"" made for TV, a somewhat histrionic minister-of-salvation speechifying was represented In Robard's performance of Hickey. His transformation from healer to sadist was masterful.  I prefered his manic energy over the slick, snake-oil salesman pitch of Lee Marvin's portrayal in the later film of ""Iceman"" by John Frankenheimer (1973).  Both filmed presentations of the play are interesting for the overall performance, stage choreography, and strength of delivery.  Comparison between Redford (1961) and Bridges (1973) in the lesser role of Parrit makes both versions of ""Iceman"" attractive for viewers today.
  O'Neill's ""Iceman"" should make a lot of people squirm in these days of our illusions of exceptionalism and denial of the times the world and society are living through.  It would be good if the greedy one-per-centers, fearful of showing themselves outside their mansions and Park Avenue penthouses, had the guts to watch it.  The problem is, as O'Neill shows, the greedy are unable to change from wanting more. Larry was Robert Ryan's last film role (1973), a wonderful performance of the deluded realist; his lines and emotional motivations are what particular impressed me.  Both films are worth the four-hour viewing. -- David Gilmour",1425945600,,1276,5.441624365482234

7934268,3,B000059PEW,"Like most of O'Neill's longer tragedies, this play is better read than watched, and while Mr. Lumet's production is very close to the text, with bull's-eye performances by Myron McCormick and Tom Pedi, Robards, as the doomed seer Hickey--while initially electrifying--serves ultimately to sabotage the play with his histrionics and overheated monologues.  This is a bit of a catch-22 with some of O'Neill's work--transmuting prolixity and bathos to the stage.  Perhaps it is/was suitable to the era, but TIC wilts or simply burns out (at 3.5 hours) when juxtaposed with Lumet's subsequent O'Neill production, the towering ""Long Days Journey Into Night"", which features Robards in a more suitably sardonic role.
For O'Neill purists primarily, I give 3.5 stars based on Lumet's faithful rendering and the aforementioned exceptional performances.",1424390400,,843,5.578125
7934269,5,B000059PEW,Really amazing performance by Jason Robards.  Also interesting to see such an early Robert Redford.  Realize that this is a TV movie that filmed a stage performance in 1960.  Watch it for the performances and the well-written story.,1415836800,,232,5.052631578947368
