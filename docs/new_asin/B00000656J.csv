The email I got said 4-21 business days shipping?! What are you shipping it via camel?  Ridiculous!  Still haven't gotten the d*** thing.  Never buy from 'Got Books Inc'.  Really lousy.  I can't even track my shipments.  THIS REVIEW DOES NOT MEAN THE PRODUCT IS BAD, ONLY THE SHIPPING WAS A NIGHTMARE!  Sorry to lower the rating on this product people, but if this is what I have to go through to get the thing then I can't help myself.

By the way, this was supposed to be a Valentines Day present for my Girlfriend.  I didn't need it on Valentines Day, so I wasn't to concerned when it hadn't showed up for our celebration, but now its almost March, and I still haven't gotten it.  I've ordered things from CHINA that have gotten here quicker.  CHINA!!!  Ok I'm done.",1204243200,,946,4.38728323699422
1192737,5,B00000656J,"What an amazing animated feature film. I am 18 years old and having not long ago finished performing in 'The Wizard of Oz' Stage Play, and Reading & Watching the latest Broadway Musical WICKED (The ""Prequel"" and Untold Story of the Witches of Oz), I suddenly thought of looking for this video. My Sister and I used to watch this video OVER and OVER when we were both younger, but somewhere along the line this video was lost. I found it on Amazon.com out of pure chance! When it arrived a couple of days later I was so EXCITED. I put it straight in and remained glued for the entire duration. I was amazed at how much of the Story, The Sound Effects, Action and Music I could remember! Nearly all of it. What a brilliant film. I am also reading the Original Book by Baum at the moment and this feature remains more close to the Original Story than the 1939 Judy Garland Version.

This is a must for all youngsters, a great way to be introduced to the Wonderful Land of Oz. And for all you Adults, get a copy of this and then have a Google for WICKED The Musical - you'll never look at the Wizard of Oz the same again A TRULY AMAZING MUSICAL!",1128902400,,1141,4.210045662100456
1192738,4,B00000656J,"Not to be confused with the 1939 classic with Judy Garland, this Anime adaptation of L. Frank Baum's masterpiece, THE WIZARD OF OZ was made in 1982 by Toho and directed by Fumihiko Takayama.  Interesting fact:  in Japan, it runs at 60 minutes, while in the U.S. it clocks in around 79!  It also follows the first book more closely than the 1939 classic did; e.g. when the Wizard appears before the individual companions, he's in a different form (a disembodied head, an angelic woman, a rhino/triceratops creature, and a blazing inferno) and the Witch sends her wolves and crows BEFORE her flying monkeys capture Dorothy and her comrades, etc.

I videotaped this off the Disney Channel several years ago, but have since obtained an official video copy (thanks to winning another EBAY auction).  Of course, it's dub only, so I am unable to compare it to the subtitles (a petty price to pay, because I think it already scores in the accuracy department in being faithful to the original story, linewise and characterwise).

That said, for an early 80's dub, THE WIZARD OF OZ features some surprisingly good voice acting.  The best voice in the dub belongs to Aileen Quinn (best known as the title character from ANNIE); her Dorothy is convincing, full of energy, and endearing.  She also has a great singing voice (even if the adapted lyrics on the three songs are occasionally choppy).  It's a shame she's not doing anymore films, much less dubs; Quinn showcases amazing talent for such a young age.  The late Billy Van plays the Scarecrow, and while he doesn't replace Ray Bolger's legendary take on the supposedly brainless straw man (then again neither does the rest of the cast to their characters, but I'm not going to compare this dub unfavorably to the masterpiece we know and love) he manages to hit the right spot.

Those of you who may have watched most of Nelvana's TV shows, such as THE CARE BEARS and BABAR may recognize two of the voice actors from these two shows. John Stocker, the voice of the Tin Man (who, by the way, is quite good), is best known as Mr. Beastly from THE CARE BEARS as well as Zephir the Monkey from the theatrical release of BABAR.  Elizabeth Hanna is best known, likewise, as the old lady from BABAR, and it is refreshing to hear her play a villain (or in this case, the Wicked Witch of the West); her cackling is dead-on and although she has a small part (unlike the 1939 version) Hanna makes the most of it.  (She's also the voice of the Good Witch of the North and Auntie Em.)

There are only two actors who don't quite fare so well.  First is the Cowardly Lion, played by Thick Wilson.  Wilson has an appropriately gravel voice, and his acting isn't too bad, but he doesn't come off as much of a scaredy-cat (scaredy-lion?) as Bert Lahr did.  Lorne Greene as the Wizard is the weakest of the cast; his performance is more detached and not as well done as the others.

Aside from that (and the rough lyrics from the songs), the only problems I noticed with this dub is the dialogue and lip synchronization.  The script features some occasionally awkward-sounding lines, mostly due to lipflap purposes.  The synchronization is not as bad as HI-TOPS' SWAN LAKE dub, but there are moments when the dialogue seems unmeshed with the mouth. However, given that this was a product of the early 1980's, this is best to be expected.

Even with its flaws, this dub of a classic story Anime-style isn't a horrible listen at all, as it's nowhere nearly as bad as the only real stinker I've heard from the 1980's, Streamline's distributed AKIRA.

The movie was released on video by Paramount several years ago, but is badly out of print. You can best find it on EBAY.

Speaking of the movie's artistic and aural merits, the animation is occasionally stiff, but the colors are pretty and the characters well drawn.  One thing that needs mentioning is the music score by Joe Hisaishi (of Miyazaki fame) and Yuichiro Oda.  It's an interesting mixture of light jazz and contemporary music; it fits well with the story (even if Harold Arlen's Oscar-winning score remains unmatched).

All in all, this now obscure Japanese animated adaptation of THE WIZARD OF OZ, although inferior to the 1939 classic, manages to be enjoyable on its own turf, despite its age.",1091145600,9,4281,4.66711051930759
1192739,5,B00000656J,"I haven't seen this movie for a long time since I got it from the Wherehouse. My little brother and I have watched it and we both loved it. The songs are really great. You'll have them repeating over and over in your head. My favorite one is It's the Wizard of a Day. Also, I liked the messages that each of the forms of the Wizard gave to Dorothy's friends. They're really true.",1060300800,,379,4.135135135135135

I have wonderful memories, from this japanese anime cartoon, but only have small glimpes of the film in my mind...
Overall the cartoon was gorgeous. I haven't seen it anywhere...",1015804800,4,303,4.846153846153846
1192741,5,B00000656J,"When I was young I'd always rent his movie at Blockbuster. I'm suprised they didn't just give the movie to me because I rented it every Friday, and never got tired of it. The songs were stuck in my head 24/7 and I'd pretend that I was TOTO!For a few years they must have put it in the back room because I didn't see it on the shelf for atleast 3 years! My dad told me somebody probably never turned it in, or they put it on the bairgain table and sold it. But yesterday when I went in to rent ""Cinderella 2"" I saw they had the ""For Sale"" table up! I looked all over the table, and under ""Zenon, Girl Of The 21st Century"" was this edition of ""The Wizard Of Oz""!!! I forgot all about ""Cinderella 2"" and went to the checkout line. I was soooo happy. The clerks thought I was ba~zookas, and one old lady asked if I felt OK!! It was like 8.99 so I paid joyfully. When I got home I ran upstairs (forgetting to shut the door) and watched! I remembered all the songs, and sound effects. This is probably more suitable for little kids than the Judy Garland version. The songs are wonderful! And what's more is Aileen Quinn (Annie!!) stars as Dorothy!! I totaly reccomend buing this, whether used or WHAT, you'll ABSOLUTLY love it!!",1015113600,4,1222,4.2042553191489365
1192742,5,B00000656J,This 1982 version of The Wizard of oz is very good. The story line is mostley based on the book. I found this movie at a grage sale and bought it for 50 cents. It was well worth it. Me and my brother watched it once and loved it. I think it is one of the greatest Oz cartoons ever made.,1009584000,3,286,3.7049180327868854

It's hard to find VHS copies of this awesome movie anymore, and sadly it hasn't been re-issued to DVD or Blu-ray. It makes a great anime movie classic. I am proud I finally got to buy one of those VHS cassettes. ^.^",1392336000,,300,4.280701754385965
7904016,4,B00000656J,"I can't remember exactly how old I was or where my parents bought it when I saw this movie for the first time, but I do remember liking it almost as much as a similar Oz anime that came along 4 years after it. This film, like the one that followed, sticks closely to the book. The only thing it shares in common with the MGM classic is that ruby slippers are used, but they're styled after the pointy-toed silver shoes from the book and that Glinda appears to Dorothy just after she loses hope of returning home. Oh, and the Witches of the East and West are sisters (as well as Glinda and the Good Witch of the North). While the Kalidahs face-off is shown, only one appears instead of two.

What separates the '82 and '86 adaptations is that the former has a few musical numbers. Three, to be exact, all ably carried by then child star Aileen Quinn of Annie fame. The inspirational main theme It's Strictly Up To You encourages dreaming big and making them come true while the wistful I Dream of Home is set to a dream sequence in which Dorothy reminisces about Aunt Em and Uncle Henry. The joyous A Wizard of a Day celebrates the defeat of the Wicked Witch and the freeing of the Winkies.

As far as the acting, everyone does a fairly good job. Aileen's Dorothy (who strongly resembles Alice from Alice in Wonderland with her blonde hair and blue dress with a white apron) is a likeable, wide-eyed heroine. The Scarecrow is tall and lanky with a personality more contemplative than goofy, the Tin Man is a sturdy looking character with a nose resembling a faucet, and the gravelly voiced Cowardly Lion doesn't try to sound like Bert Lahr's version. The purple skinned, eye patch sporting Wicked Witch of the West is one creepy chick... and not that easy to look at. The land of the Winkie's is much darker than other Oz flicks I've seen and appropriately so.

Is this in the running for one of the best adaptations of Oz? Not quite, but it's worth a rental or a $3.00 charge from a bargain bin that more than a few kids might like. It's also a nice nostalgic stroll down memory lane for all us 80's babies.",1384905600,2,2107,4.383631713554987

7904019,4,B00000656J,"This is really a great cartoon! I remember when I was little, this was one of the cartoon versions that my mother bought for me to add to my growing collection of OZ!
Years later after loosing it in a move, I knew I had to own it again because this is a great adaption of the classic book. There is a little reference to the MGM film. Dorothy has ruby slippers instead of silver, but that doesn't change the glorious storytelling. The art in the film is very Americanized Anime with the voices of ""Annie"" as Dorothy and a few well named stars. The whole scene with Dorothy and the confrontation with the witch is awesome and a little scary-but GREAT! Over-all this is a classic cartoon in my eyes! I very much enjoyed it and everything about it! A great film to show to you're kids! The wizard of Oz is colorful!",1254268800,,812,4.279220779220779
