117887,5,0790757354,"Brooks skewers almost every ethnic, racial and political stereotype in a move even he admits could  not be made today.  It's a sad commentary that while the movie is hilarious, today's tight-assed audiences would be offended by nearly every other word and scene.  SJWs would be perpetually offended by everything and I personally would find that as hilarious as the movie itself.

In fact, when I recently watched the remake of The Magnificent 7, I was reminded of Blazing Saddles and actually thought of 7 as a bloody and ""for real"" version of Blazing Saddles.

So many real comic geniuses in it are dead, to our loss.  Gene Wilder as the Waco Kid; Cleavon Little as Black Bart; Slim Pickens as Mr. Taggart, henchman to Heddy (""that's HEDLEY"") LaMarr. the ueber-villain, and Madeline Kahn as Lilli von Schtupp, a chateuse who falls to Bart's decent manliness.",1518393600,7,860,4.8561643835616435

7791657,1,0790757354,"Watched this 'seismic' movie that apparently started modern comedy and (I enjoy good humor) failed to laugh once. Okay, I get all the risqu elements and sometimes they are played to great effect (re: Hollywood Shuffle), but this was puerile idiocy in the extreme - and I expect better from Mel Brooks. The ONLY clever bit was the 'traditional' western riding off into the sunset where they ride to some extravagant cars to drive them to presumably a five star restaurant.
As for the ""baked-bean scene"" [see puerile idiocy above].

Perhaps the only saving grace - maybe - is the bonus parts. The pilot show is fairly much the same premise albeit in sitcom format. The 'jokes' are signalled by the annoying 'canned-laughter', but it features Barney Millers Steve Landesberg who is giving much more than the insightful wisecracks he gave in the New York police show.

I feel an authentic duty to warn people off this ridiculous catastrophe of a (non)comedy. Search out anything else by Brooks or even Woody Allen. Just avoid this turkey.",1521676800,,1034,4.869318181818182
7791658,3,0790757354,"I hate to disrupt this circle-jerk of 5-star ratings, but let's face it, this is a good, not a great comedy. Parts of it are brilliant. The parts with Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder are gems. Madeline Kahn is wonderful. And Harvey Korman is delicious. But much of the script falls flat with infantile humor. It's sad that Mel Brooks did everything he could to minimize the true hero of the film: Andrew Bergman (note the size of the font used for ""story by"" in the credits). Mel Brooks as an actor ruins every scene he's in. He's simply terrible.

Luckily, Gene Wilder wrote almost all of ""Young Frankenstein"" and kept Brooks' career going. ""The Producers"" was also a great film (although it looks like it was shot by a high school student). ""The Twelve Chairs"" and ""High Anxiety"" were his only other watchable films. You'd be far better off with the original version of ""The In-Laws"" or either of the two excellent Brooks' films.

""Blazing Saddles is a solid comedy, but almost certainly would have been better without Brooks' involvement.",1521676800,,1040,4.740331491712707
