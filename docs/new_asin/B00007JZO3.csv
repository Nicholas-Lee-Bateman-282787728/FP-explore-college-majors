1817547,5,B00007JZO3,"First, I'd like to note that I agree with the reviewer beneath me, Michelle Klein-Hass, 100%. Everything she said, I couldn't have said better myself (except I thought nuku just meant 'warm' so I probably would have given bad information there). But seriously, this is the greatest anime I have ever seen, by any measure, and I'd rate it as the third greatest thing I have ever watched. (i.e. the other 2 aren't anime.... #1 is the movie Remo Williams....)
I have a horrifyingly good movie/toon memory. I can remember almost word-for-word everything I have watched in the last decade, so saying it is the third greatest is quite a claim. Also, strangely enough, even though I have seen it and remember it so well so I know what will happen next, I have watched it several times and enjoyed it every time. Very few things can I even stand to watch a second time, and even after 5 years.
I do NOT agree with the reviewer who thinks it is a little sleazy. Nuku Nuku is drawn to the standard voluptuous female form, but so WHAT? If you were going to make a robotic prosthetic body, wouldn't you make it as attractive as possible? I really couldn't believe it any other way.
Now, Nuku Nuku Dash. THAT is sleazy. THIS is not. THAT is as if it were some unworthy fanfiction that somehow, by some miracle, managed to get itself produced. But I deny its existence. They screwed EVERYTHING up as well. I would suggest anyone reading this avoid it. It is a sorrowful disappointment; perhaps an offensive insult to this series itself.
I suppose it derserves a mention that Nuku Nuku is also the most endearing character of any work of fiction I can think of. Perhaps the most interesting character. (And I mean endearing in non-sexual terms. For example, Vash the Stampede from Trigun is what I would call endearing, although not as much as Nuku Nuku... and I'm not a gay dude.) She's very sweet, and yet not a simple, flat character, the way most super-nice characters generally turn out. Watch this and you will just fall in love with this nutty and eccentric, lovable cat person, and NOT just for her looks (for crying out loud, they could at least have drawn her with more than one tooth more than 10% of the time). It staggers the mind to imagine that so many other characters in the series could be so evil as to wish her harm/death. How could anyone want anything less than what's best for this sweetie?
This also satisfies the constraints I would apply to good science fiction, and not just into the anime genre. Nuku Nuku is the only one who demonstrates superhuman strength or speed, save another android, and they DO have respect for the laws of physics of our world, for the most part. Well, some times they draw things a little strangely to emphasize this or that.... for instance, a big machine changing color and shooting off steam to emphasize its human driver inside is ticked. You may notice that none of the characters have blue or green or other ridiculous hair colors... it's only Nuku Nuku with reddish magenta hair, but that's ok since she's an android after all. Basically, it does not adhere to ALL the norms of stereotypical Japanese animations (though again, they should have done a better job drawing teeth in wide-open mouths).",1079740800,4,3244,4.604490500863558
1817548,5,B00007JZO3,"Gotta love Nuku Nuku-chan. This is by far the best of the three animated series featuring the perky, genki andro-robot grrl with a kitty brain and the strength of The Terminator. You meet her creator, Natsume Kyusaku, and his son Natsume Ryunosuke, as they are fleeing from his ex-wife Mishima Akiko's Office Lady hit squad. Nuku Nuku is created out of the consequences of the chase.
During the rest of this six-episode Original Animation Video series, you watch Nuku Nuku deal with the weirdnesses of being a human being. You also see Kyusaku and Akiko alternately fighting each other and trying to put their relationship back together. And you see the strong bond that develops between little but wise beyond his years Ryunosuke and his cybernetic big sister Nuku Nuku.
The DVD version doesn't have much in the way of extras, but remember that this was created in 1992, long before the era of producing extras for future video releases. It does have an amusing Macintosh-like interface that will put a smile on the Mac fans among us.
The dub isn't too bad, although giving Kyusaku a Texas drawl is as weird as Billy Bob Thornton doing the voice of the itinerant Shinto priest in ""Princess Mononoke."" However, you must watch it at least once subtitled, because the vocal performances of the Japanese Seiyuu are amazing, especially Hayashibara Megumi in the title role. Hayashibara-san is the Mel Blanc of Japan...she's the most ubiquitous vocal actor in Anime's golden age, and she gives a great performance here. A lesser voice actress would have just played Nuku Nuku as a bubbly, genki little flibbertygibbet. Hayashibara-san's performance gives the character depth and subtlety. The other performers rise to her example.
The video transfer is a bit messy, but it's understandable considering they probably were working from analog sources rather than digital sources.
Get this before ADV Films decides to consign this to remainder hell. This is not the most well-known series but it's damn good. And look out for Cat Girl Nuku Nuku TV, the first DVD of which will be released the beginning of March 2004. Nuku Nuku DASH!, the second NN OAV, is available now, but it pales in comparison to this, the original. Curl up, get cozy (which is what Nuku Nuku actually means in Japanese) and bask in the warm glow of this must-see DVD. Purrrrrr...=^_^=",1076630400,7,2349,4.919395465994962
1817549,3,B00007JZO3,This is ok. I got it and i thought this was kinda of boring but its good sometimes. Im probley not going to get all the nuku nuku dvds. I think this series as a slow story line.,1076198400,,177,3.6842105263157894
1817550,5,B00007JZO3,"All Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku Dash is COMPLETLY different plot line than the original OAV, good news is there are ALOT of references to the OAV.
 For starters Akiko and Kyusaku are happily married and living together with their 14 year-old son Ryunosuke.  Nuku appears as a green haired, orange eyed 19 year old girl who has no memory about her life and only goes into combat whenever life is in need of protection. Also no high-school uniforms for Nuku anymore... but her ""Power Ranger"" costume makes up for it!  The whole cast of characters are ignorant to the fact that Nuku and the ""power ranger"" are one and the same, and poor Ryu has a huge crush on BOTH. To make matters more interesting Akiko is a simple underling in Mishima Industry who is given the task to find the runaway MIFX-N2-009 Android (Unknown to her this is Nuku).
This DVD has four episodes that show Mishima and Akiko's attempts to finding Nuku and Ryu's growing crush on Nuku.  I will just give some basic plot points, will try not to spoil anything.
Episode 1: Introduction of Characters and basic set-up.  Good thing they used the voice actors from the OAV that is a Nice touch.  Basically Nuku destroys Akiko's helicopter in a hero-like costume with ONE punch. Most notable moment: Kyusaku tries to hack into Nuku in his lab and fails... seems he knows more about her than he is letting on.
Episode 2: Introduction of the next door neighbors.  Nuku and Ryu are left home alone as the folks go to a hot-spring for three days... oh what is RYU to do.  The neighbors are a woman and her daughter. The woman is a little easy to embarrass while the daughter is two-faced and seems very mature for a Kindergartener.  Nuku faces off with... another Nuku! Most memorable moment.. Ryu accidentally falls into Nuku's chest... and Nuku is different than her assassin...
Episode 3: Ooizumi (a mad scientist in Priest clothes...Yes that is the English voice actor for Lord Illpillatzo from Excel Saga) creates a flower girl robot to capture Nuku.  Nuku and Ryu go one their FIRST Date?!  Lots of cat references here.  Most memorable moment: Ooizumi reading the Bible to awaken his ""Daughter""... (I was almost expecting him to say ""This world is corrupt"" the whole time.) Akiko is promoted to chief of Capturing Android MIFK-N2-009.
Episode 4: The pair returns! Akiko's assistants Arisa and Kyoko (from the OAV) are back and they are just the same as ever.  They blow up a jet and are forced to work under Akiko for THREE years WITHOUT PAY!  They go after Nuku and in the process ruin Akiko's perfect breakfast TWICE... not a good way to get in good with the boss...  Notable scene Akiko cuts her hand as she punches a vase in anger and Nuku LICKS it like a cat!
The DVD features a reversible cover and shows all new previews plus the other standard extra's you expect from ADV.  Not to mention the book explains all the main characters in the DVD.
Would highly recommend it to those who liked the OAV also for 15 years old and up as mentioned on the DVD case... violence and SOME brief nudity. Nothing major, just some things you might see in a PG-13 boarder-line R movie. They do a good job keeping the ""vitals"" covered.
Plot 5 stars
Animation 5 stars
Extras: 5 stars
As mentioned NICE Touch using the voice actors from the OAV. Plus the reversable cover is good to.",1069372800,,3341,4.561872909698996
1817551,4,B00007JZO3,"The inventor, Kyusaku Natsume, is escaping from his wife, the ruthless Lady Akiko Mishima, with both their son and the NK-1124 android.  During their escape, while they are being chased by the Lady's elite team of Office Ladies, armed with the best from the military products division of her company, a cat is killed.
Next thing you know, Kyusaku and son and new DAUGHTER (the android with the cat's brain inside) are living together, trying to have a normal life.  That is, until Lady Akiko Mishima and her female warriors find them again!
While funny, sometimes down right silly, there are sometimes very mature, even beautiful, moments between the members of this wacko family.  The relationships between father and son, father and wife, and even the relationship between the family and Nuku-Nuku become part of the story, sometimes in the background and sometimes in the foreground.
The six episodes, with the very modern looking menus and the extras, make it worth buying IF you can get it for a low-low price (as in used).",1051315200,3,1028,4.896551724137931
1817552,4,B00007JZO3,"One Day, Ryunosuke is out with his father when he finds a cat and asks his father if he can keep it.  Kyusaku (dad) can hardly say no before they are attacked by a hi tech helicopter.  They take off, and the chase is on.  By the time the chase is over and their car is wrecked,  Ryunosuke and Kyusaku are okay, but the cat.....is dead.  It then cuts into the main story.  Kyusaku is a genius scientist, by the way.  He ends up putting the cat's brain into a female android body!  Oh and the antics that ensue.  The story is centered around Ryunosuke, his father, Nuku Nuku (the cat girl), Akiko (their rival, and Kyusaku's WIFE), and Akiko's gun crazy employees.  Nuku Nuku is so loveable, but for some reason, everyone wants to kill her!  This six episode DVD encompasses the entire story.  It is action packed and hilarious, but still touching in many moments.  My only complaint is that I wish there was more.  There are pretty good extras like an image gallery and trailers.  The picture is pretty good ( as good as it can be for a slightly older animation), with good sound.  I recommend this to anime fans in general, unless you are very stuck in your particular genre.",1046563200,,1175,4.395348837209302
1817553,5,B00007JZO3,"...if you're an anime fan who likes shows that are light and funny, that is. Well, what eles can I say about this one that hasn't been said before? If you've read the other reviews already, you know the basic story by now. Well, let me just say that, if you want to see this series in English, you have to get the DVD, since even though this series has been available in the U.S. since 1996, it hasn't been until earlier in '03 that A.D.V. went back and dubbed it in English, and the dubbed version is only available on bilingual DVD. That having been said, I might add that if you like your anime in English and you've been watching A.D.V. licenced shows for some time now, you might hear a few familar voices-Allison Keith (BLUE SEED and Misato from NEON GENESIS EVANGELION) is Nuku Nuku, Kelly Manison (THOSE WHO HUNT ELVES and Naga from THE SLAYERS) is the mother, Tiffany Grant (BLUE SEED, Chi from DEVIL HUNTER YOKO, Maki from BURN-UP & BURN-UP W, Becky from GUNSMITH CATS,) is Kyouko, one of the office lady warriors, and Cynthia Martinez (Yuna from GALAXY FRAULIEN YUNA and Lina Inverse from SLAYERS THE MOVIE & SLAYERS OAVs) is Emi (pronounced ""Amy""), the rival android who shows up in episode 4. If you're not one of those people bitterly opposed to watching dubbed anime, you'll enjoy it. If you don't like dubs, you can always watch the origonal Japanese version, also on the DVD.",1045440000,,1392,4.5059288537549405
1817564,4,B00007JZO3,"The APCCGNN series has both a TV and OVA version, as well as a one or two episode OVA. All of them are different. When I first ordered this title, I mistakenly ordered the TV series. It was decent, but had a different set up. This OVA has a much shorter number of episodes, and is much more funny - and fun.

I would recommend you get this one first. If you want more NUKU NUKU in your diet, you should then move on to  the TV series.",1343779200,,434,3.9204545454545454
1817565,5,B00007JZO3,"I'm a HUGE Blue Seed fan, and watching that show for the first time in Japanese made me fall in love with lead voice actress Megumi Hayashibara.  I got this show based on reviews read, her part in it, and that it was from the creator of Blue Seed.

One of the best blind purchases I've ever made.  Absolutely hilarious, and Megumi-chan is priceless as Nuku Nuku.  The one flaw of this show is that 6 episodes weren't enough.  I really wanted it to go on longer.

If you are a fan of hilarious anime with scenes that make you want to hit the rewind button again and again, this is the show for you.",1300060800,,597,4.147826086956521

Of course, guys out there would most likely be happy to have a beautiful girl like Nuku Nuku in his home, but she is also the savior of the town! With four awesome epidoses, clean opening and closing animation, and six anime previews from ADV films, Nuku Nuku packs a punch!",1134691200,,515,4.431578947368421
1817569,3,B00007JZO3,"The last volume of Nuku Nuku ends on a positive note, in opposition to a lot of comedy anime that tries to instill some drama into the last episodes of a series. Nuku Nuku's zaniness and good clean fun continues until the end of the dvd.

First up is a Valentine's Day episode in which the rest of the cast is trying to figure out what boy has captured Nuku Nuku's heart. Spoiled rich girl Chieko, jealous of the attention, buys up all of the chocolate in the city to keep Nuku Nuku from declaring her love. Then it's on to a semi-musical episode as the class of Maneki High School film an amateur sci-fi movie to celebrate the end of school. The last episode concerns a giant cat faced shaped asteroid heading for Earth. Mishima Industries sends a cluster of nuclear missles to destroy it but as they hit the asteroid, their resident evil scientist realizes that he forgot to turn off the safety mechanisms. It's up to Nuku Nuku to pilot the last missle or the Earth will die! It's not as dramatic as all that.

This series was hilarious. And it did comedy the old fashioned way. With wit and intelligent writing, not fan service and harem comedy. It was very refreshing because it was so good-natured. Nuku Nuku is like a Jerry Lewis character, bumbling and idiotic but well-meaning. You really come to care for the dilemma that she faces in becoming more human but at the same time having to save the city and her friends from the terribly inept Mishima Industries. Even though a lot of the jokes play over and over again, it does not decrease the pleasure of viewing this series. Highly recommended.

I would also recommend the first one volume series Nuku Nuku Collection which features Nuku Nuku's origin and an alternate telling of her adventures.",1117584000,3,1754,4.561904761904762
1817570,4,B00007JZO3,"Yes, I said a-MEOW-zing.  Please forgive me for that, but at least I'm not saying purr-fect, right?  Actually, the only reason I didn't say that is because there's no such thing as perfect.  Ah, but I ramble!  Let's get crackin' on that review, shall we?

Art style: B+.  Although this was what grabbed my attention at first, I'm really not terribly fond of the 'Anime retro-esque' style. I guess I've just gotten too used to newer artstyles. I find nothing wrong with the art; it's all a matter of taste, I guess.

Originality: A.  I'm sort of lumping the OVA and the TV series together on this one.  Have you ever seen anything remotely similar to the idea of a stray cat given a second chance at life as a human androbot, in exchange for saving the world from Mishima Industries while trying to act human?  I think not. Although it contains mecha, an overly defined line between good and evil, and cliched characters, it's all for the sake of parodizing.

Voice Acting: A.  Rarely do I ever see an anime where I like the voice acting equally in both English and Japanese.  Now there are a few exceptions:  I like Rie, Ryunosuke, and Futaba's voices better in Japanese, whereas I like Akiko's, Mr. Yamagata's, and Kyusaku's voices better in English.  So, I'll watch it subbed or dubbed, no problem.

Music: B.  It's not outstanding, though rather easy on the ears.  The theme songs are a bit catchy, though, I'll admit.

Number of episodes: B.  I had become so used to buying dvds with three episodes, I was pretty much ecstatic when I found that there were four on here. Thanks, ADV Films. You make VIZ look stupid. =D

Overall: A.  An innocent, cute series that (almost) anyone can enjoy.  Warning: May have you curling your fingers into a fist and rubbing your face with the back of your hand while purring.  I know from experience. ^^;",1115164800,3,1841,4.559633027522936
1817571,4,B00007JZO3,"By now any serious anime fan should be familiar with the Japanese cat-girl stereotype. A hyper-active, supercute, super-girl. I'm not sure where this idea started, but I can tell you one thing. One of the best examples of the genre I have ever seen is this OVA. What makes it a classic? Is it the perfectly insane (perfectly hilarious?) mad-scientist father? The crazed mother who is alternately a business woman fanatic that would remind you a military commander (with a hilarious over-the-top personality) and (can you believe it?) a super-sweet, delicate as lace angel obsessed with her son's welfare? Or perhaps it's the ridiculous fights and explosions through the series which never result in anyone getting killed (or even seriously injured) despite what looks like hundreds of millions of dollars of property destruction? Or could it be the heavy-artilary carrying duo henchwomen or the super-aggressive (pint-sized) android, all of whom are all obsessed with destroying the main character in some wild scheme? Na.

What really makes this series is the main character. Nuku Nuku is undoubtedly one of the greatest characters in the whole history of anime. She's a super-powered android in the shape of a beautiful teen-ager with the brain of a cat. All things considered, she's almost impossible not to love. Her look is very attractive, yet very sincere. She's cute and extroverted and silly, yet fiercely loyal and self-sacrificing. She only wants to use her super-powers for good (not to show off), and yet finds herself unwittingly part of battles of mass destruction. She considers her creator and his son to be her family, and loves them dearly. Ultimately it's the pure heart of her character that makes her so compelling, and the reason why everyone loves her.

You could watch this dvd in English, but that would be a crime. The Japanese language track features some of the finest voice-acting you will ever find. Everyone does a great job, but the voice actress who plays Nuku Nuku is PERFECT. In fact I'd go so far as to say that this series would be greatly diminished without her voice acting, as it truly is spectacular.

I should also mention that this series has great artwork (especially considering when it was made), and a great soundtrack as well (I never get tired of the first opening theme).

This is not only one of the best OVAs ever, it's also an anime classic. If wacky Japanese comedies aren't normally your style you may want to just rent this one. If on the other hand, you've been searching far and wide for a anime comedy featuring a super-powered, super-likable cat girl with a heart of gold, you've hit the jackpot.",1096243200,13,2657,4.897777777777778
1817572,2,B00007JZO3,"First things first, this series is not exactly a ""Bad"" anime series, if you go into it with an open mind and not basing the content of this series off of the original that probably inspired you to buy it in the first place it can potentially be an enjoyable anime experience.  Its just that basically all of the humorous slap stick fun that made up the original APCCGNN has been replaced by a quite serious tone that makes it seem liked a messed up anime terminator love story.

I was quite sad to find out that the producers had lyposuctioned all of the humor out of the original series during the production of this one because to me that was the original entrigue.  All in all i was quite dissapointed and only gave it a 2 because it shares a common title with the origianl.

I have recently ordered the APCCGNN TV! series which seems to have brought back the original hilarious Nuku Nuku and i am anticipating it greatly . . . in my professional opinion buy the TV series and not this spin off.",1095552000,3,998,4.320855614973262
1817573,5,B00007JZO3,"Before there was FLCL, before there was Excel Saga, the undisputed champion for out of control funny anime was All Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku. Although ""Nuku Nuku DASH!"" is a strangely serious take on the story, with some weird changes to continuity, Nuku Nuku TV carries on the tradition of belly laughs started by the original 1992 OAV series.
This is anime as if it was done by Mel Brooks and/or Zucker Abrams and Zucker. You have an andro-robot with the brain of a cat who is trying desperately to act human. You have a mad scientist and his super-smart, sarcastic son. You have a corporate president who has watched too much Anime and Sci-Fi movies and now fancies himself an Evil Genius. And you have a high-school class filled with the oddest group of misfits you're likely to see this side of ""Square Pegs.""
Anime cliches get absolutely no mercy here, nor do quirks of Japanese Pop Culture. Transforming robots, fighting Mechas, earnest psychic girls, mad scientists, scheming villains, heroes who fight for love and justice and say the most bizarre things while doing so...they all get savaged here. Add to this a little girl with the weirdest pets, and the weirdest karaoke contest ever, and you have an anime that's a must-get.
This is even a title you can share with the whole family. Nothing the least bit suggestive here, perhaps a mild bit of cussing in the subtitles but nothing that wouldn't get a PG or PG-13. Any kid who can read well enough to read the subtitles should have fun with this. I didn't watch the dub all the way through because I really don't like it, but the subbed version is lots of fun.",1081555200,2,1632,4.6116838487972505
1817574,3,B00007JZO3,"OK, so this is not as good as the first four episodes. However, there are some really nice bits in here, and anyone who wants to collect the series needs this volume for completeness' sake.
The best of the four episodes in this batch is Episode 7, where Nuku Nuku pedals so fast on the way to school she goes back in time to see the rivalry between Natsume Kyusaku and Mishima Juzo (aka ""Hell"" Mishima, aka ""The Young President"") for Akiko's affections. Anyone who remembers ""Giant Robot"" and ""Getter Robo"" will get major laughs over this one. Worth the price of admission.
Everything else is sort of meh. You meet Japan's worst Idoru-star singing group, ""Speedy,"" who are also Japan's worst ""ESPers"" or psychics. You see the tightly-wrapped Futaba-chan loosen up a little with a case of puppy love. And you experience close encounters of the Mouse-girl (yes, Mouse-girl!) kind with a rodent from Outer Space.
In any event, this is worth getting for three reasons:
1.) To get a complete set of NNTV episodes;
2.) Because episode 7 is pretty darn cool;
and 3.) Because this is still a funny, funny series that you can actually share with the entire family. You can't say that for wilder funny anime series like FLCL and Excel Saga, which are kind of ecchi around the edges. (Don't even ASK about Puni Puni Poemi...)",1081555200,,1314,4.668103448275862

If you have the original this has a Tenchi in Tokyo feel to it, you know all the players but every thing else is different. The dash story line is longer and gives time for a few, ever so popular, plot twists that keep the story interesting. There were two things that were a little on the irritating side, Nuku Nuku's statement of purpose (once was OK but it gets old after the second episode) and the English dub has to be the worst I've ever herd (I switched to Japanese W/ subtitles half way through the first episode). All in all I liked the new story line and recommend all three DVD's.",1080864000,2,665,4.244094488188976
1817576,4,B00007JZO3,"All Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku (I'll use the short title from now one - I promise) started out in life as a manga by Yuzo Takada and a very popular OVA series, followed by this TV series and a second OVA set.  It is the tongue in check story of androbot Atsuko Nakume who was created by scientist Kyusaku Natsume out of, among other things, the brain of a cat.  Intended to help fight the plans of Mishima Industry to take over the world via appliances (go figure!), Nuku Nuku appears completely human until she grooms herself, chows down on cat food, or throws a rampaging washing machine into orbit.
Mishima is headed by an evil president (Hell Mishima), who is laboring under the delusion that he is in command of a group of underground super-nasties who are really company employees in disguise.  If that seems a little peculiar, consider Nuku Nuku's first day in school when we are introduces to a class composed of a compulsive rock singer, a Cordelia clone complete with groupies, a mystical space cadet, a control freak, and a mad scientist - among others.  Matters are complicated by the romantic misadventures of Nuku Nuku's 'brother' Ryunosuke Natsume.  And Mishima, his mother is really Mishima's evil lieutenant, Bloody Akiko.
Obviously, these tails (oops!) of the All Purpose Cultural... refuse to take themselves seriously.  One can only say that the TV series is really a satire of the entire genre of
Super powered schoolgirl anime.  You can't help but like it though.  Nuku Nuku's exuberant, klutzy cuteness is just what the doctor ordered after an overdose of Steel Angel Kurumi.  Acting is actually perfectly in character (even the dubbing has its moments) and the art, which is very deliberately 80's retro, is ideal.  If you like light slapstick, cuteness, and a dollop of sarcasm check this series out.",1080172800,9,1834,4.830670926517572
1817577,2,B00007JZO3,"I watched the OAV series 1 (NOT this one mind you) for All Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku and was greatly impressed. I would rate it as the best anime I have EVER seen, and the third greatest thing I have EVER seen. I then proceeded to shell out big bucks to buy the complete Nuku Nuku Dash DVD set, and what did I find? They RUINED EVERYTHING! Surely not written by the same people. That is the best explanation I can come up with; I only hope it's true. I don't know for sure, so I may be wrong, but it is hard to imagine. Here is PART of the contents of an e-mail telling the man who sold it to me of my disappointment:

Speaking of Tenchi, Nuku Nuku Dash reminds me of the frustration I felt when I started watching Tenchi Universe after watching Tenchi Muyo, naively expecting it to CONTINUE instead of reinvent the characters and have them all meet each other with different histories and as if they had never met before.
Only this is worse. To put it mildly, I am disappointed. More precisely, I am dumbfounded. I am horrified... mortified. They took every endearing attribute of the character Nuku Nuku save the voice of Megumi Hayashibara (and in the OAV series 1, she is such an endearing character), every intriguing feature of the other characters as well (Akiko being a psychodic corporate gunslinger, almost literally, as well as a singleminded overprotective mother), every appealing characteristic of the story and every redeeming quality of the original series and manga in general and smashed it all to heck {for fear of Amazon cutting out my words but you know what I said}. Ryunosuke is now adolescent and even though he was the pivotal part in the creation of Nuku Nuku as an android, has never even heard of her before and is now promiscuously interested in her. Nuku Nuku is no longer a quirky lovable cat person but a mindless machine half the time and a mindless person the other half, the series as a whole now focuses greatly around attempting to show sexually arousing cartoon behavior instead of the brilliant humor or story I came to expect, and the fighting itself (not to mention that annoying he-man like thing she says about protecting life every time she transforms - you know, how He-man would always say 'by the power of greyskull, I have the power!') and whatever else is left behind is nothing else but every annoying characteristic of stereotypical anime. To compare Nuku Nuku Dash to the first OAV would be to compare a flashlight to the sun. As far as I'm concerned, the first OAV is the third greatest thing I have ever watched, and this.... this is an offense! It's actually an offensive defilement the original. It's as if I were to make a brown painting entirely out of manure (and some people do consider such things art) and then have the arrogance to name it ""Blue Boy 2"", or to make a crude snowman and call it ""Michaelangelo's David 2"". At least in Tenchi Universe, they were the same characters, although their histories and ways of meeting were changed a bit. This.... this, they flushed some great characters down the toilet. Rather than consider it to be the epitome of sequals to things that are worse than the originals, I henseforth choose to deny the existence of Nuku Nuku Dash. Surely it wasn't created by the same writer. I will look upon it as what it must certainly be.... bad fanfiction that went too far and somehow got itself produced.
I can see why you sold them. I'm afraid I'm going to end up doing the same.

Now, after reading all this, why would I ever rate it at 2 stars? Well, I had only watched the first 5 episodes. I sucked it up and finished it off. There are 12 episodes total (only 4 on the DVD this is posted for, but there is mode 2 and 3 too). I can say that they made a valliant effort to undo the damage they did in the first half, but the hole they dug themselves into was so very deep, the most inspired attempt in history couldn't have saved them. Really, if you are a BIG fan of the original like me, you are probably not the kind of person who will like this. Other than Mortal Kombat Annihilation, never has a sequel to anything ever been so much worse than the original.",1079740800,4,4280,4.588772845953002

7977284,4,B00007JZO3,"One of the first OVAs to be released in the early 90s that made an international impact among soon-to-be converted otaku, Nuku Nuku was an original 6-episode OVA created by 3x3 Eyes writer Yuzo Takada. This later evolved into a manga spinoff, plus a TV remake, and an OVA remake. It might seem like an ecchi comedy, but is actually a grand-scale cybernetic sitcom in the spirit of Project A-ko.

Set in the undetermined future, brilliant scientist Kyusaku makes off with his son Ryunosuke after he learns that his wife Akiko was going to use the android he created to as a weapon for her company, Mishima Heavy Industries. Kyasaku takes the brain of Ryunosuke's nearly deceased cat and transfers it into the android body, which he claims to be his ""daughter"" named Nuku Nuku. This new cat-brained sister of Ryunosuke, as well as his bodyguard from being taken by Akiko's henchgirls, Arisa and Kyouko. Akiko uses numerous attempts to reclaim Ryunosuke, including fighter jets and an octopus mecha, but Nuku Nuku's robotic strength and childlike determination usually prevail, although at causing massive property damage. Ultimately, Kyusaku and Akiko remain separated while Nuku Nuku finds herself getting into more shenanigans, normally caused by screw ups from Akiko's company, like runaway androids and malfunctioning laser satellites.

Nuku Nuku remains one of the more memorable OVAs of its time, and turned a lot of people into being anime fans because of its over the top antics. It's like a cyberpunk action story, but like a primetime family comedy. There is an impressive dub done by ADV Films, but also one originally produced of the first half of the series in Britain, even though there was some material cut from it to seem more like an ""all-ages"" title. The TV remake was done more as a superhero spoof filled with an extra load of cliche characters specifically created to fill out the cast, even though the show only lasted 12 episodes with 2 holiday specials. The other OVA series was titled Nuku Nuku Dash, with an older Ryunosuke trying to court a more serious-minded Nuku Nuku, making it more of a romantic sci-fi comedy. The manga was also released in America acting as a series of tie-in stories to the original OVA. Even though there hasn't been a license rescue of this since before ADV Films changed its company's structure, it's still a great piece of anime nostalgia. The collected DVD has been advertised on places like Netflix as a single movie, but it's not a compilation but still 6 separate episodes.",1465689600,,2532,4.8997668997669

Although the title would only apply to two of the episodes.
The first episode deals with Futaba, who is lovesick for a bookstore clerk.
The next episode (my personal favorite on the disc) features the classroom gang on the beach. It also introduces The Speedy Girls, whom are never able to finish their song, ""Gareki no Shoujo"" (a really catchy song). They become a minor running gag from here on. Next, We find out about the origin of Ryonousuke's father's rivalry with Hell Mishima.
Finally, a humanoid mouse from outer space falls in love with Mr. Yamagata.
Love Attack offers another great batch of episodes from the lesser known and underrated Nuku Nuku TV.

7977290,4,B00007JZO3,"From 1998, Nuku Nuku TV is a comedy version of (or one could say parody of) the Nuku Nuku OVA that was released in 1992. One thing I like about this series is the variety of stock characters that appear. The more interesting ones are Nuku Nuku's classmates. Each episode focuses on at least one or two of them at a time.
My favorite episode on this disc is the last episode where everyone sings at a karaoke contest and each character performs their character song throughout the episode.
Another great thing about this series that I realized later on is that it kind of makes fun of itself, being a spinoff of an earlier anime. The main joke in the series is that the so called heroes and villains take themselves too seriously when in reality there isn't any form of real conflict (and their sidekicks even acknowledge this).
My only regret about this series is that it is too short. Like several anime series this one is only 14 episodes. But there again one can't really expect an anime like this to be much longer.",1376438400,,1019,4.454545454545454

7977292,4,B00007JZO3,"Nuku Nuku used be be a real cat. Now she has an android body and a cat brain. She doesn't look like the typical Cat Girl with kitty ears and a tail. She has robot ears that come out when she is in combat mode. Every now and then her cat brain kicks in and she meows and acts like a kitty. I wouldn't call her much of a cat girl though. Anyway, She was created by the scientist Natsume. She serves as a companion to his young son. Natsume is at war with an evil organization called Mishima, Nuku Nuku's original purpose is to foil their evil schemes. Honestly, a child could probably defeat the brain donors that head up Mishima. Luckily, Nuku Nuku is almost on that level, and she has super powers.

This anime is kind of strange and very silly. It's a lot of fun. If you have seen Excel Saga, you know what to expect. This is pretty much a rated PG cat girl version of that. Nuku Nuku is like a cross between Excel, Lina Inverse, and Yuri from Dirty Pair Flash. She's a lovable character that works her way into the viewers heart. Despite her likability, this anime has a very weak story, average characters, and average animation. Actually, the story is just barely a story at all. Each episode is a different adventure, kinda like Excel Saga. I enjoyed this anime. It's nice to see a show like this one sometimes. It takes your mind off the tedious day to day life of the average American guy. I can see myself coming back to watch this series from time to time, but by no means is this a great show. I do do like that it's just silly and fun, but I definitely wouldn't pay more than 15 bucks for it.",1354752000,,1603,4.1877022653721685
