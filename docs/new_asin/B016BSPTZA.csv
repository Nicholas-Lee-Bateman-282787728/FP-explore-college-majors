7467298,4,B016BSPTZA,"Two amazing actors, great supporting cast, but something is missing. I honestly can't decide if this was poor directing and editing, or if this was a problem with the script, but basically this film tries too hard and delivers too little. That said, even flawed this film was worthy of a viewing, but perhaps not expecting the kind of entertainment that these actors have delivered time and time again.",1453420800,,402,4.840579710144928
7467299,5,B016BSPTZA,A very interesting and entertaining film of the very different lives of two intelligent people and where those lives intersect.,1453334400,2,127,5.4
7467300,5,B016BSPTZA,"Directed by Isabel Coixet (Elegy, The Secret Life of Words) from a screenplay by Sarah Kernochan (What Lies Beneath), Learning To Drive is a quietly engaging film about two unlikely people whose lives intersect in the course of an ordinary experience that ends up changing them both in unexpected ways, with outstanding performances by veteran actors Ben Kingsley and Patricia Clarkson.

Wendy (Patricia Clarkson) is a respected New York City book reviewer. Darwan (Ben Kingsley) is a Sikh from India who came to America many years ago and now teaches driving for a living but also moonlights as a taxi driver. The first meet when Darwan picks up a fare at a restaurant that turns out to be Wendy and her husband Ted (Jake Weber), who has just informed her over dinner that he is leaving her after 21 years of marriage for another woman. We later learn that Wendy has never learned how to drive and her husband was the one who always did the driving. When Darwan comes to her house to return an envelope that she left in his cab, Wendy, upon learning that he's also a driving instructor, impulsively decides to ask Darwan to teach her how to drive. From there on the movie is driven by these two very different characters getting to know each other and by us getting to know them.

Highly, highly recommended for the performances and for the beauty of the story-telling that manages to quietly engage and to avoid stooping to easy or clichd answers to the problems the characters face.",1444435200,126,1485,4.685823754789272

The plot doesn't go anywhere, so you are left with a 'blah' feeling at the end. The people get what they want in a way, but it is anti-climatic. It's almost as if they are settling instead, so it's hard to feel happy for them.",1522195200,,400,3.8902439024390243

7467373,5,B016BSPTZA,"Excellent movie, but the description is wrong.  It's not about overcoming life's obstacles, it's about learning how to breath again after your world is exploded.  There are three people in this movie who have that experience, the woman when her marriage explodes and she has to work through the betrayal of 21 years and the never ending losses, her home, her husband, her trust, her confidence.  She has to leave her world behind and learn some new things.  The Sikh has been there before, the loss of his family, the loss of his country, the loss of his way of life and now he has to embrace some new changes a wife that does not live up to his expectations and he must learn to adapt to her and the changes she brings.  The new wife has landed at the airport in a culture completely different from her own.  She wants to fit in, but she is scared to try, she is scared to admit that she is lacking in some ways.

7467430,5,B016BSPTZA,"Learning How to Drive is a startling, hidden gem of a movie, with glittering performances of love lost by Wendy, portrayed by Patricia Clarkson, with her husband, Jake Weber.

The cab driver, Darwan, portrayed by Ben Kingsley, drives her home after a row with her husband.

A New Yorker, Wendy doesnt know how to drive and says what a lot of city dwellers say.  Why should I drive?  I live in the city and there is transportation to take me wherever I want to go.  With the sudden breakup of her twenty-one year marriage, Wendy is unsure where she wants to go, not to mention to learn how to drive.  Her daughter, Tasha, represented by Grace Gummer suggests she learn how to drive and visit her in Vermont. When Wendy decides to learn, her apt tutor is Darwan, the cab driver.  He is encouraging and precise in her learning the rules of the road.

In the meantime, bachelor, Darwan, a Sikh, marries, Jasleen, an Indian bride, represented by Sarita Choudhury, who is chosen by Darwans sister in India.  The new marriage has its own ups and downs with the proud, steady Darwan feeling uncertain about his new brides behavior. But its understandable.  Darwan works night and day, and has little time for his new bride.  Jasleens in a large city, and is afraid to leave the home.  She speaks little English.  When Jasleen ventures out, she meets a young woman from their temple at a nearby market, who takes her under her wing, and introduces her to the female congregants at their temple.  Darwan decides to end his night schedule and spend more time with his new wife, which is a breakthrough for Darwan and Jasleen.

This is a movie of those in mid-life crises, or those at the base of the summit of their golden years.  Its starting over for Wendy and new, unchartered, territory for Darwan.

This is a terrific movie with superb acting.",1497571200,4,1837,4.585889570552148

Stand by your character and your morals, believe in them and you will go far. Both Patricia Clarkson and Ben Kingsley gave stellar performances. Definitely a movie I would recommend.",1496016000,,396,4.513888888888889

7467470,3,B016BSPTZA,"I generally only view family friendly, inspiring movies these days. This one slid through as a recommendation and was listed as a comedy. It's light drama. I like being immersed in other cultures through film, and learning of them. So I was surprised that the setting was New York City, and the perspectives are through the eyes of NYC culture. There are plenty of F bombs and some sex scenes. Wendy, the main character is a spoiled, self-centered writer who gets dumped by her husband. It's all written from her perspective, and you root for her, yet her consistent selfishness echoes the pain she receives, from equally selfish family. Ben Kingsley is amazing as the extremely noble Indian Sikh driving instructor. He is full of warmth and kindness, despite having gone through hell itself. The film gives him about twenty seconds to explain how some of his family has been killed. The film doesn't explain where his warmth comes from at all. After all, it's Wendy's story.

His warmth is the driving point of the movie. It's the saving grace of the story.

The film isn't overly political, yet it does portray all the Indian immigrants as saints, and all Americans aside from Wendy and family are either treating them very badly or deporting them. Samantha Bee plays Wendy's sister. No real trace of conservatism here. While the film is about the redeeming quality of determined kindness and even forgiveness, it doesn't embrace other spiritual fruits.

Another oddity is the sexual tension between the two. Kingsley's character actually gets an arranged marriage bride during the time of the driving lessons, and makes a point to be true and kind to his newly arranged marriage bride, despite how she doesn't like him and is blatantly rude. The film leads you to believe He and Wendy will have a relationship, but they part ways while being fully attracted to each other... suggesting they will both be tempted to fool around despite His marriage. That part is just weird.

But overall, despite the setting, it has warmth and likeability. It's a slice of life, nicely done, yet not offering any real answers other than kindness.",1493078400,3,2132,4.8812154696132595

It was related because they both had things taken away from them that meant something very special to them. Which also put them into a position where they were scared. And then they were both being forced into a new life. Such as being forced to learn how to drive so she can see her daughter and live a new life as a single person. He was being forced into being married to a girl that he didn't really know. The two of them gritted their teeth and went through this new learning process, and learned from it, and came out ahead.

I believe the topic, class, race, country of origin, refugees, does not get the in depth treatment it deserves.

The acting is very good, and I thought the casting is appropriate. My only ""regret"" is that the director saw fit to include a sex scene. In my opinion it was not needed for the story line and actually somewhat detracted from the movie as a whole. I suppose it was a clumsy scene on purpose, but  as I said, it was not at all needed. The story captures two cultures and their differences very well.

Another than that it's a disappointing love story.",1484697600,,396,4.591549295774648

Broken up after a divorce, Clarkson runs into Kingsley, a Sikh driving instructor.  She doesn't drive, of course, is fearful of it (and life) and hesitates at every corner.  But Kingsley is cool and calm and steadily beginning to like this odd non-Sikh (I say that because in the film he is 100% dedicated to tradition and culture and is getting ready for his arranged marriage).  A few odd words, an uncomfortable set of dates and meetings on both sides and well, you get the picture.  But sadly, the pace is so, so tiring to get to the end (which you knew was coming) that by the time it arrives you're already done.  Great performances, don't get me wrong, but little else...all unfortunate.",1484092800,,869,4.532051282051282

7469024,4,B016BSPTZA,"A charming adult romance with an unexpected but entirely plausible resolution.  Lovely performances by Patricia Clarkson and Ben Kingsley.  This is the kind of movie that passes unnoticed through the Metroplex because nothing in it explodes and though there is sex scene it is played for laughs.  (And I laughed out loud!) Both of the leads are such good actors that they can take a slender plot built around driving lessons and make something of every scene.  Look, for example, at the way Kingsley's character walks and moves and how those postures and gestures fill out the character and tell you something about his inner resolve.  Or watch how subtly Clarkson renders the hurt and confusion of a betrayed wife attempting desperately to deny the reality of a failed marriage. The seemingly small choices these actors make in every scene add life and color to material that, in lesser hands, would seem stagey and forced.",1482192000,4,924,4.935483870967742

7469312,4,B016BSPTZA,"Who'd have thought that the otherwise innocuous act of learning to drive could be a metaphor for learning to live? This tender, gentle movie is another hidden gem in Amazon's vast movie library. While the pacing is at times frustratingly somewhere between tortoise and snail speed, much like the fits and starts of a new driver, the movie does develop into a story about two unlikely individuals, tossed together by circumstance, who find that what they can learn from each other far outreaches the vehicle (pun intended) of a middle-aged writer in a disintegrating marriage, learning to drive from a Sikh immigrant taxi driver. While you may be tempted to turn it off after ten or fifteen minutes, stick with it and you'll be rewarded with a charming story, uplifted by the excellent acting of Patricia Clarkson and Ben Kingsley, that provides a very different slice of life and character development, and reminds us that we can always learn from the kindness of others.",1481155200,,971,4.926829268292683

What I appreciated was is was Not predictable, which keeps the audience connected to the characters and not only the story. The in depth work of the characters is fulfilling. If you are looking for an action-loaded movie with common tricks, this is not the film for you. There are twists and turns as each character explores their own challenges, perceptions, culture, habits...The emphasis is not on culture as much as it is on their courage to break through their own disappointments and discover a new approach to their personal situations as they learn from each other.",1481155200,,644,4.91743119266055

This could've been a much better movie, and didn't offer material that a talented actor like Ben Kingsley could use as a vehicle to an Oscar nomination. In fact, it's a bit sad that Kingsley has seemingly been typecast into the ""wise Indian"" after his award-winning performance in Ghandi. Whatever, he's still a pleasure to watch, and the rest of the cast were up to the task, as well. Well worth seeing once, at any rate.",1479168000,,551,4.872340425531915

Ben Kingsley's acting was awkward and stilted... probably because he was trying to pull off Brownface when he can't.  You'd think he would have learned better after attempting it in Gandhi.

The movie is more than ""driving"" but for anyone who doesn't drive or wishes they didn't have to drive, this movie will resonate.

Instead the director, the actors and the script were realistic, with no easy answers offered. There is self-deprecating humor, and comic moments of cross-cultural tension.

Lovely concept, on all sorts of levels, the two leads are comfortable and the acting is good, a bit slow-moving and a tad too sweet, but thats what fairy tales are supposed to be, eh?

7469675,4,B016BSPTZA,"Patricia Clarkson is always a treat and Ben Kingsley is a bonus.  He is one of those rare male actors who just reinforces the performances of his female colleagues.  Another plus was the movie had older, more mature actors as the leads instead of the seemingly never ending supply of less mature actors.

7469784,5,B016BSPTZA,"This movie is about learning to be tolerant (of people of other cultures) AND to be intolerant enough to be able to break off relationships when they really need to be ended.  The relationship of marriage has been addressed in a lot of other good movies, but few show how to get along with otherwise-discriminated-against immigrants (who wear beards and turbans).  Kingsley of course played a perfect man of India years ago.  Now he plays such a man again but now that man has to learn things too, especially about the assumptions of his old and new cultures, and how to love, under both new and old rules.  The acting in this new movie is perfect, and way above the average silly rom-com. This movie is Serious.  A view from a moral mountain top.  (Not for little kids, just not.

7469794,5,B016BSPTZA,"Patricia Clarkson is a great actress. I don't know if I first saw her in The Station Agent or Lars and the Real Girl, but she won me over right away. She can play sweetness and light or tormented or persnickety. You need it, Patricia Clarkson can do it.

In Learning to Drive, she's joined by no less than Sir Ben Kingsley, who plays Darwan, a Sikh Indian taxi driver and driving instructor who is troubled by his new, arranged marriage. Clarkson is Wendy, a book critic who is troubled by the sudden end of her longtime marriage and, perhaps even more important, her inability to drive.

Wendy lives in New York. Not driving has never been an issue because if her husband couldn't take her where she needed to go, she could take cabs or the subway. But then her daughter Tasha (Grace Gummer) wants Wendy to visit her at the farm where she has taken a temporary job, and where she has fallen in love. Wendy must learn to drive so she can make the journey to see her daughter.

Clarkson and Kingsley work together so well that they don't need to speak a great deal. Their emotions can be conveyed with a look or a few words. Learning to Drive, especially the relationship between Wendy and Darwan, never seems predictable to me. Instead, their emotional connection is touching, poignant, and amusing. Both characters need to learn to make other connections: Darwan with his new wife and Wendy with her daughter.

The movie also has a funny sexual escapade when Wendy goes on her first date after her marriage
breaks up, and she experiences Tantric sex. Oi!

Watch Learning to Drive for the screenplay and for the acting.

Learning to Drive earns The Janie Junebug Seal of Highest Approval.",1472947200,3,1688,4.591362126245847

7469815,4,B016BSPTZA,"This pleasant, rather sentimental, but well-written and well acted movie doesn't really hew very closely to the Katha Pollitt essay on which it is based, but don't let that stop you from seeing it.  In the essay -- which is a first-person report and reminiscence -- the emphasis falls inevitably on Pollitt herself and her predicament.  Here equal weight is given to the life transitions of the woman (here called Wendy Shields, and played by Patricia Clarkson) and her driving teacher, here not a Filipino but a Sikh called Darwan (Ben Kingsley), and as Wendy is moving on after the end of a marriage, Darwan is seeking an arrangement with a woman from India to come over to the USA (he is a citizen) and become his wife.  Neither character is young, so the sense of the difficulties involved in breaking long patterns of living is clear in both cases.  Wendy had never learned to drive while she was married, and the process of her learning stands for the process of her becoming aware in detail of a new kind of reality to which she must become attentive.  The advice that she gets from Darwan about driving applies to both their personal lives by metaphorical extension, and thanks to the writing and the acting the fairly unsensational tenor of their lives is made absorbing and interesting.  When Darwan's wife -- whom he had never met before -- arrives, she and Darwan both have to learn to adjust, and the efforts are sometimes painful and sometimes comic.  Wendy tends to be skeptical about such arranged marriages . . . but we see that her own, freely entered into, hasn't turned out very well . . .

Clarkson and Kingsley develop a lovely rapport in the movie -- their characters come to depend on one another for different kinds of support, and so the end of the lessons (Spoiler: Wendy gets her license!) is a more painful parting than each, I think, believed possible.  At the same time, the sense of both having taken steps forward is clear.  The movie is economically (90 minutes!) and unobtrusively effective in its direction by Isabel Coixet, there is a sub-plot involving Darwan's undocumented relatives that is touched on but not overblown, and the supporting actors are fine: Grace Gummer plays Wendy's daughter, Samantha Bee (!) her sister, and arriving late but making a vivid impression, Sarita Choudhury is Jasleen, who becomes Darwan's wife.  Sentimental, yes -- but very well done.  And, the title notwithstanding, it's more about becoming attentive than taking control -- not that the two are sharply distinguishable.",1471651200,,2545,4.825287356321839

I love how Ben Kingsly brings this man of the Seek to life - his struggles - his quest to be centered. What works about this movie is the Character's and their conversations, more than a final destination - even though there is an outcome, the outcome flows out of the intention, rather than a have to - if that makes any sense.

Despite their differences and personal stories, they both grow to appreciated each other over the course of the film, as well as help each other grow. A fairly subtle movie that left us feeling good, caring about the characters, and still talking about it over the next several days -- all marks of a good film. If your taste is for movies with car chases, this isn't it. But if your are looking for a quiet, subtly funny, and moving experience, it's worth giving this a try.",1469232000,2,579,4.576923076923077

7470076,5,B016BSPTZA,"What an exciting surprise!  Patricia Clarkson plays Wendy, a literary critic and author, newly and naturally  unhinged by the departure plus perfidy of her husband.  Ben Kingsley is Darwan, an Indian Sikh, naturalized American, and the driving instructor enlisted to teach Wendy.  Swathed in the learning-to-drive metaphor, Wendy begins to regain control, calm, and confidence behind the wheel, under the tutelage of the wise and waxing metaphysical Darwan. Darwan, in exchange, is schooled by Wendy in the subtleties,  sensibilities, and creative romancing of his new wife from an arranged marriage. Sarah Kernichan's writing is smart, neatly woven, and wonderfully funny.  Isabel Coixet's directing is precisely on point. This is a quality film.",1466899200,17,747,5.625

I like it's very understated presentation and story development; an unlikely, cross-cultural friendship that enhances both lives. It's refreshing to encounter a film today that is successful without all the flash-bang-in-your-face CGI, violence and graphic sex. The sexual tension is an undercurrent used expertly and in just the right amount. The main character arcs are explored and developed perfectly. Other reviewers have given a synopsis; so I will not be redundant here. Suffice it to say that this was a very entertaining and uplifting movie experience for me; and feel confidant that it will be the majority of film fans everywhere. Another good pick from Amazon Prime.",1466899200,,731,5.310344827586207

7470120,5,B016BSPTZA,"Two nuanced and dynamic performances from two stellar actors. A great ""thinker's"" movie for anyone who appreciates real-life storytelling and maturity in a film for grown-ups. If you're a Patricia Clarkson fan, you will continue to scratch your head why nobody has given her an Oscar yet. She breathes life into a woman whose familiar world, however dysfunctional, is falling apart, and you want to scream and kick and retreat to safety with her at the same time you want her to do the hard thing in facing reality head-on and forging a new path. The driving lessons she takes are just a metaphor for finding her wings.
As for Ben Kingsley, the only struggle I had in accepting his character was the hair dyed unnaturally dark to make him appear younger than he really is.(My guess? He's about 12- 15 years older than Clarkson.) That said, he does an excellent job conveying the sacrifice and commitment of a Sikh to age-old traditions as well as a personal commitment to generosity and kindness despite innumerable persecutions. (The racial profiling scene is one of the best descriptions of what I imagine reality to be in today's America for so many of the nation's naturalized citizens.)
With the bar set so high by the primary actors, supporting roles are fleshed out with equal nuances. As Clarkson's husband, Jake Weber/Webber? doesn't deliver merely cheap shots as the philandering spouse who abandons his wife, but conveys an equally frustrated and flawed man who finally lost patience with status-quo long-suffering and forced his wife to see her blind spots. The awkward, humor-laden agony of conversation when he returns home to pack some of his remaining books is brilliantly conceived by the director and carried out by both Clarkson and Weber. And the beautiful and graceful actress playing Kingsley's new wife in a traditional, arranged (unknown) Sikh marriage is also layered with loneliness and fear of the unknown.
This film is untraditional to the core, and well-worth the watch.",1466380800,13,1999,5.006006006006006

I was not disappointed, but I will say that this movie may not be for those who don't appreciate an understated, quiet movie.  The performances are top-notch, and the characters are certainly well developed.  Learning how to drive, and the independence and freedom it offers is certainly evident, and provides the catchy title, but, as in a lot of character driven movies, there is so much more to learn about life's experiences.",1465257600,,546,4.849462365591398

They are thrust together when the jilted reviewer, who has never learned to drive, engages him to teach her. The story unfolds from here, exploring both lives in depth. The coming together produces sad, funny and heartfelt moments.

Learning to Drive is not for everyone, but we found it an entertaining diversion. I gave it four stars because we found the ending to be a bit clumsy...other than that the movie is worth seeing.",1465171200,,658,5.036697247706422

7470261,4,B016BSPTZA,"This is one of those small, quiet films that packs a punch. A simple tale that is given even more dimension and ""weight"" by virtue of its two stars: Ben Kingsley and Patricia Clarkson.

There are those who will think it's primarily a story about a marriage ending (badly) and a chance encounter with someone who can help Clarkson's character when she most needs to overcome her fears.

Others may see it as a story about the difficulties of integrating into a new culture while still holding to traditional beliefs.

In any event, it was delightful to watch Kingsley and Clarkson's characters interact. Kingsley continues to amaze with his ability to become a character while Clarkson continues her roles with emotional depth and nuance.

There's not all that much dialogue or plot but the two main characters convey a lot through their interaction and facial expressions (Clarkson).

7470355,3,B016BSPTZA,"Despite the excellence of Sir Ben Kingsley, and Patricia Clarkson's acting in ""Legendary"" the script and story development of this film is so lacking in EQ  (emotional intelligence) it was mostly repulsive.

The basic story may not have been too bad:  an Indian man, a Sikh, made it into the US - New York City - just before the door closed on religious sanctuary, but he is harboring his nephew illegally; a rich white woman's husband has moved out,
pursuing a divorce.  She keeps wailing and whining and asking ""Why, why,why?"" when he has told  her: he needs more attention and interest, and she is always at her computer.  She cannot even listen.  She is angry, sad, and needing understanding, but won't hear what is before her.

The Sikh teaches driving lessons; she has been driven everywhere by her now ex-husband, and takes quite a while to give up that luxury and decide to learn to drive a car herself, thus the two meet.  The rest of the story is her going through her grieving process, and the driving instructor patiently helping her learn how to survive.  Part of his life event is having his sister make an arranged marriage for him.  When the bride arrives,he can only see her ""faults"" and doesn't give her much time or attention to help her adjust to a new environment, culture and language.

She is trying hard, but needs a little kindness and encouragement, which hubby is not available at home to give, and, although this is a subplot, is my favorite part of the movie!  Perhaps it is because she is so innocent, honest and open, and I felt what she was feeling easily, even the depth of her depression, because somehow, she communicated she wouldn't stay there for long.

And indeed, she did not:  one day she ran out of sanitary napkins, and getting up her courage, made it outdoors down the street to the nearest market.  She went up to one of the the worst mannered clerks I've seen, tried to communicate what she needed, even showing her, the clerk, the package with one s/n still in there, clearly able to be seen, but the clerk wouldn't even look at it or her, just kept looking away, and, turning, walked in the other direction!  Apparently this was a neighborhood inhabited by many refugees, because another Indian woman witnessed the distressing scene, and came forward to help the new bride!  The next scene is bride and new friend are surrounded by many other Indian lady friends all comfy together in the living room,  laughing, eating and sharing stories!

Yes, hubby comes home to see his wife revitalized; the whiny white lady finally learns to drive, moves out of the marriage house and into a new apartment and life, but the parts don't hang together.

Yes, the acquaintanceship turned into a friendship somehow - that part I seemed to have missed - they may have helped each other get through bad patches in each of their lives, but that wasn't too obvious to me,either, but the differences didn't add up to a whole, not to mention that either the acting or the writing kept me from connecting to the two main characters as human beings thus missing their  own inner transformations.  This is not  one I will watch again.",1464134400,2,3159,4.63016157989228

Look for Grace Gummer like her sister she is goin' down the acting trail just like her, mother, Meryl Streep.  Grace Gummer even sounds like her mother.

7470376,1,B016BSPTZA,"What a disappointment... The trailer misleads one to believe this is a humorous, sensitive, well-dramatized, beautifully crafted, human interest story with nuance and depth. Clarkson and Kingsley further elevate one's hopes because both are fine actors, yet they are limited and hobbled by weak material, 2-dimensional characters, shallow story-telling, and poor writing, direction, and film-making as a whole.  Aside from the gratuitous, excessive f-bombs and creative name-calling [c*ck s*cker] from the immediate onset, and in keeping with that moniker, there is extensive discussion between Clarkson's character, soon-to-be divorced, grieving-because-her-husband-cheated-and-left-her Wendy  and Wendy's staid, married sister Debbie about ""blowjobs,"" (and Debbie states that her ""mouth is retired with a pension plan."")  In another scene, Debbie sets Wendy up on a blind date with a ""Banker and Opera Buff and Gourmet"" who shows of at the restaurant by ordering in French and announces he practices ""tantric yoga,"" and later, after dinner, this enters into a prolonged, ridiculously silly ""tantric sex"" scene in which Wendy asks her date when he will ""come"" and more bizarre conversation about ejaculation goes on and on.  Then, there is a continuous thread of political agenda regarding immigrants (both legal and illegal... repeated demands by law enforcement for ""Papers!"" from the American citizen/asylum recipient/protagonist Darwan (Kingsley's character.)  There is hyperbolic portrayal of xenophobia, stereotypes, ignorance about Sikhs, fish-out-of-water scenarios, and more.  Then, some of the content is just flat-out stupid...e.g. There's a scene where Darwan's arranged marriage bride Jasleen ventures out to a neighborhood store with what is obviously a partial package of maxi-pads in hand, shows them to and attempts to ask an African American female store clerk where she can find  more of this type of product to purchase, unhelpful store clerk hatefully says, ""I can't read what that says!"" (ostensibly it's an Indian product labeled in a foreign language) and expresses over-the-top annoyance and uncooperativeness.  Finally, another woman intervenes, scolds the clerk, tells the clerk she knew all along that the customer was asking about where to find sanitary napkins, and the clerk sullenly and grudgingly tells them the aisle number... so many stupid, wrong things with this scene... Nobody would bring the package of pads with them to the store; one could walk every aisle/section of the small, corner store and eventually independently find the feminine hygiene section for oneself, a female clerk (heck, any clerk probably) wouldn't think anything about telling a customer where to find the item was looking for; it would take less energy and effort than spouting xenophobic, disdainful, poorly acted, overreactive comments... (and, hey, since the hateful, unhelpful clerk was African American, maybe umbrage should be taken against the filmmakers for such a negative portrayal since this is all about diversity and cultural sensitivity.)  I could continue on about the bad quality of the script, shoddy cinematic devices, but I won't.  Bottom line:  I'm not thin-skinned nor overly sensitive... I've studied, analyzed, and critiqued film and literature for decades and am not fazed by edginess or off content that contributes to the plot (and doesn't serve as filler for a non-existent or extremely weak plot.)  Furthermore, it has become extremely obvious to me why ""Learning to Drive"" never made it to our local theaters, to Redbox, to U-verse, etc. This movie is so unacceptable, I'm not even going to donate it to Goodwill or the local public library. What an epic failure of a Mother's Day gift... Amazon should provide a refund, but I shredded this worthless DVD.",1462752000,13,3799,5.542314335060449

Ben Kinsley is amazing as a Sikh trying to make it in the big apple, Patricia Clarkson dynamic as a wife and mother faced with divorce and trying to be independent.

7470435,5,B016BSPTZA,"We loved this film.  Patricia Clarkson's name on a film tells us that it will be small in scope, but intelligent and well-scripted, with the emphasis on character development - exactly the kind of film we enjoy.  This one is no different.

Briefly, after Wendy is dumped by her husband, she decides to learn to drive and takes driving lessons from Darwan, a Sikh gentlemen who drives a cab for a living.  He is the soul of calm and focus and talks her down from the rage of loss and abandonment that consumes her.  As he patiently teaches her to drive, she applies his lessons to the rest of her life as well and a gentle friendship develops between them.  His life is not without drama, either, as he proceeds with an arranged marriage with a newly arrived woman who speaks no English and is truly a stranger in a strange land.  As the film ends, we see Darwan beginning to grasp and commit to what his new wife really needs from him, as Wendy drives off, new license in hand, not knowing if they will ever see each other again - we sense they won't - but assured that she is in command of her life once again.

HIghly recommended.",1458432000,2,1132,4.331753554502369

7470437,5,B016BSPTZA,"Now and then along comes a film with a quiet little story about they way we are walking through our lives  a glance at a situation in communication and relationships of friends that makes the film soar above the often tedious riffraff of Marvel comics and gangster action films  - an becomes a memorable experience that merits seeing again and again. Written by Sarah Kerochan and directed by Isabel Coixet (Elegy, Paris, je t'aime, My Life Without Me, The Secret Life of Words), one of the primary reasons the film works such magic are the consummate performances by Patricia Clarkson and Ben Kingsley. The chemistry among all the cast members is on target.

Wendy (Patrician Clarkson), a self-absorbed New York book critic, is shocked to reality by the sudden end of her marriage to Ted (Jake Weber) and the decision by her daughter Tasha (Grace Gummer) to live as a farmer in Vermont. Always dependent on her husband for driving, she must now learn to take the wheel on her own. Her instructor Darwan (Ben Kingsley) is a Sikh Indian, living in America after being jailed in India for political reasons and working two jobs as a taxi driver and a driving instructor, who watches with alarm as his pupil falls apart at the seams. He himself is contemplating an arranged marriage with Jasleen (Sarita Choudhury), a woman he has never met. As these two lives intersect, both will change in unpredictable ways, discovering aspects in each others backgrounds, beliefs, vocabularies and philosophies.

This is an example how a little gentle film can become immensely impressive when in the hands of pros such as Clarkson and Kingsley. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, March 16",1458432000,3,1671,4.893992932862191

Unfortunately, the movie trailer was better edited than the movie and it basically showed what the movie could have been. And wasn't. There was a lot of opportunity for humor that was sort of glossed over or lost in the director's attempt to make this a drama. I think that was a mistake.
I appreciated the metaphor of learning to drive, and there were some nice poetic moments when Ben Kingsley was explaining about driving and it was clear that what Patricia Clarkson was hearing was about life.
In a lot of ways it was a good movie, very sweet, and maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't anticipated the movie I had seen in the trailer.

Patricia Clarkson is wonderful as woman going through major transitions in her life (""third round of seven-year itch""). And Ben Kingsley opens the world of a Sikh gentleman, living in the US to the audience, also evolving as a person.

7470532,4,B016BSPTZA,"If you're looking for a film that's got some humor about some of the difficult life events someone might go through, then Learning to Drive will work for you.  Ben Kingsley is great, as he is in most things, as Darwan, the driving instructor who is dealing with an arranged marriage later in life.  Patricia Clarkson is also fantastic as Wendy, the woman whose husband has just left her.  The two come together when Wendy begins taking driving lessons from Darwan.  Somewhat predictably they learn some important lessons from each other.

The set up includes some less than humorous situations but the film and the actors never take themselves so seriously as to get completley caught up in the depressing stuff.  Even when there is sadness there can be hope and joy and laughter.  In the end, you'll feel better about yourself and maybe a little inspired to tackle some of the things in life that are perceived hinderances to fully living life.  Upbeat, hopeful, has some laughs, and overall the type of film that packages the frustration and triumph of Learning to Drive in a neat hour and a half package.",1455321600,2,1107,4.729166666666667

7470538,5,B016BSPTZA,"If a seven-year itch determines a husbands inclination for some change, well, Wendy (Patricia Clarkson) and her husband, Ted (Jake Weber) have made it through three. But suddenly he wants to completely capsize the marriage ship while leaving Wendy behind and treading the water towards a younger woman. This devastates Wendy, his razor-tongued, sharp-witted book critic wife who has relied on him as a spouse for years and even for getting around; he did all of the driving (but, never discount the Mrs.). Now as things drastically change for her, she must learn to drive for herself around Manhattan then and it is going to take one patient person. Her daughter, Tasha (Grace Gummer), is back to Vermont now and must remain there even if it is not going so well for her. If she comes home it will be in the spirit of failure as she is having guy troubles too. It would truly be a deadly choice to return so it certainly cannot be her to teach her mother. Wendy has an interesting and confident sense of herself always and that biting sense of humor that anyone would expect from Patricia Clarkson.

Her instructor is a complete story of his own; a man proud to belong to America, his home, and very proud of his Indian heritage. Darwan (Ben Kingsley) is a calm Sikh man who is already a driving instructor and a cab driver, so the man is experienced  but is he ready for Wendy? He has emigrated from India where the culture is matched in his mood and now to the frenzy of New York City. So, at this point, one could say Wendys surroundings match her mood as she begins getting behind the wheel; At least, were moving! At first, they have open clashes of personality in this slower paced character development, but they soon take an interest, or, at least, a curiosity in how different cultures view the institution of marriage. Wendy just cannot get over how it works that Darwan would marry someone he doesnt even know, hasn't seen and arranged for him to marry in the first place. How could this be? There are the definite differences in opinion that only lead to wit and sarcasm that is fun and entertaining between them. As Wendy takes on more lessons, her confidence grows. She begins to question Darwan about marriage, life and everything going on in their platonic relationship. Darwans promised wife is Jasleen (Sarita Choudhury) and he often wonders what the American way is to show love and affection to his new bride. This makes for a lively banter and wonderment on both their sides as Darwan is having much conflict in showing affection while Jasleen must adapt to a totally new, wildly paced and unusual culture of people, places, and things. Nothing comes easy for the new couple or for Wendy, but while riding in the car together becomes more than just learning to drive; it becomes learning to live again.

With a screenplay written by Sarah Kernochan and fine direction by Isabel Coixet, we are introduced to different cultures, people, along with a teacher and his student that aim to please. This is definitely a project of the love of diversity and adversity that makes each of us quite special. I adored these warm and lovely characters who took their time getting to where they needed to be. Getting to know each other while showing us just how much there is to learn from people who enter our lives. The definite strengths are the lengths of time in the character building that was worth each second and two cultures joining' hands to share the necessity of life and love.",1455148800,17,3497,4.646203554119547

When you have a film with Patricia Clarkson and Ben Kingsley, you expect an excellent film. What we have here, is a good film, and the characters elevate the film in spite of itself. Clarkson plays Wendy whose marriage has come undone, and in the middle of a fight with her husband, she leaves a manuscript in the back of a cab. Kingsley who plays Darwan, is driving the cab. Darwan is a Sikh, who had immigrated to America after a torturous time in India.  Darwan teaches driving, and when he returns the manuscript, Wendy sees his Student Driving sign and signs up for driving lessons. This becomes a film about finding yourself in a time of stress and less about learning to drive. Wendy's daughter, is in Vermont working on a farm and if Wendy is to see her, she must drive to Vermont.

We meet Wendy's sister and husband and a new lover. Wendy is a book critic, and by all accounts is very successful. We also meet Darwan and the people he lives with in a small apartment. He is mentoring his nephew who does not seem to have a green card. Nephew is trying to fix Darwan up with a wife, but it is  Darwan's sister who arranges a marriage with a local woman in her community in India. The arranged marriage causes issues, but Darwan is an honorable man.

The film is lovely and often serious and then humorous. It will probably be overlooked, but any film with Patricia Clarkson and Sir Ben Kingsley should be seen.

7470623,2,B016BSPTZA,"Way too much use of the F-word, and a pretty graphic sex scene.  Ben Kingsley is WONDERFUL, like always!  Dragging in places, not nearly as good as I had hoped.  Not a movie I would recommend.",1453766400,5,192,4.277777777777778
7470624,3,B016BSPTZA,Could have been good but too many unnecessary crude scenes and dialogue. Droll story with a truncated ending.,1453766400,3,109,5.111111111111111

7470632,3,B016BSPTZA,"Hubby and I were going to enjoy a lovely movie-date night... We turned this off after about 35 minutes. I know that somewhere over the next hour or so it would've gotten charming and romantic, and perhaps even poignant However the first half hour is angry, anti-love, marriage, and certainly not ""date night"" material. I may watch it alone some other time.",1453680000,2,356,4.758064516129032

8736231,4,B016BSPTZA,"I've gotten to the age that I prefer movie like this one.  A slice of life where ones goes through some sort of life changing experience - no matter how mundane or traumatic.  This movie isn't just about a woman's shock about finding out her husband is leaving her or even about learning to drive - something she's never had to do.  It's about finding her inner strength to deal with the change.  The denial, the hurt, all the emotions such a change evokes in the person being abandoned by their spouse.  It about the coming to terms with life, those who encourage us to forge ahead, to learn things we never thought we'd ever need to learn.  It's about a sheltered academic who learns about ethnic prejudice, cultural differences, making adjustments & much more -  all shown in the span of less than 2 hours.  Nicely done.  I'm beginning to ""fall in love"" with small independent films because they have heart.",1535587200,,910,4.567901234567901

8736235,5,B016BSPTZA,"This is a sweet movie, optimistic, and not without its charms. The acting is lovely and entertaining. There is nothing challenging or biting, which means it is wholly idealized and has very little to do with reality, but on most Friday nights, this is exactly what I need.",1533945600,,272,4.6875
