8056957,3,B000936OU8,"La Fleur du Mal aka The Flower of Evil isn't quite Chabrol on auto-pilot, but he's clearly more interested in the usual bourgeois side issues than the identity of the author of an anonymous leaflet that threatens Natalie Baye's campaign to become mayor of a small town by raking over the coals of the family's history of murder and Nazi collaboration. History is obviously going to repeat itself, but there's no sense of impending dread, merely a feeling that Chabrol has left himself too little time to remember the plot and wrap it up. Thus we get a somewhat hurried finale that feels practically like an afterthought - you can almost imagine him looking at his watch and thinking ""Is that the time? I'd better kill someone so we can all go home."" It's at its best dealing with local politics and petty ambitions on the campaign trail, and Baye and Suzanne Flon have the best of the film, but Chabrol's reunion with La Ceremonie scripter Caroline Eliacheff seems far more a time-filler than an essential.",1201046400,,1006,4.721590909090909
8056958,5,B000936OU8,"Claude Chabrol's ""La Fleur du Mal"" is as tightly structured as a Moliere comedy or a Shakespeare drama: nothing is left to chance, everything is accounted for, from the lampshade in a home office to the neatly stacked and folded shirts packed in a suitcase. Chabrol is also fastidious about his mise en scene: from the dcor and the photography to the clothing and jewelry.

Chabrol has focused his microscope on a family, riddled with the sins of their ancestors that once again come to the forefront in the form of a hate letter aimed at the mother, Anne (Nathalie Baye) during her bid for mayor in a small French provincial town. It's the middle class, the Bourgeoisie that Chabrol views with contempt here: their insistence on sweeping things under the carpet, their not talking about things better discussed and their fascination with those with more money and a better lineage.

Despite the fact that most of these people are pretty despicable, guilty of the worst kind of betrayal, ""La Fleur du Mal"" is nonetheless fascinating to watch as Chabrol pieces his story together, layering scene upon scene, dissecting and surgically removing all the false faces and peeling away the fake smiles.

Benoit Magimel (The object of Isabelle Huppert's affection in ""The Piano Teacher"") as Francois and Melanie Doutey as Michele add sexual heat to the surroundings and also a clear dislike for what is going on. But I think Suzanne Flon as the eldest member of the family is the one who really holds the film together: her portrayal of Tante Line has seen it all, literally and has used her experience wisely by turning it into wisdom not archness or conceit.

""La Fleur du Mal"" is Chabrol at his best, at his smartest, at his shrewdest and as such begs viewing by anyone interested in Contemporary film.",1129334400,3,1797,4.805825242718447
