8101904,5,B000CSRP7Q,"This is one of the greatest and best movies I have ever seen in the Spanish language.  It is really touching. Although it is sad to watch the scene of illness of one of the characters, however it has an ending of having accomplished the dreams not only of the ill character but also of the rest of the characters in the movie.  The colors of the movie are very good, the music is spectacular and it honors the music of all these great composers.  It is a very nice plot presented in this movie.  I recommend people to see this great movie. I always love this kind of musical movies.",1319932800,,582,4.216216216216216
