With this being said, one of the disappointments with this DVD set is that it is too bad that the ""instructor""/""sifu"" Au does not actually go through the forms, mainly.  Instead he takes on more of a narrator role in describing what is being done and having one of his students perform according to his direction.",1473638400,,435,4.564102564102564

8589669,4,B00D4ZTVVM,"I was very pleased with the thorough explanation of the basics in volume 1. You'll find that few supplementary materials on the stance practice are needed (I recommend following the advice in Wong Kiew Kit's book 'Art of Shaolin Kungfu'). Volume 2 has a great explanation of the One Finger Zen dymanic intensity technique which is one of the most fascinating aspects of Hung Gar for me. By using this technique you can make your movements in the solo forms have the same effects as weight lifting. I've been testing this concept and it works. Unfortunately Au Sifu doesn't use dynamic intensity in each movement (at least not on these DVDs). For an example of that see the 'Tiger and Crane Shaolin Kungfu' DVD with Sifu Chiu Chi Ling.

Now I say that volumes 3 and 4 are supplementary because they only capture a practice session where Au Sifu is guiding students in the form. He pauses occasionally to correct or add some application info, but not for many movements. The names of the movements are also left unsaid most of the time. This isn't bad if you want to just follow along like you are in the class, but you'll need supplementary instruction to get the whole picture of the first two ""pillars"" of Hung Gar. I recommend checking out the DVDs put out by Guangzhou Beauty. Some of those have great instruction.",1378080000,4,1317,4.628205128205129
