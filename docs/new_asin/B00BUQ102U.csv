8574158,5,B00BUQ102U,"Comforting Skin is a movie about a depressed woman named Koffie who hears voices.  These voices slowly take over her mind and make her go crazy after taking over her mind.  Warning- my review contains SPOILERS!

In the beginning we se Koffie having a conversation with a sarcastic guy named Nathan.  He gives the waitress a hard time over a sausage dish on the menu and makes it about hashbrowns and eggs.  Koffie takes her younger sister to stores, gets a tattoo and tries on dresses.  She struggles to fit in but seems content. She wants to reconnect with a boyfriend named Alan that she runs into but he rejects her.  Koffie tries to drown herself in a bathtub after Alan says he'd rather do someone who's sane.  Not nice man!  Koffie falls in love with Nathan.  She wants to know why Nathan didn't try having sex with her one time and thinks she's damaged goods.  She wants to know why she can't get anyone to love her.  This is the reason for her frustration and low-confidence.  She says she doesn't feel anything

Koffie ties to cut herself with a razor... and when she does her arm fills up with blackness.  A voice tells her to relax as these tattoo marks appear on her stomach.  She leans her foot against the wall and thinks about shooting her toes as the tattoo spreads across her foot.  She lays down on the floor as the tattoos spread.  Koffie wakes up naked the next day wondering what happened.  She looks in the bathroom mirror as the tattoos continue spreading on her face while hearing a voice saying that Koffie should be pure.  She tries taking a cheese grater to her face while hearing voices that say ""No more scars, your skin is special"".  Koffie runs away as Nathan wants to talk to her in the kitchen.  Outside on the streets she hears ""Don't be afraid"" voices.  ""Last night you became something new, something special"".

Koffie says ""People are walking their dogs and I'm sitting here talking to my tattoo- I don't know what to say!""  The voice seems to be her skin speaking to her.  It says ""You want to feel again.  Just let go"".  She runs to her bedroom and covers her body but the tattoo spreads across her chest.  She feels really good in bed as the tattoos spread all over her body.  She's now being pleasured by something and uh... no comment.  I don't want to say how I feel about this. :)  Koffie talks to the voice afterwards.  She says her last boyfriend couldn't even look at her feet.  She's happy the voice is here and that she'll never have to be alone again.

While talking to Nathan in an elevator she hears voices say ""He doesn't seem to care, and you need to realize we need to take time for ourselves"".  Wow, she's definitely hearing voices in her head to an unhealthy extent and needs urgent help RIGHT NOW!  Koffie starts moaning in the elevator and says she needs to embrace the world around her and deal with the insanity of life.  She goes home and does her nails while having a conversation with this imaginary person or voice... except whatever this thing is has to be a demon of some kind because it makes tattoos appear on her body.  The voice says the two need to be together.

Koffie visits her family and they don't like her shoulder tattoo.  Koffie gets super upset at the dinner table with her mom, dad and younger sister.  She brings up the fact her mom was cheating for years and she'd just like to have a normal dinner and conversation with her family.  The way Koffie stabs the table with the knife is pretty sadistic.  At a party afterwards she sees the man from earlier (Alan) who wanted to have sex with someone sane.  The voice in her head says that she must be selfish.  Koffie walks up to Alan and tells him to have sex with someone insane, but uses words that aren't nearly as nice.

Koffie speaks out loud now.  She mentions a technique used at a hospital whenever she and this other man had an urge.  Helping this man helped Koffie stay sane.  He was as lost and vulnerable as she was.  She thinks this man would understand her condition.  The voice says ""But yet you couldn't hear the truth and you had to go and cut yourself"".  She throws her photo collection in the river.  Koffie goes home and dances while listening to music (at least I assume it's music- she could be hearing voices on those headphones after all!)  She does weird things like dump powder in a pot while sitting on the bathroom floor, and after jumping in the bathtub she takes the powder and dumps it on her body while getting a bath.  She's really happy now.

Koffie went from depressed to downright crazy.  Nathan tries to get into Koffie's apartment when Koffie's friend approaches him.  She's being a total jerk by sarcastically saying to him ""I see how you look at me!  I bet you like the way women are drawn!  ""We should just be honest right?  You never know what you can get if you just ask!""  She then tries to hit on Nathan but he walks away saying ""You're just a party girl who's past your expiration date.  You haven't figured that out yet"".  How mean but I guess she had it coming.  Nathan visits and questions Koffie in her apartment if something's wrong because she's extremely happy.  They dress up to go to a theater together.  However Koffie has to stay home.

The voices say ""Don't make excuses for him"" while she's brushing her teeth and getting ready.  ""He's had more fortunes than you, why should he have more?""  Koffie answers these questions by yelling out loud.  She questions why the voices are making this so difficult.  The voices say ""It's clear it doesn't matter what I want"".  This answer stuns Koffie.  She says of course it matters what the voices want.  The voices ask if Koffie wants to be alone with just her tonight. She says of course.

This means Nathan is going to the music performance alone.  He hears the music outside waiting for Koffie to show up.  Sorry man, she's busy with her voices.  He returns to Koffie's apartment and she asks how it went.  He says it was nice to hear it played out loud.  Koffie apologizes for standing him up.  Nathan asks who the guy is.  She says ""what?""  He says it's not a problem since he won't judge him.  Koffie thinks Nathan should ask questions such as ""Does he make you happy?  Is he nice?"" once in a while instead of thinking of himself only!  Nathan sincerely says he's happy for her.

The voices tell Koffie to let go of things she holds dear if she's ever to love herself.  She says it's difficult and wishes the voice could hear things the way she does.  The voice respond ""I do see things, and see things the way they are"".  Koffie tells the voice that she loves her (since the voice sounds female of course, so the voice has to be a her!)  The voice encourages Koffie to leave her job because it's dangerous.

Koffie's friend is upset when a relationship with her boyfriend or husband goes sour.  She's in the bathroom ready to fight.  She grabs a woman by the back of the head who simply walks in and beats the heck out of her after grabbing her hair.  Back home Nathan has his own anger issues.  He pushes the refrigerator around.  Koffie walks in and says he looks like crap.  She asks if he's okay since the refrigerator meant no harm.  He says he had a crazy idea that he and Koffie would just live here in this apartment for a long time.  She's happy he's being open finally, but doesn't want to live with him right now.

While taking off her jacket in the other room the voices ask her to explain what happened.  They want to know why Koffie is avoiding her (the voices) questions.  Koffie says ""Don't be silly!""  The voice says ""How is expressing myself being silly?""  Koffie says she hasn't been herself lately and it has nothing to do with her.  ""So she feel comfort in Nathan instead?"" the voice says.  The voice asks her not to see Nathan ever again.  She says ""But he's my friend!"".  The voice responds ""Don't lie to me!"" and says your body betrays you.  The voice gets sexual and jealous of Koffie's affection for Nathan.

Koffie cries in her bathtub.  After this Koffie promises never to talk to Nathan ever again.  She looks at her naked body in the mirror and makes gingerbread cookies.  She gets upset and slams the cookie ring down.  She invites her friend over.  They get drunk and her friend thinks chicks are jealous of both of them.  The friend thinks Koffie should sleep with Nathan.  Personally after the way her friend beat on that woman in the bathroom, I'd rather she didn't come around anymore but that's just me!  While Koffie uses the toilet Nathan sneaks around her bedroom.  He sees Koffie had cut herself on the sewing machine since there's blood on her clothes.  Koffie visits her younger sister on the playground.  She wants her sister to go with her but the young girl takes a step back and doesn't trust Koffie after that angry dinner outburst.

Koffie lies in bed depressed while her friend rubs her leg and massages her skin.  This doesn't look good.  Soon she touches Koffie's leg and tattoos appear all over.  Koffie asks how she knows abut the tattoos or voices.  The voice says she did it because Koffie never asked them how they feel, so the voices had to branch out to her friend.  The voices wanted Koffie to feel spiteful like she (the voice) did for Nathan.  The voice wants Koffie to believe in her (the voice).  She heads to a restaurant and asks the waiter if he ever gets lonely.  He says he has himself to talk to.  Koffie says ""You don't want to be doing that!""  Koffie would know ALL about this subject more than anyone, so please waiter, take her advice!  She says it's hard to know whether the voices are real or all head games.  She thinks the waiter is cute and starts to go down on him right there in the restaurant by taking his belt off.  Suddenly the burning tattoos cover her face and she lets go of the man's belt.

It's now apparent that these are more than just voices.  They're evil demons that make sure Koffie is never able to touch a man and feel affection.  She returns home and makes out with her friend in bed.  Now it seems the voices have officially entered Koffie's friend's mind and body.  They take each other's clothes off as the friend watches the tattoos spread over Koffie's chest.  Koffie's eyes turn red as her friend kisses all over her body.  After the sexual act Koffie's voices say they only wanted to understand her desires and mentions sexual stuff.  The voices say they used to fear death but now they know Koffie and the voices will always be together.  The tattoos have taken over her face.  Everything gets quiet.  Her friend tries grabbing Koffie but she jumps out of bed.

We now see Koffie alone in bed painting her toenails while the voices go crazy.  She hears way too many at once to make out anything being spoken.  Nathan comes in and says Alan explained everything, but she says ""It's my tattoo and no one else can have it!""  She wants to know who's at the door and Nathan says it's a friend who can help.  Koffie screams ""Leave us alone!"" while Nathan grabs her to try and calm her down.  Nathan and Koffie take a ride to the tattoo parlor.  Koffie says her condition is special.  You can tell by the look on her face she completely lost it.  The voices say ""Remember you are my everything, my shelter"".  Nathan tries to show her tattoo pictures at the parlor but she says ""It's mine and nobody can have it!""  In the tattoo parlor her female friend is getting a tattoo.  Koffie explodes and smacks the man giving her friend a tattoo.  Nathan watches Koffie take a step back as the tattoos take over her face.  The friend attacks Nathan while Koffie locks herself in the backroom.

The voices tell Koffie ""They're trying to separate us"".  Koffie says she can't go on like this anymore.  The voices say ""I'm dying and to think I can't go on without you"" as another voice says ""You can't go on without me"".  The voices say to Koffie that she needs to kill herself, but she says she just needs to see the tattoos appear up her leg one more time.  The voices say ""I'm always here"" and then Koffie cuts her foot with the knife.  She doesn't kill herself though.  She kills the voices and perhaps loses a leg though.  Nathan storms in and the movie ends.

The message of this movie is apparently this- if you go long enough without being sexually desirable you'll begin to hear voices, and these voices will convince you that everyone else is bad and that you should just love and enjoy yourself.  The story's strangely fascinating though, and the acting's really good, so I highly recommend it.",1500422400,,12529,4.426877470355731

8574163,5,B00BUQ102U,"Wow. Loved this one. I'm really surprised by the poor reviews here. I thought the lead actress (Victoria Bidewell) was brilliant - vulnerable, but evolving throughout. This performance, I hope, was noticed by some indie film show awards panel. I've got to really go against the ratings-grain here and give this five stars, if only for her remarkable performance in this role.

No, she's not classically attractive or whatever superficial nonsense some people might be judging her by, nor is this a simple, linear, ""easy"" story. It is complex, and brilliantly written and well directed, and it should make you uncomfortable - all good art should shake you at your foundations, if only a little bit.

Kudos to the male co-star, as well, as the two played off each other extremely well. I truly am blown away that this indie film isn't garnering more praise.

I loved her performance, and Im giving this film five stars as this is a must-see, in my book.",1421452800,3,951,4.786585365853658

8574165,4,B00BUQ102U,"Comforting Skin (Derek Franson, 2011)

The first half-hour or thereabouts of Comforting Skin is annoying in the extreme. It feels like it's going to be just another mumblecore movie (not even a mumblegore movie because, you know, no violence). You know the drill. Annoying characters you can't stand doing things they couldn't afford in the real world without anything much really going on around them. And then Koffie (Good Luck Chuck's Victoria Bidewell), our main character, gets her tattoo. And everything changes.

At the beginning, Koffie, co-worker Synthia (MVP: Most Valuable Primate's Jane Sowerby), and best-friend-who-Koffie-kind-of-wants-to-date-but-not-really Nathan (Road to Nowhere's Tygh Runyan) are exactly those people you loathe in the movies. Koffie and Synthia drink at the restaurant they both hate working at (they keep working there because, presumably, they can drink freethey certainly can't afford the amount of alcohol they consume on tips), have endless conversations about life, try to decide whether Nathan's hot or not, discuss Synthia's parade of sugar daddies, you get the idea. Those of you who give up on the movie and turn it off during this section are missing out, though. Koffie, feeling insecure, gets a tattoo because she thinks it'll make her look sexy/mysterious/more attractive. And then it starts whispering to her.

NOTE: the rest of this review will reveal, and then talk about, the major spoiler for the film. While you may well have guessed it from the brief synopsis above, if you are sensitive to that sort of thing and plan on seeing the film (you should), stop reading now.

The final hour and change of Comforting Skin is as perfect a depiction of Koffie's descent into delusional anxiety and depression as one could ask for. I speak from experience; I was in the exact place Koffie ends up in the climax of this film a little less than seven months ago. So when I tell you that Franson (who also wrote) knows his stuff, well, it's fresh in my mind, delusions and all. The longer that section of the movie went, the more I could identify with her. While it doesn't allow me to excuse how shallow and horrible a person Koffie is during the first half-hour of the movie, it makes it a little more understandable, and you can put the first bit down to debut-film jitters. Especially since the rest of the movie belies the first part by making it hard to believe this is a first film. Franson seems to go from not knowing where to put a camera, and certainly having no clue when to cut a scene or to stop with the repetition of a theme, to being the guy who gets pace, tension, and the small, subtle points of perfect movie characterization better than at least half the big-name filmmakers working in Hollywood today. If only any character in Interstellar had been half as complex and realistic as Koffie in the last hour of Comforting Skin, it would have been the great film it thought it was.

The dark side of getting it that right is, well, you get it that right. A lot of the last hour of this movie is going to be very awkward to sit through if you're normal. (To be fair, it's just as awkward if you get it, but at least you can vouch for its veracity.) And while I understand where Franson was going in one particular scenewithout it being a major spoiler for one character, a lot of people had the same problem with Eric England going there in Contracted, though he knew what he was doing morehe may have been setting himself up for a lot of righteous anger from some people who will see that scene as marginalizing. Take it as you will; be warned you might be offended by it. Me, I was riveted to the screen the entire last hour of the film. Your mileage may vary. *** ",1417132800,5,3731,4.679878048780488
