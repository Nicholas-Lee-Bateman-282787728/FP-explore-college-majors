8419623,4,B004A8JICE,"This is a DVD that I have with Barry White singing live in concert in Germany, from 1975. What I like about this concert performance is not only seeing Barry White sing, but also seeing his appearance and how he looked back in that era in the 70's. It also features the Love Unlimited group singing 3 of their hits, and the Love Unlimited Orchestra band. Along with watching this concert performance, I would also listen to Barry White's music and 13 of his first albums on CD's that I have and that came out in the same era as this concert perfomance, and music from the Love Unlimited group that I also have on a CD called ""The Best of Love Unlimited."" And about me having this concert performance on DVD, I have the DVD sitting in a jewel case by itself, and the DVD case is sitting in a zip-lock bag with all of Barry White's original cd's and albums that I have as a duplicate.

I also remember when Barry White passed away, and this concert performance brings back memories of him and how great of a singer he was.",1419724800,,1020,4.284974093264249

8419625,2,B004A8JICE,barry did more talking than singing. seems like the dvd was more about promoting the girl group because they had more performance time than him. i don't recommend this particular dvd if you want a descent barry white performance.,1336780800,2,229,4.897435897435898
