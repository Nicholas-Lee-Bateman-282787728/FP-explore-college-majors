911372,5,6304678444,"I was afraid my DLP front-projector would not be compatible with the prism glasses, but I was wrong. Watching this DVD projected on a 120"" screen (sitting 10 feet away from the screen) trough the supplied glasses is mind blowing to say the least. I wanted to turn it off after a few minutes(?), because I felt it was too strong for my mind... but I was kinda paralysed and could not find the energy to press the ""stop"" button. This thing is dangerous, really!",1034121600,7,459,4.411764705882353
911373,5,6304678444,"This is a do-not-miss video that plays exceptionally well with any music. It's intricacies are mind blowing, thrilling, yet relaxing, subtle yet ""vivid"". If you position mirrors around your tv, light a few dim candles, the effect is enhanced and changes with each view. Comes with two sets of 3-D glasses and incense. A can't lose purchase!

2nd purchase to replace 1st. Just as relaxing and enjoyable as my first purchase of this vid!",1010534400,9,435,4.878378378378378
911374,5,6304678444,"This one of those videos that will work well with any music you watch it with. It really dose change every time. The prisem glasses really add to your ""trip"". I only wish a better set was availble. I hope to see other titles from this studio. Great as back-round video at a party or club.",1003622400,7,288,4.160714285714286
911375,5,6304678444,"This is a great video; it mesmerizes you for a long time!  One thing that I would reccommend doing is getting better glasses.  The glasses that come with this are ""ok"" but if you really want a good time, go to Spencer's and buy their Spectrix Laser Visors to go along with them and then you may ""oooh"" and ""ahhhh""!  But with the glasses, it is still 5 stars!",1001635200,11,358,4.159420289855072

911377,4,6304678444,"If you like kaleidoscope-video(like this), you will like ""Liquified"" also.
I give 4 stars because I think ""Luminous Visions"" is better.
Have a nice trip!",945043200,,153,5.16
911378,5,6304678444,"I would encourage anyone who takes his psychedelic artwork seriously to invest in a DVD player and purchase this right away.  No joke, I have been to about 125 Grateful Dead concerts, and was blown away well I saw this on  my HI-Fi system!",922752000,3,239,4.409090909090909

7875760,4,6304678444,"This has to be the most unique ""movies"" I've ever owned. I got this back when it first came out on VHS.  When viewed with special prism glasses (two came with the video), the television screen is transformed into a kaleidoscope....one colorful vision after another! I found that when you tilt your head, the TV image stands out even more and you get 3-D- like images in the background. All this is accompanied by psychedelic-type instrumental music, kind of mellow Jerry Garcia sounds and slower ""trance music"" of today.

The problem I found was that after 10-20 minutes, that's enough. As colorful as it is, it gets routine after awhile. Of course, I never tried this under any influence of anything and perhaps that's the secret to staying with it longer. In my younger days, I probably would have loved this.

In the last five minutes, the kaleidoscope images switched to just those of colorful balls. Wow, I wonder if this film was made for ""stoners?""

Ya think??",1235088000,,967,4.738095238095238
7875761,4,6304678444,pretty awesome indeed. This is a great video to zone out to and everyone I've watched it with loves it. good times;-),1218672000,,117,4.363636363636363
7875762,4,6304678444,"The prism glasses extend the viewing range beyond the edges of the screen by casting a ghostlike mirror reflexion of what is on the outer edges of the frame.  The effect is very impressive, though I'm not sure it's true 3D.  Probably not, since the program can be viewed without the glasses with no image doubling or overlapping.

Viewing it on a 100 inch screen with a ceiling mounted projector, I was simply blown away.  With the prism glasses on, the image seemed to fill the entire wall and covered most of my peripheral vision.  The colors were vibrant and the designs hypnotic.

If I have a complaint, it's that the kaleidoscopic patterns grow repetitive after a while.  I would have preferred more variety, like the amazing ""atom/star"" sequence near the end, about 49 minutes into the program.

The ""wow"" factor is very strong.  It's a great way to show off your home entertainment center and would look fantastic projected onto a wall at a party.",1115596800,16,954,4.698795180722891
7875763,5,6304678444,"This DVD was wonderful and hypnotic to watch. I was surprised how good it was. But there was another surprise. the DVD comes with 'prism' glasses that can be used to view other psychedelic videos you may have. Such as:
'Happy 2b Hardcore' by Moonshine/AVX.
'Transambient 1,2, and 3', also by Moonshine/AVX
'Spaced Out' also by Moonshine/AVX
The other 3 DVD's are also sold by Amazon so check them out.
It was fun to put these other DVD's on and watch them wearing the 'prism' glasses from Sydney's Psych Adventure and my own electronic music from my cd collection thumping away.
Anyway, Get this DVD you won't be dissapointed.",1087344000,18,626,4.752293577981652
7875764,5,6304678444,"Watch at night with prism glasses and a new world opens up. I ordered  five more prism glasses, it only  comes with one. You can use them to watch megamix on Mobyplay also.",1062201600,6,172,4.181818181818182
7875765,5,6304678444,"I read the reviews and was greatly pleased. All my friends enjoyed the dvd. Sad thing is, you only get one pair od 3-d glasses, which you definitly need. Good thing you can buy more for [money] each in an order form they give you with the dvd.",1047772800,5,243,4.083333333333333
7875766,4,6304678444,"I bought this DVD after watching ""Oddysey's Into the Mind's Eye"", since I was quite impressed by that title.  ""Headcandy""  was not what I expected, and was totally different from the previously mentioned DVD.
Even though it was totally different, this is still a mind-blowing DVD that must be watched.  This is all abstract, no defined pattern to it, all abstract.  One thing that annoyed me a little is that after a while, the pattern stayed the same.  It was all based in circles, triangles, squares & dots, that were all based in the CENTER of the screen, and from there each angle would split and form the same figure in all 4 corners of the screen.
That is not a defect, I just found it to be very uniform.  Another thing, is that the 3D glasses DO ADD an effect to viewing this DVD.  Without the glasses you will NOT experience the effect as it was meant to be.
I give it 4 stars because I found the pattern to be rather repetitive, but still I highly recommend it to anyone.
Turn off the lights, turn on your music (if you don't like the one in the DVD, which is not so great btw), and enjoy.
I had fun.  I just gave you a few tips on how to watch it.
The rest, is up to your imagination.",1046131200,25,1195,4.187772925764192
