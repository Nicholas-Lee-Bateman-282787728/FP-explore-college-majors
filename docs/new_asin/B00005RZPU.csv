8195370,4,B00005RZPU,"Volume 6 starts out with a battle between Ceres and Miori, who along with sharing her bloodline, also can transform into an exact copy of the Celestial Maiden. Miori was just supposed to capture Ceres, but for her own reasons, she wants to KILL Aya. At the same time this is happening, Toya is having to deal with his cherished goal of regaining his memories being smashed to bits again, and then he has Aki, or the body of what of used to be Aki, breathing down his neck, wanting to crush his skull for messing around with his woman Ceres!

Volume 6 of Ceres is probably the best volume since the first disk because it focuses mostly on Aya and Toya by themselves, giving their relationship a space to grow, and also allows them to grow as characters, especially in the closing episode when they remember how they first met years ago. It really makes me want to learn how the plot will end. Unfortunately, the creators spent a lot of time designing the characters, especially making the guys appeal to a shojo audience, to the detriment of the animation quality and the writing. Most of the animation here is pretty crude in terms of anime and focuses more on angsty looks with shimmering eyeballs.",1164931200,,1199,4.550925925925926
8195371,5,B00005RZPU,"I just bought a DVD player a few weeks ago, so I just got to watch 'Ceres' for the first time in Japanese w/ eng. sub. and on DVD. I always prefer subtitled to dub.
The first episode shows the truth about Tooya and Miori and how Tooya feels. The episode ends tragically though. By the end of the DVD(or for some---tape) we find out more about Tooya's past and how it is connected with Aya. Ceres warns Aya that if she doesn't find the hogaromo within 7 months, she will kill the whole Mikage family including, Aya's brother, Aki(the progenitor). The DVD ends with many questions unanswered. I am not at all disappointed with this DVD and can't wait to see the rest!",1013385600,,665,4.370967741935484
8195372,5,B00005RZPU,"Yu has done it again. From the creater of Fushigi Yuugi, here's her latest anime/manga, Ayashi no Ceres, or Ceres, Celestial Legends. (Personally, the Japanese name has a bit more zing to it, no?) This series is very fast paced with a plot that sucks you in an spits you out.
The story begins with Aya and her twin brother Aki. When it is discovered she carries within her the blood of a celestial maiden, her life goes to shambles. A mysterious man named Tooya comes to her aid while her brother is taken away by her family, whom she can no longer trust. With the help of friends, and a strong will, she attempts to discover the mystery of the Mikage family, while keeping her own fate and heart in mind.
I highly recommend this series for anyone that loves plot twists, romance, and humor. If you liked Magic Knight Rayearth, Fushigi Yuugi, or Inu Yasha, I think you'll like this series.
Ps: As an added bonus, the soundtrack to this series is awesome too!",1009843200,2,958,4.448863636363637
8195373,4,B00005RZPU,"(...) Yuu Watase, creator of the hit series, Fushigi Yuugi, returns with another shoujo series enveloped in fantasy.  The concept is entirely engulfed in legend called Tennyo (or heavenly maiden).  Although the concept is deeply rooted in Japan, it is explained in the series as you go along. But do not expect Fushigi Yuugi with this one.  FY has a larger cast and more magical.  As always, Yuu Watase, being a shoujo mangaka, concentrated on a highly rated (if not too overrated) romance, magical maidens, and relationship tragedies.",1005782400,,535,5.045454545454546
