2922771,5,B000UNYJTK,I have waited so long to be reunited with some of my favorite sketches from Sesame Street. This is a purchase you will NOT regret. I don't!!,1195776000,3,140,4.222222222222222
2922772,4,B000UNYJTK,"Volumes 1 & 2 are great, and I know he's in 2 of the schoolhouse skits on 2, but...  I want more Roosevelt Franklin.  This purple dude was a popular character in the early 70's.  So popular, he got his own album.  Quit holding back!

Also, can someone tell me where to find Sherlock Hemlock?  I've only seen him on a menu screen on vol. 2.

Other than that, this is great nostalgic fun.  How many adults do you know spend their Saturday night (toddler dozed off to sleep) watching Sesame Street?  But, these sets are special.  Ernie & Bert, Grover & Kermit - Henson & Oz were one of the best comedy teams ever!

CTW, if you're reading these - on volume 3, I would love for you to include a bonus segment about the licensing & merchandising of the show.  From the toys to, most especially, the LP's and 45's (I've collected them all!).  I mean, what child in the 1970's didn't have at least 1 or 2 Sesame Street records growing up?",1195344000,2,930,4.2457142857142856
2922773,5,B000UNYJTK,"This DVD is excellent.  It is better than the first volume, and I'm still on the first disc.  It has brought back so many wonderful memories.  I actually bought this for my 3 year old daughter (who hasn't seen it yet)....  I guess we'll be fighting over this DVD....lol.  I hope that they bring back more classic Sesame Street episodes such as this.  I also hope that in the volumes to come that they don't repeat the same thing.  If customers want to see segments over again, they have a button on the DVD remote that can repeat it.  I think it's just a waste of DVD space.  Other than that, this is worth it... and then some.  Keep 'em comin'.... and don't make us wait for a long time.",1195084800,,688,4.223076923076923
2922774,5,B000UNYJTK,"If there is a Volume 3 coming in the future, please include the episodes of The Arizona Desert scene with the female narrator saying:""This is the desert. It's very hot and dry."" And I also want the ""Hooper's Hamburgers"" episode, when Mr. Hooper and David fails to sell their hamburgers to customers. And we also want the entire ""Sesame Street Goes To Hawaii"" episodes;including ""The Big Trip"" TV gameshow scene with Guy Smiley and Olivia phoning flight reservations at the airport (""One suffelupagus???""). We also want the Puerto Rico trip episodes with Esvaldo the Grouch in it. And the New Mexico trip episodes, and the Calexico episodes when the Sesame Street gang were building a house over there and singing ""We're going home!""",1194912000,2,732,4.959349593495935
2922775,5,B000UNYJTK,"I just purchased volume 2 today and am so looking forward to wrapping it for myself, putting it under the Christmas Tree, and thanking ""Santa"" for remembering what I REALLY want for Christmas...which is a visit back in time when things seemed simple and less sensationalized.  As a mom I enjoy re-living ""Sesame Street"" alongside my children.  As a teacher I am continually inspired by my early experiences with ""Sesame Street"" when I teach with repetition and music.

My favorite memories of ""Sesame Street""...(and I have to dig deep for these):  Bert at the ""National Association of W Lovers"" convention, the song ""Low, Middle, High"" (anyone remember that one?), ""L...Lips....(kiss that sounded like ""mmmm...mah"")...blick.""  I also loved anything with the real-life children Joey (girl) and John-John.

Anyway, thanks for indulging me here.  I'm enjoying your comments and will write a real review on the day after Christmas!",1194652800,,927,5.26530612244898
2922776,5,B000UNYJTK,"Sesame Street Old School Volume 2 is a great look at the glory days of Sesame Street...BE (Before Elmo)!! This time period seems to be when the show really found it's groove, the human cast is superb and I loved seeing Roosevelt Franklin, Herry Monster and other muppet characters you NEVER see on the show these days. While I agree some of the number skits are overplayed, Sesame knew that kids learn by repetition. All in all I find this set truly enjoyable, right up there with Volume 1!! I am really looking forward to the third installment.",1194566400,4,545,4.571428571428571
2922777,4,B000UNYJTK,"I couldn't agree more with you Raul.
The first three episodes were chalk full of segments that I remember fondly(I managed to view the entire three discs all in one evening).

But it's still disappointing how they only have one episode from each season. Plus I was also getting annoyed with the repetitive showing of the Baker's # 2 segment,as well as the Jazzy Spies # 2 segment.

It was quite a treat to see the unaired pilot episode. I never even knew such an episode existed. Ernie and Bert's home looked rather strange.

Not only was""Old School""the era before Elmo and Zoe,but before Telli,Grungetta and Gina as well. Olivia is seen in the two later episodes of disc three.

I was also glad to see Buffy Saint Marie in this set. I'm a big fan of hers.",1194393600,28,756,4.456521739130435
2922778,4,B000UNYJTK,"This DVD set, released on my 40th birthday, proved the appropriate gift!

But let's get the negatives out of the way first, to explain why I gave it four stars rather than five:

1) One reviewer for Volume 1 complained that there was too little material extracted from a six-year period of broadcasts. Unfortunately, Volume 2 presents the same limits.

2) If a Volume 3 is ever released, please omit the Falling Baker skit for the Number Two. With the current two volumes, it's been repeated to death. Give us more variety -- at least treat us to that elusive Number One skit (Baker falling with a wedding cake).

3) Same packaging is used as in Volume 1, with two of the three discs annoying stacked on top of each other.

4) One Super-Grover skit appears to be needlessly edited with recent material.

5) That irritating disclaimer saying the DVDs may not be appropriate teaching material for today's kids. (Might the lobster-trap segment be too un-PC?) My 3-year-old nephew absolutely loves watching Volume 1, so I anticipate the same reception for Volume 2.

Nonetheless, this DVD set almost earned five stars from me for two main reasons:

1) The nostalgia effect was powerful enough to nearly override the negatives.

2) There's one absolutely can't-miss-feature in Disc One -- the test pilot used to pitch the show to PBS! It's one of the freakiest gems in this release, with a heavy and admirable ""Soul Train"" streak running through the episode, an atypically rude Mr. Hooper, no kids singing ""Sunny Day"" (it took a moment for me to recognize the voice), and precious animated skits that I wish had been included in Volume 1 (notably Triangle & Square). And is that the actor that I think it is, playing a FOURTH Gordon??!!

As with Volume 1, I nearly cried seeing some skits that jogged bittersweet memories out of my subconscious (horseback mailman delivering an issue of ""The Plain Truth"" in the outskirts of Kentucky), and some that I thought I'd never see again but which I'm grateful to say I own at last (cows being fed hay in winter). Some material almost unsettled me as a kid but I now find hilarious (King Minus), while some is of just downright laugh-out-loud quality (Grover's show-and-tell with Maria's head).

You'll also find the following: Telephone Rock, I'm a hard-working dog, surprisingly more of Roosevelt Franklin, Cookie Monster in flamboyant Elton-John wardrobe, the moment when Woof-Woof's name was changed to Barkley (a change I voted against as a kid, but which I now can't imagine having occurred otherwise), and one moment when Snuffy came so close to being discovered by David. I could go on! But you'll have to watch for yourselves.

I must admit my hope that, if there's a Volume 3, it's willing to go back and cover more of '69-'74.",1194393600,165,2774,4.7803347280334725
2922779,5,B000UNYJTK,"Genius Products picks up the reigns for this second volume of nostalgic Sesame Street episodes aimed at adults who remember the series from their childhood.

The set contains five complete, hour-long episodes from the 6th through 10th seasons, 57 bonus segments, an unaired test pilot, a 12-page booklet with behind-the-scenes information and photos, and a special collectible animation cell from the classic animated segment ""Pinball Number Count"" featuring vocals by The Pointer Sisters.

Episode content includes the first episode with Roscoe Orman, the actor who still plays Gordon today. Also the first appearance of Muppet characters Rodeo Rosie, Oscar's trashman Bruno, the Two-Headed Monster and Barkley the Dog. Famous songs include ""What's the Name of that Song?"" and ""A Song From Kermit"" with celebrity appearances by Judy Collins, Henry Winkler (as the Fonze), Paul Simon, Lily Tomlin, Richard Pryor, Ray Charles and others.",1188259200,99,936,5.538461538461538

Also, the first episode on the first disk,season 6 is numbered 666. That is just disturbing. disk 2 has episode 796  form season 7 and 926 form season 8.

2922787,3,B000UNYJTK,"As much as I absolutely love Sesame Street, especially the older episodes, these DVD collections are disappointing. We bought all 3 volumes. Each volume only includes one episode per season, and sadly they reuse so many sketches. It would seem that if you only get 5 episodes to cover 5 seasons, you might not see the same song 2-3 times. Some of the sketches even show up again in other volumes. While I understand that repetition is good for children and their language development, when we bought these disks, the plan was definitely to watch it multiple times, so we don't need to see Ladybug Picnic or Jimmy John saying Up and Down on every disk.

I love how the packaging focuses on pinball number count (which I loved as a child) and even if the DVD content stunk, I would have been happy with just the packaging. But the content doesn't stink. Its full of fun episodes, great clips (like cookie monster at the library or Bert's physical) and full of trendy clips you look back at and just have to laugh (disco d?!).

2922814,5,B000UNYJTK,"When I bought this I thought I was buying it for my 4 year old grandson for Christmas but, it turned out that my daughter who watched Sesame Street over 35 years ago as a small child wanted it because she had good memories of the show.  She did want this to share with her sons and it has become a hit at her house. They all love watching these older versions of Sesame Street.  They also watch the newer shows that are on now but, you just cant' beat the older ones!!!!!",1403136000,,471,4.053763440860215

2922817,2,B000UNYJTK,"Maybe I was expecting too much. As a kid growing up in Africa, I found old Sesame episodes quite engaging and learnt a few stuff. My eldest daughter just turned 4 years and in the process of explaining the difference between before and after, I remembered that some Sesame street episodes dealt with similar subjects.
After reading the reviews I was convinced this DVD is the best of the 3 in the series. It's possible Old School 2 isn't the one I should have bought.",1398124800,,467,4.5058823529411764
2922818,2,B000UNYJTK,"How would you feel if the highlights of your favorite show as a child were reduced to 1 DVD per year (as Sesame Street Old School is)? Ok, how would you feel if on this already truncated single DVD is only one full episode with about a dozen selected bits as extras? This is what you are getting with SSOS, Vol 1. Feeling pretty disappointed aren't you...?

The cheap skates at Public Broadcasting & Children's Television Workshop obviously think so little of their fans that this is their idea of a compilation DVD... On the one hand, I loved the trip down memory lane and all the great characters when they were young and exciting, unlike the more recent Sesame Street shows that are tired, rely way too much on Elmo, and don't intellectually challenge the kids). In addition, the extra bits that included are all great, great memory refreshers.

But, and this is a BIG but, how can you release a supposed collection of DVD's that gives you so little? One episode per year???? A dozen or so extra bits per year????? Three of the twelve bits are simply actors saying the alphabet. Although it's neat to see well-known actors from 30-some years ago and this bit was a hallmark of Sesame Street episodes for years, it's hardly my idea of great television to watch someone speak the alphabet dead-pan (especially considering the DVD's are marketed to those of us who watched these shows as children).

These compilations held so much promise. My only hope is that these are teaser DVD's and sometime in the future PBS/CTW will wake up and release larger collections.",1395705600,,1564,4.68

In springtime

Then comes summer
Sun is hot, grass is green, there is no school
Bathing suits, lemonade, swim to get cool
In summer

Then comes autumn
Red and gold leaves fall from trees every day
School starts and summer birds all fly away

Bright frozen icicles, heavy warm clothes

We were thrilled to find the Old School sets and now have Vol 1 and 2.  Theses shows actually teach children through repetition and interesting skits.  I am an elementary school teacher (mostly 1st Grade) and I appreciate the sound research behind the lessons.  There is a disclaimer at the beginning of the video stating that these shows are intended for adults for nostalgia's sake and that they do no meet the needs of today's preschoolers; I would argue that these shows do indeed meet the needs of today's preschool children and that the teaching methods used are based on good research and, therefore, still effective.

From a person who grew up on the 70's Sesame Street, new Sesame Street STINKS!!! My son is the youngest of all of my parents grandchildren, and has now started watching this Old School Sesame Street DVD's. He is 7 months old, and this is his new favorite way to spend his breakfast time in the morning. He sits at the table and watches the discs while he eats his fruits and cereal. He's mesmerized by the flashy numbers skits and the puppets. I did not give this set a 5 star rating, as with many of the other reviewers, I felt it was not enough of the episodes. There is only 1 episode for each of the years listed, and I really had hoped it would have been the entire collection of those years.

There is bonus material for each season which you can select ""play all"" and this adds about 20-30 mins of sesame street per season and is great if you have a toddler/preschooler watching. My 27 month old actually seems to love the slower pace and the greater variety of the old sesame street. She does not even know who Abby Cadabby is. Although she is a big Elmo fan.

The DVD was awesome, but I took off a 1/2 star, because the first disk did not default to the main menu, instead leaving me with a black screen, after showing the ads for other DVDs to buy. I kept going around in circles (pushing the play button on my remote, which started the ads all over again. This happened four times, before I was able to get the main menu on, by waiting until the ads were done (fast forwarding through them, since you can't go directly to the main menu without going through the ads), then waiting for the black screen to be on awhile, before hitting the menu key on my remote. The disk wouldn't allow me to use the menu button on my remote until the black screen was on for a few seconds. That was frustrating.

Still I loved season 2, although once again there were repeats, but not enough to upset me. Some of the new disco style stuff wasn't my fav., but still fun to watch.

2922856,5,B000UNYJTK,"Again the disclaimer is on the Old School Sesame Street sets, claiming that some bits may not be suitable for todays children. This must be a joke. Why would anyone find this material unsuitable for any children? This is the cream of the crop right here. I put this thing in for my kid, and he watches in a way he watches nothing else, not even the modern ""appropriate"" Sesame Streets that are on TV these days. If I had to choose one thing to let my kid watch, it would be these Old School Sesame Streets. Lessons go far beyond the ABC's. Sesame Street old school deals with everyday life in an honest way, it is entertaining and hillarious too. I think so.
The show these days makes an effort, but is bogged down too much with PC values, which make it not as fun as the old schools.
Some of these characterizations are very plainly real, which is what makes them work so well. You have some characters like Don Music, who throws a fit when he cant get his lyrics right, or Jack-Be-Nimble, who is portrayed as a hippie biker type who gets mad at Kermit when Kermit corrects his mistake. ""Hey! Get off my case, Frog!""  ...by todays standards thats probably not as peachy clean as it should be. But as any kid who grew up with old school version of Sesame Street will know... It's not bad to be mad.

On this set you get the season premieres from seasons 6-10, and bonuses. The thing with sesame street is that it purposely repeats bits all the time, which is the point of the show, so kids don't forget. So as in the first volume, some bits get repeated on the DVD. I would say that a third volume is necessary, staying away from full episodes and just giving us the leftover segments from the first ten years. While the full episodes are cool to have, it is obvious that any more will result in a lot more repeated bits...still, An hour of Sesame Street from the seventies is much more varied with different stuff than todays show which relys very heavily in its commercial characters like Elmo and Baby Bear. In this era there is input from a slew of very talented writers and cartoonists, and musicians and celebrities and filmakers, just tons of stuff to enjoy. I'm still a huge fan of the animal reels and how-they-make-it reels that no longer get played on the show. Remember when they showed us how to make chinese noodles? I find that my four year old gets bored easily with the new stuff on TV, like twenty minute Elmo segments, but is quite in tune with the cut and paste style, and fast moving segments of these shows. I believe it gives a child more of an incentive to see whats coming up next, when the segments are shorter. Sesame Street was right on the money in these days, and cannot be duplicated. Better disclaimers for this set may be, Warning: May encourage Free Thinking and Sense of Humor... Warning: Brilliant Television, may make your kid more fun to be around than most kids... or something to that effect. I really dig it and I'm pretty sure they've made ME more fun to be around.

On the Con side, I think they could have kind of done a 'best of' series instead of just whole episodes. Maybe that is in the works.

They all enjoyed it, including my wife who didn't grow up with Sesame Street.

Love the old charcters, Harry Monster, Grover (suppose he is still around but it seems Elmo hijacked his spot), overall just the flow of it - good stuff.

They make learning fun - well, in truth the kids don't know they are learning, but they are counting & subtracting, etc. without even realizing it. Thats how learning should be.

Personally I love the hippie style - Im laid back and loose, so I suppose this affects the kids as well.
(i.e., if your not laid back as well and take things lightly, you may need to stick to modern Elmo.)

Also, our kids don't watch much t.v. - most kids who over zone on todays t.v. probably wouldnt care and even begin to relate to the presentation of old school.

I say they need to release a pack of all the episodes...no biggy really...just not sure if they think they can get their money back on it...they are focused and pressing on with the cleaned up version of todays sesame street - no rought talk or frustrated Don Music there. lol

I loved watching this with my daughter, old school Sesame Street is so much better than the junk on these days.  Most stuff these days are nothing more than CGI with no story or educational/entertainment value (Ice Age, Cars, Skrek, the Disney channel). I really enjoy this because it is very creative.  They are on a really tight budget, but they do a good job putting together all sorts of different skits and songs with a lot of variety.

But, everything has its down fall. When you see an only for adults sticker on something that is suppose to be a learning tool and educationl for children, your heart has to drop. Mine did. I mean, I grew up with Sesame Street, watched it when I was a very young kid back in the late 60's to mid 70's, and  learned alot, and never ever thought about that there was anything wrong with it, or any subbliminal messages that they were trying to give us, nor did our parents worry about the content. But, it seems in this day and age, in this so called""POLITICALLY CORRECT"" world, something is going to offend someone, or hurt someone's feelings, or is going to offend their religion, color, race, creed, sexuality, etc....It was not like that back then, now it is. I read a review of vol 1. and it really amazed me, it really did, and it made me sad for todays kids and their parents also who buy into all this Political Correct B.S.. The reviewer pretty much was trying to say that times have changed, and this material was not suited for todays child, because of its sensitive and non political correct material (there is those two words again). One mother was quoted saying ""What did they do to us?"" Hmmmm, thats interseting. Hmmm, Mayby they were trying to teach us, in a fun, visual way, I don't know, thats just me speculating, I do that from time to time. Other quotes were that Cookie Monster was eating his way to diabetes. Now, I don't know about you, but when I was a kid, hardly any of us were overweight, because we were outside most of the time running, playing, and burning it all off, unlike alot of kids today, who sit in front of the tv, or play video games,and do not move for hours at the time, and eat junk food, and drink soft drinks, and get no exercise. Another little comment was about the neighbors walking with kids down the street, and enviting them over to the house for cookies and milk, and to meet their wife. Ok, I must admit, that was a little wierd, but you have to take all that into consideration, and the time period. Yes, you have to be leary of strangers, and you have to teach your kids that, but reading all that, I feel that people try to make something out of nothing. They try to look for things to get offended over, or things to get their feelings hurt over. Ok, then, Old School Sesame Street may not suite the needs of todays kids, but does a muppet with AIDS suite thier needs?I guess in this day and age, it does. I have to wonder about that.

You know that nostalgic feeling you when seeing an old clip of the Muppet Show, or an old Disney cartoon you haven't seem since you were 6 years old?
Or even when you see a clip of Indiana Jones or Star Wars and it's like a comfort food that brings you back to that innocent time in your life.

The skits and clips in this collection do just that.  They literally transport you back in time, at a point in your life where you live moment to moment, care free and never worrying about tomorrow.

Volume 2 contains a similar message, though I honestly can't see why. I presume it may have something to do with ""political correctness."" If, however, the producers are concerned about being PC, I would like to know why they choose the opening episode of this series to be Episode ""666""? I'm not a numerologist, but it certainly freaked me out as the show opens with the words, ""Sesame Street"" and then ""666"" appears under it with no explanation. At first I wondered if this had always been a part of the title and I hadn't noticed it as a child. Then, I searched the inserts and found that this was merely the Episode # they had chosen from Season 6. Considering that in the broader American culture, this number along with Friday the 13th is held as tabu and generally avoided, I see no reason why they couldn't have selected another episode or edited the opening scene or added some introductory words on what exactly we were seeing on the screen. If we have really progressed so much that this material is ""old school"" for ""nostalgic purposes"", then I would have thought the editors would have a bit more taste, sensitivity, and care for others. I give it three stars for that reason. I was not warned about that little suprise or I would not have purchased it on principle. I'm not about making fun of someone else's concern or weakness. To me, that's the real ""old school."" Buyers be forewarned.",1200096000,6,1546,4.645985401459854
2922879,5,B000UNYJTK,Love it!  Takes me back to my childhood.  Enough full episodes to remeber the feel of 70's Sesame Street and lots of classic cuts.,1199232000,,130,4.375
2922880,4,B000UNYJTK,"What a trip down Memory Lane to see the show the way I remembered it - I grew up on this show - watched it every single day.  My only complaint would be that there is a bit of repetition (silly complaint considering the show was about repetition).  Nonetheless, when compiling a DVD, I would have expected they'd use the opportunity to squeeze in more original content than repeat segments already included in 1 of the DVD's.  Still an excellent buy and I'll be watching it again - with my daughter even.",1198886400,3,504,4.456521739130435
2922881,5,B000UNYJTK,"I would MOST definately agree with some of the reviews I've read here.  I've just finished watching the all the episodes of Volume 2.  I must say that I, too, am disappointed that we are so limited to one episode per season.  It would've been nice if we had maybe at least five to ten  episodes from each season.  PLEASE put more than one episode per season as one is NOT enough!!!  And like Raul, I also got pretty annoyed with the Falling Baker's representing the Number 2 skit over and over again!  I would like to see Falling Baker's 3-10 skits if at ALL possible please!

With the negative stuff out of the way, it was nice taking a trip down memory lane and pretending I was back at being a pre-schooler again.  Nice seeing the Fonz (Henry Winkler) and Archie Cunningham (Ron Howard)  doing a skit on brushing teeth, Helen Reddy singing about Growing. Kermit's skit of seeing Humpty Dumpty being put back together again and seeing him accidently knocking Humpty off again is a TRUE classic, among with a brief cameo of Carol Burnett (if I'm not mistaken) and the list is ENDLESS here!!!  LOVED seeing Don Music and his head-banging against his piano for the short of Mary Had a Little Lamb.  Please put more of Don in future Old School Box Sets!!!  And how about more of Harvey Kneeslapper who laughs hysterically and always gets on Simon - The Sound Man's nerves, Grover as the Waiter, etc, etc.  Please don't wait too long before we see Volume 3.  Thanks.",1198368000,2,1463,4.488636363636363
2922882,4,B000UNYJTK,I loved the nostalgia and stuff. Does anyone know about the sketch where a father and daughter or brother were doing rolling excersises on the floor and a vaccum cleaner was in the background or something similar? And when is volume 3 debued to come out?,1198281600,,254,4.543478260869565
2922883,5,B000UNYJTK,"I have a multi-region DVD player & was unsure if I would be able to watch this in Australia.  I entered the code for my specific model player which permanently turned my player in a multi region player (from 4 to 0)and was still worried that the disc themselves may have a safeguard on them, but they play no problem at all.  Can't say if they will change the discs in the future but the ones I purchased work great, I'm very happy.  oh by the way I purchased old school 1 & 2 and they are fabulous. Now we have six new sesame street discs to play in the house, yeah!",1198195200,,567,4.044642857142857
2922884,5,B000UNYJTK,"I am really enjoying this collection.  Highly recommended for fans of Sesame Street back in the day, during it's golden years. A real highlight is seeing disco Grover, in all his flashy glory.  :)  The set is also very easy to navigate between season premieres and season highlights.  Buy it NOW!  ...and support public television, please.",1197417600,2,339,4.982142857142857
2922885,4,B000UNYJTK,"Another excellent DVD from Sesame Street. Has a few of my favourites, including more of John John, the Pinball Number Count and the Llama to the dentist song.

I'd have given it five stars were it not for quite a few repeated clips from the Volume One Disc. With almost every first episode being brought to you by the number two, you get to see the two little girls with the doll's house more than should be legal!

All in all though, a great purchase and one I'll be revisiting for reminders of my childhood.",1197331200,,509,4.347368421052631
2922886,5,B000UNYJTK,Another great dvd set from the old school sesame street episodes. Feels great that our toddler is watching these shows that contain beautiful values and are truly educational. The world was in some ways a little less harried and a little less frightening back then. There is something pure about these early shows. I feel lucky to have them. I hope they continue to put out these sets b/c we will certainly keep collecting them.,1197331200,,428,4.72
2922887,4,B000UNYJTK,"Like some of the other reviews I've read, I also was disappointed to see so many repetitions of cuts (#2 Jazzy Spies, dollhouse, etc.), but I was still happy to be thrown back into the 70's yet again.  As far as content goes, I thought I would've seen the crying flower, Bumble Ardy's birthday party, rollin' O, to name a few.  There are some others that I remember fondly - the children building a puzzle (of body parts) in their backyard, a cut about different types of flowers (done to a song by a lady), Kermit's ""what-happens-next"" machine, the guy who brings milk to a crying baby, and a clip where you hear two kids talking about looking at clouds and finding shapes in clouds, ending with ""let's go home"".  I hope the powers-that-be would look into revisiting those episodes that they've omitted and one day offer full-season DVDs.  I can't wait for that.",1196208000,2,863,4.584415584415584
2922888,5,B000UNYJTK,"I can't believe how much these songs and videos bring back the early 1970's for me - there is a segment in one episode with a dollhouse and two mean kitties who knock everything over, and suddenly I am four years old in my grandmother's living room, sitting on the floor watching this show with my cousin.  My own kids are enjoying them too - my daughter was mesmerized by the dollhouse piece, just like I was thirty years ago.  If you were born in 1972 or 1973, this is absolutely worth the money.",1196121600,2,498,4.287234042553192

8213952,2,B000UNYJTK,"I grew up watching Sesame Street in the 1980s. I was hoping this would be like the Sesame Street I remember (not completely Elmo-centric, but very kid friendly with lots of Big Bird, Cookie Monster, Oscar the Grouch, Grover, Ernie and Bert, etc..). It's not. It's like a mix between sketch comedy and some educational bits. Interesting to see how the show originated and to see life in the 1970s, but not what I was looking for and not what I remember from the 80s.

Also, each disc only has one full episode. And the disc starts with a warning that it's for adults and not appropriate for today's preschoolers. I haven't noticed anything inappropriate, per se, but as mentioned above it's just not as kid-focused as the show was when I grew up or is now.",1518393600,2,755,4.510948905109489
