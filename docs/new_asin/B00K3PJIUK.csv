8655707,5,B00K3PJIUK,I am pleased beyond recognition. No scratches on the DVDs they plain English dub and sub so it gives viewers the choice of what they would feel more comfortable using. No problems or region works with the DVD players and laptops also the PlayStation 3 works with almost any device that can play with DVD. I hope this review was helpful if any more questions please don't hesitate to ask,1452988800,4,386,4.5285714285714285

8655709,4,B00K3PJIUK,"Again. It's Slayers ... in space.  That's pretty much it.  You have the feeling that the main character is the descendant of Lina Inverse.  Space age sword of light.  Massive overkill. Grubbing for ever penny and holding on to it like money is the holy grail.  It's not the most amazing anime I've seen but it's not bad either.
  If you were a fan of Slayers you'll probably enjoy it.  Reference to grandmother, will probably have you thinking he's talking about  Lina.  Otherwise it's a technomagic space adventure.  Enjoyable but no where near as good as the original Slayers.",1402617600,6,578,4.737373737373737
