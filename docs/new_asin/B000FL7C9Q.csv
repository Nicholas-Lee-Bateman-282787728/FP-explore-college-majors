8124518,4,B000FL7C9Q,"Here is a man of history who went from a boy being teased at school, to being an officer who was surviving on very little, to becoming a hero, becoming first consul of France and then Emporer and then at the end was defeated. An amazing life of an amazing man.",1334534400,,260,4.117647058823529
8124519,2,B000FL7C9Q,"As someone who was actually expecting to receive a dvd which dealt with the Battle of Waterloo,I found the content of this disk infuriatingly shallow,unsatisfying,repetitive and full of inadequate flashbacks and psychological profiles. The description of the battle was dreadfully truncated and misleading. No mention of the rain and its effect for instance. Or the failure of Bonaparte's artillery barrage.
There is not even a picture of the actual battlefield as it is today.
Quite a lot of it survives. I know. I've been there.
Be warned,if you want to know about the battle or the men involved there are plenty of books and Sergei Bondarchuk's film of'WATERLOO'.",1223942400,5,666,5.175925925925926
8124520,5,B000FL7C9Q,"I found this a broader and more in depth story to Napoleons' rise to power after Elba. His psychological profile as a charismatic military leader who took great gambles to become a meglomanic dictator. I also enjoyed the narration and re-enactments, first class.",1200009600,3,262,5.116279069767442
8124521,2,B000FL7C9Q,"This documentary is entirely reenactments, but they are done better than what History Channel usually comes up with (sloppily).  The many historians interviewed are diverse in terms of nationality and gender.  I'm not quite sure why National Geographic is covering this, rather than something more scientific.

This work presents itself as discussing one last battle.  However, it swings back and forth from Napoleon's exile to many times in his earlier years.  It's comprehensible but people who like their history linear may be frustrated.

The work is much longer than your average high school class period, so I can't imagine this being shown to high school students.  Still, history buffs may really enjoy this.",1180656000,2,716,5.283185840707965
