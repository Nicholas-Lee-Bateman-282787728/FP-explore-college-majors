8126951,5,B000FUH3M8,"this film shows the horror that human beings can inflict on one anther and the loving, courageous and creative human spirit that can rise above it. The photography is superb.",1395878400,,174,4.833333333333333
8126952,4,B000FUH3M8,"Velcrow Ripper recognizes that the ""times they are a changin'.""  He recognizes that people are able to find a spiritual center to overcome the most horrific events.  Really enjoyed the movie.",1377302400,,191,5.129032258064516
8126953,5,B000FUH3M8,"Perfect balance of awareness vs anger! So easily, Velcrow could have gone further and stopped right at the point it needed to so the message was conveyed properly. His other documentary, Fierce Light is the same. Beyon d worth the money. Motivating at the least! Company had good price and great service!",1361404800,,304,4.865384615384615
8126954,5,B000FUH3M8,"Director Velcrow Ripper's ScaredSacred is an amazing, powerful, uplifiting film documenting stories of transformation in the face of crisis. I didn't feel I was witnessing these stories as much as accompanying him into the darkness to find the light in places such as Bhopal India, the Balkans, Israel-Palestine, the killing fields of Cambodia, NYC just after 9/11, and others.

I just saw his new film, Fierce Light: Where Spirit Meets Action ([...]) -- a transformational experience in cinema. See it!",1238112000,6,503,5.2875
8126955,4,B000FUH3M8,It is interesting for showing variety of tragic places on the Earth one would hardly visit otherwise.,1188691200,3,101,5.0
8126956,5,B000FUH3M8,"In a 5 year undertaking, documentary filmmaker Velcrow Ripper travels to several international locations that have all experienced far too much tragedy, suffering, and loss.  Although this is just a handful out of many more areas that have been victimized by horrible events, each one featured here is quite significant in its own right when considering the history involved.

Beginning in Bhopal, India and moving on through Cambodia, Bosnia, Hiroshima, Afghanistan, New York and eventually culminating in Israel and Palestine, time is spent exploring the past and present fates of these environments along with thoughts from the populace.  In conjunction with passionate interviews of those impacted by these events, video footage that accompanies these segments is both powerful and impressive.

Despite living in a world of continual instability and uncertainty, people everywhere have demonstrated time and again that hope can be a profound element in shaping a better future.  That is the attitude shared by many in this program along with the fact that a lot more compassion and much less negativity would be wonderful stepping stones towards improving the human race altogether.

I found `Scared Sacred' to be a worthwhile and thought provoking documentary on many levels.  The presentation as far as narration, camera work, and sound quality were all well executed and the DVD has several special features that measure up nicely in combination with the main feature.",1186704000,14,1475,5.386956521739131
8126957,5,B000FUH3M8,This DVD delivers what it promises.  Low key but visually stunning I found this DVD reassuring in it's simple message - even in the worst of places there is hope. And what amazing stories these stories of hope are.,1162684800,9,214,4.487179487179487
