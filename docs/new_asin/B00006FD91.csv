7967948,5,B00006FD91,"The Weiss Kreuz TV series has gone through ups and downs in story and animation quality, but these final five episodes are definitely the best in the series. The artwork and animation is clean and consistent throughout the DVD, something which previous releases suffered in. The voice acting is superb as always, as the characters hurtle toward the emotional finale. Finally, the DVD extras (outtakes and Japanese voice actor interviews) are funnier and more entertaining than any others (except the rock-paper-scissors tournament on volume 4!).
In this volume, Aya's sister has been captured by Schreient. When Yohji captures the Schreient agent Neu, who he believes is his ""dead"" partner Asuka, the Weiss team is on their way toward finding their enemies and rescuing Aya-chan. Meanwhile, the three heads of the mysterious occult organization Esstzet are on their way to Japan to complete their plans of destroying the world. Yet in the background lurks Schwarz, with plans of their own. Events pull all the players toward the grand finale, the final showdown between Schwarz and Weiss.
This DVD of episodes 21 - 25 is definitely the best of the lot. Emotions run high in the voice acting, the animation is clean and fluid, and the plot is non-stop exciting. Granted, in a few places it doesn't make a great deal of sense, but the show never gets to the point where you can't follow what's going on. Overall this is the best Weiss Kreuz DVD... until the OAVs get released!",1036022400,11,1474,4.923694779116466
