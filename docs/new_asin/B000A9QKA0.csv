Then you see Andrien's interview for like 10 seconds... later you'll see him in Special Features for 5 minutes... so don't expect to see them in the feature!!! Overall, Good DVD!!!

It's just like watching regular Documentary DVD about Gumballers... but not many interesting events.. just them driving and driving., cussing... talkie, talkie.. then someone get into an accident.. from there, its sort of good... then That's it!!! They trying to run away from cops... don't expect to see some action.. I mean I've seen many documentaries about Illegal Street Racers.. way better...

Watch Jackass' Gumball 3000 or 3000 Miles with Bam... Funny!",1199232000,4,798,4.992481203007519

2382685,4,B000A9QKA0,"The reviewer below must not of watched this movie because this is actually not a remake.  Its a documentary of sorts on the Gumball 3000 race that happens every year in europe, when hundreds upon hundreds of cars line up at the starting line in London and race across europe using the public roads. No roads are closed of for the race, making it one long test of endurance, its lasts 6 days. The race is very popular among the rich and famous, such as adrian brody, who raced with his on motorcycle, which was a great test of wits. For most of the movie it follows a famous skateboarded in his BMW suv. I liked it, but then again who am I.",1145836800,10,639,4.195121951219512

8076599,4,B000A9QKA0,"6th Annual Gumball 3000, 2004. We see people checking in, Tony Hawk, Adrian Brody this is about the only time we see them.  Max Cooper is responsible for this whole thing.  It starts in Paris at the Eiffel Tower, Smart Car, Hummer, Viper, NYPD Police Car, Alex Roy in a fake German police car.

There is some night driving and they go to Madrid, Spain, Marbella, then Morocco.  The king there suspends speed limits while they are there, he has them escorted through towns.  A guy does have a bad car wreck. They go to Casablanca.  people passing on the right side of the road, a mooning.

To Barcelona, the police lead the group and take their passports, some drivers remove their stickers or cover them.

At end people say it was a great experience.",1334188800,2,750,4.503703703703704
8076600,3,B000A9QKA0,"Having seen all the marginal to very bad US films about this race (Gumball, Gumball Rally, Cannonball, and Cannonball Run I & II) it's great to see the actual race documented. By the way the only decent ""Hollywoodization"" of this race is the original Gumball. I still prefer 3000 Miles to this film but it's a nice companion piece. By the way the actual Gumball 3000 race in August 2008 will start in San Francisco and got to LA, San Diego, Vegas, and eventually North Korea and China for the Olympics.",1206403200,,502,4.527472527472527
