The script was too narrowily focused, a more experienced commentator would have helped and the twenty minute duration of the dvd was far too short. It was not 'value for money' by any means and I would not recomend this dvd.  Dennis Hulse",1163203200,2,306,4.666666666666667
8064812,5,B0009POP66,"This DVD presents an interesting and engaging way of seeing the world.  Gary Schofield, the author, presents his view on art and culture.  It is a thoughtful rendition of the intersection of art and culture, with a particular emphasis on the world of the Maori. Anyone interested in art, culture and the indigenous culture would find something of value in this DVD.",1133481600,3,365,4.870967741935484
