8214805,2,B000UUA10O,"The commentary is delivered at a fast speed, and consists mainly of minutely detailed descriptions of battle formations and who was leading them. This battle needs TIME to understand it. This DVD gives too much detailed information in too little time in a soporific monotone. There are quite a few modern shots of the battlefield and its monuments, but no clear indication of their location.  Even the bonus clips are not really up to much. With these, not enough detail (visual or spoken) is given to do the subjects justice.",1454803200,,526,4.844444444444444

8214807,4,B000UUA10O,I enjoyed this movie however it was not one of the better ones that I have seen! I would still recommend it to anyone interested in the Civil War! It was a Quality movie however I would have liked to have learned more about this famous battle!,1364688000,,243,4.191489361702128
8214808,1,B000UUA10O,"I rate this DVD about a C-.  It was very good on the facts, but the animations were lacking any sophistication or imagination.  Moving and blinking arrows do the job, but could have been enhanced more to accentuate the narrative.  I would not advise purchasing this DVD.",1260057600,,270,4.702127659574468
8214809,5,B000UUA10O,I live near the Chickamauga Battlefield Park and view this as the best description of the battle I have found to use as a guide prior to a tour of the actual battlefield.,1201305600,6,170,4.181818181818182
8214810,5,B000UUA10O,"Personally, I don't think this could be improved upon.  Lot's of graphics, a reasonable amount of detail, all of which is easy to follow.  -- Louis J Sheehan",1196467200,6,157,4.571428571428571
