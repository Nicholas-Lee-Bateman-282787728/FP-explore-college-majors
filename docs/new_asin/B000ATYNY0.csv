2394558,5,B000ATYNY0,"This DVD is wonderful (probably deserves ""******""). The quality of picture and sound is GREAT. It is a must buy for people who miss the winter scene. If you like winter, you will love this DVD.",1126915200,11,193,4.388888888888889
2394559,5,B000ATYNY0,"Wow! The scenery on this video is stunning. Having moved from the Midwest to a place with no snow this is the closest thing to a white Christmas I have been able to find. No stills, real video with plenty of falling snow! The music is classy, relaxing & includes all my favorites. Will definitely have this on throughout the holidays. Looks great on my new HDTV. Don't hesitate on this one.",1126828800,6,390,4.430555555555555

8079820,1,B000ATYNY0,"I now longer can go for walks in the woods or around town.

Where is the village square with the New England white chruch?
Was there a sunrise or sunset over the mountains or lake?
I stopped watching after 30 minutes.
maybe it is at the end?

The Christmas Carols are fine.

8079822,5,B000ATYNY0,"Snow for the Holidays made our holiday very special.  We lit the fireplace, a few candles, and loaded the DVD and listened and watched the wonderful video on our 50"" plasma.  The sound quality is amazing and the songs are beautiful.  We also had some friends over and looped the video while we enjoyed their company.  This video is a great addition to any home.",1200787200,,361,4.507692307692308
8079823,5,B000ATYNY0,This was a very relaxing DVD with really gorgeous footage of snowy mountains and forest.  The music was lovely.  I think it will become a tradition to have this playing in the background as we open presents on Christmas.  It made me want to find my own cabin in the snow for the holidays,1168300800,5,287,4.277777777777778
8079824,4,B000ATYNY0,I'm really enjoying this DVD.  It's full of beautifull and peacefull images of the snow with captivating mountain vistas and snow covered lakes and cabins.  I love the accompanying soundtrack and find it very enjoyable and soothing to watch.  Each time I see it I notice something different.  It's the perfect backdrop to a holiday gathering.,1165363200,5,342,5.053571428571429
8079825,2,B000ATYNY0,"After reading the reviews and watching the clips for this dvd I anxiously ordered it.  Boy were we disappointed.  We love nature/relaxation type dvds and have several of them, so can compare new ones with those we own and like.  I expected falling snow, there was very little of it.  It seemed many of the scenes were clips or freeze framed. Very rarely does a tree move or snow blow , even a tiny bit.  Being from the praries and mountains of the midwest I can say nature is hardly ever completely still.

So that aspect made the pictures seem less real.  There are a couple of beautiful shots of mountains with clouds moving across them and a gorgeous shot of snow falling on a lovely cabin. Other than that there was not much to keep our interest.

I would definitely skip this one. A couple of favorite Christmas/winter DVD's  we enjoy are: Christmas in New York  and  The Spirit of Christmas",1164585600,27,896,4.469135802469136
8079826,5,B000ATYNY0,"We had seen this video at a family gathering and had to buy one for ourselves. It made us realize that, because we live in ""snow country,"" we often take it for granted. This is a perfectly wonderful depiction of the beauty that we miss amidst our busy lives. The calming music and images bring us back to the peace we were meant to experience, especially this time of year. I highly recommend this to anyone who needs a refreshing break from life's busyness.",1133049600,12,458,4.464285714285714
8079827,5,B000ATYNY0,I was so intrigued when I saw the ad for this DVD that I had to order it immediately. I am originally from Minnesota and currently live in Phoenix. The only way I know that it is Christmas time here is because my neighbors have lit up the cactus in their front yard. I was pleasantly surprised when I received my box of winter wonderland and even more so when I actually watched it. It is beautiful! I absolutly recommend this video to anyone that misses winter and that holiday feeling. I have watched it over and over and ordered more for my friends and family. Finally there will be a little snow in Phoenix this Christmas!,1131494400,20,626,4.358974358974359
