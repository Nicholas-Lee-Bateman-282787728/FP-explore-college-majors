8256278,5,B0014T7EQY,"Others have given an accurate synopsis of the movie, so I'll just add that I found the movie excellent, but terribly sad. If you're looking for a 'fun' film this is not it. Terrific in nearly every respect, but at the end the feeling generated in me was that of a heavy, sad sigh. Having said that, if you're a fan of films that portray the reality of life, you'll want to see it.",1365206400,,380,4.148648648648648
8256279,4,B0014T7EQY,"Pat Short stars as Josie, a somewhat dimwitted garage attendant, who struggles to exist in a lonely life in a small Tipperary town, in rural Ireland. While most folk are ok to him, some are openly hostile and ridicule him with vicious tongues. Josie takes this in his stride for the most part, content with his day to day chores at the garage and his time down the pub.

Things change for Josie, though, when he's asked to look after David, an ""assistant"" to him at the petrol station. Over time, Josie and David form a bond, mainly through alcohol. Things take a turn for the worse, though and soon Josie's world is turned on its head.

While not as good as the Director/scriptwriter's previous effort, 'Adam and Paul', 'Garage' is still one of the better Irish films produced in a long time. It's a quiet, slow moving film for the most part, but it is always interesting, with a great central performance by Pat Short. But, like 'Adam and Paul', the subject matter is terribly sad and displays are real glum outlook. Director, Lenny Abrahamson and scriptwriter Mark O'Halloran, certainly wouldn't win any Bord F&aacute;ilte (Irish Tourist Board) brownie points, but 'Garage' (like 'Adam and Paul') is well worth watching.",1303430400,2,1223,4.791469194312796
8256280,4,B0014T7EQY,"A beautifully shot, well acted film.  Slightly familiar and a bit sappy at moments, its the story of a borderline retarded
middle aged man who runs a gas station in a small town in Ireland, and his complex relationship with the teenager who
comes to work with him.  (mild general spoiler ahead) Well made and well intended, with a dark ending, it never quite
transcends from good to great. But in tandem with his 'Adam & Paul' this shows Leonard Abrahamson to be a film-
maker with a strong, notable voice.",1272153600,,506,4.549450549450549
8256281,5,B0014T7EQY,"--you like them, if they are sweet, and as cool and cheerful as they can be, considering,and you don't mind having them by you, and with you...

But you don't want them IN you, do you?

But they want to be by you, and with you, and in you. They are human beings, too.

Pat Shortt is perfect as the slightly retarded man, and Abrahamson has put together a beautiful little film; the occasional music and lovely Irish countryside is wonderful too.

In addition to a region 1 (American and Canadian) film, those of us who don't know the Irish dialect need subtitles. I saw this film on TCM or Sundance with subtitles, but when I bought it, it came straight from Ireland, and I only understand about 3/5ths of it. I'm hoping that repeated viewings will help.",1263340800,2,758,4.41726618705036
8256282,5,B0014T7EQY,"This is a great film about the slowly destructive way loneliness breaks down sweet natured people who just don't fit into ""normal society"".",1260576000,3,139,5.086956521739131
