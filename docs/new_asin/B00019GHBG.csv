8359947,4,B00019GHBG,"Amazing Video Collection: Incredible Rescues features footage captured by camera crews tagging along with paramedics, firefighters, and other 911 response units. This video is part of the Amazing Video Collection series from the veteran producers of Cops, the godfather of ""Reality Television"" shows. Drama has always sought to create emotions vicariously in the audience by staging situations. Reality TV has captured the imagination of the viewing public precisely because the stakes are real and not imagination; producers love the genre because it's genuinely dramatic and inexpensive to shoot -- it's literally ""cheap thrills."" Boasting ""no reenactments, no actors, just real-life heroes,"" this program's highlights include rescues of real people trapped by fire, stranded by floods, clinging to the edge of a cliff, and buried alive.",1223856000,,839,5.72
