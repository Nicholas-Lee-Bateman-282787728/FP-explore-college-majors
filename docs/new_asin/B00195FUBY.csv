8272112,5,B00195FUBY,Watched this with my preteen son and we both really enjoyed it.  He thought it was hysterically funny.  Lots of gags and slapstick action but there's a real story and solid acting. The DVD extras say this film was a labor of love and it shows.  For under $10 you can't beat the entertainment value.,1334880000,,298,4.381818181818182
8272113,4,B00195FUBY,This is one of the funniest movies no one ever watched. Most of us can remember inventing a stupid game or sport that just begged to have an ambulance standing by. This movie is all about that stupid sport.,1265760000,,206,4.3076923076923075
8272114,4,B00195FUBY,I think you will find this film a real hoot for parents and kids alike.  Fun performances and a funny script based on the real life nonsense our Director's kids got into.  When you see it...and if you are a parent you will shake your head and know this film is true!  Kids are insane!  Enjoy!!,1225065600,2,293,4.178571428571429
8272115,5,B00195FUBY,"I loved this movie.  I can't believe it wasn't in the theatres.  Young audiences would love it.  The young cast was great, the story was a lot of fun!  I laughed throughout this zany film which is more than I can say for some of the so-called comedies I saw in theatres this summer!  See it!",1217808000,2,291,4.125
8272116,5,B00195FUBY,"This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.  It's about two underdog high school dudes in Laguna Beach who invent a new extreme sport called boxboarding.  Great young cast, along with veterans like Melora Hardin from The Office and Stephen Tobolowsky from Wild Hogs, Groundhog Day, etc.  The stunts are ridiculous and the story is very clever.  I heard that it won an award at the Newport Beach Film Festival last year.  See this movie!!!",1217289600,2,455,4.6375
