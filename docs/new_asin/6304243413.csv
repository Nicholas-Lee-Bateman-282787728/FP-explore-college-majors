8195777,4,6304243413,"It's interesting. Besides the animal slaughters and morgue shots, most of the segments are staged. One woman jumping off her building, that was real too. Other than that, I didn't notice anything that was particularly grousome. Don't freak out people, no one died. It's just for fun and shock value. Some of them are very obviously fake. The monkey, for example, and the man landing in a alligator pit. Another is a man being 'attacked and killed' by junk yard dogs. Notice how they're only biting his arm, just like they're trained to do. The harp seals getting beaten is worse than anything in the film. Have fun, if you're into that sort of thing.",1099353600,,650,4.660869565217391
