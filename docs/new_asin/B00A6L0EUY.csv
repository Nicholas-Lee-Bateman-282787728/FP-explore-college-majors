8547004,5,B00A6L0EUY,"I have struggled with plantar faciitis and heel pain for about 10 years, and I have been doing this routine for about 3 weeks and I am starting to feel some releif.",1401926400,,164,4.15625
8547005,2,B00A6L0EUY,"It is a quirky dvd filming. The woman and a friend go to an old abandoned building and film her doing the exercises. So that is strange. But the main thing was the exercises, they are ok but nothing that I don't do in yoga class for stretching and strengthening my toes. Fingers between toes, rolling ankle, mountain pose, etc. It was ok to do once or twice but not something I'm going to do again. Disappointed in it.",1400889600,4,418,4.30379746835443
8547006,1,B00A6L0EUY,it was a waste of time and money. It was so short and ridiculous and it did nothing for my feet.,1398211200,,96,3.619047619047619
8547007,4,B00A6L0EUY,"This dvd shows some very good, very simple stretches and excersises for your feet, that are helpful and effective. It is a little slow paced and I think it could have gone a bit more in depth. But, over all, I like the dvd and am glad to have it as part of my yoga/health/fitness collection.",1366848000,,291,4.214285714285714
8547008,4,B00A6L0EUY,I have rheumatoid arthritis in my feet so I was only able to utilize some of the yoga motions. They were helpful but would love to see more moves that were sitting due to balance and pain issues. I do recommend the DVD.,1363478400,3,219,4.116279069767442
8547009,5,B00A6L0EUY,"I have been doing this DVD for about 60 days or so - I notice better balance and far fewer foot cramps.  I have had plantar fasciitis off and on for years - walking (which I try to do regulary) often aggravates the problem.  I do believe my feet are not only getting stronger but my arches appear to be improving.

Info the exercises both with and without the DVD but I feel when I use the DVD I relax more and notice better benefit.

The only downside - I can't stream on my iPad or iPhone. I rarely use my computer or DVD player - if I could stream this it would be even more helpful.",1356134400,6,586,3.982905982905983
8547010,5,B00A6L0EUY,"Until recently, my feet have always been in pain and tired at the end of the day. I started wearing Correct Toes which have been really helping with my bunions and acute pain. But my feet were still very tired and achy at the end of the day.

Thats why I bought this DVD, it promised to help me strengthen and soothe my achy feet. I was a bit skeptical, because I don't have much time to add workouts to my day, but I REALLY wanted my feet to feel better. I cant believe how well its worked! Im so impressed. I admit, Im not doing ALL of the exercises, or even more than 5 or 10 minutes a day. But after dinner, I pop in the DVD, and follow a bit of the exercises, in particular the foot massage. The exercises work wonders. The exercises dissolves the achiness out of my feet, and my feet have been getting stronger too. Typically, by the time the day is done, my feet, legs, and back want to collapse. But now, Im finding myself moving around quickly at the end of the day, without even realizing they're no longer tired!

If you have the time to spend 5 or 10 minutes a day on your feet, I think this DVD, or the exercises in it, will work wonders. Its also very meditative and soothing. Half the reason I think I put it in is the music. I relax, as Im relaxing my feet.",1355443200,4,1273,4.067729083665339
