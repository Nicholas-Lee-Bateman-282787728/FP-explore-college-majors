8177585,1,B000NGROX2,the dvd said it had 9 episodes...it only had 3 episodes and it took a long time to get here,1437004800,,91,3.6
8177586,2,B000NGROX2,What kind of bogus trash is this?It doesn't even play the Andy Griffith theme some before each episode! Won't buy anything else under this name!,1426032000,,144,4.8
8177587,1,B000NGROX2,"This DVD is definitely NOT the best of Barney. Not funny and some episodes contain a very small part with Barney.  The ""Darling"" episode doesn't even have Barney in it!",1344902400,3,168,4.6
8177588,4,B000NGROX2,The sound and picture quality are good.  But on this particular DVD version they replaced the classic whistling theme in the beginning with some piano tune that sounds like it comes from an 80s dramedie.  Why they felt the need to replace the original tune is beyond me but it just isn't the same without it.,1183766400,,308,4.482142857142857
