6938156,5,B00S0AZKU2,Excellent educational tool for understanding the complexities of our climate. I recommend it for all ages.,1424217600,5,106,5.6875
6938157,5,B00S0AZKU2,"A great expos of Al Gore's dangerously inaccurate film, The Inconvenient Truth.  Thank God there are some folks that still have a functioning brain and aren't willing to march lockstep into global control.",1444089600,3,205,5.212121212121212
6938158,5,B00S0AZKU2,"The Western world is awash with the science fascism of global warming, now called ""climate change"".  A companion to this book is ""The Deliberate Corruption of Climate Science"" where author Tim Ball, PhD, provides incontrovertible evidence that the IPCC has wildly abandoned the scientific method in their recommendations to allow policymakers to run rampant over personal liberties in favor of One World Government of elitist profit.",1433980800,5,433,5.5606060606060606
6938159,5,B00S0AZKU2,"How refreshing to see a documentary video that gets into the differences of evidence regarding anthropogenic global warming, polar bear population, supposed rising sea levels, and all the rest of the claims made around ""climate change.""  This video is a must see for Americans, especially those attending universities and suffering from political propaganda promoting the nonsense that global warming is caused by mankind and therefore energy use is bad.",1430697600,4,454,5.579710144927536
6938160,5,B00S0AZKU2,"Excellent commentary on the ""Real Climate"" change discussion, or lack of discussion.  A must see for all.",1430352000,,105,5.176470588235294
6938161,3,B00S0AZKU2,Good but  a bit disjointed.  Gets across the basics,1430352000,,51,4.555555555555555
6938162,4,B00S0AZKU2,An excellent review of this controversial and very misunderstood science. Most of the popular myths deconstructed in an essay-to-understand format.,1430352000,2,147,6.4
6938163,5,B00S0AZKU2,Great DVD,1430265600,,9,4.0
6938164,5,B00S0AZKU2,Finally people who made sense.,1429747200,2,30,5.2
6938165,5,B00S0AZKU2,"Since everything you see on the news and hear in schools is one sided, this is a great movie to demonstrate why critical debate of global warming claims are indeed warranted.  I watched this online from a Twitter link, but am purchasing for my 7th and 8th grade kids (who just watched Al Gore's film in science class).  The Hight Court in Britain ruled that schools in England could not show An Inconvenient Truth without first informing the class that it is a politically biased movie, it is one side of the argument, and there are 9 factual errors presented in the film.  This is out of liberal England!  American schools aren't mandated to have such conversation and are often misleading our kids with untruths. The Global Warming War offers good information to counter all the misinformation they are forced to listen to.",1424649600,14,825,4.748251748251748
6938166,5,B00S0AZKU2,"Finally another view on the hysterical politician driven ""global warming hoax"". Ok, I'm first hand experienced climate changes at mt. Kenya, glaciers and fjords in Svalbard, so no doubt it is actually happening... But, man made, hardly believe that...",1424476800,10,251,5.461538461538462
8696744,5,B00S0AZKU2,everyone should see how we've been scammed.  hear what the professional climatologist say,1522800000,,89,5.846153846153846
8696745,5,B00S0AZKU2,"fact based - with science to support the facts
CO2 is not a pollutant (plants need it fro photosynthesis) 0.03% CO2 is low",1501027200,,122,4.3478260869565215
8696746,5,B00S0AZKU2,"Well written,solidly factual.",1494633600,,29,9.0
8696747,4,B00S0AZKU2,"Pretty good and informational but a few so called facts were either misconstrued or lies outright. One guy says one thing,  then the next expert contradicts him.  But I wouldn't call it balance.  Other than that enough segments were there to prove their point.",1472428800,,260,4.863636363636363
8696748,5,B00S0AZKU2,Deceptive Government!!!,1471046400,,23,11.0
8696749,4,B00S0AZKU2,"This has been an eye opener and gives good data that has helped me to evaluate this issue.  Along with other data and research, it has allowed me to get a broader understanding of the issues our planet faces.",1470096000,2,208,4.333333333333333
8696750,5,B00S0AZKU2,"If one does not have the time to get thoroughly informed on this debate, this is a pretty good digest and includes recent findings by great researchers like Svensmark. A welcome change from all those articles and presentations about the supposedly 100% scientific consensus on Global Warming  written by politicians, columnists, economists, social scientists, even religious authorities... but not scientists.",1457827200,3,409,5.816666666666666
8696751,5,B00S0AZKU2,The truth is out there.  You just need to look.  Make them prove it no matter what they say or what the models show.  If they can't prove it with the facts or the data then it's bogus.,1446681600,,184,3.789473684210526
8696752,5,B00S0AZKU2,"A compelling presentation that everyone should view before becoming slaves to the so-called general consensus. One Black commenter near the end of the presentation made a very compelling argument concerning various established organizations that long ago came together with good intentions to resolve a specific problematic social condition. Years after their initial goals have been satisfied, they find that they have become proficient at fund raising but lack a righteous cause to defend. As is usually the case, they will attach themselves to any currently prevailing cause just to exist !",1444694400,4,593,5.527472527472527
8696753,5,B00S0AZKU2,"It is a great eye-opener to the truth and needs to be see by the major media and those in the governments making decisions on carbon tax etc.

Respectfully,
