8005906,4,B00013D40O,"""Tokyo Eyes"" is a quirky love story.  Hinano Yoshikawa plays 17-year-old Hinano who lives with her police detective brother Roy played by Tetta Sugimoto.  While the papers are full of the exploits of a criminal called ""Four Eyes"" because he wears thick glasses, Hinano becomes aware of this guy filming people on a subway and follows him.  He turns out to also be Four Eyes.  While Four Eyes is given the reputation of being a serial killer, he really is more of a serial scarer since he doesn't actually shoot anyone.  Hinano and ""K"" as the guy calls himself play a cat and mouse game of attraction, with K being well aware that the precocious Hinano is still underage.  Kaori Mizushima plays Hinano's friend Naomi who pals along on the trail of K.  This Japanese-French production is a sweet film with a loopy love story with a twist.  Enjoy!",1205193600,2,844,4.617449664429531
8005907,4,B00013D40O,"This movie does not only give you an outline of what it must be to live in Tokio in the 90ties(as well as in any other big city), but transmits the atmosphere 100%! The actors do not talk much and still everything is said. The music is absolutely well chosen. I went out of the cinema with a feeling I never had before after watching a movie. It's like being understood for the first time. You must see this film! And if you like Takeshi, watch Takeshi's castle.",993340800,7,462,4.261363636363637
