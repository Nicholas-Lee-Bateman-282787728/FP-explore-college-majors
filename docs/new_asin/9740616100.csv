8361376,5,9740616100,"This drama has an exceptionally sweet story and lovable characters that match each other perfectly, which is the reason why it has become one of my favorite dramas. If you choose to watch it, be aware that it will be a tough one to get all the way through without crying your eyes out, but it is worth it in the end because the storyline is brilliant. Good acting and a very catchy soundtrack makes the drama a happy experience all in all. The English subtitles could have been translated better, but it is possible to make sense of it, in spite of the small grammatical errors.",1391385600,2,578,4.411214953271028
