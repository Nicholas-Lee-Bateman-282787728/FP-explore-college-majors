First album to hit my ears was ""Looking Thru"". I was hooked immediately on just the first track. This group and all its incarnations has never failed to meet my musical tastes. My greatest regret along with my greatest desire was and is to see them perform live. Odds are its not going to happen. The DVD would be a definite purchase...if only I could !!!",1452038400,,532,4.2772277227722775
8715155,5,B00187FPCC,"My journey with the music of Passport began roughly thirty-five years ago with Iguacu, a Brazilian-themed jazz fusion album. So after some years of being away from hearing anything new by them, it is only fitting that I return to their music as they go Back To Brazil.
You may already own the CD of the same name, but even if you do you are missing out if you don't also own this twin DVD set. As far as I know, Back to Brazil is the fan's first chance to see Passport perform on DVD. With over three hours of entertainment, this is quite spectacular. I've never had the chance to hear Klaus Doldinger live since he and Passport never play in my area, so this is certainly an adequate substitute.
The first DVD contains over two hours of crowd-pleasing music recorded live at Tom Brazil in Sao Paulo. My favorite cuts are Blue Kind of Mind, Cat From Katmandu, Bahia do Sol, Ataraxia, and Das Boot. The second nearly hour-long DVD documents the return of Passport to Brazil starting with an impromptu jam in Rio, followed by a tour which took Doldinger and the band to various sites important in the development of Brazilian music. After passing through Bahia where the group listens to a performance by the percussion group Olodum, it goes on to Salvador, then visits the site of the concert in Sao Paulo before the film finishes back in Rio where a jam puts the icing on the tour. Most enjoyable was a rendition of Das Boot taken from the Sao Paulo show. Least enjoyable was the performance by Olodum which conjured visions of a cannibal ceremony before tossing the missionary into the stew pot.
Back to Brazil comes very tastefully packaged and is accompanied by an informative booklet in German and English containing pictures and as much information about the tour as you could hope for. I note that this has been sadly discontinued by the manufacturer. If you would like a taste of Doldinger and his band in live performance get a copy for yourself while its still available.",1272585600,4,1980,4.580281690140845
