Very tough to sit through. Good for 1 punch on the Hacker's card.

In many ways, This film is an homage to horror film which came before. Most may not get that since many horror prides want a WALKING DEAD type of horror. This is a horror similar to Vincent Price's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diary-Of-A-Madman/dp/B004LB5FAY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diary Of A Madman</a>.

Director and writer Francis Xavier has crafted a modern day tribute to old time horror. Whereas the film goer is left pondering the lead character's fate. He seems to have three different story-lines intersecting in this film. The Mad Doctor Casey, Jonathon Poe and a third storytelling piece  that would spoil the fun if I revealed it here. Those fans of Twilight Zone or Outer Limits know the ideal of a twist in the tail, That is all I will say. It has a great ending twist that you won't forget too soon.

One of the acting highlights is David Fine who portrays Doctor Casey (Chef). He steals the film in almost every scene he is in. He has such a Lon Chaney like performance, its over the top with enough breaks to make the audience want more. However to counter balance Mr Fine great acting is the weak performance of Stelio Savante whose brooding Poe drags this film down.

This film is many ways is very thought-provoking like a game of chess. However like a game of chess , this film seem disjointed and full of unneeded moves. Watch this and then watch an Inner Sanctum movie and you will see where this homage is a tribute to its source
