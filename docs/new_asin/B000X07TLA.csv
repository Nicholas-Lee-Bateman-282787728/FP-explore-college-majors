2993414,4,B000X07TLA,The series is complete and all inclusive.  This is good and this is bad. Many episodes begin with the same 3-5 minuete introduction and this can become boring to the max.  I wish that this redundancy could be edited out without destroying the originality of the collection.,1218672000,8,273,4.787234042553192
2993415,5,B000X07TLA,Growing up in the 70's I watched the Kung Fu series every week.  It was the high light of my week. I ordered the series and could not believe the series was better than I remembered it from childhood.,1212192000,97,200,4.128205128205129
2993416,2,B000X07TLA,"The quality of the DVD's is mediocre, specially Season One. Perhaps the series were too old to put into DVD's, it is so frustrating to have interruptions while watching a show (those that can be watch. I will pursue some reimbursement or exchange for the money. It is great to watch
those shows that made it okay into DVD's.",1207612800,19,324,4.508474576271187
2993417,5,B000X07TLA,"Kung Fu drastically challenged the conservative, militaristic, and philosophically naive outlook I held as a 20 year old college student and ""gung-ho"" ROTC cadet in 1972.  Now, 36 years later, I have had the opportunity to watch Kung Fu once more, and the impact has been nearly as powerful.  I have been disabled for severe depression and anxiety for over 15 years, including close to two years of hospitalization.  In all of that time I have barely moved forward--until re-watching Kung Fu.  The show has visually reminded me of many things, repeatedly told me by therapists, in such a way that I am once again able to reflect--especially while watching the show--a little more positively on my life.

That is the beauty and mastery of Kung Fu, one of the most intriguing shows ever made: it invokes one to THINK, discuss, and contemplate.  The only other show I have seen have such an effect on so many people (nearly 90% of my ROTC class of 207 cadets watched Kung Fu as well as me), is the original two years of Star Trek.  BUT, the level and intensity invoked by Kung Fu was immeasurably greater than that of Star Trek.  The commentaries and features (see the Comments for listing of these items) often mention how teachers ""required"" students to watch Kung Fu, and then discussed the episodes in class.  In deed, it is the philosophical nature of the show that most appeals to me and many who watch it.

Conversely, I will not deny that the show led me to sign up for Judo classes too (over 50% of my friends signed up for some form of martial arts), but the Karate nature of the show was never that appealing to me.  Kung Fu is frequently accredited for ""introducing"" thousands of people to the martial arts.  Unfortunately, many who watch the show or have watched the show have followed the path of what I consider ""aggressive"" martial arts, forgetting the retrospective nature of true Kung Fu.  But, I must believe that if parents watch the show with their children, they can have an opportunity to talk with their children about both aspects of Kung Fu.

Another fabulous feature of the show is that viewers are presented with the reality of bigotry and hate--something that never ends, and is completely pertinent to today's world.  (Please see the Comments for an example of how the mere fact that I lamented--now also in the Comments--that the DVDs are in English only prompted someone ""disrespectful to Americans living in AMERICA."")  Again, parents could easily use episodes to discuss and help their children--be they victims, violators, or naive--deal with bigotry and hate.

PLEASE NOTE:  Warner Brothers has apparently advertised, and thus Amazon has listed, this set to contain wide-screen formate; see the Comments for more discussion on this.  While the Season One episodes have been digitally reformatted ""IN A ""MATTED"" WIDESCREEN FORMAT PRESERVING A THEATRICAL EXHIBITION ASPECT RATIO. ENHANCED FOR WIDESCREEN TVs,"" all episodes and features in the Season 2 and 3 sets are in fact full screen.  The release date (on Amazon and the back of the red slip case for the series) states 2007, but season boxes all state they were done in 2005; so I don't think there is any difference between the Complete Series Box Set and the single season box sets.  On an even sadder note, while Warner Brothers did attempt to improve the quality of the shows and alter the formate, they did so, with varying success, for the first season only.  (Again, please see the Comments for more discussion on this matter).  For the second and third seasons, Warner Brothers either did nothing or very little to restore the negatives, so the episodes are littered with white specs, scratches, and so on (although I found them no less bothersome than those found when watching a well used copy of a movie showing at a theater; for more discussion on this, see the Comments).  That said, one must remain mindful of the fact that ""Kung Fu"" was filmed for television not the theater, was on a limited budget, and the fact that the negatives, when placed in the vault for storage, were most likely not very high quality to begin with; after all, nobody anticipated cable television syndication, let alone VHS and DVD production when the negatives were stored.  On the other hand, this inconsistency in DVD quality (be it television shows or movies) is what I have now come to expect from Warner Brothers: misinformation and little or no care for their consumers; out of seventeen letters I have sent to them with questions, they have never replied to a single one.

All that said and done: Please consider renting (if available) or buying the Kung Fu series, and watch it with family and friends if you have them.  ""Kung Fu - The Complete Series"" includes the award winning Pilot movie and all 62 episodes on 11 discs, starring David Carradine as Kiwai Chang Caine, Philip Ahn as Master Kan, and Keye Luke as Master PO.  Special guest stars (some of which I have noted in the Comments) include David's father John Carradine, Benson Fong, Harrison Ford, Jodie Foster, Don Johnson, Leslie Nielsen, William Shatner, and others.  ""Kung Fu"" is a show that is thought provoking, educational, inspirational, and unforgettable.  ""Kung Fu"" is a show that can be watched over and over--by yourself, with friends, or with your family.  There is no other TV show that I would recommend for people of all ages than ""Kung Fu""--so, treat yourself with the whole series.

UPDATE--FEBRUARY 22, 2009: It came to my attention while reading ""A Kid's Review--Kung Fu is the best, and this is the best way to own them,"" that I failed to mention the great extra features included in each of the three season sets.  In particular, in the Season Three Set, there is a fascinating documentary that follows David Carradine and some of his friends on a trip to China, where David is given a Shaolin robe on their visit to the famed Shaolin Temple Monastery, a key location depicted in the series, and David plays his flute on the Great Wall of China while it is snowing.  For&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill-Volume-One/dp/B00005JMEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill - Volume One</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill-Volume-Two/dp/B00005JMUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill - Volume Two</a>&nbsp;fans, there is a bonus feature on the Season Two set that features David Carradine having dinner with stars/friends from these two films and the ""Kung Fu"" series.  (See the Comments for more details on other bonus features and special guest stars, including Harrison Ford!).

Also, I feel like this review has become too long in my efforts to answer questions.  Therefore, I am going to cut my other updates and place them in a comment.  For first time readers, these comments deal with the following: film format and transfer quality for each season; languages and subtitles for the episodes and extra features; the fact that the discs are double sided; more on how the series is packaged; and, bonus features (rather than listing them here).  I sincerely apologize if this is an inconvenience for some, but if you look at the comments you will understand just how long this review was getting.

June 14, 2009: I have deleted my response to the individual whose comments have been once again removed by Amazon, as they were out of place without that person's comments.  If you wish to read them, I have saved them and would be happy to send them to you--just go to my Profile to get my email address.  And thanks to everyone for making this my most successful, albeit declining in popularity vote percentages.  Regardless, if my review sparks interests, then it has achieved one of my objectives.

If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews.  My goal is to provide help to potential buyers, not get into any arguments.  So, if you only disagree with my opinion, could you please say so in the comments and not indicate that the review was not helpful.  Thanks.",1205452800,553,8109,4.946165191740413

He worked with the Kung Fu Masters in this and was amazing with the martial arts.  Then he was gentle and peace loving- trying to deal with an angry world.  He used what he was taught as a priest and it teaches.
Preserving peace and life and only using his incredible, unbeatable martial arts, when he had to.  This was made in the 1980's- way ahead of it's time. Unique, and masterfully done by a team of ultra talented people.

It's a shame, because it's a wonderful series, and the few minutes I got to watch before it froze brought me back to when I was fascinated with this show as a kid in the 70s.

One last point: these DVDs are two-sided, which I hate, as it's almost impossible not to get your fingerprints on them. That's not what happened here, but my Waltons collection is similarly two-sided, and you have to handle them very carefully to avoid smudges. The lack of a label makes it hard to know what disk it is, too, as the text in the ring around the middle is so small you can barely read it.

2993626,4,B000X07TLA,"I love KUNG FU. I love master Po. I love David Carradine's real commitment to the character. As most of you know Quentin Tarantino purposely wrote Kill Bills with David Carradine in mind to 'sort of"" play Caine.  My review is merely to comment on what is missing from this DVD release.
Namely--in all of the original ABC TV airings of the Two Part Episodes there was a recap of up to two minutes as a teaser before the opening theme credits. Those teasers are missing on these DVDs. Those teasers are also missing in syndication. I assume WB cvut them off the negative. Stored the film they cut somwhere..and may have lost it or didn't wish to send the time to restore.  Also missing are 60 second previews that were on Season 2 and 3. The ywould say ""Next on Kung Fu"". All are MIA. What is also missing--now this is the more interesting are the shows original Bumpers--- ""Kung FU will continue after station identification . when they returned there would be a still of Caine and some music. It was in every ABC episode . It is not in this set.

Aside from the minor issues above--the Quality of the transfers is excellent and since thi show as all shot on film it looks great. The scripts in Season 1 and 2 really hold up. Season three got a little too cut and dry and less life lessons for Caine vs Caine teaching others a lesson. Still it;s a great series. Muc hcare went into the shows production. continuity of episodes (Caine being true to his nature..no shoes..not taking pay for work..not being the aggressor , ever.).

I cant; say how people of today generation would re-act to this show. it goes very deep. has no hip Hop music or loud blidning soundtrack, measures a man's worth to himself and the universe. All kind of makes today's silly shows about dragons ,witches and Angry Housewives

2993851,5,B000X07TLA,"While some still tend to think of ""Kung Fu"" primarily as a martial arts show, it was in fact one of the most thoughtful & truly counter-cultural shows ever seen on American TV. Emerging at the beginning of the 1970s & coming out of the 1960s, it offered a very different kind of hero -- meditative, spiritually seeking, anti-violence, even vegetarian -- all as counterpoint to the popular American ideals of macho manhood, materialism, and the glorification of power & conquest. It dealt with racial & cultural prejudices, the complex (and often unrecognized) psychological drives of human beings, the insanity of violence as a solution to everything. Against the backdrop of the Vietnam War & the anti-war movement, its emphasis on harmony with Nature & inner peace provided a gentle, unassailable rebuke to war, revenge, brutality. Above all else, it was a series dedicated to the inner growth of the human soul, calling into question so many American values of the time -- ""values"" that still prevail today, sad to say. And it's equally sad that a show like this wouldn't have much chance of airing today, certainly not with the same lyrical, poetic tone & contemplative approach. It was only in that short period when it originally aired that such alternative worldviews were given their chance to be heard via popular entertainment.

And that's the other part of the show that makes it so good: it also works solely as absorbing, gripping entertainment. The philosophy is woven into the stories & emerges from the characters, not as lectures but as their natural actions. There's been controversy about David Carradine playing even a half-Chinese character ... but I honestly can't imagine anyone else doing anywhere near as well in the role. He brought a genuine otherworldliness to Kwai Chang Caine, while always keeping him human, with a sense of humor, and willing to learn from every encounter. Caine grows & develops throughout the series, even as his presence usually has a positive effect on those he meets & befriends. He's clearly a bit more worldly & bemused as the series goes on, which seems appropriate for a living, breathing, changing human being.

Now, it's true that there's a certain falling-off in the quality of the 3rd season. Fatigue eventually sets in with any show, as strong stories become harder to find. Still, there's enough to make even the 3rd season enjoyable, even if the finale is a little rushed. But they were wise to call it quits when they did, rather than overstaying their welcome. And the first 2 seasons are as good as anything you'll see on network TV, then & now. And here I want to call attention to the little, lyrical details that the camera would linger over -- dew on a spider web, sunlight on flowing water, a spray of leaves & flowers filling most of the frame -- the show not only talked about harmony with Nature, it did its best to evoke it with such tranquil imagery. In fact, it was one of the last shows for intelligent viewers before the flood of mindless 1970s TV came in. Thankfully it's available on DVD now, and well worth adding to your home library -- most highly recommended!",1470009600,3,3145,4.800738007380073

Jeff , you are changing from the most customer centric company to the most customer concentric company as we speak.  Now you have put on the big monopolistic squeeze,  just like a boa constrictor.  I have been a prime customer for several years now but this year I couldn't renew because I'm trying to save my teeth and dental bills seem worse than doctor bills now. I have noticed your Prime Only policy popping up elsewhere recently too.  Didn't you grow up middle class ?  THERE IS NO MORE MIDDLE CLASS - SO YOUR BIG SQUEEZE IS UPON ALL THE PEOPLE WHOSE SALARYS HAVEN'T INCREASED IN 30 YEARS AND THE GROWING POOR AND THE GROWING RANKS OF BOOMER RETIREES.  SINCE WHEN HAS YOUR  POLICYS BEEN TO STEP ON LITTLE PEOPLE ?  Your company has amassed great wealth, is this how you treat the customers who put you there ?  Anyone reading this message,  please mention this as you see this corporate squeeze in your reviews.",1466467200,5,1267,4.400862068965517

2993886,1,B000X07TLA,"I am only going to say this one time,  David Carradine is not Chinese. Kung Fu is not a true Asian-American TV show. It never has been a true Asian-American TV show. The Kung Fu TV series is racist because the lead was suppose to be played by famous martial artists, Bruce Lee. He was denied to play this part because Westerners said he was too Asian looking and he was not a bankable  At the the time, Westerners did not want to gamble their money on people who looked or was foreign. The 1970s was a racists period for minorities on TV.  I am so glad times are changing because as of 2015, the first Chinese-American TV sitcom, Fresh off the Boat, with Randall Park and Hudson Yang are making a difference in Chinese- American culture.",1466294400,,737,4.364963503649635

A right way.  A wrong way.  What will you do?

I'm not a David Carradine fan.  His lifestyle choices are/were questionable.  But as young grasshopper his character brought the venerable way to life.

Highly recommend to all (ages too). I enjoy looking back at the time machine of film to see some of my memorable favorites.  John Saxon.  Love that he tries.  Funny how Bruce Lee was skipped over for Carradine because he was Asian. Imagine the value of the series if Bruce had been the star!  This is a remake waiting to happen.  Why remake Knight Rider and not Kung Fu?",1465257600,,791,4.25

2993960,5,B000X07TLA,"As one who enjoys westerns, oriental religious philosophy, and martial arts, this series provides all three in each show.  The religious philosophy is particularly Taoist, of which I am not.  But most of the teaching is practical life virtues found also in my conservative Christian faith.  The theology of Taoism does not appear much, so it's interesting but I can ignore it (original Taoism was monotheist and very apophatic; modern Taoism is polytheistic worship of deified dead people/demigods; the theology of the TV series, what little it shows up, is of the modern type).  The martial arts, initially more Judo, but then Wushu, is much more realistic than what we used to watch in choreographed movie scenes (BTW, Kung Fu is not a martial art, but a life philosophy, of which Wushu is the martial art discipline in Shaolin monasteries [Wudang is the primary style in Crouching Tiger].  Kung Fu means ""[hard] work + [much] time,"" which results in great skill in whatever discipline one is dedicated to--music, cooking, brain surgery, or martial arts). What is also interesting is how David Carridine pulled off, at times, a Matrix/Neo effect, moving considerably more slowly than his almost-flailing antagonists (this occurs in ""The Legend Continues"" also).  The third season is somewhat inferior to the first two, though the third has many great episodes; but the third season contains some really weird, unnecessary segments.  These result in some scenes in which the ""special effects"" are obvious, and one even laughable.  Also, in one episode with Jose Feliciano and another musician, while the episode was good and the music was good, the lousy acting of the musicians is a bit irritating.  Because of the complaints in other reviews about bad quality discs and glitches, I watched the entire series over a 2-week period.  No glitches at all.  The quality of every episode was fine.  The DVD's contain several episodes presented with and without commentary (by Carradine), and also some other specials, and apparently three episodes that never aired.  Love it all.",1460592000,14,2075,5.121661721068249

2993967,5,B000X07TLA,"I remembered watching this show when it originally aired but have seen very little of it since.  I did find a copy of the pilot on a home made VHS tape from years gone by and re-watched it.  I still loved it, so I went looking and found the DVD set here.  Got it and in the first 2 days have watched 7 episodes and am heading in to watch a couple more.

I have now finished the entire series in right at 1 month.  Loved it all even though season 3 tended to have more mysticism in it then the first two seasons it was still good.

I noticed that someone had complained about the episodes that had David Carradine commentary over the episode.  This happened to episode 1 of season 2, ""The Well"".  It was a real pain to watch you missed so much of the dialog.  You could still sort of tell what was happening but a lot of the detail was lost.  They also had this episode with the commentary in special features which I figured is where it belonged.  I turns out, I think, I was correct.  There are 2 other episodes where David does commentary over the episode but in both cases it is only that way in the special features.  I suspect when they created the season 2 DVDs somebody messed up and put the commentary version in the episode section as well as in the special features.

My solution I just went to Amazon video and paid $1.99 for that episode digitally and watched it there.  It was worth it to see the episode.",1457568000,7,1418,4.161764705882353

2994107,4,B000X07TLA,"This series came out when I was in college. The Thoreau (albeit ""Eastern"") self-containment philosophy of Caine coupled with his stoicism and martial prowess made him a worthy model for many a pensive young athlete, myself among them. You might find yourself speaking in his soft, halting cadence, and even improving in your capacity for suffering fools and thinking before you acted. In some ways, therefore, this series taught more than any Philosophy 101 course could. The years passed on and the lessons of Kung Fu became part of the collective fabric of one's learning. Now recently it showed up--the whole series--here on Amazon for a good price. So I bought it and watch the episodes as I am working out. The flashbacks back to the Shaolin Temple days are accented by the wonderful work of Philip Ahn and especially Key Luke. Myself Now 62 and with a lot more stuff in my head, I am nevertheless still impressed by the poetry, subtlety, irony, and veracity of the Shaolin Masters lessons and morals. These are consistently the best written script components in each episode. On the other hand, the plots are quite tiresome and informed by leftist loathing of America. Virtually all antagonists are American rednecks who are invariably  xenophobic, unkempt, ignorant, and greedy. They also are part of a meat-eating society that practices a ritualistic Christianity that abets the recurring instances of greed, superstition, intolerance, and stupidity that makes up the repeatedly recycled conflict sources plot in and plot out. So the way I approach it is to suffer the foolishness patiently, ponder the profound messages of the Shaolin Masters, and enjoy this contact with that time in my life when I was lean and solid everywhere like Kwai Chang Caine.",1438473600,,1761,5.030821917808219

2994131,5,B000X07TLA,"I am in Season 2 now working my way through. This brings back good memories of the series. The quality for the most part is excellent for a series which is over 40 years old. Some individual episodes have spots where the quality drops some, but not enough to disappoint me. Again, this is 40 years old and I think the quality is amazing. There appear to be one David Carradine audio commentary per season. It is interesting to see actors such as a young Don Johnson, Victor French, and a number of others you will recognize. The philosophic sayings and musings on the part of Caine and his Shaolin Masters in his flashbacks are one of the things I really enjoyed about it as a kid. Like many 1970s shows it delves into issues that were newly being explored at the time in television, in this case primarily bigotry and racism. The show also explores Caine's mostly pacifist reaction to the violence of the Old West around him and his minimalist living. My only complaint is with the packaging. The boxed set aspect is fine, but the individual discs have episodes on the front AND back so be careful in handling them! Other than that, if you enjoyed this series in younger days and want to own it I would recommend it.",1437350400,,1217,4.461883408071749

From Slim Pickens and Jack Elam to Jodie Foster and Don Johnson, the list of fine actors goes on and on.

2994184,5,B000X07TLA,"It is a must have series.  I have probably watched this series 50 times since I was a kid in some form or fashion.  I just finished going through it again and even though it is period specific it is timeless and so are its messages.

Speaking of messages... many shows cannot pull off being politically and socially active AND entertaining but this was so well written it almost sneaks it past you.

It is not well-suited for young children.  It has sex, death, violence, scary images (like a snake pit) and some of the 70's style of film-making can make scenes scarier than they actually are.  Having said that it was on network TV and subject to stricter censoring than we have today.  I was watching it in my teens though and I have never needed a therapist.  Parental guidance is suggested.

I wish there could have been more.  I have no idea why the second Kung Fu is impossible to find at a reasonable price.

My only knock are the double-sided discs.  I think going the extra step to save a few cents is ridiculous.  I have so few in my overall collection it is obvious no one liked them.",1432944000,2,1095,4.361386138613861

2994208,5,B000X07TLA,"I was a UC Berkeley grad working as a forklift operator during the summer following my graduation, while awaiting to attend graduate school. To decompress from a demanding academic program (a double major in astronomy and applied math) I finally bought a small B/W TV and would watch ""Kung Fu"" weekly. I related to Kwai Chang Caine's strict training as a Shaolin priest and his fumbling yet tenacious experience coming to the United States, fleeing an unfair charge of murder in his native China. I strongly related to his principled approach to life, yet his willingness to use physical violence to counter physical violence.

Some 40 years later, as I re-watch these episodes, I cringe at the stereotypes, the exaggerated racism of 19th century Americans towards all minorities and the same tired plot line (Caine stumbles on something bad, he is confronted by someone as the doer of bad, he is abused and imprisoned, he finally has enough and escapes after giving some miscreant a mouthful of toenails to chew on, and he wanders once again).

Offsetting these drawbacks are the timeless teachings of Master Po to the young Caine: the wisdom expressed is worth the price of the DVD collection. No other TV series then or since has allowed such contemplative moments of a master patiently teaching an acolyte to learn, to question, to examine and finally to accept life lessons that are the underpinnings of a moral, ethical personality.

David Carradine's tragic death and real life persona do not diminish his characterization of Caine. He became Caine and Caine tried to become him but the real world intervened in a nondescript hotel room in Thailand. So, like with Caine, Carradine's death remains a mystery with no real answers.

Yes, there are some technical issues with the DVD and with production values of some of the episodes but these are minor details that do not detract from the value of a DVD collection of TV episodes that for a few short years, shone brightly above the vast sea of moronia that characterized (and still does) the offerings of most episodic productions aimed at a largely indifferent yet greedily consumptive American TV audience.",1432166400,3,2165,4.9559228650137745

2994353,5,B000X07TLA,"This is an awesome set that includes the pilot movie, and every episode of the original TV series. There are a few added short documentaries, such as how the series was originally created, and why Bruce Lee was not chosen as the lead actor, and some interesting stories about David Carradine. Perhaps the best is that the TV episodes look great. It is better than when they were first presented on TV. As a long-time fan of Kung Fu since childhood, seeing the entire series conveniently together in one affordable boxed set is wonderful. I bought this set for $32.96 when Amazon had it on a short sale. At that price, it is about $10 per season, and a way wonderful bargain for any fan!!!",1411776000,2,688,4.512

2994381,5,B000X07TLA,"I was pleasantly surprised at how nice this package is. It shipped out quickly, which was good because I was anxious to watch Cain after so many years. There are three DVD books that come in the cover that is shown. Each of those have a nice cover as well. Very nice, very pretty. The whole package is very pretty and not cheap in any way. When you open the books there are screen shots and episode descriptions and securely placed discs for each of the three seasons. All very attractive, as I said.
They play perfectly. The only issue I had is that I could not hear the voices. I became very sad. Then I changed the audio setting on the TV.  It was perfect again.
If you are a fan of Kwai Chang Cain, and you always wanted to have him on call like me, get this one.

2994382,2,B000X07TLA,"I loved this TV series when it first aired in the 1970's and was looking forward to watching it again (today). I watched the pilot and the first 3 episodes and it just didn't hold up for me. I (still) enjoy the flashbacks and the philosophy, however I just can't take all the drunk, stupid and racist men that are continually featured in the stories...I find it extremely boring and predictable. Also, the fake skull caps (for all the bald monks) are so darn obvious to me now, as are all of the stunt doubles during the fight scenes. And lastly, David Carradine, though his character Kwai Chang is a child of both American and Chinese parents, does not look Chinese, so why does he continually get referred to as ""Chinaman"" by people who see him for the first time? It doesn't make any sense to me...I guess I was able to suspend my disbelief when I was watching this in the 70's but it just looks plain silly to me now.",1410048000,,921,4.3604651162790695

I ordered a new item.  I received what looked like a used item in excellent condition.  I decided to keep it and watch one episode a day.  As I went through the set I cleaned the fingerprints off the discs, inspected the small scratches, and  enjoyed each episode.  When I got to Season 3, Disc 1, Side 2, it was heavily scratched and appeared to have had a chemical applied to it.  It played with skips and freezes.  I decided to return the item because this situation was unacceptable.  No, I can't.  I was past the return time by two days.  Moral of the story, some of those affiliated with Amazon will sell you used excellent as new.  This is dishonest.  If you do not get exactly what you ordered do not settle.

This is food for thought and worth reflecting upon, because there are too many adults living life today still dealing in child psychology.

2994538,2,B000X07TLA,"Kung Fu is my favorite television show of all time, so if you are looking for a new series to watch, I highly recommend.  A peaceful man, traveling in a new land, with his roots in Buddhist philosophy, and strength of character.  The Kung Fu fighting scenes are poor, compared to today's action movies, but at the time, it was a groundbreaking show, and many people did not even know what Wu Shu/Kung Fu was.

The discs are horrible.  They frequently lock up my player, in the middle of the episode.  I have kept them in the original boxes, and sometime wash them gently with mild soap and water, followed by immediate drying.  This helps only a little, and the episode will still lock up, same place, maybe just a bit further along.  This is an issue with every disc.

Hoping that this show comes out on Blu-Ray!  I think the disc quality would be much better with more modern press equipment.  For now, I would say, just watch the episodes on YouTube, and don't purchase these.",1379548800,4,979,4.480225988700565
2994539,5,B000X07TLA,Just exactly what was promised the full series with lots of extras to add depth to the understanding of the show and the times when it was made. I especially admire the respectful way in which the producers refer to Phillip Ahn (Master Kahn) and Keye Luke (Master Po)....this package is well worth the investment of money to purchase and the time to watch it. I am watching it with my children and grandchildren explaining the deeper meaning of the Taoist and Buddhist philosophies.,1378425600,,482,4.75
2994540,2,B000X07TLA,"When Kung Fu came out in 1972, you couldn't tear me away from it.  When I saw this listing on Amazon, I just hadta have it.  The quality of the video is almost HD quality, the audio as expected is circa early 70's.  The labeling says dolby digital, my ears say original soundtrack, mostly center channel with the sub-woofer kicking in but with little discernible bass.  The menu configuration is well thought out and easy to navigate.

The downside?  warner brothers.  They have the nasty habit of double-siding discs.  Three seasons on 11 dvd's, not 22, which means if you have a multi-disc changer such as a carousel, you have to copy at least 11 sides.  It's rather comical, that every disc opens with the typical piracy notice, FBI, prison, fine, etc., then they force you into a situation that you have to ignore their commandments.
All in all, this production has a 5 star capacity, yet due to warner brothers, two stars is it.",1377907200,4,933,4.606060606060606

For the most part this series has stood the test of time... somewhat...  The first season by far was the best from start to finish, things tended to drift downward in the 2nd.  The third season had some bright moments, but overall you could tell David was getting tired of playing the part.  Also I found the quality of the first season DVDs to be much better.  It looks like those were restored vs not touching the later seasons.  Thus my drop of 1 star.

Looking back now as an adult, the topic of prejudice and being an outcast loomed large.  A young person could learn a lot about how to treat their fellow man regardless of the color of his skin or shape of their eye!

The special features were really neat in particular the last DVD containing Davids trip to the Monastery. Of course the quotes are memorable.  There are some great life quotes one can use to move them to a better life.

I was in Junior high when this series came out, so it was perfect for me at this age and time with my interest in Bruce Lee (who was a candidate for the role of Caine) and also finding my way in the world.  A great mixture of action and philosophy.  The strangest western ever on TV up to that time and probably ever.  The stories, directing and acting are all exceptional.

The bonus material was well worth it-as it gives insight into the creation of the show-and other tid-bits of information. Sadly, one can see how the writing of the show gradually became poor. Season One is outstanding. Season Two, somewhat mediocre-and Season Three-well-it was hard to watch. It became obvious to me that the show would not have survived a Season Four.

2994601,5,B000X07TLA,"This classic TV series from the early 1970s has aged well - it helps hat it has an historic setting in the Wild West of America circa late 19th century. The show has an enchanting balance of mystic philosophy combined with action sequences and episodic plots, overlaid by the sub-plots of Caine escaping from the Chinese law and his search for his half-brother. Acting and scripts are strong, and there is a gentleness to the show which exercises the gray matter more than the louder, in your face type productions of more recent times. The slow motion effects on the fight scenes help to reduce the impact of the violence, much of which is understated anyway and is implied off-camera. I recall enjoyng the show as a youngster, and can do so again now with my sons.

Now that I have the complete series, I am able to recall how good the episodes were.  I had always admired David Carradine for taking on such a heroic role.  Here he is, an admirable man of peace, with not a bone of animosity towards anyone, travelng through the Wild West with many of its untamed and roughshod characters.  With his excellence of traning as a Shaolin priest, Caine knows well how to defend himself, always speaks the truth, remains consistent in his humble character, offers bits of remarkable wisdom along the way, and helps so very many people through his journeys.  Because he is half-Chinese, he inevitably gets ""picked on"" by the dregs and haters of society, wherever he seems to go, yet his presence is effective in improving someone's understanding of life, or their situation.  This series plays beautifully, with superb visual and audio clarity.  I picked the Kung Fu series to buy, as a present to myself, and I could not have chosen a better gift.  I am sure I will go through the DVD's several times over the years.  In these days when there is so much violence in the world, the character of Caine stands out as a breath of fresh air, demonstrating that there is a better choice than violence for any of us to make.",1351900800,32,1363,4.576131687242798

I could not, in good faith, place again an order for this title again from any source because the manufacturer would probably be the same. In other reviews I read where the some customers are happy with the DVD and it's quality while some are not; but, since the seller in my case was kind enough to inform me of the likeliness of damage and refused to ship until such time that a new batch arrived, they just cancelled the order, allowing me the option of reordering at a later date. Because of the likeliness of damage even with a new batch, I will not be ordering this title, even though I loved the TV series when it was aired.

Watching the entire three-season series recently, we found that its beauty and mastery continue to be both moving and instructive.  Do not expect 2009 special effects or scripts but do expect fine photography of meaningful stories dealing with racism, bigotry, mental illness, vengeance, oppression and such.  David Carradine is perfect as Kwai Chang Caine, a half-Chinese, half-American who was raised in a monastery in China.  The setting in the wild West of the U.S. includes flashbacks to his training by the monks.  The training emphasized compassion and nonviolence, yet included the Kung Fu which Caine uses when needed in his ""tough love"" approach.

2994614,5,B000X07TLA,"If any TV series needs to be remade, it's Kung Fu.

Not because the original isn't excellent. It is. But because current America needs the messages in this show.

I love the ""subversive"" teachings in this show. The classic Western is cowboys ""solving"" a problem with their guns and fists. It was the mythos of 1950s: the John Wayne type. These historical roots go deep for us Americans. The early English settlers saw the wild land and its indigenous people as dark and threatening, something to be defeated. (Extreme example: the plunderering, murderous Spanish Conquistadores.)

Then you have Kung Fu in the 1970s showing us how shallow is the ""brute force control"" approach to life. (God bless those flower children, and forgive their drug addictions.)

The character Kwai Chang Caine is a Shaolin monk, which comes from the Chinese Chan Buddhist tradition. Chan is the equivalent of Japanese Zen, which I know a little about. Zen teaches living in the present, which is really the only time you can live in. Also, letting go of anger, hatred, prejudices, regrets of the past, fears for the future, cravings for yet more stuff. We Westerners on our treadmill of materialism, ""success,"" and ""control"" could find a lot of peace from these kinds of teachings.

Buddhist style meditation, for example, has been shown to reduce stress, anxiety and depression, and also to foster compassion. There are many science-based books on this topic, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mindfulness-An-Eight-Week-Plan-for-Finding-Peace-in-a-Frantic-World/dp/1609611985/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mindfulness: An Eight-Week Plan for Finding Peace in a Frantic World</a>&nbsp;by Dr. Mark Williams at Oxford.

Buddhism, in its essential form, isn't a religion so much as a program of personal self-help. It's about accepting your reality (whatever that may be) and finding peace. Anyone can use Buddhist tools whatever their religious belief system. I'm a Christian personally, but Buddhist ideas have helped me a lot in my life. They actually help me become a better Christian.",1330387200,,2110,5.578125

Here are the three big things you need to know about the collection, from big to huge:

BIG: Errors in old TV shows framing: Back then 480 resolution was all they had to deal with, now transfered to 1080p with modern black levels, shows this old often reveal things that were hidden from the audience when they first aired. Occasionally you see a powerline, or notice from cut-to-cut that the daylight was WAY lower earlier in the scene than later.  All this can be corrected with relatively cheap CGI efforts, but no such effort was made on this collection.

BIGGER: No film restoration. In some cases the color correction is really bad, faded film, hairs in the transfer gate, spots and flickers that would have been treated and returned to original print quality in a more porperly restored version of the series are just left as is. You get the feeling they spun old prints through a transfer chamber and called it a day. Lazy work.

HUGE: Way back when Kung Fu was cancelled some lame brains at the network decided to air the last six shows out of order to capitalize on sweeps ratings, making the six story arc ending of the series occur with the last three preceding the first three. An easy fix, the DVD makers could have put the shows in the correct story order and list the air-dates on the insert material. They didn't, however, simpley following the air order instead of the intended story order. GOOD GRIEF.  Fortunately, this can be fixed. When you get to the very last DVD of the series, watch the B-side first, then the A-side last, and you get the correct story arc. It is worth the effort to do this!!!!!!!

Sad about the lazy DVD work, but -- if this is how you have to get such a great show, the flaws are not bad enough that you should pass up the opportunity!",1282262400,168,2141,4.460358056265985

2994646,5,B000X07TLA,"I have just completed the entire three season series, including commentary tracks and special features.  If you have any memories of this series, this is a wonderfully priced addition to your tv catalog; if you have heard of the series and want to check it out, this is still a great buy, because once you go through the first season you will want to finish the journey.  I remember watching the show in the 70s, but because it has been syndicated so little (unlike say Star Trek), I really did not remember specific episodes, but only recalled the basic structure of the show.  And that has been well described by other reviewers.

As to the series itself, in my humble opinion season one is good, with the show finding its legs.  Season two is far and away the strongest, with important themes coursing through nearly every episode.  Season three suffered from what other reviewers have pointed out was an increasing reliance on mystical/magical themes.  Less commented on has been some of the really rough acting found in season three, including Barbara Hershey (Seagull) in a critical two parter directed by Caradine himself.  His girlfriend at the time (and based on some later commentary the relationship may have been winding down even while they were filming) does not do a very good job in a critical role.  And in the last four episodes which wind up the series, the Barrimore playing the son of Danny Caine really doesn't do a very good job in the role. These acting problems were nowhere in evidence in the second season.  In addition, in season three the series moved away from the basic structure of the show, with its connected flashbacks tracking with the old west action.  It's my belief that these changes/problems accelerated after Caradine announced it was all over, and they rushed their way to a series finale, which is beautiful, by the way, with Caradine using his last dance move to gracefully exit the stage.

To summarize: if you have any interest in this ground breaking series, you won't be disappointed.  And if you have interest in it, you are really going to want to see the whole thing.  Trust me.",1279238400,5,2130,4.737127371273712
2994647,5,B000X07TLA,"As one person has already said, there are other excellent reviews, and I'll just add my voice to theirs. So read those. The negatives may be true, but for the most part, if your memory is from watching these some 30 years ago, you'll be astounded at how good they actually look. The fact is, they look better now, on our new wide-screen digital tv's, than they ever looked on tv when when were originally released. The complaints about ""snow"" are mostly true only for the opening sequence---actual shows rarely have much.  I also bought mine at a hefty discount, and it was worth every penny.

So if you got to this Kung Fu page because you were considering buying it---just do it. The cons are minor (if you even notice them), the pros major.

I'll add one more thing: the show has staying power, even for new audiences. My wife originally castigated me for buying this---now after watching the first year---she wants to buy sets to send to her family! And she pinches pennies til Lincoln screams.",1276992000,15,998,4.595505617977528

Each time just before I finished EVERYTHING disappeared in this comment section thanks to the web program Amazon is using....So this final attempt will be written in MS Word then copied to Amazon.  This complete series added many hours of enjoyment for me and my family and my grand kids.  NOTHING MORE NEED BE SAID ABOUT THE TV SERIES. That being said it also had a great discourse on how and why the series became a reality.  It told those who were originally chosen for the lead and why Carradine was chosen for the lead.  It also explained why the series ended when it did on top of the pile,  Carradine just said ""that's enough"" and walked off the set in the middle of the filming and while the show was at the top of the ratings.  Also Carradine was never sued for his breach of contract.  Buy this set and buy another for a friend or friends you love and learn more.",1276473600,4,929,4.2988505747126435

After we previewed the two first episodes we decided against showing the series to our daughter. We believe that she is still too young to understand the constant denigration of non caucasian people in the series. We will wait that she is able to understand that the series emphasizes on racial issues and when she will be more able to appreciate the other values of the story, respect, discipline, etc.",1275350400,2,543,4.666666666666667
2994650,5,B000X07TLA,"The package came in good shape. It took a little longer than I thought it would take. The discs played fine on my computer using Power DVD 9. The episodes are complete and of very good appearance. There are breaks in the play where a commercial should have been...but I love no commercials...I can live with the momentary interruption of content. Picture is clean and clear, sound is very good. You've got to consider the original was quite awhile ago. I think they did a pretty good job. On two occasions, I encountered a slight freeze of the play back. I can't account for that. The discs appear to be very clean. The only thought I would have is either a mechanical or software issue. Not really a bother, just requires some investigation on my part. I rate it five stars, more than happy with the purchase. Sorry, I haven't reviewed any of the ""extras"" yet.",1274227200,4,861,4.5256410256410255
2994651,4,B000X07TLA,"I may be a bit atypical for my generation, I grew up mostly withOUT TV.  So I only saw 3-5 Kung Fu episodes at the neighbors house as a teenager when this series first aired.  It made a mysterious and strangely indelible impression on me -- one I've intermittently recalled over the last several decades.  Occasionally elements reminescent of Kung Fu and his training monastery have shown up in my dreams --prompting me to wonder about the series again.  Thus, I've wished to see a few of the episodes again to understand why.

Perhaps they've been reshown on TV in the interim, but if so, I missed that too.  After news of the untimely loss of David Carradine last year, I turned to Amazon to look for DVDs of the series.  I found this 3-volume set and have been very pleased with sound and image quality -- now having gone through over half of them.

I don't know that my more extensive questions about David Carradine, Taoism or Kung Fu have been answered -- or ever will be.  But this quiet, unhurried, travelling monk who chooses to honor the mysteries of life on a meandering path, to work, and when possible avoid unneeded power, wealth, and violence -- these principles still capture my attention.

I seemed to have missed the critical window for developing much of a screen viewing habit, either for TV or movies.  Yet this is one series I've actually been willing to set aside time to sit down and enjoy.

As an adult, I now appreciate learning more of what went into development of the episodes including input from the chinese community.  At first I thought the arrogance and intolerance of the Wild West was a bit overdone, an exaggerated  characturization.  However, about the same time as this series arrived I began reading _<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Needles-Herbs-Gods-and-Ghosts-China-Healing-and-the-West-to-1848/dp/0674023978/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Needles, Herbs, Gods, and Ghosts: China, Healing, and the West to 1848</a>(reviewed elsewhere).  From a completely different perspective, this book documents pretty good evidence to support believing that early encounters of West meets East led to rather challenging confrontations -- symbolically, ideologically, and not too hard a stretch for physically, too.",1269648000,4,2278,5.286111111111111
2994652,5,B000X07TLA,When Kung Fu was on tv in the 70's it made quite an impression on me.  I can watch episodes over and over and find something new in each one. It's like a walk back in time.,1268265600,6,172,3.6486486486486487

2994659,5,B000X07TLA,"Like a lot of other reviewers, I was a fan of this series when it first aired. I'm often disappointed when re-viewing something I thought was great in my youth--perhaps my standards are higher now, or perhaps I've just become more of a curmudgeon in my old age--but to my surprise and delight this series really holds up. Sure, it's hokey and a little preachy (a little?) but even as a naive teenager ready to believe anything I knew that. If you look past the camp, and the early seventies sensibility, you find a core of simple stories that remind you of many of the central truths about the nature of life, love, evil, and nature herself that you may have forgotten along the way. It's also just darn good TV for its vintage, both in terms of writing and production value, and every episode has the obligatory fight scene so you don't get too bored. Nothing lifts your spirits like  watching a skinny vegetarian pacifist tree-hugger kick the crud out of a bunch of blow-hards!

Oh yeah, this does have the pilot episode (I had some doubt about that initially) and the packaging is fine, if a little excessive. (I wish they'd start selling DVDs in simple envelopes so they don't take up so much shelf space, but it will probably never happen.) My only complaint is that the individual DVDs are labeled by season but not disc number, so it's kind of a pain to keep them straight if someone (a-hem) forgets to put one away.",1259539200,2,1423,4.511627906976744

2994664,5,B000X07TLA,"I'm a blackbelt in Kung Fu.  There were two things that motivated me to eventually take up martial arts.  A novel I'd read when I was about 12 that revolved around the main character taking Judo, and this show, which I watched when I was about 15.  Eventually when I was in my 20's, I took up Kung Fu.  Now my kids are taking martial arts (one is getting ready for her black belt test).  I was surfing the web recently and came across this set of DVD's.  I've read some of the othe reviews on this set and how some of them were dissapointed with the quality of the video.  I don't know what they were watching, but it doesn't appear that what I recieved and what they watched could be the same thing.  The quality is way better than what I remeber as the original TV show.  The video is very brilliant.  The colors are vivid.  The sound is acceptable (I'm sure the original was in mono).  We're about done with the first season.  Now when the kids ask what we are going to watch together on a Friday night, I just start whistling the theme song and they get all excited.",1254960000,4,1070,4.186274509803922
2994665,4,B000X07TLA,"I have been (re)enjoying this series that I enjoyed so much as a teenager.  The series starts with the original pilot movie which is essential to be able to understand the rest of the series. (Otherwise you just get bits and pieces thrown at you about where Caine came from and why).

It comes nicely packaged in a box and each season is in a foldout with 4 DVDs in its own box within the bigger one.  They are nicely illustrated.  The amazing thing to watch is how season#1 differed from season #2 which in turn differed from saeson #3.  In the first season, both Caine as well as the story line and characters are naive and over simplified.  But, that progresses through season #2 into the 3rd season to where both Caine as well as the stories and characters are much more sophisticated.  Unfortuantly, much of the teaching drops away as Caine becomes more adept at managing the situations that he finds himself in.

The DVDs also have a few special features -- such as Carradine having dinner with people who appeared in the series over the years while they reminisced.  I can't say that I enjoyed watching them, but I did learn a number of things about the series:  Did you know that the ""rice paper"" was actually butcher paper because they couldn't find a roll of rice paper -- and, that you couldn't tear it if you tried -- and they did!

My only ocomplaint is that the sound quality is very marginal -- almost poor. I run the sound through my Yamaha amp and tower speakers and, in order to hear it I have to have the volume turned up to 3/4s which would typically have the windows rattling.  In addition, the left channel keeps cutting out.  But, once you get past all that stuff, the audio is at least clear and understandable.

I highly recommend this package.",1254960000,10,1769,4.453416149068323

2994667,3,B000X07TLA,"When my friend told me he bought the complete television series of Kung Fu, I immediately rushed on Amazon to get one for myself.  I planned on spending my entire Sunday watching as much as I could back to back to back to back....

Well, In all honesty, this series was MUCH cooler when I was 12.  After a few episodes I put it away and will be selling the series in the ""used"" section soon.  The pacing is slow and awkward at times and the dialogue and situations are extremely cheesy most of the time.  The fight scenes are laughable and pretty much unwatchable by today's standards.  It made me really respect how devoted today's actors are when training for a role.  David Carradine appears to know about as much Kung Fu as my Grandmother.  And, he's about as athletic as her too.  (At least in this role, I seem to remember him doing an okay job in Kill Bill[s]).

Anyway, I wish I had gone over to my friends to re-watch an episode prior to buying the set for myself.  Times change, we change, and this includes our taste and standards.  Things from our childhood aren't always as cool as we remember them.  It's a bummer, but, it turns out this show is actually kind of lame.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 was that there is some value in this series for families.  Kids aged 8-12 might enjoy this show and it's probably a better option than what's on TV today.

The disks play pretty well, but periodically an entire chapter will be skipped.  I accidentally figured this out when I reverse-played an episode that seemed to end abruptly; the reverse-play mode took me into the final chapter which I otherwise would have just skipped over to the credits.

Aside from the fact that they add to the episodes and are not all the same, does he not know that all you have to do is hit the chapter button once to skip over it if you wish?
It has been complained that only the first season is letter-boxed.  Don't people know that all you have to do is to change the format on your TV is by pressing a button in order to change this to any format you like?
The episodes are faithful to the original broadcasts in that occasionally you will see a small flaw left over from the film, like a tiny spot of dirt within the picture momentarily, etc., really nothing to be concerned about at all.
If you want anything to complain about, and it is rather minor but enough to keep it from getting 5 stars, it would be that the DVD's are double sided, which makes it trickier to figure out what disc and side you are looking for, they were recorded in the aired sequence rather than the order of production, and that they come in a folded cardboard type packaging which puts each season in a fold-out container, which is not the easiest to handle.
Minor issues really, as the alternative would be not to have one of the best series of all time at all.  Oh and the set has some wonderful bonus features like where David goes to China to actually visit the real Shaolin Temple.  Enjoy.",1252713600,4,1447,4.209386281588448

2994679,5,B000X07TLA,"The ""Kung Fu"" series [starring ""Grasshopper"" David Carradine and many other good folks] is one of the few TV shows I have always liked. I have mostly given-up on most recent TV -- due to the lack of long-running quality shows such as ""Kung Fu"". One great exception is the fairly recent ""Andromeda"" series -- which also combines action adventure with a strong ethic guiding the heros, led by their starship captain, in restoring law-and-order civilization during a galactic dark age. There is some quite good martial arts action and a little deep philosophy in that fine show. But, in contrast, ""Kung Fu"" has only one lonely hero versus first Imperial China and later Wild West America. This ex-Shaolin Monk half-breed wanderer must survive in an alien and violent setting [especially for him] -- The Old Wild West. Yet, he follows his Shaolin ethics while using his Shaolin Kung Fu indirectly, and directly as he must, to survive and help others.

When I was quite young, I would try to watch every episode of ""Kung Fu"" -- catching every run and rerun that I could find via TV. I was very inspired by ""Kung Fu"". I continued to watch all of it I could -- even after starting my own study of The Art-and-Way via ""Kenpo Jiu-Jitsu"" -- a distant offspring of Shaolin Kung Fu. Jeet Kune Do and Bruce Lee are technically as great as can be -- and well worth carefully studying -- but I have been more personally inspired by ""Kung Fu"" and ""Grasshopper"" David Carradine. Oddly, Bruce Lee was hoping to star in ""Kung Fu"" -- but for various reasons was turned-down in favor of Carradine -- which is well-and-good cause now we have them both.

Eventually, one of my big concerns was ""whether Carradine really followed The Art-and-Way"". Almost all of the Kung Fu action in ""Kung Fu"" is slowed-way-down -- allowing us to see it well -- but also allowing for David Carradine to be ""micro-directed"" by someone who really knew The Art-and-Way. Well, Carradine started slowly to get involved in The Art-and-Way -- via his Tai Chi Praying Mantis ""micro-director"" -- and later was fully into Tai Chi Praying Mantis and The Art-and-Way. So, I recall, with some amused chagrin nowadays, me later ""wondering about who tossed-together those Tai Chi and Praying Mantis moves with some odd Jiujitsu, in slow-motion, to fool us"". Now, I realize it is some pretty good Tai Chi Praying Mantis -- with some associated Chin Na grappling and some other moves. The interesting much newer sci-fi-action [space opera western] ""Firefy"" series has a similar odd blend of China-and-America and a fair amount of Kung Fu -- well, really a hybrid of Ballet, Savate Kickboxing and Kung Fu.

The ""Kung Fu"" series is quite un-dated, very viewable and inspiring even now -- the plots, scenes, action and characters are as excellent as ever. It is still a singular creative pioneering show -- well worth the cost to get the whole series in this big box-set.

2994683,5,B000X07TLA,"I have studied the Tao for many years; translated Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching; and worked professionally on books about the I Ching by Carol Anthony (as an editor). So watching this television show is fairly overwhelming: I hear myself saying things like, ""Master Kan is reading Lao Tzu's 34th verse"" and ""Master Po is reciting Chapter 11 of the Tao Te Ching!"" and ""Kwai Chang is reading the 25th verse over that grave.""

Perhaps what's most astonishing is that no one ever tried this again after this show ended. That is, teach the Tao via a Hollywood-produced drama in prime time. The quality of this series is remarkably consistent -- it faded only in the latter part of the third year when Carradine had announced he was quitting and forced some hurried and contrived work on the writers and producers so that there might be some sense of closure. But the first two years, and much of the early part of the third, are just extraordinary across the board -- writing, production, direction, acting, and above all, the message of peace, humility, and gentle humor. Thorpe, the producer, once mentioned in an interview all the letters he got from teachers praising the show, and read one in particular from a teacher at a school for troubled boys who thanked him and Carradine for proving to his kids that you can be a man without having a gun.

The series best shows its Tao in its humor. A representative scene is when young Caine finally achieves the goal of walking across the rice paper without leaving a trace; his first act after that is to sneak up on Master Po and surprise him. The entire scene is done in silence until, just as Caine is about to spring upon the old blind man, Keye Luke smiles and says, ""Good afternoon, Grasshopper."" Carradine (a very skillful actor, particularly with his body) gracefully deflates behind his master. A lovely, funny moment featuring two superb actors.

By the second season the writers were running out of steam and by the third season they were running on momentum. David Carredine's acting is strong through out the series but the supporting guest actors got pretty weak for the most part by the third season.

I hesitated buying it when I read some of the reviews saying quality of recording sucked-I'm very happy I did. Quality is great, story lines are great, it has really held up over time.

I watched Kung Fu as a kid and loved both the martial arts and philosophy of the show.  As an adult, I was afraid it would be pretty cheesy, as some other series have turned out after a number of years (Wild, Wild West was one of them).

This series is very well done, I am so glad I bought it. Most of the episodes I haven't seen or don't remember. The kung fu is mild by todays standards; but that is part of what makes it so tasteful and exceptional in my humble estimation. David Carradine is truly excellent in this role; but all the other supporting actors and actreses, incluiding children by the way, are so professional....as fine a screeen or stage character actors as you are likely to ever see. Makes you realize how TV is such garbage anymore...they could not or would not create and produce such a quality program today, it just wouldn't happen. Kudos to Jerry Thorpe. I find his directed episodes to be the most authentic and awesome. This is highly recommended if you are a fan of any Chinese Martial Arts, in this case northern Tibetan Black Crane, but also as a statment for its time..this series was far out ahead of anything else and stands up quite well on it's own merit today in 2009.",1246406400,2,1179,4.488372093023256

I have to admit i feel most fortunate to have acquired the set, for years i have been looking forward to the day when i could finally get to see the series again in its entirety. This is the only show of its kind ever. What makes it unique is not the kung fu, but the philosophy. Every episode is encapsulated enlightenment. Each episode is moved by meaning.

Yet the manner which he died leaves me with a bitter taste...why hide in a closet when you could have done that from a streetlamp??

I was hoping for more bonus stuff, but perhaps I'm just spoiled by todays shows on DVD and the stuff they have. The quality is great! Many complained about the cropping for a widescreen look, but I didn't notice it, nor do I really care.

This was waaaay ahead of its time back in 1972... wow.  Like the ill-fated original ""Star Trek,"" this brief series was just too far ahead of its American audiences' abilities to comprehend good writing with mind-challenging storylines, however, in many ways, ""Kung Fu"" exceeds in challenging the viewer as the shows are extremely cathartic and not just challenge one's mind, but also their [i]soul[/i].  Now, don't get me wrong, I am very firm in my beliefs as a born-again Christian, however, this show in a weird way parallels many of the teachings in the Bible and never disrespects anyone's religious views.  That is hard to accomplish, but the producers, writers, directors aided bi David Carradine, masterfully pulled it off alongside Keye Luke, Philip Ahn and Radames Pera,  as well as other guest actors.

The result is an outright masterpiece... my 12 year-old son loves this show as well, so it is not 'too' deep... it is just right.  When I was his age, I remembered seeing this show as it debuted alongside my dad, asking him questions every once in a while primarily about the flashbacks of the teachings as a boy.  The poignancy of those flashbacks even today as man nearing half a decade of precious life on this earth, still remain relevant.

I love this show.  In years to come, I believe ""Kung Fu"" will receive a lot of acclaim it has yet to achieve.  ABC took some chances back in those days... and in my opinion, pushed TV beyond its barriers with shows such as this and ""Mod Squad,"" etc.  Thank God we have these shows forever preserved onto DVD nowadays that we can revisit such treasures... and get away from mind-numbing shows such as ""Dancing With The Stars"" and the like... yuck.  There are so few shows out these days other than ""Lost"" that really make one [i]expand[/i] their mind as ""Kung Fu"" did.

Story: Chinese-American grows up in a temple in China, defends his temple master but becomes a wanted outlaw, escapes to America and wanders trying to find his brother.  Nice philosophy is given as flashbacks in the temple during his journeys.  Music is nice, has a nice melody and is somewhat melancholy, but very enjoyable.

DVD packaging, disks and cases: attractive package, double-sided disks, fold-out, hard-case plastic with those dreaded CENTER PUSH mechanisms that don't let the disks out easy-- you know, the ones that break when pushed, and don't release the disk, and the ones that ALL CONSUMERS dislike and many manufacturers keep making!  Warner-Brothers, are you listening?

DVD transfers: taken from film without any special remastering
Season 1 is widescreen that has cropped images that everyone complains about, seasons 2 and 3 are full screen format.  All season images are not so bad though but there are noticeable spots white / black that occur occasionally due to the transfer from film.  DVDs have English subtitles that is VERY ESSENTIAL for hard of hearing, noisy environments, and children and persons learning English.

DVD Arrangement: good with highlighted episodes in the case and summaries.  DVD menus are also good.  Season 1 has the Warner-Brothers logo AND music that cuts off the last bit of the Kung-Fu music ending.  WB, DON'T DO THAT!! Season 3 lets almost the last bit of music play and fortunately uses a SILENT WB logo as the almost all of the last music is played.

Kung-Fu was for many Americans, their introduction to the Buddhist way of living. While many are drawn to the martial arts sequences, the true gem of each episode is contained in the flashback sequences that present lessons learned by the main character while a monastic novice.

Despite its apparent simplicity, each show is accessible on many levels and is enjoyable simultaneously by all members of your family. This series reminds us that there is time for all things and that there are no ordinary moments in our lives.

If only today's media conglomerates were brave enough to produce such an intelligent, thoughtful and necessary show now...

3227911,4,B000X07TLA,The series is complete and all inclusive.  This is good and this is bad. Many episodes begin with the same 3-5 minuete introduction and this can become boring to the max.  I wish that this redundancy could be edited out without destroying the originality of the collection.,1218672000,8,273,4.787234042553192
3227912,5,B000X07TLA,Growing up in the 70's I watched the Kung Fu series every week.  It was the high light of my week. I ordered the series and could not believe the series was better than I remembered it from childhood.,1212192000,97,200,4.128205128205129
3227913,2,B000X07TLA,"The quality of the DVD's is mediocre, specially Season One. Perhaps the series were too old to put into DVD's, it is so frustrating to have interruptions while watching a show (those that can be watch. I will pursue some reimbursement or exchange for the money. It is great to watch
those shows that made it okay into DVD's.",1207612800,19,324,4.508474576271187
3227914,5,B000X07TLA,"Kung Fu drastically challenged the conservative, militaristic, and philosophically naive outlook I held as a 20 year old college student and ""gung-ho"" ROTC cadet in 1972.  Now, 36 years later, I have had the opportunity to watch Kung Fu once more, and the impact has been nearly as powerful.  I have been disabled for severe depression and anxiety for over 15 years, including close to two years of hospitalization.  In all of that time I have barely moved forward--until re-watching Kung Fu.  The show has visually reminded me of many things, repeatedly told me by therapists, in such a way that I am once again able to reflect--especially while watching the show--a little more positively on my life.

That is the beauty and mastery of Kung Fu, one of the most intriguing shows ever made: it invokes one to THINK, discuss, and contemplate.  The only other show I have seen have such an effect on so many people (nearly 90% of my ROTC class of 207 cadets watched Kung Fu as well as me), is the original two years of Star Trek.  BUT, the level and intensity invoked by Kung Fu was immeasurably greater than that of Star Trek.  The commentaries and features (see the Comments for listing of these items) often mention how teachers ""required"" students to watch Kung Fu, and then discussed the episodes in class.  In deed, it is the philosophical nature of the show that most appeals to me and many who watch it.

Conversely, I will not deny that the show led me to sign up for Judo classes too (over 50% of my friends signed up for some form of martial arts), but the Karate nature of the show was never that appealing to me.  Kung Fu is frequently accredited for ""introducing"" thousands of people to the martial arts.  Unfortunately, many who watch the show or have watched the show have followed the path of what I consider ""aggressive"" martial arts, forgetting the retrospective nature of true Kung Fu.  But, I must believe that if parents watch the show with their children, they can have an opportunity to talk with their children about both aspects of Kung Fu.

Another fabulous feature of the show is that viewers are presented with the reality of bigotry and hate--something that never ends, and is completely pertinent to today's world.  (Please see the Comments for an example of how the mere fact that I lamented--now also in the Comments--that the DVDs are in English only prompted someone ""disrespectful to Americans living in AMERICA."")  Again, parents could easily use episodes to discuss and help their children--be they victims, violators, or naive--deal with bigotry and hate.

PLEASE NOTE:  Warner Brothers has apparently advertised, and thus Amazon has listed, this set to contain wide-screen formate; see the Comments for more discussion on this.  While the Season One episodes have been digitally reformatted ""IN A ""MATTED"" WIDESCREEN FORMAT PRESERVING A THEATRICAL EXHIBITION ASPECT RATIO. ENHANCED FOR WIDESCREEN TVs,"" all episodes and features in the Season 2 and 3 sets are in fact full screen.  The release date (on Amazon and the back of the red slip case for the series) states 2007, but season boxes all state they were done in 2005; so I don't think there is any difference between the Complete Series Box Set and the single season box sets.  On an even sadder note, while Warner Brothers did attempt to improve the quality of the shows and alter the formate, they did so, with varying success, for the first season only.  (Again, please see the Comments for more discussion on this matter).  For the second and third seasons, Warner Brothers either did nothing or very little to restore the negatives, so the episodes are littered with white specs, scratches, and so on (although I found them no less bothersome than those found when watching a well used copy of a movie showing at a theater; for more discussion on this, see the Comments).  That said, one must remain mindful of the fact that ""Kung Fu"" was filmed for television not the theater, was on a limited budget, and the fact that the negatives, when placed in the vault for storage, were most likely not very high quality to begin with; after all, nobody anticipated cable television syndication, let alone VHS and DVD production when the negatives were stored.  On the other hand, this inconsistency in DVD quality (be it television shows or movies) is what I have now come to expect from Warner Brothers: misinformation and little or no care for their consumers; out of seventeen letters I have sent to them with questions, they have never replied to a single one.

All that said and done: Please consider renting (if available) or buying the Kung Fu series, and watch it with family and friends if you have them.  ""Kung Fu - The Complete Series"" includes the award winning Pilot movie and all 62 episodes on 11 discs, starring David Carradine as Kiwai Chang Caine, Philip Ahn as Master Kan, and Keye Luke as Master PO.  Special guest stars (some of which I have noted in the Comments) include David's father John Carradine, Benson Fong, Harrison Ford, Jodie Foster, Don Johnson, Leslie Nielsen, William Shatner, and others.  ""Kung Fu"" is a show that is thought provoking, educational, inspirational, and unforgettable.  ""Kung Fu"" is a show that can be watched over and over--by yourself, with friends, or with your family.  There is no other TV show that I would recommend for people of all ages than ""Kung Fu""--so, treat yourself with the whole series.

UPDATE--FEBRUARY 22, 2009: It came to my attention while reading ""A Kid's Review--Kung Fu is the best, and this is the best way to own them,"" that I failed to mention the great extra features included in each of the three season sets.  In particular, in the Season Three Set, there is a fascinating documentary that follows David Carradine and some of his friends on a trip to China, where David is given a Shaolin robe on their visit to the famed Shaolin Temple Monastery, a key location depicted in the series, and David plays his flute on the Great Wall of China while it is snowing.  For&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill-Volume-One/dp/B00005JMEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill - Volume One</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill-Volume-Two/dp/B00005JMUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill - Volume Two</a>&nbsp;fans, there is a bonus feature on the Season Two set that features David Carradine having dinner with stars/friends from these two films and the ""Kung Fu"" series.  (See the Comments for more details on other bonus features and special guest stars, including Harrison Ford!).

Also, I feel like this review has become too long in my efforts to answer questions.  Therefore, I am going to cut my other updates and place them in a comment.  For first time readers, these comments deal with the following: film format and transfer quality for each season; languages and subtitles for the episodes and extra features; the fact that the discs are double sided; more on how the series is packaged; and, bonus features (rather than listing them here).  I sincerely apologize if this is an inconvenience for some, but if you look at the comments you will understand just how long this review was getting.

June 14, 2009: I have deleted my response to the individual whose comments have been once again removed by Amazon, as they were out of place without that person's comments.  If you wish to read them, I have saved them and would be happy to send them to you--just go to my Profile to get my email address.  And thanks to everyone for making this my most successful, albeit declining in popularity vote percentages.  Regardless, if my review sparks interests, then it has achieved one of my objectives.

If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews.  My goal is to provide help to potential buyers, not get into any arguments.  So, if you only disagree with my opinion, could you please say so in the comments and not indicate that the review was not helpful.  Thanks.",1205452800,553,8109,4.946165191740413

He worked with the Kung Fu Masters in this and was amazing with the martial arts.  Then he was gentle and peace loving- trying to deal with an angry world.  He used what he was taught as a priest and it teaches.

One last point: these DVDs are two-sided, which I hate, as it's almost impossible not to get your fingerprints on them. That's not what happened here, but my Waltons collection is similarly two-sided, and you have to handle them very carefully to avoid smudges.

As most of you know Quentin Tarantino purposely wrote Kill Bills with David Carradine in mind to 'sort of"" play Caine.  My review is merely to comment on what is missing from this DVD release.
Namely--in all of the original ABC TV airings of the Two Part Episodes there was a recap of up to two minutes as a teaser before the opening theme credits. Those teasers are missing on these DVDs. Those teasers are also missing in syndication. I assume WB cvut them off the negative. Stored the film they cut somwhere..and may have lost it or didn't wish to send the time to restore.  Also missing are 60 second previews that were on Season 2 and 3. The ywould say ""Next on Kung Fu"". All are MIA. What is also missing--now this is the more interesting are the shows original Bumpers--- ""Kung FU will continue after station identification . when they returned there would be a still of Caine and some music. It was in every ABC episode . It is not in this set.

Aside from the minor issues above--the Quality of the transfers is excellent and since thi show as all shot on film it looks great. The scripts in Season 1 and 2 really hold up. Season three got a little too cut and dry and less life lessons for Caine vs Caine teaching others a lesson. Still it;s a great series. Muc hcare went into the shows production. continuity of episodes (Caine being true to his nature..no shoes..not taking pay for work..not being the aggressor , ever.).

I cant; say how people of today generation would re-act to this show. it goes very deep. has no hip Hop music or loud blidning soundtrack, measures a man's worth to himself and the universe. All kind of makes today's silly shows about dragons ,witches and Angry Housewives
the lower end of civilization. I don't think this show would have a chance to be this pure if produced today. A great show. Buy it,
and enjoy Masters Po and Khan.",1497484800,,1964,4.447222222222222

3228348,5,B000X07TLA,"While some still tend to think of ""Kung Fu"" primarily as a martial arts show, it was in fact one of the most thoughtful & truly counter-cultural shows ever seen on American TV. Emerging at the beginning of the 1970s & coming out of the 1960s, it offered a very different kind of hero -- meditative, spiritually seeking, anti-violence, even vegetarian -- all as counterpoint to the popular American ideals of macho manhood, materialism, and the glorification of power & conquest. It dealt with racial & cultural prejudices, the complex (and often unrecognized) psychological drives of human beings, the insanity of violence as a solution to everything. Against the backdrop of the Vietnam War & the anti-war movement, its emphasis on harmony with Nature & inner peace provided a gentle, unassailable rebuke to war, revenge, brutality. Above all else, it was a series dedicated to the inner growth of the human soul, calling into question so many American values of the time -- ""values"" that still prevail today, sad to say. And it's equally sad that a show like this wouldn't have much chance of airing today, certainly not with the same lyrical, poetic tone & contemplative approach. It was only in that short period when it originally aired that such alternative worldviews were given their chance to be heard via popular entertainment.

And that's the other part of the show that makes it so good: it also works solely as absorbing, gripping entertainment. The philosophy is woven into the stories & emerges from the characters, not as lectures but as their natural actions. There's been controversy about David Carradine playing even a half-Chinese character ... but I honestly can't imagine anyone else doing anywhere near as well in the role. He brought a genuine otherworldliness to Kwai Chang Caine, while always keeping him human, with a sense of humor, and willing to learn from every encounter. Caine grows & develops throughout the series, even as his presence usually has a positive effect on those he meets & befriends. He's clearly a bit more worldly & bemused as the series goes on, which seems appropriate for a living, breathing, changing human being.

Now, it's true that there's a certain falling-off in the quality of the 3rd season. Fatigue eventually sets in with any show, as strong stories become harder to find. Still, there's enough to make even the 3rd season enjoyable, even if the finale is a little rushed. But they were wise to call it quits when they did, rather than overstaying their welcome. And the first 2 seasons are as good as anything you'll see on network TV, then & now. And here I want to call attention to the little, lyrical details that the camera would linger over -- dew on a spider web, sunlight on flowing water, a spray of leaves & flowers filling most of the frame -- the show not only talked about harmony with Nature, it did its best to evoke it with such tranquil imagery. In fact, it was one of the last shows for intelligent viewers before the flood of mindless 1970s TV came in. Thankfully it's available on DVD now, and well worth adding to your home library -- most highly recommended!",1470009600,3,3145,4.800738007380073

Mr. Carradine's acting was pinned down by silly stories and badly written scripts.  While the show was groundbreaking in its day, it's just too painful to try and watch in a modern era.",1467244800,,417,4.594594594594595

Jeff, you have just lost the values that have made your company such a success.  Didn't you grow up in a middle class neighborhood in a ""development"" low ranch house where all the houses are the same ?  Jeff , you are changing from the most customer centric company to the most customer concentric company as we speak.  Now you have put on the big monopolistic squeeze,  just like a boa constrictor.  I have been a prime customer for several years now but this year I couldn't renew because I'm trying to save my teeth and dental bills seem worse than doctor bills now. I have noticed your Prime Only policy popping up elsewhere recently too.  Didn't you grow up middle class ?  THERE IS NO MORE MIDDLE CLASS - SO YOUR BIG SQUEEZE IS UPON ALL THE PEOPLE WHOSE SALARYS HAVEN'T INCREASED IN 30 YEARS AND THE GROWING POOR AND THE GROWING RANKS OF BOOMER RETIREES.

The Kung Fu TV series is racist because the lead was suppose to be played by famous martial artists, Bruce Lee. He was denied to play this part because Westerners said he was too Asian looking and he was not a bankable  At the the time, Westerners did not want to gamble their money on people who looked or was foreign. The 1970s was a racists period for minorities on TV.  I am so glad times are changing because as of 2015, the first Chinese-American TV sitcom, Fresh off the Boat, with Randall Park and Hudson Yang are making a difference in Chinese- American culture.",1466294400,,737,4.364963503649635

A right way.  A wrong way.  What will you do?

I'm not a David Carradine fan.  His lifestyle choices are/were questionable.  But as young grasshopper his character brought the venerable way to life.

Highly recommend to all (ages too). I enjoy looking back at the time machine of film to see some of my memorable favorites.  John Saxon.  Love that he tries.  Funny how Bruce Lee was skipped over for Carradine because he was Asian. Imagine the value of the series if Bruce had been the star!  This is a remake waiting to happen.  Why remake Knight Rider and not Kung Fu?",1465257600,,791,4.25

3228457,5,B000X07TLA,"As one who enjoys westerns, oriental religious philosophy, and martial arts, this series provides all three in each show.  The religious philosophy is particularly Taoist, of which I am not.  But most of the teaching is practical life virtues found also in my conservative Christian faith.  The theology of Taoism does not appear much, so it's interesting but I can ignore it (original Taoism was monotheist and very apophatic; modern Taoism is polytheistic worship of deified dead people/demigods; the theology of the TV series, what little it shows up, is of the modern type).  The martial arts, initially more Judo, but then Wushu, is much more realistic than what we used to watch in choreographed movie scenes (BTW, Kung Fu is not a martial art, but a life philosophy, of which Wushu is the martial art discipline in Shaolin monasteries [Wudang is the primary style in Crouching Tiger].  Kung Fu means ""[hard] work + [much] time,"" which results in great skill in whatever discipline one is dedicated to--music, cooking, brain surgery, or martial arts). What is also interesting is how David Carridine pulled off, at times, a Matrix/Neo effect, moving considerably more slowly than his almost-flailing antagonists (this occurs in ""The Legend Continues"" also).  The third season is somewhat inferior to the first two, though the third has many great episodes; but the third season contains some really weird, unnecessary segments.  These result in some scenes in which the ""special effects"" are obvious, and one even laughable.  Also, in one episode with Jose Feliciano and another musician, while the episode was good and the music was good, the lousy acting of the musicians is a bit irritating.  Because of the complaints in other reviews about bad quality discs and glitches, I watched the entire series over a 2-week period.  No glitches at all.  The quality of every episode was fine.  The DVD's contain several episodes presented with and without commentary (by Carradine), and also some other specials, and apparently three episodes that never aired.  Love it all.",1460592000,14,2075,5.121661721068249

3228464,5,B000X07TLA,"I remembered watching this show when it originally aired but have seen very little of it since.  I did find a copy of the pilot on a home made VHS tape from years gone by and re-watched it.  I still loved it, so I went looking and found the DVD set here.  Got it and in the first 2 days have watched 7 episodes and am heading in to watch a couple more.

I have now finished the entire series in right at 1 month.  Loved it all even though season 3 tended to have more mysticism in it then the first two seasons it was still good.

I noticed that someone had complained about the episodes that had David Carradine commentary over the episode.  This happened to episode 1 of season 2, ""The Well"".  It was a real pain to watch you missed so much of the dialog.  You could still sort of tell what was happening but a lot of the detail was lost.  They also had this episode with the commentary in special features which I figured is where it belonged.  I turns out, I think, I was correct.  There are 2 other episodes where David does commentary over the episode but in both cases it is only that way in the special features.  I suspect when they created the season 2 DVDs somebody messed up and put the commentary version in the episode section as well as in the special features.

My solution I just went to Amazon video and paid $1.99 for that episode digitally and watched it there.  It was worth it to see the episode.",1457568000,7,1418,4.161764705882353

3228604,4,B000X07TLA,"This series came out when I was in college. The Thoreau (albeit ""Eastern"") self-containment philosophy of Caine coupled with his stoicism and martial prowess made him a worthy model for many a pensive young athlete, myself among them. You might find yourself speaking in his soft, halting cadence, and even improving in your capacity for suffering fools and thinking before you acted. In some ways, therefore, this series taught more than any Philosophy 101 course could. The years passed on and the lessons of Kung Fu became part of the collective fabric of one's learning. Now recently it showed up--the whole series--here on Amazon for a good price. So I bought it and watch the episodes as I am working out. The flashbacks back to the Shaolin Temple days are accented by the wonderful work of Philip Ahn and especially Key Luke. Myself Now 62 and with a lot more stuff in my head, I am nevertheless still impressed by the poetry, subtlety, irony, and veracity of the Shaolin Masters lessons and morals. These are consistently the best written script components in each episode. On the other hand, the plots are quite tiresome and informed by leftist loathing of America. Virtually all antagonists are American rednecks who are invariably  xenophobic, unkempt, ignorant, and greedy. They also are part of a meat-eating society that practices a ritualistic Christianity that abets the recurring instances of greed, superstition, intolerance, and stupidity that makes up the repeatedly recycled conflict sources plot in and plot out. So the way I approach it is to suffer the foolishness patiently, ponder the profound messages of the Shaolin Masters, and enjoy this contact with that time in my life when I was lean and solid everywhere like Kwai Chang Caine.",1438473600,,1761,5.030821917808219

3228628,5,B000X07TLA,"I am in Season 2 now working my way through. This brings back good memories of the series. The quality for the most part is excellent for a series which is over 40 years old. Some individual episodes have spots where the quality drops some, but not enough to disappoint me. Again, this is 40 years old and I think the quality is amazing. There appear to be one David Carradine audio commentary per season. It is interesting to see actors such as a young Don Johnson, Victor French, and a number of others you will recognize. The philosophic sayings and musings on the part of Caine and his Shaolin Masters in his flashbacks are one of the things I really enjoyed about it as a kid. Like many 1970s shows it delves into issues that were newly being explored at the time in television, in this case primarily bigotry and racism. The show also explores Caine's mostly pacifist reaction to the violence of the Old West around him and his minimalist living. My only complaint is with the packaging. The boxed set aspect is fine, but the individual discs have episodes on the front AND back so be careful in handling them! Other than that, if you enjoyed this series in younger days and want to own it I would recommend it.",1437350400,,1217,4.461883408071749

From Slim Pickens and Jack Elam to Jodie Foster and Don Johnson, the list of fine actors goes on and on.

3228681,5,B000X07TLA,"It is a must have series.  I have probably watched this series 50 times since I was a kid in some form or fashion.  I just finished going through it again and even though it is period specific it is timeless and so are its messages.

Speaking of messages... many shows cannot pull off being politically and socially active AND entertaining but this was so well written it almost sneaks it past you.

It is not well-suited for young children.  It has sex, death, violence, scary images (like a snake pit) and some of the 70's style of film-making can make scenes scarier than they actually are.  Having said that it was on network TV and subject to stricter censoring than we have today.  I was watching it in my teens though and I have never needed a therapist.  Parental guidance is suggested.

I wish there could have been more.  I have no idea why the second Kung Fu is impossible to find at a reasonable price.

My only knock are the double-sided discs.  I think going the extra step to save a few cents is ridiculous.  I have so few in my overall collection it is obvious no one liked them.",1432944000,2,1095,4.361386138613861

3228705,5,B000X07TLA,"I was a UC Berkeley grad working as a forklift operator during the summer following my graduation, while awaiting to attend graduate school. To decompress from a demanding academic program (a double major in astronomy and applied math) I finally bought a small B/W TV and would watch ""Kung Fu"" weekly. I related to Kwai Chang Caine's strict training as a Shaolin priest and his fumbling yet tenacious experience coming to the United States, fleeing an unfair charge of murder in his native China. I strongly related to his principled approach to life, yet his willingness to use physical violence to counter physical violence.

Some 40 years later, as I re-watch these episodes, I cringe at the stereotypes, the exaggerated racism of 19th century Americans towards all minorities and the same tired plot line (Caine stumbles on something bad, he is confronted by someone as the doer of bad, he is abused and imprisoned, he finally has enough and escapes after giving some miscreant a mouthful of toenails to chew on, and he wanders once again).

Offsetting these drawbacks are the timeless teachings of Master Po to the young Caine: the wisdom expressed is worth the price of the DVD collection. No other TV series then or since has allowed such contemplative moments of a master patiently teaching an acolyte to learn, to question, to examine and finally to accept life lessons that are the underpinnings of a moral, ethical personality.

David Carradine's tragic death and real life persona do not diminish his characterization of Caine. He became Caine and Caine tried to become him but the real world intervened in a nondescript hotel room in Thailand. So, like with Caine, Carradine's death remains a mystery with no real answers.

Yes, there are some technical issues with the DVD and with production values of some of the episodes but these are minor details that do not detract from the value of a DVD collection of TV episodes that for a few short years, shone brightly above the vast sea of moronia that characterized (and still does) the offerings of most episodic productions aimed at a largely indifferent yet greedily consumptive American TV audience.",1432166400,3,2165,4.9559228650137745

3228850,5,B000X07TLA,"This is an awesome set that includes the pilot movie, and every episode of the original TV series. There are a few added short documentaries, such as how the series was originally created, and why Bruce Lee was not chosen as the lead actor, and some interesting stories about David Carradine. Perhaps the best is that the TV episodes look great. It is better than when they were first presented on TV. As a long-time fan of Kung Fu since childhood, seeing the entire series conveniently together in one affordable boxed set is wonderful. I bought this set for $32.96 when Amazon had it on a short sale. At that price, it is about $10 per season, and a way wonderful bargain for any fan!!!",1411776000,2,688,4.512

There are three DVD books that come in the cover that is shown. Each of those have a nice cover as well. Very nice, very pretty. The whole package is very pretty and not cheap in any way. When you open the books there are screen shots and episode descriptions and securely placed discs for each of the three seasons. All very attractive, as I said.
They play perfectly. The only issue I had is that I could not hear the voices. I became very sad. Then I changed the audio setting on the TV.  It was perfect again.

3228879,2,B000X07TLA,"I loved this TV series when it first aired in the 1970's and was looking forward to watching it again (today). I watched the pilot and the first 3 episodes and it just didn't hold up for me. I (still) enjoy the flashbacks and the philosophy, however I just can't take all the drunk, stupid and racist men that are continually featured in the stories...I find it extremely boring and predictable. Also, the fake skull caps (for all the bald monks) are so darn obvious to me now, as are all of the stunt doubles during the fight scenes. And lastly, David Carradine, though his character Kwai Chang is a child of both American and Chinese parents, does not look Chinese, so why does he continually get referred to as ""Chinaman"" by people who see him for the first time? It doesn't make any sense to me...I guess I was able to suspend my disbelief when I was watching this in the 70's but it just looks plain silly to me now.",1410048000,,921,4.3604651162790695

I ordered a new item.  I received what looked like a used item in excellent condition.  I decided to keep it and watch one episode a day.  As I went through the set I cleaned the fingerprints off the discs, inspected the small scratches, and  enjoyed each episode.  When I got to Season 3, Disc 1, Side 2, it was heavily scratched and appeared to have had a chemical applied to it.  It played with skips and freezes.  I decided to return the item because this situation was unacceptable.  No, I can't.  I was past the return time by two days.  Moral of the story, some of those affiliated with Amazon will sell you used excellent as new.  This is dishonest.  If you do not get exactly what you ordered do not settle.

The initiation into manhood that the character Caine had to endure to become a man involved pain to both his arms, indicating that when a boy becomes a man something has to die and thats his boy psychology. This is food for thought and worth reflecting upon, because there are too many adults living life today still dealing in child psychology.

When my friend opened it, it was indeed sealed and marketed as ""new in package"" but there were fingerprints all over the CD's and one disc has a smear or scratch along half the disc. One other disc has what looks like heat damage and never should've come off the QA production line. I feel like I should've just paid the extra couple dollars and chosen another shipper.

3229035,2,B000X07TLA,"Kung Fu is my favorite television show of all time, so if you are looking for a new series to watch, I highly recommend.  A peaceful man, traveling in a new land, with his roots in Buddhist philosophy, and strength of character.  The Kung Fu fighting scenes are poor, compared to today's action movies, but at the time, it was a groundbreaking show, and many people did not even know what Wu Shu/Kung Fu was.

The discs are horrible.  They frequently lock up my player, in the middle of the episode.  I have kept them in the original boxes, and sometime wash them gently with mild soap and water, followed by immediate drying.  This helps only a little, and the episode will still lock up, same place, maybe just a bit further along.  This is an issue with every disc.

Hoping that this show comes out on Blu-Ray!  I think the disc quality would be much better with more modern press equipment.  For now, I would say, just watch the episodes on YouTube, and don't purchase these.",1379548800,4,979,4.480225988700565
3229036,5,B000X07TLA,Just exactly what was promised the full series with lots of extras to add depth to the understanding of the show and the times when it was made. I especially admire the respectful way in which the producers refer to Phillip Ahn (Master Kahn) and Keye Luke (Master Po)....this package is well worth the investment of money to purchase and the time to watch it. I am watching it with my children and grandchildren explaining the deeper meaning of the Taoist and Buddhist philosophies.,1378425600,,482,4.75
3229037,2,B000X07TLA,"When Kung Fu came out in 1972, you couldn't tear me away from it.  When I saw this listing on Amazon, I just hadta have it.  The quality of the video is almost HD quality, the audio as expected is circa early 70's.  The labeling says dolby digital, my ears say original soundtrack, mostly center channel with the sub-woofer kicking in but with little discernible bass.  The menu configuration is well thought out and easy to navigate.

The downside?  warner brothers.  They have the nasty habit of double-siding discs.  Three seasons on 11 dvd's, not 22, which means if you have a multi-disc changer such as a carousel, you have to copy at least 11 sides.  It's rather comical, that every disc opens with the typical piracy notice, FBI, prison, fine, etc., then they force you into a situation that you have to ignore their commandments.
All in all, this production has a 5 star capacity, yet due to warner brothers, two stars is it.",1377907200,4,933,4.606060606060606

we should all be grateful for the writers and visionaries of the last decades. we should all take the time to watch and learn from carridine, and what it means to be kung fu.",1377475200,,689,4.647540983606557

For the most part this series has stood the test of time... somewhat...  The first season by far was the best from start to finish, things tended to drift downward in the 2nd.  The third season had some bright moments, but overall you could tell David was getting tired of playing the part.  Also I found the quality of the first season DVDs to be much better.  It looks like those were restored vs not touching the later seasons.  Thus my drop of 1 star.

Looking back now as an adult, the topic of prejudice and being an outcast loomed large.  A young person could learn a lot about how to treat their fellow man regardless of the color of his skin or shape of their eye!

The special features were really neat in particular the last DVD containing Davids trip to the Monastery. Of course the quotes are memorable.  There are some great life quotes one can use to move them to a better life.

I was in Junior high when this series came out, so it was perfect for me at this age and time with my interest in Bruce Lee (who was a candidate for the role of Caine) and also finding my way in the world.  A great mixture of action and philosophy.  The strangest western ever on TV up to that time and probably ever.  The stories, directing and acting are all exceptional.

The bonus material was well worth it-as it gives insight into the creation of the show-and other tid-bits of information. Sadly, one can see how the writing of the show gradually became poor. Season One is outstanding. Season Two, somewhat mediocre-and Season Three-well-it was hard to watch. It became obvious to me that the show would not have survived a Season Four.

The show has an enchanting balance of mystic philosophy combined with action sequences and episodic plots, overlaid by the sub-plots of Caine escaping from the Chinese law and his search for his half-brother. Acting and scripts are strong, and there is a gentleness to the show which exercises the gray matter more than the louder, in your face type productions of more recent times. The slow motion effects on the fight scenes help to reduce the impact of the violence, much of which is understated anyway and is implied off-camera. I recall enjoyng the show as a youngster, and can do so again now with my sons.

Now that I have the complete series, I am able to recall how good the episodes were.  I had always admired David Carradine for taking on such a heroic role.  Here he is, an admirable man of peace, with not a bone of animosity towards anyone, travelng through the Wild West with many of its untamed and roughshod characters.  With his excellence of traning as a Shaolin priest, Caine knows well how to defend himself, always speaks the truth, remains consistent in his humble character, offers bits of remarkable wisdom along the way, and helps so very many people through his journeys.  Because he is half-Chinese, he inevitably gets ""picked on"" by the dregs and haters of society, wherever he seems to go, yet his presence is effective in improving someone's understanding of life, or their situation.  This series plays beautifully, with superb visual and audio clarity.  I picked the Kung Fu series to buy, as a present to myself, and I could not have chosen a better gift.  I am sure I will go through the DVD's several times over the years.  In these days when there is so much violence in the world, the character of Caine stands out as a breath of fresh air, demonstrating that there is a better choice than violence for any of us to make.",1351900800,32,1363,4.576131687242798

I could not, in good faith, place again an order for this title again from any source because the manufacturer would probably be the same.

Because of the likeliness of damage even with a new batch, I will not be ordering this title, even though I loved the TV series when it was aired.

Watching the entire three-season series recently, we found that its beauty and mastery continue to be both moving and instructive.  Do not expect 2009 special effects or scripts but do expect fine photography of meaningful stories dealing with racism, bigotry, mental illness, vengeance, oppression and such.  David Carradine is perfect as Kwai Chang Caine, a half-Chinese, half-American who was raised in a monastery in China.  The setting in the wild West of the U.S. includes flashbacks to his training by the monks.  The training emphasized compassion and nonviolence, yet included the Kung Fu which Caine uses when needed in his ""tough love"" approach.

3229111,5,B000X07TLA,"If any TV series needs to be remade, it's Kung Fu.

Not because the original isn't excellent. It is. But because current America needs the messages in this show.

I love the ""subversive"" teachings in this show. The classic Western is cowboys ""solving"" a problem with their guns and fists. It was the mythos of 1950s: the John Wayne type. These historical roots go deep for us Americans. The early English settlers saw the wild land and its indigenous people as dark and threatening, something to be defeated. (Extreme example: the plunderering, murderous Spanish Conquistadores.)

Then you have Kung Fu in the 1970s showing us how shallow is the ""brute force control"" approach to life. (God bless those flower children, and forgive their drug addictions.)

The character Kwai Chang Caine is a Shaolin monk, which comes from the Chinese Chan Buddhist tradition. Chan is the equivalent of Japanese Zen, which I know a little about. Zen teaches living in the present, which is really the only time you can live in. Also, letting go of anger, hatred, prejudices, regrets of the past, fears for the future, cravings for yet more stuff. We Westerners on our treadmill of materialism, ""success,"" and ""control"" could find a lot of peace from these kinds of teachings.

Buddhist style meditation, for example, has been shown to reduce stress, anxiety and depression, and also to foster compassion. There are many science-based books on this topic, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mindfulness-An-Eight-Week-Plan-for-Finding-Peace-in-a-Frantic-World/dp/1609611985/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mindfulness: An Eight-Week Plan for Finding Peace in a Frantic World</a>&nbsp;by Dr. Mark Williams at Oxford.

Buddhism, in its essential form, isn't a religion so much as a program of personal self-help. It's about accepting your reality (whatever that may be) and finding peace. Anyone can use Buddhist tools whatever their religious belief system. I'm a Christian personally, but Buddhist ideas have helped me a lot in my life. They actually help me become a better Christian.",1330387200,,2110,5.578125

I have not got around to watching the balance of seasons 2 and 3 due to the Christmas Season and time is precious. Anyway, I rate it 4 out of 5 due to the technical difficulties of the first CD, but I enjoy the serious so much and very grateful that you are able to offer the series for purchase that I cannot really complain.  The series takes me back to a peaceful time, a time that I long for again.  Plus I love David Carradine!  (I will need to order his musical CDs next.)

3229138,5,B000X07TLA,"Kung Fu was my favorite tv show many years ago when it was first released, i was very pleasantly surprised when watching the complete series collection that it hadn't lost any of its appeal after all those years - what an awesome show! Grasshopper gets picked on every show by losers and he always kicks arse and comes through with flying colors.  My family reckon i've gone all philosophical but i can't help it after all those mind-boggling flashbacks.
Quality of the dvd's is 10/10.  All in all its the best thing i've purchased for a very long time.",1290470400,3,553,4.575757575757576

3229140,5,B000X07TLA,"I can not find words strong enough to support this great TV series. It is a must see.  We gladly bought the three season package to share the experience with my two daughters, making a family summer of revisiting the series. The praise found in the reviews here speaks for the quality of the show. The quality of the DVD set, well that's a little frustrating. Here are the three big things you need to know about the collection, from big to huge:

BIG: Errors in old TV shows framing: Back then 480 resolution was all they had to deal with, now transfered to 1080p with modern black levels, shows this old often reveal things that were hidden from the audience when they first aired. Occasionally you see a powerline, or notice from cut-to-cut that the daylight was WAY lower earlier in the scene than later.  All this can be corrected with relatively cheap CGI efforts, but no such effort was made on this collection.

BIGGER: No film restoration. In some cases the color correction is really bad, faded film, hairs in the transfer gate, spots and flickers that would have been treated and returned to original print quality in a more porperly restored version of the series are just left as is. You get the feeling they spun old prints through a transfer chamber and called it a day. Lazy work.

HUGE: Way back when Kung Fu was cancelled some lame brains at the network decided to air the last six shows out of order to capitalize on sweeps ratings, making the six story arc ending of the series occur with the last three preceding the first three. An easy fix, the DVD makers could have put the shows in the correct story order and list the air-dates on the insert material. They didn't, however, simpley following the air order instead of the intended story order. GOOD GRIEF.  Fortunately, this can be fixed. When you get to the very last DVD of the series, watch the B-side first, then the A-side last, and you get the correct story arc. It is worth the effort to do this!!!!!!!

Sad about the lazy DVD work, but -- if this is how you have to get such a great show, the flaws are not bad enough that you should pass up the opportunity!",1282262400,168,2141,4.460358056265985

3229143,5,B000X07TLA,"I have just completed the entire three season series, including commentary tracks and special features.  If you have any memories of this series, this is a wonderfully priced addition to your tv catalog; if you have heard of the series and want to check it out, this is still a great buy, because once you go through the first season you will want to finish the journey.  I remember watching the show in the 70s, but because it has been syndicated so little (unlike say Star Trek), I really did not remember specific episodes, but only recalled the basic structure of the show.  And that has been well described by other reviewers.

As to the series itself, in my humble opinion season one is good, with the show finding its legs.  Season two is far and away the strongest, with important themes coursing through nearly every episode.  Season three suffered from what other reviewers have pointed out was an increasing reliance on mystical/magical themes.  Less commented on has been some of the really rough acting found in season three, including Barbara Hershey (Seagull) in a critical two parter directed by Caradine himself.  His girlfriend at the time (and based on some later commentary the relationship may have been winding down even while they were filming) does not do a very good job in a critical role.  And in the last four episodes which wind up the series, the Barrimore playing the son of Danny Caine really doesn't do a very good job in the role. These acting problems were nowhere in evidence in the second season.  In addition, in season three the series moved away from the basic structure of the show, with its connected flashbacks tracking with the old west action.  It's my belief that these changes/problems accelerated after Caradine announced it was all over, and they rushed their way to a series finale, which is beautiful, by the way, with Caradine using his last dance move to gracefully exit the stage.

To summarize: if you have any interest in this ground breaking series, you won't be disappointed.  And if you have interest in it, you are really going to want to see the whole thing.  Trust me.",1279238400,5,2130,4.737127371273712
3229144,5,B000X07TLA,"As one person has already said, there are other excellent reviews, and I'll just add my voice to theirs. So read those. The negatives may be true, but for the most part, if your memory is from watching these some 30 years ago, you'll be astounded at how good they actually look. The fact is, they look better now, on our new wide-screen digital tv's, than they ever looked on tv when when were originally released. The complaints about ""snow"" are mostly true only for the opening sequence---actual shows rarely have much.  I also bought mine at a hefty discount, and it was worth every penny.

So if you got to this Kung Fu page because you were considering buying it---just do it. The cons are minor (if you even notice them), the pros major.

I'll add one more thing: the show has staying power, even for new audiences. My wife originally castigated me for buying this---now after watching the first year---she wants to buy sets to send to her family! And she pinches pennies til Lincoln screams.",1276992000,15,998,4.595505617977528

This complete series added many hours of enjoyment for me and my family and my grand kids.  NOTHING MORE NEED BE SAID ABOUT THE TV SERIES. That being said it also had a great discourse on how and why the series became a reality.  It told those who were originally chosen for the lead and why Carradine was chosen for the lead.  It also explained why the series ended when it did on top of the pile,  Carradine just said ""that's enough"" and walked off the set in the middle of the filming and while the show was at the top of the ratings.  Also Carradine was never sued for his breach of contract.  Buy this set and buy another for a friend or friends you love and learn more.",1276473600,4,929,4.2988505747126435

We believe that she is still too young to understand the constant denigration of non caucasian people in the series. We will wait that she is able to understand that the series emphasizes on racial issues and when she will be more able to appreciate the other values of the story, respect, discipline, etc.",1275350400,2,543,4.666666666666667

There are breaks in the play where a commercial should have been...but I love no commercials...I can live with the momentary interruption of content. Picture is clean and clear, sound is very good. You've got to consider the original was quite awhile ago. I think they did a pretty good job. On two occasions, I encountered a slight freeze of the play back. I can't account for that. The discs appear to be very clean. The only thought I would have is either a mechanical or software issue. Not really a bother, just requires some investigation on my part. I rate it five stars, more than happy with the purchase. Sorry, I haven't reviewed any of the ""extras"" yet.",1274227200,4,861,4.5256410256410255
3229148,4,B000X07TLA,"I may be a bit atypical for my generation, I grew up mostly withOUT TV.  So I only saw 3-5 Kung Fu episodes at the neighbors house as a teenager when this series first aired.  It made a mysterious and strangely indelible impression on me -- one I've intermittently recalled over the last several decades.  Occasionally elements reminescent of Kung Fu and his training monastery have shown up in my dreams --prompting me to wonder about the series again.  Thus, I've wished to see a few of the episodes again to understand why.

Perhaps they've been reshown on TV in the interim, but if so, I missed that too.  After news of the untimely loss of David Carradine last year, I turned to Amazon to look for DVDs of the series.  I found this 3-volume set and have been very pleased with sound and image quality -- now having gone through over half of them.

I don't know that my more extensive questions about David Carradine, Taoism or Kung Fu have been answered -- or ever will be.  But this quiet, unhurried, travelling monk who chooses to honor the mysteries of life on a meandering path, to work, and when possible avoid unneeded power, wealth, and violence -- these principles still capture my attention.

I seemed to have missed the critical window for developing much of a screen viewing habit, either for TV or movies.  Yet this is one series I've actually been willing to set aside time to sit down and enjoy.

As an adult, I now appreciate learning more of what went into development of the episodes including input from the chinese community.  At first I thought the arrogance and intolerance of the Wild West was a bit overdone, an exaggerated  characturization.  However, about the same time as this series arrived I began reading _<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Needles-Herbs-Gods-and-Ghosts-China-Healing-and-the-West-to-1848/dp/0674023978/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Needles, Herbs, Gods, and Ghosts: China, Healing, and the West to 1848</a>(reviewed elsewhere).  From a completely different perspective, this book documents pretty good evidence to support believing that early encounters of West meets East led to rather challenging confrontations -- symbolically, ideologically, and not too hard a stretch for physically, too.",1269648000,4,2278,5.286111111111111

3229156,5,B000X07TLA,"Like a lot of other reviewers, I was a fan of this series when it first aired. I'm often disappointed when re-viewing something I thought was great in my youth--perhaps my standards are higher now, or perhaps I've just become more of a curmudgeon in my old age--but to my surprise and delight this series really holds up. Sure, it's hokey and a little preachy (a little?) but even as a naive teenager ready to believe anything I knew that. If you look past the camp, and the early seventies sensibility, you find a core of simple stories that remind you of many of the central truths about the nature of life, love, evil, and nature herself that you may have forgotten along the way. It's also just darn good TV for its vintage, both in terms of writing and production value, and every episode has the obligatory fight scene so you don't get too bored. Nothing lifts your spirits like  watching a skinny vegetarian pacifist tree-hugger kick the crud out of a bunch of blow-hards!

Oh yeah, this does have the pilot episode (I had some doubt about that initially) and the packaging is fine, if a little excessive. (I wish they'd start selling DVDs in simple envelopes so they don't take up so much shelf space, but it will probably never happen.) My only complaint is that the individual DVDs are labeled by season but not disc number, so it's kind of a pain to keep them straight if someone (a-hem) forgets to put one away.",1259539200,2,1423,4.511627906976744

3229161,5,B000X07TLA,"I'm a blackbelt in Kung Fu.  There were two things that motivated me to eventually take up martial arts.  A novel I'd read when I was about 12 that revolved around the main character taking Judo, and this show, which I watched when I was about 15.  Eventually when I was in my 20's, I took up Kung Fu.  Now my kids are taking martial arts (one is getting ready for her black belt test).  I was surfing the web recently and came across this set of DVD's.  I've read some of the othe reviews on this set and how some of them were dissapointed with the quality of the video.  I don't know what they were watching, but it doesn't appear that what I recieved and what they watched could be the same thing.  The quality is way better than what I remeber as the original TV show.  The video is very brilliant.  The colors are vivid.  The sound is acceptable (I'm sure the original was in mono).  We're about done with the first season.  Now when the kids ask what we are going to watch together on a Friday night, I just start whistling the theme song and they get all excited.",1254960000,4,1070,4.186274509803922
3229162,4,B000X07TLA,"I have been (re)enjoying this series that I enjoyed so much as a teenager.  The series starts with the original pilot movie which is essential to be able to understand the rest of the series. (Otherwise you just get bits and pieces thrown at you about where Caine came from and why).

It comes nicely packaged in a box and each season is in a foldout with 4 DVDs in its own box within the bigger one.  They are nicely illustrated.  The amazing thing to watch is how season#1 differed from season #2 which in turn differed from saeson #3.  In the first season, both Caine as well as the story line and characters are naive and over simplified.  But, that progresses through season #2 into the 3rd season to where both Caine as well as the stories and characters are much more sophisticated.  Unfortuantly, much of the teaching drops away as Caine becomes more adept at managing the situations that he finds himself in.

The DVDs also have a few special features -- such as Carradine having dinner with people who appeared in the series over the years while they reminisced.  I can't say that I enjoyed watching them, but I did learn a number of things about the series:  Did you know that the ""rice paper"" was actually butcher paper because they couldn't find a roll of rice paper -- and, that you couldn't tear it if you tried -- and they did!

My only ocomplaint is that the sound quality is very marginal -- almost poor. I run the sound through my Yamaha amp and tower speakers and, in order to hear it I have to have the volume turned up to 3/4s which would typically have the windows rattling.  In addition, the left channel keeps cutting out.  But, once you get past all that stuff, the audio is at least clear and understandable.

I highly recommend this package.",1254960000,10,1769,4.453416149068323

Well, In all honesty, this series was MUCH cooler when I was 12.  After a few episodes I put it away and will be selling the series in the ""used"" section soon.  The pacing is slow and awkward at times and the dialogue and situations are extremely cheesy most of the time.  The fight scenes are laughable and pretty much unwatchable by today's standards.  It made me really respect how devoted today's actors are when training for a role.  David Carradine appears to know about as much Kung Fu as my Grandmother.  And, he's about as athletic as her too.  (At least in this role, I seem to remember him doing an okay job in Kill Bill[s]).

Anyway, I wish I had gone over to my friends to re-watch an episode prior to buying the set for myself.  Times change, we change, and this includes our taste and standards.  Things from our childhood aren't always as cool as we remember them.  It's a bummer, but, it turns out this show is actually kind of lame.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 was that there is some value in this series for families.  Kids aged 8-12 might enjoy this show and it's probably a better option than what's on TV today.

The disks play pretty well, but periodically an entire chapter will be skipped.

It has been complained that only the first season is letter-boxed.  Don't people know that all you have to do is to change the format on your TV is by pressing a button in order to change this to any format you like?
The episodes are faithful to the original broadcasts in that occasionally you will see a small flaw left over from the film, like a tiny spot of dirt within the picture momentarily, etc., really nothing to be concerned about at all.
If you want anything to complain about, and it is rather minor but enough to keep it from getting 5 stars, it would be that the DVD's are double sided, which makes it trickier to figure out what disc and side you are looking for, they were recorded in the aired sequence rather than the order of production, and that they come in a folded cardboard type packaging which puts each season in a fold-out container, which is not the easiest to handle.

IT IS ENTERTAINING AND CARRIES WITH IT SOME VERY HIGH PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS. IN MY OPINION, THE PICTURE QUALITY WAS JUST AS IT WAS WHEN IT WAS SHOWN ON TELEVISION. THE RESTORATION FROM FILM TO DVD WAS DONE WELL. I'M GLAD THAT I BOUGHT IT. THIS IS GOOD TELEVISION. YES, KWAI CHANG CAINE (GRASSHOPPER) LIVES ON!!",1251244800,,465,4.614457831325301
3229176,5,B000X07TLA,"The ""Kung Fu"" series [starring ""Grasshopper"" David Carradine and many other good folks] is one of the few TV shows I have always liked. I have mostly given-up on most recent TV -- due to the lack of long-running quality shows such as ""Kung Fu"". One great exception is the fairly recent ""Andromeda"" series -- which also combines action adventure with a strong ethic guiding the heros, led by their starship captain, in restoring law-and-order civilization during a galactic dark age. There is some quite good martial arts action and a little deep philosophy in that fine show. But, in contrast, ""Kung Fu"" has only one lonely hero versus first Imperial China and later Wild West America. This ex-Shaolin Monk half-breed wanderer must survive in an alien and violent setting [especially for him] -- The Old Wild West. Yet, he follows his Shaolin ethics while using his Shaolin Kung Fu indirectly, and directly as he must, to survive and help others.

When I was quite young, I would try to watch every episode of ""Kung Fu"" -- catching every run and rerun that I could find via TV. I was very inspired by ""Kung Fu"". I continued to watch all of it I could -- even after starting my own study of The Art-and-Way via ""Kenpo Jiu-Jitsu"" -- a distant offspring of Shaolin Kung Fu. Jeet Kune Do and Bruce Lee are technically as great as can be -- and well worth carefully studying -- but I have been more personally inspired by ""Kung Fu"" and ""Grasshopper"" David Carradine. Oddly, Bruce Lee was hoping to star in ""Kung Fu"" -- but for various reasons was turned-down in favor of Carradine -- which is well-and-good cause now we have them both.

Eventually, one of my big concerns was ""whether Carradine really followed The Art-and-Way"". Almost all of the Kung Fu action in ""Kung Fu"" is slowed-way-down -- allowing us to see it well -- but also allowing for David Carradine to be ""micro-directed"" by someone who really knew The Art-and-Way. Well, Carradine started slowly to get involved in The Art-and-Way -- via his Tai Chi Praying Mantis ""micro-director"" -- and later was fully into Tai Chi Praying Mantis and The Art-and-Way. So, I recall, with some amused chagrin nowadays, me later ""wondering about who tossed-together those Tai Chi and Praying Mantis moves with some odd Jiujitsu, in slow-motion, to fool us"". Now, I realize it is some pretty good Tai Chi Praying Mantis -- with some associated Chin Na grappling and some other moves. The interesting much newer sci-fi-action [space opera western] ""Firefy"" series has a similar odd blend of China-and-America and a fair amount of Kung Fu -- well, really a hybrid of Ballet, Savate Kickboxing and Kung Fu.

The ""Kung Fu"" series is quite un-dated, very viewable and inspiring even now -- the plots, scenes, action and characters are as excellent as ever. It is still a singular creative pioneering show -- well worth the cost to get the whole series in this big box-set. ""When you can remove this DVD from my hand, Grasshopper, you will not be able to stop taking the rest one-by-one"". With no regret -- Go-with-the-Flow +++",1250726400,,3065,4.74671669793621

3229180,5,B000X07TLA,"I have studied the Tao for many years; translated Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching; and worked professionally on books about the I Ching by Carol Anthony (as an editor). So watching this television show is fairly overwhelming: I hear myself saying things like, ""Master Kan is reading Lao Tzu's 34th verse"" and ""Master Po is reciting Chapter 11 of the Tao Te Ching!"" and ""Kwai Chang is reading the 25th verse over that grave.""

Perhaps what's most astonishing is that no one ever tried this again after this show ended. That is, teach the Tao via a Hollywood-produced drama in prime time. The quality of this series is remarkably consistent -- it faded only in the latter part of the third year when Carradine had announced he was quitting and forced some hurried and contrived work on the writers and producers so that there might be some sense of closure. But the first two years, and much of the early part of the third, are just extraordinary across the board -- writing, production, direction, acting, and above all, the message of peace, humility, and gentle humor. Thorpe, the producer, once mentioned in an interview all the letters he got from teachers praising the show, and read one in particular from a teacher at a school for troubled boys who thanked him and Carradine for proving to his kids that you can be a man without having a gun.

The series best shows its Tao in its humor. A representative scene is when young Caine finally achieves the goal of walking across the rice paper without leaving a trace; his first act after that is to sneak up on Master Po and surprise him. The entire scene is done in silence until, just as Caine is about to spring upon the old blind man, Keye Luke smiles and says, ""Good afternoon, Grasshopper."" Carradine (a very skillful actor, particularly with his body) gracefully deflates behind his master. A lovely, funny moment featuring two superb actors.

By the second season the writers were running out of steam and by the third season they were running on momentum. David Carredine's acting is strong through out the series but the supporting guest actors got pretty weak for the most part by the third season.

I hesitated buying it when I read some of the reviews saying quality of recording sucked-I'm very happy I did. Quality is great, story lines are great, it has really held up over time.

I watched Kung Fu as a kid and loved both the martial arts and philosophy of the show.  As an adult, I was afraid it would be pretty cheesy, as some other series have turned out after a number of years (Wild, Wild West was one of them).

This series is very well done, I am so glad I bought it. Most of the episodes I haven't seen or don't remember. The kung fu is mild by todays standards; but that is part of what makes it so tasteful and exceptional in my humble estimation. David Carradine is truly excellent in this role; but all the other supporting actors and actreses, incluiding children by the way, are so professional....as fine a screeen or stage character actors as you are likely to ever see. Makes you realize how TV is such garbage anymore...they could not or would not create and produce such a quality program today, it just wouldn't happen. Kudos to Jerry Thorpe. I find his directed episodes to be the most authentic and awesome. This is highly recommended if you are a fan of any Chinese Martial Arts, in this case northern Tibetan Black Crane, but also as a statment for its time..this series was far out ahead of anything else and stands up quite well on it's own merit today in 2009.",1246406400,2,1179,4.488372093023256

I have to admit i feel most fortunate to have acquired the set, for years i have been looking forward to the day when i could finally get to see the series again in its entirety. This is the only show of its kind ever. What makes it unique is not the kung fu, but the philosophy. Every episode is encapsulated enlightenment. Each episode is moved by meaning.

Yet the manner which he died leaves me with a bitter taste...why hide in a closet when you could have done that from a streetlamp??

I was hoping for more bonus stuff, but perhaps I'm just spoiled by todays shows on DVD and the stuff they have. The quality is great! Many complained about the cropping for a widescreen look, but I didn't notice it, nor do I really care.

This was waaaay ahead of its time back in 1972... wow.  Like the ill-fated original ""Star Trek,"" this brief series was just too far ahead of its American audiences' abilities to comprehend good writing with mind-challenging storylines, however, in many ways, ""Kung Fu"" exceeds in challenging the viewer as the shows are extremely cathartic and not just challenge one's mind, but also their [i]soul[/i].  Now, don't get me wrong, I am very firm in my beliefs as a born-again Christian, however, this show in a weird way parallels many of the teachings in the Bible and never disrespects anyone's religious views.  That is hard to accomplish, but the producers, writers, directors aided bi David Carradine, masterfully pulled it off alongside Keye Luke, Philip Ahn and Radames Pera,  as well as other guest actors.

The result is an outright masterpiece... my 12 year-old son loves this show as well, so it is not 'too' deep... it is just right.  When I was his age, I remembered seeing this show as it debuted alongside my dad, asking him questions every once in a while primarily about the flashbacks of the teachings as a boy.  The poignancy of those flashbacks even today as man nearing half a decade of precious life on this earth, still remain relevant.

I love this show.  In years to come, I believe ""Kung Fu"" will receive a lot of acclaim it has yet to achieve.  ABC took some chances back in those days... and in my opinion, pushed TV beyond its barriers with shows such as this and ""Mod Squad,"" etc.  Thank God we have these shows forever preserved onto DVD nowadays that we can revisit such treasures... and get away from mind-numbing shows such as ""Dancing With The Stars"" and the like... yuck.  There are so few shows out these days other than ""Lost"" that really make one [i]expand[/i] their mind as ""Kung Fu"" did.

Story: Chinese-American grows up in a temple in China, defends his temple master but becomes a wanted outlaw, escapes to America and wanders trying to find his brother.  Nice philosophy is given as flashbacks in the temple during his journeys.  Music is nice, has a nice melody and is somewhat melancholy, but very enjoyable.

DVD packaging, disks and cases: attractive package, double-sided disks, fold-out, hard-case plastic with those dreaded CENTER PUSH mechanisms that don't let the disks out easy-- you know, the ones that break when pushed, and don't release the disk, and the ones that ALL CONSUMERS dislike and many manufacturers keep making!  Warner-Brothers, are you listening?

DVD transfers: taken from film without any special remastering
Season 1 is widescreen that has cropped images that everyone complains about, seasons 2 and 3 are full screen format.  All season images are not so bad though but there are noticeable spots white / black that occur occasionally due to the transfer from film.  DVDs have English subtitles that is VERY ESSENTIAL for hard of hearing, noisy environments, and children and persons learning English.

DVD Arrangement: good with highlighted episodes in the case and summaries.  DVD menus are also good.  Season 1 has the Warner-Brothers logo AND music that cuts off the last bit of the Kung-Fu music ending.  WB, DON'T DO THAT!! Season 3 lets almost the last bit of music play and fortunately uses a SILENT WB logo as the almost all of the last music is played.

3229217,5,B000X07TLA,"This dvd set was WAY more than I hoped for! It includes fairly recent interviews with David Carradine, the writers and director of the show detailing how Kung Fu was brought to life. Kung Fu was my favorite tv series when it aired in the seventies and I tried to never miss an episode. Now, I can watch them whenever I want! There was not a tv series like this before OR since.",1231200000,,377,4.178082191780822
3229218,4,B000X07TLA,I love this series and this collection is excellent. 4 Stars because they did very little to enhance the video and the background music overrides the dialog at times.,1230508800,5,166,4.758620689655173
3229219,5,B000X07TLA,"David Carradine, ""Grasshopper"" is in the role of his life. He plays a man who has mastered Kung Fu like no one else but has to elude the law for something that he had to do. He also has the wisdom of his masters and the courage of a dozen cobras.
What a performance!! And the guest stars also shine: Harrison Ford, Jodie Foster, William Shatner, just to name a few.
I don't want to get into the story, but I will say that wisdom and fine martial arts scenes save the day.
Hats off to this show and wishing that there would be more like this one.
Every single actor in this three-year series takes his/her role seriously. If you haven't seen this show, you owe it to yourself to get to it or to buy this product. You'll never regret it!!!",1230336000,3,737,4.160839160839161
3229220,5,B000X07TLA,"This is an outstanding series filled with simple lessons within simple stories.

Kung-Fu was for many Americans, their introduction to the Buddhist way of living. While many are drawn to the martial arts sequences, the true gem of each episode is contained in the flashback sequences that present lessons learned by the main character while a monastic novice.

Despite its apparent simplicity, each show is accessible on many levels and is enjoyable simultaneously by all members of your family. This series reminds us that there is time for all things and that there are no ordinary moments in our lives.

If only today's media conglomerates were brave enough to produce such an intelligent, thoughtful and necessary show now...

So I jumped on it and bought it before it disappeared again.  The DVD's are not blue ray but they are wonderfully restored and look very vibrant and clear.  The pilot is on disk 1 and then the disks are both front and back burned with about three episodes on each side, plus some extras on the front side of each disk.  I haven't gone through all of them but what I have seen so far is really good restoration and made very well.  Worth it for us!",1525651200,,587,3.9743589743589745
