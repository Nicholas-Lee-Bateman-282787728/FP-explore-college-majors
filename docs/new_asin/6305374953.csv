I thoroughly enjoy watching this movie, as it is a good blend of action, suspense, and humor!",1139961600,,255,3.9038461538461537
7888224,4,6305374953,"If you like Anime but never watched any ""City Hunter"" Videos, this would be a good one to start with.  It passes itself off as an action flick at first, but its way more comical, with wacky slapstick humor between Joe and his female sidekick.  Joe is quite possibly the funniest heroes I've ever seen, and some of the things he does in the film are so brash, they're hilarious!
Essesntially the story is about Joe and his friends trying to stop a madman called The Professor from blowing up Tokyo, but the more memorable parts of the film involve Joe and women...they're too funny to mention without actually spoinilg the best parts of the movie.  The action sequences aren't that great, although the climax is kinda cool...If you're a woman though, since a lot of the humor involve Joe's womanizing perverted ways, you may not think it's funny at all.",1018224000,,852,4.629139072847682
7888225,4,6305374953,"The characters' names were changed in the English series, which is annoying to some purists, but other than that, City Hunter is a good movie. Surprisingly, the dub is great, save for the scratchy voice of Kaori. Ryo, who is City Hunter, was renamed Joe. His English voice is excellent, but it's hard to surpass that of the original voice actor Akira Kamiya, who played Kenshiro in the Hokuto No Ken (Fist of the North Star) TV Series. Joe himself acts like a demented pervert any time he sees a woman. But when saving lives are involved, he suddenly snaps and becomes serious and dramatic, which is really just odd. The movie full of perverted humor and a bit of mystery, but unfortunately suffers from being a little slow-paced. There is surprisingly little action, but the final fight scene with the Professor almost makes up for everything. The soundtrack is great, but its best song is reserved for this one fight. Definitely see this great movie.",992908800,,952,4.740963855421687
7888226,4,6305374953,"City Hunter the motion picture is a grand example of how to blend both comedy and action. The story centers around a private eye known as Joe, a.k.a City Hunter. Joe is a lecherous, egotistical nut case who never gets  the girl. The only time he is serious is when he has his 357 Magnum out.  Joe has a partner named Kori whom is a plain woman that beats the hell out  of Joe if he looks at another woman, which happens quite often. In this  volume Joe agrees to help a yung dancer find her missing brother. Yet when  her brother turns out to be a notorius assassin known as the Professor only  Joe can protect his client and the rest of Tokyo from the Professor's  sinister plan. This series is very similar to the anime ""Gunsimth  Cats"". The animation is quite good and so is the voice casting. If you  are in the mood for a good laugh and lots of action then this is defenitly  the film you need. Warning most of humor in this series is sophmoric, there  are also some scenes of violence, language and brief nudity. I would say  this is for the 13 and up crowd.",960940800,,1064,4.187192118226601
