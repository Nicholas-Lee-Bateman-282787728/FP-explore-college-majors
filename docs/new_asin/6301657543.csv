341862,4,6301657543,"Buoyed by a good cast, an unusual and inventive script, and some tense and chilling atmospherics, THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON rises above typical B movie status.

A space refab vessel is suddenly without power and heading to crash land on the dark side of the moon.  Out of nowhere comes a space shuttle last heard of back in 1992.  (The movie takes place in 2022).  The shuttle docks on the space station, and the crew of the refab discover a dead body on the shuttle, take it back to their vessel and the horror begins.

The movie has elements of THE EXORCIST, ALIENS and others, but it's unique twist on the correlation between the dark side of the moon and the Bermuda Triangle on earth is a haunting premise.  The fact that their guest is more than just an alien, also enhances the plot.

John Diehl (one of my favorite supporting tough guys), Will Bledsoe, Joe Turkel and Robert Sampson are great, and Camilla More as the stoic Leslie is perfect.

A real find for those who like their horror/sci fi dished up quite differently.",1095120000,,1031,4.475935828877005
341863,3,6301657543,"Dark Side Of The Moon is an enjoyable Sci-fi thriller. It starts like haunted spacecraft story in 2022 when the malfunctioned space station rendezvous with Spacecraft Discovery the crew later find out the fact that it had vanished in Bermuda Triangle in 1992. The spacecraft now thirty years old is eerily intact but there seems to be no living souls around. After the crew encounter the dead body of one of the missing Discovery crew, the story turns like sort of Alien series. Something evil embodies to human body through human contact with the perfect triangle scar mark on the victim's abdomen (and it begets another victim like vampire stories). Suspension heats up when the crew started to suspect each other. Although trying to connect Bermuda triangle mystery with that of dark side of the moon is not so convincing, it will please the fans of Sci-fi movies.",1025568000,5,867,4.864864864864865
341864,5,6301657543,I absolutely love this movie.  I've seen it a few times and hope it comes out on DVD some time.  It's extremely creepy and dark. The link between the dark side of the moon and the bermuda triangle is very clever and makes you wonder.,988848000,2,233,4.155555555555556

7813567,4,6301657543,"Wow, I saw this movie over 15 years ago and I loved it. It instantly became one of my all time favorites. Unfurtunately I lost it in a move. Then was very happy to find it on Amazon...It has never gone to DVD, which is a bummer but if you have a tape player, this one is well worth the time to sit and enjoy

(Spoiler Alert!)

Imagine going to the moon and finding the graveyard of every ship that ever disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle! And where else? Duh the title tells it all. Cheesy but lots of movies have thier title tell the storyline. And this one works in very well. This one has it all...SCI-FI, HORROR and MYSTERY. It does have religious conatations;believers and non-believers. The ending should not come as a surprise to any true SCI-FI/HORROR fan. Never the less it is well worth the time.",1316908800,3,807,4.373333333333333
7813568,2,6301657543,"I know, because I prayed for this movie to end quickly!

Spoiler ALERT! But you - will - thank me, crew mates!

The central plot to this movie is the notion that Ol Yellow Eyes, satan, lurks on the far side of the moon and he's been transporting all those missing ships and aircraft directly from the Bermuda Triangle on Earth to a place on the far side of the moon to build up his strength (how all that junk gives satan added strength is never hinted at).  He is building up his strength to ""take back what is mine"", presumably heaven.

The crew of a maintenance space ship, in the year 2022, is about to dock with a military satellite that needs refueling in orbit over the dark side of the moon.  The movie ignores the fact that the *far* side of the moon is not always dark, but anyway.... as they are about to dock with the satellite, they notice a strange craft approaching them from the moon's surface.  It is a space shuttle that crashed into the Bermuda Triangle 30 years previously!  Now, how the heck did that get there?  And ""guess who"" is on board!

At times, satan appears to be omnipotent - controlling power, air locks, electronics and communications from a distance to thwart the efforts of the humans to escape - and at other times he appears to forget to use his powers, thus allowing the humans to delay the ending of the movie, all for the purpose of setting up the audience so someone dies gruesomely every 10 minutes. and then it gets bad from there on.. the movie borrows freely from other science fictions, but it has very low production values, and often the plot development does not make sense.  Oh, and there is a boob shot.

I suppose people who have not seen many movies will find this one novel. I won't go into the poor script which prevented the actors from actually acting. Too bad we don't have Mystery Science Theater 3000 anymore, this risible movie's only real purpose is to be the butt of jokes.

Now, I know how this kind of review can serve as an attractive nuisance to young people, and some of you will have the urge to watch it just to see how it can be so bad.  Well, I warned you, but I know you cannot resist.  So, pop some corn and invite some friends over, and then get ready to provide your own MST3K commentary to this unintentionally funny sci-fi flick.",1298937600,2,2307,4.359813084112149
7813569,1,6301657543,"In 2022, a disabled repair ship for satellites with nuclear missiles is on a collision course with the dark side of the moon (why these satellites are so far from Earth, and why there are no maps of that dark side are a mystery).  Their ship's curvaceous humanoid computer brain claims all systems are reporting functional (why is the computer set up as a female human sitting in a lounge chair?). With no one answering their maydays, they are surprised when the Space Shuttle Discovery suddenly appears and docks (supposedly, it had been lost in a oceanic crash; ""Oh, we better go explore it, with our machine guns"" - why are machine guns on a repair vessel?).  As they explore Discovery, there are lots of pipes and bullet-stopping walls and steam and... space (the shuttles must have gotten a lot larger).  They really needed those rifles with scopes in such a compact space!

And, of course, there is a mystery, as in what's with the face in the guts and the cat eyes?  You'll see what I mean.

This is the perfect movie for Mystery Science Theater 3000!",1298073600,,1058,4.601063829787234
7813570,5,6301657543,"i enjoyed this movie very much, i do wish that it would be released on dvd, as my copy is about wore out .  it may not be the greatest horror movie or science fiction movie, but it was and is a enjoyable  movie.",1282089600,,211,3.772727272727273
7813571,4,6301657543,"I don't know why The Dark Side of the Moon is still sitting out there without a DVD release when so many putrid films have already crossed over the digital divide.  This undeservedly obscure science fiction B-movie from 1990 packs quite a punch and comes with a plotline that defies the conventions of the drama.  Oh, certainly, there are similarities with Alien and other movies, but this film establishes a solid identity all its own.  And while the film may not excel in any specific area, the sum of all its parts yields an interesting and quite enjoyable cinematic experience.

I love how the film begins by pointing out the fact that flying up in space to maintenance nuclear-armed satellites is considered to be dangerous work.  Gee, d'ya think?  The crew of the space refab ship Spacecore One knows this already, but this time around they never even make it to the satellite's location.  On the way there, their ship suddenly loses all power.  The ship's computer (who happens to be a reasonably hot, long-legged blonde) says all systems are functioning normally despite pretty convincing evidence to the contrary.  Unable to signal for help, it looks like the only real question is whether their air supply will run out before the ship crashes into the dark side of the moon.  Then, lo and behold, a ship appears in the distance - and not just any ship, mind you.  It's the space shuttle Discovery.  Strangely, though, the ship doesn't respond to communications requests, even after docking successfully with the Spacecore, so crew leaders Flynn (Robert Sampson) and Giles (Will Bledsoe) head across and find what amounts to a ghost ship that has somehow taken on significant water damage.  They also find a dead crew member.  As the resident doctor attempts to find out what killed the man, we learn that the Discovery crashed off the Atlantic Coast decades earlier - so what the heck is it doing floating around on the dark side of the moon?

Obviously, something is very wrong here.  Already racing against time to repair their crippled ship, crew members suddenly find themselves in an even more desperate fight for survival onboard the Spacecore - against an unknown enemy.  Already something of a volatile group, mutual suspicion and paranoia mount as individual crew members are killed.  Even though we viewers are given a sense of what is really going on here fairly early on, even we don't always know the identity the evil is hiding behind - and that makes for added suspense as the movie heads down the home stretch.

You won't find any A-list actors here; the special effects are average in quality; the storyline leaves a few plot holes hanging; and the premise of the film is pretty far-fetched - yet there is just something about The Dark Side of the Moon (perhaps its group dynamics) that is satisfying if not impressive.  I can see where it might even induce a moment or two of disquiet in the minds of certain viewers.  All in all, I have to say that this is a little gem in the basket of neglected science fiction films - and it most definitely deserves a DVD release.",1270339200,,3096,4.728119180633147
7813572,5,6301657543,"I love this movie (one of the BEST sci-fi/horror movies that no one has heard of) and had it on VHS before getting rid of all my VHS tapes and my VCR in favor of DVDs.

If you still have a VCR and love sci-fi/horror movies ... this is a GREAT one. If someone makes a half-way good DVD edition of this film I will buy it in a heartbeat.",1133308800,6,335,3.7857142857142856
