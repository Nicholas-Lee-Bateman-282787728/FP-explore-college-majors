8190762,4,B000PDZIWC,"This is a nice DVD that shows Rachel Ray in her earlier days making some meals.  It's just like her tv program.  She makes one complete meal thru the course of the program.  I bought it because I thought she was demonstrating the ""Fasta Pasta"" pasta microwave container.  It wasn't that at all.  So don't confuse it with the other product sold under the same name...which is an excellent product in its own right.  I will keep the DVD because it is a nice demo of a meal plan for entertaining or just serving your family and friends.  I liked it alot, but was disappointed it didn't show her using the Fasta Pasta pasta maker.",1278979200,,626,4.391304347826087
8190763,3,B000PDZIWC,"I have been anxious about learning how to cook faster because of my busy schedule.  I heard a lot about Rachel's tapes and bought 3 or 4.  After reviewing them I really didn't learn anything new.  The meals weren't that interesting  but it was nice to finally see what her show was about.  Maybe if I tuned in more I would get something productive from the tapes/show.  I won't buy another cooking video but I will keep looking for a book to meet my needs.  So overall I guess it was okay... nothing to jump for joy about.

SIDEBAR: The Fasta Pasta Microwave Container was GREAT!! It became our life saver.  Now that item is worth singing about.  Include it with your quick microwave cooking arsenal and you are set.  GREAT INVENTION.",1222992000,4,734,4.484848484848484
