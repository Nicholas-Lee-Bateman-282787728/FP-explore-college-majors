That is pretty much it. Some unlikeable main characters. Lack of decent dialogue and characters made this a snoozer. Difficult to sit through with so much lack of action.

6228738,1,B00HV6AI6W,"This is the most boring film I ever watched, I almost fell asleep not even half way through the movie.  My biggest complaint is the cover art shows more of the creature than the film does.  The creature doesn't even have five minutes of air time and the ""star"" of the movie, James Duval, has maybe ten minutes on film.  Why give an actor top billing when he doesn't even get 10 minutes on film?!?
The entire overseas army segment could have been left out of the movie.  The only purpose it served was to lengthened the movie, which would have been more merciful if the movie was shorter (less boredom).  Amazon should have a no star rating just for this one.
This next statement may contain SPOILERS.  Supposedly the townspeople could not leave the town, yet two of them joined the military and left overseas.  Granted, they did return, but how and why did they leave? There was not a military draft, so the two men joined voluntarily and left the town.  The entire movie was a waste of time.  Unless you have no need for your time or money, I would not even rent this one.
The movie is from Origins Releasing and I have watched other movies from them and found them entertaining.  Granted they are not going to win any Oscars, but they are worth watching, especially Supercollider and Vampyre Nation.",1401494400,2,1301,4.497872340425532
6228739,1,B00HV6AI6W,Cheesy film. I got more out of the cover than I did the flick. I couldn't hardly see the creature(s) or get a good look at it. To me a boreing film... I would rent instead of buying a copy of this.,1400025600,2,197,3.7142857142857144
6228740,5,B00HV6AI6W,"I wasn't a fan of the directors previous efforts but this film was a pleasant surprise. A good old fashioned creature feature that harks back to the Corman days. James Duval was the real and only interest I had in the flick before I purchased it. If you are a fellow Duval fan, he doesn't have the largest role. But he's got enough screenplay to make for a blind buy. It's better then most low budget creature films. Even Slagle himself has matured as an actor. Same goes for actress D. Pinn who surprised me. Hopefully a prequel focusing more on the ""solider's story"" so to speak (don't want to spoil much) would be great.",1398211200,12,623,4.426086956521739
6228741,4,B00HV6AI6W,"Old school monster film (with a lot of action) that relies more on story and practical effects than CGI.  Manages to build a lot of suspense rather than cheap jump and gore scares. Sometimes the middling budget shines through but for the most part this surprised me.  Decent acting and premise about a monster that returns every few years to feed until a town sacrifices one of its own, which reminds me of a few cryptozoological stories, notably Ogopogo.",1397952000,16,455,4.746835443037975
6228742,1,B00HV6AI6W,This is one of the worst movies I've seen. I admit I was swayed to purchase by the cover and my love of horror/sci-fi. You never really see the creature except for a blurry photo and extremely dark attack scenes. The plot makes absolutely no sense and the story is very weak. I'm willing to give the actors a pass due to the lack of a coherent script. Every 30 years the creature appears and the town folks sacrifice themselves until it's full and goes away. The outside world apparently doesn't notice the uptick in missing persons. Why doesn't someone strap a bomb to themselves and blow the creature up? Lots of violence (even though no one seems to be able to shoot) no sex or nudity. This movie is not worth a free viewing let alone purchasing it.,1397952000,6,752,4.41726618705036

6228793,4,B00HV6AI6W,"Well, after months and months of failed attempts to catch Brandon Slagle's Dead Sea at one of the local conventions, I couldn't wait any longer. So I bought the DVD online and patiently waited for it to arrive. Now, from the cover of the DVD and the description of the film, one might either write this off as just another corny attempt at a 'Creature Feature,' or mistake it for one of it's intentionally cheesy counterparts like Piranha or Sharknado. Neither of which is accurate. In fact, Dead Sea is a story about a small town and the dynamics of the people who have inhabited it for their whole lives. And even though the villain of the film is a 'monster,' this film focuses more on the evil that lurks within the people that we call our neighbors. The DVD is available for purchase online at Amazon and other retailers.

A marine biologist is sent on assignment back to her hometown to investigate the mysterious deaths of thousands of fish in an inland salt water lake. But when she arrives, her past quickly begins to catch up with her. From a strained relationship with her father to her old classmates disdain toward her return, everything reminds her of exactly why she left in the first place. But as startling revelations make their way to light, the towns dark secrets become exposed. And in the end, Victoria is left wondering whether the real monster lies below the surface of the water or deep inside the hearts of the residents of the small town.

Mr. Slagle's film is beautifully shot, using an occasionally vibrant color scale against the extremely bleak backdrop provided by the location itself. There is a sense of despair in every frame, and the setting itself induces a deep feeling of claustrophobia. And more than anything, I appreciate the decision to leave the monster almost entirely to the viewers imagination, which is what separates this film from feeling like a 'B-Movie'. But that isn't the only thing that sets this one apart, the script itself is remarkably well written and actually quite poignant at times. There is a scene between Victoria and her father toward the end of the film that plays like an emotional punch in the gut. And the cast is fantastic, with a stand out performance from Alexis Iancono as the highly damaged Victoria, who returns to town only to  quickly remember why she left in the first place. Brandon Slagle is cold and unfeeling as Kier, though as the film progresses and we learn the reasons behind his disconnection, it's almost enough to make us empathize with him. And the always amazing Devanny Pinn is wonderfully apathetic as Auriel, a young girl much like Victoria, who feels trapped and desperate to find a way out.

My only small issue with this film was in the post-production, and it isn't even really an issue as much as a matter of taste. For me, the dialogue sits a little too low in the mix, which forced me to rewind a few times during the film because I was afraid I had missed something. I recently read an article where director Christopher Nolan defended the decision to mix his dialogue in the same manner on Interstellar, and I can appreciate an artistic choice as such. It does, however, make it more difficult for me to fully immerse myself in a film. That being said, this did not take away from my enjoyment of the movie as a whole, and I would still highly recommend Dead Sea for any fans of the genre. Order your copy today. Cheers.

Grade: B.

As to the actual story, well, take the most repulsive characters ever, mix in a ""something-something-monster"" plot that makes no sense, never show the monster, and leave with a ""So what happens in 30 years?"" question and you've got something to rival ""Marina Monster"" as something utterly terrible that should have been deleted from the camcorder.

Do yourself a favor.  You've been putting off replacing the disposal, or one of the ceiling fans.  Spend your time doing that, and you'll end up with a working disposal or ceiling fan.  Watch this, you'll wish you'd spent the time drinking.  The first option is much healthier.
