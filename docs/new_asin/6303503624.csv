673678,2,6303503624,"I saw this film (what I could stand) because I was curious about Toyah Willcox as an actor. I had to go to the end credits to find out which character she was. I was expecting the beautiful woman from the cover of her ""Minx"" album. Instead, from 1977 I got a sort of chubby teenager playing ""Mad"", a punk girl with a carot crewcut. Not interesting.

It is a very ambitious movie, and perhaps it should earn points for that. But it is just so poorly conceived. Poorly film, poor sound, attrocious acting, bad timing.

You may like it if you like punk sensibility and garage band production values.",1127001600,2,596,4.409090909090909

Derek Jarman's twisted psuedo-Rocky Horror is just the perfect treat for any fan of really twisted films.

Queen Elizabeth I (Jenny Runacre who also plays the character of Bod) wants to see into the future. With the aid of her court and the angel Ariel, she is transported 4 centuries into the future to get a gander of current life. What she sees is nothing less than shocking. Total anarchy: Buckingham Palace is a recording studio owned by insane media master Borgia Ginz (Orlando), the Church is a sex hall, police only help themselves and what you can grab, is yours.

The main focous of the movie, however is a group of five young women: the sexy and always turned on Crabs (Little Nell), the ""schoolteacher"" with a nack for singing ""Rule Brittania"" in punk fashon named Amyl Nitrate (Jordan), the pyromaniac fire bug Mad (Toyah Willcox), the sweet and romantic Chaos (Hermine Demoriane) and finally the Queen in her own little world: Bod (Jenny's second role in the film).

There is also some early music by: Adam Ant, Brian Eno, Wayne County and many others. The music fits the film perfectly and is quite fun all around.

Now, onto the DVD:

The image quality is great. Probably not the best dvd picture I've ever seen but none the less, it's wonderful. It's presented in it's original aspect ratio of 1.66 and is enhanced for widescreen TVs.

The films original audio track is quite good as well. It's a Dolby Digital Mono track and surprisingly, there's no problems with it (I sometimes have problems with 1.0 tracks but not this time)

The special features are a bushell of fun: First there is the documentary which runs nearly 40 minutes and has a lot of information of the director and film. Toyah Willcox even shows up for an interview along with Jenny Runacre). We are also offered script pages with a series of notes. Continuity stills, sketches, the original (and almost as twisted as the movie) theatrical trailer, production pictures and finally, Jordan's complete dance (longer take than what is in the movie) which is quite interesting.

Jubilee is not a film for everyone or casual viewers of odd movies. Unless you really like twisted movies, then just rent it. But if you are ready for some odd, odd, odd fun...enjoy Jubilee.",1103932800,7,2279,4.749367088607595
673680,1,6303503624,"If i could give this movie zero stars, i would. The story (or lack thereof) sounded interesting in principle, but this movie has absolutely nothing of intrest to say to the viewer and fails in every respect. Forget the reviewers who tell you to purchase this if at least for the punk legends who act in it, who cares if Adam Ant is in it when you're just going to be bored to tears the whole way through? The film is amateurish beyond belief and i can honsetly say the acting is the worst ive seen in any film, ever.

This is the first time Criterion has let me down, and what a gargantuan let down this movie was. I wonder what on earth they were thinking when they decided to unleash this stinker of a movie on the public. At the risk of sounding like a fascist, I dare say it would have been a much better move to bury every print of this movie in the same landfill they used for the E.T. Atari game back in the 80s than release it on DVD. Let's play pretend for a second and say the actors in this film could actually act - even then every character is so annoying and not one bit likable that the movie would STILL stink. One good thing can be said about it though - The bad acting mixed with the horrible dialogue mixed with the incredibly stupid looking ""angel"" that shows Queen Elizabeth the future will bring a generous laugh to anyone, that is untill you realize you paid for this $hit. Then you'll probably cry.

Dont waste your money on this, even if you're a fan of punk rock and/or Adam Ant as i am. This is genuinely garbage. My copy of Jubilee is going straight to an auction site.

673681,2,6303503624,I find it easy to overlook the fact that a film like Pasolini's - 'Salo' is hard to watch.  That is because 'Salo' is one of the most rewarding and deeply effecting films ever made - but Jubilee does not contain these rewards for me.

673684,5,6303503624,"Jubilee is a wildly beautiful - and entertaining - film which strikes a precarious, and compelling, balance between sheer anarchy and genuine beauty. I was so struck by it that I watched it three times in one week. Yet it remains an elusive work, constantly tantalizing with new connections and still more layers of meaning. The outstanding Criterion Collection DVD offers a wealth of supplemental features, making it an excellent introduction to both the film and director Derek Jarman.
The basic plot of this experimental fantasy is simple: Queen Elizabeth I has the historical alchemist John Dee summon the spirit Ariel and transport all of them 400 years into the future, where they find London a post-apocalyptic wasteland. The talented Jenny Runacre plays both Queen Elizabeth and the anarchic latter-day ""queen"" Bod, who leads an all-female biker gang.
Made in 1977, at the height of the Punk movement, Jubilee has misleadingly been called a ""Punk movie."" Despite its trappings (from clothing to casting several well-known singers), ultimately it seems more about Punk than of it. How Jarman uses then-rising star Adam Ant is revealing. With his sweetly boyish persona - made just a bit wild by the black leather and painted-on lower sideburns - Adam Ant as ""Kid"" is undeniably appealing. But throughout he is as passive offstage as he is frenzied onstage. And Kid, unable to connect with anyone, will do anything for his career. He signs with the grotesque Borgia Ginz, the multinational mogul who controls the entire planet's media - hence political, even religious - power structure. Ginz immediately rechristens Kid as ""Scum. That's commercial. It's all [the audience] deserves."" One of the film's most haunting images is of Kid lasciviously kissing his own image on a TV. How's that for a postmodern twist on the myth of Narcissus?
Beyond the Punk movement, Jarman turned to many diverse sources to flesh out his vision for Jubilee. It's powerful on its own terms, without any need for ""footnoting,"" but the wide-ranging references create a fascinating texture. He uses film (notably Cocteau's Blood of a Poet, Godard's La Chinoise, Pasolini's Oedipus Rex, and Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange), literature (Huxley's Brave New World, Orwell's 1984; also his pastiche Elizabethan dialogue is beautiful: ""I cast for Ariel, pearl of fire, my only star....""), history and myth (suggested by character names, from the historical female ruler of ancient Britain, Bodicea - i.e., ""Bod"" - and the Borgias to mythical figures like Sphinx and Angel), and even dance club culture (characters named Amyl Nitrate and Crabs). He is also one of the most creatively playful of modern filmmakers, and that schoolboyish ""let's put on a show"" energy keeps his films, even with their density of themes, buoyant and wonderfully entertaining.
Jarman also brings great emotional resonance through his characters (most of whom he cast from friends and lovers). I was often surprised by how much I cared about these eccentric, and sometimes lethal, allegorical people. Although each viewer will bond with different characters, I was most moved by the ""triangle"" between the two teasingly incestuous brothers, Sphinx and Angel (who utters the classic line, ""I didn't know I was dead till I was 15""), and the artist Viv (whom Jarman described, affectionately, as a ""butch dyke""). Their tangled connections, although genuinely caring, never reach true equality: The two men, on one level, can be seen as using the woman as a way of enhancing their own (masculine, even incestuous) relationship. Still, they become all the more affecting at the film's climax (which I will not divulge).
There is so much more to Jubilee than I can suggest in the brief space here: It is visually gorgeous (Jarman is a master of composition and lighting; he began as a painter, and stage and film designer), makes fascinating use of music (from Punk to classical) and sound effects, offers a provocative series of ideas about history (as Amyl says, ""History still fascinates me. It's so intangible. You can weave facts anywhere you like. Good guys can swap places with bad guys""), media manipulation and artistic narcissism and audience passivity, and, ultimately, the duality of beauty and anarchy, which are perhaps two sides of the same double mirror.",1056326400,45,4315,5.148148148148148
673685,5,6303503624,"Derek Jarmans film Jubilee is not for pacifists or homophobiacs. It's a study in violence as violence and sex as sex.

This is classic Jarman and features a solid cast, which includes Punk goddess Toyah Wilcox, who I believe is now Mrs. Robert Fripp (King Crimson) - who also appeared (gasp... topless) in Jarman's superb version of Shakespeare's The Tempest.

7849532,4,6303503624,"Derek Jarman's second feature film, and possibly his best-known work, is a hymn to the British punk movement, a riot of color and music and chaos with very little in the way of plot and a fairly obtuse political and thematic subtext. In essence, Queen Elizabeth I (Jenny Runacre) comes forward to the year or her namesake's Silver Jubilee to witness a violent, decaying, anarchistic England. The film is composed of various vignettes involving a number of young punks, mostly female, interspersed with several musical performances, including notably Adam and the Ants (Adam Ant also plays a significant role in the film as ""Kid"") and Siouxsie and the Banshees.

This I think is a hard film to wrap your head around without some context. If one is not really all that familiar with the punk scene, and in particular with the politics surrounding it (really, it's the revolutionary attitude of early punk rather than the music that informs this film for the most part), I think it will be rather challenging. There are a lot of philosophical discussions that mostly start up and don't go anywhere, and it's never quite clear whether this is supposed to be the ""real"" England or a somewhat dystopian vision of a near or alternate future. Perhaps that's part of Jarman's overall design; even at this stage in his career he was clearly deeply dissatisfied with the pace of progress in his country, and the copious nudity on display in the film (especially male nudity) I think is a big part of his raised middle finger to the establishment. The only scenes in the film that came off as anything like ""shocking"" - the only films that are meant to, I think - are ones of violence; there's a powerful moment when the most nihilist of the punks, Mad (Toyah Willcox) breaks down after attacking a police officer; the sexual scenes on the other hand are generally presented in a matter-of-fact way. My guess is that in Britain at the time - as in the USA then and now - this was probably seen as an attack on the notion that violence should be seen as more acceptable than nudity in film.

It's an odd work, and one I'll probably get back to at some point; I've seen three other Jarman films in the past, years ago, though all of them are from much later in his career. This seems in some ways a precursor to the truly ferocious and angry&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-of-England/dp/B000BDGVTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last of England</a>&nbsp;from a decade later, a nonnarrative look at the wasteland Jarman felt his country was becoming under Margaret Thatcher; and it also foreshadows the anachronistic intertwining of the modern and the ancient that is so memorable in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Edward-II/dp/B000929ARI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Edward II</a>. It's notable that, though the film is ""punk"" in outlook and much of the music falls at least loosely into that area Jarman uses the decidedly un-punkish Brian Eno to score the film (his first original score), and there are many pieces of classical music used throughout - and not in an ironic way. Jarman may have wanted to overthrow the establishment, but he always had a deep appreciation for earlier eras of art and culture. Just not the societies and rules that produced them.

While I don't, at this point, love the film as much as many reviewers, I do think it's fascinating, and I expect to return to it again after seeing more of Jarman's films.  I think that viewers unfamiliar with avant-garde cinema going into this primarily for the punk aspects may be getting more than they bargained for - but I would hope they would stick with it.",1283558400,2,3709,5.035830618892508

The film's ""storyline"" is loose and hardly apparent, but that is part of the enjoyment I got.  Basically, I see this as a bunch of London-based friends and scene makers getting together to play at making a, what would have been university-level (at the time,) class project.

7849536,5,6303503624,"Derek Jarman didn't set out to make a ""punk film"", he set out to make ""a film about punk"", and many people don't like his interpretations.  As a disaffected ex-punk, I found his interpretations poignant and honest, to the point where I could see how it would enrage people.  People, especially posh kids playing at being lower-class for a time, don't generally like brutal honesty.

One of Jarman's working titles for this film was _High Fashion: An Anarchic Comedy about Sex & Violence_, and while the subject matter and plot are disturbingly nihilistic and there's this intense overtone of depressiveness amongst the primary characters, the comical elements are rather apparent, though probably too dry or deadpan for some people on either side of the pond.  Jarman also uses humour to make some clear points about youth's relationship with history and tradition, nationalism, homophobia, the modern state of the monarchy, and other socially relevant concepts that are still important today, no matter how much some people insist otherwise.

The Criterion DVD also contains many special features, including a cinematic trailer and scans and transcriptions from Derek Jarman's _Jubilee_ scrapbook, a documentary with interviews of people who were in the cast and crew, and loads and loads of promotional stills.  The highlight of the ""scrapbook"" portion of the features, in my opinion, is the photo of Jarman wearing Vivienne Westwood's infamous, incredibly incoherent, and nauseatingly homophobic ""Open Lettre (T-Shirt) to Derek Jarman"", followed by a transcription of the text of the t-shirt -- this will single-handedly destroy any misconceptions one may have of the public face of ""punk"" ever being progressive or at least open-minded.",1218844800,7,1740,5.355311355311355
7849537,4,6303503624,"This is a wonderful film, and it's also greatly misunderstood.  It came out in 1978 at the height of the punk movement in England, and it was labeled as a ""punk"" film.  It is not a punk film; it is a Derek Jarman film.  Since it is a Derek Jarman film, it's filled with poetry, sadness, brilliant imagery, and a deep tenderness in many of its scenes.  It's also filled with homoerotic elements and some deeply poetic dialogue.  The only thing the film doesn't have is punk.  If it were a document of the punk movement, it would only be a historical artifact, like a news piece.  It would be terribly dated now.  But this film doesn't date at all.  There's hardly any mention of punk in the film, and there's hardly any punk rock music in the film.  In the documentary included in the DVD, the people who worked with Jarman on the film inform us that the punk movement/rockers hated the film (probably because most of them weren't in it, and Jarman didn't embrace the punk movement).  Many of these people walked out on the film, and someone (I can't remember who) even wrote an ""open letter"" to Derek Jarman.  Jarman ended up having a T-shirt printed up of it.  There's a picture of him in the documentary wearing it.  I must admit I like that (Jarman wearing the T-shirt, not the actual letter).  There are a number of interesting performances, including Adam Ant (in his first film).  Ian Charleson (Angel) is good as well in his first film.  He was in Chariots of Fire, Gandhi, and Opera, and, like Jarman, died of AIDS in 1987.  Richard O'Brien (John Dee) is very good here.  He played Riff Raff in The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Jenny Runacre, who plays Elizabeth I and Bod here, also played Jack Nicholson's wife in Antonioni's The Passenger.  There's a real curious mix of professionals and non-professional here, and it works very well.
