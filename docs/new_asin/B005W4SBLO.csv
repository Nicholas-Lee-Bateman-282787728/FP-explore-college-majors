Don't usually care for silent, except most of Charlie Chaplin's, but the premise, portrayal of actual and fictional characters, and the written dialog--which is so clever while being very short and to the point that it could pass for contemporary speech, (consider the film is 95 years old!!)--so I wonder if the original dialog was 'updated' in some way. Anyway, this was all so outrageously clever and ridiculously funny, I think it's the best silent comedy I've every enjoyed so that's why I'm ordering it right now. Especially hilarious was Kaiser Wilhelm's wife, the Empress, who was about twice his size, throttling him out of jealousy since the story revolves around a female seducing him out of battle plans!! Did not give away the most farcical plot point!! Don't know if DVD will contain segments which were 'blotchy/blurred', but did not detract from this viewer's enjoyment.",1417910400,,921,4.987012987012987
8487830,4,B005W4SBLO,"Written and produced by Mack Sennett, the film made ''in 1919, belongs to the tendency of patriotic films. A little later, because in 1919 the war is over. You can see the film as a cartoon against the autocratic political system of Germany. Neither the emperor, his son or the Marshal Hindenburg are not spared by Mack Sennett. A fun movie.",1342137600,,341,4.60655737704918
