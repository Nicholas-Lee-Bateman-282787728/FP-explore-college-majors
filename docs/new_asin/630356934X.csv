7851451,1,630356934X,"This is a very poor sequel to the original ""Mark of the Devil"" using one of the same cast, but actually just re-creating another unconnected outbreak of witch-hunting. Gone is any important plot, instead a group of witch-hunters just persecute people for cheap shock effects, this time focusing their main efforts on a nunnery, in particular a timid and somewhat backward younger nun.

Erica Blanc stars as a noblewoman who stands up in opposition to the fanatics. She becomes wrapped up in the events after her young son makes friends with the quiet young nun who later receives the worst of the witch-hunter's accusations. This is the only aspect of the sequel that treads the same ground as the struggle between Herbet Lom and Udo Kier in the first movie, but it's far less interesting than that was. However Erica Blanc makes a very good heroine, and is one of the few believable characters.

The torture scenes are also less outrageous than in the first film, and much less convincingly done. It's actually kind of boring, although the ending does have a ray of originality that I quite liked (in which a persecuted character's execution is seemingly halted by divine intervention), but apart form that it's pretty dull.

The first film is far more effective, the sequel certainly does not out-do it on any level. What is particularly annoying is the wretched presentation of the film by the Edde Video label, the picture looks like a third or fourth generation bootleg recording, you can scarcely see people's facial experessions unless they are in extreme close up. Do not waste your money on this unless you are truly desperate to have a very inferior version of the first film in your collection, although sadly it seems like one of the very few ways of actually seeing this film as there is no known DVD release at time of writing.",1184198400,5,1841,4.783018867924528
