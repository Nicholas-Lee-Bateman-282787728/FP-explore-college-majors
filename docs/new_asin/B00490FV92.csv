8506321,5,B00490FV92,"As a professional model working trade shows making a few hundred dollars a day, I had wanted to become a professional trade show presenter but none of the presenters I talked to would give me the information (because they were making around $1000.00 per day)!

Finally, someone teaches this highly lucrative career information! After using and applying the info in this course I literally am a very successful trade show presenter making quadruple what I used to make, working only a few days per month.

If you can speak articulately, do not mind traveling and getting paid for it, this course is for you.

I cannot believe someone built essentially a ""career in a box""!

WARNING: The run time says 4 minutes, it is actually a 5 DVD set with hours of content so this must be a mistake. Ignore that typo.

There is NOTHING like this anywhere else in the world. This information is usually not ever available. Grab it while it is!",1329523200,,929,4.640243902439025
