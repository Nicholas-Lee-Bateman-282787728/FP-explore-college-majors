8731440,2,B014MUKKAI,"I found this DVD to be somewhat disjointed. There isn't really a lot about the actual history of the world chess championship. There is a collection of games starting with Murphy, who was not an official world champion. Indeed the first chapter includes Murphy, Anderson and Zukertort, great players, but not world champions. The presentation leaves a lot to be desired, as Mr Kopec spends most of the time looking up and away from the viewer, seemingly reading a script written on the ceiling. It looks extremely awkward. My main gripe however, is the way he presents the games. He simply races through the moves with astonishing speed, as if he can't wait to get to the end, leaving the viewer no time to absorb anything connected with strategy, tactics or the essence of the game. It's as if he thinks all viewers are Grand Masters. Very disappointing.",1483142400,,855,4.783783783783784
8731441,5,B014MUKKAI,"Very nicely produced review of important games of the World Chess Champions from Paul Morphy to Magnus Carlsen.  The DVD has well over 4 hours of video with analysis of 31 Championship-level games.

IM Kopec provides some interesting background information for each champion discussed.  The majority of the video though is devoted to game analysis which should help improve your chess.",1452297600,,385,5.278688524590164
8731442,5,B014MUKKAI,"IM Kopec has produced an audacious project!  The conception itself -- a stylistic exposure to all the champions on a single disc -- is staggering, to say the least.  What is truly remarkable is that he succeeds so well.  In my (wood-pusher's) opinion, viewers can indeed ""get a feel"" for what these title-holders brought to the game, and certainly witness their strengths over the board.

Perhaps the greatest ""plus"" actually came from Kopec's overviews and ""on-the-side"" comments.  I shall note just three of them:  (1) Lasker was anxious to hold on to the title, and thus compelled Schlechter to win the match by at least two games.  [Analysts have long speculated that Schlecther, the ""drawing master,"" surely saw the draw in Game 10 but was forced to play for a win.]  (2) Kopec suggests that Bobby Fischer had the same two-game advantage in mind when he laid out conditions for the match against Karpov (which was never played).  (3) Kopec also explains that Fischer was actually not a child prodigy, in the sense that Capablance and Reshevsky were.

I should be remiss if I neglected to offer (most) viewers some free advice.  Those who go to chess news sites (e.g., Chess.com, ChessDailyNews.com, UsefulChess.com, et al.) are all too familiar with the speed at which pieces fly across the board when one hits the ""play"" arrow.  With this video, also, the games often unfold too rapidly -- at least for those of us with my modest skills.  I was able to follow Alekhine's win against Capablanca (Game 34 of their title match) reasonably well, but I definitely required more time to comprehend his dazzling combination against Bogolubov.  Fortunately, there is a simple expedient:  the pause button!  I suspect that like me, most people will need some extra seconds (or minutes) to process the brilliant moves as they appear on the screen, but that with judicious use of the ""pause,"" they will enjoy the discussions immensely.

This criticism aside, I remain enthusiastic about the production.  It is certainly wonderful to see ALL the champions on a single DVD (rather than a three- or four-disc set), and Kopec's presentation is most impressive.",1451520000,2,2151,4.944289693593315
