1758719,4,B00006HAX1,"The morning workout instructed by Rodney Yee is terrific-- a gentle, brief  routine to do first thing in the morning.  I found it an excellent beginner's DVD.  Like Rodney says, the benefits seemed small at first, but you really do find it makes a difference.  The P.M. segment is okay, though I found the poses a bit more advanced for a beginner!",1044316800,3,347,4.548387096774194
1758720,4,B00006HAX1,"I have not done much yoga and have enjoyed this tape.  I find it great for those times when I get home too late to work out but am too wound up to sleep.  That being said, this is a very easy tape that will provide some nice stretching.  Be forewarned, Rodney does wear speedos in AM Yoga.",1040428800,6,289,3.9482758620689653
1758721,2,B00006HAX1,"I am an exercise enthusiast but have never done Yoga.  I got this, thinking it would be a good introduction but it is too simple (or maybe I'm just too simple minded).  The poses are not very challenging, however I do feel more ""loose"" after doing this.",1038960000,3,253,4.361702127659575
1758758,4,B00006HAX1,"It is a good DVD. Some of the flows are too wordy, as designed for a beginner, and once you're familiar with the flow, it interrupts. Small problem for a good DVD.",1400284800,,163,4.125
1758759,5,B00006HAX1,"This yoga has been very rewarding for me.  The instructors are encouraging and make the practice enjoyable.  There are a lot of breathing and stretching techniques, as well as work of the nervous system and relaxation, which I definitely need!  This will challenge your patience and your mind.  If you are only interested in getting skinny fast, or pushing yourself quickly to the limit to achieve fitness goals, you probably won't find it here. I now have three of Ravi and Ana's video's because I found them to be enriching on all levels, mental, physical, spiritual.  Yes, I have noticed my waistline getting slimmer and my body getting stronger, but it's a different kind of workout.  I think most people will know after one of their DVDs if you really enjoy it or don't care for it. Borrow it from your local library for free (if they have it), that's what I did. Then I ended up buying three of them, and I am going to buy more.  It works great for me.",1388361600,,958,4.502890173410405

1758761,5,B00006HAX1,"I love love love Ana & Ravi's DVDs. I own six so far, and this is one of my favorites. I love the matrix workout option that makes this totally different workouts for energizing in the morning and relaxing at night.

What makes their DVDs so extraordinary is a combination of the pacing, the demonstrations/explanations, and the affirmations they share throughout. I find myself using the mantras they've taught me throughout my day, alleviating stress with the breathing techniques they use in the video, and reminding myself to ""do my best and be so blessed."" Theirs are by far the best workout videos I have ever used, and I would strongly recommend them to anyone-- regardless of yoga experience or fitness level.",1369008000,3,717,4.877049180327869
1758762,5,B00006HAX1,"I do not have the updated matrix version of this workout, so this review is for the original non-matrix version.  I really love this practice.  The AM portion is great for starting off the day on the right foot.  As someone who frequently has trouble getting to sleep, I use the PM portion most.  The PM practice puts me in a state of peaceful bliss that allows me to go into a deep, restful sleep without bad dreams.  Even if I wake up in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep, the practice is short enough that I can hop out of bed, light a candle, lay out my yoga mat, do the exercises and immediately afterward hop back into bed and fall asleep almost instantly - and all without the hangover effect of sleep meds.",1360281600,4,732,4.2
1758763,5,B00006HAX1,"I reckon these two created a fabulous symbiosis! His voice guides you beautifully through all the moves and if you are not too sure you can see Ana showing you the asanas. I love their Kundalini Yoga, because it allows you your own pace, accommodates for your level ( I practiced Iyingar and Astanga Yoga for 9 years intensively- was a normal 38 year old when I started..) and leaves you with a feeling that you did something really beautiful, healthy and nourishing.. They are WONDERFUL!",1314144000,3,488,4.686046511627907
1758764,5,B00006HAX1,"Five years ago I was told I had fibromyalgia and would be in pain for the rest of my life. Altho limber as a young person, I had grown increasingly less flexible and strong as the years went by, and I was even losing ground with my (Rodney Yee) yoga. Bless my sister for gifting me with this, the first RaviAna workout I started on.  At first I was so bad at this beginner's level that I could see just how much I needed it. I even hurt my neck by overdoing it once; it only made me more determined to heal and grow strong again.  Over the years I have added many more of their workouts to my collection and have gone from barely being able to follow along to feeling strong and powerful. After two years of RaviAna and ten sessions of Rolfing (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rolfing-Reestablishing-the-Natural-Alignment-and-Structural-Integration-of-the-Human-Body-for-Vitality-and-Well-Being/dp/0892813350/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rolfing: Reestablishing the Natural Alignment and Structural Integration of the Human Body for Vitality and Well-Being</a>), I was able to hike to the top of Mt. Whitney. I also went from once or twice a week use to daily practice.  Something about their pacing, breath and cueing really works for me. My husband, the runner and scienterrific skeptic, joins me now on those mornings he doesn't run. He enjoys the challenge and understands that, whatever you think of chanting foreign religious syllables, there is a benefit to the chanting and the focused attention in itself. [If you are worried about committing religious heresy by doing yoga, please don't buy these tapes. On the other hand, a flexible body leads to a flexible mind (as Ravi likes to say), and you may discover that the rapture of moving energy through your body is an expression of the holy spirit. Or as Tina Turner says, ""Prayer is prayer. It doesn't matter what holy words you chant, what matters is that you do it with all your involvement--physical, mental and spiritual.""] If you are, as I was at first, truly a beginner, take your time, be kind to yourself, challenge your body without straining or overdoing, pay deep attention to the inner and outer experience of the moves, and you too can change your life to the good.",1307491200,11,2274,5.091152815013404
1758765,2,B00006HAX1,"I don't even know how to begin explaining this video. It was not at all what I expected. Based on the product I received, there defiantly should have been some kind of warning or, at the very least, a description of what Kundalini Yoga is all about, because I was completely unprepared for what I saw.

I have done yoga before and it has never been this strange. This video proudly features this breath of fire thing that, I'm sorry, made me feel absolutely ridiculous.  I have never pulsated my stomach in such a manner, nor have I ever gone through moves so quickly. There was no time to focus during the AM or PM sets (which were what I bought the video for) because I was either trying to hold back laughter or trying to figure out what the heck was going on because it was moving so fast.

And again, sorry, but in essence, this video is 90 minutes of the breath of fire:

Kundalini Yoga might be like other types, not silly and strange; I am not a yogi and have no idea. But this video was very, very weird.",1305676800,2,1019,4.237113402061856

I've only participated with this video workout 3 times a week for a few weeks and I'm amazed at what a difference this gentle, yet effective, workout (I do the AM section) has made in my abdominal muscle firmness and overall flexibility.  Also, I'm not sure, but it seems to have increased my labido and at 50+, going thru menopause, that's worth getting up 30 minutes early for if that's all it did.",1281398400,11,541,4.556701030927835
1758781,5,B00006HAX1,"This DVD saved me the cost of seeking medical attention.  After a few weeks of watching TV, reading, and napping on my side on a firm couch, my left neck and shoulder ached with movement, and getting in/out of bed and doing neck rolls hurt.  However, after doing this DVD for a week, the pain was gone.  For my back pain, the stomach grind and spinal flex exercises seemed the most helpful, even though they are simple exercises, with relatively minimal movement.  I did skip a few exercises, e.g. the neck rolls, until my back was better.",1274054400,4,539,4.525773195876289
1758782,5,B00006HAX1,"This remains my favorite raviana, so I thought I'd give a more detailed set list, as reviewers have done for their later DVDs, in case you're sitting on the fence about this one. I have the pre-Matrix version, but I trust the only thing added besides the Matrix is Ana's voiceover and alignment tips. If you're not into meditation, chanting and breathwork, you probably won't appreciate this set as much (especially PM); all included, each set runs about 45 minutes.

The AM set begins with a morning prosperity breath meditation: Inhale, hold the breath and pump your stomach to ""har"" up to 40 times (Ravi says if you can't make 40, ""that's okay""); do this for several minutes. The AM set is similar to the warmups on Quick Fixes, but longer and more intense: sufi grinds; spinal flex holding legs, then knees; neck rolls; leg stretches (20 degrees back then forward); and about a minute of frogs. Then begin the set with continuous breath of fire: forward bend; bridge pose; stretch pose; leg lifts (up 90 degrees, spread wide, back, down); tuck pose (knees into chest, head up); arm criss-cross in easy pose; V for victory pose ends the BOF sequence; then a brief corpse. Then the Morning Call chant (Ek Ong Kar) for about 10 minutes; for me, all that BOF and navel work seems to intensify the vibrations of the mantra, which is nice.

The PM set also begins with a breath meditation: inhale 8 nose, exhale 8 mouth, silently chanting sa ta na ma. The exercise set is brief: alternate arm/leg lifts; rock n' roll; spinal flex with shoulder shrugs; and the propeller. The Heart Center Mantra is next (probably my second favorite ""sung"" mantra after the mantra meditation that ends Dance the Chakras), ad guray namay, etc. This is followed by stomach pumps with the breath held in and out. Hands clasped in front of you, you then pump your arms up overhead and down to chest level rapidly while breathing through puckered lips. Then arms overhead, do BOF through puckered lips, followed by a brief meditation. The relaxation is to a gong sound, and Ravi invites you to imagine yourself floating 3 feet above your body. The ending meditation is Shabd Kriya, also for about 10 minutes, which Ravi says is good for sleep, relaxation or jet lag; inhale 4 counts, hold 16, and exhale 2 to sa ta na ma whahay guru.

The music is perfect -- it ramps up during BOF and arm-pumping sequences, and is quietly supportive and unobtrusive for the rest. The breathwork, chants and meditations are wonderful; even the relaxation is unique and sublime. I find it invigorating, relaxing and spiritual; then again, I'd rather spend time in prison than a yoga class, so take it for what it's worth.",1273104000,24,2679,4.695744680851064
1758783,5,B00006HAX1,"Extremely helpful for a beginner (like me). Pace is set well and narrated very distinctly. Various camera angles help with the visualization and matches
what you are being told to do. No distracting background or overly ""earthy"" music. Just clear concise narration and instructions on how to follow. And the

1758785,5,B00006HAX1,"The entire dvd is great; I especially enjoy doing the pm yoga when energy starts to lag in the late afternoon hours.  The format for all the Raviana dvds is terriffic and consistent throughout all the nine videos I have collected so far.  However each one is different in specific ways, and all are challenging and fun.

1758786,5,B00006HAX1,"My first introduction to Ana & Ravi's Kundalini was their Ultimate stretch DVD.  I tried it to go through it a couple of times but could never manage to get to the end.  The breathing exercises made me feel light headed and the length of the DVD was too long.  (I run, weight train, and intersperse my workouts with yoga - but this was so different).  I ended up selling my DVD (which I later would regret).

About a year later - I purchased the AM-PM Yoga to help my sleep (or rather sleeplessness).  I'm what my mother classifies as a nervous sleeper.  Either I stay up or I get to sleep fine but wake up suddenly.

I now use the PM series of the DVD before I go to sleep. I've never used a yoga DVD in consecutive nights. But AM/PM is popped into my DVD every night.  Just the remedy I need for nights of delicious sleep.  The restful sleep has translated to better productivity during the days.

I've already sent in my Amazon order for the Ultimate Stretch again.",1249603200,15,968,4.263736263736264
1758787,5,B00006HAX1,"I purchased this DVD to replace the one I lost. It's worth every penny. AM Yoga is what it says - a perfect way to stretch muscles and prepare for the day after a night of rest. PM Yoga is a great way to wind down. It's a great alternative when you can't get out to exercise.

Both instructors are adept and skilled. And I envy them being able to do their thing in such beautiful locations.",1247529600,,390,4.064935064935065
1758798,5,B00006HAX1,"Okay, I am a ""rabid"" Ravi/Ana Fan...I must admit.  I have all but one (now) of their yoga DVD's.  Like the rest, I appreciate the time, effort and care they seem to put into their work.  I use the ease and conveniece of these DVD's when comparing fitness DVD's for review and very, very few come even close.
I did not own the original Am/Pm DVD.  This Matrix DVD is so convenient!  If I get up and feel like an energizing short work out and can put the DVD in and go the matrix option.  From there I can program in a 10 minute practice or a 60 minute practice. The AM practice segments have more vigourous movements and lots of breath of fire so be prepared to wake up!!  If you like you can practice one section two times in a row if you really need to energize.  If you like, you can add in a PM segment if you are already frazzled first thing in the morning--some mornings are like that and I'm sure Ravi and Ana thought of this when allowing for this option ;-)
The PM sections has more long, deep breathing and de-stressing asanas.  I enjoy the relaxation with the gong at the end...totally relaxing.
For me, the conveniece of the Matrix and now newer Ravi/Ana DVD's are second to none.  The care and compassion that comes across from them to me, the viewer, is just pure bliss.",1246060800,7,1283,4.242798353909465
1758799,5,B00006HAX1,"I ordered this last week and was surprised to receive a new Matrix Menu version with a new cover! I love the morning breath of fire series which takes you through continuous poses doing the breath of fire. It's an amazing pick me up in the morning. Far better than coffee. The PM set is for centering and seems designed to let go of the stress of the day. It's got some great core and upper body work. There are a number of AM and PM breathing exercises and meditations which you can program into your workout. My favorite is the before bed breathing meditation, which I swear helps me get to sleep without having to toss and turn for an hour obsessing over things that happened during the day. This DVD is making a huge difference in my life. I highly recommend it!",1243468800,10,766,4.326388888888889

1758801,5,B00006HAX1,"AM & PM Yoga with Ana Brett and Ravi Singh is the single most practiced DVD in my collection.  (I have all of Ana's & Ravi's and more of others).  I reach for this DVD the most because each session is quick (20 minutes), fun, and a great practice. I especially like the breathing practice in the AM session.  The breathing along with the postures has helped my digestion and the way my stomach feels. Also, practicing consistently has helped me develop strength in my core like nothing else I have ever practiced. The chanting and flow of the PM session along with the ""walking on the ceiling"" puts me back into a peaceful state after a stressful day. This is the DVD I recommend the most when people ask.  It is a great introduction to Kundalini Yoga, easy to follow along with, and it really makes you feel great.  Take my word, if you purchase this DVD you will be practicing it for years to come.",1229731200,5,900,4.365269461077844
1758802,5,B00006HAX1,"This is the first Ravi & Ana DVD I purchased, and I am so glad it was.  This is a great DVD to have, it usually takes me about 45 minutes to do the warm ups, meditations, and relaxations. I have been using this DVD nearly everyday for a month. It really is a great way to start and end your day!

The AM set is challenging, I have only been practicing for a couple months, once or twice a day, and I have a shoulder injury. It is challenging but not impossible. I am definitely getting better at the asanas though, I notice that I am able to hold poses longer and stronger everyday that I consistencly practice. So don't get frustrated if you can't keep up with Ana, go at your own pace and take a break if you need to! Breathing is the most important part and everyone can do that. The Am set has breath of fire, which is great in itself, but requires practice.

The PM is really good. It is not very hard to do, but is really really relaxing. I try to do this set everynight. The meditation at the end is one of my favorites.

If you are considering getting a Ravi & DVD, I would suggest this one for your first purchase. The sets are short, but not too short, and cover all of the essentials.",1225756800,9,1195,4.072340425531915

I figured a yoga workout in the morning or night would be easiest, but I just can't seem to keep the routine.  Maybe because it's a DVD that I have to watch.  I'm on one week, then off two doing the yoga.

1758806,4,B00006HAX1,"This was an interesting DVD. I started doing yoga a few months back but hadn't experienced Kundalini at all.

Apparently, if this DVD is indicative of typical Kundalini practice, the form is all about breathing fast and repeating small movements for long periods of time.

The workout is physically exhausting, even though there are no actual 'yoga'-type poses. The routine is, you mostly sit there moving your arms, breathing in and out very fast. Or moving your legs while  breathing really fast. Or sitting still and breathing really fast. I was dripping sweat, but barely moving.

The whole routine was rather like tightly controlled aerobics class. With really involved chanting.

There were many meditations interspersed between the moves, which I found different than I was used to - I am used to the savasana being at the end. This is a completely different kind of yoga.

It's possible that this kind of yoga is extremely satisfying to some people, but I don't think this is the kind I would do again. At least not at this time - maybe my tastes will move into that direction later in my practice.

I think the chanting parts would be better if the words were left on the screen more than a moment. It was very hard to remember what I was supposed to be saying.

The AM and PM sections were pretty similar in my estimation. I really have no idea what made either one a morning or night-time set. Each part is about a half hour, but one can do the whole disc in 90 minutes (including the intro, breathing instruction, warm-up and meditations).

The menu offers a choice of playing the entire DVD or pieces at a time. There is a brief intro to the various breathing techniques (slow breathing and Breath of Fire) and an short warm-up to the AM or PM parts.

Instructor Ana Brett sits on a small round white rug in a white room. It's kind of neat that you can't see the walls - it looks like she is on a magic carpet floating in an ethereal plane. She has her eyes closed during most of the routine and we only hear her voice during the introduction to breathing and during the chanting/singing.

We don't see the other instructor, Ravi Singh, at all but hear his voice during the routines. His voice is low and soothing. During each set, he talks about how the poses are helping different organs and bodily systems.

Although this style of yoga is not to my preference, I did get a fantastic workout and know my core will be sore tomorrow.

Overall, the DVD is probably not for people seeking a typical yoga experience. It might be very well-done as far as Kundalini goes, but it's so not what I was expecting during my beginner's yogic learning curve.

A good, alternative yoga program with lots of chanting for Kundalini yogis or fitness fans open to experimenting.",1215043200,23,2774,4.566532258064516

I've been using this for a lot of stress relief.  I have been popping this one in on hard days right after I get home from work and by the end I am re-energized and ready to do the things (after work) that I really want to do instead of just sitting around on the couch and then crashing in bed.,1212624000,6,471,3.875
1758819,5,B00006HAX1,"I love this video.  It is a combination of yoga; chakra balancing; meditation & chanting.  I bought Kundalini Yoga For Beginners & Beyond By Singh & Brett...I like both DVD's.  The 2nd DVD is more of a yoga workout the am/pm is more complete in the sense that it is working on your body, mind, spirituality & chakras.  Both videos do an amazing job at strengthening my back.  AM/PM does an amazing job of keeping me calm and helping me to get a good nights sleep.  I keep both videos around and combine them depending on the amount of time that I have to spend.  If you have never done Kundalini yoga or chanting keep an open mind.  I have given this DVD to my friends/nieces and they think it is a bit weird at first.  But stick with it and you will see a difference in you core strength and your calmness.

Both I would say invigorate your rested body after a long slumber and after a long day at work.  The PM session is a favorite as I don't normally have the time to do more than 25 minutes between coming home and cooking dinner: the real plus is that if I have had a stressful day at work, the PM session really does relax my mind and my tense body, and I noticed my appetite is reduced too.

For those new to kundalini yoga: this is not what you would normally expect i.e it is not filled with down facing dog, sun salutations and warrior poses: this form of yoga is focused on breathing, calming the mind and relaxing the body from stress.  if you are really interested in a tool for connecting to your spiritual self then kundalini yoga will be one of many tools that you will find as a seeker.

I don't know which it is; Kundalini yoga, or Ravi & Anna's style (or perhaps it's just this combination) have me hooked! I get meditation, cardio breathing, stretching, strengthening and centering all in under 30 minutes! And it REALLY does make a difference. My back never hurts anymore, I'm more flexible, and I feel more at peace. My husband who is NOT a yoga type of guy actually tried it with me one night and got into as well. He even gets up early with me now to do it. I still do pilates and find this, and most of the other Anna & Ravi videos, a perfect compliment to it.

1758822,5,B00006HAX1,"Health from a different level - I always did some kind of sport to balance my life. Yet, sometimes I felt less energy after going for a jogg or doing a gymnastic work out. 3 months ago I started doing these yoga exercises with Ravi & Ana and it is remarkable: 1. I recognised (after ""fat free"" DVD) that I had no food cravings for chocolate or bread anymore, I had not to hold myself back from ""unhealthy food"". Somehow this ""craving"", which I had fought for years, left me after the first time doing their exercise DVD. This was an extraordinary experience.
These exercises bring you in touch with your natural flow. Since then I recognised that especially the chakra exercises which seem to be simple are extremely effective.
With regards to the AM & PM I highly recommend it. Yet, I would have definitely underestimated it without doing their other more engaging workouts (e.g. Fat Free new & Warrior Workout). The AM training is short & very powerful. Sometimes I just do the chakra meditation & that alone has an energising & harmonious effect I have not felt with any other exercise.",1174867200,19,1089,4.618556701030927

I do the AM section daily and try to do the PM several times a week. I read a review where someone said they were turned off by Ana seeming to be laughing- I'm sure that person hasn't been fortunate enough to have their chakras blasted open from doing this yoga, because that's what Ana is experiencing.

As a stay-at-home mom it's hard to find time to go to a Yoga center, or to find a daytime babysitter so that I can go. I started using the video because my treadmill broke.  My treadmill is now fixed, but I still alternate it with using the videos.  Ravi Singh has a wonderful, soothing voice that leads me through the meditations and helps me to find my inner peace.  Ana Brett is amazing how easily the workout comes to her and I hope it's just as easy for me some day.  The AM workout is very intense and will have you sweating buckets and you'll feel every sore muscle the next day and know that it works.

My thighs have also benefited from this exercise, but the most important benefit for me is the increase in energy, and the rhythm of meditation in-between every exercise is a beautiful way of starting the day.

I have given this DVD four stars because I have not yet used the PM program, I have tried it ones, but it did not appeal to me like the AM program. I can definitely recommend this DVD.",1163116800,24,659,4.264

Even though I had no yoga experience and am overweight I could still do most of the postures even back then.  So when I looked on here for their new DVDs as a workout reward for myself (gotta bribe yourself every now and then- right?!)I bought AM/PM Yoga!

It is excellent for the morning.  However, I did not give the DVD a 5 star because of the PM section.  Too much of it is chanting and singing!  Yes, singing.  Although the music is catchy, I don't really get into the chanting or singing.  Therefore the PM section is less effective for me.  I've only done the night portion 3 times.  The AM part I'm pratcically wearing out!  Matter of fact, I just finished doing it 10 minutes ago!

1758838,5,B00006HAX1,"Thank God for Ravi Singh & Ana Brett, I had thought the worst thing that had happened to yoga in the past decade or so was the DVD until I tried their productions
Their "" Kundalini Yoga for Beginners & Beyond"" DVD is excellent and probably the most popular, but their other productions should not be overlooked. This AM/PM DVD in particular is a real find, in which Ravi & Ana presents 2 -  30 minute sets: one an energizing, enthusiasm building,  morning wake up that hits every muscle, and the 2nd set is a slightly more gentle mode (though the core, arms, and abs get worked). Kundalini Yoga seems to be a well rounded sort of practice that uses the sports-science approach of performing repetitions while hitting deeper levels as well. The exercise  will help keep your body toned and build tone but without pushing too hard. That's not to say you won't be pushed. I break a sweat during the morning wake-up series every time. The workouts also really prep the body for the meditations that follow each set.

As is the norm with Ravi & Ana's yoga DVD workouts it's hard to find fault. The presentation and execution is perfection itself  Its a wonder that the larger companies don't seem to be able to do the same sort of focused works.",1153872000,11,1240,4.517857142857143
1758839,5,B00006HAX1,"I have been practicing yoga regularly for about seven years and found this dvd to be a powerful addition to my practice. It is not like other yoga styles, in that, while it has many similar poses, it adds another dimension with the focus on breathing and continuous movement during some of the poses.

 It is amazingly effective at moving the energy and strenghtening and stretching the body. You will definitely discover muscles you were not aware of before.

 Most, if not all, of the poses are simple enough so that they can be attained by beginners, however, this makes for a vigorous workout that any level could benefit by. The meditaions at the end of the morning and evening sets are also invaluable for all levels.

As with other Ravi and Ana workouts I have tried, the sets are extremely well planned and the instruction clarity, and Ana's demonstration is probaby the best you can find in a DVD.  Beginners may need to stop and start but there's nothing on this one that can't be done by almost anyone.",1153699200,11,1013,4.6
1758840,5,B00006HAX1,"I have been using this DVD on a regular basis for about a month. I do it first thing in the morning. Sometimes I actually do the breath primer sitting up in bed.  By the time I'm done with Breath of Fire, I've overcome the temptation lay back down in bed.

This one starts with some dynamic warmups then segues into an invigorating, challenging, yet emminently doable morning ""wake-up"" series with the breath of fire. It works all the major muscle groups as well as other things that need to be covered every day.  When you are thoroughly worked out there is an amazing meditation to open up all the chakras. I finish this morning routine feeling focused, relaxed, energized and happy. It definitely makes my day go better.

 I like the feeling it gives me that, if I have no other chance to move by body all day, I have already got everything I really need to do covered.

The PM set is designed to help curb the later afternoon/early evening blues.  It's got a lot of ab and upper body work.  The before bed meditation I think would be a great alternative to the meds many of the people I know resort to, to be able to sleep and function.  This DVD is a perfect example of why yoga is so important and popular right now.",1153612800,9,1222,4.324561403508772

I have been doing their Beginners & Beyond and LOVING it! After doing vinyasa for many years I found this type of yoga so powerful and so refreshing.

The DVD is divided into two parts: morning poses and evening poses. Each section is about 25 minutes to complete.

Ana & Ravi give excellent instruction. From what I have seen (and heard!) I have a feeling all their workouts are first rate and plan to gradually buy them all. They warm you up stage by stage and really prepare the body  to receive all the powerful benefits of this yoga.

The first set is invigorating, a series of moves done continuously with the Breath of Fire. It really gets to your core and leaves you feeling centered and amazingly alive. The clarity of their instruction and the flow is exceptional and it is wonderful for first thing in the AM.

The PM section has a few poses that work on relaxation and strengthening and soothing the nervous system. Its a great whole body release for me. I find myslef sleeping like a log after it and waking up refreshed.

I received this DVD as a gift from my wish list, but after using it a couple of times, I would still have purchased it for my own use.",1153353600,15,1324,4.293172690763052

It's very different from the other yoga tapes & classes I've tried, and just wasn't what I happened to be looking for.  I think the tape itself is probably very good, but didn't fit my needs.  I have to blame myself for that because I just read through all the reviews, which were great, and didn't stop to look up what ""Kundalini"" was.

Like that one, this DVD has 2 sets. The AM set starts with a couple warmups and then goes into a non stop sequence, moving thru poses, with the breath of fire. This set gets me connected quickly to my core and leaves me energized and inspired for the day.

The morning meditation which is sort of like a power chant gives me inspiration and uplift.

Doing this workout has helped me substitute green tea for coffee.

The PM set is like a consolation to me. No matter what I go thru all day, I keep thinking about doing the yoga when I get home and I am fine. I look forward to doing it. The PM meditation works better for me then sleep aids.

I like that in both sets you just get down on the floor and go: no endless intros and added fluff. The music is great and  I love the way Ana & Ravi keep your attention focused throughout the workout . Your mind never gets a chance to wander off.

I have gotten great results from this workout. This and their Beginners DVD always leave me muscles worked and a feeling sore which is exactly what I want!

I am really enthralled with this workout. I knew I had to do yoga because I am so tense, tight, etc...but I was worried I would have to give up my sweat fix.

This type of yoga, taught by Ravi & Ana is amazing because you move in the exercises. The first set, the AM set ,sort of goes nonstop for almost 20 minutes, one exercise or pose into the other with the breath of fire. I really felt completely worked over but in a way that refreshed me rather then leaving me too fatigued for the day. The PM set starts with a great Ab exercise. I also do the PM mediation before bed and have been sleeping the night through without waking up once.

Maybe it's because it's Kundalini Yoga and I'm not used to it, but I found it to be a little dull.

The AM set is much better than the PM set.  The PM set didn't have as many poses as the AM set and the poses in the PM set are too long and drawn out.

You would not believe how old I really am but my skin retains its youthful glow and elasticity and my posture and energy level is that of a much younger person.

I recommend doing the AM section still in your pajamas for a satisfying, gentle, yet ultimately invigorating, wake up call. You really feel like anything is possible after this gentle challenge!

But the best part is the morning meditation of Ek Ong Kar Sat Nam Siri Wahae Guru, (One Creator, Truth-Identity, Great beyond description is Divine Wisdom) which is the Morning Call.  It is done about 7-8 minutes.  I will add this to my daily morning practice.  The PM set works your legs by doing a walking on the ceiling exercise, lying on your back and move your arms and legs.  It really works.  The set also ends with a meditation.  I think it was about 11 minutes.  It is the Shabd Kriya.  Loved it.

This DVD contains two excellent yoga practices which are perfect for virtually all levels of yoga practitioners. I have been practicing yoga for several years and am now at an intermediate level, and I will continue to use both of these workouts on a regular basis.

AM Yoga starts with breath meditation to ease you into the gently energizing set that clears your head, lifts your spirtis and awakens the body. I actually do this part right out of bed while still in my pajamas. Its a great way to start the day.

The practice is led by Ana Brett & Ravi Singh,  excellent instructor's who provide flawless cuing, Ravi vocally and Ana visually. Ravi has an extremely calm, soothing voice which is ideal for anyone who is not a morning person! PM Yoga is a very nice practice for releasing the spine,relaxing, and winding down.

The beauty of this DVD is that the workouts are short and easy to fit into my busy schedule.

The AM portion begins with a breath exercise which pumps the stomach and seems great for digestion and elimination(recommend this before breakfast!). Then the AM continues with several stretches and flexes in a well paced energizing set that really wakes up the body and prepares you for the day.

The PM set features a calming breath meditation to start, then a little ab work, an interesting exercise to warm and loosen the spine followed with an exercise for the heart center which gives a great shoulder/neck release which I find I really need at the days end. Overall, PM really winds you down from the day and helps you sleep deeply.

(The first time I tried the PM, I remarked that it would be a happy day for me when I am flexible enough to put my head on or anywhere NEAR my shin in a seated position). That said, I have been doing the AM yoga practice with Rodney Yee for months now, and it is a great introduction for someone who is completely new to yoga. He introduces the poses slowly and it is a gentle workout that will invigorate but not exhaust. There are no times when you should feel you are scrambling to keep up with him, which is not the case with the PM. It's also difficult to do the necessary modified poses if you didn't shell out for a yoga brick, strap, etc. That's another good thing about the AM pose - the belt from a housecoat or something equivalent works just as well for the one equipment assisted pose that's included.",1068163200,3,953,4.129032258064516
1758856,5,B00006HAX1,"I have been using this DVD daily for about a month.  A beginner at Yoga, and 15 years away from any kind of consistant exercise, the workouts are proving to be a wonderful way to get back to working out.  The AM and PM segments each last about 20 min., which is about as much time as I can easily get away from the kids. The AM workout sets a gentler tone for the mornings, and half the time I fall asleep on my mat after the PM section.  The instructors say that a short daily practice is better than one long session a week.  Given the length of these segments, one a day is easily done.  If I miss doing the second routine, I am to the point where I do feel I have missed something of value.
The first week, some of the postures were difficult.  Heck, some of the postures I didn't think I could even get into. I have noticed a marked increase in flexibility and am more willing to try more challenging postures.
I have some other DVDs from Gaim with longer routines, and try to do one of these a week as a bonus.  In a month, my level of comfort in doing these longer, more challenging routines, has greatly increased, in large part because of the short, daily workouts.
I recommend the AM/PM/Stress Relief DVD for those who are looking for a gentle introduction to yoga.  The instructors give clear directions, do emphasize breathing, and make use of props for those of us who do not start out lean, limber and stretchy",1065312000,,1424,4.267657992565056

7968843,5,B00006HAX1,"This review will have a two-part format. In the first part, I'll describe the contents of the DVD as well as my thoughts on them. In the second part, I'll say some more general things about Ana and Ravi and kundalini yoga. It seems the negative reviews of their DVDs come mainly from people who didn't know what to expect when ordering kundalini yoga DVDs -- because they ARE a little bit different from what you're used to, if you've only practiced hatha yoga in the past. I am unabashedly an Ana and Ravi fan, but hopefully my evaluation will help you make the correct decision for yourself, even if your opinion happens not to be the same as mine.

Part I
----------

Like most of Ana and Ravi's DVDs, AM-PM Yoga has the matrix menu which allows you to customize the length of your workout. There are also four pre-set programs of varying length, geared towards morning or evening practice.  All exercises in this DVD are done equally on both sides of the body.

Introduction (1:09): You can watch this if you want to.  It's not necessary to understanding the exercises.

Tune In (2:23): This segment is similar/the same in many of Ana's and Ravi's DVDs; you sit cross-legged, focus on your breathing, and chant ""ong namo guru dev namo"" three times.

Warm Ups (11:02): This segment consists of the following exercises.

*While seated, grind your stomach in a circle
*Hold your shins and flex your spine back and forth
*Hold your knees and flex your spine back and forth
*Roll your head around in circles
*With your legs extended and arms straight in front of you and parallel to the floor, inhale and lean back, then exhale and lean forward (repeat many times)
*Go up and down in frog pose

I have to go a lot slower than Ana in frog pose.  I just do what I can and don't worry about keeping up.  If you are having trouble with the speed of any particular exercise, I suggest you do the same!

Morning Wake Up Series (11:16): You do breath of fire all the way through this one.  If you are not familiar with breath of fire, watch the ""Breath Primer"" segment, which is available from the chapter list and matrix menu.

*Extend your legs in front of you and hold your feet (static stretch)
*Table pose (sometimes also called bridge)
*Stretch pose (lie on your back and raise your head and heels six inches)
*Lie on your back, then bring your legs up, take them wide, bring them together again, and take them down; repeat
*Hug your knees to your chest and raise your head
*Seated, with your hands in a mudra (hand position), have your arms parallel to the ground in front of you and cross them back and forth (with straight arms) over one another
*Hold your arms at sixty degrees
*Press your hands together overhead.

The pose where you hug your knees to your chest may be hard on your neck.  See what you can do, but don't push yourself to the point of injury.  If you need to rest your head or change the angle of your neck to make it through, please do so.  You can work your way up to the full length of time as you get stronger.

Sat Kriya and Relaxation (4:25): This is pretty much summed up by the title of the segment.  If you're unfamiliar with sat kriya, it's easy enough to do an online search.  It would take a long time to explain but videos and images posted elsewhere do a good job of explaining it.  And for the relaxation part, you just lie on your back in savasana.

PM Yoga Set (15:45): These poses are still fairly active but I think that, coupled with meditation, they'll help calm you down at the end of the day.  This set consists of the following exercises.

*Lie on your back and raise opposite leg/arm; repeat other side
*Seated, hold your shins; alternate between elongating your spine and raising your shoulders and slumping back/down
*With hands in front of you and facing opposite directions, hook your fingers together; raise your left elbow, then your right
*Tilt your head back and pump your stomach (go for awhile with the breath held in, then out)
*With your hands clasped in front of you and your arms straight, raise your arms up and down
*Press your hands together overhead
*Meditate with your hands in your lap, palms up

If you've done Ravi's and Ana's ""Yoga for Beginners and Beyond"" with the ""Rise and Spine"" segment, the elbow-raising exercise from the above list will be familiar.  If you're pregnant and very far along, you may not want to pump your stomach.

Deep Relaxation with Gong (4:55): This is similar in many of Ravi's and Ana's DVDs. Lie on your back, slow your breathing, and listen to Ravi.  In some of Ana's and Ravi's DVDs, I find the gong disquieting when paired with certain music.  However, it works as a meditative tool here (there's no creepy music in this segment).

Mantra Chant for Calmness and an Open Heart (5:28): I had a hard time learning the melody for this one but I think I got it after 3-4 tries.  You hold your hands over your sternum and sing:

ad guray namay
jugad guray namay
sat guray namay
siri guru dev a namay

Closing Prayer (2:59): This is similar to what appears in other Ravi/Ana DVDs.

Breath Primer (4:25): Please note that this segment may not play if you just play the entire DVD through. It is accessible from the matrix menu and the chapter selection menu, however. If you are not familiar with kundalini yoga, you will definitely want to follow along here. It's actually a pretty good refresher for anyone who has practiced for awhile, as well. You learn how to do long deep breathing, a panting breath that serves as an introduction to breath of fire, and then a standard breath of fire technique.

AM Breath Exercise for Youth and Vitality (3:42): With your hands in a mudra (hand position), pump your stomach with your breath held in.  Exhale and repeat.

AM Chakra Activation Meditation Primer (1:58): This is an explanation of the AM Chakra Activation Meditation.  I like that it is in a separate segment.  Sometimes I complain that Ana and Ravi spend too much time explaining mantras and it cuts into the time spent doing them.  Here, you can add this to your matrix menu selections until you understand what you're doing, then later skip the instruction and dive right in.  This is useful to watch at least once because the lengths of some syllables in the chant are not what you might otherwise expect.

AM Chakra Activation Meditation (9:19): Say the following mantra along with Ana and Ravi (not sung like usual).

ek ong kar
sat nam siri
wahay guru

Stress Free Breathing Exercise to Release the Day (4:08): Hold your hands in front of you with your fingers meeting at the sternum; have your fingers wide.  Inhale in 8 parts through the nose and exhale in 8 parts through puckered lips.  This seems familiar to me and may be included on one of Ravi's and Ana's other DVDs (Yoga Quick Fixes, maybe?).

Before Bed Meditation (10:20): With your hands in your lap, one on top of the other, and your palms up, inhale in 4 sniffs, hold, and exhale in 2 sniffs.  Ravi and Ana tell you mantras to go over mentally but Ravi says them all out loud so you don't really have to keep track.

For those of you familiar with Ravi's and Ana's DVDs, this is one of the ones with the white background, and dark-haired Ana. I've noticed a lot of the music in those overlaps, as do some of Ana's outfits.  In this one, I am pretty sure I recognized a few exercises/segments from other DVDs, as well.  This DVD has a fair amount of mantra chanting (performed by the participants at home) in addition to the the ""tune in"" and ""closing prayer"" sections.  Ana and Ravi always go over the meanings of the mantras in detail.  If for any reason you are uncomfortable chanting mantras, simply skip these segments.

I always did yoga in the morning, even the PM set.  (My typical practice is 30 minutes long, alternating segments on a DVD for two weeks, then moving on to another DVD.)  The main purpose of my morning yoga is to help wake up through gentle movement, get my mind in a good place for the day, and relieve nighttime stiffness.  Any of the more physical segments on this DVD would be good for those purposes.

In this DVD, Ana and Ravi do not offer a lot of suggestions for modifications of certain poses. I've made a couple of suggestions about pace above.  And don't forget -- you don't have to keep up with Ana. Work at your own pace.

FYI, there is some freeform dancing in the opening credits.  If you want to do that, it's on Ana's and Ravi's ""Dance the Chakras"" DVD.  Also, and I totally don't understand why, but the volume on this DVD is incredibly low.  I am playing it in a run-of-the-mill DVD player and had to turn my TV volume up to be much higher.  It was also very quiet in the DVD drive on my laptop.  So just be forewarned.

This DVD is going to be best for those who like a lot of meditation and breathing exercises.  The physical exercises are good, but they don't seem like the stars of the workout to me.  I like that there's a lot of content to choose from.

Part II
----------

Now, on to a more general discussion of kundalini yoga in general, and Ana's and Ravi's DVDs in particular.

Most of the yoga that people are familiar with falls under the umbrella of hatha yoga. Perhaps you've done a series of static poses, or some vinyasa/flow yoga. Kundalini yoga is not exactly like either of these, although Ana's and Ravi's DVDs do incorporate elements of hatha yoga (e.g., this DVD has table pose in it). However, kundalini yoga is also what I would consider to be a very active form of yoga, consisting of some repeated movements and a lot more work with the breath than you may be used to. It can be difficult to keep up with at first, but can be very rewarding if you stick with it. If you are bored of holding static poses all the time, or if you want a bit more movement but hate vinyasa (sorry, but I am not a fan of flow yoga), kundalini might really work well for you. And, as I said earlier, use the modifications Ana and Ravi discuss if you need to use them. Yes, Ana is fit (and this makes her an excellent demonstrator for the poses), but this is not a competition. Don't strain yourself, and don't try to keep up with her. Just try to improve a little bit every time!

Kundalini yoga also involves a lot of meditation. Sometimes this is quiet and involves breathing either in a sitting position or lying down, occasionally with your hands in a mudra (hand position). Sometimes it involves chanting a mantra. This DVD has some chanting in addition to the opening and closing segments. Whenever there are mantras, Ana and Ravi tell you what they mean. If you are uncomfortable with mantras for religious reasons, check out Ana's and Ravi's website (can't post links in reviews but they're easy to find through Google) for alternatives.

With respect to calorie-burning, this is probably not the sort of program that will make you shed a ton of weight. What it is good for, is improving your mood and your flexibility. And as a physical activity, it does burn some calories and strengthen some parts of your body. But kundalini yoga works on your inner self as well as your outer self, and so some parts are a little less ""active"" than others. For my own part, I still do plenty of pretty intense cardio at other times of the day.

Ana's outfits are a bit skimpy, but certainly nothing less than you would see at the beach. And the reason she dresses like she does is so that you can really see her performing the movements and asanas. That way you know exactly how to position yourself for maximum benefit. (Most of the time, kundalini yoga is done with the eyes closed, anyway.) There is not a lot in the way of initial instruction in this DVD (I like the introductory segment to the chakra meditation, though, and the breath primer could be useful to newcomers to kundalini yoga). If you are familiar with Ana's and Ravi's work, you can jump right in. But if you are new to kundalini yoga, watch it first. Observe Ana, listen to the cues, make sure you understand. You'll be glad for the lack of excessive instruction later -- you don't want to be told on the 20th time you do a DVD how to do any given exercise; you know it by this point!

A few health claims are made in this DVD. Take those that do appear with a grain of salt. I find that Ana and Ravi are quite accurate when it comes to muscular and skeletal issues (like my sciatica). I don't know that I believe everything they say about the glands, however, for example. Perhaps that's my Ph. D. in chemistry intruding. At any rate, certainly don't use yoga as a substitute for seeing the doctor. But doing a routine like this isn't likely to hurt you or make your health condition worse (as long as you PACE YOURSELF).

If you are struggling with a pose, or don't feel there's an adequate explanation, Ravi and Ana are very accessible and quite nice. They have contact information on their website (the URL is on the DVD case) and usually get back to you in a couple of days. They also have a monthly e-mail newsletter that I enjoy.",1408320000,15,13042,4.454774926377787
