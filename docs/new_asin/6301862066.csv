7816142,5,6301862066,"Steber combines well-known standards with lesser known Classical in kinescopic clips.

It is a pleasure to watch her perform with such majesty and respect for the musio in 2012 where such artistry is consigned to fund raising or nonprofit venues only, on TV. Also great ""teaching"" for new singers.

One might not expect to be so moved on something like ""September Song"", but she makes the omnipresent opus something to revisit a couple of nights per week.

Just 52 minutes, which go by very quickly, but the price is nice.",1346630400,,522,4.777777777777778
7816143,5,6301862066,"One of the greatest tenors of the Italian repertoire came from Sweden.  Bjoerling's flawless technique allowed him to have an extensive career with hardly a noticible drop in the quality of his voice.  No great actor, but who really cares.  He sings his program of arias and songs beautifully.  The BOHEME duet with his wife is, well, charming. A regular on the Firestone program and all of the outings are well worth collecting.",1192579200,,429,4.835616438356165
7816144,4,6301862066,"Before most American singers were 'accepted' in this country, Eleanor Steber made her mark with a brilliant series of portrayals at the Met (and other houses) and a fairly large recorded library. Her Mozart singing (represented here by an aria) was pretty much the standard of the day.  Check out her Mozart arias on Columbia records(conducted by Bruno Walter) and earlier selections on RCA.  Once again, mostly light music here but beautifully sung.",1192579200,,450,5.1506849315068495
7816145,4,6301862066,"This is a tape for Bjorling fans.  Although the quality of the camera work and the show itself almost seem primitive by our standards, the voice of Jussi Bjorling is breathtaking.  There are two shows which begin and end with the Firestone songs, ""If I could tell you and ""In My Garden"".  I was very young when Firestone was on but as I recall all the artists were obligated to sing these songs as they were written by one of the Sisters or daughters of Firestone.  It really doesn't matter because everything sounds beautiful when Bjorling sings it.  For his fans, this is a treat because we get to actually see him sing.  As someone who only knows the voice from the records it is wonderful to see him in his prime.

I gave it four stars because it is very old fashioned but those were the times.  If you remember the show you will probably enjoy seeing it again and there is always that superb voice.",1115942400,2,903,4.365269461077844
7816146,5,6301862066,"This is a fine tribute to a great tenor, and will bring back fond memories for a lot of you. Sig. Tagliavini was one of the first post world war 2 Italian stars to sing at the Metropolitan opera, making his debut there 1n 1946. For the next 15 or so years he sang regularly with various opera companies in the U.S.  Those who heard him in person will never forget his sweet lyrical voice that even at mezza voce could reach the last seat in the upper balcony. He made numerous appearances on the voice of Firestone and Bell Telephone  hours. Here we have a fine sampling of his versatility. From American pop to Italian opera Sig Tagliavini brings a sense of style, excitement, and verve. He virtually owned,E lucevan le Stelle and Che Gelida Manina. He was also a fine actor, ""living"" each role he performed, a rarity for opera singers of that time. At home in dramatic or comic roles, just look and listen to ""Una furtiva Lagrima"" and ""La Danza"" for proof. This video is a must for any serious opera fan and a textbook of good singing for the aspiring singer",1023667200,2,1060,4.403061224489796
7816147,4,6301862066,"This is fascinating in many ways...as a historical record, to be able to see as well as hear the magnificent Bjoerling in his prime, and as an example of how much has changed in 50 years.
What long and steady attention spans we must have all had ! This is 180* from the MTV style of camera work...sometimes there's one shot that stays in place throughout the entire aria, and Bjoerling wasn't a singer with ""pizzazz"", but instead exuded a spirit of simplicity and kindness.
The tape is comprised of 2 telecasts, not 3 as the box promises.
From March 1950:
Bjoerling sings Herbert's ""Neapolitan Love Song"", then his wife, Anna Lisa, who had a good, strong soprano, sings Puccini's ""O Mio Bambino Caro"" (from Gianni Schicchi), followed by the beautiful ""Salut, Demure Chaste et Pure"" from Gounod's Faust, and finishing with a duet, singing Puccini's ""O Soave Fanciulla"" (from La Boheme).
From November 1951:
Bjoerling sings ""Ah Love, but a Day"" by Beach, and Richard Strauss' ""Standchen"", Leoncavallo's ""Vesti la Giubba"" (Pagliacci), followed by the orchestra doing Brahms' Hungarian Dance # 1, and Bjoerling ends with Krenzer's ""Prayer of Thanksgiving"".
I have to take a star off for the disastrous packaging...no Schubert, no Bizet's Flower Song, no Leoncavallo's Mattinata...the only thing from the 3rd telecast is the opening and closing, 2 pieces by I. Firestone, ""If I could Tell You"" and ""In My Garden"", which are inserted in the beginning and end of the tape.
They do have the running time of the tape right though...well, almost ! it's 39 minutes long, and it's very special to see this beloved tenor singing, I only wish it was longer !",1006732800,9,1644,4.875
