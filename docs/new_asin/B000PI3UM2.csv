8191688,5,B000PI3UM2,"I love this movie.  I watched it on Netflix some time ago and then again on YouTube.  I ordered it, but it never played in my DVD player.  It had an error message saying it needed a code or something in order to play... not sure what that mean't so it's riding around in my car.  I never got the chance to send it back... oh well!!!",1475712000,,332,3.91044776119403
