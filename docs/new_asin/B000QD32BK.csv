8195713,5,B000QD32BK,This is one of the best videos. I have used this since the 80's there are 2 tapes and level 1 and 2 will get you to the second tape Level 3. I am 58 yrs old and have many health issues and I can modify the work outs as I need to. I joined Nutri System back in the 80's and did very well with weight loss. The work outs have been something that helps me stay active without hurting myself with more strenuous workouts. This is deff my go to video that I know I can still do. .,1476230400,,475,3.712871287128713
8195714,5,B000QD32BK,"I have used this exercise video on and off for 23 yrs.  It is excellent for many different situations ~ I use it every time I am beginning again (after 7 pregnancies, surgeries, injuries).  I also use it when I just want a gentle workout. When my joints are aching, I pop in the video and when I finish, I can move without pain. When I get to a point of needing more of a challange, I put it in a safe place to use at a later time. I ALWAYS feel great after working out with this program!",1400716800,,488,3.919191919191919
