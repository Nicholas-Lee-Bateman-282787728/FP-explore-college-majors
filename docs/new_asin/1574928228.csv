195623,5,1574928228,"This movie should be understood more as a historical love story more than an attack on TJ's charactor. While we will never know the whole truth about his relationship with Sally Hemmings, I think this movie treated it well-- as a true love affair, and as Jefferson maturing over time.",1146960000,,284,4.7
195624,5,1574928228,"I found the movie both enlighting and puzzling. First of all we will never truely know what kind of love Sally and thomas really shared.  Things that are written could have been fiction yet some may be true but we will never know the truth.

195626,1,1574928228,I'm sorry but I watched this movie once and it's forgettable. I regret buying it. The acting was kinda amateurish and Sally seems to have loved her oppressor Jefferson a little too much for my taste.,1509235200,,199,4.555555555555555
195627,1,1574928228,"I hated this movie. It tried to portray the relationship as romantic and consensual when it was really the story of enslavement and sexual molestation (a 70 something year old slave owner who raped and impregnated him his ""property"" while she was STILL in her teens).

Jefferson never EVER tried to free Sally and they Children. infact, it wasn't until 3 or 4 years ago that his black desencends had to get DNA tests to PROOVE to his white descendents that they were familly. The fetishization of this relationship is strong with this one. This was in no ways a healthy and loving relationship. Healthy relationships occur between two people on the same level sharing the power of their relationship- something sally couldn't do because jefferson OWN HER AS A SLAVE.

This movie gave a realistic possibility what could have happen. Some was inaccurate. Sally's  mom was already died when she was living with the Jeffersons.

There needed to be more sexy time with these two in the film.

195690,4,1574928228,"this was a fabulous story and shows the conflict thomas jefferson had between what he said and what he did. gave me a new look at jefferson. also, sally hemings was no slouch, and demanded a freedom paper when in france, where she was considered free. It was the only way she would return with jefferson to the states. you have to decide if this was love on both of their parts (as the movie portrays) or if it was that and something else or just something else. i like to think sally was spunky, and although limited, she had jefferson in a corner. too, he had her in one since she was his slave. the story is full of emotions, sadness, loss, anger, and love. later dna proved the hemings family  is from the lineage of jefferson. very glad we watched this flick. don't know how much can be proved and how much was hollywood, but we enjoyed it a lot. because i like non-fiction and not sure if this was entirely, gave it a 4*. jefferson's daughter burned all the letters he had sent her. most of information was told from generation to generation. however, the jefferson family also admit to this story.",1443139200,10,1104,4.385365853658537

195693,5,1574928228,"Most of the intelligently written reviews are worth considering in your personal choice to purchase this version of ""Sally Hemings"""" Many have truly managed to include the plot clearly to where folks are able to learn from this film while at the same time, being able to research the truth of what happened throughout that entire miserable era.

Consumers today need well written commentary (not wishful manifestos) to gauge whether they are able to follow the story OR are pleasantly surprised regardless of knowing the background.

I would still mention that ""Jefferson in Paris"" is my all-time favourite. I lent this one to my sister, but SHE felt that the story was too slow at the beginning,

Either way, you are getting the quality of the story for your investment. This story is about forbidden love and the courage of love even if that love encountered dangerous societal implications.  I have always found that this aspect of Jefferson's life to be the most fascinating part of his life as he was most courageous to make certain that Sally's life was a life worth the quality which all slaves deserved before and after that time.

I disagree (for others) to over respond that he considered her a slave or was applying a double edged sword on the subject of slavery. He had to play this system to the best that he was able , particularly given the time that America was choked on this superiority idealistic society to justify their greater evil in the guise of ""economic security"". Jefferson protected his relationship with Sally at all costs and never to demean her humanity, but to enjoy the right that they had to love one another.

It's a love story which the typical few care to admit to this day.  Still that not one of us are any closer to how much in love they truly were and what they were up against. Which one of us can ever know the intimate exchanges and words between any two lovers and these lovers were truly up against the worlds they were trapped in.

It's a love story fraught with the arrogance of a society before Lincoln emancipated the rights of these beautiful and abused beings.

As a race of people, Africans had no interest to live in the United States. They never asked to come to America. They were forced, kidnapped, their villages and the leaders of the villages were throated to have entire communities ravaged if the leaders of the villages would not release the very strong and the very durable of their people.

Europe is given Kudos for treating persons of colour without this watershed, heartless cruelty of human beings. This was a very disgusting era of history, particularly in history all over. The British may not have been utterly perfect in their behaviours, but they never behaved as animalistic as the US. Ever.

The exception was that, though the British did not consider these persons of colour akin to their social acceptability, they are given credit for not twisting the fork into their humanity as did the United States and the French was above all outstanding in knowing the difference that people are people.

However, I will always argument vehemently that ANY African nations and villages gladly make ""deals"" and sold their own people. It is as much of a lie derived mostly from the Americans than in any other existence.

The foolish enjoy rewriting fairy tales of how the kidnapping of human beings from this continent was actually and freely acceptable in exchanging such a business with inhumane men of greed and wickedness which has sadly continued in varying forms clearly after emancipation.

The leaders of villages and provinces were not only held at gun point and against their will and were out numbered by a vicious thug of men to take these human beings by force.

The Africans were not as well-equipped with guns and cannons and ships against these criminals who invaded their country and their land, their heritage and their freedoms. Every leader of every community were threatened with war and torture if they had NOT given up the men and the woman that the US wanted to use as backbones and to belittle their rights to humanity by justifying in their minds that what they were doing was just and were even so wicked as to manipulate Holy Scriptures and to twist such to make it applicable and acceptable because of the language barrier.

Everyone of the leaders of the villages, towns and provinces had no choice because the Westerners threatened to destroy what ever they had and threatened to slaughter their infants.

They even wanted children as young as 12 as males (predominately). This era originated against the Africans directly and violently by the Westerners from the very start and to use the same blatant and under educated writers of history to appear as if the Westerners were just the great guys doing good to ""help"" the Africans is appalling as the lies against the Jewish as to how many victims actually died as a result of Hitler's ""Final Solution"" and to deny that the holocaust even occurred is the very same combination and groupings of decades to hundreds of years of re-written and filthy doctored and dishonest history to even utter in their blindness of continued entitlement that ANY African leader would easily make trades with thugs of men with guns and cannons, beatings and murder right on their own lands is utterly and beyond foolishness for any one to believe such trash.and to gladly do business for money to give up their own people to be bedded like animals in ships and left to be thrown into oceans(including women and children during voyages (including pregnant females) who died in such appalling conditions. Africans who were kidnapped and brutalised, snatched from their families as slaves NEVER demanded for any type of ""white guilt"" to be demanded.

Only those who happen to be white spun that neurotic narcissistic belief that any African demanded for any white for payment of their ""guilt"" sounds as psychotic as the people who began such a tale.

ALL that the Africans wanted was their freedom as human beings, they were deserving to their rights to make the money, to work their lands, to not be cheated, to raise their animals and all that was needed to raise their families (and not for the thuggish Southerners to threaten, murder, steal, and prolifically threatened with murder and more theft from their families and to steal all of the land that they rightfully bought and cared for).

The emancipated were of the hardest workers and were not lazy in predominance by a long shot. They wanted to build and designed and so much was snatched from them out of utter and demented hate. Shameful hate and they never needed the white man's guilt. what they Deserved was to be free and to build their own communities with out being murdered or oppressed.

The most heartbreaking of all of this is that the new generation are deliberately taught that Africans (those born here and those who were kidnapped and forced to be slaves) as if they were less than human and are making certain to slander anyone who happens to share that same skin tone.

Most of these so called IVY Leaguers whose claims to have studied this portion of history continues to brag upon the very little understanding that they have that not every brown skin human being were originally or directly from Africa.

Yes, many of the persons of colour were predominately abused, murdered and forced into slavery were from Africa, but it had not stopped there. Along these arduous long voyages, the US invaded other villages, lands and provinces of brown skinned humans and ignorantly called them ""Africans"" because their tormenters largely came from the South and were deeply uneducated and were backwoods from their own heritage of Ammonites who lived in caves and lived as worse than animals. These individuals were monsters.

Not every white family or white society or their family trees have bought into this idiocy. This grouping stands apart as the learned and as those who also deserved to be protected to stand up for the truth that they know true history to be and should always be as protected for standing strong in the way of truth for all. We need more of all races who know the truth to tell the truth and not to be the ""strange fruits"" of followers.

 However the truth must be told about how the leaders in early 1600s to 1700s Africa were not taking part of any ""gentleman's agreement"" in the kidnapping of human beings, but that they were threatened, tortured, murdered and their families were murdered and those who stood against this invasion were killed and many were justifiably frightened (the caps are accidental, please forgive that) UNTIL THEY WERE ALL FORCED TO ELECT ANOTHER LEADER WHO WAS FRIGHTENED BY WHAT THEY WITNESSED THESE STRANGE EVIL MEN FROM THE WEST THREATENED TO DO AND THEREFORE THEY HAD ABSOLUTELY no CHOICE IN THE MATTER. THIS WAS NO EASY LETTING GO OF THEIR PEOPLE, THEY WERE FORCED IN EVERY WAY, EVEN BY THE VERY VIOLENCE OF THEIR PRESENCE.  as these bearded scum murdered and stole whatever they felt they were entilted to and the leaders were under extreme torture, both mentally and physically and paper work was doctored to create it to appear as if these leaders ""happily"" would do business in giving over their people.

There was a language barrier, there was murder, violence, and entire fleets of ships to take over villages , communities and lands and strategised this as if it were an all out war. The US invaded Africa and other smaller lands at that time for no reason except to kidnap able bodied humans do to someone else's work for free. This wickedness has not yet come to reparations as it should have been fully and then some for what this act has created in this present age. There is much more to this, however, this is about the long truth of it all.",1441238400,,9812,4.7558823529411764

195711,3,1574928228,"The acting and production values are very good, Carmen Ejogo is very appealing and does a nice job with the role. The problem I have is that I'm a student of this time in our history, especially TJ and the Hemings family. I think it very unlikely Sally had such deep, sincere feelings for TJ when they first got together, though the script worked hard to sell it. Sally's brother, James, is probably the most accurate portrayal. Neill does a very good job with the lines he's given, but they only occasionally sounded like TJ to me. Sally did take exception to some of the writing in Notes on the State of Virginia, TJ's only published book, and confronted him with it, a good point, though it's unlikely she ever got to see a copy simply because TJ was very secretive and kept all such information from his ""family,"" which is how he thought of his close slaves, the Hemings family that took care of him his whole life. This is a huge story and impossible to portray well in less than three hours of screen time. Still, if you don't know too much about what actually happened you should enjoy the movie.",1425254400,,1103,4.438423645320197

195713,5,1574928228,"This fact based story was intriguing and depressing. It told the story of love, compassion without accountability.

Sally Hemmings grand children were DNA tested and were a match to Jefferson. Her son told the story of his father president Thomas Jefferson, but that doesn't erase the fact that America feels his reputation would be tarnished for having a ""sexual and romantic"" relationship with his African American slave yet, they have no problem with him owning slaves? *palm to face* This movie touched on Jeffersons feelings about being an outcast for his relationship with his slaves, which was a first.

That being said, the movie does a good job introducing the elations, sorrows, political and personal dilemmas that naturally occurred given this taboo romance.

 historical era. I felt it somewhat romanticized the true horrors of this practice.
The movie showed that slavery was so widely practiced among the different classes of white people
at that time, that even our nation's presidents owned slaves. The story revolves around one such president
and his slave. Although this is a difficult subject, it was very well done.

All they said was that during that time and cultural lifestyles, it could or could have not happened.  But they all said she did stay to the very end.  In the movie the mansion looks huge, but in reality it was smaller, but the area was beautiful just like the movie.  I would recommend this just to get an idea on how they lived back then.

195752,3,1574928228,"I've seen this movie on tv and enjoyed watching it, but was offended by the title.  Sally Hemmings was a 14 year old girl having sex with a 49 year old man, and she was his slave at the time.  The idea that she really had consent is laughable.  Did she maybe admire Jefferson because of his power....perhaps?  Who knows how she really thought of herself in this context as his slave.  But to make it seem like they must have had a wonderful love story because she was with him until his death is suspect.  This is a hollywood fantasy!  Sally had little choice to leave and may not have run away for the sake of her children (even though her light skin and european features may have made it easier for her to pass as white).  In the system of slavery - blackmailing your slave to stay is not an strange concept.  She was a woman trapped in her time and probably figured she had to make the best of her circumstance in order to survive.  Interestingly, there is an attitude in American culture that is loathe to truly discuss the events of slavery. Instead we seem satisfied with an ""overview"" of what happened....picking cotton in the hot sun, children sold away from their mothers.... But their is another glaring aspect of slavery that is quietly tucked away and usually not mentioned.  African women descended mostly from West Africa where people are very dark skinned; were raped on slave ships, plantations, etc.  The fact that so many Black Americans have light brown to nearly white skin is evidence that this violation occurred often and for a long period in American history.  Sally Hemming's mother was half white and her own father was a white slaveowner.  In the Americas - the African dasphora is very mixed genetically.  In fact, it doesn't take much thinking to realize that over time some of the enslaved were gasp....genetically more white than black! But as time passes it is evident that many modern day Americans are simply clueless about the prevalance of racial mixing during that time perioed and haven't made the connection as to why Black Americans come in so many shades. They are ignorant of this other side of slavery because it is not taught in any detail in American schools.  At least this movie gives a window into the fact that rape occurred, as in the case of Sally's sister Critta.  Plus the ""seduction"" of Sally is shown to happen in her teen years (statuatory rape) by modern standards.  However, I still don't buy the idea that Sally was really in love with Jefferson.",1301702400,4,2506,4.6058558558558556

195757,5,1574928228,"Excellent history done as believable as this type of story can be done. It is a part of the American past, long hidden, and only proved in 1998. A president, Thomas Jefferson (Sam Neill) lives with his slave, unwed, mistress, openly at times, fathering several children through Sally Hemings (Carmen Ejogo) but never quite takes responsibility for the children. Today it would be as scandalous as it would have been, or should have been then, but...

Ejogo does a magnificent job of presenting Sally through all of the emotion and hardship her life held. Good times and bad, Sally was the rock her children needed, and the woman President Jefferson wanted. Of course much of the time they were together, Jefferson was not President, but often politically active. He at least did give the girl, Sally, her freedom early in their relationship, in Paris. Sally first became an active mistress to Jefferson at that location, while just a teenager and maid to Jefferson's daughter, Patsy (Mare Winningham). It was a 38-year relationship that actually continued as Sally cared for Jefferson's grave until her own death. It is a love story. Not a Christian example but sincere love in a bi-racial relationship at a time when it was unacceptable. It leave the viewer the task of deciding ethics.

Definitely enough historical record to make this worthy of watching for every student, suggested for ages 12 and over. A DVD value at today's price for the historical content as well as entertainment excellence. The only negative was background musical scores were loud enough it was sometimes difficult to catch all the words of the actors, and subtitles or CC are NOT included. The box warns of violence and profanity...correctly. When dealing with period slavery in a realistic fashion, that is expected.",1267056000,29,1796,5.003344481605351
195758,5,1574928228,"I saw this film when it was first released on CBS and had to have my own copy.  The acting is wonderful--very passionate and very charged.  Carmen Ejogo brings the silent suffering of Sally Hemings to the screen--through her somewhat tumultuous relationship with Jefferson; the loss of children and dignity, and living through the terrible contradiction that is slavery itself.

Sam Neill does a fantastic job as Jefferson. Wanting what he wants (as do most Americans) yet not in the position to make any changes and if I may argue, lacking the necessary character to do so. It is interesting though that Mr. Neill accurately portrays the increasingly blurred line between slave and wife for Jefferson who manhandles Hemings in a scene when he thinks she may be involved with another slave. To which she replies: ""you don't have to hurt me you own me"". Of course, both a spouse and a servant wereconsidered a form of property in the time period of the film and you sometimes wonder--debates on the accuracy of this film aside--which he considered her more to be over the course of 38 years.

beyond this, the supporting cast is outstanding.  Dihann Carroll is excellent as Sally's strong willed mother.  Klea Scott as Critta, Sally's sister gives a testament to the heart breaking sexual abuse suffered by slave women.  Rene Aberjenois shines however, as the utterly evil reporter, James Calendar who exposes the affair.  Superb.",1264809600,5,1429,4.949790794979079

There so are many children conceived between slave women and their masters, there is no way to count them all, but genes do show up within families hundreds of years later.

195762,1,1574928228,"I was very interested to find this DVD, as this is a fascinating episode in American history.
Sadly, it is just a made-up romantic tale that completely distorts and ignores the known facts and - outrageously - invents things that we know did not happen just because the story would have been better if they did.
One simple example exposes the whole pile of rubbish: throughout the whole thing Sally Hemings is at war Martha, TJ's daughter. The grand denouement comes as the climax to the film when, right at the end, with TJ dead and buried, the cruel and vicious Martha threatens to sell Sally. Sally then produces a letter from TJ that gave her her freedom way back in Paris all these years ago. She has not stayed because she was a slave, she has stayed for love. This is rubbish. This never happened. It is a straightforward lie. Jefferson, to his eternal disgrace and shame, did not ever free Sally. It was, in fact, Martha who behaved with generosity, dignity and compassion towards Sally after TJs death. The daughter clears up the father's mess. Again.
This is sloppy, lazy, self-indulgent film-making and bad, bad history. As is the scene where Sally is abducted, stripped and whipped. There is absolutely no record of this ever having happened and it is not a part of the full and detailed Hemings' oral history. They just made it up to shock the viewers. There were lots of bad people around then, doing lots of ugly things. We don't have to make stuff up. To do so is an insult to the real people who suffered real pain. If they want to make a soft porn romance about a mixed race master/slave relationship that's their choice. But don't call it history.",1253232000,41,1666,4.575250836120401

195777,2,1574928228,"I have to give the filmmakers credit for bringing to light a story that, for so long, historians rejected. We now know that Thomas Jefferson did indeed have a 30-year relationship with Sally Hemings, his slave (and wife's half-sister). The dialogue is bad, costuming not particularly accurate, and the actors pretty bad. All that can be overlooked.  What is problematic to me is that the story, as presented here, is largely fictional.

First, the actress playing Hemings was entirely too, well, black, to be accurate. Sally Hemings was only 1/4 black and described as being ""mighty near white"" by Edmund Bacon, Jefferson's overseer. Change her clothes from servant/slave gear and one would likely have assumed she was white. We have no knowledge that Sally Hemings could write, let alone read and the movie has her reading and writing in English and French. Given that Jefferson encouraged education and learning music, we have no reason to assume she could do either. And while we know that she had the opportunity to stay behind in France and be free, there is no indication of the drama between herself, her brother, and Jefferson, nor did they flee paris due to an angry mob attacking his home. There is a disturbing scene in which Jefferson all but rapes Hemings in Paris, something we have zero documentation of (and frankly, would be WAY out of line for Jefferson's character.) Also, as the writers are trying to convince the audience that this is a love/companionate relationship, this is a godawful way to do it. We have no facts that prove that Sally was pregnant when she returned home from France (that story was largely concocted by Thomas Woodson, who claimed to be the long-lost first son of Jefferson and Hemings and has since been proven not to be ) Madison Hemings, in his memoirs, refers to a child that was born about 1790 but did not live. Paris is simply the place historians assume the relationship started because Madison Hemings said so in his memoirs. The entire story about Hemings and the slave Henry she was in love with and supposed to marry was a fabrication, as was the rape/whipping scene in the barn. These are two of my least favorite scenes in the movie because they were written purely to tug at teh viewers heartstrings and not to give them any sort of basis in reality. Finally, Andrews assumes a love relationship between Jefferson and Hemings. None of this is documented anywhere at all. After doing very extensive research on the subject, I personally believe that it was a companionate relationship, but one largely based on Jefferson's odd quirks and beliefs (see Death and Desire at Monticello by Andrew Burnstein).

I am all in favor of historical fiction - but real historical fiction takes the facts and makes a marginally fictionalized account, not just for entertainment value, but to gain the public's interest in the truth. This film has created a piece of fiction using real characters. That's just not the same as historical fiction. It appears that Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History (by Fawn Brodie) and Barbara Chase-Riboud's Sally Hemings: A Novel were both read by the writers and they skipped over the academic stuff entirely - a huge mistake.

I have watched this movie several times, in different years, and at different points in my eduation (I'm doing a Master's in American History) and my opinion of the film sinks lower every time I watch it. I support the movie's purpose, but not actual product. So, if you're looking for something entertaining AND accurate, try reading any of Annette Gordon-Wood's books, Death and Desire at Monticello, Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia (the sections that relate to slavery), and Joseph Ellis' Thomas Jefferson: The American Sphynx.",1222992000,13,3750,4.910094637223975
195778,1,1574928228,"The smug postscript at the end of this mess of a movie makes brief mention of the 1998 DNA testing as a way of vindicating everything which has gone before.  While the DNA tests (combined with a preponderance of historical evidence) makes it almost certain that Thomas Jefferson was the father of Eston Hemings, the tests are as important for what they disprove.

Among other things, one claim conclusively disproven was Jefferson's paternity of Thomas Woodson, which renders the entire Parisian chapter of this movie a complete fiction.  It goes downhill from that point, with the narrative implying an extended correspondence between Jefferson & Hemings (there is no evidence that Sally Hemings was even literate), that Hemings was involved in some naiscent Underground Railroad (again, who knows?) and that Sally Hemings pops up unannounced at the White House one night (was it really that easy for a slave to travel from Charlottesville to Washington DC undetected?) to kiss & make up with ""Thomas.""

In between all of these historical improbabilities, we are subjected to pontificating of the first order.  Nothing kills romance faster than speechifying.  It ends up being a lose-lose situation: bad history combined with some deadly-dull romance.  Ugh!  Once it became clear where this was going (in the first 30 minutes, really), I should have quit while I was ahead.",1221091200,14,1374,5.157657657657658

Although I strongly suspect there was a real relationship between Jefferson and Hemings, this story is taken way over the top for entertainment's sake. The entertainment value is certainly there, but it is so strong that one can be easily swept away by it into the realm of belief.

An alleged ""historian"" once publicly stated that he ""wouldn't let history get in the way of a good story."" As a fan and writer of fiction, I can understand his statement. However, as a lover of history, I bitterly resent his idiocy.

History, itself, is a great story. But when the need for dramatic presentation leads that story far afield from the facts, it should never, ever be presented as real history.

I absolutely recommend Sally Hemings: An American Scandal as a romantic fantasy with a historical setting. To say that it is more is to do an injustice to both the Jeffersons and the Hemings, who are inadequately represented here.",1215820800,63,1031,4.846590909090909

195784,1,1574928228,"I have seen this atrocious piece of work now twice and I didn't like it any better the second time.

Its good points are: a mostly credible job of re-creating Mulberry Row and the first version of the 'big house' at Monticello (points deducted for having TJ's bed in the alcove in the first house, for Sally having her own room in the house, and for the slaves cavorting on the West Lawn.) Nevertheless the scene setting was mostly good, as are costumes (except Martha Jefferson Randolph's, which were atrocious.) Females are wearing caps, small children of both sexes are wearing frocks, etc. Huzzah.

Its bad points: terrible overacting on all parts, terrible script (kill the scriptwriter, who evidently knew nothing of Southern society and speech in the period), implausible and historically inaccurate comings and goings (Sally riding in TJ's carriage alone, tricked out like a lady, going to Washington and showing up at the President's house, James T. Callender meeting SH on the road, Tom Woodson's entire existence - for those who don't know it, the Woodson connection was proved a falsity by the DNA evidence)

And this doesn't even cover the basic error: the DNA evidence only shows that SOME Jefferson (one of eight possibilities) was the father of ONE of Sally Hemings' children; the DNA testing was done on the descendants of TJ's uncle Field. Those who have here complained of the fabrication of a love-match would be right in that; there are rare exceptions to the general 'convenience' of a Negro concubine, but they are rare indeed. In the whole of VA history since chattel slavery was introduced in the early 18th C (blacks were free before this and could be landowners) there are only three or four examples.

From all the books I've read about the Sally Hemings & Thomas Jefferson affair, from author Barbara Chase-Riboud to ""A President In The Family"", this movie is very accurate and focuses on Sally Heming's experience.

I love this movie.  Its scope includes the time just before Sally accompanies Maria Jefferson to Paris until Thomas Jefferson's death in 1826.  It was quite entertaining to watch the envy in Martha Jefferson Randolph (portrayed by Mare Winningham) as she realizes the relationship between her father and Sally.

I only wish that a movie had been written about George Washington, his mistress Venus, and the incestuous craziness going on at Mount Vernon.  America's not ready for that yet.",1200614400,3,789,4.984732824427481

195789,3,1574928228,"of President Jefferson and his concubine/slave Sally Hemings, there remains a rather usual story of a widower who transfers his well-known affection for his young deceased wife to her equally beautiful sister.  Sally Hemings and Martha Jefferson were half-sisters and it was said that they looked rather alike.  Sally came to Monticello with the marriage of Martha to Thomas Jefferson.

It is easy to point up the hypocrisy of Thomas Jefferson, the author who wrote so eloquently of freedom in the Declaration of Independence while denying to others, but initially Jefferson did seek the end of slavery in the 13 colonies.  During the days of the Continental Congress he urged the abolition of slavery as part and parcel of the newly created United States, but was persuaded to drop the cause when the southern states threatened to bolt and withdraw their much needed support in the inevitable clash with the the crown.  Following the Revolution Jefferson no longer persued abolitionist ideology

As a person ages, they often become more conservative and careful in their beliefs.  This was true of Jefferson.  He also held a strong belief in NOT concentrating or centralizing the powers of the government but rather to give the greater authority to each State to govern itself in the newly formed confederation.  Although Jefferson's ideas would give way to Madison and the Federalization of the states; many still cling to the idea of decentralized government; the south in particular used this dictum again and again during the civil rights era in order to maintain their segregationist laws.

What can never be known is the true nature of the relationship between Sally Hemings and Jefferson.  Sally Hemings was Jefferson's property and with no personal freedom or rights.  We know that Jefferson instructed Martha Jefferson Randolph, his daughter by Martha Jefferson, to free Sally & her children upon his death.  Many speculate that this was based on his love and affection for this steadfast woman with whom he shared much of his life and by whom he had a number of children.",1187568000,97,2082,5.052631578947368
