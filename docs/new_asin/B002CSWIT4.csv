8386845,2,B002CSWIT4,"After waiting for FIVE years for a new live album, this album is pretty disappointing.

I would understand that Yanni would like to experiment with vocalists and add words to his old music - but only if he was making like a new album every year or two.

But after five years of waiting for him to release a new album, only to have him regurgitate his old instrumentals with some lyrics. That is very far from impressive.

Besides, his strength was in his heavenly music, not songs and lyrics. So he weakened him image by taking this course.

I just hope that it wouldn't take him five more years to make another live album. His Concert Event album was his best. We can only hope that he would try to make something as good in the future.",1282089600,2,737,4.318840579710145
