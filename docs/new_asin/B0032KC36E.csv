8387524,5,B0032KC36E,"I rate this documentary with 5 stars NOT because I felt the producers answered all the questions or offered insightful commentary. But I felt that they DID ""prime the pump"" for the public to start to carry on informed discussions of the unintended consequences of our increasingly ""connected"" lifestyles.

I've been an Educational Technology consultant for 20 years--helping to install some of the infrastructure shown here as well as training teachers and students to be able to do things ""intentionally"" and not get sidetracked by every temptation. In the end, that is the real problem. How do we train children and employees to use self-control and to be deliberate in how they conduct themselves while wearing several hats and bearing multiple responsibilities?

Even with my background, this presentation provided a excellent quick review of the state-of-the-art in all aspects of the networked technologies we use to work, study, fight wars and goof around. Don't try to understand the strengths and merits of each gadget or system shown here; just try to become well-informated as to what each of them can do and how some people use them.

Two major ""dangers"" loomed to the foreground as I viewed it:

First, many students might not learn how to concentrate on and take thoughtful notes during ""lectures"" by teachers or professors. This was a problem 40 years ago without the Internet and it is still a problem. But students today can totally zone out during boring lectures. The solution (in my mind) is to make all lectures optional. Just let students walk out without penalty or stigma. At the same time, make as many lectures as possible so beneficial that those who attend will go away feeling privileged and special.

Second, it appears that many students might not learn how to read book-length materials--especially fiction. (Non-fiction is just a series of short articles thrown together almost randomly. Such collections are easy to read in short spurts and to resume after interruptions.) But well-written fiction requires long-term memory, internal dialogue and speculation, suspension of disbelief and many other mental processes that are impossible without long-attention spans and full concentration.

Yet neither of these dangers are automatically realized through the technologies as they are shown in this documentary; nor is it proven that they cannot be addressed using digital means. Two other threats are discussed by the producers but left unresolved. Specifically,is multi-tasking good or bad? And, does the digital abstraction of ""fighting"" while not actually being personally at risk on the battlefield help soldiers fight more effectively or tempt them to fight less ethically? Both of these are good questions that need consideration.

Finally, the documentary also raises the question of ""where"" each person should go to ""get"" his or her moral values. The program unintentionally implies that values just ""emerge"" from the chaos of growing up. It seems to suggest that all we have to do is ""think"" about them a bit more during the process and everything will be OK. I don't buy that. That's what Spinoza did and it led him to deny even the existence of ""values"" per se. (See my review on ""Spinoza's God"" by Frank Dixon.) No, I think this documentary realistically suggests that random moral training produces randomly moral citizens. And, contrary to what some faux-statistical wits say, ""random"" ethics do NOT have a 50/50 chance of being beneficial to either an individual nor to society.",1278374400,9,3526,5.186291739894552
8387525,5,B0032KC36E,"This was definitely a very eye-opening and informative documentary (I love PBS). We live in a world that is immersed with technology and stimulation, more so than at any time in the world's history (that we know of anyway). This technology is developing extremely quickly and a lot of the far reaching affects are still unknown to us.

I'd like to start off by mentioning that the Digital Age has brought a significant amount of benefit. Advances in medicine have changed surgeries and treatments that were at one time extremely invasive into outpatient processes. Certain Military Personnel are now able to complete their jobs while being thousands of miles from combat, lowering human risk (as in the case of the Air Force Drone Pilots, a subject investigated in this video). Human connections which may have never had the opportunity to blossom in the past are now able to turn into incredible relationships (many people have met their spouses online as well as some other friends, I personally know several people who are in happy marriages and they met their partners online). As you will see in the documentary, some argue that immersing students in technology increases attendance and skills and also decreases violent incidents.

All of this being said, there is a flip side. There is research into decreased attention spans as a result of this over-stimulation. There is also research into multi-tasking and though it sounds great, it may not be all it's cracked up to be (this is covered in the video). There are uncountable numbers of online distractions and addictive MMRPGs (massively multiplayer Role Playing Games like World of Warcraft). A specific example of online distractions spiraling out of control is the South Korean government's special camps to get kids off of their internet gaming addictions (which apparently has become quite a significant problem, even reported deaths as a result).

There is, of course, the ongoing argument about video games contributing to violent behavior in adolescents as well as adults. Interestingly enough, video games are being used by the military for recruitment, which I didn't know before watching this.

This is a very worthwhile documentary, I'd highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.",1273795200,8,2252,5.144808743169399
8387526,5,B0032KC36E,"This was one of the more sad and sobering documentaries I've watched in a long while. Much of it focuses on children and how steeped in technology their lives have become. In one extremely sad segment, young South Korean Internet addicts are filmed at a ""detox"" facility, trying to learn how to be kids again because Net gaming has taken over their lives. The director shows them learning how to jump rope and go outside to play in the 3-D landscape. Most look like they are being tortured by having to pry their fingers away from their keyboards.

Another segment examines the in-class behaviors of both grade school and college students. I had no idea that children are routinely allowed to bring both cell phones and laptops to school and use them while the teacher tries desperately to convey information. Rachel Dretzin interviews one vice-principal who seems to be spending his days monitoring students' Internet surfs during class. This clearly begs the question, is it really such a terrible idea to teach kids how to pay attention to one thing at once instead of 5?

One high-schooler from Chatham, NJ, proudly boasts that he can't remember the last time he's read a book. He's shown referring to an online version of Spark Notes for Romeo and Juliet, as he simply ""doesn't have enough hours in the day to read the whole thing."" He seems quite pleased with his ""accomplishment"" of having ingested the summary version in less than 5 minutes. No doubt the demands placed on him by Facebook, Twitter, You Tube, and MySpace are so onerous that he has no time to consider the pedestrian words of one of history's greatest writers.

I'm about the same age as the filmmakers, and so can keenly grasp their ambivalence despite all the gilded promises of the Information Age. As old, cranky, and out-of-touch as we may sound, it's tough to be middle-aged and have known another way. Life used to have much more time in it. Much more serendipity. And much more pleasure. Relating the majority of our time to a machine has made us, as a society, much colder. More calculated and pragmatic. We want exactly what we want, and we want it NOW.  Just as technology serves our every whim, we expect people to do so as well.  Is this really in our best interests?

While trying not to be xenophobic toward these new ""natives"" of cyberspace, the filmmakers aptly put their finger on the pulse of the times and how cyber-immersion may ultimately impact us. Highly recommended.
