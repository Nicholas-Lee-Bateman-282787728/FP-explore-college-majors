7786019,5,B01HDHA98A,"Seventy-seven minutes of pure impurity.
I, purty-much, can promise you, with a TITLE
like ""BUBBA THE REDNECK WEREWOLF"",
you're gonna get what you expect. It's sorta
like TEENWOLF; except the love-struck pup
is a love-struck, middle-aged, loser that is
thrown into a hero-capacity when The Devil
went down to redneck heaven lookin' for souls!",1487376000,5,341,5.333333333333333
7786020,4,B01HDHA98A,"Bubba The Redneck Werewolf is a wild, fun and low brow comedy ride.  Beyond that this movie has heart, charm and a catchy soundtrack.  This is definitely worth a watch if you like offbeat Horror or irreverent Comedy.  The DVD has some good bonus features including a behind the scenes doc and two videos on how the special effects make up was done.",1485216000,7,348,4.492063492063492

Review-Todays lesson in life is  be careful what you wish for. How many of us ever wanted to be better than we are? How many of us wanted a second shot with our ex? Welcome to the film Bubba The Redneck Werewolf. Bubba Blanche is a good ole boy, a small town backwoods redneck whose life revolves around drinking cheap beer, and worrying about things like his hair loss and his ex. Bubba is one of those guys like Tucker and Dale who mean well, but times have got him down because of his Bobby Jo with another guy. When Bobby Jos current boyfriend feels that Bubba is paying too much attention to her, he goes outside and punches him in the face. Bobby Jo wants Bubba so badly to stand up for her and to him, but Bubba does not like violence. After this incident is over, Bubba is left with what little pride he has left and says the wrong thing at the absolute wrong time. Sure enough, here comes Satan himself to make Bubba a deal to win back his love and be a hero to his town. Satan turns him into a werewolf, but the cost of this is his soul. As soon as that deal goes down, Satan looks around the area and sees more souls that he can win over for granting their wishes as well. Soon, Satan has taken over the whole town and it is up to Bubba to stop drinking and trying to win over his love to fight for his town.

Lets start out with the positives about this film, it is very low budget. I feel that gave the director so much freedom to be creative and really have fun. If there is nothing else you get out of this film, fun would be the one thing you will leave with. This film constantly winks at the screen, as most of the jokes and situations in this film are so odd but yet very tongue firmly in cheek. The second positive was the script by Stephen Biro. ( Yes, that Stephen Biro) The humor in this film for the most part is hit or miss. Not all comedies will hit every joke perfect, especially in low budget fare. Some of the situations in this film were so goofy that you wonder why no one thought of that before now. Like a scene which I will not spoil that involves a group of zombies. I will be honest some in this film are just insane. Like the nun who is getting pleasured by Satan. The fact that Satan is walking around the town and no one thinks anything different, they act like he is a local at times. People will assume because there is a werewolf in the film that it is going to be like Wolfcop. I felt the humor in this film reminded me of a Tucker and Dale, and a reference to Beverly Hills Cop thrown in.

The negatives to this film, some of the jokes are misses. One in particular that went a little bit too long involving Bubba and the person he was looking for in trying to find the devil. You know this film is going to have that battle of good vs evil, I just felt the idea was there, I just wanted a little bit more out of the final battle. Though some of the dark humor of that scene really helped me like what they did give me. The biggest shock to me, I thought going into this film that they would throw profanity or nudity to make the humor work. In reality, this film could get a PG 13 rating and it did not hurt the material one bit. This film did not have to go overboard to get its humor across, or throw a ton of nudity trying to hide its shortcomings. This film has flaws, but this film is also very fun. There were several times watching this film that I felt the dark humor was just so odd that I laughed and questioned my own sanity. Another positive is that they used a bunch of unknown actors and actresses. It really gave the film a more personal feel. In 2016, where everyone will convince you that bigger is better or  Hollywood is the ticket. I am here to say, Bubba the Redneck Werewolf shows you that smaller films can deliver just as much and do it more smarter than the done to death formula that the multiplex gives you.",1475539200,13,4188,4.077669902912621

7786035,4,B01HDHA98A,"Fairly well done.  good acting and story.  the lighting and sound were good.  Extremely silly at times, but entertaining.",1527897600,,121,5.2631578947368425
7786036,4,B01HDHA98A,"One of the dumbest movies I have ever seen, and I love it! This movie is unapologetically stupid and it knows it, but what would you expect a movie about a redneck werewolf would be. It's goofy and never once takes itself serious. The searching montage does drag a lot of time and it falters a little bit near the end but it's still a fun movie. All you have to do is shut off your brain, grab some moonshine, and enjoy!",1526688000,,420,4.134146341463414
7786037,4,B01HDHA98A,"Not bad at all, pretty funny.  It starts out slow, but after he's a werewolf, it gets fun!",1525046400,,90,4.0
7786038,3,B01HDHA98A,"A pretty well executed, schlocky, B-Movie bonanza. The story was well written and easy to follow and it never took itself to seriously, always aiming to be over the top and silly. I would say I can tell alot of these actors aren't pros and some of the performances are cringey, but I can deal with it because I know how tough it must've been to get as many people as they did to be dedicated enough to get this project done. It is what it is, a bit of cheesy fun to sit back, switch off our brain and enjoy.",1521244800,,507,4.02970297029703
7786039,5,B01HDHA98A,"Like someone else said the title says it all.  It's a stupid movie, but you will laugh for an hour and a half watching this movie, and that's what movies should be; entertaining.  And please WATCH this movie, as there are all little things, like the redneck search engine on his computer, throughout the movie to add to the laughs.  I will watch it again any time I feel like smiling",1518220800,,383,4.366197183098592

7786061,1,B01HDHA98A,"Sorry, I was hoping for a true cult classic but for my purposes it was just a bad, cheapo movie. A couple of my favorite movies in this genre are: Tucker and Dale vs Evil, Evil dead 2, Fido, The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra and Psycho Beach Party. I don't care how cheap a movie is but it needs to make me believe in it and Bubba alas just seemed like a great title with next to no content behind it. Again sorry, I was really rooting for this one and for meit just didn't deliver the goods.",1497657600,4,487,3.979591836734694

8765109,1,B01HDHA98A,Nothing even remotely scary about a werewolf in overalls sitting in a bar getting drunk. Nobody even seems to notice that the dude is a werewolf. HORRIBLE!! I'll add it to my growing collection of LB BADS. For some reason I like the LB BADS and often seek them out. This was a good add. LOL!!,1538006400,,292,4.232142857142857

If anyone is hessitant Id suggest first seeing it through amazon prime- we watched it so many times I had to buy this DVD! Fun, funny, a genuine lark.  Bubbas a werewolf with a good heart and not too many smarts. This is the best movie Ive seen this year. Well done and doesnt take itself seriously.  Pure fun!",1533859200,,386,4.2465753424657535

8765114,5,B01HDHA98A,"Bubba The Redneck Werewolf is without a doubt one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. This movie is so stupid and hilarious. It's based on the comic book series by Mitch Hyman, who also plays the Devil in the film. Bubba is so lovable, and he's adorable in both his werewolf and human forms.

This is a terrific movie. It's super funny, and I totally recommend it.",1532044800,,367,4.397058823529412

Not good enough to be entertaining, and not bad enough to be funny.",1529539200,,147,3.933333333333333
8765117,4,B01HDHA98A,"The movie started and I immediately thought, ""This is going to be horrible.""  But it quickly got better.  I thoroughly despise stupid movies such as those Jim Carrey and Will Ferrell tend to make.  That's what I expected here, but I was wrong.  This movie really surprised me.  It was dumb but fun.  I feel there is quite a difference between stupid and dumb.  Slow in a couple of places, but the fun made up for it.  I actually laughed out loud a couple of times which is rare for me.  This is certainly no A list movie, but you don't feel like you lost over an hour of your life that you'll never get back.  I watch a lot of movies where I make liberal use of the fast forward button to get past dull slow parts like the common driving down the road for twenty minutes or partying for thirty minutes.  I watch enough to know the characters and then skip to where the movie really starts.  I never touched the fast forward button during this movie.  I'd watch this one again.  So glad Mitch Hyman is making a sequel.",1529280000,,1017,4.229166666666667
8765118,1,B01HDHA98A,I see all these 5-star ratings and I REALLY gotta wonder about that. My opinion was this was garbage and I can understand how some folks could maybe enjoy this BUT how the hell is this ever worth 5 stars in any sense?,1528502400,,217,4.069767441860465
