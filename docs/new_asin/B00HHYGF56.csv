8632868,3,B00HHYGF56,"I have the other 2 Chthonic dvds and they're mind-warpingly heavy black metal with subtle chinese folk overtones, with a sick guitar tone mixed louder than anything else in the mix, as it's mandatory for the genre. and they rule, bigtime.

The gig is just a 42' slot on a taiwanese festival, shot at an open-air stage with very good pic and a gazillion camera angles. In that regard it's way better than their previous releases, but that's the only improvement. The band's sound has veered to a way more folk-oriented sound, ditching every black metal element except maybe the drumming and vocals. Jesse's formerly sick guitar tone and style has been replaced for an iron maidenesque one, complete with harmonies and intricate solos and what is worse, WAY low in the mix, to the point of being inaudible on the songs that have a traditional chinese orchestra backing the band.

Keyboard riffing, which were formerly sparsely intercalated and just a complement to confer the sound a bit of a sympho air, are now predominant. The singer's voice is higher in the mix too. Now they make Dimmu Borgir sound like Gorgoroth in comparison. I understand a band's sound evolves and respect that, it's just it doesn't cut it for me anymore. I miss the shredding so much. Glad I got this for free.

In the guise of bonus, there are some fantastic videoclips (24') and a lot of pointless interviews, esp. withe gorgeous model/bassist Doris but they're hardly band-related.

If you love sympho/folk metal, get this. If you want a black metal dvd, look elsewhere.",1411862400,,1548,4.80827067669173

8632870,5,B00HHYGF56,"Chthonic is an awesome band and I was eager to get this DVD. But I'm a little disappointed by the fact there is only 10 songs in this concert and 2 of which are simply an intro/outro. Compared to previous DVD releases from them they had 20 in each of their DVD's. Though this release does contain way more extras then I thought, which makes up for it kinda.

Amazons product information about this DVD is missing information about this. Everything that Is included is here:
Live concert which spans 42:55 in time.
Music videos for 5 of their songs: Supreme Pain For The Tyrant, Sail Into Sunset's Fire, Next Republic, Set Fire To The Island, and Defenders Of Bu-Tik Palace.
Making of the music videos for  Supreme Pain For The Tyrant, Sail Into Sunset's Fire, Defenders Of Bu-Tik Palace.
Interview with Doris Yeh and director Vince Chuang
Formoz Afterwords (pretty much their comments and feelings towards the concert as a whole)
and Chthonic fashion where they talk about their clothing and things that inspired their current outfits and from before etc.

They also included English subtitles for the concert when Freddy speaks to the crowd, the Doris interview, the chthonic fashion/formoz afterwords and the making of the music videos which is a really nice touch.

Overall I am pleased with this DVD and would highly recommend it to any Chthonic fan old and new.",1398297600,,1366,4.8
