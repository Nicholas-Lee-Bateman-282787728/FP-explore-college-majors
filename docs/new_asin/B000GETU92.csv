2605989,5,B000GETU92,"One of the best shows on TV! Always piques my interest and keeps me wanting more, a week is too long to wait for the next episode! Probably the most fun and action on television! The special effects, plot outlines and the acting make it all worthwhile! Can't wait for season 3 to come out on DVD!!!",1192752000,,298,4.245614035087719
2605990,5,B000GETU92,"Unlike most documentaries on the paranormal, which seem to present various opinions without any criticism, the Is It Real? series dares to ask if what they're investigating actually has any evidence to back it up.  It's more like the kind of journalism people used to do before everything was spoonfed by authorities, only in this case they ask various skeptics, special effects people, etc. if there are any alternative explanations.  In the episode on ghosts, for example, they send a ghost hunter to an allegedly haunted house to see if he can identify the ghosts that are supposed to live there.  Also, some special effects people recreate a video of an alleged ghost with a piece of glass and an action figure.  I show this in a critical thinking class and the students seem to enjoy it.  Overall, it's nice to see a documentary series that dares to ask the unfashionable question, Is It Real?",1191628800,25,898,4.767741935483871
2605991,4,B000GETU92,"This series has just a tad too much blood for my taste... it verges on horror, here and there, which bugs me; I even like super-violent action movies just fine, but the brutally slaughtered recent corpse thing (more 'personalized' violence than killing bad guys) is not my style. This is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.

Aside from that detail, I find this show totally addictive. The brothers make a 'buddy movie' effect, and the whole supernatural framework creates a sort of non-religious yet definitely spiritual effect (the big mystery being why these guys never ever are seen praying in the show; I have actually known people who had a lifestyle similar to what the show depicts, and that is central).

Not to mention the young men being so passionate, powerful, strong, yet sensitive, darkly troubled from the past, sheer SEXY it's nearly intoxicating over the long run of many episodes. ;-)

Anyway -- the show has an actual plot, it's well filmed and intelligently done and is well worth watching. I recommend it.",1175385600,4,1026,4.785310734463277
2605992,5,B000GETU92,"I thought that Supernatural would just be another Sci-Fi thriller, but then I started watching it and was surprised to discover that there is real plot line and character development. I think this show is wonderful and would recommend it to everyone.",1174003200,3,250,4.976190476190476
2605993,5,B000GETU92,Everyone seriously needs to sit down and watch this series.  It is full of action and surprises!  The stories are phenomenal and I am totally hooked!  I purchased the season 1 dvd and have purchased the digital season 2 to hold me over until the dvd comes out! Please take the time to watch the series and then definitely BUY IT!,1170374400,5,329,4.360655737704918
2605994,2,B000GETU92,"Two programs on 1 disk. First up is UFO chronicles, this program runs for 61.24 minutes. Covers stories from Roswell to Crop Circles, alien intervention, contactees, and ufo encounters. There are a couple of stories I found hard to believe especially the people who claim to be from another planet. Overall, interesting enough even though one or two stories are crap. The second program Ghost stories presents investigative reports, eyewitness accounts of the supernatural. A few interesting stories especially the one about the train crossing. This programs runs for 42.57 minutes.

The video quality is very poor, definetly not transferred from the original film source, definetly transferred to dvd from a video tape. How quality like this can be released on dvd is a crime. Dvd is supposed to give us the best quality print. I have a copy of this on video which I bought from the UK, titled Roswell and UFOlogy files. My copy on vhs is much better than the dvd. The audio is Dolby 2.0, could be better.

Extras, what a joke. There is a silly trivia test, a campfire story, Remedies and a story on Sightings which is very hard to read, all this is text. Overall, transfer 1/5, audio 1/5, Extras 0/5. Final word, check it out on video, you might be surprised that the qaulity is better than the dvd, Madacy Entertainment, should be entered in the hall of shame.",1092441600,,1363,4.746835443037975
2606005,5,B000GETU92,"Supernatural is my favorite television show on TV right now. I'll be the first to admit that I was skeptic when the show first came out. I mean it's a Post-Buffy world and genre television hadn't been to hot as of late. But there's just something about Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki that is electric when they're on the screen together. You can feel it in the air, the drama, the suspense. The writers are fantastic and the show runner/creator Eric Kripke is brilliant beyond his years. Vampires, Witches and Demons aren't for everyone but I'd definitely recommend to anyone. This is one of the highest rated shows on the CW and it definitely shows.",1204243200,2,653,4.6869565217391305
2606006,5,B000GETU92,"I only found this show a month or two ago, but I am already caught up to the third season.  I had to go back and watch all the previous episodes :D",1204243200,,147,3.59375
2606007,5,B000GETU92,"Supernatural just keeps getting better.  I found the first season to be just interesting enough to keep me watching, but the second season has really got me hooked!!! I hope the networks are smart enough to keep it on, I would really miss this show if it wasn't on! Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki really nail these characters!",1203811200,,329,4.672413793103448
2606008,5,B000GETU92,"This show surpasses the 'just entertainment' genre. It has you cheering, hissing at the villains, (really), and impatiently waiting for Dean's next wise-A** comment.  Ergo, ""I shot the Sheriff.""  Dean, actually trying to fight it, but it takes over and out it comes, ""Yeah, but you didn't shoot the Deputy.""  What ever you do, don't let go of this show. Don't let it get dropped for any reason.  This is a true cult hit. Take a look at what's on right now.  There is no comparison. The characters, the writing, everything is superb.

2606009,5,B000GETU92,"`Supernatural' has opened my eyes to the wonders of what television can really be when everyone works together to create something wonderful. And it most definitely leaves me full of wonder. The interaction of the two Winchester brothers with their love-hate relationship. Their total commitment to one another in life-and-death situations. And their unconditional love for one another leaves me wondering how on earth a single show could have such an impact on my soul.
 I'll just say this. 'Supernatural' has heart. Despite everything those boys go through;  in the end, they will never give up on one another. No, it's more than that - they would die for each other.
Have to give credit to the writers and directors for doing their part in making this show what it is. BUT Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki breathe life into the 'Dean' and 'Sam' characters. So much so that you get drawn in with them every minute they're on the screen.

Now if that's all there was to the show, it would still take precedence over 99.9% of the stuff that's out there. But that's only the beginning. And that's why I have to say that this show has been truly inspired. As I see it, Jensen and Jared as Dean and Sam are the meat and potatoes of this sumptuous meal. For the desert we get...evil creatures, bad guys, innocent (and not-so innocent) victims that Sam and Dean are always ready, willing and able to help, both guns blazing, - and demons - lots and lots of demons. Demons that are not only after Sam and Dean's bodies but their souls as well. Makes for very compelling watching. And I, for one, have pulled myself up to the table, knife and fork at the ready.",1203811200,2,1655,4.58445945945946
2606010,5,B000GETU92,"This show started off incredibly and just keeps getting better and better.
The one word to accurately describe this show is bad*ss.

Highly recommended.  And on a side note, these downloads work great on my Tivo",1203465600,,211,4.833333333333333
2606011,5,B000GETU92,"I love this show! Being a total Buffy the Vampire and Angel fan, I was at a lost when both series ended. Supernatural gave me something to look forward to every week. The characters are witty and charming. The story lines are exciting and well written. I look forward to the CW keeping theses guys on for a very long time!",1201478400,,322,4.295081967213115
2606012,5,B000GETU92,"The Show is addictive, really, watch a few episodes & you will be hooked.
Every single one of these Episode's are Great!!!
I have bought Season 1 & Season 2 in the Boxed DVD Set.
In every Show there are turns & twists that no one expects to happen at all, done with just enough Comedy to make it even more Great & of course the never ending action scenes!!!
I think with the Strike going on I am going to have to get these as single episodes cuz it's hard to tell if they are going to complete the rest of the Episodes for this Season.
Thank you Amazon for having these singles. Supernatural Fan Forever!!!",1201305600,,606,4.188034188034188

2606014,5,B000GETU92,I often saw previews for this show and thought I should watch it sometime.  Well I caught one and realized I needed to start from the begining.  Now I can't stop watching it.  Thumbs up to the creator of this show.,1198195200,,214,4.170731707317073

Every episode has been on point from season one to now. I haven't watched season 11 yet, but I'm trying to find a way to do so. I can't believe I didn't start watching it when it first came out. Supernatural is not your average TV show. Since season one I never laughed so hard, or cried that much in my life. Sam and Dean are just so inspiring and the funny comments Dean make....Omg I am just so in love with this movie!!!!!",1463702400,,571,4.153153153153153

8131137,4,B000GETU92,"The GOOD

This set of DVD contains 2 discs. Disc 1 consists of 2 episodes. They are: Ghosts and Stigmata. The 2 episodes on disc 2 are: UFOs and Crop Circles. ""Ghosts"" is the most interesting show. The producers presents a balanced view by interviewing both the skeptics and believers. They even hired a professional ghost hunter to find who was the ghost in one of the haunting houses. They also interviewed a psychology professor from England who was conducting a research on this subject.

Scientifically, their conclusion convinces me.

The BAD

There is no subtitle. Consequently, in some scenes, I can't correctly spell the name of the people.

In short, this documentary film deserves 4 stars. I will use it to back up my argument on this subject later.",1341619200,3,760,4.815384615384615
8131138,4,B000GETU92,"I really enjoyed this show and I liked that each episode focused on a particular subject for 45 minutes. The subjects range from Hauntings, Crop Circles to Ancient Astronauts, UFO's to Vampires and even Jack the Ripper. Each episode attempts to view both sides of the subject talking to skeptics and pro-""fill in subject"" and scientists alike to get a more focused understanding of what it is about.

In my heading, I wrote ""approach with caution"", and this is mostly due to the show's contradictions. But this happens when you watch the show in consecutive episodes. For instance, when I watched the crop circles episode, it seemed to have a bias against the fact that there is nothing paranormal about them and demonstrated when a team who does them ""professionally"" set out 5-hours to make one (and succeeded!). A few episodes later, it covered UFO's and showed similar crop circle pictures, some of which we know were man-made. Yet, because the show wanted to ""investigate"" whether or not they exist, did not even mention these people who made the crop circles.

In another episode on Jack the Ripper (which for some reason the narration was muted while the music was too loud), I found this a weird subject, because he does not fall into the ""is it real?"" quotient. Clearly he was real, but whether any one knows who he is, is another question all together. Its a not a paranormal event, just something that is unsolved.

The show does not answer much in the way of new information, but rather builds off of popular legends about said subject and hearing opposing points of view, with a leading narrative, you eventually determine which point of view you like best. Some of the investigation left me feeling like the shows producers know they have nothing to offer, but weave the information well enough to be more entertaining than investigative and informative.

Does it make it a bad show? No, not really. It's a lot of fun and there is some stuff that I did not know about some of the topics which made it intriguing (like what the issue about Bermuda Triangle is - or ever seeing the original footage of bigfoot - both myths I grew up with, but never looked further). On the other hand, some things seem go against another episode so it kind put holes in the show. But definitely worth getting regardless (I know I sound like I am flip flopping). Just enjoy it on its own merits and you will be rewarded!",1323043200,3,2414,4.646370023419204
8131139,5,B000GETU92,I love this show it hits all aspects of what a show should be in order to keep your attention.  I have all 1-5 seasons and waiting to get season 6 to add to my collection. With all the reality shows flooding the TV this show is a welcoming change.,1296432000,,247,3.94
8131140,5,B000GETU92,"Love this show, and not just because Jensen Ackles is so incredibly gorgeous!

Sci-fi with humor.  It will freak you out half the time, and the other half, crack you up.  The rapport between the two makes you feel they really are brothers.

I highly recommend :)",1207353600,,262,4.51063829787234
