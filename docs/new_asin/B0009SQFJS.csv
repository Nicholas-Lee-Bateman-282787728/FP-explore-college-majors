8066266,5,B0009SQFJS,WE WERE AT THE BATTLE OF FRANKLIN THIS PAST SUMMER SO I WANTED TO AQUIRE MORE KNOWLEDGE ON THIS BATTLE.  I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DVD FOR THE PERSON WHO REALLY IS INTERESTED IN CIVIL WAR BATTLES.  THE DELIVERY TIME  WAS GREAT .THE DVD WAS IN VERY GOOD CONDITION!  I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY TO EVERYONE.  I LOOK FORWARD IN DOING BUSINESS IN THE NEAR FUTURE WITH THEM!,1406246400,,383,4.492753623188406
8066267,5,B0009SQFJS,"I frequently write about the Civil War and am particularly partial toward the Western Theater; nevertheless, I confess that actions in Tennessee are among those which I least understand.

This DVD is a superb production, although I am cautioned by another review here which details the severe slanting of information presented here. This caveat must not be ignored. The destruction of Hood's army begun here and fulfilled at Nashville is Shakespearean tragedy which demands a careful accounting. Unfortunately I feel the state of Tennessee and her citizens over the last many, many decades have preferred to forget as much of this history as they could, or at least to forget as much of it which was so unappealing to them, which is, frankly, most of the history which unfolded here.

It's rather astounding to imagine that this Southern army could blindly dash itself to bits at Franklin, and then repeat that suicidal activity in Nashville, although in the broadest strokes this is the history which seems to have occurred. One feels that certain critical information is missing; I at least feel that way.

Nevertheless, as I said, a superb production: highly recommended, and thought-provoking.",1395446400,,1197,5.15979381443299
8066268,5,B0009SQFJS,"This is an excellent documentary regarding The Battle of Franklin, and is likely the best there is. My hat's off to Robert Lee Hodge. I recommend it to any and all who are interested in this battle in the slightest; it is as informative as it is captivating!",1364688000,,258,4.395833333333333
8066269,4,B0009SQFJS,"The black and white filming and ""combat camera"" look and feel to the battle reenactments make this a treat to watch.  Good background information presented as well.",1266710400,,164,5.074074074074074
8066270,5,B0009SQFJS,"Franklin: The Battle that should not have happened
The DVD ""The Battle of Franklin-Five Hours in the Valley of Death"" is an excellent recreation of that bloody fight.  Based loosely on Wiley Sword's The Confederacy's Last Hurrah, the DVD attempts to explain why and how the battle took place in a thumbnail format.  It is not a definitive account of the battle but a rather well done overview.  The actual battle is recreated using reenactors to show the horrific nature of the fighting and to give the viewer a better understanding of just what and how things happened.  Excellent use of actors speaking for the long ago dead to give the viewer a ""feel"" for the overall sadness that permeated that Indian Summer day of 29 November 1864, when the last light of the Confederacy all but flickered out.
One of the best documentary films about any historic civil war battle.
Strong recommend for anyone interested in the Civil War, particularly the battlefield aspect.  The film is approximately 65 minutes long and does an excellent job of giving the viewer a concise overview of what led up to the battle and the battle itself.  Again, this is NOT a definitive account of the battle, but for anyone interested in the Civil War it will give you the flavor of that conflict.  Outstanding Civil War reenactment-very realistic.",1261440000,2,1321,4.81858407079646
8066271,5,B0009SQFJS,"Wide Awake's The Battle of Franklin is their best documentary yet. Wonderfully edited, the dvd details the botched Confederate opportunity at Spring Hill which led the Army of Tennessee into virtual slaughter in Franklin. Touching are the little told and tragic tales of General Patrick Cleburne, cut down by a Federal bullet as he charged into the fray, and Tod Carter who was mortally wounded within sight of his home. The imagery and first hand accounts bring to life the ill-fated battle, the men who fought it and the citizens who weathered it.

8066272,2,B0009SQFJS,"The film is a marvelous visual and audio production, but from a historical perspective, there is no balance whatsoever.  The writers of the film seem to have adopted the historical interpretation of the Battle of Franklin from Wiley Sword's highly subjective and fact-filtered book, The Confederacy's Last Hurrah.  Sword set the standard for selective disclosure and historical concealment in his otherwise eloquently written award winning book.

The name ""Hood"" is mentioned 54 times in the 68 minute production, making him the most prominent character in the film.  Although the film relies heavily on verbatim quotes from Battle of Franklin veterans and others, of the 58 total quotes in the documentary, the oft mentioned Hood is allowed only three quotes.  One quote concerns his relationship with his fianc, which is unrelated to anything else in the film, and the other two quotes are followed immediately with derisive comments from the narrator.

The film states that Hood conspired to replace Joseph Johnston as commander of the AOT.  The film doesn't reveal that William Hardee, AP Stewart, Leonidas Polk, and Joe Wheeler also disapproved of the retreating tactics that cost Johnston his job. Hardee wrote to Jefferson Davis in June 1864, ""If the present system continues we may find ourselves at Atlanta before a serious battle is fought.""  Hood wrote similar letters, yet he is the only Johnston subordinate accused of backstabbing his superior.

The film's writers only included quotes from Hood's critics, while concealing words of support and admiration for Hood from both Confederate and Union veterans, as well as Confederate governors and presidents.  Pvt. Sam Watkins of the 1st Tennessee Infantry wrote of Hood in his memoirs, ""He (Hood) was a noble, brave and good man, and we loved him for his virtues and goodness of heart.""  ""We all loved Hood; he was such a clever fellow, and a good man.""  ""Every impulse of his (Hood's) nature was to do good and to serve his country as best he could.""  No such comments appear in the film.

Hood is portrayed as a commander who preferred frontal assaults, when in fact Franklin was the only frontal attack Hood ever ordered as a commander.

The film paints Hood as a cold and ruthless commander, saying he ""bled his boys"" in Virginia when witnesses recorded Hood openly grieving for his men at every one of his previous battles.

Regarding the Tennessee Campaign, Spring Hill, and Franklin, the film gives many quotes and testimony from characters, but silences Gen. Hood completely.  He recorded the reasons for his decisions in his Official Reports and memoirs, but the film censors him.  Hood wrote in his OR, ""I learned from dispatches captured at Spring Hill, from Thomas to Schofield, that the latter was instructed to hold that place till the position at Franklin could be made secure, indicating the intention of Thomas to hold Franklin and his strong works at Murfreesboro. Thus I knew that it was all important to attack Schofield before he could make himself strong, and if he should escape at Franklin he would gain his works about Nashville. The nature of the position was such as to render it inexpedient to attempt any further flank movement, and I therefore determined to attack him in front, and without delay.""

At Spring Hill, many Confederates held Hood blameless for the Federal escape, yet the film states that Hood ""allowed"" the Union army to escape. Franklin veteran S.A. Cunningham wrote in 1893, ""...the march to Spring Hill, where the Federal retreat was so nearly cut off, a failure for which it was understood General Hood was not to blame, created an enthusiasm for him equal to that entertained for Stonewall Jackson after his extrordinary achievements...The soldiers were full of ardor, and confident of success. They had unbounded faith in General Hood, whom they believed would achieve a victory that would give us Nashville."" Such testimony is absent in the film.

At Franklin, the film outrageously says that Hood ""sacrificed"" his men, when many veterans-Union and Confederate-supported Hood's decision to attack, but like others, they too are silenced.

Perhaps Hood's performance in the Tennessee Campaign was best summarized by Tennessee Gov. Isham Harris, who accompanied the AOT on the campaign.  Harris wrote to Jefferson Davis, ""I have been with General Hood from the beginning of this campaign, and beg to say, disastrous as it has ended, I am not able to see anything that General Hood has done that he should not, or neglected anything that he should have done which it was possible to do. Indeed, the more that I have seen and known of him and his policy, the more I have been pleased with him and regret to say that if all had performed their parts as well as he, the results would have been very different.""  Like other Hood supporters, Harris isn't quoted in the film.

The final words of the documentary include, ""At Franklin, it (the Army of Tennessee) had almost wrecked itself in an attack that should never have been ordered.""  Union veteran L.A. Simmons of the 84th Illinois wrote that at Franklin, ""He (Hood) was playing a stupendous game, for enormous stakes. Could he have succeeded in breaking the center, our whole army was at his mercy.  In our rear was a deep and rapid river, swollen by recent rains- and to retreat across it an utter impossibility. To break the center was to defeat our army; and defeat inevitably involved a surrender, and Nashville was at his mercy, and could be taken in a day. His army well understood that they were fighting for the possession of Nashville. Ours knew they were fighting to preserve that valuable city, and to avoid annihilation.""  Although the battle was a tragic and decisive defeat for Gen. Hood, the decision to attack was not without justification.

If the documentary was intended to be purely entertainment, it is successful; if the intent was to educate, it has only given one side of the story.",1181260800,16,5968,4.946946946946947
8066273,5,B0009SQFJS,"I am probably a little biased considering I took place in the reenactment in which they filmed many of their shots. When I saw the finished result I was very impressed. They brilliantly captured the horror of the battle of Franklin, and showed why it was truly the valley of death.

  They also give you a very good look at the men who fought this battle. By taking excerpts from letters and eyewitness accounts, you see the battle from the fighting man's perspective. You also see why this battle may have been the most horrifying battle throughout the entire war. I would definitely recommend this documentary for any history buff's collection, or for anyone wanting to learn more about the Civil War.",1126051200,18,703,4.745901639344262
8066274,5,B0009SQFJS,"This is Wide Awake Films most recent documentary project and their best to date.  They have reinvented the documentary after Ken Burns did the same in the 1990's.

The style and storytelling of this DVD is superb and will make a welcome addition to your Civil War library.  The Battle of Franklin is one of the most compelling chapters in our Civil War Between the States.  This DVD will help you to learn about this tragic battle.",1117670400,11,431,4.558441558441558
