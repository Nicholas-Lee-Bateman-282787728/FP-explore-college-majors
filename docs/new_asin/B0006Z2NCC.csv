2197294,1,B0006Z2NCC,"Let me first state that my one-star rating has nothing to do

with the film itself, it is a rating of the DVD. I truly

consider this film, ""Riri Shu-Shu no subete"", to be one of the greatest works of art ever created in the cinematic medium. I own the Japanese DVD (both the normal and collector's editions), and the British edition as well. I was happy for American audiences when I saw this was finally coming out on DVD in the USA, but I have changed my mind after finally getting my hands on the disk. It is simply awful. The video transfer is ghastly to behold, and as if this weren't bad enough, the audio is even worse.

What can the DVD producers have been thinking? Here we have a

film that is utterly glorious to behold, and even more glorious

to listen to, a film where the music forms an extremely important

part of the whole, and all we get is this crappy disk? The whole

thing looks like it was filmed through a vaseline-smeared fog

(while the original is digitally crisp and clear like a spring

morning), and the music sounds as if is coming from a battery-driven cassette-player that has seen much better days. It makes me sad to the point of weeping, and very angry inside. It is totally disrespectful to the art and care that went into the making of this amazing film. I hope that the cast and crew will never see or hear this edition - I'm quite sure they would be devastated to see how their work has been ruined by the hands of others.

Fortunately, I have the perfectly produced Japanese disks to go

back to. Even the European edition, although far from perfect, is much, much better than this travesty. I confess that I only bought this, because it contains the Japanese ""making-of""

with subtitles, because the Japanese original doesn't have any

subtitles and my Japanese is not much good. I was glad to be

finally able to view the ""making-of"" feature with the needed

subtitles, but here again there was disappointment: why, oh why,

did they have to cut 20 minutes out of this excellent

documentary? I could hardly believe it, because there is no obvious reason for the cuts.

I am going to try my best to forget that this disk exists. It

really hurts to know that many people are going to see this film

for the first time in this edition. It is a thought that makes

me incredibly sad, because this is a film I dearly love, and would like everyone to see in its full and splendid glory.

The Ether has been polluted.

Here's a translation of the first of Lily's songs in the film,

translated from a Japanese translation of the Okinawan:

2197295,5,B0006Z2NCC,"This is a film that takes a lot of risks, and break a lot of traditional film rules for the sake of creating something that simply wouldn't work any other way.  It's a film about childhood,  and the loneliness of the times in which young people are still trying to decide who they are.
The structure of the film is bizarre, and it requires the viewer to fall into rhythm with it, but it is very rewarding if you do.  The film is, rather than an arc of story, simply a collection of vignettes - various moments from the children's lives put together out of order in flashbacks over 2 years.  The film centers about a young boy Yuichi who retreats from the world into the music of his favourite singer (A fictional Lily Chou Chou - kind of a cross between Tori Amos, Bjork, and Fiona Apple, with a dash of goth thrown in), and hosting his own internet chat room devoted to her.  I say it centers, because it does orbit around that center spiralling out through the course of the film introducing a myriad of characters as the social fabric changes, and friendships shift.  At times it seems to wander, especially through the middle third, onto bizarre tangents - there is no explicit direction, no clear single story that these vignettes are telling.  The common thread helping to tie things together is a constant stream of comments and conversation running on the internet chatroom - because this is where the children (with the anonymity the internet provides) actually open up to each other - that is constantly intercut into the film.  But all the scattered pieces slowly begin to fall together for what is a truly powerful last forty five minutes.
The strength of the film is its terrible honesty.  It's scattered elliptical style makes the film far more real because, mirroring life, it doesn't have a single purpose, or a main plot - it simply unfolds, flowing and shifting as it goes.  Iwai, the director and writer, pulls no punches.  He is quite willing to explore vicious social interplay as children try to find their place in the social order.  And is just as willing to admire, and dwell on the simple innocence of so many children.
The internet conversation in the film is derived from real internet chat - the director simply logged vast amounts (the film was originally an online novel), and again, this reality and honesty lends the film remarkable weight.
If you get any chance to see this film, just go.  Don't hesitate.  I can't promise you'll like it - it is a very daring film.  It takes a lot of risks, and in my opinion they all come off flawlessly, but others may disagree.  What I can promise you is that the film will stay with you for a very very long time.",1037923200,6,2685,4.539419087136929
2197296,5,B0006Z2NCC,"This is a film for anybody who's ever been a teenager who has used music to escape from the cruel world of people who just don't understand... it's also for anybody who's been on an online bulletin board music fan site... (yes, that means half of you guys who are reading this...)
I have to admit, this film is a little slow, and somewhat confusing, to start with... I'd also read heaps of reviews saying how great this film was, and about an hour into it, I was starting to question this... as I suspect were the three or four people around me who had gotten up and left by this stage... but I stood (well, sat) my ground and sat through the two and a half hours, and it was more than worth it...
Sometimes funny, but always balanced with a sense of futility and depression... this is the essence of the film, and this is what life is like for the fans that are brought together online by Lily Chou-Chou's (a fictional J-pop star) music (something remeniscent of Portishead or Bjork)... a boy who is tormented by his ex-best friend-...-school bully, but it too scared to fight back, despite the damage that is being done to his other friends, and struggles to keep his sanity through his adolescence. People will probably completely disagree with me here, but AALCC kinda reminded me of Degrassi High, with a Japanese setting, a cooler soundtrack, and (arguably) somewhat grittier and depressing.
Oh, and if you watch this, keep in mind that the timeline does jump around a little.",1029801600,3,1482,4.575187969924812
2197326,5,B0006Z2NCC,"Simply put, this is a new favorite of mine. It's gone to the top of my list, and will for surely stay there for quite some time.

Everything about the movie is fantastic. The acting, the directing, the story... Especially the use of light and natural beauty. Really, somehow Shunji Iwai has conquered the impossible: he's captured some of the most beautiful images I've ever seen on film. And the best thing is, those images have meaning. The film's other highest point is the soundtrack: it's absolutely amazing. Of course, there's the instrumental music here and there, which is high quality, but the REAL meat of the soundtrack is the songs from Lily Chou Chou, the singer Yuichi worships and finds solace and peace in (despite his wretched life). The tracks we get to hear (I think there's only about four or five) are just amazingly... beautiful. They're so poetic that it's hard to describe, but Lily's voice is so... magnetic and strong. I could listen to the tracks over and over again and not get bored of them AT ALL (they're that absorbing).

The movie shows so realistically growing up is, and to quote the dvd cover, it's ""viciously"" honest, and they're not lyin.

If you want a true visual and emotional masterpiece, don't dare miss this film.",1143763200,2,1257,4.730593607305936
2197327,3,B0006Z2NCC,"That's 5/5 for the film itself and 1/5 for this edition.

First off, this is one of my favourite movies, and while it's not for everyone, I would recommend it unreservedly, because if it works for you then the payoff is tremendous.

However, I must warn against this Home Vision version for a first taste of the film.  The transfer to DVD in this version is so awful that it goes beyond mere misjudgement, and debate continues about how Home Vision -- a company with an excellent track record with Asian releases -- could have allowed its release.  These aren't subtle differences only noticed by fanatics and cinemaphiles; they're huge.  It actually looks like it was booklegged from a theatre with a hand-held handicam.  But apparently it wasn't, and that's scary.

With regard to the video, the least serious problem is digital artifacting and loss of detail caused by squeezing a 2.5-hour movie plus special features onto a single DVD.  That's a marketing decision, and somewhat understandable.

What's not understandable is the incredible graininess that has somehow been introduced into the film.  Or the great reduction in contrast and brightness -- the vivid colours of the original were a trademark, yet now everything looks like it was filmed in late afternoon on an overcast day.  Even the colour balance has been changed, so that skin tones have a greyish-blue look -- there are no pure whites left (another trademark).  And finally, the picture actually shakes -- this is most noticable during the many scenes of typed text.

For most, this would be bad enough, but for me, the audio is even worse than the video -- the worst attempt at dynamic compression I can remember hearing in a film.  Yes, the parts that are supposed to be quiet are way too loud, and the parts that are supposed to be loud are way too quiet, but most annoyingly, whenever there's a song playing it sounds like there's some 5-year old kid rapidly flicking the volume knob up",1142208000,12,1961,4.7804154302670625
2197328,3,B0006Z2NCC,"Both the one star and five star reviewers here have some valid points and my advice to potential viewers is to read a number of each first. The more you know going into the movie the more you will enjoy it.  You may also want to view the ""making of"" special feature before watching the film. (I was sorry I hadn't.)  This may sound odd, but learning the background helped me greatly in ultimately understanding and (after the fact) appreciating the film.  For me, the weak parts of the movie were the confusing (or little or no) plot and the tendency to keep the characters at arms length.  The film's strength was its compelling visual appeal (except for the hand-held, fast-cut ""vacation"" sequence, which added a measure of realism while, ironically, obstructing intimacy).  Worth watching.",1132099200,,792,4.837037037037037
2197329,3,B0006Z2NCC,"When I was younger, I couldn't stand it when reviewers spoke about the importance of caring about characters. That just seemed lazy. Now that I'm much, much older, and have thousands of movies under my belt, I totally understand it! It's the crucial issue with this movie. This movie is a combo of a Japanese sensibility and even moreso the European film style of ""Postcards from a Marriage"" or ""Fanny and Alexander."" There is no plot, just self-contained ""postcard"" scenes involving a general set of young Japanese teenagers: spring break on the beach and the girls met in town don't show up, sensitive boy getting beaten up by some bullies when riding his bike, teenage boy finding himself attracted to his friend's mother during a sleepover, girl getting raped in a banal fashion on way home from school and tells no one. None of these threads are picked up: they are isolated. The handheld cameras and makeshift lighting are evocative and brilliant. Some scenes are nearly perfect, such as the ""going to your first big concert"" and ""the popular girl publicly humiliates the nice girl and the teacher does nothing."" We can be deeply touched emotionally. That said, and I am a teacher of teenagers, I'm not sure how much I ever cared. Teenagers are subject to instant nostalgia: they can wax nostalgic over a spring break trip six months earlier as if they were but kids back then. But I don't do that anymore. Yes, my heart bled watching some of this stuff, but without being allowed by the film to connect to the characters in any narrative fashion, I couldn't help simultaneously admiring the film and BEGGING for it to end.",1129766400,5,1629,4.759717314487633
2197330,5,B0006Z2NCC,"Although this movie can be a bit confusing as it hops around in time sequence, it is really poignant and worth watching.  It focuses on Japanese youths and the troubles that they face in the world today.  Much different than anything you might see in an American teen movie, it is much darker and surreal.  A young boy who drowns his sorrows in the music of Lily Chou-Chou, a Japanese version of Bjork, struggles with everyday life--and not just your normal teenage angst, either.  This movie deals with rape, violence, depression, and so much more.  You have to really want to understand this movie to enjoy it...be in the mood to relate to others and really get into the characters, because it is not a light movie.",1120694400,3,717,4.6141732283464565
2197331,5,B0006Z2NCC,"It should be understood that the situations depicted in this film find their beginnings in what has become the increasingly dismal sociological reality of contemporary Japan. Iwai has choreographed an amazingly fluid storyline that is neither cliched nor far-fetched. Despite complaints that the film may be perhaps too long, too graphic, too pretentious, too incredulous, I find it to be near perfection.

The visuals are stunning and the storyline sophisticated. The Iwai/Shinoda collaboration succeeds where Kar Wai/Doyle collaboration in recent years has become excessive and tired.",1119398400,4,586,5.813953488372093
2197332,1,B0006Z2NCC,"All About Lily Chou-Chou squanders beautiful cinematography and an interesting framing device (the narration occurs via the typing of a message board) and creates a truly unwatchable cinematic experience.  Why?  There are no characters to care about; no story to be interested in.  This is a trainwreck of a film.  I will attempt to describe what remnants of the plot I understood.  A fourteen-year old boy, Yuichi, who is obsessed with the singer, Lily Chou-Chou intensifies his penchant for deliquency as he and his friends become intrenched in bullying, pimping, and theft intensify.  The story lacks a compelling arc, mainly because Yuichi and his buddies lack personalities- which is from where my main complain from the film derives.  I can forgive boring, interminable films, but what I can't forgive is exploitation masquerading as art. All About Lily Chou-Chou egriously depicts teen violence as the product of vicious gangsters- not the insecure, vulnerable, and quirky kids you and I recognize as teenagers.  There is no humanity in this film, just a piddling kind of sniveling sense of condemnation and exploitation.  Disturbing events occur, and there is no reference made to them for the rest of the film.  In one brutal scene, the main character, Yuichi is brutally beaten  (near to death) and forced to masturbate.  In the next scene, he doesn't have a scratch and is again friends with his abusers.  Another appalling juxtaposition is the way a young 14 year old girl is pimped out to a businessman, only for the businessman to run away after hugging her.  The director of this film has no respect for the brutality of the material that he is depicting- extracting its shock value and running from its consequences.  Rarely have I reacted so negatively to a film.",1116547200,7,1780,5.006802721088436
2197333,4,B0006Z2NCC,"Shunji Iwai's ALL ABOUT LILY CHOU-CHOU (Home Vision Entertainment) is an unflinching and finally harrowing examination of adolescent isolation in Japan.

Yuichi Isumi is a bullied eighth grader, a nobody who seeks refuge from his brutal life in on-line chat rooms with other kids who literally worship pop star Lily Chou Chou, an eccentric singer with a cultic fan website.  Off line, Yuichi's life spirals out of control as he becomes ever more enmeshed in criminal behavior, including robbery, blackmail, forced prostitution and perhaps murder.

Admittedly strange and shocking, this film is also poetic and beautiful.  It evokes the same dissonance as the fractured life of Yuichi.  This first Japanese feature shot on digital video has an incredible look.",1111536000,2,759,5.34453781512605
2197334,5,B0006Z2NCC,"At first I chalked it up to cultural difference.  ""Why do I need to watch a film about bad kids in Japan?"" I thought.  ""I was nothing like that; I can't relate to this at all.""  But I kept watching.  The lush colors, the mesmerizing light, the amazing teenage actors all held me in their stories.  Then I remembered, yes, this was an awful time...14 years old; insanely alive and confused...I watched the making-of documentary of the internet-novel-turned-film and understood why All About Lily Chou-Chou had won awards from both the 2002 Berlin and Shanghai International Film Festivals.

  Youth is so often shot with a Vaseline-coated lens on screen and in memory.  We all think we were ""good kids.""  Only in passing do we acknowledge the power of the ages between 13 and 15 for the immense potential for vitality and cruelty. But director and writer Shunji Iwai has created a film that shows children as they have power to be.  The story is centered around Yuichi Hasumi, told through his alias, philia, in his BBS-style chat-room ""Lilyphilia,"" devoted to the fictional musician, Lily Chou-Chou.  It is the ""ether"" of her music that enchants him-the life-force or chi that flows through her and into the world by her voice and electronic stylings.  Debussy, Satie, the Beatles, and Bjrk are all said to have a similar ether.  Between the subtle electronic score of Takeshi Kobayashi and the classic piano solos of Claude Debussy, I understood ether immediately, and the escapist power of this music within Yuichi's chaotic, bullied life.  At the same time, there was no pity for him, or for any other character.  All are complexly expressive: not the toothpaste-ad acting we've come to expect from teen actors in America.  Frustration and injustice flowed beneath control and rage.  Bitterness and unrequited longing linger under the happiest expressions.  Strength and courage grow in spite of public humiliation.  Admiration and servility cover deep fear and inadequacy.  Don DeLillo, in his novel, White Noise, understood this when he wrote, ""It is all there, in full force, charges waves of identity and being.  There are no amateurs in the world of children.""  All are swimming in their growing bodies, in their malleable identities, their secrets, intense feelings, betrayals; all in the context of a junior high school.  This is not about culture shock.  This is not about cultural difference.  All About Lily Chou-Chou rewires our memories, makes us see our 14-year-old selves as we were: shifting and spinning between angel and monstrosity.",1111449600,25,2553,5.047846889952153
2197335,4,B0006Z2NCC,"I saw this film AFTER i bought the Lily chou chou CD soundtrack and let me say that the music itself is great but it became more special when i heard it throughout the film.

The movie itself is good. I can't say it's great as i found it a little too long. But ultimately, it is a good film. It tackles the insecurities and struggles of the youngsters in their lives. Don't think this is a film only for young people though. I would say that even an adult would be able to identify with the film.

The images are great in the film as well.

It is not an over-the-top shocking film. The most extreme parts  are dealt with in a more subtle kind of way.

If anything, Bully and Kids are more shocking films.",1109894400,,704,4.109489051094891
8043932,3,B0006Z2NCC,"If there ever was a production that fit the definition, look and feel of a cult film then All About Lily Chou-Chou would be it. Filmed in Ashikaga in Tochigi Prefecture this film did well upon release in Japan in 2001, but it was the subsequent export, mystique and international fandom that have kept the ethereal film alive.
There are many ways to describe `Lily Chou-Chou Is Everything' (Riri Shushu No Subete in Japanese) and none of them would point to anything remotely mainstream or Hollywood-esque. It is a feel-bad movie that is nihilistic to the extreme, original and catches one off-guard and, independent of that depiction, there is a reasonable debate (in my mind anyway) as to whether it is good.

The story revolves around the fanatics of the mythical artist Lily Chou-Chou whose art, to her fans and members of a website whose chat room message are integral and elucidating, is beyond anything merely terrestrial and is often described as embodying the `ether.' Her fans live and breathe within the ether firstly because she is that sublime and secondly as an escape mechanism from the toll it takes to be a teenage high school student of fourteen in modern Japan. The students are perpetrators and victims of bullying, oppression, alienation, angst, teenage prostitution, corruption and disregarded by a hopeless cadre of teachers and parents. Banish those images of Japan as an orderly and organized society with a disciplined and respectable school system.
To be fair, however, whether anyone - including myself - really `gets' this film is another matter. It comes across as lifelike, and partly due to the documentary-style camerawork which is most observable in the Okinawa and kendo sequences, but it is deliberately cryptic, open to interpretation and even ends without something as definite as one is expecting - perhaps as a nod to life in modern society in general. Incidentally, the travel to Okinawa, and its aftermath, is the most unrealistic. The money may have been procured through ill-begotten means, but what about the time, opportunity and parental permissions? Would one subsequently change so drastically? As if there was not enough confusion the film incorporates flashbacks. The pompous and simultaneously enlightening All About Lily Chou-Chou is filmed long and like a stream of consciousness and, if nothing else, will make one hate the younger generation and its enablers.

I always thought striking imagery, penetrating story lines and intense music make for perfect films - think

The added element, however, is the extra disturbing content for which there is no preparation. On the flip side, All About Lily Chou-Chou's music is a success and laudable. With the film revolving around a recording artist it might be expected, but the alternative ambience of Lily, as performed by the as-of-then unknown Salyu, is perfect for the concept of the `ether' and for the suffocating world in which the anti-heroes live. While we are on the subject the film and Lily were inspired by Chinese singress Faye Wong. Lily/Salyu's Kaifuku No Kizu was included/mumbled in the film Kill Bill to boot. French composer Debussy's work is also prominently featured.

Did I learn anything or know anything definitive from this film? Well, datsu or Needlefish is called Shijar in Okinawa. North is `nishi,' east is `agari,'south is `fue' and west is iri.' Everything else is open to interpretation...

On a good day Japan bewilders most people. All About Lily Chou-Chou out-bewilders the bewilderment.",1404172800,,4105,5.813953488372093

This summer, I thought of the movie again, checked for Blu-Ray (none available yet) and got the DVD. A few reviews here were confusing, about how this particular DVD release (Home Vision Enter't.) was some kind of sub-par travesty of the visual / sonic integrity of the ""real"" film. To try to be fair, I tried two DVD versions (description and link to other DVD version below**) of the movie to see for myself. I saw no differences between the two, and thought the visuals were all fine, as crisp and clear as they ever needed to be, and the sound was fine on both, too.
(Then I read the comments to these disgruntled reviewers, and I agree that there may be something -- unsuspected pirated copy; bad equipment; confusion over the personal digi-camcorder-filmed sequences; unrealistically high cinematic expectations of a digital-era filmwatcher, who knows? -- that colored their views. Maybe I should've gone after yet another version of the DVD [there are at least two others] to truly vindicate their complaints, but someday the Blu-Ray will come along and render all of these complaints mute anyway.)
But again, for now, I think the stunning cinematography and artful lighting and the music and soundscapes are presented perfectly.

[**FYI, this HVE DVD has more chapter breaks than the other one. This DVD's extras includes a small BTS documentary, a Salyuu music video, an essay by the director, bio / filmography, and trailers.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-About-Lily-Chou/dp/B0002JC58O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All About Lily Chou</a>&nbsp;has no extras, although the packaging is pretty, with info on the director's career in the paper insert. Although the packaging is Japanese or Chinese, the DVD is Apparently multi-regional...Apparently]

The plot and content of this 2001 film is already pretty well described in the product descriptions and the other reviews, so I won't repeat those. So, who is this movie really for? Certainly not a general audience. There are many harsh topics covered / implied in this film, some more vividly than others. (Details in next paragraph) After a personal preview, and depending on your teens' character / attitude, you could conceivably make it the springboard for a major discussion about many aspects of teen life, the hard and the light, the bad and the good. Granted, there's some dark and depressing stuff in this story, but there are also some lighter and more uplifting aspects, too, that almost balance it out.

A list of harsh story elements, for those trying to determine whether, how, and who to let watch (brace thyselves):
--Extended masturbatory cruelty scene, the action of which is mercifuly off-screen or briefly in very low-light background, but the poor kid keeps going, even after his main tormentors leave
--Plenty of ""adult"" language, name-calling, multiple thefts in various parts
--Mild parental abuse early in the film
--Many instances of clique-ing and cruel rejection and putting down of outsider kids
--A stranger in Okinawa is hit by a motor vehicle; brief shots of road made bloody by his injured head
--Post-Okinawa protagonist out-bullies a bully by knocking him off a desk, throwing a chair at him, cutting off a mass of his hair, and treating him like a dog, making him wallow naked in the mud
--Suicide implied / corpse / funeral
--Mildly-implied instance of the practice of enjo-kosai
--Implied rape in abandoned textile factory
--Apparent off-screen knife-kill during a stampede/panic
--Assorted other cruel acts (these are teenagers, after all, some of them fitting the definition of bullies)

Also, aside from the drama, this film can be really trying and confusing on several levels. You have to have subtitles, and it's a very textual film, anyway, with a lot of epiliepsy-inducing chat-room text clacking/flashing across the screen in various sequences. It's a stylish and dramatic movie, low on harmless popcorn-munching action sequences. It's over two hours long, and the pace is often slow enough that you really do feel all of that time passing. (via calmness, boredom, shock, or suspense). There's a temporal dislocation, with the middle part being a long prequel to the rest of the movie. There's a degree of cultural divide, since this is about characters in Japan, with their own customs, terminology, obscure cultural references, and unique practices and problems. (The film's Wiki article, with links to the film's own website, can be quite helpful in this regard.) Even so, most of the main characters are teenagers, going through so many of the various issues and trials of all 21st-century teens across the world.

So, would this only appeal to Japan-o-philes, anthropologists/ sociologists, film students, foreign film fans, art film lovers, fans of artier pop music, and various teenagers (for different reasons, despite the more depressing aspects)? I'd like to think the potential appeal of this film can be broader than that, despite the heavier situations, for there is light, life, and beauty in this movie, too.",1345680000,,5623,5.509849362688296
8043934,1,B0006Z2NCC,"I really really like a lot of Japanese movies...the style..the constant cultural differences, but:  bleech-- (mini spoiler alert)-the lead character (I think?) flickers between being bullied and being the bully.  I know ALOT about bullying and yes, it is true that a person can ""change up"" like that.  The lead character was a bad kid in the first place?  How can we latch on to thieving sociopathic kids?  I think the glowing ""reviewing public"" is so used to these sick modern (clockwork orange) type kids that the ugly cruelty barely registers with them. (packs of wilding/ window smash and grabbing/ raping teens are just a common sitcom plot now I guess)  When you are violated - beat up- humiliated- have your property destroyed- have your SCHOOLWORK destroyed so that you get a lower grade-  are shoved to the bottom of the pecking order- -- (at least in my case) these things stay with you for life.  There is a pain quandrant in your heart that doesn't go away. It takes a very delicate hand to depict these things in a palatable redeemable way.  And there were several -too quick- turning points that lost me---I blame the filmmaking technique--
And I know re: Lily Chou-Chou- that what is ""great"" music is a subjective thing...  so they barely give you any Lily Chou-Chou music...(a little... a little Bjorkie)...  and they cram the movie wall to wall with Debussy piano music.  I think you come away with being reminded that Debussy-is indeed ""ethereal""...drifting , trancie, impressionist...  and some hipster girl repeating two line phrases over a slaggy drum sample is very weak and UN-ETHERAL in comparison....  Anyway- it was just upsetting.. the feeling that two and a half hours of life were wasted watching this movie.",1314316800,3,1737,4.8839590443686

If you were to take away one or each part of the film it would in itself still be a beautiful piece of work.

8043938,1,B0006Z2NCC,WTF!!!! All you three and above star reviewers need to get your heads back on the ground! This movie was nothing but a bunch of gloomy moody teenagers. Big f-ing deal. It happens everyday in every school.  This movie tries to pull a veil over your eyes with stylized visuals and music that makes me want to strangle my dog. If this movie were made in the US with the same exact style and english script but with A-list hollywood actors it would be panned. You know it.,1221004800,2,468,4.318181818181818
8043939,5,B0006Z2NCC,"To get it out of the way, this DVD by Home Vision is a poor transfer which does a great injustice to a beautifully shot classic. It's a grainy, blurry travesty... BUT, it's the easiest way to see the film in English.

As for the movie itself, All About Lily Chou-Chou is a Japanese film portraying the lives of Japanese high school students engaged in, well, the darkest and worst aspects of human behavior. This came out amidst a wave of Japanese ""teens gone wild"" films, the most notorious being Battle Royale, but Lily is the intellectual crown of the genre (if that's what you want to call it). It's long and confusing (you should watch it twice), but infinitely rewarding for someone willing to enjoy the gorgeous cinematography while being patient with the plot.

It's the magnum opus of director Shunji Iwai, who was already famous in Japan and throughout Asia for intelligent romances such as Love Letter and more arty films like Swallowtail Butterfly. The film stars the best young actor in Japan, the fiery Shugo Oshinari, and the soundtrack is a near-classic unto itself.

I like to compare Lily to the great novel, One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, in that they are both works of art that encompass the absolute entirety of human experience: power, defeat, suicide, transcendence, revenge, vindication, pride, murder, justice, victory, acceptance, happiness and utter misery. Lily can be interpreted as a metaphorical history of mankind, told in two and a half hours... or at least that's my take on it!

One of the greatest Japanese films of all time (in company with Kurosawa or anyone else you'd care to name) and the first truly great movie about the Internet (not like there's much competition on that one... anyone gonna argue for You've Got Mail?). Lily is one of those rare films that gets people *obsessed*-- small but dedicated online communities thrive to this day-- which is usually a sign that it's at least worth a watch.",1207612800,2,1970,4.836795252225519

8043941,1,B0006Z2NCC,"Compiled mostly from the internet stories of Japanese kids, ALL ABOUT LILY CHOU CHOU is as visionary as it is excsssive, and equal parts riveting and excruciatingly dull. The fact that we're talking abou the same film suggests that there's a wild inconsistency in Shunji Iwai's story.

The story, as such, is remarkably simple: a bullied teenage boy in rural Japan retreats into a fannish love for pop  idol Lily Chou Chou, whose ballads embody his isolation and hopelessness. The onus of bullyiing is spread on this framework - a kind of social Darwinism from which some do not escape. The details of the film cover fairly mundane, everyday life of its young characters, conveyed through a range of film techniques: wide-screen, jerky video, narrative...even a computer screen. As such, the  film may come off as a technical tour de force for some.

The subject matter can be brutal, and it's up to the viewer to determine whether courage or excess is in evidence. If you're not adverse to watching scenes of gang-rape and torture, you'll to contend with stretches of the film that require a great deal of patience; certainly, the fast-forward button may be an agreeable middle ground for most viewers. But even fans admit the film's inconsistent storyline and pretentiousness. You may find yourself saying, ""Do I have to sit here and watch this?"" ALL ABOUT LILY CHOU CHOU offered me nothing I hadn't seen before, better, and really quite often.",1165363200,3,1446,4.913934426229508
