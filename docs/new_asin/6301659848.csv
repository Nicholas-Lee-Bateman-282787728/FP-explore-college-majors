8297855,5,6301659848,"Filmed on location in the Orangerie of the Chateau de Sceaux in Paris, this performance features a wonderfully varied program of works by Scarlatti, Debussy and Ravel. Famed pianist Martha Argerich opens the concert with a compelling interpretation of Scarlatti's Sonata in D Minor. Ms. Argerich is then joined by cellist Misha Maisky in the great Debussy Sonata for Cello and Piano in D Minor. The concert then focuses on the works of Ravel. First we hear Martha Argerich give a moving rendering of ""Gaspard de la Nuit"". This work consists of three piano settings of poems based on the writings of Aloysius Bertrand. As a finale, pianist Nelson Freire joins Martha Argerich in a marvelous reading of Ravel's ""Waltz for Two Pianos"". This video concert, set in the opulent Orangerie of Sceaux Castle, is in my opinion both visually and musically a delight.",1060819200,7,855,4.944444444444445
