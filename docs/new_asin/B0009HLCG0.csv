8060787,3,B0009HLCG0,"An early example of 1950's ""reality"" television, NIGHT COURT U.S.A. is still fascinating to view all these years later.  Although it's billed as ""real cases"" and ""real people with only the names changed to protect the innocent"", it's all been re-staged using actors.  Even the presiding judge Jay Jostyn is fake.

Granted, the actors featured are quite ""natural"" and convincing (casting agents must have frequented the Actors' Studio); and Jay Jostyn's crusty old judge is a great foil.  The four episodes contained on this DVD feature many cases...a lot of them are unintentionally funny (a wife goes on trial for smashing a pot over her husband's head, and a young man is found guilty of playing Mozart at 2 o'clock in the morning, for example); and the overall premise must have been quite a novelty for the period.

Classic TV nuts will enjoy these.",1282694400,,853,4.895833333333333
