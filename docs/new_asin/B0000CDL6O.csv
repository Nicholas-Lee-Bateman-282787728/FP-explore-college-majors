1918566,4,B0000CDL6O,"An attempt to do a serious vampire movie on a low budget.  With a smart script and good acting by an attractive cast, this should appeal to the Anne Rice/Dark Shadows crowd as well as anyone interested in an intelligent, atmospheric supernatural tale.",1068768000,4,251,4.837209302325581

1918581,1,B0000CDL6O,"Unfortunately I'm involved with this garbage on a small level so I'm warning everyone to stay away, don't waste your time or money.

This film is typical no budget waste of time, anyone that posts anything positive is involved with the film, family members, or they just don't know anything about film in general. No one in their right mind would want endure this trash more than once, and even after viewing it once any logical person would regret their time lost.

I was shocked at the screening at how bad it was, and that they still had plans to release it. After they found a distributor with as low standards as their own, the director and producer sent out e-mails to everyone involved telling them to post positive reviews; of course I ignored his request.
Posting positive reviews for work that the reviewer is involved in is unethical, deception and misrepresentation.

The fake positive reviews are intentionally misleading and are a misrepresentation of what you're actually spending your money on.

Films like this at best, are dress rehearsals, or DEMO'S if it were music; they're incomplete products that aren't ready for the market or the paying consumer. Since this film obviously met someone's ridiculously low standard, here we are.

If the talentless producer and director don't like me warning everyone with the truth, then take me to court; I'd be happy to take a lie detector test to back up my words.

To the makers of this garbage: Stop polluting the world with inferior trash like this, you don't have the talent or budget to produce a credible film. Go into retail where you can't con people and do anymore damage.",1413849600,,1641,4.801418439716312

1918586,1,B0000CDL6O,"I love campy, tacky horror that is satirical and tongue in cheek,  however this movie has bad acting and a moronic story with no redeeming humor to help me through the movie.  Ten minutes in and my gag release overcame me.",1404432000,,222,4.390243902439025
1918587,3,B0000CDL6O,"First, let me make the disclaimer upfront, that this is a B-movie, even C-Movie, if you will, in terms of budget. I realize that alone will send some packing, so I wanted to make that perfectly clear up front. But let me remind you that some of the greatest genre films ever made were B-grade. For example, the movie Phantasm, was certainly made on the cheap, and is a great movie. Now this movie is nowhere near as original as Phantasm, but then again, when it comes to vampire movies, originality has long left the building, and is extremely hard to come by given the number of vampire themed films over the decades.  That said, this is a well made, atmospheric movie, with good acting, good music, and coherent plotting. It was in my opinion really well done.  The characters are sympathetic, and are not one dimensional. The writing in terms of the characters response to the given situations and there reactions are quite believable and well written. There is no gratuitous nudity, which of course is unnecessary and often cheapens a good horror flick. Kudos to the crew that made this film, because it was truly a labor of love , you can tell. This film has loads of charm and atmosphere, and blood for that matter. There are several love stories, and the hero vampire is a tortured soul who wishes to do good, not harm. But the bad guys are truly bad and menacing as a good antagonist should be.  This is definitely one the gems in my collection. It's one of those movies where if you go in with your expectations to high, you may certainly be disappointed. This does not have the backing of a movie like say ""Interview with a Vampire,"" but because it is a B-movie, it has a gritty believability that sometimes succeeds because these characters seem more real than in a big Hollywood productions. I give it 3-Stars for these fine folks that did so much with obviously so little. Well Done!!!",1403136000,6,1898,4.560117302052786
1918588,1,B0000CDL6O,"I sometimes scan these b-movies for interesting torture scenes.  Vampire movies can be hit or miss there.  The thing I didn't expect was that this movie would be so awful that even just scanning through the scenes was painful.  Bad acting, direction, script, story...in short, everything is bad.  Unfortunately, it isn't comically bad, so you can't even enjoy it on that level.  I've seen better movies made in neighborhood back yards...by nine year-olds.  Do your brain a favor and skip this one.",1402099200,,497,5.0

1918601,2,B0000CDL6O,I knew right from the start of this film it was likely not going to be worth watching. I did manage too get 2/3rds of the way thru it. My conclusion is this film sucks worse than the portrayed vampires it is about.,1372204800,4,214,4.0
1918602,4,B0000CDL6O,"Given the obviously tiny budget, this is a surprisingly entertaining vampire story. The actors are all attractive and mostly competent and the plot manages some interesting and unexpected variations on the usual vampire themes.

The production is hampered to some extent by some less than convincing effects work and instances of obvious looping, the result, probably of budget limitations. Still, if you can look past these deficiencies, Sleepless Nights provides 90 minutes of atmospheric vampire escapism.

With most of the action taking place at night and/or in dark, candle-lit rooms, the film has a moody, foreboding tone, proceeding at a measured pace with extended dialogue sequences broken up by sudden eruptions of bloody violence. (Some who might be drawn to this film for its romantic angle, might be put off by its bloodier moments. But, in terms of violence, it's mild in comparison to many of the movies being made today.)

Though Sleepless Nights is a standard definition, full-screen presentation, the picture is sharp, colorful and largely noise-free and the audio is more than adequate. And, even with its tiny budget, it's clear a fair amount of thought and effort went into the look of the film-the production values are surprisingly high in many scenes. (The raid on the vampire coven near the beginning of the film is especially elaborate and well-staged.) It would probably be going too far to call the production ""slick"" or ""glossy"" but it's certainly one of the better-looking shot-on-video indie vampire flicks available nowadays on DVD.

Overall, this is on par with something you might have seen decades back on TV- a pilot for a series or a TV movie- though the script here is much better than what used to be common on TV. In tone and even in certain plot aspects, it calls to mind the old Dark Shadows show. (The lead actor actually looks a bit like Ben Cross who played Barnabas Collins in the 90s Dark Shadows revival.)

Not a masterpiece, but certainly an entertaining diversion that will be of special interest to retro horror and vampire fans. Definitely shows how much talent and inspiration can compensate for low budgets.",1288310400,5,2161,5.008356545961003

I tend to prefer vampire stories set in the ancient past, but this ""modern-day"" telling actually works well--as long as you are willing to suspend your disbelieve a little. This is a film about vampires, after all. Maybe one reason why the story is good is because it seems to have borrowed elements and themes from several successful larger-budget vampire films. Some of the acting was a little wooden, but the story is what really made the movie worth watching. In my opinion, none of the actors' acting was bad enough to spoil the mood of the film--and some of the actors were better than average, for a B-movie. All around, this was a good vampire film on a modest budget.",1481241600,3,737,4.633587786259542
