7741147,5,B01EYBIBL0,It was wonderful. I'm so looking forward to Season 5. I can hardly wait!!!,1478217600,4,74,4.357142857142857
7741148,5,B01EYBIBL0,I think Australian mystery shows have a better plot and are more suspenseful than American shows.,1474588800,16,97,5.125
7741149,5,B01EYBIBL0,love it need season 5 and 6,1472342400,,27,3.0
7741150,5,B01EYBIBL0,"The return of the first wife seems to  make this season too ""soap opera"". However, the supurb acting by Craig McLachlan and Nadine Garner and the rest of the cast, makes it plausible and perk along just fine. There is a murder that always needs to be solved, there is a love story, and then there is the depiction of a lovely town in the late fifties and early sixties. The characters almost seem real. And the character development is so far about every other Australian, English and American drama. Let us say it is on par with Downton Abbey.",1468972800,4,544,4.44
7741151,3,B01EYBIBL0,"didn't think it would happen, but i was disappointed with season 4.  i'll say i'm glad i made it part of the library on this show, but the storyline about dr. blake's wife returning left me feeling cold.  this is his wife who he drank himself into a stupor in the first stories, the woman he looked for for 17 years and then she appears on his doorstep the day he pops the question to jean.  jean is resentful the doctor puts his wife in a hotel instead of allowing her to stay in his home, and when she is in danger moves her into another one.....really?  they make her feel like an outsider.  he never even welcomed her with a hug or one when she left for hong kong.  where was the caring, compassion, warmth?  the characters i grew to love, turned me cold and i didn't have feelings of caring about them or their future.",1467849600,11,823,4.203821656050955

7741153,2,B01EYBIBL0,In this one where his long lost searched for and must loved wife returns cannot believe how this was handled it would have been much better to come up with some other lame excuse for putting off the lousy proposal just astounded as hoe this was written and if they cut things out it has really left this series sadly lacking....there seems to be little or not connection between the actors at all....at least I could not feel it if they have more I shall not be getting them.,1466726400,7,475,4.348314606741573

Each is self-contained so it's enjoyable, yet there is an arc to each season and the series as a whole, so it's satisfying on all counts.

7741205,5,B01EYBIBL0,"Once more, police surgeon Doctor Lucien Blake finds himself uncovering murderers. He has a good supporting cast helping or hindering him, as the case may be. I particularly like Alice Harvey, the Russian-born pathologist with whom he works closely. At one autopsy, she asks him, ""Are you all right? You don't seem yourself. You've barely said a word, to me or him."" She's referring  to Blake's habit of talking respectfully to the murder victims.

The series sometimes strays into the unrealistic, such as Lucien breaking & entering to find clues. But it has always been like that and it is a small irritant, not enough to affect my enjoyment of the mysteries.

Speaking of enjoyment, at the end of episode 3 there is a huge surprise for the audience. But not as big of a surprise as it is for Lucien, who opens his door and stands there in shock with his mouth open.

....1...""The Open Road"" Ballaret is hosting a stage of the 1960 Red Australia Trial, a motor rally whose winners may go on to further glory in the Nationals. Dirty tricks abound, such as leaving a fire cracker to stir up the dust and obscure the view on a sharp curve. But can a dirty trick include murder?
....2...""Golden Years"" The Foster brothers announce a new development, Goldrush Park. Not everyone is happy about it. Someone is murderously unhappy.
....3...""Lucky Numbers"" Ten year-old Elizabeth Chapman gives her Mummy a kiss and heads off to school. She less than a block away when she realizes she forgot her lunch on the kitchen table. She rushes back to the kitchen to find broken plates and a bloody knife of the kitchen floor. And her mother no where to be seen.
....4...""Against the Odds"" It's in the early morning hours, and Alexander Martin is exercising a horse at the track. He comes galloping down the straight when he is flung of his horse to his death. As his aunt tells Blake, ""What experienced rider falls on a training run?""
....5...""The Place of Love"" At midnight a man runs through the woods of the Hayes Military Base outside of Ballaret. It's Lance Corporal Mervyn Rogers, but he's in civvies and running right through the middle of tactical night maneuvers. But they use only blanks on maneuvers. Don't they?
....6...""A Difficult Lie"" Local mogul Patrick Tyneman is playing golf with the new Chief Superintendent when they find a bloodied body in a bunker. Definitely a bad lie.
Keep your eyes peeled for the kangaroos on the golf course!
....7...""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" Ballaret has a volunteer fire service. The firehouse has a bell tower and it is rung to call the volunteers when needed. One night, the bell rings, and Rod Drury rushes over to find no one else there. Well, no one but a murderer.
....8...""The Visible World"" Special glasses all around to view a solar eclipse. The Ballaret Observatory opens its doors and there's a murder. I must say, the rationale given for the bad guy's urge to murder doesn't seem realistic to me. Unless, he wasn't the murderer.

Season 4 of ""Doctor Blake"" totals 472 minutes for the 8 episodes. If you buy it on disc, it has English SDH subtitles available and no bonus features.

At the beginning of this season, we say goodbye to Mattie, the cheerful district nurse who boards at Blake's. She's taken a job in London, and who would want to hold her back. Now it's just Lucien and Jean in the house.

7741223,5,B01EYBIBL0,"An astoundingly GOOD mystery series, with complex and very human characters. The doctor works for the local police in a 1960 Australian force in a small town, so the number of murders he encounters makes more sense than other murder mysteries, where belief must be suspended as to the frequency of the murders he encounters. What makes this series so special and riveting is the PERSONAL and tormented side of the lead character as well as the supporting characters who surround him. A fallible, brilliant and moral soul, with high personal standards of conduct, Dr. Blake is fortunate enough to be surrounded by others who respect and even love him, despite, or perhaps, because of, his all too human flaws. American versions go from seasons one thru four...I am going to get season five, the last of the series, to try to watch the last season of this show: it is that good. If I can't watch it in its non-USA format on my compuer's dvd player, I will search amazon for a player which is compatible, as one other reviewer has said is to be found here on amazon. The storyline is THAT good. I found this series on PBS, which I will support...and am only sad to now that this series was discontinued after season five. It is like a wonderful movie to watch each season, and I hope that the makers of the show might reconsider and keep it going if worldwide attention is given to it. I am anxious to see how the series ends. The last episode of season four, not yet shown here in the US, was worth the price of the entire set of dvds! Admirably done! Ten stars for this series and all of its actors! I DO hope they change their minds and continue the series and let us see ti over here in the US.",1522108800,,1695,4.3841269841269845

7741260,2,B01EYBIBL0,"I very much enjoyed seasons 1 - 3, in spite of the over-the-top harassment of Dr. Blake by Chief Superintendent Munro.  I looked forward to season 4 but am really disappointed in the way it played out.  I found the end of episode 3 utterly contrived and manipulative -- in the manner of a soap opera, as another reviewer said.  Episode 4 was anticlimactic, depressing and ultimately annoying.  SPOILER ALERT:  What a let-down after the previous build-up surrounding Dr. Blake's mysterious past and tragic loss of his family.  Far from what we were led to expect of Dr. Blake's supposedly beloved long lost wife, Mei Lin turns out to be a dour, emotionally flat buzz-kill.  Why would he ever have married this woman?  But he did, and now he doesn't want to live up to his vows.  Ugh.

7741316,5,B01EYBIBL0,"I have enjoyed all of the Dr. Blake Mysteries. Sadly I missed season four so I was happy to be able to purchase it and watch it on my ipad while I went about my daily activities.

While I have seen all four seasons, I have noticed that it is a bit formulaic. That is, there is a mystery, the police chief doesn't really want Dr Blake around, yet between Dr Blake, Charlie the constable, his house keeper and sometimes another odd person or two the mystery is solved.

This season has a little bit of drama in the mix when Dr. Blake's wife, presumed dead, is not dead and this happens just after Dr. Blake finds he loves his house keeper. Additionally, someone from Dr. Blake's past shows up and causes problems too. That was a nice bit of drama added to the show in addition to the mystery of the episode.

Overall, this is a great mystery. It come from Australia I believe. So, while it has shades of a British mystery set in the times right after the war, it is not near as dry or slow moving as some British mysteries.

7741326,5,B01EYBIBL0,"Really,excellent. Acting by Greg and Nadine and the sexual tension is brilliantly handled, although it is time for Blake to get on with it.  My only criticism with the show is that the writers have made the character of Blake show more affection with other women characters than with Jean.  This seems a little contradictory for the country doctor.  Nonetheless, I am a devoted watcher because the interplay of plots and characters is excellent.

7741328,5,B01EYBIBL0,"I am absolutely hooked on this Australian TV series.  The characters are complex and keep developing with every episode.  Lucien Blake is an especially troubled man who has lost his wife and daughter and tries desperately to cope with this on top of trying to live up to the reputation of his father whose practice he has taken over.  Jean Beazley, housekeeper and confidante also has a painful past and like Dr. Blake has suffered the consequences and losses of wartime.

Blake, besides being a general practitioner in Ballarat is the designated police surgeon.  He performs this role well beyond the autopsy table!  His continuous search of the truth often times puts him at odds with the local superintendent of police.  The cleverness of the plots and how the victims meet their demise is most inventive and ingenious.  Whoever is the medical advisor to this series must be commended to assist in coming up with these unusual causes of death----poisons, falls from great heights, etc.  Up front it looks cut and dried, but underneath are not only motives but the suspects ingenuity in carrying out the crime!",1508889600,,1112,4.903743315508021

7741336,3,B01EYBIBL0,"Not as good as the previous seasons.  Lucien's character takes a weak turn as he is sheepishly torn between two women, and shows little of the real emotion one would expect upon the return of Mei Lin.  Mattie leaves, and is ""replaced"" by an annoying reporter.  Blake's emotional turmoil over the disappearance and (supposed) death of Mei Lin during the first two seasons now rings hollow, when he has almost no real emotional response to her survival and return.  His woodenness is shocking, and not even remotely explained by his love for Jean, who is also limp as a dishrag in this season.  Mei Lin proves to be the most noble character in Season 4.  In the last episode, without explanation, Mei Lin leaves to return to the land of her torment and imprisonment--with no explanation of why or what their marital status will be.  But her departure leaves you feeling like she still got the good end of the stick, walking away from the noodle-like Blake.  He wraps up Season 4 by (presumably) asking Jean to marry him, when his actual wife (from whom he has no legal divorce) drives away to go have a relationship with their daughter and granddaughter.  Season 5 should follow Mei Lin, rather than the doctor....but I guess that would be an entirely different series.",1507161600,4,1267,4.6968325791855206

7741341,5,B01EYBIBL0,"This show is a gem. For once I can't figure out the mysteries most of the time. The acting is great, and the understories are compelling. Blake is too slow with Jean, which is totally frustrating, but I still want to watch. Sometimes actors leave the show (presumably to pursue better offers) and you miss their characters for a while. But others step in, and meanwhile Craig McLachlan does some fine acting. He's quite engaging.",1506988800,3,429,4.733333333333333

After the excellent episode 3 the personal angst overshadowed the mysteries for the rest of the season and it was hard to watch Blake be so self involved and Jean and Mei Lin so unhappy during it all. It was a bit too soap opera for me.  Plus my second favorite character of the show left and it wasn't the same without her. The acting by all was excellent, esp Nadine and Craig, and it is definitely worth watching but keep the tissue box handy. This season made me miss the lightness and humor which made the first 3 seasons so enjoyable.",1505520000,11,685,4.036764705882353

7741349,4,B01EYBIBL0,"Just finished binge-watching this series and I enjoyed it. Thanks to ""A Place to Call Home"" and ""Janet King"" on Acorn I've taken to Australian dramas and this was a worthy next show to follow. The actress who plays Jean mentioned ABC cancelled the series because it wasn't drawing the demographic they wanted; I just have to say as a 30 year old female, I've greatly enjoyed this show and am upset at the cancellation.

Writing: Weakest of the other Australian shows I mentioned and also of many of the British crime dramas broadcast in recent years. I'm fine with more restrained characters (as befits the time period) but A Place to Call Home (set in the same time period) has a much better balance of restrained emotions/character development. I know hour long dramas don't leave much time, but I'd love a few conversations that explore the various relationships among the characters, rather than just advance the crime plot.

Acting: The acting is fairly good. Some of the lines feel a bit rushed and a bit more emotional development would be good but overall I like all the actors.

Plots: It's 50/50 on whether I pay attention to the murders. I admit, I've binged on so many crime dramas that my mind tends to wander regardless of how good the writing is. The interaction between the principle characters is what makes this show for me. I love Dr. Blake's relationship with Jean and I also love his friendship with Alice. It's fantastic to see a platonic friendship between a male and female character (particularly one that doesn't discount a relationship due to appearance or class - I'm looking at you Elizabeth George).

Overall Recommend: It's very good. Not great, but very good. It's nice to see the characters talking and relying on their observations rather than technology. I'm sad it was cancelled but I'm glad they have some time to wrap up the storylines.

Spoiler: I really didn't care for the Mei Lin storyline. I get he wanted to marry Jean but Lucien's lack of wanting to reconnect with Mei Lin and his willingness to ignore her felt odd. I'd have preferred if they'd tried or he'd admitted to his relationship with Jean from the beginning. Ultimately, they are two very different people from who they were when they married/were forced apart. For me, a stronger plot would have been them collectively deciding what they had was good but in the past. His coldness towards her, without an exploration of his feelings on screen just made him seem jerky.",1504742400,4,2489,4.697247706422019

7741357,5,B01EYBIBL0,"Imagine, a small town, located in the USA. There, in an average home, a television/computer is broadcasting a show based on a small town, Ballarat, located in Australia. A town, much like anyone might choose to settle in to raise a family amidst the trials of everyday life. Set in an era, which gave the world a chance for a new start. Death, murders, yes! Relationships, drama, life changing events all filmed and portrayed with an eye for detail to the era. The Doctor Blake Mysteries drew me in like those of the grand lady, Agatha Christie, whose works set the standard to period mystery dramas. With each episode, I found myself to be not only a viewer, but, a participant in solving the mysteries. I felt to be a part of the good doctor's household, or a member of the town observing and anticipating the events as they unfolded. Each portrayal of the wonderful characters gives one the sense of belonging. Each episode challenges the mind and the hearts of its viewers. It seems I find myself in the company of others who would love to see this show continue. Like so many, I would humbly ask, you reconsider the demise of, Dr. Blake Mysteries. Far too seldom, does a show come along that unites the hearts and minds of people from all over the world... Although my voice is one, combined with many, I do hope, the powers that be will give our thoughts, consideration. Whatever the future holds for this show, I enjoyed every moment I escaped, to the town of Ballarat, with the good doctor and the residents!  Respectfully, D Roberts  (Currently, there are 4 series/seasons aired with a 5th season and a mini movie in production ending this wonderful period drama. By all reports, the cast/crew and creators were/are willing to continue this show if a new home can be found.

7741360,4,B01EYBIBL0,"""The Doctor Blake Mysteries"" Series 4 sees some cast changes. Mattie O'Brien (Cate Wolfe) and Ch Supt Matthew Lawson (Joel Tobeck) leave the show. Lawson is replaced by Ch Supt Frank Carlyle (Roger Corser), who, remarkably, is content to allow Dr. Blake to do anything he wants, as long as he gets results. This calls Carlyle's credibility into question and makes him a weak character, especially when he takes a backseat to Blake on investigations and in gunplay. Mattie O'Brien is replaced by another redhead, Rose Anderson (Anna McGahan), who is Lawson's niece and an ambitious reporter working for Patrick Tyneman's (John Wood) newspaper ""The Ballarat Courier"", having previously worked in Melbourne. Rose is an attempt to combine the characters of Mattie and of Joy McDonald, Blake's journalist friend who died, into one character, but she isn't especially appealing.

The conclusion of Dr. Blake's family story runs through the season's 8 mysteries. We learn the fate of his wife, Mai Lin, thought dead for 17 years, from whom Blake was separated when Japan invaded Singapore. This brings forth Blake's ongoing conflict with Maj. Derek Alderton, whom he knew in Singapore, when they both served in the military's intelligence services. Blake's family drama leads to uncertainty in his relationship with Jean Beazley (Nadine Garner) dragging on another season. SC Charlie Davis (Charlie Cousins) is still an appealing character though absent a couple episodes. Dr. Alice Harvey (Belinda McClory) returns as a crack pathologist. Sgt. Bill Hobart (David Whiteley) is mostly in the background. I feel Jean's characterization has gotten a bit off; she is too accepting of modern behavior that she must find immoral. And the clues necessary to solve ""The Price of Love"" just weren't there. But the series still has a good cast and period appeal.

The episodes are:

Dr. Blake returns to Ballarat from Adelaide and is called immediately to the scene of a racetrack murder in The Open Road. Highly regarded mechanic Errol Moore (Sam Young) is found dead under the car of rival driver Trevor McKenzie (Will McLachan) following trials for the Red Australia 1960 road race. Moore died of traumatic asphyxiation after a cars chassis fell on him, initially thought to be an accident. Blake and Dr. Harvey conclude that the death was deliberate, so the police interview Moores employer, local racing hero Clive Hildebrande (David Pledger), the winner of the trial, ambitious woman driver Beryl Routledge (Petra Yared), and unscrupulous race promoter Herbert Jones (Adam Zwar), while dogged by The Couriers pushy new reporter Rose Anderson (Anna McGahan).

In Golden Years, property developer Reg Foster is found dead in a public swimming pool, where he met his brother Noel (Geoff Paine) for a swim every morning, the day after he announces plans for a Goldrush Park on property owned by the city. It becomes apparent that things are not as they seem, when it is discovered that the water in Fosters lungs was not chlorinated. Meanwhile, the new Chief Superintendent Frank Carlyle (Rodger Corser) finds an odd way to introduce himself to Dr. Blake, and, strangely, allows the doctor to carry on his usual methods of detection as long as hes getting results. The secretary with whom Foster was having an affair, Norma Emerson (Emily Taylor), and his disapproving sister Valerie (Diana Glenn) are also suspect. Mattie struggles to break some important news to Lucien.

Judith Chapman (Shaye Hopkins), a homemaker who recently won 50,000 in a lottery, is kidnapped from her home in front of her 10-year-old daughter Elizabeth (Lily Jones) in Lucky Numbers. Her husband Laurie (James Saunders), whose face was plastered on the front page of The Courier with the winners check, left work early that day and called in sick to a meeting, leaving him without an alibi. Finding Judith is urgent, as she suffers from Addisons Disease and is at risk of death without her medication. Also suspect are Judiths mother Irene Henderson (Trudy Hellier), whose relationship with her daughter was strained, and her check-forging boyfriend Rob Brunel (Ryan Faucett). Carlyle is under pressure from Melbourne to arrest someone, while intrepid reporter Miss Anderson is pressured to get a sensational scoop.

Not yet recovered from the shock at the reappearance of his presumably deceased wife Mei Lin (Ling Hsueh Tang), Blake is called to investigate the death of jockey Alex Martin during a training run just one day after he won the Ballarat Cup in Against the Odds. The deceased was the son of Agnes (Helen Morse), longtime friend of the Blake family, and Blake believes that he was murdered by a cable strung across the track. Ante-mortem injuries and a bet that Martin had placed against himself lead Blake to find no shortage of suspects in rival jockey Shane Heywood (Chris Pace), the owner of his horse Mrs. Ada McCrae (Shanyn Asmar), track manager with a shady past Bradley Tennant (David Ross Paterson), and sleazy promoter Terrence Noonan (Damien Richardson). Meanwhile, Ch Supt Carlyle appears to have a suspicious relationship to the track.

The Price of Love sees young Corporal Rogers shot dead when he got into the line of fire during a training exercise in which recruits from a nearby military base were shooting a target after dark. It looks like a tragic accident, but, when SC Davis stops a speeding, stolen car and discovers a blood-soaked Oriental carpet in the truck, Dr. Blake has a murder on his handsbut no victim. Shortly thereafter, the body of Gladys Cook is found in the woods near the military base. Gladys was a military wife separated from her husband after conducting an affair with Lt. Keith Ellis (Angus Grant), the husband of Joyce Ellis (Michala Banas), close friend of Daisy Rogers (Elizabeth Friels), whose son Ben was shot. As Dr. Blake tries to untangle this incestuous web, he is stymied by Maj. Derek Allderton (Neil Pigot) and hard-pressed keep both Jean and Mei Lin happy at home.

Patrick Tyneman and Ch Supt Carlyle find the body of Terry Reynolds in a bunker, while they play a round of golf in ""A Difficult Lie"". Reynolds was sports editor for The Courier, Tyneman's newspaper. He sustained a fractured skull and died of a subdural hematoma. Dr. Blake finds that Reynolds was using his sports column to blackmail people, and Patrick's son Edward Tyneman (Lee Beckhurst) must have known. Edward replaced seasoned reporter Harvey Treloar (Mark Mitchell) with Reynolds and relegated Treloar to the printing presses. Treloar's notebooks indicate that he was onto some financial misconduct at the golf club, whose president is Clay Richardson (Francis Greenslade). Reynolds' caddie Freddie Wilson (Dominic Deustcher) stole his clubs and lied about his whereabouts. And Reynolds argued violently with Lyall Phillips (Damian Callinan) before his death.

Dr. Blake learns that Mai Lin has been hiding some things from him in ""For Whom the Bell Tolls."" While out walking, Mai Lin witnesses a man fall to his death from the bell tower of the Ballarat Fire Station, but she tells no one. The man was Rod Drury (Todd Levy), brother of Cec Drury (Ian Rooney), Blake's friend and bartender at The Colonists Club. Rod was a volunteer fireman responding to the bell, while the other firemen were out on an earlier call. Handprints on the bell tower railing from a mysterious black substance and the position of the body indicate that Rod was pushed. The investigation leads to a warehouse fire three months before on a property owned by fellow firefighter Theodore Rowe (Marco Chiappi). Meanwhile Rose Anderson has photographed Mai Lin speaking to Maj. Alderton, and Jean has overheard Alderton threaten her.

""The Visible World"" ends the season, as Dr. Blake is furious at Maj. Alderton for blackmailing Mai Lin. He insists on meeting Alderton in public to confront him. They meet at the Ballarat Observatory, but Alderton insists that Blake rejoin Special Branch, as Australia is ""going to war"" and responds to Blake's ultimatum with more threats. The lights go out in order for the patrons to observe an eclipse, Blake is attacked, fires his gun, and Alderton is dead when the lights come back on, stabbed in the back of the brain. Dr. Blake literally has blood on his hands. But another man from Special Branch was present, Sgt. Robert Hannam (Ben Anderson), whom Blake suspects had motive for murder. The astrophysicist leading the tour, Dr. Joanna Bainbridge (Joanne Trentini), also had reason to dislike Alderton, as he had commandeered her research facility for military purposes.",1485302400,16,8594,5.075725406935598
