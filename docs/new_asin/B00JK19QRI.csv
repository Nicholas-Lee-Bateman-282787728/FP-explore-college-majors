8651604,5,B00JK19QRI,"My husband has been looking for this movie for a long time. The hard part was finding it in English. The German version will play in English, but no subtitles in English. That was fine. Just happy that we found it. Great movie if you enjoy music and motion pictures.",1430006400,5,266,4.34

Nightwish did play at one of the cattle-market clubs in my Capital city , a few years ago, so it's not as though they were unknown in Oz.

Enough!.
English language reviews are hard to find, and they all miss the mark in so many ways, so here I go.
This work has to be viewed through a prism colored by a fair knowledge of Nightwish music, and Holopainen's bleak view of life, as presented over a couple of decades. Yet, it is not a long Nightwish music video...indeed the music is strangely irrelevant.

We see a Blue-Gray kaleidoscopic view of Holopainen's apparent fixation on death, legacy issues, loss of youth, and perhaps corruption of innocence. The Dead Boy returns,in yet another ""Christmas Carol"" like trip with a very Tim Burton Snowman, and including several Jiminy Cricket-ghosts of future and past.

True to form I suspect, the Old composer, dying from vascular chronic brain rot, and the dream within the dream visions/memories of himself as a boy, are curious avatars of Tuomas himself. We are bludgeoned with this, and in fact nothing here is subtle. Naturally, at least here, Tuomas plays the composer as a young bloke. I get that it is supposed to represent the residual mind of a dying man.

The story is the old Oedipal trope but the twist is that the youth is the daughter, who believed all of life that she was unloved and unacknowledged by an uncaring father. I found Farley's portrayal ploddy, mechanical, trite, and even shrill. Predictably, there is a rapprochement, and all is forgiven, if with misgivings. The role of the Composer's paramour is mischievous, but she is really just another Jiminy Cricket, for the embittered daughter, Gem. The band appears performing in a couple of Carnival of Souls looking scenes, which enlighten not at all, but the music is otherwise well in the background. Individual members have roles as bit players.

 I was curious as to how the album would link with the movie....it really doesn't.
Comparisons are offered with the work of Tim Burton, or Terry Gilliam.
Passingly, perhaps. However, there is none of Gilliam's gleeful grimness or griminess, nor  Burton's quirky dark humor.
Excepting the campy philosophizing toy soldier.

So, boys and girls, if you are after a Long Nightwish video, buy a concert video.
If you're after a well wrought art-work, this is not it.
Slick, dark, confused Freudian, and ultimatelyforgetable.
Sorry. And gem? G, E minor. Oh Dear.",1423785600,4,2616,4.769911504424779
