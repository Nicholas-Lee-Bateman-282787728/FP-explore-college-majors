536693,5,6302989728,great old movie,1418083200,,15,4.333333333333333
536694,3,6302989728,"Another mediocre Sonja Henie ""ice-tacular"" only with better musical arrangements and higher production values to make even Jack Oakie funny (but not much...).  Another merry mix-up mish-mash but I don't suppose people went to see her movies because they were Noel Coward plays.  She skated and smiled and she sure could skate which was what counted.  My advice would be to stick with the Henie pictures which were made during WWII.  The routines were better designed, executed and orchestrated.  This film, ""Sun Valley Serenade"" and ""Wintertime"" were the cream of her crop",1388534400,3,572,5.173913043478261
536695,1,6302989728,I expected a skating movie and instead received a documentary on Iceland.  The descriptin of this movie was all wrong.,1372118400,,118,4.9
536696,5,6302989728,"This is one of my 2 favorite Sonja Henie films (the other being Sun Valley Serenade) but I have to stand by my convictions - Sonja Henie is not a good actress but, wow - are her leading men are sure good looking! Fox made every effort to pair this non-acting star with all of their handsomest leading men, perhaps to make her acting to appear better or perhaps to give her audiences a wider appeal. Regardless, if this VHS is selling for over $35, wouldn't you think that someone a Fox Home Video would smarten up and release it on DVD?",1294790400,,536,4.264705882352941
536697,4,6302989728,"In the wake of the brilliant Sun Valley Serenade, Fox again cast Sonja with John Payne under the helm of H. Bruce Humberstone. Iceland is not as good as Sun Valley, but her skating is her best. The music is first rate, though the words hilarious(promoting the girls to let soldiers have fun with them, they might not come back hehehe). Sonja proves once again that she was a comic talent, but the stagefarce-plot is much too much at times... However; the musicalnumbers are a treat and u should always watch it for that reason alone.",1089676800,4,533,4.5625
536698,3,6302989728,"This is a good introduction to Iceland, but it is not really intended for the adventure traveller.  It is heavy with info and pictures for the traveller interested in birding.  Still in a world light in videos on Iceland, this is better than nothing.  Trailside is rereleasing their Trekking Iceland for the more adventurous.",983750400,,325,4.981481481481482
7834920,5,6302989728,"The story sort of vacillates near the end, but for all the excellent figure ice skating I'm going to give this excellent old film 5 stars.  I like John Payne who did Sun Valley Serenade with her, but this is not quite as good.  Sun Valley Serenade had everything, travel, trains, ice skating, snow skiing, singing and specialty acts (Dorothy Dandridge) and was a bit superior to this.",1513987200,,384,4.632352941176471

7834924,5,6302989728,"The movie shows clearly on my dvd player and I could see the picture very well.  I liked the movie with all the singing, music, and ice skating.",1456790400,,144,4.142857142857143
7834925,5,6302989728,Also a great movie loved every minute of it,1432857600,,43,3.888888888888889
7834926,5,6302989728,"This is just the basic movie with no extras, but with Sonja Henie and her dimples who needs anything else?  I have waited for a long time for this to come out on DVD.",1431302400,2,166,3.8823529411764706
7834927,4,6302989728,"This was an ok, lighthearted, musical comedy for it's time, but it was the singing prowess of Joan Merrill, who stole the show in my estimation.
Her musical numbers are worth the price of admission, alone.",1427673600,,205,4.722222222222222
