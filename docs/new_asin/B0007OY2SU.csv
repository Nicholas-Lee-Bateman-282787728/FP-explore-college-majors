8300167,5,B0007OY2SU,"This is the 3rd disk of the 6 disk series of Star Ocean EX.  This disk continues the storyline of Claude and Rena's search for the Sorcery Globe.  They will encounter more people and challenges as they progress towards their destination, the Continent of El.  The 3rd disk certainly lives up to the name of the series.  I enjoyed it immensely.",1220486400,,343,4.573770491803279
