8290912,1,B001BNPKXM,"When you need to be convinced by an editorial review that something is a ""great value"", you likely aren't getting one. In my opinion, this 6 disc set isn't even worth $6.

The included titles, hardly are ones to take advantage of the benefits of Blu-ray in the first place, let alone ones that are considered highly desirable. At $10 per disc, you would be better off looking for inexpensive DVDs, and making sure that your Blu-ray player will also play DVDs. Then, buy the titles you actually want, as opposed to the titles that are being ""dumped"" at a ""fire sale"".

The whole purpose of Blu-ray is to offer the capability of having more special features, and higher quality for today's 1080p TVs and projectors. This set defeats that core purpose pretty handily. Never mind the fact that all of these titles are movies that didn't sell well to begin with.

The included titles are:

1. 10.5: Apocalypse
2. Catergory 7: The End of the World
3. The Curse of King Tut's Tomb
4. Blackbeard
5. The Last Sentinel
6. Artie Lange's BEER LEAGUE

Amazon even has a 10-disc Blu-ray bundle that is $6.47 cheaper, per disc! So, if you're looking for a ""great value"" (not that either of these sets are even remotely good values), what's the point of getting THIS set?

Save your money! Let wasteful spending be an exclusive purview of politicians.",1229212800,13,1335,4.635593220338983
