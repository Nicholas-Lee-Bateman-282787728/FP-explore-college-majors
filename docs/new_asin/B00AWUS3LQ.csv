8558606,5,B00AWUS3LQ,"Jeremie Renier is a very talented actor that plays Claude Francois exceedingly well, he makes you feel that Claude is still alive and the movie is real and happening live.

Everything about the movie looks real and natural. Everything is perfect, quality sound, quality picture, and the scenes are magnificent.

I would recommend this movie to everyone that loves Claude Francois or French music and french singers at this time period and also to those that are learning to know more about the french culture in those days and the language as well.

8558607,4,B00AWUS3LQ,"A French bio-pic ""Cloclo"" (aka. ""My Way"") chronicles the eventful life of a French pop superstar Claude Franois (1939-78; nicknamed ""Cloclo"") hugely popular in France during the 1960s and 70s. Sadly he is much less famous in the United States than he is in Europe, though some may remember him as the original singer of a song ""Comme d'habitude"" (based on a Jacques Revaux song, with lyrics by Gilles Thibault), which went on to become Frank Sinatra's ""My Way"" with Paul Anka's new lyrics.

""Cloclo"" begins with happy and affluent childhood of young Claude Franois living in Egypt in the 1950s. The Suez Crisis in 1956 forces Claude and his family to move to France, where, to help support his financially struggling family, Claude joins a local band as a drummer. His strict father Aim (Marc Barb), however, disapproves his son entering into show business.

Still Claude is determined to make it as a singer. His debut single in 1962 ""Le nabout twist"" was a flop, but undaunted Claude finally succeeds with a hit ""Belles, belles, belles"" (yes, a cover of The Everly Brothers' ""Girls, Girls, Girls"").

The 149-minute film is fast-paced. It often feels like jumping from one key event of the star's life to another, but the film takes enough time and care to create a credible portrayal of this complicated protagonist, who as a musician is quick to adapt to the trend, romantic and even jealous as a lover, and smart and hard-working as a businessman.

Jrmie Renier is perfect as Claude Franois. You may like or dislike the hero's personality, but either way you will be fascinated by his performance, and you will learn a few things about being a star. Equally great is Benot Magimel as Paul Lederman, a wise manager who gives some timely advice to Claude. Also, Robert Knepper briefly appears as Frank Sinatra.

The film is directed by Florent Emilio Siri, probably best known in USA as director of a 2005 action thriller ""Hostage"" starring Bruce Willis. With his slick direction and colorful period details, ""Cloclo"" is really an entertaining movie, even if you don't know anything about this legendary star.",1378339200,,2111,4.86908077994429
8558608,5,B00AWUS3LQ,I just received it but I have no doubt it is going to be a wonderful experience to see Claude Franois in person. Jeremie Renier has recreated him to such detail that it is really shocking.,1364428800,,188,4.25
