8521634,4,B007S9XXFU,"I bought this for Blood of Dracula's Castle. I have fond memories of watching this film in my youth. I was a burgeoning horror film buff and found this entertaining including John Carradine's performance and the cheesy outrageous nature of the film. Unfortunately all the prints I have seen of it since then are really poor and are minus the wolfman addition. However, this copy is much clearer than other releases ( including the numerous Millcreek collections) and has the ""holy grail"" of Robert Dix changing into a werewolf with some cool synthesizer music. Keep in mind that this found footage only runs about 10-12 minutes but it brought back mighty fond memories of Saturday afternoons watching old cool horror films. It was worth the sticky high price of 30$. Additionally the accompanying feature, The Hearse, is also a fun film and has quite a cast including Trish Van Devere and Joseph Cotton. Although, if you're reading this and debating buying this then you already know about both features. Namaste !",1501372800,,1014,4.935672514619883
8521635,4,B007S9XXFU,"This review is only for Blood of Dracula's Castle.  So-bad-it's-bad mid-to-late 60's horror film.  A dinky engaged couple inherit a castle in the middle of what appears to be the American desert.  Renting the place are a middle-aged, elegant married couple with a pair of servants.  What the dinks don't realize is that the renters are over one hundred year old vampires.  The butler is some sort of condemned murderer saved from the gallows, and the heavy-work handyman is a disfigured lurching lunk Igor type who turns out to be harder to kill than Rasputin.  There is also a visiting relative who is a homicidal maniac and a moon-baying werewolf on the side.  This family unit kidnaps young women to feed on their blood and occasionally sacrifice them to an obscure god.  The dinks now have to figure out to survive with their blood intact and take out this bloody Barker band.  The butler is an always welcome and watchable John Carradine.  The vampiric couple are the beautiful Paula Raymond and the charming, handsome and amusing Alex DArcy.  The background music seems to be culled from the original Outer Limits TV show.  The print is watchable and not bad but the film needs cleaning up and re-mastering.  Still, I believe it is the best version available and at 92 minutes probably the most complete.  Highly recommended for bad horror movie fans.",1455494400,2,1357,4.818181818181818

8521638,4,B007S9XXFU,"Depending on your tastes, the choice is yours which film is good or bad, but CASTLE has the werewolf footage that has never been seen on home video. Sure, it was directed by hack Al Adamson (whose real death outshines any of his horror films), but it is a guilty pleasure of mine and the werewolf footage brought back fond memories of watching the film on TV in the 70's. A great buy in my opinion.",1390867200,2,398,4.25
8521639,4,B007S9XXFU,"4 Stars cause the second movie sucked bad. I bought this double movie for ""The Hearse"", great movie. ""Blood Of Dracula's Castle was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Horrible acting, (no joke) and the scary vampire couple? Overly polite, non-threatening, wimpy, etc. I've seen butterflies more scary than this couple. I read the other reviews about the second movie, everyone said it was great. WRONG!",1358899200,5,418,4.901408450704225
8521640,4,B007S9XXFU,"Good transfer of ""Blood of Dracula's Castle,"" and includes an interesting interview with a member of the production team.  Katarina is trying to do the ""Elvira"" thing, but she does an OK job of making it interesting, and she seemed to at least have watched the movie.

This is the ""werewolf version,"" a little longer than some of the prints that have been bashed around on TV for years.

It's an entertaining 2-AM movie.",1351814400,4,420,4.648648648648648

8521642,1,B007S9XXFU,"Wasn't expecting much and it delivered on those terms.  Quality is washed out. Seems as if it were recorded from a movie house on a camcorder.  And as For Katarina being the host,  why?  Whom is this fat woman?.  Sorry, this review is more of a jab at a studio trying to capitalize on a washed up bimbo and poorly edited and terrible quality dvds.  Obviously packaging sells.  Contents suck!",1348790400,5,391,4.5
8521643,4,B007S9XXFU,"I bought this disc to upgrade my copy of Al Adamson's sublime ""Dracula's Castle"" and I found The Hearse to be a very lame product of its time.

But if you're looking to upgrade Dracula's Castle, here ya go. This of course is the ""werewolf version,"" one of the best examples of post-production alteration of a movie I've ever seen.",1348704000,4,330,4.5
