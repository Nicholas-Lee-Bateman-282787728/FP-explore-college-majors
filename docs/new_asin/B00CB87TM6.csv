8579640,2,B00CB87TM6,I'm not too big of a fan of either of the two Tom and Jerry versions. They are watchable but they don't have the charm of the old Hanna-Barbera Tom and Jerry's.,1390867200,2,160,4.03125
8579641,5,B00CB87TM6,"Tom and Jerry Classic! We have had this DVD for a year and it plays as if it is brand new. Sound quality, picture quality is prefect! With all the terrible cartoon tv shows out there, I am so happy that my 10year can enjoy the simple fun of Tom chasing after Jerry.",1386460800,2,265,4.018867924528302
8579642,5,B00CB87TM6,"I am amused by the cartoons they are throwing at kids today.  They, for the most part, are awful.  I loved Tom and Jerry cartoons and Bugs Bunny etc., and much to my surprise, my grandkids love these too.  You won't regret turning the little ones on to one of the all time favorite cartoon characters.  They will sit and giggle and laugh out loud.  Great stuff.",1379894400,4,361,4.3283582089552235
