For many of you who have only seen this on HBO you need to know that alot of this show was cut to fit the time slot. I had recorded it off HBO onto my DVR and i recently seen the DVD and was like ""hey this part wasn't on HBO!"" Only about 10 minutes deleted. And the etras will have you rolling even more. It is worth buying. You need this DVD in your life!!! But go and get it at a your local BestBuy for $14.99.",1116547200,,525,3.7818181818181817

1829971,5,B00008975L,i think jamie is so funny of all the stand up dvds i have bought i think this and I might need security (jamie foxx) are two of the funniest. i saw a couple of bad reviews but i really thought this stuff was some of the better stand up. matter of opinion i guess but i recommend this!,1077926400,5,284,3.830508474576271
1829972,5,B00008975L,Jamie foxx is the king of all comedy the best thing to ever happen to stand up comedy is jamie foxx nobody does it better and for a measly 20 bucks you could own a piece of jamie foxx in the form of a high quality dvd. trust me buy this dvd right now its hilarious from start to finish and i love it alot so i know you'll get it just because you love jamie.,1066521600,6,357,3.710526315789474
1829973,2,B00008975L,"I am a big stand up freak,and I checked this out because I heard it had a routine about rap's angry lyrics,and I HATE rap. So I rented this at my local video store,and I was greatly dissapointed. That was one of the only good routines in here. The first half had a couple of other decent jokes. Then the second half wasn't funny at all. His impression of a woman is so annoying. If you want to hear a good impression of a woman,check out Sam Kinison. He is hilarious. This is also is probably is the most vulgar stand up routine I have ever seen,so DO NOT let young children come CLOSE to this. Even if you are old enough,steer clear from this DVD.If you want good black comedy,check out Richard Pryor,Chris Rock,or D.L. Hughley's DVD.",1064793600,2,735,4.333333333333333
1829974,5,B00008975L,"i'm starting to watch a lot of stand up and compared to a lot of the stand ups, i think jamie foxx is my favorite so far...i like dave chappelle too...in unleashed, he made me laugh from beginning to the end...plus, i like the extras of him singing at the end...he is an amazing singer too...good enough to make his own record i bet...
some people don't like his style cuz it's too aggressive and he cusses too much but i think that makes it even more funny...he just lets go...and his facial expressions is so funny!  go get this dvd...i might need security is slightly better because it's newer but i would rate both of them 5 stars!",1061683200,4,635,4.336134453781512

7980099,3,B00008975L,Of the three stand ups that Jamie Foxx has released (I might need Security and Welcome to the Foxxhole) I think this one is the least funny. He just didn't  seem himself. I wasn't all to pleased with his performance. Wouldn't recommend to viewers. Save your money.,1401494400,,264,4.617021276595745
