8296449,5,B001E52U94,I thought this interview with Mr. Malcolm Muggeridge was rather interesting to watch and his insight within the political drift that was happening at that time. Great conversation and I enjoyed every minute of it.,1444262400,,213,5.114285714285714
8296450,3,B001E52U94,"I'm an atheist, for lack of a better label.  I have no beliefs in any deity, and keep the possibility of one as just that; a possibility.  I also happen to be an avid capitalist and believer in self restraint to avoid the abuses of foreign substances to the body.  So imagine my dismay when someone who proselytizes many of my convictions on personal conduct, yet does so for reasons I would label as delusional thinking.

Muggeridge is such a man.  He and Buckley hail from the tradition of men putting faith in the tales communicated since our distant ancestors could utter sounds intelligible by loose associations (herds, if you like) which evolved into tribes.  Tales of the great hunt, and how one member of the association with his brethren, overcame some prehistoric beast.  So it is that as more complex societies evolved, so did our own personal tales, which usually involved a code of ethics or conduct.  And so it is with Christianity and any adherence to its tenets through fear or affection by its members.

Muggeridge and Buckley discuss the merits of freedom, free will and moral conduct, but do so in the context of those things being passed down from some higher authority, as opposed to things that we developed through a combination of trusting our instincts on what was good processed through higher thinking.  It's one thing to say that it's good to eat and feed your family because you feel it is so, but it's another to search for the words to articulate it.  Buckley and Muggeridge believe that innate extinct and experience alone do not a human species make, and also assign a kind of histrionic dependency upon the deity in question.

What is more bothersome is that they speak in terms of the Judaic deity, and eschew tribal or pagan beliefs, and thus dismiss the notion that even though the Romans threw many undesireables to the lions, that they themselves had a code of conduct.  Similarly so did the Germanic tribes, the Picts, Saxons, and even places as far away as China, Japan, Thailand, or places as close as the Americas.  There's a real conceit operating here that is so self centered that one is given to wonder if, with all of their learning, if any of them had ever cracked a book on paleontology or anthropology.  Perhaps they had the passing knowledge that most have regarding early man and dinosaurs, and considering them as historic curiosities (assigning an acknowledgement that those things existed, but then turning to their own view of history to justify their philosophy), but no where do they discuss the successes of empires past who had just as much success socially as the US and UK, but without many of the technological trappings.

And so therefore this becomes a session of what critical thinking personnel label as ""preaching to the choir""; stating beliefs to an audience that already embraces whatever philosophy is espoused.  And that's why I don't care too much for this episode, but acknowledge an interest to see how educated minds can be self delusional when discussing delusional states of their political opponents.

I find it, most fascinating.

I think the viewer who is inclined towards religious thoughts (either a belief in them or who is critical of the same) will find this of interest, but would be well cautioned that they may wish to examine their own sense of chivalric conduct, and how that meshes with their own sense of freedom.  Was it something that you learned from your parents, and something that you had a say in, or did it come from some other source?  Think of any pets you have had, and how they have treated you.  Did they do it because they were instructed; was it given to them by some power outside or ability to recognize, or were they simply being ""human"", for lack of a more accurate term.  Your dog may not be able to cite Thomas Aquinas, nor Locke nor Hobbes as sources for his affection of you, but he (or she) does know that affection for you seems correct.

Watch and enjoy.",1421020800,,3975,4.702741702741703
8296451,5,B001E52U94,I always liked watching this as a kid because I learned so much. I am glad that the programs are available again. I only wish that there were more of them.,1407196800,,155,4.032258064516129
8296452,4,B001E52U94,"What a pleasant show. Buckley is a skilled orator, but clearly lacks the spiritual depth and maturity of Muggeridge. In a couple sections, Buckley seems to reveal a side of himself that was defensive of Christianity based on an economic apology rather than the truth of it. I could be wrong. Muggeridge is always such fresh air to breathe. The full hour long format felt awkward, in a good way, compared with the soundbytes of our own day. I kept thinking, ""Haven't they given him enough time to answer? If they're not careful he's going to have the opportunity to share the Gospel."" Things are unfortunately only farther along the same broad path.",1387497600,,648,4.743362831858407

We are unabashedly awash in pornography, sick in mind, body, and soul and unrepentant.  Is there even remotely a program as intelligent and prescient as William F. Buckley's Firing Line?  God rest their souls.",1373932800,2,328,5.018518518518518
8296454,5,B001E52U94,"I saw William F. Buckley, Jr.'s interview of Malcolm Muggeridge when it aired on ""Firing Line"" years ago. After that show, I eagerly awaited a rerun of this same episode, and watched it with the same focus and rapt attention as I did the first time it aired. This was my fist introduction to Muggeridge, and I found him to be not only cultured and erudite, but also affable, charismatic and witty.  I'm so glad to see this is  available on Amazon, and  can't wait to receive it.",1287100800,2,478,4.409090909090909

8296456,5,B001E52U94,"Absolute moral individualism and its implications on Western society are discussed. Rousseau had claimed that his work could not be understood by one reading alone, and the analysis of Muggeridge in this discussion really requires very much the same kind of diligence for the observer in order to fully grasp the discourse.",1262131200,3,323,5.230769230769231
