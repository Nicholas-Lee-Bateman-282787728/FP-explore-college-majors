8335006,2,B001Q4N9PC,"What is so very hard to understand about artists like Teddy pendegrass, The Ojays, Al green, and Barry White is that with all the video taped concerts of these R%B legends in the vaults, why do the producers make such poor choices, or no choices at all for DVD??  It is amazing that there is not one single good DVD concert of Barry White (In Gernany was terrible), and no R&B concerts of Al Green or The Ojays at all!!...None!  Teddy Pendergrass has several very good concerts in the late 1970s (in addition to Live '79) which would be excellent represntations of his career, yet we are offerred a concert AFTER his accident in 1982, when his wonderful voice was compromised by age and singing from a sitting position.  It is very sad that now that that there is the technology..some of the greatest music legends of our time are being neglected in favor of pushing ""freaks"" like ""Lady Gaga"" and ""sex symbols like Beyonce to the 18-35 demongraphic.  In twenty years you can be sure no one will be listing to either of these ""fabricated"" pop stars...soo sad.",1265673600,13,1058,4.582010582010582
