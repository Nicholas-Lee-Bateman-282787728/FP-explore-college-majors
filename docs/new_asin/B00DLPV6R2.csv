8594304,5,B00DLPV6R2,"I hate them, but I love them! These workouts are guaranteed to kick. your. butt.

I'm in my mid-50's and have lost a good bit of stamina / strength, so starting back in the mix with these has been a serious challenge, but very worthwhile.

No lie - they are tough even if you're in decent shape, but stick with it and the rewards will be obvious.",1515283200,,346,4.149253731343284
8594305,5,B00DLPV6R2,"I haven't done a Bob Harper workout in nearly 10 years. I'm a huge Jillian Michaels fan and discovered her through The Biggest Loser a decade ago and have been using her DVDs ever since. About a month ago I was looking for a change in pace to get past my fitness plateau. I remembered Bob Harper from a BL workout I did back in the day, and thought I'd check out what he has to offer. He's extremely motivational with a ""no-nonsense"" attitude. You really feel like you have someone cheering you on through the whole workout. While the exercises don't stray far from what you see in many other DVDs, the pace is very different and you'll spend longer doing strength-building and heart-pumping exercises than you usually will. After an exhausting minute-long set of front and side raises, he'll just have you hold the weights up for a while--and then do it again. Trust me, you WILL feel the burn if you do these workouts right. You will be over your plateau in no time. My absolute favorite in this set is Pure Burn Super Strength. It's a great full-body workout I like to do several times a week. With Jillian's DVDs, I usually dreaded any workouts longer than 40 minutes and was never sure why. Most of the Bob Harper workouts I've done are close to an hour and the time just flies by and by the time you're done, your limbs are already jelly. Highly recommended!!",1483056000,,1365,4.464
8594306,5,B00DLPV6R2,I did the 60 minute workout and love it.  The exercise moves quickly from pose to pose from easy and gradually getting harder.  Some poses are challenging which I am not at that level currently.  This will be the room for me to improve.  I only feel encourage to do better and challenge myself in this set.,1443571200,,306,4.315789473684211

8594310,5,B00DLPV6R2,this series of worouts videos are the best. I got this as a gift for my sister. She loves it. I have been using the Bob Harper workout videos for several months. I have seen a huge difference in my strength and have firmed up. I love these workouts.,1421107200,,249,4.1020408163265305
8594311,5,B00DLPV6R2,"I bought this used, but it was in great condition. I love the value this DVD provides. 4 DVDs - a variety of simple to difficult workouts. I mix and match some of his shorter options and sometimes just go through the full hour workouts. There are a few bonus items like quick food fixes and 20 minute group workouts. My favorites are the hour long cardio and training sessions. There is a 10 min glute challenge that you will definitely feel the next day. Bob really pushes you hard and even his simple exercises are difficult if you do them right. I am so glad I made this purchase, and with the variety, I can use it over and over again, switching it up each time and I don't get bored.",1415145600,,688,4.21969696969697
