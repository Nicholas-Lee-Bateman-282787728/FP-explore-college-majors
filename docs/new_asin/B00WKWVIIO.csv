7132917,5,B00WKWVIIO,"This film is a foreign suspense thriller that you will need to pay attention to as it is easy to get sidetracked in some scenes due to the depth that the story goes to build it's plotting and keep you guessing.  It is not an action film, but does give you that ewwwwe effect as it deals with a triple murder and kidnapping involving a mother and father who are victims of beatings and psychological torture before they are murdered and their daughter is taken from them to be tortured to death.  This is a story about the detective on the case as he works feverishly as if one possessed as he races against all odds to save the next victims he knows will soon be in the perpetrator's sites.  This film is based on a novel and, instead of trying to dazzle us with action and pyrotechnics, works to keep us on the edge of our seats and on our toes as the detective puts the clues together to come up with a startling and satisfying conclusion.",1437523200,9,941,4.275280898876405
7132918,4,B00WKWVIIO,"I'm rooting for the detective, get him, get, him, please, OMG. I wanted to jump into the movie and beat this creep myself. If someone told me to stop, I'm sorry, I would have to keep going with all I had left in me. Messed up, nasty, demented, MONSTER. Sick. Praying on the innocent for his Treatment. Weirdo, sicko, uggh.
Great acting.",1437177600,3,336,4.435483870967742
7132919,5,B00WKWVIIO,"For very mature audiences do to subject matter. Most of the abuse is described rather than shown, but there are a few very disturbing images. Similar to the orginal Mindhunter movie.",1436572800,6,182,4.903225806451613
7132920,4,B00WKWVIIO,"Crazy Film. I Gave this one a 4.5 out of 5. If you like Detective movies with a sick and twisted killer. then this is for you. It runs the lines as The TV Show True Detective but gets more twisted at the end here. I have to say The treatment had me on the edge of my seat screaming for that detective to get up he is getting away. This guy needs to be caught.

Pick it up. I'm still coming down from watching this film as I type. Would love to hear your thoughts as well.

On a Artsplotation Film note: The Blu-Ray Disc is BD-R. From there Facebook Page this is the last one before they start pressing Future Releases as they have gotten the correct equipment.

Being BD-R doesn't take away from the Picture Quality and or sound as they both are great. The Differences are BD-R will start degrading in about 20 Years compared to the pressed copies they have a life span of 100 years.",1435968000,9,883,4.152046783625731
7132921,3,B00WKWVIIO,"I suppose it was a well made film. The acting was great. The subject matter, well, I wouldn't recommend it for that. This is one of the darkest films I've ever seen about some of the darkest subject matter ever. I can't recommend it overall.",1503187200,2,241,4.377777777777778
7132922,2,B00WKWVIIO,"the plot sputters throughout the movie, an occasional nice twist followed by crap until the next plot twist.  the acting is ok, some of the plot twists are interesting but one of the main plot catalysts is never explained in a useful way so the movie doesn't hang together very well.",1495843200,2,283,4.549019607843137
7132923,4,B00WKWVIIO,it was about pedophiles and it is tough to watch ....the real thing is a horror ...so this would be appalling and unwatchable to most people ....It was frustrating to see ho the detective is so powerless when he is dealing with real psychopaths ...this is a complicated lunatic and a very complicated plot that is all over the place....the detective was a bit too frenzied from beginning to end...other than that the twists and turns and red herrings are plentiful .....if you like hannibal lecter type stuff ....this might work for you ..but he was charming ...this villain is just FOUL..,1494115200,2,589,4.784313725490196
7132924,5,B00WKWVIIO,"I loved this film and it has stayed with me for awhile.  The acting was super and fortunately the music was just enough to set the scenes and not all Hollywood....oh, oh something bad is going to happen.
As for the people who watch foreign films and then complain because they're not in English, here's a clue for you.  If you can't pronounce  the names of the actors, it's probably Foreign!!!!!!!

7132934,2,B00WKWVIIO,"A serial killer film mainly about body fluids, sperm, piss and female hormones.  I won't spoil the fun but I doubt the pedophilic sex acts suggested in this film are even possible, which renders the whole thing pretty ridiculous. It's sad that young European filmmakers seem so determined to out-gross Hollywood and even sadder that they are succeeding.  This film is gross and degrading.  That said, excepting the main male detective who is in a constant state of histrionics, the acting is good.  It's a 2nd rate Silence of the Lambs.",1456963200,2,536,4.857142857142857

7132938,5,B00WKWVIIO,"Tremendous movie, quite dark but stunning in its portrayal of twisted people including a frankly malicious pedophile first portrayed in the movie in almost innocent physical play with a small boy, both all smiles and laughing but with an undertow of incipient molestation that's hair-raising in the context of an adult using his absolute power advantage to seduce the boy.. The impact of this scene is certainly powerful on second viewing after the viewer has been exposed to unfolding horrors but on initial viewing I bet many will not sense the dangers of this adult's impulses since we all tend to trust what seems to be reasonable behavior until faced with evil that can't be denied.",1447200000,3,687,4.931034482758621
7132939,2,B00WKWVIIO,Choppy plot.,1447113600,,12,5.5
7132940,5,B00WKWVIIO,"Based on the novel by Carl Joos this is one of those crime thrillers that easily transcends the language barrier and sweeps you along with it; being mostly in Dutch with some French. It centres around Inspector Nick Cafmeyer (Geert Van Rampelberg of the excellent Broken Circle Breakdown) he is called to investigate a kidnapping where a mother, father and their son have been abducted and held prisoner. When the police arrive the kidnapper has gone taking the boy.

Cafmeyer can not help but get personally involved as his own brother was kidnapped years before and has never been found. What transpires is a rip roaring roller coaster ride into the dark World of child abduction and does contain scenes that some will find upsetting.

This is brilliantly acted, directed and shot. The make up is pretty good too and the whole thing comes in a story that will keep you on the edge of your seat till nigh on the last frame. Absolutely brilliant, brilliantly dark and totally recommended.",1445904000,3,988,4.805882352941176
7132941,3,B00WKWVIIO,"Just wasn't there. Some intense acting, nice cinematography, and parts where you think it's going to pick up, but it just left me neither liking or disliking. An unfulfilling, frustrating kind of vibe, with an ending of ""Ahh no, are you kidding me."" If you're having an angst-y kind of day, this may provide you some company till you feel better.",1445040000,2,346,4.688524590163935
7132942,3,B00WKWVIIO,Well done. Subtitled,1443139200,,20,6.0
7132943,2,B00WKWVIIO,Didn/t like this movie.  Didn't like the book either.,1441411200,,53,4.888888888888889
7132944,3,B00WKWVIIO,"Detective witnessed as a child his brother being abducted. He never saw his brother again. Since then there have been a few child molestation/abduction cases he works hard on as a way of ""saving his brother"". There is a serial child killer on the loose. And he is trying to solve the case.

This movie is disturbing. It deals with very sick demented people. I would go as far as to say that who ever wrote this movie was pretty disturbed as well. It would take a dark mind to think this up. The movie has a very sick ending that will bother you to the core. And what goes on in the movie will get to you as well. It reminds me of the ""Silence of the Lambs"" where the serial killer is on the loose doing what he does to women. You see the one episode of the woman down in the well in the basement at the killer's house. Well this movie is like that. Only the victims are kids and in some instances their mom's and dad's. It also reminds me of the movie ""The Taken"" with Liam Nielsen. It does not give you a good feeling of your fellow humans. It leaves you with this sick feeling in your stomach. Almost helpless. I gave this movie 3 stars as it did have an impact on me emotionally. I almost wanted to cry. And it definitely made me think about the events and how tortured the main character was and how tortured the little victims and their families were/are. But that is it. I wouldn't suggest anyone necessarily watch it for entertainment's sake. I have no idea who the audience is for this. Film critics? Academies? I dunno.",1441238400,2,1528,4.232876712328767
7132945,5,B00WKWVIIO,"Excellent film.  Subject matter was stark and brutal.  Nothing like American movies. If you are squeamish about sex crimes involving children don't watch this. It is very realistic plus the acting is so good it really puts you on the edge of your seat. The bad guy in this film is a total nut job and is nothing like the psycho's in American films. The audience cannot relate to him on any level of existence (at least I couldn't, thank heavens).  He is a filthy, slobbering, smelly person who in America would seem like a street transient.  So, if you watch this movie.....lock your doors. You just saw the Bogyman.",1441238400,6,616,4.572727272727272

7132947,1,B00WKWVIIO,"A movie about a disgusting series of crimes, (child abuse), and an incompetant detective who had no business carrying a badge.  You spend the evening yelling at him because his neuroses cause him NOT to see what's going on.  Perversely (a word I use here appropriately), the detective's stupidity causes a cosmic payback to him at the end of the film.  Very sorry I spent (wasted) an evening on this junk.",1439942400,2,405,4.676056338028169
7132948,3,B00WKWVIIO,"Exceedingly dark which is something  I like,  but we have been too trained to think a cop would be able. To go off the rails as. Often as our hero does.  The storyline is darker than Lambs,  and the photography is a terribly good underlining of the deviant.... Reminded me. Of Fincher at times  but this director has a bit of a different style.  It would be good to look for his next movie",1438300800,,389,4.1891891891891895
7132949,5,B00WKWVIIO,"Pretty creepy. As noted by other posters, there is nothing graphic, like perverted nudity, but I'm telling you, this is an intense movie. The villain is about as bad as they come.",1438214400,,179,4.625
7132950,1,B00WKWVIIO,"I thought it was horrible. I don't recall the description indicating it was about ""sexual"" abuse of children and so explicit.  Also knew a foreign film but didn't see that it wasn't in the American language.",1438214400,,207,4.75
8713676,5,B00WKWVIIO,"Being a horror hound, it's hard to find dramas that knock me down. This attempted it many times. You see the same theme in different circumstances, it is definitely shocking, psychologically and physically. But it's so damn good! Acting is superb and it does what alot of movies try to do when it comes to child sex crimes. I can handle alot but this still made me feel like I needed a shower. It's such a fantastic story though and it required 3 viewings for me to put everything together. Happy watching! NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART!",1532995200,,534,4.459183673469388
8713677,4,B00WKWVIIO,"Overall, it was a very good movie and like most 2-hour movies it does drag in a few spots but the momentum is not lost. Probably a lot more reality here than I care to know about but its a good cast with enough twists and plot flaws to keep you talking about it afterwards. Youll need a brainwashing to clear out some of what you just saw. Once again, it gets dinged for not being in English, not English dubbed nor sub-titled. If you're streaming it read the product details and see that its English [CC] which means you have to turn on the Closed Captions to read it in English because its a foreign film and the whole world doesnt speak English. Also, the captions are not always in synch with the speakers. Some of the sick folks in this movie would make Hannibal Lecter a viable candidate for a babysitter.",1523664000,,811,4.30718954248366
8713678,5,B00WKWVIIO,Excellent!,1517356800,,10,10.0
8713679,1,B00WKWVIIO,"Usually suspense  thrillers are among my favorite movies. This movie turned me off on many levels. As often happens in this type of flick, the main character is driven by some personal demons and is frantic to solve the crime.  This portrayal is way over the top. The ""troll"" references during the film don't seem to have anything to do with it, especially when voiced by the children.  another review remarked that the ""bad"" guy seemed to be extreme even for this type of movie; I agree.  It must have taken a lot of time and research to come up with this particular situation and the predator's reaction to it.  Very dark, very disquieting and very disappointing ending  Maybe I was looking for some relief during the final scene. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I gave it 1 point for filming and tension.",1515110400,,819,4.575342465753424
8713680,2,B00WKWVIIO,"I gave this two stars because the story was good, cinematography good, characters good but (and I am not a prude) I didn't feel the need for such graphic representation of the actual abuse. It could have been eluded to without showing it. It was unnecessary and by default less creative. Just be forewarned. I watch tons of detective shows and I believe in awareness but this one gave me nightmares. I didn't need those images in my head.",1514505600,,438,4.556962025316456
8713681,3,B00WKWVIIO,"It's a decent detective story and started well but the pedophile character seemed unrealistic. As if someone struggled to create the most disgusting thing possible and tried too hard. :) But in the end, the pedophile appeared to be just a pitiful sick man whom himself was living in a nightmare and the police officer was overemotional and kind of simple. And the worst thing ever - he lost the chance to learn about his brother. Maybe if he was more open-minded and flexible - he would get the information. I would say the ending is cruel.",1512172800,,540,4.577319587628866

8713683,5,B00WKWVIIO,5 stars forward the acting and the quality.  But certainly not because I enjoyed it. This was very disturbing but needed to be told. Bc it happens do much. These are the real Monsters.  Only treatment forward them is in hell.,1510704000,,225,4.463414634146342
