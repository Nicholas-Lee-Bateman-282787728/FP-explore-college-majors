8623348,4,B00GHPBRKY,"Jazz Age morality tale that is rather curious. Rich parents throw nightly jazz parties where everyone is cheating on everyone else. Mostly heavy petting shown. Their son Jack falls for poor girl, daughter of poor pharmacist. Poor girl May McAvoy trys to get Jack to change his ways but does he? Later the Pharmacist shows up for a ""reckoning""! Worthwhile with a lot of jazz age partying. Includes lots of shenanigans with a girl swinging on a swing in the midst of carousing people. Gives a real flavor of the era. Print is pretty good for unrestored Alpha release.",1494460800,,565,4.717171717171717
