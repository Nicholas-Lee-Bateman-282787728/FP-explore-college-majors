8142283,5,B000HXDWT6,"Wow! I fell in love with the album ""Land of Look Behind"" by K. Leimer in the early 1980s. It was the soundtrack of this movie which was filmed by a friend of the Bob Marley family after his death, at their request. And it was produced by Werner Herzog, who I had never heard of and now treasure as my favorite director by far.",1437264000,,326,4.030769230769231

8142285,5,B000HXDWT6,This is an honest unvarnished look at part of Jamaica that is never seen by the tourists.  Just a realistic look at Jamaica and some of the country people in a wild untamed part of the island.  I long to return and travel the land of look behind.,1347321600,,246,4.104166666666667

8142287,5,B000HXDWT6,"What a great film this is, one of my favourite reggae related films, but if it's reggae your after then this isn't a documentary about reggae, it's basically a view of local people in JA, giving interviews with local rastas and some special interviews with Mutabaruka + Gregory Isaacs. A really spiritual film, a meditation.

Nice one Ryko for re-releasing this one......",1158364800,4,371,4.983870967741935
8142288,5,B000HXDWT6,"This is one of my favorite documentaries, and I'm so happy that Ryko has released it on DVD. The back story that I heard from friends about this film--and I'll admit I don't know if it's true--is that a group of German filmmakers arrived in Jamaica to make a documentary about life in the Jamaican countryside. But shortly after they arrived there and began filming, Bob Marley passed away and life-as-usual in Jamaica came to a screeching halt. The film then bacame a meditation on the life of the Jamaican sufferer and, indirectly, an homage to the life of Bob Marley. If you're looking for star-power or hot reggae musical performances, this may not be the movie for you. Apart from a live Gregory Isaacs song paying tribute to Marley, there isn't much live music. What this film does have is a lot of very poor, very honest and well-spoken Jamaican people talking about their philosophies of life, their religion, and their hardships. This film contains some great cinematography of both the Jamaican countryside and Kingston. But what really makes it unique is the filmmakers willingness to put a microphone in front of a lot of people that aren't usually heard and just let the cameras roll.

As an aside, the film also contains an interesting segment with Mutabaruka.",1157587200,7,1274,4.8173515981735155
8142289,5,B000HXDWT6,"An excellent documentary style film, starts off in an area in Jamaica called ""Look Behind"" and ""Cockpit"" basically Jamaica's countryside/jungle, interviews the locals there who seem to be mainly rastafarian, gives a great insight into the local culture and how much of an influence Bob Marley has had upon them. Then moves onto the city and interviews Gregory Isaacs in his office, then u get to see him perform, wicked act. Some great scenes of Bob Marleys funeral showing the huge amount of people that turned out that day. Lui Lepke performs to the huge crowd a great song dedicated to Bob Marley.

A Must have film for any collector of JA/Carribean film, or any Reggae collectors, a real gem capturing the spirit of the times on film.",1136246400,4,738,4.765625
