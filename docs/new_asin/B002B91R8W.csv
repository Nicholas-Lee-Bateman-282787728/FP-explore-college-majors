8360860,5,B002B91R8W,"Johnny Weissmuller = Tarzan. This is simple mathmatics, a fact, just as 2 + 2 = 4. Thus even if another actor plays Tarzan, as many do, they are just actors playing Tarzan, but not the real thing. Even if they are superb. Even if the movie is wonderful and a pleasure to watch. Yet, while this is true, it must be admitted that Lex Barker makes a superb Tarzan. The movie is well-worth watching.

Barker is the tenth actor to play Tarzan. He moves about like a younger version of Weissmuller. He speaks in brief phrases like he spoke. But, being younger, he is more agile. Like Weissmuller, he, as Tarzan, is unable to read. He will play Tarzan in five films. This is the last film that Brenda Joyce acts as Jane. As usual, Chetta the chimpanzee has a star role, performing many laughable antics.

Chetta and her friend, another chimpanzee, find a crashed airplane, that had contained a famous woman. The plane crashed twenty years ago. People think that she is dead. Tarzan knows that she is still alive and living in a hidden area with people who retain their youth because of the water they drink. These people do not want anyone to know about them. Tarzan promised them that he would never reveal their secret or their location. Unscrupulous men find out about the area and force Jane to take them to the place so that they can get the water and make a fortune.",1309737600,3,1365,4.456

8360862,4,B002B91R8W,"Lex Barker brought a breath of fresh air in a series that had gotten stale related to Johnny Weismuller succumbing to the inevitable aging process. He was really built like one would have expected Tarzan to look like and was very athletic. The story lines in his series of movies were sporadic in their quality and he did his best to make the best of them. Still, not a bad beginning for the new star.",1257638400,5,401,4.36
8360863,3,B002B91R8W,"First off, let me give you all the negatives; the Warner Archive Collection at the WB site sells this title for nearly $10 less than Amazon; there are no special features, subtitles, nor even a scene index; the encrypting process prevents this DVD from playing on any DVD player with recording capabilities (which means you probably won't be able to play this on your PC).

Now, the positives! ""Tarzan's Magic Fountain"" marks Lex Barker's first appearance in the loincloth, after Johnny Weissmuller was 'retired' to ""Jungle Jim"" adventures. Not quite thirty when the film was produced, Barker, with an ancestry dating back to the Mayflower (and an Ivy League dropout, to boot!), has a relaxed, easy-going sophistication that Weissmuller lacked (it's a shame producer Sol Lesser demanded he continue the ""Me, Tarzan"" characterization; he obviously seems smarter than this!). Blessed with a chiseled physique, boyish smile, and an ability to look comfortable in the 'uniform', his lack of acting talent is not a hindrance in the role! Another plus is the return of Brenda Joyce as Jane, in her last appearance in the series. Despite being two years older than Barker, she sparkles far more than any subsequent Jane in the Barker films. Together, the pair are quite enjoyable (as is Cheetah, who, as always, provides comic relief).

The plot is a jungle variation of ""Lost Horizon"", as long-missing aviatrix Gloria James (Evelyn Ankers) reappears in the jungle after twenty years, still looking 25. When she returns from England with her wrongly jailed love (Alan 'Alfred' Napier), she's aged to 50 (but looks SEVENTY!), and she is also accompanied by local con men Charles Drake and Albert Dekker, hoping to discover her Fountain of Youth. Tarzan, who'd promised the rather Caucasian-looking tribe to keep their location secret, refuses to take the group...but Jane (who's seen the secret valley) takes them, instead...and Tarzan will have to save the day, for everybody!

Shot on a tiny budget, and with a 73-minute running time, there is plenty of use of stock footage and the studio 'jungle' set, but the production is well-mounted, and the end result, never less than entertaining!",1252022400,11,2183,5.109243697478991
8360864,5,B002B91R8W,"Well, I'm thrilled this film is finally available.
It's my favorite tarzan film and, for those who are wondering, yes, the video here is well worth having.
The picture is sharp, the sound is good. No complaints at all.
These are unlike any DVD's I've seen though.
They are described as authorized editions. The packaging is what you would expect. Each disc has a nice factory-like appearance. There is a main menu and some coming attractions or trailers.
They do appear to be DVD-R.
They play perfectly in my Sony DVD player but they would not play in my Samsung.
Just thought I'd throw that all out there and I hope the information is useful.
Again, this Lex Barker series is well worth having, in my opinion.
I can't remember seeing them look better than they do on these DVD editions. :D",1250812800,12,790,4.570422535211268
