What an excellent documentary, and testament to a group of people with tenacity, style, and the courage to pursue a dream for themselves. I got so involved with the story lines that I actually sent an e-mail to the director of the 5-4-7 Art Center, asking how things turned out for them and Studio 804 (who designed and built the building); I wish they would do a re-issue of this show, with an update of how things turned out for everyone. But I want to emphasize that this is a beautiful presentation of humanity and the will to overcome obstacles that most of us would just give up on. I consider myself very fortunate to own a copy of this series; simply outstanding material.",1480896000,,764,4.425531914893617

8326621,5,B001NF6T0G,"I enjoyed this show on TV and am glad to find it on DVD.  Good quality; the DVD does have subtitles (completely unnecessary)which are easily turned off through the main menu of the DVDs.  A great story is told here; about the environment and city planning, along with emotional and funny parts throughout.",1241395200,2,305,4.735849056603773
