3875379,1,B0028YW37O,"So bad that a week after viewing it, I couldn't tell you a thing about it other than it was really bad. That's saying a lot from a guy that likes, or at least tries to find value in any movie I watch. Acting can be bad. If it is bad enough, then the movie could have merit for that. You get the idea. I couldn't find anything about this movie to make it a ""watch this if you ..."" Just no redeeming qualities at all.",1272499200,2,415,3.8372093023255816
3875380,4,B0028YW37O,"I originally bought this movie because Cure Gravity (the Oshawa rock band) sings 'So Amazing' at the big finale.  For sure it is a 'B' movie.  But it is a good one.  If your into scantily clad women running around slaying monsters and then having a big party to celebrate, then this is for you.
Finally it actually has a pretty good story line but gets corny a lot.",1253577600,11,365,4.260869565217392
3875381,1,B0028YW37O,"Last night I watched this movie with friends. We expected a B-movie, but this was far below that standard. I got the impression that someone with little to no experience in filmmaking and a ton of money gathered the right people and the right equipment on the production side of things. Then they proceeded to do everything wrong in writing, directing, acting, and post-production. We sat through the entire thing looking at the clock and wondering when it was going to entertain us. It never did.

Here's where I thought the film went awry:

Story
- There's not enough of it. The film could be edited down to a five minute short, and would still have time for all of the topless female eye candy. All but a very small portion of the film is filler, and it's not entertaining filler.
- For pity's sake, get a decent comedy writer if you're going to make a comedic film!

Characters
- You have a feature-length amount of time to do some character development, and you don't use it? It'd be generous to call the characters flat. I'll go with the word 'unrealized'.

Pacing
- Someone had editing ADD! 10 to 15 second transition sequences where loud music plays are very common. There appears to be no reason behind most of these.
- Even bad comedy can work with the right timing/pacing. Many of the attempted comedic sequences drag on. It's like watching a bad comedian perform to a silent audience. Excruciating!

Music
- Playing music with lyrics over character dialogue? Not a good idea.
- The music consistently didn't fit the scene. For example: Comedic music was played during scenes where there was no intended comedy.

Sound Effects
- The same stock sound effects are overused throughout. Gamers will recognize a lot of ""DOOM sounds"".

Who knows... maybe this studio will redeem themselves with the sequel that this vapid, onerous drag of a film promises will follow. I honestly hope so, because the nearly criminal waste of production resources in the first should never happen again.",1251504000,3,1990,4.750724637681159

3875387,4,B0028YW37O,"Jason Parks (Landy Cannon), romantic, optimist, and  world's worst story teller laments over the break up with his girlfriend Jasmine (Vanessa James) who he has known since high school. But Wait! He gets a chance to win her back on a group camping trip. Jasmine is joined by her lover Marlene (Haley Shannon) something Jason remains clueless about until the end because he ""knows when something is right."" They pick a location where Summer Vale (Brigitte Kingsley) disappeared as a young girl, something that involved her father, a book, and demons which we get in the first scene. Renee (Julia Schneider) happens to secure that exact same book and knows the spot of the disappearance because of a scene that they cut which shows up in the deleted scenes, thank you. Needless to say bad props and bad acting abound when they get there.

The story is low budget and campy. It goes for the dialogue and laughs. It is light on horror and credible fight scenes with ""characters  [that] come off a bit superficial.""  In that regard the film is fun to watch for those who like the cheese.

The second one was better (Agency of Vengeance: Dark Rising).  Continuity was thrown out the window in lots of places - getting from the woods, back to the apartment, and back to the woods on foot - and all kinds of confusing time warp/missing time crap that is never really explained.

3875393,5,B0028YW37O,"This movie has a lot of heart behind it.  Yes, it's low budget and that shows through in some places, but there are superb comedy moments, many beautiful shots, and a deep enough storyline that you can only grasp the surface level upon the first viewing.  I've watched this at least 5 times.

Brigitte Kingsley and Julia Schneider are powerful, sexy and adorable.  Landy Cannon and Jay Reso complement each other so well that they seem like they've been friends for years, and their sense of comic timing is impeccable.  Andrew Cymek provides a stellar script with the perfect mixture of religious/mystical overtones and science fiction.

This lesser-known movie is a rare gem.  It's got a similar feel to Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Specifically Season 4 of Buffy where there's a mix of sci-fi and government agency involvement.)  If you like occult/witchy themes, old leather-bound tomes from magic bookstores, parallel dimensions, demons, and battle princesses, you will like Dark Rising.

After you've watched this, there are two TV series (The Savage Tales of Summer Vale and Dark Rising: Warrior of Worlds) and a feature length sequel (Agency of Vengeance - Dark Rising 2: Summer Strikes Back) all of which I am looking forward to seeing as soon as they make it to the US.",1404864000,9,1276,4.925233644859813

3875395,4,B0028YW37O,"I didn't know what to expect when I bought this movie. I was surprised! It was a real hoot. It's campy in the same vein as anything by Bruce Campbell. Jay Reso (Christian from the WWE) shows he has a real talent for doing movies. His sense of humor shines through. There's good looking dudes, lesbian love scenes, a demon with his organs on the outside and a girl with a battleaxe. This movie has everything a night with a beer and a bowl of popcorn demands for a fun evening! Kudos!",1322438400,,483,4.260869565217392
3875396,4,B0028YW37O,"This movie is a fantasy-horror-comedy that could have been a Bruce Campbell production.  In fact, the leading actor, Landy Cannon, could pass for Campbell's younger brother.  If you have ever seen a Bruce Campbell production, then you understand precisely what I'm talking about and what to expect.  For those not familiar with Japanese television, Doguchan (Kodai Shojo Doguchan) was a popular series about a woman demon hunter played by a young, amply-endowed actress in a bikini-like costume - exactly as in this movie.  At the beginning of the Japanese program, a caption thoughtfully cautions the viewer that the following is ""Junk Drama.""  Neither this movie nor Doguchan takes itself seriously, and neither should you!  Just sit back, put your brain in  neutral, and enjoy the fun!",1320364800,11,788,5.2063492063492065

3875398,2,B0028YW37O,"Dark Rising is one of the campiest films I've seen all year!  I have a hard time knowing whether it's the kind of campiness that's appealing to me on some unexplainably goofy level, or just downright pathetic.

The film actually stars WWE wrestler Christian.  What a surprise it was to see him staring in something so outrageously bad!  Then again, his WWE character seems to fit in perfectly with this kind of over the top storyline.

Want me to explain the storyline?  Okay, I guess I can do that... I think.  Wait wait...  Alright, I'm ready to explain it.

It's about a warrior princess (no, not Xena, but someone JUST as hot!) who goes back and forth through portals from the normal world to some demon-infested world.  The demon is literally a regular guy dressed up in a monster costume with fake blood and fake teeth, LOL.  At least the movie writers have a big sense of humor.

Anyway, a group of young adults (who happen to be dealing with their OWN unbelievably far-fetched situations) encounter one of those demons in the woods.  Luckily for them, Xena-wannabe lady is a GOOD warrior!  She fights to protect the innocent!

It turns out that, because of her good looks and her supermodel body, and the fact that one of the young adults happens to be a good lookin' guy, the two of them hit off a relationship... but not before the guy learns that his high school sweetheart prefers women over men.  Yup, I *told* you the young adults had problems of their own!  This takes up a good portion of the storyline as well.

WWE wrestler Christian plays the young adult too, even though he's by *far* too old for that particular role by this point in his life (plus his face is lookin' pretty beat up these days).

I just find it absolutely hilarious how the writers tried making the problems involving the young adults seem *just* as important as trying to figure out how to survive a horrible night in the woods involving a killer demon on the hunt for human blood!  At times it was like the young adults and their typical relationship problems were more important than simply staying alive, LOL.

The storyline is so unbelievably OUT there that you can't possibly sit there and tell me you were really interested in it.  Don't EVEN tell me that!

So yeah, this is one of those ""It's so bad, it's good"" type of films.  I believe Dark Rising fits that description right on the freakin' money.

Be careful not to stir up any princesses with axes or demons with a craving for human flesh while watching Dark Rising!  You may be the next unfortunate victim!",1281139200,,2559,4.544857768052516
3875399,4,B0028YW37O,"Everything you want in a B-movie.  I was shocked as of late, most of these flicks I've been buying have been horrible.  This was very enjoyable.  There was ACTUALLY a bit of production value in this.  They spent some time & money on the bad guys, it was well lit (even at night), plenty of gags & beautiful women.  Story was ok, could've used a little more depth in plot, but not much more.  We really aren't looking for angst in these movies now are we?  Plenty of comedy to keep it moving.  Fight scenes were ok.  Dont know if it was the actors or stunt coordinators lack showing.  Jay Reso aka Christian Cane would've been nice seeing him do a few things as his wrestling background shows he can take a hit & do a fall.  Alas, he's comic relief so can't have him ""manning up"".  Overall I liked it a lot.  Not quite up to Roger Corman or Andy Sidaris quality.  4.5 actual stars.",1275436800,,880,4.22289156626506
3875400,5,B0028YW37O,"I was surfing the cable stations one weekend when I came across the last 30 minutes of Dark Rising. I said, ""I have to have that DVD."" Fortunately, I found it. The movie is a hoot, and the special features are interesting as well. Who would have thought that a pro wrestler named ""Christian"" (Jason Reso, if memory serves) would have the most intelligent comentary on the movie? If you are considering this movie, buy it. The movie starts off slow, but picks up speed as it goes, and the last half of the movie is too campy to be believed. Who thought of having Landy Cannon take out Christian using his own pro wrestling move ... the kill switch?",1273708800,,647,4.4

8357227,3,B0028YW37O,"This movie kinda looks like a film school senior project. They did the best they could with the resources available. The acting is not that bad, the actors did what they were asked to do pretty well. The story, direction and script were bad. Not offensively bad, just silly and inept. The fight scenes were terrible. The props were lame, but the CGI was not too bad. There were topless lesbian make out scenes and the scenery was good. I really hoped for less from Brigitte Kingsley. She did not wear much (quite enjoyable) but never took anything off except her helmet (what a disappointment). I marked out when Summer dispatched Ricky with the ""Unprettier"".

8357234,5,B0028YW37O,"I really can't recall how I stumbled over Dark Rising. Perhaps that's just as well as this is a rare B-Movie that has sufficient charm to overcome how bad it really is and go onto become a real guilty pleasure.

The plot is simple a man goes on a camping trio to try and convince his ex to rekindle their relationship. They take a long some friends for the ride. Then in the best horror tradition things go wrong. First there's a demon and then a demon slayer. Somehow the ex-girlfriend gets turned into a demon, there's fights, gore, cheap special effects, bad acting, a weak plot - the lot really. It manages to tick every B-Movie box quite nicely. There is brief female nudity so be warned.

I can't tell if this is supposed to be a vehicle for Landy Cannon or for Brigitte Kingsley. Cannon's acting is so woeful that he fits the B-Movie theme perfectly. Brigitte Kingsley is both lovely and lethal and her acting isn't the worst by far in this movie.

I'd have to call this a B-Movie guilty pleasure which manages to rise above the norm to be amusing and watchable. Certainly recommended as a late night with a couple of beers movie and a great alternative to the Wraith.",1446163200,4,1175,4.430555555555555

8357236,3,B0028YW37O,"Okay, I'm not proud that I watched this one, but it wasn't terrible for a low-budget flick. The story has some pretty big holes. The acting is a bit strained. The monsters are cheesy. But there are some redeeming qualities. It's interesting to see the development of the male lead character. I think the actor pulled it off pretty well, really. The plucky comic relief guy does the best he can with modest material to give a fair performance, all things considered. I've seen much worse and less entertaining movies. I guess I shouldn't be too proud of that, either. Well, whatever. If you've got the time and enjoy this kind of thing, you could do worse than watch Dark Rising.",1440028800,,678,4.6115702479338845
