Sure, there are some dog matches on the PPVs, but who is going to like every match.  I would say, buy this DVD for the XCup match at Victory Road.  Great match and one that even my wife put down her reading and watched.",1228694400,2,388,3.8
8298773,4,B001ELXT0W,"Cross the Line is a 3 pack consisting of TNA's recent ppv releases; Victory Road '08, Hard Justice '08, & No Surrender '08. None of these titles are available individually. This is a pretty good set to get. With some of these matches going in had stupid and idiotic storylines, most of them paid out. All 3 events for the most part has very good match cards.

Victory Road 2008
1. 12 Man Elimination Match
Team TNA vs. Team Japan vs. Team Mexico vs. Team International
Fantastic opener! You couldn't ask for anything more from this match up. There was great action flying everywhere. I swear the Motor City Machineguns are a pair of jumping beans. They provided phenomenal action along with the other competitors. Awesome match. 5/5

2. Gail Kim vs. Angelina Love
Pretty average knockouts match. Velvet Sky interfered here and there. But nothing out of the ordinary. 2.5/5

3. Jay Lethal vs. Sonjay Dutt
This wasn't your typical fast paced x-division match. There were a couple of nice and exciting spots. A good match. 4/5

4. Fans Revenge Match for the TNA Tag Team Titles
LAX vs. Beer Money Inc.
In this match there were a couple of people outside with leather belts ready to hit Beer Money whenever they were thrown outside. I felt that part of the match took away a great deal. These two teams could have put on a better match. 3.5/5

5. TNA Knockouts Title
Awesome Kong vs. Taylor Wilde
Kong just dominated Wilde in this match. Wilde got a couple of shots in. But Kong just toyed with Taylor throughout the whole match. Better then what I expected it to be. 3/5

6. Ultimate X Match
Kaz vs. Sheik Abdul Bashir vs. Naruki Doi vs. Volador Jr.
Not as good as previous Ultimate X matches but it did have its own highlights of the match. Kaz was great. A couple of good spots but the big spot was when Kaz dropped a leg drop from the top of the ultimate x post. But I really expected more. 4/5

7. Full Metal Mayhem
Kurt Angle & Team 3D vs. AJ Styles, Rhino, & Christian Cage
This was a very good match. Angle & Styles were continuing their little feud in this match which gave it more hype. Rhino looked to be fire upped out there. Christian had a couple of good spots of his own as well. 4.5/5

8. TNA World Title
Samoa Joe vs. Booker T
TNA hyped this match up to be some kind of homecoming for Booker t. Showing promos of him all throughout the night. This match was more physical then anything. Joe and Booker brawled on the outside and then just let loose. It ended in a no contest. Sting came out and dropped Joe. Not the best main event. 4.25/5

Hard Justice 2008
1. X-Division Title
Petey Williams vs. Consequences Creed
This was a darn good match. Instead of going full blast, Petey and Creed kept this match at a steady pace. It had some good high flying spots. Some nice counters as well. The ending took away a little bit but it was a great match nevertheless. 4.5/5

2. Beautiful People & Awesome Kong vs. ODB, Gail Kim, & Taylor Wilde
A pretty decent match up. Everybody had a good showing. This match is worth checking out. The knockouts delivered here. 3.25/5

3. TNA Tag Team Titles
Beer Money Inc. vs. LAX
Far better match then from Victory Road. One of the best tag bouts from TNA of the year. LAX and Beer Money brawled on the outside for a good while. Homicide got isolated for the better part of the match. LAX performed some very good double teaming. But this was just a great tag team match. 4.5/5

4. Black Tie Brawl and Chain Match
Sonjay Dutt vs. Jay Lethal
To be honest, this could have been saved for Impact. The concept was stupid. TNA just destroyed this whole Macho Man/Miss Elizabeth storyline. Even the fans were chanting BORING, FIRE RUSSO, & THIS IS BULL S*** here. Decent match at best and the only weak part of the ppv. 3/5

5. New Jersey Street Fight
Christian Cage & Rhino vs. Team 3D
If you seen one street fight involving Team 3D in TNA, then you've seen them all. The match got taken to the crowd which they brawled out there. A couple of good hardcore spots once back in the ring. But if you've seen it once, you seen them all. 4/5

6. Last Man Standing
AJ Styles vs. Kurt Angle
Match of the night without a doubt. Styles and Angle upped their game for this match. This match had everything from brawling, mat wrestling, high flying, counters submission, finsher counters, stealing of the finishers, just everything. Some of the counts were very close. Also, Angle takes one of the most damnest ddts ever! But tremendous match all the way. 5/5

7. Six Sides of Steel Weapons Match for the TNA World Title
Booker T vs. Samoa Joe
A pretty good contest here. Booker and Joe use what they had around them pretty good. Most of the weapons were used appropriately. A good title match with a surprise at the end. 4.5/5

No Surrender 2008
1. Super Eric, Curryman, & Shark Boy vs. Rock & Rave Infection
Mostly comedic value and nothing else. Basically thats all for this match. Just a side note... I'm so ready for Christopher Daniels to come back. He really needs the drop the Curryman act quickly. 3/5

2. Falls Count Anywhere
Awesome Kong vs. ODB
Best women's match throughout the set. ODB and Kong got very physical. Even bringing out a table. Very good knockouts match. 3.5/5

3. Matt Morgan & Abyss vs. Team 3D
A couple of good spots here. Abyss and Morgan worked pretty well as a team against 3D. A good tag match. 3.75/5

4. X-Division Title
Petey Williams vs. Shiek Abdul Bashir vs. Consequences Creed
This was a decent triple threat for the title. Bashir isn't a great x-division wrestler. Petey and Creed kept this match interesting for the most part. A couple of good moves. A nice match for the title though. 4/5

5. TNA Knockouts Title
Taylor Wilde vs. Angelina Love
The knockouts didn't bring their game to this match. Nothing worth noting here. 2.5/5

6. Ladder Match
Jay Lethal vs. Sonjay Dutt
This was the best match between these two. Dutt and Lethal found some new ways to use the ladder. Dutt even applies a camel clutch on Lethal on top of the ladders. The match defiantely made up for their squash match at Hard Justice. 4.5/5

7. TNA Tag Team Title
Beer Money Inc. vs. LAX
This felt more of a revenge match for LAX then for them trying to actually win their titles back. Beer Money is actually getting better as a team but neither of the teams weren't quite on key in this right here. I defiantely expected a little bit more. 4/5

8. MMA Rules Match
AJ Styles vs. Frank Trigg
What the fans chanted mostly speaks for this match itself. They didn't like this match at all. It got a little bit physical but it defiantely had a bs ending. 2/5

9. TNA World Title
Christian Cage vs. Samoa Joe vs. Kurt Angle
It was suppose to be a fatal four way but Booker was unable to make the ppv. These 3 put on a very good show and I also feel that this match worked better as a triple threat. All 3 has a great showing. Great spots in this one as well like when Angle pulled off a double ankle lock. A very good main event. Match of the night. 4.75/5

Overall I give Victory Road 3 stars, Hard Justice 4 stars, and No Surrender 3 stars. This is a good set for the price. I recommend getting this. A good way to catch up to what happened with TNA over the summer.",1227398400,3,7207,4.368460388639761

World X Cup Elimination Match: Team TNA (Curry Man, Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin) vs. Team International (Alex Koslov, Doug Williams, Tyson Dux) vs. Team Japan (Milano Collection A.T., Masato Yoshino, Puma), vs. Team Mexico (Ultimo Guerrero, Rey Bucanero, Averno) - All I can say is holy crap, this is one hell of a opening match & X division matches that that I can remember seeing in quite a while.  They went over 20 mins. & was just resembled the what TNA means...total nonstop action & worthy of the ""this is awesome"" chants.  Look towards the end when Team Japan's Masato Yoshino goes for an off the top rope dropkick onto Alex Shelley, it almost looks like he was in slow motion in midair.

Gail Kim vs. Angelina Love - A nice average match...nothing really noteworthy here.

Jay Lethal vs. Sonjay Dutt - They went back & forth with Lethal eventually being more aggressive at times than he normally is to the point where even Val got worried & kept trying to talk some sense into Lethal which backfired in the end.  Solid match overall.

""Fans Revenge"" Lumberjack Match: Tag Team Champions L.A.X. vs. Beer Money Inc. (Robert Roode & James Storm) - For those who didn't see the last one at No Surrender '06...the Fans' Revenge Match is a lumberjack match where the lumberjacks are regular fans & they have leather straps to use whenever Roode or Storm leaves the ring.  With the fans being heavily biased towards L.A.X. (even wearing L.A.X. shirts to ringside), Jackie refused to come to ringside before the match started & that was put over throughout the entire match as Storm & Roode where just strapped nonstop every single time they left the ring yet Homicide was able to go out & drink Storm's beer right at the beginning with no problems.  Concidering the stipulation, the match was average.

TNA Womens Champion Taylor Wilde vs. Awesome Kong - In a nutshell, Kong dominated Taylor a majority of the match with Taylor getting a few quick shots & pin attempts here & there before reversing Kong's powerbomb into a foward roll.  I personally didn't care for this match & was a step down from Kong's previous series with Kim & O.D.B.  The only thing noteworthy was how the crowd was more for Kong than Wilde.

World X Cup Finals/Ultimate X Match: Kaz (Team TNA) vs. Daivari (Team International) vs. Naruki Doi (Team Japan) vs. Volador Jr. (Team Mexico) - Team TNA was in the lead for this match but Kaz (leader of Team TNA) had a hurt arm throughout the bout that effected him right from the start.  This reminded me of how King Of The Mountain was at Slammiversary in that it wasn't the best one they've done but it wasn't a bad match either.  Various spots to look out for was Davari shoving Doi off the top of the side structure, Kaz backflipping Doi who ended up doing a low blow headbutt onto Volador (who was hanging off the cables) on the way down, and the insane leg drop from Kaz off the top of the steel structure onto Davari who was crawling across the cables.

Full Metal Mayhem Match: AJ Styles, Christian Cage, Rhino vs. Kurt Angle & Team 3D - TNA had the fans vote throughout the PPV on weather this was going to be a Tables Match, Falls Count Anywhere, or the match that Rhino asked for & won the vote in Full Metal Mayhem...and for those wondering, Full Metal Mayhem is TNA's version of a TLC match except you win by pin/submission. This match made up for the Ultimate X match in terms of all the crazy spots & just chaos all over the ring such as Cage's dive off the Ultimate X structure onto Angle & 3D, Team 3D's double teams through tables like the 3D on Christian & a doomsday device on Rhino that injured Devon's ankle.  Overall, this was a very fun match.

TNA Champion Samoa Joe vs. Booker T - This PPV was a homecoming for Booker T as they had video footage of Booker visiting various places in Houston throughout the night such as his wrestling school & his house to heavily put Booker over as having the ""hometown advantage"" even down to the fans cheering Booker & had a ""If Joe Wins, We Riot"" sign (please try to be original when doing your signs people).  This was an above average match with Joe being busted open early & showing the effects of it throughout the match.  The bigger issue was the ""controversal"" ending where Sharmell slapped Joe on the outside and it caused Joe to snap & going nuts on everyone from referees to security while beating on a bleeding Booker T before Sting eventually showed up & did 'what he had to do"" before Sharmell counted Booker's fall on Joe & walking out with the TNA Title.

In the end, the only bad match for me at least as Widle/Kong but the rest of the card had matches ranging from average to solid with the heavy standouts being the opening match & Full Metal Mayhem.  In the end, the PPV was enjoyable.

HARD JUSTICE 2008
X Division Champion Petey Williams vs. Consequenses Creed - They didn't do anything heavily fast paced or ""spotty"" like the sterotypical X division match but this was a good solid encounter between the two with Petey always looking for the Canadian Destoryer but Creed was able to keep countering the move with Rhaka Khan & Sheik Abdul Bashir (WWE's Davari) getting involved at times.  One moment to look out for was when Creed attempted a somersault senton but ended up hitting his back on the apron on the way outside the ring.

Taylor Wilde, Gail Kim, ODB vs. The Beautiful People  Awesome Kong w/Traci Brooks as the special referee - This was a fun match featuring all the main Knockouts that would have been worthy of being on their DVD set if it happened earlier.  This was a tag match that had everyone get their moment to shine along with good storytelling involving Awesome Kong's dominance along with some comedic moments like O.D.B. ""freshing up"" with Velvet Sky's spray.  Fun tag match.

TNA Tag Team champions L.A.X. vs. Beer Money Inc. - Unlike how their gimmick match was last month, this was a more old school regular tag team match between both teams that went back & forth between both teams with some standout moments like Hernandez ""border tossng"" Homicide over the top rope onto Beer Money outside the ring & even the managers/valets getting into it on the outside at one time.  Great match that saw Beer Money win the Tag Team Titles.

Black Tie Brawl N' Chain Match: Jay Lethal vs. Sonjay Dutt - For those who don't understand the title of the match, this was a tuxedo/chain match that quite honestly was a stepdown from their Victory Road match because of the gimmick stipulations involved.  They tried but I just couldn't get into this one & was the only flop of the night to me.

Jersey Street Fight: Christian Cage & Rhino vs. Team 3D - When you mix the words ""street fight"" & ""Team 3D"", you'll get exactly what you expect in that it was a brawl that went all over the place.  From brawling in the crowd to the ringside area to inside the ring itself.  There were tons of fun moments to watch like the old school ECW ""Use My Sign"" spot, Christian Cage's frog splash off the top of a ladder, and Rhino giving a gore into a table that didn't give.  Fun brawl to watch but look out for what happened with Johnny Devine & Abyss making cameos after the match.

Last Man Standing: AJ Styles vs. Kurt Angle - Eventhough this was labeled a ""Last Man Standing"" match, this is in reality a traditional ""Texas Death Match"" with the difference between the two matches being that in this case, you have to score a pinfall/submission fall before the referee starts counting the other wrestler out.  Just like their Slammiversary match, these two put on one hell of a wrestling match as they worked a great mat based match along with getting more aggressive as the match went on with moments like Kurt suplexing A.J. into the steel guardrail, both men attempting each others finishing moves on each other, the move that ended the match that will make you cringe, and the aftermath that caused Sting to make an appearence.  Once again, Angle & A.J. gave us the match of the night.

Six Sides Of Steel Weapons Cage Match: TNA champion Samoa Joe vs. Booker T - Just like the Lethal/Dutt match, this was a heavy drop from their match last month at Victory Road because of the way the match was set up.  This was similar to the last cage match Joe had with Kurt Angle at LockDown where they were trying to go one way but when that wasn't working, they switched to something else in that it was both men using the weapons non-stop right from the start but then went back to having a wrestling match.  Besides the ending with the gutair that set the stage for the upcoming months in TNA, this was a nice match for what it was but nothing special.

In the end, the only real flop here was the Lethal/Dutt match because of the heavy gimmick overload involved & I thought the Joe/Booker rematch was disappointing due to it also being real gimmicky at the beginning & not given alot of time to do much with eventhough they made the best of it.  But besides that, it was just like Slammiversary in that the rest of the card was completely enjoyable.

NO SURRENDER 2008
No Surrender turned out to be one of those PPV's like how the recent Turning Point & LockDown events where it just seemed like nothing was clicking or standing out to make this seem like an event where is you skip it, you aren't missing anything.  This PPV had some of the weakest showings from their divisions in a long time (Taylor Wilde vs. Angelina Love & Beer Money vs. L.A.X.), trying to reuse concepts that just didn't work at all (the Mixed Martial Arts match between A.J. Styles vs. Frank Trigg that resulted in ""We Want Wrestling"" & ""Fire Russo"" chants that that TNA production team did a close up of the crowd when they were chanting it), and matches that ranged from around okay to just average (Prince Justice Brotherhood vs. Rock N' Rave Infection, O.B.D. vs. Awesome Kong, Matt Morgan/Abyss vs. Team 3D, Sonjay Dutt vs. Jay Lethal in a Ladder Match).  The only real standouts on this card were the X Division title match between Petey Williams vs. Consequenses Creed vs. Sheik Abdul Bashir & the main event featuring TNA Champion Samoa Joe vs. Kurt Angle vs. Christian Cage (Booker T couldn't make it due to the Hurricane in Texas) as they were the two best wrestling matches on the card that actually went past ""first gear"" & hooked the crowd.

So in the end, you get one 3 star PPV's that was worth watching Victory Road & one 4 star that's worth going out of your way to see (Hard Justice) while you get another one that that's a two star event because only 2 matches I would watch more than once (No Surrender) but the positives outweight the negatives so this is a set I would recommend.",1224720000,3,10699,4.494069107787519
