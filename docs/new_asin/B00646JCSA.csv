8492390,5,B00646JCSA,"I've seen this movie and it's actually a good one, once you get into the story. The male lead is hilarious and you can't help but love the guy. The female lead is a bit cold and selfish in this movie so you may end up hating her a bit but in the end it was well worth watching. Well made movie with some truly disgusting scenes but all for comedy, normal for a Korean romantic comedy I suppose. The only downside of this movie is the fact that the male lead has been giving the stereotypical role of a bumbling moronic oaf that can't really do much on his own.",1388620800,,560,4.054054054054054
