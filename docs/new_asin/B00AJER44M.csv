5440825,5,B00AJER44M,"I watched this DVD three times already.  Each time, I start at the beginning and find myself getting lost in the world of Ford.  His influence on the automobile industry was profound.",1363737600,,183,4.6875
5440826,5,B00AJER44M,"great movie. Tells a great deal more about the man and the industry he created. He was a very likeable american and did great things for the world,  Too bad there aren't more like him...",1363564800,,186,4.314285714285714
5440827,5,B00AJER44M,"This film covers the man without shying away from his anti-semitic views, which I found to be quite surprising.

Definitely a great character study of an amazing, tragic character.",1363046400,2,180,5.206896551724138
5440828,4,B00AJER44M,"This is another fine example of the kind of documentaries that PBS' ""American Experience"" produces.  They make the assumption that the viewer may be well versed in the basics of a subject's life or they could just as well know nothing. The basics are often covered entertainingly so as not to bore the former and the musical score often keeps the interest in the story, even if the facts get too technical.

This 110-minute documentary begins in the rubber forests of Brazil - and ends there. Not something you would expect for the story of one of America's great industrialists. But - as you will see if you watch it - it makes sense. And, it moves - just like Ford's Model T Ford - at a nice pace.  Ford was responsible to the ground-breaking $5.00 wage and the assembly line but he also did ""social engineering"" building ""towns"" for his workers to live in and providing social activities for them. He also was an anti-Semite and this is not denied in the script.
The director is clever in using lots of archival movie footage - which keeps things moving along, but younger viewers should remember that until the mid-1920s, except for some experimental sound films by Ford's friend Thomas Edison, all movies were silent. So all the sounds you hear until 1930 (which is the bulk of footage here) has been supplemented by sound effects. But nicely done.

One weakness I found in this production that I don't remember being in other AE productions is the identification of the ""talking heads"" who are interviewed. With the sole exception of Bob Casey, Curator of the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, MI - all the ""experts"" are identified by their name and the title ""Historian"". They could be college professors, authors or researchers but we are never told where they reside or their professional affiliation. All are quite interesting but I - for one - would like to know where their expertise lies.

The film is narrated by actor Oliver Platt, who does a fine job. The DVD has no additional bonus features.

I would recommend this to anyone interested in American history as well as those interested in business - not just the auto business.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5440829,5,B00AJER44M,"American Experience has done it again. Using archival footage, a wealth of primary sources, and interviews with historians of Ford (both the man and the company), this documentary gives fascinating insight into one of the most influential Americans of the 20th century. Henry Ford was a genius at making a huge volume of cars that were reliable and affordable, thus changing the face of America and the world. Ironically, Ford came to resent the modern world he helped create and sought to rebuild a microcosm of 19th century America. We also learn that Ford was an anti-Semite and an atrocious father. I plan to use clips from this in my history courses.",1359936000,4,655,4.857142857142857
5440830,3,B00AJER44M,"Henry Ford - American Experience, 2013 film

Henry Ford established a rubber plantation in Brazil and created a company town. He basically invented the automobile as a product for the many, not a toy for the rich. Ford went from a farmer's son to one of the richest men in the world by building a product people wanted. Raised on a farm, he became a machinist and engineer. [The craze for bicycles in the 1890s allowed people to travel where they wanted when they wanted without the limitation of railway lines.] Ford believed in improving his product. His background led him to view the wealthy as his enemy. Ford's racing car won a race and gained publicity. He incorporated the Ford Motor Company in 1903. He innovated yet kept the design simple for his customers. The Model T was low cost and durable, transportation for everyone. Manufacturing parts took less time than assembling a car; the assembly line sped up production (from twelve hours to just over one hour).

The film shows men working at various jobs. Many left these repetitive jobs. Ford offered $5 an hour for an eight hour day to reduce turnover and increase consumption by his workers. This created a sensation in the news. His pride grew. Ford had English language classes for immigrant workers. He had a Sociological group to look into worker's lives and control them. He built a large estate in Dearborn rather than Gross Pointe. He disdained wealthy society. In 1915 he began a new plant at River Rouge. There was a conflict with some investigators over non-payment of dividends. Ford planned a new car company whose real aim was to get investors to sell their shares; it worked, he gained control. A libel suit expose a lack of knowledge on subjects known to high-school students. Ford won this libel suit. Ford hated lawyers as well as investors.

[This film does not mention Ford's attempts to bring peace during the Great War in 1916, a controversial political action.] Ford loved camping in the wilderness, leading a simple life. He started a campaign against Wall Street and the Jews (as the source of all evil). Many condemned him for this. [Was this due to hardening of the arteries?] Automobiles increased steel, rubber, and gasoline production. The 1920s saw changes in America. [More people now lived in cities than the country.] General Motors now offered competition to the Model T. [""Change is the only constant.""] They began to produce the Model A in 1927. Fast, reliable, safe, affordable, and successful.

Ford created Greenfield Village as a museum to the recent past. The Crash of October 1929 damaged the market for cars. Ford came to depend on Harry Bennett and his goons to run his plants. Edsel's style irritated his father, who spied on him. The United Auto Workers union organized GM and Chrysler, later Ford. There was an incident in May 1937 that was publicized. In 1941 Ford got an order to build B-24s. The UAW signed a contract with Edsel. After Edsel's death Henry took over, but a stroke affected his behavior. He died at age 83 in 1947. Grandson Henry II took over and made changes. Ford issued common stock [but the preferred stock remained in the Ford family].

There are books that will provide a lot more information. Henry Ford's control of his workers probably wasn't much different than other businesses, then or now. The ""Computing, Tabulating, and Recording Company"" also banned alcohol for its employees. Banks in New York ban alcohol by state law (at least in past years). Ford's influence can be seen in the novel ""Brave New World"". Increased production benefits both manufacturers and consumers (as long as they have money).",1359504000,4,3645,4.84430176565008
5440841,4,B00AJER44M,I think this documentary showed a good balance of the greatness of Henry Ford and the social dark side he held onto. I admire directors that can try to just tell a story without a political narrative. It was a different time and you have to at least respect his hard work to produce something that transformed this country.,1510012800,2,323,4.491525423728813

Only gave a little history of his terrible fight and brutality against organized labor. And just the briefest mention of his antisemitism and support of Hitler. Demonstrated how mentally troubled he was and why he should have been removed from the company. Without his son there would be no Ford today, but Henry was too unstable to see that.

5440884,5,B00AJER44M,"This documentary shows both the best and the worst of the great man and the legacy has today. Flawed in character. Human in nature. Henry Ford was an icon of his day. A genius in some respects and ignorant in others. Ford was responsible for making the US a manufacturing giant and ignited the industrial revolution. If it wasn't for Henry Ford many factory workers would still be well under paid, slave labor. Although his tactics we're almost barbaric by today's standards he was a product of his environment at the time.

5440904,5,B00AJER44M,"This is a very interesting documentary. My family is a FORD family. My husband also works for a FORD dealer.
This documentary not only shows Henry's industrial life and ideas but also his personal life. How he grew up and where.
He is a master and without his ideas and knowledge and his heart to just take a chance, out world would not be what is is today.
Henry Ford along with other greats like Thomas Edison and Leonardo da Vinci and Benjamin Franklin and Alexander Graham Bell,
Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. Just to name a few. I can watch any documentary. You are never to old to learn! Can you imagine a world without cars or a telephone or music or airplanes and trains?......Exactly! Knowing how these inventors minds worked. What made them tick? The sacrafice they made and did. The way their ideas revolutionized this world. This is definitely and great documentary to watch. I give this 5 starts!

Brew your favorite coffee, grab a snack, slip into some comfy clothes and get comfy cozy and press play and enjoy!
You will not be disapointed!",1451520000,9,1050,4.585106382978723

The producer provided a balanced view of this fascinating, and ultimately profoundly disturbing individual.  His virulent anti-Semitism was appropriately highlighted, as well as the less well known, unrelenting perjorative attitude towards his only child, Edsel, who ultimately succumbed to stomach cancer at the  age of 49.  While he made his mark on the industrial progress of our country, and the world at large,  ultimately, he was a very flawed figure, whose megalomaniacal perrsonality made him anything but admirable.

Seems to me he has every right to make conditions over who qualifies for profit sharing and who doesn't. My suggestion for those who wanted to continue to drink heavily is - don't work for Ford Motor. Get another job, and good luck finding one that pays you as much as Ford would have. Instead, PBS seems to suggest the workers were entitled to profit sharing just for showing up to work.

Has anyone associated with this film ever driven a Model T? I seriously doubt it. But let's face it the producers of this film could care less about the car. Their just out to get Henry Ford plain and simple. The talking heads read about Ford and then think they know about him. If you want to know Henry Ford and his car go buy a T. Drive it and learn how it works hands-on. Then you'll know history and how it was to live back then because history will be right before your eyes and in your hands. There are still thousands of T's out there readily available. You'll find out that the basis of a T's transmission is still used in cars today. The T had cruise control and was the first ATV with a chassis that twisted so it could navigate uneven roads of grass and dirt. The real Henry Ford is in that car.

5441060,5,B00AJER44M,"I had only picked-up bits and pieces of information on Henry Ford over the years, and had always wanted to see a documentary on his life that summarized it all.  This American Experience documentary may not be perfect, but it is quite good and worth viewing.

The documentary captures Henry Ford as the automobile genius, a bit of his private life, and the ups and downs of his life over time. It was interesting to see how a rather simple man had a vision of making automobiles and was able to put that vision into practice. Ford often defied popular opinion and his financial backers with his ideas, and his gamble paid off.

One tidbit that captured my attention is that Ford, when trying to modernize auto assembly, was inspired by seeing how cattle were handled in a slaughterhouse. As the carcass moved along (on meat hooks), various parts were taken off. He envisioned doing the same thing with an auto - except as it moved along, parts would be added on. The idea worked and the auto assembly line was born.

The documentary spends a lot of time explaining the Model T Ford, which was wildly successful. Perhaps too successful? This model sold so well that Ford refused to modernize it. Ford's sales eventually began to slip as GM and Chrysler offered newer and flashier models during the Roaring 20s.

Edsel Ford, his only child, was showcased a lot too.  It's unfortunate that Edsel is best remembered for the failed car with his name because he was intelligent and wanted to modernize the company in the 1930s, while Henry became more stubborn and more autocratic. Eventually Edsel fell ill in his 40s, undoubtedly worsened by his father's constant criticisms and hard-headed behavior.

This film has lots of film clips and still photography of both the Ford family and the Ford factories.  It was interesting to get a glimpse back in time and see how the auto industry grew so rapidly and how it changed American society. In many ways Henry Ford did not like the new world he helped create though, and he lashed out at 'Jewish bankers' and resisted the unionization movement to the point of condoning violence to keep the company union free as long as possible.

If you are a fan of the auto industry or industry titans of the 20th century you will most likely enjoy this documentary. It's packed with information and flows along quickly. Henry Ford had plenty of faults - some quite enormous - but I think his inventiveness and drive contributed considerably to the American way of life.",1389571200,,2500,4.702517162471396

5441062,5,B00AJER44M,"Henry Ford was an amazing man, no doubt about that. He invented the first practical automobile and perfected the industrial assembly line, having started out as a first-rate and self-educated mechanic. This documentary hit the high points of Ford's life, his obsession with perfecting the automobile (by which he meant the Model-T), his foolish flirtation with anti-Semitism, his rather shoddy treatment of his only son, his experiments with social engineering and, in his extreme old age, his paranoia and concern with security.

5441084,2,B00AJER44M,"I had such high expectations for this DVD. After watching it in one sitting it was obvious that it concentrates only briefly on just a few of Henry Ford's accomplishments, and instead focuses on his idiosyncrasies (or eccentricities, if you prefer) and his failings. This DVD held so much promise and ended up producing so much disappointment.

As a GM/Chevy guy, I'm no devotee of all things Ford - not that there's anything wrong with that - it's just who I am. But as a writer of manufacturing-history articles and as a mechanical engineer, I'd've expected that some time would've been spent in this DVD on at least a few of Henry Ford's major accomplishments. Unfortunately, this DVD focuses on all the negatives aspects of Henry Ford's life which the writers and producers could find and, thus, exploit. That is so sad.

The people who wrote and produced this DVD could've produced a true historical document about Henry. Instead, all they ended up doing was airing their gripes & complaints about what they dislike about the man. Again, that's so sad. They should've known better, as should the so-called historians who appear in this DVD. I'm guessing that some of the people interviewed are disappointed that only their negative comments were extracted and put into this DVD.

Please remember that July 2013 marks 150 years since the birth of Henry Ford. As this DVD was produced in 2012 I had guessed (wrongly, obviously) that it would concentrate more on the positives of Henry's life, rather than the negatives. Further, I'm shocked that this DVD is for sale on the Henry Ford Museum website's Gift Shop. Are the museum directors so greedy that they'll even sell a negative DVD about Henry? That, too, is so sad.

I'd like to document some of the major accomplishments for which Henry Ford is responsible. Again, I make no claims to be any sort of Ford expert, but even this Chevy guy knows a little about Henry's great deeds. Maybe the next DVD (""Henry Ford - The Real Story"" perhaps?) can actually be positive, and maybe focus on some of these feats.

Here's my list of some of Henry Ford's significant accomplishments (again mentioning that I'm no expert).

- Fordson Model F Tractor - this landmark farm machine outsold all other tractors... combined! When the Ford Motor Company (FMC) wouldn't produce it Henry formed his own company (Ford & Son Company - thus the name Fordson). The first Fordson featured a unitized design (that is, no separate frame) to save weight & lower cost. It was another example of Henry Ford producing what the market wanted - call it a Model T for the farm. Henry's goal was to give farmers what they needed to replace animal power, and he succeeded.

- Defeat of the Infamous Seldon Patent - Henry risked much to take on Big Business. The Seldon Patent ended up costing car makers a lot of money, and prevented affordable automobiles from reaching the marketplace. Henry won the court fight against those who took unfair advantage of the U.S. patent system, and he was named an ""everyman's hero"" for it. Further, the patent process was changed for the better because of this court fight.

- Ford-Ferguson Model 9N tractor - lightning struck twice with Henry knowing (once again) what farmers wanted when he formed an agreement with Henry Ferguson to incorporate the now-standard Three-Point Hitch into the 9N tractor. The 9N was affordable, easy-to-operate, and easy-to-repair, as were the Models 2N and 8N tractors that followed. Like the first Fordson tractor, it was truly a landmark design.

- Empathy For Farmers - having grown up on a farm Henry always wanted to improve the lot of farmers, who often relied on hard work and animal power for little or no profit. Henry even performed agricultural research to try to improve farming.

- Ford Tri-Motor Airplane - FMC entered the aviation business with a lightweight, three-engine design. The Ford Tri-Motor is almost instantly recognizable with one engine on each wing & a third on the nose, and the use of lightweight corrugated sheet metal. It was an airplane ahead of its time, and many years later three-engine jets would be very popular, such as the Boeing 727, the Lockheed L-1011, and the McDonnell-Douglas DC-10, each a landmark design in its time.

- Ford Flathead V-8 - if ever there was a right engine for its time it was the FMC Flathead V-8. While the factory horsepower figures seem low this engine was about torque (due to its long-stroke design), affordability, and ease-of-repair. It was also the affordable performance engine of choice for two decades, especially after World War II. This engine has been named to Ward's Top Ten Best Engines of the Twentieth Century, thanks to it's innovations such as: high-strength forged crankshaft; aluminum-alloy pistons; one-piece engine block; and elastomeric engine mounts. Nothing sounds like a Ford Flathead V-8, or ever will!

So, there you have my rather short list of Henry Ford's accomplishments which are sadly overlooked by this DVD. Let's all hope the sequel doesn't make the same mistakes as the original DVD. As always, thank you for reading my review!",1369785600,30,5124,4.8837744533947065

Staying with the motif of how Ford and his Model T changed the way people in America lived is the strong point to the central narrative. So is showing how Ford's Anti-Semitism was eventually forgiven when the auto titan met his end. Shakespeare was right: ""The evil men do lives after them; the good is oft interred with their bones."" The stormy relationship with son Edsel is also dealt with effectively. I cannot wait until the promised treatment of John D. Rockefeller's life and world impact.",1369612800,,611,4.819047619047619

8552647,3,B00AJER44M,"An interesting yet not exactly unbiased or balanced view of Henry Ford,  While it covers Henry`s ups it does not accurately cover Henry`s major failures: it depreciates the importance of the unionization riots, one of the major labor occurrence in America and Bennett`s largest failure, causing Ford Motor to change direction in regards to the union due to massive negative publicity,  It also inaccurately implies that Henry Ford II came into the CEO office by Henry Ford [I] death; in actuality, HFII came into power prior to HFI`s death by insistence of the government, which as noted was worried about HFI`s leadership, and finally cemented into actual power by a `coup` initiated by Clara Ford.  It also failed to note Hitler`s admiration of Ford, due to his anti-Semitic remarks, and the boycotts which helped the decision to shut the Dearborn Independent down.

So, overall, interesting yet not 100% precise in its coverage of this...complex (term used lightly) individual.  This film comes more as a character analysis of Ford, examining the motives of his actions, as often as remembering those acts. Yes, Ford changed America but his later years were full of actions which conflicted with the promise shown from his earlier years.  As noted in a historian`s comment in the film, in no way would we stand for what he did in today`s world - and we`re better for it.",1526169600,2,1373,4.947826086956522

8552650,4,B00AJER44M,"This is excellent. It is true to his life, accurate history of both his light and darkness. It is a balanced look at Ford's genius and technical innovation, and his understanding of economic forces and human nature, but also his manipulation of the press and public, dictatorial control over his son Edsel (I would like to see a documentary on him!) and his employees (higher wages came with a hidden cost), vile Anti-Semitic mendacity (horrible to watch!), hatred of unions (until his wife set him straight), and in his later years-despair, regret, and even paranoia. He built Greenfield Village to allow him to go back nostalgically to a ""better"" time, which is deeply ironic given that his own ideas and company brought about the modern-day changes that he came to feel threatened by, and that increasingly took on a life of their own. This is a very solid documentary and well worth the price of admission.",1518048000,4,910,4.839743589743589
8552651,1,B00AJER44M,Terrible documentary that is clearly biased against Ford. My son was doing a report on Henry Ford and this video really disappointed him. This documentary is TERRIBLE for any scholastic project.,1517961600,,194,5.290322580645161
8552652,5,B00AJER44M,"This was well done, for they didn't try to sugarcoat who Henry Ford really was, and at the same time the writers remained objective and impartial.  I appreciate the fact that PBS didn't show either one side of Henry Ford or the other, but the whole.  It is very balanced.

I have seen endearing commercials put out by Ford Motors in the past, showing him as benevolent.  But at the heart of it, he was angry and did not like change.  I was heartbroken to learn of his hatred for the Jews and for his own son.  In the beginning his intentions were good, but he lost his way as time went on.  I think he was just unfulfilled no matter what he accomplished, and that is sad for one who changed the face of America like he did.  I have been watching the American Experience documentaries for a few weeks now, and I find them to be done so well.  Westinghouse, The Abolitionists, Henry Ford, John D. Rockefellar (which I had to find on Youtube), and their regular seasons....  I find myself looking to the past to help me understand how to be better in the present through examples of people like Westinghouse, but also through these stories, I find myself learning what not to do.  I hope they do a documentary about George Washington Carver.  He was remarkable.",1517529600,3,1258,4.421739130434783
