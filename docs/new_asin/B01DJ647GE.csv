8756008,4,B01DJ647GE,"We love this show.  This season had some fantastic discoveries, but there was one real dud episode and a few mediocre episodes, so 4 stars for this particular season.

I have to remind everyone these are Region 4 (Australia) DVDs, so you must have a Region 0 system to play the set on US TVs.  The (Aussie) vendor we bought from obviously had problems with people not reading the description because they sent an email for us to verify we understood these are Region 4.

If you like Time Team, you definitely want this for your collection.",1526688000,,539,4.525773195876289
