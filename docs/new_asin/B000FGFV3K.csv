8122283,4,B000FGFV3K,"Ueki's battles with the Robert's 10, a group of power users who support Robert Haydn's plans to remake the Earth after destroying it, are just beginning. First up is Kurokage, who can raise clay golems of any shape or form from shadows, including a Godzilla sized Clay Man. The key is to bypass all these doppelgangers to get to Kurokage himself, who can't really fight on his own. The same goes for his counterpart, Rosso, the White Shadow, who can make robots appear out of shadows, and is probably the more powerful of the two. Ueki begins to wonder if the only way he can defeat Robert's 10 is to join them! Meanwhile, Mr. K, who is still alive but imprisoned in the Underworld learns the secret of Ueki's true lineage.

This volume of Law of Ueki was filled with some great battles conducted with bizarre powers. In fact it is these powers, which border on the absurd, that really give this series an interesting aspect, and also a comedic one. Unlike Pokemon or Dragonball, you feel as if these long battles really matter and Ueki comes off like Sylvester Stallone in Rocky, fighting to get back up even when he's getting the snot beat out of him. Ueki isn't fighting to show off his own skill or for enjoyment. He's fighting to save the world. This is a good show.",1161475200,,1271,4.5021645021645025
