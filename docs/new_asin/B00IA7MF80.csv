8640301,4,B00IA7MF80,"Axeman turned out to be better than I thought!  It's a little strange that the scene in the beginning isn't related to the rest of the movie though, other than viewers getting a sneak peek at the axeman himself- a man who towers around 7 feet and is absolutely humongous.  He doesn't even need that ax!  Just his size alone is enough to handle most people, hehe.  This scene shows three apparent criminals who stole money, and okay you got me- the characters we meet soon after find this money so perhaps this scene is more relevant than I thought, but these three characters are quickly murdered as soon as they turn on each other.  The female cop gets a call about a teenage boy who got his thingy stuck in something.  She's lucky she got that call when she did- had she taken another step those three criminals were ready to shoot her down.

The movie itself is pretty good.  What makes it so great are the characters.  I have a feeling most viewers wouldn't care for Axeman much because the story is mostly devoted to building relationships with several college-aged teens who travel to a log cabin to spend the week or weekend.  For a while (like about an hour) we almost forget an axeman is on the loose!

What makes the characters so great?  Well let's see.  Two females get into a big fight early on over some kind of running event and accuse each other of being too overweight to participate in it.  We have two girls who fancy each other, and they have their own make out time in the bedroom.  Actually they have quite a few make out sessions!  They also get into a little disagreement when the one isn't sure it feels right for them to make out.  Thousands of male viewers are probably thinking ""Yes, it's right!  Keep going!"" but from a storyline point of view these two ladies are decent characters.

Then we have the red-haired lady who looks like one of the Olsen twins and thinks she's the queen.  No man can stand in her league!  The black guy of the group follows her around.  She hilariously turns around in one jogging scene and says something like ""Keep your thingy out of my Suzy Q"", lol.  She constantly calls him the P word and says he's not man enough to make a move on her, and after a while I feel sorry for the guy.  He thinks the world of this woman but she keeps criticizing the guy and makes him chase her around like a little puppy.  It's pretty sad.  They get drunk together and throw up in each other's mouths later on, but despite that they still kiss anyway.  Really gross and I gagged.

We have perhaps the longest relationship problem among these young men and women when the one woman wakes up and hears her ex-boyfriend making out with her best friend on the kitchen sink.  The two women get into a fight but eventually make up.  This scene is quite long though, as is the tension between the two girls, so be prepared for that.  Elsewhere we have the dorky overweight guy who everyone picks on.  He makes tons of sexual jokes and even has a history of being perverted which makes the other girls giggle.  He's a little obnoxious at times though.  We have a couple jocks but they aren't the main characters in this movie.

The killer himself... must have an affection for teenage drama, because he sits back and waits a long time before entering the house and slicing people up with that handy ax of his.  Early on he eliminates the dorky guy by slicing his head.  Funny how despite being dead the dorky guy continues to walk forward as the killer follows behind.  When one of the jock guys finds a suitcase of money in the woods, he instantly turns greedy and wants to hide it from the other girls who are always close behind in their search for him.  The killer slices him in the neck or head, can't remember.  He too walks forward for a few seconds before eventually getting sliced in half completely!  Ouch!  I guess that's the only way to get these dead people to stop walking!  Geez!

For over an hour we have this killer hiding in the shadows.  Eventually he has his fill with teenage silliness and enters the house.  This is when the suspense portion of the story finally gets going.  The killer stabs one girl in the stomach while holding her mouth so she can't scream.  The killer literally rips the head off the one guy who temporarily leaves his girlfriend alone in the bedroom to find out what's going on with the other friends in the house (he gets the flesh on his head *and* his skull ripped off immediately after!)  The killer takes care of that female cop we see in the beginning in less than a second by twisting her neck after she walks up to the front door questioning who the killer is and asking for ID.  He stomps the black guy to death on the living room couch and sticks a knife in the back of the redheaded girl's head.  She should have been killed harder given her ""I'm better than you"" attitude.  The killer has his hands full with that woman in the bedroom though!  He tries his hardest to strangle her numerous times but she keeps overpowering him and getting away... until the end.  I think she should've lived!  Well then again, she's the same girl who made out with her friend's boyfriend on the kitchen sink so maybe not.

Speaking of the ending it's pretty lame with a second cop showing up and seeing the killer in the house.  The movie then ends.  What!  Despite the ending this is still a great movie with strong characters but perhaps the relationship struggles between these college boys and girls lingers about 30 minutes too long.  I enjoy the story either way.  The killings are decent and the killer himself is really scary too.  I recommend this.",1500508800,,5632,4.41399416909621
8640302,3,B00IA7MF80,"The film opens with a man with a scar over his left eye (Ray Trickitt), another one with a scar over his right eye (Carlos Javier Castillo) and Tiffany Shepis sitting in between them. This is all immaterial as they die in the first scene by the Axeman (Scot Pollard) aka Bill, a mountain of a man of which we know absolutely nothing about...and never will. There is a bag full of money estimated to be about $4 million dollars, although my personal estimate is less as that amount would weigh 88 pounds and be a struggle to tote around...just saying.

A college reunion is booked at the same cabin in the woods as the first killings. The college crowd has played musical chairs with their partners and now are on their second round, with first round losers still holding grudges, everyone seems to love and hate everyone as the film goes into insult mode for the grossly immature. Why they had to walk to the cabin when there is a road that goes up to the driveway is not really explained. The group consists of a lot of hard bodies and a fat guy (Nihilist Gelo) with a camera. Plot spoiler...the black guys doesn't die first (Joston Theney). They are all unlikable and none really qualify as ""the final girl."" My money was on Tammy (Jamie Bernadette). The $4 million or whatever the amount is still laying around outside in the same non-weathered bag, as Bill appears to have no use for the money, other than to let people find it, thinking they got it made and then get a knife jabbed in them (the actually killing weapon of choice and not an axe.) At 28 minutes into the film we get a verbal description of the opening scene that was really awful narration...thank you Stephen Eith for droning your lines.

This may have some appeal to the younger crowd who enjoy sexually oriented insults that could use more creativity.

8640303,4,B00IA7MF80,"The premise is a classic set up that made 80s horror completely watchable as visceral horror. There is a slight late 90s too cool for this micro-vibe that kicks off the story and echos through some of the characters which is a nice, refreshing component. The cast are all pretty straight acting, recognizable indie horror actors who give convincible performances, some a bit more than others, but all give decent, recognizable performances that bring the characters to life. The film does carry a lot of dialog that adds way more dramatic interactions that I, personally, like to see in my visceral slaughterfests.

Axeman uses some cool, somewhat expected, special effects-sometimes working wonderfully, a few times it fails, but often the kills, and gore are totally dope. I have to give a tisk tisk to CGI blood effects in a few scenes and mention a red flag to one kill set up, (I cant be specific without spoiling it for others but most will notice it in the film), CGI splatter is a nail in my spine that is more common and very cost effective but lacks the excitement and personality that practical fluid provides. That being said the majority of the kills, blood and gore are very much practical and taken serious.

Overall Axeman is a fine modern horror, offering both classic feel and current elements, to a set-up that works. The film gives us a new, slasher of gigantic stature, emphatic stoicism, and brutality. The kills are a mix of classic, and creative, slice-n-dice moments  demanded in slasher horror. I felt very emotional over one specific death/ character recognition scene in the film, (without spoiling it: one scene had some amazing emotional connectivity that overflowed beyond the screen as a character died and another watched in horror), very compelling and intense. Really Axeman minus the few flaws gives us a cool, modern horror film.",1431129600,,1866,4.917460317460318

8640305,1,B00IA7MF80,"Some guy with an axe chases teens arounds and manages to kill some of them.  Shot on a $1.98 budget.  Yawn. Been there, done that.  This is the kind of crap you get out of RedBox rental machines.",1414627200,2,195,4.078947368421052
8640306,1,B00IA7MF80,"This movie is awful. Trying too hard to be campy, claiming the slasher genre but really failing in almost all aspects. The cinematographer is awful, the gore looks terribly fake, and all the ""bros"" acting is cringeworthy. Some of the women in it are good, especially the lesbian couple, and I'm not just saying that because they're hot lesbians. I wonder if anyone actually bothered directing this film or if they just kinda winged it.

Scot Pollard as the Axeman is hilarious, but not really in the right way.",1406073600,2,510,4.730337078651686
