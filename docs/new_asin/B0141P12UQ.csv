8729337,4,B0141P12UQ,"I am 59 1/2 years old and was looking for something that would not take a lot of memorization, yet cover the basic skills that I would need to help defend myself. This fit the bill nicely as most all of the moves have the same basic patterns so that I only need to remember and practice these few moves and patterns. Will I add a few more to my repertoire,? Of course, but this is a good place to start and for some it may be all they need.",1512604800,,440,3.9

8729339,1,B0141P12UQ,"The defenses offered in this video are unrealistic and could get someone hurt worse than not using them.  In one gun defense, the gun flies from the assailant's hand although there was no contact to make it do so.  After the initial disarming with the gun lying on the ground, the victim is told to flee.  What about the gun lying next to the assailant?  Can it be assumed he will not pick it up and shoot the victim?  Also, the instructor uses palm smashes a lot in the video.  Unless you are a trained martial artist and have practiced the technique n with power, it will have little effect.",1482278400,,593,4.345454545454546

8729341,5,B0141P12UQ,A well put together self defence DVD which shows a variety of different scenarios where self defence can make a difference. The demonstrations and the slow motion help a lot so you can see exactly how to use the techniques and learn. Nothing is rushed here.,1464912000,,257,4.608695652173913
8729342,5,B0141P12UQ,"Great Training aid I love Rhys's ""Gentleman Warrior Self Defines System"" the techniques are easy to masters with close ups, narration, slow motion, various angles and step by step guides, his style is also very effective. Rhys also mentions in an interview that his style is based on various martial arts he studied in his life especially Kempo Karate that he was taught for over 10 years by a British police office (and British police do not use guns so rely a lot on there fighting skills) who is also his current grandmaster. Rhys also teaches various fighting stances against various street attacks including knives, Guns even from different angles e.g. front and back (if you were at a cash point and someone put a gun or knife in your back) bottles, clubs, grabs, chokes, punches and kicks, I can't wait to get his next training DVD'S ""Gentleman Warrior Defense System Volume 2, Tonfa, Tonfa Single and Double for Realistic Street Self Defense"" and ""Gentleman Warrior Self Defense System Volume 3, Kubotan and Torch for Realistic Street Self Defense"". God Bless and stay safe (With this DVD you will).",1439856000,,1107,4.862433862433862
