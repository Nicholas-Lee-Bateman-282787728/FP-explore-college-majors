8358232,1,B0029U106M,"Even though Amazon and even the DVD artwork claim that this is Upon This Rock starring Orson Welles and Dick Bogarde, this is actually the 1949 film called The Pilgrimage Play.

Someone needs to let the producers of this movie know that they are advertising the wrong product.  The artwork perfectly describes the movie that I was hoping it would be and even says the movie is 52 minutes long when it is actually 91 minutes.

The Pilgrimage Play, which is the movie you will receive if you buy this DVD, is actually a decent movie being yet another rendition of the life of Jesus.

Unfortunately this still leaves Upon This Rock starring Orson Welles and Dick Bogarde Out of Print.",1243468800,5,681,4.603305785123967
