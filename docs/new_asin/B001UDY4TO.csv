8343391,5,B001UDY4TO,"I own George Nolly's videos and they are excellent materials for any serious fitness athlete who wants to do it the ""old fashioned way,"" with hard work and proven methods.  George is the ""star"" of his videos, and does the material and the workouts himself instead of having some ""infomercial"" personality do it for him. Make no mistake--the DVDs are not entertainment--they're TRAINING, and George does them in a methodical, unemotional and very valuable way. If you're looking for someone to give you a ""YOU CAN DO THIS"" kind of lecture that will get your heart rate pumping up, these aren't for you--but if you're looking for solid material and excellent instruction of principles that are timeless--you need these in your fitness library.
I am a 2006 Body for Life champion, and I support these DVDs in their entirety.",1238198400,,821,4.906474820143885
