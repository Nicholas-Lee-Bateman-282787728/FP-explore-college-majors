2675025,4,B000JK8O7W,"Purchased for an elderly gentleman, he enjoys following along and doing the exercises.  His balance is off, so being able to sit and exercise is just right.",1211932800,17,156,4.777777777777778
2675026,4,B000JK8O7W,It's a great DVD for the elderly. Very easy to do and she does them slow enough for everyone to keep up with. I would recommand this to anyone.,1201392000,14,143,3.9655172413793105
2675027,2,B000JK8O7W,"I previously wrote a review for this product, and now it's not listed.  I purchased this DVD for my grandparents based on the rave reviews from this site, but now I'm beginning to think that only the rave reviews are posted & the not so great reviews (e.g., my previous review) are deleted.

I was very much disappointed with this DVD.  The production quality was very poor (complete with spelling errors) and there were very few exercises.  The exercises were good, however the reps were much too fast for older individuals.  There are better senior exercise DVD's out there, and I would not recommend this one.",1200096000,5,612,4.735849056603773
2675028,5,B000JK8O7W,"My ever-critical 85 year old mother, who can only shuffle around instead of walking due to feet problems, is delighted with this particular tape.  She can sit and do the exercises and it has been a god-send for her.  I strongly recommend it to anyone with limited mobility.  My mother doesn't get delighted over anything!  I am getting another copy for when she visits my sister.",1197849600,35,379,4.696969696969697
2675029,5,B000JK8O7W,"I feel that it has a well rounded set of stretches and exercises with a nice relaxing cooldown. All are performed from a seated position, which is what I was looking for.

Like another reviewer,I purchased this video for a parent. I did the video first to make sure it would be safe for her. Based on the cover,I was afraid that Sunshine might be a hyperperky, high-pitched cheerleader. She is not. Although she does perform every exercise without losing the smile that you see on the cover, she passively narrates the video and I find her voice quite soothing. There are visual cues to remind you to Breathe and a little sun displays when you are on the last exercise of a set (OK, admittedly a little hokey but I think it's useful for elderly or hearing impaired).

She does not offer modifications of any of the exercises (so the exerciser needs to be able to do this themselves), but she chooses simple, relatively easy exercises, so I think it was a good decision. For the purpose of this video I think offering modifications might make it choppy and potentially confusing for the target audience (older and/or rehab patients).

Slight criticism is that when she does the torso twists, I wish she would pause in the center (right, center, left, center) instead of going directly right and left but that is a modification I will discuss with my Mom.",1192838400,106,1353,4.629166666666666
2675030,4,B000JK8O7W,Found this to be a comprehensive relatively easy workout.  Definitely one of the better ones on the market for seniors and rehabbers.,1188259200,27,133,5.045454545454546

I love it so much that I bought a copy for myself and I am only 45 yrs old and have been working with trainer for 6 months now.

2675055,4,B000JK8O7W,I bought this for my 86 year old mother and she can do all the exercises.  I only gave 4 stars because there is a lot of relaxation/meditation time after the exercises and mom didn't care for all that.,1410652800,,201,4.153846153846154

2675057,5,B000JK8O7W,"I just love the Easy Chair Exercise, it is pilates and Calisthenics.  It is about 4 minuets warm up,  14 mins. actual workout, with about  7 mins. cooldown, and 5 mins. of relaxation, with credits the entire DVD is a little over 30 mins.  It can be done sitting or standing.  I prefer sitting.  It is a fun exercise.  Very easy to do, yet it is a very good workout.  Every Part of the body gets a good workout.  I have been working out for over 30 yrs, doing walk aerobics, yoga, fit and strong, trim tone and flex, but as I am getting older, I want an easy exercise, and this it.

2675061,2,B000JK8O7W,This arrived in good shape.  I dislike the video itself.  The demonstrator never changes facial expression and does not exhibit any breathing in-breathing out activity.  She does not appear to put any energy.  Certainly now inspiring to watch.,1405036800,,243,5.315789473684211

2675065,2,B000JK8O7W,"At first I did not mind Sunshine's smile throughout this CD. But as I came to use it more and more, I wanted to just forget my work out.  Her facial expression never changed.  I wondered if she was a robot.  And I think I would have had a better work out if the person doing the exercises would have been the one giving the instructions. Is there some reason this lady can not speak that she has to use a narrator?  These excercises became painfully difficult to do, due to the irritating facial expression of Sunshine, that never changed, not even hardly a bat of her eyes. I'll put these three CD's out on a garage sale and hope that who ever buys them will forgive me, for not trashing them instead.",1400544000,,702,4.2556390977443606
2675066,5,B000JK8O7W,"This DVD is very good for individuals, not just seniors, who want or need some form of stretching and breathing beyond everyday methods. It helps you get out the kinks and breathe correctly as you do stretching.  It really gives you a workout in the beginning, but does become easier as you do it more often, even 3 or 4 times a week.",1399939200,3,334,4.301587301587301

They are very easy to do and are done at a slow pace she can do them without exertion every exercise is very well explained and shown. She loves the Instructor who is Positive and Motivational. There is a nice 5 minute stretching warm up, 25 minutes of exercises for the entire body, a 5 minutes cool down and 5 minutes of Relaxation nature and affirmations. The Music is nice and She is Very Happy with this DVD.

I Recommend this DVD for anyone that wants a plain simple No Nonsense easy weightless exercise routine.",1389744000,4,628,4.460869565217391
2675078,1,B000JK8O7W,this DVD was terrible. it is just how many ways can you move your arms and how many ways can you move your feet while sitting. I teach  exercise to elderly and found nothing of any use.,1387843200,,185,4.0

2675083,1,B000JK8O7W,"Buy it only if you (1)have a strong tolerance for wasting time with boring exercises that are not very beneficial even for the elderly; the instructor sounds condescending, too  (2) you have a strong stomach that can stand watching ""Sunshine,"" who looks as if she fell into a Botox vat and (3) you don't mind seeing a middle aged woman with an 80's peroxide ""do"" and dressed like 13-year-old cheerleader grinning at you like a Cheshire cat. I really do think her grin stays in the air when she's gone. Oh, and irritating music.

Since there is a remote possibility of a tiny bit of benefit for someone other than myself, I don't want to diss it completely. It would be unfair to do so because I couldn't stand to watch more than half of it. If you buy it and get some benefit from it, more power to you.",1378339200,2,803,4.346666666666667

I had to laugh as I was used to swimming 25 laps in the lap pool before work each morning and 2 hours of exercise in the pool at night and here I was not even able to get through a warm up exercise sitting in a chair. Saying this I am recommending this video for anyone who is in need of getting back in shape because it will challenge you and give you a great work out even if you cannot last more than 10 minutes. I am looking forward to working my way up to going through the whole workout eventually. I want to encourage you to exercise even if you cannot get through the whole thing. IT MADE A DIFFERENCE even after 10 minutes time. So if you need to gain strength or get into shape GET THIS WONDERFUL DVD! The only irritating thing is the model who smiles like the cheshire cat.,1344556800,5,1106,3.9419642857142856
2675108,1,B000JK8O7W,To say this was a pilates DVD is like saying Tai Chi is an aerobic workout.  There wasn't one single exercise for your core and building core strength.  It is a complete waste of money and I would not recommend it to anyone!,1335830400,,224,4.186046511627907
2675109,4,B000JK8O7W,I work with the elderly and bought this for them. I had to warn them to try to ignore the very odd fake smile of the lady and the fact that she is wearing a crop shirt which to the elderly this is not appropriate at all. But besides that the exercises are very good. They were all able to follow along and do the exercises. Which are very good for them.,1332892800,2,353,3.9166666666666665

The instructions are easy to follow and understand. Good CD.",1329609600,2,368,5.385964912280702

2675112,1,B000JK8O7W,I was looking for an additional chair exercise video and was very disappointed with this DVD.  It was do this then do that. No mention is made of alterations to use if an exercise caused pain or could not be done by the viewer. It's tagged for rehab & physical therapy but again no explanation of what should/should not be done if you've had joint surgery or replacement.  I would not recommend anyone bother purchasing this DVD.,1327190400,2,429,4.558441558441558

2675117,3,B000JK8O7W,I have been a fitness instructor for 30+ years and I now teach strictly seniors.  This video is great for older (65+) beginners.  It is easy to follow and the exercise is not strenuous.  The relaxation at the end is good for those who need to learn how to relax.  The only thing I did not like about the video is that it was poorly produced.  The instructor looks like an ex-porn star with very old sneakers.  She is a very bad example for skin health with her very dark tan.  I would think that the producer would have taken her appearance into consideration.  Just my opinion.........,1313452800,2,586,4.411214953271028

She doesn't mind doing the exercises, but the faky smile ""Sunshine,"" dressed way too young and scantily for her age, drives Mom nuts (me, too).  It also makes Mom mad that it doesn't look like Sunshine is really doing what she instructs, like when she talks about deep breathing, she doesn't do it.

2675132,4,B000JK8O7W,"This reviewer would like to review the exercises on the video, rather than the appearance of Sunshine. I threw this video in for a group of elderly men and women, of varying ages and abilities. For safety, I only like to use sitting exercises, as the group exercising could have falls or injuries trying to do standing exercises, or alternating from standing to sitting.  I always remind them they can do more or less repetitions based on their abilities.  Sunshine's movements were nice and slow for the elderly crowd, yet still doing the job of improving range of motion which definitely diminishes with age, and lack of use of the limbs.  The group exercising to this video also felt it provided enough challenge to their exercise program.
Sunshine does mention to breath quite often in the video, which I caught myself needing from time to time. I also noticed the elderly group responding to her reminders to breath.
I had no problems with the sound quality of the video, and did not see any participants having any problem with the sound or video quality.
This is a simple video, with Sunshine sitting in a chair by the beach.  The view doesnt change, nor does her smile.  In my opinion, this is a good video to have as part of a collection.  Another good exercise video I would recommend, is- Rise Up With Rosie: Joyfulness in Motion.  This video is more fun than Sunshine, but may be harder to find.
All in all, this video offers good range of motion and strength improvement, with easy to follow exercises.  She stays sitting the entire time, for those who want a true ""exercise while you sit"" video.",1271116800,36,1609,4.640845070422535

No other expression ever crosses her face.  She looks like her face is painted on!

The exercises are kind of ok.  I have bad knees so can't do floor exercises, and some of the leg exercises are pretty painful, but the upper body ones are way too easy!  I don't break a sweat at all, and I'd have to be way out of condition to find them difficult.  Even the leg exercises aren't hard.
