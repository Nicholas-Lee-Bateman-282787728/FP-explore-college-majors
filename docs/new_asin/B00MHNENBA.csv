6578542,5,B00MHNENBA,"This isn't really a review, but as I found the product description sorely lacking, I decided to compile this list of product information for the benefit of prospective buyers. I hope you find this information useful.

Now lets crunch some numbers. This box set costs $59.99, and contains 5 films. When we divide to find the price of each individual film, we get a price of $11.99 per film. This is a decent deal to own this kickass set of action films from the Muscles from Brussels: Jean Claude Van Damme. If you found this information helpful, please give this review a like.

6578543,4,B00MHNENBA,"Here's my take. I've watched all of these movies before and the best one's I like are Hard Target and Sudden Death. It's nice to see Sudden Death coming to Bluray as that is one of my favorites. Whether or not the overall price is good, it all depends on the quality. You know how the studios is. Most of the time with older movies they'll just repackage DVD content, and the Bluray edition doesn't look any better than the DVD. I hope that is not the case with this set, but we'll see. Nonetheless, if you're a fan of Van Damme and you don't have these movies, then this is one collection you'll definitely want to get. I'll give it 4 stars for now",1407542400,4,649,4.2

6578549,5,B00MHNENBA,"This collection gathers together 5 Jean-Claude Van Damme films on blu-ray as follows:
1) Hard Target
2) The Quest
3) Street Fighter
4) Sudden Death
5) Lionheart

While the films themselves differ in actual quality, this set does provide a nice cross section of what kind of film roles Van Damme was up to in the 90's. Each film comes on its own disc.

The main draw for me in terms of getting this set was to have Hard Target and Lionheart on blu-ray. Lionheart in particular had only been available in full frame DVD here in the states so having it in hi-def widescreen is a treat.

One intriguing aspect of this set is that the version included of 1993's Hard Target is not the heavily cut 96 minute R rated version but a little over 99 minute unrated European cut which contains a lot more violence. In fact the disc in my set is the region free NTSC format UK disc (not sure if that was an error or not). While it is well known that director John Woo's preferred cut of the movie is a heavily bootleged 116 minute cut (which mostly restores dialogue scenes), this 99 minute version does restore most of the MPAA mandated cuts to the violence though the ear cutting scene is still not complete. I have seen other reviewers around the internet stating that they got the US disc and despite the R rating listed on that disc, it was also the unrated 99 minute cut. The additional violence is most notable whenever anyone gets shot as well as the climatic battle in the third act.

Picture quality on all discs are a very noticeable upgrade over their DVD counterparts. Lionheart in particular looks quite striking in high definition widescreen and is also the full 105 minute theatrical cut of the film as some prior DVD releases were missing some footage. Sound for all films is presented in lossless audio. Extras are slim though the infamous Street Fighter does retain all of the extras from its special edition DVD release from a few years ago. While it is clear each film didn't get a full on restoration, the bit rates for each film are high and detail is quite impressive all around.

If you go by the definition of what makes a good film, then most if not all of the films in this collection are suspect at best (especially Street Fighter). But in terms of sheer entertainment value and for fans of Van Damme as well as 90's action cinema such as myself,  it is tremendous value for your dollar as you can now get this set for only around 15 dollars from a lot of sellers. Plus the fact that the version of Hard Target included is the unrated 99 minute cut, you can't go wrong if you are a fan.",1484006400,3,2602,4.399168399168399

6578551,1,B00MHNENBA,"I'm one starring not for the film, but for FALSE ADVERTISING.  This Blu Ray set does NOT contain 5 discs.  It contains ONLY 2 discs.  I only buy multi sets when I know ahead of time the number of discs ahead of time.  Multiple movies on one disc means high compression, and low video quality.  Why even bother with Blu Ray then?  You can find DVD multi-packs for cheaper in that case.  DISAPPOINTED and MISLEAD!!!",1483315200,,413,4.426666666666667
6578552,3,B00MHNENBA,"I think everyone knows what to expect from this collection. The collection largely leans toward the middle part of Van Dame's career (1991-1996) and so only two of his more popular movies are included in this set. Those being Lionheart (which does not have an individual release) and Hard Target. Sudden Death is probably just shy of JCVD's top tier movies, but it is solid for what it is. We then get the terrible Street Fighter movie and the passable and more stylized version of Bloodsport known as ""The Quest"".

All and all the set is worth the 11-20 bucks, but this could have been a much better collection had it included Kickboxer, Bloodsport or at least one of JCVD's other pre Hard Target action films instead of Street Fighter. I would gladly take Death Warrant, Double Impact, Universal Soldier or even Nowhere to Run over that film.",1481760000,,844,4.702702702702703

6578554,5,B00MHNENBA,"LIONHEART is one of the best action-adventure movies of all time. Great story. And every aspect of the production is top caliber. The direction, editing, musical score, and each actor in the drama deserved an oscar for delivering a strong believable performance.  At no time did any part of this movie require a viewer to suspend disbelief.  Briefly, its the fast-paced story of a French Foreign Legionnaires justified desertion. The plot focuses on his desperate journey to expiate his absence from home and to reunite his family devastated by the untimely death of his brother. This movie wields a big fistful of the most hyper personalities to ever appear on the big screen.  From the time of the opening credits, the action never lets up. And the movie culminates in a crescendo of a surprise ending. LIONHEART (aka AWOL) is a timeless classic that you can confidently add to your movie library :)",1475539200,,901,4.875816993464053

6578567,5,B00MHNENBA,"I won't bother giving any kind of drawn out synopsis of any of the 5 films, as I'm sure anyone here looking to purchase this set is already familiar with the movies themselves.

I'm primarily here to point out something that I realized no one else has mentioned in any other reviews... mainly, some important info on ""Hard Target""(my personal favorite JCVD flick of the bunch). The version of the John Woo actioner included in this set(at least the copy I received) is actually the International Cut previously only released through Universal Pictures in the UK. It is a 99 minute cut and is much more violent then the original 97 minute US theatrical release.

So, I just thought I'd let everyone out there know, just in case anyone has ever wanted to check-out that version. I personally like my John Woo action a bit more raw. So if you do too, then this is the cut for you. Plus, the FINALLY widescreen HD releases of ""Lionheart"" and ""Sudden Death"" don't hurt either. :)",1424736000,23,974,4.591954022988506
6578568,4,B00MHNENBA,"If you're a Van Damme fan in possession of a Blu-ray player, then the 5-Movie Action Pack is a good purchase to make. Featuring a good selection of all-theatrical releases and a complete absence of JCVD's more polarizing direct-to-video work, this would be a good selection for either the no-nonsense devotee looking to upgrade an existing collection or a newcomer wanting to experience the Muscles from Brussels for the first time. To just focus on the quality of the movies, this is a very good collection.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hard-Target/dp/B00CU9QHJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hard Target</a>&nbsp;is Jon Woo's first American feature, which means it's stylized to the point of being hokey and features a lot of action. I don't think Woo's American fare ever matched the quality of his Hong Kong productions, but this one makes a good effort. Van Damme is molded to Woo's style well enough but doesn't have to go far out of his way to deliver a smattering of martial arts, a killer motorcycle chase, and plenty of intricately-staged shootouts. The presence of Lance Henriksen (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Millennium/dp/B001CY5N00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Millennium</a>) as the lead villain also strengthens the picture, which is definitely one of the more unique highlights of Jean-Claude's career.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lionheart/dp/0783228465/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lionheart</a>&nbsp;is a feature from before our hero went entirely mainstream, when his movies were already in theaters but still low-budget enough to focus on gritty street violence instead of gunfights or explosions. To be honest, this one never resonated with me, but I know I'm in the minority. The story centers on underground fighting, and Van Damme's supplied with a good selection of varied opponents. The quality of the fights fluctuates, though, with the swimming brawl against Paco Prieto being pretty neat but the abortive duel with Billy Blanks is disappointing. Personally, I think this is the first feature wherein Jean-Claude's dramatic abilities begin to glimmer; he's not an especially good actor at this point, but he was clearly trying hard.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Quest/dp/B006WK4Y9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Quest</a>&nbsp;is basically ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodsport/dp/B00006RCOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodsport</a>&nbsp;in the 1920s,"" according to writer Frank Dux in the summary of his court case against Van Damme regarding this feature. As Jean-Claude's directorial debut, it's amazingly ambitious, and not successful in everything it attempts. However, the one thing this one gets right is the quantity of fight scenes. Its 21 separate brawls constitute one of the most action-packed martial arts outings from the western hemisphere, and I love the variety of onscreen combatants - this is truly one of the last great cattle calls for performers in American cinema, and features several cool fighters you'll only see here. Expect to see a ton of fighting styles represented.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Street-Fighter/dp/B001L2ZSJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Street Fighter</a>&nbsp;was one of the first films to be based on a video game, and is the first of this sort to actually be profitable. With that said, it's undeniably goofy and will probably appeal most to nostalgia fans and younger viewers. I love the wide-ranged casting (having Van Damme in the same film as Raul Julia, Damian Chapa, Ming Na, and Kylie Minogue only happens once), and the comedy definitely has its high points, but there's not nearly enough fighting that this picture warrants. On the plus side, this is the only DVD of the set that packs any substantial special features.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sudden-Death/dp/0783219660/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sudden Death</a>&nbsp;is Van Damme's long-overdue entry to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Hard/dp/B000O77SRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Hard</a>-knockoff subgenre, and it's a pretty good one, too. ""Die Hard at a hockey game"" may or may not sound appealing, but our hero makes the most of things, including a karate fight with an enforcer wearing a penguin costume. The picture benefits from the inclusion of a charismatic villain (Powers Boothe,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deadwood/dp/B001FA1OTU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deadwood</a>), and for general action movie fans who like Van Damme but would prefer to see him stick to the middle of the road and avoid going to stylistic extremes, this one will probably be their favorite of the pack.",1424044800,8,4933,6.548238897396631

well Universal have reissued these 5 classic Action films Hard target, the Quest, street fighter Sudden Death & Lionheart

i've checked out each film and the picture quality does look amazing very nice sharp & clear picture much better quality
than the old Digital remasters, the sound quality is very good aswell the new 5.1 master mixes much better quality than the old Dolby stereo
EXTRAS
tragically only each film has their own original Theatrical Trailer in 1080p quality
but that's to be expected, if these films get any extras at all
Don't think universal would've made any effort to get new retrospect interview with Van Damme about these 5 films he did
which is not surprising at all
all Universal have done is give these 5 films new Life with new HD transfers & sound mixes which is better than no effort
as a Van damme fan myself Universal did a great Job with the new HD transfers of each film
so don't bother wasting your money buying an old dvd copy of these 5 films
