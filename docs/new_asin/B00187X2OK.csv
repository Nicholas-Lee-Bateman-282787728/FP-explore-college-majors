3412236,5,B00187X2OK,I had this on VHS and wanted the quality of a DVD.  After ordering I am very happy I did.  These are hard to find no the item was in the original wrapper!  If you like Southern Gospel this is as good as it gets!,1358640000,2,211,3.6444444444444444
3412237,5,B00187X2OK,"I just noticed that this showed only one review; I must have missed doing a review. At first I bought the VHS used, from another company, and I probably did my review there.  It did not last too long, so I bought the DVD. It is one of my favorites.

This is when David was fairly new with the group. The GVB is great, and Vestal sings her heart out. Mark is funny, and the people are interesting. Nothing wrong with this recording. Anyone I have played it for, likes it. I like it! So, there's my opinion!

3412238,3,B00187X2OK,"""Hawaiian Homecoming"" was filmed and recorded overlooking the beach at the Aston Wailea Resort on Maui Island in Hawaii. The background photography adds an extra special touch to the atmosphere of the concert. The colorful foliage, flowers and sunset are a reminder of the awesomeness and detail of God's creation.

Bill and Gloria Gaither, The Gaither Vocal Band, and Homecoming Friends, Jake Hess, Vestal Goodman, Janet Paschal, and the Martins join together in a full program of entertainment, inspiration, praise and worship.

Highlights for me include: The First Assembly of Church Choir of Maui singing backup for Janet Paschal on ""Born Again."" They also sang a unique arrangement of ""Praise the Lord Every Nation."" I also enjoyed all of the numbers with Jake Hess and others from the team. These included ""Jesus, I Believe What You Said"" with the Vocal Band, and ""I Don't Think I Know"" with the Martins. Other favorites include: ""Hear My Song,"" ""The King is Coming,"" and Anthony Burger's piano medley featuring ""Just a Little While"" and ""Meeting in the Air.""

I appreciated the fact that a full listing of the program with, songs and artists are included on the back cover of this recording. Credits also include the musicians and production staff.

I missed some of the spontaneity of the other Homecoming productions. The audience response lacked the enthusiasm that adds to the excitement of a Gaither Homecoming concert.  I enjoyed Mark Lowry's spoof on being a ""lead singer"" but felt some of the comedy spots have been overworked in earlier concerts. On the whole I was somewhat disappointed with the overall concert.",1312675200,4,1629,5.063432835820896
