8563885,2,B00B81NQPG,"I was expecting some kind of musical introduction to J.Lo, but instead it is an unauthorized  ""biography"" and rather a rip-off.  It's only 40 minutes long and purports to be a biography, but it actually only consists of selections from several TV interviews aided  by some still photographs.  There are no clips from her movies or very much in the way of actual music selections.  You learn a few things about her in the initial stages of the DVD, but these few facts are mostly useful primarily if you already know something of her history.  True, the DVD was only $8.99 but I think it was a total waste of money.",1384905600,,614,4.486486486486487
