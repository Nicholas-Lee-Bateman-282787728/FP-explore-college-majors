8738695,2,B0059VVP04,"im a big fan of mid south wrestling ,and the only guy who tells good stories on this video is skandor akbar and i think he really knew what was going on in mid south  , the rest of them aren't even interesting .steve williams was suffering with throat  cancer in the video and sadly he could hardly talk  and did very little talking at all . brad armstrong was ok , bill dundee kind of hogged the interview and i really don't remember him very much in mid south at all . tim horner was a mid card wrestler in mid south wrestling at best .they could have gotten much better talent from the midsouth wrestling days if they really wanted to do a good video ,but you cant tell that,  thats not in the cards in this video the minute you start to watch it . 1st the video looked like it was filmed in a garage somewhere ,the table they sit around is much to big and takes up the screen ,and you can tell someone spilled something on the table cloth and just left it there for the viewers to see . and what is the worst part is the the audio on this dvd , its so low , and when you put the volume higher and someone laughs/coughs or gets excited talking  the sound gets so loud it will get your neighbors attention . all in all this is a very disappointing video for the subject matter  in all areas, my advice save your money ,i hope someone gets better talent on this subject and puts  much higher production value into it then this one  .",1506816000,,1434,4.060283687943262
