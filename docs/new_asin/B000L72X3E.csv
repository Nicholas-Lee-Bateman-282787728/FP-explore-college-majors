8544165,4,B000L72X3E,"I saw this movie when I was in France a few months ago and wacthed it all the way through in French! I found it
a lot of fun if you like action adventure shoot em ups with a little sci-fi and comedy thrown in. It's worth owning
but am having a lot of trouble finding it in the U.S. You can catch a lot of it on U Tube to get an idea. There is also
the new urban jumping from building to building French thing in it, I don't know what its called but it adds to
the overall excitement of the movie. A fun flick!",1205193600,,509,3.7222222222222223
