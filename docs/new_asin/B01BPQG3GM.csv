7665806,2,B01BPQG3GM,"The production centers around Remo Street (Beau Casper Smart) who we initially see doing parkour that we never see again. There is a local gym with a fighter (John Brickner) that has a bad personality and father/owner (Gregory Fawcett) that owes the stereotypical Russian mafia (Mark Ryan). Remo gets involved saving the daughter (Kate Miner) in a convenience store and 14 minutes into the film the plot is laid out quicker than the guys Street will have to fight.

The film had a made-for-TV feel to it with a substandard soundtrack, choppy sound in one scene, formula writing, and soap opera faux drama. The whole drop the towel scene was so stupid. Except for Shashawnee Hall the acting left much to be desired.

Guide: No swearing sex or nudity.",1463961600,3,749,4.7984496124031
7665807,5,B01BPQG3GM,"I wasn't sure if the main actor was going to pull it off do to the fact he was unknown, but with great actors like Mark Ryan and real fighters like Uriah Hall and Matt Mitrione it turned out to be a good film. Great action and the film keep you interested in the story and out come. It was a clean film with no sewer words but their is blood, I say grab a copy it's worth the watch. .",1462406400,,384,3.753086419753086

7665850,4,B01BPQG3GM,What can i say. I love MMA. The rating is not just because of that. The writing was a bit like a Rocky movie but the acting was good. And it made me want to keep watching. I liked the Rocky movies too.,1472169600,,201,3.697674418604651

7665856,5,B01BPQG3GM,"I was very excited to see that there is finally a new MMA movie out and that it is a respectable movie. I knew going in that this was not a high budget movie and quite honestly I was being a bit of a pessimist which probably worked in the movie's favor.
I expected bad writing, bad acting, cheesy fights and a plot as invisible as Wonder Woman's plane. I am not comparing this movie to Here Comes the Boom, I am comparing it realistically as a small budget film and I have to say that when I first saw Beau Casper Smart in the opening scenes in his apartment with the corn rows, I was not too sure I was going to like the protagonist so I was already thinking the worst but to my surprise the movie, Smart and the other characters started to grow on me and though it does not end with Rocky style heroics and a 7 - 12 minute long music infused fight scene, it is much more of what you typically expect from MMA fights that last 3 rounds. A bit more realistic if you ask me. Most fights in real life do not last nearly as long as Hollywood portrays. A lot less like volcano eruptions and a lot more like earthquakes. I have to say that when the movie was over it made the cut and now sits on my DVD shelf in the fight movie section right beside Here Comes the Boom and Blood Sport. I will admit that there were a couple of cheesy scenes where Smart falls in love with the lady lead and the first workout sequence building up to the big fight; music was like something you would see in a faith based film but what the film did was tell a story from start to finish that actually made sense. I wish that they would have shown the female lead, Kate Minor, up to down a little more. She has some sexy legs. Only one scene shows them.",1464220800,,1728,4.040816326530612

8751084,3,B01BPQG3GM,"This was a pleasant little surprise to me, I wasn't expecting anything sensational but this movie was entertaining, if not somewhat formulaic. A young man named Remo Street (Beau Casper Smart, I think) training for something? intervenes when some Russians apply pressure to a man to pay them back. he roughs up the two huge Russians (Remo is not a big guy at all) then has to answer to an underground Russian fight promoter for damaging his 2 best fighters. So Remo must now fight in their place. A couple fun turns now and then, the requisite romance and so on but all in all not a bad little move to see. If you have some time check this out. The actors weren't bad either.",1475971200,,675,4.408
