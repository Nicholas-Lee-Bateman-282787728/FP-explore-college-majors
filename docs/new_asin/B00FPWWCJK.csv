6019895,4,B00FPWWCJK,"As with all of Film Movement's releases, Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow by Arvin Chen is an official selection of numerous film festivals. (Chen both wrote and directed the film.)

 Weichung works as an optometrist and lives a quiet life with his wife and six year old son. His wife is pressing to have another child and his sister is getting married - well, maybe - she's still unsure about committing. And then a handsome young male flight attendant walks in the shop - and all that Weichung has suppressed for many years is awakened. You see, Weichung is gay, but has resisted since marrying his wife Feng.

 Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow is billed as a ""madcap and lighthearted comedic romp"", but I think that's a bit of a misnomer. I thought the film was more poignant than comedic. Mind you, there are some comedic bits, much of it provided by the gay wedding photographer and his friends. But the exploration of love, where we find it, what happens when doing the wrong thing feels right and when doing the right thing is no better is more of the focus. I thought Chen handled this theme very well. There are no judgement calls or morality lessons in the film - rather just a thoughtful look at modern life and love.

 I found the mix of Taiwanese and Western culture fascinating. The string musical soundtrack seemed very appropriate and mirrored what was happening on screen. The Shirrell's musical fantasy scene went on a little too long for me. (Although that is of course where the title is derived from.) I thought the acting was good all round, with the sister and photographer standing out for me.

 The short film (always included in Film Movement releases) was also from Arvin Chen. Mei is a short also set in Taiwan,about a restaurant helper who can't tell the owner's daughter he loves her. It won awards for Chen and seems to have been the testing ground for this full length feature.",1408060800,,1907,4.588235294117647
6019896,5,B00FPWWCJK,"My only complaint about this movie is not about the film, but about its marketing disconnect between the the movie's description on the case (and the Amazon product page) and the nature of the movie itself. My wife and I watched this recently as a compromise. Based on the product description that begins ""In this madcap and lighthearted comedic romp..."", I watched it expecting ""When Harry Met Sally"" or ""The 40-Year Old Version"" seen through Taiwanese filters.

The movie is much different. If you're expecting a formulaic (and happily ever after) romcom experience that doesn't require thought or energy: forget it. Because while this movie is infused with humor throughout (sometimes dry, sometimes in-your-face), it also takes on serious issues of the nature of love, marriage and sexuality. It does so without judgement and will leave the engaged viewer with plenty to ponder.

Taiwanese optometrist Wei Cheng and his cube-farm working wife Lan Feng are the parents of a six-year old boy, and Feng is pressing him to have another child. In the background --and unknown to Feng-- Wei Cheng is rekindling relationships with men from a previous gay life unknown to Feng, and developing an attraction to a new customer --a man-- as he ponders his true identity.

In the background is Wei Cheng's sister Mandy and her on again/off again engagement, and the quiet but strong attraction of Feng's boss to Feng.

In short: lots going on here as everybody assesses what they need, what they want and what the right thing to do might be.

This movie is truly bittersweet, and the resolutions are not without ambiguity. The characters are likeable, the dialog is funny and crisp (even with subtitles...if you know a little Chinese, it's even better!) and the balance of 21st century relationships and longstanding mores of Chinese culture (is it time to have another baby? go see the fortune teller!) are wonderfully done.

Excellent movie.",1407542400,2,1935,5.012461059190031
6019897,5,B00FPWWCJK,"This film is a little gem! I really loved the warm, tender and light way in which the director presented this story, as he managed to make the characters seem old friends and their struggles relatable. And even if it is a rich, subtly layered film that will make you think about ones search for identity and what relationships mean, its humor makes the viewing experience very enjoyable. Highly recommended!",1407283200,,407,4.828571428571428
6019898,3,B00FPWWCJK,"Arvin Chen wrote and directed this featherweight little farce that lack substance and really is not all that entertaining. Weichung (Richie Ren) is and optometrist who has been married to Fen (Mavis Fan) for nine years in what likely was to be a `cover' marriage: Weichung is gay and still `looking'. At the point where Fen is asking to start another child (they have one 6 year old son) the fragile thread becomes taut. Weichung meets a handsome airline steward and that sort of tips the scales. There is a subplot concerning Weichung's sister Mandy (Kimi Hsia) that never takes off except that her incipient wedding brings on board a gay wedding photographer Stephen (Lawrence Ko) who jolts Weichung about his balancing lifestyle. In the end we are left with an old song sung before and better. Times have changed and films like this seem a bit moldy. Grady Harp, August 14",1407110400,,875,4.7631578947368425
6019899,5,B00FPWWCJK,"If you love recent Taiwanese films on city life, this one is by and large within that category and at the same time bring fresh air to the landscape. Warm and sometimes humorous, the movie looks like Taiwanese youth movies at the first sight. But as the story develops, the seemingly light-heartedness gradually gives way to a deeper search of self-identity. The movie is also a great window to learn about gay life in Taiwan. On the one hand, in the modern, highly westernized society the gay community has formed its dynamic and distinctive culture. But on the other hand, the community remains largely underground, as the traditional family values still looms large. Like a lot of great indie films, the movies story is small but reflects big, without being overly-serious or bitter.",1406073600,,786,4.917293233082707
6019900,4,B00FPWWCJK,"We received this movie as part of the Film Movement series.  We've encountered a lot of unexpected, small-wattage international gems that way - 'Teddy Bear' from Denmark as a notable example.  ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow"" was another pleasant surprise.  We'd seen the trailer, which frankly seemed to reduce expectations.  But the film experience itself easily surpassed those. Writer/director Arvin Chen has come up with a small gem here.

And, for anyone with a fear of 'foreign' film who thinks they won't relate to something from Taiwan: Chen was born and raised in California, attended USC, wrote the first drafts of the film in English.  The themes he explores here are universal and transportable across cultures.

Leads Richie Ren (Wei-chung) and Mavis Fan (Feng) are likable presences.  Fan's background as a singer is put to good use here in the neat dream-like sequence that gives the film its title.

I really liked Kimi Hsia as Wei-chung's little sister, Mandy - beautiful eyes, comedic delivery, involved in what I thought was the film's neatest trick: imaginary repartee with the star of a maudlin love story who has jumped off the screen and to her side as she wallows in abject self-pity during a pre-wedding break-up. Sounds treacly. It's not. Writer/director Chen plays it for a spot of fun and gets the tone of it exactly right than to Ms. Hsia.  We need to see more of her.",1404604800,,1399,4.864978902953586
6019901,5,B00FPWWCJK,"This subtitled movie is about the lives we lead and the lives we dream of. Married couple Feng and Weichung are doing well together but when it comes down to it, are really dreaming of different things. Feng wants another baby and Weichung is tempted by his past life as a gay man. Both are struggling to make throughout each day, juggling work, a sweet son, and their own troubled relationship.

The extra characters are fun including Stephen, the gay but married to a lesbian, photographer who seems to rock Weichung's world reminding him of who he once was. There are moments of joy, happiness, abandon and loneliness. Overall it tries to be funny but it is more deep than that.

Worth watching for the great acting and glimpse into another culture.",1402963200,,752,4.6893939393939394
6019902,4,B00FPWWCJK,"This Taiwanese film with English subtitles tells two interconnected stories.  Weichung is a businessman in his late thirties, married to a very pretty woman named Feng.  They have a young son, and all appears to be going well for them except that Weichung has a vague feeling of unhappiness or discontent. That comes to a head when Weichung's sister Mandy, who is engaged to Sen Sen, hires Stephen as her engagement photographer.  Stephen, it turns out, is an old friend of Weichung, and he immediately wants to rekindle the gay relationship the two had had years earlier.  At first Weichung rejects Stephen, but as the film goes on we see his own doubts and those of Feng, Mandy, and Sen Sen grow as they question their commitments to each other.

Despite the serious nature of the main story line, this is a film with some light hearted moments that suggest the ultimate fates of the main characters will be happy. The film is also interesting for its portrayal of the very Westernized culture in which its characters live and work.",1402617600,4,1034,4.722222222222222
6019903,4,B00FPWWCJK,"Let me state upfront that I am a big fan of the Film Movement library of foreign and indie movies, and that I am a subscriber to their DVD-of-the-Month club. This movie is in fact the December '13 release in that on-going series.

""Will You Still Love me Tomorrow?"" (2013 release from Taiwan; 106 min.) focuses on two couples. As the movie opens, we get to know Feng and her husband Weichung, a couple in their late thirties with a young son. We see them getting ready for another routine day (Feng has an office job, Weichung works in a Lenscrafters-style eyeglasses retail store). Soon thereafter we are introduced to the second couple, consisting of Weichung's younger sister Mandy and her fianc. The couples' stories are intertwined to a degree, but are fueled by two events: on the one hand Fend is once again bringing up the issue of planning for another baby with Weichung, and on the other hand Mandy is overcome with fear that she made the wrong choice, both as to her husband-to-be and her lifestyle if she were to marry. Will these couples be able to resolve their problems? To tell you more of the plot-heavy storyline would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the second full-length feature from American-Taiwanese director Arvin Chen. It is clear that Chen has a nose for finding a good story that brings a new (or at least: different) perspective. The pressure, direct and indirect, that the couples feel, both from their immediate families (parents, in particular) and society as a whole, to conform to a certain expected 'family unit' and/or lifestyle, is suffocating. Second, if you wonder about the movie's title, yes it is indeed the Shirelles tune (Fang sings it at a karaoke-dinner party one evening with co-workers). Third, be sure to check out the 10 min. interview with Arvin Chen in the DVD bonus materials, as he gives great insight on certain aspects of the movie that will otherwise escape you. Last but not least, as is always the case, the Film Movement DVD contains a bonus shortie, in this case Chen's debut as a writer-director, the 13 min. ""Wei"" (from 2006), in which a teenage boy is in love with the daughter of a noodle stand owner but struggles to express his love. Well worth watching!

Bottom line: I really enjoyed this movie, even though (or perhaps because of) its bittersweet undertones about life in general, and love relationships in particular. As a result, ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?"" is another great addition to the ever-growing Film Movement library of foreign and indie movies.

8617865,5,B00FPWWCJK,"Weichung appears to be an unassuming optometrist - married to Feng his wife and with a little boy. She wants another child to keep the boy company and to do so before her biological clock stops ticking. He though seems to be content with early nights to bed - to sleep - only.

Then one day a man walks into his shop - Thomas a flight attendant - and he goes all a flutter as does this handsome stranger. Weichung also has some old friends - one being Stephen who takes Wedding photos and would give Liberace a run for his money at how to be camp. It seems all of Weichungs old friends are `friends of Dorothy' too - so could there be a connection?

Soon he is waiting for Thomas to land all the time and it is only a matter of time before things come to a head - no pun intended. This is actually a really light and warm comedy. The laughs are not gut busters but the humour is more the dry observational sort. You sort of feel for all the characters they all come across so human. There is a sub plot with his sister and her rejection of a very sweet man who Stephen and co take under their wing to sort out his love life and that is actually a brilliant touch. We also have a bit of drunken Karaoke with a rather good version of the title song in English.

In Mandarin with English sub titles and a run time of 106 minutes this is just a very nice film, the sort that puts a smile on your face and has your faith in the human spirit reinvigorated .",1418515200,,1451,4.03125
