1358822,5,B00004VVOV,"The video is a bit short, one of those you just WISH was a little longer. Pretty much all the videos in this series are very well produced and the actors are good.
This is the story of Jeremiah, a prophet who was called while he was still in his mother's womb. The movie is a portrayal of the life of Jeremiah and his ministry to the last kings of Judah. Scripturally speaking, I give this movie a B. There is a love story that holds together some of the parts that is not directly scriptural (but it doesn't detract from truth) and there is one scene where Jeremiah says God deceived him (not quite the original context in Scripture, though) but they did not have God's answer to Jeremiah in Scripture, which was basically: stop whining and don't speak foolishly.
The movie has its share of violence, of course, and is not good for little children to watch. But overall this is an enjoyable movie.",995328000,10,898,4.4156626506024095
1358823,4,B00004VVOV,"Of 'The Bible' series by Lube Productions, this has to be one of their finest. The scene where Jeremiah, who at the start of his priestly ministry, prophesied to the assembled worshippers and the dissolute King was one of the most profound I have seen. Patrick Dempsey is well cast for his role as the unflinching prophet who contends with spirital apostasy, political intrigue and the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple. (One can only speculate, but I would dearly like to see a film made by Lube about Elijah!). This film is a worthy addition to the video library of anyone who likes Biblical dramas. Care and attention  was paid to historical and Biblical accuracy, without the sleaze and 'extra-curricular' activities indulged by many earlier films about the Bible.",981244800,21,774,4.953846153846154
1358824,5,B00004VVOV,"I actually saw the French Version of this Video in Ivory Coast, but it was still incredible.  Of this series, Jeremiah is the most inspiring.  This film does a great job of showing the pain and suffering which Jeremiah went through.  Very Professionally done.  Made for TV type series.  Does a great job of showing the pain and torture that Jeremiah went through.  His persistence is encouraging.",974246400,8,396,4.835820895522388
1358825,5,B00004VVOV,"Well done. Inspiring. Sobering. 'Jeremiah' does an excellent job at givng us a glimpse into what life for Jeremiah must have been like after God called him to be His prophet. This is not a cheesy attempt to put the Scriptures on film, but a professionally-done rendering of a complex Biblical character with a most difficult assignment from God. I highly recommend this film to everyone!",972086400,11,387,4.878787878787879

Other films in this series include the Story of Jacob and Joseph (Colleen Dewhurst), Esther (F. Murray Abraham), The Story of David, Solomon (Ben Casey).

1358911,5,B00004VVOV,"This moving yet disturbing motion picture - JEREMIAH, is brought to it's viewer's by the International Program Consultants, Inc. and the Five Mile River Films. Which proudly present yet another compelling biblical drama, by way of a Lube Production for Lux Vide Beta Film & Quinta Communications and Rai Uno. This 1997, color, single-disc, DVD - JEREMIAH, starring Actor: Patrick Dempsey in the title role, shows for approximately 95-minutes in full screen format. This riveting movie presentation of: JEREMIAH, is the historical and true life portrayal of the biblical Old Testament Prophet: JEREMIAH (See the Books of: JEREMIAH 1:1-52:34 & Lamentations 1:1-5:22), as written within the Holy Bible. Directed by: Harry Winer, this feature length film has an impressive array of Actors, which include: Leonor Varela as 'Judith'; Oliver Reed as 'General Safan' and Klaus Maria Brandauer as 'Nebuchadnezzar', the King of Babylon. Actors: Vincent Regan and Michael Cronin, co-star. This biblical drama not only depicts the historical fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians but it also, vividly depicts what was written in the Holy Scriptures about the Prophet JEREMIAH, himself. Namely, that JEREMIAH was chosen by the Lord to lead an impoverished, lonely, miserable and solitary life, proclaiming an unpopular and what was thought too be a treasonous message. Poor JEREMIAH! Because by Divine mandate, he was not too have any romance, marriage, a wife or children. Never would he meet, mate or procreate and enjoy the company of any grandchildren, from his own loins. No amount of prayers, petitions, fasting or even tearful beseeching, would change the Lord's mind. JEREMIAH was to be single and celibant for the whole of his wretched existence as opposed too, abundant life. On top of that, he was mandated by the Lord too proclaim an unpopular message to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for which, he was hated. JEREMIAH was so despised, rejected and on numerous occasions almost killed, that history records him as being: The ""weeping"" or ""wailing"" Prophet. And for proclaiming the message that the Lord had decreed, he was mistreated, persecuted, wrongly imprisoned, thought to be a traitor and thrown into a cistern (well), and left to starve to death. Why? Because he accurately prophesied that Jerusalem would be destroyed ""if"" the inhabitants of the City, did not submit to the King of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar. Specifically, by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, the Prophet JEREMIAH wrote of himself and the precise words that the Lord had spoken unto him, regarding his calling and selection and the message that he was to proclaim. In addition too, the cruel and unwarranted hardship's that he was to endure, saying: 'Then the word of the Lord came to me (JEREMIAH), saying: ""Before I formed you in the womb, I (the Lord) knew you; Before you were born I (the Lord) sanctified you; I (the Lord) ordained you a Prophet to the Nations."" Then said I (JEREMIAH): ""Ah, Lord God! Behold, I cannot speak, for I am a youth."" But the Lord said to me: ""Do not say, 'I am a youth,' for you shall go to all to whom I send you, and whatever I command you, you shall speak. Do not be afraid of their faces, for I AM with you to deliver you,"" says the Lord. Then the Lord put forth His hand and touched my mouth, and the Lord said to me: ""Behold, I have put My Words in your mouth. See, I have this day, set you (JEREMIAH) over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out and to pull down, to destroy and to throw down, to build and to plant."" Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying, ""JEREMIAH, what do you see?"" And I said, ""I see a branch of an almond tree."" Then the Lord said to me, ""You have seen well, for I AM ready to perform My Word."" Then the Lord, said to me: ""Out of the north (Babylon) calamity shall break forth on the inhabitants of the land."" (On the Kingdom of Judah and especially, on it's Capital City = Jerusalem). ""For behold, I AM calling all the families of the kingdoms of the north,"" says the Lord; ""They shall come and each one shall set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem (there will be a humongous siege against Jerusalem), against all it's walls all around, and against all the cities of Judah."" (In other words, from the North... the Kingdom of Judah will be annihilated by the Babylonians). ""I (the Lord) will utter My Judgement's (punishments), against them (the inhabitant's of the Kingdom of Judah in particular, against it's Capital = Jerusalem), ""concerning all their wickedness, because they have forsaken Me, burned incense to other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands"" (idolatry). ""Therefore, prepare yourself (JEREMIAH) and arise, and speak to them, all that I have commanded you. Do not be dismayed before their faces, lest I dismay you, before them. For behold, I (the Lord) have made you this day, a fortified city and an iron pillar, and bronze walls against the whole land - against the kings of Judah, against it's princes, against it's priest's, and against the people of the land. They will fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you. For I AM with you,"" says the Lord, ""to deliver you"" (JEREMIAH 1:4-19 NKJV). The Lord was descriptively referring to JEREMIAH, as a ""fortified city"", an ""iron pillar"" and one with ""bronze walls"" so as too say, that hence forth, JEREMIAH would be as flint to a stone with a back bone of iron and one..., with an unyielding will, mission and purpose. And indeed, such was the case. Until all of the predestined events that the Lord, through His Prophet JEREMIAH had foretold, came about. And so, by the power and inspiration of the Holy Spirit, the Prophet JEREMIAH authored and chronicled these events, which documented history will further attest too. JEREMIAH's God-ordained - lot in life, namely that of a celibant, suffering and hated Prophet with a message that would be rejected by his own people and even it's king, was the total opposite of his paternal heritage. Born into privilege, JEREMIAH was the son of an established Priest, complete with domestic stability, standing and position within the community and financial comfort within the purse of his parents. As a son..., all of these creature comforts were afforded, too him. All he had to do, was follow in his father's footstep's as an up and coming Priest, that served the King. But, the Lord had other plans for JEREMIAH. The Prophet of the Lord, would serve..., no man. JEREMIAH was to serve the Lord: First, foremost and only! Even if it meant, prophesying against a fearful, inexperienced and corrupt, King. And, as would be expected, being severely punished for it, too. Why exactly? Because JEREMIAH dared to go against the established political grain by warning the arrogant King Zedekiah, that it would be better too submit to Babylonian governorship rather than face utter destruction and subsequent exile into Babylon. But Zedekiah, was defiant and refused to listen to JEREMIAH's word's of wisdom and truth, preferring to act upon the flattering and deceptive babbling's of his false prophets. JEREMIAH was imprisoned and just as the Lord had foretold, Nebuchadnezzar the King of Babylon, came a calling. Right too..., Jerusalem's' doorstep. JEREMIAH - having been branded a traitor, was treated very harshly by his own people. That is, until he came face-to-face with the pagan King: Nebuchadnezzar. Then, as the true, Prophet of the Lord (JEREMIAH) had foretold..., things started to change and come to pass, dramatically. What exactly happened? Well that..., you will have to see for yourself. This enthralling film is spiritually and historically accurate, regardless of the fact that some theatrical license was taken. This engrossing, big-screen, graphic and horrifying depiction of a Kingdom that once was..., now fallen, and led away as captives into Babylonian exile and servitude along with the reasons for it, are all powerfully and factually illustrated. This entertaining and educational, biblical drama is well worthy of your viewing time. And definitely a keeper for your home or church DVD library. Nina Kish",1422576000,,8133,4.915636363636364

1358921,4,B00004VVOV,"Jeremiah is a story of the prophet who abandons his family and the woman he loves, in order to relay God's message in Jerusalem. God appears to Jeremiah in different human guises on several occasions, and makes it clear to him that he has been selected to announce God's message to the people of Jerusalem: a mighty ruler from the north will attack the Kingdom of Judah if the people there continue to worship false idols, and fail to remember the One God. Although he is persecuted and branded as a traitor for warning others of the destruction of the Holy City, he continues fearlessly with his mission. When his prophecy is fulfilled, he experiences first-hand Jerusalem's destruction by the Babylonians.

In this TV movie,Patrick Dempsey gives an earnest performance. Writer-director Harry Winer spends the first part of the film on Jeremiah's formative years of visions, moving on to his contentious relationship with King Zedekiah, who unfortunately listened to his general rather than the prophet. This bleak film ends with the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians and Jeremiah's self-comforting thought that the city will rise again. Parents should be aware of some disturbing violence like Jeremiah's fiance's murder and when Zedekiah sees his sons fatally stabbed before he is killed. Overall,it is a good Biblical movie that is inspiring and worth watching.",1417910400,,1368,5.134529147982063

It is about the life of Jeremiah the prophet that the book is written about in the bible, and the fall of Israel due to their disobedienvce to God. It ends with the promise that God will once again restore Jerusalem and its temple, and bring its people back to it. The movie is 75% true to the bible.. He did not have a girlfriend according to the Word of God , but it does show the difficult life the prophet had to live while serving God.",1405900800,2,613,4.116666666666666
1358949,1,B00004VVOV,The only thing that it shares in common with The Holy Bible - is the characters's name.  Read The Bible instead.  Jeremiah deserved better than this tripe.  Why film such an important account and do it so weakly and create characters that did not even exist?  This prophet would weep at this travesty (and for those who have read his account in The Holy Bible I chose the wording of this part of my review deliberately).  I rate this as one of the worst Biblical dramas ever put on film.  Sadly there are far too many of them.,1405555200,3,526,4.316326530612245

1358951,5,B00004VVOV,"no, this is not the book of Jeremiah, but very close (some dialogue is directly out of the Book of Jeremiah), and the setting is appropriate as to how events may have happened as the script provides historical details, settings, conversations etc.  Jeremiah as played by Patrick Dempsey is believable in portraying this troubled prophet faithful to God under dire circumstances. The supporting cast, sets and photography is excellent.  The music in this film sets the mood very well.  Klaus Bandauer as Nebudchadnezzer is a standout performance.  This is a serious look at Jeremiah's prophetic indictment of a decaying people who repeatedly sink into the abyss of their own neglect and decadence under the rule of a self-absorbed and arrogant King.  Recommended for anyone who has not only a biblical, but also an historic interest in Jeremiah's times.",1405209600,6,852,5.144927536231884

1358971,4,B00004VVOV,"One thing which struck me were the direct quotations from the Bible which elevated the authenticity and realism of this biblical movie. The quotes from the book of Jeremiah were very inspiring and certainly moved me.

The confrontations between Jeremiah and the people he was supposed to deliver God's message to were realistically acted out and awe inspiring as well. The boldness and courage was extraordinary.

Editing was done quite well. Continuity was good.

The only thing I am not convinced it did happened were the scenes where Jeremiah and Edith were hugging and kissing each other . I doubt that would have happened considering the strictness of the Old Testament laws and the culture of that time.

Overall, it is still a good and biblical movie. The story reminds of the current state of affairs here in the United States. There is a strong parallel here in the US where, at the national level, we are doing a lot of things that are sinful and against God yet more and more people are executing these sinful acts. When a nation turn from their godly ways towards sinful ways, God will not stand aside but will judge that nation. I certainly hope we will not end up like Israel during Jeremiah's time.",1387929600,,1213,4.7075471698113205
1358972,5,B00004VVOV,I watch Jeremiah again and again as it is so deeply moving.  Patrick Dempsey brought an intimate and deeply felt rendition of the prophet and God's word.  It arrived much sooner than expected and in excellent condition.,1386460800,2,219,4.891891891891892
1358973,5,B00004VVOV,"This is a good dramatic film that accurately presents the life and message of the late seventh and early sixth century biblical prophet Jeremiah with some fair imaginative additions. I say this as a man who has written more than a dozen books on the Bible. It is true, as many reviewers noted, that there is no indication in the biblical book, for example, about Jeremiahs love life, but people may speculate, as long as they recognize that it is speculation, what the Bible meant when it states that God told Jeremiah not to marry.

It is the biblical style in many biblical books to make obscure or ambiguous statements, and leave it to readers to imagine what occurred. For example, right at the beginning of the Bible, Genesis 4:8 reports, Cain said to his brother Abel, but it does not reveal what he said. The sentence finishes instead by saying Cain killed Abel. It leaves it to the readers imagination what Cain said and what provoked him to slay his brother. So, too, with Jeremiah. The Bible says God told him not to marry, and the film makers speculate that he wanted to do so, but then felt he had to devote himself to his mission.

People wanting to know more about Jeremiah, the book and the mans mission, may want to also read Jeremiah by Rabbi Dr. Binyamin Lau. It is extremely difficult if not impossible to understand Jeremiahs life, thinking, and writings without reading this book by this highly respected and articulate Orthodox rabbi with a PhD. This is primarily due to the fact that the book Jeremiah is not composed in chronological order. Lau narrates and explains Jeremiahs life and reveals his concerns and messages to the people of his time and to their kings as it actually happened, not in the order currently in his book. For example, the chronological order for the start of Jeremiahs life and messages is: chapters 1, 3, 31, verses 23:1-8, chapters 30, 2, 10, 17, 11, 18, 3. The order of the end is: chapters 42, 43, 44, 52.",1385510400,2,1958,4.591428571428572

1358982,4,B00004VVOV,"It was made in a style seen in the days of biblcal movies made in the 60's.  No CGI or mindblowing graphics as seen on The Bible (2013), but quiet unassuming and somewhat boring kind of movie.  I do like the scenery because it being out in the desert in a real looking desert towns, it makes the movie more real.  The movie somewhat followed the bible with no major gripes.  Not sure how to deal with Jeremiah's companion, I guess it was plausible but it was not important enough to mention of it in the Bible so not sure why it got so much time in the movie only I surmise to make the movie interesting instead of dry sequences and more boring (documentary style) than it is.  Otherwise, I do enjoy Old Testiment adventures and thus this movie fits the bill satisfactorily.  Not bad, could be better; but there is no other movies for this great prophet so I guess this will have to fit the bill.",1375660800,,896,4.272189349112426

This DVD is great acting and background information that is Biblically accurate.  I am reading Jeremiah and I was surprised just how accurate the movie really is.. A well presented movie that tells the story of how Jeremiah's life unfolds as a prophet, a man called by God. It tells of the sacrifices Jeremiah faced as he receives the messages from THE LORD OF HOSTS for his people.
The only exaggeration I saw in the movie  is an event where Jeremiah may have been in love. That is not in the Biblical text. I really enjoyed the events of Jeremiah's day and times brought to life. It gives this visually enhanced picture to someone who does not have
a lot of historical knowledge of the years of 627 BC. It brought my I imagination to life as I read and studied this book from Scripture.",1361145600,6,818,4.446666666666666

1359013,4,B00004VVOV,"""Jeremiah"" works pretty well as a biopic.  It does what a movie has to do, simplifying and providing a central narrative thread.  It shows Jeremiah's struggles, and gives samples of his message.  It touches on his great themes, including the possibility of repentance and God's wonderful promises in the New Covenant.

Violence was part of Jeremiah's message and life, and we see plenty:  perhaps more than necessary, though I can't recall seeing any blood.  This is not a movie for young children.

To judge from a translation, much of Jeremiah's message was delivered in striking, often moving *poetry*.  The poetry does not come across in the movie.  Maybe, just maybe, great visual poetry would have helped.

On a personal note, I wish that they had used an existing classical choral setting of the biblical book of Lamentations during the closing credits.",1343001600,4,860,5.035460992907802

1359015,5,B00004VVOV,"I don't know about most people, but I usually think of old testament prophets as old men with long white hair. That's ridiculous though. They weren't always old. This is the story of the 'young' Prophet Jeremiah at the time he hears God's call to warn about the pending destruction of Jerusalem. I've always thought of Jeremiah as 'the Prophet of Doom', and he was. He also had a personal life. When God told him not to marry and have children, it doesn't seem like much of a sacrifice when you are reading the words. When you think about Jeremiah as a real flesh and blood person though, it takes on a whole new meaning. At the end of this movie, Jeremiah is released from prison only to watch the horrors of the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians. Very effective presentation. Jeremiah will never seem quite the same to me. I'm going to read it again.",1332720000,7,862,4.496815286624204
1359016,4,B00004VVOV,"While allowing for plenty of artistic license, this film seems to cover the essentials of Jeremiah's birth in the 7th century BC, his call to prophecy, his opposition to idolatry, and his prophesying against policy toward Babylon.  As God's warnings through Jeremiah went unheeded, the prophesies indeed came to pass.

I was disappointed that I was unable to find reviews of this film on either the USCCB web site or that of decentfilms dot com, to double check my own perceptions.",1332201600,,481,4.925925925925926

I have surround sound and elevated the sound and still could not understand their words. I find that so many actors and actresses should take classes on how to speak clearly and distinctly, it makes far more enjoyable watching of the movie when you can understand what they say. If that is not possible then I would suggest investing in captions. I was geared up for this movie,,, totally disappointed.",1311984000,,573,4.663366336633663
1359035,5,B00004VVOV,"Jeremiah was once called the Crying Prophet as it was well depicted here.  It would be difficult to speak against your family, your king, your country -- you could get lowered into a cistern.  Holy crap! (Sorry for that..) However, that's literally what happened.

The Book of Jeremiah is a long story that skips around chronically, which should have made it difficult to tell theatrically. There's so much in this movie: The Lord depicted as a little girl, and a older shepherd, Jeremiah crying for a sign from God, then appears Baruch, the torture of the king, the jails, etc.

More of God's prophecies could have been part of the movie, but that's okay. The Book of Jeremiah is a lengthy one. This movie accomplishes much for me; I gained insight about the divine strength that broke through the personal weaknesses that were inherently within the man Jeremiah. I did not want this movie to end.",1295827200,7,898,4.737179487179487
1359036,5,B00004VVOV,"Although certain liberties were taken for dramatic purposes, such as a love interest for the young Jeremiah, it served to humanize God's word that Jeremiah was not to take a wife.

I am using this movie for a discussion point for a Bible study.",1295740800,4,433,4.986111111111111
1359037,5,B00004VVOV,What an action packed story. Jeremiah lived an action packed life when the nation of Israel was going to lose their land at Jerusalem and go into exile in Babylon. He was a great role model to follow even today!! I will enjoy watching this movie again.,1291852800,2,252,4.382978723404255
1359048,3,B00004VVOV,"I did enjoy this movie. Mostly, it was reasonably well depicted. It irritated me that the angles were shown to be a little girl and an old man. Angels are powerful spirit creatures who do the bidding of our Creator. In another Bible account One Angel killed 185,000 Assyrian soldiers! That does not sound like the work of a child or old man. Also, the King would have never been in the ""Inner Courtyard"" of the Temple; only the priests were to be there. Moreover, the curtain to the Most Holy was a Thick barrier...not a flimsy fabric. Too, Jeremiah was put in stocks, not hung in a cage. Inaccuracies such as these always detract from the enjoyment of a movie for me. The visuals are helpful,however. Yet, if I am going to imprint something onto my mind I would rather it be true than Hollywood.",1289433600,49,796,4.458904109589041
1359049,3,B00004VVOV,The director of this film did a little better than he did on Solomon. However it still has some non scriptural elements like a little girl speaking for God.

I am grateful for the people that made Bible books clear by acting the parts. Several times I tried to understand, and visualize while reading from the Bible. Due to terms that I am not familiar with, I would loose any message that was being communicated. This movie brings the message clearly.
  At times during my life I encounter obstacles as Jeremiah did. Watching how Jeremiah decided, and acted on his decisions is what life is about. Of course too the scenery, and the performers are spectacular.",1284940800,26,604,4.742857142857143

1359052,5,B00004VVOV,"This film demonstrates the tremendous power movies have to inspire and instruct. The production team of Jeremiah did an excellent job of taking a 52 chapter book of the Bible and condensing it accurately to film. The dialogue is Scriptural, creative, and inspiring. The acting is superb. The sets, costumes, and effects are all realistic. But what sets this film apart from other Biblical stories on film is that while some liberties were taken with characters and dialogue, they were both believable and in-line with Scripture. One example ? The character of ""Judith"". Basically, this young woman is the wife-to-be of Jeremiah. They have a tender relationship, share some adventures together, but never marry. Why ? In the book of Jeremiah, God tells him that he will never marry because of the terrible wrath and destruction the Babylonian armies will bring upon Israel. In creating this character, the writers make the audience feel the pain and devastation such an unction from God would bring--far more than if he had no romantic ties whatsoever. But Judith represents even more. In creating this character, the writers brought to life a living metaphor for all good and lovely things God wanted to give His people to enjoy in their lives--had they been faithful to His commandments. Without this faithfulness to God, He could not bless them with all the good things He loves to bring upon His people. This is just one example of a 'liberty' the writers took that, contrary to most uses of this, greatly enhanced the characters and enriched the story. A definite ""must see"", for both Jew and Gentile.",1281744000,124,1605,4.948148148148148

The message is very close to the Scriptures, and any artistic license/poetic license is not outside of Biblical possibility.  A message of repentance comes thru clearly, and with sadness of punishment...you also end with hopes of deliverance and blessing (like any typical Biblical prophetic message in the Holy Scriptures).  Very good film, done well, you won't regret buying and watching over and over.  Very surprising that this is so enjoyable and accurate.  Add this to your Bible collection shelf!",1264723200,,572,5.173913043478261
1359056,5,B00004VVOV,"We watched this film portraying the book of Jeremiah from the old Testament last night, having received it as one 4 movies in the box set sold at Amazon.com. called the Bible Series. I look forward to watching the other films in the box set, which like Jeremiah can also be bought as separate DVD's.

The actor chosen to portray Jeremiah is much younger than I had imagined from the reading the text, but Patrick Dempsey does a very fine job in the complex role.  The Bible is not a gentle book, and Jeremiah's life was full of violence and death, as he begged first King Jehoiaim and his successor King Zedekiah to repent to the Lord and put a stop to false idol worship. When he conveyed the Lords message (and he was just the messenger) to that the Babylonians would conquer Jerusalem and they should surrender since it was God's will, he was branded a traitor. While not mentioned in the Bible, even his own father, a high priest, turned against him.  The reluctant prophet is dragged behind a horse, beaten mercilessly, imprisoned, thrown into a muddy cistern and left to die, starved, imprisoned and beaten again,... all for conveying a message that fell on deaf ears. Nebuchadnezzar the Babylonian King is riveting, and his brief screen appearances convey the power he had at his command. Oliver Reed plays the general who insists on opposing the Babylonians.
The locations chosen to shoot are spectacular, very believable. The sets and costumes are well done. Jeremiah is a very tough book to put on film, and I believe the filmmakers did a commendable job of making into a feature that would flow in a story fashion, while being mostly faithful to the text.  It is a movie after all, and all books translated to movies are changed, but nothing that offends in this case. Overall a very enjoyable story, an inspiring story of faith and perseverance.",1257984000,,1857,4.6871165644171775

Patrick Dempsey played Jeremiah and brought him to life for me on screen. He went through so much to follow what God had asked him to do, even though he was scared, even though he was timid. Dempsey brought him to life in just the manner needed.

The movie is one to watch if you don't know about this story. I think it's one that needs to be told far more often. Jeremiah tried to save the people of Israel and they failed to heed his warning, but were given a glimmer of hope that is fulfilled later on.",1232582400,,680,4.067164179104478

1359062,4,B00004VVOV,"Some lively direction and great performances bring some life to what could have been a bleak story.
Over 6 Centuries before Christ, Judah is revitalised when the ancient scrolls are discovered and the temple is restored.  The young Jeremiah is born into the order of the priesthood, and his faith and tradition become the cornerstone of his existence during this renaissance of sorts.  However, 16 years later the adult Jeremiah receives a Word from God that nobody wants to hear - that the sins and excesses of Judah are going to lead to the destruction of Jerusalem, and the people will be led into bondage.  Does he have the faith and strength to deliver the Word, facing ostracism from his family, tragic separation from the woman he loves, and persecution for treason?
Some license has been taken to add some characters and give some depth to Jeremiah's character - a tack which can lead movie versions of bible stories into rough water - however with Patrick Dempsey as Jeremiah, the effect here is to bring out a real sense of the humanity of the prophet, making the sense of sacrifice relevant and believable.  However, the gentle looking man does not flinch from forcefully speaking the Word when it is needed - watch out for the flying spittle!  The weak King Zedekiah is also well portrayed and a few starry cameos are welcome - Oliver Reed in fine form, and Klaus Maria Brandauer oddly believable as the Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar, despite that resolutely European accent.
The Bible series always seems to have tackled the subject of God speaking in a sensitive way, and the manner in which He speaks here is done very effectively, portraying how surreal and powerful the moment is while avoiding the `Booming American Voice clich of so many movies.  The scene in which Jeremiah first acts as God's voice piece is particularly well done.
Taking into account some crisp and colourful photography and reasonable production values given the TV budget, it's a valiant attempt at a rarely told story - of course, it's not as good as the book it's based on. (7/10)",1222041600,,2074,4.811797752808989

This is the last in a series of TV movies on various Old Testament books, and is probably the best of a great series.  There are several things that struck me about this movie that I would like to share with potential buyers.  First, and very importantly, this story sticks very close to the biblical text.  It is a `minimalist' retelling of Jeremiah, there is little or no denominational `spin' on this story.  It will be of interest to a wide range of Christian (and Jewish) believers.  Second, this movie is just filled with wonderfully inspirational Biblical messages.  The most fundamental is, of course, have faith in God, but this film examines issues of faith, submitting to God's will, and a host of others.  Truly thought provoking for any Christian.  Third, the acting, at least by the main characters, is quite well done.  Fourth, the sets are fantastic.  This was filmed I believe in Morocco, not in Jerusalem or anywhere else in Palestine, but the whole movie has a `Biblical' feel to it.  If I had any negative complaint about the film, it would be that the performances of many (most?) of the supporting actors and actress was poor.  They seemed stiff and not really interested in participating in the action.  A (very) minor quibble though.  A well written, well acted inspirational film that I highly recommend.",1160265600,3,1439,4.769230769230769

1359071,4,B00004VVOV,"This video is a pretty good video about Jeremiah. I've been wanting to get this video for awhile. I already had watched Joseph and Solomon which were pretty good videos too. I got this video along with Esther. Patrick Dempsey makes a great Jeremiah. Patrick Dempsy protrays Jeremiah as an ordinary man whom God calls to be a prophet. Klaus Maria something [I can't remember the guy's complete name.] plays Nebuchadnezzar who seems real mean! But that's the way probably Nebuchadnezzar is.  One major thing that I didn't like about this video is when God calls Jeremiah they used a little girl and an old man to protray God when He talks to Jeremiah. The story begins when Jeremiah was just a kid during Josiah's good reign and ends not long after the destruction of Jerusalem. There's unbiblical people in the movie such as Jeremiah's sweetheart Judith,General Sharpton,and maybe others. But I did like this video. It follows fairly close to scripture and is pretty entertaining with good actors. It is however not as good as some of the other Turner videos (such as Joseph, Solomon) but I found it better than esther. Have not had the opportunity yet to see Abraham, Moses, David. Jeremiah's words from the Bible are sparse in this video.",1083974400,12,1239,4.789719626168225
1359072,5,B00004VVOV,"This film is an excellent telling of Jeremiah's life, and although time has been compressed, and some fictitious characters added to fill out the scenario, the heart of this part of biblical history is intact, and follows the accounts given in The Book of Jeremiah, II Kings 23-25, and II Chronicles 34-36.
Some of the additions: The lovely ""Judith"" (Lenor Varela) as an early love interest, and ""General Safan"", played by that lionesque man, Oliver Reed, as one of Jeremiah's adversaries, and someone who consistently gives bad advice to the king.
Among the omissions: Jeremiah's good years, when he was a friend and confidant to the devout King Josiah, which ended in 609 B.C. with the Josiah's death.
Jeremiah was older when most of the events that take place in this film occur, and had been ministering since 627 B.C.
The film starts with the finding the scriptures, which King Josiah reads to the people, and a young Jeremiah, ""I cannot speak, for I am only a youth"" (Jer. 1:6).
Sixteen years elapse, and in some of the following scenes, Jehoiakim (Josiah's son) is king, and the constant and brutal persecution of Jeremiah begins.
Patrick Dempsey is wonderful as Jeremiah, and also Stuart Bunce as his faithful scribe Baruch (it is Baruch who in all probability recorded The Book of Jeremiah).
Enter Nebuchadnezzar, played with gusto by Klaus Maria Brandauer. This is one nasty guy, but he is the instrument to complete Jeremiah's prophesies, with his armies sacking and burning the temple (in 586 B.C.) and the ensuing famine in the land. Nebuchadnezzar takes Jehoiakim's son and succesor Jehoiachin captive, and and places his uncle Zedekiah (formerly known as Mattaniah) as king.
The final 10 minutes of this film are riveting, with King Zedekiah's fate brilliantly depicted (literaly taken from II Kings 25:7), and Jeremiah's story, though a sad one, is one of faith and perseverance, and well worth watching.
Most of the films in this series are terrific, and have beautiful cinematography by Raffaele Mertes; they are set in Quarzazate, Morocco, with its rugged landscape and ancient structures. A good score by Bruce Broughton adds to the atmosphere, and it's well directed and written (with a fair portion taken from the scriptures) by Harry Winer.",1078272000,82,2263,5.0212765957446805

Although I did not like the producers' inclusion of Jeremiah's supposed ""female"" friend....Above all, it was great! When you are through, check yourself and reflect on your life. Jeremiah was not a weeping prophet for nothing. The Lord spoke through him and warned the people. Do not become complacent and forget about it. Instead, open your Bible and read the whole book of Jeremiah. Learn a thing or two from it! ""God created people to be upright, but they have each turned to follow their own downward path.""

The entire story is biblically accurate and unlike most Bible stories told by Hollywood, does not try to make this a human interest story, but instead tells the story of what happens to nations who do not obey God's word.

If the other films are like this one, there is a bit of creative license.  The book in the Bible deals more with the prophecies from God that Jeremiah told the people of Israel.  We get very little about the man.  In the movie, however, the writers have given him more of a background.  They also provide him with a love interest, and we also see some of his childhood.  He also has a couple of helpers including a scribe and a eunuch.
Although I would rather they keep to the Bible, I don't think this background hurts the film.  Not every statement from the book of Jeremiah is listed in the movie, but this movie is enjoyable without taking away from the prophet.  I would simply remind myself that not all of this is found in the Bible.
I would recommend this movie.",1018569600,46,1004,4.383783783783784
1359076,5,B00004VVOV,"This film demonstrates the tremendous power movies have to inspire and instruct.  The production team of Jeremiah did an excellent job of taking a 52 chapter book of the Bible and condensing it accurately to film.  The dialogue is Scriptural, creative, and inspiring.  The acting is superb.  The sets, costumes, and effects are all realistic.  But what sets this film apart from other Biblical stories on film is that while some liberties were taken with characters and dialogue, they were both believable and in-line with Scripture.  One example ? The character of ""Judith"".  Basically, this young woman is the wife-to-be of Jeremiah.  They have a tender relationship, share some adventures together, but never marry.  Why ?  In the book of Jeremiah, God tells him that he will never marry because of the terrible wrath and destruction the Babylonian armies will bring upon Israel.  In creating this character, the writers make the audience feel the pain and devastation such an unction from God would bring--far more than if he had no romantic ties whatsoever.  But Judith represents even more.  In creating this character, the writers brought to life a living metaphor for all good and lovely things God wanted to give His people to enjoy in their lives--had they been faithful to His commandments.  Without this faithfulness to God, He could not bless them with all the good things He loves to bring upon His people.  This is just one example of a 'liberty' the writers took that, contrary to most uses of this, greatly enhanced the characters and enriched the story.  A definite ""must see"", for both Jew and Gentile.",997574400,48,1621,4.948148148148148

I could not turn off the subtitles for ""Gibby"".  I could turn on/off the subtitles for ""Jeremiah"" but both movies subtitles were displayed.  VERY ANNOYING.
I think the movie was done well but I way too distracted by the ""Gibby"" movie subtitles to be able to appreciate it.",1520640000,,440,4.407407407407407
