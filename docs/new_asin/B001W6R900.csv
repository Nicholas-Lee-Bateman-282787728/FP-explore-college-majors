8346992,5,B001W6R900,"Sadly while watching this discussion about the lowering of standards in our universities {circa 1970's standards} and Anthony Burgess prediction that it would feed upon itself leaving a world devoid of the Arts and populated by rule followers, who are now {circa 2016} controlling the world, he alouded to a cause factor unidentified in his time and still unidentified in our time. Could it be the Illuminati , and the new world order?

The sadness that overcame me was the loss of critical thinking among the current crop of college age students. The pedagogy of today, is target the bottom denominator and ignore the brilliant in order that everyone gets a college education. He points out that an IQ of 125 is or should be a minimal standard for pursuit of university level studies, although he quickly points out the limitations of the current IQ tests. He provides an interesting example, watch the show and learn. All in all none of what I listened to would have been possible without the brilliant mind of William S Bucklely Jr. : those days of television are gone replaced with name calling, insults, fistecufs, screaming, superficial judgement, materialism, uninspired rhetoric, an abundance of opinionated beliefs derived from emotional bias devoid of examination by critical thinking.

I realise that I have a very negative view and that saddens me.",1471824000,,1360,5.04

8346994,5,B001W6R900,"Burgess is gold here - he only appears vulnerable when he allows.  Somehow, through Buckley's elitist and racist maxims, Burgess manages with ease to come through as a viciously, frighteningly, original mind, with large portends for the future, i.e now.  His last line, ""I see no difference between the corporate and the personal,"" should ring true.  And what other reviewers call his ""self doubt"" or ""timidness"" is only his refusal to stoop to the level of Buckley and his fellow crooning, impotent intellectuals.  They are all out to make him submit to their generalities and he cannot, will not.  He is too subtle for them, too human.  It's like comparing James Joyce to H.R. Haggard.  Haggard was entertaining, yes.  Joyce was true; at least as much as he could be.  Joyce, like Burgess, preferred a dank, rugged, ordinary Dublin alley to a moist African rainforest of Kenyan tribesman worshipping their white saviors.  Buckley would of course fantasize about inhabiting that savior role - because it allows him the whip occasionally.  Burgess would prefer the alleyway, and not mind the strike of a whip, occasionally.  Buckley, like those he courted, are high-born weaklings, with no regard for genuine human experience and subtlety.  Burgess rings true, like a prophet, like a human who we can undoubtedly see would enjoy the subtleties of the whip.",1397520000,,1356,5.054054054054054
8346995,5,B001W6R900,"I am just a little bit too young to have sought this out when it first aired, but became a fan of Burgess as well as Buckley around this time.  It is such a pleasure to hear the fencing between the two, free of our contemporary tendency toward stridency as a first line of polemic. Burgess is too reluctant to defend his own opinions, seeming to want to avoid alienating his students any more than necessary, and Buckley does an excellent job of trying to provoke him into defending his own position.  Burgess' prescience in predicting the collapse of humanities education, the decline of American English, and the rise of a technocratic oligarchy is astonishing.
 If you enjoy hearing well-stocked minds feint and dart while considering contemporary issues (issues still relevant today) you will probably enjoy this.",1396483200,2,817,4.9489051094890515
8346996,5,B001W6R900,"Buckley once again demonstrates his incisive wit. Burgess is a prescient anticipator of the decline in university education in the states. If the inflation was a problem then, it has ballooned now.",1392508800,,197,5.1875
8346997,4,B001W6R900,The debate centers around the non-conformist Burgess.  The items discussed include upper education including who should be allowed to pursue such studies and why.  Burgess seems to try and remain ellusive on certain topics but Buckley pursues these ideas.  It is an interesting discussion throughout.,1362355200,,300,5.622222222222222
8346998,5,B001W6R900,"Will somebody please come out here and clean up the dead bodies this mfs are delivering. Bon Mot this, bitch. In the camp dialectic of Buckley oeuvre, sit back and absorb the lobs of these wonks. Do not work at this. If you are reading this, then you probably understand. Welcome brother and occasional sister. Dip into this fat and feel the read.",1358380800,2,347,4.523809523809524
8346999,3,B001W6R900,"Don't expect too much of this interview (if looking for material on Burgess). It's just a mono thematic interview over a manifesto Burgess wrote and the controversy followed. Funny at parts, serious till boredom at others and just it.
Bill Buckley seems not altogether impartial at his role at times (though Burgess is to blame most of the time). But it seems Buckley later became friend and developed a high esteem for Burgess and his work.",1284249600,5,441,4.815789473684211
