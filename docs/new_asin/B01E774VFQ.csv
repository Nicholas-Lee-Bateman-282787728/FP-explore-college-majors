8757913,3,B01E774VFQ,"Joshua Kennedy is a creative and promising young filmmaker who took his opportunities at Pace University to make these two films on location at school. I believe that I have seen all of Kennedy's films, and while my favorite is still ""The Attack of the Octopus People"", all offer interesting twists on a variety of monster movie tropes. In this double feature even though ""The Night of the Medusa"" gets top billing, I much preferred ""Slave Girls on the Moon"".

""The Night of the Medusa"" was, for me, 66 minutes of tedium and boredom. I literally could not wait for this to be over; mercifully it is paired with a much more interesting and amusing film allowing the set to get a three star rating overall. The film opens with lots of inappropriate organ music and the worst college admission office scene imaginable as Elaine (Haley Zega) tries to iron out her schedule since she's a transfer student just off the plane from Greece. (Yeah, right.) Elaine's new roommate Courtney (Carmen Vienhage, who appears in both these films) is the horrible, unsympathetic sorority girl that you're supposed to hate and you will.

I won't go through the whole plot (though I doubt much will surprise astute viewers) but will say that the love interest and betrayal subplot works fairly well, while the sleepwalking around the dorm and the plodding pace do not. As usual, Kennedy has a leading role in his own films and here he plays Count Saknussemm. To his credit, his performance is the best in the film. You see the Count lives in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (!), which happens to contain a statue of Medusa. There is a long student report on the myth of Perseus and Medusa, and an epic catfight in the dorm room that you knew with certainty was coming. The special effects of the Medusa snakes are laughable at best, not that I need ILM to provide effects to enjoy a sci-fi movie. Courtney is summoned to the museum to do a photo shoot for the Count, and he doesn't speak. This scene reinforces the impression of Kennedy as the best actor in the film and also reinforces the impression that Vienhage is the worst. What are the odds that there's a revenge of the Medusa scene? I think you know the answer, and while it is a fairly delicious bit of action, the hilariously unconvincing lecture on Mayan civilization is a counterbalance (note the instructional dry erase board). Of course in the end justice is done and the film ends in the exact way you knew it would ever since Elaine fell in love. That this film is an homage to ""The Gorgon"" is evident, and I actually do admire seeing Kennedy put his spin on older genres; having said that, the cast in this film was grating and the pacing was slow as molasses.

""Slave Girls on the Moon"" makes up for what ""The Night of the Medusa"" squandered: it's a rarity for Kennedy in that it's not a direct homage to a specific horror genre, rather it's a fairly conventional outer space sci-fi adventure filmed on the moonI mean at Pace University. This film has even worse special effects (and more of them) than ""The Night of the Medusa"", but it's an upbeat, fun good versus evil story that I rather enjoyed in spite of the cheap production values. Opening with a hilarious space battle (and ridiculous stilted dialogue like ""there's no escape earthling!""), the action quickly shifts to a penitentiary castle on the moon (!) run by Kennedy wearing a space monocle. By far my favorite plot device and effect is the colander that releases electric ""security bubbles"" (obviously this made me think of Ro-Man from ""Robot Monster""). This is such a delicious moment I rewound and watched it several times.

Chloe (Madelyn Wiley) is the attractive space heroine who is wrongly taken prisoner after time traveling to the year 8888. The premise is a bit complicated but it doesn't matter that much...you see Chloe is a nuclear scientist who has gone to 8888 in search of another nuclear scientist, Genevieve (Devin Dunne) who is stranded there. What are the odds they get assigned to the same jail cell? What are the odds they don't recognize each other and immediately begin wrestling? I think you know. You also might be interested in the tentacled moon monster that makes Ed Wood's octopus look realistic, and in another nod to Wood, ""Lobo"", the warden's chief of security who has the strength of five men.

The film is a comedic and campy ride that's fun even when your eyes involuntarily roll back in your head. The worst scene may be the terrible hand to hand combat, futuristic paintball, and bullwhip encounter in a Pace University stairwell. The female prisoners all convince the warden to let them have a talent show which will be a distraction during their escape. This is the worst talent show ever (and that's actually intentional), but I loved the staring demonstration and the yoga diversion while the pod bay doors were opened. (Thanks, ""2001"".) Much of this was clearly filmed in a public room at school (I think Kennedy said in the commentary it was the Student Union), but it's still more imaginative than many Hollywood movies I have seen. I did like the climactic scene which involves eating the blue bread of doom, fighting showering prisoners, paralysis, hilarious advanced codebreaking, and of course an assault with a pineapple. No really, the pineapple lasso is nothing to laugh at! OK, maybe it is. I love that the protagonists escape in a spaceship made of tile and aluminum foil (I guess it was filmed in a shower?) as the castle explodes. I will not reveal how the film ends, other than to say it resolves a common sci-fi conspiracy theory to good effect after flying directly above Pace University!

Kennedy recorded commentaries for both of these films and they are included on the DVD. He's actually more insightful and interesting than you might expect for his age, and despite the amateurish quality of these films, I think they are interesting and that he will flourish in cinema in the future.",1480809600,4,5959,4.7085330776605945

8757916,5,B01E774VFQ,"With this DVD, I have seen every movie that Joshua Kennedy has released. I first learned of him when I was going over the nominees for the Rondo Awards (after casting a vote for Chris Mihm's entry, because he's a friend of mine). Several movies and short films caught my eye to follow up on later. When I watched Mr. Kennedy's entry, I was instantly hooked and set out to collect everything that he had either posted on YouTube or released on DVD. There hasn't been a single one that I haven't loved, including Night of the Medusa. This is another homage to Hammer Films (the other was Dracula A.D. 2015) and it's a beauty. What's interesting about watching these movies is that you can see the amazing development of the filmmaker's skills, since the earliest were made when he was a teenager (yeah, he's a prodigy).  The first few were rather crude-- and I don't mean that to their detriment at all, as they were just as enjoyable-- and the latest several have been just as good as Chris Mihm's movies, if not as well funded.  I recommend this movie, and all of the Joshua Kennedy filmography. And if this guy ever does a Kickstarter, I am there.",1468800000,2,1148,4.488038277511961
8757917,5,B01E774VFQ,"Two really fun, really low-budget films from young filmmaker Joshua Kennedy -- who will graduate college in late 2016.  Yep, he's still in school, and he's already had a fistful of films out on DVD.  And they're all fun.  Joshua wears his influences on his sleeve.  Night of the Medusa is a tribute to Hammer's The Gorgon.  Slave Girls on the Moon mashes up prison stories and 50s SciFi films.  Don't go into these expecting slick, Hollywood productions.  Go into them expecting production values and acting talents whose reach sometimes exceeds their grasp.  These flicks, or the Vesuvius Xperiment are a good intro to this promising young filmmaker's work.  I can hardly wait to see what he does next -- and what he might do with a professional cast, crew and budget.",1467244800,,769,4.765151515151516
8757918,5,B01E774VFQ,"I can't help but praise Joshua Kennedy's filmmaking finesse, especially the loving manner in which he recaptures the Gothic essence of Hammer Studios. He did a marvelous job in his homage, ""Dracula A.D. 2015"" and flavored his science-fiction opus, ""The Vesuvius Xperiment"" with many of the studio's finest traits.

Now, Gooey Film Productions brings us Kennedy's ""The Night of Medusa"": a heartfelt homage to Hammer's atmospheric classic, ""The Gorgon"". The latter is a Kennedy favorite, but instead of merely rehashing a film he holds near to his heart, he's distinguished his tribute with spellbinding friction and ample angst. The story focuses on a Greek exchange student, Elaine Carlisle (Haley Zega), who upon entering prestigious Pace University encounters unfounded disdain from her roommate, the snooty Courtney Ambrose (Carmen Vienhage), who has no idea that the meek Carlisle is the reincarnation of the dreaded Medusa, but then neither does Carlisle know such...at least not at first.

Before long, Carlisle experiences a series of weird, sleepwalking sessions and ultimately returns to her deadly roots to attain revenge, but she's not alone upon her terrifying trail. The mysterious and mystically stationed Count Saknussemm (played by none other than Kennedy) guides her along the maddening stretch of discovery.

Zega and Vienhage are perfectly cast, staging their opposing roles with passion and conviction. Of course, Kennedy's script is a strong foundation upon which their performances can grow.

Kennedy, in particular, makes a strong impression as Saknussemm, administering the right commanding tone and highbrow posture. Through an ominous, mostly mute persona, he channels Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, but also one might argue, enlists the distinct, menacing panache of Vincent Price and Michael Gough. (For further proof of Kennedy's villainous projection, check out ""Vesuvius"".)

The rest of ""Medusa'""s cast, which includes Jonathan Danziger; Nick Ries; Madison Reiske; Traci Thomas; and Liam Wildes, is also believable in its varying roles; Femforce contributor Mark Holmes even cameos as a security guard. (BTW, the stately Metropolitan Museum of Art acts as a major backdrop in the film, adding to the eerie air of scholarly sophistication.)

I've already watched the film twice in one sitting and have a hankering to leap in again, but I suppose the same enthralling quality can be found in any Kennedy endeavor, including ""Medusa'""s joyful DVD accompaniment, ""Slave Girls on the Moon"": a science-fiction spoof, which also serves as a companion piece to Kennedy's equally tongue-in-cheek ""Voyage to the Planet of Teenage Cavewomen"".

In ""Slave Girls"", we learn that nuclear scientist Genevieve Fonda (Devin Dunne) has bolted through time to the year 8888, where she's imprisoned in the moon-based Bestwick Penitentiary.

Fonda is tracked by her assistant, Chloe Trustcott (Madelyn Wiley), but when she, too, is captured, the duo plans an escape with fellow prisoner Mai-Ling (Tomi Heady), a combat-skilled (and later peg-legged) rebel. (Incidentally, ""Medusa'""s Vienhage also plays one of the inmates, in this instance supplying an effective comedic tone.) To ensure success, the gals decide to throw a talent show to distract their sadistic warden (the brilliantly expressive Kennedy) and his ""Invaders from Mars""/""Man from Planet X""-ish henchman, Lobo (the joyfully lustful Jeremy Kreuzer). From there, the crazy hi jinks spread like wildfire, nicely capped by yet another Holmes appearance.

""Slave Girls"" is a loving, nostalgic homage to space operas ranging from ""Buck Rogers"" to ""Barbarella"" (sprinkled with a dash of Stanley Kubrick, Jules Verne, and a generous heaping of Edward D. Wood, Jr.), but even more so, the adventure acknowledges the women-in-prison genre, popular during the '70s drive-in scene. The film's crossover elements blend remarkably well, so much so that they won Kennedy ""Best Comedy"" at the 2016 Miami International Science Fiction Film Festival Awards.

Don't deprive yourself of the fun; order this dandy, Kennedy double feature today!",1464393600,2,4101,5.5472
