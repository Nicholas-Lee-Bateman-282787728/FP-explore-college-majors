2226603,4,B0007P0Y2W,"Didn't expect too much on basis of other reviews. Am a big Sir Ian fan,and while confused at times due to time shifting,was quite pleased with this movie. Emile reconnects with his niece,and meets his grandniece on a visit to accept an honorary degree. He didn't step in when his niece was orphaned,and she bears resentment for that,but being a parent herself(when Emile arrives for visit) should've understood that her parents didn't appoint him guardian in case of emergency,and he lived in England.",1409356800,4,501,5.048192771084337
2226604,3,B0007P0Y2W,"Ehh! This film from British Columbia is pretty pedestrian. It is a drudging 93 minutes of characters caught in regret and anger about the past.
Ian McKellen gives his usually well calculated performance, but there really is not much with which to work here. The script,director and cameraman are one in the same in Carl Bessai,and there lacks much vision and insight into how to make this film interesting. It is not...so there.
Emile,McKellen,has flown rural Canada 40 years earlier for a promising career as a writer in London. He leaves behind his two brothers,Carl, who is the irascible elder and Freddy the dreamy and needy younger.
Flash forward 40 years to the present, and Emile is returning to the niece and great-niece that is all the remains of his family. He actually is coming back to Canada to receive a honorary degree. When he arrives, he is greeted with nonchalance and ambivilance that is disguised as anger. We discover that the grown niece had been orphaned and that Emile was the only one who could have been her protector. She is now divorced and has a young daughter who also yearns for what is lost. The film asks us to examine what responsibility a family member should have or feel for those who remain behind when one goes away to seek their fortune. Are they at all responsible for people and events that are 7000 miles away? What could they or should they have done? These are viable questions, but this film really does little to interest you in any of the plight of the characters. Not recommended at all.",1194393600,2,1536,4.671586715867159
2226605,4,B0007P0Y2W,"""Emile"" is a quiet little film with echoes of ""Goodbye Mr. Chips"", and ""Wild Strawberries"" and perhaps a bit of  Eugene O'Neill.  The title character, played by Ian McKellen,  is a dignified old professor who returns to his native Canada from England to receive an honorary degree.  He uses the opportunity to reconnect with his niece Nadia and her daughter in Vancouver, who are his only remaining relatives.

McKellen gives an exemplary performance playing an old man who is forced to come to terms with the ghosts of his past.  Emile was the fortunate brother who escaped a hardscrabble farm by winning a scholarship to study in England.  Many decades later on returning to Canada,  he painfully revisits his past,  dreaming of both brothers.  Brother Carl is muscular and cruel, brother Fred is gentle, reflective and possibly a more deserving talent as a writer than Emile---which has left some guilty scars on the old man.

Further weighing on Emile's conscience is his failure to protect and care for Carl's child  Nadia after her parents are killed in an accident.

There is some awkwardness in the structure of this film.  When McKellen's character revisits his past, he is shown as an old man with his youthful brothers, which can cause the viewer some confusion.  Plus the young actress who plays Emile's grand niece in the present day also portrays her mother as a girl in the orphanage flashbacks.  But McKellen turns in a sterling performance, and the other actors are all excellent as well.  For people who now and then enjoy a small film filled with subtle nuances , this should fit the bill.",1168819200,33,1608,4.831501831501831
2226606,3,B0007P0Y2W,"Emile is one of those films I really wanted to work well. The casting is first notch, from Sir Ian McKellen (in the title role), Deborah Cara Unger (his niece Nadia), Theo Crane (Maria, Nadia's daughter), Chris Martin (Carl, one late brother), Tygh Runyan (Freddy, another late brother), to Ian Tracy (Tom the repairman).

The movie relies heavily on flashbacks, which occur all too often. When these happen, the action stops and McKellen's face freezes. He appears as an his older self but wears clothes of the past, sometimes talking to characters (who respond to him) other times passively observing. In some flashbacks, he is present at events which we now know happened when he was out of the country. The last flashback in the movie is the least plausible, as it happens when McKellen is in the middle of giving an acceptance speech for an honourary degree! Better material for a nightmare, perhaps; there was a good dream sequence early in the movie.

The interaction between McKellen and Unger is first-rate, moving from the ""hostility"" type of hospitality, through confrontation, sadness, acceptance and finally mutual recognition. Though we aren't presented with a complete account of what happened all those years ago, by the end everyone has got closer to each other yet evidently maintains their own lives and independence. Aside from the niece and daughter (and dead relatives) the only other character who contributes significantly is the hunk-in-the-rough repairman: is it mere coincidence that once he starts working on the house, the main characters draw closer?

All said, the camera work is excellent; this film really ""gets"" Victoria, an enigmatic city on Vancouver Island loved for its beauty yet reviled for its boredom. As with the flashbacks, the score by Vincent Mai is repetitous at times and could have illustrated the flashbacks more effectively.",1148601600,6,1875,5.140983606557377
2226607,2,B0007P0Y2W,"The plot: Emile, an elderly professor, travels from London to Victoria, British Columbia to receive an honorary degree. While there he stays with his niece Nadia, whom he has not seen since she was a little girl, in the ramshackle old family farm house which his brothers used to live in before their deaths long ago.

Nadia, who was left an orphan as a young child, has recently divorced, and has a 10-year old daughter, Maria, who is bratty and disturbed over the recent breakup of her parents.

The story unfolds in flashbacks, and in Emile's cross-dimensional conversations with his brothers Carl and Freddy. These forays into the unpleasant past are filled with deep regret and sins of omission, permeated with hatred and envy, and simple lack of caring.

Maria to Emile: ""What's the hardest thing about getting old ?"". Emile: ""All those things you haven't managed to do"".

Though the film tries to have a satisfactory resolution, it somehow doesn't really ring true, because the seeds of despair have been planted too deep.

Written, directed and photographed by Carl Bessai, the acting is good, with Ian McKellen heading the cast as Emile. Others are Deborah Cara Unger as Nadia, Theo Crane as Maria (and Nadia age 10), Chris Martin as Carl, Tygh Runyan as Freddy, and Ian Tracy as Tom the repairman.

A nice mellow score by Vincent Mai (who also plays on keyboards and trumpet), and lovely cinematography of the B.C. coastline alleviate some of the gloom.

Total running time is 95 minutes.",1118361600,4,1498,4.850980392156862

2226658,4,B0007P0Y2W,"McKellen's performance gradually reveals the nagging grief of promises forgotten and relationships abandoned. One's choice of a career can become a fixation that costs the sensitive development of family relationships and losses of intimacy. As so often happens, one's brilliance in a given discipline can harden the heart and amputate emotional growth. Tragically, much of life can pass by in voluntary estrangement, especially when a narcissistic outlook suffocates holistic development. Ironically, the central character returns home for an ""honorary"" degree in science, and an ""F"" in sanctification. Emile's epiphany occurs late in life, but thankfully a reunion of sorts does occur. For many, unfortunately, self analysis never manifests. Emile's inner self surfaces at last and a rejected past is somewhat embraced. Just as his self-analysis is painfully slow and startling, the plot is cleverly maneuvered between numerous flashbacks that serve as exposition. McKellen achieves a degree of awareness that is admirable.",1461715200,,1025,5.7947019867549665

2226666,2,B0007P0Y2W,"Unfortunately, this low budget film only had enough money to spend on getting Ian McKellan to come be in it. He must have owed someone a favor. Deborah Unger is wooden and her foul-mouthed, bitter lines are delivered so unconvincingly as to make one suspect she has a lot of other things on her mind than her job on the set of this movie - just a hollow performance. Still, the girl is terrific as the kid who pulls the whole thing together, which is the formulaic intention of the writer of this film, everyone rallies around kids in the end! Hurray! The low budget also forced the use of the same characters for all the flashback characters, layering the bad acting of one character in one time frame over others and reinforcing everyone's dreary performances and causing confusion and painstaking, agonizing endurance of long, slow shots of pensive, silent, meaning-filled moments that did not add to the story, and took lots of time doing so.

I enjoyed this movie and find the lack of brutality, so common in American-made movies, along with over the top sensationalism, car chases, explosions, gratuitous sex scenes, and offensive language (all posing as ""reality"") refreshingly preferable--along with the idea, disappearing from the American movie production industry, that Art actually gives people something to think about, while flashy drivel gives people something to waste their time with.",1441756800,,916,5.072847682119205

2226839,4,B0007P0Y2W,"Emile is a single senior without immediate family whose life has been filled with other people's tragedy's, which we are led to believe meant little to him as they were happening. As the story unfolds we learn Emile, a present day professor in a British University, was born and raised on a farm in the midwest of Canada with two brothers forty years before. The younger one has a man crush on Emile and the older one has a streak of sadism in his character. Emile, to the great distress of the younger brother, goes to England for college, never returns and never writes. He just leaves and is never heard from again. The younger brother, we learn in a series of flashbacks, commits suicide after missing Emile and being mistreated by the sadistic brother. That brother has a daughter who becomes orphaned when her mother and father die in a car crash and the maternal grandmother dies, in an unusual twist for this movie, naturally. It is the daughter, as an adult who Emile comes to visit in Canada which he is returning to for the purpose of receiving an honorary degree. The daughter has her own pre teen daughter and just got separated from her husband. She is sullen, angry and loveless. As the movie progresses we learn that not only did Emile leave a brother who had a great dependence on him and never bothered to communicate again but also that when his niece was orphaned not only did he refuse, as her only remaining family, to save her from an institutional childhood but that at one point did return to Canada, went to the orphanage and didn't even visit the child. He was just checking up on what her surroundings were like. He tells the director of the orphanage who reasonably believes he is there to arrange to take custody of the young child that of course he can't because single parent households aren't allowed "" on his campus "". Emile an old man is facing his mortality. There is little ahead and a lot behind. His life has been 95% lived and what does he have to show for it. Not much. When given the opportunity to help his brother and his niece he demurred. He has no significant other, no children, and no one who depends on him. There is no footprint there. Notwithstanding his total self absorption we are led to believe at the end of the movie that there is a possible life to be finished in the company of his niece and grand niece, a sort off redemption even for someone as uncaring and selfish as him. The best part of the movie was the acting and the fact the writers didn't try to make Emile into something he wasn't. He was presented as a somewhat mild person who was bothered by what had happened in his life but not too much so. If he was filled with guilt for letting people down it didn't show too much. Since the main theme of the movie is the introspection which occurs in the minds of people whose lives have been almost completely lived I don't know if anyone under 50 would find the movie that interesting.",1432080000,12,2952,4.428308823529412

2226861,1,B0007P0Y2W,"We found it quite tedious. The other actors are not at all up to Sir Ian; so it is woefully  tipped.  The script is very thin indeed.  He is too good an actor not to be engaged, even 'tho he could have sleep-walked the role and still been better than the material.  But even his skill can't rescue it.  The plot is so undeveloped, not in any way specific (and therefore not universal)  so repetitive  (with images in a dream/memory sequence, which don't add any information to the story, & create confusion abut what is happening, or happened & when;  ex: he is his current age & the siblings appear younger; takes a while to discern what is meant to be going on & when) .  Because it was written & directed by the same man, who is unknown to me, and after whom the oldest brother is named--an autobiography/vanity project? --you get the sense this is an early work for this person; it is like film school product.  The 'frail human makes life mistakes, retires, reviews his life, seemingly tries to go back to make some things right' sort of archetype--but then nothing ever really happens in the story.  Yet he seems to have an 'epiphany'--evidenced only  by the words in the final speech, not by his own action or plot workings --again, like film school stuff.

Being a member of a family means having responsibility as well. This movie is about a truly useless human being. I honestly believed under the academic exterior was at least a flicker of a human being. For this reason I watched the entire movie.
