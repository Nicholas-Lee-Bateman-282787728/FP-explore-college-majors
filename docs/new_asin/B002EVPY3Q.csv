Just be advised that this is a lot less ""polished"" than the documentary Comic Con Episode IV: A Fan's Hope...which we also loved. It's best not compare the 2 documentaries because they are so different. This doc delved deeper into the vendor/cosplay side of comic con. We have a couple of new people coming to Comic Con with us this year so it was great to show them the grittier side to the convention as well. Like the other reviewers said the interviews are hit and miss, but my friends and I really enjoyed the interviews with the guys over at Bare Bones Studios....mostly Carlos.

But I agree...this might be better for those who are hardcore into Comic Con...rather then people who are just mildly curious about the convention. For those beginners I'd recommend A Fan's Hope.

Hopefully there will be a Crashing the Con 09, 10, or 11 coming out soon. Or maybe we'll see the guys filming at this years convention.

8368344,5,B002EVPY3Q,"Great coverage of what goes on behind the scenes of this increasingly popular event. For those who are die-hard followers of this unique culture, or for those who have never attended a Comic Con, I found this DVD to be interesting, rewarding and entertaining.

I particularly like the in depth segment interview with Ol' Dirty Boba Phat, aka Pimp Boba Fett who has been proclaimed one of the most favored cosplayers by both media sources & fans alike. Always a treat to see him at these events, and even better to hear him speak openly about his fascination with Comic Con.

Can we expect a Crashing the Con '09?",1260489600,2,612,4.605504587155964
8368345,5,B002EVPY3Q,"i enoyed this DVD thoroughly!  as a Comic Con attendee for the past 9 years I really got a feel for some of the personalities(myself included) that make the con a must see for me every year.  To be honest I think anyone interested in ""mega-events"" would enjoy this as it puts into perspective some of the people who live in the fringe groups as closet nerds and hardcore fans and allows us a glimpse into their world even if for just the briefest of moments.  flush with funny stories, anecdotes, and nonsense this is a must have for anyone who has ever attended(or considered attending) a sci-fi, comic book, horror, fantasy, star trek, doctor who, anime, manga, et al convention...

8368346,5,B002EVPY3Q,"Though this video isn't perfect for everyone, it's great for those that want to remember or relive what comic-con '08 was like.

The majority of the video consists of interviews with both attendees and booth runners. Though a couple interviews come out a little flat, there's some wonderful ones in there. The Troma (did a pile of B grade cult classics like ""Toxic Avenger"")  interview is particularly good.",1248220800,2,407,4.970588235294118
8368347,5,B002EVPY3Q,"They do a great job of capturing the chaos and the fun of San Diego Comic Con, and showing the personalities that make it all work.

Or, not work.",1247529600,2,146,4.0344827586206895
