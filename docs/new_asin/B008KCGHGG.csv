8602570,4,B008KCGHGG,I got to enjoy this movie tonight as my special treat. Vivien Leigh was beautiful and I think she did a very good acting job in this movie. I was impressed. The court room scenes were very interesting to me. I also thought that Lawrence Olivier did a superb job as well. The ending was a surprise. I also enjoyed the carnival scenes especially when they were on the roller coasters. All of the actors were interesting to me and I would recommend this movie to anyone who is planning a movie night and likes these older movies. I know that I do.,1442707200,3,544,4.29126213592233
8602571,1,B008KCGHGG,"Having problems with this DVD.  My DVD player which is fairly new is unable to read the disk.  I guess the NON-USA Format is not for the US players, buyer beware.  So I am out of luck and wasted my money.  Plus the fact I have never seen this film.",1357430400,,248,3.9
