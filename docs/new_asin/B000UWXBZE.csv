Why is it so hard to find? Why is it only available in Latin America at $40 a pop, but nowhere else?",1305849600,,256,3.759259259259259

Anyway,on to the review.  This DVD version of John Hannah's 2002 film is only available as a Latin America Import.  The DVD release is not some kind of bootleg, and it plays fine in my Region 1 DVD player.  There are absolutely NO extras on this film, not even a trailer or a text-based bio of any of the cast.  Good thing there's at least a menu with chapter stops.  As for the quality of the image, it's a beautiful and clear looking widescreen image(no fullscreen version is offered).

This might not be the ""Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde"" adaptation that most people are familiar with, but I would encourage people to give this film a chance.",1282262400,,718,4.345864661654136
