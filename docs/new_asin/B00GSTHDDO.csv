6109348,3,B00GSTHDDO,"This was the last PPV the WWE produced before rolling out the WWE Network, so this could be looked at as the last of an era for wrestling as the WWE moved away from the traditional PPV model that had been around since 1985. Elimination Chamber featured seven matches, though it was obvious that only two of them were of any real importance.

Not Worth Watching: the Uso brothers and New Age Outlaws fought over the tag team titles in a mediocre match, Titus O'Neil and Darren Young blew off their break up feud in an uninspired encounter, AJ Lee defended her Divas Title in a non-match, and Batista took on Alberto Del Rio in a woeful match where the result was never in question.

Worth Watching: Jack Swagger gave Big E his best match yet in their opener for the Intercontinental Title and the Elimination Chamber main event was a solid bout that showcased all the participants involved. Cesaro was impressive and seeds were planted for a number of major feuds and events going forward.

Match of the Night: Fans already though the Shield vs. the Wyatt Family was a show stealer before the match even started. As far as six man matches go, this one was excellent, top tier stuff. Seth Rollins and Luke Harper were  co-MVPs as they both were looking to earn a secure spot on the roster once their respective teams split. A match of the year candidate to be sure.

While there were three good-to-amazing matches on the show, the rest of the card was especially weak. It's a good show, but I can't fathom the six-man getting left off compilations in the future, so this is a rental.",1406419200,,1581,4.533333333333333

ELIMINATION CHAMBER 2014

1.[I-C TITLE]BIG E VS JACK SWAGGER-this was actually a great match between these two. It was a hard hitting affair that would see each man take control at different times. Both used some power moves trying to end the other quickly and painfully. It looked as if a new I-C champion would be crowned when Swagger locked in the ankle lock but a counter would end his night and Big E would retain.

2.[TAG TITLES]THE NEW AGE OUTLAWZ VS THE USOS-I have loved the comeback by the Outlawz as they are one of my favorite tag teams of all time. This was a good match between these two very different teams. The Usos kept things at a fast pace when in control and were displaying those high risk moves that fans love. But the veterans would slow things down and work the youngens over. Things would pick back towards the end of the match and in all the mix Billy Gun would pick up the win with a roll up. Good tag match between these teams.

3. DARREN YOUNG VS TITUS ONEAL-the two former tag partners known as the Primetime Players go to battle here. Titus uses his power to his advantage working Young over but Young would battle back making it a back and forth contest. Good solid match between the two in which Titus picks up the win.

4. THE SHIELD VS THE WYATT FAMILY-the match everyone was waiting for and that very much includes me as well. This was the best match of the night for sure as these two teams went to war and I mean war. This match was so good the fans were chanting this is awesome BEFORE the six men even touched each other before the match even started. The crowd was so into this one chanting and cheering for both teams and all six men showed why. This was a fight and felt epic especially after the match got going. Some men were brawling while other went flying, it was an insane fun match. There moves from men we had never seen and even a Shield member going through a table instead of the other way around. I loved both teams so I was going to be happy either way because I knew these guys would steal the show. After brawling into the crowd and all around ringside the Wyatts would single out Reigns to pick up the win. The rematch on Raw was just as great, love all of these guys.

5.[DIVAS TITLE]AJ LEE VS CAMERON-well not only are Divas matches usually average this match had the horrible timing of following up the Shield versus Wyatts classic. So naturally the match wasn't that long with AJ actually losing by DQ which kinda surprised me.

6. BATISTA VS ALBERTO DEL RIO-this match surprisingly would see Del Rio control most of the match. Batista would come back at various times but Del Rio thanks to an early attack prior to the match would work him over. Still the Animal would pick up the win with a Batista bomb, I am still not sure why everyone was hating on him.

7.[WWE TITLE ELIMINATION CHAMBER MATCH]RANDY ORTON VS DANIEL BRYAN VS JOHN CENA VS SHEAMUS VS CHRISTIAN VS CESARO-these matches no matter what are always fun, how could it not be. Sure they may not be technical master pieces but the brawling is always cool.

BONUS

1. GOLDUST & CODY RHODES VS RYBACK AND CURTIS AXEL-the night started out with this tag match and it was a good one. The Rhodes brothers have been great team and Axel & Ryback have been an interesting duo. This was a good back and forth contest that would see the brothers look like the better team over all. Still Axel and Ryback  with Axels grandfather at ringside would use their power to ground the brothers at times. In the end the Rhodes brothers pick up the victory.

You also get Zeb and the Real Americans, the Wyatt family, and Randy Orton interviews as bonus features. This was a good event that had some good matches on it, very enteraining.",1398297600,2,3746,4.3755395683453235
6109353,4,B00GSTHDDO,"The IC title match between Big E Langton & Jack Swagger was solid. The Tag Team title match between The New Age Outlaws(Road Dog Jesse James & Billy Gunn) against The Usos(Jimmy & Jey) was slow at first but picked up later. Translation: It was just fine. The Darren Young-Titus O'Neil match was not very good at all. The 6 man Tag Team match between The Shield & The Wyatt Family was a whole bag of awesome with a big time feel to boot. The Divas title match between AJ Lee & Cameron was a dud. The Batista-Alberto Del Rio match was too long for its good and it was on for 9 minutes. The Elimination Chamber match for the WWE Worlds title(Randy Orton vs John Cena vs Daniel Bryan vs Antonio Cesaro vs Sheamus vs Christian) was a hard-hitting,smash-mouth brawl even with the overbooked ending. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10.",1395878400,2,823,4.316129032258065
6109354,3,B00GSTHDDO,"Intercontinental Champion Big E. vs. Jack Swagger - Big E. took control with power offense causing Swagger to go to the outside in an attempt to break up his momentum which didn't work as Big E. used the ringside environment to his advantage causing a busted lip but Swagger was able to retake control with some power offense of his own while also keeping Big E. grounded as both men went back & forth taking & giving some hard hits such as a spinebuster, spearing his body through the ropes & his opponent off the apron taking both men to the floor, and a top rope release side suplex.  This was a good physical match & definitely the best showing on a PPV event in a long time from both men.

Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws vs. The Usos - The Usos used their quick offense to dominate the early moments including repeated armdrag takeovers on both men while also having fun at Road Dogg's expense before their offense was used against them allowing the Outlaws to slow down the pace singling out one member of the team & working him over.  The match was solid with both teams working different paces & strategies against each other.

Darren Young vs. Titus O'Neal - The former Primetime Players battle it out here with Titus showing his power advantage early on only for Young to take the fight right to Titus including coming off the top rope & even a move out of the old Cactus Jack playbook with Titus still relying on his power to heavily work over Young's back including a hard whip in the corner that sent Young over the top to the floor & using the outside ring post to his advantage with Young continuing to still fight including delivering an impactful move on the apron of the ring.  I'll give these two credit in that they tried to work a good match here & played it out like the grudge match it was built to be but it was a case where the crowd just didn't care & make it clear who they would have rather seen with their chants.

The Shield vs. The Wyatt Family - Both teams had the same strategy in the beginning in that they isolated one member of the group working him over in their corner with their teammates making quick tags & having no problem taking their shots in on the apron with members of each team delivering offense that we haven't seen from them previously such as Luke Harper's dropkick & suicide dive along with Seth Rollings series of aerial offense that made the commentators compare him to Spiderman before things eventually did break down in the all out brawl between all six men that went not just in & outside of the ring but throughout the crowd as well that resulted in participants in the match being taken out one by one allowing the numbers game to take effect.  This turned out to be the intense fight you was expecting with Jerry Lawler describing it best saying ""what a battle"" with the crowd being hot for this with duel chants for both teams & ""This Is Awesome!"" before they touched along with this match causing one of the funniest Twitter trends in WWE history.

Divas Champion A.J. Lee vs. Cameron - Cameron was out for revenge for her partner Naomi's eye injury but this wasn't a good performance as she was off at times while the only thing noteworthy was how sexier A.J. was with the pom poms than Cameron but the bigger issue here was what Tamina at ringside ended up doing to BOTH women.

Batista vs. Alberto Del Rio - This was one of those matches that will be remembered for what happened outside the match than during it as Batista was on the defense for a majority of the contest after Del Rio cheated to get an advantage & ruthlessly attacked his arm non-stop throughout the entire match using whatever he could use with Batista getting an occasional move in before he was able to take advantage of a mistiming but the story here was the crowd showing their disapproval for ""Boo-tista"" to the point where they cheered Del Rio along with other current & former superstars in what was a poor showing for a man who's suppose to head into the championship title match at the biggest show of the year.  I would check out their rematch the next night on RAW as that was a better encounter.

Elimination Chamber Match: WWE Champion Randy Orton vs. John Cena vs. Daniel Bryan vs. Sheamus vs. Christian vs. Cesaro - While the rules & structure for this Elimination Chamber match was the same, this was the first time since the creation of the match that there was only one World Championship in the WWE meaning that this was set to be the final chance for these men to get into a World Title match at WrestleMania.  Various highlights include who started out the match & their very physical interaction, Daniel Bryan being a one armed man throughout the contest, bodies being tossed into various parts of the chamber from the chain wall to grate floor including going through the pod on more than once occasion, one man using another as a weapon against another superstar, one period where everyone hitting anything that moved, Cesaro's showcase of power, the reaction from himself & the crowd when Randy Orton discovered he was a marked man by everyone in the chamber, and more than one non-participant making their presence known.  This was a fun match from start to finish.

It should be noted that we heard from Bad News Barrett around 4 different times throughout the night while the pre-show match between Goldust & Cody Rhodes vs. Ryback & Curtis Axel had a special appearance from Axel's grandfather Larry ""The Ax"" Hennig making it the first time they've been together on WWE TV since Axel has been an active superstar.

In the past, this PPV is just a ""main event"" show where WWE focuses on the main matches to setup WrestleMania with the rest of the card being irrelevant & unimportant fillers but I'll give credit here in that we had a stronger undercard here than usual with the title matches & six man tag so it's an event I would check out if you have a few bucks to spare or catch a replay on either through streaming or their new network.",1393372800,2,6011,4.4817184643510055

6109356,3,B00GSTHDDO,"Another pay-per-view down and we get something of a less hostile crowd, although whether that's due to overall quality of the night or the people in the arena I'm not sure I'll ever know.  Either way, there are highs and lows to this event (as is common) but thankfully there are a few things that this pay-per-view sets up going forward to Wrestlemania.

""We the people"" is the first thought that comes to mind when it comes to the opening match.  Strangely Jack Swagger has been in win/lose limbo recently in favor of pushing other stars but this crowd did not forget him.  As a heel you wouldn't think he'd get one of the best reactions of the night but he did indeed.  Going against Big E Langston in the opening match you'd think this would be a quick match with some moderate offense followed by a quick come behind by Langston to squash Swagger but these guys were given over 10 minutes to work with which felt just right.  I'm glad to because these two worked together fairly well.  Swagger has always been a wrestler I'm never sure how well he'll mesh with somehow until he gets into the ring with him and stylistically it worked out that Swagger's odd offense would work well with Langston's big power moves.  Honestly, a strong showing from both men in this bout but the match itself resembles a 3.5/5 due to the energy of the crowd.

Next up is the tag match that I think most people expected after the New Age Outlaws picked up the titles after the Royal Rumble, where they defended the titles against the Usos.  Honestly, a lot of the work comes from the Usos in this as they carry more of the athletic maneuvers during the match while also making the New Age Outlaws look strong (this goes the same for the New Age Outlaws).  For me, the New Age Outlaws have been well established as a good tag team but in this day with the younger talent you can tell how so much of their form now comes from the charisma they exude.  The match itself is alright but I think this was done more in the way that a series is set up; the first one gives the general feel out process while the next bout will likely be the ""shiner"" of the two.  I will say the New Age Outlaws did a great job in establishing the Usos as not only a legitimate challenger but the likely flagship tag team to carry the titles in the near future.  Also, if you watch this match don't forget to look out for a scary dive to the outside that involves a bit more than just a collision.

Titus O'Neil wrestling Darren Young is short.  Shorter than the other two matches before which seemed like a confusing move but I suppose a few more minutes would not have changed my mind about the overall quality of the match.  Built up as the official split between two former tag team partners I would have thought a bit more time would have gone in given the turning point that this means in their careers but again, I'm not really sure that would have done much.  Overall, this match may not be remembered for much beyond the knowledge of who won.  I'm not saying it was a bad match but I simply was not emotionally involved in this one. Had I been that may have changed my thoughts about it.

Going in most fans were guessing this would be the best match of the night.  Regardless of the story between the members of the Shield the actual buildup to this match was incredible.  In the weeks going into this pay-per-view the most exciting aspects of RAW and SMACKDOWN were the promos down between these two factions.  The best buildups frequently involve little actual contact between the 2 opposing sides (in my personal opinion).  This is the case and luckily between the Shield and Bray Wyatt there was no shortage of amazing promo work and then finally the physical confrontation in the RAW before was little more than a brawl.  My personal feelings are that matches between people at pay-per-views should not have any matches between each other prior to the event (such as when a challenger happens to beat a champion in a non-title bout before the actual point where the title is on the line).  It keeps the actual match from feeling fresh and unique.  As you may have heard this is the match you wanna watch, regardless of how you feel about the pay-per-view as a whole.  This felt as epic as the Shield's debut over a year ago at TLC 2012.  It's funny because of the recent push for Roman Reigns I almost forgot just how good these men are when they work together as a team in tag team matches.  It made me a fan all over again.  Even the Wyatts, who I think have had trouble finding someone to truly get the best out of them, shined here.  One of the best parts of this is the fact that every wrestler in this match was given a chance to shine, which is so rare.  It should also be noted that these guys were given almost 25 minutes to work and it is a wonderful call to let these guys just work for such a long amount of time.  This may not do much in terms of story but for sheer match quality count this as a strong, strong ""match of the year"" candidate.

After the Shield/Wyatt match you need a bit of a cooldown (something WWE I think took to heart after the Triple H/Lesnar match from last Wrestlemania showed).  Unfortunately it came in the form of a really quick and unimpressive divas match.  While not terrible you could see that they were shooting on more for story in this one than match quality which is kind of unfortunate as this should really be the time to hype up the divas division heading into Wrestlemania.  My big schtick is that AJ has truly shown herself to be a not only a great talent but a good champion.  The problem is that AJ is a standout in the divas division where some can do good promos while most suffer as good wrestlers.  As a matter of point I don't think Cameron is that diva to be the rival to push AJ and the women's division to the next level (unfortunate Kaitlyn left but I have let that sting go too long as is).  I know they're setting up the Tamina Snuka turn (hopefully sooner than later) but this match is largely a miss.

I'm not the biggest Dave Batista fan in the world but I'm gonna tell you that I am still blown away at how strong his negative reactions have been since returning.  His match with Alberto Del Rio on this night goes a long way in throwing the big question mark in what they'll be doing with him come Wrestlemania.  The match initially starts out as a promo with Del Rio claiming to be injured but then in heel style he reveals otherwise (I'd like to point out the lack of any reaction to this move in the beginning, there was nothing.  Almost funny really).  Batista and Del Rio go on to have an alright match but it just felt like an unneeded piece in the overall scheme of the pay-per-view.  I think the most memorable part of the whole thing had to be the fact that by the end of the match people were actively getting behind Del Rio.  Batista continued to be booed and jeered at throughout the entire match which is thankfully under ten minutes.  Strange that this one had so little going for it in terms of actual match quality.

This is one aspect of the evening I couldn't quite get.  Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy the concept of the Elimination Chamber.  Having watched the original match I think it's one of the best ideas to come along since TLC was introduced and stands as one of the last great ideas to come out of the new era beyond the Money in the Bank match (a personal favorite).  I just really, really hate gimmick pay-per-views.  Honestly, I downright detest them.  This one, along with Money in the Bank, Hell in a Cell, and TLC are ideas I just do not agree with.  I loved the idea of when Money in the Bank was a Wrestlemania event match so that kinda shoots me down a bit but the other matches lose there power after turning into a theme for a pay-per-view.  To me, Hell in a Cell remains the structure that shortened, and eventually ended, Mick Foley's career.  It remains the structure that marked the end of of some of the best feuds in history.  The Elimination Chamber was a wonderful way to secure a champion or build a new star.  TLC is largely something that shouldn't happen more than once every year or two because you desensitize people to it.  I know WWE uses these matches as a way to build buy rates but it takes away from how special these matches used to be (I swear that all had a point).  So for me, this particular Elimination Chamber match feels really, really weak.  It's a strange thing to say because it established some good things but I feel like the match was off.  Cesaro and Christian established themselves as relevant in the turmoil of such big time players which was great since I was worried they were going to get buried in a need to play up story but that didn't occur.  Orton played the heel wonderfully in this match with Daniel Bryan largely being the focal point of a strong amount of abuse.  Cena and Sheamus were alright but felt out of place (beyond the Wyatt bit).  The big picture in this Elimination Chamber was the push for story.  While that's not bad I think they did some things that lowered the overall quality of the match (even though the last five to ten minutes were great).  Overall, I have very mixed feelings about this one as I largely hate any kind of interference in these matches, even if it pushes story lines further.

The pay-per-view as a whole left me unimpressed.  The standout was the Shield/Wyatt match but I shudder from telling people to buy an event simply for one match.  Overall, as long as you watch the Shield/Wyatt match you won't miss much with the rest of the event, which is sad as this will be the last pay-per-view before Wrestlemania itself.",1393286400,,9695,4.3526140155728585
6109357,2,B00GSTHDDO,"The Rhodes vs Ryback and Curtis Axel w/ Larry the Axe Hennig: Curtis was pinned by the Cross Rhodes is all I remember.
  Jack Swagger vs Big E. (IC Title): good match with Swagger almost winning with the ankle lock a couple of times. But Big E. won with the big ending.
  The Uso's vs New Age Outlaws: Usos, the younger team who have always bust their butts once again aren't tag champs. The Outlaws won with a rollup by Billy Gunn.
  Darren Young vs Titus O'Neil: could have happened on any show. Just remember  Titus won with a spinebuster powerbomb.
Cameron vs AJ (Diva's title): unnecessary match with Cameron winning by DQ after Tamina attacked Cameron.
Alberto Del Rio vs Batista: a head scratcher of who would win. Yeah right, Boretista won with the Boretista Bomb.
The Shield vs the Wyatt's: another solid Wyatt match. Wyatt's won when Roman Reigns was left alone with all 3 Wyatt's. Roman broke out of Sister Abrigal once but Bray eventually hit it on him for the win.
  This is supposed to be Bray Wyatt's year but doubt it if he's versing Mr. Kick Out at 2, John Cena at WM. And no way will Cena lose 3 ppvs in a row. He'll make Bray look weak, like he does with anyone with potential.
  The Chamber: Christian eliminated Sheamus, Cena kicked out of many signature and finisher moves and did the 5 Knuckle Shuffle 2 times to many boos. So to me Cena just shouldn't have been in the match. Cesaro impressed many when he took on Cena on Raw. So was rewarded by getting to tap to Cena's weak STF.
  Bryan eliminated Christian with a running knee. Cena stopped stinking up the match when the Wyatt's caused him to get pinned by Orton. Bryan should have won but Kane was out to check on Cena, so of course Kane caused Bryan to get 2 RKO's and that was it for him. Brock never came out. So Orton vs Batista will officially stink up WM.
  I can't think of any good match Orton and Batista have ever had, especially one WM worthy. Lesnar vs Batista would make a bigger fresher match. And would almost make it worthwhile that Batista even won the Royal Rumble. Does the WWE even try any more ?",1393113600,,2095,4.349614395886889
