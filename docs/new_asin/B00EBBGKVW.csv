5901072,4,B00EBBGKVW,"Thank you Bernadette and family for making this documentary. In my family of 9 siblings, 7 of us have CMT in varying degrees of severity and your story helped me to better understand this disease...your courage and strength is inspiring.",1446940800,,237,4.95
5901073,5,B00EBBGKVW,"If you're not sure how serious CMT is, then this documentary will bring it home. Bernadette's story hit me like a kick in the stomach.",1444953600,,134,4.4
5901074,4,B00EBBGKVW,"Insight to what it is like, to experience the hereditary Neuromuscular Disease ""Charcot Marie Tooth"". In the first person, you see how this individual deals with her ailment daily. Interesting, informative on an observational basis.",1434412800,,232,5.6571428571428575
5901075,5,B00EBBGKVW,"Although this movie probably won't win any Oscars or Emmys, it is a real movie about a real disease. I found the movie informative even though I've been battling CMT for 20 plus years. The documentary focuses on a girl with a lifestyle that doesn't adhere to conservative ways or beliefs, but you would have to be pretty narrow minded to let that interfere with the moving story and the movie's depiction of real life. Sometimes life is messy, And it can be even messier fighting CMT. I give the movie 5 stars because it is the first widely distributed movie to really depict this disease that is so common that most people have never heard of. Kudos.",1419984000,5,651,4.52542372881356
5901076,5,B00EBBGKVW,This was a great documentary. A few of my family members have CMT. It was comforting to know there are others out there. Thank you Bernadette for raising awareness for CMT.,1412812800,,172,4.580645161290323
5901077,5,B00EBBGKVW,Loved the documentary without the feel of watching a documentary. I have enjoyed following Bernadette for the last two years and finally took a night to watch the film. My diagnosis has been suggested but not confirmed by genetic testing. I look forward to seeing more an I know angels are guiding all of us. Bernadette is here for a very special purpose.,1410912000,,355,4.650793650793651
5901078,2,B00EBBGKVW,"The subject is very important to me as three generations of our family suffer from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disorder which affects Bernadette.  That said, I was disturbed by the smoking, the foul language and the generally depressing tone of the film.  I had hoped to show it to my CMT Support Group, but will not now.  Bam",1393372800,5,318,4.745454545454545

5901080,5,B00EBBGKVW,"WOW!! This is a well done documentary about an awesome woman with a neuromuscular disease that I had never heard of but turns out to be quite common.  (Check out the website, [...]  I found myself crying one minute and actually laughing the next.  The filmmaker (Joshua Taub) showed sensitivity towards his subject (Bernadette) and insight into what it's like to live with this debilitating disease while also enlightening us to the facts.  I look forward to seeing more of his work",1385078400,4,482,4.841463414634147

5901082,5,B00EBBGKVW,"I loved this documentary. It shows disability in a very real way. Bernadette is a great person and daughter and friend. People with disabilities are all of these things first, before we are our disability. Please watch. I love the part when the kids are asking her questions and how she responds. Kids are very smart.",1509753600,,317,4.678571428571429
5901083,3,B00EBBGKVW,Informational and enlightening for those of us who'd never heard of CMT.  But also very sad.,1509667200,,92,4.75
5901084,5,B00EBBGKVW,"A heart warming story of a chilling disorder, made interesting and watchable by a supportive family and an outstanding young spokeswoman. Left me wishing I could meet Bernadette to share her strength and humor and her presence. Glad I didn't pass this one up! Her personal story drew my interest because she is interesting unto herself. Nice to know she has been lucky in love. All the best to you Bernadette in life and love.",1508544000,4,426,4.693333333333333
5901085,3,B00EBBGKVW,"It's a decent enough personal piece about people with CMT. There isn't a lot of information given about the multiple types of CMT.  From the parents' own reports about their genetic counseling, the East Coast doctors are still fifty years behind. They, too,  told my parents 50 years ago that a girl wouldn't get it. Well, I was that girl. So the next twenty years in Philadelphia, I had to convince neurologists that I really did have a problem, that it hurts, and not to cut me up because all they wanted to do was to operate.

I am now 48. I was told as a teen not to ever get pregnant because it would put me in a wheelchair. Then I was told I couldn't get pregnant anyway because I was infertile. At age 23, I was three months along before I found out I was pregnant. And I felt great pregnant! I started to question all of this fear put into me by the docs at Children's Hospital in Phila. in the 1970's. Fortunately, only two of my four sons have CMT. One wants to be an actuary and the other is applying to grad school for physical therapy. They are both active and driven.

We have different kinds of CMT within our family even though doctors used to claim that isn't possible. I am currently recovering from my second hip replacement (revision) and it's pretty awful because I still have all the pain from that surgery, my spinal stenosis, my arthritis, and my CMT, and pain meds barely work on me. My 24 year old had a complete spinal fusion at 17 because HIS CMT caused Scheuermann's kyphosis and bent him in half. That's is why he is inspired to help others as a PT.

I hate talking about myself, but It's hard to say anything positive about this film.  This is a depressing movie and I think I am struggling to not say that. It's simply not intelligent or engaging. There is so much to be said that goes ignored for even more personal footage of Bernadette dealing with her private life  It's not important to me that she is gay and the flirtation with her girlfriend about the bath was pretty ghetto. That she smokes is intolerable to me. it's not edgy or cool, it's a damn addiction that kills people.

Twenty years ago, I would have felt some connection to this fellow CMT sufferer. However, I more like scolding a surly little girl. I do hope she gets relief. It's a miserable life.",1508544000,,2300,4.344988344988345
5901086,5,B00EBBGKVW,This CD is informative and knowledge is power.  Bernadette is a brave woman who shares her CMT experience.  She is an inspiration.  Thank you.,1487203200,,142,4.833333333333333
5901087,5,B00EBBGKVW,My granddaughter has Charcot Marie Tooth Syndrome and I wanted to hear how Bernadette coped with the disease.  It was heartbreaking to see how much pain it caused her and my heart aches for anyone that has this disease.  My granddaughter suffers in many ways being 13 and does not have a lot of friends because she can't be very active  not having a lot of stamina.  It would be good to have an online support group for those with Charcot Marie and they could communicate with each other for support.  I am very grateful for Bernadette doing this movie.,1485907200,,553,4.49
5901088,5,B00EBBGKVW,As a CMT patient it is great to see a film about  something that the general public do not even know about and how people with this condition are suffering,1481846400,,155,4.166666666666667
5901089,5,B00EBBGKVW,"This amazing film about the struggles of a woman (Bernadette) dealing with a debilitating disease will stay with you long after viewing. The film is powerful in it's raw emotion as it shares a very personal glimpse into Bernadette's life; the challenges she faces, her losses and her triumphs. Bernadette suffers from Charcot-Marie-Toothe (CMT) disease, a genetic disease affecting the nerves of the arms and legs, and she is a huge source of inspiration to those within the CMT community and beyond. This engaging documentary is a must-see for all!",1480118400,,549,5.111111111111111
5901090,5,B00EBBGKVW,Wonderful documentary about CMT!  Thank you!,1456012800,,44,6.333333333333333
5901091,5,B00EBBGKVW,"Thank you all for bringing awareness of this disease, especially on such a personal level. I was diagnosed with CMT1a last year at the age of 52 during a physical. Initially, my primary physician after seeing muscle atrophy on my hands, thought I might of had cancer but after extensive testing, CMT1a was the diagnosis. Bernadette, thank you so much for allowing us into your life and educating us on our disease and showing us how to accept it and live life to the fullest!",1451692800,,475,4.6
8603461,5,B00EBBGKVW,Thank you for the lesson in life about CMT! God Bless you lovely child!,1531267200,,71,4.142857142857143
8603462,2,B00EBBGKVW,"Went into this thinking it was going to be a documentary about CMT and life with a disability. There's very little science and a ton of religion, in fact theres so much religious emphasis that it's baffling the description doesn't mention it.",1525996800,2,242,4.785714285714286
8603463,5,B00EBBGKVW,everyone needs to see the film very emotionally,1525737600,,47,5.0
8603464,5,B00EBBGKVW,"This was such a touching, inspiring doc. I've never heard of this disease until now so mission accomplished Bernadette! What a strong, beautiful and amazing woman!! I only wonder who was cutting onions while I was watching because my eyes wouldn't stop. Strange too because I live along. Anyways, I wish her the best and a long and happy life. Praying for a cure.",1517270400,,363,4.6875
8603465,5,B00EBBGKVW,"I love this picture not so much for the technicalities that go into making a movie, but for the message Bernadette has lived her life for the rest of us to receive; a powerful message the world needs to hear. I've worked in the medical field for most of my life and had never heard of CMT before this film. Bernadette, both the movie and the person, reminds us that we encounter people every day who are fighting fierce, brave battles...and that those of us who aren't affected really should be. Hope that makes sense...",1515542400,4,520,4.484210526315789
8603466,5,B00EBBGKVW,"As a person with another rare disorder, (tethered cord syndrome), I watched this and felt love and hope for all those with CMT! Bernadette, you are an inspiration and I pray for you and your family that you know many of us are with you in keeping the faith! Cures are in our future!
This is a wonderful and very well made documentary. I know you will be lifted up when you watch this! Thanks guys for sharing your story.",1515369600,3,420,4.2625
8603467,5,B00EBBGKVW,"Great documentary!  Bernadette is an amazing young woman that is dedicating her life in making others aware of her awful disease called Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT).  CMT is a neuromuscular disease that is characterized by a slowly progressive degeneration of the muscles of the foot, lower leg, hand and forearm.  CMT is one of the hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies.  A group of varied inherited disorders of the peripheral nervous system.  This is an inherited neurological disorder and affects approximately 1 in 2,500 people.  2.6 million people, worldwide, struggle with this disease every day.  Not to mention the fact that it's very often misdiagnosed.  For some, for several years.  Some doctor's aren't even fully aware of CMT.  This documentary gives everyone a chance to see the struggles she faces daily.  Let's help Bernadette in spreading the word about CMT so a cure can be found.",1512777600,6,908,5.236111111111111
8603468,5,B00EBBGKVW,Bernadette is so hot!,1511568000,,21,4.5
8603469,4,B00EBBGKVW,It was a very interesting look into a little known disease. Bernadette has a fire within her to continue on and not complain about her illness. I was shocked to learn that she smokes! What the heck!,1510531200,2,198,4.378378378378378
8603470,5,B00EBBGKVW,"I definitely recommend this movie to all! I was very impressed! Bernadette is a hard driven woman who is going to accomplish everything she sets out to do. I had never heard of CMT nor the devastating effects this disease has on a person. I have a life threatening hereditary disease myself so a lot of things Bernadette struggles with I found myself relating to her. But I am not nearly as strong and courageous as her! Shes actively advocating for awareness and it puts things into perspective.

I find documentaries like this one inspiring because whenever I feel like my pain or situation is so horrible and I don't want to push through another surgery or procedure... I think, wow! How can I complain about what measly little issue Im going through right now when there are these great strong people out there like Bernadette! And shes going through so much more pain and crap than my little pain! Bernadette you are such an inspiration to me. Everyone fighting with CMT is. Little Grace, you are adorable and don't listen to anyone trying to bully you...they don't know anything. Just being ignorant and they mean nothing to you! Only listen to the people who love you like your beautiful mother and brother! Youre perfect just the way you are sweetheart!
Thank you for making this movie. And opening my eyes to CMT. You ARE bringing awareness for CMT! Stay strong and healthy everyone!",1510099200,5,1392,4.704918032786885
