Now his wife wants him to tell his mother to leave the apartment she lives in so that they can sell it. So Jaime will spend more and more time with his mother, talking about her, about the past and about her new boy-friend who's 69 years old. I liked a lot this bittersweet comedy coming from Argentina. The performance of veteran actress China Zorrilla and Eduardo&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Son-of-the-Bride/dp/B00006BS7S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Son of the Bride</a>&nbsp;Blanco is gorgeous.

8110045,3,B000EHQ82S,Great dialog but not too much action. It is a good story with very few characters. Super sweet though. Something to say about modern families nowadays.,1361059200,,151,4.846153846153846
8110046,5,B000EHQ82S,"That about sums up this exquisite little study made for the big screen.
Superb performances and a deft script combine to make this touching story about human relations a real gem.  It is very much within the Latin idiom and will instantly be identifiable with countless millions of Spanish speakers, being as it is Argentinian cinema at its best.  That is not to say by any means that others will not appreciate its delicacy and humour, since we all know about wise, understanding mothers and their overgrown""baby"" sons, which this films so well explores.
If you want to know exactly what it is about, you can read the Amazon synopsis. If it seems like your cup of tea, buy with confidence.",1333497600,3,690,4.694214876033058
8110047,5,B000EHQ82S,"La noche anterior yo haba visto ""Luna de Avellaneda"", una pelcula (tambin Argentina) que si bien es interesante, es un tanto larga y que no me dej tan satisfecha despus de todo. Con base en eso, tena un poco la duda de si ""Conversaciones con mam"" realmente iba a gustarme o no. Me alegro mucho de haberla visto ya que la disfrut enormemente. Esta es una de esas pelculas que con gusto vera nuevamente. Las actuaciones de China Zorilla y Eduardo Blanco son excelentes y la historia es sin duda tierna, emotiva y a la vez un tanto agridulce, pero con un buen final. Es una de esas pelculas que resalta circunstancias en las que el protagonista debe decidir lo que realmente es importante en la vida. Si le gust ""El Hijo de la Novia"" le recomiendo mucho que vea esta pelcula!",1288051200,3,772,4.443661971830986
8110048,4,B000EHQ82S,"I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for an entertaining and very touching film. It is a wonderful tale of an only child reconnecting with his mother.  Through their numerous conversations, brought about by his need to reluctantly discuss an unpleasant turn in his economic status, it marvelousy illustrates that mother does indeed ""know what is best.""

The screenwriting and directing is top-notch.  The conversations are witty, intelligent and at times, quite bittersweet.

I watched this movie with my own elderly mother (also a Latina) and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  You will really enjoy this film!",1238976000,,628,5.303030303030303
