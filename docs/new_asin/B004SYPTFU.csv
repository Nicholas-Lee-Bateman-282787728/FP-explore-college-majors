8440321,2,B004SYPTFU,"It reads:  ""This is the 2010 story of Canada's men's and women's players who are Team Canada's reigning Olympic gold medal champions in hockey...On 5 discs coloured in the gold that adorned each player, every moment that led to the final gold medal from the XXI Olympic Winter Games is included.""

Indeed, it would appear that ""every moment that led to the final gold medal"" for the men's team is, indeed, included on four of the five discs in the set.  This is hardly the case for the women's tournament; Disc Two includes a four-minute ""Tournament Introduction"" and seventeen minutes of ""Preliminary Round & Playoff Highlights.""  The only game that meets the ""every moment"" criteria claimed in the product blurb is, in fact the women's gold medal game--apparently seventeen minutes of ""highlights"" is the Canadian equivalent of ""every moment"".  In fact, to make matters worse, the rest of Disc Two contains ""Pre-Game Commentary"" for each game of the men's tournament.

Overall, I wouldn't have minded the set so much, except for the fact that I purchased it with the reasonable expectation that it contained, on five discs, the complete tournaments for both the men's and women's teams--the seven men's games and five women's game could have fit easily on five double-sided discs, along with the commentary and medal ceremonies and whatnot.  Indeed, in re-reading the product blurb, I fail to see where my expectations were misguided--this is deceptive and misleading information, pure and simple.

Unfortunately, I didn't buy this set on Amazon; fortunately, I bought it for far less than $69.68--I bought it on Ebay for $14.75 plus three dollars shipping from Canada; apparently this has hit the cut-out bins up in the Great White North.  I really hope that with such deceptive and misleading advertising, CTV did indeed take a bath on this boxed set.",1337990400,,1855,5.0359477124183005
