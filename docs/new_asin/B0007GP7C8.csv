2212683,2,B0007GP7C8,"It is a bit strange to watch all this fight against Dan Brown's book. What is for? Millions people who like the Da Vinci Code book usually do not take it as a source of historical facts. The value of this book is not in the particular facts but in general (and serious) idea about danger of destroying male-female balance in society. Indeed, a human being consists of two parts. Males and females have very different views on this World so that these views should be well balanced. If one of the parts becomes heavily predominating, it may be truly dangerous for survival of our species. Dan Brown just takes our attention to the problem. He shows that the imbalance has a  long history and it might be a major source of many current problems in human society as well as the source of overall instability on the Earth. And the latter is not fiction.",1150070400,14,849,4.47741935483871
2212684,5,B0007GP7C8,"'Breaking the Da Vinci Code' does an excellent job of presenting the legitimate facts of Biblical History.  Dan Brown's book, which he admits draws significantly from a previous book, 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail', has numerous flagrant historical flaws in it, which this video brings forth.  Of course, Mr. Brown's supporters will argue that this is a 'novel', but the point is Mr. Brown represents his novel as being based on 'fact'.  This legitimately opens him up to an honest, scholarly review of his 'facts'.  As 'Breaking the Da Vinci Code' demonstrates, Mr. Browns 'facts' are essentially fiction.  The core of the 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail' thesis, which Mr. Brown makes the core of his book (i.e., the claimed marriage and offspring of Jesus and Mary Magadalene, the connection between the Knights Templar and the alleged 'Priory of Sion', the claimed authenticity of the 'Dossier Secret' in the French National Library) are all exposed as either a fraud or fictional speculations.

  As added support to the information provided by 'Breaking the Da Vinci Code', CBS's 60 Minutes recently did their own investigation of the claims of Mr. Brown (which aired just recently on April 30th) and came to the same conclusions reached by this video, that there is no support for a so-called 'Priory of Sion' beyond the demonstrably fraudulent 'Dossier Secret' (which are forgeries created by Pierre Plantard, a French anti-semitic nationalist, and some of his circle), that there is no historical evidence to support a supposed marriage between Mary Magadalene and Jesus (or any other women for that matter), and that Mr. Brown's claims (as well as those of the writers of 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail') are merely a regurgitation of the old Gnostic psuedopigraphia which have rightly and properly been excluded from the Biblical canon for very sound and legitimate historical reasons.

  It should also be pointed out that this is not merely a 'conservative' viewpoint.  Both liberal and conservative theologians, history scholars, and art historians have almost unanimously 'debunked' and rejected Mr. Brown's claims of 'fact' advanced in his book.  Legitimate historians are concerned about real evidence, not mere speculation in the manner advanced by Mr. Brown.

  I can also state that my own research as a former Bible Seminary student and historical researcher has also confirmed the same conclusions reached by 60 Minutes and 'Breaking the Da Vinci Code'.  If someone is going to attempt to overturn 2000 years of established, documented, and corroborated history, which has been substantiated and affirmed by scholars down through the centuries, he's going to have to come up with a lot more evidence than 'The Da Vinci Code' and 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail' have produced.",1146873600,28,2769,5.186516853932584
2212685,4,B0007GP7C8,"The reputable scholar in archeology, theology and art history explain the differences between the fact and fiction in Da Vinci Code. I really like the interesting bonus features including the life of Lenardo Da vinci and the tour at the rosslyn chapel. The bonus interviews with the historian and theologian gave the in-depth discussion about the controversial topic regarding the Jesus's Marriage with Mary Magdalene and the structure of the bible in early Christianity History. If you are fascinated by the Da Vinci Code, why don't you also consider watch this DVD from different perspectives.",1136937600,27,595,5.273684210526316
2212686,1,B0007GP7C8,"Fortunately I obtained this DVD from the library & didn't have to pay for it.  Very one sided.  Almost completely avoids discussing both sides.  Recomnmend instead, DA Vinci Codde Decoded,  Jesus, Mary & Da Vinci or Unlociking Da Vinci's Code.  Check Amazon reviews & rating on these other DVDs",1121385600,35,294,4.918367346938775
2212687,3,B0007GP7C8,"Overall this is an interesting DVD.  The main problem I had with this DVD was that after a while you start to notice that it is quite a bit one sided.  It is ALL quite against Dan Brown's book.  You start to feel like behind the scenes of this DVD it is put together by very conservative Christians.  Although I personally do not believe the notion that Jesus was married to Mary or for that matter I do not take Dan Brown's book too seriously as a true source of historical/religious wisdom--at all, I still found this DVD to be quite a bit one sided and conservative.  No one on this program even goes into the interesting topic of at least questioning the standard Christian dogmas that have been purported over the centuries.  No one on this program even brings up the fascinating notion of exploring a Jesus beyond the conservative views----at least to explore the idea.  NO, this program mainly pushes how perfect the bible is and how if it's not in the scriptures it's not reliable.

Those people that clearly are against the Da Vinci code book will enjoy this program most.  Those that are in the grey areas or conspiracy theory types will not like this DVD much.

I think it's fair to say that there are a lot of people like myself who do not really believe in the theories of Da Vinci Code yet find it fascinating because it at least makes one go beyond just being spoon feed religion.  I was hoping this DVD would have a bit of that flavor of a well rounded discussion but it did not.  All the experts they had on their panel were clearly against all the ideas in Da Vinci code and that was pretty much the tone of the whole DVD.

You make up your mind for yourself if that is a balanced discussion.",1120348800,63,1710,4.339622641509434
2212688,2,B0007GP7C8,"I was extremely disappointed with this title in the sense that it is a one way only answer.  They do admit that the book is a great read but apparently everything Mr. Brown wrote is fiction based on his own delusions.  They also seem to point to Mr. Brown as the only person to ever make claims like the ones in his book.  I am an open-minded person and will gladly look into new ideas and possibilities.  This dvd made me feel like a fool to do so.  On the other hand, if you don't beleive anything in the book, then this dvd is for you.  It might also help to let everyone know that at the end of the presentation, the narrator tells you that if you want to know the whole truth, you should seek your answers in a book you probably already have at home... the bible.  How convenient!  Hope this helps!",1119744000,19,803,4.135483870967742
2212689,4,B0007GP7C8,"It is nice to see a reasonable discussion of Dan Brown's claims of factual representation.  The main program on this DVD is only an hour long, so it cannot go into every aspect of the story.  The main points of contention are discussed with scholars (Mr. Brown does not participate) who are knowledgeable in the various disciplines (art history, biblical accuracy, etc.) explored in this story.  This documentary avoids the sensationism with which many alleged delvings into these 'mysteries' have been awash.",1115078400,12,509,5.182926829268292

8047537,5,B0007GP7C8,"I was looking for a DVD that would answer the questions that arose from the Da Vinci Code book and movies.  This is the best one I found so far.  The others focused on the Da Vinci code, this one focuses on the historical evidence for what Christians believe.  There was so much amazing information on this DVD.  I had bought the first one for our church library, but I bought the second for my family.  The New Testament alone is proof of Jesus historical existence, but there is so much beyond that!  The History of the church is amazing and there are so many false beliefs about this history.  Such as: Constantine; he may or may not have been a Christian, but whenever there was a debate about Christian doctrine,  he was the one that ordered the councils to meet and debate the issue.  He would watch the debates, but he never interfered with them.  He even paid the travel expenses for the men who participated in them!  Who knew?  Delores",1394409600,,945,4.430232558139535
8047538,1,B0007GP7C8,"Nothing but lies and dogma by a bunch of Christian ministers who disguise themselves by referring to themselves only as doctors. How come you didn't write Doctors of Divinity, guys? We're not all stupid. Anyone who loves church dogma and is afraid to think for themselves will like this set.",1392940800,,291,4.84
8047539,4,B0007GP7C8,"I have no interest in reading or viewing the DaVinci  Code which is based on pure fiction and the fantasizing of the crude lying  theory that Jesus Christ was married to Mary Magdalene, whom he saved her from sins. Nowadays one can find this or that video that even suggested that  Jesus had a son called Judas, which are ridiculous to the extreme.  These are purely Hollywood stunts and lies to earn a quick buck at the expense of Truth. I still stick to the Holy Scriptures or more precisely the New Testament which never mention one word about Jesus being married, much less to the woman called named  Magdelene. It is about time this truth be known to the world that Jesus Christ is the Son of the Living God, Jehovah. He is the first born among the dead. He will come again to divide the ""sheep"" from the ""goats"" at the right time - then the world will experience the Great Tribulation.

I think this DVD, in a way, answers many pertinent question about Jesus Christ and most precisely being that He  never married while on Earth.  And that for sure, Mary Magdelene was not Jesus' wife and that Jesus didn't have any children whatsoever. Whoever said that is an affront to the very idea of Christianity and will pay a  price for insulting Christ. If I were you, go for this DVD which proves that DaVinci Code is nothing but a big religious lie and con the public for their pocket change, believe you me. Hollywood is getting crazy and unreliable as the years go back. Thanks and have a Happy and Save Easter.

Remember too: Jesus is the Son of God as well as God in flesh - anything else is inspired by Satan whose time is very limited - The GREAT LAKE of Fire...is his ultimate destiny.

Cheers...and I recommend this DVD to all of you.",1175731200,,1742,4.395638629283489
8047540,4,B0007GP7C8,"I really have no interest in the Da Vinci Code phenomena, not so much because I am a Christian but because it seemed too contrived and the marketing around it too slick (not to mention the fact that Dan Brown's academic qualifications appeared to be non-existent).  The similarity to the whole Holy Blood, Holy Grail thing (which I could only read 80 or so pages of before concluding that it was totally ludacrous) didn't help either.  So only when I happened to come across this dvd at the library did I decide to watch it, and now that I have, I'm glad I did.  It essentially confirms my suspicions about the whole Da Vinci Code phenomena, although I won't go so far as to say that I'll consider it the final word in debunking it.  It does provide me with some food for thought, leads for further research were I ever to be so inclined.  In particular I found interesting the fact that Brown made a number of fundamental mistakes and apparently blatantly ripped off other people's work, namely a book called The Da Vinci Legacy which was published some twenty years ago.  In the end, I have to agree somewhat with an assertion made in the dvd that Brown has an anti-Christian agenda, that his intent is to undermine the Christian faith by sowing disinformation and doubt, while in the process making a large amount of money.",1173657600,,1326,4.550420168067227
8047541,3,B0007GP7C8,"Breaking the Da Vinci Code does a good job of separating fact and fiction & key attacks on Christianity by Dan Brown's book DaVinci Code.

Tony Robinson's ""The Real Da Vinci Code"" offers a thorough investigation that is a more even blend between the experts in art, history and other areas in contrast to those who a filling their pockets by labeling repackaged myths, legends and popular fiction as facts (Brown, et al).

The facts are in: Dan Brown does not seem to have any in his ""factual"" and ""accurate"" book. Of note, it seems that he ""borrowed"" his story lines from other works, so there may not be too many original ideas in his work either.

Brown's bold claims are deeply dishonest and clearly unethical. That always sells well, unfortunately.",1170547200,5,753,4.732824427480916
8047542,5,B0007GP7C8,This documentary shows why The Da Vinci Code is a work of fiction.  It does not take away from the entertainment value of The Da Vince Code.  It simply sheds light on the various lines of reasoning used to come to the conclusions reached in The Da Vince Code.  Watching this DVD will educate the viewer in the history of the spread of early Christianity.,1168300800,6,354,4.415384615384616
8047543,1,B0007GP7C8,"This is an extremely biased DVD put together by Christians for Christians.  I thought it would be some ""Discovery Channel""-type look at the historical facts surrounding the controversy, but it's not.  Since viewing this, I have seen some other similar programs on The History Channel and The National Geographic Channel which are much more fair, and give both sides of the argument equal time.  This one doesn't.  It also has several facts wrong.  If you are really interested in the history behind the controversy, buy something else.  This is very one-sided and is only good for showing in a church basement during a revival meeting.",1168300800,5,635,5.0
