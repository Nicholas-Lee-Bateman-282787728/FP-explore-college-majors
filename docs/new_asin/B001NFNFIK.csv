3715717,4,B001NFNFIK,"In the Electric Mist marks legendary French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier's first North American-made motion picture and, based on the troubles he encountered while making it, perhaps his last. Tavernier, a big fan of American crime fiction (he previously adapted Jim Thompson's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pop-1280/dp/0679732497/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pop. 1280</a>&nbsp;into&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coup-de-Torchon-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000059H7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coup de Torchon - Criterion Collection</a>), jumped at the chance to bring James Lee Burke's bestselling novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Electric-Mist-with-Confederate-Dead/dp/0752810650/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Electric Mist with Confederate Dead</a>&nbsp;to the big screen. However, reports surfaced that Tavernier and the film's star, Tommy Lee Jones, did not get along, and the producers were not happy with the director's version. As a result, the version released on DVD in North America is the producers' cut and not Tavernier's.

Tavernier does an excellent job capturing the local color of the area in the scenes where protagonist Dave Robicheaux (Tommy Lee Jones) canvases the locals. The entire film was shot on location and this only enhances the authenticity of the story's setting which is rich in atmosphere - also helped by the liberal use of blues and zydeco music. The cinematography has a textured quality to it that really brings out the lushness of the region.

The cast is outstanding with Tommy Lee Jones doing his patented gruff yet savvy lawman, Peter Sarsgaard portraying a boozy actor, and John Goodman as a scene-stealing mobster with a genial facade that barely masks a threatening demeanor. The cast is rounded out by fascinating veteran character actors like Mary Steenburgen, Pruitt Taylor Vince and Ned Beatty.

Despite the production and post-production problems that plagued the film, this version is engaging and entertaining but one still wonders what Tavernier's original cut is like.

Sadly, the only special features are a theatrical trailer but considering the bad blood between director and the producers this is hardly suprising.",1236038400,68,2317,6.662251655629139
3715718,1,B001NFNFIK,"Buyers beware...
This american release of Bertrand Taverniers IN THE ELECTRIC MIST is not the
cut favored by the French director but a producers cut which makes a total mess of the story and which is some 15 minutes shorter than the 117 minute director's cut recently presented at the Berlin Film Festival!

3715719,4,B001NFNFIK,"From the opening soliloquy admitting an alcoholic's obsession, to its conclusion in the sweltering bayou, this film version captures everything that has made millions of devoted fans for James Lee Burke's Dave Robicheax novels.  Tommie Lee Jones inhabits the soul Robicheax, a good man of faith haunted by a past of violence, racism and alcohol.  He fights his demons, but it is not clear whether he is winning his fights.

The film drips with bayou heat and rumbling thunderstorms that summon the Confederate Dead from the Electric Mist.  Faulkner wrote of the south that ""the past is not dead, its not even the past""  Such is true of Burke' characters, who live in a world of corruption, decption and power, trying to hide from their past, which always in one way or another, finds them.

Who did it?  In one way or another, they all did.  In Dave Robicheax's world, no one is innocent, except maybe those who become victims.

This is an outstanding movie that should have gone into theaters before going to DVD.  But we are fortunate this movie was made, and can only hope that despite whatever contract/production issues led to the movie going to DVD, that we'll see Tommie Lee Jones again as Dave Robicheaux.",1235779200,5,1213,4.760765550239235
3715720,4,B001NFNFIK,"I found it difficult to initially write a balanced review on ItEM because I felt so connected to this film. To disclaim, I performed Civil War re-enacting for 8 years with the 5th Texas, and my family name matches the main character; Never have seen Robicheaux/Robechaud in any film. So that aside, I just watched a great Tommie Lee Jones film filled with Civil War history (including a great role by Levon Helm playing John Bell Hood) and modern bayou mystery. Also nice to see the Louisiana area get some film money injected into their economy.

Plenty of upset people out there about the loss from the book series to film, but since I had not read any of the books, and I appreciate a film that doesn't spell every character out for you - this made for a solid, low-key suspense crime saga. Yes, there is a plethora of characters that pop in and out, obvious story lines not being conveyed in their entire sequence, and personality traits never explained with TLJ's violent/subdued split angles - but it all made (wholeheartedly) for a rewatchable film. Believable performances all around, and I hope to see them all again in more of these (like the successful Jesse Stone/Tom Selleck series). Nitpicking aside from other posters (Yes - there was Texas Cavalry in the Civil War) and the film being too short (I look forward to the other films being made), I hope people give this film a chance.

The BD sound was excellent with the DTS, and some of the pans will test your display refresh rate (several sequences of low angles/pointing up with sky backdrops; vehicles driving along ridges, fan boats skimming along the bayou, etc.). Some of the music mix sounded perfect and the 1080p shows our flawed characters' shortcomings in ways I never imagined, including John Goodman in tight swim trunks. There are absolutely no extras to speak of so I could not say this is a 5 star BD release, but definitely worth the purchase.",1235692800,6,1926,4.695266272189349
3715721,3,B001NFNFIK,"I am a huge fan of James Lee Burke's Dave Robicheaux books.  I have read most of them and most of them have been top notch.  Unlike most series, Burke's actually gets better and better and just when you think its peaked, he writes something better.

Having read so many of the books, I always pictured either Harrison Ford, Alec Baldwin (in his younger, lighter days) and Tommy Lee Jones as Dave.  2/3 predictions have come true.  Tommy Lee Jones is the perfect David Robicheaux, this character was meant for him to play.

In the Electric Mist is one of the best books in the series, so how come with a great book and great casting the movie is only ok?

The problem is the movie itself is very very inside.  The screen writers did too good a job adapting the story from the book.  Remember the book is a middle book of a very long running series.  As a fan and reader of the series, I knew who everyone was and how they got there.  The problem for the mass audience will be that they will have no idea who half the people are and the film does not really give any answers.

This unfortunately will be a film liked by those who have read the books, and not fully understood by those who have not.

Twice filmakers have well casted and made well intentioned adaptations of the books, and twice they have not come through as they should have.",1232323200,93,1340,4.290836653386454
3715722,3,B001NFNFIK,"How did they do this?

Imagine James Lee Burke's dry alcoholic cop Dave Robicheaux played by Tommy Lee Jones. A genius stroke of casting. Nobody else could have done this like TLJ.

Imagine one of JLB's colourful Louisiana crime stories with Blues and Cajuns and a legacy of racism and of decadent rich families with French names and a serial killer who likes to cut up prostitutes, and in all this Dave R. who keeps forgetting that he shouldn't beat up his witnesses.

Imagine the beautiful post Katrina rainy Louisiana countryside shot by professional camera teams.

Imagine a marvellous soundtrack mixing Cajun music and Blues, with Buddy Guy as resident musician. (How come I see and hear him in 2 films within a few weeks? First was Shine a Light, where he was a guest of the Stones.)

So, put all this together, and what is it that you ought to get? Yes, a great thriller full of suspense and visual as well as audio delight.
But what do you get? A perfect bore that fails even to try to interest you in its whodunnits and that never creates a fraction of the sense of danger that the book does, not even when the cop's daughter gets kidnapped by the serial killer. That is no mean feat.

3715873,2,B001NFNFIK,"I will admit that I am a fan of serial killer books and films.  I will also admit, however, that I usually only like true stories, and I don't believe that this could be a true story, or even ""based upon a true story,"" or even the lesser ""inspired by a true story,"" as it seems fairly fake.  I will finally admit that I didn't watch all of this movie; I turned it off after about the first half hour or so.  So, my two-star rating, I suppose, might have to be taken with a grain of salt.  Kind of like the writing and (some) of the acting in ""In the Electric Mist.""

First of all, the music is grating.  I hate it when the soundtrack of a film overdoes it by trying to play with your emotions, and this one is certainly guilty of that.  This in itself is almost enough to give this movie a pass.

But it also is the case that almost every film that I've ever screened that is shot in Louisiana, in ""The Bayou,"" is a fail as well.  There are a few exceptions; ""Heaven's Prisoners"" wasn't completely bad, but probably only because the very fine Teri Hatcher was ""nice enough"" to walk around naked on screen.  That was enough to make that film watchable.  Hey, I'm a dude, I'm not gay, and I'm mostly honest, so there you go.  (Even the much-missed Roger Ebert once asked his co-host Gene Siskel, ""You know what I liked about 'Catwoman'?  Halle Barry's face, Halle Barry's costume, and Halle Barry's body.""  He certainly had a point.). But usually, in these southern-fried movies, the writing and acting comes across as clichd, and I would say that this film is no exception.

And this is too bad because, as you already know, Tommy Lee Jones is one of our finest actors.  Usually, when he's just in a movie, you know that it should be good.  I've always thought that great actors only choose great roles with great writing and great direction, and this almost always holds.  But to be honest, once again, he is getting older -- we all do, at the same rate, at least on Earth -- so it just might be the case that he no longer has the clout to pick and choose.  If this is true, it is too bad.

It looks like this film was a Direct-2-DVD affair, and it probably deserves it.  And it also probably deserves a dissing from me, since after all, I am a fan of the genre but found this film almost unwatchable.  Oh, that's right; it was unwatchable.  I turned it off early in the second act, and I'm pretty sure that not much was missed.",1421193600,,2428,4.241830065359477

3715909,4,B001NFNFIK,"I randomly caught this movie on a local TV station, but came in during the middle of it. From what I saw, I knew it was in a genre I'd enjoy. I was able to watch it from the beginning to catch what I missed, and it was pretty interesting. I liked Dave and his need to find the killer, and I also liked the aspect of him possibly losing his mind when he starts to see an old Civil War soldier on his porch and around town.

Elrod was another character that was interesting - a movie star battling alcoholism but he becomes an important person in Dave's life.

I'm giving this movie four stars for a few reasons - First off, I love Tommy Lee Jones... he's a great actor, but I feel like the character should've been portrayed by someone younger. He has a twelve year old daughter, so the age gaps seems to be reaching a bit. Also, there were parts of the movie that moved slow. Some of it could have been cut out.

All in all, it is an interesting movie that did keep my interest.",1418083200,,978,4.083333333333333

Tommy Lee Jones is amazing in this!

You, of course, can choose to believe me or not.
I flew to Louisiana years and years ago for a party.  I was in the same area that this movie was made.  I even stayed all night in one of the homes shown in the movie.

I caught a ride.back to  Dallas...AND I SWEAR ON EVERYTHING WHAT I AM ABOUT TO TELL YOU IS TRUE!
We were driving over an area that is shown in the movie....suddenly big tears began flowing down my face.  I couldn't understand why my heart was breaking.

I apologized to the driver of the car.  He explained the heart felt pain that caused my tears.
Many, many Confederate Soldiers spilled their blood on that very soil.  The entire area is haunted.

In the movie, Tommy Lee is visited by the ghost of a Confederate Soldier.

3716064,3,B001NFNFIK,The movie is OK but a little bit overdone. The Civil War ghost is a little much. Tommy Lee Jones is good as the detective but John Goodman is not very believable as the crime boss. John Goodman seems to be in the film more to be able to list another star than a central figure in the story. The female FBI agent going along with a local police officer she does not know committing all kinds of illegal acts is not too realistic.,1400198400,,428,4.107142857142857

James Lee Burkes' book are poetic discourse about the human condition and  Robeauix's struggle to stay sober and with his honorable crusade to right the ugly behavior of the world.  This movie forgot to find this struggle and was just a typical TV mystery. The interplay and shared demons with his friend was totally negated.  The movie didn't come close to depicting the intrigue of the novel and was ** 1/2 stars at best.",1397779200,,520,4.6923076923076925

3716086,2,B001NFNFIK,"One of James Burke's better novels is poorly represented in this weak film adaptation. Despite the appropriate star power, overall the character portrayals were inadequate due to a poorly directed effort, and several plot emissions left the viewer wondering at times what the heck is going on. The ghost scenes, while some of the most important in the novel, were so weakly orchestrated as to be confusing- you might not even realize they were suppose to be ghosts if you hadn't read the novel. Here the director should have been patient enough to wait for a misty day or evening, or created it digitally to produce the necessary effect, likewise with the electric light nuances of the approaching storms (Hence the title, ""In the Electric Mists""). The movie failed to give me the intimate images of southern Louisiana that the novel made me yearn for, and the overall effect of the film was sadly disappointing.",1397606400,,912,4.890322580645162
3716087,4,B001NFNFIK,"Sort of a strange story line, but plenty of classic Tommy Lee Jones character for his fans (I'm one). For those of us who like to see the good guys win, this is an appropriate tale. Not five stars just because Jones has acted in plots I enjoyed more, but I'd watch this one again.",1397433600,,280,4.109090909090909
3716088,2,B001NFNFIK,"Relies way too much on local Louisiana color to carry the weight and is very poorly edited.  Many of the side characters are barely capable of acting and the the movie is a total mess in terms of the way many scenes transitions are abruptly done.

There is a reason this movie is free for Amazon Prime members.  It's a very forgettable movie.  Sometimes even good actors like Tommy Lee Jones and John Goodman can turn up a stinker.  This one certainly falls into that category.",1397174400,,477,4.5
3716089,3,B001NFNFIK,"I love all of James Lee Burke's books and I was anxious to see how they adapted to the big screen.  The main character casting was good.  I liked Tommy Lee Jones as the lead character, he fits the physical image I have of Robicheaux, but he didn't seem particularly comfortable in the role.  Having read the book I was able to follow the story, but it seemed very disjointed and rushed in movie form.  Had I not read the book my inclination would have been, WTH is going on?  The Dave Robicheaux book series is so good that I wish they would actually make them into movies in the James Bond fashion, but the writing and casting would have to be a lot better than it was in this movie.",1397174400,,684,4.190839694656488

When melded so perfectly on film, I can only give this 5 stars and hope others will enjoy.  As a daughter of the South, I tend to be drawn toward the ""bad boy"" images both on film and the written word...a little rough around the edges, and yes, often who carry their middle names everywhere they go!

3716094,5,B001NFNFIK,This is a Tommy Lee Jones movie that I didn't know existed. Found it scrolling through Prime movies and I can say it was one of the best choices made in long time. Tommy Lee plays a Louisiana sheriff's department lieutenant and when he stops a movie actor in town for a movie the actor tells him he knows where there is a body. It jogs his memory to a murder he witnessed as a teenager in the swamps and he is determined to find the murderers. Well the murderers are determined to stop Tommy Lee. John Goodman plays a great part as does Ned Beaty and  Mary Steenburgen. Awesome movie and discovered with little research you can find older good movies available on Prime.,1396396800,,670,4.36

3716111,4,B001NFNFIK,"As stated in other reviews, Tommy Lee Jones is a local parish detective when the serial murders of young women come to light. Jones character is a recovering alcoholic and the prime suspect, Baby Feet (well played by John Goodman) was his former friend. When a Hollywood movie production comes to film a Civil war movie in the bayou, unintended consequences arise when the lead actor accidentally finds the skeletal remains of another murder. If there is an actor better at his craft than Tommy Lee Jones, I don't know who it is. Mary Steenbergen gives a solid performance as his supportive wife. The opening & closing narration of the movie is as poetic as anything written by Faulkner. Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the excellent acting of the late Levon Helm as General John Horn of the Texas Confederacy. His soliloquy and his interaction with Tommy Lee Jones are superb. Also a shout out to those who cast the local extras....very well done! Especially Hogman.",1392768000,,982,4.7823529411764705

3716179,3,B001NFNFIK,"IN THE ELECTRIC MIST, (In the Electric Mist with Confederate Dead), (2008). This 102 minute thriller, helmed by the well-thought of French director Bertrand Tavernier, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Round-Midnight/dp/B000SOSS5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Round Midnight</a>) centers on characters created by beloved, bestselling American author of crime dramas, James Lee Burke.  The mystery is set in and around New Orleans, Burke's home, French-speaking turf, after the terrible damage inflicted  on the region in 2005 by Hurricane Katrina.  Principally, it tells us of troubled former New Orleans Police Detective Dave Robicheaux, now a deputy sheriff in neighboring Iberia County. The lead part is fully inhabited by veteran Texas-born actor Tommy Lee Jones, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Men-In-Black/dp/B0011E7JBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Men In Black</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fugitive/dp/B001EBYM8A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fugitive</a>), who might well have been born to play it, as it was created by the Texas Panhandle-born Burke.

The stubborn Robichaux, haunted by his service in the Vietnam War, struggling with a drinking problem, is, as ever, ignoring warnings to leave the local messes alone.  He begins to investigate the possible connections between a series of torture murders of local prostitutes, a 1976 lynching that he witnessed 35 years before as a young boy, and Julie `Baby Feet' Balboni, a notorious New Orleans gangster, played by the popular St. Louis-born John Goodman,(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Big-Easy/dp/6305262268/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Big Easy</a>). The Southern-born Mary Steenburgen, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cross-Creek/dp/B002VV8MQK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cross Creek</a>), plays Bootsie, the detective's second wife.

Ned Beatty, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hear-My-Song/dp/B00BUVA594/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hear My Song</a>) plays local rich man/bad guy Twinky LeMoyne.  Noted American musician Levon Helm plays long-dead General John Bell Hood, a Civil War stalwart who suddenly starts appearing to and chatting with Robicheaux and Sykes.  Noted American bluesman Buddy Guy plays local bluesman Sam `Hogman' Patin.  Director John Sayles plays Michael Goldman, producer of the picture filming locally. Marco Beltrami created the evocative score; Bruno de Keyzer, the cinematography.  The plot sticks recognizably close to Burke's underlying novel of the same name,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Electric-Mist-with-Confederate-Dead/dp/1439167605/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Electric Mist with Confederate Dead </a>.

Jones nails the part of Burke's detective, giving us a rounded performance that shows the complex nature of the character, violent one minute, tender the next.  He is miles better than Alec Baldwin, who was laughably miscast as the detective in HEAVENS PRISONERS.  And it's not a bad movie.  Yet, my understanding is that, although this film was made for theatrical release, it eventually went directly to DVD, which is probably why I, for one, although I am a Burke fan, never knew of its existence until I was informed of it by my Amazon friends.  I think some major structural problems may have caused that outcome.  Any Burke fan will know the detective's best friend, another former NOPD detective, Clete Purcel, overweight, sunburnt, heavy drinker, violent, everlastingly loyal, also native to NO's Irish Channel. Therefore, any Burke fan who has been to the movies a few times, in seeing the cast list before seeing the picture, will expect that Ned Beatty is playing Purcel.  I did.  But, somehow, the Purcel character isn't there, and Beatty is playing one of the heavies.  Also, Goodman has long been associated with The Big Easy, and it was perfectly reasonable to cast him as the gangster in this gritty film.  But Goodman, I believe, is a popular actor, and I suspect people may be uncomfortable with the way he is here treated.  I was.  Both these misjudgments create a film that's disappointing, but I still enjoyed it, as most Burke fans might.",1376611200,,4774,6.92

It's got real promise with some really great actors, but it seems like no one feels like acting that day. Even Tommy Lee Jones feels like he is annoyed to recite his lines and half asleep.

Not sure why it was necessary to put them in this movie but Buddy Guy's acting was just aweful. Levon Helm seemed liked he was trying too hard and still failed.

While the movie captured the essence of the book and was great entertainment with talented stars. Tommy Lee Jones, John Goodman, Peter Sarsgaard and Mary Steenburgen were fantastic in this gripping film; however, James Burke's book was so much better.

Although it was exceptionally good, there is just no way that an all-star cast in a psychological thriller can capture the picturesque tale in the span of 102 minuets that can compare to the magic of James Lee Burkes descriptive well-developed verse in this haunting tale.

While I recommend this gripping movie featuring wonderful music from award-winning Buddy Guy, I recommend reading the intriguing book prior to watching this film.

I loved the book and the film and think you will too!

The main character is played in quintessential Tommy Lee Jones style.  No surprises there.  The rest of the characters are well cast.  The plot, obviously chopped for the movie, has some strong and some weak connections that others have mentioned in their reviews.

I'll tell you it's just... so straight to DVD and Junior Varsity in quality, and I think the editor was whistling on a hammock because nothing makes sense.

3716304,2,B001NFNFIK,"So from reading other reviews I gather this is a book loosely based on a series of books.  I watched this movie with no pre-conceived expectations hoping for a gritty, gruesome, intelligent thriller.  What we got instead was a re-run of every other Tommy Lee Jones tough-cop ""out-house and doghouse"" movie, combined with a confusing plot with a convenient ending that left us screaming ""what?!"" at the TV.

Tommy Lee Jones was unconvincing in the lead role being noticeably aged since the last time I watched one of his films.  The actor's age and noticeable limp/stiff leg walk made him look ancient for the role.  The character's frequent too easily executed roughing up of everyone from mafia-like heavies to random street hoods begged the question how the character had made it this far in his career without being whacked before now.  Other characters were one-dimensional, notably the drunk hollywood moviestar and his girlfriend (straight out of Agatha Christie!), John Goodman as the mafia-like boss, and numerous others.  The FBI detective was bizarrely deferential to the main detective character, responding to all blatant acts of aggression and illegality with a tut-and-shake-of-the-head motion, perhaps a look of slight bafflement and then acting like nothing had happened.

The plot itself was mystifying, with numerous threads that the Tommy Lee Jones' main character conveniently linked together in a series of baffling hunches that always worked out.  In other places there were holes big enough to drive a tank through.  For all of the ""series of grisly murders"" referred to in the description of this movie none of the victims are developed in any way.  The FBI-referenced history of serial killing is limited to just that, a reference, with no development or expansion into why the FBI are even really involved (The agent certainly doesn't add anything to the investigation).  The whole movie descends into nothing more than an examination of the main character's virtues and attempts to get to the truth.  And when we get into the 'ghosts' that appear in the middle of the story, it just becomes totally unbelievable.  As the plot wraps up, loose ends are brushed aside, leads left untapped, and questions left unanswered.  And for those who have seen the movie, can anyone explain why the daughter character says ""Dave?"" while looking a picture of John Bell Hood right before the credits roll?  That resulted in popcorn being thrown at the TV!

All in all, there was potential here, but terrible casting, execution, one-dimensional characters and a half-baked story line make this entirely missable.",1369612800,,2622,5.131764705882353
3716305,4,B001NFNFIK,"The accents were solid, the acting was really good, the plot was really good with a lot of ""I didn't see that coming"". Thing is when the movie was over - even thought it was all that, it really wasn't. It was sort of long and dragging in places.

3716328,4,B001NFNFIK,"I'm pretty bright and can follow a plot line even when things are vague. Although I loved the authenticity of the landscape in this film, as well as the actors, especially Tommy Lee Jones, I found myself confused at times, especially in light of the fact that the dead prostitute cases didn't seem to have much to do with the murder in 1965.  At the end, I still didn't understand completely why the women were killed, or, why the African-American man was killed in 1965.  I know it had been implied in a few conversations along the way that he ""messed with a white man's wife,"" but I wish that someone had explained that whole story in more detail.  I also didn't understand why the man killed the prostitutes.  Was he crazy?  Did they know something?  That wasn't made clear.  I'm sure if I had read the book, it would have all made sense.  In any case, the film was definitely entertaining and Jones was great.  There is something purely mystical about the bayous of Louisiana - so rich in history both bad and good, and teaming with character and culture.  I love films set in this area when they are done well, and like Skeleton Key, this film manages to capture the uniqueness of the area, without making it too over the top.

It's too bad this was only released as a DVD, I think it's missed by most people.  It's a tight little who-done-it, no explosions, no car chases.  The cinematography was great, shot on location in south Louisana.  You get the lush bayous, the sunsets on the water, gritty juke joints, shotgun shacks, and mansions.  We had no trouble following the story, as someone mentioned,  It's not fast-paced, just moves along as needed, as Robicheaux finds the little threads and clues and tries to bring them all together.

3716393,3,B001NFNFIK,"Interesting adaptation of the James Lee Burke novel by the fine French director Bernard Tavernier, starring Tommy Lee Jones. Main problem is the script, which is fairly incoherent -- but then so was the novel. Most interesting thing about Burke's novels is the interior monologue of the main character, Dave Robicheaux -- the action mainly serves as a catalyst for Robicheaux's commentary. In the movie there's minimal voice-over, which ain't the same. One objection: Robicheaux is slipped some LSD in his iced tea and ends up in the hospital after running his truck into a (shallow) ditch and hallucinating up a storm. The hallucinations, and succeeding flashbacks, involve a philosophical dialogue with a dead Civil War general, who'd fought in the area 100 years before. Sorry, Hollywood: those ain't like any LSD hallucinations I ever experienced -- too clean, to coherent. Tavernier does his best with a weak script (& his work is always worth watching -- see ""Round Midnight"" as the best example). And Tommy Lee Jones is probably the best Dave Robicheaux we can expect. I had hoped for more, but it appears Burke is as hard to adapt as Richard Stark (Payback, Point Blank, The Outfit).",1365552000,,1191,4.989949748743719

My son suggested I purchase the 2 movies that were made from the books so I could, perhaps, see some of the things I am planning on looking for on the visit.  This movie was quite good and I will watch it again.  However, this was not my idea of what Dave Robicheaux looks like or acts like.  My idea of what he looks like and acts like is much more like an alcoholic (both drunk and sober depending on the book) Christopher Meloni.

3716396,4,B001NFNFIK,"Frankly, the title almost put me off from trying the film.  It sounded pretentious.  But when the action started, and the plot progressed, I was immersed in the film as I would be by a good novel.

Tommy Lee Jones fills the part well with his stoic simplicity hiding his emotion and anger.  John Goodman is the believable Louisiana crook played broad.  The other actors--including James Gammon in one of his last roles--do a good job of making us believe they are at home in the bayou.

Louisiana is truly a star of this piece, and the scenery alone makes you homesick for a place you may never have been.

The script, dealing with the murders of young women, is not so much driven by a frantic effort to save as the need to overcome evil and provide justice.

Yes, few car chases here and the violence is largely viewed as aftermath.  But I found that I cared about all the characters, and wanted to know what would happen next.

Don't try to ""half-way"" watch this film.  Give it your full attention, or don't bother.  It is as much a moral and human drama as a crime story.

They say this is not the director's cut.  It was still fine for me.  However, I would like to know what else was there.",1365465600,,1196,4.324324324324325

3716449,2,B001NFNFIK,"Tommy Lee Jones plays Dave Robicheaux, a black and white, right or wrong style police detective in Louisiana. Two cases land in his lap at the same time that frustrate him for their lack of evidence. First, someone is killing and mutilating hookers. Second, remains of someone killed 40 years ago are found and Robicheaux believes they are of a black man he actually witnessed being shot when he was a teenager.

His main suspect in the hooker murders is a mobster played by John Goodman which leads him to another man. Robicheaux knows he must be getting closer to the truth when a bullet meant for him kills a young actress his family has befriended and then someone tries to frame him for another killing. In a bizarre scene Robicheaux attends a party where someone spikes his drink with LSD leading him on a trip where he encounters a civil war general. The general appears to him several more times in the movie, seeming to try and help him with his investigations.

In the Electric Mist does not work. The story is not very interesting to begin with, several actors (Mary Steenburgen, Peter Saarsgaard, Ned Beatty) are given few scenes and little to do. Tommy Lee isn't even acting, just being himself. John Goodman tries a little bit but seems to know the movie is a loser so why try too hard? The editing is choppy, the story does not move from scene to scene with any fluidity. The detective's investigations don't seem to lead anywhere but in the end he solves both cases. I read somewhere that a lot of editing was done post production. Maybe somewhere there's a copy of this film that's interesting and makes sense.",1364083200,,1627,4.606896551724138
3716450,4,B001NFNFIK,This book kept me spellbound with all the murders and suspense.  I did not like all the crime by both parties trying to get the right man who did the murders.,1364083200,,158,4.096774193548387

3716453,4,B001NFNFIK,"Tommy Lee Jones is a good actor.  This was not your typical movie of  cops and bad guys. This is what made it good and worth watching.

3716459,4,B001NFNFIK,"Tommy Lee Jones is his usual prepared, talented self in this multiple murder mystery set in post-Katrina New Orleans.  His characterization of dedicated police officer Dave Robicheaux, putting together the pieces of the complicated puzzle which comprises a series of prostitute murders reaching far back into the seemingly unrelated fabric of New Orleans' complicated racist past, while confronting the personal demons recovering alcoholics must face, is believable, many-layered, and sensitive to both sides of the Deep South's troubled, segregationist history.  Credit must also be given to the director and editor for their handling of a series of hallucinatory encounters between Robicheaux and Confederate General John Bell Hood (Levon Helm) after the detective is given a drink laced with LSD.  These scenes could have easily tossed the film into the nether world of unbelievability, but cast and crew handle the difficult task of making these scenes ring true, bringing them surreally to life within the film's plot line and toward its dark conclusion.  Other cast standouts include veteran screen presence Mary Steenburgen--a welcome addition to any film--as his loyal and supportive wife, Peter Sarsgaard as the on-location film star dealing with his own ""battle of the bottle,"" Ned Beatty as influential businessman Twinky Le Moyne, who appears genuinely, though minimally, remorseful for his role in an ancient, apparently Klan-related murder, and especially long-time New Orleans resident John Goodman as the cynical, racketeer-with-a-punch-line, Julie ""Baby Feet"" Balboni, who as journeyman performer has become one of America's most impressive and reliable character actors.  Also watch for famed indie director John Sayles' portrayal of the--what else?--director of the partially mob-produced film around which the plot for IN THE ELECTRIC MIST is set.",1363651200,,1867,5.701438848920863

The photography was very good as was the scenery, accurately depicting southern Louisiana as a wet, hot and muddy part of the US.  Tommy Lee Jones tends to mumble a lot which made the dialogue a little difficult to pick up.  So it wasn't an awful movie but not a great one either.",1363219200,,442,4.353658536585366

3716481,4,B001NFNFIK,"Tavernier's director's cut is far superior to the original Image US release,
which was diced & pruned down to 102 minutes by his studio, much to Tavernier's dismay.
This is his attempt--look for 112 or 117 minute European versions--to deliver the film he thought he had made.
And he makes interesting, fluent, coherent movies--and the ""Directors Edition"" is all of those things.
It's not as resonant as the greatest of Tavernier's work, but at least the longer version
is far more coherent--and more obviously a Tavernier movie.

Tommy Lee Jones did his usual good job playing, in this case, a variation on his sheriff-character in the movie, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. But the script didn't really back him up. In the end it was a bit of a muddle. For all that, if you're in the mood to watch a film and there is nothing else available, ""it's okay"" which is Amazon's 3-star rating. In a conventional rating system, I'd give it 2 1/2 stars and only because of Jones and Steenburgen, who did a credible job as his wife.",1363046400,,598,4.076271186440678

The characters and plot are random and disjointed, and the conclusion is far from a shocking twist. If you're looking for something different and have a few hours to kill, give it a shot and perhaps you'll appreciate it.

3716562,2,B001NFNFIK,Slow development. Paper thin characters and just as thin execution. Tommy Lee Jones might as well have been in a one man play and it probably would have been better.,1361836800,,165,4.533333333333333
3716563,4,B001NFNFIK,"I preferred Jones' portrayal of Dave Robicheaux relative to Baldwin's. He knows the subtleties of a southern man. The cast in general is good and the adaptation doesn't stray far and is well directed. If you are a fan of James Lee Burke, you will probably enjoy this movie.

If you don't now of Burke's work, but enjoy a flawed protagonist, colorful characters, connected criminals and Louisianan idiosyncrasies, you might enjoy this movie, give it a try while it is available on Prime and you could become a fan.",1361836800,,513,4.764044943820225
3716564,2,B001NFNFIK,"This is the second adapatation of James  Lee  Burke's  powerful
  storytelling.

  Burke, a  total  American Master,  knows much about living,  and
  life  in  America, and  takes us fans  in to  a  world  of dread,
  and  rising  paranoia  in his original  novel: "" In The  Electric
  Mist  with  Confederate  Dead"".

  Bertrand  Tavernier, usually  a  pretty  good  director  and raconteur,
  falls  desperately  short  of  Burke's  mark,  as  he attempts  to
  adapt  Burke's  thriller.  There are  brilliant  sequences  in  Burke's
  novel of greed, revenge  and  redemption, that  involve  Detective
  Robicheaux  having  conversations with a  REAL  Confederate  General !

  In the novel, Robicheaux is  guided,  morally, by this phantasm.

  Not  here.

  Tommy  Lee  Jones  is  hugely  miscast as  Dave Robicheaux, a  New Iberia
  Parish,  Louisiana  Sheriff's  Department  Detective.

  Jones  has  the weathered  look  of  age  and crepitude  of  the
  Robicheaux  we've  read  about  in  Burke's  many  novels,  but
  Jones'  interpretation  of  our ( unlikely) hero,  is  shallow, and
  pseudo - gritty.

  This  Robicheaux is  ""Robicheaux  Lite"".  Jones  plays a  depthless,
  one-dimensional  guy  who  is  just  lost in a  booze-laden  dream-
  world.

  The  real  Robicheaux,  is a  recovering  alcoholic,  hard-working,
  sensitive, loving,  with an  adopted  daughter,  and  a  second  wife,
  a  former  nun,  who is  long-suffering,  and  is a  ""stand-by-your-
  man""  kind  of  a  girl.

  Tavernier's  rocket  fails  to  ignite  at  the  lunch  pad,  folks.

  Find  the  book, or  even  better, look in  AMAZON.COM  for  the  AUDIO-
  BOOK, professionally  read by Mister  Will Patton.

  The  audio  book  is  FIVE  STARS  OUT OF  FIVE.

  I  can  think of  about  twenty  directors  who  would  have  given
  Burke's  treatment of Louisiana  heros  and  villains  a  better
  send-off.

  Sorry....two  stars.

This movie had an attractive star lineup, with a story situated in Lousiana's Bayou - all elements that make one to expect a quality movie.  But, not this one.

This movie revolves around a sheriff who is in search of a serial killer that goes around killing young women in Lousiana.  There is no plot per se:  The sheriff just goes around beats up people to get clues.  Also, a civil war era general mysteriously appears to give sound advice to the sheriff from time to time.

Having lived in Louisiana and traveled extensivley in South Louisiana over the years, I have a lot of affection for the Cajun atmosphere. Tommy Lee Jones plays a small town lawman trying to solve the murder of a woman that leads him on a frustrating path that leaves the viewer puzzled in places when you wonder what isn't being said.

At any rate, Tommy Lee prevails and gets his man in the end. Meanwhile, we get to follow along with him as he does his homework. How he came to some of his conclusions, however, are not all that clear. Since he is native to the area and is known by everyone, that's where the missing dots come into play.

Still, I found it to be an entertaining film, if not Tommy Lee's best effort.",1360713600,,805,4.254901960784314
3716637,5,B001NFNFIK,"As has been so well commented upon by some other reviewers, this movie is soooooo faithful (and appropriately so) to Burke's novel and his characters, as well as his hero's (?) always so justified outrage and railing at the morally corrupt, who ALWAYS just happen to be wealthy!  Sort of suggests that Burke is setting up straw men in order to express his hostility to authority and the wealth of others, doesn't it?  Nevertheless, I love his so expressive and (if you could call it that given his profane brutality) elegant narrative!  And this is so well carried over into this movie, both the elegance and the profane brutality.  As you can tell, I loved the book, and I loved the movie.

As has also been commented here, the movie suffers greatly, as a stand alone piece, through the total absence of introducing the characters (Bootsie, Tripod, etc) to the viewer who is not familiar with his writing - the family members and other important characters simply appear!  I intend recommending this to others, but only (if they are interested) if I have an opportunity to give them an introduction.

This is about all I have to say, because of already excellent reviews written by so many others here, except that I believe (and agree with others) that Tommy Lee Jones was so ideally and wonderfully cast in the main role.  Of course, I am bigoted about Jones - I would watch him eating toast, and commenting upon it, even if he did nothing else!",1360713600,,1448,4.650980392156863

My husband is checking with how we have things set up but I think this was just a trailer.  It was all Tommy Lee Jones ""style"" if you will, my kind of guy.

In anticipation of watching the movie I had invited 4 friends, all ""hardcore"" fans of the Robicheaux
series.  After the scene featuring Dave's conversation with The Colonial the CD player was turned off,
no point in going forward with this abomination.
For the longest I could not understand the shortening of the title, dropping the ""With Confederate Dead""
portion.  Now I would imagine it was an attempt to seperate the movie from the book.  If one had not
read the original book they would find it difficult to follow the plot of the movie.  The actors all
appeared to be reading their lines, there is no emotion shown, and a awful lot of mumbling.  On the
back of the CD box it states that the movie is based on the book, they should add LOOSELY based on
the book.
As much as I look forward to James Lee Burke publishing another novel I truly hope there are no more
attempts to bring them to the screen if this is an example of finished product.

The Robicheaux character is classic. Love the setting of the bayou, the swamps. that culture and the overhang of the misty murkiness of the atmosphere is brilliant, making everything appear as an illusion, a dream. Most of the really awful stuff happens off screen, the focus is more on the characters; the cast is excellent, Jones is so real and the solving of the crime isn't a cause for celebration, really, more like an opportunity for acceptance of reality as seen through Robicheaux's jaded, soulful eyes.

I have never been to the U.S. much less that part of the country,but I had no trouble 'getting into' this movie. After about 20 minutes I was completely hooked and did not stir from my chair until it was finished. I have just been reading the reviews of some of the U.S. viewers,most of whom said that if you have not read any of the books,you will have trouble understanding the film. Well,I have not read any of the books,but had no trouble following the plotlines and characters in the film.
Perhaps if these people actually concentrated on what was unfolding on their screens,they would do better.(I have the advantage of living by myself,so when I sit down to watch a movie,I have no distractions;perhaps that is the secret).Your reviewers also made the point that the version released in the U.S. was the shorter,theatrical cut -102 minutes - & not the Director's Cut. Well the Blu-ray release in Australia has both cuts of the film and the version I watched this morning was the longer Director's Cut at 117 mins. I have yet to watch the shorter 102 min.version,which is also on the same Blu-ray released in Australia.(Perhaps your reviewers should import the Australian Blu-ray release).The only complaint I have with the longer version is that it has only a stereo soundtrack whereas the Theatrical Release on the Blu-ray has a 5.1 audio track. As I have a very good 5.1 Surround Sound setup,I was a little disappointed in that,however,it is a good stereo mix. I loved the music as I am a great fan of Delta Blues and Cajun & Zydeco music,so I am now going to look for the CD soundtrack. I loved Levon Helm & Buddy Guy in their roles. I was disappointed to read that there was friction between the Director,Producers  and Tommy Lee Jones;I guess there won't be any more in the series. That is disappointing.

3716738,2,B001NFNFIK,"I have read several novels by James Lee Burke; none were especially good, but rather average--in its own way average is a compliment since most novels, mystery or otherwise, are really mediocre, if not just plain execrable. This movie is lifted with almost complete fidelity from his novel and the movie suffers from a stasis in which the plot moves forward not at all or slowly. Tommy Lee Jones acts as if his questionable charisma is all that is needed to make a film work well. The lack of any forward propulsion of the plot in many scenes in the movie is frustrating for the viewer. The first half-hour, which should ""hook"" us into watching the film, is a non-starter: slow and boring. Back to Jones for one final comment: he has acted well in some movies, most particularly No Country For Old Men. But in this film he has a solid and credible context in which to act out his character. It doesn't hurt that this film is very good, largely because it is faithfully based on a novel by the profoundly good novelist Cormac MacCarthy.
  Ultimately, a movie must be judged by narrative success (a movie is not a static painting or sculpture).  In this regard, the movie must inexorably be judged a failure. It is shallow and will
disappoint viewers who want to be drawn into a movie that has something to say.",1331164800,,1309,4.538135593220339

3716740,4,B001NFNFIK,"If you're a James Lee Burke fan you'll love this movie.  Tommy Lee plays a great 'Dave Robicheaux' though Mary Steenburgen is little used as Bootsie.  I was a little ticked off to see that the movie version of 'Tripod' had all four legs. (Couldn't they find a Veterinarian willing to help with continuity?) John Goodman plays 'Baby Feet' and looks like he really enjoyed the part.

The film is a gift to the writer's fans.  Shot in New Iberia and Teche Bayou. People unfamiliar with Burke might find the film a bit disjointed and some of the characters are poorly developed (like Alafair, Dave's daughter) Heck, Cletus Purcell never even makes an appearance.

Beautifully shot on HD you get a real feel for the country and towns.  Tommy Lee is superior to Alec Baldwin's version of Robicheaux in the 1996 'Heaven's Prisoners'. After seeing the film my wife and I drove from Florida to Teche Bayou.  We found the Teche Motel where they shot the scene where Robicheaux's buddy allegedly kills himself. Spent the night in the same cottage (#12) and loved every minute of it.  The motel owner's name is Rosebud.  Just tell her you want to stay where those 'Movie People' were.  $40 a night to be part of filmdom. Rosebud will excitedly tell you the whole story.  Apparently she and Tommy Lee are on a first name basis.

Tommy Lee Jones perfectly brings to life the dreams of every James Lee Burke reader as Dave Robicheaux. He's the guy we'd all have cast. But then, he's a dead ringer for author James Burke, no surprise. I find the JLB books ultimately well-crafted but just a mite bit depressing - nobody in them ever seems to grow, and that's the essence of a soul-satisfying flick. What Women Think, for example. Mel Gibson's character is a perfect A.H. the way he treats women. After falling in a bath tub with a hair dryer, he can hear women's thoughts. His heart expands to embrace their realities, and he becomes a better man. Makes us feel good. Ancient sage of East say: Expansion of Awareness Equals Happiness. Nothing like that happens in the JLB books, alas. Dave R remains an irritable though well-intentioned son of a gun whose flaws disappoint us.

I looked forward to seeing this, partly because of the cast, but also because there has been a pretty good record as of late with studios taking the books of well honed American authors and turning them into films.

This is a hit and miss. Tommy Lee Jones, John Goodman, Peter Sarsgaard and Mary Steenburgen are only part of a large and well seasoned cast. The director, Bertrand Tavernier is also well seasoned with 33 films to his credit, but somehow this project doesn't hang together.

Here's the scoop. Set in Louisiana, Tommy Lee plays a police captain who is ready to bust Sarsgaard, a Hollywood actor in town for a film shoot, on a DUI. To avoid said DUI Peter leads Tommy to an area of the swamp where he spotted a corpse shackled in chains. Even though the body has been dead since the 60s Tommy wants to investigate. Meanwhile, a young prostitute from town is murdered and Tommy wants to make the connection between the two which leads him to investigate all manner of unseemly persons.

Nearly every scene in this movie was written and acted extremely well. A lot of really cool things happened in the plotting. Most of the characters, even the secondary ones, had a lot of personality, but it all failed to dovetail. Like the dead guy in chains. He's what started the whole thing off but very little is done in regard to that part of the story. And it didn't build up tension. It kept a generally even keel throughout. This might be truer to how real life is but it doesn't make for exciting movies.

Let's say that the story moves along with a sense of stately grace perfectly at home with the Old South themes and settings.

The cast is outstanding. Tommy Lee Jones and John Goodman pick up any film, and Peter Sarsgaard does a masterful job as the rich, alcoholic film actor with an irrepressible enthusiasm and absolutely no clue just how dangerous his behavior is.

The movie is gritty and sordid at times. Even if the worst visuals stay a good bit shy of what other films might try to gross you out with, here they make sure that the dialog fills you in on anything they may have spared your eyes. The reaction of the man who swears off ever looking into a mysterious barrel again is real, and chilling, for example.

3716802,4,B001NFNFIK,"I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of this film- I can often take or leave Tommy Lee Jones, as he so often plays the gruff-yet-philosophical-Southerner type and could almost be accused of the Robin WIlliams syndrome- too many of the same sort of roles (tho Robin has busted right out of that prison with a handful of well-done psycho roles). But I remembered why I essentially enjoy him as an actor, because nobody can do the gruff-yet-philosophical number as well as he.

First off, as a Southerner, I was very happy to see some intelligence accorded to the natives. Yeah, there are your usual white trash folk here, but that is a reality- prodigious use of the ""n"" word, lots of beer drinking and fishing, etc- and to pretend that doesn't exist would be false. But I very much enjoyed both Jones' lyrical way of talking as well as Levon Helm's Civil War general- and I won't say much beyond that lest i give it away. Naturally this is based on a novel so I can only say that the screen adaption has made me mightily curious to read the book, as it has a lot of depth and a surprising amount of heart.

The one flaw the film had was the perplexing use of people who couldn't act in supporting roles. Some of the local types seemed like they were reading off cue cards, and Buddy Guy, bless him, has plenty enough talent without having to prove that he can act, which i am sad to say, he can't. There was also a little bit of an overdose on the folksy wisdom a time or two, but I found most of the film surprising. I was definitely surprised and it exceeded my expectations. I would call this a supernatural mystery, and I wish more of them were set in the bayous- a haunted place if there ever was one.",1298073600,,1703,4.302180685358255
3716803,2,B001NFNFIK,"`In The Electric Mist' is a weak murder mystery crime thriller starring Tommy Lee Jones. From the word go this had a `made for TV' quality about it, whether it be from the cheap and dated soundtrack or the wooden acting from the townsfolk supporting cast; pretty soon into this film you realise that this isn't going to be ground breaking stuff. Lee Jones is definitely acting by rote here and there is a lack of passion throughout. It doesn't live up to his usual high standards. This had a slow start and little hook or drama and the terrible dialogue made me cringe at numerous times whilst watching. By the time the film ends you are hoping for some kind of twist or shock ending, but instead you get very little coherence between scarce plot lines and not a great deal left of the story that bears any relation to anything else. There is no real motive or back story to the murderers actions and you are left doubting the credibility of the entire film. As you can see there isn't a great deal to commend this film for and to be honest you can miss this and not worry in the slightest. Watch this if nothing else is on (or buy it if you have money burning a hole in your pocket), but otherwise check out something else to pass your time.

I say this as a fan of James Lee Burke--and there's the rub: If you haven't read the Robicheaux books, you will be mystified by this film. The characters from the books are not introduced to the viewer; they simply appear--and you have no idea who they are or why they're significant to Robicheaux.

I also got very tired of Hollywood actors doing fake Louisiana accents (Tommy Lee Jones gets a pass). The requisite blues soundtrack is good. The cinematography captures the flavor of Cajun territory. But somehow it all ends up seeming contrived--like Hollywood's version of Louisiana.

Burke's books are complex, involving many, many characters and subplots, and the film tries to include everything. The end result is confusion. From one scene to the next, you're wondering exactly what is going on.

All films are obviously artificial, but good films make you forget the artifice, even those made from books (_No Country for Old Men_ comes to mind). In this film, the artifice is in your face.

I loved this film.
From the very beginning, ""In the Electric Mist"" draws you into an irresistible embrace and never lets go.  Every acting performance is spot-on, and the dubious culture of the Louisiana Bayou ebbs from every facet of the story.  I also need to mention the excellent soundtrack by Marco Beltrami; it is so powerful that it should be considered a character unto itself. There is a song played during the end credits that is truly one of the most beautiful songs you will ever hear.
Seriously, a great movie.
That being said, when I logged onto Amazon, I was surprised to see many reviewers voicing the opinion that this film's appeal is limited mainly to fans of the book.  It's true that ""In the Electric Mist"" leaves a lot to the imagination, but ambiguity and convolution are two very different things.

Louisiana is strange by definition but the crimes in that place on the bayou are more than strange, they are bizarre, frightening too. The killing of several girls leads to some kind of pervert who provides himself with some kind of absolutely clandestine mission. But his interest is also to work for some white money men who are in business and in many other activities under the table and even under the water, and behind the screen, the big screen of the cinema. Another murder comes up, after vtwenty years or more of rotting in the bayou, a black man who managed to be the lover of the wife of one of these few white business men whose business is shady even if their complexion is rosy. The cop has to go through all kinds of forms of intimidation, right out and right away violence and physical or police pressure. He just goes on to the end. He uses some methods that are not entirely correct but the result is the same: justice, and in this case his justice is justice, though not exactly in a court of justice, rather in the back of justice. The rhythm is also slightly slow. The best part is the haunting vision of some southern confederate general more or less playing hooky with our crime stories. But that's only a touch of naivet and superstition. The whole thing is the best American French film, or is it the best French American film, I have seen for a while. It takes a certain Bertrand Tavernier to do that kind of a miracle or is it a prodigious happening?

I really did. I found ""In The Electric Mist"" to be a very compelling story - powerful acted and cleverly told. And something of undiscovered gem.

Once again Tommy Lee Jones as the haggard and troubled lead - just stuns - his depth and power fill the screen absolutely all of the time. Credit must also go to the uniformly superb supporting cast too (even if in some cases they don't get a lot to do) - John Goodman, Peter Sarsgaard, Mary Steenburgen, Ned Beatty, Kelly MacDonald, Pruitt Taylor-Vince, Justina Machado and even Buddy Guy (the blues guitar player) - all good. And then there's Levon Helm of the famous Americana rock group THE BAND as the ghost of a Confederate General - adding extraordinary old-world gravitas and mystery to the piece.

The Blu Ray print is BEAUTIFUL too - even in the dark interiors - but especially in the outdoor swamp shots and town houses. Disappointingly though, there are precious few extras.

Bertrand Tavernier's film isn't a masterpiece for sure, and it's perhaps just a little 'too' in love with its own gumbo and Louisiana scenery, but I found it immensely moving in places - and awkwardly real - especially on the core subject of racism and its still lingering malevolent presence (the title of this review is a rumination by one of the characters on that subject when a dead body from 1965 comes back to haunt him).

Based on the James Lee Burke novel ""In the Electric Mist with Confederate Dead"", the movie finds Burke's Cajun detective Dave Robicheaux once again hot on the trail of a brutal killer. In addition to dealing with the current killing of a young prostitute, Robicheaux must address troubling memories of a murder he witnessed more than 40 years ago as a boy. Throw in for good measure his daily grapple with alcoholism and bizarre visions of conversations with Civil War Confederate General John Bell Hood, who at best gives convoluted advice. Robicheaux (and the viewer) must decide if General Hood's presence in his life is represented by simple reveries brought on by alcohol, or a very real manifestation of the dead coming back to life in order to right a wrong. The latter assertion seems feasable, when one considers the mystical ethic of rural Louisiana where the story unfolds (focus on the last scene of the film for corroboration). Tommy Lee Jones is brilliant as the troubled, flawed, yet highly effective Robicheaux. One can't think of a better choice of actor.

Yes the movie is more slow paced than the usual action genre so prevalent in today's market but every once in a while we need to see something more on the screen than spectacular car chases.  Tommy Lee Jones is outstanding in this as he is in virtually everything he does.  The only time I had a problem with his casting was when he takes on a man far bigger, younger and stronger than he and manages to kick his butt.  Jones is completely out of breath at the end of the sequence and the ""this is a movie"" feel of the scene was patently evident.  Otherwise, casting is superb throughout.

My absolute favorite moment was when Lee's character was interviewing a poor water man from the back bayous who had discovered a corpse in a drum.  The man's accent and speech was absolutely perfect.  It took me right back home to the deep South as very few other movies have.

At moments his prose soars to near-poetry, his insights into humanity's greatness and smallness are impressive, as are his descriptions of the physical world his characters inhabit. ""In the Electric Mist With Confederate Dead"" is one of my favorite Dave Robicheaux novels, and I was pleased to learn that Tommy Lee Jones was starring in a film version of it. Unfortunately, ""In the Electric Mist,"" as the movie is called, was a little disappoining. The script actually follows the novel very closely, and it was easy to see that Jones, the scriptwriters and director all had an affection (and respect) for the material, which I appreciated. But the movie's faithfulness to the book may have been, I think, part of the problem. There were simply too many characters and scenes in the novel to put into a less than 2-hour film for the finished product to be as effective as it might. Tommy Lee Jones turned in a fine performance as the angst-ridden, but formidable Robicheaux and John Goodman was good as Baby Feet Balboni.

3716872,5,B001NFNFIK,"Burke's Robicheaux novels are complex, deeply evocative police thrillers set (with exceptions) in the bayou counties around New Orleans. The lead character tries to balance a deep intelligence, an unflinching commitment to justice, deep religious and family impulses, and a facility with violence which Burke presents as alternatively liberating and damning. The bayou emerges in the novels as subtle, colorful, human, a little threatening, and poised uncomfortably between a past flush with horror and a questionable, ominous future. (The stories which Burke sets in Montana deal with the geography very differently.)

This uncomfortable balance is at the heart of the Robicheaux stories, none more so than the novel on which this movie is based. At first, it's hard to imagine a less likely novel for adaptation as a Hollywood release. Burke's novels are first rate mysteries and detective stories, but they take the conventions of noir storytelling much deeper than most in his genre have done.  Given the inevitable limitation of a two hour movie in capturing the nuances available to a first-person narrator in a 300 page book, this film does an extraordinary job of capturing Robicheaux, the complexities of his character, and the haunting pull of the bayou (and southern) past which forms the background of a story of multiple murders.

Tommie Lee Jones provides an understated and utterly convincing portrait of Robicheaux, perhaps a definitive one, and he's surrounded by an extraordinary cast no less adept at economically presenting characters on both sides of the good and evil divide.

The movie is a remarkable accomplishment. It does not fully capture the book (read the book and you'll see why), but it takes the central metaphor in the book--the 'living' presence of the Confederate dead, with all that they represent--and refocuses the symbol into the presence of John Bell Hood (played beautifully by Levon Helm).  The very last scene in the film takes one further step in this refocusing, one that gilds the lily unnecessarily, but it's a forgivable and brief excess in a project which succeeds as a top-flight noir crime story, an action-adventure tale, a regional portrait, and a case study of how brilliant actors do their jobs.

The story was entertaining despite being confusing, and maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I had read the actual book first. I don't know...I think the producers were trying too hard. I got the gist of all the story lines, but I think this could have been done better and neater. Glad it was only a dollar rental.",1243209600,2,1077,4.279411764705882

Although I wouldn't have chosen Tommy Lee Jones to play Dave Robicheaux, the New Orleans, detective, Jones does an excellent job, managing to convey Robicheaux's daily internal battle with alcohol along with an intense personality and sense of justice. Goodman plays mobster Baby Feet Balboni with finesse and the Cajun milieu is a strong component to this mystery. Although it lagged at times, all in all, I thought it was a good film.

The book is better simply because Burke is so good at revealing characters' personas layer by layer. Robicheaux's wife is an interesting character, but in this film, she's a very minor player and actually seems more of a backdrop than anything else.",1242518400,,739,4.865079365079365
3716891,4,B001NFNFIK,"Most reviews we've seen for ""In The Electric Mist"" by professional ""Film Critics"" are way off! It is really a good flick; both my husband and I absolutely loved it. Great plot with just the right combo of suspense and weirdness; a fine all around experience. And, Louisiana's characters and many charms ooze throughout the plot in a mesmerizing fashion fueled by a stellar soundtrack.  Never heard of the film when we netflixed it; but subsequently ordered our own copy! Can't believe it hadn't been promoted, especially after seeing some of the absolute schlock that is foisted on us! Hadn't heard of the book it was based on either, just saw the title and thought it sounded interesting. Now we're Robicheaux fans and even have books to prove it.
Tommy Lee Jones is always a pleaser, and Levon Helm as Hood was truly some inspired casting.  And when they get to putting out a soundtrack, or at least a compilation CD of music that was used, we're in line! If there isn't one out there already, someone ought to jump on it because it would sell.",1242000000,,1046,4.618279569892473
3716892,5,B001NFNFIK,"What can you say about a mystery movie with two dead bodies in the first first fifteen minutes?  There's quite a contrast as well.  The first is a young woman eviscerated by her killer and the second is a 40 year old crime, a Black man who a young Dave Robicheaux saw killed on the bayou forty years before and didn't report.

That's just for starters.  Movies have come to Dave Robicheaux's (Tommy Lee Jones) Louisiana parish.  Actors Elrod Sykes (Peter Sarsgaard) and Kelly Drummond (Kelly Macdonald) are filming a Civil War battle epic. Unfortunately, Elrod has a drinking and drug problem. And, interestingly enough, their appearance has unearthed the ghost of Civil War General General John Bell Hood (Levon Helm) who's acting as an advisor to Dave.

Of course, we've got the local troublemakers. Mobster Julie 'Baby Feet' Balboni (John Goodman) is producing the film and might just be killing young women.

I admit, often while reading a book, I'm daydreaming my own movies while the pages turn.  I couldn't have asked for a better Dave than Tommy Lee Jones.  He walks the walk and talks the talk as they say.  His supporting cast was excellent as well.  Levon Helm as the General was a touch of genius.  So was Buddy Guy, one of the greatest bluesmen around, as Sam.  I honestly cannot imagine why this film didn't make it to the theatres.  Leonard Maltin called it 'flawed' but I admitted he'd rather see a flawed film that's otherwise well done than a perfect one that just doesn't work.  I didn't see the flaws Mr. Maltin did, but I can say this film definitely did work and I'm glad I purchased it.  Hoping there will be more of Jones as Robicheaux coming soon!

3716895,1,B001NFNFIK,"(1.) An editors paradise where the director filmed a lot of scenes and then handed the entire mess to a studio editor and said, ""Assemble something out of this mishmash that makes a little sense and lasts 90 minutes."" e.g. countless scenes where one event is happening like a monotonous distant shot of Jones in a car on a dirt road which then suddenly jumps to Jones talking to someone on a porch. Half the movie consists of these disruptively annoying Star Trek transporter events.
(2.) Very cheaply produced -  a couple of cars, a couple of houses (including stock footage of houses after hurricane Katrina) and a tavern with endless scenes of the actors transporting around between them.
(3.) Nothing in this movie is deeply developed including characters and crime scenes. We know little or nothing about who each person really is. We never see a crime (too expensive to do well to be filmed) only a vague after-the-fact result such as a barrel filled with crabs which is suppose to also contain a body.
(4.) Acting -  please! Another example of actors as they get old, lazy and fat not willing to do the work needed to produce memorable results. Just another quick paycheck. The entire script was composed of stock, my turn - your turn, one line monologues.
(5.) Poor accuracy and research e.g. a Louisiana swamp doesn't contain ""sandbars"" as was mentioned many times in the movie. There may be sand but it's covered by many feet of organic detritus and plants.",1241049600,11,1467,4.7265625
3716896,5,B001NFNFIK,"I've just seen this film in a French cinema and was surprised to read about the problems between Bertrand Tavernier and Tommy Lee Jones. BTW, I recently went along to a lecture Bertrand Tavernier gave about the unknown underground 50s and 60s American films that inspired the French Nouvelle Vague. Tavernier is a smart man (when speaking French!). What he had to say and show was extremely interesting, subtle. But he talks a lot and I gather he doesn't know when to stop talking when he likes something. The organisers had to stop him talking! I've read that Tommy Lee Jones is a quiet, understating man, who says very little to his actors as director. Maybe this is why they couldn't get along? Did Tavernier bore Tommy? At the end of the day, the fruit of the labour is what counts. And this film is, for me, an artistic success. Tommy Lee Jones is excellent and the film is almost like the third part of a trilogy: 3 Funerals, No Country and Electric Mist.

The story is a bit of a winding non event. Do not watch the trailor, they tell you the whole film (the distributors must think their audiences are idiots) But the mood and lingering scent of southern culture in this film is very powerful. They really succeeded in getting a smell and texture into this film. You can almost taste the southern wind. I walked away haunted by this film. No such thing as time. If you like cinema, then definitely have a look. Preferably on a big screen.",1241049600,,1446,4.498098859315589
3716917,3,B001NFNFIK,"This film marks the second time novelist James Lee Burke's Cajun detective Dave Robicheaux has been brought to film, the first being Alec Baldwin's remarkably un-Cajun version in ""Heaven's Prisoners"" back in 1996.  The first film was solid, but it wasn't quite the magic a series needs to launch, nor did it capture critics or audience.  This film doesn't fare much better, but not for the same reasons.

James Lee Burke's gift as a writer isn't complex mysteries, but complex characters and a poetic way of describing Louisiana country.  Only one of these gifts (cinematography) tends to resonate well in a film of what we've come to consider ""average"" length.  So things that propel his novels, like Dave's inner monologues, are mostly cast aside and when they do appear they come off as expositional and flat.

Another thing that works against these adaptations is their endings, which is not their fault.  Burke's villains are clear, not very mysterious, and the endings are fairly stock.  They work in the book because the book is mostly a character study of its protagonist.  When applied to these films, however, this tact feels anti-climactic.

It also bears pointing out that neither of these films features a key fun element: Dave's right-hand man Clet Purcell (a role many Burke fans thought Goodman would be perfect for), which is in keeping with their respective titles, but does lose some of the magic of better books in the series.  Neither of these books reflects the highest moments of the series overall, so they're hard-pressed to launch the films they become into the stratosphere (and in the case of In the Electric Mist, even into US. theaters).  This adapatation is also hurt by a very unlikely source: the Will Patton-read audiobooks.  Patton does such a phenomenal job capturing the tone and characterizations of Burke's world that it's hard not to see Robicheaux as Patton (who I was bucking for Hollywood to hire, but knew it was unlikely).  I kept peeking around the corners, waiting for that perfect gravely voice to lay it all out for me, but it never came.

Electric Mist has plain direction and largely feels like an homage and not an interpretation.  The director's (Bertrand Tavernier doing his first U.S. made film) love of American crime novels is no secret, but parts of this film come off as mild fan fiction:  I love me some Buddy guy, but he can't act.  Levon Helm has some pedigree, but never made his bread and butter off of acting either, and in such an understated role here, it shows.  These are vanity choices by a director enamored of American icons, not American acting.  The people in this film that can act are largely being restrained in the name of understated performances.  Even the big bad guy loses a key scene in the book where he takes a shot at Dave (batter up!) and with little else to hang his menace on, John Goodman just comes off like a storm cloud with no rain in it.  I credit the crew with largely sticking to the book and avoiding knee-jerk Hollywood-isms, like trying to explain the ethnicity of Dave's child or back track through half a dozen books for back story.

For all intents and purposes you could watch these films back-to-back and get a nice snapshot of Burke's world, even if the characterizations of the lead are vastly different.  It's interesting to see how different the acting is in roles that cross both films. Some of it is better in the first film (Badja Jola as Batist is way more engaging than Walter Breaux, and Hawthorne James is more menacing than any of the villains in Electric Mist).  Jones is a better Dave.  Mix it up and you'd have had a better film all around.

There are great movies that could be made of Burke's books.  Putting more surgical directors on the job would be a good place to start; picking the right book is a close second.  Somewhere between the moodiness of the first film and the clean lines of the second is a great adaptation worthy of launching a series.  And at this point, I'm down with Tommy Lee Jones doing it across the board.  He's got the grit and the soul, even if he does slip into typical Tommy Lee Jones stoicism a lot more than Robicheaux might warrant.

It's a linear detective story that holds the attention nicely.  Based on the James Lee Burke novel, it offers some of the atmospherics that are the hallmark of Burke's art; it also has some Burkean lines thrown in for good measure.  The casting is (finally) excellent, with Tommy Lee Jones as Dave and other stalwarts like John Goodman, Ned Beatty and the wonderful Buddy Guy.  Those who are unfamiliar with the Robicheaux novels may find themselves struggling to catch up, though there are various exposition points which help fill in the blanks.  The film (like the book) includes scenes in which an LSD-doped Dave begins talking to confederate warriors (here, in particular, John Bell Hood).  This translates to 'magic realism' in the book and here the magic is in Levon Helm's performance as Hood.

The Burke novels are so richly textured that the film seems somewhat lean, but it is better to attempt to capture some of the novels' atmosphere than to abandon the attempt.  Jonathan Kellerman has called Burke the Faulkner of crime fiction and here we get a hint of what that means.  The old south and the new converge in a haunted tale in which Dave himself, as a child, played a part.

The sets are excellent, particularly the brief post-Katrina glimpse of New Orleans.  Dave's house and bait shop are just as we would imagine them.  So too are the dingy bars on the back roads of New Iberia.  We even get a glimpse of Alafair's three-legged raccoon, Tripod.

Dave is a man of honor who lives by his own code giving fits to his superiors and absolute grief to the hucksters, thieves, murderers and criminals he has no compunction about hunting down and kicking the living daylights of or dispatching to eternity when appropriate.

As to the movie, it is well done by an old master, Travenier, but I probably enjoyed it more than some would, having read all of Burke's Robicheaux books and therefore fully versed on all the backstories of the supporting characters.  Native of New Orleans, John Goodman fits in here perfectly, and the rest of the cast is fine.  The only character missing in this story is Dave's partner Clete, who is even more prone to unexpected violence and trouble-making than Dave.

At any rate, as a fan of the books and the characters and having followed the arcs of their lives I thoroughly enjoyed seeing them fleshed out in film.

3716936,4,B001NFNFIK,"I consider, 'In The Electric Mist With The Confederate Dead,' released in 1993, some of the best of Burke---and his character, Robicheaux. I had the opportunity to listen to the book, way back then, on tape.  Now this was not the 'usual' audio book.  It was complete with eerie sound effects and so expertly done, that my family camped out in the living room, turned out all the lights and we made an evening out of this extraordinary tale.

While I don't believe this movie adaptation, 'In the Electric Mist, holds a candle to that first experience, it still provided a great visit, with characters that I came to love, over a decade and a half ago. It was this previous introduction that turned me on to Burke and destined me to become a loyal, forever fan.

I'm not sure why, but I've always rather envisioned Robicheaux's character to look something like the dark, craggy, and grumpy, Kinky Friedman. And in real life, he rather does. However, if given a list of potential actors, I would have placed Tommy Lee Jones on the short list, for some of the same physical characteristics. I was able to completely identify him with the role, although I could have used a tad more accent.

Robicheaux is an alcoholic, struggling to stay in remission, with many skeletons in his closet, including witnessing a black man being gunned down in the swamps, many years previously---something he chose to remain silent about.  He can no longer remain in denial, when a member of a filming crew working in the swamps, comes across the bones.  In the midst of this event, grizzly murders of prostitutes begin to take place---murders he would love to pin on his sleazy nemesis, the mobster, played by John Goodman.

The character who plays Robicheaux's daughter, Alafair, provides some nail-biting moments toward the end of the movie, as well. To digress, I've always loved the way Burke's real daughter is named Alafair and the way he sets up such a bond between Alafair and Robicheaux, in all of his work. I find this sweet and endearing.

As Robicheaux begins his investigations, he has hallucinogenic encounters with a troop of Confederate Soldiers, under the famous John Bell Hood. Hood becomes Robicheaux's ghostly sub-conscience, offering insights into seeking and finding truth---an all knowing wisdom, from the grave.

The movie is not high on budget and in some respects, it looks almost like a made for TV drama.  However, they still managed to capture the mysterious Cajun atmosphere, making you feel you might just have to start swatting skeeters. I wish there had been more development of the supernatural aspects---the war, the soldiers.  In the book and audio version, this was hair-raisingly spooky, but not so much in this movie.

There were a couple of superficial mentions of Katrina, bringing us more up to the moment with Louisiana, which felt a little out of place, because we were dealing with another place and time, with the original story.  Besides, Burke's 'The Tin Roof Blowdown,' is where he excels in describing his beloved New Orleans, post Katrina.

I agree, you don't have to have read the book to enjoy this mystery/drama. There's plenty of suspense, reminders of the devastation of war, prejudice and corruption.  It's also contemplative, ensuring we can't run from our demons; that anesthesia through alcohol, won't extinguish the omission of truth, or responsibility.",1237593600,3,3392,4.934973637961336

If you enjoy Mr. Jones's characters from other law enforcement movies of the past you will probably like this as well. I can not speak to the integrity of the story as it relates to the author's book but it was an enjoyable movie non the less.",1236988800,,698,4.2727272727272725
3716951,4,B001NFNFIK,"I stumbled on this treatment of James Lee Burke's ""In The Electric Mist With Confederate Dead"" on a Netflix order--I had not even known the movie was being filmed nor that it had been released straight to video. Being a devoted reader of everything Burke writes and particularly of his Dave Robicheaux series, I immediately ordered and viewed it.

""In The Electric Mist"" gets a lot right and less wrong.  Yes the plot has holes in this version and yes, some of the characterizations will be less than fleshed out for non Burke fans.  But this is also a strength in that this film has more resonance with the poetic visions that Burke paints in his words than certainly ""Heaven's Prisoners"" did.

It is atmospheric and moody; indeed it was filmed in the murky depths of Louisiana parishes and bayous.  The cinematography is startling at time with wonderful panoramas of deep and textured colors that make the viewer think the scenes must be painted. The characters, whether extras in the background or featured leads, are believable and reflective of the area.  The much appreciated background music is filled with moody Cajun, blues, and zydeco sounds that again are reflective of the Louisiana milieu.

The casting was inspired from Tommy Lee Jones as Dave Robicheaux to John Goodman as a malevolent Southern mobster to Levon Helm as the Confederate General, John Bell Hood.  Mary Steenburgen does well in an underwritten role as Dave's supportive wife.  Having traveled a lot in the New Orleans and Louisiana areas, I was very satisfied with the portrayals of the characters and the places.

Lastly, the video was relatively faithful to Burke's depiction of Dave Robicheaux, especially his deep and continuing self introspection that often approaches cynicism but also ultimately values redemption of the human spirit.  Dave is portrayed with all his baggage as he struggles with his inner demons, most notably, drinking and violence.  Even with its warts, I highly recommend this effort not only to Burke/Robicheaux fans, but also to fans of Southern atmospheric mysteries and thrillers.",1236902400,3,2090,5.061224489795919
3716952,4,B001NFNFIK,"I am a huge fan of James Lee Burke and being from MT every
time one of his stories is centered here in Western MT it
gives the story line and descriptions more depth.  You can
always pick out just where he is at in the story.
Movies never live up to the book but this is a very good
movie and the characters are well played.  A little disappointed that Dave Robicheau (Tommy Lee Jones) did not have the characteristic streak of white in his hair
but TLJ is great in anything he does.",1236816000,2,483,4.073684210526316
3716953,4,B001NFNFIK,"I too am a huge James Lee Burke fan.  I have read most if not all of Burke's Dave Robicheaux novels.  In the Electric Mist with Confederate Dead is my favorite of the series.  I liked this movie much more then the movie adaptation of Heaven's Prisoners.  I think Tommy Lee Jones makes a great Dave Robicheaux much more so then does Alec Baldwin.  Jones lacks the dark hair and the touch of gray, so it is harder to call him by Dave's other nick name  ""Streak"" that may be more of a problem with some of the other books with ""Cletus"".  I thought Goodman makes a great villain (Baby Feet) as well.  Overall the casting in this movie is outstanding!

As usual the movie left out a few scenes from the book.  I was wondering how they would show Baby Feet hitting Dave with a line drive with a baseball.  I suspect the scene was shot, but all cut from the movie except at the end when you see Baby Feet hitting a ball with a bat while Dave describes his fate, but that is all you see.

I believe the book had more conversations between Dave and the ""General"".  Levon Helm made a good General Hood but I wish they used more of the books dialog.  I knew how the book was going to end and was looking forward to it, but thought the director did not quite pull it off like Burke does in the book.

I'm not sure I liked seeing the scenes of post Katrina New Orleans as the book is + 15 years old, long before Katrina but the scenes were interesting.

I agree with the other reviewers that if you never have read a Burke book you might not like this movie.  Like most great books seldom does the movie live up to the book.  One of the things very difficult for moviemakers to do with Burke's books is bring out the poetic descriptive prose he uses.  His writing is ""beautiful.  To really enjoy a Burke book read it first and then listen to it on audiotape!  You get a taste of this in the opening and closing of The Electric Mist.

I pray they make more Dave Robicheaux movies, but one with Cletus.  Who would make a good Cletus?  I'm thinking Tom Sizemore or Randy Quaid.  Which novel would you pick?  I hope they bring back Tommy Lee Jones he is a GREAT Dave!",1236384000,16,2150,4.157766990291262
3716954,4,B001NFNFIK,"James Le Burke is a man who writes intense thrillers that manage to be introspective character studies and also cover the widest variety of emotions.

This film is based on one of the middle books and that may leave viewers who aren't familiar with the series a little baffled.

Tommy Lee Jones gives it his all and he is perfection as the protagonist Dave Robicheax, the weather beaten detective whose appearance and body language let you know that he's seen it all and lived through it.

Dave is investigating a series of killings in the murky depths of the Louisiana bayou. The director captured the mood, tone, and scenery to the point that one can almost feel the stifling southern humidity in ones lungs while watching this.

Robicheaux has problems of his own while trying to investigate and there are many twists and turns, each one seemingly to prohibit his quest of solving these murders.

There is a whole local dynamic that further obscures the truth for him. There are cultural misunderstandings, veiled feuds, and southern racial tensions that further impede his progress.

Robicheaux also has the problem of the evil mobster, Balboni, to contend with. John Goodman's performance of the epitome of evil in this film practically stole the show for me. This role will remind people of just how talented he is.

Due to his dealings with all of the nefariousness and people who do not want him to solve the crimes, one is led through the movie wondering it Robicheaux will make it through without killing more people or being killed himself.

I know that the director could have done a better job with the suspense as compared to the book but Tommy Lee Jones' intensity, commanding performance, and the believability of the story pulled me through whatever lapses in script structure and pacing in the movie that were there. I would most strongly recommend this film to anyone who has read the books. But, if you like the great acting and those involved and the backdrop of balmy Louisiana this film will be for you too.

I give this 4 stars and will watch it again.

3716955,4,B001NFNFIK,"This is the second film adaptation of one of James Lee Burke's Dave Robicheaux series, the first being ""Heaven's Prisoners"" with Alec Baldwin horribly miscast as Robicheaux.

In this film, Tommy Lee Jones is perfectly cast as Robicheaux, capturing all the nuance of the literary character: the alcoholic obsessions, the need to impose justice, his essential toughness and goodness.

This is a pretty faithful adaptation of the novel, and captures the flavor of the books, as well as the Louisiana settings. In all honesty, this was almost exactly how I'd pictured it from reading the books.

But a caveat: if you haven't read the books, you're probably not going to enjoy this movie, which is probably why in the USA it was released directly to DVD. Burke's novels are very introspective, which makes for interesting literature, but slow movies. There's plenty of drama, with several murders, corruption, and depravity to spare. But the books - and this movie - are at their hearts character studies of the Robicheaux character. This is more akin to ""Smilla's Sense of Snow"" than ""Dirty Harry"".

I loved it; your mileage may vary.",1236038400,209,1130,4.99468085106383
3716956,3,B001NFNFIK,"A couple of years ago I heard the French director Bertrand Tavernier was adapting In the Electric Mist with the Confederate Dead, where James Lee Burkes Dave Robicheaux investigates a murder while a film company sets up shop in town and He has drug fueled hallucinations where He is visited by John Bell Hood, a famous Civil War general (and believe no the series is not as awesome as having some alcoholic stumble around talking to ghosts sounds). The cast would be headlined by Tommy Lee Jones including Kelly Macdonald, Peter Sarrsgard and John Goodman and was filmed in the real New Iberia Lousiana. What could go wrong with having a world famous director and a cast like that make a movie? Apparently everything as I never heard of a release date for the movie until it was shat out straight to DVD yesterday. Now I know that pedigree isn't enough to mainline at least a countrywide release but I thought why not an independent release instead. Was the final film that bad that it couldn't have at least a better release. Well to tell the truth its not bad but...
Well for one big problem is the lack of any real suspense in the whole movie thats billed as a thriller. They have twists and turns but there wasn't anything that generated interest. I mean sure they incorporate Katrina into the picture, and the actors are decent at what they do. Theres too many plot points that don't wrap up easy and have a hard time fitting together in the first place. I've heard complaints that the movie seemed tailored to readers of the novel but really when theres nothing there thats a bigger problem. I suppose you could say that the whole thing doesn't even really take time developing the characters in interesting ways as well. The actors do what they can but the only one who seemed interesting at least was Kelly Macdonald who was only in a few scenes and was taken out of the picture incredibly too early in a scene too telegraphed. Tavernier sadly also seems to be a problem. I've only seen one other film the straight adapation of Jim Thompson's Pop. 1280 (Corp De Touchon) but He seems more lockstep shooting the script and hoping the actors are good enough to make something of it. There the actors and script were good. Here the actors are good but the script isn't and the film falters.
Which is a shame really because the film does occupy its setting like Burkes books do. Theres a lot more local talent on display then actors and the setting of the movie was a beautiful location. Just the movie outside of the scenes where Jones confers with Hood hallucination was what worked. Other than that I found the movie decidedly average. Okay just reading DVDBeaver where apparently there are two cuts of the film, a producers cut which We have here and a better directors cut.
The DVD is a sad affair too. The picture on my set suffered from some pixelation despite having good color and a generally sharp picture though the sound was good. There are no extras on the disc which given the problems of the movie isn't suprising.",1236038400,2,3033,4.56697247706422

8326676,3,B001NFNFIK,"Other reviews compare this movie to the masterful novel by James Lee Burke, which is unfair and absurd.  I read the novel twice; it was that good.  I was transported for many hours into the murky magical world of Burke's southern Louisiana, deep into its history, experiencing the feelings and sights and sounds through the finely drawn, complex characters fleshed out upon the pages, learning more about history than I ever had in a classroom.  No movie could possibly have done justice to this work of literature at its finest.  But this movie doesn't even try.  It gets three stars mostly because Tommy Lee Jones manages to squeeze the most out of what he was given to work with, as he always does. The characters are reduced to stereotypes.  The absence of Clete is sorely felt, but I am also relieved not to have been subjected to how this movie would have reduced him to a pale shadow as it did the other characters.",1527379200,,922,4.591463414634147
