8306381,5,B001GOKGB2,"This was one of two books by Ed Slott that I have purchased. Both have paid ten fold for themselves in information and planning for financial security.  Both books, the other was ""Stay Rich For Life"", are equally valuable.  Written in understandable prose, Mr. Slott gets directly to the information.  I also purchased a DVD by the same individual.  I found the books got to the information quicker than the DVD and allowed me to go back and clarify points well made in the written format.  All are good investments to share with family!
