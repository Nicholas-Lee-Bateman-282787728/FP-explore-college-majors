8224949,3,B000WPJT0A,"Very loosely based on a story by O. Henry, this B-level Western series lasted a full six seasons and, for all its faults, was probably the first small-screen example of Mexican characters as something other than villains or buffoons.  Duncan Renaldo (who actually held a Romanian passport and was once arrested for illegal entry into the US, only to be pardoned by President Franklin Roosevelt) plays Cisco and septuagenarian Leo Carrillo his partner Pancho--who *does* tend to be something of a buffoon, though always loyal and courageous.  The duo--Cisco is probably a charro-type and Pancho a common vaquero of peon birth--have no visible means of support, but roam Texas and the Southwest involving themselves in troublous situations, almost invariably on behalf of imperiled Anglos; they're on Wanted posters and sometimes taken for hired guns or even outlaws, but call at least one U.S. Marshal a ""good friend.""

Though one of the first TV series to be filmed in color (a medium few viewers were equipped to enjoy at the time), this compilation is unfortunately a bit muddy with regard to quality.  There's also a tendency for the producers to use the same players, and even the same names and costumes for their characters, from one segment to another, which can be terminally confusing.  And the back-references occasionally make you feel as if you've come in on the second part of a two-part episode.  Still, the chemistry between the two companeros is very good, and some of the storylines are surprisingly inventive.  For Western-nostalgia buffs, it's a definite treat.",1290124800,5,1580,5.10077519379845
8224950,1,B000WPJT0A,"Usually I am in love with the majority of classic sitcoms of this period. However, I found nothing in this show to keep me entertained or even hold my interest.  I have bought a good many Alpha DVDs: The Beulah Show which only came out in a single volume disc containing 4 episodes.  That was years ago & nothing since.  I've also bought every volume of The Stu Erwin Show aka Trouble With Father to date from the same distributors (vols 1-7).

I see they have been moving along rather fluidly with these Corliss Archer volumes. It's a shame Alpha hasn't got the same dedication in bringing us additional volumes of The Beulah Show which is entertaining.  I would also have loved to see more releases of Trouble With Father.  I have so thoroughly enjoyed the show & have seen any given episode a number of times & still get something out of it with each viewing.  I wanted to like Meet Corliss Archer, but alas, I have tried to get into it & simply cannot.  And it isn't because it's dated.  I love the old sitcoms & the fact that they have a dated quality to them is the main attraction for me.  I just find nothing appealing about this one.  I have listened to the radio show & actually enjoy that more, though even still, not a really big Corliss fan all 'round.

I strongly recommend The Beulah Show & Trouble With Father instead.",1222819200,,1334,4.378048780487805
