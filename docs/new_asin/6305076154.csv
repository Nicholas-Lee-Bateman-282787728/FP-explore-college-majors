The ""Planet Of The Apes"" Legacy Blu Ray collection. All 5 apes movies on Blu Ray plus a bunch of extras AND the killer part... Both versions of ""Conquest"" and ""Battle""...The theatrical version and the director's cut, with additional scenes. In essence you are getting 7 ""Apes"" movies and a ton of extras for 20 bucks.

An excellent set with a wealth of bonus features and very affordable.  Someone had noted that the Beyond the Planet of the Apes documentary was not included in this set, while it is not included as a separate disc, it is a special feature on the first disc.

963775,5,6305076154,"A fantastic collection of the original ""Planet of the Apes"" films! These blu-rays contain the films with menu introductions from the Law Giver, setting up the films and briefly discussing the hopes of filmmakers with each. The original ""Planet of the Apes"" (1968) warns humanity of its precarious position if it continues nuclear proliferation. Its sequel, ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" (1970), begins right where the original movie leaves off and develops these themes to their fullest. In ""Escape From the Planet of the Apes"" (1971), Cornelius and Zira return from the far flung future to 1973. There, they interact with the people of our world and find themselves in much the same position as Colonel Taylor in the original film. Both ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"" (1972) and ""Battle for the Planet of the Apes"" (1973) move from an exploration of the dangers of nuclear war to slavery and civil rights allegories. The final two films successfully explore deeper themes, despite an increasingly lowered budget and shortened run-time. For those who want more of this generation of Apes, consider following up with the 1974 television series, ""Planet of the Apes,"" and the 1975 animated television series, ""Return to the Planet of the Apes.""",1502928000,,1251,5.048309178743962

Got the legacy collection even though I really only wanted the first two movies at the time. I ended up watching all 5 over a weekend and enjoyed them all!  I also really enjoyed the extras which gave an interesting insight on sci-fi movies at the time and how studios like Fox dealt with sequels back then (very different than today).

963904,5,6305076154,"I got the Planet of the Apes Legacy Collection from a close friend of mine as a Early Birthday Gift, and I must say I was VERY happy with this product! I'm a HUGE fan of the Planet of the Apes movies growing up, and I still love them to this day! I didn't want to simply own the Original 1968 Classic, though it is the best and my favorite in the whole franchise old and new, so my friend ordered this online, and I am VERY pleased with this version. This Legacy Collection contains the Classic Planet of the Apes, Beneath, Escape, Conquest, and Battle for the Planet of the Apes, and all 5 discs are stored in a single 5-Disc Blu-Ray case with new art for each disc, and new cover art of an ape, and within the ape has the famous cage from the original 1968 Classic, reverse cover art of Carlton Heston's outline holding a gun that includes credits for all 5 films, plus a box cover that has a matte finish with the title being glossy. Unfortunately, the actual Blu-Ray content has the exact same content as previous versions, so you're not getting any new features or any new restorations of each film. You just get new packaging, and that's it. That being said, these restorations are very good! I previously owned the previous DVD collection, and These films look the best they have ever been!! Maybe another version will come out, and gives us 4k restorations of each film, but until then these are probably the best treatment they'll ever get. Which is fine by me. Personally, I REALLY enjoy this collection because of the new packaging, new artwork, and takes up fewer space than the previous versions.

Overall, I'm very glad I finally got my hands on this! If you already bought previous Blu-Ray versions, I sadly suggest that you hold onto those versions cuz there's nothing really new with this version other than repackaging and new artwork. However, if you never owned these movies, or you want a version that doesn't take up too much space like I do, then this is the best version you can pick up right now! The films look great, the features are pretty interesting, and it can get you prepared for the upcoming WAR for the Planet of the Apes movie. Highly recommended!",1500508800,,2183,4.498740554156171

963968,5,6305076154,"The original ""Planet of the Apes"" is a landmark film, and deserves to be part of any film collector's library. Sure, the story is so well known now, that the ""twist"" ending was spoiled even by the film's VHS box art back in the 80's. Re-watching the original film last night, knowing the ending, I have to say that it really doesn't matter. The story, the acting, the make-up, the characters, everything just clicks in this film, and you'll find yourself caught up in film.

The other films in the set, provides some additional high moments; ""Escape from the Planet of the Apes"" and ""Battle for the Planet of the Apes"" as well as some low points; ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"". In reality, just consider the additional films in the series as excellent ""bonus"" material to the original film. Nothing on the set compares to the original movie, but there is something to enjoy about each.",1498608000,3,888,4.620253164556962

964049,5,6305076154,"Five classic movies for less than $20?  How can you beat that?  The first movie is the best, of course.  The remaining four tend to get a little more ridiculous as you go and the budgets for the films shrink. Special features on the first disk are pretty good: different commentaries and such. The menu to turn the features on and off is a little confusing. At one time I had two commentary tracks playing at once.  Don't know how that happened! Special features on the remaining four disks are practically non-existent, comprising of trailers and a few photos.  The special features disc is pretty good, narrated by Roddy McDowall and giving an inside look at the making of the films.  Overall, pretty darn good.",1493424000,10,713,4.664

964094,5,6305076154,"Normally I get suspicious when a price is too good to be true. $20 for what basically amounts to six full length features (if you consider the 2 hour documentary on the first disc) definitely seemed to be too good to be true. I was actually expecting some ""bargain basement"" collection with the movies occupying all of two discs, lacking special features and crammed into shoddy packaging. Instead, each movie gets its own disc replete with insightful  special features, and the packaging is attractive yet compact and functional.

It is worth noting for fans that ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"" and ""Battle for the Planet of the Apes"" are presented here in both theatrical and unrated versions. The unrated versions are improvements upon the theatrical versions, immensely so in the case of ""Battle"". These unrated versions are also more violent than the theatrical versions, so if you have children, the theatrical versions may be preferred.

My only gripe regarding this release is that the picture quality is not as pristine as it could be, given the technology of blu-ray. There are occasional age related artifacts visible, especially in the sequels, but the picture quality is certainly no worse than if you had seen the films on TV in the 70s and 80s.  I am happy to overlook the minor and infrequent visual flaws, given the age of these films and the very reasonable price. If you are a true fan, it's difficult to go wrong with this purchase.",1488844800,18,1458,4.82
964095,5,6305076154,"First off let me say that you are getting FIVE quality feature films PLUS a 2 hour behind the scenes for the price of one. If you are going to buy planet of the apes, buy this one! Now, aside from the obvious money save, the packaging is beautiful. The discs are all placed in this compact and elegant page-style storage, which if you ask me is much much better than a box set where you have to squeeze your fingers in and select a whole case to take out for each movie. The case is no bigger than any other DVD case. It just happens to have six discs. Every movie in the set is well worth watching, so I managed to get three days of solid entertainment from marathoning this series. Each film is slightly different so the formula doesn't get tiring, and the way the story unfolds over the series is unique and inspiring.",1487894400,2,821,4.235668789808917
964096,1,6305076154,I love Planet of the Apes. I wanted to watch them but Netflix didn't have all of them so I decided to buy the collection. It is definitely a classic everyone should see. I rated this a 1 star though because the disc for beneath the planet of the apes is unplayable. I watched the 1st movie fine. Then when I put this one in it skipped a lot and got to a point where it stopped playing. I took it out and looked at the disc and it is very scratched up. The photo doesn't do it justice. It shows only a small portion of the damage. I then checked the other discs and they are fine. I'm not sure how to get a hold of someone to get this one disc replaced. If someone contacts me and sends me another disc I would be more than happy to update this review.,1487116800,,751,3.915032679738562

big box set of dvds and it does not take up too much shelf room as well. comes in a slip box with a case that holds all five discs.
what I really love is the lawgiver from the 5th movie he talks to you at the beginning of each movie it's like he's really right there with you in
your living room. new extras are great too including the trailers for each movie and even the riots & revolutions feature which caught my eye be sure to check that out to see how conquest of the apes came to be with what was going on at the time. also don't worry because the behind the planet of the apes documentary is still with the set it's added with the first movie as an extra feature which I am happy about since I love watching that from time to time also. picture quality is excellent I've never seen these movies look this great before. anyway for now or even as a christmas gift pick up this new boxset it's incredible.",1462838400,6,1053,3.995260663507109

On New Year's eve we never really went out and celebrated with friends to bring in the new year. Instead, we would stay up  all night watching the original twilight zone series marathon that came on television. We would stuff ourselves with pizza and ice cream and attempt to stay up all night (which I was never good at)
 The next morning, that same television station would play all of these original movies and my dad and I  would spend almost the entire day watching them. Up until now, I have not been able to watch them because I do not have cable. Now that I have been able to get this entire collection on DVD I am resuming this tradition in my own house with my own children.  I know it's kind of funny to get sentimental about movies with apes and humans killing each other, but these movies are special to me.

Start with Planet and see how an inventive well written and directed movie can still hold its own even today. Then take in the rest of the movies in order. What you see is how diminishing budgets forced the crew and wrters use ingenuity to keep the series going and not short cange the viewing public.

If you are older you will be thrilled by all of the great actors who appear in the series.

965839,2,6305076154,"The first film is male content (SOFT-CORE PORN). The MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) miscategorized making an G-rated error in overlooking and allowing the blooper scene in their rating system of this film where Charlton Heston's character ""Taylor"" was standing before the Tribunal of Orangutans (ape court authorities) for determining indictment, when a guerrilla security guard completely stripped him of his rags / clothing!

I've seen this first 1968 released film version uncensored, indiscreetly aired on HBO Kids Channel because, it even still has an inappropriate G (General Audience) rating! It should've been classified as Rated-R for Restricted, specifically indicating content of a decomposed woman's corpse, slaughtered humans that have undergone taxidermy to be museum exhibits, (sexual content / conversation about a woman astronaut's all male astronaut harem) and explicit male nudity.

The first film was fair in writing and special effects but, wasn't suited for children or straight, male adult sci-fi fans. It would have great potential, if it were only censored by editing to be wholesome entertainment!

I've seen the rest of the dvd collection both at the theater and on tv! The third (G-rated) ""Escape from the Planet of the Apes"" and the fifth (G-rated) ""Battle for the Planet of the Apes"" films were the best! The second (G-rated) film ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" also, has an inappropriate G (General Audience) rating! A new, stricter rating should be specifically indicating scenes with graphic violence content of the loony, nuclear missile worshiper (DECEPTIVELY IMPLIED BY DISGUISE TO BE A ONCE PRETTY WOMAN, THAT WAS ACTUALLY A SEVERE BURN RESEMBLING, DESFIGURED MUTANT) character! Also, it would have great potential if those scenes were only censored by editing to be wholesome entertainment, where the previous mentioned victim was unmasked and disfigured face exhibited! I hate extreme and excessive graphic violence against women in films! The fourth (PG-rated) film ""Conquest for the Planet of the Apes"" was very boring but, interesting enough to inspire the 2011 remake of the far superior ""The Rise of the Plant of the Apes"". The rating is NR (Never rated) on the Amazon product info page and is for the entire five movie box set only, not rated individually.

IMDB is an acronym for International Movie Data Base and on the www.imdb.com website, for these five movies individual ratings can be verified still listed as indicated in this review.

The director Tim Burton of the 2001 remake ""The Planet of the Apes"" apparently thought nudity was also, inappropriate. I didn't like that version as well as the original but, still think the original absolutely needs to be censored over the male nudity, for children and straight, male adult sci-fi fans to enjoy.

My two out of five stars overall rating is for one star each of the two movies I liked, of the five total movies dvd collection!",1416614400,,2948,5.1957894736842105

965984,5,6305076154,"This set is among the best franchise packages ever. Each film comes with more special features than some other entire sets! I own the Star Wars Complete Saga blu-ray set and I've still not watched many of those special features but the ones on this set are so interesting I even watched the ones that looked like they might be boring--all of them are high quality. Many of them are, of course, about the making of the films but just as many are documentaries on space travel, time travel, evolution, etc. providing an enormous amount of scientific research/education about issues in the films. Speaking of ""issues,"" a couple of the films include documentaries about social and cultural issues that influenced the storylines. If all of that isn't enough, the menus and transitions were also created with TLC providing new, entertaining material. One last thing ... all the movies but one are rated G which is odd since there is quite a bit of violence ... the film that is rated PG includes previously ""deleted"" scenes deemed too violent having to do with the abuse the apes-as-domestic-servants suffered.

No documentry behind the planet of the apes but you get enough interviews and bonus goodies to satisfy I have only watched the first 3 so far. Planet of the Apes was good but very slow. After the astronauts land they are walking for what felt like a half hour. Still had my brother shocked my the ending which I thought by now everyone knew about the infamous statue of liberty scene. Then came Beneath the Planet of the Apes, a good amount of ape and a good amount of mutant humans. Charlton Heston wasn't for a sequel but is in the start and the end. Good story, creepy cults and ape warfare in this installment. The ending is very abrupt and even the director hates it. I enjoyed it because I was intrested in seeing how they would keep the  series going because I already knew that there were 3 more sequels. For the time (1970) you wouldnt have known you would have hated it too. Overall Beneath the Planet is a campy installment and was able to keep my intrest the whole way through unlike the playlike acting of Planet of the Apes. Then Planet of the Apes dialed the seriousness down for half of the 3rd movie Escape from the Planet of the Apes. Funny, Great Story, top notch acting and even a cheesy repeating ending is all here in the most nicest of the Ape movies. I haven't seen the other 2 but im sure I will enjoy them. With Dawn of the Planet of the Apes out im sure everyone wants more ape. Buy this as you will not be disapointed with the cool package and 5 classic movies for the price of one.

966448,5,6305076154,"A Bargain! A Steal! An Amazon Pricing Error??!!!

I cannot believe my good fortune. And as the saying goes, ""if something is this good, grab it!!!"" Well, of course, that is not the catch line of that famous phrase. However, as the excitement builds today (7.11.14) for the release of ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"", my curiosity is stoked considering that I enjoyed the first installment of both the original series and the post millennium revival of the new series starring the ubiquitous superstar, James Franco. Though I enjoyed both debuts, the subsequent word on the following sequels became less and less appealing. I may have seen a good portion of the 2nd one, was it ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes""???, but, I definitely did not complete watching it. Of the last two installments, I may have seen their respective trailers at best.
Save for neo-con right wing nra puppet, Charles Heston, there was much to enjoy about the ""2001: Space Odyssey"". Replace old gun toting Heston with ""it boy"" Franco, and my praise for the revival of the franchise has been restored.
So being the obsessive collector than I am, I decided to check if there was/and how much was a box set. Much to my amazement, without being designated ""Gold Deal of the Day"" or anything of that nature, Amazon had priced the 5-Disc BLU-RAY box set at a jaw dropping $19.99!!!!!! Only a fool could pass that up, even if its subsequent sequels became less and less appealing. A Blu-ray Disc of just the single debut @ $19.99 would be a deal. I was tempted to ask Amazon if this were a mistake or did I possibly read the description incorrectly. But I decided not to draw further attention to this anomaly, though my experience with Amazon Customer Service assures me that they would honor the price.
So for purist or simply inarguably correct other reviewers, THIS IS NOT A REVIEW! However,  I wish others a little luck in possibly securing this deal before it is discovered and possibly altered. It makes spending upwards of $12-$15 to experience the ""must see""**3D version of today's opening ""The Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" quite digestible. **Google: ""Is it essential to see this movie in 3D"" (since I have been burnt numerous times on the deluge of supposedly 3D versions of new movies today), and the consensus is near unanimous that since it was filmed in 3D, see it in 3D! Off to the movies I go, while I await for next Friday (7.18.14) arrival of the 5-Disc boxset.",1405036800,,2450,4.642857142857143
966449,2,6305076154,"I agree with a previous reviewer who, like me, was expecting the box with the 5 individual discs in separate cases, not the really crappy looking two-tone artwork.  The only positive thing about the packaging is that it takes up less shelf space.  I realize that the photo attached to the link was a customer photo, but Amazon should be more precise with what they're offering, especially as a doorbuster item.",1404950400,5,410,4.76056338028169

Grain is still retained from the original prints and the colors look more vivid than before, especially noticeable on POTA & BTPOTA. There are tons of extras on each movie including making of, promo, and visual galleries.
My only gripe was the packaging. I was hoping for a true boxed set with a custom disc case for all the films to fit in one. It was very apparent that my set was a compilation of individually released movies that were unwrapped from their shrink wrap to be placed in a box then shrink wrapped. The sticker seal was unbroken on each movie, but there was significant glue residue on the spine of each of the movie cases.",1404864000,,792,4.506944444444445
966501,5,6305076154,"It might be because I have seen the original films so often.  I like the new re-imagined films, however the originals have made such an impact on me.  I must have seen this saga ten times over and I still marvel at their influence on movie franchises to be.  Nothing matches the original with Charlton Heston and the shock ending you have to see to believe.  Rod Serling co-wrote the screenplay and his influence is very apparent.  I only hope with the new films the apes develop a technologically superior society.  As they did in the original novel, only the producers were unable to finance such a look in a 1960s film.

The producers deny it; but he films send a clear message about prejudice and the class system in all levels of society.  I never saw any of them in the theater.  They were repeated endlessly by CBS in the early 1970s and led to a short lived TV series that lasted thirteen episodes in 1974.  If you were a kid growing up in the 70s you knew what the Planet of the Apes were about. This collection brings it all home with all five films and a special two hour documentary about the making of the franchise. I have the VHS version of the same collection and nothing much has changed in this collection.  The only difference is the fact that it comes with the original trailers to all five movies and a preview of a long defunct Planet of the Apes video game from 1998.",1404432000,9,1390,4.348837209302325

966694,1,6305076154,"I bought this collection a year ago and had just now had time to sit down and watch them.  I put the original movie in my Sony BDP-BX37 and it spun up...played the disclaimers...played the 'Lawgiver' intro...splashed the ANSA insignia screen...and then NOTHING.  Not a dang thing.  Similar results with the others.

Since it took me (my fault, entirely) a full year to actually test/watch these...there's very little recourse for me.  I have seen the 'update your firmware' suggestion on other players - well...mine is up-to-date.  I put the first disc in my PS3, and it plays beautifully well.  The colors are vibrant, the transfer crisp/clear/clean - better than I remember it in the theater once upon a day.

FOX really cheaped out and/or screwed up this box set.  I don't know what they did, but they should be publicly drawn & quartered for it.  It's not like I have an el-cheap-o $15 walmart player (although who knows...it may play just fine in that), but I really shouldn't have to burn up my PS3 drive playing BluRay discs in it, either.

A lesson that I have learned is - ANY time you purchase a set of DVDs or BluRays...ALWAYS play each disc all the way through on 3x speed to see if it stalls, skips, burps, or whatever...that way, you can return them within the window and either get a replacement or money back.

Shame on FOX for using crap manufacturing techniques for such a classic movie series (and yes, I know...just like most franchises...only the first or 2nd one is any good..but it's the principle...)",1391299200,9,1524,4.68796992481203

In the beginning it looked boring and just to old but as the movie progressed, it was getting better and I started to get more intrigued in the situation the astronaut (Taylor) found himself in. One of the reasons I decided to buy the complete series and the need on knowing what will be the the conclusion in this series. Hopefully I won't regret this decision.",1387929600,,530,4.474226804123711
966748,5,6305076154,The original is to me the best SCI FI movie ever. The finale of the original is timeless.  I still remember in 1974 going to the theater to see all 5 films in one day. Having the sequels is for me nostalgic. You should just GO APE and just sit back and enjoy.,1387843200,,259,3.8867924528301887

966820,5,6305076154,"Forget/throw out/sell your old DVD release's of this classic Sci-fi series
and get this all new Blu-ray boxset which contains
all 5 Planet of the Apes films from the 70'S
each film was released on Blu-ray back in 2008-2009 which are hard to buy seperatly now
so all 5 films have been reissued again by 20th Century fox in this blu-ray boxset
so it's much cheaper to buy this boxset than to buy the films separatly
each blu-ray Disc comes with their own plastic case and cover art
Just as if you were buying them individually

the First and the best Planet of the Apes film now has a beautiful HD transfer widescreen
the sound quality is Great aswell, much better than the DVD release from 2003
all the special features from the DVD release every single one of them are on this 1 blu-ray Disc
incredible, there are Hours of Special features, Documentaries and featurettes etc
plus there are 2 brand new featurettes just for this blu-ray release
Impact of the Apes and Evolution of the Apes which explain the Films Legacy, very interesting to watch

but wait there is more,
for the first time ever each sequel has been given a brand new HD widescreen transfer just like
the original classic plus new making of featurette's
with all new interviews with some of the cast from each sequel that havn't passed away yet
the DVD release of Beneath the planet of the Apes had no extras at all until now
Building a sequel featurette (30mins of new interviews)
interviews with Director Ted post and Linda Harrison and other interviews aswell
there's also Behind the scenes Photo Gallery, Ape news Gallery, plus the trailer
only on this blu-ray version
the 3rd sequel Escape from the... never had any extras on the DVD release until now
The Secret behind the Escape featurette, goes for about 20mins
no interviews with Kim Hunter, Roddy McDowall, they have both passed away now
there are just interviews with film Historians etc, Kim Hunter son is interviewed thou.
there is also behind the scenes footage/featurette of Don taylor Directing the film
Behind the scenes Photo Gallery and trailer
the 4th Sequel Conquest of the Planet/Apes which again no extras on the DVD release until now
this blu-ray version has both the Unrated version and Theatrical version
which i didn't know there was an Unrated version
there is also a brand new featurette Confronting the times about making the film
plus behind the scenes footage of J Lee Thompson directing
plus some more featurettes
and the same with sequel 5, both versions Theatrical and Extended cut are included
plus all new featurettes
i havn't seen 4 and 5 because the plot was getting ridiculous
i couldn't see the point for another sequel, 20th century fox were just trying to make some more cash really.
the first 2 are the best in my opinion. the 3rd sequel is passable
but 4 and 5 was getting pointless and so were the make-up Ape effects in the 4th and 5th sequels
looked pathetic and silly cause 20th century fox cutted the costs on the production.

anyway this blu-ray box is a bargain buy, you get all 5 blu-ray films in one collection
Definitely worth the money
you might aswell sell the DVD releases of planet of the apes
especially the DVD sequels which have no extras
i've already sold my dvd collection of Apes series
 just to get this blu-ray and definitely worth the money.
i gave this blu-ray collection 5 stars, definitely worth the money, no doubt about it",1387497600,15,3412,4.672212978369385

I learned things about the franchise that fascinated me. The fact that John William Corrington and Joyce Hooper Corrington that wrote the screen play for Omega Man, another one of my Charlton Heston favorites, and Rod Serling Mr. Twilight Zone himself were involved says it all.

966891,4,6305076154,"If you like the original Planet of the Apes films, you will love this 2008 special BR release of the first 5 films in the franchise with over 5 hours of extras. The films included: Planet of the Apes, Beneath the, Escape from the, Conquest of the and Battle for the Planet of the Apes. They are all worth watching because they advance the plot in their own way (unlike current film franchises which remake the original over and over). The 40th Anniversary Collection has some good extras (some in HD) from the Legacy Collection (all sixth disc extras seem to be present on this five-disc set) and more. There are many collections of Apes films available for sale but this version remains the best. The 40th Anniversary Collection contains the Blu-ray versions with over 5 hours of extras. There are also Blu-Ray releases without any extras so check the specs before you buy.

Overall, the picture quality is very good but the audio quality is average. My only real complaint is that there could have been even more bonus supplements for the sequels (the original gets the spotlight but each sequel gets about 20 minutes). One of the more important is the 1999 documentary Behind the Planet of the Apes. Even though it is dated it is a great retrospective documentary on each film. Its presence alone guarantees 4-stars because it respects this classic franchise. There are also 2 audio commentaries, text commentary, featurettes, trivia, outtakes and trailers. Some Apes merchandise is included. If you are a fan of Charlton Heston, particularly his sci-fi trilogy (Planet of the Apes, The Omega Man and Soylent Green), you will find Apes to be the best of the lot. Heston also appears in the first sequel, Beneath the Planet of the Apes.

What Else Do Apes Fans Need:
- Planet of the Apes (1974) (TV Series)
- Return to the Planet of the Apes (1975) (Animated TV Series)
- Planet of the Apes (2001) - Features a brand new cast with a cameo but can't compare to the original.
- Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) - Well regarded prequel.
- Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) - The eighth Apes film is soon to be released.

Buy this collection. It is the best POTA set available with over an hour of NEW HD extras for Blu-ray fans (excellent). This collection has held its value remarkably well.",1376697600,,2300,4.618581907090465

The DVDs themselves are nicely done, the only gripe I have with them is that I'd wish for a few more special features specific to each movie, the only thing that's included is the trailer for whatever movie you're watching. The special features are really only limited to the last disc, which includes a 2 hour documentary, Behind The Planet of The Apes. It's a complete history, effects, and actor rundown of the whole series, basically, anything you'd ever wanna know about the Planet of The Apes franchise.

966958,5,6305076154,"This set of DVDs is worth getting for its historic value as a Hollywood cult film.

It began as a story in one of the men's adventure magazines, for I remember reading it when I was a teenager, away back, a long time ago, when there were adventure magazines for men.

Then, years later, I saw the movie at Spangdahlem Air Force Base, Germany when I was a soldier in the United States Army.

Years later, when I was stationed at Fort Hood, Texas, a local drive-in movie theatre (an American institution that, sadly, no longer exists) showed all of the ""PLANET OF THE APES"" movies all night long for a Independence Day celebration.

I haven't seen the remake, and I don't want to, for in my opinion, remakes are never as good as the original.

966964,5,6305076154,"This has always been one of my favorite movie series. Apes treating humans like apes. What a fascinating concept! You see things so clearly when the shoe is on the other foot, and of course by the end of the series, we see that apes have not done a much better job of caring for the planet than humans have done. You really have to wonder why no species can seem to get by without some taking advantage of others, a lot of turmoil, etc. We saw the apes behaving more and more like humans as the series went on, of course. During the first movie, we were mainly treated to seeing our own faults just by watching the apes behave in ways that seemed totally normal to us, but appeared wrong because the behaviors were detrimental to humans.

The series loses a bit as it reaches movie 5, of course. It's still worth 5 stars because it never lets up on examining our behaviors and making us think. I do not recommend the 2001 Tim Burton remake, even though it perhaps follows the book a little more closely. It was too action-oriented and therefore lost some of the thoughtfulness. (I may have loved it if I had never seen the original series, maybe.) The only thing I liked was that the humans retained their ability to speak. This was NOT consistent with the novel, but I never understood why they would lose that ability, unless every single one of them was isolated. Oh, and skip ""Rise Of."" Sure, it's supposed to be a prequel, but it's too late for that. Plus, they already took care of that in movie 3.",1373760000,,1504,4.352313167259786

The sound is also really nice.  It retains the original sound even though it has been converted to Dolby Digital.  I gave it 4 of 5 stars due to bonus features.  The bonus features are okay and on set photos are always a nice touch, but I have yet to come across the indepth filming documentry that I saw years ago showing how the costumes and make up was done.  Instead the studio chose to include a remote playable board game.  This is nice, but unless there is to be a major release of a planet of the apes video game or board game, I find this to be a waste and hardly related.

This was a surprise though, and it was a pretty interesting journey into a world I've never seen before.  The first four movies vary in quality from film to film, but they all share social/political messages that are relevant to today and that's what I think has made these movies stand the test of time.  Very dark subject matter as the series moves along, that is, until the pretty awful final movie that promises more than it could have achieved on such a small budget and with different writers than previous installments.  The films are certainly dated quite a bit, but if you can get past that there is much to enjoy here, and I think the latest Apes reboot will certainly steer some much deserved interest toward this original Sci-Fi series that even pre-dates Star Wars!",1357776000,,946,4.640718562874252

967854,5,6305076154,"I'm glad I waited until this set came about.
I have loved these movies (and the follow up tv series) since I saw them the first time as a kid back in the early 70's. I always wanted to add this collection to my Sci-Fi library but never seemed to find the right one. Throughout the years there have been diifferent versions and formats of these movies on VHS and DVD, and even on TV, but none had the entire spectrum I was looking for. Until now.
This set contains all the additional materials and bonus features from previous DVD's along with new documentaries in the making of, cast and crew interviews, and scenes seen only for the televised version. That and plenty of other added special features that immerse you into the background history and concept of Planet Of The Apes. The Blu-ray formatting brings it back to life with its HD picture and sound that almost makes you forget that these movies are over 40 years old. So go ahead and trade in your old DVD versions and get this one, I assure you that you'll be glad you did.",1356220800,,1033,4.385416666666667

I had the 35th Anniversary 2 DVD set for the original Charlton Heston masterpiece, it has all that was included in that and more. Am added ""making of"" for the rest of the 4 films were very enlightening. The main reason I got the set was for the masterful transfer to High Def with also for the first time, 5.1 sound! There is a bit of bonus footage only a keen eye on the films would see, that's when a fan even bigger than me came in handy. Not much in that department but as a set, this will be the last set you will need to get. When I think, the first digital versions I bought were on Laserdisc for $70 dollars a movie!

Lots of special features on disc -1 & not so many on the other discs,but enough to keep you up to date.

968083,5,6305076154,"This Blu-ray set of the five original PLANET OF THE APES movies was not only inexpensive, but the quality was better than I expected. On two accounts:

1) These are obviously old movies. The special effects are antiquated (the ape-makeup of John Chambers was revolutionary in its day, but it can't compare to modern computerized graphics), the spaceships are blas, the sets are low budget, there are no computers, and the screenwriting has many flaws. (The script was worst for the third movie, ESCAPE FROM THE PLANET OF THE APES, in which human characters behave unconvincingly.) Nevertheless, if you accept that every piece of art is a work in progress and if you use your imagination to make revisions, a pretty good story unites these movies. It's an epic adventure worth experiencing. Though much of the acting is poor, much of it is good, especially Roddy McDowell's portrayals of Cornelius and Caesar and Kim Hunter's portrayal of Zira.

2) I don't know how they did it with such old movies, but the Blu-ray high definition is sharp. Do NOT get the regular DVDs!",1351987200,4,1069,4.836065573770492

The original saga of Planet of the Apes is definitely a cult for the fans, so precisely for those fans there is absolutely NOTHING better you can get, and believe me, every penny is worth it, not to mention that the price is really low for its value taking in consideration that we are talking about 5 movies here and the most complete collection of extra features publised up to date, including the Documentary ""Behind The Planet Of The Apes'. The only improvement opportunity is that this documentary should have offered subtitles as it did in the DVD release.
Now, if you will judge the produtc by image/sound quality, take in consideration that the original films are between 39 and 44 years old, so the restoration jobs done here are a great achievement by themselves.  This is being offered to the public in the highest definition and quality in image and sound available to the open market today, so I can say with no fear that this is the best anyone can get these days for these wonderful pieces of the seventh art.
I am not even going to talk about the production and performances of the movies because that is already settled and mentioned before: PIECES OF ART!!!.

The point is that the movies look and sound great ! The packaging is also great, nice and firm and the book is pretty sweet too. My only complaint, along with a few other people, is the rubber DVD holders. I got annoyed real quick with those things but I found a pretty simple solution to that. Buy DVD Hubs. Those hubs are the DVD teeth that hold them in place like a regular DVD or CD case. I bought a set of 25 DVD Hubs right here on amazon for like 5 bucks, I took the rubber pads off and replaced them with the hubs and BAM !!! now the discs stay firmly in place. I loved the box the discs came in so I hated the idea of them getting scratched in there, get these hubs and you should be set :-)

After reading all of the reviews (for this UK version and the USA version) saying the video quality is excellent, I am disappointed.  I thought the first movie had very good video quality.  In fact, I thought it looked great.  After putting in the second movie, I immediately saw that the image was not nearly as good as the first.  There was grain, and I didn't remember seeing grain in the first movie.  I thought the 3rd, 4th, and 5th movies looked better than the second, but not as good as the first.  I rate the movies between 8.0 (the second movie) and 9.0 (the first movie) on a 10.0 scale.

All five of the movies have an aspect ration of about 2.35:1, and have DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio.  There is not much surround sound in these movies, nor much sub-woofer bass, if any.  Most of the sound comes from the front center speaker.  I did notice more surround sound in the 4th and 5th movies.

The first movie lasted about 2 hours.  The other movies all lasted about an hour and a half.

Although disappointed in the audio and video quality, I still say this is a good Blu-Ray purchase.  I am glad not to have the huge box that the USA set comes in.",1332633600,,1359,4.372

So the Planet of The Apes are classic in the fact that they were great sci-fi as well as the very foundation for 2 newer remakes.
I love re-watching these classics to be reminded of the beauty of original cinema and then when I rewatch the newer films to see the painstakingly detailed revisiting of the classics.

Maurice Evans, James Whitmore. THE ALL-TIME CLASSIC SCI-FI, THAT WAS THE RE-BIRTH OF SCI-FI MOVIES AND A STEP UP FROM THE 1950s CLASSICS!!!
Innovative and thought-provoking thriller about astronauts who land on an Earth-like planet, where the apes have taken over and humans are subservient to them. The script, based on Pierre Boulle's novel, Monkey Planet, is consistently engrossing. Special applause for the incredible ape makeup. Ensured Roddy McDowell of stardom. At it's launch, it was a real nail-biting, eye-opening thriller, with an ending that stunned the world!!!

968397,3,6305076154,"Truth be told, I had a really, really bad experience with this set.  So much so, that I actually decided to have Amazon give me money back for it.  I'll get back to that in a bit, but let's cover the positive stuff first:

This is a gorgeous looking set - The outer cardboard shell is sturdy, and the book that slides into it is nothing short of breathtaking.  Inside the book is a massive amount of information and tons of great pics from the series, and as the book folds out there's a timeline that details everything that happens throughout the saga.

Obviously, this boxed set houses all five original Planet of the Apes feature films. Are all the films perfect?  No, they're not.  The original is a masterpiece.  The second was severely misguided and really dismantled the vision of what a planet of apes would be like... but its bleak tone and its dark ending actually leaves me with a lot of respect for it.  The third film was a wonderful return to form, whereas the fourth continued down a path of dark paralelling to our own world.  The fifth film was a nice effort on paper, but its cheap execution was rather poor.  That being said, although there's some issues throughout the series, the positives FAR outweight the negatives.

So, what's the issue with this set then?  The packaging.  The discs are in the book, but on rubber hubs and no protective backing.  I went through TWO of these sets... and each had scratched discs.  Furthermore, the rubber hubs made it very difficult to try and put the discs back in place.  If only a little extra money was spent in developing these sets with plastic hubs instead, this would have been the set for me.

So, I got my money back, and went to FoxConnect.com and bought their exclusive 'while supplies last' Planet of the Apes - Evolution Collecton on Blu-ray... and that set DOES house all the films in plastic hubs with protective backing.  Also, that set ALSO includes Tim Burton's remake, as well as the Rise of the Planet of the Apes reboot film.

In conclusion, this 40th Anniversary Collection is great as long as you get discs that haven't been ruined by the packaging... but for anyone who is really concerned about gimmicky packaging such as this, you may want to hold out for something more sturdy such as I did.",1330128000,4,2279,4.53921568627451

When Amazon offered me a killer deal on BD (that was half of what I paid for the DVDS), I couldn't resist buying them again to share with my entire family.  Picture and sound was excellent in DTS.  It comes with a high quality hard bound fan book.  It was interesting, but not necessary.  The BD hubs attaching the BD in place to the book were a poor excuse for packaging.  I had to twist the BD back and forth and work it off the hub, hoping I wasn't going to break it in the process.  Once I got them off, I put them in standard size cases, never to go back in the fancy case again.  Also, what am I going to do with this oversize box?  I have cabinets designed specifically for DVD/BD and this will fit nowhere.  I would have been much happier with all 5 movies in a standard size case.  As for the fancy packaging, I will probably store it somewhere in a file box with all the other useless fancy packaging I have been forced to accumulate over the years.  I would have just bought the newer standardized set, but it was twice as much.  Maybe I can sell the collector's box on ebay.

Note to the studio marketing department: I am buying movies, NOT extra junk to clutter up a storage shed.  I prefer good, solid, STANDARD packaging to this poor fancy pants marketing nightmare.  I want my discs to pop in and out in a matter of seconds and go back on the shelf stored safely with its brothers without being an eyesore.

When I looked at the disc in bright light I then saw the thin crack, starting at the center and extending through a portion of the playing surface.

Firstly, the case is way too large to fit in a standard bookshelf.
Secondly, the disks do not fit on the clickable ring in the centre of their placeholders. There is a rubber gasket which takes an incredible amount of work and continually fails - meaning the disks fall out of their place and jostle about.
Thirdly, the case does not shut/slide into the sleeve with any ease.

When readin other reviews I thought to myself ""meh... I'll just put them in a jewel case"", but truth is, the book that comes built into their case is good enough that you want to keep it, and won't really fit in a book collection if you decide to separate it.

The case opens up to a detailed timeline of Ape events.

The case opens further, providing a 200 page full colour, glossy imaged retrospective worthy of any collection.

The presentation of each film is beyond reproach. It is still this reviewer's opinion that anything being released on this scale on BD should be released in 7.1 digital sound. Each film presents its own harsh review of humanity and some on the purported truths thereabout.

The BDs themselves are mounted on hard board backs by what amounts to pegs of gorilla glue (natch). These discs come away with a twist of a turn, not the man-handling we mere humans are accustomed to.

It's too pretty (and too big) to fit with my present collection of BDs, but it doesn't belong with them per say. This is a collection treated dearly and presented as it should be: a milestone in cinema, sociology, and dystopic science-fact.

968613,4,6305076154,"So how do you give a star rating to a film series of such varying quality?  Well the films almost speak for themselves.  Chances are you have seen at least some of them before...  If you have, then be prepared to see them as spruced up as possible, with some genually informative extras.. if not, prepare for one of the most unique movie franchises out there.. in fact, the franchise that really set a trend in having merchandising and tie-ins, before Star Wars came along and ran with the concept.  What's fascinating now watching these, along with the short documentaries accompanying each movie, is the discussion around the issues of the day which influenced, and maybe even spawned, the movies themselves.  The writers of the screenplays wanted to use a fantasy world to explore issues of race and civil unrest that they might not otherwise get to tell... so while you can take these movies as adventure fantasies or action movies on one level, it's looking at them obliquely that one gets the roundest experience of them.
That said, the quality of the movies is most definitely variable.  Planet of the Apes (*****) is the classic one here even if the effects and style have somewhat dated, and comes with a plethora of extras in the form of stills, trailers, the 2 hour documentary narrated by Roddy MacDowall which explores the whole world of Planet of the Apes through all the movies and TV series, games, vintage documentaries and more.  Charlton Heston plays the astronaut who was happy to go on a long term mission since he is cynical about Earth's chances of survival anyway, only to find himself on a world where the social order is upside down - apes are the intelligent species.. man (and not forgetting Linda Harrison as woman) is mute and the inferior species.  The commentary however comes more often than not through the ape hierarchy and how they treat each other, than how they treat man.  Certainly, watching it again will remind you what an ill conceived exercise Tim Burton's remake was. Beneath the Planet of the Apes (**) benefits from at least a cameo from Charlton Heston, with James Franciscus gamely trying to hold his own, against a script which falls woefully short of the first one, eschewing the subtleties of message for a blatant anti war tone.  Its tale of a weird society of mutant humans worshipping an atomic bomb, climaxes in a nihilistic ending which fails to shock or involve in anything like the way the first did.  Charlton Heston adds the only element of class in the exercise.  By the time of Escape from Planet of the Apes (***) came along the following year, the production values were a shadow of their former glories, but despite an uneven tone moving from broad humour in the first half through to serious and bleak in the second half this story works surprisingly well, as Roddy MacDowell and Kim Hunter return from the first movie, having escaped the planet in Heston's spacecraft (some of the ideas are best just accepted rather than thought about too hard..) and gone back in time to `current day'.  The change to ape being the odd one out in a human society adds a needed fresh twist.  Ricardo Montalban in a small role is a treat.  Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (***) suffers from lowest of all the budgets, and darkest least family friendly in its levels of violence as we chart the beginning of the Apes rise to supremacy as they start revolution.  However, given the budget they had, they did a good job, with MacDowell giving arguably his best performance in the series, and the alternative directors cut here not only restores some of the cuts made for violence (don't expect too much, it's just more tomato ketchup on display), but restores the original bleaker ending, which fits the tone of the movie and indeed the movie series much better than the studio enforced more hopeful ending in the theatrical version.  Battle for the Planet of the Apes (**) at least brings the story full circle, but is so watered down and lacking a coherent narrative drive or underpinning idea, it is the weakest of the series, and it is probably good they stopped where they did - on the big screen at least.  The second * is based on goodwill carried over from the previous movies more than anything.  Look out for a cameo from John Huston, if you can recognise him. And if nothing else, it's fun debating the meaning of that final shot...
All in all, as a package this is not as `must see' as it once was, but good entertainment with enough issues woven in to give it an additional dimension. There's a nice 20 minute to half an hour documentary exploring personalities and themes of each movie on each disc.  Worth capturing at the bargain price it is currently available at.  Go Ape, and treat yourself..",1323561600,2,4762,4.658711217183771
968614,1,6305076154,"I received this box set collection last Christmas.  The movies and the collection are great - that's not the problem.  All five discs played fine for months and they remain in pristine condition.  Two days ago I looked at the first film and after the copyright warning and the organgutan CGI intro the player freezes: counter stops, black screen, no way to access the menus, movie or extras - nothing.  The only buttons that will work on the remote or player itself are 'Home' and 'Eject.'  This is now the case with all five discs - all unusable with this Sony player.  I looked online and a number of other owners with the Sony BDP-S370 (2010 product) are having this same issue with this collection of APES Blu-Rays. Some indicate the discs continue to play fine on non-Sony players.  I spent two days on the phone with customer service (also online and with their live chat support).  They were very courteous and helpful, but we could not resolve the issue. I have the latest firmware (I suspect that is the real source of the problem).  We tried several system resets, unplugging the unit, plugging it back in, disabling the internet feed, etc. Nothing worked. All other discs we own play perfectly.  Customer service at Sony informed me that my only option would be to ship them the unit in Texas and pay for a replacement.  They still insist it must be a hardware issue, but that seems very doubtful to me.  I can't access/upload earlier versions of the firmware to be sure, but I still feel that must be the issue.  There's probably a new glitch that prevents these discs from playing.  The other suggestion Sony made was that I 'wait a few months' for the next firmware update and maybe the discs will play again. This is a great collection, but if you own a Sony Blu-Ray player I would not recommend purchasing this - the discs are likely to be unusable.  It's a real disappointment as they worked fine for months.  If anyone has found a solution to this issue, please comment.",1323388800,6,1988,4.573446327683616

968705,5,6305076154,"A must see classic collection of movies I would say. The 1st movie is an all time great classic.

I would rate the 5 movies as follows.

Planet of the apes: 5/5
Beneath the Planet of the Apes: 5/3
Escape from the Planet of the Apes: 4/5
Conquest of the Planet of the Apes: 4/5
Battle for the Planet of the Apes: 5/5

And I have the Definitive Edition (Tin Case 2 disc edition) of Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes. State of the art special effects and good script. The cast is excellent I would say again.

I would give 5/5 for it. The new release ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a brilliant movie with great special effects and a good planned cast too.

Finally all I can say is that all the seven Planet of the Apes movies are must see by everyone here on Planet Earth!!!",1316649600,10,775,4.072368421052632

Unlike The Ultimate collection that was released in the Caesar bust, this collection does not include the TV series starring Roddy McDowall, which kind of feels incomplete. Being a Apes fan, having any access to the POTA universe is a fun endevor.  The first disc has a 2hr featurette of the Making Of, while each other disc has a short 15min Makiing Of for the corrisponding film. Really neat to learn about what when into each movie.

968892,5,6305076154,"I am a movie buff who is always on the lookout for good deals on movies, and I came across this entire set of Planet of the Apes movies for a very good price.  I was surprised I didn't have it in my collection already but now I do.  This was on VHS but that does not matter.

My favorite of the five films is the third one, Escape From Planet of the Apes, where  Kira, and her husband and unborn baby come to earth.  It is the first time I had seen any of these movies since I was a child and I didn't remember a lot about them.

I had seen other complaints from other fans who did not like or appreciate certain scenes being cut from the films, or certain scenes being changed or edited.  I don't know about that considering the fact that I had not seen them for years, but I will be on the lookout for other versions to compare.  To me it doesn't matter, nor does format.  As long as I get to see something. Often times scenes are cut or edited to make the film flow better.

All in all, if you like and appreciate science fiction of any kind, you will not be disappointed with this.  As usual, there are two ways to enjoy it.  For the entertainment value and then for the thinker, you can compare it to real life and how humans exploit those of our own race, animals, the environment, perceive God, and abuse technology. Bottom line, the apes give us a taste of our own medicine and we don't care too much for it...so it can be appreciated for the irony in this alternate reality.  If a viewer, whether casual or deep thought viewer carefully pays attention to the messages contained within the films, maybe...just maybe...the world would be a much better place.

Oh and my young son, age 11, is always being introduced to new Sci-Fi as well and he really enjoyed these.",1314316800,,1773,4.222551928783383

The only complaint is perhaps the disc mounts? they are just cheap gooey gunk hubs that you have to squash the discs back onto, and it's just sad that the edition is marred by such a detail.

969010,4,6305076154,"Though we all love a good High Definition picture, sometimes High Definition reveals fakeness and flaws all too well.  Watching these films with the apes, the High Definition is so well defined that you can actually see the ""Manufactured by MATTEL"" and Made in China (patent pending imprint) along the neckline of every ape.

No, I'm just kidding, but it is true that the apes look so incredibly fake that it's laughable.  I'm surprised that Cornelius, Zira, the Lawgiver, or even Dr. Zaius wasn't included as an action toy figure in ""Toy Story.""

But, I do still enjoy the stories (at least the first four) so I'm not disappointed with the great High Definition mastering of this legendary, and controversial, movie series.  I'm trying to not laugh at it's fake look, but it is of its time.  It's not as bad as the creatures that you see in the original Star Trek TV series, or even worst yet, the plastic spiders you see in ""Jumanji.""

This five movie series was very original in its time.  Where else have you seen a five movie story that actually showed the ""End of the World"" at the end of only the second movie.  And yet, it still managed to have three more stories follow, and it all still made sense.  These five movies could actually play in a circle.  The ending of the fifth movie, could easily be followed by the beginning of the first movie.  The only other movie series that I've seen likely to be able to do this are ""The Terminator"" films.

I'm glad I waited for more than a year to finally purchase this set.  When it was first released on Blu-Ray, they wanted almost $150 for the five disc set.  Now, I've only paid about a third of that.  So, this it the time to strike to buy this box set at this great low price.  I encourage you to do so.",1307145600,,1760,4.382716049382716

969013,1,6305076154,"I bought this set on a lark, having loved all of these movies as a 10 yr. old kid.  Watching them as a 47 yr. old, I now realize that only the original 'Planet of the Apes' deserves an A+ and remains a sci-fi classic.

I grade the 2nd-5th titles in this series as follows:

2nd:  C-
3rd:  D  (But with a brilliant, haunting ending.  Unfortunately it was not filmed particularly well.)
4th:  D+
5th:  D

The production budgets of these films decreased over time, from $16 million for the original, to way less than $2 million for the last one (see Wikipedia for more specifics) and boy does it show.  The scripts for 2-5 make little sense and often contradict each other.  If I had it to do over again, I would purchase only the original.",1305072000,13,737,4.299270072992701
969014,5,6305076154,"I'll be brief, so as to avoid re-hashing previous comments about this release.  It's the Planet of the Apes films in hi-definition, folks.  If you even just LIKE the movies, this is the only way to go.  And for a fan, well, you get the beautifully-made hardback book (which unfortunately mostly just repeats the highlights of the excellent 1998 documentary ""Behind the Planet of the Apes,"" also included here), and a wealth of bonus features.  Fittingly, the first film gets the most behind-the-scenes stuff, but there are some well-done featurettes on the others.

The other reason to pick it up is to get the controversial unrated cut of ""Conquest,"" available for the first time on home video.  The fourth film in the series was already pretty dark; the addition of some surprising blood and gore, plus a shocking new ending, really makes this one stand out.  As a longtime fan, I'm not sure I actually PREFER the new cut, but I imagine most hardcore fans will find it to be an improvement.

If you have a decent home-theater setup, you'll really get your money's worth out of this one.  Video as is good as can be expected (not surprisingly, the bright outdoor scenes in the first 2 films really shine), and the new audio mix brings out the great music of Jerry Goldsmith (among others).

Bottom line: Just buy it already!  And if you're a fan but have been holding out on upgrading to Blu-ray, now is a great time to do it.",1303689600,2,1427,4.600790513833992

969016,5,6305076154,"""Planet Of The Apes"". No matter who you are or where you are, this film and its sequels inspires countless memories of its bizarre upside down world where apes rule and humans are looked down on as savages. As a life-long fan of this sci-fi franchise, Ive seen it numerous times on tv, on VHS, and DVD, and now I finally own it on this major Blu Ray release, and I love the set-up. Each film in the series: Planet of the Apes, Beneath the Planet of the Apes, Escape from the Planet of the Apes, Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, and Battle for the Planet of the Apes, is beautifully rendered in crystal sharp 1080p and DTS-HD sound; a great feature we finally get with this collection are small documentaries detailing the creations of each film, something sorely lacking from other Apes collections, although the fantastic 1998 film-length documentary Behind The Planet Of The Apes is included here.

In Conquest of...., this new collection, finally, shows the legendary controversial, unrated original version of  that fourth film. Extremely violent and with its original ending, this blew me away when I sat down to see it for the first time. For those who know the story of why the ending had to be altered for its 1972 release (to make it more kid friendly), watching this version is a god-send and makes you think even deeper of the film's socio-political overtones (as well as the overall franchise's social and political overtones throughout its longevity). Battle of....also includes its extended version as well as its theatrical cut. This collection also includes a huge 200 pg book of the entire Apes film series as well as a detailed timeline of the Apes mythos. A superior Blu Ray set.",1302480000,2,1701,4.723905723905724

The set comes with a pretty cool and different style packaging, featuring an in-order time line on its inner covers. Included is a large coffee-table sized booklet, covering the entire Ape phenomenon, (Fun Fact-The Tim Burton remake is only mentioned in a single paragraph, on the final two pages of the book). A lot of people complain about the rubber pegs that hold the discs in place, but I have been gently twisting the discs back into place after use and have had no problems. Overall, 5 stars out of 5. Set is usually decently priced, and is made up of 5 Fantastic films, 1 Great Documentary, and tons of Bonus Material. You should of already bought it. CJP",1298332800,3,920,4.6503067484662575
969122,5,6305076154,"THE TALE OF A MISSING LINK
FROM INDIANA

An analytical review of the five films known as THE PLANET OF THE APES

By Charles E.J. Moulton

Science Fiction has many supporters and we all know how people of all generations and all eras have flocked to hear about dragons and spaceships, strange creatures ruling topsy-turvy worlds.
Let us be honest, today these fans can be categorized into three groups. There are those who dress up in the clothes of their idols, speak their language and collect their items. They attend the congregations and sing the songs. Then there are those who see everything to do with it as pure entertainment, merely loosy-goosy popcorn-fun below all Shakespearian tradition. Between the two lies a group who would gladly consider themselves analytical. Their chief characteristic is looking at the real background of the piece and are beyond dressing up as Darth Vader or a Klingon. They probe into the story like a gold miner looking for a treasure.
Many films are there for entertainment, but within that entertainment one can find a very solid message intact. Some films throw the message in your face with a bang and with some stories you have to look for the message with a magnifying glass.
The original five Planet of the Apes-Films (dating from 1968 to 1973) are works where the message sometimes is so evident that it hurts. The dialogue is sometimes so strikingly a parody of all things human that it is impressive. All things civilized and racist seem imbedded within it in litmus paper and it is a wonder that the movies are not discussed at sociological seminars.
Current civilization is taught that dressing up is for fun and certainly anyone who dresses up as a monkey is not to be taken all too seriously. In one sentence: these people are wrong!
A rough outline of the story shows us this:
In the story, human astronauts from 1972 are frozen through deep space to arrive in the year 3955 on a planet ruled by monkeys. Only one survives, Taylor.
After torture and persecution he discovers that he is back home on Earth and the apes have simply taken over Earth after a nuclear catastrophe.
There are human survivors of this holocaust and they have worshipped the ultimate bomb for millennia. Taylor is witness to how the monkeys invade their underground city and ultimately destroy Earth by exploding the ultimate bomb.
Three apes escape in Taylor ship, arriving back in 1972 and find they are being treated the same way as Taylor was back home, only worse for it comes with intrigue. The one ape is pregnant and by fooling the police, she manages to rescue the baby, who grows up to start a revolt to found the Planet of the Apes.
The story is a vicious circle: A travels to B and creates havoc, which sets off a time warp that sends off A to B again. It is probably the most famous one in films. Had not Taylor decided to travel into the future, the apes would never have been able to travel to the past to found the future that Taylor discovered.
Ultimately, the proverbial dog chases his own tail until we sit there, blubbering and cooing like, well, a monkey in a tree.
But what does all this mean? It means that Man (in reality and fiction) ultimately works against himself. He discovers something that he ultimately destroys. He won't listen to truth because he is too caught up in his own desires and lack of honesty to admit that he has done things wrong.
To put this bluntly, he cannot let go of his own past mistakes. He regrets them so much that he lives not to better himself but to try to better his mistakes. If he could let them go, he would never have to fight the foes that arose from this action in the first place.
Some interesting dialogue from the film proves my point and how it is put across in a twisted manner. Take, for instance, the Gorilla General's word in the second film. Centuries of slavery ring in his words:

""I am not saying that man is bad just because his skin is White. I am saying that the only good Human is a dead Human.""

It is protest in its purest form. You cannot critique humans on their own level like this (replace ""Human"" with ""Negro"" and ""White"" with ""Black"" and you'll see what I mean). But you can put a human in a civilization of a different race and see how he reacts to this, thereby letting man point his own finger at himself.
The problem is that people don't hear between the lines because the munching of the popcorn is too loud in their ears.
""Ignorance is Evil"" Doctor Zira says in the same film and mirrors the kangaroo trial that occurs in the previous film, where Colonel Taylor is held before a tribunal that only exists to hang the chimpanzees (who think he is a missing link) & the court (who won't believe that he comes from Fort Wayne, Indiana). Neither side, however, is right. He is from humankind's own past. The fact that the Gorilla-Army is blessed by priests in the movie & halted by pacifist chimps should be revealing to us humans. We have two parables here: the flower-power-generation who burnt their own draught cards & finally Nazi Germany, church blessing cannons.
So, the characters in the movie have the same problem as the human beings watching the story. They don't listen. The characters in the movie are so caught up being mad at each other's folly that they keep doing the same mistakes over and over. The people paying to see what they are doing, pay their popcorn and walk out just as oblivious to the countless divorces and badmouthing and intrigues that they are responsible for, not really interested in looking below the surface because they only do so in society-approved things of shiny surface and university approved dogma. But there are signs that try to help them, if they listened.
Shortly before the fourth film there was a racist riot in a city called Watts. Director J. Lee Thompson remodelled these riots, making the leader of the riots the Monkey Revolutionary whose parents were futuristic space travellers and thereby made him responsible for the proverbial dog we mentioned earlier chasing his tail in his own never ending vicious circle.
But we find a positive energy flowing from the remaining words of film 5:

""Life is like a highway. A driver in lane A might survive whilst a driver in lane B might not. By foreseeing his own future correctly he might plan his life better and change it.""

Accordingly, we see apes and humans sharing their lives at the end, giving us a possible hint that things maybe are not as bad as they look. The responsibility lies only in following your own good intuition.
It is up to you, dear reader of this article. Next time you go to a movie or a play, try to find messages within the storyline. Look closely, for you might find more than you think. Even if it is only the interesting analysis behind the bad acting.
Within everything ... lies a message.

969123,5,6305076154,"I'm so happy I purchased the Legacy Collection of the Planet of the Apes movies. It was more than worth it to me. I've loved Planet of the Apes since their release. I own action figures from the television series in the '70s. I am a true fan.

A lot of people don't even realize there were five movies in the series. I enjoy all of them, but prior to the recent re-release, it was difficult to see the later ones. I would sometimes catch them on a premium cable channel. Now I can see them anytime I want! There is also a documentary included in the set called ""Behind the Planet of the Apes"" that tells a lot of interesting facts about creating and producing the movies. It's well worth watching. The best way to enjoy this series of movies is watching them in sequence. The true mastery of the writing and storytelling isn't as evident in isolation as it is watching the movies back to back. It's really one long story. I recommend buying this set, setting aside an entire weekend to cuddle, and watching them all in a row.

969203,5,6305076154,"Most people reading this review are familar with the series so I will not go into much detail. All these films are entertaing, with the first one being an all time classic. The budgets were lower as the series went on and it shows, but even the weakest ""Battle For..."" is a pleasant way to spend an evening.  I give this series alot of credit because they never stayed with the same formula but built, a progressive story and always attempted some social commentary. This was a series that was not afraid to tell some pretty dark stories with often tragic endings and was still considered ""family entertainment"". The Blu Ray transfers are excellant on the earlier films and still very good on the later ones. For most ""Apes"" fans the unrated version of ""Conquest"" is the must see in the set. To my knowledge it has not been available before and this unrated cut really makes an already dark film even darker.

The extras make this one of the best blu ray sets on the market. There is loads to keep you busy including the great ""Behind the Planet of the Apes"" feature length documentary. The hard cover book is also the finest original book I have seen in a movie collection. Overall this is a really entertaing and well packaged set. A must upgrade for an ""Apes"" fan or a newcomer and well worth the money, especially now that you can get it at a reduced price.",1275696000,,1361,4.461847389558233

The only real issue is that I can't get Conquest of the Planet of the Apes to play!  Given that the whole reason I bought this set was to see the original cut of that movie I am more than a little annoyed.  It asks for a firmware update but this cheap player - an AMTC GH7110 purchased from Dick Smith Electronics specifically because it is one of the few blu-ray players that can play Region A discs here in Australia with a simple code entry - doesn't seem to offer firmware updates!  This is especially annoying given that this set was made a couple of years ago.  Does anyone know of a firmware hack for that player that will fix this problem?  What files are the issue?  My player has BD Live so it can connect to the internet, but there does not seem to be a facility for upgrading firmware in the machine.

969279,5,6305076154,"Planet of the Apes was always a film that reminds me of what is great about film.  They take a concept like space and time travel and mix it with a story of anti-war sentiment and they create a series of films that stand the test of time.  I loved them as a child and I love them as an adult.  Nothing beats how each movie was connnected and in order to fully appreciaate the overall story it is good to see the entire series.  To me it was a film ahead of its time, but I am glad that it was so that I could showcase it to more of my friends in order for them to love it as well.",1271030400,,580,3.7295081967213113
969280,5,6305076154,"Groundbreaking in its day, PLANET OF THE APES holds up extremely well as intelligent, exciting science fiction filmmaking. Enormously popular, it spawned the ""sequel mythology"" concept and mass marketing tie-ins that materialized again later for the STAR WARS saga. It's probably heresy (Dr. Zaius' favorite term) to some for me to say this, but I never cared for STAR WARS. I find the APES saga much more original and intriguing. The apocalyptic premise has an ongoing relevance. I also think those apes still look pretty cool.

My five star rating is mainly for the original 1968 PLANET OF THE APES, which is a stand alone, bona-fide classic; its final shot is one of the most iconic and lastingly potent images in all filmdom. While the quality of the sequels is somewhat uneven, all of them are still fun films in their own right. They also provide a logical explanation for the cycle so that by the time you've seen BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES, you're revved up again for the first film.

For devoted APES fans or anyone who enjoys cleverly conceived science fiction, this DVD collection is highly recommended. Also included is an excellent feature length documentary hosted by APES regular cast member, Roddy McDowall.

I looked forward to the blu-rays, but did not purchase until I found a $52 price.  Even at that price they are only a three star value.  The image quality is improved over Legacy but not by much.  It certainly does not come close in quality to newer films on blu-ray.  I have even seen far better on HDTV.  If I had to give it a grade I would give it a 5. In wide shots the images are not clean, they are blurry and without detail.  I have a 58"" Panasonic Plasma.  I currently own over 250 blu-rays and this collection has by far the poorest image quality.  In it's defense, I only own a few films that are over thirty years old but others, such as THE SEARCHERS / 2001 / DIRTY HARRY & THE CONNERY BONDS are as old and far superior.

You start with the first movie, and then watch each of the others, each movie starting off in the EXACT same spot the previous move left off. When you get to the last movie is leaves of at the exact spot where the first movie started. LOL so it gives you this amazing feeling of time travel, and if you were to watch this collection over and over again you would be stuck in the time loop yourself.

One can see, when viewing the films in order, that each successive entry in the series had a lower budget, and fewer big stars (Going from Charlton Heston to Paul Williams is quite a leap into D-list territory). Still, as a (relatively) cohesive story arc, the series holds up despite its obvious shortcomings, and has become a sci-fi standard.

The DVD transfers are generally good (the first film being the best by far), although special features are minimal (the previously-produced documentary with Roddy McDowall, and theatrcal trailers).

But for a budget price, this is a still a no-brainer purchase for sci-fi fans. And for those who want to forget the hideous Mark Wahlberg remake.",1244678400,3,811,4.955882352941177

The film transfers are gorgeous, the case is attractively designed, and the included book is exhaustive and loaded with color photos of the films and props.  The ""making of"" documentaries are also quite extensive and well done.  The only drawback is the little squishy rubber knobbies that the discs are glued to (yes I had to scrape some glue off the spindle of at least one disc).  Once removed, you can't really get them back on.  And for disc protection it's not really an ideal way to store them either.

I had only seen the first movie prior to buying this set, and I was not disappointed.  While the 5th movie is rather weak, and the 2nd also (although it sort of redeems itself by the time we get to the finale), the 3rd and 4th movies are both excellent sequels.

Planet of the Apes is the best of the whole series, however the other films, Beneath, Conquest, Escape and Battle for the Planet of the Apes all are worth watching. They might not be as good as the first, but they all have their own merits. Obviously the budgets sank as the series moved on, but they are all entertaining in their own way. To me it was worth owning the entire set, you get the whole series, widescreen, THX , super sharp transfers and a bonus disc for under 40.00. Even if I didn't like one of the movies Id still get the whole set , which is what I usually do if I enjoy most of the movies of a set (3 out 4, 2 out of 3,etc)

While the book was infomative and of high quality, I could truly care less about a book - especially since the packaging was so large and you need a special place to sotre it as it won't fit with other films.  I like simple boxed sets like ""Die Hard"" or even the ""Dirty Harry"" films better since you can store them with other discs.

I recalled most of these films, especially the first two and the fourth one, but the 3rd and the last one I only recalled when I saw them.  I almost forgot they existed.  The 3rd one was stupid, but solid when compared to the last one which had budget and backing problems.  You see it in the film.  It should not have been made.

The first two are the true classics and the fourth one was a worthy follow-up, but not to the 3rd one, just to complement the 1st two.  SO, the first two and the 3rd ones are the only good ones.  The last ones is horrible and you can see the no budget creation.

In the end, I did not like the set due to size and the fact that two of the films sucked.  I ended up selling it.  It is kind of hard to only buy the first two knowing that others were made, but the first two is all that you really need.  The whole story just goes in a circle, so you really won't be missing anything.",1239408000,9,1422,3.9403508771929823

969575,5,6305076154,"I have bought every Planet of the Apes release in the past on VHS and every DVD release. I have to say that this new Blu-ray transfer has let me experience all 5 Apes films like I have never seen them before.
Being that the original is 40 years old now, I had my doubts on how good it would look transfered into HD. My doubts were put to rest when the movie started. It looks stunning! As I previewed the rest of the films, the picture quaility does not falter any! I know many look at this as a way for FOX to re-issue the same DVD in a different box, but this is not the case here!
Yet, I do have a few gripes with this set. First is the package. The DVD's are held on by rubber bumbs. They are almost impossible to remove and put back on. Also, the DVD art work stinks! It does not have any of the original art work of the  actors or the movies. Instead, FOX used members from APEMANIA and put them on the DVD's as art work. Now I appreciate APEMANIA and what they do to keep the origianl Planet of the Apes makeup and style alive and take nothing from them. But they do not belong on DVD covers of movies that they are not in.
Most of the special features are from the previous release but each DVD has new mini features as well. Both versions of Battle for the Planet of the Apes and Conquest of the Planet of the Apes are included on this set. Both versions are transfered into HD Blu-ray.
All in all, this is a must have DVD Blu-ray release and I can not be more than pleased with the quaility. I only wish FOX would have issued the Apes TV series on Blu-ray with this set also. Since they didn't we can only hope that the TV series will get the Blu-ray treatment also.",1228176000,38,1676,4.033033033033033
969576,5,6305076154,"I have loved this series ever since I was a young boy who saw the original movie on TV.  When the TV series came out, I was glued to the set for every episode, and then the cartoon series became a part of my regular Saturday morning viewing.  This is one of the few movie franchises that I loved growing up that has not lost any of its charm with me now as an adult.  I first bought the Limited Edition Evolution collection on DVD a few years ago, and followed up with my purchase of the Ultimate Collection that came enclosed in a bust of Caesar.  When I first heard of the arrival of this series on Blu-ray, I thought they would simply transport the DVD versions I already owned onto a Blu-ray platter.  BOY was I wrong!!!!!

I will not go into the details of the story line for this series, since so many have already done a great job at that.  What I will focus on is the Blu-ray 40th Anniversary Collection.

I had seen pictures of the collection, and was very excited to get my own copy, but I had never actually seen a copy of it in the stores.  Because of that, I wasn't quite sure what to expect with regarding the quality of the set.  I had just recently been MAJORLY disappointed with Fox's horrible Blu-ray box set of the Omen series (another favorite of mine).  The packaging for that set was one of the worst I have ever seen on any format.  But I digress....this is not a review of the Omen set.  Let's start with the outer box.  It is of very sturdy construction with the spaceship on the cover in textured relief.  The box serves what appears to be a hard bound book.  You slide that out of the cover, and it opens to reveal a detailed timeline of the entire Ape film series.  Each gatefold of the timeline then opens to reveal the discs which are attached to the backboard with these clear rubber hubs.  I will admit that the hubs proved to be frustrating at first, because I could not get the discs back onto the hubs to secure them before closing the package.  While this is my only complaint about the entire set, I found that instead of trying to force the discs straight down onto the hubs, it works MUCH better to place the disc on the hub and then give it a gentle twist which easily secures it.  While I have some reservations about the choice to use these rubber hubs to hold the discs, I have to admit that it really does look great when the package is all together.  The only other thing included in the package is a book that chronicles the entire film series.  But wait....this is no typical listing of special features with a brief synopsis of each film.  This book is a substantial 200 page overview of this timeless series.  The production value of this book is top notch!!!  It is the best I have ever seen in a movie set.  What makes this book truly special, is that it was produced exclusively for this Blu-ray collection.  You may browse the book with it still attached to the package, or you can easily slide it out to look at it on its own.  All of the packaging for this set is constructed from very sturdy cardboard and it all works together to serve as an excellent means of presenting the true star of the set, the 5 Blu-ray discs that comprise the film series.

If you have ever had doubts about jumping into the Blu-ray high def pool, this set serves as an example for what this format is capable of.  The wealth of information on the first disc alone is truly staggering!!!  Not only does it include all of the special features that were included on the 2-disc DVD, it also adds some fantastic special features that are unique to the Blu-ray format.  One of those features is the ability to watch the feature long documentary as it was originally presented or you may choose to watch it in Interactive Mode where you are presented with extra text and video features.  You also get the Science of the Apes Bonusview which is a picture-in-picture feature that can be viewed while watching the first film.  One of the other cool features was the ability to actually read newspapers which served as props in the original movie.  You first get to see the paper as seen in the movie, then you use your remote to choose which article you would like to read.  Finally the entire text of the article is presented in an easy to read text format.  This may not be for everyone, but as a longtime fan, I enjoyed it.  I could go on and on with all the special features of the 1st disc, but you can get that information elsewhere.  While the first film does deservedly get the royal treatment with special features, Fox did not simply slap the previous DVD version of the other 4 films on a new format, and throw them together.  It is amazing that Fox took the time to present these other 4 Ape films in what I consider the best video and audio I've ever experienced them in.  Each film also gets its own documentary, while not as extensive as the original, each one is more than just a puff piece of each film.  As a longtime fan, I have been dying to see some nice extra features for the other films in the franchise.  In addition to some nice extra features, you also get the opportunity to watch ""Conquest"" and ""Battle"" in either the original theatrical version, or an expanded version.  While there was an extended version of ""Conquest"" in the Ultimate Collection DVD set, this is the first time we have been given the opportunity to see the extended version of ""Battle"".  It has been mentioned in previous releases, but it was thrilling for me to finally get to see it.

BOTTOM LINE:  I will concede that the sound on these discs cannot compare to those of such blockbusters as Transformers or Iron Man, but if you are an Ape fan and have been looking for a definitive collection of the franchise, then I wholeheartedly recommend that you get this collection on Blu-ray.  These films have never looked and sounded better, and I am thrilled with all of the extra features that are available for each film.  This is hands down the greatest Blu-ray collection yet created, and I think it will stand the test of time as other studios follow suit.  Even with the little complaint about the rubber hubs holding the discs, I have no reservations in recommending this to any Ape fan who has recently jumped into the Blu-ray pool of high definition movie viewing.",1227830400,293,6293,4.382758620689655
969657,4,6305076154,"First off, I should mention, I am a Big Fan of the series and fans never seem to have any imput on putting together what they might want in a boxset, but I guess they  would get it right the first time and the studios could never reissue it over and over..

  Packageing: It is nice that this series was issued on BluRay, but with big disapointments.  How can anyone be so stupid to create such a great box set and house the DVD's so poorly, I had to return the box set twice.  Every disc was scartched or had some sort of cosmedic flaw on each disc.  After returning it twice I finally decided to send the discs back to fox and have them send me them seperate in the Bluray cases.  At least I get to keep the box and book and also have the disc stored seperatley. I would of rather had an upright box with the book and cases seperatley.  I also wondered why they did not include the 2001 movie and the 2 TV series, also remastered in Bluray form.  I myself would've enjoyed having the TV Series remastered. The current bluray edition of the 2001 is bare boned.  Now since I bought the Ape head edition a few years back, now I have to sell it for a loss and rebuy the TV series seperatley.  Movie Studios always find a way to screw you, when they issue and reissue DVD's over and over.

The Remastering: Picture/Sound: When first buying this I was quite delighed to find the directors cut of Conquest.  And now having both Battle and Conquest in there extended form along with the theatrical versions is a +, I am sure there is deleted scenes that could've gone back into Planet and the other sequels, but my guess is Fox is waiting for the 45th or 50th ANVV.  I Noticed with the picture an automatic sharpness difference right off the bat, less grain and less imperfections IE dirty prints or scartches on the negatives during the transfers.  The colors look well balanced and fresh and warm.  My only compliant is durng the background throught all movies there is still grainy and fuzzy.  I thought fox would've cleaned that up as well.  But overall the movies are as sharp as they ever have been and with the age of these movies and the prints. Not to bad, I do not think fox would've spent 1000 of hours restoring the picture frame by frame like what was done by lucas for Star Wars and Raiders.  I Can only imagine how good those will look on Bluray.  Hopefully ""JAWS"" will get the same treatment as those did.  Anyway back to POTA.  The DTS sound is great, I do not know why people should be suprised by the sound, these are not modern action flicks with the technology of the 90' or later and we know fox keeped decreasing the budget for each movie.  I think the dialogue sounds very good through the center channel, there is not much use of the sub, but that is to be expected due to the age of theses films. If nothing else it is an improvemet from the previous issue.  And looks pretty dam good.  I hope one day fox will also issue the cut footage from the (Live Action) TV series to put that series to bed, and maybe remaster the picure.

Bonus Features: Some nice documentries for all films narrated by James Brolin with some interesting tidbits on all films regarding scripts and changes to the stories and how they evolved.  Some of the same features from previous editons and some for the diehards.  All in all,a nice package with a great book.  As always Fans wishing for more or something different.  If you have a Bluray player/HD TV it is worth the upgrade for this series.  If anyone wants to talk ape shot me an e-mail, I am also selling my 14 disc set for 60.00 so if your interested let me know @  mikesppie@yahoo.com lets talk...

969659,4,6305076154,"I love the films and the transfers, but the DVD mounts in the case are hard to use. I fear the discs will fall out at some point. I'd love it if the company would offer us a deal on additional slim cases to protect the DVDs.",1227139200,2,224,3.7872340425531914
969660,5,6305076154,"I'd advise buying the box set and never opening it.  Keep it for its novelty and future worth as a collector's item.  Then buy each each title on Blu-ray DVD separately and watch those.

The big bulky jacket opens like a binder.  The front cover swings open to the left, and the back cover swings open to the right.  Once it's opened, you are presented with a graphical timeline based on the movie plots of the Ape adventures.  (I'm fairly certain Ape Maniacs assisted the writers of the timeline, since the actual makers of the films weren't all that concerned if every detail made sense).

The front cover swings open again, as does the back cover -- so that, once the binder is completely opened, it spreads four panels wide.  On the first panel on the left, there is a description of the special features on each disk.  Also on this first panel, the DVD of ""Planet"" is mounted.

On the second panel, the DVDs for ""Beneath"" and ""Escape"" are mounted.

The third panel is where the book mounted.  The book can be removed from the binder by slipping its back cover out of the binder's sleeve behind it.  The book is rather interesting and made remarkable, I think, by its several behind-the-scenes photos.

On the fourth panel, ""Conquest"" and ""Battle"" are mounted.

The binder is made of sturdy cardboard.  As stated, the DVDs are mounted on the inside covers.  The mounts are little, clear rubber disks that are glued to the cardboard.  Prying the DVDs off of these mounts risks tearing the mounts off the cardboard.  Putting a DVD disk back on the rubber mount takes a little effort because, if you do not push the DVD onto the mount completely, the DVD will fall out of the binder.  Plus the mounts are clear.  The only way to ensure that the rubber mount is through the small hole in the center of the disk is by ""feel.""

Aside from the flawed design of the DVD mounts, the binder is a neat idea.  The entire binder has its own sturdy cardboard slip case for safe keeping, though it's taller than the typical Blu-ray plastic jacket.

Each Blu-ray DVD title can be viewed with the option to watch a short introduction by The Lawgiver.  The segments are computer animated and poorly executed and add nothing but an amusing ""extra"" to the viewing experience.

The closed-captions are the most accurate on these disks than those from prior versions.  One example they've fixed:

DR. ZAIUS: (Tied up on the beach in POTA)  The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise.  Your GREED made a desert of it, ages ago.

They finally changed the word from GREED to the correct BREED.

But they still haven't fixed another of Dr. Zaius' lines in the first movie, during the scene in which Dr. Zira presents Taylor's talents to Zaius in her lab:

DR. ZAIUS:  Besides, man is a nuisance.  He eats up his food supplies in the forest, then migrates to our green BELTS and ravages our crops.

They need to change the word from BELTS to WELCH.",1226707200,6,2921,4.539347408829174
969661,5,6305076154,"All of these transfers look great in HD. I only bought the first and best film, but, I saw all the others via Netflix rental. The large box is not appealing to me. If I want a book, I'll buy it. I would've bought the set if they had put all 5 films in a nice regular type blu-ray case like the Blade Runner or Godfather collections, or even the slim line Matrix set. I felt the same way about the Dirty Harry collection. The box is too large to put next to my other blu-ray dvd's.

The original film looks great , and has all the extra docs and a few new ones in HD.

'Conquest' has the theatrical cut and the international (better) version with more violence and the original ending left intact.

'Battle' also has 2 versions (one extended cut with a few deleted scenes restored and scene extends, usually 20-30 seconds each).

If you've loved these films like I have then you'll want them all. I'll buy the others individually either used or on sale, or hopefully, in a newly designed smaller case.",1225929600,5,1000,4.331550802139038

Hasslein Books to Release Planet of the Apes Chronology

To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Planet of the Apes film franchise,Hasslein Books will publish Timeline of the Planet of the Apes: The Definitive Chronology, by Rich Handley.

NEW YORK, Oct. 16, 2008--""Take your stinking paws off me, you damned dirty ape!"" This classic line, spoken by Charlton Heston in 1968's Planet of the Apes, ranks alongside ""May the Force be with you,"" ""Bond...James Bond"" and ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn"" as one of the most recognized bits of dialog in film history--and for good reason.

Planet of the Apes, created by French writer Pierre Boulle in his novel La plante des singes (""The Monkey Planet""), was crafted for the big screen by Rod Serling, Michael Wilson, Paul Dehn and others. In the series' first outing, Heston's Col. George Taylor found himself stranded in a madhouse of a future in which an oppressive ape civilization had inherited the Earth in the wake of mankind's evolutionary and revolutionary downfall.

This classic post-apocalyptic sci-fi drama has riveted audiences with its stunning performances, brilliant make-up work, resonant soundtrack and powerful statements on humanity, science and religion, as well as the jaw-dropping revelation in its legendary final moments. But the 1968 film was just the beginning of the story.

Four sequels, two television series, a 2001 film re-make, and more than a dozen novels and 120 comic books later, Planet of the Apes remains a living, breathing universe that celebrates its 40th anniversary (and Blu-Ray release) this year. To help commemorate this landmark event, Hasslein Books announces the upcoming publication of Timeline of the Planet of the Apes: The Definitive Chronology. This hefty volume will explore:

* How a small-scale simian rebellion grew, in so short a time, into a complete, planet-wide reversal of fates for humanity and apekind

* How the apes acquired the power of speech--while man was rendered mute

* Where the plague that ravaged the planet came from, and the effects it had not only on man and ape, but on other creatures as well

* The many unique ape and human cultures that spawned around the globe in the war's aftermath--and how the Statue of Liberty ended up in pieces on a desolate beach

Timeline of the Planet of the Apes: The Definitive Chronology explores these and other questions, presenting every recorded event of the Planet of the Apes saga in its proper chronological context--from long before Caesar's birth to far beyond Earth's destruction. This book covers every film, television episode, cartoon, novel, comic, short story and audio-tale produced under the Planet of the Apes banner over the past four decades--including a number of rejected or unpublished tales unavailable to fans. No other reference book has covered the expanded Apes saga so completely.

Along with a painstakingly detailed timeline spanning millennia, this volume features a gallery of more than 350 cover images, a recommended viewing/reading order, an examination of time travel in the Planet of the Apes mythos (both on screen and in print), and a title/creator index of published fiction--plus, insightful notes discussing preliminary and discarded story concepts, inconsistencies and discontinuities, unpublished lore and other fascinating trivia.

Timeline of the Planet of the Apes: The Definitive Chronology will be published as a 322-page softcover volume, at a cost of $24.95. A release date will soon be announced. Timeline of the Planet of the Apes is an unauthorized, unlicensed publication, created as an academic source-work. Planet of the Apes and all related characters, concepts and titles are the sole property of 20th Century Fox, with no copyright infringement intended.

If you buy these five movies individually you would spend around $60.00, so this is a real steal for five great movies.
I was blown away by the price !
I will update my review on the quality of the DVDs after I watch them and adjust my rating if necessary!

*Just noticed the price increased to $37.99 which is still a great deal, but I purchased the set for about $25.00 !!

**Just finished watching ""Escape""and the quality and sound is fantastic! This is the probably the best deal I've gotten at Amazon.

969696,4,6305076154,"40 years after its release, Planet of the Apes is still striking for its original soundtrack, impressive makeup and strong messages.  While obviously born out of the doomsday mentality of the Cold War, many of the themes are still relevant today: the clash between science and religion, the merits/consequences of withholding information for the public good, and the destructive tendencies of mankind, to name just a few.  In spite of the sometimes cheezy acting, we still get Charlton Heston's famous line - ""Get your stinking paws off me you damn dirty ape!""

After the first movie, the sequels go from bad to worse, and the premises go from far-fetched to utterly ridiculous but they are fun to watch (as long as you don't think too hard about the scientific explanations) and do a decent job of wrapping up a more complete explanation of how the apes rise, albeit with some crazy sidetracks. The sequels can be hard to find in video stores for purchase or rental so if you're going to go for it, you might as well own them all.",1218931200,,1031,4.685082872928176

I love any movie when Charton Heston is in it, and he delivers in this one. Unfortunately, he's only in the first two in this series.

969769,4,6305076154,"If you are a fan of ""Planet of the Apes"" this boxed set is worth every penny of the purchase price, plus more. The first film (starring Roddy McDowell, Kim Hunter, and of course the late, great Charlton Heston) is one of the greatest science fiction films of all time, and could be argued as one of the best films of any genre. The social message is timeless and remains as important and poignant today as it did 40 years ago. The sequels do fall off somewhat in quality from the original, but are all still worth watching and great in their own right.

But aside from the 5 great films, what really makes this set special is the inclusion of ""Behind the Planet of the Apes"", a documentary highlighting the production of all five films. It goes behind the scenes and gives you a fascinating look into the making of these classics. Another great bonus feature are the commentary tracks on the first film. One is by the legendary composer Jerry Goldsmith regarding the musical score, the other is by Roddy McDowell, Kim Hunter, Natalie Trundie, and makeup artist John Chambers. In both cases the commentaries are delightfully sparse, as the speakers merely highlight important and interesting details of the production, and do not ramble on like in too many commentaries.

The set would have gotten 5 stars in my opinion, but the quality of the later films in the series made it drop a point in my eyes. The later films are good films and very enjoyable, but pale in comparison to the original.",1207526400,5,1492,4.605263157894737

I was very happy to be able to find this set, not only for the movies, but for the sixth DVD on the background, from Pierre Boulle's 1963 novel, La plante des singes, through the making of the films, to the final movie; the last DVD is extremely informative and interesting.

969848,4,6305076154,"I rank the original ""Planet Of The Apes"" series very high among the plentiful output of science fiction movies of their era.  Although the special effects are not brilliant by today's standards (compensated for somewhat by the quality designs of what they were trying to capture, even if the execution seems somewhat hampered in retrospect) and the action sequences are occasionnally rather low-impact, the strengths of the series - a great, thought-provoking and memorable story that weaves through all five movies; solid and impressive characters among both human and ape; a nice job on the photography; and mind-blowing endings to most of the movies; make up for any shortcomings.

  The endings have become legendary, especially the finale to the first movie (which I'm certainly not going to give away here, in case anyone reading this is among the 22 or so people on the planet who don't yet know it; they even used to have the final shot on the Cover of one of the editions of the boxed set, for crying out loud).  The secrets of the conclusions to ""Beneath The Planet Of The Apes"" and ""Escape From The Planet Of The Apes"", however, aren't nearly as well-known by people who haven't seen the movies yet, which is good, because it gives one a chance to have some of the surprises unhampered by foreknowledge.  The end moments of ""Escape"", in particular, are haunting, the kind of thing that can give one chills just remembering it.

  It's hard to talk to much about the latter movies in the saga without giving away far too much.  The original, ""Planet Of The Apes"" has Earth astronauts making an emergency crash-landing on an unknown world, where it turns out that apes, not humans, are the dominant species.  Captured, the humans - indigineous to the planet but very primitive, in addition to the more scientifically advanced spacefarers - find themselves imprisoned in wooden cages (rudimentary equivelents to the barren metal cages of old, pre-'simulated natural habitat' zoos?).  The apes of the world are diverse - there are some who view the human population as mindless beasts without rights, while others are sympathetic to the humans's plight.  There is also considerable friction between the three races of apes - gorillas, orangitans, and chimpanzees (notice quite a few real-world parralells yet?).

  The series - which continues through ""Beneath..."", ""Escape..."", ""Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes"" and ""Battle For The Planet Of The Apes"" (disc 6 in the collection is a behind-the-scenes documentary) has some recurring characters, continues to introduce new ones, introduces new concepts and layers and twists to the concept.  By the 4th and 5th entries, the series is admittedly losing some steam, but judged on their own each of those is still a good movie.  Great price, too.  Any fan of adventure movies, science fiction, or movies that offer volumes of fodder for thought and dream, should consider picking this set of classics up.",1169856000,28,2961,4.993890020366599

Most become trekkies and Star Wars fanatics, and all those schmucks can have their Jean-Luc Picard cheesewheels, coz I'm a proud member of the Planet Of The Apes camp.  And I'm not monkeying around!  I absolutely love these films and have almost all my life.  Sure, as the sequels go on it tends to get a bit corny(especially when J. Lee Thompson takes over), but never becomes a joke.  The first one just can't be surpassed, but the second is a great followup and pretty damn dark.  Who as a kid wasn't creeped out by the telepathic humans even before they removed their masks?  Escape's concept seems like a bit of a stretch( like the apes could have salvaged Heston's ship from 300 feet of water and repaired it.  How the hell did they even know where it was?).  It also starts changing the rules that were established in the first film(the whole existence and downfall of intelligent man was kept a secret from the ape society, yet in this film it's common knowledge.  There's even an ape holiday like the 4th of July celebrating the apes' independence from humans.  This contradicts the first film and takes away from the corruption, paranoia and mystery of Zaius' charcater.  It's still a cool film that flipflops good guys and bad guys and has one hell of a downer ending.  By Conquest  it becomes a little easier to chuckle at the films, though it's still cool as hell.  Same goes for Battle.  The dates tend to get mixed up a bit too after the first film.  The rescue mission sent to find Heston lands about thirty years before Heston's landing in the first film!  I'm getting all nitpicky, but the fact is that these things are quite easy to overlook and are rather forgettable.  The documentary is a great two hour film that covers almost everything you wanted to know.  It's bizarre to think that up until Conquest they were trying to make ""family"" pictures and they all received G ratings(Conquest received a PG coz of some bloodless gun battles that were considered nonstop gore).  It's cool to think that in those days, seeing a guy killed by machine gun spray, talk of mating and castration, swear words, bare buttocks and skinless mutants were acceptable family entertainment.  This is a good set with a great treatment given to the films.  If you've got your eye on the big ape head set, let me offer some advice.  It's actually cheaper to buy all three sets individually if you find them for a decent price.  That way each disc is in it's own keepcase(which I prefer personally), and you don't have to feel like a schmuck with that rotten Tim Burton film sitting in your home.  I guess it's all a question of if you want the big head or not, which does look cool.  Go Ape!!",1161302400,14,2747,4.530487804878049

It's all here except the superior picture and 5.1 digitally remastered sound found in the new Legacy box set.

The picture and sound are a definite improvement over any of the television broadcasts but they still don't compare to the Legacy set. I don't understand why 20th Century Fox Studios didn't take the time to remaster all the movies at the same time when they had the chance. They've always had the ability to do it, because the Legacy set is proof of that. How many times can a studio release the same titles over and over and not make any improvements in picture & sound quality?

Now 20th Century Fox in an effort to gouge the fans some more have released ""The Planet of the Apes"" ultimate collection with deluxe Ape head packaging consisting of all the theatrical movies, TV series, animated series and Tim Burtons version. After considering the cost of the new ultimate collection the Evolution set is definitely a great value for any ""Planet of the Apes"" fan and a great place to start. If the ultimate picture and 5.1 sound are what you're after then I suggest to hold out and purchase the legacy set. I hope this review was helpful.

- Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972) - Roddy MCDowall plays Caesar, the son of Cornelius, leading an ape revolution against the humans.

969906,5,6305076154,"This upgrade of the August 21, 2000, Fox ""Evolution"" APES boxed set is a significant improvement over that release.  All of the films are now available in 16x9 anamorphic transfers, but more importantly each film has been remastered with improved picture and sound quality.

The first, and best, film PLANET OF THE APES (1968) is here actually a reissue of Disc 1 of the 2-Disc ""35th Anniversary Edition"" Fox released on February 3, 2004 (the extras-loaded 2nd disc has not been included in this set), with the same menu screens and sparse commentary tracks (thankfully one from the late, great Jerry Goldsmith), but it's a fine picture transfer of this important film, with the original 4-channel stereo soundtrack elements remixed in both Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS, and sound is very good for recordings that are over thirty-five years old.  (The DVD picture upgrade from Fox's original non-anamorphic one isn't perfect though, with some flicker and scratches visible.  Hopefully Fox will do another improvement from archival restored elements before this title comes to High Definition DVD.)

The picture quality of the four sequels to the original SF classic have been vastly improved with these THX-mastered anamorphic transfers.  The images on all are much brighter and sharper, with truer color fidelity, and just as importantly, their new Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtracks feature much better stereo separation and directionality than the previous DVD release.  (All the sequels were originally released theatrically in mono sound only.)

Still disappointing is the lack of extras for the sequels.  No commentary tracks, little if any still and poster galleries. (There are Easter Eggs of behind-the-scenes footage on the discs for ESCAPE and CONQUEST, though, that have been lifted from the 2nd Disc of the Anniversary edition for the original.)  The trailers for all of the films are still non-anamorphic, though, and that doesn't seem right.  Could it be that Fox is holding off on such things until the inevitable High Definition DVD release, possibly in time for the 40th Anniversary of the 1968 original in 2008?  Let's hope so.

Also disappointing here is the egregious cover art for each film, which I think is an effort to try and link these films to the ill-conceived 2001 ""reimagining"" of the franchise.  Fox should have stuck with something based on the original theatrical ad and poster campaigns.  This is usually what fans desire, but for some reason the people working for these home video companies don't seem to know it.

Finally, the disc of ""Behind the Planet of the Apes,"" the 1998 documentary on the making of the APES franchise, has been included once again here.  It's the exact same thing as found in the original DVD release with no enhancements.  Clips from the films are still non-anamorphic.  While this documentary was fine for its day, it's now nearly a decade old and should be retired.  Hopefully it won't reappear in any future High Definition release (new making-of featurettes should be produced).

So, if you're an APES fan and care about seeing these films in the best possible quality -- but don't care about paying over $100 for a ""Collector's Head"" -- this ""Legacy"" boxed set is an excellent buy... that is, until HD and Blu-ray DVDs.",1144540800,153,3279,5.046382189239332
969907,5,6305076154,"Word up to my pee-pees!  ""Battle for the Planet of the Apes"" is FINALLY available in it's extended cut.  Now, I know what some of you are thinking:  ""Battle for..."" is the nadir of the series, etc.  Well, I'm not going to pretend that the extended cut somehow transforms the movie into a lost masterpiece.  BUT it does improve the movie considerably.  This isn't incidental cutting-room footage, but rather very integral material that is vital to the entire ""POTA"" story arc.  I won't spoil any potential surprise if you haven't seen or heard about the restored footage, but it deals with the mutant humans and the doomsday bomb.  I can't imagine why this material was ever cut from the theatrical presentation!

As for the rest of the set, well the real reason to upgrade is the 16:9 transfers and the 5.1 Dolby Digital mixes that the sequels all have.  You can get the extended ""Battle for..."" separately if the better transfers and mixes aren't essential for you.  But if you look at the cost of the individual ""Battle"" disc and the cost of buying this new ""Legacy"" box, you might want to just take the plunge.

I love the Apes series, but I balked at the Ape-head mega set.  I HATE the Tim Burton doo-doo version.  I already have the live-action TV series.  Originally there were plans to make the animated series available separately, but that release was pulled.  I've never seen the cartoon series, maybe someday they will release it on it's own.  The Ape-head package looked sweet, but for the cost I'm fine with the upgraded films in the Legacy box.

I just wish they had produced a new documentary, the ""Behind the POTA"" has been reissued to DEATH (even though it is good, enough's enough!  Who (that actually wants it) doesn't have this release in some form by now??).",1144195200,13,1779,4.644230769230769

""planet of the apes"" (1968) began the whole saga as taylor(charlton heston) crashes his spaceship on a desert planet some 2 to 3000 years into the future. after a sureal trek through a desert they find plant life and water,and human life . the humans are caveman in type and don't talk. taylor and his friends are just thinking about what to do next when an unearthly hunt call sends the humans running and the bigest suprise of all,

 apes on horse back and with guns are hunting the humans. once seen the hunt will never be forgotten. as his friends are killed taylor is hurt and we learn that the apes rule this world. this is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made , as taylor fights for his life and a reason for a planet ruled by apes. in the end he finds his reason in one of the greatest endings ever put on film , and if you haven't seen it i'm sure you have heard of it.

  ""beneath the planet of the apes "" takes place just after the first films ends and adds another spaceman brent to the mix as he is sent to find out what happened to taylor, not as good as the first but still fun and action packed. and it looks like the end of the series.

  ""escape from the planet of the apes"" shifted the time line to modren day(read 1973) and put the apes in the forground as the ones we care about. a fun almost remake in reverse of the first it ends very downbeat but paves the way for the next in the series.

"" conquest of the planet of the apes"" takes place in the future(the 1980's) as a plague has killed all dogs and cats on earth and people have taken apes as pets,buthave found they make better slaves than pets.enter the son of the apes in ""escape"" as he leads a revolt and takes over the earth. this one is pg instead of g because of the dark nature of this one shot trip into a dark event. maybe the best of the whole series.

  ""battle for the planet of the apes"" the last in the series and the least of the films follows the apes after the revolt and sees their last fight against the humans that want to control them.

"" behind the planet of the apes "" tells the story of the making of all the movies and anything else you could want to know about the movies and is hosted by the late roddy mcdowell and is just great.

We've got some major release updates for you today.

First of all, we have the official skinny from 20th Century Fox on their upcoming celebration of all things Planet of the Apes on DVD. The centerpiece of the affair will be the 3/28 release of the 14-disc, THX-certified Planet of the Apes: The Ultimate DVD Collection (SRP $179.98). Here's a disc by disc list of the extras, as confirmed by the studio:

As you can see, what's new in The Ultimate DVD Collection are the new anamorphic transfers of the four classic Apes films that have previously been available in letterboxed widecreen only, along with the complete animated TV series (its first appearance on DVD and exclusive to The Ultimate DVD Collection) and a couple new extras on the 1974 live-action TV series. All of this comes with a special ""ape"" display case designed to replicate the original mask designs from the classic films. This is the kind of packaging that Fox has previously released in Japan only (with I, Robot and The Alien Quadrilogy), so you've got to at least give the studio credit for making it available to U.S. fans as well (expensive though it is).",1139961600,4,1251,4.575892857142857

969965,5,6305076154,"Franklin J. Schaffner's PLANET OF THE APES remains as powerful and significant as when it was released back in 1968. Derived from Pierre Boulle's fascinating book and written with knowing talent by legendary writer Rod Serling, the premise sees three astronauts crash land on a supposedly future distant world, but when the explorers are captured by apes, the truth slowly dawns on Taylor that this is no alternate planet, rather the world he left, shaken up like a snow globe, delivering a devastating post-apocalyptic civilization where man is treated as the inferior, and the apes reign supreme. From Jerry Goldsmith's chilling music to the amazing creature make up and costumes and Leon Shamroy's fantastic cinematography, the film is a technical marvel. The combination of veterans Roddy McDowall and Maurice Evans add gravitas to the characters. And to end a movie with Chuck Heston damning all humanity was so powerful and stunning, a sequel was inevitable. And while the law of diminishing returns does weigh heavily at times throughout the series, the impact that these films had on Hollywood cannot be denied.

 The first sequel, Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) takes a decidedly malicious turn when the underground mutant survivors take up arms against the militant ape warriors. Maintaining all the elements that made the first film such a hit, BPOTA is the series' best sequel. Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971) carries on the story, with Roddy McDowall reprising his role as Cornelius, where the apes travel back in time. Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972) is entertaining and intellectual, but sometimes tends to repeat on itself, and the by this point the audience enthusiasm had waned, but not before everything go wrapped up in the aggressive Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973). Technically speaking, all the Apes movies are great, but you can just watch the original as a stand-alone film, and marvel at the collective genius that gave the world a true glimpse of humanity gone awry. A fascinating slice of cerebral science fiction.",1123027200,9,2078,5.037790697674419

I used to have everyone of them on vhs but I decided to buy it on dvd because as we all know dvd is way better than vhs.  This is only for the people that have seen every or almost every planet of the apes movies before.  If you just liked the first one like a whole lot of people do than this is not for you.  You will bes wasting your money if you do that.  This is for the person who's seen everyone of them and really liked every single one.  I think Charles Heston in the first one did his finest acting.  Probaly his greates film ever.  In the second one it is a little bit different but I think almost as good as the first one.  We cannot forget Hunter and Roddy Mcdowell in the third one of course.  They did a suoperb job of acting and the third one probaly gets about four stars.  The fourth Planet of the Apes was probaly one of the most violent films of the seventies.  It was good though because I really liked the action.  The fifth was a great plot and a good way to end the saga.  The apes finally make the humans slaves again.

The star power plus the great themes and plots just add to the cool special effects that made the movies great and still make new fans out of latter generations.

970048,4,6305076154,"Planet of the Apes is a great ""What if"" tale.  There have been oodles of movies where the heroic space travelers lurch forward in time to find earth in a completely different state.  But when ""Apes"" was released and we found that the planet was ruled by monkeys, that took the cake!  Charlton Heston is one of our heroic space travelers here.  The theory of talking ape evolution is very interesting even if not very likely.  In one of the later of the Ape series we find that humans are using apes to perform menial tasks but an uprising takes place.  They are not only used as slave labor but mistreated as well.  Monkey racism I guess you'd call it.  That uprising is spearheaded by Ceasar, a talking chimpanzee (played by the late Roddy McDowall).

The series takes us forwards and backwards to show us how the simian race was able to take over in the first place.  Unfortunately, the later films in the series are not the same caliber as the first but some of you may still find them enteraining nonetheless.

As for the first Ape film, you would expect that the ape makeup would count for 90% of the acting but gratefully, the acting is top notch in spite of the makeup jobs. The ending really blows you away because you're involved in the film so much that you aren't trying to figure out where the astronauts have landed.  You just want to know why the monkeys are talking.  Also interesting is that the apes have their own heirarchy.  The gorillas are the brutes so they are all soldiers.  The chimps are intelligent so they are the scientists and the orangutangs are the elite so they rule the land.

I suggest that if you are not familiar with the entire series that you just start with Planet of the Apes for now.  At least that way if you're disappointed you can stop there and you won't have wasted money on the rest of the series which many consider to be substandard.

 Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) is nowhere near the quality of the first ""Apes"" but it's box office success lead to the relase of Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971) which is a little better storywise.  Then came Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972) and finally Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973).  If you're a collecter then you should have all the Ape films.  If you're really planning to watch them for entertainment value then Planet of The Apes and Escape from the Planet of the Apes are your best bets.",1101686400,,2417,4.408577878103838

970051,4,6305076154,"Fox once again invites fans to go ""ape"" with the 40th Anniversary Blu-ray edition of all five of the films in the ""Planet of the Apes"" series. The good news is that we get exceptionally good looking transfers for all five films AND we get the extended ""International cut"" of ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"" with its original more downbeat ending. Audio sounds quite good but keep in mind that this these films were shot and released anywhere from 40 to 33 years ago so they aren't going to sound like ""Transformers"".

It looks like almost all the extras from the previously released DVD boxed set released about a year and half ago EXCEPT the live action TV series and animated TV series (both of which should have been included to make this definitive even if they were in standard definition). These were included with the DVD limited edition set. We also get new featurettes on each film and its production featuring the authors of PLANET OF THE APES REVISITED book among others. Additionally, we get a couple of vintage featurettes on the production of the films, stills galleries, isolated music tracks and an excellent commentary track on ""Planet of the Apes"" featuring a variety of the original cast (most of whom have passed away)and crew. Sadly, the three people that would have been most important to hear on the commentary track passed away quite some time ago--director Franklin J. Schaffner, producer Arthur Jacobs and writers Rod Serling & Michael Wilson. Still, its an intelligent and informative commentary track.

The most annoying and unnecessary extra here is the introduction by a poorly rendered CGI of ""the Lawgiver"" character that John Huston played in the fifth film ""Battle for the Planet of the Apes"". It's not that it's necessarily a BAD extra just that it is unnecessary. It is an example of a good idea at the time that clearly no one really had any idea as to how to use it effectively.

We also get a deluxe hardcover book which has plenty of terrific looking photos (some of which have never appeared in print before)and text giving us background on the production of the films. Additionally, the cardboard fold outs of the ""box"" have timeline for the films, where they fit and what occurs in each. ALthough the book is nice and the packaging makes good use of all the extra cardboard, fans will probably find this a bit cumersome to store with their other DVDs or Blu-rays. Additionally, the films are held in place in the set with little pieces of clear rubber that will eventually fail allowing the discs to float around inside and become damaged. Again, this is an example of a idea that seemed good on the surface but was poor in execution. I would have preferred to have one Blu-ray holder like we saw with ""Blade Runner"". This box could easily have been redesigned to hold that AND the book making better use of the extra space of this boxed set.

Overall, this is quite a nice set--the images are sharp and crisp for the films. The book is an excellent glimpse behind-the-scenes and the timeline welcome. Just the packaging for the films themselves is lacking and the box a bit too big and cumbersome.

In ""Planet of the Apes"" astronaut Taylor (Charlton Heston) and his crew arrive on a planet where apes are the dominant species and man is a mute animal. He befriends Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius (Roddy McDowell)two chimpanzees who help prevent Dr. Ziaus (Maurice Evans) from carving up Taylor to protect their society. Five stars.

""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" has a different astronaut named Brent (James Franciscous) sent to discover what happened to Taylor and his crew. He and Taylor are caught in the middle of a war between apes and human mutants. Three stars-Working with a diminished budget Ted Post makes the best of his resources.

""Escape from the Planet of the Apes"" focuses on Cornelius (McDowell), Zira (Hunter)and Dr. Milo (Sal Mineo)who travel back in time to 20th century Earth using Taylor's recovered spacecraft. They pose a threat to the future of humanity in the eyes of Dr. Hesslin (Eric Braedon). Four stars-Clever ""fish-out-of-water"" variation on the first film.

""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"" stars McDowell as Cornelius and Zira's son Ceasar who forments revolution. It seems a plague has wiped out cats and dogs. Humans have adopted domesticated apes into their homes as pets and servants. Four stars particularly for the ""International Cut"". A pity J. Lee Thompson didn't have a bigger budget to make this the epic it deserved to be.

""Battle for the Planet of the Apes"" was the last film in the series (although there was a single season TV series that also starred McDowell as well as an animated TV series both of which are NOT part of this set). Caesar rules over a city where humans are second class citizens. When a conflict with the human survivors of his war occurs, Caesar must rally humans and apes alike to fight together for their survival. 2 stars-The weakest of the film series didn't was crippled by a weak screenplay by Joyce and John William Corrington (""The Omega Man"")and a nearly non-existent budget (a little over $1 million--essentially almost making this essentially a TV movie in terms of its scope).",1076198400,33,5214,4.771618625277162

The two hour documentary is interesting, but not tiring and represents all of the movies, and is not the rediculous six-hour documenary/reality show with boring actors whining about how hard it was to make the movie, like most DVD sets.

970053,2,6305076154,"First something positive.  I am a huge Rod Serling fan, and even if I do dislike Charlton Heston as a human being, I love Planet of the Apes.  That is to say that I love the original one.  It was very well written with Serling and blacklisted screenwriter Micheal Wilson on the bill.  The messages and ideas swirl through out questioning the existence of God, playing up the conflict of science vs. religion, looking at the treatment of animals, examining control and censorship and in the end leaving us with a very memorable message about mankind.  The acting is great, and it is quite simply a very solid well done film.  There should have never been another.  Hollywood execs like sticking with a sure thing, so if a movie does good, the answer is to make a sequel.  If the sequel does good, then make another.  Anyway they should have stopped with the original.  The second one was alright.  The message about the human race destroying the planet was good even if it was a little heavy handed.  There's just no reason for it to have been made.  Everything they did in that movie could have been done and has been done better else where(Dr. Strangelove off the top of my head).  That would be the last nice thing I could say about the series.  The third one ranks up there with one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  They took Rod Serling's original concept and butchered it to no end with a need for a clever twist that stopped being clever after the first one.  The monkeys come back to(gasp!)modern times, and they are treated like animals.  This would have made a bad made for TV movie.  Along side of some terrible acting and trite dialogue they give one of the worst explainations possible for how the monkeys evolved.  This aggrivated me about as much as George Lucas scientifically explaining the force in Episode I.  It made a great story and a great allegory in the first one.  There is no need to analyze how the monkeys got that way.  For one they try and do this with a logical argument when no logical argument could support it.  For two they precede in giving the most ridiculous explaination I could conceive of.  How does that explain how the humans devolved?  I am certainly not a realist, and am in fact a hug fan of absurdism.  The first one wasn't realistic and it still is a great film.  My problem was with inserting an explaination at all and then upon doing it treating a horribly written one as if it was intellectual discourse. Anyway I really wanted to rant about that, because it really bugged me.  I came here to see that everyone treated all five films as if they were cinematic gold.  I wanted to write a review for anyone out there who has intelligence and is wondering weather or not to buy this set.  Perhaps you liked the first one and you assume by all the good reviews the others must be as good.  The second one is adequate, the third is horrible and the last two are not even worth the time to pick them apart.  The writing and acting take a sudden noise dive into Ed Wood territory.  And I don't mean funny Ed Wood like Plan 9, more like Glen or Glenda, terrible and boring.  This set gets two stars because the first one is an amazing film which I would recommend to anyone.  Rent the second one to see if you like it before buying it, and don't waste any amount of money on the rest.  I am certain TNT will replay those movies at some point.  But I am afraid that there will be no way to get those six hours of your life back.",1047168000,8,3477,4.341614906832298
970094,4,6305076154,"This is a review which attempts to compare the original movies to the latest one and to the TV series.
Compared to the latest and ""tragic"" attempt at rehashing an old classic, ""The Evolution"" series of DVDs is a collector's masterpiece.
While one may praise make-up artists' efforts in the latest installment of ""Planet of the Apes"", which is logically far superior than the ""appliances"" they had to work with, back in the sixties and the seventies, one may not find Pierre Boulle's original novel anywhere.
I rate it at four stars, just because one can feel that the producers, not the cast and not even the crews, played the economic card. This is especially evident, starting with ""Escape from the Planet of the Apes"" and on to ""Battle for the Planet of the Apes"" which closely resembles a TV movie.
Pity, because the entire franchise would have been worth a much bigger effort. Even though I may understand, for various strategical reasons, the choice of having ""The Planet of the Apes"" as a post nuclear holocaust backward society, in the the original 1968 movie, I still am wondering why the same choice was made by Tim Burton in his remake.
Pierre Boulle's (the author) Apes' Planet, was far more advanced than human society on the Earth, the astronauts had left behind. This was meant to show that, no matter what man could destroy, other, probably more developed and advanced species (not necessarily Apes, but I guess this was a more poignant metaphor), could rebuild and by far, better than humans ever could.
This is why, although in the 1968 version, as I already mentioned before, I could still conceive the post-nuclear theme, which was far more in the minds of people involved in the Cold War, than just a more generalized critique against human kind, in the new version I simply cannot accept it.
Lack of imagination? Probably.
Lack of means? Not at all.
As the Star Wars franchise has shown, Cities and environments can be recreated through CG technology at much lower costs than ever before.
So why then not opt for the Pierre Boulle's original novel?
Your guess is as good as mine.
Anyway, the classic ""Planet of the Apes"" is far better and original in contents and storyline and has the advantage of an excellent cast, one could only dream for nowadays.
Even the music, of all five movies, reflected a much higher level at inventiveness and freshness.
These restored versions, bring back the original flair they possessed when they appeared in movie theaters everywhere.
Images are sharp and clear, colors are vivid.
The sound is another matter. While every effort was made to restore ""Planet of the Apes"" in its most minute detail, including its sound, with an excellent Digital Dolby 5.1 remix, not so happened with the other four movies.
Again, ""Escape from the Planet of the Apes"", is the most dubious example, being the only one that doesn't even sport a Dolby Surround Mono mix, but just a polished Mono one.
I can only assume that the only original copy remaining is available like that. In which case, I think it was wise not to digitally attempt at ""fussing"" with the sound, as it was the case with other movies and in which it totally failed.
But, should a ""stereo"" copy emerge, I would suggest to use that one to re-release this movie.
And yet, I suspect that this particular movie was plagued by the same financial restrictions of the others, probably more and might therefore have had a ""mono"" treatment.
The other ones, like ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"", ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"" and ""Battle..."" could have deserved the attention that their forerunner had.
All in all, the five movies are more entertaining and well-made than the latest concoction by Tim Burton.
If you truly want to be astonished and thrilled by a science fiction movie series, than I would suggest to stick to the originals.
They had creativity, imagination, solid stories and excellent acting, all combined into a firework of surprises beyond which today's ""remakes"" pale miserably away.
A note about the complete ""Planet of the Apes"" TV series. If you are really enjoying retro-spectacles, especially '70s style, then you may be well served.
But, be warned, the series, having suffered the same financial restrictions as their movie counterparts, lack luster and are even dull in comparison. There is no more development of the characters (besides, the original ones, have long disappeared and been replaced by others) and the plots, except for two episodes out of fourteen, are always the same. The main conducting theme is ""Escaping the the Planet of the Apes"" and while it may be fun to watch for a couple of episodes, it starts to become weary and tiresome at the third one.
The transfer was made, by just transferring the filmed material to DVD. No sound remix, no video cleansing. Evident scratches may be noticed almost in every episode. The sound is pure monaural seventies' TV style. No luster here.
If you are a true ""Planet of the Apes"" fan, stick to ""Planet of the Apes - The Evolution"" DVD collection. It's the only valid choice and the only one worth the money.
Included in the Evolution collection, is also the 2-hour
documentary ""Behind the Planet of the Apes"" hosted by Roddy McDowall (who played the chimps Cornelius and Caesar in the movies and Galen in the TV series), which I truly recommend for its deep insight in the work behind such an immense effort and for its social studies' aspect, reflecting the mind-frame of society in those years.
This collection is the only true gift one can make to a die-hard fan of ""Planet of the Apes"". All the rest would be wasted money and time.",1039737600,5,5625,4.77025641025641

(The bonus disc includes a great documentary originally presented on AMC but it is not even an original production for this set.)  Worst of all, the disc of the final movie is an edited version of the original commercial release, deleting all reference to the doomsday bomb that ties the human community in the fifth movie to the one found in the second movie.  Of course, none of the sequels do justice to the original so some could argue that this is no big loss.  But the only person that could possibly want the entire series would be a true fan, who wouldn't want even the corniest material cut out.  So the producers of this boxed set have ruined it for the only market that might get some satisfaction out of it.

970101,3,6305076154,"What we have here is without a doubt a mixed bag. Sure the original Planet of the Apes is a sci-fi classic for the ages, with its brilliant acting, directing, social commentary, and the greatest movie ending ever. Then on came the sequels, all four of them, each one cheesier and goofier than the one before it. This of course was thanks to smaller and smaller budgets (the quality of the movies would have been far increased if a little more money was spent), and the increasingly sloppy directing. (Schaffner why did you have to direct ONE film?) Plus the plots of the next four films contradict the plot of the first one more and more with each movie. While the sequels were good at times (sometimes great) they were never consistently good.
But thats not the reason this box is a 3 star affair. This gets that rating for its lack of any interesting extras. All we have is some cheesy trailers, and an interesting documentary, but one that is now available on a separate DVD.
So if you want a piece of the Planet of the Apes legacy I would buy the original movie on its own and the documentary and save yourself some money. Or, if you really want to buy the whole series, buy the set on VHS, and save about 30$. But,otherwise, be a smart shopper and leave this set alone.",1015027200,,1274,4.4025423728813555
970102,3,6305076154,"If I were reviewing the first Planet of the Apes by itself, I would give it a very strong 5 stars. Despite Heston's rather comic overacting, the first movie, scripted by Rod Serling and based upon a novel, is actually a very serious and well-done social satire, which is especially effective if you do not know how it ends (although these days most people who haven't even seen it do know how it ends).
Unfortunately, the power of the original movie is ruined by the increasingly silly sequels. No longer (spoiler warning: skip to next paragraph), thanks to the sequels, did humanity destroy itself through war and get replaced by evolved apes. Instead, acccording to the sequels, a couple of the apes from the first movie travel back in time (the end of Beneath...) and have a child who becomes leader of the apes (movie #3). Humans start (quite illogically) breeding apes for intelligence despite their fears of being replaced and killed by intelligent apes as predicted by the time travellers (movie #4), and then this new breed of intelligent apes winds up going to war with the humans (movies #4 and up). This ruins the whole message in the first movie about the self-destructiveness of man. Thus watching the sequels is analogous to watching all the characters who triumphantly survived the end of Aliens just arbitrarily be killed off in Alien 3: it feels like you have been cheated. Rewatching the first movie, I do my best to shut out memories of what happens in the sequels.
Even with the message of the first movie destroyed by the sequels, the subsequent films are kind of fun to watch for their schlock value with their increasingly poor production values and dumb scripts. Despite this, even as a fan of bad films, I find the sequels a bit boring (the later the film the worse it gets).

970136,4,6305076154,"When I was a kid, ""Planet of the Apes"" merchandise flooded the stores.  Action figures, puzzles, guns, masks; we had it all.  Unfortunately, we had to rely on the scheduling whims of network executives in order to watch the actual films that spawned this kitschy bonanza.  The Age of Cable, VHS and DVD has dawned, and now we have the movies to enjoy whenever we want to time travel to a world where apes dominate.  It's a decidedly downbeat and pessimistic world, but one that continues to fascinate.
 And this DVD set contains the entire 5-film series, so you can watch the devolution from highly-original concept into low-budget mediocrity.  Fortunately, though, the ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise was almost always entertaining, even as inspiration ran low.  Let's look at the films in order, shall we?  Set controls for the year 3978... or 3955, depending on the movie.
 Planet of the Apes:  The original, which over the years, has picked up some only marginally justified camp baggage.  Charlton Heston plays a misanthropic astronaut who, ironically, becomes humanity's sole defender.  Maurice Evans persecutes him as orangutan Dr. Zaius (who knows more about ape history than he lets on), and Roddy McDowall (soon to become synonymous with playing chimps on-screen) and Kim Hunter (and Oscar winner for ""A Streetcar Named Desire""!) portray Cornelius and Zira, his chimpanzee defenders.  With the lovely, fur-bikinied Linda Harrison as Nova, Heston's mute main squeeze.  A genuinely thought-provoking and thrilling classic, despite a few heavy-handed attempts at humor.  Worthy of special note is Jerry Goldsmith's dynamic, percussive score.
 Beneath the Planet of the Apes:  The bizarre, somewhat inferior, sequel, which suffers from a lower budget (witness the really poor ape masks on the extras, and a few gorilla soldiers in flimsy outfits).  James Franciscus crashes to earth to find Heston, and instead finds Ms. Harrison and the apes.  Everyone's back from the first except McDowall (this is the only ape film he missed).  As a special bonus, James Gregory (""The Manchurian Candidate"") plays a war-hungry gorilla general with gusto.  Features some interesting vistas of a bombed-out New York, and a memorable mutant unmasking scene.  A veritable camp-fest, and a lot of psychedelic fun.
 Escape from the Planet of the Apes:  An inversion of the original concept, and quite a bit closer to Pierre Boulle's original novel.  McDowall returns, and with Kim Hunter and Sal Mineo (""Rebel Without a Cause""), journeys back to the present day United States, only to run afoul of a sinister government scientist.  Vivacious performances by McDowall and Hunter salvage it somewhat.
 Conquest of the Planet of the Apes:  A more violent entry in the series, but tame by today's standards.  McDowall plays his own character's son, a chimp named Caesar who is destined to overthrow humanity.  And that's pretty much what he does.  Ricardo Montalban performs admirably, but the series was beginning to fray with lower and lower budgets.  The final visuals will chill you, though.
 Battle for the Planet of the Apes:  The final film.  McDowall attempts to divine the future, but invites the wrath of disenfranchised humans.  A miniscule budget (evidenced mainly in the final, underwhelming battle scenes) devastates this one, although the script's not too bad.  Claude Akins makes a fine villainous gorilla, diminutive singer/songwriter Paul Williams has some memorable lines as a wise orangutan, and director John Huston portrays the legendary Lawgiver in the framing sequences.  Award yourself a banana if you can spot ""Animal House"" director John Landis as one of the humans.
 The complete DVD set includes a 2-hour documentary, hosted by Roddy McDowall himself.  It's fun for the serious ""Apes"" fan.  It features a lot of trivia, and talking head interviews with the major players, including Heston, make up artist John Chambers, and producer Richard Zanuck.",996537600,22,3959,5.230524642289348

2. at the end of the film, Mendez and Alma decide to not launch the bomb.  instead, they worship it - with Mendez as the leader.
These two scenes nicely round out the entire series, but were only shown in the TV version.  Why Fox didn't include them in the film, or at least as special features, is beyond me.

970202,4,6305076154,"It's hard for me to talk POTA without invoking lots of misty-eyed nostalgia for my misspent youth.  The Apes movies were my first taste of sci-fi/fantasy, and have informed more of my likes and dislikes than I care to admit.
Let me just say that the six disc boxed set (all five movies plus a new documentary disc) is worth every penny of admission money.  The films sparkle on DVD (non-anamorphic, but you can't have everything), and Fox has gone to lots of trouble to make the menus and special features eye-catching and fun.
Of course, the highlight is the original film, with its fantastic script, sets and make-up.  Here's a movie that bears repeated watching; with the exception of some of Heston's musings and sermonizing on life and the state of man (most definitely Rod Serling's contribution to the script), this one is as fresh today as it was in 1969.
BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES, the second film in the series, is almost as much fun as the first.  Much - but not all - of the social commentary has been jettisoned in favor of action and chase scenes, and the makeup takes a few steps backwards, but this one is still a sentimental favorite.  You've just gotta love those radiation-burned mutants, militaristic gorillas, and a series-ending finale that somehow didn't end the series.
ESCAPE, the third feature, feels the most dated, but that's to be expected, given the setting.  McDowell and Hunter give their best ape performances here.  If you can get past the annoying made-for-TV soundtrack (even though it was a theatrical release), you're well on your way to enjoying this film.
The fourth film, CONQUEST, ties up loose ends and brings the whole series full circle.  I can't say it's a great film, but it is essential to the Ape mythos.
Most fans consider BATTLE to be the lightweight of the series, but it still has much to recommend it.  Here's a fast-paced action film made with the kids in mind, but hard-core APES fans will find it worth a view.
The documentary disc is a great behind-the-scenes look at all things APE, with special emphasis on pre-production and production of the original film.  McDowell's closing question, as he muses on the future of the APES film franchise, has been answered affirmatively:  Tim Burton's version of POTA is swinging our way this summer.  If it's half as good as the original, it should be very good indeed.
Apes on DVD?  Pricey, but worth it.  Now if we can only get the live-action and animated series released as a tie-in to this summer's remake, I'd be one happy chimp indeed.",984787200,14,2546,4.692134831460674
970203,4,6305076154,"In a lot of ways the planet of the apes series is a lot like the old ""Star Trek"" TV series, some of them are well written, thought provoking, but also, sometimes cheesey and low budget.
PLANET OF THE APES
The first movie, and probably the best, features Charlton Heston (in all of his scenery-chewing glory) as a (1970's!) astronaut on an interstellar mission to do something or other who crash lands on a mysterious planet inhabited by mute humans and talking, dominant apes.  Taylor is captured by the apes and when it is learned that he can speak, he challenges the whole social order of the ape society.  The apes inhabit a Flintstone-esque city and are divided into three different castes, the Orangutangs, who are the politicans and keepers of the faith, and seemingly the caste in absolute control, the Gorillas, whoa re the workers and the soldiers, and who seem to occupy the lowest position, and the Chimpanzees, who are the scientists and intellectuals.  The movie features a lot of veiled and not-so-veiled political and social commentary.  It's a fun and well-written movie.
BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES
This and the last movie are probably the weakest chapters.  In this second installment, ANOTHER astronaut crashes on the the planet looking for Charton Heston's character.  The problem with this movie is that it is both too similar, and way too different from the first movie.  There are sequences in this movie involving some mutants that are Mystery Science Theater 2000 worthy.  It has some interesting (if not at all subtle) commentary on war and militarism.  The ending is quite a surprise and does not set itself up for a sequel.
ESCAPE FROM PLANET OF THE APES
This may be the best of the five.  ""Escape"" is very different from all the other movies, for the most part, it is much lighter in tone and more fun and witty.  It has some of the same feel that ""Star Trek IV"" had.  This one finds the two chimpanzees, Vera and Cornelius on Earth in a refurbished spacecraft and their subsequent adventures in Los Angeles before a paranoid government worker senses their offspring will dominate the Earth.  In this installment, the two chimpanzees played by Roddy McDowell and Linda Hunt take center stage with their absolutely charming performances.  The end is a downer though.
CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES
This is the darkest and most overtly political chapter featuring Roddy McDowell as the son of Vera and Cornelius, who leads a revolt among the ape slaves in a futuristic Earth.  This is both a sequel and a prequel to the original movie as it shows how the apes came into power to begin with.  Once you get past the improbable premise-ape slaves anyone? and the ""futuristic"" design of the film, this one is the most socially relevant and the most contemporary of all of them.  The imagery is straight from the Twentieth Century, rioting, police brutality, torture, war, revolution.  And it seems that the revolutionary tone and the violence were toned down from the original cut of the move.
BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES
This is the worst of the five.  It's seriously dumbed down and made innoculous from the previos entry.  Something about apes and mutants and humans.  It would have been better if they had taken a cue from the previous movie and fleshed out the backstory a little, for example explain how the social order in the original film came to be, or how the humans became mute savages.  They should have had more fun with the idea of a prequel.
Anyway, this set also come with a great documentary that touches upon all the movies and features interviews with the cast, make-up tests, and everything.  This is a great set.",984700800,4,3670,4.726844583987441

If you grew up on these too then get this collection and you'll be watching them your entire lifetime...and so will your kids...and so will whatever evolutionary being appears after us...ha ha!
I figure I first discovered the Planet of the Apes in 1974 with the TV series (I wish they'd release those on DVD, or VHS, as well).  Eventually I'd see the 4th film ""Conquest"" then the 5th ""Battle"".  I remember getting a Planet of the Apes jigsaw puzzle in a can with Claude Akins ape character from ""Battle"" sitting on a horse.  I'll bet I put that thing together 50 times.  I wish I still had it.  I may have had some action figures too.  In the late 70s or early 80s I saw the first film and then the others.  They now produce that nostagic feeling every time I watch them.  I know people have their likes and dislikes about each one, but to be honest I like them all equally well.
Now, as for this DVD collection, I found that the picture quality on the 1st, 2nd, and 5th films to be superior to the other 2.  Although none were disappointing.  The 5th film, ""Battle"", was quite colorful and sharp in the closeups with very little graininess.  It made me enjoy that 5th film more than ever before.  The overall sound on the films was a mixed bag on my PC-based DVD system (probably my slow 350mhz processor with an ATI DVD player).  There was a lot of scatching and popping on the 2nd & 5th films, as well as the documentary.  If fact, the documentary would simply stop and I'd have to restart that section.  The full screen picture is more cumbersome to a computer's CPU than widescreen.  But definately worth the effort since the documentary was as good as the films themselves.  Aside from the accational sound difficulty, each film ran smoothly on my system without many noticable hiccups.  A dedicated DVD system may not have these problems.
This ""Evolution"" collection was a Christmas gift from my mom and dad.  They know what I like!  I can't wait to watch them all again.",979344000,4,2069,4.43236074270557
970206,3,6305076154,"Let me start out by saying the only reason I didn't give PLANET OF THE APES -- THE EVOLUTION series more stars is because as DVDs go, there are little extras and the sound was less than spectacular.  Other than that, this is a great set.  The first movie is (I believe in most people's opinion) the best one. But the others are wonderful too (although BATTLE FOR... is kind of lame).  As a kid I used to watch them on Channel 9's (then WWOR-TV) 4:30 movie after school and never realized the political and social relevance each film contained ... I just thought they were cool monkey movies. But after watching them all again (even the hokey ESCAPE FROM...), I learned that they were and still are important statements about social equality and injustice -- while still being cool monkey movies!

970272,4,6305076154,"Planet of the Apes is a really absurd and way cool movie with tons of...well...APES!  The first movie is probably why Charlton Heston is the head of the NRA now, in case the apes ever find him (I'm kidding, of course).  It's the best one in the series, and has the all time best ending in 1960's sci fi this side of ""SOYLENT GREEN IS PEOPLE!!  IT'S PEEEEEOOOOPPPPLLLLE!""  Man, Charlton Heston rules.  The second movie is like a Star Trek episode with guys in gorilla costumes, and the third is just too whimsical for it's own good, but it has Ricardo Montalban in it, so it's still watchable.  Then we get to my favorite, Conquest of the Planet of the Apes!  This movie ROCKS.  It's about a talking chimp named Ceasar who turns people's pet apes into a pack of millitant monkeys that wage war on their former masters.  The ending is so over the top!  A must see.  Finally, I didn't really watch the whole Battle for the Planet of the Apes, it was kinda cheesy compared to Conquest, but it had John Houston as an ape, which was really surreal.

If you've never seen the series, you won't miss it.  But if you've been watching these films all your life - where was the scene where the radiated man and woman decide not to explode the Alpha Omega bomb, but decide to worship it?  This leads (timeline-wise) directly to the mutants in 'Beneath the Planet of the Apes'.
This has changed the entire tone of the series!  The pre-destination has been tossed out for a feel-good ending!
Is this only in the boxed set, or did FOX also cut the individual DVD release?
Do the director, writer, and AP Jacobs' widow know about this?

970274,5,6305076154,"Planet of the Apes may be the strongest science fiction film series ever.
Hear me out on this.
It had a single story thread that carried through the films.  The ending of Planet of the Apes is one of the classic shock endings of all time, right up there with ""it's a sled"" and ""She's a man"" (the latter being so good that's it's been used many times in many different films)  In every way, Man is responsible for his own downfall.  In the first film we believe its by simple atomic holocaust, but as the films go on we learn it's even more than that.
There's a bit of a hole in the narrative, I'll admit.  There had to have been a MASSIVE amount of discoveries made about Man's history between Planet and Return, because in the first film they don't know spit-in-a-cup about their past, but by the time Cornelius and Zira get away before the planet gets the big finger at the end of Return, they have learned all about how apes rose and overthrew man, in great detail (Not to mention how to repair, fuel and navigate a spaceship through a time warp, but I digress)  But the rest of the story is so strong you don't mind.  In Escape, they TELL the government, almost verbatim, how everything happens, and in the next film (Conquest) after it all happens, the virus that kills all cats and dogs, they're still ready to train apes, figuring they'll be okay cause they know what to avaoid, merrily trundling down the path of destiny.
And let's face it.  Paul Willams as an orangutan.  How can you NOT love these movies?
I don't forsee the remake getting the idea right.  It'll be fun to watch, lots of action, but I don't see the heart of the story being done right.  See this instead.",976752000,,1681,4.358974358974359

After seeing the first one I went ape nuts! I loved the movie! Great cast of characters including Charlton Heston, Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, and Shakespearean actor Maurice Evans. I only wish I hadn't known the ending so it would have been a total shock. The sequel, Beneath the Planet of the Apes,  wasn't quite as good as the first and had lots of elements that could have been seen on a 60's Star Trek episode, but was still very enjoyable. The third film, Escape from the Planet of the Apes, is my second favorite. This time the main characters aren't the humans that we routed for in the first two, but the apes themselves. Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall give their best performances ever in this film. There is even comedy relief which is very well done. Then there's Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, my least favorite of the series. This film is good, but the logic behind the apes evolution from just your average zoo animal into upright standing, almost human, creatures in only 20 years is just unimaginable. There are a few good points that tie this one into the others really well however. The final film, Battle for the Planet of the Apes, is pretty good and has a great ending for the entire film series. But there is also the bonus 6th disc. A documentary on the entire Apes saga narated by the late Roddy McDowall with lots of great info. These films spawned a huge franchise of merchandise, tv series, and cartoon series. I now am going crazy buying Planet of the Apes comics, toys, and cd's whenever I find them. And in 2001 a brand new Planet of the Apes movie is coming out, a remake of the original directed by Tim Burton. If it's as good as the original then what Episode 1 did for Star Wars, this new Apes film will do for the Planet of the Apes franchise. We may be seeing lots of Apes in the near future.

970321,4,6305076154,"The curious thing about this series is that the quality of the movies (i.e. image, cinematography, art direction)as the series progresses gets  steadily worse -- this is clearly a result of the diminishing budget as  pointed out in the behind the scenes documentary.  The ideas, conflict and  philosophy however, grow more and more interesting and profound as the  series progresses.  To put it another way:  The physical quality of the  movies (visuals) is inversely related to the philisophical quality (social  commentaries, issues).  Some of the sets in the later episodes are quite  bad -- sometimes they look like sets from the 60's Batman series...and the  acting isn't much better, however the concepts are nonetheless intriguing  enough that it hold's ones interest.

Arnold will not take off his clothes any more :(. Someone needs  to tell him this is necessary. Why do new movies stink? What happened? Was  it so impossible to make a GOOD series of movies like the Planet of the  Apes Cycle? They did not have CGI. They had cheesy spaceships and an  interesting twisty thoughtful plot.

970324,5,6305076154,"Finally, after many years on TV, and quit a nice run on VHS, the series comes to DVD, although not without some drawbacks:
*The DVD remasters are  *superb* picture quality, but it is beyond me why Fox chose to remaster  only ""Planet Of The Apes"" in 5.1 Dolby; the remainder are 2.0,  except for ""Escape"" which is in *mono*.  I get around this by  using the ""5 channel stereo"" effect on my receiver.
*The 5.1  sound on the original ""Planet..."" is *not* true 5.1; rather, an  enhanced 2.0...kind of like listening to Beatles music in ""simulated  stereo"".
*The booklet for ""Planet..."" contains the cues  for ""Beneath..."".  Why this is the case...I have *NO* idea.  However, the ""timeline"" information in the booklet is pretty  cool.
So...why 5 stars?
Because these films are, imho, *brilliant*  SF, when observed together as an arc.  Yes, there are some shortcomings in  the series (most notably ""Beneath..."" and ""Battle...""),  but overall, this is *classic* SF.  Take a few hours on a rainy day and  watch ALL of these flicks...and you'll see what I mean.  In fact, do as I  did, and try starting from ""Escape..."" and run through the cycle  so that you end with ""Beneath..."".  It puts a whole new  perspective on things.
Also, as I previously mentioned, the transfer to  DVD is absolutely *superb* as far as picture is concerned.  Just look at  ""Planet..."" during the scene when Taylor and his crew are at the  edge of The Forbidden Zone, searching of water, and you'll notice some  human (ape?) figures in the cliffs above them, running along side them up  in the cliffs..  I *never* noticed that before!  It was eye opening!  Also,  the crash sequence in ""Planet..."" is better than ever.  Now, SF  fans...is *that* the *coolest* spaceship, or what!  Gets my vote!
If you  grew up watching the movies in the movies (like I did), or on TV, then buy  the whole shebang.  If you dislike any of the sequels and don't want to  spend the cash, just buy the original...WELL worth it at *any* price.  In  fact, it's the classic nature of the original film that completely  outweighs any flaws in the sequels which drives my 5 star rating.

The social commentary is as valid today  as it was when the series began in 1968 (hard to believe it was that long  ago).  The real gem of the new DVD box set is the behind the scenes disc, I  recently caught part of this on one of the Satellite channels, Bravo or  A&E.... I really enjoyed what I saw of it and am now glad I have a copy  of it for my own.
I got the set and brought it home, my girlfriend wasn't  too thrilled when I showed it to her and she only seemed to have a passing  interest in it and just wanted to see ""the monkey people"".  During the beginning she was panning the movie but more because of the  usual overacting by Charlton Heston but once the Apes appeared in the  ""man hunt"" sequence she really started to enjoy the movie and by  the end of it she was asking when we can watch the next installment so even  to somebody who never saw the films it turned into a very enjoyable  viewing.

The first film is a true sci-fi classic, featuring the  greatest ending to any sci-fi film in history. However, the writers,  desperate to continue this series at any cost, concocted a storyline that  insults the intelligence of anyone with half a brain. One of the most  crucial questions about this saga is; how did the apes become intelligent?  The answer lies in the third film, in which we are expected to believe a  primitive ape society somehow managed to salvage and repair a spaceship  that was damaged beyond any plausible plot device to make it spaceworthy.  And yet, that is what happens, as Cornelius and Zira somehow pilot this  thing and manage to reverse the time warp from the first film and go back  to the 20th century.  That piece of fantasy, however, is outdone by  the mindnumbing plot device of the fifth film, in which only 20 or so years  after gaining independence, all apes can now speak and reason, which should  be impossible, since the only two who should be able to do so are Caesar  and his son. The only films in the series worth watching are the first two.

970327,1,6305076154,"{rant on}  Why release in LETTERBOX instead of WIDESCREEN ANAMORPHIC? This is a great series, filmed in widescreen.  It is unconscionable that anyone  would opt for this restrictive format.
The issue is that with the  LETTERBOX format, people with 16:9 TVs still see the black borders at the  top and bottom of the screen and THEIR picture will be horribly distorted,  while people with 4:3 aspect ratio TVs will see a nicely formed perspective  correct image.
If this series were released as a Widescreen ANAMORPHIC,  both TVs would see the film correctly - since the DVD player will create  the borders for you.  Those with 4:3 would see the black borders at the top  and bottom, and those with 16:9 would see a full screen (if filmed at  1.77:1 or 1.85:1) or a very small black border if filmed at  2.35:1.
Nobody should be releasing movies in Widescreen Letterbox  anymore, period.  There's no excuse.  They must release DVDs in WIDESCREEN  ANAMORPHIC!

And take note of Charleton Heston, a magnificent actor-turned shill  for the NRA, showing his bare butt in the court scene. :)
 Part 2,  Beneath, seems like the end, but it's really the beginning.  Get it?  You  will.  Overall, it's a bit schlocky, but fun.
Part 3, Escape, comes close  to the best story.  Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter are fun to watch as they  return to the early 70s in Heston's original ship.
Part 4, Conquest , is  a gritty and brutal episode mirroring the race and anti-war protests of the  1960s.  Don Murray overacts to the gills.  There was a much different  ending that was cut from the film before it was released.
Only part 5,  Battle, is somewhat of a turkey with poor production values and cheesy  acting.  Director John Huston plays ""The Lawgiver.""  Roddy is  good.  So is veteran Lew Ayres.
The winner in the box set is the AMC  documentary on the making of these films.  Otherwise, the lack of exras  would be a problem.  The transfers are sadly not anamorphic, but they still  rate about a 3 out of 5.

Beneath  The Planet Of The Apes is a good second effort.  I just wish Charlton  Heston would've starred in the entire picture instead of the beginning and  ending. (note: the trailer for this film is different from the one given on  the VHS version (you can still see parts of that one on the documentary)).  Escape From The Planet Of The Apes is a very original installment which  takes place in the past circa 1973.  This one is lighter and more fun up  until the end.  Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes is the most underated of  all the Apes films.  This is the only ape film that recieved a PG rating  for violence and deservedly so, but what makes this one unique is Roddy  McDowell's understated performance as Ceaser, the ape who would lead his  brothers and sisters to victory over the humans who have enslaved them.  This is the darkest of the set and, to me, deserves better recognition.  Battle For The Planet Of The Apes is a decent 5th installment.  This film  was made primarily for the kiddies, so, bearing that in mind you should  know what to expect and even so, this film is still quite entertaining.  None of these films were a boxoffice failure.  They all made money.

These movies are still VERY cool. Heston gives a weight to the  original that elevates it beyond it's already lofty script and direction.  It's more than just a sci fi action flick; it's mythologically and  philosophically engaging- something that many of the Trek films couldn't  achieve (but I like them too).  I must confess, though. Battle for the  Planet of the Apes does have several inconsistencies with the first two  films.

970394,3,6305076154,"If you're an ""Apes"" fan, you've probably already pre-ordered this set. If you're an ""Apes"" newbie, maybe you'd better rent some of them first. Here's my take on the 5 films:
PLANET OF THE APES -  This wildly popular but heavy-handed and amateurishly directed film of  Pierre Boulle's ""Monkey Planet"" still has a great idea going for  it. Charlton Heston (overacting as usual) is Taylor, an astronaut stranded  in a future world run by a corrupt ape government that keeps humans as  slaves. Heston is pretty annoying, but after he's shot in the throat and  captured, we identify with his repeated attempts to show the apes he's  intelligent. Befriended by sympathetic chimpanzee scientists Zira (Kim  Hunter) and Cornelius (Roddy McDowall), Taylor escapes with his new love  interest Nova (Linda Harrison) and, in the famous shock ending, finds out  where he really is. Repetitive and slow-paced, but fun. With Oscar- winning  make-up by John Chambers, one of Jerry Goldsmith's cruder scores, and lots  of messagey dialogue about evolution -- you can tell Rod Serling worked on  the screenplay. Directed by Franklin J. Schaffner (who did  ""Patton"" next).
BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES - A lot less  poky than the original, and generally more entertaining. Taylor and Nova  ride across the Forbidden Zone. Taylor stumbles into the hide-out of some  radiation-scarred mutants who presumably survived the nuclear holocaust.  They worship a big atomic bomb. The lonely Nova meets another astronaut,  Brent (James Franciscus), who's less condescending towards her than Taylor  was, though he does try to kill her a couple of times under the telepathic  influence of the mutants. Meanwhile, a cadre of gorillas led by Dr. Zaius  (Maurice Evans) and the warmonger General Ursus (James Gregory) delve into  the Forbidden Zone looking for Brent and Nova. There's some funny, dated  social commentary (the pacifist chimpanzees hold a sit-in peace protest  against the gorillas) and a typical 1970 ending in which the bomb is  detonated and a narrator intones, ""An insignificant green planet is  dead."" Big Chuck was finished with the ""Apes"" saga but  returned the next year in another post-apocalypse cult favorite, ""The  Omega Man.""
ESCAPE FROM THE PLANET OF THE APES - Cornelius (Roddy  McDowall) and Zira (Kim Hunter), along with a third chimpanzee, Milo (Sal  Mineo), manage to escape from Earth 3955 before it blows up. They land on  Earth 1973. The tables are turned as Cornelius and Zira are befriended by  kindly scientists Bradford Dillman and Natalie Trundy. Cynical genius Eric  Braeden (now on ""The Young and the Restless"") wants to kill the  apes, who are expecting a baby. Helpful circus owner Ricardo Montalban  takes them in and adopts their baby, who goes on to star in the next  installment. Passable entertainment, but it's no fun watching the likable,  witty Cornelius and Zira become hairy martyrs. With a rinky-dink score by  Jerry Goldsmith and a confusing explanation of infinite regression. Watch  for M. Emmet Walsh as the military aide with the oranges, and don't get too  attached to Milo.
CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES - It's 1991, and  humans have turned apes into pets because all the cats and dogs were killed  by an outer-space virus in 1983. Over the past eight years the apes got  smart enough to be conditioned as domestic servants. Enter Caesar (Roddy  McDowall), the adult son of Cornelius and Zira. Caesar's friend Ricardo  Montalban has kept him away from society. When Caesar sees how humans are  brutalizing apes, he gets mad and starts planning a revolution. With a band  of orangutans, chimps, and gorillas, he clashes with the human army and  gives a stirring speech. It's the shortest film in the series, but it's  lead-footed and erratic, with the climactic skirmish shot way too close in.  Typical piece of hackwork from J. Lee Thompson, who also directed the next  and last one. It's the only PG-rated ""Apes"" movie (the rest were  G), probably because of increased violence and lots of electroshock  torture.
BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES - An okay finale. It opens in  2678, with John Huston as the Lawgiver, a wise old orangutan who teaches  his class about Caesar (Roddy McDowall). The rest of the movie is set in  about 2015 and involves Caesar's problems with the barbarous gorilla  General Aldo (Claude Akins) and a band of mutants from the Forbidden Zone.  The film brings the ""Apes"" saga almost full circle, with the  humans in Ape City reduced to slaves (who can still speak, having not been  lobotomized yet). The battle scenes are staged better than in  ""Conquest,"" and there's a lot of action and the usual political  parallels (at one point Caesar says ""Let us reason together,""  just like LBJ). Also with Lew Ayres, Paul Williams, Austin Stoker  (""Assault on Precinct 13""), and John Landis as a human slave.  Landis got to know ""Apes"" make-up designer John Chambers, who  later appeared in Landis' directing debut ""Schlock.""
The irony  of the ""Apes"" series is that it preaches non-bigotry, but it's  still racist on some level. The warlike, bestial gorillas are dark-skinned;  the more intelligent and peaceful orangutans and chimpanzees are  light-skinned. Fox may have been able to get away with that in the early  '70s, but if they want to revive the franchise today they'd better rethink  the color-coding a little.",964656000,79,5381,4.998870056497175
970395,5,6305076154,"At last, The Planet of the Apes saga can be seen as it should always have been--in a new digital master.  I've been waiting for the series to be released on DVD ever since DVDs first came out, as it is one of my all-time  favorites, and finally the time has come.  I only hope, now, that the  ""Planet of the Apes"" television series is served the same justice  some time in the near future, joining the ranks of such heavyweights as  ""Star Trek:  The Original Series"" and ""The Twilight Zone:  The Collection.""",960768000,7,508,4.387096774193548
970396,5,6305076154,thank god the apes are now on DVD.  I thought it would take much longer because I thorught they would be stubborn about it and subject me to the poor quality of VHS.

970397,4,6305076154,The first film deserves a full five stars but I'm giving the series four because the sequels should get three (the last four are very entertaining but flawed in many aspects).  But it is still very intriguing to see how the writers went from one movie to the next from scratch and made a  perfectly wound story! Sci-fi fans shouldn't miss this incredible series!
