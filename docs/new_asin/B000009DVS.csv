7905385,5,B000009DVS,"What a great series. Excellent transfer to DVD.
The original fancy schmancy (the technical term :->) packaging - when DVDs first came out - breaks as you open and close the 'book.'
We were VERY happy to find this new packaging and RE-PURCHASED Season 1. (Thankfully, we hadn't gotten any further than that on the first go around.)
If we're understanding correctly, this packaging may be going away. I'd say buy the whole series now.
That's what we did, but we purchase each season separately.",1526428800,,492,4.8

7905387,4,B000009DVS,"One of the best seasons, 1 or 2 sub par episodes, but the show really came in to its own in the the 4th  season and the writing really improved.",1491436800,,144,3.8
7905388,3,B000009DVS,"I never saw the original, but this sequel is extremely fun.  The campy acting and shinanigans just add to the laughs!  The plot's pretty weak and very unbelievable, but Hui as King Kong is charismatic and pretty humorous.  The two robot battle scenes are my favorites.  The car and motorbike chase sequences are very well coregraphed.  Not sure it's worth buying -- but definitely something to rent for a lot of laughs!",988156800,,419,4.763888888888889
