8324846,5,B0002TTSZC,"This is a serious film for adults, and is a subtle departure from the classic anime style. No school girls with squeaky voices doing action hero stunts or tiresome comedy relief. If you want battling robots, explosions and low-brow action, look elsewhere. Definitely thinking-man's anime. Quite a bit of dialog and exposition. Short attention spans need not apply. Complicated storyline with international political plot twists and amazing high-tech concepts. Can be difficult to follow. However, if you pay attention and listen carefully(and not just look at the pretty pictures)it will pay off in a huge way and is immensely gratifying. Leaves you wanting more; check out ""Ghost in the Shell 2"" and the two complete television seasons on DVD for more intelligent, well-written, no-goofiness anime. Classic stuff!",1164585600,6,814,5.417322834645669
