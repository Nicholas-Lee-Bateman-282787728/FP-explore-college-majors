Roy asks for more time, a few weeks. One lady has lost her suitcase. Roy finds the contents scattered along the road, then owner Candy shows up and complains. A masked man rides up to rob Roy; he wants that photograph. The local hotels are all full. The Constable puts up Roy and tells about his past. ""The Gypsy"" is wanted for questioning, a $10,000 reward for the man who robs oil companies. There is a song for entertainment, and some comedy. Show Business isn't paying well. A private conversation reveals a hidden secret.

There is a conflict between two women, then two men, to add drama. At the camp somebody shoots at Rico. Will Lolita take Candy away? Was that a double who jumped on the horse? Will Roy collect that reward? Will a song help Rico? Some of the crew show up to capture Rico. Did somebody shoot at Rico so he couldn't defend himself against the charges? Then another song for entertainment. [Did they call them ""horse operas""?] Who were those masked men who helped Rico escape from jail? What are the secret plans for Blaisdell's men? Does Rico have a plan to counter them? Will Roy ride to the rescue? Can Gordito fit through that coach window? [Those stunt men on the horses earned their pay.] At the end justice triumphs, the guilty are caught. So its time for another song!

Back in the 1940s these and similar western were very popular with audiences. Decades later you can see them as low-budget entertainments that skip over realities. This ""Viking Video Classics"" tape suffers from low-contrast pictures.",1221609600,,1689,4.607973421926911
