8164463,5,B000LV6VX8,"An amazing Alfisti feast for the eyes and ears. The narrator, Alain de Cadenet, has much knowledge of Alfa Romeo's racing machines. He interestingly discusses each car's chassis design, engine spec and body-shell material.  In addition, he ""races"" around many fabulously well preserved Alfa Romeos, several from the Marque's famous museum in Milan. The growling, wailing engines are sweet music. If you love Alfa Romeo, this is well worth watching.",1298419200,4,448,5.4
8164464,5,B000LV6VX8,This is an awe inspiring look at the best of the best Alfas. So enjoyable you could watch it over and over. The only flaw is the round and round video views. A little more creative use of movement on the cameraman's part would have helped.  Not a reason though to not see this great footage on the Best Alfas.,1295049600,3,309,4.15
