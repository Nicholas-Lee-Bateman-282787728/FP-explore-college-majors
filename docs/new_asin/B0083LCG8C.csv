There is a wrestling match between two men. Tom Storm wins. His brother Billy rides to town; he meets Connie Curlew. The Storms own Lost River Basin, thousands of acres of worthless lands. Tom enters the bank to renew the loan and pay the interest. Stanton is selling land to homesteaders by promising water in the near future. The bank is held up! One robber is shot dead. He was a former employee of Storm. Tom visits lawyer Steve Barick, who tells him someone is after his ranch, and he should pack a gun now. Bill brought back supplies and a new shirt for Tom. A man arrives, he is shot in the back! The next day the Sheriff arrives to ask questions. Tom asks Billy questions, the latter rides away. Tom follows. He meets the Curlew father, who is a blacksmith. The bank won't renew the loan. The bad guys plan to meet Tom before he can talk to the Sheriff. The leader of the bad guys calls for an inquest over the shooting in the Sheriffs office.

Tom will ask the other ranchers to appear at the inquest. Billy lost money playing poker with Stanton. Billy tells about Max Durante, the cattle rustler. Stanton is using Billy to get Tom. Billy goes to meet Stantons gang and tells them he will turn them over to the Sheriff. There is shooting. Stanton advises Durante to steal Toms herd so Tom cant pay off the loan. Billy warns Tom about this. They shoot at the rustlers. One shoots Billy with his rifle. But Storms herd was saved. Later one of the villains shoots Curlew while he is prospecting. The same kind of bullet that killed Chives and Billy. Curlew will survive, he found gold on Storms waste land. Durante tells Stanton what happened. They are ordered to stampede Storms herd so he cant pay back his loan and lose his ranch (with the part that has gold). Storm orders the herd moved before daylight.

Stantons henchmen attack Tom by the chuck wagon. The cook is shot. The herd of Hereford cattle is run off. Without Billys testimony it will be hard to convict Stanton, says the Sheriff. They will send a search party to find Tom. Durante found Tom and brought him to the gangs hideout as a captive. Stanton presents $100,000 to the banks president as a deposit. There is an auction for the Circle S ranch. Stanton is caught, his moneys serial number matched the stolen cash! Durante will go to town with the gang to get his money. Can Tom escape? He has a plan and it works. In town Durante frees Stanton from the jail to get his money from the bank. Stanton tries his last trick! Tom captures Durante and hands him over to the Sheriff. Then he visits the Curlew home for a happy ending.

This is a complex story about an attempt to swindle a ranch owners property because it not only has gold on its land but will allow homesteaders to settle as they will have water for crops. Crops are a renewable resource, unlike a mineral which cannot be renewed. I suspect scenes were edited to reduce its running time.",1507852800,,2950,4.427255985267035
