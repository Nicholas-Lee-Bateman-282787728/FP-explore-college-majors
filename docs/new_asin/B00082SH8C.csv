8055375,5,B00082SH8C,"If you are into U.S. History, this short film is an excellent ""time capsule"" about gold mining in the 1940s in South Dakota, produced by the Homestake Mining Company. I never imagined how much manpower and machinery was required to get so little out of so much. Mined rock is collected into an underground railroad that pulls small hopper cars, which carry one ton of rock per car. The result is roughly ten grams of gold per ton of processed rock. Amazing. There are some frightening added compounds used in processing. Huge amounts of ""quicksilver"" (mercury) and vast quantities of liquid cyanide were used daily in the processing plant. This period reel is mostly pro-mining propaganda from the early WWII period, but it is exceptional.",1488326400,,739,4.92

What you get is a documentary about how gold is harvested from mines in South Dakota and how this sustains the state's economy. It's fascinating to learn about and something that I had never even considered before.",1153440000,,382,4.536231884057971
