4484443,5,B004VSZDNQ,"Some of the best meditations I've ever seen, the Qi (Pronounced Chi) generated from these meditations is greater than any I've felt before. I would say that Shifu Mike is a very accomplished teacher in these things and I would highly recommend that anyone with an interest in meditation or Qigong give these a try. This is one of the most powerful Taoist Qigong styles there is and it would be a grave mistake to think that these meditations have no power because of their simplicity. There is an old saying ""The greatest ways are the simplest ones."" To any who haven't already I say - BUY this DVD right NOW! If you love meditation you'll never regret it.",1309132800,8,656,4.5210084033613445
4484444,5,B004VSZDNQ,"The cover says, ""Don't be deceived by the simplicity of these exercises."" I was skeptical at first, but after practicing the exercises on this DVD for a few days, I felt a HUGE shift in my energy. I have been practicing qigong and internal martial arts for some time. The exercises in this DVD have the authentic energetic signature of an esoteric temple style of qigong. These exercises have helped my Tai Chi practice and significantly deepened my meditations. If you are a serious student of qigong and neigong or are a newbie to energy work, I recommend you check out this DVD.",1303430400,9,581,4.650485436893204

8444012,5,B004VSZDNQ,"Such a powerfully grounding experience doing these simple, short movements and poses.

I have little experience in this energy art form but this creates so much inner healing and peace.

Most people are yang deficient. This being so grounding, it seems to bring an enormous amount of yang energy into your body. I feel more confident, more secure, more happy, more excited for the future. It increases your personal power.

I absolutely love it. I know it will be a vital part of the continual healing of my body brought on by stress and a weakened immune system.

I'm really just amazed at how powerful and life-giving this is.

Originally, I saw the reviews and thought that maybe they weren't completely genuine, but I was completely wrong. This is the real deal. Sifu Mike is the real deal.",1501545600,2,794,4.72463768115942

8444015,5,B004VSZDNQ,"This is the real deal, just like the other comments say. I don't leave many Amazon reviews (you can click and see) but when I do, it is typically an exceptional product like this one. I highly recommend this for taking your practice to the next level!",1392940800,5,251,4.361702127659575
8444016,5,B004VSZDNQ,Michael Denney has developed a Qi Gong/ Nei Gong that is truly transcendent. Simple moves and postures take you on a journey of self discovery and self healing,1385251200,5,159,4.714285714285714
8444017,5,B004VSZDNQ,"I have been into martial arts for many years now and this DVD brings to any practitioner a higher level of Chi development quicker than what is taught by any instructor at a local dojo. This should be used in conjunction with Jerry Johnson's and Lee Holden's videos, but it is definitely worth the money. Like anything else it requires practice, patience and time, but you will feel the Chi in the first practice.  I think it is of extraordinary value and I will be buying level two shortly.",1381017600,2,491,4.51685393258427
8444018,5,B004VSZDNQ,Generates shockingly intense energy very fast - excellent instruction - no fluff - no hype. The program is everything it is advertised as being and much more. Surpasses other qigong styles by light years. Worth a ten-star review.,1362614400,8,229,5.052631578947368
