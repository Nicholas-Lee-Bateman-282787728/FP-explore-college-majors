7596265,5,B01A9R6C1O,"This movie is great... Nothing else to say, really. Whether the comic book was this good or not they rocked on this movie. A lot of people will relate with the characters as I did which isn't always common in this type of movie. For the people who are complaining about the language and adult content you need to remember that most of the Marvel and comic based movies are not geared toward children. They are trying to reach an audience of adults who grew up reading comic books. Remember that and you will enjoy this movie thoroughly!",1417910400,,536,4.479591836734694

7596267,5,B01A9R6C1O,"There have been many fantasy films that were lacking in emotionality and could not hold my attention throughout the film.  Guardians of the Galaxy is such a gem compared to most films, that it really feels special and beautiful.  If you want action, you got it.  If you want comedy, you got it.  If you want romance, heck, you got it.  If you want to experience a great story that moves the heart and that stands on its own, you got it right here.  One of the best films of the past 15 years.  Just don't forget to call him ""Star Lord.""",1410480000,2,536,4.196078431372549

This is a great movie, action, fun, more action, more fun, great effects.  Could be another great Marvel franchise.  Marvel has managed to take a lot of comic book superheros and turn them into mega movie stars with great direction, casting, costumes and period accuracy.  This movie is no exception.

7596391,5,B01A9R6C1O,"First of all, I am really not a person who goes for this certain superhero-type genre. In fact, my husband had to cajole me to go to a big screen theater to see this one and did I ever Love this action filled fun story filled with the actors and two exclusive character's voices of Bradley Cooper and his sidekick Vin Diesel. Beginning with a dancing Chris Pratt (Star Lord) to an electric and eclectic soundtrack overflowing with earlier generations of music. This has love stories in several ways besides the central theme too, a sarcasm that is done perfectly which I am a fan of in the humor and massive CGI filling the big screen which I usually don't care as much about as the acting. See this on a large screen - if possible - with great sound. On the other-hand, this film was a spectacle; a feast for your eyes and your ears and definitely a great time. Before anyone like me who usually goes for drama or romantic comedies shuns this space romp, give this a look as I think you will not be disappointed. I even bought the Rocket 'action figure' for a Christmas gift following the film. It was such fun at the movie theater that I purchased the Blu-ray for my enthused husband and, let's face it, me too! Sounds and looks great on our large screen and surround sound stereo. I will be getting the second volume of this when it is released too. I suggest, though, to see this first. A wonder on screen and a great date night to my happy surprise...",1500076800,17,1456,4.356617647058823

7596444,4,B01A9R6C1O,"When I very first saw this movie, I thought it was just okay, but over the last three years, it has definitely grown on me. It's like a fun actiony funny cheesy 80's made in modern times. It has a great 1980's soundtrack. You come to care for all the characters like Peter Quill who was abducted from Earth as a young boy after his mom dies. Gamora, a beautiful (and green) assassin that works reluctantly for Thanos. Rocket and Groot, a genetically engineered raccoon-like bounty hunter and a tree-like humanoid. Finally, we meet Drax, a strong muscular warrior who seeks revenge against Ronan and Thanos for the death of his family. Together, this rag-tag group of misfits try to come together and stop Ronan from getting his hands on a powerful Orb and destroying the galaxy.

I never thought I would shed tears for a tree that can only say one phrase, but here I am doing just that. Bradly Cooper gives Rocket such personality it's hard not to relate him to an actual person, and the relationship between Cooper's character and Diesel's is endearing and heartwarming. Zoe Saldana does an excellent job of making her plot line revolve around her characters desire to be out from under her ""father's"" thumb and the desire to do what is inherently good and moral.

Lo and behold, I have collected most of the Marvel character movies but THIS one, by far, is my favorite and absolutely entertaining. The lure is the music  - dated 80's music I remember fondly myself, and the acting; by a lovable cast of characters who embrace and run with their roles, including the voice of Bradley Cooper as a ""science gone wrong"", feisty, gun-weilding raccoon, with his soft spirited friend, a tree, named Groot. The dialogue is engaging and the humor is stellar!
My husband and I immediately watched it twice in one evening, then again and again, since! We sing the songs when we aren't watching the movie. We cannot wait to see the theater follow up, Guardians of the Galaxy 2 (coming out May 5)! Our movie night (on my husband's birthday no less) is already planned.

7596478,3,B01A9R6C1O,"Actually I saw this on TV I admit I'm a science fiction nut  there needs to be something addressed. Guardians of the Galaxy is a campy and a little-over-the-top romp through a menagerie of creatures, situations, and fun. It opens with a gut-wrenching scene in a hospital and quickly takes you to the near future with the main character foraging for an orb, a very dangerous orb. The action quickly develops, as do the plot twists and the introduction of the other heroic characters who eventually unite to form a mismatched group consisting of a tree, a couple of aliens, a modified raccoon, and one human. But, somehow they congeal into a promising band of ""do-gooders."" Well, not exactly do-gooders, but they end up doing the right thing. Of course, they're kind of forced into banding together when Ronan, the resident bad guy, inflicts major havoc to get the orb. With spaceship chases, fights, weapons, and explosions, the whole thing is entirely enjoyable.
The special effects were fantastic. The acting was great. I even found myself chuckling several times at some of the humor that was cleverly woven into the script. All I can say is that Marvel has done it again.
However, I am concerned about something. Isaiah 5:20 says...
Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil;
Who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness;
Who substitute bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!
NowI know it's a comic book movie, but even the subtleties of humor and comic books can be used to contradict the word of God. As the Scripture above says, ""Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil."" I noticed in this movie, and other movies, a frequent theme where the outlaws, the killers, the liars, and the thieves become the heroes. I am not trying to be legalistic, but if I were writing a movie like that, being the Christian that I am, I could not in all good conscience make evildoers out to be the heroes. I'll leave it to you to judge whether or not my comments are appropriate or not.
Nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie.

Lessons
One of the oldest lessons in the Bible can be seen in the way both Isaac and Jacob created problems by showing favoritism. Thanos, in the presence of both daughters Nebula and Gamora refers to the latter as his favorite. It is no wonder that Nebula hates her so. The Word of God expounds on the natural reaction to this and condemns its use as well.
Now Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons, because he had been born to him in his old age and he made a richly ornamented robe for him. When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him. Genesis 37:3-7
My brothers, as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, don't show favoritism. James 2:1
Ronin admits early on, They call me terrorist, radical, zealot because I obey the ancient laws of my people, the Kree, and punish those who do not. He sees himself as a deliverer of justice, as many do today, but his corrupt nature, as evidenced by his love of death, clouds his vision, as it will for all evil men, just as Solomon said,
Evil men do not understand justice. Proverbs 28:5
Drax has the singular focus of seeking revenge on Ronin for having killed his wife and daughter. His loss was great, but we understand the God of the Old and New Testament has always spoken with the same voice.
Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against one of your people but love your neighbor as yourself. I am the Lord. Leviticus 19:18
Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for Gods wrath, for it is written: It is mine to avenge; I will repay,  says the Lord. Romans 12:19
Gamora, a cold hearted, trained assassin since childhood when she herself was abducted, at a pivotal moment declares,  I have lived most of my life surrounded by my enemies. I would be grateful to die among my friends. She, just as the others, give proof of the kind of self-sacrifice that is rare but is to be treasured when found.
A man of many companions may come to ruin, but there is a friend that sticks closer than a brother. Proverbs 18:24
Along those same lines there are two great moments in the film, instances of a willingness to give up your life for others that are both profound and moving in their own way and should remind us of Jesus own words when he said, as a foreshadowing of his coming death
Greater love has no one than this: to lay down ones life for ones friends. John 15:13",1488240000,,4463,4.458996328029376

I will watch this over and over until I can't watch it any more. The only thing that I didn't like was the price. I couldn't find a reasonably priced copy anywhere.

7596539,5,B01A9R6C1O,"This fantastic movie has adventure, humor and surprisingly touching, heart melting moments. It makes my eyes water and makes me laugh. If a film can do that, I am usually a fan. My entire family loves it. My 14 year old begged me for it. There are some moments that are a bit inappropriate for my younger kids, but I'm the kind of parent who sits down to explain things, and if the content is good and it's a classic, I sometimes let certain things slide. I'm usually pretty picky with what I do let slide as many PG-13 movies are terribly inappropriate and even should be rated R, but this wasn't as bad as some and fit the bill for content, so I was okay with them watching it. Two out of three kids were Guardians of the Galaxy characters for Halloween and my husband was Groot. If you haven't seen this, just try it on. It's gonna be a classic.",1478649600,,848,4.2407407407407405

What I don't like is that the latest Marvel movies don't come with Ultraviolet versions.  If they come with digital copies at all you have to have them on the Disney Anywhere server.  I don't need yet another digital account to access my digital versions.  A real drag.  I could buy an Amazon digital version but that just drives the cost of the movie up beyond my budget.  Disney is just too greedy for me.

I'm giving the movie itself 5 stars, but this disc had some issues we weren't expecting in regards to audio.  Considering I've seen the movie before, I already knew what was happening, but this didn't help the fact that my parents had a hard time hearing it & therefore, following the storyline...",1427328000,,594,4.440366972477064

My only complaint about this version is the price.  Over $20 for the 1-Disc version?  And the only way you could get a digital copy with a physical purchase was by buying the 3D Blu-ray combo pack.  I can't see movies in 3D, so that is completely useless to me, and I don't feel like buying the digital version for almost the same price as the physical copy.  I wish they would have released a combo pack with just the regular Blu-ray and digital copy combo pack.  For that I understand spending $25.",1425513600,,658,4.3884297520661155

7596774,5,B01A9R6C1O,"""Guardians Of The Galaxy"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Brash adventurer Peter Quill finds himself the object of an unrelenting bounty hunt after stealing a mysterious orb coveted by Ronan, a powerful villain with ambitions that threaten the entire universe. To evade the ever-persistent Ronan, Quill is forced into an uneasy truce with a quartet of disparate misfits -- Rocket, a gun-toting raccoon, Groot, a tree-like humanoid, the deadly and enigmatic Gamora and the revenge-driven Drax the Destroyer. But when Quill discovers the true power of the orb and the menace it poses to the cosmos, he must do his best to rally his ragtag rivals for a last, desperate stand -- with the galaxy's fate in the balance.

The cast led by Chris Pratt (in a funny star-making performance as Peter Quill), Zoe Saldana (as Gamora), Dave Bautista (as Drax), Vin Diesel (as the voice of Groot) & Bradley Cooper (as the voice of Rocket) is excellent. The directing by James Gunn is excellent. The story & screenplay (based on the comic book by Dan Abnett & Andy Lanning) by Gunn & Nicole Perlman is excellent.

The music by Tyler Bates is excellent. The cinematography by Ben Davis is excellent. The film editing by Fred Raskin, Hughes Winborne & Craig Wood is excellent. The casting by Sarah Halley Finn is excellent. The production design by Charles Wood is excellent. The art direction by Ravi Bansal, Ray Chan, Jordan Crockett, Romek Delmata, Alan Payne, Phil Sims, Mike Stallion & Mark Swain is excellent. The set decoration by Richard Roberts, set dressings by Adam Kedis, Mark Papworth & Brenden Salmon & set designs by Matthew Robinson is excellent. The costume design by Alexandra Byrne is excellent. The make-up supervised by Karen Cohen & special make-up effects coordinated by Fawn Muller & designed by David White is excellent. The stunts coordinated by Steve Dent is excellent. The special effects supervised by Paul Corbould are excellent. The visual effects supervised by Nicolas Aithadi, Stephane Ceretti, Vincent Cirelli, Trent Claus, Matthew Crnich, Jonathan Fawkner, James D. Fleming, Florian Gellinger, Kyle McCullough, Stephane Naze, Katherine Rodtsbrooks, Greg Steele, Olcun Tan & Peter G. Travers, coordinated by Szilvia Aszmann, Ashley Bellm, Siobhan Bentley, Lara Berners, Zaira Brilhante, Andy Burrow, Carlos Ciudad, Rachel Hannah Cohen, Mike Coughlin, Jake Delaney, Nicole Duncan, Richard Dyson, Monika Gosch, Kat Greene, Tiffany Griffin, Deeps Hargunani, Louise Hastings, Umar Hussain, Zafaar Janjua, Rory Jones, Sian Judge, James Ledwell, Lara Lom, Alejandra Viejo Lopez De Roda, Tushar Manolkar, David Masure-Bosco, Abigail Mendoza, Lauren Miyake, Jennifer Mizener, Dennis Murillo, Eve Thomas, Nick Thompson, Victoria Tracconi, Tsvetomira Valcheva, Jeff Winkle, Megan Wong, Nicolas Nepveu, Meghan O'Brien, Carine Ong, Agnes Rama, Alex Reinach, Samantha Rocca & Alvin Roxas are excellent.

This is an excellent, fun (also funny), entertaining, sci-fi/action/adventure that is interesting and intriguing. It is also well-done and well-crafted, thematically and visually. Chris Pratt gives a funny and entertaining performance as Peter Quill and leads an excellent cast. James Gunn has directed his most interesting film to date, thus far. This is (or was) one of the best films of the summer season and one of the best comic books of the year and of recent memory, as well, too.",1418169600,,3403,5.321561338289963
