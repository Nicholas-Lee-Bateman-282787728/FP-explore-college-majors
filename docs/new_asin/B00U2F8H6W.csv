7027451,5,B00U2F8H6W,Awesome review great acting good drama at tidbit of historical events. The show is Nonstop Action / drama. I give it 10 Stars-1 because there is no second season. If they can't make a second season can they make something similar. awesome awesome awesome movie well worth watching!!!!!,1527292800,2,285,4.958333333333333

7027453,1,B00U2F8H6W,"This is the BBC equivalent of a soap opera. That's not inherently bad, but viewers should be informed up front so those not interested in soap operas do not waste time waiting for the trivial to become important, or for the overwritten and predictable guard / prisoner interactions to have meaning beyond exposing each character's one-dimensional role in the story.",1526774400,2,365,5.1

7027455,4,B00U2F8H6W,"Banished is a wonderful series about a group of British convicts sent from England to the penal colony of New South Wales (Australia). As the DVD's cover suggests, the program primarily follows three convicts: Elizabeth Quinn (played by MyAnna Buring), Tommy Barrett (played by Julian Rhind-Tutt), and James Freeman (played by Russell Tovey).  Barrett and Freeman are best friends, and Elizabeth is desperately in love with Barrett.  Barrett and Elizabeth's desire to be together sets the show's first dilemma in motion; on the penal colony, convict women are only allowed to fraternize with the soldiers and are prohibited from being with a convict man unless the man is her husband.  The two go to great lengths to be together, always seeming to risk their physical safety in the process.  The other major catalyst conflict is that the colony blacksmith, Marston (played by Game of Thrones' Rory McCann), steals all of Freeman's food without consequence because he's 1) terrifyingly intimidating and 2) the blacksmith, a vital position to the colony's survival. The consequences that flow from the character's attempts to deal with these two issues drives the series from episode 1-7.

Rhind-Tutt's character Tommy Barrett is introduced to the audience as a pillar of strength and integrity to his community, both the convicts and the free people.  The actor does a great job of playing Barrett, but his character gets annoying at points. What the show presents as integrity seems more like selfishness and bullheadedness as the program continues. The true stars of the program are Tovey and Buring who continuously convey the anguish of living in a system that seems constructed to hurt them.  The supporting cast were also fantastic. Notably, Joseph Millson as the cold Major Ross, Ryan Corr as the romantic Corporal MacDonald, and David Wenham as the just (only in theory) Governor.

I only gave this program 4 stars because I don't think it did a good enough job at explaining the love triangle of Major Ross, Katherine McVitty, and Corporal MacDonald.  The short passage of time and the limited character development did not seem sufficient to warrant the ultimate decisions made by the characters, at least with respect to McVitty and MacDonald. Perhaps a second season of the series would have helped the audience to understand their ultimate choices, but I was left perplexed by their behavior.

All in all, I would suggest this series.  Buring and Tovey delivered amazing performances that should not be missed. I'm very sorry that there will not be a second season.",1454803200,8,2577,5.097387173396674
7027456,4,B00U2F8H6W,"Good  series. I'm disappointed they  cancelled  it.  Acting is top notch as is production. I will  admit  to  being swayed  by  Russell Tovey, at least for an extra star. There were plot elements that were a bit contrived.  It seems the entire seven episodes were woven to produce  the rock and hard place end. Can so  many  characters and circumstances conspire against one character?

Of course, ending with the first season leaves the finale feeling pretty darn wanting.

Beware it is a Region 2  DVD so won't play  on standard US DVD players.  Do yourself a favor and get a multiregional Blu Ray player.  They're  not  that  expensive and there  is good stuff coming from across the pond. Why more British stuff isn't  released in the US is a mystery.",1454716800,16,755,4.630769230769231
7027457,3,B00U2F8H6W,Great initial start and great potential for plot/character stories.  Then it got SUPER repetitive and overblown on one single plot point.  Bad writing? Lack of funding?

Love the characters and the actors  - its so well written and you can't wait to see what the next episode brings. I binged on it and am so sorry to finish my last episode. Can't believe they won't be filming another season. Please BBC - give this series another season. Read all the reviews...people love it! If you're a fan, make you voice heard.

7027459,3,B00U2F8H6W,"Most fans of period drama would probably enjoy this.  Many of the characters were complex and imperfect in intriguing ways.

7027461,5,B00U2F8H6W,"One of the best productions I've ever seen, and I'm very picky about fiction. The characters are complex, well written. The story keeps us guessing, and our emotions changing, throughout.

Production values are also very good. I cannot find fault in this series. The finale may have been a bit melodramatic at times, but a lot was packed into one episode. Other than that, I'd rate this series as perfect. So who canceled it?!

I googled the series, because the writing was so subtle I felt these must be historical characters. Most are fictional but still feel like they were real. That's when I found out it was canceled after its first season. I also saw vicious reviews. Who had an agenda against this series?

I'm glad it's free for Amazon Prime members because it won't cost anyone in Prime a cent to check it out. I hope everyone will. Maybe Amazon can fund Season Two? It is difficult to find quality video entertainment. I am often disappointed at seeing the puppet strings in writing or paper flat characterization. Not here: the writing, directing and acting are all excellent.

This series was GOOD. What happened?!",1532563200,,1127,4.764102564102564
7027462,5,B00U2F8H6W,"Excellent series. The acting is great and so is the plot which in many respects is based on historical facts rather than fiction - early settlers forced to immigrate because they were found to have committed a crime in their homeland.

7027464,4,B00U2F8H6W,"Dismissed by the English ruling class as hopelessly unreformable, and taking up too much prison space, individuals often guilty of minor offenses, were shipped off to a penal colony in New South Wales.  Often poor, uneducated folks: one who stole food for his starving family, a prostitute, a pickpocket, a young woman accused of theft by a wealthy predatory employer, these are the kind of characters who populate the series and likely the original penal colony.  Many died on the ships that transported them.  Guarded by British marines, one the colony governor, the convicts are subjected to near starvation, floggings, having to share their women with officers, and occasional hangings. Youll witness love stories, partners challenged and threatened by commandeered sex with their overseers, other forced betrayals, some rivalries, some evidence of compassion by the rulers in the teaching of literacy.  But mostly youll notice a lot of strength, endurance, and loyalty among the folks who make up the prison population. This is, of course, a dramatic representation of that swath of history.  What is largely absent is the abhorrent effect of British colonization on the indigenous population.  The production is skillful, all filmmaking disciplines impressive, the acting first-rate.  A couple of episodes are a little slow, midway, but pick up steam again in short order.  I recommend the series for its good drama and the added benefit of some historical clarity.",1532217600,,1471,5.310344827586207

The will of God is beyond our nearsightedness.  I have never seen a film from the BBC that I thought was well rounded before. This one season speaks volumes. ...... P.S.

7027478,2,B00U2F8H6W,It might be an interesting series.  I could not watch it due to the crappy (unimaginative and repetitive) unrelenting music.  Why do movie makers think they have to do this?

7027479,3,B00U2F8H6W,"I love period dramas, and I thought the the premise of the series, the start of the New South Wales penal colony towards the end of the eighteenth century would certainly be of interest. Shot on location in Australia, the series had excellent production values. The sets and costumes gave it an air of period authenticity. The acting was excellent. The convicts, men and women were suitably grubby.. So, what was the problem?

The scripts were simply sub-par. Melodramatic, with overlays of twenty first century social and sexual mores that effectively kill any authenticity of time and place, the writing is what finished off any chance of a second season. Not even the excellent acting could validate the almost ridiculous plotlines. Still, I derived some enjoyment from this series, if only because cause I have a soft spot for period dramas.",1530576000,,845,4.99290780141844

7027488,4,B00U2F8H6W,"In spite of its flaws, ""Banished"" is a superbly acted and fairly well-written limited series. Its flaws--the complete absence of Indigenous Australians, the lack sufficient development of the primary protagonist's character for understanding why he garners universal love and respect from both soldiers and convicts--leaves this viewer wanting much more. It is, however, unfortunate that it was not renewed for a second season, which would have provided fertile ground for fleshing out Tommy's backstory and embracing the far-too-important-to-ignore tale of how the colonists and Indigenous Australians actually interacted.",1529884800,,623,6.090909090909091

7027493,4,B00U2F8H6W,"... of the first penal colony in Australia is different, but the situations and scenarios are very likely since human nature is no different now than it was then.  To the point, there was no governor in NSW at the time.  He didn't arrive there for many years.  There was no major commanding the Royal Marines.  A Royal Navy captain set up the colony.  But as in the series, the marines were all volunteers and the ratio of soldiers to convicts is not that far off and some marines were particularly sadistic.  The floggings, hunger, chain gangs and other difficulties noted in the series were fact based as well, however, hangings were rare.
The characters, especially the main 3 are fleshed out quickly, and there is little development past that, one spending most of his time crying, and the other 2 spending their time sacrificing some part of themselves for the other, the major takes particular advantage of his position, and the reverend takes it upon himself to speak for everyone's god in all matters moral or anything else.  Some of the characters could have added some depth to the series by being further developed and other things could have been less focused upon.  Entirely too much film was dedicated to some, and not enough to others, however the directing, capability of the actors, the very well done backlighting at night, the particularly well shot studio scenes and excellent editing carried me all the way through the series.  In fact, I'd watch another season of Banished if some other production company picked it up.  All the aforementioned considered, the series is watchable, the leads need some depth and range, and a little more attention to historical detail would put the icing on for me, but then, I have a predilection for things Australian anyway.",1529452800,,1781,4.828947368421052

Perhaps  I would have written some parts with a little different ending i.e. when a convict left the colony and ran for his life in the bush, perhaps having him branch out with the start of another colony much further away and returning for his friends and others to populate it, and some interaction with the natives on a positive note would be nice. But as it is and as far as it goes, I find it well worth my time to watch it.",1529452800,,586,4.232142857142857
7027495,4,B00U2F8H6W,"This mini-series is set in Australia in 1780s in one of the first British penal colonies. How to rate this mini-series? Depends on what you are looking for. The only things *historical* in this are most of the clothing and some of the names. Thats about it. Everything else is a soap opera fiction novel. It was well-acted, in my opinion, and this maintained my interest. The storylines became interesting, although some subplots were so contrived they could induce occasional eye-rolling and a sigh. And, frankly, this mini-series is not a historical period piece; it is definitely genre fiction. Do not use this to inform your understanding of gender in the late 18th century. Do not use this mini-series to inform your understanding of the British colonization of eastern Australia. But read on, because this mini-series is worth watching for the character studies of why the characters did what they did within their own context as genre fiction.

Ratings
History: 1 out of 5 stars (well, 0 out of 5, actually).
Entertainment: 4 out of 5 stars, if you are looking for a new soap opera melodrama that encourages the viewer to ask some questions about human character.

If you are looking for learning more about the history of the British colonization of eastern Australia, then this is not what you are looking for. Find a documentary, or book, instead. If you are looking for very good acting in a soap opera, then this has some great stuff to offer.

There are some character studies that could be done on many of the main characters in this mini-series. This mini-series raises questions about why people do what they do when duty and friendship are intertwined? when does lust and love intertwine? what is the role of faith vis-a-vis religion? What is the tipping point between being forced, being duplicitous, and free will? How far can loyalty go? etc. Am I giving too much credit to this series for raising these questions? No, because I thought about these questions while watching this: the characters themselves seemed to face these questions at times in various ways. Thats a result of really good writing and convincing and immersive acting, to get the audience to think about the ""bigger questions"" while following these characters from scene to scene. To avoid spoilers, I will be vague, but this mini-series can be tough to stop watching once you realize that you want to see what decisions Freeman makes next or how Elizabeth Quinn and Tommy Barrett grow in their relationship (especially in relation to Freeman), and to my favorite subplot: Corporal MacDonalds situation. I think MacDonald was a tragic figure. Yes, many of the other ""main"" characters situations were tragic, but MacDonalds situation as a proud young marine was largely unsung, yet fascinating for his apparent steadfastness to Katherine and his commanding officer Major Ross, so far as the viewer can know. The way Ross methodically dismantled the loyal MacDonald episode by episode...ugh, makes anyone angry who views MacDonald as a protagonist worth rooting for. MacDonald was definitely a character who earned respect to be rooted for, in my opinion. Despite all that Ross threw at him, MacDonald remained steadfast as a loyal marine and loyal to Katherine such as offering to give up his promotion to protect Katherine, looking after her well-being each day etc...but then Katherine's decision. I was so disappointed with Katherine (Kitty) McVities decision in the end. I was surprised that she made the decision she did. MacDonald was a tragic figure who tried to do the right thing always in loyalty to Katherine, and then what led to his ultimate moment of despair. Some may label him simply a romantic, and I think he was more than that because he had a gritty determined authenticity that would have made for a potentially ""happy"" ending for their storyline had Katherine made a different choice. Maybe you will have a different opinion. And that is sort of what makes this series work as an effective soap opera: Viewers will likely have some strong opinions on one side or the other in how we perceive many of the characters. Most of the subplots have tragic endings. Sadness outweighs happiness in this mini-series (that's not a criticism, it's an observation that the writers did not fall into the saccharine trap of a cliche ending).

Most of the characters were not caricatures. Even Major Ross was nuanced with some compassion here and there; he was in a very difficult leadership position, so he had to maintain order and make difficult decisions to do so. This was all around very well written and very well acted.",1529366400,4,4621,4.92811296534018

Although I'd to like watch more to learn how the colony evolves, they did bring the single-season finale to a plausible stopping point, hence viewers should not feel frustrated from that permanent cliffhanger effect we might experience with some short-lived TV series.",1528675200,5,523,5.190476190476191

Two alumni of Ripper Street (Fred and Long Susan) as well as Mr. Hickey of The Terror are stars of this well written and acted program.",1528675200,,238,4.666666666666667
7027505,4,B00U2F8H6W,"Excellent series on the beggings of Australia as a nation. Very disappointed that it was canceled, I would have like to see the transition from a penal colony to a bona fide infant nation; it could have presented insight to Australia as we know it.",1528675200,,248,4.533333333333333

7027509,5,B00U2F8H6W,I really liked this.  Great acting and very good cinemaphotography.  The stories were very good very unique.  To bad they canceled it.  Seems like they always cancel the great shows so they can produce more rubbish/trash.  5 stars highly recommend.,1528156800,2,248,5.1

7027511,3,B00U2F8H6W,"Good cast, good overall narrative except for the part where every episode is about one of two convicts escaping the noose at the very last second. Not surprised it didn't make it- the cast and crew deserved better and could have really made it a fascinating exploration of the penal colony.",1528070400,2,290,4.705882352941177

7027515,1,B00U2F8H6W,"Depressing.  Just depressing.  Maybe season 2 was supposed to turn this around.  I can't say more without giving away the plot.  But wow, I regret committing to it.  Good actors.  But it's a story too over the top with injustice and sadness.",1527292800,2,241,4.619047619047619

8703957,4,B00U2F8H6W,"I find it strange that it took near the end of the season before anyone was hanged. In real life that was not the case. inmate hangings were very frequent. I did think there was too much crying. I'm like lord lord lord its jail what do you expect. Some of the scenes left you scratching your head. If your going to be locked up over 20 years and thousands of miles away why would you expect your girl friend or wife not to move on. The idea that the one guy who got the dear john letter could not understand why a friend did not tell him the truth. When it finally came out the guy went psycho, his friend was right not to tell him.",1534291200,,632,3.984251968503937
8703958,3,B00U2F8H6W,It was a good show but this is the third show I have watched that some episodes are doubled up and you never know what happens. Kinda sucks so the show gets a 5 and Amazon streaming gets a 1,1534204800,,190,3.775

8703962,4,B00U2F8H6W,Emotional historical fiction and I fell in love with it but sadly the show was cancelled. So frustrating to watch an exceptionally well made show that ends after 1 season. I am crying BBC.,1533772800,,188,4.5588235294117645
8703963,4,B00U2F8H6W,"Not quite sure why this series was discontinued and Jamestown was not. This had much better acting, more believable, and less soap opera drama than Jamestown.  BBC should think about doing a 2nd Season.",1533686400,,202,4.9411764705882355
8703964,4,B00U2F8H6W,"Loved the show despite some major flaws. Acting and script and SCENERY was exceptional. The final 'demolish all' episode left me wanting to see more. Sadly, that was not in the works. No idea why it was canceled except that this part of Australia's history was sad indeed - Major Ross and the following years would even have been worse if you included Norfork Island or Tasmania.",1533686400,,379,4.6716417910447765
8703965,5,B00U2F8H6W,"The series grew on me, especially the characters. Excellent cliff hangars made binge watching easy.  So sad to see this series cancelled, considering all the garbage on TV that is allowed to continue.  SHAME on you BBC!",1533427200,,219,4.891891891891892
