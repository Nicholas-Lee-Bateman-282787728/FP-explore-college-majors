7955040,5,B00005UOT1,I don't understand all the complaints or the low reviews. There was only one or 2 episodes where there was minimal syncing issues. I enjoyed every one..,1516665600,,152,4.666666666666667
7955041,2,B00005UOT1,"I love the series and watched all of them a couple of years ago.  Problem is these early episodes are not taken from the best sources.  The audio isn't properly synced to the video and the video resolution isn't as good as I watched several years back.  These early ones are definitely the series finding it's footing.  Some of the scenarios are ludicrous even, but it gets better and within the series runs there were some real gems that were some of the best TV drama.  Martin Milner and George Maharris had good chemistry.  The theme of two young men discovering America one town at a time for short working stints and traveling on America's Highway in a Corvette convertible is one of the freshest ideas ever put to celluloid.  The on-location shooting was the ace in the hole in telling the diverse stories with equally diverse people.  The time in our country with a fading innocence of a time forever gone but, it was perfect for this travelog drama.  If this classic TV drama appeals to you I suggest you look for the better sources.  Perhaps this collection gets better in sight and sound as I've only watched a few episodes?  As an Prime member I do appreciate this series being added for our viewing only I expected better quality.",1512777600,4,1242,4.574660633484163
7955042,5,B00005UOT1,"I was 9 years old when this series came out. I couldn't stay up to see it, it was on after my bedtime.  But by the 4th season, I got to see parts of it. This series has so many great plots, the series was a leader of quality television for that era. Great scripts and good actors. What a quality old TV show.",1511827200,,308,3.8125
7955043,5,B00005UOT1,"Genuine '50s scenes, cars, music, young adults. The first road trip on tv.",1511222400,4,74,4.769230769230769
7955044,5,B00005UOT1,Real good show. Brains and brawn on the highway. Never saw it before but was a fan of 1 ADAM12 starring Milner.,1510358400,4,111,4.090909090909091
7955045,1,B00005UOT1,"This review is for the Amazon Prime streaming version.
It's unwatchable..soundtrack is WAAAAY out of sync with the video. Pity, I love this show..but this version is worse than watching english dubbed Godzilla flicks..their lips move, and two seconds later you hear 'em speak..",1509840000,7,277,5.318181818181818
7955046,2,B00005UOT1,"This should be a 5 Star review. When I was a kid, this was one of the best shows on TV. Written by Stirling Silliphant and directed and acted by some of the best in the business. Shot on location across the US (very unusual for 1960) and it was hip, man. Unfortunately, Amazon Prime has saddled us with unrestored, out of sync (the sound is not in sync with the picture) 16mm quality copies of this once brilliant show. A pity. Look for it elsewhere.",1509667200,10,450,4.244186046511628
7955047,4,B00005UOT1,"One of the best of the early 60s life-on-the-road dramas, lifted by stories rooted in the real locations used for filming and by Stirling Silliphant's gift for dialog. A great TV time capsule for a compelling period in America's history. On a technical note, of the first 5 episodes I've watched there is a noticeable lip sync problem beginning with episode 2. Amazon, please correct this issue so that everyone can enjoy all the episodes of this fine series!",1509235200,6,459,4.822784810126582
