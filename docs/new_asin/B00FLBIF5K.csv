6005823,5,B00FLBIF5K,My son LOVES the GiggleBellies!!!!! He could watch them all day on our computer via Youtube. Now we have them on DVD and I don't have to worry about him tearing up my laptop.,1384992000,,174,4.147058823529412
6005824,5,B00FLBIF5K,"Just to see the smile on my little grandsons face and watch him dancing and clapping along to the music, is my only comment.",1384819200,,124,4.208333333333333
6005825,5,B00FLBIF5K,I have a 23 month old and a four month old and they both love the GiggleBellies :) Its the only way Mom gets anything done! Thank You :),1384819200,,136,3.7241379310344827
6005826,5,B00FLBIF5K,This is the best Gigglebellies dvd yet.  The animation is the usual fantastic video but the music is more toned down for bed time and definitely more relaxing.  If you are going to get a video for your children or grandchildren this is hands down the best one you can get.,1384214400,3,272,4.313725490196078
6005827,5,B00FLBIF5K,"My daughter loves all the Gigglebellies songs, especially the lullabies DVD. The songs, graphics and animations are absolutely amazing. These creators rock!",1382745600,2,156,6.136363636363637
6005828,4,B00FLBIF5K,"I'm not gonna lie; I find the Gigglebellies videos deeply disturbing. However, my kids really, REALLY love them. The songs are very well done and catchy, and these lullabies are my favorite so far. I would much prefer to have them on CD only, rather than video, because the characters scare the bejeezus out of me, but it's one of those sacrifices you make for your kids. They're the Teletubbies of today. Anyway, personal fears aside, I can almost guarantee your toddler or preschooler will love the Gigglebellies, and you'll enjoy the songs, too. Just close your eyes if you have to.",1382572800,,585,4.745098039215686
6005829,5,B00FLBIF5K,"I've had three children and have seen more then my fair share of children's song videos. Gigglebellies are BY FAR the BEST written, animated and fun music videos for young children that I have EVER seen!! These are great. They have kept my children's attention and they LOVE the songs! I can not recommend any of the three Gigglebellies' videos strongly enough. They are worth it!!! Try it for yourself and you'll totally agree.",1381363200,,428,4.797297297297297

6005843,5,B00FLBIF5K,"It Worked! I actually found this by searching ""sleepy"" because my 5-year-old grandson would not calm down and lay down to go to sleep.  As soon as the first song started, he was hooked. The songs progressively get a little calmer and ""sleepier"". After the third song, I was going to turn it off, but he said he wanted to listen to another one  He was asleep before the end. Mission accomplished ",1477612800,,395,4.458333333333333
6005844,5,B00FLBIF5K,"My grand daughter is not a good sleeper at all. She has to go for a ride in the car to get her to fall asleep. She came to my house and twice I put this on and was able to hold her and have her fall asleep while I rocked her in my arms. That doesn't sound like much to most people, but that's huge!! It's perfect for getting small children and babies to sleep or just for some down time.  So many times, the music is ok for the child but the adult has a hard time dealing with it. Not in this case. The music is some that adults can deal with too.",1476576000,3,547,3.7155172413793105

6005913,5,B00FLBIF5K,"As you can read from the other reviews this is a wonderful dvd for children.  My 2 year old daughter loves it!  We have watched it over 20 times since we bought it a month ago.  This is the bedtime version so the songs are slowed down.  All the gigglebellies DVD's are visually fantasic you cannot go wrong with any of them.  My daughther's favorites on this volume are ""Unicorns and Fairies"" and ""All the Pretty Little Horses"" but all the videos are exceptional. She also loves the Owl character.

The most lively/upbeat video is ""Great Big Ocean"".  My favorite video is ""Good Night Sleep Tight"" it is wonderful to watch and I never get tired of it. Everytime I see Peanut and Kissymoo and Bucky and the sheep sleeping in the barn it makes me smile.  The 2nd version of ""Twinkle Little Star"" is just as good if not better than the first on Gigglebellies vol 1. In this volume it follows a lot more of the little critters such as the lady bug, snail, bumble bee, dragonfly, fireflies, and butterflies.

The formula for each DVD is working, I cannot wait to see the next DVD with the Humpty Dumpty video and see what comes next. AHOOGA!!!!!!!!",1409702400,2,1142,4.451923076923077

6005935,5,B00FLBIF5K,"I love the GiggleBellies series, they always get my son's attention and he stops crying in a second! I feel it magical. I loved the volume 1&2 so I decided to buy the lullabies, and it was just as wonderful as I thought. My 7month son stares at the TV and sometimes make a smile when he waches the GiggleBellies DVD. I live in Japan and I'm Japanese, and it's really difficult to find DVD's like these in English here in Japan. Some items on Amazon.com don't ship to Japan, but this does and the shipping's really quick. I'm looking forward for other volumes to come out soon. I use this lullaby DVD for my son's nap time. Sometimes he can't concentrate on sleeping although he looks awfully sleepy, and DVD works :)",1398211200,2,716,4.390977443609023

6005937,5,B00FLBIF5K,"The DVDs are amazing but it cost me a small fortune before the Post Office would hand them over because of additional taxes and duty. I hadn't been charged taxes when I bought the first set of GiggleBellies on the Amazon website.but when I tried to purchase a second set  I was directed to an American Amazon website and thus encountered the tax problems.

6005940,5,B00FLBIF5K,My son couldn't get enough of the clips of these videos on Youtube so I bought him the videos which he would watch on a continuous loop if I allowed more than an hour of TV a day.  When he started preschool he had a serious separation anxiety problem so I bought a second copy of these videos for his school to play during their daily TV time to help and it worked like magic... in no time at all the teachers where directing other parents to me to find out where I got the videos since they hadn't heard of Gigglebellies yet.,1396051200,,526,4.106796116504855

It is as though he gets hypnotized and always falls asleep within 15 minutes or less with their lullabies.  I could not recommend this dvd any more.  p.s. I studied voice for years and the vocals on this dvd are fabulous. In my opinion, this is by far, THE BEST lullaby dvd out there.

The movement is lovely and in the lullabyes, my little Travis starts yawning and falling right asleep.  I couldn't ask for a better made DVD for children.  Heck, I even LOVE listening to them and watching the stories unfold through the characters.  I must say, I just love Bucky!",1388361600,,576,4.447619047619048

6005979,5,B00FLBIF5K,"We own all three Gigglebellies DVDs, and this one is just as great as the other two if not better. The graphics are stellar, and the music is wonderful. When we first played it, our daughter wasn't super interested, probably because the music is softer and less peppy than the others. Now, it's her favorite of the three. At 15 months old, she's not interested in any TV that doesn't involve music, so these DVDs are the only things she'll watch. We play this one before bedtime, and she loves it.",1387324800,,497,4.472527472527473
6005980,5,B00FLBIF5K,My daughter has been a giggle belly fan since she was just days out of the hospital.

The songs are beautiful too and my two little girls, ages 2 and 4, adore this video! They live the animal characters.
