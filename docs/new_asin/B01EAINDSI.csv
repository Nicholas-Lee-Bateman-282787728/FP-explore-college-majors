You helped make someone very happy !",1482451200,,103,4.473684210526316
8758241,4,B01EAINDSI,"Slime time is another great addition to the Octonauts collection! In this DVD, the characters are battling different adventures with gooey, slime! My 3 year old girl particularly loves watching the episode with the eels. She though it was so funny that they 'spit' goo! The short episodes even kept the attention of my 8 month old. Octonauts is great about incorporating lessons about helping each other while also providing great education about different marine animals in the creature report. In Slime Time, our favorite was the mudskippers! She even recognized them when we went to the aquarium! Another great Octonauts!",1477958400,,624,5.188118811881188
8758242,5,B01EAINDSI,"What a fun dvd by NCircle!! The Octonauts have always been one of our favorite shows and this movie is no different. The fun comic relief mixed with the educational learning aspect and problem solving pieces, you have the making of a great childrens show! I appreciate that you have to learn how to work with a team and that anyone can do anything if they have support and confidence in themselves. I really like that you also get the real life pictures of the creatures at the end, that way the children know what the animals actually look like. Great job NCircle.",1473206400,,565,4.495145631067961
8758243,5,B01EAINDSI,"Octonauts: Slime Time is the newest release in this fun, animated series that encourages an interest in marine biology in both young and old! I can't state enough how much I enjoy the premise of this show in that it serves as a springboard for further learning in the area of all things aquatic! My kids get plenty of laughs at the silly antics of the characters and the funny situations they find themselves in. I continue to be amazed at some of the fascinating organisms I've never even heard of in my 33 years! This all leads us to dive deeper into further exploration of these super cool creatures. I can't say enough good things about the Octonauts, and there is only one negative aspect relating to this particular DVD (having nothing to do with the actual show). I believe this to be the first disc that repeats an episode already included on a previous release (episode titled Slime Eels- found on Crocodiles & Crabs DVD). I understand that most people probably don't own all the discs in this series, so it would not be a big deal to many; however, it's one of my pet peeves to have a duplicate of the same episode on different releases. The new episodes being released are Great Algae Escape, Snot Sea Cucumber, Marine Iguanas, Mudskippers, Sea Skaters, Sea Pigs & Giant Squid. Regardless, I still feel it is completely worth adding this to your collection- Octonauts has yet to disappoint in my house! :)

8758244,5,B01EAINDSI,"This is a great collection of eight 10 to15 minute episodes featuring our favorite underwater explorers, The Octonauts. We follow along as Captain Barnacles and his crew explore the world's oceans, rescue the creatures who live there and protect their habitats. This collection has episodes with some wild creatures such as Sea Snot Cucumbers, Mudskippers, Marine Iguanas and Slime Eels! The Octonauts teach lessons about the importance of helping others and preserving the world around us-above and below the waves!  Bonus Features include episode selection and in-depth explanations of all the sea phenomena featured in the episodes via short animations and fun songs! I recommend this DVD for ages 3 to 7. It's fun, silly and informative on a relatable level for this age group. Reviewed by Eli B., KIDS FIRST! Juror.

Do you like adventure, fun and marine biology? Then Octonauts: Slime Time is the perfect DVD for you and your family to watch together. This animated collection of eight shows offer fun-filled adventures where you learn about all kinds of fascinating creatures including algae, snot sea cucumbers, slime eels, marine iguanas, mudskippers, sea skaters, sea pigs and even giant squid. This is a really great collection of shows that are educational, exciting, interesting and fun to watch.

I like that they have so many different characters who all love to help sea creatures and find out more about them. It is really great that they are helping young kids learn about the ocean and spark their curiosity about the creatures who live there. One of the best features of this collection is that at the end of each episode they have a creature report which reinforces, through song, all the informational things for that episode and includes a clip of what the actual real creatures look like.

Even though there are many different characters which I enjoyed very much, my absolute favorite is Shellington (Keith Wickham). He is goodhearted and very inquisitive about oceanic creatures. The way he voices this character truly adds brilliance and friendliness to it. There is also Tweak (Jo Wyatt), a smart southwestern rabbit, Captain Barnacles (Simon Greenall), a kind polar bear, Dashi (Teresa Gallagher), an adorable dog, Peso (Paul Panting), a goodhearted penguin and Kwazii (Rob Rackstraw), a daredevil cat pirate. There is a wonderful gang of all kinds of animals and vegimals (Michael Murphy) who are just too cute for words. Their different personalities all come together as they help some fascinating creatures of the sea.

My favorite episode is with Marine Iguanas. I loved it because it is fun to watch and I had no idea that these creatures even existed and learning about them was incredible. This episode also involves a bit of a mystery and is very quirky. I learned quite a lot and loved seeing what they looked like in person in the creature report at the end.

I recommend this show for ages 4 through 18. Younger kids will love the animation and will learn about some terrific creatures. Older kids and adults will learn new things about these stupendous creatures and might even learn about a couple they never knew about before. I give this DVD 4.5 out of 5 oceanic starfish.
