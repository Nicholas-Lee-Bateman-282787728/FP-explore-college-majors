8192383,5,B000PMFRTM,"This is the type of film you saw as a triple-feature at the drive-in theater or a feature film at a college campus movie theater back in the 1970s. During this era, independent filmmakers began making blaxploitation films as well as what I call ""Lesbloitation"" films. Cheerleader films were also very, very popular as well as other types of ""sex romp"" movies. These were low-budget films made for specific audiences but these films developed a cult following that spanned all demographics.

""Just The Two of Us"" is such a film that is considered a ""Lesbloitation"" film, made in 1975. These films were made primarily for a young male audience, as there is plenty of nudity, though it's tastefully photographed. However, they also appealed to gay women, who were searching for anything that even remotely represented themselves on screen or TV. Most films featuring lesbians were highly sensationalized (""The Fox"", ""Walk on The Wild Side"" ""Caged Heat"" ""The Killing of Sister George""), with sad or tragic endings. One could consider ""Just The Two of Us"" a modest but significant contribution to the history of LGBT cinema.

What makes this film a milestone is the sympathetic, positive portrayal of lesbians in this film. Unlike the majority of lesbian pulp novels (and movies up to the 1970s), nobody dies or suffers severe retribution as a result of being a lesbian or having an affair with a supposedly ""straight"" woman. Neither of the main female characters in this movie treats lesbianism as an ""experiment"" or a ""phase.""  They really do love each other wholeheartedly. The film has an unabashed openness about lesbianism and sexuality which was quite revolutionary back in 1975.

Basically, it's the story of two housewives, Denise and Adria, whose husbands are frequently gone for long periods of time. The two wives have lunch at a restaurant and see a lesbian couple at the next table holding hands and talking. Their open affection piques the curiosity of the two housewives. so they discuss what they saw with their two bridge partners. Naturally their friends find the open lesbianism disgusting. Afterwards, Denise tearfully confesses her love for Adria, wishing they were like the two women at the restaurant. The two make love and start a relationship, going horse back riding, miniature golfing, and riding the carousel at Santa Monica Pier.

A man does enter the picture, but not on a permanent basis. Denise and Adria meet a couple of actors at a pier and go back to their apartment for drinks. Adria falls for Jim, a sleezy actor who sleeps with wives of producers in order to get acting jobs. Adria convinces herself that she's in love with Jim and he with her, so she breaks it off with Denise, who is heartbroken. Denise confides with the two women at the restaurant; the two women bring her to a swinging party where she meets Mona, an attractive but very aggressive hostess who uses pot and a pool table to trap and seduce young women. Just before things get very serious, Denise freaks out and takes off.

SIDEBAR: In the party scene, there's a troupe of  3 dancers to entertain the guests; the tacky outfits and the cheesy choreography is hysterical. I thought they were unintentionally hilarious in their attempt to be so ""artsy"", but they come off looking very, very stoned.
The interior decorating of the homes were wild at that time--there was a lot of orange: orange shag carpeting (BTW, the longer shag carpeting needed to be RAKED daily); orange wallpaper with matching orange sofas, white wallpaper with giant orange flowers. The ultimate 70s decor was wildly patterned foil wallpaper and dark wall paneling.  At the end, there's a credit of where this was filmed: Rockpointe Homes in Chatsworth, CA. Given the HIDEOUS interiors, who would want to take claim for them? I'll bet now Rockpointe Homes never wished they'd been credited in this movie!

The 70s fashions are all there, from the men's long ""Beatle"" haircuts, bell bottom jeans, and mustaches to the women's long hair, ""layered look"" outfits, bell bottoms and very short dresses. Though dated, the clothing and hairstyles aren't as bad as the loud, tacky interiors of the various rooms.

Unbeknownst to Adria, Jim is two-timing her with a producer's wife in order to get an acting job; also, she doesn't realize that her husband has decided to come home early from his business trip. Long story short, hubby is waiting up for her when she and lover boy Jim stumble through the front door. A brief scene of violence follows, the only one in the film, where the husband beats up Jim and hits Adria twice in the face, causing her mouth to bleed. As a final violent flourish, Jim tears off Adria's bathing suit top, before storming off. The D-Rama of it all!

SPOILER AHEAD

The ending is surprising for a film of this era. The two women end up with each other; nobody walks off alone. Denise goes to the carousel where she finds a somber, downtrodden Adria. It is a somewhat teary, emotional reunion. We don't know what happens to the husbands at this point, though it is implied that the two women have decided to be together. Interestingly, in choosing Denise, Adria enters a more equal partnership, as opposed to her marriage to her husband, where he  referred to her as a ""child bride"" and viewed her as a pretty but dim bimbo. Though the ending is not a joyful reunion of the two women, it is a positive one since they go off together. This film was initially titled ""The Dark Side of Tomorrow"" but I prefer the current title ""Just the Two of Us."" The earlier title indicates something dreary or sad, and really does not fit the storyline.

I love Wolfe's packaging of this vintage film, using a Lesbian Pulp Fiction-like cover from the 1950s-60s era for the artwork. Given that the director is a feminist, it's easy to see why this film was so open for its time. It was a tentative step towards a more positive portrayal of lesbians in film. There's even some local bands credited in this film, singing generic 70s soft rock tunes.

Wolfe did the best they could in transferring to DVD what was a very worn-out 35mm transfer, so the picture quality really shows its age.  The soundtrack is bad--this was a low-budget film meant for drive-in theater speakers; you could tell it was filmed with cheap sound equipment; at times, the voices sounded muffled. The acting is over-the-top in some places; these weren't your A-List film actors. It is downright cheesy at times, bordering on kitsch. But the film's heart is in the right place. If you love low-budget drive-in movies from the 70s, blaxploitation films and the like, you will enjoy this little gem of a movie.",1432771200,,6658,4.796684118673648

8192386,5,B000PMFRTM,"The plot for this film centers on the lesbian affair, between two lonely housewives. Both of these women are neglected, by their frequently absent husbands. After seeing two lesbians showing affection at a caf&eacute; one day, the two housewives become intrigued.

The wives wind-up turning to each other for companionship, and eventually, a love relationship. The bedroom sex scenes between the wives are romantic, and tastefully filmed. They are also shown cavorting with each other through a park, on a merry-go-round, and riding horses along the beach.

One of the wives is seduced by a handsome young man, and this causes a strain in the relationship between the two women. The young man was only using the woman for sex though, and then he leaves her. Afterwards, she's left to ponder whether the lesbian relationship with her friend, is truly right for her or not.

Overall, the treatment of lesbianism in this movie, was positive. Especially considering that this film was made back in the 70s. Women's lib, had only just begun to filter into mainstream society by then. Even though society was already in a post-Stonewall period when this movie was made, the mainstream media was still basically homophobic in the 70s.

So this film does stand-out, as one that treats the subject of lesbianism with sensitivity, and in a non-judgmental way. It was ahead of it's time, in showing that lesbians were just as human, and worthy of respect, as their heterosexual counterparts. It was a bold way, to portray lesbians on film in the 70s. Highly recommended, for those interested in seeing a film about a tender, loving lesbian relationship.",1262044800,4,1642,5.003663003663004
8192387,2,B000PMFRTM,"Nothing but boring. First of all, the character of Adria has one of the most annoying voices ever. She plays the clueless, can't add 2 plus 2, and all I like to do is shop stereotype...that is until she hook's up with her best girl friend, whom she promptly leaves for the an actor, who is only using her.

The movie is really boring, the characters, although pretty ok (not well) developed, are actually very boring. So, is the rest of the movie. I fast forwarded a lot.

The movie at least confronts some stereotypes, albeit briefly, about homosexualism and nature v. nurture. It even talks about tolerance. Yay for them. Still, a very boring movie.",1207958400,6,651,4.603448275862069
