8532555,5,B000009DLI,"This is the last video made in the Bolshoi during the Grigorovich era. It was made in 1990, when the company had wonderfull veteran dancers and at the same time many new stars. Nikolay Dorokhov, who came to the Bolshoi  from Uzbekistan is a surprisingly good Danila. His style is very secure and  his acting abilities are very good indeed. Liudmila Semeniaka, the most  talanted balerina of her generation is also shown as a surprisingly good  actress. The wonderfull Nina Semizorova, who still dances as a prima in the  Bolshoi is possibly the best dramatic balerina in the company since  Plisetskaya. Her style is secure and light and her acting is as good as  that of her collegues. Yuriy Vetrov, such a charming drosselmeier in the  Nutcracer, is now an always drunk, evil Severian.
Some of the othe  dancers are mostly the rizing stars of the company. A wonderfull gypsy  dance is performed by Yuliana Malkhasiants and Gedeminas Taranda. A waltz  on the ""Bronze mountain"" features basically all of todays stars  in the company -Sergey Filin, Sergey Bobrov, Irina Zibrova and Elina  Palshina among others. Other characer roles are performed by A. Loparevich,  A. Melanyin, L. Okhotnikova and M. Sharkov.
The orchestra conducted by  Alexandr Kopylov is once again proven as the best theater orchestra in the  world. The subject is based on a number of stories by Pavel Bazhov - one of  Russia's most famous fairy tale authors. Profofyevs music is unusially  ""classical"" and ""Russian"".
Right now the company is  very different. Artistiic director Vladimir Vasilyev and head of the ballet  company Alexey Fadeichev are now making more and more new productions (in 5  years there were 16 new operas and 14 new ballets). The dancing of the new  stars of the company is quitte different. Svetlana Lunkina, Maria  Alexandrova, Angrey Uvarov and Nikolay Tsiskaridze are more romantic and  yes, in some ways better. But this performanse illustrates one of the  company's best periods.",964828800,15,1979,5.015384615384615
