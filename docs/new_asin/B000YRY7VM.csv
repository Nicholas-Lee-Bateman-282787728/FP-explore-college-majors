3035201,5,B000YRY7VM,"This is the 3rd in the One Foot In The Grave series and once again is hilarious.  All the episodes on this dvd are so funny, yet with a touch of sadness in a couple.  This is one of the classic UK comedy shows and well worth recommending to anyone wanting to have a good evening of laughs.",1229299200,,289,3.9655172413793105
3035202,5,B000YRY7VM,"I just love this show! I found it by accident when purchasing other British comedies on Amazon. It's a comedy along the lines of Fawlty Towers, The Thin Blue Line and Blackadder. Yet, One Foot in the Grave is distinctly unique. It covers an overlooked segment of the population (the recently retired & aging segment).

If you have never saw One Foot in the Grave, start at season 1 and work your way up. The show and characters are more enjoyable watched in order, as many times they will work off something that occured in a previous show. Season 3 is perhaps the best of the series, so far, with the characters having grown and really filling out their roles.

An overview of the story (starting at Season 1), is about a 60 year old man (Mr. Victor Meldrew) whom is forced into retirement and has his whole life turned upside down. As he battles against a world that now longer makes sense, trouble seems to find him at every corner. Richard Wilson plays Victor Meldrew and Annette Crosbie plays as his wife Margaret Meldrew. Both Crosbie and Wilson are hysterical & believable. Victor being on the brink of a breakdown all the time, and his wife the voice of sanity, that brings humor to every situation. Or is Victor the sanest of them all? The older I get the more I identify with grumpy ole' Victor Meldrew.

Great show that gets funnier every season. If you are a fan of British comedy this is a must see!",1210464000,6,1412,4.465116279069767
3035203,5,B000YRY7VM,"Third season of a great british sitcom.  Those who love the traditional britcoms will love this one.  Great acting, hilarious storylines.",1208649600,2,137,5.476190476190476
3035204,4,B000YRY7VM,"David Renwick has created a very unique Brit-com. Created during the waning days of the Thather/Reagan era partly as a statement of how the Governments had neglected the needs of many people such as the Elderly, the young, the needy and so on. These issues were made comic fodder for our hero Victor Meldrew, a man who goes to work one day to discover that he's been replaced by a box. At 60 years old Victor feels that he has many good years left and  now faces a new life and how to keep busy.

Victor's wife, Margaret tries to help as best she can, but she's not the biggest fan of his passions. (magic, ventriloquism) Victor's biggest passion seems to be correcting the wrongs of the world which he attempts with great enthusiasm. Most often these endeavors end in disaster, but on occasion they are successful such as an encounter with a computer salesman that's comic gold, as well as what happens when he awakes in the hospital, thinks he's dead and sees a man who he thinks to be God.

To some, the dark, sick and twisted scripts may be off putting. On first viewing, one would think that Mr. Renwick hates Victor but the true payoff is that after all the disasters and fights, at the heart, Victor and Margaret truly love each other and Mr. Renwick does a wonderful job of showing us this without beating us over the head with it as would happen on American TV.

Richard Wilson brings great life to Victor. We feel Victor's pain when he goes too far and tries to make amends to a world who, sadly doesn't care. This is a fairly complicated series (on American standards) i  is certainly not as wild and broad as a Fawlty Towers or a Thin Blue Line but it's well worth a look",1208390400,3,1683,4.381410256410256

3035207,4,B000YRY7VM,"not the funniest of this series but certainly enjoyable, especially for those who love these characters.  cracks me up!  Nice to watch a comedy / sitcom with inane dialog and set up for lame situations or jokes, or sexual innuendos that have nothing to do with what is going on - it's just in your face because they want you to watch -- and some will because it's there.

3035208,5,B000YRY7VM,"Victor Meldrew (Richard Wilson) seems never to be really happy, and peculiar things are always happening to him. He's not the easiest person to love and live with, but his long-suffering wife, Margaret (Annette Crosbie) handles him better than anyone else could. There is also a cast of characters who come in and out of the Meldrew's life as well as friends and neighbors who remain constant delights. Part slapstick part sitcom and part black comedy, you'll either love this series or hate it. I love it and own several of the 6 seasons. I wish there had been 6 more. I've just recently started watching them again and adding the rest of the seasons to my collection.

We often mimic him by saying "" I can't believe it "" ! Most enjoyable especially if you're over 50 and can relate to his lifestyle and bothers.",1357776000,,275,4.5
3035211,5,B000YRY7VM,"Season Three is hilarious. Victor keeps moaning and complaining and his wife nags right back. I have to wonder what they were like before Victor was forced to retire. Too bad they never filmed a flashback episode! Included with Season Three is a Christmas special. If you're unfamiliar with One Foot in the Grave, please don't expect this to be the least bit Christmasy! True, there is a pile of manure with Christmas lights strung across it, but that's as seasonal as it gets. I had never seen this special, and found it hilarious, although, in keeping with this series, there are dark moments as well. I highly recommend this DVD set to anyone who enjoys comedy that is also just a bit weird.",1327881600,,694,4.604838709677419

I like this program because it doesn't insult my intelligence, I don't have to hear the F word in every other sentence and I'm not flashed with T & As.  I don't know why but it seems British comedy before the 1990s just seems funnier than ours.  If you want a good laugh, I'd check this out.",1483920000,,458,4.206896551724138
8234001,5,B000YRY7VM,"Dark humor in the best British tradition, ""One Foot in the Grave"" is the sad tale of Victor and his long-suffering wife, Margaret.  Victor is between jobs and spends his time getting into spats with the neighbors and just about anyone else he comes across.  If anything can go wrong in his life...it will, and he will spend eternity grousing about it.  The shows are about a half hour long each and they pack a lot into them.  Another long-standing character who appears is Mrs Warboys, who also ends up with her life crumbling down as often as not.

This season includes a dark (of course!) Christmas special that involves radioactive allotment dirt.  Another one is about a battle over garbage/littering, and another sees the Meldrew's burgled so that they end up sitting on lawn chairs in their living room staring at the place where their tv used to be.  Oh...and bird's nest dropping on Victor's head during a wedding video, and trying to get a man in to shave off the bottom of their doors so they will close over new carpet.

One wonders how Margaret has put up with Victor for so long, but then an episode happens where you realize they are, quite honestly, made for each other.  You also can see that they honestly do care for each other...in those instances (rare, though they are) when Victor's kinder (gasp!) nature comes through, albeit ever so briefly.

Don't expect a light-hearted slapstick romp through the daisies and you might enjoy this show.  Victor is hilarious to watch, but he is definitely not the guy you want living next door to you.",1447113600,,1560,4.656934306569343
