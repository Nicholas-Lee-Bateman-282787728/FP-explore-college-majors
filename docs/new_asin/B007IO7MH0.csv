8517660,5,B007IO7MH0,Great DVD of As The Worls Turns featuring Carly and Jack. It is a joy also to see the shows again. I am particularly fond of scenes with the great Colleen Zenk as Barbara Ryan. One of the best daytime villainesses of ALL time!,1334793600,5,226,4.159090909090909
8517661,5,B007IO7MH0,"We have to give Soap Classics credit for preserving and producing these beautiful sets of soap opera episodes for fans to enjoy for posterity. Thankfully, the fans are buying these sets at high rates which leads to the company releasing more and more sets as the months go by. So far Soap Classics has released full sets of ""Guiding Light"" and ""As the World Turns"" and talk is ""Another World"" will be next with other serials to follow suit.

 Soap Classics has bought the rights to the huge soap opera collection of Proctor and Gamble's which houses thousands of soap episodes from late 1979. Anything before that year was pretty much wiped or destroyed by the networks or Proctor and Gamble which explains why very few vintage episodes of ""Guiding Light"" and ""As the World Turns"" has been made available for fans. Still, these are amazing sets with the shows cleaned from their original prints, come without commercials and unfortunately there are no bonuses.

 This set of ""World Turns"" features ten episodes from the supercouple of Carly and Jack, one of the tentpole couples in the series' history.

 The episodes along with their airdates are:

1. ""First Kiss"", September 19, 1997
2. ""At Teague's Cabin"", Jan. 29, 1998
3. ""A Very Happy New Year"", Dec. 31, 1998
4. ""The Compass"", July 13, 1999
5. ""The Lie"", Dec. 12, 2000
6. ""The Funhouse"", April 23, 2002
7. ""Worth It All"", June 9, 2003
8. ""Bringing Back Jack"", Nov. 24, 2004
9. ""'Til Death Us Do Almost Part"", Sept. 25, 2007
10. ""I Really, Really Do"", Sept. 15, 2010",1333324800,8,1522,4.677902621722846
8517662,5,B007IO7MH0,"This is another new set in the Soap Classics line.  They seem to be popping them out on a regular basis now.  The transfers to DVD are excellent, and it's nice to see complete episodes without commercial breaks.  Carly Tenney (Maura West) and Jack Snyder (Michael Park) were one of the most popular ""super couples"" of daytime, nabbing several daytime Emmys over the years for their strong acting.  This set of 10 episodes has highlights of their relationship, from their first declaration of love through to their last (?) wedding.  It's nice to see many other Oakdale residents in these well-selected episodes.  The only negative to these sets is that there are no extras -- at a minimum, cast credits for each episode would be helpful, even if the episode originally ran without credits. Also, if you weren't following ATWT throughout these years, or you have a poor memory, you might be frustrated to see these involving stories and not know how they were resolved.  Nonetheless, as a CarJack fan, I'll take what I can get.",1333238400,7,1026,4.795454545454546
