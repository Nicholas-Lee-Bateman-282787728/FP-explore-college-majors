640855,4,6303419348,"Speechless is delightful! The chemistry between Davis and Keaton is the best I have seen in a long time. In my opinion, this is Davis at her best! Plus, the story is very interesting and has those great ""ups and downs"". I also give high marks for Christopher Reeve and it is sad to see that this was one of his last pre-accident movies. As with most romantic comedies these days, the characters have to go to bed, but thankfully, it is kept off screen. Rated PG-13 for some language and implied sex.",987638400,14,499,4.376344086021505
640856,2,6303419348,"Geena Davis is of course cute, but this romantic comedy about speech writers in opposing political camps is fluff and cotton candy, kind of like something from Neil Simon without the bite and with only a quarter of the wit. The candidates and the issues are trivialized and made into clichs. (But that's good.) Must have been written by a speech writer! She's a liberal Democrat and he's an amoral Republican hired gun. It might have been more interesting if they had switched them around. It's all surface and sound bite mentality including the performances by the leads, Geena Davis and Michael Keaton, who together produce enough chemistry to rival cold dishwater. If you're really, really bored and it's a choice between, say, a rerun of ""Suddenly Susan"" and this, flip a coin. Or better yet, go scrub the kitchen floor. This is the sort of mush that will turn your brain to cottage cheese.
Some observations: Christopher Reeve is sadly miscast: he makes a very soft heavy. Geena can smile and smile and smile and occasionally frown. Big deal. Poor Bonnie Bedelia. They made her look so dowdy, so as not to upstage Davis. It must be frustrating to know that not only are you more talented than the star, you are even better looking; but for an actress in Hollywood, younger always wins out.",966384000,4,1294,4.730088495575221

640859,4,6303419348,This movie has the wonderful touch of both romance and comedie that match as much as the main stars do. Michael Keaton and Geena Davis have the right chemistry and invite us to live their story.

640958,4,6303419348,"Really enjoy this movie, it's a real romantic comedy (that is, romantic and funny, rare indeed these days!).  I won't repeat what other reviewers said about the plot, acting, writing, etc, all good.  But I do want to put my oar in on why I am not ""upgrading"" to the new blu-ray and am staying with my old dvd.  No subtitles!!!  So for those of you to whom this matters, the old dvd with subtitles is still available.
Update: Right after I wrote this review, Olive Films started adding subtitles on some of their movies, told me they are planning to include on all by the end of the year.  Too late for this one, and so many other old classics like Father Goose, unfortunately.",1456185600,2,676,4.376
641017,4,6303419348,"Speechless stars Geena Davis and Michael Keaton as Julia Mann and Kevin Vallick, a pair of speechwriters for opposing New Mexico senatorial candidates. Julia is her candidates long-time speechwriter, who helps him get to the finish line of his latest campaign while camped out in a hotel preparing for a debate. Kevin is new to speechwriting. Formerly a writer on a TV sitcom, Kevin has been lured into the political battle to help the opposing candidate. Both Julia and Kevin are insomniacs and meet in an all-night convenience store, where they share the last bottle of Nytol. Theyre attracted to each other but lie about their professions.

Reminiscent of the smart repartee of a Cary Grant-Katharine Hepburn screwball comedy, Speechless came out shortly after real-life political speechwriters James Carville and Mary Matalin got together while working on the 1992 presidential election. The film works because of the great chemistry between Davis and Keaton. They achieve a naturalness and sincerity that make their characters and their romantic interest believable. The movie defies expectations by having Julia and Kevin almost instantly fall for each other, rather than go through the usual, cliched scenes as antagonists gradually realizing they love each other.

A major drawback is that director Ron Underwood downplays the campaign in favor of the romantic slant. The importance of the election is not stressed adequately or given enough screen time, which doesnt allow the main characters intelligence and ability to shine. Julia and Kevin are smart people. There should have more of them guiding their respective campaigns.

There are no bonus features on the Blu-ray release.",1455321600,,1690,5.345864661654136

641026,4,6303419348,"I'm not a fan of romantic comedies unlike a lot of women. I love a good romance though, and I appreciate Speechless. I've always been a HUGE Michael Keaton fan and will watch almost anything he's in. I didn't watch this movie when it first came out in '94. At the time it didn't seem like something I'd be interested in, but I recently got it on On Demand and enjoyed it. I decided to order the DVD for my collection. One reason why I don't like romantic comedies is because many of them are so silly and the woman acts so stupid and lacks confidence. But Geena Davis is a wonderful heroine. She's strong, smart, and witty. She is the perfect match to Keaton's character and challenges him while keeping him on his toes. Both had good chemistry and the movie was full of intelligent humor. If more romantic comedies were like this one then I might change my mind about the genre.",1420675200,,879,4.365853658536586
641083,5,6303419348,"Such a cute movie. Good writing and Michael Keaton and Geena Davis have great chemistry. The political back drop doesn't completely hold up in the current political environment, but this is a solid cute romantic comedy.",1419984000,,219,5.111111111111111
641084,5,6303419348,"This is a charming romantic comedy which revolves around the friendship and eventual romance that develops between two rival speech writers who are working for opposing candidates vying for the Senate seat in New Mexico. Most of the comedy arises from trying to resolve the inevitable tension and conflicts which arise from this complicated association, where doing a good job means being critical of the rival's candidate and yet not making it a personal matter that could destroys or poison their true feelings for each other. Their respective bosses are running for the vacant Senate seat and each team is doing their utmost to persuade the voters *their* candidate will work harder on issues most important to them. The teams are doing their best to outsmart the opposition in winning votes and use creative techniques which at times are totallly hilarious.

Michael Keaton plays Kevin Vallick, a former Hollywood sitcom writer, turned speech writer for the Republican candidate Garvin. Julia Mann played by Geena Davis is the speech writer for Wannamaker the Democratic candidate. They unexpectedly meet at midnight at the hotel's gift shop trying to buy the same box of Nytol, a non-narcotic sleeping agent for their common malady, insomnia. The next day, they meet again and develop a budding friendship which leads to a drive across the border to Mexico on the spur of the moment. At this point they do not yet know each others true roles, Kevin acknowledges his past job as sitcom writer and when he reads Julia's name tag on her jacket, which identifies her as a newspaper reporter, neither corrects the misconception about their current positions. They have a terrific time in Mexico and both are acutely aware that it has become a budding romance, the implications of which are on the minds of each. After they return and are met by members of their candidate's team, both fully realize the true job of the other and the impact it will have on their relationship.

Conflicts and tension arise regarding their true feelings because they are required to make their candidate look good at the expense of the other. Add into this mix, the arrival of Julia's boyfriend, Bob Freed, a documentary specialist, who eventually becomes engaged to Julia and yet remains clueless about Kevin and Julia's intimate feelings and their recent fling. Nearing the finish, the race for the Senate seat becomes even more blood thirsty and cut-throat. Kevin is incapacited after a night of revelry with Julia although he was the more aggressive writer is unable to write his speech for Garver. Julia is more idealistic and issue oriented, can not awaken Kevin and cares enough about him to write the script for him; it shows Garver in a whole new light: family oriented, sensitive to creating jobs and overall in touch with what matters most to the voters. After this episode, Garver is in the lead,  that is, until a leak about his accepting bribes is made public  after which Wannamaker jumps ahead and wins the nomination. Needless to say, this becomes the ultimate clash which nearly shatters the relationship between Kevin and Julia beyond repair. .It is a pleasure to watch the resolution to the confllicts between the candidates and even more grat fun to see how Julia and Kevin recognize and acknowledge their true feelings for each other in a very public display. The actors are all phenomenal This was an enjoyable and satisfying film and is highly recommended. Erika Borsos [pepper flower]",1419897600,2,3490,4.960683760683761

641249,4,6303419348,"Michael Keaton and Geena Davis are great chemistry and free wheeling in this too close to the truth spoof about political campaigns.  After a chance meeting each other due to insomnia, they become endeared and looking forward to a continued and deepening relationship.  Neither one truely stated what their jobs were, more of generic descriptions.  Then, they accidentially find that they are the key speech writers for opposing candidates for Govenor of New Mexico, and essentially major political enemies.  This is obviously a severe conflict of interest, but they are still intensely attracted to each other.  But, mud slinging for their candidates, one-upsmanship and dirty tricks keep them at odds and crossing paths in the revolving door of multiple campaign stops and oft times the same hotel.

Loads of funny lines, with not a scene that doesn't add to the build up to an unpredictible climax.  All I can say, it is 100 minutes of enjoyable entertainment where both actors are at ease with themselves and each other.  I like Michael best in this type of comedy role where he isn't the bad guy.  Again, from the very start, you know that they are ""meant"" for each other, they just let their required stand-off jobs control them most of the film.  Great stuff especially if you are bored or down, this will lift you up.  This is my favorite movie for each of the actors.

641253,5,6303419348,"The 1994 movie, ""Speechless"" is an excellent romantic comedy.  The script, beautifully written by Robert King, sparkles with wit and intelligence.  Here is just one of the many lovely bits of dialogue in the movie:

Julia: Shall we speak the unspoken language of love?
Kevin: You mean the kind only dogs can hear?
Julia: Yes, the very same.

Director Ron Underwood makes the most of the script by using a light, deft touch which makes the movie shine. Mr. Underwood's first major movie was the 1990 science fiction movie, ""Tremors,"" which has become a cult classic. He was a talented director then, and he does a superb job with this movie.
In ""Speechless,"" he also makes good use of a fine ensemble cast: Michael Keaton plays the role of Kevin Vallick and he gives another of his many superb performances. Mr. Keaton is one of our finest actors, and he doesn't miss a beat in making his role interesting, engaging, and funny.
He shares the lead role with Geena Davis. Ms. Davis' lively, vivacious performance perfectly balances Mr. Keaton's fine work. Together, they simply sparkle with wit, charm, and imagination.
I was also very impressed with the work of Bonnie Bedelia, who plays Mr. Keaton's former wife and present boss. Ms. Bedelia plays her role with a delicate balance and grace. Her work is of the highest order. In fact, the entire cast and crew should be complimented for their fine work on this production.
So, please give this superior romantic comedy a try. It will pleasantly beguile your time and leave you feeling good about how much fun it is to watch a really well-made movie.",1297382400,,1598,4.758122743682311

The movie is a somewhat unlikely campaign speech writer's meeting made in heaven that degenerates into he thought she said that he said.
I kind of liked it because I like both the leads Michael Keaton and Geena Davis, but I wouldn't really call this their finest hour.",1242777600,,378,5.112903225806452
641256,4,6303419348,"Speechless is a romantic comedy that pairs Michael Keaton and Geena Davis as speechwriters for opposing campaigns. No doubt it was at least partially based on or inspired by Mary Matalin and James Carville. One difference though--in Speechless she's the Democrat and he's the Republican. Though the politics are only a pretext for a little rom com thrust and parry, one couldn't ask for better sparring partners than Geena and Keaton.

--------------------------------------
stage direction: [While riding in back of pickup truck to get gasoline]
Julia: Is that cologne?
Kevin: Black Flag. You know, it's manly, and as you can see, not a roach in sight...
--------------------------------------

In this version of reality both parties are corrupt (wait a minute--are you sure it's fiction?). The wedge issue of immigration is one difference though, with the Democrat opposing the construction of a ditch between the US and Mexico, while the Republican spins it by dubbing it ""The Friendship Ditch."" Score one for Keaton. The only one who really believes in the speeches is Geena Davis' character. She is doing it because she wants to make the world a better place. Keaton is a former sit com writer and he is in it strictly for the money--and the laughs.

Christopher Reeve played Keaton's rival, a Network Television News Journalist who was Geena's former boyfriend, and now her fianc. This movie was just a year before Reeve would have his tragic riding accident that would leave him paralyzed. There is one strange bit that became a running gag about her former boyfriend having a tattoo on his lip. If we ever find out what the tatto says, then I must have blinked. Though the gag doesn't really go anywhere, they have some fun running with it:

--------------------------------------
[They are talking on the phone]
Julia: My old boyfriend had a tattoo, on the inside of his lip. Wanna guess what it said?
Kevin: Uh, ""How am I driving? Call 1-800"" and then a number? Did he have a really big lip? Was it Mick Jagger?
--------------------------------------
A little later there is an amusing scene as Keaton wonders if Reeve is the tattooed boyfriend and tries to get him to show it.  Anyway, Reeve would have to be Superman to keep Davis and Keaton apart. From the moment they meet in the hotel pharmacy and try to con each other out of the last box of No-Doz, you know that they have a lot more in common than just insomnia.

Though the politics are a little dated, in some ways it is prescient. But the main reason to watch this is the witty dialogue, clever script and acting, and of course the strange alchemy between Geena Davis and Michael Keaton.

Julia: Shall we speak the unspoken language of love?
Kevin: You mean the kind only dogs can hear?
Julia: Yes, the very same.
