4891085,5,B005TK2252,"HIGHER GROUND is a movie about ""Faith"":  people searching for Faith, people struggling with Faith, and, finally, people coming to the realization that they never have had or never will have Faith.

Vera Farmiga both directed and stars in this engrossing drama about a young woman, pregnant then married at eighteen, who gives herself over to a New Testament church, only to eventually question the religious dogma she has embraced.

Based on the memoir, THIS DARK WORLD by Carolyn S. Briggs, HIGHER GROUND not only boasts an exceptional directorial debut and an award-caliber performance by Ms. Farmiga, but it also features a stellar cast that includes John Hawkes, Donna Murphy, Joshua Leonard and Norbert Leo Butz.

Extras on the 2-disc Blu-Ray/DVD Combo Pack from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment include audio commentary by Ms. Farmiga, Joshua Leonard and producer Renn Hawkey, deleted scenes, a ""Making of"" featurette and a Q&A session from the L.A. Film Festival.

4891086,5,B005TK2252,"This film is all about the journey, looking for God and coming to know God, and learning to live the questions rather than convincing yourself that you have all the answers.  I believe God to be infinite.  We, however, try our best to fit Him into a box, limiting Him with our own perceptions and understanding.  This film does a great job destroying the box.  I can hardly wait for the DVD to come out so I can watch it again.  It really leaves you with a lot of food for thought...I have been noshing on it for a couple weeks now.",1319760000,4,532,4.176470588235294

Vera Farmiga stars in and directs this new indie based on a memoir by Carolyn S. Briggs, who also co-wrote the screenplay. Set mainly in the 70s and 80s, Farmiga plays 'Corrine', who grows up in a household with a alcoholic father and ends up rebelling against her estranged parents by hooking up with a musician boyfriend who eventually gets her pregnant. A near tragic incident, where their newborn child almost drowns after the band's van falls into a creek, propels the young couple toward becoming members of a group of Christian Fundamentalists.

""Higher Ground' then charts Corrine's commitment and eventual estrangement from the group. The sect is depicted not as a bunch of Charles Manson-like crazies but rather young, hippie types who attempt to cope with the modern world in often contradictory ways. Perhaps the best part of the film is in the depiction of how group members don't always fit into the stereotypical view as to how Fundamentalists are supposed to act. For example, the group does not shy away from dealing with the topic of the inability of some male members of the group who are unable to sexually satisfy their wives. The pastor ends up playing an explicit cassette tape, providing sexual instructions that will help the men perform better in bed. Despite the awkwardness of the get together, the Fundamentalists are at least not shown to be complete prudes.

Corrine and husband Ethan also seem positively reasonable when they first allow Corrine's sister to stay with them but soon have to kick her out after they discover that she's been holding drugs at their house for a friend. On the downside, Corrine's community does everything they can to alienate her from her faith. Being a bit more intellectually inquisitive, she attempts to interpret some Biblical passages before the congregation in a more intellectually sophisticated way. She ends up being reprimanded by the pastor's wife, who insists that the women in the congregation ""know their place"" and not attempt to preach since that's a ""man's job"".

There are other disturbing events that undermine Corrine's attraction to the group. After Corrine's best friend, Annika, is operated on for a brain tumor, she ends up as a virtual vegetable in a wheelchair. The group seems to be in denial about the tragedy and hide their feelings by insisting everything is alright because this was ""God's plan"". Later, when Corrine's marriage breaks down, she's brought to one of the group's marriage counselors, who admits that he cursed a local politician for committing adultery. Corrine seethes as the counselor interprets the politician's death in a car accident the next day, as retribution for his infidelity.

Perhaps where 'Higher Ground' falls down the most is in it's lack of development of the principal characters. We really get to know next to nothing about Ethan, except that he loves his children and has a very bad temper. Do the films' scenarists ever show him at work, interacting with people in the work world? He's either completely demonic when he attempts to choke Corrine after she makes it clear she plans to leave him or still a loving father when he shows up at Corrine's family get together. Aside from the domestic histrionics, why not flesh the character out a bit more, as to some idiosyncrasies? The same goes for Corrine. It's actually Annika who has the more interesting personality (before the brain surgery) with her sexually-laced drawings and speaking in tongues. Since she spends almost all her time rebelling against her Congregation, there's little in getting to know Corrine as a flesh and blood human being. At film's end, Corrine has adopted a bit of a saintly persona and like Ethan, the feeling is that we don't get to know her as a completely drawn character portrait at all.

Corrine makes it clear at film's end that while she still has respect for the Fundamentalists due to their strong faith, she cannot abide by their narrow-mindedness. I had a little trouble believing that the Congregation would actually let her speak in her final sermon as they had already barred her from speaking when she was part of the group.

On the whole, 'Higher Ground' is a noble attempt to critique religious fundamentalism but doesn't quite come off as completely convincing drama or fully fleshed out character portraits.",1318032000,2,4377,4.971311475409836

4891119,5,B005TK2252,"As an ex-fundamentalist who still has (appreciates/seeks to understand) faith, I say this is one of the most honest and accurate films around about what it's like to need, and to find, a path out of the fear, meanness, and closed-mindedness that defines the far right sect of Christianity. Vera Famiga is amazing as a director and star, and Norbert Leo Butz should have gotten an Oscar for his portrayal of an evangelical pastor here. It's spot on!  Anyone who cares about this sort of thing will love this film.",1441411200,,512,4.688888888888889
4891120,5,B005TK2252,"I haven't read the book yet (just ordered it), but I did purchase the movie from Amazon Video and watched it last night.  Basically it is my own story, but I began ""leaving"" at age 21.  I'm now 66.  It absolutely IS possible to leave the idea of a metaphysical Being completely, though it may take a lifetime, as in my case, due to childhood brainwashing/indoctrination.  This is hinted at at the end of the film---when you finally see that for HER it is not Real.  The dogs outside, her husband's assault on her life, her friend's brain tumor -- those are real.

Faith (or belief, if you wish) is the real mystery.  What is it, and why do people from farmers, business people, astrologists, doctors, lawyers, moms and dads -- from the Bronze Age to UFO'ers, Earth worshipers, and crystal gazers today, even terrorists --, seem to need it?

Ask any Christian Fundamentalist that question, and apart from quoting the Bible at you they show that they do not really understand the depth of the question.  Being ""saved"" is not really about Jesus, God, Love, Salvation, Works, Sin, Heaven, Hell, or eternal consciousness---it is always and only about the power and persuasion of your belief. If you have listened to them carefully, and read the Bible, this seems to be their very personal God's only unyielding and unequivocal need.",1441238400,,1327,4.734782608695652

4891125,5,B005TK2252,"My initial reaction was puzzlement.  I could not see who this movie would appeal to.  It had too much frank sexual content and exhibiting of worts among the faithful.  That would sadly shut out a big part of Christians.  Then it also had heavy religious content which may shut out most of secular audience!  So who would enjoy this movie?  Well, luckily, I LOVED it.  When the movie ended I was saying to myself, man, this movie is a masterpiece!  But how many people would see it to recognize it to be a great movie?  I am afraid that this movie is just not as accessible as  Robert Duvall's inspiring 'Apostle', another great Christian movie.

First let me come out and say that I am a true believing Christian.  I am probably as 'religious' and 'Christian' as anyone out there.  That may be why I appreciate this movie so much.  However I must also add that this movie is quite challenging to Christians.  This movie is just not aimed to uplift and inspire fellow Christians.  This movie aims to present life as it is,  seen thru the artist's eye.  For that reason,  after seeing the movie,  I really appreciated the original title of this work  -  'This Dark World'.  But I guess such title would have limited this movie's target audience even more! LOL  But people should take heart.  We ARE perceiving only in parts, as through the glass darkly...

I wish more Christians would watch a great movie like this rather than the usual 'let us inspire you and affirm your faith' type movies out there.  Yes, we may disagree with some church goers' behaviors in this movie and find them unacceptable.  ( For me, the counselor, 'prophet' was the most unacceptable figure in the whole movie. )

But let me take a cue from this great movie and quote you a Bible verse to counteract 'the unacceptable':  ""Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.""  1Peter 4:8

To God be the glory.",1395273600,,1915,4.541176470588235

4891127,5,B005TK2252,"We live in a society where women are still overlooked even though Christ came through a woman. Why are men still blaming their weakness on us still. This film was great in so many ways. I thought it brought out women being strong, we are not property but we are human beings. Christ is listening to us all, we do have a say so in the house of Christ. There is plenty of work to do. She, Vera Farmiga was portraying a strong woman seeking to find a higher ground in her walk with the LORD. Hindered by the men in the congregation because of gender. Why are we still on this page. We are not in the garden and woman are working all day long even if it is taking care of children. The film depicted a woman that had something to offer, but was ignored many ways. If the men had the power, they could have done something about the emergency that took place with her friend, and fellow sister in Christ. Why do men what the control, yet they didn't how the Power. Get the Power! I like strong people the gender matters less to me, just get the job done.",1377561600,,1048,4.142156862745098

Though not intended as an exciting movie, nor is it, it is a movie than anyone with faith will relate to. The trials, tribulations and temptations of Vera are real, credible and convincing because a calling of faith is not what most folks without the calling perceive it to be. Vera did an excellent job at relating what true faith really means to the human condition. It's a must see for all folks of all denominations. I doubt anyone without faith of any denomination would understand this movie....it's an inside story. I  not only related to Vera but also experience it daily too.

I liked the slow pace of the movie in that it allowed one to absorb the feelings of the characters as they develop.

It's obviously a labor of love that Vera Farmiga has wanted to do her entire life and puts 100% of her heart and soul into it.

4891179,5,B005TK2252,"Most of the reviews posted deal with the theme of the movie. And that's fine, for that's what  movie reviews do. Explain and dissect the film, explain its story line, the action, the meaning of it all. I am not going to do that in this review! Why? Because there is no point in it for me. Films, as music and books, are all very subjective things. Someone will love a film, another will hate it. The same holds true for music, books, and paintings. I once took a course in college, an English course. The professor asked the class to review an artistic work, and tell why certain elements of it should be changed, to perhaps make it a better work. Of the 30 students in the class, I was the only one that said, "" I wouldn't change a thing about an artists work "".

The reason I wouldn't change anything is that if one did change something- then it would no longer be the artist's work ( vision ). Imagine changing the lyrics to John Lennon's "" In My Life "" or the smile on Da Vinci's Mona  Lisa.

Thus, I will not comment on the vision of the artist here. But I will comment on the artist's talents ( again, my opinion only).  And the artist I speak of is also the director, Ms. Vera Farmiga. I will comment on her acting talent.

Vera Farmiga. Get used to the name. (It sort of flows off one's lips, doesn't it?) I believe you will be hearing a lot more of her in the future ( READ: Oscar Winner ). When I watch her on the big screen, I can hear myself saying, "" Oh, I bet I can do that!"" ( act ). She makes it seem THAT effortless. But, alas, I can't DO THAT.  Because great acting isn't the least bit effortless. Or easy. Or something you can learn by watching someone do it. The greatness of an actor lies within the nuances, the pauses, and that ability to hold your attention without ever uttering a syllable. THAT'S where the true talent comes in.

They say acting is reacting. It is that. But it is so much more. It is the culmination of the years one has lived on this earth, the tragedies, the heartaches they've endured. The grief and the joy, the sorrow and the hurt, the longing to be liked and loved, all bottled up inside that reactive face, standing there, naked, exposed, vulnerable up on that big screen ( or more appropriately these days-the big screen TV ).

There are a lot of good actors. Capable. Handsome. Pretty. But there are only a handful of GREAT actors. Actors who study the craft. Call on every experience they've ever had (or suffered). Who thus somehow catapult themselves into another realm, a HIGHER GROUND, and reach for a star. And then become one.... Vera Farmiga.",1335484800,,2602,4.293877551020408

The screenplay is a rare experience into disappointment, love and laughter, the individual and the community.  This is the kind of movie that should win an Oscar. The characters display tenderness and the harshness of reality so exceptionally well that it's a shock, for we normally do not experience this.

This is not about faith perse, religion to me plays almost no role in the movie.  It is the observations, the marriages that fall apart, the friendships giving way because of illness and disability, the kindness that is bestowed on one another, the flawed and fake caring, the genuine, tender moments between lovers and friends and parents and kids, and the subtle cruelty for the main character, which is the same in any community; silence the one who speaks up and questions authority and power.",1331337600,3,946,5.006369426751593

Also read the reviews here on the movie.  That being said, those that give the least amount of stars seem to be the most judgmental of the author and maybe never experienced their own dark nights of the soul that can bring on doubt.  I feel the author just told her story as she felt and lived it.  You have to take into account her history and the place in time she arrived into the world. For some reason speaking honestly of doubt about any major religions seems to draw criticism from many.  Maybe because it is a scary thing for most people to admit to doubt?  Somehow I don't believe true faith should be in the same breath as terror and fear.  Back to the movie...I really liked it.  The author is on a journey like all of us and she had the guts to share hers which I admire. The actress is great and the filming is wonderful.

4891185,2,B005TK2252,"Vera has probably thought this through by now.  She should be congratulated on her brave attempt at such a difficult subject.  But the final product seems more a loose string of glimpses into someone's difficulties within a tight Christian community than a cohesive narrative that keeps itself on target with clear objectives.  Vera should have studied films like the Apostle, by Robert Duvalle, more closely.  In that movie, although it does not come to any intellectual conclusion, it depicts another human beings struggle to maintain integrity with their beliefs while the tension is maintained through the story of this individual committing a crime and then evading the police until they corner him.  There is also the other tension of his relationship with his ex-partner or his attempts to ground himself in a community.  Each of these are clearly developed and keep the attention of the viewer.  Vera's failing is that she did not have a well conceived idea of how to make her spiritual explorations work probably because she has not worked these things out for herself on a personal level.  It would have been valuable for Vera to have come to some conclusion about these issues herself on a personal basis, through the guidance of a competent psychotherapist or a grounded spiritual guide.  I believe the movie exposes Vera's own lack of a cohesive framework about her own spirituality and she tries to make a case for it's OK to muse over these things ad nauseum, but movies are about the resolution of crisis and not about it being OK to wallow undecided.  Vera fails to commit to any side of the battle on so many levels and so the film goes nowhere and the viewer does not experience any transcendence or resolution at any level.  She brings up the important question, but then offers no opinion but that it's OK not to have an opinion, leaving the viewer with nothing but a collage of vaguely related religious thematic scenes in this woman's life.  Her characters are also trivialized and her religious thinking so superficial, based mainly on her feelings and her attachment to the materialization of her expectations in the world; a very childish notion of what religions belief is about.  Vera is beautiful, but does not appear to have personally suffered in ways that Charlize Theron has for her art (see Monster).

As a religious skeptic who spent many, many years in a patriarchal, fundamentalist church, I found this film so liberating--the emotional experience of questioning a safe and much-loved community and feeling farther and farther from that circle of warmth and closer you come to your authentic self--that territory is covered masterfully by Farmiga in her deeply intelligent performance.

4891211,4,B005TK2252,"Higher Ground is quirky. It jumps around a bit and makes one wonder what was left on the cutting room floor. There are several stories behind the story that don't quite get told, such as when this Evangelical group went from church to ""house church"" and then back to church, again. But since I lived through those times and saw many events like this in my own life, I found it easy to connect the dots.

Higher Ground was disturbing for me as someone who saw a fair amount of abuse in the Evangelical scene, and as someone who finally escaped it. I know several people who are suffering emotional and spiritual scars from their times in that scene, and this film helped bring some of that stuff to the surface.

Higher Ground is thought-provoking, just because of what I said above. I spent more time talking about this film afterwards than any other in recent times, probably just because I lived through similar things as the protagonist in this story. I came to the concusion that her ""Higher Ground"" was actually questioning what was going on around her.

I wouldn't call this a ""must see,"" as some other reviewers here. I'm glad I saw it, as it gave me a chance to reflect (once again) on some stuff in my own personal history with the Evangelical scene. I will continue on my journey of faith, and I will continue to seek ""Higher Ground.""",1328486400,,1344,4.5

It was a waste of film, higher ground wasn't depicted, I would NEVER recommend it, I thought it was an embarrassment to believers.

4891213,5,B005TK2252,"Higher Ground follows a girl from the time she accepts Jesus Christ at Bible School until years later, when she makes the decision to leave her husband and family because she can no longer accept the role that is required by her church, husband and community. She begins to question her faith and commitment in all areas as she realizes she no longer ""fits"" the required mold.

She feels like an outsider, even years later as she sits with her only good friend (a maverick if I ever saw one) at a religious meeting and chafes at the fact that the place for women in the organization allows for no real participation, and no deviation from the rules.  Even so she gains more self-confidence in her own perceptions of who and what she is. Family strife; the slow disintegration of the marriage that is apparent only to her; some hilarious scenes with her friend; learning to drive a 4-speed MGB, and some very heart-warming scenes make this a great movie, although it sounds very pedestrian in the telling.  And the music is beautiful - in the background, gospel music follows a lot of the action.

4891214,4,B005TK2252,"Having established herself as an actress of considerable talent, Vera Farmiga turned her sights on the director's chair last year and tackled a fairly weighty subject for her directorial debut. Higher Ground. Based on a memoir by Carolyn Briggs, Higher Ground also stars Farmiga as Corinne, a woman who enters a radical church upon getting married and pregnant at eighteen, only then to question her faith several years later as her marriage begins to fall apart. Like her Up in the Air co-star, George Clooney, it seems Farmiga's transition to behind-the-camera work was a successful one, as Higher Ground is a really good movie, it's a challenging first film with some strong performances, including, of course, Farmiga in the lead role. It's a quiet, thoughtful drama that touches on some philosophical dilemmas, so let that guide whether or not it's your type of Friday rental.",1328054400,3,881,5.082758620689655

But I didn't really get absorbed either. I think it was because I didn't care enough about the characters or especially the main character (at least as an adult, I was more interested in her as a teenager). I couldn't really feel the attraction the church had for our heroine. I also didn't buy her best friend as a real person; she was too perfect, gorgeous, and movie starish, and was married to a unappealing drippish guy [of course talking about the character, not a real life person or I wouldn't be so harsh]. Those were the bad parts. The acting was overall good, and there was still an overall feel of authencity, so not bad, just not as good as I'd hoped.",1327881600,5,840,4.356687898089172

4891238,4,B005TK2252,"All too often, movies focused on an individual's religious struggles have trite endings and pat resolutions. I won't give away the ending of Higher Ground except to say that the film's conclusion- like the entire movie - was neither simplistic nor predictable. The woman at the heart of this movie struggles to reconcile her inquisitive, questioning nature with demands that she  accept Jesus as the ultimate touchstone for her life. She finds the restrictions difficult to obey, including dress codes (or the pressure to follow certain codes) and deferring to men.

She desperately yearns to believe and her yearning is poignant. At the same time, she  often feels out of place among those who never question their faith. She is buoyed up by one friend who shares her playfulness and even moments of daring but the friend also has a stronger commitment to her faith. There is  a pivotal moment concerning this friend but I won't reveal more about that. It is shocking and intense.

What adds to the power of this film is its potential appeal  to people from many religous backgrounds, particularly those who can relate to the difficulty in finding a spiritual path. Themes that reoccur include the fervent desire to keep learniing, even if this means reading ""forbidden"" books, difficulty in accepting a husband's ultimate authority, pain when scolded by other women in the community for being uppity and out-spoken,etc.

Also believable: discovering that the outside world has its own pitfalls, making it harder to find the right direction. Is it within the safety net of all she has known or somewhere else? Again, not simplistic, with fully fleshed out characters.  I am deducting one star for some events which aren't fully explained and seemed a bit baffling- at least to me.  I still highly recommend this movie. It could prompt deep reflection or at least raise interest in different types of Jesus-based worship and the varied lifestyles and communities of some believers.",1327017600,4,1981,5.033639143730887
4891239,5,B005TK2252,"Vera Farmiga, along with being five months pregnant in her own life at the time, tackles yet another interesting topic that could have been overly inflammatory although with her, it is not. Using an honesty and bravery which she is so easily capable of in this film which is also, her directorial debut.  She is looking at the subject of one woman's (Corrine Miller, also portrayed by Farmiga) faith and the trust she has in it. Along with this comes the eventual questioning about herself through the vehicle of the 1970's Fundamentalist movement.  This portrait has a lovely soundtrack (Alec Puro) that brings this all to life and is definitely worth noting.  Farmiga directs without the condescending or mocking tone towards Christianity which is often present in films.  It has an intelligence along with a broader appeal, to the believer and the nonbeliever alike.  It is a question of personal faith, not of righteousness through Christianity.

The movie starts with Corrine's childhood in Vacation Bible School with the pastor, Bud (done surprisingly by Bill Irwin).  The picture quickly shifts to Corrine's teenage years. She (Taissa Farmiga, Vera's actual younger sister) is a writer and meets her future spouse, Ethan Miller (here, Boyd Holbrook, then an older, Joshua Miller.  The younger Ethan wants her to write for his rock band.  They eventually marry and a short while after their first daughter is born.  A heart-pounding tragedy then happens.  This leads the couple to their established adult family life in a fundamental tight-knit church community.  Ethan has given up the rock life and is an elder in their church. Corrine is a devoted and devout young wife and mother.  Add to the mix her best friend, Annika (Dagmara Dominczykz) whom Corrine is so close to. She adds light, color, and life to their friendship.  'Nika' is extremely devout herself as she is also playful, sometimes silly, and fun for Corrine.

There are so many happenings throughout the fifteen-year marriage, both in her church life and her personal life. Vera Farmiga handles this with a special skill and precision, which leads our protagonist to doubt and the questioning of her faith. Corrine begs God to help her to ""feel"" Him again.  At this point, she says that she ""feels nothing"" when she ""used to be so full"".  One situation which occurs is horrific to happen to Nika and to their relationship together.  I could literally feel the pain of it rip right through Corrine in a powerful reaction in their church.  I also saw the seeds of a huge loss grow ever deeper as it would send anyone reeling.  Nika is her confidante in life, her dearest friend, and the only one she goes to because she is able to question everything along with her.

Adding laughter of life with friends and family situations, CW (John Hawkes, one of my favorite character actors) portrays Corrine's father and injects some humor, although the piece itself is in no way a comedy. Humor is mainly brought into this story from the two friends which keeps their union fresh and close.  What they say or do may be frowned upon by the church although I saw it as anything any two extremely close` women would share in some instances.  This is another reason I find this movie so relevant, these two are friends in the truest form.

The ending is quite eye-opening for Corrine, without giving anything away.  We simply see Corrine, who has gone through just about everything unexpected in the film, walking out into the bright sunshine on the street.  This leaves an open-ended conclusion and a conclusion for the viewer to decide. See this for its great storytelling and provocative theme.  Also see this for a lively discussion afterward.  It was very helpful for me on a personal level and left me thinking on it for a long while, this is why I purchased it. I will watch it from time to time having fresh ideas about certain happenings within the film. A perfect piece to see with a spouse, significant other or friend to have a great discussion with afterward every time.",1326931200,14,4042,4.818840579710145

4891243,5,B005TK2252,"This is a review of the movie DVD disc only.

The film doesn't have the look of a plotted, story-boarded narrative. There's no imposed arc or resolution to the gentle moments of a woman's life shown here. We see her low-key movement toward, and then away from, religious attendance.

Contrary to what the film's cover might lead one to believe, this is no indictment of another megalomaniacal cult leader. There are no bad guys here. This film does a remarkable job presenting a series of realistic, slice-of-life scenes. We feel as if we are eavesdropping in a woman's everyday kitchen, at her everyday church services.

The producers also did a remarkable job finding actors to play the lead as a girl, then as a teen, then as a mature woman. For once, there does appear to be a continuity of features, unlike most films involving time progressions in which it's impossible to believe that child grew into an adult who would look like that.

This whole film is absorbingly realistic and touching. As movie-goers, we might be used to more dramatic action, so it takes a while to calm down into the more reflective mood of this piece. For example, it was only when I viewed this movie through for the second time, that I caught the moving coincidence of the scene in which Corinne sits on her church steps, patting a stray dog who has temporarily attached itself to her.

This isn't a chick-flick. Nor is it a charge against religious fanaticism. Nor is it any kind of standard beginning-middle-and-end story. This movie is unclassifiable - like life itself.",1326326400,12,1558,4.7555555555555555
4891244,5,B005TK2252,"Professional critics were fairly lukewarm toward this film, although even then, many acknowledged that elements within it are exceptional.  For one thing, it is very unusual to see a serious work that treats religion--and a rather fundamentalist form of Christianity at that--seriously and without insult, irony, or undue reverence.  Most films focusing on related topics either satirize people of faith (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saved/dp/B0002OXRSG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saved!</a>) or offer syrupy endorsements of faith&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fireproof/dp/B001KEHAFI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fireproof</a>).  Rarely is faith depicted as the mixed bag it often is.  While ""Higher Ground"" doesn't have the same scope and grandeur, in that one particular--treating faith seriously--it reminded me most of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mission-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00003CXBH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mission (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>.

I was surprised and delighted to see all of the five-star reviews already posted.  My concern is that many people would miss the uniqueness of this film and mistake it for either a hatchet job (because church life and serious spiritual commitments are depicted warts and all--it's not all smooth sailing for this male-dominated, anti-intellectual sect) or an endorsement of fundamentalism (because it's not all bad, either--the movie just assumes that faith provides comforts, joys, principles, and experiences that can have transcendent value for those who hold to it).

Sexuality, which is often a hot topic for fundamentalists, is treated frankly and realistically, and consequently provides some of the movie's greatest moments of humor. C.S. Lewis wrote that Eros is a comic spirit, and ""Ground"" does not shy away from that aspect of life.  It also shows a complex and authentically rendered family life that includes alcoholism, divorce, temptation, and the rigors and amazement of parenting.  Too, it tackles illness and loss.  It's a complete package...a touching and meaning-filled drama that will stick with you and will likely provoke some reflection and discussion.

From my own experience as a fundamentalist cut from a bolt of cloth not unlike the one featured in ""Ground,"" I can attest to its overall accuracy and authenticity.  I can also attest that, as with the main character, Corinne Walker, books, conversation, museums and personal independence can help lead one away from the less healthy, more smothering aspects of fundamentalism.  In my case, those things led me to question my faith altogether and to reconstruct my life without it, and I am better and more happy as a result.  We never see Corinne abandon her faith, but we don't see her giving up her quest for other, more expansive answers, either.

I think ""Higher Ground"" will be enjoyable to anyone open to identifying with someone who might not be just as they are.  A fundamentalist watching it can perhaps gain a better appreciation for the kinds of things that might make that life seem stultifying to some people; and the skeptic or non-religious person might gain some sympathy for how faith provides a foundation for some people to cope better with life's existential trials.",1326240000,45,3371,6.006263048016701

Still agnostic, as she goes through adolescence and adulthood, Corinne gives the pursuit her all.  But to be clear, this is definitely not a proselytizing endeavor or morality play.  Its complemented with clever additions of literary references, some sexual tutorials, including irreverent depictions of Connies amusing fantasies.  Farmiga is great in the lead, delivering her very honest, uniquely nuanced style, capturing natural slight shifts in mood and focus. I remember how in Never Forever, one of my all-time favorite films, she pauses during lovemaking to take Ha Jung-woos face in her hands, turning him gently and tenderly, locking eyes.  Now that was darn near spiritual. In one memorable scene here, Farmigas character, faces a mirror and rather urgently beseeches the Holy Spirit, employing every imaginable gesture and detail ever observed in her religious pursuit.

Instead, it is a poorly edited, painfully slow narrative populated by one-dimensional quasi hippy born-agains, who seem to have nothing to do other than sit together pondering God and occasionally praying or sermonizing.  I can see that Farmiga wanted to show the limited role of women in this stultifying existence, but it just does not come through.  Zero dramatic tension; like an EKG that is a flat line from beginning to end.  I dare say that all but a few minutes of this movie should be on the cutting room floor.
