5399593,5,B00A8GBVOK,"I've been an Avengers fan since childhood and I have to say this show pays it's respect to old mythology and new in this series.  The characters are all on target.  The writers aren't missing a beat.  It's just too bad that the show is being canceled.  It was too good to last.  It was very intellegent, and well produced.  It didn't fail this old school fan of the Avengers.  I just have to ask, what show is going to replace it?  I just hope the new Avengers series is just as complex and drawn out as this one.",1362441600,5,513,4.111111111111111
5399594,5,B00A8GBVOK,This is a great DVD with wonderful stories and the last of the DVDs for this series. The only disappointing part of this experience is that Marvel stopped making Avengers:EMH. Not sure why they did this because everyone I talk to loved this series.,1362355200,8,248,4.659090909090909
5399595,5,B00A8GBVOK,The story lines kept me involved and entertained regarding the storylines...granted not as good as the Young Justice League but close.,1362009600,,134,5.428571428571429
5399596,5,B00A8GBVOK,"Cant really understand why season 1 was sold in 4 parts when season 2 had the same number of episodes and was sold in 2, had both been in 2 that would have been much better",1361923200,5,172,3.8055555555555554
5399597,5,B00A8GBVOK,"To me, this is the best MARVEL cartoon since X-Men back in the 90s. Aside from Justice League/JLU in the early 2000s, this is one of the top comic book based cartoons of the new era, so far. So much greatness and surprises from the entire series: from the addition of new characters (Annilus!) to the formation of the, even though one episode, New Avengers. So what if the episodes weren't put together exactly how they were aired, if you're looking for entertainment then this is it. Marvel/Disney failed for cancelling this show since it had so much potential for the future. Imagine if they did Civil War? or Infinity Gauntlet? They dropped the ball on this one. I was happy to see a Secret Invasion arc and one of my favorite characters, Adam Warlock (even though he wasn't really as awesome as he is when Starlin was doing him in the comics). This show is a must have for comic book fans who just want to enjoy entertainment without over analyzing every little detail.",1361923200,4,973,4.565714285714286
5399598,5,B00A8GBVOK,This is an excellent super hero cartoon series somewhere between adult and children content wise.  As others have noted there are two episodes out of place in this series.  It hurts the story line if you don't view them in the proper order.,1359331200,2,240,4.558139534883721
5399599,3,B00A8GBVOK,"I consider this show my favorite children's cartoon of this decade, and decided to write this review mainly to quell people's fears that Disney jumbled the episodes again.  If you look up this DVD on disneydvd.com, they confirm that the first disc has (most of) episodes #39-#46 in broadcast order, and that disc two has episodes #47-52 in broadcast order.  The catch comes from the exclusion of episodes #40 (""Behold The Vision"") and #41 (""Powerless""), which&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Avengers-Earth-s-Mightiest-Heroes-5/dp/B008FYZHLK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes 5</a>&nbsp;includes.  From what I recall, the only noticable inconsistency that results concerns Captain America wielding his 1940s triangular shield in ""Along Came a Spider..."", then his usual round shield in ""Assault on 42"" onward.

I still have trouble recommending this DVD, though.  Most of these episodes have a new executive producer, so a drop in quality compared to the previous 1.5 seasons becomes noticable.  The pacing in some episodes feels more rushed than before, as if Marvel decided to take some scripts written for 2-part episodes, and condense them down into one part each.  Sometimes, he even got a different studio to write episodes.  Their work alters most Avengers' characterizations, sometimes giving them almost no screentime, for the sake of glorifying the most popular heroes.  Fans of the Incredible Hulk will also feel disappointed to know that he only appears twice in this entire DVD.  Despite all that, this DVD still contains a few gems, such as ""Ultron Unlimited"", and ""Operation Galactic Storm"".

If you already bought all five of Disney's previous DVDs, you should at least rent this one, to see some of the subplots reach their conclusions.  Hopefully if this volume makes enough money, Disney will release complete season boxsets in chronological order.",1358467200,7,1938,5.714285714285714
5399600,3,B00A8GBVOK,"ok so ... love the fact that the final dvd is coming out, but the episodes are not in order how they were broadcast. actually the whole season 2 is out of order, So please in the future release a dvd/bluray that has the actual right episode order, or at least a box set. thank you. and ps. why was this canceled amazing show.",1358208000,6,325,4.09375

It sucks that it is no longer on. We enjoyed the series.",1403481600,,96,3.85

5399620,5,B00A8GBVOK,"This is a great collection of the series. I wish it would have continued on as it was a great series. I also would have liked to have seen more episodes featuring some of the newer members like Vision and Yellowjacket. Overall, a great ending to the series even if the last episode seemed a little rushed to tie everything up quickly.",1402185600,,334,4.403225806451613
5399621,5,B00A8GBVOK,MY 6 YEAR OLD GRANDSON HAS THE WHOLE SERIES OF THESE BOOKS AND READS THEM OVER AND OVER.  THEY ARE A GOOD COLLECTION AND WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR ANY SUPER HERO SQUAD FAN.,1399420800,,173,4.242424242424242

5399633,5,B00A8GBVOK,"This video was well done for an animated video. The art work and animation was well done. These guys and gals who are the artists, are very skillful in their chosen profession. I tip my hat off to you. You do such excellent art work. I wish I had the abilities that they pocess to do this same work and I would love to work for a video animation company. It is very interesting work, I love it.",1381449600,,394,4.064102564102564
5399634,4,B00A8GBVOK,"I have all these on DVD and have read all the reviews. Having the episodes out of order is annoying but if you have the 5th collection you can still watch them in order, although it may warrant more exercise than most couch potatoes want.  Just watch Behold the Vision and Powerless after Along Came a Spider and all will be well in that respect.  It is, after all, equivalent to a Saturday morning cartoon, so in terms of continuity (if that means anything in comic books today), there are some changes and events that will annoy long time comic fans no end, but since this is not the comic continuity, I would recommend this collection to any one who enjoys comic book superhero animated adaptations.",1377993600,,702,4.563492063492063
5399635,2,B00A8GBVOK,"the whole battle with galactus was so weak, the series was setting itself up to be a climatic end and they ventured so far off from the original story.  even to really have the big guy as a none factor no show.  save your dough you will be disappointed",1374105600,,252,4.122448979591836

5399641,5,B00A8GBVOK,"I enjoyed every single Marvel The Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heros series and was glad Amazon had it in stock.  I received a few days after purchasing it.  I like every storyline in the series.  I am huge Marvel Comics fan and loved the Avengers.  overall, the movie was well what I expected in quality and everything else.",1369353600,3,323,4.614035087719298
5399642,5,B00A8GBVOK,"I been watching from season 1 and so far I really enjoy what the creators are bring out. Still, when finely Glaxtus was brought out. Well that was a downer. Still, over all I let you decide. I still give this a five star. Looking forward to next season. Don't know what going to be next but then thats the fun of it lol! Too bad there so many cry babies out there. I enjoy good comic and watching them in cartoons is great but at times, with restrictions could be better without restrictions...

Over all, for just being a... how can I say this nicely. I can't creators are doing there best, and that I will agree with. Good story line, different hang overs. Able to draw you in!",1369094400,,679,4.223076923076923
5399643,5,B00A8GBVOK,Thank you Marvel and Disney for putting out the final 13 episodes of the finest Marvel Cartoon Production of the Avengers ever.  Galactus and his heralds are absolutely spectacular.  That last episode was my favorite.  It brought together the Avengers and other heroes of the Marvel Universe to battle the World Devourer and his representatives.  Thank you for fulfilling this boy at heart's desire.  It rocks.,1368748800,,410,5.151515151515151

5399649,5,B00A8GBVOK,"Once again Marvel takes some of its best stories straight from comic book past and adapts them for the cartoon series. Tastefully done Winter Soldier storyline minimizes confusion, The Most Dangerous Man Alive is a really great Hulk story, The New Avengers is pretty much how the team is in comic books now, We get to witness the conclusion of the Avengers vs. the Kree, and it ends with the Marvel Universe against Galactus.",1364342400,2,425,4.756756756756757

5399651,5,B00A8GBVOK,"They finally put out the end of the series. (So sad.) But if you don't have Disney XD like me, and you haven't seen the series, then you may have not watch ""Behold... The Vision!"" yet. If that's you, then just watched it after the first episode on this volume, ""Along Came A Spider"" and you'll be fine.

It's really sad to see this show go. Part of me doesn't even want to watch the new show.",1363737600,,392,4.090909090909091
