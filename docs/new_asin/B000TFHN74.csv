8208826,5,B000TFHN74,"I enjoyed this show so much, I wish I had been in the audience!  I can varify that some of these ladies are award winners, because I presented their trophies to them at Wiggles of the West Belly Dance Contest in Reno (I am one of the Two Old Bags).  There are 2 Entertainers of the Year: Nadira and Shoshana.  And Raqs Habibi is an award winning troupe.

All the dancers are fabulous!  I am especially glad to see Sa'diyya and Shanna getting some DVD exposure, they deserve it.  Congratulations Cheeky Girls you have done it again!!!!",1197244800,6,534,4.453608247422681
8208827,5,B000TFHN74,"I have been a connoisseur of belly dancing for many years and I can say that these women absolutely know belly dancing. From their technical skill to their artistic interpretation, this is truly a balanced and professional DVD throughout. That fact that the DVD was produced by a dancer was also quite evident as the true art form was highlighted which has not been the case with other belly dancing DVDs I've purchased. By Dancers for Dancers is a beautiful representation of one of my favorite art forms.",1185494400,13,506,4.761363636363637
8208828,5,B000TFHN74,"This is a very solid performance dvd, and I think it's a great value for the money.  All of the dancers are polished, graceful, and professional.  As with Vol. 1, there were no crazy camera angles that were a distraction- the whole dancer was in view the entire time.
I enjoyed watching the different ways each dancer interpreted the music, and they all had beautiful costumes and were beautiful to watch!  All of the dancers chose routines that focused on their dancing (not their props) and I found them all to be very fluid dancers.
This DVD is full of good performances.  I don't think you'll be disappointed!",1185321600,13,613,4.648148148148148
8208829,5,B000TFHN74,"The unique thing about this DVD series is that each dancer has the final say about the editing and presentation of her performance, meaning that you are seeing her dance the way she intended it. It is edited and produced by a dancer, so you are always getting the best possible camera angle of the movement you want to see.

All of the dancers in this DVD are talented and successful working professionals, but they have not been overexposed in the mainstream.  This DVD is a nice alternative to the mainstream stuff, where it seems like we just see the same dancers over and over again.",1184371200,10,587,4.528301886792453
