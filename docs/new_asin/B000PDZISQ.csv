2816287,5,B000PDZISQ,"Teaching simple messages at a gentle pace -- with vivid color, crisp sound and perfect focus and lighting -- the Baby Einstein DVDs just keep getting better. Assuming you're watching them with your child, and that you don't overdose him or her on video, they offer a fun and rewarding way to spend time together. This one, I think, is the best yet.

The 30-minute main feature consists of five brief lessons about five basic shapes -- circles, ovals, squares, rectangles and triangles. Each shape is explored using animation, photographs, video and puppets, which are all mixed together in a sweet, simple style that is never rushed but always interesting.

Here, for example, is what happens during the sequence on squares:

After a blue line draws itself into a square, the line transforms into a photo of a soda cracker, which itself is remade into part of a grid. Then a piece of bread becomes a yellow-lined square, which changes into a live-action waffle that's being chewed on by an infant. Next, a gentle video montage shows square glass windows, a little boy playing with a square toy, an overhead shot of two older kids playing checkers, toy blocks, a checkered flag blowing in the breeze, a mom tracing the edges of a box with her young daughter, kids peering out of the windows of a school bus, some square carpet remnants, a young girl playing with boxes, movers carrying cardboard boxes, Rhino the puppet drawing a square on a whiteboard, and finally a young girl jumping out of a box. The square segment concludes with Rhino doing some short, silly skits. Throughout it all, the audio is simply light music, accented by voices saying ""Square!"" every now and then.

(By the way, that's the first time I've ever written ""live-action waffle."")

The disc also has some good bonus features.

I especially liked the ""Discovery Cards"" feature, a collection of still-frame sequences that review the shapes in the main video and introduce stars, hearts, diamonds and crescents. Each shape is shown just by itself, then with its name underneath, then with a voice pronunciation of the name, and then as part of a photo which shows how the shape exists in real life.

Similar to the skits Jim Henson did with his Muppets back in the 1960s, three 45-second puppet shows present sock-puppet animals squeaking their way through brief encounters with an ""Enormous Egg,"" ""Nesting Box"" or ""House of Cards.""

Also included is a 90-second long ""Locate the Shape"" game, which presents still photos and asks viewers to find the shapes located within them, such as the rectangles that exist on the front of a house; a 3:30 ""Story Time,"" which encourages viewers to find the shapes within the illustrations of the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baby-Einstein-See-and-Spy-Shapes-Baby-Einstein-Books/dp/0786808098/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baby Einstein: See and Spy Shapes (Baby Einstein Books)</a>, a handy ""Toy Chest"" that identifies the colorful and creative toys used in the DVD; and a 3:30 Baby Einstein informercial.

The only downside: a commercial for ""Einstein Pals,"" a toddler series that premieres on DVD next year. The one-minute spot is teased before the main feature, then, if you wait long enough, plays automatically afterward.",1185321600,7,3284,5.181132075471698
2816288,5,B000PDZISQ,"I have both of the Baby Einstein shapes videos (Baby Newton - All About Shapes and Discovering Shapes - Circles, Squares, and More!).  Both of my sons LOVE the new video (Discovering Shapes - Circles, Squares, and More!).  Baby Newton has never kept their attention but they are eating up the new one.  The Baby Einstein group did a much better job with the new one.  I highly recommend Discovering Shapes - Circles, Squares, and More!!!!",1185235200,17,438,4.723684210526316
2816289,3,B000PDZISQ,"I have Baby Newton, which was the first Baby Einstein released after Disney bought out Julie Aigner-Clark.  It is all about shapes.  Isn't this redundant?  I'd hope to see more original ideas for dvds, as we love Baby Einstein.",1177804800,,227,4.769230769230769
2816298,5,B000PDZISQ,My daughter loved this. it helped her to lean many things. I think that many parents should use this DVD with their children. I love these movies.,1357084800,,146,4.444444444444445
2816299,5,B000PDZISQ,"My son loves all the baby Einstein series.  I found them engaging for him to learn simple concepts.  Now that he's two and a half, he's moved beyond them and doesn't enjoy them as much, but I still find him humming the tunes every now and then.",1356048000,,244,4.170212765957447
2816300,5,B000PDZISQ,"Just like all the other Baby Einstein DVDs, this is educational and keeps the child's interest with puppets, toys, and music.",1356048000,,125,5.0
2816301,5,B000PDZISQ,"I buy these DVD's for my grandson and me.  He's 20mths and he loves them.  He gets so excited, he actually screams with glee when they start playing.  That's the part I love.  He always learns something new each time he watches them.",1319155200,,233,4.348837209302325
2816302,5,B000PDZISQ,"I received the DVD quickly and it was in great condition - brand new.
Excellent product.  Excellent Seller.",1286755200,,107,4.944444444444445
2816303,5,B000PDZISQ,"Wonderful teaching tool!  This video keeps my daughter occupied while commuting to and from day care, and she learns at the same time.  She particularly enjoys the puppets, and often laughs at their antics.  I highly recommend it.",1284940800,,230,5.0
2816304,3,B000PDZISQ,"I know everyone raves about Baby Einstein, but I found it irritatingly quite. The speak practically whispers when she says the colors or shapes. I think it's more for parents then kids. If you kids is like mine and they have alot of energy They will be too board to learn anything. Which would be pointless?",1279843200,2,307,4.5
2816305,4,B000PDZISQ,"My son loves the Baby Einstein videos. His Great Grandma got him this DVD. I honestly wasn't sure if he would be into it. To me it seemed a little boring. He loves it though! It's not his absolute favorite, but it is up there - and does a great job at holding his attention. He has also become interested in shapes since watching this, and is now very into his shape sorter. Like all the Baby Einstein videos, I wouldn't say it makes your baby smarter, but it definitely sparks their interest in learning. It also helps if you watch the video with them to reinforce what they are watching :)",1279065600,,591,4.285714285714286
2816306,5,B000PDZISQ,This is by far the best Baby Einstein dvd there is in the collection. My two year old learned his shapes just after a few viewings of this dvd- very entertaining!,1277769600,,162,4.258064516129032
2816307,5,B000PDZISQ,We love this one-I really feel that it has helped my son with learning some of his shapes-have watched it over and over (and over),1274659200,,130,4.24
2816328,2,B000PDZISQ,"the video is hit or miss as to whether it will play.  Sometimes it will, and often times it won't.  It will more likely play on our computer, but that is not convenient for our children to sit around and watch.  Otherwise it's a great educational tool I wish we could view more often.  We love Baby Einstein.",1264809600,2,308,4.258620689655173
2816329,5,B000PDZISQ,"yet another genius item, my son is only 11 months old and sits down and watches these all the way through, yay, plus he's learning lots",1257984000,2,135,4.230769230769231
2816330,3,B000PDZISQ,"We like this video as with most Baby Einsteins, however, have a problem with the sound on our home stereo system.  The sound for music comes out load and clear but the speech for the shapes is very, very quiet.  When you want to learn the names, it creates a problem.",1253145600,2,267,4.215686274509804
2816331,5,B000PDZISQ,"We bought this DVD to expand our collection.  We have the Old MacDonald Baby Einstein DVD and our son loved it.  We liked the fact that these older DVD's teach the words as well as display them.  The Shapes DVD is a lot of repetition, but it shows the shapes by themselves as well as in context, i.e., eggs are ovals, balls are cirles.  I honestly use videos like this as a chance to get a shower and keep him occupied and happy.  Because he is learning the shapes, it gives me an opportunity to quiz him when we are playing, reading books, or at the grocery store.  The puppets are always a favorite and my son just laughs at the characters because they are so silly!",1249171200,3,668,4.2204724409448815
2816332,3,B000PDZISQ,"My daughter was not very interested after the first time; however, I know other kids who love this video.",1240876800,,105,4.578947368421052
2816333,5,B000PDZISQ,"My older child grew up with Baby Newton and enjoyed it, but my younger child loves Discovering Shapes. At 20 months, he loved and started recognizing the shapes as they came on the screen. At 22 months, he now likes to point out circles and ovals to me wherever we go. This is by far one of our family favorites.",1219881600,2,312,4.216666666666667
2816334,5,B000PDZISQ,"The whole Einstein series has been a wonderful addition to our household. This one has good puppets and music, and my toddler likes to point out the different shapes.  Another excellent movie!",1213920000,,192,5.0
2816335,5,B000PDZISQ,I have to admit I was skeptical that Baby Einstein had come out with a new shapes DVD but this is a much better shapes DVD than Baby Newton. My 1 year old had no interest in Baby Newton but loves Discovering Shapes. My 4 year old loves it too! Especially since he is the one who picked it out for his brother's first birthday present. I think the editing has definitely gotten better with time.,1188259200,6,394,4.197368421052632
2816336,1,B000PDZISQ,"This was Baby Newton minus the clown.  I felt cheated, the format was so similar even my son picked up on it.  No new material. He got bored after just a few minutes.  I love the movies, my cildren learn a lot from them, but I think the producers got lazy on this one.  (I have a two year old and six month old)  We love doing the discovery cards together and learning new words, as well as watching the extra puppet shows- again nothing new for him to learn- and there were only three extra puppet shows...

I haven't been inpressed with the comapny since Baby on the Go, and for the record- I have seen, and own EVERY einstein dvd!",1185408000,9,633,4.147540983606557

8190674,5,B000PDZISQ,"My b/g twin toddlers love Baby Einstein DVDs.  This one is just as great as the others.  just wish it were longer.  They seem to be only 20-30 minutes in length.  But it's still very much worth getting, esp if you can get it in used condition.  I haven't had any real problems with those I get in 'used' condition.",1375920000,,314,4.166666666666667
