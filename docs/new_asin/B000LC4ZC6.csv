Viewed from each character's eyes, we see the cynicism that cloaks their vulnerability, as each one looks at his/her life through flashbacks.

Mia Farrow and Dustin Hoffman portray the characters very well -- the four stars are due to the somewhat tired story of singles life in the sixties.",1229385600,10,619,5.943820224719101
2703898,4,B000LC4ZC6,"I watched this movie last spring and I thought it was okay. There are two things that really bother me about this movie: One, Mia Farrow spends almost the entire film wearing a dreaded baby doll dress (probably a more worse 60's fashion than the miniskirt) and then makes the cut more deeper by wearing heavy tights to match the color (it was brown). As that weren't enough Dustin Hoffman's character John discovers that Mary doesn't wear a bra; which means that she's a feminist. That raises the question: If Mary (Farrow) is a feminist then why is she wearing a baby doll ensemble?
  The second thing that bothers me is the film's rating. As you know when ""John and Mary"" was released in the fall of 1969 it was rated R, then when it was released on video in the 80's the MPAA changed it down to PG. Guess what this movie is rated now it's available on DVD? R again! (the MPAA has done another flip-flop as what they did to ""Targets"" for example) And you know why: It's because of a very tame scene that occurs in the first ten minutes in which the camera catches Mia Farrow's butt and the rest of her naked body. That raises the burning question: What had changed? I must admit this rating system is a joke. So much that I wrote a letter to the company's president Dan Glickman telling him this is got to stop and that this is a classic example of why America will never escape the shadow of the 60's. Above all, it is average and my mother actually liked it. Oh, did I forget to mention that I almost got myself a hard-on from the last scene in this movie in which Hoffman and Farrow strip nude and get into bed?",1223683200,5,1616,4.277777777777778
2703899,4,B000LC4ZC6,"This is a brilliant example of what life was like in late 1960s New York.  Coming right after their big hit films, Hoffman (MIDNIGHT COWBOY) and Farrow (ROSEMARY'S BABY) show a completely different, intimate side to their acting.  While the film is somewhat fragmented, stick with it: you will find ultimate satisfaction in the story of two rather confused people trying to be as ""urbanized"" as their surroundings.  One highlight is the ""egg scene,"" in which the two engage in a discussion of organic foods.  There are also many terrific appearances in character roles: Tyne Daly (CAGNEY AND LACEY) as one of Farrow's roommates and Marian Mercer (who had just won a Tony Award for PROMISES, PROMISES) as a self-absorbed fashion photographer stand out.  All in all, a really gratifying cinematic experience.",1175558400,31,806,5.075757575757576

Hot Toasty Rag, September 17, 2017

Mia Farrow and Dustin Hoffman play a young couple who have had a one-night stand. The entire movie takes place during the dreaded and infamous morning after, but many scenes are shown in flashback. While I usually criticize movies that rely on a nonlinear storyline and flashbacks, John Mortimers script made some very interesting choices. While Mia and Dustin talk over breakfast, the conversation triggers a memory in one of them and cues a flashback. Some might find this disjointed, but others might see the realism in it. Words trigger memories, and before we know it, were lost in another thought while real life continues.

I didn't end up liking John and Mary; in fact, I found it pretty unpleasant. Both characters, in the awkward light of day, struggle to get to know each other, and often speak internally as a reaction to what they're learning. Since Im a girl, Im a little biased to be on Mia Farrows side. Dustin Hoffmans internal monologues show that he isn't a nice person. He judges her, assumes her behavior, regrets her affection, and is disappointed when she doesnt immediately leave. Why is it entertaining to watch Mia try and get to know someone like that?",1505606400,,1238,4.780373831775701
8161238,3,B000LC4ZC6,Interesting look at a one night stand that turns into something that may be more permanent.  Only rated PG despite a shot of Farrow's nude rear.  Turn on the captions if you need help discerning spoken dialogue from thoughts.,1455494400,,225,4.743589743589744
8161239,3,B000LC4ZC6,"The characters in this movie have got it  made.  They're  young, attractive, have successful careers, and are financially well-off.  And they are horny and live in NYC!  So where's the drama?  Well, the Hoffman character is suspicious and wary of commitment.  The Farrow character has solid humanitarian instincts, but these may be sublimated neediness issues.  So what makes this better than your average soap opera?

The PROS:  Both actors are accomplished professionals who are capable of great acting.  And physically they have never looked more appealing.  And I love movies that showcase the greatest city in the world.

The CONS: The dialogue sometimes seems artificial. Better script and/or direction may have cured this.

My recommendation:  not a great flick, but worth watching just for the attractiveness of the leads.",1437696000,,830,5.325581395348837
8161240,5,B000LC4ZC6,very well made film that deals with insecurities of two people getting to know each other on all levels,1413676800,,103,4.473684210526316
8161241,5,B000LC4ZC6,"A great highly introspective piece with many layers. I've seen it several times now and each time another facet comes out.
It's a very subtle quiet film which I find engaging and refreshing considering this style of film making is hard to find these
days. You have to put your attention into which I prefer over the aggressive type of movie that comes out at you.
 The characters are very complex and the interaction between Hoffman and Farrow creates an interesting dynamic.
 I think it's one of the finest works for the both of them.",1410566400,3,535,4.621052631578947
8161242,3,B000LC4ZC6,"I found the movie just OK and the premise a good theme in the late 60's. Mia was at her best in my view and Dustin tried his part but due to the script and scene makeup, had a difficult time pulling it off. To be frank, I've enjoyed reruns of MTM show with her at a Singles Bar better than watching this movie. It was a nice one time event, but doubt I'll watch it again.",1399680000,,371,3.831168831168831
8161243,2,B000LC4ZC6,"I'm 68.  I was born and bred in Brooklyn and lived there till 1978 when I moved to Staten Island  ( A Mistake)
Considering the movie was copyrighted 1969 as a person of the times it's so bland with two actors that could have portrayed so much more of New Yorkers",1393718400,,262,4.117647058823529
8161244,3,B000LC4ZC6,Both in terms of the subject matter and the way flashbacks are used.  The actual dialogue is still too dull.  Both characters seem determined to hold on to each other yet not give away many personal thoughts or feelings.  John already seems far too clingy and possessive.  My guess is he gives Mary (a classic rebound from an adulterous affair) too many ultimatums and guilt trips not to see her girlfriends and she gets tired of him.,1371427200,,434,4.597402597402597
8161245,4,B000LC4ZC6,"Virtually every line is taken from other movies.  an lsd trip.

For example: ""The subway with booze""....... its taken from ""The Incident""..... find the others yourself.  its fun & a great idea.",1370390400,,193,4.96875
8161246,3,B000LC4ZC6,"While I tend to watch just about any movie made in the 60s if only for their refreshing aesthetic of open-mindededness and experimentation, something that has all but disappeared not only from movies, but from the majority of the culture as well, I found the romance in this film a bit hard to believe. Why are these two even attracted to each other? There's nary a tender moment between them, and the majority of what goes on inside their heads tends to disparagement and suspicion. If the film had stuck to its theme of casual sex, it might have worked better. As it is, Dustin Hoffman's character shows Mia Farrow the door at the end of the film, and then regrets his decision for reasons that are never made clear or even explained.  Lucky for him, I suppose, that Mia Farrow chooses to disregard his request--but again, also for reasons that never made clear.

One minor footnote: if I remember correctly, all of the flash forwards and flashbacks in the film portrayed events that actually occurred. So why then do we get a flash forward of Mia Farrow returning to her apartment the next day with her arms full of groceries? In terms of film continuity, this seems a bit of a gaff to me--unless it was the director's intention to mislead the viewer, a questionable aesthetic decision to say the least.

Neither Mr. Hoffman's nor Ms. Farrow's best work.",1364947200,,1357,4.645833333333333
