7689104,4,B01CRIWQ7M,"I never saw Demian Bichir in anything prior to The Bridge, which was great though sometimes uneven through no fault of the actors. Sadly The Bridge was cancelled too soon. At any rate, I started looking around for more of Bichir's work. Muerte En Buenos Aires/Death in Buenos Aires was available on demand with HBO, so I watched it.

What a great movie, and what a great time piece. You get the feeling for late 80s Buenos Aires (apparently, 80s nostalgia isn't just North American and British). But so many other small but interesting detailed indicators of class and politics are present in this film. The casual  corruption and offering of bribes. The requirement of expensive tailored suits to hob nob with the polo set. The hush money the wealthy will pay to keep things quiet. The low pay for cops, making them vulnerable to corruption. These details are universal across cultures, whether you watch it in Spanish with subtitles or in English -- and they weave a fabric of noir into most of the film. There are also lovely, dreamy, almost surrealist touches (or magical realism?) with symbolic weight.

But the centerpiece of the film is the slow burn development and almost paranoid coming undone of Bichir's character via his deepening, and initially unwilling, partnership with Chino Darin's character.  Monica Antonopoulos' character is the slightly  cliche-ish female outside observer who sees way more than she lets on, but wisely stays more detached.

The climactic moment is both hard earned for one character, and a casually brutal stepping stone for the other. I can't say more without revealing spoilers... so I'll just say that this film is suspenseful, engrossing, and well worth watching. I've seen it several times ""on demand"" since I discovered it, and now I'm buying it. I look forward to more from director Natalia Meta.",1464998400,5,1844,4.970779220779221

amazon provides no information to allow selection of languages i speak or opt in for subtitles, at least that i can find.  worse, every time i unwittingly select a language i cant speak, amazon sends me more just like it.  now i get all manner of films i cant enjoy and don't like.",1501200000,,378,4.357142857142857
