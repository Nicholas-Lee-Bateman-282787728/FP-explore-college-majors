2100138,5,B0002KPIRI,"I simply fell in love with this cartoon from the first time I saw it on TV. The animation art is bright and wonderful.  The story lines are bold and refreshing.  This is the first cartoon I have ever seen that addresses the very real issues that modern day children of all races face today.  I think the character of Virgil Hawkins is a great role model.  The cartoon is fun, lively and a joy to watch for the whole family.  I cannot wait for future volumes to be released.",1106611200,11,473,4.211111111111111
2100139,5,B0002KPIRI,"This is probably one of the best kids shows that has been aired in a very long time. The story is solid, the characters are interesting, likable, and unique, and it teaches morales to boot. It covered many issues in it's 4 years of airing, from racism (a rarity for childrens shows), to kids who turn to guns to solve their problems (where Richie gets shot in the knee cap. Trust me, parents, there has been far worse on childrens TV, and it's not graphic), to bullying and gang violence. If your looking for a TV show that tries to actually teach your kids something about life, Static Shock is the show to turn to. This DVD covers gang violence, but overall, doesn't exactly showcase the best in Statick when it comes to morale issues. Still, even so, the show is great, and is worth picking up for the super hero lover of the family.",1106438400,5,836,4.4
2100140,5,B0002KPIRI,"In a time when every major studio seems interested in avoiding the thoughtfulness needed to produce an entertaining cartoon with a black central character, Static Shock is a welcome breath of fresh air.  My kids love Static and Richie!  My sons  do identify with him as a ""Brown"" good guy, and my daughters love it even more when ""?Sherisse?"" is on the show.  I never mentioned the issue of race, to them, but they naturally gravitated to the show and its messages.

Thank you all who had a hand in bringing the show to us.",1106006400,7,523,4.463157894736842
2100141,4,B0002KPIRI,"Static is a great kid with ""normal"" kid problems.  I have to disagree with the other reviewer about the language and violence aspect.  I find it to be one of the few shows I allow my two boys to watch.  Static handles all his problems realistically and the bang babies are always defeated yet available to come back another day.  Lots of fun and action with a nice kid that all can look up to.",1105920000,3,393,4.2
2100142,5,B0002KPIRI,"Sometimes it is a little predictable, but sometimes they really surprise you! The only thing is, I think people would know Static was Virgil, because it is obviously him, his hair and the way he talks are so distinctive.",1104019200,,220,4.666666666666667
2100143,5,B0002KPIRI,"This is a great show.  Virgil is probably the firs black superhero for kids to look up too.  Also, it's nice to see a teen as a superhero.  The characters on the show, are very likeable, and the plots are very interesting.  This show is so good, it is enjoyable for adults to watch too.",1097539200,19,286,4.1454545454545455

2100190,3,B0002KPIRI,This was an excellent series. I really wanted to see it again. It was very frustrating for me when I couldn't see the second of the following chapters it brings because of scratches.,1340150400,,182,4.545454545454546
2100191,4,B0002KPIRI,Static Shock had 3 seasons these are the first 6 episodes. Unfortunatly there are no more made so the rest of season 1 & seasons 2 & 3 are unavailable. This in turn makes this a big tease.,1311379200,21,188,3.973684210526316
2100192,5,B0002KPIRI,"This DVD is not enough! I have patiently waited for WB to release the rest of the series on DVD, and even hoped (with all due respect to the late, great Mr. McDuffie) that they would release it after its creator passed away. Static Shock was a hugely successful television show and has many avid fans! I hope soon they change their mind and release the rest of the episodes.",1305244800,3,374,4.357142857142857

The individual seasons are a little high for me.  Hopefully, the price will come down and I will definitely buy.",1292889600,,193,4.361111111111111
2100204,4,B0002KPIRI,well......i like comics.....even though it is geared toward kids. this is a good modern day anime about the many struggles people (men and woman) face in the torture years of grade school all the way through high school. it's a good buy. i just hope the company decides to release the rest of the season's episodes.,1253145600,,315,4.642857142857143
2100205,5,B0002KPIRI,Will there ever be (or has their been) a boxed set of this outstanding series?,1245974400,,78,4.266666666666667
2100206,4,B0002KPIRI,"Static Shock has been something I've watched ever since Virgil Hawkins first began his transformation into the electric-powered superhero. The writers did a wonderful job of touching on subjects that many similarly styled shows avoid like the plague. It's often funny, and often touching.

Virgil is an character that everybody can relate too. And is one of my favorite African-American superhero styled characters. Richie, his sidekick styled best friend stays out of the real action much of the time, but still has great moments where he proves he's every bit as capable as Static. Another great thing about the show are the creative action sequences. Richie provides Static with many cool 'toys' to give his powers the extra boost, and Virgil himself takes use of whatever is around him at the time to come up with colorful, and well-paced action sequences.

The dynamics the character have, the family values the show teaches (but doesn't bash over your head) and the engaging storylines are all reasons why they should make more of these Dvd's. I'm so glad that the recent Disney XD channel has decided to re-air these, because perhaps then some more interest will be geared up into coming out with boxed sets!",1236729600,,1215,4.980295566502463
2100207,3,B0002KPIRI,"Being a fan of the Milestone Comic universe, Static Shock was one of my favorite shows. I taped every episode from season 1 to the finale in season four and i've been waiting for the DVD to come out since the show ended in 2004. But only six Episodes??? Come on WB. This show deserves the treatment you gave Justice Leauge, Batman Beyond and Batman: The Animated Series. As a part of the Timmverse, It belongs in the DC comics Classic collection with each individual season on two discs with all 13 episodes. That being said, I love this show and it's one of the best cartoons to come along in recent years.

Static Shock is about a Virgil Hawkins, a 14 year old kid who is in the vein of Spider-man. A good kid dealing with teenage problems, he's bullied by  F-Stop (Hotstreak).  A gang offers him protection and a gun and he heads to the big bang. Not willing to commit murder he throws the gun they give him into the river. Witnessing the big bang, virgil owartches as  police, throw tear gas into the crowd, that causes the teenagers to mutate. From this gas Virgil gains superpowers. He and his friend Ritchie develop a Static, a secret identity so he can use his powers. In his Static idetity he takes on F-stop and saves the day. That's the gist of the first episode. every episode after gets even better.

This show is is easier for younger kids to watch than Batman or justice league. The violence is toned down significantly, and It's more kid freindly in its writing and that's a good thing; not every superhero show need to be so serious. Remember superheroes are supposed to be FUN.

Static shoock the Show is Shawn james five star Essential Tv Show. This release on the other hand isn't. Wait for a Proper release on the DC Comics classic colection",1217980800,9,1762,4.456521739130435
2100208,3,B0002KPIRI,The reason I give this only three stars is because I am looking for the whole season. I am sure that it can be done with all the seasons out there from shows that was made way before Static came on the scene.,1200182400,,208,3.86046511627907
2100209,1,B0002KPIRI,"When I first watched this show it was very dull.  He can throw electricity... wow, big deal. Also they could've done a better job drawing Virgil's dreads... they're not dreads. Justice League is a much better show.  WB, you really disappointed me this time.",1123200000,2,257,4.818181818181818
2100210,4,B0002KPIRI,"Static/Virgil Hawkins really has to be the first African-American superhero that we've ever really had to look up to. I really like this show. It's creative and deals with important issues and politics, but in an easy format that kids can understand. The show even takes the leap into dealing with topics like racism and high school gun shooting. Virgil Hawkin has lost his mother because of gang violence and is now being raised by his dad and his older sister Sharon. His best friend is Richie Foley (who later on in the series, has a much more important role.)

My only complaint is that this DVD only contains the first six episodes of the series. I wish that it would had been the release of season one rather than just a few episodes. You can get so much more on one disk these days. I would love to see a completed set of all four seasons on DVD someday, or at least volume two for season one.",1116374400,46,900,4.357142857142857
2100211,3,B0002KPIRI,I have been following static shock on the WB since it started and watched all of the seasons as they unfolded.  With each season they made there was a different intro music track.  The music for the first season had always been my favorite and I was looking forward to hearing it when buying this DVD.  However I was very disappointed when I watched it to find out the intro music was changed completly to some techno track that does not flow well at all.  I have no idea why they changed the original music.  And to make it worse I was teased with snipids of the original music when the DVD main menu is playing.  Yes the episodes are still great but there are only 6.  Just thought I would warn anyone who cared about the season 1 theme song.,1109116800,41,744,4.23404255319149
