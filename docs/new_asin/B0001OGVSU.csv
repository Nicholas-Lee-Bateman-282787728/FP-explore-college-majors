A must have for Stooge fans.
Great Product - Great Service",1475193600,,201,4.611111111111111
8015734,3,B0001OGVSU,"Theres a lot of cool footage,and the Three Stooges story was interesting, but it just wasn't what I thought it would be. It is about 9 hours of Three Stooges stuff,like a big compilation of scenes. I was hoping for a few whole Three Stooges episodes,but this didn't have any. It was kinda sad watching the more modern clips(in color)where the guys are obviously elderly & trying to do the same mindless violence as they had for so many years,but just couldn't pull it off like before. Its a cool collection of clips,stories & a few movies,but still wasn't what I thought it would be.",1332460800,,583,4.561904761904762
8015735,1,B0001OGVSU,"The one movie I managed to look at was totally lame, as the Stooges were in it for less than a few minutes.  Disappointed.",1293667200,2,122,4.083333333333333
8015736,1,B0001OGVSU,"Eight hours and only ONE short with Curly in it? You read me right. The rest of the two DVDs consists of a rather awful movie musical in which the Stooges played a minor role, a bunch of unfunny skits with Curly Joe (arguably the least funny of the post-Curly Stooges), some of their terrible TV cartoons, three pretty good Shemp shorts, a pretty good biography of the Stooges, and some terrible TV skits. If I left out anything, I'm sure it was as lousy as the rest of the junk on these two DVDs.

This is one of the worst wastes of money I have ever found on DVD. I'd like to rate it about negative 20 stars.",1154822400,10,610,4.126050420168068
