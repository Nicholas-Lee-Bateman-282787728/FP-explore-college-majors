8599159,2,B00DYEBLPC,"The DVD set is a very funny animated series.  It's kid friendly, and there are some jokes and quirks that adults will enjoy.  Overall, I enjoy this fun Super Evil series.

The reason why I only gave it 2 stars is that the DVD case was destroyed in the transport process.  Nice hole right through the front of case with artwork damage.  Amazon and thier suppliers have got to learn to ship DVDs and Blu's with better packaging.",1473379200,,426,4.410256410256411
8599160,5,B00DYEBLPC,"I discovered this cartoon when I was flipping through the channels at home. It is funny as all get-out! It's not too complicated, but it's ivery twisted. It reminded me of a ""super villan"" version of Invader Zim. The characters are really fun, each one has his own thing, and together, it's hard to imagine they could be very successful. Of course, they're not really. Still, it's a fun watch!",1400716800,2,393,4.628571428571429
