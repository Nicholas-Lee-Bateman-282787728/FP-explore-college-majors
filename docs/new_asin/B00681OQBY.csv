Keeps me entertained so it doesn't always feel like I'm working out but kicks my butt at the same time :-) I also enjoy that they don't talk down to me like some workout DVDs I have. They encourage you without demeaning you and make sure you know you can take it at your level or bring it up a notch too. The classes in person are awesome too, happy they are in my area!",1474848000,,433,4.08235294117647

8494501,5,B00681OQBY,"What can I say about this DVD other than awesome!!!!! I love this DVD!!!! The workout is awesome!!! The music is awesome!!! and the instructors are awesome!!! They alternate between cardio boxing and dancing, plus they have body toning. If you choose not to do the whole DVD, you have the option to do whatever session you want to. What else can you ask for? Well, ZEN is something to ask for!!! I really love the ZEN part of the DVD! It is sooo relaxing!! You will be amazed by how different you feel doing ZEN after the workout!! I play the ZEN part alone at least twice daily. It really helps to release the stress of a hard work day. I highly recommend this DVD to everybody at every age and fitness level. You will have a guaranteed great workout that is alot of fun.",1356825600,,772,4.294520547945205

BUY IT and ENJOY :),1325808000,4,371,4.027027027027027
8494503,5,B00681OQBY,"My only complaint about this workout is that it's not long enough!  I want more!

I LOVE this DVD!  It's a great workout and you will absolutely break a sweat (which is the whole point, right?) but anyone can do it.  Work at your own pace and stick it out.  It's very easy to follow for the most part.  I got messed up at a couple spots the first time through it but I'm confident it's ""user error"" and I'll pick it up after a couple of times.  That's the great thing about it...you don't have to be all that coordinated and they give you prompts on what's coming next so you're ready.  The boxing is my favorite part but it meshes so well with the dance, toning and ZEN that you won't be disappointed.  The ladies keep it fresh and entertaining so you almost forget how hard you're working and you'll be surprised how quick the time flies by.  I was so engaged the first time I did it, that I actually clapped at the end of the first two song as if I was in class and the ladies were right there in my family room with me.  Then I realized I was alone and felt a little stupid.  LOL

**Highlights**
It's broken down into sections so it's not overwhelming for the newbie.
Plenty of prompts to let you know what's coming next.
They always give safety tips like not letting your knee go past your toes.
Unbelievable that half of the hosts are 50 years old!  Good luck guessing which ones.
Easy to follow.
Completely engaging!
Filmed in HD
Upbeat, fun music.

I started doing Z-Box classes back in February so I have a little experience but I'm certainly no expert.  I can now say... I'm a Zen Boxer!!!  I know I won't be a size 6 but I have dropped one size in my jeans and I'm about to try the next smaller size.  I'm so proud of myself for sticking it out and working hard.  Thanks to Debbie, Donna and Laura (3 of our hosts on the DVD) for bringing fitness into my life.",1322611200,3,1871,4.161559888579387
