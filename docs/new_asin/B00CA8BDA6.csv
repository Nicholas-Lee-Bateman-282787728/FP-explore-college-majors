5709276,1,B00CA8BDA6,"I have many wild life movies. This is absolutely the worst. 75 % of movie is not about animals. Only water, land and all very boring. Director can film same location (like a tree), nothing interesting for 5 minutes from every possible angle. I don't care if this movie will cost 5 dollars. Don't buy it!",1387929600,8,303,4.428571428571429
5709277,2,B00CA8BDA6,It ws Ok. I feel bad for the way the locals have decimated part of the islands forest for rice growing and you can already see thelack of vegetation affecting the water ways and rivers. The few good parts of the island are nice but you can definitely see the damage man has made.,1387584000,3,279,4.185185185185185
8579127,2,B00CA8BDA6,"Really boring. Wow. I thought there would be a lot of animals and lemurs, it took a good 15 minutes to get to a gecko. If you have insomnia, this one is for you.  The packaging was fine and it played well.",1456012800,,205,3.880952380952381

8579133,1,B00CA8BDA6,Beautiful pictures of PLANTS. I own 2 lemurs and wanted something that showed them in their natural habitat.....it delivered for 5 min. the rest is just landscape. In 2d even my lemurs were bored as soon as their kin were off the screen. They are more interested in NatGeo wild & Discovery Channel. This is a BIG waste.,1413072000,,319,4.517241379310345

8579135,1,B00CA8BDA6,"I could not believe there is no animals other than plants and a few birds in Madagascar , I was very disappointed",1393113600,6,113,4.181818181818182
8579136,1,B00CA8BDA6,"I am  the owner of a new 3D TV, and I bought a selection of 3D dvd's to form an initial opinion as to whether 3D is just a fad (as it was in the 1950s), or the image of the future in home video viewing. The votes are not all in for me, but I'm very glad this was not the first 3D film I purchased.

Its just awful in every respect that matters to me:

1) The 3D effect is a joke:  Shooting a scene from behind a bush to give a 3D effect to a wide vista shot (of a valley for example), is not really 3D, and that's how many of the scenes are filmed. (When you come across one of the film's few true 3D scenes, you'll see a striking difference).

2) Madagascar is an island of great beauty and diversity. This film provides no real educational value in terms of providing at least a minimal view of the varying areas (from rain forests to desert-like conditions), nor of the diversity of animal and plant life (even the lemurs get only passing mention).

3) The narration is sometimes out-of-sync with the image on screen. It seems as though the video was re-edited, but the original audio was unchanged.

Bottom line, it seems this dvd was slapped together haphazardly to take advantage of the interest in 3D. The manufacturer/producer 3D-MEDIA.tv should be ashamed, and gathering from reviews of other 3D products they've produced, the quality of this dvd is not an anomaly.

For those who want to learn about Madagascar, and see some high-quality video content, I highly recommend the BBC 2-disc Blu-ray version.  It's not 3D, but there's no comparison.",1389571200,6,1554,4.424561403508772
