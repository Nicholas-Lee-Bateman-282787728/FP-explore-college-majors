3896195,5,B002BW7A44,"After Keane's first two albums, they were on a way to be one of the greatest bands ever ... They seemed to have appeal to wide variety of the audiences. They were new, they sounded fresh and MUSIC was definitely great. They had classic pop songs, with amazing melodies and incredible Tom Chaplin's vocals. What more can you ask for from a new band? They really were brilliant. I saw one of their concerts during this tour in 2007 and I became fan for life. This DVD is a concert from that tour I saw and it's really amazing. Music, set-list, performance, audience ... The whole tone is a real treat. I got this DVD the day it came out in Canada and I played it over and over ... Somehow everything seemed to be amplified from what I saw in concert. Highlights from this DVD would be ""Everybody's Changing"" - any-time favorite song to hear, ""Nothing In My Way"" - this one feels like it was written about me and it is my #1 personal favorite song by the band. ""Bad Dream"" and poem before the actual song was performed was real treat. Ultimate high as far as vocals is ""The Frog Prince"" - this could be acoustic or accapella, either way sounds amazing. ""Bedshaped"" was final song and seems like band's favorite - live sounds just great. It's been over 5 years since this DVD's release and I still gladly watch it from time to time. Great job Keane and keep up!",1361491200,,1357,4.346456692913386

I'm utterly gutted as one cannot return purchases once they are opened. From what planet is that? Are we a magician or something that we can conclude whether purchases will work or not without opening?!!!!",1352678400,,260,4.553191489361702

8362166,5,B002BW7A44,"DVD quality is not the greatest.  Would have purchased in Blu-Ray except it would not play with North America Blu-ray players.

As far as the concert, I enjoyed every single minute of it.  They basically played their entire first and second albums.  In my opinion , their first and second albums are their best work.  If you are a Keane fan, you will not be disappointed.",1400976000,3,371,4.5606060606060606
