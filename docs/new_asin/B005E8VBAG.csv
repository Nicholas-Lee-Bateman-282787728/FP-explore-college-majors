8468092,5,B005E8VBAG,"The production I didn't want to like. I dislike modernized productions. But I like Roberto Alagna. So I decided to give this DVD a try in spite of the rather hefty price tag.  Roberto Alagna, Marina Poplavskaya, Beatrice Uria-Monzon are hot hot hot. This Carmen perfectly hits the gypsy theme as a way of life rather than just some sleazy seductress. This Carmen is troubled, intense, manipulative and totally believable as ""damaged"".

Alagna plays his part brilliantly. He is seduced and naive. He is angry and frustrated. He has that ""I can fix her"" syndrome. Poplavskaya is always a pleasure in my book---and this role, while a small part, suits her. She is very naive and lost in the shuffle of the military and the gypsies...perfect.

Some of this is even a little disturbing as the gypsies put a little lipstick on a very young girl. Brilliant.

In all, this is a fantastic production. I worried about having these artists jumping over cars while they sing---man, that's asking a lot.

If it's in the budget, go for it. Here's a Carmen that goes well beyond the usual and somewhat boring Carmen productions. Smashing.",1483488000,,1123,4.7979274611398965
8468093,1,B005E8VBAG,"This is a review of the Liceu's Carmen.  I saw it as a live broadcast in cinema - a waste of time and money.  A stellar lineup of singers was cast in excessively vulgar, violent and barren settings.  After a neurotic-looking Carmen stepped out of a phone booth to sing the Habanera, the staging did not get better. It continued to pointless shockers (oral sex in the gypsy camp, simulated sex and other naked actions which were not even consistent with the plot, and finally her throat being slit). It was hard to imagine why Don Jose fell for Carmen. Musically, the performance was excellent - listen to it with your eyes closed.
I have every Carmen DVD save for this one. Of the recent releases I liked the MET's version with Garanca and Alagna and the Royal Opera's Carmen with Antonacci and Kaufmann.",1463270400,2,804,4.569444444444445

8468095,5,B005E8VBAG,"Carmen is Carmen, as far as I'm concerned, and personally, it's not an opera I would go out of my way to see again.  Fantastic opera, brilliantly scored in a way that is full of life and passion, consummately operatic, but done to death, to the extent that it's almost become a clich, removed and detached from whatever real human emotions used to underlie it.  Consequently, until the recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bizet-Carmen-in-3D/dp/B005LVEFQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bizet: Carmen in 3D</a>&nbsp;production from the Royal Opera House, I hadn't seen or really listened to the opera in about ten years, and Francesca Zambello's conventional and unimaginative staging for that production reminded me why.  The production itself wasn't bad, but there was just nothing new in it.

From the standpoint of the casting alone however, there's plenty of good reasons to like this production, which has the right kind of blend that is needed in terms of experience for the two principal roles and up-and-coming young singers for the supporting roles.  With Roberto Alagna and mezzo-soprano Beatrice Uria-Monzon, both native French, the roles of Don Jos and Carmen are not just in reliable hands, but both invest a great deal into the interpretation, singing wonderfully and maintaining a strong presence on the stage.  Erwin Schrott is a good Escamillo, again another fine actor willing to push interpretation as well as possessing a fine baritone voice - but this is a minor role for his talent.  Marina Poplovskaya finds the right blend of freshness, innocence and purity that the opera needs as Michala.

As good as each of the cast are in their own right, the famous arias as good here as any interpretations I've heard - Alagna's 'La fleur que tu m'avais jete' is terrific - they work wonderfully together and it's the duets and ensembles that make the biggest impression, presenting a refreshing new perspective on the opera.  The orchestra and the performance are also superb.  It's everything you expect Carmen to be, but with enough character, verve and energy of its own, and a willingness to explore the dynamic that make this something more vibrant and alive, (the HD sound reproduction on the Blu-ray is also outstanding), the music seeming once again to be organically part of the drama rather than illustrating a bunch of clichd routines.  It's a long time since I've heard this particular opera sounding so fresh.

How much of this is down to the stage production is debatable.  Other than modernising the period setting however, the essence of the drama isn't touched or played around with, the emphasis shifted slightly perhaps to emphasise the masculine aspect of the opera and the culture of machismo (although a full-frontal naked bullfighter might be too much for the more sensitive traditionalist).  Even if it were just for the fact of stripping away all those old routines and hackneyed gypsy imagery, Calixto Bieto's production, often minimal, the stage permanently giving the impression of a bullring, at least forces the viewer to focus once again on the characters and how they express themselves through Bizet's score and the libretto, and that alone is a bit of a revelation.  Yes, everyone knows that Carmen is all about jealousy, lust and Latin passions, but removing the set-pieces goes some way towards restoring the balance of the other more noble aspects the theme of love beyond all reason (""Love is a gypsy child who knows nothing of the law"") in the unconditional familial love on the part of Don Jos's mother and also in the purity of Michala's love for him.  Whether it's obvious or not (and all the better if it's not), I'd say that the production and direction is certainly instrumental in achieving this.  This is a great Carmen.",1317945600,16,3824,5.132045088566827
