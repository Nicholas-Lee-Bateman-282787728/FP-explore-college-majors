8060860,5,B0009HLCHO,"I have seen this movie 40 years ago in Armenia, former Soviet Union. There were no DVDs, or video tapes then, movie theaters were the only place to enjoy it.  When I recently came across the DVD, I wanted to own a copy. It is one of the best among Russian cinema classics dubbed in three languages; Russian, English and French including optional subtitles. It is a comedy, action, drama. It depicts the aftermath of Russian revolution, great story, great gypsy music and tap-dancing (my favorite).

The quality is good, and the English version is pretty good. It is not one of those 'two actors translate all' movies. The voices are carefully picked for dubbing accuracy.",1289779200,2,671,4.775862068965517
