3804153,5,B001US3Y5O,"My son loves these cartoons so its great for him. I think they're annoying though. Shhhh don't tell him I said that. So if you're a little boy or buying for a little boy, great buy! If you're a grown woman who is not interested in Mario, maybe not so great buy. lol Delivery was great though and dvd had no damage or anything.",1411430400,,326,4.109375

Five stars for this item (I just wish my 17 month old were into it!).",1389139200,,112,3.9130434782608696
3804155,5,B001US3Y5O,My son loves it - good for the price. Watches in car all the time. No negatives. I bought 2-3 different types from the same seller - all are good.,1358899200,,146,3.9
3804156,5,B001US3Y5O,I was satisfied with my order as the movies were reasonably priced and I received the order in advance of the expected arrival.,1319500800,,127,4.565217391304348
3804157,3,B001US3Y5O,this was a good movie. my 6 year old watched it but did not hold his attenton like other mario movies he has had in the past but the 3 year old loved it and it has a better story line than most mario movies,1313452800,,206,3.6
3804158,2,B001US3Y5O,"I purchased this item for my little 4 yr old nephew who adores mario bros. and although he loved it, i was disappointed at how old this movie was! the release date for this dvd says june1, 2010. Well it's NOT! it's actually from 1991 so when i got it in the mail, i was a bit hesitant to give it to my nephew but did anyway. although he loved it yeah i would have not bought it if i knew how old it was, it was extremely outdated. :(",1306108800,,433,3.8222222222222224
3804159,4,B001US3Y5O,"My nephew is a huge Super Mario Brothers fan.  I bought him this for his birthday.  He loves it!  In fact he took it to his pre-school and all the other kids loved it. Imagine a group of 3-5 year olds quiet and glued to a TV. It makes me want to crawl out of my skin.  The best part is when he took it home to watch it over and over and over....

My advice is if you're an uncle or an aunt of a kid that enjoys Super Mario Brothers, buy this DVD and force your sibling to suffer!",1301443200,6,479,3.702970297029703
3804160,4,B001US3Y5O,"So this ""movie"" is a B-rated as they come- meaning extremely low budget and cheesy.  It's 75 minutes- but broken down into short episodes.  But I ranked it 4 stars because my kids LOVED it.  They quieted down and sat still for 75 minutes (all episodes).  For my son's Mario-themed birthday party, we had 16 children ages 6 and under and twice when I turned on the movie, at least 14 of them came in the living room quietly sitting on the couch while I prepped for the next birthday event.  That being said- I just can't bring myself to give it 5 stars.",1281225600,4,552,4.269230769230769

8344988,5,B001US3Y5O,"If your child loves the Mario series, this DVD is wonderful. My five year old and my seven year old love Mario everything - movies, plush toys, etc. This DVD is one of many they love to watch - they watch them over and over.

8344990,5,B001US3Y5O,I bought this for my nephew and all I had to do was show him the cover and he was very excited to have it so that makes me happy. I have never know there was any Super Mario shows since I never saw it on Tv or the internet so I'm very glad I was able to get my almost 6 year old nephew something he will enjoy since he's going through a faze of loving Mario. I just might have to buy another one for my kids since they also are really into Mario.,1450828800,,446,3.65625
