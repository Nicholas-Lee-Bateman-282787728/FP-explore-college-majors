7895790,5,6305817766,"I just purchased a new T.V. to replace the one I have had for well over 15 years and while I morn the loss, it did give me the opportunity to clean out the T.V. stand place where I have a couple hundred VHS tapes stored; some of which I have not watched for quite some time.  What a mess!  Anyway, in digging through these I ran across this old friend; a tape which was and is one of my favorites and one which I sat and watched many times with my grandsons when they were little.

This collection runs for 75 minutes and in a compilation of various episodes.  I hate to do this, but since they have not given you the information in a product description here, I am going to copy the description from the back of the box this is in.  It does a far better job that I could do and is actually quite accurate.

""Here's what you've been waiting for.  More of the best footage of the Our Gang comedy crowd including rare, original ""lost episodes""...some never seen on T.V!  You'll see the kids follies with Darla's delightful song and dance routines.  The Squeaky-voiced Alfalfa signing a contract to sing in 20 years!  Rarely seen footage from color films produced by Hal Roach in the late 1940's when he formed a new bunch of Our Gang kids.  The uncut version of the classic, classroom history quiz in which the kids think they've gotten a copy of the right answers, but to their surprise (and the lovely Miss Crabtree's) the answers came from a joke book!  There's seldom seen news footage of Pete the Pup making a personal appearance. Shirley Temple in a rival studio's ""rip off"" version of the comedies after being turned down for Our Gang.  The kids creating chaos in the courtroom.  And plenty of crazy contraptions at the carnival.  In addition, you'll enjoy the extremely rare early version of Our Gang featuring a very young Farina, who continued with the cast the longest.  Before other greats like Spanky and Buckwheat, there were the talents of Mickey Daniels (a main figure in the silent movie days).  Joe Cobb (who was replaced by Chubby).  Mary Korman, Jackie Condon and Johnny Downs, plus Sunshine Sammy Morrision (who later became Scruno of the East Side Kids fame).  You'll love them all plus your other Our Gang favorites as they go nuts in your VCR.""

Actually, that pretty well sums it up and this film collection is actually better than the hype I actually copied here...go figure.

This film is in both color and black and white and is an excellent addition to any video collection. This is one I will eventually have transferred to CD format.  The quality of this tape is actually quite good as is the sound...all things considered. (Hey, if you remember, even the original sound quality was not all the good to begin with).

7895791,5,6305817766,"This is one of the best of Goodtimes Video's Our Gang Rascals compilations. Chock full of good and rare footage. It includes three silent episodes, Shivering Spooks (1926) about the Gang's intrusion on a crooked fortune-teller, Giants Vs. Yanks (1923), a real howler about the Gang destroying the home of a young couple after a baseball game, and Carnival Time (actually edited from Boys Will Be Joys, 1925) which explains itself.
The other footage includes the classic oral exam from ""School's Out' (1930) (Miss Crabtree-""What did Paul Revere say when he rode his horse? Buddy O' Donald-""He said WHOA!""). A Shirley Temple Gang-imitation episode from 1933, and some excerpts from later attempts at Rascal copycats.
Overall, great stuff. Needs to be on DVD, though.",1078704000,2,764,5.169354838709677
