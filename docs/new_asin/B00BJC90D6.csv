5634966,5,B00BJC90D6,"First, Thank You to Amazon Special Products for making the 1982 British television ""Witness For the Prosecution"" available on a beautiful dvd. ""Avanti"" has been paired with several other films, but I care not a wit about It -- someone at Amazon thought to make available a DVD-R ""on demand"" of the otherwise impossible to find ""Witness.""

Second, every praise heaped on Billy Wilder's b/w classic with Charles Laughton, Marlene Dietrich and Tyrone Power is completely deserved. It is a film any lover of murder mystery must own and cherish. I know and love every line uttered by every character, as if there is no other possible interpretation possible. Yet when the film came out with my favorite actor, Laughton, in the award-winning stage role of Sir Wilfrid, I was strangely let down. I had seen it on stage with Francis Sullivan and Patricia Jessel on Broadway, one of the great theater triumphs of the 20th Century. I had also seen Basil Rathbone in the role on tour. I could not imagine anyone but Sullivan and Jessel in the two key roles.

And then Billy Wilder completely rewrote the play into the 1957 film we all love, and for which Laughton and Dietrich DID deserve Academy Awards. Laughton lost, but Dietrich was not even nominated, something which hurt her very deeply. And so year in year out if I wanted to watch this play or film, I watched Laughton ad Dietrich, However, in 1982 Sir Ralph Richardson and Dame Diana Rigg with an absolutely outstanding cast performed this cut-back version of Wilder's rewrite, leaving in Miss Plimpsol played by Dame Deborah Kerr, cutting out the Leonard Vole backstory which would only have dumped more Beau Bridges on us, and supported by the likes of Dame Wendy Hiller and the great Donald Pleasance in one of his greatest performances. Alas, Beau Bridges in the pivotal role of Leonard Vole is offensively horrible. So much in this play or film depends on an absolutely flawless cast, that Bridges almost ruins much of what his fellow cast members are seeking to achieve,

I've had a chance now to see this version a dozen times, which is 3 dozen fewer than I've watched Laughton and Dietrich. Sir Ralph is after all the first of the great stage and film giants to be knighted, before Olivier or Gielgud. Dame Diana is one of the most acclaimed actress of her time and generation, as was Dame Wendy. Add the wonderful performances of Donald Pleasance and Michael Gough, and television in Britain got a real gem. There is no question that Richardson's performance is extraordinarily nuanced, voiced inimitably, and intimate -- extremely intimate. Reviewers seem to rave about Rigg, who is outstanding; but she is not in the same class as Marlene Dietrich in this role, or Jessel if you could have seen her pull this coup de theatre on stage (!), just as her Mrs. Danvers could not begin to match Dame Judith Anderson in Rebecca.

I mention these different actors and productions to bring home the point that each has its strengths and weaknesses, that these roles can be interpreted very differently. As funny as we now think Laughton was in the role of Sir Wilfrid, Francis Sullivan was 3ce as funny, hammy and outrageous. Please do give this one a chance. And please buy it, to support the Amazon ""made to order"" disks.",1374192000,3,3274,4.748681898066784
5634967,3,B00BJC90D6,"The movie, Avanti!, promotes adultery as easy as buying an ice cream cone.  By the time the movie showed very clear rear-end nudity by both, we could not watch any more, having been sickened already by the pro-adultery dialogue.  We are selling the set mainly due to this offensive material.

The other movie, Witness for the Prosecution, we already own in the 1957 version which is more classical than this 1982 version, although the actors/actresses in the 1982 Hallmark version are extraordinarily good.  A worthwhile re-make that copies much of the 1957 version, but is quite a bit shorter and leaves out several scenes that take's one back in time and gives a completely different reason for the first meeting of the young man and the widow.  It is almost impossible to find this Hallmark version on DVD other than here.",1366848000,,825,4.822695035460993

5634989,4,B00BJC90D6,"I loved it anyway.  Avanti was what I really wanted and it was all that I expected; a wonderful off-beat love story.  However, I was under the impression that I was buying 2 movies where Billy Wilder & Jack Lemmon teamed up for their one-of-a-kind magic and that was not to be.  Witness for the Prosecution had nothing to do with either of those men (other than it was a re-make of Billy Wilder's screen play from '57), but much to my surprise, I really liked it.  Normally I don't care for re-makes, but this one was quite good.  My being quite enamored by Diana Rigg may have been skewing my judgement, but whatever it was, I enjoyed it.",1398470400,,639,4.336134453781512
5634990,3,B00BJC90D6,"The original ""Witness for the Prosecution,"" starring Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester, was wonderful.... not flawless but fun and engaging and delightful.  This version was unfortunately dull by comparison. I couldn't finish watching it.  Maybe if I hadn't seen the original and fallen in love with it, I wouldn't have been so disappointed by this lackluster copy.",1396915200,,368,5.43859649122807
5634991,5,B00BJC90D6,"This originally appeared as a Hallmark Hall of Fame production but never made it to video.  The 1957 version has a lot to recommend but did feature Tyrone Power who was not very good.  In this remake Ralph Richardson and Deborah Kerr don't chew the scenery like Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester. This version includes a fine performance by Wendy Hiller as well.  But the star of the show is Dame Diana Rigg who is cold, calculating and absolutely wonderful.  Throughout you hate her.  For those who don't know how it all ends up I won't say. In the final scenes she is fabulous. Go out and buy this one. I am forever greatful to whomever was responsible for getting this out on dvd. Now, how about those Glenda Jackson movies, TURTLE DIARY,
STEVIE and HEDDA?",1394496000,,762,4.573529411764706

5634994,3,B00BJC90D6,"I bought this DVD to compare it to the 1957 original with Tyrone Power, Marlene Dietrich and Charles Laughton. Perhaps it is unfair to compare this later version with Beau Bridges to the original version, but I prefer the acting in the original version.",1390262400,,253,4.7727272727272725
5634995,5,B00BJC90D6,"I've been waiting for years, decades to own Witness for the Prosecution on DVD.  It has a terrific cast and the twist ending really surprised me.",1390089600,5,145,4.576923076923077
5634996,5,B00BJC90D6,"This is an excellent version of Agatha Christie's play of 'Witness for the Prosecution'.  It has a top cast of Britain's finest, including Sir Ralph Richardson, Diana Rigg, Deborah Kerr, Wendy Hiller, Donald Pleasence and many others.  Beau Bridges plays the accused and is adequate in the role although he is inclined to be a bit wooden at times.

I prefer this version to the Charles Laughton/Marlene Dietrich version, mainly because of Diana Rigg's appearance as the Witness.  As a classically trained actress she is much more believable than Marlene Dietrich whose German accent was a bit of a handicap during certain scenes of this classic play.  Sir Ralph Richardson as Sir Wilfred Robarts is excellent and his scenes with Deborah Kerr provided entertaining light relief.  Wendy Hiller's part was a small one, but this fine actress was superb in it.

All in all a most welcome addition to the Christie canon on DVD.  The transfer to DVD is very good indeed and it is surprising that it has taken so long for this film to receive a DVD release.

Most highly recommended.",1379203200,7,1075,4.830601092896175
5634997,5,B00BJC90D6,Avanti is a 1972 Wilder comedy romance about a man going to Italy to collect the body of his father who died in a motor accident with his long term mistress. The second movie in the set is the 1982 Hallmark remake of Wilder's 1957 mystery based on the play by Agatha Christie. This is a very effective film with a great cast and capable direction.,1378339200,,347,4.2727272727272725
8569509,2,B00BJC90D6,"First, this is NOT a Jack Lemmon Double Feature.  This mistake alone should put the DVD in a lower price range, $7-10.

Now for the movie reviews.  Although the British actors are spot on in this production of Witness for the Prosecution, it doesn't compare to the older version.  Beau Bridges tends to overact a bit in this one and I'm not convinced with Diana Rigg's German accent.

As for Avanti, it was dated and very slow.  It was crazy to hear a perfectly average Juliet Mills repeatedly called names such as fat-ass, piglet, etc.  It gets a two star review only for Witness for the Prosecution.",1493769600,,601,4.5607476635514015
8569510,5,B00BJC90D6,"Witness for the Prosecution: Most people are familiar with the outstanding 1957 movie with Tyronne Power, Marlene Dietrich, and Charles Laughton.  This is the 1982 Hallmark Hall of Fame version starring Ralph Richardson, Diana Rigg, and Beau Bridges. I'd say the Hallmark presentation equals the 1957 version. Powerful acting on all parts. Worth the buy.",1491177600,2,354,5.4363636363636365

8569516,4,B00BJC90D6,"I'm unsure how this can be called a ""Jack Lemmon Double Feature"" as the box is labeled.  Lemmon does star in AVANTI!, and it's a perfectly entertaining comedy, well worth watching.  WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION is a TV remake of the great Billy Wilder classic. Lemmon had nothing to do with either version.  WITNESS is a competent remake, well cast with starry names, but it's pretty weak tea compared with the original.  Only Diana Rigg musters a performance of comparable impact to her predecessor (Marlene Dietrich).  Deborah Kerr hasn't much to do, but she's simply not as much fun as Elsa Lanchester.  Beau Bridges looks much younger than Tyrone Power did, but he's not as engaging, and Ralph Richardson, fine actor though he is, doesn't come within hailing distance of Charles Laughton's magnificent performance.  Still, this version is a bit closer to Christie's original play, and I'm glad that it's available and happy to have seen it.  But Wilder's original version remains one of the greatest movies of the courtroom genre, and it's unmissable.",1440806400,,1054,5.017241379310345
