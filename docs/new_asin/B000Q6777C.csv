2830219,1,B000Q6777C,"Oh my God - this is just AWFUL.  Don't even bother.  The men are blah, the acting is double blah and the story is...well I don't really know because it is so crappy.  Don't believe the blurb in the product info.  There are no fascinating men or colourful people - mostly ugly and not sexy doesn't count does it?  Too bad to give any more detail.  HATED it, rated it as low as I could go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1201478400,5,404,4.25
2830220,1,B000Q6777C,"We rented this movie, thank god.  We had to shut it off after 20 minutes because it was THAT bad.  It came off as a bunch of friends who drunkenly decided to ad lib their way through inside jokes and every desperate cliche they could muster.  I find it implausible that anyone who wasn't in the cast, on the crew, or related to someone who was involved would give this dreck more than one star.  There was absolutely nothing redeeming about it.",1199404800,,444,4.378048780487805
2830221,1,B000Q6777C,This had to be the worst movie ever made...I have seen better acting in a high school play...no story to find...no cute guys what so ever...odd film quality...the only good thing about this movie was my fast forward button on my remote...these reviewers must have been part of the production staff trying to unload copies of this waste (DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE),1186704000,7,359,4.714285714285714
2830222,3,B000Q6777C,Just a note to say the DVD runs around 70 minutes not 90 as mentioned on Amazon and also the cover of the DVD. Funny that the people issuing a product are so sloppy as to not know how long it is or is this just misrepresentation? Perhaps it has been slashed.,1186444800,3,258,3.980769230769231
2830223,5,B000Q6777C,This is an enjoyable independent film that was shot in Chicago.  Lots of cute guys and enough drama between characters to keep it fast paced and fresh.  I'm glad I've added it to my collection of DVD's!,1186012800,6,202,4.4324324324324325
8194211,1,B000Q6777C,Terrible! Just terrible! Don't waste your time,1419638400,,46,5.714285714285714
8194212,1,B000Q6777C,A terrible waste of time.  This is one of the worst movies I have ever watched.  In my view it isn't even one star.  It is 0 or below.  It's humor is not even funny and I am ashamed that the actors had to endure such a horrible fate.,1406332800,,233,3.693877551020408
8194213,3,B000Q6777C,"I was entertain by the movie, and I was just looking for something lite to watch without having to think, it achieved that.",1402444800,,123,4.391304347826087
8194214,1,B000Q6777C,"Fortunately the rental fee for this movie was quite low as it was truly a waste of time. The plot is beyond silly and sabotaged further by the enthusiastic albeit amateur cast. BTW, I would have given it negative stars if it were possible.",1401667200,2,239,4.454545454545454
8194215,1,B000Q6777C,"Marketed as a comedy, you *may* like it if you are a sucker for the campiest of camp that begins in what looks like a '60's ""Adult Theater"" where all ""patrons"" know all other patrons and they all ""camp it up"" and cut each other down while trolling for sex. Meanwhile, the main character dreams of himself and others he knows as muscle bound (in his eyes) straight jocks who drool over him as he describes his dreams to his obviously aroused shrink who continually attempts to get the main character to admit to himself that he is gay so he can recognize all the gay ""goings-on"" around him while he is trying to be and look for a straight man.

A little goes a long way with me and this was just torture. I managed to make it to minute 7 and sadly decided to hang in there through minute 12. After that it was several fast-forwards through equally horrible trash and I successfully made it through the final credits. Oh, and BTW, the guy on the cover has little to nothing to do with this disastrous waste of video and your money!  This is not even worth being free. It is so bad WE should be paid to watch it as part of a psychological experiment to determine how much torture human beings can withstand.",1401321600,,1204,4.299559471365638
8194216,1,B000Q6777C,This movie is just BAD from beginning to end Bad acting  no VERY bad acting and a worse plot  well actually NO plot or story at all !  sad thing is i wanted to like it  BUT alas it was a waste of time turned it off bout half way through just could not suffer through it any more  .  This is one for the trash heap..check it out if you will but remember .... you have been warned,1400198400,,378,3.721518987341772
8194217,1,B000Q6777C,This is a dreadful and ridiculous dumb movie. The movie had no substance or anything else going for it... It was no good!,1399680000,,121,4.304347826086956
8194218,5,B000Q6777C,"This is a hilarious movie with sexy guys,the plot and the characters are awesome. I really like Jamie the most he is so cute.",1399680000,2,125,4.25
8194219,4,B000Q6777C,"This is exactly the same ""Get A Life"" Frame by Frame as the more expensive one, the one with that group shot on the cover and the guy with the red cap on, the only difference-It is just far less expensive. This is the original version.",1237766400,9,235,4.130434782608695
8194220,2,B000Q6777C,"Get a Life is an independent film from 2006 of mixed quality. The story was okay, in a way it seemed a critique of the bar & sexual hunting lifestyle...except that the main character was in it up to his neck by compulsively going to the bookstore backroom. The acting seemed like the producer got some friends together to do the movie. These two qualities would have been forgivable if the production values were any better. Obviously shot directly on a video camera of some sort giving it a totally amateur feel that stressed the faults of the acting & writing.

I'm giving this movie a 2 only because the ending was an unexpectedly upbeat turn...I won't say positive, but definitely upbeat.",1237334400,,692,4.672131147540983
