1233072,5,B00000JKVX,"From 1853 to 1927, the Children's Aid Society, a private charity, relocated over 100,000 children in the rural areas of the still developing United States.  ""The Orphan Trains"" is the story of these  children and of the people who took them in.  The film starts with the  young minister Charles Loring Brace who wanted to help the hoardes of  homeless or mistreated children in New York City by sending them out to  healthy rural areas that so needed the additional labor.
Today it would  be unthinkable to allow any organization, private or otherwise, to ship  100,000 children to other parts of the country.  However, this film  attempts to put the efforts of the Children's Aid Society in the context of  its times:  children were living in the streets or in homes where they were  neglected and abused, and everyday countless more children were arriving on  Ellis Island.  Brace thought he could protect these children while solving  America's labor shortages on the frontier at the same time.
While this  documentary does try to put Brace's motivations in their proper context, it  does not try to sugarcoat what happend to a great deal of the orphans who  were abruptly sent West to unknown territory.  Many of the children were  perceived as slave labor and were abused even worse than they were in New  York.  Many were neglected and passed from farm to farm.  Some children  were fortunate enough to be taken in by kind loving families and these  stories are also told.  This film truly shines with its  interviews with  now-grown orphans and foster parents telling their heartbreaking yet  triumphant tales.  There is a wealth of historical data on some of these  children including photographs and personal journals of their experiences.  The film richly uses this material to make these stories fresh and alive  again.
Were the Orphan Trains an effective method to save America's  children, or were they a well-intended but dreadful mistake?  This question  is too complex to be answered in just a one-hour documentary, but this  documentary will make you think about the answer for a long time  afterwards.",956534400,5,2119,4.945714285714286

The movie shows only the good outcomes of the OrphanTrain Program. I wish they would have talked more about those children who weren't successfully placed. It would have balanced out the real truth. I know many children found loving homes and grew up to move onto great careers, etc. But other than a mention of older boys running away from foster homes due to being mistreated, the movie doesn't tell their stories.",1399507200,8,551,4.690721649484536

This I hour DVD (PBS Home Video) tells the story of the incredible beginnings of the Children's Aid Society in NYC by minister Charles Brace in 1853.

While it is now clear that not all the children were fortunate enough to have the happy endings Mr. Brace intended, his idea was, without a doubt, a brilliant one that came about out of the most sincere concern for those less fortunate. It is to his credit that the Children's Aid Society still operates to this day and this is a `must see' piece of American history for everyone.",1396483200,,800,4.5874125874125875

1233180,4,B00000JKVX,"Solid and informative documentary on how the Children's Aid Society of New York, founded in 1853 by a compassionate young
minister named Charles Loring Brace, for 75 years helped over 100,000 orphaned or unwanted kids from New York City find
homes with rural families, mostly farmers, across the country.

The film is helped by the amazing photos by Jacob Riis of New York's street kids, but even more by the first hand accounts of the kids who
made this journey to becomes strangers in a strange land.

Some are read from letters and diaries by actors as voice-overs accompanying old stills or black and white modern footage of trains and
country side. But far more arresting are the interviews with some now old survivors of the journey, most of whom look back on the the
families they found with great fondness, without white-washing how difficult and strange the changes in life could be. Indeed the film
acknowledges that the kids were used as cheap labor, and at times were ill-used and became run-aways, although the clear implication was that
was the exception not the rule (and kids working for a living was not a rarity for the time).

Perhaps most moving is a man who must be in his 90s at the time of filming, remembering with a quiet, stoic love the son he adopted, who
died at 72.

Always interesting, somehow this documentary never crossed over into the more emotional experience I had expected, and can even feel
repetitive at times, but is well worth seeing for an intelligent 1st person telling of a little known piece of U.S. history.",1373846400,,1553,4.719557195571956

Each one gives their experience, good and bad, so gradually a picture emerges of what it was like to be a young child taken into a strange home, not knowing if they will be part of the family or just treated as a slave to work for the family.

In turn, my students also realized how fortunate they are to have their own families that love them and take care of them. Many very important life lessons are taught in this film. My students were so quiet and focused while viewing this film. They also learned about how our society has progressed and how much better children are cared for in this country at this time. They also learned the skill about caring for others who can't take care of themselves. I highly recommend this film to all Social Studies teachers.

1233202,4,B00000JKVX,"American Experience - The Orphan Trains tells the story of how The Children's Aid Society was formed in 1853 to help poor and often homeless children in New York City get a better life by sending them on long train rides to more rural parts of our nation. It was thought that if the children could escape the city they would have a better chance at a happy, normal life. We see how Charles Loring Brace founded the society when the only help available for children was a type of ""orphan asylum"" in which the children were taught skills so that they could earn money.

Brace desperately wanted a better way to help these children; he and his peers did not believe that the orphan asylums were teaching skills valuable enough to truly help the children. This program changed the lives of so many children--between 1853 and 1929, more than 150,000 abandoned, abused and orphaned children were taken from a life of poverty usually while living on the streets and begging for money, and sent, more often than not, to relatively stable homes where they could have a much better sense of family.

On the down side, however, children were essentially rounded up (the film doesn't say exactly how) and sent forcibly to other parts of the country by train where they hopefully had a real chance at a better childhood.  Of course there's more to the story but I don't want to spoil it for you so I'll leave the rest out. You can rest assured that if this topic interests you, you won't be bored watching this film!

The real electricity of the film comes from invaluable interview footage in which now elderly people who rode orphan trains tell their most personal stories about their experiences both good and bad. The emotions these people display truly moved me and I could see that in some ways The Children's Aid Society had helped some while it had been insensitive to the emotional needs of other children.

The DVD comes with few extras; there is a type of advertisement for other features of the Public Broadcasting System website but unfortunately that's about it. However, this film is so good I can overlook it. Another reviewer mentions the fact that the photos and stories of these children are about white children only--what happened to African-American children and children of other races? I would have liked to know.

American Experience-The Orphan Trains is quite a powerful story and I recommend this for anyone interested in this topic.",1258502400,45,2447,4.745882352941177

It gave me a sense of what he must have gone through during his early life, and an appreciation of his adoptive parents, whom I also didn't know.  They provided a good home for him, and a stable environment for him to grow up in.  My Mother told me that he had been adopted, but I'm not sure she even knew the circumstances.

1233205,3,B00000JKVX,"From the 1850s to the 1920s, a philanthropist sent orphaned and poor children from New York City to farms in the Midwest and West.  By fluke, a recently deceased woman found his diary and helped to shed light on this topic.

I had known that French female orphans were sent to Quebec to be wives and maids for colonists centuries ago.  However, I didn't know that the US had an adoption plan that crossed vast boundaries, in the past.  This disc covers many questions that would concern adoptions of any kind.  Were some children picked over others?  Were adoptive parents grateful or abusive?  Did the children want to be adopted?  What happened when things didn't work out between child and potential parents?  It'll warm your heart to see that some adoptees truly found love and shelter.  Still, this work was realistic enough to talk of children that were abused and practically enslaved, though the work never say anything on the topic of sexual molestation.

Another thing this work NEVER mentions is RACE.  Though it notes that the children were often a different ethnicity and religion than the English-descended, Protestant, adoptive parents, it fails to note that every child here was white.  Did the philanthropist who started the program not care about black orphaned children?  Did blacks have ways of adopting children that was unlike that of whites?  (Is that why the 1980s film ""Annie"" only had white girls in it?)  Though fictional, ""Gangs of New York"", based during the same time period, mentioned a black orphanage.  So there were parentless black children at that time.  It's possibly unjust that their stories were not brought up here.  Also, the work talks of children being suspected of having ""bad blood"" (totally unrelated to STDs) from their parents, yet the word ""eugenics"" never comes up.

The migration of human groups fascinates me.  I recently saw a documentary on how English women were shipped to Australia in its colonial days.  I am the proud descendant of African Americans who moved during the Great Migration of the early to mid-1900s.  Modern immigration is what is changing the birth rate and ethnic make-up of modern America.
