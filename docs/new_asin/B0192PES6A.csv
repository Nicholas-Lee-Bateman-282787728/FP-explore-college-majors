8743685,4,B0192PES6A,"the fact my area Wal-Mart has gotten very few videos I wanted in some time I was surprise while picking other stuff there to find this movie that I did not even know came out.  I have to say for the most part I like this movie even more than the first Twinkle Toes film. It has great songs, dance moves and wonderful new characters.  not to mention the bonus Twinkle Toe short with Twinkle new friends in New York. this movie deal with summer has started and Twinkle dad is directing a New York play.  The only problem I had with this movie I had was it kept me wondering what became of Twinkle Toes and Sporty Shortly third female friend Pretty Tall from the first movie.  The one with the blue hair on the other movie cover image. Maybe Sketchers discontinued the brand name of the shoe she was nick named after or something but it would of been nice to know why she got replace with some male DJ.  so I took off a star for the missing friend but other than that great film.",1460073600,,976,4.170212765957447

8743687,5,B0192PES6A,"This is an adorable DVD that my 4 year old was excited to watch. It is about an hour long DVD that features lots of Twinkle Toes adventures. The show is wholesome and appropriate for kids which is nice to not have to worry. It is actually Family Approved for All Ages. While the DVD features mainly girls, even my boys got caught up watching it, although they of course wouldn't admit that! I will say though if your child knows what Skechers Twinkle Toes shoes are, they may want a pair after this DVD.

I received this DVD to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.",1459209600,,577,4.342592592592593
