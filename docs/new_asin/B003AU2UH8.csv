8393197,4,B003AU2UH8,"Very entertaining and odd series and 3 reasons to love it.
1. Like many UK based shows it is well written.
2. In many way the series concentrates on the lives of the characters and not so much the disability.
3. The characters are shown as real people, sometimes admirable and sometimes petty.
