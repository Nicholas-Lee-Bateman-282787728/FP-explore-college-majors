8537566,3,B0098466MU,"At a time when superheroes have lost all government and public support, tensions reach an all time high when a superhero by the name of Fridge becomes embroiled in a government conspiracy. Fridge, who has the ability to shoot deadly ice from his hands is in a funk after his girlfriend cheats on him with his civilian alter ego! Meanwhile his partner C-Thru, who possesses superhuman X-ray vision has captured Shrink, a super villain who murdered Fridge s parents. This is the basic plot, this very low budget movie hass some charming aspects but overall would I go out of my way to check it out? Not a chance. This cast is limited and they do all right. C-thru is trying to get back in good with the superhero community and the public who no longer needs them o a conspiracy is set in motion. I see the morals, trust, faith and revenge and some other emotions thrown in for good measure.",1522627200,,888,4.487654320987654
8537567,5,B0098466MU,Interesting!  Looking for other types for work.  I heard he has done several music albums too. After a hard day is a good time to watch this movie,1396051200,,146,4.178571428571429
8537568,3,B0098466MU,"This movie, while interestingly set, breaks no new ground for comedy or independent filmmaking. Set in a world where superheroes are commonplace and on the outs with the public, two superheroes are tasked with escorting a super-villain back to prison. Within this plot device, there is a budding romance, a glaringly obvious plot twist, and bad special effects.
It is easy to see why Kevin Smith added this movie to his movie club; it relies heavily on dialog to move the story along and this is its strong point. The dialog is mostly clever and the leads are well cast. One surprising disappointment is Danny Masterson, the star-value cast member in this film. He gives a performance that is phoned-in at best, and painful in places. He doesn't mesh well with the rest of the cast who give solid performances. It is clear that he wasn't excited to be there.",1389657600,,858,4.726666666666667
8537569,3,B0098466MU,"This movie was okay. The story line was a bit off, it was predictable in a sense that made it almost totally boring. There was a bit of comedy in this movie that kept it watchable but just barely.",1388448000,,196,4.051282051282051
8537570,4,B0098466MU,I rented this to watch Danny Masterson but was pleasantly surprised with the entire premise.  Good story and clever ending.,1360195200,,123,5.15
8537571,4,B0098466MU,"This was a funny, interesting indie movie. I really enjoyed the quirky dialogue and story line.

I saw this movie, as I really enjoyed the director's other endevour ""Rozencrantz and Guildenstern are undead"" and found this to be of the same campy, enjoyable calibre.

The casting was great, including Danny Masterson and newcomers like Brooke Nevin. It was all topped off with an unforgetable soundtrack by Sean Lennon.

highly recommend this for some great holiday entertainment.",1355443200,3,479,5.276315789473684
8537572,5,B0098466MU,"I enjoyed this movie.  I watched it twice.  It literly is the Alter Ego of all the Super Hero Movies, which I generally enjoy but it is nice to see a movie that does not take itself too seriously.",1355443200,3,196,4.0
8537573,1,B0098466MU,"I caught this on Netflix last Sunday with my wife & I remember seeing a trailer for it online a few weeks prior so I gave it a go. Big mistake because it didn't look very remarkable from the trailer alone so I really should've known better. If the cover alone doesn't convince you not to lose your time on this indie garbage, which by the way looks like a mock up of NBC's catch 22 ""Heroes"" & Fox's awful ""The Tick"" sitcom, nothing will. Despite it's attempt to be witty & cast a shadow of sarcastic commentary on the current trend of superhero movies, ""Alter Egos"" is really bad. It's not even remotely funny & evidently so that after like forty five minutes we couldn't finish watching it either. Don't waste your time.",1355356800,2,721,4.388059701492537
