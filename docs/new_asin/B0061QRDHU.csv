4929201,1,B0061QRDHU,"I was extremely dissapointed. I that George was good, but ALL the others comics were bad. They need to go to comedy school. Don't wast your money.",1326758400,2,146,4.444444444444445
4929202,1,B0061QRDHU,THIS IS A COMEDIAN THAT I HAD NEVER HEARD OF. I READ A REVIEW AND WAS PULLED IN BY THAT. THIS DVD IS NOT FUNNY AT ALL. THE COVER DETAILS THIS ONE COMEDIAN BUT THEIR SEVERELY DIFFERENT COMEDIANS DOING STAND-UP. THE VIDEO LOOKS OLD AND THE JOKES WERE JOKES I'VE HEARD FROM OTHER COMEDIANS. I HATE I WASTED MY MONEY & PAID FOR EXPRESS SHIPPING FOR THIS DVD. I HAD COMPANY OVER FOR XMAS TO WATCH THIS DVD AND SOMEONE TOOK IT OUT THE PLAYER & PUT IT BACK IN THE CASE BEFORE IT ENDED. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS DVD. GEORGE A HOST NOT THE HEADLINER. ALL GEORGE DOES IS INTRODUCE THE COMEDIAN. . BY FAR THIS WAS ONE OF THE WORSE COMEDY DVD'S I'VE COME ACROSS. THE FACT THAT I PAID FOR IT IS REALLY WHAT I DON'T LIKE!! HE TOLD NOT 1 JOKE THAT WAS FUNNY. HE JUST STOOD ON STAGE WITH A DRINK IN HIS HAND TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE. I SEE NOW WHY I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THIS COMEDIAN. DON'T WASTE UR MONEY!!,1325116800,8,892,3.988826815642458
4929203,4,B0061QRDHU,Most Definitely sum Crack (it's Dope). The one about the Dude in the wheelchair and his Girlfriend was totally Genius. Still LMFA0 at that 1.

8490908,1,B0061QRDHU,"From the cover you think it is George Willborn stand up special-NOT it is other comics that are not funny at all.  This was more of a Michael Baisden show than George Willborn.  Very disappointed, I purchased it after seeing him live and wanted more, but you're not going to get it with this DVD.  He is just the host.",1439424000,,318,4.266666666666667

8490912,5,B0061QRDHU,George is a very funny guy. you will enjoy his DVD.  Just listen to it and you will see why.,1358208000,,92,3.6
8490913,4,B0061QRDHU,The dvd is good! I watched it serveral times. It's a good ice breaker for when you have company over.,1346025600,,101,4.1
8490914,1,B0061QRDHU,"I thought I had commented before but this is without a doubt the worst
comedy DVD I have paid good money for.  First of all, Baisden had a lonnnnnng
comercial regarding his ""Steve Harvey rip off book.""  Second, George's jokes
sucked especially the bathroom humor.  I was so turned off by George's jokes
he ruined it for his guest comedians for me.
I love standup comedy but again this sucked.

8490915,1,B0061QRDHU,I wish I had listened to the reviewers who stated that I should save my money.  George Willborn has never been one of my favorite comedians due to the fact that he laughs at his own jokes more than the audience.  I was really disappointed with Deon Cole.  He is usually very funny but he really bombed on this DVD.  The female comedian was terrible as well and the only comedian who really made me laugh was the last comedian.  What a waste of Comedic talent.  I will not recommend this video to any friends or family.  JUST SAD! What made this even sadder is that I purchased this DVD and one other from Amazon and I ordered two blank spindles of DVD's and whoever package the shipment put the DVD's in first and on the bottom of the box and the George Willborn DVD case was cracked and broken but the DVD was still intact.  I don't know what IDIOT thought that it was a good idea to put the disks on the bottom but he should be FIRED! I might have to find another vendor to deal with other than Amazon.,1328832000,,1004,4.16580310880829
8490916,1,B0061QRDHU,"He's a comedian?  That in itself is a joke.  I saw him on a local news segment on Fox Chicago, commenting on politics.  Surprisingly, he didn't like any candidate that wouldn't promise him some sort of entitlement.  Based on his DVD sales, I can see why.  Well, the world needs ditch diggers too.",1327795200,,296,4.509433962264151
