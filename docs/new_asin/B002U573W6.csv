3987340,5,B002U573W6,"When I saw the previews I knew there was something great about this movie. Ninja Assassin takes the best of the ninja action from anime classics, such as Ninja Scroll, and brings them to life. What makes this movie better than most is not the hand to hand fighting, but the weapons and intense training employed by ninjas. Normally where in most movies with ninjas you would see a couple of shurikens thrown here and there, NOT HERE, that is where the fun comes in. It's feasible dozens are thrown over time like a storm and they come out of nowhere, it seems. There are a lot of things that set this movie apart from many others and it is definitely worth seeing.",1264032000,,664,4.40650406504065
3987341,2,B002U573W6,"This film was so bad I was actually laughing at times at the poor dialogue and acting. Still, this was an entertaining experience, if lots of brilliantly choreographed and very bloody marshal arts action sequences were all you came to see. If you hope for anything other then that (clear and coherent story, for example), please look elsewhere.

Mika Coretti (Naomie Harris), a Europol agent, has accidentally stumbled on an international trail of murder for hire that eventually leads her to a centuries old clan of assassins. Aided by her boss Ryan Maslow (Ben Miles), she follows the trail and eventually her actions become a threat to the clan. Enter Raizo (Rain), a rouge assassin seeking personal vengeance against the clan, his former family. He is the lone saviour standing between Coretti and death. (or something like that...;o) )

You may be familiar with Rain. He is a South Korean entertainer (singer, actor, designer) who appeared in the film ""Speed Racer"". Easy on the eyes, with moves that look fantastic on camera. He is worthy of seeing.

I was extremely surprised by the appearance of the two British leads. Both are accomplished, Harris is a Cambridge graduate. You may remember her from ""28 Days Later"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", as Dalma/Calypso. Miles has a career spanning more then two decades now (he was brilliant in ""Coupling"", the original UK version). So, what were they doing in ""Ninja Assassin"" delivering amateur rank performances? ... Still a mystery...

Anyway, set aside your typical expectations of story/acting, and you will be rewarded with a fantastic action movie, true to its roots in the golden era of ""kung fu"" film.",1261958400,6,1665,5.0
3987342,5,B002U573W6,"OMG, I had no idea Rain was playing Raizo until the day before I went to watch the movie. I have to say that I was pleasantly suprised by his transformation from boy band hotty to Hot Ninja Assasin! I know he must have worked his butt off to get that body lean enough to do some of the actions in this movie. If you love blood/gore and ninja action then you will definately enjoy this movie. The synopsis was mentioned in the previous review so I won't go into that again, but I will say that the working chemistry between Rain and Naomi in this movie was relaxed and not ackward like in some movies in this genre like kiss of the dragon or Romeo must die where I get the feeling the actor/actress is acting rather than in a natural state of being. Sounds weird but I definately noticed the difference. I hope to see Rain in more lead roles, he makes one hellofa ninja.",1260403200,26,869,4.209580838323354
3987343,3,B002U573W6,"It's safe to say that ""Ninja Assassin"" won't win anything come award time but that doesn't mean it's not worth watching. Especially if you're into blood soaked martial arts films. The plot, in a nutshell is a rouge ninja named Razio faces off against his former clan after he refuses to follow their code of emotionless cold blooded murder. Elsewhere, a pretty, young Europol agent named Mika investigates the murder of a Russian diplomat and suspects ninja involvement, Ninja's that happen to be Razio's former clan. Needless to say, said ninjas don't like her meddling in their affairs and set out to take her out of the picture. Razio catches wind of thieir plans and uses it as an opportunity to sever some heads and act as Mika's personal bodyguard. As the ninja's attacks increase, Razio and Mika join forces to keep each other alive and to take the clan down once and for all. ""Ninja Assassin"" seems to take itself seriously but more often to than not it comes off as an action/comedy. When you watch ninjas fighting in the streets of Berlin as terrified Germans in their Volkswagen try desperately to swerve out of the way, you can't help but laugh out loud. The acting is pretty bad though ""Rain"" does a decent job playing the stoic ninja Razio. The best performance is by Razio's master and clan leader. He has a very interesting voice and his presence on screen demands attention. ""Ninja Assassin"" in a very pretty movie. The flight scenes in the rain and in the burning dojo are pure eye candy. The CGI inserted blood splatters help the fight scenes the same way they helped ""300"" so cool(and this movie is bloooooody). Basically, the movie excels at what it's meant to be, and that's an entertaining, ultra-violent slug fest and comes up short in the acting department. If you love action or more precisely martial art action, Ninja Assassin has what you're looking for in aces!",1260057600,5,1891,4.716012084592145
3987344,4,B002U573W6,"About halfway through this film I realized even though I've seen a lot of kung-fu movies, I haven't really seen too many ""ninja"" movies. In fact as inherently cool as ninjas are, other than the pseudo ninjas in Batman Begins, I can't really recall ninjas ever being featured in a major studio film. Ninja Assassin corrects this egregious error. This is a straightforward ""B-Movie"" revenge flick with some pretty gruesome CGI enhanced fight scenes. The plot is flimsy and the acting spotty, but I went to see people getting sliced in half by katanas and by God did I get what I paid for! I can only hope that this film leads to a sequel, which will hopefully have more of a plot and fewer one-dimensional characters. But they can keep the excellent, stylized ninja slicing CGI fights!",1259452800,2,783,4.681159420289855
3987345,4,B002U573W6,"If you want some extremely bloody ninja action, you'll get enough for three movies with Ninja Assassin. I can't think of a film that has as many limbs being cut off or higher body count than this one. Maybe the first Kill Bill flick and that's really saying something. After reading a lot of reviews from the critics, I expected a horrible story and acting to go along with the carnage, but neither were that bad. I never heard of the lead actor, played by Rain, but he is suppose to be a big singer in Asia. His performance was on and off, but his physicality stole the show. I felt the scenes that showed the main character's training from a young boy to a man at a secret assassin fortress added some depth. That sensei doesn't mess around!

Even though ninjas prefer to engage in combat in the dark, I like how you can still see what is going on in most of the fights. The many action scenes are the highlights for sure. They are brutal beyond belief, but some of the blood was a little too CGI for my tastes. Still, there were many creative kills using various slice and dice weapons. The opening scene has the most memorable kill, setting the tone for the rest of the film. And how can you not love seeing massive ninja stars being thrown at a machine gun rate of speed?

The story is your typical martial arts fare and the acting ranges from pretty good to mediocre, but you should know better than to watch this for either of those elements. I remember a couple of weeks ago saying how the destruction of the Earth, as seen in the movie 2012, won't likely be surpassed. Well, I doubt there will ever be another ninja film that throws as much violence, gore and action into just a little over 90 minutes. If there's a sequel, you can count me in.",1259366400,49,1753,4.3090909090909095
3987346,5,B002U573W6,"This movie is completely awesome. You should know that there will be blood, oh boy is there blood. Body parts flying everywhere, heads getting lopped off left and right, hands, arms, legs, torsos being cut in half, and exaggeratedly immense amounts of blood gushing everywhere. People die in this movie, a LOT of people die in this movie, and not in nice ways. There's also more than your fair share of shooting. This is the best Martial Arts / Ninja movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a LOT of them. And what ninja thriller would be complete without an appearance from none other than Sho Kosugi? There is a lot of fighting in the dark, which of course is going to happen where ninjas are involved, and this makes some of the fight scenes a bit hard to follow. However, that just immerses you more into the chaos of the scene. You think it's hard to see what's happening? Picture being in a pitch black warehouse with dozens and dozens of soldiers and automatic gun fire and also barrages of ninjas coming out of everywhere swords-a-cutting and throwing dozens and dozens of throwing stars at anything that moves. Yeah, it's going to be a bit difficult at times to see just what the heck is happening. There is some supernatural-ness to the film but it fits in well with the context of the movie. The surround sound of the movie theater was taken full advantage of with throwing stars coming from all directions, and oh my gosh they threw a LOT of throwing stars. I bet this movie hands down has the most throwing stars used in it of any other movie. And they're not you're regular throwing stars. These babies are about 6"" across, four pointed, and razor sharp. It reminds me of those movies that have thousands of archers sending thousands and thousands of arrows at the enemy. This was a similar thing but with barrages of throwing stars instead. If you're into these types of movies, this has to be the best one to date. If you're not into these types of movies, you'll hate this one just as much as any other ninja movie. I personally believe that all other Ninja movies will be compared to this one from now on.",1259280000,12,2119,4.492227979274611
3987347,4,B002U573W6,"If you've come to this movie expecting an engrossing storyline, memorable acting, and ninja action, well, you'll get the ninja action and heaps of it. The title NINJA ASSASSIN pretty much sums up the movie. There be ninjas and they're assassinating all over the place. One sub-plot centers on an eager, out-of-her-depth forensic analyst for the Europol agency (Naomie Harris) as she stumbles onto the legendary Nine Clans, a clandestine affiliation of ninjas who down the centuries have stolen children and raised them as assassins. The Nine Clans having survived this long by existing primarily as a mere rumor, no way were they about to allow the forensic analyst to keep on digging. She's marked for assassination.

The core story revolves around the orphan Raizo, brought up and trained mercilessly by the Ozunu Clan. In flashbacks we see Raizo as an intense child, then as a young man, an apt pupil and in fact the most promising of his generation. We learn what caused Raizo to ultimately defy the Ozunu Clan and to actively seek out the Clan's demise. But the odds are horrifying for Raizo; he eventually realizes he can't do this by himself. It's no real stretch to figure out that Raizo and the forensic analyst will team up. And that's pretty much it, the narrative framework which sets up all the frenetic action sequences.

Martial arts buffs should get a kick out of this one. And, again, those with an eye for a meatier storyline and well-developed character arcs will just have to settle for plenty of ninjas assassinating. The story itself unfolds in predictable stages, and there's a pervasive mood that is dark and morose. Also bogging things down is a cryptic serving of hokum disguised as Eastern philosophy. The lead character lends himself to this bleak mood, Raizo being this taciturn dude plagued by his inner demons, driven by his need for revenge, and relentlessly hunted down by his former brethren. Thru Mika Coretti (the forensic analyst who Raizo claims has a ""special heart""), Raizo finally sees a means to an end. Sort of shameful is that Naomie Harris, who was so strong in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JMA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;is here relegated to mere damsel in distress duties. Raizo is played by Korean pop star sensation Jeong ""Rain"" Ji-hoon, and big ups to his personal trainer, because dude is ridiculously ripped. His acting is so-so. It's probably not that hard playing a laconic action hero with a side order of brooding. But for sure Rain pulls off all the action scenes. Which, with this kind of movie, is really what matters. The treat for me, being a fan of 1980s martial arts flicks, is that Sh Kosugi has a featured role here, as Ozuni, the implacable ninja headmaster. Long live Sh Kosugi!

The action is stylized and way brutal. Lots of viscera and rampant body part dismemberment, lots of blood spurting and gushing and fountaining. These are ninjas as they should be, wicked formidable and scary, emerging from the shadows like disgruntled wraiths. I'm pretty fond of the AMERICAN NINJA flicks back in the '80s, but, man, did they ever bastardize the ninja mythos. In AMERICAN NINJA 4: THE ANNIHILATION, I remember seeing packs of ninjas strutting around in bright colored outfits and in BROAD FRIGGIN' DAYLIGHT, and I cringe. In their shadowy element, the Ozunu Clan makes easy mincemeat of their victims, never mind that their targets are armed with hi-tech and modern weaponry. And because the ninja works best in the dark, at times the action sequences are hard to make out. But Raizo is marvelous to look at, especially when he's wreaking carnage with his wicked weapon of choice, the steel blade hook and chain (the kyoketsu shoge). Awesome weapon!

NINJA ASSASSIN doesn't really show off a healthy sense of humor, although it flirts some with the absurd, but what it does offer in levity is very welcome, whether it's Raizo guessing a woman's wardrobe size or that exterior shot of the motel and the car parked outside it, with the car totally swiss-cheesed and bristling with flung shuriken. What made me laugh outloud, though, was when one Europol agent remarked that Raizo ""Looks like he belongs in a boy band."" Because in-jokes are always appreciated. I say go ahead and endure the labored narrative. The fight scenes are worth getting to, hellacious enough that they earn the movie a rating of 3.5 stars out of five from me.",1259193600,3,4528,5.0494652406417115
3987348,5,B002U573W6,"""Weakness compells strength, betrayal demands blood"". this is what a Ninja sensei portrayed by Sho Kosugi tells his students. in a series of flashbacks we see the ninja Raizo's training from childhood into a cold blooded killer. during an act of heroism, Raizo betrays his clan and becomes a target himself. i can't say too much more as this will spoil the plot. all i can say is that the action is brutal. go see this if you can. you won't be dissapointed. the all out brawl at the end of the movie is great with the final showdown between the members of the clan and finally his own sensei. even my girlfriend loved this movie.",1259107200,2,629,4.431034482758621
3987349,4,B002U573W6,"Co-produced by the Wachowski Brothers (boy, these guys just like Japanese mythos) of the Matrix fame and with a screenplay written by Matthew Sand and J. Michael Straczynski (one of my favorite writers) I knew I just had to give ""NINJA ASSASSIN"" a look. Being a martial arts action fan, I know what I am talking about when it comes to high-flying action, moody Asian plot elements and mysticism. Director James Mcteigue's film is a lot of fun and provides some needed action `junk' for martial arts fans and it is a fair attempt at creating a new martial arts hero.

Raizo (Korean actor Jeong ""Rain"" Ji-Hoon) is a deadly assassin who was kidnapped as a child to be raised and trained by the Ozunu Ninja Clan that is also known as the Black Sand Clan; the existence of this secret group of assassins is considered to be a myth. Following the execution of his childhood friend by his own clan, Raizo has severed all ties with the Ozunu and goes into hiding. He resurfaces some years later seeking revenge on the clan's leader (Sho Kosugi) that takes him on a path that crosses with a young Europol agent named Mika (Naomie Harris) who is investigating the money linked to political murders and is in turn linked to the supposed mythic Ozunu Clan. Now, Raizo must confront his former brothers and to finally find redemption for the death of his childhood friend.

The plot in ""Ninja Assassin"" isn't very special, it is your usual revenge flick that touches on the themes of redemption, regret and finally fulfillment of one's destiny. However, what makes it somewhat engaging is the fact that the film has that Japanese flavor and carries enough of the style that made Asian movies successful in the martial arts genre. The screenplay gives some good characterization in the part of the lead character and focuses on his development as young student and finally a man. Raizo's past is shown in the form of flashbacks, and writers Michael Sand and J. Michael Straczynski (he rewrote the script) manages to make a compelling character out of Raizo. From childhood, he has been tortured both mentally and physically by Lord Ozunu (nicely portrayed by Sho Kosugi) that proved to be his own rite of passage. His friendship with Kiriko (Kylie Goldstein) proves to be anchor within the walls of the Ozunu and his rivalry with another student Takeshi (Rick Yune) for the leadership of the clan proved to be his goal at first. Things change, and the script brings the exposition that the right woman can indeed change a man for the better, this is indeed a fact.

Alright, one isn't exactly here for an inventive plot, martial arts action films usually soar because of the exciting fights and outrageous stunts; in this regard ""Ninja Assassin"" doesn't disappoint. Actor Jeong Ji-Hoon does have the charisma of a young ninja warrior and he does move gracefully during the fights. The film is full of style and very cool macho posturing; this is after all, still a Hollywood flick so count on the usual extreme close-ups, tricks with CGI, and a lot of zooming in and outs that take us right in the middle of the action. The fight choreography is very good, and looks very spiffy. It is cool but Hollywood didn't know when to stop and the scenes do become rather bombastic at times, that it came dangerously close to becoming ""cartoonish"". Ninja's are assassins that rely on stealth and the shadows to get to their objective, while the film does have those qualities, it doesn't feel any different than other martial arts films done by Hollywood. This movie would have done better with a more restrained style, but it does have its moments. The fights are long and very bloody; I liked the fights that occurred in the police safe house and the final fight with Sho Kosugi proved very exciting. It was such a thrill to see an older Kosugi show that he still has the stuff.

The film also has a significant amount of gore and loads of blood. I was happy to see the gore and massive amounts of blood but after awhile the CGI blood effects started to wear thin. I know the effects are probably done in a manner to pay homage to Japanese arterial sprays effects but it would've been better if it used the old-fashioned red-ink. The film also uses some prosthetics enhanced with the CGI blood, the results are a little uneven as the quality of the effects swing from good to just plain unnecessary.

""Ninja Assassin"" has a fair share of supporting characters and while they did manage to get things going for Raizo, I am rather undecided whether they were necessary or not. Sure, Mika had her moments and actress Naomie Harris is nice to look at, but what is up with sidekicks? Hollywood still has little faith on the lead character to pull it off. Her superior Maslow (played by Ben Miles) provides some humor but this is where the dialogue resorts to becoming too obligatory, and the supporting characters do get in the way of the action.

""Ninja Assassin"" is a fun action movie to watch. Despite its flaws, I enjoyed the way the fights were spaced out and if one is looking for balls-to-walls action then this film will not disappoint. Sometimes, we need a fun martial arts film and ""Ninja Assassin"" may just fulfill the needs of the action junkie. The CGI blood effects may prove to be a tad excessive at times, that I was a little turned off but I managed to look past it because the screenplay does manage to make Raizo an interesting character. The film would have been better if it avoided the stereotypical sidekick affair and instead focused on the conflict between Raizo and Lord Ozunu, but hey, this is a Hollywood flick, so if you want real authentic ninja mood and action, turn your eyes to Japan.

3987474,1,B002U573W6,"Rain (Jung Ji Hoon) is an excellent actor, and his ability shows in films that appreciate his talent, his comedic skills, and his range.  Open up to Korean TV and films if you want to see him really act.
But this joke of a movie is an insult to him.  Shame on the W Brothers for exploiting him and not showcasing his talent in this over the top bloody, plotless film.  It exists for blood and violence; I can't see much more.  Had the writers, directors, and producers been willing to do so, they could have produced a reasonably intelligent film that did more than chop bodies up.  There are probably no more than 10 lines of dialogue between each bloodbath.  Rain trained for months for this film, and it doesn't even use his talents well in its own genre.
The few lines of dialogue are usually badly written, so it's difficult for even the most talented actor to pull them off.  You can't develop complex or any for that matter personal relationship characterization with these minimal exchanges.  There is supposed to be a relationship developing between Rain and the young woman, but the lines are just thrown in there with no justification or preparation, and they come off stiff and artificial.
Although he is entitled to be proud of his physical achievements for and in this film, Rain has to be embarrassed by what the W brothers have released.  With any decent film at all, he might have been invited for better quality films here, but no.  This and one other, equally as bad.

OK, I'll start with the logic behind the title of this review.

I was a big fan of the older Ninja movies like Revenge of The Ninja etc. I read a review here that said something like if you like old Ninja movies that this one did it justice, in modern times, and I agree, and that was what enticed me to watch this. I think they did justice to the Ninjas, with the right amount of mystique, and badassness.

Also, it has Sho Kosugi, who I used to love watching in his movies, so that was a cool part too.

Then it has a lot of bloody violence, with limbs being cut off etc., where the lead character is taking on a bunch of opponents and slicing through them almost effortlessly, yet very skillfully, similar to Kill Bill, and maybe even more bloody.

As far as how it made me think of Daredevil, it was a little dark, like I thought Daredevil was, and the lead character had a little bit of humanness to him, as he isn't immortal (i.e. he gets hurt pretty bad), and his screams were human sounding, and passionate, like Daredevil reminded me of.

At the same time, the lead (Rain) is a total badass, like uber badass.

I personally like when someone is almost unstoppable in a movie when it's done right, and that was him.

Otherwise, for me, my mind turned off during the whole movie, and I enjoyed it in that way. Just the right amount of story/action etc.

It was interesting and captivating enough, with the back and forth scenes going back in time, showing Rain's training and upbringing, and then the present time story of the Ninja Assassins, which in the movie for a while were considered a total myth.

And the Ninja Clan did a good job at keeping themselves secret, although Government officials in the movie seemed to maybe have some knowledge and it seemed there was a cover up, which added a little mystique, in how they would go about that angle etc.

It was also a pretty dark angle at the past Ninja training, where the Master was pretty strict, and brutal towards students that defied him.

If you've been looking for a good Ninja movie, you may like this, and be prepared for a bit of blood and violence, as they didn't really hold back in that area.

I thought it was great, and it hit the spot that I used to fill with movies like Revenge Of The Ninja, and even a couple Bruce Lee movies.",1442448000,2,2573,4.313278008298755

3987669,4,B002U573W6,"Not a strong or original story. Not a bad one either. But that's not why we came here, is it?! One of the best action movies ever... I mean purely for the sake of action. It's ninja-lore accurate. But not entirely realistic. I mean, it takes license with being mystical. Let me give you an example. When the ninja emerges from the pitch black of a cast shadow, you think, yeah that's how they fooled people into thinking that they were demons, he creeped around unnoticed until he found a shadow big and dark enough to crawl out of. That's great. But along comes another lazy scene that ruins that perspective you just gained: several of the clan swoop into a second story window in seconds as a ghastly blur of darkness.  It's like there were two directors who weren't on the same page, one who wanted to take ninja history seriously and make plausible scenes, and another who just wanted to make a late 80's action movie. As a whole, the picture looks great and the actors will probably meet your expectations.

In addition, I personally use it for a referrence when drawing exciting pose gestures or understanding anatomy as such.",1438560000,,1133,4.603960396039604

Rain is impressive as the protagonist, the story doesn't try to be anything more than it needs to, and some ninja chick winds up in a washing machine. It's great.

I could have done without so many flashback sequences and little more of what they serve up at the beginning, but hey, it's alright for what it is.

Lots of action, lots of martial arts mumbo jumbo, lots of blood, lots of dismembering, and a few good laughs. Rain and Naomi Harris have good rapport and make a sexy couple. Alas, like other Asian action heroes, they never ""get together"" -- at least not while both are awake. But, martial arts is about honor, purity and enlightenment, so I guess we'll have to be satisfied with (spoiler alert!) a kiss at the brink of death (or re-birth, same thing, I suppose).",1433376000,,597,4.6415094339622645

3987719,5,B002U573W6,"This is a GREAT action movie! I loved the fast pace, loved the plot and thought it was an entertaining movie all around. I also have a lot of respect for Rain, who trained hard for this movie, transforming himself from a skinny pop singer, to someone who really resembles what an actual ninja might look like. The performances are good and about what one would expect from a martial arts film. I can't say the whole ninja clan/revenge plot is original but I can say it made for a gruesome and blood filled ninja gore-fest and THAT is what makes ninja movies cool!

There was never a dull moment in this movie and there were some creative death scenes and just a touch of twisted humor. The fight choreography is awesome and features severed body parts, shuriken attacks, heads lopped off or parts of heads lopped off and all the great fight scenes one would expect in a good ninja movie. When it comes to body count and creative kills, this movie didn't disappoint. If you don't like seeing blood, gore and extreme violence, this might not be the movie for you. I TOTALLY loved it and have no problem with action or gore.

With all that said, I won't lie, the best thing about this movie is: RAIN IS TOTALLY HOT AND RUNNING AROUND SHIRTLESS THROUGH MOST OF THE MOVIE! There....I said what most of the ladies are probably thinking...Men will like the blood, the action and the gore. As for me, all that is cool but really, without Rain, it would just be another typical ninja movie. His acting, his screen presence and yes....his AWESOME body make the movie. If they ever make a Ninja Assassin"" sequel, I hope they have more RAIN and more SHIRTLESS scenes with him doing handstand pushups on a bed of nails, throwing ninja stars and hacking up enemies. Better yet, just make a movie called ""50 Shades of Rain"" where he is shirtless, working out and fighting random, pointless battles through the whole movie!

I would not have needed any plot to look at Rain for over an hour but this movie has actual plot too. This movie ""satisfies"" on many levels. Gore and action fans will get all the blood they want...and the rest of us will love looking at Rain....and looking....and looking....I hope Rain makes more movies either way. I enjoyed this a lot and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of action movies....or to anyone who wants to check out Rain. Either way, this movie didn't disappoint!",1432598400,3,2396,4.541666666666667

Korean pop star Rain(Speed Racer) stars as heroic and deadly Raizo. Trained since he was a child in the ways of Ninjitsu, he then breaks out on his own but is now hunted by his former friends and their leader, played by legendary real life Ninja master Sho Kosugi, who played the villain in the 80's TV series The Master starring Sho and Lee Van Cleef. Raizo teams up with an agent from Europe who is out to arrest Raizo's former friends for killing for hire. The action is fast, ferocious, and full of ancient weaponry like chains, swords, staffs, and shuriken(throwing stars). These are TRUE warriors with AUTHENTIC NINJA SKILLS even when off camera!

Rain, is a very moving, and powerful actor.  He's funny, serious, moody, and sometimes mean. Watch some of his dramas. It's kind of rare when a singer, and great dancer can do acting as well.

Aside from that; this is a great movie. It comes pretty close to matching the mystery of Ninjutsu; except of course for the 'Hollywood' magic crap. The chain and blade weapon that Raizo uses looks like a modified kyoketsu-shoge, (an exclusive Ninjutsu weapon modeled from the Kusarigama). I've always liked Sh Kosugi. Way back to one of his first Ninja movie, ""Enter the Ninja"", then ""Revenge of the Ninja"". Movies that were assisted by Stephen Hayes; the 1st 'non' Japanese Shidoshi of Ninjutsu.

3988199,5,B002U573W6,"This was a fabulous ninja movie!  Horrific action.  It's bloody, but even for me, who doesn't prefer gory bloody type movies, this was awesome!

I think what made it so great was the main actor, Rain, and all of the stunt people involved.  The action sequences were superb.  They used people proficient in parquor, free running and acrobatics.  Almost all action sequences were done by real people, no wire work, no CG.  Just the human body.  I love ninja movies and this is by far one of the best ones that I have ever seen.

Rain did almost all of his own stunt work except for a couple of scenes that involved cars.  He trained 6 hours a day for months to get into shape for this movie and it shows. His dedication is amazing.  He is totally ripped.  What you see, is what you get.  Phenomenal.  Absolutely phenomenal.

The storyline is pretty good.  The other actors are pretty good.  The DVD extras are excellent.  It tells the story and history of ninjas. It tells the mythology of ninjas.  An there's a great sequence showing how Rain trained for the movie.

To me, this movie is all about the ninja action and I would give it 10 stars out of 5 if I could.  AWESOME!",1393286400,4,1173,4.362790697674418

ASSASSINS!?

Who doesn't want both those things. If you are reading this review I assume you already love one or the other or both. If not you would not be looking here you be looking on IMDB or rotten tomatoes or other less helpful sites than amazon.

If you want an all out action packed ninja badassery, then this is the movie for you.
If you are a fan of ninjas, assassins or both, then this is the movie for you.
If you want to sit and enjoy a very visually stimulation movie, then this is the movie for you.
If you want your eyes to pop out of your head for the sheer awesomeness of what you are watching, then this is the movie for you.
If you want to site and ponder about story plots and typical garbage that fills up movies nowadays, then go away. This is what it was meant to be. It was a story, it was some romance, but most of all it has pure unfiltered, unrelenting, almost ridiculous action scenes.

I HAVE NEVER SEEN SO MANY LIMBS REMOVED IN A MOVIE BEFORE!! The stunts pulled in this movie are simply stunning.

You get immersed with the main actor and his pain and what he is trying to achieve. This might not be a critically acclaimed movie, but hands down one of my favorite movies off all times. There are times that anyone just wants to sit down and watch a truly pure action flick, and this is one of them.

The storyline is a young man forcibly trained as a ninja who runs away after his first assassination assignment.  Rain(Bi) was awesome in this movie.  To be able to do the things he did physically without training from a young age is pretty impressive.  I'm used to watching him to see those beautiful eyes and charming smile.

The movie was of a dark nature and didn't allow his sense of humor to show. He did a great job with the role he was given, and he was in great shape for the stunts.

3988303,1,B002U573W6,"All right, so I decided to give this movie a little rental because well... Ninja's and Assassins, sounds cool right? Wrong, wrong, so wrong.

Let's get one thing straight, this movie is very inconsistent in terms of quality, story, characterization, and everything else in between. This is what a B-movie would be like if it were given a bigger budget. So let's break down why you need to avoid this movie if you're bored wherever you are.

1.) The beginning of the movie (after the murder of the nameless yakuza dudes) is mainly a flashback to the protagonists training days. This is normally fine, except for one problem: He's in the present having flashbacks at random! Oh there's a metal plate bobbing up and down, let me remember when my sensei yelled at me for making noise! Oh I'm going to do hand stand push ups over a bed of nails, let me remember when my fellow ninja dude beat the crap out of me in training.

If the movie was going to put so much emphasis on the ""origin"" of the character, then the ENTIRE opening scene should have been done at the ninja school. Instead we're treated with random flashbacks which are paired with random training montages. What the hell is he training for? At this point of the movie he hasn't been asked to do anything nor is he really preparing for anything.

2.) They try to make the protagonist into mr. silent but deadly hero dude. His training and grueling background would make any person into a quiet killer. Yet, this guy (in the present) throws out some light hearted jokes as if he's a nice guy. His jokes are very inconsistent with the dark background they've given him and they feel out of place.

3.) The blood and gore is over the top. We're talking heads splitting in half, legs chopped off, torso cut in two, this movie has gratuitous blood to the most obnoxious level. First off, the effects look super fake, and the blood seems to serve no purpose than to just be bloody for the sake of it. At least when I watch Robocop and see dudes get blown to bits, I see a purpose behind it. Not so in Ninja Assassin, though if you're a fan of over the top fake looking blood. By all means, knock yourself out.

4.) Why are the ninjas killing people anyway? There's no point!

Let me repeat, there is NO POINT to this movie! It's ninja porn plain and simple and it's badly executed (which is ironic considering the names attached to this film). It's a mindless action movie that sets out to have one dude fighting and killing ninjas. That's it, there's no dramatic plot twist, there's no deep meanings or themes, and in all honesty. The action scenes aren't even that great.

Sure there's some redeeming qualities to the film. The final fight with the sensei was like watching a video game boss battle, and the ninjas using the shadows to teleport was pretty cool. But all these scenes could most likely be viewed on youtube and there's absolutely no sense in you spending 1.99 to rent this movie.

If you want to see a GOOD mindless action movie. Watch Dredd or The Raid.",1374969600,2,3025,4.475499092558984

8381032,4,B002U573W6,"I had seen this movie years ago and remembered it for it's story and action. It's a memorable story, full of action, love, loss, and revenge but the bloody scenes are not for everyone. If you enjoy kung fu or ninja type films without gore, this movie is NOT for you. There are lots of bloody, violent scenes. Word of caution when purchasing this blu-ray. I had ordered it NEW from Amazon and when I received it, it was unwrapped but the disc seemed fine. It may have been a rental disc or was opened but never rewrapped. Since the movie didn't cost very much and it plays fine, I decided to keep it. I don't remember the quality of the film being so grainy either but it's watchable.",1523664000,,683,4.3023255813953485
