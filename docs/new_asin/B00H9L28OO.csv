6144320,5,B00H9L28OO,"When a JayFlix.net participant tells me to see a movie, I usually do! This time is no different, and, as usual, I'm really glad I did. (And the Golden Globes agreed with five nominations.) In my personal experience, I have... TWICE... heard that someone had won a sweepstakes, only to learn that it was early onset senile dementia or in the other case, Alzheimer's. This is what we suspect when our elderly hero sets out for Lincoln, Nebraska to collect his million dollars. Problem is, he no longer has a working vehicle, nor does he have a driver's license, so he's walking... from Montana. His son is pulled into the story by his besieged wife.

Full disclosure, I spent my early years on a farm in South Dakota, so the set design, the clothes, the speech patterns, the scenery, the pace, the people, and the small faded towns of Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota and Nebraska evoked fond memories. (No, I didn't have an unhappy childhood, sorry...)

We watch:
  * Bruce Dern (""Madison"") is the booze-addled curmudgeon who wants his million dollars. Dern has worked for decades before landing this role of a lifetime! He won ""Best Actor"" at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.
  * Will Forte (""Saturday Night Live"") is his unfortunate son, unable to talk his father out of that haywire obsession.
  * June Squibb (""About Schmidt"") is the wife with a tongue like barbed wire. She has lashed her husband for decades until he rarely hears a word she says.
  * Bob Odenkirk (Lots of TV) is the ""good"" son who has landed a job as a television newscaster. When he gets into a fight he shouts, ""Don't hit the face!""
  * Stacy Keach (Lots of television) is a former business partner who sees this unexpected windfall as a way to collect some money from our hero.

It's difficult to realize that all those authentic relatives and neighbors were actors! Director Alexander Payne (""Sideways"") has evoked astonishingly pure performances, bona fide settings, and credible situations. This tiny little R-rated domestic dramedy is no more than a tempest in a teapot, but we come to care a great deal about what happens to these people.

Payne doesn't often make movies, but when he does....Oh My! Amazon will notify me when the DVD is available.",1386892800,161,2225,4.745454545454545

6144368,5,B00H9L28OO,"When I was a little girl, my favorite steal-away place was the rough-hewn loft above my grandmother's greenhouse, where the gardener and I pored over dusty plant catalogues, and where the air was filled with the scent of times past and fern and composted soil, and geranium cuttings rooting in sand in the greenhouse below. That setting was Long Island, having nothing to do with Billings or Lincoln. But that mind-filling pleasure of old memories, the aroma of aging wood, and familiarity of car repair shops and open fields along the highway, and the reminiscences of dreams that came true and ones that didn't -- that's the kind of stuff that's revivified in this sweetly sad to melancholy story.  The photography (Phedon Papamichael) is smartly chosen and captured. The glorious congruent music, by Mark Orton, awakens all the senses and nudges them with just the right amount of longing; much of this achieved through guitar, fiddle, and harmonica. The black and white photography amplifies the mood and starkness of the piece. As the story goes, Woody Grant (Bruce Dern), confused, naive, single-minded, and approaching 80, believes he has won a million dollar sweepstake, because a piece of junk mail says so. He intends to walk from Montana to Nebraska to retrieve the money. He's already made 2 failed attempts , when his son David (Will Forte) agrees to drive him. This fantasy-inspired pilgrimage ends up being less about money and so much more about an incredibly understanding, patient and loving son's desire to fulfill his aging father's dream. The story (Bob Nelson) is smart and sensitive and often humorous in a very natural, easy, untargeted way. Alexander Payne's direction, as in earlier films, is precise, fluid, and so perceptive. The old man and his son are often seen walking side by side in a simple and natural configuration that successfully evokes a unique intimacy, captured by fine directing and photography. That personal and atmospheric quality is reminiscent of the etchings of Edward Hopper and Martin Lewis. The wife and mom in this narrative is quite a character.  Kate Grant (June Squibb) is tough as nails, crudely self-disclosing, with a potty mouth to shock a hardened blasphemer. The acting by the leads is first-rate.. The rest of the story I save for your viewing.  This is an amazing film!",1481068800,8,2334,5.010309278350515

6144405,5,B00H9L28OO,I loved the movie!

6144406,4,B00H9L28OO,"This quirky film seems an updated ""Grapes of Wrath,"" down to the roadside realism of America's heartland and gritty, black-and-white cinematography.  ""Pa"" gets a ""flier"" - they couldn't print it if it wasn't true - promising utopia down the road, and off go the family in quest of said rainbow.  Only, of course, it's all between the ears and is quickly disposed of in a mouseclick.  But unlike Steinbeck or the Coen Bros. there actually is a closing redemption, making this film entertainment, not literature: (spoiler alert!) Dad gets his new truck, new compressor, bonds deeply with his son, and both ride off into the road haze with their true treasure intact. June Squibb is as Oscar-worthy as good old Bruce Dern.",1466553600,,719,4.877049180327869

6144413,5,B00H9L28OO,"You know you're old when someone mentions Bruce Dern and you first think of movies like The Cowboys, Silent Running, The Great Gatsby, and Black Sunday.

I loved this movie.  Not only did it remind me of growing up in the Midwest, it also put together generations of old and new character actors that made me believe the story.  Having local extras also added to the ""color"".  But the best part was watching Bruce's character Woody Grant traverse his way through the trip along with his family, friends and neighbors, in order to claim his prize of $1 million dollars.

The black and white format was mesmerizing when watching the closeups of Woody and his family during such scenes as the hospital or the bar.  It's hard to find a film that makes you wonder if you should laugh or cry, or do both.

Thank you Alexander Payne for another Midwestern gem.",1464652800,,853,4.572368421052632

6144416,4,B00H9L28OO,"Much has already been written about the plot so I won't go into that. I think this is really a movie for older people. I suspect many young people might find it creepy and in fact it's not something they should have to deal with yet. But many young people today will have to deal with this when they are older or old and I'm talking about the effects of dementia.

From an artistic viewpoint I think the acting and cinematography were fine. Venerable veteran actor Bruce Dern takes the lead. Many of us who have had to deal with others with dementia know his portrayal is quite accurate and it gets worse. The setting is in depressed small towns that have seen better days, and where human cohesion and integrity suffer as well when edging toward poverty, which is also all too common these days.

Not a particularly feel good movie, closer to almost being a documentary, entirely a human interest story. No special effects that I can remember, no huge blings for the masses, but I gave it four because it was well done in all departments.",1464566400,,1039,4.492063492063492

Bruce Dern as the single minded old man who would not be dissuaded from going to claim his imagined prize became a deep and lovable man. Will Forte amazed me as the devoted son who put his life on hold for his irascible father. The family scenes were wry and sometimes painfully real. I really felt that I knew these people.

6144447,5,B00H9L28OO,"This movie was like taking a look into another family's lives. I hear complaints from people about this movie ""mirroring"" their life or being a put down of midwestern society. Well, that's what makes this movie great. Its real in its portrayal of life that way. I've known people like the ones shown in the movie all my life. I had to move from Nebraska because it felt..cold. The black and white really adds to how dreary things can be if you let the best things in life go.

The story to me speaks to the tale of a man who never accomplished anything he wanted in life. He grew up in an unforgiving household, with many bad memories stored as he made his way through life.

Everything in this movie is resultant of that. But it does become happy. The love of the man's son, David, shows that above all else, the ties of family can bring light to any situation. This movie is reflection. Its masterfully written and executed. There isn't much going on..because this is how exciting real life is most times. Its a very sobering movie.

P.S. One of the scenes in this movie was filmed in Norfolk, NE. I lived there when they did this filming. It was the talk of the town at this time. Fun fact: Norfolk is pronounced nor-fork if you're a Nebraskan. :)",1461628800,3,1250,4.379310344827586

6144523,5,B00H9L28OO,"Nebraska is an unexpected gem. It is slow at times - which usually affects my ability to stay interested - but, in this case, really supports the overall emotion of the movie. For the reviewers who thought it was ""just ok"" or that the characters were shallow: you've clearly never cared for elderly family members or had a quirky extended family. Bruce Dern's portrayal of Woody is spot-on and truly heartbreaking. The cast of characters in Hawthorne (with the exception of the cousins, perhaps) were pretty accurate depictions of small-town farm folks, in my opinion.

I'm usually not a big fan of Will Forte but I think he truly shined in this film. And, finally, I adore June Squibb - I love how she's so cute and grandma-like... until she drops an f-bomb. Her portrayal of Kate is touching and really funny at times.

Often this kind of movie is challenging to watch through to the end but Nebraska has just enough tension to keep you engaged. If you need a fast-paced action movie to keep you awake - this isn't it.

Beautiful, laugh out loud hilarious and truly a poignant movie. June Squibb is a knock out in his performance.

These are drunken, barely coherent folks, stumbling through life, in slow motion, in their small flat dusty towns. Please don't let us see the methheads, baseheads and heroin addicts that populate today's small towns.

I hope you have the patience to stick to it through the end. Among my meanest observations, besides the Myth of  the Small Town, was that the movie captured the Meaninglessness of Life in America - unless we're off murdering strangers in other lands for oil or rubber or heavy metals.

By the time we meet the newspaper woman, you may say Thank God.  Someone sane, unimpaired, intelligent. A person with her wits about her among the flat wheat fields where folks spend the day staring at traffic. Really? No hobbies, no art, no cooking contests, canning, crafts fairs, gardening competitions, street racing, or incessant ball games? Libraries? Just the Drinking? Is that it? Oh, digressing. Two of the most interesting characters, which I've never seen in a movie before, were two corrupt and mindless nephews who'd appear like cartoon freeze-frames or stills.

Movies like these are the best example that a good director and writers can do with what it seems to be a plot with no interesting value in cinema, of course the cast is right on the money, it describes so well the Midwestern lifestyle you forget at times you're watching a film and not people in real life, its implied humor is what I enjoyed the most and ends up being an endearing story far from being corny which seems unlikely at the beginning.",1447113600,2,769,4.267123287671233

Themes/scenes which could be overplayed or cliched were handled with understatement and skill. The acting was excellent. In an absolute sense this really isn't a five star film, but I'm grading on a curve compared with films of the last 5 years or so. For example, I thought Nebraska was distinctly superior to Birdman (another ""quirky/arty"" film featuring a former big name star). For what it's worth I also thought Sideways (same director as Nebraska) was overrated: although both are ""road"" films, Nebraska is the better of the two.

6144664,5,B00H9L28OO,"Excellent film. The  black & white aspect of the movie provided a starkness that made it seem like this could have happened in the 1930s. That is likely true due to the universality of serious issues confronted (onset of old age, care of parents by grown children). I thought there was a great balance between serious/sad aspects and the underlying comedy in the film -- some of the lines in the film were very, very funny.

It moves pretty slowly at times, and the black&white cinematography with frequent exteriors of vacant streets, abandoned farm buildings... the overall sparseness of it conjures up one thought: bleak.

I am in the midwest so the characters and scenes were familiar, though my experience is more like ""Fargo"", minus the violence. A lot of the humor in ""Nebraska"" was in scenes like a room full of people staring at the TV and not saying much. The mostly subtle absurdity amid the oppressive bleakness made the mother character's lines all the more shocking and hilarious by comparison.

In summary, I enjoyed this subtle, quirky screenplay with a satisfying ending.",1438905600,,778,4.976923076923077

David should have minded his own business and let Woody walk to Nebraska as he wanted to, dying in a ditch somewhere along the way. That's where he belonged. But even Ross and Kate's plan--to put Woody into an institution of some kind--would have been better than the pointless and moronic road trip to Nebraska.

I hated Woody, and I hated David even more, and I hated Kate, and Ross, and Ed and the disgusting cousins and everybody else. I HATED this movie.

Alexander Payne seems to be everybody's darling, for some reason that I cannot even begin to understand, but after suffering through this one I'll avoid his movies like the plague from now on.",1437523200,,747,4.687022900763359

It's pace conforms with the underlying theme of the movie: the slow progression of an aged person towards and through dementia.  Persons interested in aging and understanding the challenges of this portion of human life would find this a good study as well as good entertainment.  I would not hesitate to recommend it to students of gerontology or social work.  The movie may have suffered from something outside of itself, though (as one commentator noted): it may have been over-hyped as the best film of the year or some such sentiment.

It is not fast paced, nor full of action, but crafted in such a way that you are invested in the characters.  It made me laugh and it made me cry.  And in the end, yes, the good guy triumphs.  I can see why Bruce Dern won an academy award.  He does a marvelous job as the main character.  His wife is a stitch.  Even though she fusses at him and about him, there was such tenderness shown, it was very touching.  If you are looking for a nice story, one you can watch and root for the good guy, then Nebraska is the one for you. It shows that with all of our flaws, families stick together- despite our various opinions. ( And it sure was fun to see the bad guy get his come uppance.",1436745600,,861,4.041420118343195

I'll just say I appreciated what the producer was doing with the black and white.  The story line was good.  It takes a certain type of person to appreciate this movie, I will say that, it isn't for everybody. The acting was good, I'm a Bruce Dern fan.  He was quite appropriate to play this part.

I've seen it over 5 times and still shed a tear (a good tear) at the end.

It has in its own way, a kind of charm to it that made me like it even though there were things about it that I wasn't a fan of.  I understand the reasoning behind the whole black and white filming as part of the ambiance, but it is too bad in a way as some of the scenes of the Nebraska countryside would have been really nice to see in color.  The story is a bit slow at times but it is one of those kinds of movies that if you stick with, has a good story.  The scenery and the characters in the movie really remind me a lot of the small town I grew up in with those kinds of unique old time personalities that seem to be somehow stuck in time.  Growing up in a small town, this movie really struck a familiar kind of tone with me.  The humor throughout is a bit sparse but the scenes that do make their appearances had me laughing for sure.  June Squibb as Kate really stole the show with her scenes.  Although I won't say this is a favorite movie of mine, it did have enough charm to keep  me watching.

Bruce Dern's performance is a one-note theme.  He's a good actor in a part that only requires him to look old and act demented.  Put-down of
old men.",1434931200,,490,4.449438202247191

I grew up with B/W but for me it just made a depressing story of end of days and country that it made for an ugly look at not just humanity and family but perhaps the worst thing for the region's tourism. Must we make the geography as ugly/depressing as the People?  Love the performances and the concept of storyline but felt the B/W treatment was totally unnecessary.

6144939,4,B00H9L28OO,"A very different role for Dern - distant from the spaghetti westerns for which he's known. Vaguely similar to ""The Last Picture Show"", Nebraska paints a picture of a past-America, with elements many can relate to. It was engaging, and you had no choice but to cheer for the underdog (Dern) to prevail over what seemed to be an endless river of obstacles from cars on their last legs, to walking cross-states, to relatives out to undermine him.

I'm *still* wondering ""what was the message?"".  Was that just that everyone, no matter how old, is still chasing dreams? Or was it a more sinister message that just below the surface lies a dark side of humanity- one of greed and avarice?

I seldom do this, but since watching it's compelled me to look at reviews and analysis of a twisted, meandering plot. Although none I've read ""nail"" the plot. In face there is little commonality between reviews.

One of Dern's best, and Will Forte comes across as a great supporting actor. The films leaves the viewer discontented, unsettled, and unsatisfied. Yet there is a certain finality at the close, leaving one thinking that despite human striving and yearning,  only a morose, twisted shell of redemption is ever attained.",1431648000,,1215,4.822115384615385

Yup..... in a movie..... one of the only times the DUKE died in a movie.  But I forgive Mr. Dern.
The movie is tender, loving, and wonderfully portrays an aging parent and a child who recognizes the dementia but is willing to help the parent live out a last fantasy.  Photography in B&W is fantastic!  I think a lot of the mood would have been lost in LIVING COLOR!
I'm reminded of 'THE STRAIGHT STORY'.... another old, aging person fulfilling a last wish.  Oh that we all had such loving relatives.....",1430524800,,775,4.289655172413793

to learn some lessons in life that involve love, redemption, forgiveness and above all...the true meaning of family.

His role is perfect. You might think this is a sad film about aging and dementia and families gone awry, but it's not. It's a life-affirming, funny, loving and deeply moving motion picture. I wouldn't consider my film collection complete without this film. By the way, I believe it is now up on Amazon Prime Videos for free streaming if you're a Prime member. (I have been watching a lot of Prime Videos for free the past few months and I'm hooked.) This film may be a tad too long, it probably could have been edited differently or cut 10 minutes, but that's minor. The acting, the script, the black and white filming are all superb.

Those critics who think it condescendingly derides rural Americana have either never been there, or have completely missed the fact that underneath the film's relentless exposure of material and spiritual impoverishment there runs a current of deep sympathy for the ""hicks"" whose lives it chronicles. The way the mother of the family--at first seen as a foul-mouthed nag--emerges as a real mensch is one of the delights of this movie.",1429056000,,577,5.08421052631579

The black and white scenery shots of rural America is beautifully rendered and is about the best cinematography I've seen in a while. Ordinary farmlands, small towns, and roads takes on a brilliant aura (who says you need color photography). Dern (who I've always enjoyed) and Squibb turn in oscar worthy performances and Forte is very good and surprisingly restrained in his role as Dern's son who takes the father on a journey of discovery. Payne, the director, again shows his mastery of character driven movies and the deftness with which he handles the story is brilliant. There are some really funny and touching moments in the movies that is presented so effortlessly that I was left in awe of the way it all came together. Took me a while to get to this movie even though I could stream it for free with Amazon Prime. I'm sure, like with many others, this movie being in black and white probably had an impact on me delaying watching this movie.

6145102,5,B00H9L28OO,"Bruce Dern gives a performance that is immeasurable. Those who grew up in the Midwest and the Plains will understand this bittersweet elegy to an American, either lost, or never there to begin with. We don't know, because our moral and cultural frame of reference always shifts. In this movie it does NOT shift for Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) and that may be his ruination or his salvation. This movie is a pair with David Lynch's superb masterpiece, ""The Straight Story"". Both are about men who have lived hard lives, with little expectation, and far less reward. It is also about family and, clich it may well be, blood is ALWAYS thicker than water, even when you don't want it to be. You will leave this film with tears in your eyes, stunning visual motifs in your head, and a better understanding of family, dignity, honor and America. What you will gain is a path to a better understanding of yourself. On that alone, the movie is already a cinematic masterpiece, but in fact, it is in the end, an elegy to America; the bitter and beautiful heartland that lies between the two ends.

I loved the fact that the movie was produced in black and white because that is how we use to view the world.  Bruce Dern (I have loved him all my life) does a fantastic job in the roll of the 'lottery winner'.  The entire cast is awesome.  The movie shows just how marketing of magazines took advantage of certain people in our society.  But best of all the relatives and 'friends' who congregate around him thinking there was something to gain was the epitome of greed and selfishness.

6145112,5,B00H9L28OO,"Ive had this for a while.  I am not sure why I bought it.  I really had no clue what it was about.  I am very lucky that I did though.  Allow me to explain.

First, lets talk about the pace of the movie.  It is very slow.  Some scenes just show you land and have music playing.  There is no action.  It is all dialogs.  That is fine.  You will find just from the movements and facial expression, of the characters, that you see an entire story, just for them.

Some of the funniest stuff I have ever heard, is said when the older people are just chatting back and forth.  Then there is the timing of it all.  It is not an easy thing, to have everything just work out and fit perfectly.  With just the right amount of pause before the next words are spoken.  But, ever actor in this movie does it with ease.  I just laughed and laughed.  I think this would be considered a black comedy.

Now let us discuss the story.  Well, it is firstly about a man who is rather old.  He had a time when he felt very important.  He had friends and knew many of the people around him.  He was busy and lived the way he wished.  Now, he is older.  Years and years have went by.  He has started to feel empty and as if there is no point.  He is searching.  Searching not for money or fame.  He is searching for a new purpose.  He just wants to feel needed again.

So, he gets something saying he has won $1,000,000.  All he has to do is pick it up.  He starts walking.  He has no drivers license.  His son stops him and brings him home.  But, the old man will not stop.  He continues to walk, trying to get to his destination and receive his money.

His son realizes that he will not stop and aggress to drive him there.  So, they set out.  Those who know they man are telling him how stupid it is and that it is fake.  Including his son.  Then, people start to believe it and some ask for amounts of money.  The man starts to feel important again.  He is getting the attention that he has not gotten for a long time.  There are many things that happen.  I really do not want to give anything away.

You do get a sense that the man, though he may not have shown it, does care very much about people.  He cares about them and wants nothing more than to help them out.

This movie is really all about the journey, the journey for one man, a purpose, a reason to get up and something to look forward to.  I thought of my grandfather when I watched this.  It made me very happy.  This is one of the best movies Ive ever seen.

Another thing, remember how I said that there are parts that just show you land and play music?  Well, the movie is in black and white.  But, somehow, I just got a feeling that I was seeing more than I ever would if it were in color.  I thought of a way to explain it.  So I think.  Imagine you know a man.  Say you know him for 40 years.  The man moves far away.  Now, youve been talking to the man for decades and know everything about him.  One day though, in your house you find a box.  The box is full of books.  They turn out to be diaries that the man has kept since he was a young kid.  You start to read them.  Though you have known, seen and interacted with the man for decades, you feel that you learn more from and about him, just from reading his journals.  Though you are reading black writing, on white paper, what you read, gives you visions and thoughts that are more colorful and informative than any of the time you could ever spend with the man.  You learn so much just from the mans life, written in black, on white.  That is what I thought of, to explain the way this movie made me feel.  So, there it is.",1428105600,5,3632,4.004213483146067

Surreal black and white photography coupled with haunting original music provide the backdrop to a sad yet often strikingly funny story.  The scenes of Woody's extended family are reminiscent of the hard working, blue collar or farmer relatives of us baby boomers, most of whom have passed on.

It is a pleasurably slow film, deserving of time to enjoy the story as the plot rolls out.  The characters are far more complicated than meet the eye at first, and refuse to be pigeonholed.  The film could be a series of vignettes, many of which could stand alone as a short story or film, but the plot continues to gently pull us along, connecting and enlightening.",1427328000,,848,4.73469387755102

6145274,5,B00H9L28OO,I have mixed feelings for this movie. I get the message of this movie but I think the characters were lacking. Woody is maybe the only exception. He is for the most part a standup guy but he has a haunted past and regrets over how he raised his kids and his infidelity to his wife Kate. He goes on a drive from Montana with his son to claim his supposed lottery ticket and he revisits his hometown on the way. I felt sympathy for him. The other characters were a little bit lacking.  Kate is a bitter lady from start to end with a few scenes where she redeems herself. David is recently separated from his girlfriend but we never learned what caused the split. I thought the director missed an opportunity to use that to advance the story. Good acting. I liked the scenery shots. The portrayal of the townspeople was a little bit flawed. The most important scene comes at the end when Woody is driving through town and his eyes meet all of the people he knew growing up. He has forgiven. He has reconciled his past.,1426377600,,1015,4.31413612565445

6145276,3,B00H9L28OO,"This was a good movie, but not a great movie.  It is slow paced for a purpose, and in black and white which was a good choice.  Bruce Dern did a good job with may vacant looks and portraying a man who has really escaped inward and you discover why.  The real gem was June Squibb, who plays his wife, she is a pistol, and very reflective of aging Seniors who have lost their ""filter"" and say the most shocking and obnoxious things and do not fit into modern society. Will Forte does a good job as the son, and I enjoyed it when he finally starts supporting his father's pipe dream of winning one million dollars, some comical things happen from then on.  The funniest scenes come from June Squibb when she asks to be taken to the cemetery to pay ""respects"" to the dead - what ensues during this visit it absolutely hilarious.

6145337,5,B00H9L28OO,"Nebraska is easily one of the best film Alexander Payne has ever made. It would be extremely hard for him to create something better than this. I also feel that this is one of the better films about getting old, and about the love that sons have for their father.
Alexanders Payne's movie is about the everyday people, the men and women who live in the small towns in America. The movie is the study of family, their relatives and the everyday events that become so important to them.
Nebraska was an amazing movie experience for me. It is about Woody (Bruce Dern), he is cynical but has also reached a age where the mind and the body is slowly slipping away. He gets one of the flyers from the Publishers clearing house telling him that he has won a million dollars and a reluctant son David( Will Forte) takes him on that journey to Nebraska to collect his prize money. The movie takes a look at America and life in small towns, the regular folks that are as Woody ( Bruce Dern), the man who has reached old age and his mind is running away from away him with dementia. He has not achieved much in life and thus going to Nebraska to collect his million dollars may be the only thing worth aspiring for. He has two sons Ross ( Bob Odenkirk) a newsman and David, the polite and reluctant driver. Then there is the mother,  Kate (June Squibb), who is frustrated with her husband but still cares for him deeply. One of the best scenes with her is in a cemetery and introducing him to the headstones.
The direction is just amazing and keeps the flow going at an easy pace for the next two hours. All of this is brilliantly narrated against the bleak but beautiful landscape of Montana and Nebraska. The black and white film looks better than it would have been in color. Then there are the amazing final moments when the son finally decides to fulfill his dads lifelong dream. Just amazing.
A standing ovation to Alexander Payne and one of the top five movies of the year 2013. 5 Stars. Nov 15th, 2013.",1425772800,,1999,4.388140161725067

This was a touching and sometimes a tad sad movie about the Father who goes back home to claim what he thinks is a million dollar prize and the relatives and the town troublemaker who come calling for a piece of the prize.

6145380,5,B00H9L28OO,"I could not get my wife to watch this film.  I think that it cultivates a fear on first watching it that it will end tragically.  But, it is masterful in that it does not yield neatly to categorization as either comedy or tragedy.  That seems ironic in that it is shot in Black and White.  The truth is that the film is neither Black nor White, it is all shades of gray.  I could not help drawing parallels to Bruce Springsteen's album ""Nebraska"" whose cover also is devoid of color.  I think the gray in the film symbolizes age more than anything else, sets the mood that this is a story about nearing the end of life.

The story in this film is one of ""Quest.""  There's the superficial quest of Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) to get to Lincoln Nebraska to claim his million dollar prize in a magazine company's contest.  But, deeper, there's his quest for dignity and meaning for his life.  His son, David Grant (Will Forte), joins his father on his superficial quest though he realizes that it is foolish, but really seeks a better relationship with his father.  On another level he is merely demonstrating his love for his father by helping him realize his dream.  Similarly, other members of the family are brought into the vortex created by Woody Grant's quest.  Some want to exploit it, but those who love Woody get to display and fulfill that love through their participation in the Quest.

The film is rich, thoughtful and left me feeling good at the end.  Their are comic moments, but it is not a comedy.  There are tragic moments, but it is not a tragedy.  It doesn't require a degree in Literature to understand, the story has universal appeal.  The language is real and includes adult references to sex, but I doubt if most people will find it particularly offensive.  It's about what you'd hear at the local barber shop or down at the feed store.

The acting is excellent.  Bob Odenkirk plays one of Woody's sons, but it is a minor role.",1425254400,,1945,4.484330484330484

The Publishers Clearing House letter idea was great, they are so enthusiastic, and easily misunderstood; the scene in the dingy little office with one secretary was perfect... Because there was so much to think about in each set of relationships, this is great storytelling. Are we really to think that life outside of the great metropolis's is so utterly banal?  All of the brothers stoically fixed on the TV screen was either devastating, funny - or patronizing.  Which?  I really felt the need to know what the son would do once he got home again.

He was glued to the screen, and though it was in black and white, and the core theme was the son dealing with his dad's Alzheimer's (or whatever was going on mentally with him), the plot and the people really drew him in. He wanted to share the film with the rest of our family, and they also enjoyed it.
For me, I found myself laughing at the father's antics and how the son tried to compose himself throughout their trip, and the discomforts which it brought about.
This movie was splendid because it wasn't attempting to be. It was a slow, not very exciting plot line. It was the people who made it colorful.",1424390400,,735,4.183098591549296

Nebraska does an amazing job of showing how a man probably in beginning stages of dementia still has his personality and humor intact, reflecting on his life and what he wants to accomplish because there isn't much good time left.  A man with many faults and shortcomings as a father, it also showed how it is possible to reconcile some of those painful aspects of family life if you have the chance, late but still possible.  I felt as though I was watching my life with my father who didn't ever talk about his own life until the last years but we got a chance at the end and it gave me some measure of peace that we at least had those moments.",1423180800,,748,4.290780141843972

6145685,5,B00H9L28OO,A complete surprise! Poignant is the only word I have to describe Nebraska! Relatable no matter where you may live or have grown up as there are threads of personal moments and memories woven across the generations into pieces of one's family fabric. I kept expecting a strong slide into sadness from which there would be no sustainable return or that the pace would slow to a traffic jam at rush hour. But the flow kept me gliding smoothly along and the dance toward tears spun gracefully out of range. The cinematography and acting were superb. and I am in the process of purchasing the Nebraska soundtrack as soon as I submit this review.,1421366400,,641,4.631578947368421

6145687,3,B00H9L28OO,"If one could sum up the movie Nebraska in a single word, that word would be tepid.  This movie tells the story of an old man, Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) who becomes confused by a junk mail letter which says he won $1,000,000.  Woody Grant, doesn't have a driver's license and so his son is persuaded to drive Woody to Lincoln, Nebraska to collect his prize.  Along the way, misadventure-involving alcohol abuse and Woody's age related confusion-cause the Grants to stay with relations in Hawthorne, Nebraska.  Hawthorne is the origin of Woody and his wife and they still know everyone and everybody.  Rumors spread that Woody is now rich and various friends, family, and others move in to cash in on favors.

The movie has little in the way of salt-of-the-Earth wisdom as one would suspect going into it based on the marketing.  If anything, the film should launch some sort of literary review as to why rural Americans went from being the loveable bunch in The Andy Griffith Show to the un-lovable characters in this film.  If anything this movie is a film which distorts Mid-Westerners to a caricature that one imagines Frenchmen or snobbish Manhattan dwellers think of the American Heartland and its people. Perhaps the worst caricature/character is Kate Grant (June Squibb).  She only discusses sex and has no wisdom to convey about sex and the production of children.  The caricature/character is merely vulgar.

The movie does get the scenery of the Eastern edge of the Great Plains correct, and the accents, costumes, and sets are well rendered.  In short, this movie is an over-rated expression of snobbishness.",1421280000,,1617,4.92619926199262
6145688,5,B00H9L28OO,"Nebraska is a beautifully written story, filmed in black and white and photographed  in such a way that you feel the winter cold of Montana and all the way to Nebraska. Bruce Dern is one of the finest actors ever on the screen. In Nebraska he wrongly believes he has won one million dollars because of what he read in a magazine ad.  He planned on walking to Lincoln to collect his winnings when one of his sons agrees to drive him even though he knows his elderly dad has not really won.  As his extended family and friends learn of what they believe is his good fortune, they  all find reasons why they are entitled to a portion of his winnings. Bruce Dern's wife easily walks away with every scene she's in. This movie made me laugh and cry.

6145991,5,B00H9L28OO,"I hesitated watching this movie for awhile because what I saw in the previews reminded me too much of my parents. Sure enough, some of the circumstances and traits of the elderly couple remind me a lot of my parents. The situation which David (Forte's character) finds himself in, having to care for his father Woody who has dementia (an award-worthy portrayal by Dern) is extremely difficult. What is amazing is that the movie manages to take such a depressing subject matter and still come out hilarious with some wonderful dialogue and great delivery. Almost the entire cast delivers a great performance, led by Bruce Dern and June Squibb who really come across as an old married couple. The only exception is the actress who plays David's ex-girlfriend - her performance (thankfully very brief) is almost at the level of a bad TV movie. The writing is great and even the black and white cinematography is effective when showing the fields and the old house they visit.

The starting point of the plot is that Woody believes he has won a million dollars when he receives a letter from a sweepstakes publishing house. His immediate family knows better but his son David decides to humor him and help him get to Nebraska to claim his winnings. He does it in order to try to connect with his father. What follows is an emotional road trip filled with reunions with family and friends. The main family characters are each sympathetic, making it easy to feel for their plight and cheer for them such as when some relatives and supposed friends try to take advantage of Woody. The emotional connection to the characters and the wonderful humor throughout makes this a highly recommended movie!",1420156800,6,1690,4.787671232876712
6145992,4,B00H9L28OO,Oddly compelling story of a son and his difficult non-communicative elderly father. The son tries desperately to connect with his father but the man is too closed off and is not able. The father barely acknowledges anyone in his life and his motives are a mystery. Many men of that era are men of few words and never talk about feelings. This film is well done and the dynamics between the characters if oddly mesmerizing.,1420156800,,422,4.64

6146082,2,B00H9L28OO,"Nebraska the film and Nebraska the state: Both well suited to black and white. Buce Dern and Stacy Keach were both good to see again in much older guise than last I saw them. Their and other's performances were VERY GOOD, but it's hard to stop a ships anchor from plunging, once it gains momentum.
The movie as a whole was a 115 minute traffic jam of cliches about an aging America. It hits too close to home to many people making it something they can't enjoy. Sort of like staring death in the face. This is more of an art film as opposed to a mainstream picture.

It was hilarious at points and found myself laughing out loud a number of times. It was so well acted by all the major players (especially Bruce Dern, Will Forte, June Squibb, and Bob Odenkirk) that I wondered why it did not win some of the academy awards it was nominated for.
My wife at first baulked that it was filmed in Black and White but we both quickly got over this and thought it beautifully matched the mood and scenery that you would expect from its namesake.

6146271,5,B00H9L28OO,"This movie builds at a very leisurely pace and the use of the black and white film makes it feel almost dark and out of place--from another time.

Bruce Dern does a perfect job in this role and I came to love his character.  To me, this movie is about what our children don't know about their parents and the lives they have lived.  Children make judgments based on what they see at the present moment without much thought as to how or why their parents acted as they did.  Without knowing their parents history, they really have no idea who they are and how they got to where they are.

In this film the two sons begin to understand their father's story and appreciate his life in a wholly new way and they find a new way to love and support their father.  It's really quite touching.

This movie addressed many things of the human condition, dealing with someone who is losing their faculties, family, greed, how people use each other to get something, and how the vulnerable get prayed upon. However it looked at how family will pull together to look out for each other.
Being done in black and white was also a stroke of genius, it never bothered me once.
The soundtrack was perfect for this movie, I even purchased it.
This is not necessarily a feel good movie, and I would suggest you be in the mood for a drama with a few comedic moments, yet it is worth the viewing.",1419465600,,641,4.487179487179487

If you like these two movies, you will certainly like Nebraska. Bruce Dern, June Squibb and Will Forte performed excellently.  June made me laugh especially the grave scene.  Will Forte did a great job of acting, not his usual comedian style performance like on Saturday Night Live.  Bruce Dern's performance encapsulated an elderly man on the edge of dementia.

It's for sure not an action packed thriller or an average love story and may not appeal to the average person because it moves along slowly, but it has an endearing message and does depict the false hopes that happens to many seniors when they open a sweepstakes letter addressed to them and making it appear that they have won a huge sum of money. My family whole-heartedly can relate to this movie, because it was difficult convincing my own mom when she became adamant that she had won a sweepstakes lottery.  One can tell that this was not a huge budget movie but it is very well done and I personally enjoyed watching it twice, once with my wife and again with my mom who also enjoyed.",1418947200,,774,4.3310344827586205

It was not a comedy in the belly laugh sense, more the chuckle that you have as you watch things unfold.

6146844,4,B00H9L28OO,"Folks, Auteurs like my man Alex Payne are a rarity. Nebraska isn't his finest (look at Sideways, About Schmidt, and The Descendants), but it does what every other Payne film does. It hooks you into thinking it's all quirky comedy and then it lays your heart open. Right In The Feels, as the kids say.
There is a realistic grittiness to Payne's films. Even when typically ""pretty"" actors are cast, they are often photographed and directed in a way that strips them of the false gloss usually given. The stories being told are also part of that process. Don't look for airbrushed faces, swooning in perfect sunsets and romantic impossibilities. These are the families next door, our in-laws, and our co-workers. They are us. Every character in every Alexander Payne film reminds me of the reality of our human condition. Yes, it is cringe-worthy, even painful to watch at times. But once he hooks us in, Payne always shows his hand in the end. This is a guy who is ok with who we all are in our beautiful wretchedness. Give Nebraska a watch and let me know what you think (after you call your family to say you love them).",1418688000,,1120,4.577114427860696

6146879,5,B00H9L28OO,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Bruce Dern was completely convincing as a victim of senile dementia, for which he was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar in 2014, but lost to Matthew McConaughey, in Dallas Buyers Club. However, in 2013 at the Cannes Film Festival, he was nominated for and won the Best Actor category; certainly well deserved.

I have personal experience with Alzheimer's disease with a few of my relatives and Bruce Dern's portrayal of ""Woody"" was spot on. His wife, played by June Squibb, was just as cranky as can be, yet still the love was theredeep and true. Squibb, is mostly annoyed with Woody because he believes a letter from a magazine sweepstakes which says he won a million dollars and he doesn't trust the mail to deliver that much money, so he escapes his home on foot to Nebraska to collect his winnings. Everyone who reads the letter knows it is a con job, but Woody and his unbreakable belief that he actually won.

When Woody and his youngest son arrive in Nebraska, they visit relatives over the weekend because the Magazine Office in Lincoln, Nebraska will not be open until Monday. At first the family is very happy for Woody and then the thought of all that money starts to turn the heads of his friends and relatives. The movie makes a serious statement about how money can turn the souls of humans dark.

The youngest son, who puts his life on hold to drive his father to Nebraska, sometimes learns more than he wanted to know about his parents. He also realizes he is probably spending the last of his father's quality time with him on this trip. He does everything he can to make his father's fantasy come true. This film would be best enjoyed with your adult children and may even get conversations started that everyone hates to have with their parents, but nonetheless, must take place.",1418601600,,1829,4.621538461538462

This movie made me laugh out loud. I have to admit I'm a huge Bruce Dern fan all the way back to his spaghetti western days. Stacy Keach has a small role as a jerk but played it very well. June Squibb was so damn funny ... Priceless!!
I know shooting in B&W is avant garde and trendy these days.... Meh, I can take it or leave it. The humor isn't always in your face... sometimes it's subtle.

6147375,4,B00H9L28OO,This was a really good movie done in black and white.  Black and white being the only con.  I don't think it added to the movie much.  My complaint is simply Amazon Prime.  This movie is 1 hour and 54 minutes and it took me over 2 1/2 hours to watch because of the buffering!  Reason I say that.... I can watch from beginning to end with a popular competitor without a single interruption.  I love Amazon but my brand new 55' Panasonic came preloaded for Prime Instant Movies.  Got the TV last September.  It took until this month for Amazon to update the app.  I was so excited to see it had updated and then my bubble burst when all the buffering started.

I thought the movie did a great job of capturing pretty much every small town personality possible, from the overly friendly gentleman at the bus stop to the ""business tycoon"" that thinks he's all-it because he makes a little bit more money than everyone else. It was fun watching and trying to place people I knew into each role. Bruce Dern had some of the most convincing acting I've ever seen, really remarkable performance.

6147426,5,B00H9L28OO,"I finally got to watch this yet another great movie from Alexander Payne. It started off a bit slow, but gradually picked up the pace and had a great ending. Bruce Dern and Squibb clearly have stolen the show. I particularly liked the bit in the cemetery, where Ms. Squibb gives a colorful description of her husband's extended family!! I was cracking. What starts of as a quest by a father son duo,turns into a family's journey tracing back their family ties and roots with a small rural town they once lived in. This movie subtly brings out the darker side in people, once the element of money becomes the common denominator and how it can change the equation be it family or friends. The climax was definitely touching. A must watch for all Alexander Payne fans out there. You will not regret it a bit!

I have been a big time fan of Mr. Payne's  movies over all these years and boy I am yet to be disappointed. Anybody not familiar with his works, I suggest 2004 movie ""Sideways"" starring Paul Giamatti and Virginia Madsen in lead roles. It is a small little gem of a movie that is worth watching.",1417651200,,1101,4.445544554455446

And when Amazon (or my wi fi connection) crashed, just 20 minutes from the end, terminating this torturous journey, I was elated to jump out of this car and abandon this tedious journey, never looking back.

6147576,5,B00H9L28OO,"Best movie of 2013. The cast was superb. Bob Nelson's screenplay was remarkable. Bruce Dern as Woody Grant received numerous awards and critical accolades for his deeply moving portrayal of Woody the adventurous, cantankerous, and lovable main character. Will Forte as David Grant, Woody's adorable, sensitive, and empathetic son won the National Board of Review best supporting actor award with Dern who won for best actor. June Squibb as Kate Grant, Woody's incredibly honest, hilarious, and ultimately loving wife was simply a ""knock out."" The movie didn't really get interesting for me until Kate arrived in Hawthorne by bus. Kate's dialog and demeanor were amazing. She reminded me of my 90 year-old mother with her razor-sharp wit and humor. Bob Odenkirk as older brother Ross, was also good especially when he stepped up to fight his cousin Cole played by Devin Ratray. David and Ross mistaken attempt to steal an air compressor from a neighbor's barn was one of the funniest scenes in movie history. Stacey Keach as Ed Pegram was so authentic that it was hard to recognize him. All of the supporting cast members were believable and interesting.  Phedon Papamichael's black and white cinematography was sublime. I have enjoyed all of Alexander Payne's movies, but this was one of my all-time favorites.",1417478400,,1310,5.121495327102804

I loved the story line (my stepfather, too, thought he had won a million dollars in his old age; it is apparently a very common fantasy in dementia), but the main event here is to see Bruce Dern finally stand center stage in a role that showcases his many talents as an actor.

There are parts of it .... the dysfunction in the family, the uneasy relationship (or more accurately the lack of relationship) between father and son, the look at how greedy and cruel people can be......  that will leave you with a sense of unease.  But still, I loved it.  not because of the redemptive ending, but rather because of the truth of the portrayals along the way. Full of really incredible moments. In fact, maybe Bruce Dern's best performance ever, even if it surely has him delivering the least dialog.  Will Forte was perfect as the son.  Not the familiar comedic Will Forte, but a character from somewhere else within him.  Makes me anxious to see him given other dramatic roles to chew on.  Beautifully photographed,

David Grant (Forte): How did you and mom end up getting married?
Woody Grant (Dern): She wanted to.
David Grant: And you didn't?
Woody Grant: I figured, what the hell.

Despite his cranky old demeanor and having dementia, Dern manages to be a likable character. His son provides crucial support to his father and shows some heartfelt love by allowing his father to come across as a real winner by the end of the film. The film tells us a lot about the meaning of unconditional love and the ending is very satisfying and uplifting.

It is also shot in black and white and is as far away from the shallow blitzkrieg, action packed comic book movies as a film can get.  Bruce Dern is very good and I kept telling myself this is the same guy from ""Coming Home"" and the guy who killed John Wayne in ""The Cowboys"".  He deserved the Oscar nomination.  Every character is interesting and as you watch the film if some of the characters do not remind you of your own relatives, then you have a unique family.

At first I wondered why it was in black and white since it wasn't shot in any stylized way (like film noir).  Also, since shooting color is no less expensive (at least using pro video), it didn't make any sense financially either.  Then I realized why as I watched it.  Black and white made the whole thing look even dingier and more dreary.  And it worked.  All the winter grayness was a character in the film.  I don't think it set out to be depressing, and may not be so for people that can't relate to such a family, but for me, it was like a dreadful walk down memory lane.",1417219200,,697,4.111111111111111

6148006,4,B00H9L28OO,"The film captures sadness in an old man and that feeling permeates the film throughout. It seeps into the landscape and it is the fabric of life in the people he once knew. The promotional letter, a supposed win of one million dollar, fine print notwithstanding  propels the old man into a fanatical quest for his money,but  for what reasons other than the wish to buy a truck and a compressor, we are not sure. Not that is, until the last scene where something akin to pride, achievement, and a moment of fulfillment passes fleetingly over the old man's face. Without rage or anger, without speech-making about the lost American dream, ""Nebraska"" is that story. In our America, greed underlies the smile of greeting. Friends and family want to dip their fingers in the honey pot of gold. ""What's in it for me""  sets the smile, and the handshake in motion. We hold our friendships dear, our families close, but in ""Nebraska"", these ties are nothing more than myth. We hold on to the dream. It feels better to be an empty room with others than alone in that room. Better the American dream than the reality of the very little, and very brief lives that pass in a void scattered with the toys that keep us occupied - until the Interstate ends. The film shows us a landscape of our lives as no more than an empty field. Nothing much grows and ""Nebraska"" strips away the hope that anything will come of what we plant. We are lead across the Interstate of life very gently, so that we don't break out in the cold sweat of recognition. We don't know these people. We are meant to keep our distance. Bruce Dern takes us on the journey. He doesn't tell us what he thinks. He doesn't tell us what he remembers. Who we meet are chessboard pieces that are in his way. He wants to journey on. And this he does relentlessly. The old man scarcely speaks, but, in his silence, there is eloquence. In his determination is a demand that one promise be kept and this one winning ticket be cashed. This is not a hopeful story, nor one with a happy ending. But it is a story told exceedingly well. A moment of pride may well be worth a pointless journey on an elusive highway to collect the big win that never was.

6148174,5,B00H9L28OO,"It has been a while since I have seen Bruce Dern, but if I had not known he was in this, I would not have recognized him.  Dern has been one of Hollywood's best actors for a long time.  When an actor is able to portray a character and you cannot ""see"" the actor no longer, then they have done their ""acting job"".

This turned out to be a feel-good movie, with lots of humor, laughs, touching moments.  The story focuses on an aging alcoholic who was never really there for his two sons.  His wife is quite fed up with him, always threatening to put him in the nursing home.

Like some stubborn old coots, the old man believes he has won a Sweepstakes prize of $1,000,000.  When the son tries to convince him otherwise, he resorts to driving his father to Nebraska.

Nebraska?  Didn't know people live there.  Here's the core of the story, the family resides here, including people the old man knew years ago.  The town believes he is a rich man now.

Filmed in black and white, one gains a sense of Americana, nostalgia, and the innocence of a time period.

This is funny, heartwarming, sad and endearing.  This film is an Independent Gem!  .......Rizzo",1416873600,,1153,4.423809523809524

Maybe it helps being from the mid-west but I found the character to be true and believable and very relatable.  It is nice to see Bruce Dern on screen again. I always like his characters and his movies. But I never cared for Stacy Keach and he has a fair amount of screen time. Filmed in black and white for affect.,1416873600,,468,4.4941176470588236

I feel this movie provides a pretty good example of white people (I'm white so don't get your knickers in a twist). Their relationships, what is important to them and generally speaking, how they handle things. Happy. Sad, Funny, Serious. It's all here. It seems to move slow but I think the director is trying to pace you since these folks come from 'slow' places. It comes off boring at the beginning but once you're plugged in, you won't walk away. Dern's acting is excellent. I think the wife does an excellent job as well. Everybody else is ""B"" grade but again, it could be what the director was aiming for. They are not complex folks you're watching; no polish is needed. The ending is not to be missed and may actually surprise you, as it did me. I really enjoyed it.",1416787200,,863,4.4

His equally difficult wife refuses to to take him and after a couple of abortive attempts to walk there, his youngest son loads Woody - who has a drink problem - into the car. On the way they pass through the town where the dad grew up and where all his old friends and relatives are very happy to hear of his fortune. Several of them, including his former partner, think they are in fact owed a bunch of cash for favours they allegedly did Woody many years ago. As the movie wends towards the climax we (and the son) learn more and more about what made Woody the man he is. Dern really is magnificent and it's no surprise he was nominated for an Oscar. I give it four stars rather than five because the loose ends are tied up a bit too clumsily but that doesn't detract from a great film. It's shot in black and white, which only helps accentuate the bleakness of the landscape.",1416787200,,1151,4.333333333333333

The cast is wonderful, especially Dern's sharp-tongued wife and his two likeable sons, one a success, one a loser-at-love. It is a real treat to see the great Stacy Keach in this film as Dern's former business partner, and there is a hilarious scene involving a long overdue, borrowed air-compressor.  The film's bleak portrayal of life in a depressed town in middle-America is truly eye-opening, and will surely make those with 1st hand experience groan in both sympathy and disgust.",1416700800,,568,5.163043478260869

6148337,4,B00H9L28OO,The story centers on a man and his son while we learn a little about the man's story and family. The scenery was pretty depressing. Is that really what Nebraska looks like? I don't really understand why it's in black & white. It only added to the feelings of depression. Bruce Dern is the main character and not a very likable guy. There are times when I wanted to see his wife locked up in a closet and times when I wanted to hug her. Scenes of bravado and mischief made me want to stand up and hurrah. His son takes him to Nebraska against his good judgment and the objections of his mom and brother. But he is the hero of the movie. He is proof that a good person can come from a man who was mostly unhappy all of his life and showed little interest or caring for his family. I had mixed emotions watching this movie. But I'd recommend it simply because it's a good story.,1416700800,,875,4.152941176470589

6148360,4,B00H9L28OO,"I've enjoyed watching Bruce Dern from his early B movie motorcycle or sci-fi films, many of which are now considered very campy.  He brings it to the big screen again deftly playing a grumpy old guy with signs of dementia on a ridiculous quest.  His loving son helps and gets to know his father in ways that can't be bought.  And we get to know the rest of his family's true colors when they think the old guy might soon be rich and again when they realize he won't be.  A good film.  Wait until the DVD is cheap, however.",1416700800,,522,4.18

It is in black and white instead of color, slow-paced instead of fast, and deals with honest, real relationships instead of fisticuffs and guns.  It is almost ""slice of life"" but infused with compassion and a kind of dry sense of humor that always appeals to me.  I was engaged from the very first scene and didn't want to miss a single word anyone said because the script was so carefully crafted.  The acting was superb.  Every character was so down to earth and believable that I felt like I was witnessing real people caught in unguarded moments rather than actors in a movie.

6148988,2,B00H9L28OO,"I am jealous of all the people who gave this a five star review: I wanted to see a great movie and I've loved all of Payne's previous movies. But Nebraska lacked his usual frisky pace, interesting plot, and--most of all--a feeling like the director had affection toward his characters. His portrayal of older people, while meant to be funny, is shallow at best, and possibly insulting. Normally, I enjoy B&W films, but in this case I felt like the director went that way to make a dull film seem arty. If it hadn't been for Payne's rep, we would have turned this one off halfway through--maudlin, predictable, annoying, and boring.

What I do find interesting is that June Squibb, the shrieking actress that played Dern's wife, is also the woman who played Jack Nicholson's wife in About Schmidt. In Schmidt, the wife dies in the first reel, sending Jack on a cross country journey to find his kids. In Nebraska the wife, Squibb, lives, and the husband takes a journey into his aloholic delusions--and still manages to reconcile with his kid.",1416096000,6,1042,4.725274725274725

But if you're tired of all those special FX and fast-paced stories, and if you're into a great story, wonderful cinematography in B&W, an easy moving, intelligent story like I happen to enjoy - try this Bruce Dern movie.  It's about getting older and not having much to show for all those years that have passed, about how age won't allow a guy a chance to do what he just might *need* to do., dammit!

6149011,5,B00H9L28OO,"The premise of the movie is an aging father (Bruce Dern), who receives a sweepstakes letter in the mail stating he won the million dollars, ala Publishers Clearinghouse.  He can't drive anymore, so he's walking there the first few times.  He lives with sharp tongued but hilariously real aging wife.  He has two sons.  One is a newscaster (played by Bob Odenkirk, lawyer on Breaking Bad) local news, with a family of his own we don't see.  The other lives in town working as a salesman at an electronics store (SNL's Will Forte).  He gets most of the ""help with your dad calls,"" from his mother (June Squibb).  He finally agrees to take his father to ""give his mom a break"", and also ""to get out of town.""

What ensues is a father/son road trip through small town America Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota, and Wyoming.  Though shot in black and white , the cinematography is excellent.  The cemetery scene for a minute had me thinking a zombie from Night of the Living Dead was going to show up for a second.  Also the small town feel, of older decaying buildings, as many of younger generations have flexed for opportunities in the cities.  And the older generation from the small towns, their discussions with their out of town family, was very reminiscent of what a city person encounters when they visit their small town, living in the country family.

The feeling of the movie was raw and real, depicting the current situation of our country, economically, physically, visually, and sociologically.  It was so familiar.  It reminded me of my husband and his father, and could be many families in this country.  Loved it.",1416009600,,1623,4.702127659574468

6149013,5,B00H9L28OO,"I really like this film. In fact, the more I watch it, the more I like it. I'm not much for writing a review today, so here's a summary

Gives an appreciation for what happens to people as the years go by.
Family dynamics: learning new things about your family, how things hurt but your family is your family after all.
How things happen, the results of a life lived, mistakes made.
Understanding and compassion without sentimentality.
Road trip! (i'm fond of road trip movies)
Worth the watch just to see June Squibb's tirade at the Uncle and Aunt's house.
Gorgeous soundtrack.
Stunning performance by Bruce Dern. He IS Woody.
Americana: Wherever you grew up, there is a flavor and memory attached, and though you may not have grown up in the Midwest, you know what the images mean - memory, experience, loss, life, the passing of time, the ""what-ifs"". Revisiting a place makes us revisit our past. We all make mistakes. our lives don't work out the way we expected. Sometimes we don't cope very well with what life throws at us, but that's Life!

Great movie. Give it a shot. Just watch.

I enjoyed this movie immensely. The story is slow moving but not boring. You're not wondering how this is going to end; it truly is just about the journey.

There are no real surprises along the way.

But that makes this all the more amazing as a film . . . a story with no real drama mesmerizes. Now that says a lot about the heart of the story and the phenomenal cast of characters.

I highly recommend this movie.",1415923200,3,644,4.297520661157025

Bruce Dern has really done a fantastic job of presenting to the watcher just how an older person might handle the world he or she finds themselves in.  I would bet that any of you out there in the public can also identify with the feisty and sharp witted wife of Bruce Dern's character.  We have all had grandma's like her.  (Or mothers in law) She was a bossy type but after watching this movie for awhile I determined that she had to be that way to hold that family together. She understood just what was happening to her husband. She loved him and stuck by him and knew what kind of man he was.  He was always a sucker for a sad story and gave away so much of his own wealth that it ruined him in the end.  No wonder this movie got so many Academy Award recommendations.

The downside is the completely negative portrayal of the elderly which, I'm afraid, may have the net effect of playing into and enhancing an already existent  general societal discrimination against that segment of the population. The stereotype of senior citizens as nothing more than a bunch of spaced out ""old fools"" certainly reinforces that perception, especially in that there wasn't a single elderly person portrayed in a manner otherwise.  The majority of senior citizens I have relationships with are still active and mentally sharp in their seventies and eighties.

This movie, shot in black and white, featuring a Subaru and some incredibly old looking actors, smoked all of them, due to the symmetry of the story arc and the relentless grit of the actors.

He is a bit wiser than we may actually think. He wants a truck and an air compressor. He's at that stage where it really and finally means something. I grew up watching Bruce Dern from the early 60s in films and on television. He's slightly older than me, but I kind of figure what's going on in his head. Mark Orton's music floats around in my head and all the black and white visual in NEBRASKA come to mind.",1414540800,5,851,4.163636363636364

Scenes were cut off like we were supposed to be on commercial break but this was not a TV show and not intended to be produced as a movie made for TV, either.  It was rather crass and in poor taste, too, which added to its disjointed nature.  This is not what I would consider a ripe tomato and not my cup of tea.",1413504000,,354,3.9027777777777777
6149217,3,B00H9L28OO,"I like Alexander Payne's directing style with films that take us on journeys such as The Descendants and Sideways, but this journey was cold, dark, depressing, slow, and boring.  The casting fit well, but the story lacked energy and progression, rather it was stagnant and maybe that was the message of the story?  The opening was engaging and understanding showing the Father constantly wandering off from his home in Montana and trekking on foot to Nebraska to collect his prize money.  Will Forte's character recently broke up with his girlfriend of 2 years and was dealing with babysitting his Father that had major symptoms of Dementia/Alzheimer's.  Out of respect,  the son decided to embark on a journey with is Father to Nebraska in order to satisfy his delusional and ailing Father's wishes to collect 1 million dollars.

I was looking forward to a deep and engaging relationship between Father and Son during the journey to Nebraska , however that wasn't on the agenda of the script, rather as a viewer I witnessed a boring and slow journey going nowhere.  The film had potential of bridging the relationship gap between Son, Mother, and Father, or at least giving the viewer an idea as to why the Father is a drunkard.  Instead, the script focused on the pit-stop into Hawthorne, Nebraska (Father's hometown) highlighting past relationships with friends, former lovers, and family members that got word of his million dollar adventure and wanted compensation for their commitments and affairs with the Father.  The only highlight of the movie was the scene centered around the son entering the newspaper office and reminiscing of his Father to a woman that was his former lover.  The movie briefly attempted to justify as to why the Father was a drunkard, but it didn't delve deep enough to convince the viewer (not me).  The one character that brought credibility and depth to the movie was Ed Pegram (Stacy Keach).  The scene that stood out the most to me was when Ed was mocking Woody at the bar after getting hold of his million dollar prize-winning letter and Woody entered the bar with his son to collect the letter and Woody's son punched Ed in the face.

The film had all the ingredients to create a deep story of abandonment, love, family, addiction, and perseverance, instead we got a film centered around a drunkard father suffering from Alzheimer's whom needs help, especially after the journey to and from Nebraska.",1413504000,,2439,4.905109489051095

The plot of the movie is pretty simple, an old man (Woody) receives one of those fliers in the mail that we all get that says you may have won millions of dollars and tries to get you to buy magazines or books.  His family tells him he hasn't won but he is dead set on getting to Lincoln Nebraska to claim his prize money.  His son David decides to humor him and takes him to Lincoln to prove to him there is no money waiting for him.  Along the way he visits his home town and everyone hears he may be a millionaire.  Then the vultures come out of the woodwork insisting that he owes them money from the old days.

Eventually he gets there and realizes what everyone has been telling him all along, there is no prize money and that he wasted his time.  but we find out that all he really wanted to do was to have something to leave his children when he dies, specifically a new truck.  So he David goes and buys a new truck but puts his father's name on the title and lets him drive it through his old hometown.  Many people see him and his new truck and are impressed.  He drives out of town and then lets his son drive him home.

The film is low budget and it is in black and white but it's a feel good movie that we all can relate to.  We all have relatives that drive us crazy and they sometimes demand that we do things for them, but we know they love us and we love them.  Plus we all want to have something to leave our surviving relatives when we pass away and we all want to feel kinda like a big shot and impress everyone in the town where we grew up.  So honestly I think everyone could enjoy this movie.

But when the movie came out and they kept running trailers for it on TV, I knew it was not performing up to their expectations. For a reason!

Dull as dishwater. I could tell from Dern's many TV interviews he was certain he'd finally get the Oscar. No way! He didn't phone this performance in, he snoozed it in! June Squibb injected a tiny bit of life into this snoozefest, but her abrasive voice drove me nuts in minutes. If this is a first-rate script in Hollywood these days,us movie fans are screwed!! Also the way old people are depicted as mumbling old layabouts finishing out their time watching crap TV and cars going by was insulting.

BTW, this movie was shot in color. It ran on TV as B/W, then was immediately rerun in color. At least the color version has a breath of life in it.",1409616000,3,957,4.401129943502825

6149378,5,B00H9L28OO,"""Nebraska' is filmed in black and white, the choice of director, Alexander Payne. Bruce Dern stars magnificently as the irascible, contrary old man on a quest. He won best actor at the Cannes Film Festival. Jane Squibb stars brilliantly in her cranky but humorous and sharp-minded role as his wife. She was nominated for an Oscar as Best Supporting Actress. Alexander Payne won an Oscar for Best Director.

This is about a man in his early 80s seeking a reason to go on living. Like Ulysses, like Jason, he is on a quest to seek his fortune.  He is the American, mid-west questing hero. Along the way of his journey, he encounters the barriers which he must overcome to find his fortune and is finally successful. He may not even be aware that he has won something he never worked for, but he has won, and the story has a poignant and touching ending.

Director Alexander Payne chose to shoot this film in black and white. This evokes a feeling of nostalgia, a yearning for things past, and the flat landscape of Northern Nebraska does not lose anything from not being in brilliant colour. The landscape may be flat, dull and repetitive but it is important, for it is here that our food is grown. It is the breadbasket of the country. The inhabitants we meet along Willy Grant's journey may seem dull, eccentric and humorous with their country ways, but these are brave people who battle climate and market prices to eke out a living while growing our food. Often laughed at, they are the unsung heroes who give us our daily bread.

The movie opens with a shot of Willy Grant walking on the shoulder of a highway. He walks with bent back and quick step as if he is going to collapse under the weight of gravity, but his step is one of determination.. A police officer stops and asks him what he is doing. He lives in Billings, Montana, and he tells the officer that he is walking to Nebraska. He is taken to the police station and David (Will Forte) his younger son, is called to pick him up.

No one, not even his cranky, exasperated wife played by Jane Squibb, can talk him out of going on this journey. He has lost his driving license and no one will drive him to Nebraska, so he decides to walk.

The two sons discuss the situation. The older one thinks their father has Alzheimer's. The younger one does not think so. He believes that his father is seeking a purpose to go on living. During the conversation, the older son points out that their father has been a drunk who never paid attention to them whatsoever. This seems to be his excuse for not helping his father realize his quest.

Drunk and neglectful father or not, the younger son, David, finally decides to drive his father to Lincoln, Nebraska, so that Willy can realize his dream. It seems that Willy received one of those pseudo magazine subscription flyers which screams in bold letters: ""You  have won $1,000,000."" Willy doesn't read the finer print that says, ""If you have the winning numbers."" He assumes he has won and is on his way to Lincoln to collect the money.

When the younger son David can no longer talk any sense into his father, he agrees to take Willy to Lincoln. What happens on their journey is the bulk of the story. Staying for a day in Hawthorne, Nebraska (which my Nebraska-born husband tells me is a fictional town) Willy encounters his past and picks up his old habit of drinking excessively. When old-time friends and relatives find out he has won ""the lottery"", well, suddenly he has tons of friends and tons of family, all with their hands out.

His adventures include being robbed by his nephews, being hospitalized, from which he runs away, being humiliated in front of his former friends, being disappointed and finally, being vindicated through the exceptionally good graces of his son, David. The man who humiliates him is Ed Pegram, his former business partner, played well by actor Stacy Keach.

As the son, David, hears bits and pieces of his father's past, he becomes aware that Willy's life has not always been so mundane. He was shot down in Korea; he had a former love who never quite got over him; as well, it is said that he was in love with a ""half breed"" (so-called by Ed Pegram) and wanted to divorce his wife. But Ed says he talked Willy out of it, since in those days, divorce was a sin. Ed notes that, over the decades, ""God must have changed His mind.""

There are some marvelously humorous scenes with Jane Squibb as the long-suffering wife, as she visits a grave yard, and inadvertently becomes a party to a hilarious theft by her sons. She also protects her husband from some greedy relatives and gives them a comeuppance, complete with the F word, which shocks these straight-laced farmer types.

In Lincoln, Woody learns the truth of the scam and gets no money. The office person asks the son if he has Alzheimer's. The son says no - that he just believes what people tell him. She replies, ""That's too bad.""

David asks his father why he wants the money. He says - so that he can have a new pickup truck and leave something for his sons. David tells him that they don't need anything and why does he want the truck when he can't drive. Turns out he just wants it ""to have.""

On the way back to Montana, David makes a few choices which will enrich Woody' s life and his standing in his hometown of Hawthorne. Woody leaves the town with pride, not aware that he has, indeed, won the lottery.

To win the lottery is to get something one has not worked for. Woody has ignored his children and never loved his wife. He does not deserve to have such a loyal wife and he does not deserve to have his sons. He has not earned it.

But he has won. He has won the lottery of marriage and parenthood.  He has won the loyalty of his wife and in his son David, he has won solid gold devotion.

Without putting forth any effort, Willy has won the golden fleece of life.",1409270400,,5877,4.455307262569832

6149405,3,B00H9L28OO,"This is a slow moving story about an aged, burned out, demented alcoholic who travels with the help of his son to win ""the grand prize"" so he can buy a new truck, even though he has no license.  I believe it is characteristic of rural failing America.  It could be Nebraska or almost any other state that has a small town and farms.  His wife is shrewish, foul mouthed and proud of it but finally shows some concern for him near the end.  She has much more  fight in her than he ever had.  He is surrounded by a doltish and greedy family when they hear of his potential winnings.  It does have an interesting ending and perhaps you could call it inspirational from the actions of the son who traveled with him.  The son did grow up some during the film.  I cannot comprehend how this could be award worthy but it is a believable story about some Americans and their dreams. abilities, and how their lives end.  Death comes to us all in curious ways.

6149426,5,B00H9L28OO,"I'll be honest with you and say I had no interest in watching this movie and only ended up watching it because other people were.  Even as it started up I wasn't into it, didn't particularly like the father or his wife (especially her at the cemetery).  However as you got to know them a bit more through Woody's interactions with his frustrated son in conversations that consisted of a few words from his end, and for his wife later when she also journeys to their relatives' house in Nebraska and you realise how much she's stopped others from taking advantage of her nave and over trusting of the word of others husband, throughout their time together you get to really like them both.

I liked how the film used actors who looked like everyday people, most other films would have used good looking people for all the minor roles, especially younger characters. The older actors would have had spent time the beauty salon having their hair done, makeup on before filming but I liked how they all just looked like people you'd encounter in everyday life as well as people who are down on their luck and money and for some who spend too much of their time with a drink in their hand.  The film came across as believable because there are people like all the characters in the real world.  There are people who like to live vicariously through other people's success (as meagre as moving away and starting a hairdressers is compared to unemployment in a dying small rural town), as the relatives do in this one and claim they helped them there, when in reality they took more from Woody and his wife than they received.  I thought the interactions between family members were realistic, sure slow and low on conversation at times but again that's reality.

The film also highlights how people's attitude changes towards others when they think there is something they can get from them.  The only thing that was a bit over the top was the ending, it relied on certain people walking out a door at the right time to come off.  Also I thought there would have been less of a simple acceptance scene in Lincoln by someone who has believed so vigorously they have won a million dollars, when those around them that care about them the most have told them they haven't the entire film.",1408147200,,2279,4.5661764705882355

Not in this.  There's isn't anyway to describe how utterly boring and flat this movie is, especially with the rosy, skewed reviews and comments others have made; I'm not sure if agreeing with the TV reviewers makes them feel like they're on the correct side of things or what, but what a bunch of utter nonsense.  When you see a movie in black and white, you automatically think it's going to be depressing and unexciting; this is, without a bump.  The retro black and white deal was supposed to enhance this movie I guess, showing how blatantly depressing it was, and thus making it more real.  But all it did was poor mud on an already doddering corpse.  It's slow, plodding, hogwash drivel.",1407715200,4,868,4.490445859872612
6149444,5,B00H9L28OO,"""Nebraska"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: After receiving a sweepstakes letter in the mail, a cantankerous old alcoholic thinks he's struck it rich and wrangles his son into taking a road trip across the heartland of America to claim the fortune.

The cast led by Bruce Dern (as Woody Grant), Will Forte (as David Grant), June Squibb (as Kate Grant), Stacey Keach (as Ed Pegram) & Bob Odenkirk (as Ross Grant) is brilliant. The directing by Alexander Payne is brilliant. The story & screenplay by Bob Nelson is brilliant.

The music by Mark Orton is brilliant. The cinematography by Phedon Papamichael is brilliant. The film editing by Kevin Tent is brilliant. The casting by John Jackson is brilliant. The production design by Dennis Washington is brilliant. The art direction by Sandy Veneziano is brilliant. The set decoration by Fontaine Beauchamp, set designs by Ahna Packard, set dressings by Chad R. Davis, Lora Davis, Mark Hanks, Joey Lynch, Greg Rohde, Christopher L. Williamson & Carole Zacek is brilliant. The costume design by Wendy Chuck is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Erik Rondell is brilliant. The visual effects supervised by Lawson Deming & David Lingenfelser is brilliant.

This is a brilliant and entertaining film that is different (at least been shot differently in Black & White) and intriguing, as well as impressive and well-crafted. Bruce Dern gives an impressive performance as Woody Grant and leads a cast just as impressive as he is. Alexander Payne has directed another brilliant and well-done movie.

It studies characters, and many of them quite the characters, which too few movies attempt these days. Whether you like them or not (and I think they all grow on you through the film), these actors create some very real character types, and show them interacting in some very real ways. I guess overall I would say this is a journey of a son discovering his family, seeing them in new ways, ways he could not have seen at another age. Perhaps it's because of where I am in my life, seeing family through adult eyes, but the movie has a poignancy I would not have appreciated at an earlier age.

I recommended it to my brother in western Montana. He e-mailed back that he watched it on a flight returning from Maui, admitted that the sound was not very good on the plane. Said he was bored with it.

My husband watched it with me and he chuckled several times during the movie. That is an exception for him. He doesn't chuckle very easily. That means this is a good movie.

I gave it 4 stars because we both had issues with the foul language, but I understand it was part of the crustiness of Dern's character, but using the Lord's name in vain is never right.

Watch it yourself and decide. Don't be put off by the fact is is done in black and white. I think it adds to the picture. I applaud whoever decided to do it that way.",1405296000,2,863,4.088757396449704

6149719,5,B00H9L28OO,"This movie is my introduction to Alexander Payne and I am very impressed. With a simple story and homegrown, naturalistic performances from his actors, he created a movie that resonated with me in a strong way. NEBRASKA is about an old man, played by Bruce Dern, who gets one of those Publisher's Clearinghouse-type of letters in the mail and thinks he's won a million dollars. All he has to do is take the letter with him to Lincoln, Nebraska.  Eventually his son, played by Will Forte, decides to take him there in order to placate him. Along the way, he learns a lot about his family and grows closer with his father. Thematically, there's actually quite a bit going on beneath the surface. On one hand, you have subtle commentary on the illusory nature of the ""American dream"" but the film says more about finding a sense of purpose, self-worth and hope. And all of it is shown through the lens of small-town America. It wasn't anything profound, but it didn't need to be. It was simple, straightforward and did it in a very homey way. Speaking of ""homey."" I thought the character work here was as strong as anything I've seen in years. It's like the actors weren't even acting. They just seemed that real to me, like these were people I could have known when I was growing up. They had such an authentic manner of speaking, and a lot of what they said was endearing and comical, in equal measure. Though the entire cast gives great performances, the standouts were Bruce Dern (who got a well-deserved win at Cannes last year), Will Forte and (to my surprise, although I didn't have any expectations going in) June Squibb as Woody's long-suffering wife. She was a very no-nonsense woman who was given some brilliantly acerbic dialogue. Will Forte also gave a performance I'd never have expected from him, given the comic persona he honed on Saturday Night Live. And Bruce Dern, as usual, gave an outstanding performance as a man who finds something to live for, even if it's just in his mind. It's like this movie was the real-life crowning achievement that his character hopes for in the film. As far as other aspects go, the movie was shot in black-and-white, an appropriate choice in my opinion. It, along with the conservative camerawork, gave the movie a stripped-down feel which helped to bring out the story and dialogue more, as opposed to the imagery (which still looked fantastic). This movie was also all shot on location, and there was great work there as well. I also loved the score, which had a down-home feel to it with the minimalist strings and guitar (banjo?). Had I seen this last year, I'm positive this would have been my pick for the best one. Still, it's great that I've finally seen it and I look forward to digging further into Alexander Payne's back catalog. Highly recommended to any self-respecting cinephile.",1404777600,,2842,4.695390781563126
6149720,4,B00H9L28OO,"I would actually give it 3 1/2 stars if I could, but the system doesn't allow that.  I love Payne's films, but his last two--Nebraska and The Descendants--lack the sharp dialogue that characterizes his other work.  Maybe he needs Jim Taylor?  The story, however, is fantastic, and as a transplant to a small midwestern town similar to the one depicted in this film, I recognize these characters and buy the premise.  I do, however, get a little weary of Payne's reliance on local talent for many of the smaller roles.  Sometimes it works, but sometimes it doesn't--and when it doesn't, it just seems amateurish.  The leads, Bruce Dern and Will Forte, are outstanding in this film.  Dern takes the often-cliched stoicism of the midwestern farm boy to a level of humanity that I doubt many other actors could have done.  We feel his suffering and confusion about a world he grew up both trusting and despising.  June Squibb's foul-mouthed wife/mother was slightly overwritten, but we do feel sympathy for her by the end.  Woody/Dern, after all, was a bit of a ""dumb cluck"" and a prickly alcoholic to boot.  Like all of Payne's films (with the exception, perhaps, of Election) the pacing is slow, but that works well with this material.  It's how things move out here.",1404777600,,1265,4.778801843317972

6149794,5,B00H9L28OO,"Bruce Dern lands the role of a lifetime that he deserved. He was a very talented actor typecast as the bad guy. He was forever hated as the man who shot John Wayne in the back in 'The Cowboys' he received death threats, was beaten up by guys at bars and had an old woman hit him with a cane. In 'The Great Gatsby' he also played a very bad guy character who was hated. In this movie he is different though.

  It seemed in the part that there wasn't much to it other than an old man starting to slip into a condition. It's more than that though. It was a role played masterfully done by a great actor. Dern plays Woodrow T. Grant. A man who has flaws like us all. He wasn't the best father due to his alcoholism and the fact he is unhappy in his marriage. Dern becomes confused when he receives a publishers clearing house one million dollar award. He is determined to go claim his reward even if it means walking a great distance there.

  Will Forte plays his nice good son who takes care of him and decides to take him on a trip to Nebraska to live his fantasty to be happy. Forte gave an underrated performance that was massively snubbed by the Oscars. Will Forte is a really good actor and I felt like I knew his character. Having a very close relationship with my father made this movie very special to me. Forte really cares for his dad and despite his father's mistakes he doesn't pick on him or constantly throw it in his face like his brother and mother.

  June Squibb is a great actress and she was awesome in this. She can be nasty and mean but she stands up for the man she loves in Dern. Despite them not always getting along he was still a good man. Squibb is awesome she doesn't put up with any crap. She can be mean but she really does love her husband despite her early remarks in the film about putting him in a assisted living home. Dern is a generous man who is kind to his friends. He would never turn a friend down and it was his downfall. We also learn about his time in The War and we can see that affected him.

  Stacy Keach does a great job as an old sketchy shady former business partner of Dern who is eager to try to take advantage of Dern's newfound wealth. Keach makes up lies trying to say Dern owes him a lot of money. He's a real jerk and tells Forte he will bring his lawyer into the situation. Dern's family like Keach are after his money. It's nice to see a few people in the small town are actually happy for him. Angela Mcewan has a small but pivotal part in the story. She was a former girlfriend of Dern. She is a very sweet nice kind lady unlike Squibb. You get the feeling if Dern ended up with her things might have been different.

  One of my favorite parts of the movie is when Forte is confronting Dern about his drinking problems. Dern is in denial than finally says 'Godamnit you do what you want to do and so do I'. It was a great line and part in the film. My second part in the film is when Forte punches Keach and knocks him out for making fun of Dern and humiliating him in front of a crowd over the fake award money. The last scene in the movie is beautiful and powerful.

  This film it's not about an old man slipping it's a beautiful story of a son and father bonding and making peace towards the end of the father's life. The son learns a lot about his father he never knew and learns a lot about himself through the journey. After a lifetime of being pushed aside and disliked Dern gave a performance of a lifetime in a movie that will stick with you long after seeing it. Although Dern didn't get an Oscar I get the strong feeling he will get one before he passes on. I've rewatched the film many times. I strongly recommend it to everyone. Cheers and enjoy!!",1404432000,,3724,4.134349030470914

Don't write off the characters either at your first impression--they also conceal their depth and beauty beneath a worn veneer.

It's a journey that we can all relate to in one way or another. The performances were outstanding--Bruce Dern has never been better, and Will Forte as the younger son was perfectly cast--dreamy eyed, sensitive but only subtly comedic. And June Squibb as wife and mother is like a little tornado swirling through this delightful movie--she has some of the best lines ever written.

6149821,2,B00H9L28OO,"I loved Alexander Payne's ""Sideways"" and have enjoyed Bruce Dern in many fine performances, so I had high expectations for this film. The first disappointment was that is was shot in black and white.  I can understand the artistic choice, probably to show the bleakness of the characters' lives but the effect it had on me was that it just induced boredom.  Personally I find that area of the country very beautiful and I wish that the director had chosen to show us its beauty by filming in color.  It might have kept me watching longer than I did.

A parallel criticism is the characterization of the locals.  It's been a while since I've driven through this area but I doubt very much that the people are as crude and ignorant as this film depicts them.  I recall hearing Garrison Keillor, a  great story teller from the upper Midwest, say, that one must always have affection for his characters.  I think Payne should have heeded that advice.  These people are shown to be amusing in a condescending way, the way perhaps that some people from both coasts like to think of Midwesterners.  I feel insulted for them.  Dern plays one note...the befuddled, stubborn, drunken old guy.  He does it well but after five minutes of it, it was tiresome. . And he's not likable.  Likewise, the hapless son.  We just don't care about them.  Since it's a road trip  we can  expect that all conflicts will be dissolved en route and a happy ending is in store.  I read from other reviewers that there is a sweet ending here but that wasn't a good enough reason for me to sit through the dreariness to get to it.. I quit about half way through..

It was a good idea that could have made a genuinely touching film if it had been done more realistically, in a  less condescending tone.  I  hope Payne does better next time.",1403913600,,1808,4.498461538461538

He sets off to walk from Montana to Nebraska to collect his winnings. Bruce Dern is outstanding as Woody. The wife is hilarious, as a nagging, out-spoken old woman. The son decides to drive Woody to Nebraska with a stop at his hometown. As word gets around that Woody has ""won"" money, the woodpeckers come out of the forest to peck away at Woody's winnings. The story is very heartwarming, funny, and sad all wrapped up in one movie. Despite the black and white format, the story line overpowers that and you tend to see right past the lack of color. If you've ever wondered what would happen if you won a million dollars, this movie gives you a peek into what can happen. See it, you won't be sorry.

6149888,1,B00H9L28OO,"Payne did not write this script, which may explain why it is so far below the calibre of his other films. ""Nebraska's"" pacing was terrible, with scenes seeming to take much longer than they should have. The low-contrast black and white image was awful - representative of the bleak pointlessness of the characters' lives, but after 10 minutes, painful to look at. The point of the film, made in every scene, that the old man and his son are going to collect the nonexistent prize because he has nothing else to live for, became trite and exhausting in its endless repetition, and the sweet ending was hardly the payoff for the slogging it took to get there.

The sole redeeming feature was June Squibb as the mother, who stole every scene she appeared in. I can't help but wonder if Payne punched up her dialog himself. There were also a few strong scenes, like the one where she sets some distant family members straight on who really owes money to whom. This was a great example of how people remember the same events differently. It was more than cancelled out by other scenes, like the one where everyone is sitting around making inane conversation. ""Those cars would run forever."" ""What happened to it?"" ""It stopped running."" ""They'll do that."" In other films, Payne has shown himself to be a master of mindless yet fascinating dialog - this wasn't it.

Bruce Dern was utterly believable as the central character, but Will Forte, like many comic actors, may have bitten off more than he could chew. Comics tend to overact in dramatic roles (see: Robin Williams), or underact, as Forte does here. The character called for understated, seething resentment, on the verge of explosion, not simply understatement. Philip Seymour Hoffman, may he rest in peace, would have pulled it off. In fact, Hoffman would have been a much better choice - in black and white, he even looked similar enough to the other characters to pass as a family member. IMDB indicates that Bryan Cranston (""Breaking Bad"") was considered for the role; he would certainly have done a better job, although he probably looks about ten years too old to play the character.

The critical acclaim this film has garnered is mystifying; I can only conclude that the Academy appreciates black and white, as they went gaga several years ago over the mediocre and ridiculous ""The Artist."" If this was the only Alexander Payne film I had seen, I would not have bothered with the other ones, and would have missed the truly excellent ""Citizen Ruth,"" ""Election,"" and ""About Schmidt."" Those are highly recommended; ""Nebraska"" may be safely skipped unless you're a Payne completist or have committed to watching every film ever made.",1403395200,4,2690,4.830802603036877

6150027,5,B00H9L28OO,Touching story of a very human everyman.  The depiction of small town harshness was off the mark because of the urban elitist prejudices of the creators.  Been there; it's not like that.,1401926400,,186,4.78125
6150028,5,B00H9L28OO,Loved this film. It is such a good characterization of human nature. It is truly a delight to watch. It is so refreshing to see older people taken serious.

An addled old man (Bruce Dern) becomes convinced hes won $1 million after receiving a sweepstakes letter in the mail, all he has to do is travel to Nebraska to get it. His loving son (Will Forte) begrudgingly agrees to aid him in his mission.

What did we think?

Heres a movie where silence speaks volumes and the absence of color on screen ensures the rich narrative hues are not just present, but front and centre. The grayscale cinematography perfectly encapsulates the wide plains and narrow minds of middle America and the performances (especially from Dern and the usually-comedic Forte) are beautifully understated. Nebraska is proof that less is more and that even the most modest stories can be the most powerful. Youll leave the cinema with a silly grin on your face.",1401667200,,795,4.830882352941177

6150078,4,B00H9L28OO,"Nebraska has similarities to August: Osage County in its depiction of a culture by showing a family in its rawness.  It appears to be the story of Woody, a senile Korean War veteran who believes hes won a million dollars from a sweepstakes letter most people toss in the trash.  Woody insists on collecting the money personally, and on foot  from Billings, Montana to Lincoln, Nebraska.  As we meet the rest of the family the focus shifts to his son, David, who tries to deal with his fathers confusion and decides to drive him to Nebraska.  They stop by Woodys old home town on the way, and David discovers more deeply who his father is when he meets Woodys old business partner, an ex-girl friend, and interacts with old friends and extended family.  The folksy, no-nonsense, taciturn Midwesterners are perfectly portrayed in this black and white film, which ends with a just right touch of poignancy.",1401494400,,903,4.756410256410256

I always felt obligated to watch whatever I received from Netflix as quickly as possible so I could receive the next movie.

When is the last time you saw a static-long shot opening a film? The filming fits the script remarkably here, with tastes of sadness, humor, and human nature. Bruce Dern is a classic personality-actor, and is both believable and formidable in this portrayal of aging deterioration, which he somehow makes sympathetic yet in no way sappy.

Don't get me wrong, this was emotionally hard to watch at times, but Dern's performance was almost perfect.

6150215,5,B00H9L28OO,"'Nebraska' is one of those delightful movies that slowly pulls you into the characters as it unfolds.  It could have been a predictable, sweet, sentimental journey of an old man (Dern) who dreams of winning a million on one of those phony magazine subscription scams but fortunately it rises above this as you learn more about past of each character and how they react to each other today.  I enjoyed the way the Plains are shown in monochrome, the long stretches of highway and the flat landscape with isolated farmhouses that suddenly just appear.

Most of the story takes place in Hawthorne, a nicely chosen location that probably hasn't changed, like the inhabitants, for decades.  The clever script gives the ladies much more to say than the men, who mostly give  on one word answers, especially Woody Grant (Dern).  One of the standout performances is from June Squibb playing Mrs Grant, a feisty, very funny lady who tells it like she sees it.  There is also a gem of a vignette from Angela McEwan, her appearance only lasts a few minutes as Peggy Nagy, the local paper newspaper lady but the screen lights up with her performance.

Woody Grant has to get to Lincoln, Nebraska to collect his non-existant million and when he gets there I wondered how the movie would end, in fact it turns out to be a very credible finish to a wonderful road movie with a difference.",1400716800,,1373,4.668049792531121

My largest complaint is that many in the supporting cast -- the Nebraska residents -- seem very amateurish where more solid performances are required, Woody 's ex girlfriend for one.  She is a key character.",1400371200,2,366,4.671875

6150255,5,B00H9L28OO,"Filmed in glorious black-and-white, Alexander Paynes Nebraska captures the stark beauty of the American Midwest better than almost any movie I can remember. Set against the bleak backdrop of a high plains winter, its a road picture in which the characters travel through a seemingly unending expanse of lonely highways, leafless trees, peeling clapboard buildings and dusty, windswept streets in towns that haven't changed all that much since the 1950s. Like a land frozen in time, its a place where the tales are tall, the fields are parched, and the accents as flat as the limitless terrain. Filtered through a dreamy half-light, the imagery turns spareness and homogeneity into art.

The travelers in this case are the Grant family, formerly of Nebraska, now residents of Billings, Montana. Woody is the patriarch of the group whos convinced that hes won a million dollars in what everyone else acknowledges is nothing more than a marketing scam designed to rope in newspaper and magazine subscriptions. Woody, however, is dead-set on traveling to Lincoln to pick up his prize. As a means of both humoring him and getting him to shut up about it, his younger son, David, agrees to drive Woody to the state capital, stopping off to visit some of the relatives and old friends who still live in the town where the old man grew up, married and started a family. Eventually, Davids mom and older brother join them for the impromptu reunion that results from the visit.

With an Oscar-nominated screenplay by Bob Nelson, Nebraska is extremely perceptive about the complex dynamics that make up parent/child relationships, especially when the parent is a cantankerous alcoholic who may just be slipping into early-stage dementia and the child a mild-mannered, dutiful adult who seems to be using his own parents less-than-ideal marriage as an excuse to avoid taking the matrimonial plunge himself. Yet, for all the seeming dysfunction, in the end, Nebraska emerges as a moving tribute to the enduring bonds of family. For while David may have issues of his own with Woody - mainly resentment for his years of parental disinterest brought on by his alcoholism - hell be damned if hes going to let anyone else make a mockery of him. Whats amazing is how much we see of ourselves reflected in these characters. Woody represents the elderly holding onto their last remaining shreds of dignity while bit by bit the ravages of time and aging take their toll. And even though David has entered that stage where the son must now become parent to the father, hes determined to do so without robbing his old man of the dignity that each of us is entitled to when we come to the end of our road. Fortune or no fortune, this turns out to be a healing trip for both David and his dad, and who can put a price on that?

The humor is as dry and unaffected as the setting, as the Grants voice their many concerns about the situation they find themselves in and each other. Plus, they have to contend with an assortment of neer-do-well relatives who sit around all day watching Golden Girls reruns and plotting how to get their hands on some of Woodys fortune. Then theres Davids mother, Kate, a sharp-tongued, long-suffering woman whos put up with Woodys petulant personality for just about as long as she can at this point. Shes clearly at the end of her rope with Woody, yet as with David, we sense that there is something holding the couple together, something we have trouble seeing yet are somehow made to feel. And that is as it should be with family.

If the visuals were not so stunning, one might almost be tempted to label Nebraska an actors picture, for rarely do we see performances of this caliber in a single film. As Woody, Bruce Dern injects an amazing pathos into his portrait of a man who may be slowly losing his grip on his memory, his vigor and his independence but who is determined to go down fighting, not allowing any outside naysayers and skeptics to rob him of his one final dream, quixotic though it may be. And who could have imagined that Will Forte, hitherto known for his cranked-up comic turns on Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock, was concealing such a gift for understated emotion and low-keyed humor? Forte provides the reasoned and reasonable center of gravity that such a tale needs to avoid spinning off into undisciplined absurdity or indulging in a too-knowing condescension. Its a true breakthrough performance. And the marvelous June Squibb steals every scene shes in as Woodys lifelong bete noire, matching her husband dig for dig and barb for barb every step of the way. Each of these actors makes us care deeply for their characters inspiring us to laugh with rather than at them. There are also fine performances by  Stacy Keach and Bob Odenkirk, among others.

And, saving the best for last, we must now genuflect before the brilliant Phedon Papamichael for his incomparable cinematography which sees to it that the image is every bit as important as every other element in the movie.

So beautiful it almost hurts, Nebraska may be the most perfect blend of form and content weve come across in quite some time.",1400284800,,5138,4.766292134831461

Also enjoyed June Squibb's  portrayal of Woody's loyal and long-suffering wife, Kate. Foulmouthed  and funny, but a voice of reason.

Will Forte is so believable as ""The Son"" ... Now, I can't imagine any other actor playing that part.

Bruce Dern was so good that you wonder if he has dementia for real. My friend Peter MacNeill could have come close equaling to Dern's portrayal.

If you're from the middle of this country, you'll recognize a lot of folk, a lot of small towns, and a lot of dialog ...I know these people, these towns and how they talk (or, don't !) ... this was play was written with real sensitivity ...thanks.

6150283,4,B00H9L28OO,"Nebraska is a story of dreams. It is presented in Ansel Adams-like, dreamy black and white. The story is simple and straightforward. The performances are in equal turns hilarious and heartbreaking. The direction is pitch perfect.

Bruce Dern and June Squibb are fantastic. Squibb is particularly powerful in this film. She is the matriarch that has held her family together and held their ground. Stacy Keach is great and gravely as always. Will Forte and Bob Odenkirk are surprising in the ways they have approached their roles. Both of them come from comedy backgrounds, but do well in this drama. Their characters change before our eyes and it is all completely believable.

Coming from the mid-West, this film, its characters and settings, seemed so familiar to me. The story arch was the zig-zag. I would recommend this film to anyone looking for a slow-burn, beautiful story about family and dreams fulfulled.",1400112000,,915,5.052980132450331

6150286,4,B00H9L28OO,"Meditations on the core of humanity and the importance of direction late in life, all wrapped up in a slow-moving road trip picture. Sharp, gorgeous black-and-white cinematography does a masterful job of driving home the moral gray areas of its cast, while also reinforcing the bleak, desolate landscapes of the American plains in winter. Bruce Dern is hauntingly effective as the desperate lead character, teetering on the verge of dementia while his family deals in their own ways, but it's Jane Squibb who steals the scenery. Her turn as the family's stodgy, no-nonsense, firecracker of a matron is a real standout, deliciously funny in a picture that sorely needs that kind of relief. The remainder of the cast doesn't fare so well, with several reciting their lines so flatly that they might be reading straight from cue cards. It's a depressing bit of truth, one that seems to enjoy lingering in the moment, but generally moves along smoothly enough. An uneven patch near the end of the second act is the only bit that seems to drag. Poignant and melancholy, but also rich and familiar - I'd have liked a bit more activity, but that's simply not its style.",1400112000,,1162,4.844221105527638

Life moves slower in some places and with some people, life and people are not always colorful on the surface,and people use plain language.
I liked the movie, thought it as much about family as anything else; family including the town you live in and the characters you come across during your life.
As your loved ones grow old its natural to want to fill in the blanks of their lives but without the time its impossible .Here is a story that deals with that to a point, and it shows you can love someone without completely understanding them.
its a good story and good characters, nicely put together. It shows dysfunctional families-which most are in some way, shows how we deal with the past.
So don't expect a fast paced , action packed story with a metaphor a minute to teach. Do expect to think, and learn a little",1399766400,,994,4.407608695652174

6150406,4,B00H9L28OO,Great movie....considering it's all in black and white. It's kind of slow to start and stays that way. It reminds me of me and my son in a few years. Hope that's not true!,1399248000,,171,4.0588235294117645

Great photography--------seems with so much beauty in Nebraska and a state full of some of the nicest people ever (( albeit a bit too conservative for me), the characters sends a pretty pathetic picture of who lives here !  But I'm sure most people realize there's good and bad everywhere ! :)",1399248000,,502,4.5777777777777775

Its beautifully woven into the plot with witty humor and adorable old man aka Bruce Dern. The movie is well paced and does not look slow despite it being a character movie. The old man imagines to have won a lottery and entails the whole family to get that prize money , despite the lottery ticket just being an advertisement the family helps the old man reach the headquarters of the office miles away from their city.

I'm not sure the under 40 crowd would enjoy it as much as an ""older"" crowd since it is a movie about aging and contemplating one's life and past.

A story of a family with the dad becoming a little senile and the other family members coping.  A son learning about his family secrets, mundane perhaps but completing the story for him.
Great portrayal of small towns where everyone knows each other's history.",1398816000,,514,4.4

It also has a lot to say about fathers and sons, small town quirks, the passage of time, complacency, empathy, and of course greed.  Bruce Dern is better than ever as a confused old man with moments of perfect clarity.  But Will Forte is an even bigger surprise as the calm force of goodness and manners.  The black and white photography really forces you to think about the personalities, dialogue, and subtle agendas of each character.  Give this one your full attention and you will be rewarded.",1398729600,,642,4.6875

I missed my own Dad while watching this movie. This is a relationship movie about a Dad & Son. If your Dad is still living, this movie may make you re-connect with your parent.",1398124800,,584,3.940677966101695

It portrays the elderly as themselves, each unique, each flawed, and each wonderfully, surprisingly funny and misled by life's tricks and foibles.

A son does his best to make his father happy, and even though he knows his father is following a foolish dream, he doesn't understand  the real reason, but is willing to endure the humiliation and to be there for his father when the reality comes down.  The family this story travels through is like most families, peopled by those we recognize as us and ours.

This is a quiet story, awash in the everyday banalities that we all deal with.  It is brightened by a superb cast, filmed in black and white which adds to the commonality of the place and the people.  It also stands amongst a welter of films that boast great casts and great performances from 2013 -- a year of exceptional acting jobs in films that deal with difficult and edgy themes.",1397865600,,1066,4.608465608465608

It is done in black and white, and this only added to the bleakness of the overall movie. While there were some amusingly redeeming parts, I found it sadly lacking in point.

The town loves him when he has a million dollars, and almost all want a piece of it; the town hates him when his fortune proves false.  June Squibb, nominated for best supporting actress, is wonderful as his wife, who has an opinion about everyone and doesn't hesitate to express it in no uncertain terms.

The film makers blew a great opportunity to show areas of America that aren't shown enough on film, the beauty of the plains and big sky country.  The heartland of America.

he has just received a notice that he has won 1 million dollars and all he has to do is go to a nearby town to collect it.
It seems like the typical salesman bait or scam many people get fooled by each year.
So his son tries to convince him that this is exactly that, but his older father just won't listen and the Alzheimer's makes it even more difficult to get it across to him.
So starts our journey of father wants to go and son trying to stop and reason with him.
I liked the story and the different quirky characters throughout the movie always seemed to keep the story going perfectly and everyone did a great job acting I think.
This to me is a drama mixed with comedy type of movie.

6150774,5,B00H9L28OO,"How refreshing to see a film about real people in very real circumstances, of a family trying to cope with Dementia.  Like most families who have little understanding of this brain disease and how it manifests itself in those who are afflicted with it, this family reacts at first in a very normal and understandable way to the exasperating  behavior of the aging husband and father who becomes both demanding and unreasonable.  At first it brings out all the worst in his wife frustrated with what she perceives as a failure in a man and husband, and worries in his sons who are trying to cope with their disappointment in their father.  They have been trying to compensate for their perceived lack of love and care from their father, but this strange behavior, while it keeps them constantly worried, brings out the heroic character of their sons, particularly the younger one.  The entire story of their family life  unfolds during the pilgrimage from their home in Billings, Montana, to Lincoln, Nebraska, to claim a prize of a million dollars the father believes, erroneously, he has won due to a misconception of a flyer he received in the mail announcing the fact ""he has won.""  The letter is typical of an enticement to enter a contest where, of course, a purchase is hopefully involved.  But the father is absolutely convinced he is the winner and already has plans to buy a new truck. It doesn't matter that he long ago poor vision forced him to surrender his driver's license.

 Along the way, they encounter other members of the family and old friends, who have all heard the rumors of the big winnings and expect their share.  The sons have to deal with this all the way and fight for their father's honor with these same greedy people who refuse to believe the truth and who have no idea of the truth or understanding of the father's mental deterioration. At destination's  end, the myth of the winnings is revealed by a receptionist in the office of the company originating the flyers, but he received a consolation prize of a hat that says ""prize winner.""  Ultimately, the truth arises and is finally accepted by the father and the nagging disappointed wife responds with quiet love and understanding. On the long drive back to Billings, unheralded courage and heroism unfolds along the way.

The real love in this family shines through.  Bruce Den as the father and Wil Forte as his adult son who is most affected and assumes the greater responsibility for his father's care, offer completely believable and magnificent performances.  All the cast is outstanding but these two in primary roles, shine most of all.

6150781,5,B00H9L28OO,"Black and white cinematography seems just right for the high flatlands of the Dakotas, Montana, and Nebraska, and I think that what I'll remember most clearly about this movie are the spare images of the land, which Alexander Payne makes sure we see in a variety of lights and times of day.  The sense of impermanence in the small towns that are passed through, and in the images of the aging people, suggest that everything changes and yet nothing does.  The land looks as it must have looked when Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) was a boy, probably around 1930 and how it looked when he came back from the Korean War to a choice between farming and being a mechanic. Now, at around 80, Woody is an alcoholic in the early stages of dementia, and he believes that a flier he has received in the mail means that he has won a million dollars, refusing to believe that the flier doesn't promise the million but only a chance at it (if the number on the flier is a winner).  His son Bobby (Will Forte), in an unsatisfying job and a problematic relationship, decides to humor his dad by driving him from their home in Billings, Montana to Lincoln, Nebraska to pick up the money.

It's not easy to say where the power of this movie resides.  Bruce Dern gives a totally convincing performance as a stubborn, failing old man, but the movie can hardly be said to be a character study, for Woody is beyond development or self-expression.  Always a man of few words (we're told by other characters), he has fewer now that he is failing.  There's pathos in this, and there's a sense of how difficult it must be to live with and care for such a person.  Woody's wife, Kate (June Squibb), has a point when she asks her son who is concerned about his father, ""What about me?""  It's a poignant question, since Woody doesn't seem to have played a very active part in his sons' growing up.  Kate is tough and blunt, and we can see that these qualities are carrying her through a difficult time -- and (we get hints in the movie) there have been earlier difficult times.  Squibb gives a vivid performance here, though the character as conceived by the script verges on the tough matriarch stereotype.  And there's the family comedy dimension of the movie -- on their way to Lincoln, Woody and Bobby visit his brother and his family (whose two thuggish sons form perhaps a too-convenient comic contrast with Bobby) in the little town where they all grew up.  The word gets around the more extended family and the townsfolk that Woody is really a millionaire -- and all sorts of people come out of the woodwork claiming a share of Woody's good fortune because of what they claim they did for him way back when.  The focus of that theme comes to a head in a confrontation with Ed Pegram (Stacy Keach), Woody's old partner in an auto-mechanic business.  Ed reckons Woody owes him around 20 grand.  Woody reckons that Ed owes him a compressor that he stole.  Heaven only knows the truth of matter, but Ed is one mean dude, and he gets a kind of comeuppance.

So . . . all of these strands are engaging, and yet the movie seems to add up to a bit more.  For me, it was focused in a conversation that Bobby has with Peggy Nagy, the editor/owner of the local paper and (Bobby learns) an old flame of Woody's who was beaten out by Kate because she (Peggy) ""wouldn't let Woody touch all the bases.""  The implication is that Kate would, and did.  Bobby asks Peggy if, back then, his father drank too much, and Peggy says that of course he did.  Out here, she says, ""there wasn't much else to do.""  The movie, especially in its visual dimension, gives Peggy's statement the ring of truth.  The land seems both beautiful and remote from human concerns.  The towns are small, and the aging people we see, like Woody's brothers and old acquaintances have nothing to talk about.  What, we wonder, did their life-experiences amount to?  And Woody's taciturn nature begins to seem less an idiosyncrasy and more a matter of the accident of his being born and living in the part of the country that he did.  We wonder if Kate, a city girl by her own admission (whatever that means in Nebraska), might have seemed at some point to offer something more -- but in fact she didn't, and now Kate is beaten down too, and Bobby has no clear grip on a future for himself.  The image of ""success"" in the movie is Bobby's brother, Ross (Bob Odenkirk), a news anchor at a small TV station in Billings.  Bobby himself works selling audio and video equipment . . . but it doesn't seem to mean much to him.

So it's both ironic and pathetically apt that Bobby is drawn to his father's clear goal -- to go to Lincoln, get that million dollars, and buy himself a truck (even though he doesn't drive any more).  Just the idea that the old man's life has purpose must be, at least in part, what drives Bobby to take his dad to Lincoln.  And, without giving too much away, the trip is both a failure and a success.  What that amounts to for Bobby's future isn't clear, though.  What will change for him back in Billings?  Will he, as his mother fears, end up like his father -- cranky and old, with a life that has nothing to show for it, still stuck in a beautifully desolate landscape into which he will disappear.  The scenes of a visit to the cemetery in Woody's old home town and to Woody's childhood home (now empty and deserted) are high moments in this movie, and they offer no consolation.  There is some human tenderness, but it isn't sentimentally inflated, and its effects are likely to be short-lived at best.

This is well worth seeing, though -- much better, I think, than Payne's ""The Descendants.""  The way it connects age to place is very effectively done, and the performances, large and small, couldn't be better.",1396828800,,5768,4.450999048525214

6150854,5,B00H9L28OO,"Frequently, it seemed as if I was the only patron laughing during my first viewing of Nebraska. It was during an afternoon matinee in a Palm Desert cineplex.

Perhaps the joke was on me.

The story is centered on an elderly gentleman with diminished capacities from alcohol abuse who believes he has won $1million because of a mailed marketing promotion for magazine subscriptions. Not trusting the security of the postal system or other carriers, the man wants to travel some 900 miles to Lincoln, Nebraska, to claim his prize. Lacking the facility to drive or the means for public transit, he makes several attempts to simply walk until his son agrees to drive him there.

I felt like I knew the on-screen characters, maybe because I had spent several of my formative years growing up in a small Ohio town. It was the lifelong home of my paternal grandparents, a couple who operated a the center of middle class sensibilities and ""networked"" in the old fashioned way with the farmers, merchants, artists and public servants of the area. Back then, the onset of senility, central to the story, had not been an issue with which many dealt, most passed before that incapacity was a problem. Most, but not all.

In some ways Nebraska is a retelling of the classic road story. What is unusual is that the ""strangers"" met on the journey are mostly friends, family and former rivals. Time and distance have made them strangers again.

6150872,5,B00H9L28OO,"Nebraska is a very good character study embedded in starkly realistic settings in Nebraska, Montana, South Dakota, qnd Wyoming. Humor and pathos are interchangeable in black and white footage that director Alexander Payne calls  ""iconic and archetypal."" Bruce Dern, Will Forte, June Squibb, Bob Odenkirk, and Stacy Keach star in a ""road""  film about an elderly alcoholic man determined to find something of value in the patchy memories of his life. The movie shows us that the meaning of a person's life is highly personal with its entire course anchored by idiosyncratic memories of a few unconnected experiences. It is impossible to fully understand and love a person who does not tell us about his own perception (accurate or not) of past events. The value of the telling is that personal history can be ""re-filmed"" with a little help from family and friends.

Bruce Dern, a fellow lifelong runner, is one of my favorite actors. With very few lines of dialogue, he conveys the stress of his character (Woody Grant) trying to make sense of life with death inevitably approaching. In a beautiful scene at the end of the movie, Woody does get the opportunity to add footage to his own story and perceives triumphant meaning in his personal history.

The other actors were truly supportive of Dern in their roles, with June Squibb standing out in her tour de force portrayal of Woody's long complaining wife.

6150903,5,B00H9L28OO,"I watched the film trailer for Nebraska. It did not look good, or entertaining. In fact, it looked downright boring. Dry. Filmed in crisp black and white, and with a limited original soundtrack, Nebraska is Rated R for language. The 114 minute movie, directed by Alexander Payne, caught me off guard. 220px-Nebraska_Poster

The picture was nominated for six Academy Awards. Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Bruce Dern), Best Supporting Actress (June Squibb), Best Original Screenplay (Bob Nelson) and Best Cinematography (Phedon Papamichael).

Although Bruce Dern did not take home an Academy Award, he did win a Best Actor Award at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. Fifty-four years in the business, and a solid work history. The man is talented. The award well deserved.

Woody Grant (Dern) lives in Montana. He received a Sweepstakes announcement in the mail. It says hes won $1,000,000. To collect he needs to mail the form back (with a list of new magazine subscriptions) to Nebraska. However, Woody would rather visit Nebraska to collect the winnings in person.

David (Will Forte), Woodys son, sells stereos. His girlfriend left him. Nothing is going right. When he sees the letter his father carries around, he tries his hardest to get his absentminded father to understand the announcement is a scam, that there is no money to be won.

Woodys wife, Kate (Squibb), is at her wits end. Woodys tireless efforts to reach Nebraska on foot are causing the family to consider placing Woody in a retirement home. David steps up. He needs a break from life, anyway. He loads his father into the car and plans to take him to Nebraska, hoping to bond and salvage a relationship that was never good anyway. When family and old friends learn of Woodys good fortune, everyone feels they deserve a piece of the pie.

Squibb, Devin Ratray and Tim Driscoll who play Davids cousins are hysterical. Forte is the straight man. Dern is slow and calculated with nothing much to say, but everything he says either comes out profound or comical.

I loved the movie. I highly recommend it. Highly! 5 out of 5 Stars, easily. Easily! Throughout the movie, I compared Nebraska to Napoleon Dynamite. It is the same style of storytelling, with just a bit more drama. The one-liners are non-stop. I laughed out loud from beginning to end. The story was fantastic. The pacing was perfect. The acting (with the exception of Forte, sadly), was excellent.

It was that good.
I watched it two times in one day.
It was that good.
There were three or four scenes that stood out as memorable, the scene
with the males in the family watching a sports event, the hospital scene.
The story is about an alcoholic aging father with Alzheimers and how those

6150964,4,B00H9L28OO,Surprisingly uplifting. Great acting. A realistic portrayal of an often unseen and ignored substrate of American culture.  Exceeded my expectations.,1396224000,,148,6.4
6150965,3,B00H9L28OO,"The story is really good, and there are some moments where comedic writing really shines.  Maybe I had too high of expectations that it'd be PRIMARILY a comedy.  I would classify it as a melancholy comedy with the same kind of flavor as Billy Wilder, such as his movie The Apartment (1960).  It's interesting that the movie doesn't even attempt to construe the story into one of family reconciliation.  Bruce Dern's character's wife remains a shrew instead of respecting him, and the ultimate payoff is that Bruce Dern regains self-respect through an act of deception like Andy would do for Barney Fife on The Andy Griffith Show.  Like The Andy Griffith Show, it stereotypes a sector of the United States and has a lot of darkness mixed in with the comedy.  It is kind of a weird combination between Billy Wilder and The Andy Griffith Show.

I would probably have given it 4 stars, in spite of its profanity, if it had more light-hearted moments.  It earned that 3rd star from me because I enjoyed Bruce Dern's and Will Forte's performances a lot.  I think I would have been more satisfied with the movie if it moved the family out of a dysfunctional state and involved June Squibb's character, the shrewish wife of Bruce Dern's, coming to respect him.  The Andy Griffith Show works, I feel, because even though Andy and Opie are the only normal people (at least in the black and white seasons), there's a lot of charm from the quirkiness, and the people in the community care about each other a lot.  I didn't get an endearing feeling about the community/region of the northwestern Midwest that this movie takes place in.  I personally love the Midwest, and I agree with Richard Corliss's online review of this movie, that it ""veers between social satire and deadpan contempt"", ""the director's home region is a weird place, but you wouldn't want to live there"", and ""There's little heart in Payne's [the director's] heartland.""  I like the careful casting of every face, but feel like instead of making the community/region feel endearing, there's little charm.  If more of the characters were actually normal and their relationships not so dysfunctional--or even just the latter, like The Andy Griffith Show--it would be more engaging for me.",1396224000,,2244,4.825065274151436
6150966,5,B00H9L28OO,This movie was unexpectedly funny and interesting. I never thought that it would be as entertaining as it actually was.,1396224000,,119,5.0
6150967,5,B00H9L28OO,"This is one of those rare films in which every element comes together so seamlessly that it is almost impossible to pull them apart. The cinematography was poetic in it's Gothic starkness. The acting was delicate, fragile, even, jack-legged and stumbling, lurching towards the forlorn hope. And the story, to me, was a love story about a father and a son--and the surprising things the son learns about his father that he never knew, and how this changes the way he views the old man in a more generous light. Some reviewers have reacted as if Woody is the protagonist, but Woody remains something of a cipher, throughout it all. This is a story about David, the son. After all, his immediate problem is this delusional, rambling father whose indifference towards him has always left him with some unfulfilled wish for a deeper connection. Before the old man is gone, forever. Mom is no help, since her stack of unfulfilled wishes with Woody reaches so high that it is toppling. Sometimes father and son made me think of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. Sometimes of King Lear led by his Jester, or Gloucester led by Edgar, sometimes Odysseus with Telemachus.

The dialogue is spare, but evocative, and at times conveying in a most subtle manner what the Japanese call 'mono no aware', the eternal transience of things. Rising and falling, emerging and disappearing. Fading like the smoke from a cigarette in a breeze, like ashes swirling into the wind. The Japanese term Wabi refers to a kind of simple, austere beauty and this quality is felt throughout the film. The story revolves around a quest for a great treasure in which the old and forgotten things are revisited in their disarray and their decomposition(and typical primate behavior among the old friends and family is invoked by the anticipation of a large pile of bananas). Childhood memories are reduced to heaps of sticks and broken cribs and chairs and dead brothers and sisters. Entropy is not what it used to be, it seems. The fact that this quest becomes a minor triumph instead of exploding blazing fireworks with a brass band is somehow more fitting, more complete, more satisfying, given the gentle rhythm and tempo of the story. The slow and stately procession down main street in the new truck was perfect. In the big scheme of things it was very small, tiny almost, and witnessed only by a lucky few, but enough to create a legend, and poignant in it's easy restoration of an old man's dignity.",1396137600,,2466,4.775175644028103
6150968,3,B00H9L28OO,I dragged out way toooooo long.  I lost interest several times during the movie.  I also think this requirement for writing what you think sucks.,1396137600,,145,4.76
6150969,3,B00H9L28OO,"I just saw the movie NEBRASKA.  It is as flat as the state itself.  The main characters,
an old guy and his son, did not develop much as characters.  It was also kind of a dig
at the inhabitants of small towns, as almost every character in the movie developed a
greed over the nonexistent prize of a million dollars.
The plot is that an old guy (who has lost his marbles) gets taken in by a subscription
contest and believes that all he has to do to claim a million dollar prize is to get from
Montana to Nebraska.  His son takes him and they meet all kinds of weird people
along the way.",1396137600,,588,4.086956521739131

That extended family were all slightly ""off"" reality, which made us continue to watch, hoping someone else would be more unbalanced. Near the end, we could understand why this movie received so much hype. Hopefully others will feel the same way. And, we've already watched it twice; we DID miss some important pieces, making this film a ""keeper"" after all!",1396051200,,492,4.927710843373494

6151007,5,B00H9L28OO,"I assume everyone by now knows the plot. So I will avoid that and say that this film is very close to being perfect. All the performances are superb. Dern is wonderful and is immersed in the role of Woody. June Squibb adds some welcome acerbic humor to the proceedings. And who would have thought an SLN regular could deliver such depth of character (Will Forte as his son David)? (No offense to SNL, it is more like 'where did this guy come from'? The performance is understated and brilliant).

The cinematography is gorgeous and shooting in B&W fits the film like a glove. I cannot imagine this film in color. The editing is tight - there is not a wasted frame.

On one level it does not seem that a lot really ""happens"". There is a lot of dialog yet it is minimal. Not much is actually said. Then you step back and realize that a lot happened, and there was a great depth of meaning and understanding present in the sparse dialog. (The film deserves to be seen twice to fully appreciate its depth). In many scenes a lot is communicated by the subtlest change of expression or body language. It kind of reminds me of Terence Malick's early films, but without the flights of cinematic fancy a la Days of Heaven.

There is a scene which shows the family in the living room pretty much just sitting and watching TV. It is a framed shot looking at the family from the TV. I thought of an old song called Little Pink Houses with the lyric ""...this is America"". Because that scene is America. Nothing exciting going on there, but very profound it's ""realness"". This film taps far into the heart of the heartland. The not dysfunctional but far from perfect family dynamics. Woody's unwavering chase of his dream - which we know is not only unrealistic but ridiculously unattainable. His son David's exasperation with the old man but loving commitment to his quest and his understanding of dementia and it's effects.  The cutting wit and humor of his wife Kate, who still, how can I say it, ""steps to the plate"" for Woody.

As the film moves along much indeed happens, but I kept wondering how it would end. Between his drinking and dementia, I came away with the sense that Woody truly believes he own the prize. But a scene near the end (which involves Stacy Keech) seems to break through for him and I think he realizes his folly. There is not a million dollars to be had. And I so hoped it would not end there - could not end there. And it didn't.

All I will say is that in the final scenes, David, at least for a few precious moments, is able to give Woody the dignity he had lost. He gives him the realization of a far more important dream than a million dollars. Woody, maybe for the last time (?), feels alive again. Bittersweet is an understatement. Like most of this film, the ending is simply perfect.",1396051200,,2808,4.421663442940039

I found the movie entertaining.  Most people who watch it will watch it once and probably never watch it again, but for what it is, it is worth experiencing.

The movie is shot in black and white, which I find to be a medium best used to strip away all the distracting elements of a film and force the audience to focus on the dialogue, acting, and characters.  The scenes are shot in a very beautiful way, that hearkens back to the photography style of many older films - but the film is clearly modern, with clothing, cars, and such all of recent style.  However, throughout the film, we are presented with the scene of a town that is old and dying, like its occupants.  Along the way, we try to figure out what the relationship is between the son and father and in this way, the film marries the past and the present, which is, to a large degree, what the film does with its characters.

I found the most interesting character to be Kate (June Squibb) who is Woody's vocal, smart, and blunt wife and David's mother.  The plays an excellent supporting role and really did deserve the Academy Award nod for this performance.

If you enjoy independent film that are character studies shot with a drama-comedy bent, you will find that this film's plot and style are very similar to other films of its type, but the excellent acting, photography, and some other small nuances really make this film stand-out above and beyond being ""just another indie film.""  That being said, if you don't enjoy these types of movies, this one will not win you over, either.",1395705600,,1793,4.62776025236593

6151147,4,B00H9L28OO,"NEBRASKA tells the story of Woody Grant (Bruce Dern), an elderly, trusting alcoholic who believes he's won a million dollars.  After repeated attempts to walk to Lincoln, Nebraska to claim the prize, his youngest son David decides it's best to give the old man a ride.  After all, there's not much time left, and he and his father have never really been close.

This is a beautiful film, revolving around a very simple core: two sons (the fantastic Will Forte and Bob Odenkirk) learning about their family's history in their father's hometown, reuniting and clashing with their relatives, getting to know their parents (the incomparable Dern and a pitch-perfect June Squibb) a little better.  The premise is simple; the emotions aren't.  Rendered beautifully in stark black-and-white, with nuanced direction from Alexander Payne, the film alternates between moments of intimate hilarity, to heart-wrenching reality.  It can be quite hard to watch in spots, as honest as it gets.  If the film has one flaw (note the lack of a fifth star), it's that Bob Nelson's script gets a little repetitive in spots; the same jokes reworked and rehashed.  The film could maybe lose about twenty minutes here and there.  But ultimately, this is a film to watch and experience.  Repeatedly.",1395619200,,1274,5.052631578947368

6151164,5,B00H9L28OO,"I have never been to Montana or Nebraska, but the people in this melancholically absurd story seemed like old acquaintances to me.
I watched the movie alone on an airplane and had to laugh out loud at one scene. Bruce Dern's character has this demented idea that he won a million dollars. His nice younger son humors him and goes on a road trip to collect. One evening the son tries to talk to dad about basics of life, like love, marriage, commitment, having kids. Dad is completely in the woods. What are you talking about? You must have been in love with mom. What? Why did you get married then? She wanted it. And you? Shrug. Why did you have us, your kids, did you talk about having kids? What for? Why did you have us? Your mother was catholic.
The speechless staring at the world, the inarticulate way of leading 'normal lives'... I was very familiar with that, growing up in a different part of the world, in similar social environments, of course rural, and generations, the elder generation war veterans. I have met that bunch of old uncles and aunts  and aging cousins at comparable family events. Generally funerals.
I don't want to talk down 12 Years as Slave, but Nebraska would have deserved the best film award at the Oscars.",1395532800,7,1241,4.540178571428571
6151165,5,B00H9L28OO,"Director Alexander Payne ('The Descendants', 'Sideways') knocked this film out of the park with his ability to study human behavior.  Written by Bob Nelson who called it ""an act of desperation"", the astounding cast has a strength of character separately and collectively that is easy to see, but more so feel.  Some more than others, as they pulled at my heartstrings. As this film opens, we see Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) walking down the side of the highway, hat on, coat wide open and a sign in the background showing a freezing 26 degrees.  Woody doesn't care, he has escaped the house unnoticed once again to gain his prize. He has stopped dreaming a long time ago, his life has essentially passed him by because of alcoholism which included years of just living and drinking.  A difficult man, He is walking to Lincoln Nebraska to claim what is his, and this man is overdetermined to get what is coming to him.  He believes he is a winner, a big winner having plans to buy a new truck and an air compressor, even though he doesn't have a drivers license.

The film moves slowly and I was glad for that, I could take in every little delicious detail that was meant to be seen.  There are so very many.  Woody has been married for years to the abrasive and unbelievably unfiltered spoken Kate (June Squibb).  The wife with the razor for a tongue that lashes Woody and lands on a deaf ear anymore.  They have two sons, Ross (Bob Odenkirk), who has a shorter part in the film and works as a Television Newscaster.  He agrees with his extremely opinionated mother to put his father in a ""home"".  The second younger and dutiful son, David (Will Forte), has a heart as big as Montana itself, which is where they live,  Billings to be exact. David decides he should take his father to Nebraska, I think to get to know him better, and also to get him away from his acerbic wife and his history of an alcohol-addled life.  Like he says to David, ""Beer ain't drinkin'"" then wanders off into a bar on stops for fuel.

Woody has many brothers and on the journey, he sees several of them.  These guys are extremely short on conversation which is part of the humor in this.  Any family get-togethers would put most people to sleep.  We also get to see many of the things that Woody has experienced in his life.  The film is nostalgic, a huge slice of Americana for me.  Some of the conversations that these two get into are classic, one in the bar was over the top as it ends with Woody leaving the bar to the tune of, ""You'd drink too if you were married to your mother"".  He does have a point there.  There are several higher points in this. The visit to the cemetery with the parents and David is priceless as Kate shines, even though her commenting is nowhere nearly warm.  Meeting up with 'Peg Bender' also was an interesting conversation for David as he learns how important this woman was to his father.  She has much information that David could never have known about his father.  Peg is a lovely woman, very unlike his mother.  Another high point is when the family goes to see the home that Woody was born in. It brought a tear to my eye at one point feeling the sadness and viewing it through Woody's eyes.  There are also several scenes with his old business partner, Ed (Stacy Keach), who obviously is his nemesis.

A very poignant part of the movie is when David has had enough of Ed ridiculing his father, this is also great to behold.  This son learns the reasons of his father's ideas, and they are heartwarmingly unselfish.  Woody's motives are pure, and David has even more respect for his father after Woody telling him.  The ending of this movie is priceless and brought a loving father and son feeling to this story.  The sparkling soundtrack (Mark Orton) helps pull this story along, always underscoring and delightful.  The towns look as if they are just frozen in time, kind of like Woody's own life. A sometimes brutal, sometimes hilarious, but mainly a potent, stark, and honest theme for this very realistic movie.",1395532800,3,4032,4.502063273727648

6151193,4,B00H9L28OO,"Directed by Alexander Payne (Sideways), Nebraska can be described in various ways. It is a road movie; it is a drama about a dysfunctional father and son relationship; it is a character study, or an offbeat comedy (and a very offbeat one). Whatever it is, it is an Alexander Payne film with his distinctive touch that makes the films sad and comic moments so real.

The simple story is about Woody Grant (Bruce Dern), who travels 750 miles from Montana to Nebraska to claim a $1 million sweepstakes prize, while his son David (Will Forte), who accompanies him, knows that the prize is not real. On their way in Woody's hometown (fictional ""Hawthorne""), rumors spread about Woodys money.

Probably Alexander Paynes films are an acquired taste. They are often slow-moving and deliver pathos and comedy in a subtle and unexpected way. Nebraska is no exception, so please take time and be patient. In Nebraska you are going to take a journey with David, who learns, if not completely, things about his headstrong father, and by the time you finish watching the film, you will be seeing him in a different way.

The real pros such as Mr. Dern and Mr. Keach gave this movie the dramatic dynamics to make it noteworthy as cinematic theater.

If your parents are collecting social security then this will connect with you too. Dern's character refuses to give up his ways and a long journey begins. He is ornery and we learn later, very kind and giving although you couldn't tell by his rough exterior. The mother's character is loud and very comical. We laughed and were stirred with memories of elderly loved ones lost. Good movie. You may recognize Dern from 60's and 70's westerns - he was always a bad guy.",1395273600,,609,4.545454545454546

6151237,5,B00H9L28OO,"This movie reminds me of why I so deeply enjoy cinematic achievements.  The approach of shooting the film in B&W was very much the right choice given the rather bleak and rural settings within the story.  It exemplified the sometimes bleak existence that the people, exactly like the characters herein, live in these locales.  The character development, the subtle, yet unambiguous way that the director brings us into their lives, is a marvel to partake of.  You will find yourself wanting to empathize with these characters, but at the same time thankful that you are not living the same lives they are.  Bruce Dern gives a tour-de-force acting lesson, especially in the mannerisms and physicality that he brings to the character.  This is a movie that will appeal to those who watch not just for any single aspect of a film, rather it brings all aspects of serious and magnificent pictures to the forefront and leaves you with an indelible image of the place, the people, and the plot encapsulated within.",1395273600,2,1008,4.8654970760233915

6151240,5,B00H9L28OO,"Veteran actor, Oscar nominee and Cannes winner, Bruce Dern (Woody Grant) receives a magazine promotion flyer in the post stating that he has won a million dollars. The movie opens with Woody walking along the motorway from Billings, Montana to Lincoln, Nebraska - about 750 miles. Addled by a lifetime of alcoholism and the onset on dementia, Woody refuses to be dissuaded from his quest.

Gentle loser David (Will Forte) is his younger son, roped in by his desperate mother, Kate (June Squibb - also deservedly nominated for her razor sharp tongue).

Bob Odenkirk (best remembered for his role as Saul Goodman in Breaking Bad) is the older, more successful son Ross. Stacy Keach, who has also been acting forever, is his former friend and business partner, Ed Pegram. The entire cast are excellent, as are the settings. Shot in black and white, there is a stark timelessness to this movie.

The audience is given a deeply intimate glimpse into an aspect of mid-Western working class America. Long suffering, infinitely patient, marginalized David, desperate to connect with his father, indulges him by offering to drive him to Nebraska, stopping off en-route at Woody's hometown for a family reunion.  Stubborn, grizzly, taciturn Woody, alternately forgetful and sharp as a tack gets into a fair amount of trouble on the way. Unable to resist popping into bars whenever they stop, Woody is none too steady on his pins either. He tunes out selectively, trained by a lifetime of his wife's carping.

""Sideways"" director Alexander Payne's keen eye portrays personalities in a matter-of-fact style - each uniquely adding insight and depth to their own and other characters . There are just enough humorous anecdotes to prevent it becoming depressing.

Highly recommended.",1395273600,,1768,5.121527777777778

And Alexander Payne has become one of my favorite directors after seeing three of his other films: ""Sideways,"" ""The Descendants"" and ""Election"". ""Nebraska"" is now at the top, the best character-driven movie I've seen all year.

The actors who portray these dysfunctionals were all worthy of being Oscar nominees. And although it's filmed in black and white,it adds to the mood of what it's like to live among miles and miles of bleak farmland. Also,the people that live there are as close to real people as you can get.

Bruce Dern probably has fewer lines than anyone in the film, yet his character is superb -- solid and believable throughout. His son who carried most of the action and observation duties never failed to impress. On the astounding end are Dern's wife, his former business partner and the newspaper owner who was a one-time romantic interest. Even the secretary at the contest publishing company did a great job. Dern's older son was the only weak point, although he had his magic moments during the fist-fight in the yard and the compressor incident.

6151356,2,B00H9L28OO,"When I saw the preview, I thought that this movie had potential.  It seemed creative to allow an old man suffering from dementia to pretend that he won a publisher's clearinghouse-like sweepstakes.  I envisioned the plot looking into people's reactions to the fake win and, also, a semi-funny roadtrip to Lincoln, Nebraska to ""claim"" the prize.  Some quirky movies are good (i.e. Little Miss Sunshine) and entertaining.  However, this film tried too hard to be ""artsy"" and, in the process, overlooked the fact that the plot was boring and drawn out.

Here is the plot in a nutshell:  A family lives in Montana (an old couple, 2 adult sons).  The old man suffers from dementia and incorrectly believes he has won $1 million.  He keeps running off to try to claim the money.  His younger son feels bad for the old man and decides to take him to Nebraska so that he will be satisfied about being able to go.  The have problems along the way and have to make a detour in the old man's hometown (also in Nebraska).  They interact with family members and people the old man used to know.  The personalities of these people are very dull and unremarkable.  I particularly disliked the derelict cousins who overplay their role as petty criminals who are amused by who is more macho.  It wasn't funny nor was it clever.

To summarize -- The young son realizes that his old man had spent his life giving and letting everyone run over him.  He coped by drinking a lot (as did all the rural people who had nothing better to do).  Family and friends still prove greedy after learning that the old man won the ""sweepstakes.""  Son realizes that his old man just had a simple dream that wasn't about being a millionaire.  In the end, the old man realizes his dream -- driving a ""new"" truck through town with a new air compressor.  THE END.

Problems with the plot:

Too long.

Too much ranch music in the background (just horrible -- like the movie).

Why film only in black and white?  I get that it is artsy and reflects the drab, plain life being depicted.  However, it seemed a bit much.  We get the point without black and white filming (by the way, don't stream this in HD, it is black and white!).  This guy lived a boring life in a boring place.

Characters aren't that interesting.  I didn't enjoy watching an old man suffering from dementia wandering around half-clueless through the most boring place in the US.

OVERALL:
Disregard all the hype and the critics.  They like this film because it tries to be different and pokes at the dull lifestyle and stereotypes of rural America.  That said, it's hardly something that will truly entertain.  It will leave you thinking -- why did I think a movie about a Nebraska roadtrip sounded good?",1395014400,,2732,4.564948453608247

6151374,5,B00H9L28OO,"This movie is a clever send-up of Nebraska, complete with desolate landscapes and quirky personalities.  Like ""Fargo,"" it's a movie that resonates long after it's finished.

Aside from the obvious jabs at Nebraskans of few words, and those not particularly brilliant, there are a number of subtexts, notably the idea that we never really get to know the people our parents really are (or were).  We know only a mythic picture cobbled together as children.  What other people have to say about our folks as REAL PEOPLE when they were growing up, or raising families, or interacting with relatives are things we rarely hear.

In addition, it points out the need children have to be validated by their parents, to earn their love and/or respect.

This movie is a well-done little gem.  Certainly more thought-provoking than any of its Oscar rivals.  I watched it several times and the more I watched, the more I saw.  It's a penetrating study in human nature.

I loved the soundtrack, too, which makes an earworm that sticks with you.  I bought the CD and listen to it often -- it's strangely soothing.",1394928000,,1099,4.792553191489362

I was really surprised at how much I didn't like this one.

Along the way, they stay in a town populated with old relatives,and friends, many of whom, when learning of the supposed imminent wealth, become vultures.

6151648,5,B00H9L28OO,"Some people would argue that Alexander Payne just ripped off his earlier work -- ""Sideways"" -- and basically just remade that film while doing ""Nebraska.""  They would argue that, once again, we just have a road trip -- check -- and that once again, we have two guys going on that road trip -- check -- and furthermore, they would argue that one of those guys drinks too much -- check -- and the other guy is struggling along in a career that's going, well, sideways -- check.

So while those people might have a point, I think that they would be wrong.

I believe that the themes are actually quite different between the two films.  I would argue that the main theme in ""Sideways"" might be something like:  ""Be willing to look past some idiosyncrasies of friends, as everyone has his or her own issues.""  But I might argue as well that the theme here might be:  ""It's hardest to see the good qualities of people that are closest to us.""

But of course the films do have quite a few similarities, as I've discussed above, and I think that you can look past those similarities when you have two quality pictures such as these.  And there are some differences, of course.  This was in black and white -- which many people have incorrectly criticized -- while ""Sideways"" was in color.  In 'Sideways,"" the protagonists drank wine, while the protagonists in ""Nebraska"" drank beer.  ""Sideways"" was set in southern California with a more laid-back California lifestyle, while ""Nebraska"" is set in, well, Nebraska, as well as other places in the Midwest.

I used to live in the Midwest myself, and I thought that the accents and peculiarities were spot on.  Sure, Mr. Payne may have gone slightly over the top a bit with those peculiarities, but not too far.  With almost all generalizations there is an element of truth, especially generalizations that are funny.

And I found this film very funny, even hilarious at times.  And it is ""heartwarming"" I suppose, even though I hate to use that overly-used-to-the-point-of-losing-its-meaning word.

6151680,4,B00H9L28OO,"This is a peek into what seems like the real lives of people in Nebraska.  But underneath what seem like blank canvases are real people with real hopes, dreams, and regrets.  The lead character, although seemingly demented, is probably more likely just laconic, a trait picked up from yours of dominance by his wife and the results of a traumatic experience in the Korean war.  He came back unhappy and quiet and apparently stayed that way for the rest of his life.  His quest for the prize is an attempt to obtain a shred of respect for a life spent with disappointment and lack of respect from others.

It was funny. Although,  I wonder what people living in the country in Nebraska would think of it.  But it was also unexpectedly touching as the son stands up for the father.  At the end it is about love for a father who  has spent a life seemingly not that lovable.",1394409600,,871,4.427672955974843

The black and white film felt exactly right and provide a way for the visual portrayal of the setting to resonate with the internal life of the characters and their relationships.

- Though shot in black and white, it is too crisp for the genre. Where's the grain/ film scratches this story requires?

He meets other family members and old friends who think he won the money. This is the movie premise. Filmed in black and white, ( that adds to the stark mid-west background and makes a 'point' of the character of Woody,) gives a realistic effectiveness to the story. Regardless of the naysayers and other bad reviews of this film, I though it was genius to be filmed in this format. The bad reviewers just didn't get it, I'm sorry to say.
The acting was superb ; and so were the characters. Yes, there are people like that in this world. Some have never been out of their hometown and grew up in that environment. Realistic plot, I thought. Why? Because I have taken care of some dementia patients a few times in my life, and they can be very stubborn and forgetful. Bruce Dern did a good acting job and so did all the actors in this movie. But the son, especially. He had patience, love, forgiveness and loyalty to his father.

It becomes a journey of discovery and totally unexpected levels of heroism. The 77-year-old Bruce Dern is magnificent as the gruff old man, and 84-year-old June Squibb is superb as his wife and the mother of the son who finally goes along with his dad to Lincoln to collect his ""winnings."" Squibb's character at the beginning is as unappealing and nasty as you can imagine, but by the end you love her - and you're laughing like crazy. Will Forte is brilliant as the son who is exasperated with his dad, but finds, as his dad does, that they have much to learn about each other. Stacy Keach is about as smarmy an old friend as one could ever hope for.

Highly recommended. The film is very well written, simply filmed. Several people who are from or who know Nebraska families were amazed at how true the family/home visits were to actual experience.

The film belonged among the Academy Award contenders, and will acquire a long video life.",1394323200,4,1153,4.619512195121951

Will Forte (a SNL alum) plays his son, and does a great job of humoring his Dad and trying to help.  Jean Squibb is hilarious as Dern's long-suffering wife, and has most of the best lines throughout.  Shot in black and white, this movie focuses on family and what life is like in the midwest.  I grew up in Queens, NY , and now live in a small town in Westchester, so some of the movies themes were familiar while others were totally foreign to me.

This movie was well made and well acted but hopefully not representative of most American families.  While watching the movie I wondered  If Nebraska was really like this?  Some reviewers who had lived there said it was.  This movie was certainly no advertisement for living there.  Nebraska the movie was one hell of a depressing look at aging through the eyes of a set of dysfunctional family members flailing about without much of a clue of how to love one another.  The old buzzard of a father was bad enough, but his codependent younger son who continued on a futile mission of trying to get blood out of a turnip was even more depressing.  Makes an old person like me, who long ago cut ties to my dysfunctional family, feel good about having made hard choices.

I give it 2 stars for a little witty dialog especially from the mother (who got an Oscar nomination) for this Fargo wannabe without the action.

Unless you like a long dialog driven movie that is trying to explore the deeper meaning of life via small semi-witty banter I'd stay far away.  I""m not trying to be mean but I'm trying to be honest.  My senior citizen mother thought the movie was boring even!

I do not understand the hype honestly. This move tries hard but it misses the mark. Plus, you can sniff the ending conclusion a mile away.  Don't expect any surprises.

There are no special effects, no blood, no death, no robots, no car chases... just an exceptional film about Americana acted out with thoughtfullness and care. The father thinks he's become a millionaire through a pre-printed magazine subscription clearing house letter he receives in the mail and is determined to get to Nebraska to collect his winnings.  There is a deadline that he has to get there by so his one son decides that rather than allow his determined father to walk to Nebraska, he'll drive him.  Let the road of life trip begin! Along the way the father tells old friends and family that he's hit the big one and now everyone is suddenly interested in this guy and tells his son that they loaned his dad money years ago and ""he better pay up or else"".... The interaction between the father and son leaves you uncomfortable at times because it's so strained and tense yet below the surface you discover the real love and respect they do have for one another.  This is a film everyone should see.  It's truly sad and funny and frustrating and tender and then laugh out loud hysterical (the family reunion scene and the stealing of the compressor are two of several laugh out loud moments).  The one constant that pulses through this film however is it's heartfelt.  I believe this is a spot on performance by actors who truly get and understand that love can be found even in dysfunctional famililes.",1394150400,4,1524,4.52

Was anything interesting at all? Yes. Alexander Payne's exploration of how the expectation of wealth can bring out the worst in people. In Payne's The Descendants, the anticipation of a windfall with the sale of the family's land exposed the cousins' true characters.  (nasty, with a couple of exceptions) In Nebraska, old friends and family tallied old debts, real and imagined, with their determination to get a few thousands of Woody's ""millions"".

6152084,4,B00H9L28OO,"Nebraska started out slow and for the most part remained that way. Instead of the fast cuts and brisk action of most of today's films, this one took its time and slowly built and developed its characters and story.

Bruce Dern delivers a great performance and Will Forte and June Squibb -- as his son and wife, respectively -- are also good, but I felt that the rest of the cast were not that great. Their dialogue delivery felt like reading rather than speaking naturally and at least one of the camera compositions/framing was questionable (the scene in which the father and son exit their vehicle and meet ""Aunt Martha,"" the camera framing is such that their feet are cut right at the ankle -- which is frowned upon and thought of as unprofessional in film school).

Having said that, I think the film benefited from being black and white and the dark humor sprinkled here and there kept the film interesting for me. I was hoping for a funnier film and a faster pace, but then the last 10 minutes of the film answered both of those issues for me. In the last 10 minutes, the actions of the son to get closer to his father and the way his father reacted to those actions resonated with me and made me feel something. I felt that if I hadn't endured the slower pacing and the so on, that I wouldn't have arrived at that point. In other words, if I hadn't experienced the film the way I had (weather it was good or bad), maybe I wouldn't have felt all the emotions that unfolded at the end.

So for that -- for the fact that the filmmakers did a good job tying up the story and delivering a satisfying and emotional ending -- I recommend this film to all those who enjoy a great story. It may not be the funniest, most entertaining film you've watched, but certainly has a point of view and tells a story worth telling.",1393891200,,1819,4.344117647058823
6152085,3,B00H9L28OO,This movie was frustrating and ridiculous just like your family sometimes is. It is a bland and dreary account of a man at the end of his life and how his family handle his crisis. I think I wanted to much from the film going in. The only real interesting character is mom who sometimes gets real crazy to off set the blandness of everyone else. Not sure this was really oscar worthy.,1393891200,3,384,4.273972602739726
6152086,5,B00H9L28OO,"What a brilliant film about the human condition. I'll warn you that it's tinged with sadness, but so are all of our lives, now aren't they?

This may be Alexander Payne's best work yet - Better than the dark humor of the funny/sad Schmidt (2002), Sideways (2004), or The Descendants (2011). It's also a film that the Coen Brothers could easily have done - there's a film noir, cartoon-like character about it that reminded me very much of the Coen style as well. If you're a fan of the brothers then you'll understand.

Just yesterday I was angry at myself for having wasted $5 and 90 minutes of my life on the schlock that is Gravity, a film that depends entirely on special effects to carry it, as does so much of the tripe that Hollywood produces.

6152105,4,B00H9L28OO,"Director Alexander Paynes film projects, while wildly different, do share the common bond of using a sort of journey to humorously examine some variety of decay in the American fabric.  His filmography includes Citizen Ruth, Election, About Schmidt, Sideways, The Descendants, and most recently Nebraska, all of which are a variation of a similar theme.  Nebraska is perhaps his most moody entry.

Nebraska is the story of an aging, somewhat alcoholic father who vows to collect a $1 million prize for a sweepstakes he believes he has won.  Bruce Dern puts forth an Oscar nominated performance as the father, Woody Grant, who after countless efforts to make the trek from Minnesota to Lincoln, Nebraska on foot is joined by his estranged son, David (Will Forte).  Woody and Davids journey allow Payne to examine physical, mental, and social decay while still maintaining the satirical humor for which his films have come to be known.  Filmed in gloomy black and white, Nebraska feels like what Fargo would have been like if you took out all of the murder and kidnapping.  What is left is a cast of wacky Midwesterners who dream of sudden fortune.  Woody has grown feeble and borderline delusional.  His relationship with his son David is virtually non-existent, but David takes this outlandish opportunity to see if there is a way to develop some sort of bond.

Their journey is a fragmented one.  After Woody trips and falls in a hotel room, they are sidelined for a few days in the small town in Nebraska where Woody grew up.  It is here where the bulk of the movie takes place.  Soon Woody and David are joined by Woodys wife, Kate (June Squibb) and other son Ross (Bob Odenkirk).  Nostalgia abounds as David becomes immersed with family and friends of Woodys who he has not seen since he was a child.

As news of Woodys supposed wealth reaches the ears of the sleepy Nebraska town, Woody becomes the man of the hour, and David begins to learn things about his fathers past that help him understand a father hes never really understood.  Payne also spins his web of deadpan humor to take the film beyond a simple father-son story, making some thoughtful observations about old age, mental and physical decline, and family.

Overall, Nebraska is Paynes most simplistic and laid back film.  However, it is moody, touching, and very well acted.  While Dern receives most of the accolades, Forte is the unsung hero of this film.  The Saturday Night Live vets first dramatic turn is excellent, and he is the perfect foil to Derns cryptic and obsessive personality.  In addition, Squibb is outstanding as Woodys long-suffering but clearly loving wife Kate.  Also nominated for an Oscar, Squibbs performance is the most successful source of humor throughout the film.  In a very revealing family-reunion scene, Squibb has the audience roaring with laughter after a few choice and well-deserved expletives aimed at some greedy family members.

Nebraska is a small movie with relatively small ambitions.  At the heart of the film is David and Woodys quest for acceptance, albeit in very different ways, and it is relatively successful.  While no masterpiece, this is a fine entry for Payne and a great collection of performances.  B",1393891200,,3226,4.904059040590406

6152144,3,B00H9L28OO,"While this movie was very slow moving & hard to watch a person aging with Alzheimers, Bruce Dern was very good although not much dialog on his part, his actions broke my heart. I know the wife was up for an Oscar & she was supposed to be a real biouch but I could not take her voice. The one I admired the most was the younger son. Who would do all that for his father who drank through his childhood & wasn't there for him. I cried when the friends found the letter & made fun of Woody thinking he won the million dollars & glad the son punch the old guy out. Although slow moving, slow dialog (except for the mother who was annoying) I am glad I stuck with it. I wondered how the heck are they going to end this movie. It was the most terrific ending I have ever seen. Again what son would do all that for his father. When Woody drove down the Main Street of his  hometown with a Winner's Hat on a truck & a compressor (which is all he said he wanted from the million) I was thrilled & for his son to let him think the Publishers would only go so far in his winnings. (although you gathered Woody really knew what his son had done.) I think all young adults should watch this movie because this could happen to their parents. It shows how one can have compassion for their parent/parents who maybe were or were not the greatest parent/parents when they were growing up. Most kids grow up with resentments but not this son. I think he sould have won an Oscar for that part, I applaud him how well his compassion came across in this movie.",1393891200,,1539,4.13

The son was always seeking that idealized father-son moment; he sort of got it in the end. But it was all through his effort. The father was a burnt-out alcoholic by then. Forgiveness is divine. The perfect movie to validate co-dependency. Maybe the viewer will experience some existential evasion. I mean, hell, if we live long enough, that's how it will be.",1393891200,,535,4.702127659574468

The writing is great.  The roles were played exceptionally well.  I loved the scene where Woody's wife was at the cemetery.  It isn't a tear jerker or a laugh out loud comedy but the feelings are there all the same.  Coming from a very small town in Illinois this was like looking in a mirror.  A bit slow at times but when it catches up to itself it is well worth watching.,1393891200,,533,4.106796116504855

Dern delivers an outstanding performance and for that alone, the film is well worth watching.  June Squibb however, seems to have been all but overlooked in a stellar performance delivered as Dern's wife.  If there is any weakness in the cast, it comes early from Will Forte who, while growing in the role as one of Dern's two sons, never quite makes it in the performance.

6152203,4,B00H9L28OO,Nebraska is a moving tribute to a family's struggle to love and support their aging father who suffers from dementia.,1393891200,,117,4.9
6152204,5,B00H9L28OO,"By now everyone knows the premise: Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) is a man wandering the edges of senility who mistakes a sweepstakes come-on for a million-dollar prize. His long-suffering son David (Will Forte) decides to drive his dad from Billings, Mont., to Lincoln, Neb., to claim the nonexistent winnings. He figures it's probably his last chance to connect with a father he barely knows.

Sounds melancholy, and it is -- but what's surprising is how funny this film is, too. Along the way, David and Woody stop to visit relatives in their old hometown. When Woody mentions his million-dollar prize, the relatives believe it -- as does Woody's crafty former business partner (Stacey Keach). Nearly all of them figure that, dang it, they've always known Woody and should be entitled to some of his good luck. Some truly memorable scenes follow, during which David comes to realize the kind of life his father led.

This is a great movie. Maybe it will be a classic. In some movies the use of black-and-white is a distracting affectation; here it suits the material precisely. The supporting players, with the exception of Keach and Forte, aren't instantly recognizable and seem as if they just stepped out of the local IGA.

My only quibble is with the Oscar nominations. While Dern was nominated for his able portrayal of a confused old coot, the most compelling performance comes from Will Forte, who has to register a gamut of emotions in nearly every scene. In one of my favorites scenes, he's in a room full of old men, silently reacting to a rambling, truly absurd conversation about cars. It's hilarious and poignant at the same time. Kind of like the whole movie, I guess.",1393891200,2,1679,4.822916666666667

The person I watched it with wondered why it was filmed in greyscale. At first, I said, let's just watch it and be open-minded. By the middle of the movie, I was of the opinion that the greyscale was downright pretentious and pointless.

  Other reviewers who claim it is ""boring"" are missing the point of the film.  The pacing is intentionally slow so as to be graceful and to match the ""gait"" of Bruce Dern's character.

All the acting is effective and drags you in even when it gets super slow. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone under 40 + -. It will depend upon you reference point in life or how old you are. Old farts will love it especially if you have relatives in similar conditions. Don't even think of taking teen's or younger unless they have aged beyond their years.,1393804800,,517,4.232323232323233

He wants to go to Nebraska and pick up his prize (he doesn't trust the mail). After a while, because his dad is so stubborn, the son agrees to take him there, and along the way there's a lot of family drama, beautifully black and white scenery, and new understandings among father and son, son and brother, mother and son, etc.  It's not a knock-your-socks-off kind of movie, but it is engaging and well done.",1393804800,,708,4.566929133858268

To my mind there was a great reason for black and white movies--FIFTY YEARS AGO when that's all there was.  Since the arrival of color, I am not a purist that thinks films are more ""artistic"" in black and white--I like to see the color!  I also doubted my wife would watch, as it did not seem ""her type"" of film.

As it turned out we both watched the entire thing without one break and we really liked it.

Yes this is a mainly serious film, so a good question to ask yourself at the outset is, ""Why did the director choose to make this film?  What does he want to say to the viewer?""  With a movie like this, it's not obviously about making as much money as possible, nor appealing to popular things like car chases, explosions, sex scenes or potty jokes.  I have my idea of an underlying message for the film, but will keep it to myself and just make some general observations.

The pace of the movie is slow throughout.  Much slower than the usual ""Hollywood movie"".  Dialog is also somewhat limited--often even to a comic degree.  Dern's lines are typically one-sentence answers to questions (often short sentences, at that).  The whole movie takes place in small and rather poor rural towns between Billings Montana and Lincoln, Nebraska.  Part of the back story is that the main character (played by Bruce Dern), and his wife (played by June Squibb), had grown up in Nebraska but later moved to Billings to try running their own business.

As the movie begins there's an open question for the family and audience whether Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) is becoming demented (either Alzheimer's, or maybe just too many years of hard drinking).  Or is he just hard of hearing, or some of both?  The main plot hook is he got one of those ""Publisher's Clearinghouse Sweepstakes"" type letters, and as a result he is CONVINCED he has WON a million dollars.  He just has to go to Lincoln to collect!  But he no longer has a car and his family fear even allowing him to drive.  So he keeps setting out ON FOOT to get to Lincoln.

Finally his younger son Dave agrees to drive him to Lincoln, just so he can see for himself that he won NOTHING.  The pair of them end up the main duo for the film.  Woody's whole life, it seems, has been spent drinking, trying to run a not very lucrative business, and not talking much about anything to anyone.  During the course of the trip Dave, in tiny pieces, begins to learn more than he ever knew about both his dad and his mom, simply because they never talked much with the kids about their past.

We also see a fair amount of the older brother Ray (somewhat more successful than Dave, but Dave doesn't seem to resent it), and Kate, (June Squibb) who is undoubtedly the funniest part of this movie.  She's an inveterate gossip who hardly ever has anything good to say about anyone.  For example, her ""paying her respects"" at the cemetery in the town where they grew up involves her telling David every bad aspect about everyone buried there).

We also see the hurtful side of humanity as friends and relatives (who all believe Woody's claim that he won a million dollars) all try to talk or threaten him into sharing some of his (non-existent) new-found wealth.  As Kate trenchantly observes, ""Good God!  Usually someone has to DIE before the BUZZARDS start circling!)

This movie has a unique charm.  Often in movies I start re-writing characters' lines in my head, wishing they would explain JUST A LITTLE MORE in a conversation.  Here, despite the sparse dialog, less truly was more.  For example: Kate and Woody appear to detest each other.  She's constantly running him down to his sons, while he's standing right there.  For his part, he tries to tune her out (it appears he's not so much hard of hearing as he is IGNORING people).  Yet in one brief moment, when Woody is lying in a hospital bed, napping after falling down and konking his head, Kate gently, tenderly brushes his hair back while chiding her sleeping husband, ""You old fool....""",1393804800,,4104,4.51831750339213

It seemed like it would be drab and depressing but this character driven drama resonated with me perhaps because I had dealt with some of the issues faced by the two sons when dealing with their senior father Woody. ""Nebraska"" may lack explosions, a high concept premise (all good things in this case) but still manages to be involving if you give the film a chance.

SPOILERS:

Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) has received one of those letters that indicates he's won a million dollars. Woody takes this bit of junk mail seriously. His son David (Will Forte) decides to take his father to ""collect"" his million dollars driving him from Billings, Montana to Lincoln Nebraska hoping that it will bring his father back to reality when he realizes he hasn't won anything at all.

David and Woody learn quite a bit about each other in the process and, when David's brother Ross (Bob Odenkirk) and their mom (June Squibb) this road trip reminds them why they are important to each other even when they can't stand each other some of the time.

END OF SPOILERS:

Director Alexander Payne's decision to do the film in black and white is quite daring; the film strips the images to the bone portraying the often bleak landscape as reflections of the lost hope of Woody and his strained relationship with his sons who feel he needs to be in a home.

Bruce Dern and June Squbb both received deserved Oscar nominations for their performances but I can't neglect the marvelous performances of two comedians Will Forte and Bob Odenkirk who continue to demonstrate their skills as actors giving strong support. Stacey Keach gives a marvelous supporting performance as well as Woody's former partner in his auto repair business who still has a grudge against him.

Unlike some reviewers here, I feel that ""Nebraska"" does have a moment of redemption at the conclusion of the film.

The Blu-ray looks marvelous with a crisp, sharp looking presentation. Director of photography Phedon Papamichael focuses on textures since colors aren't an option here and those textures are nicely rendered.

The audio is, not surprisingly, almost as black and white focusing on textures as the visuals with a sharp sounding 3.0 presentation. Dialgo is, naturally, front and center and, while directional sounds are as sparse as the images at times, the 3.0 presentation does highlight the score by Matt Orton.

The only special feature is a nearly 30 minute documentary on the making of the movie. It covers everything from the inspiration for writer Bob Nelson to the cast and their experience working with director Payne. We also get itunes and Ultraviolet codes for the film.

I do wish we had a commentary track from Payne or, at least, the writer and/or cast but the documentary on the making of the film is pretty darn good.",1393718400,3,2825,4.828157349896481

6152321,5,B00H9L28OO,"Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) is a man who lived a life of little consequence.  He grew up in the U.S. heartland, served his country in Korea, married Kate(June Squibb), and had two boys.  When the film begins Woody is ambling down the interstate in Billings, Montana in a disheveled state telling the police officer that he's going to Lincoln, Nebraska to claim a prize he thinks he won through a magazine publishers sweepstakes.  Kate is livid at the delusional Woody wanting to put him in a home.  The youngest son, David(Will Forte), is more accommodating driving Woody to Lincoln himself to dispel the fantasy.  The purpose of the trek is twofold.  For Woody its an opportunity for redemption, a chance for some significance to his life as it winds down.  For David, who is coming off a recent breakup of a two year relationship, not only is the purpose to quell Woody's delusions but a chance to reconnect with the early stage Alzheimer's Woody before it is too late.  Director Alexander Payne frames this film brilliantly contrasting in luxurious black-and-white cinematography the harsh Midwestern landscape against Woody's weather beaten visage.  This in turn mirrors the odyssey of Dern who after a career as a celebrated supporting actor is given a role that summarizes his journey as an artist.  His Woody is a man of few words and there's not a wasted gesture or  expression with Dern defining him with his mournful eyes.  If there is a scene that defines the film it's the one where Woody with little emotion relates how his younger brother died of scarlet fever when the child was two years old.  Squibb takes the opposite tack by painting the feisty Kate in broad strokes not afraid to drop a vulgarity here and there.  This is a career opportunity for the octogenarian Squibb and she embraces it like hellfire.  Forte, best known from his days on ""Saturday Night Live"", is appropriately restrained.  He probably has more dialogue than anyone in the film but he wisely demurs to his elders.  I don't think Payne is making any earth shattering statements other than the importance of closure in a person's life.  It's the utter lack of pretense of ""Nebraska"" that gives it resonance.",1393718400,14,2193,4.818181818181818

6152359,4,B00H9L28OO,"Director Alexander Payne has had wild success in writing and directing stories (The Descendents, Sideways) about fragile individuals who are looking for a purpose and meaning amid love and heartbreak.  In Nebraska, he takes a gem of a screenplay by Bob Nelson about a fateful road trip and elicits strong performances from a terrific cast.

An elderly man, Woody Grant (Bruce Dern), is determined to travel cross country from Billings, Montana, to Lincoln, Nebraska, to claim a million dollar prize despite the objections of his wife Kate (June Squibb) and skeptical son, David (Will Forte).  He has a habit of wandering off much to the frustration of his family including Davids older brother Ross (Bob Odenkirk).  An alcoholic with a painful past, Woody takes the long road trip accompanied by David.  Along the way, they stop by the town of Hawthorne for an impromptu family reunion where news of Woodys windfall spreads, and with it come greedy family and friends particularly in the person of an old buddy, Ed (Stacy Keach).  As Woody and David approach their destination, old memories are revived and a father and son bond.

Payne creates a reality that successfully conveys a feeling of family and its dysfunction, which makes the story believable and authentic.  While David realizes that he has nothing in common with his extended relatives (and you might not want them in your family either), you sure as heck won't forget them!

The film is divided into a series of vignettes, some with amusing payoffs.  Woody rarely filters his thoughts as evidenced in his explanation to David about how Woody and Kate started a family.  It is a gem.  There is an outrageous moment near the end when the brothers David and Ross attempt to right a wrong with hilarious results.

The journey is the point of the story. There are similarities in theme and characterizations to The Straight Story.  David uses the trip as a way to get closer to his dad. In fact he learns some surprising things about Woody via the local newspaper and a certain female with a shared past.

Veteran actor Bruce Dern (Coming Home) makes the most of the role of a lifetime as a father looking for redemption.  In the last chapter of his life, Woody does not have many prospects or things to look forward to, but he does have a prize that motivates him and is a sense of pride.  It gives his empty life meaning.  Grumpy and blunt, he can be confused and oblivious at times, but when he isn't drinking at a local bar, he has moments or clarity and recall that can be jarring.

The revelation here is the natural acting abilities of former Saturday Night Live player, Will Forte, who is completely convincing as the dutiful son, David.  June Squibb is quite good as the mom who speaks her mind and proves a nice counterpoint to Woody.  Her scene at the family cemetery is a riot.

The town of Hawthorne is not unlike the Midwest town featured in The Last Picture Show.  Gorgeously Photographed in black and white amid a Midwest landscape, the film uses its setting to great effect as the towns and farmland become characters too like the old, derelict family house which serves as a touchstone replete with memories and demons. A grassroots country musical score complements the visuals.

In a way this is not only a fathers quest  la Don Quixote but a sons search for his familys roots.  The film makes a point of Woodys reasons for getting his pot of gold, and it comes down to family legacy.  What are the things that matter and what do we leave for future generations? You root for him and want his prize to be genuine, but there are riches to be mined along the way.  Its also about setting things straight as exemplified by Davids final act.  Its ultimately a familys unusual journey but particularly a sons love for his father.",1393632000,3,3804,4.678195488721805

It just fails to deliver in any real way. The story is simple but for some reason that simplicity migrates to the characters and script. There are no real funny lines, not depth to any of the roles, and the whole thing left me feeling like I had just had a milk shake with no flavor at all. I had hoped this might be an opportunity for Bruce Dern to shine and hopefully gain a Oscar, but I really cant see it happening if the movie is to provide the merit.

It is for me one of those cases where the hype exceeded the delivery...at least for me. It is certainly no ""Sideways"" not by a long measure.",1393632000,,766,4.2827586206896555

6152400,5,B00H9L28OO,"This quirky dramedy filmed in black & white is lifted from what would probably have been a very good film with any lead, to outstanding due to the performance of Bruce Dern. Dern, who is 77 in real life, is Woody Grant, an old boozy coot in the beginning stages of dementia, who thinks he's won a million dollars in one of those magazine contests; and insists on traveling from his home in Montana to Nebraska to pick up his check. The rest of his family - his two sons and wife - try to keep him home and talk about putting him in a nursing home...but then his youngest son, David, played superbly by Will Forte, decides to take him to Lincoln to spend some quality time with him. In addition to Dern and Forte, look for a wonderful performance by June Squibb, as Woody's wife, Kate; and a good performance by Bob Odenkirk as David's older brother, Ross. Stacy Keach takes a good turn as Ed Pegram, an old reprobate, and former associate of Woody's in his Nebraska home town. In turn humorous and bittersweet, this is a very intelligently written human interest story about aging and an elegy to family values. Alexander Payne continues his reputation for making excellent films; and Bruce Dern may have put a capstone on a fine career with this performance.",1393545600,,1259,4.526315789473684

6152425,1,B00H9L28OO,"Napoleon Dynamite had grotesque stereotypes of small-town Americans, but what made it anything other than a mind-numbingly boring movie was that it also had a good script, humorous dialogue and acting that at least fit what the story called for. This movie has none of those things. I'm all about slow, introspective indie films, so this is not the case of me wanting to see Tom Cruise melt the face off of a Kaiju. Its just sad that so many people think its cool JUST BECAUSE IT IS A SLOW INDIE FILM. There is nothing else good about it. Some are saying that it gives a glimpse into ""Modern Americana"". That in itself cannot be a reason for giving a movie a high rating. If you want to get an insight into ""Americana"", go to a museum. The point of a movie is to tell a story, and everything else must be secondary and subservient to that. There has to be an interesting story and good acting. All of the actors except for Stacy Keach and Bruce Dern look and act like they are reading the excruciatingly dull lines off of the script. This movie is like every film student's first movie. It takes itself too seriously, the acting is bad, the characters are not much more than stereotypes, and the jokes are stale, because the actors don't deliver them with any kind of realism. This film is worth watching if you are the family of those involved, to support their egos. Other than that, forget it. People must have been paid a lot of money to nominate this. Everyone is crazy. Rotten Tomatoes 98 percent? What? You can only spend 5 minutes on a scene where a son lets his father drive the car (I know, major spoiler alert) if you made a great movie.

Dad is laconic, flinty, yet fragile, gruff but somehow gentle.  For a tough and resolute alcoholic, Woody Grant, the father, played by Bruce Dern, has oddly sensitive eyes.  They are reflected in the empathetic face of his son David, played by Will Forte.  Don't get me wrong, there are some difficult moments--the magazine marketing scam, idiot cousins, evil and shallow townspeople.  For me it was reminiscent of The Trip to Bountiful in that same understated way it had of examining humorous, tender, and also awful, moments of life and human character.  Yes, I have searched for my dad's dental plate.  (Just not on the railroad tracks.)  Yes, I have taken my mother to an unfamiliar ER after she fell on a trip across South Dakota.

6152456,5,B00H9L28OO,"I have recently been just about ready to give up on Hollywood because of all the garbage it puts out. I find that European films are characteristically more complex, sensitive, and mature than the standard Hollywood fare. I think of ""In a Better World"" as one recent example. Nebraska, however, comes as an utterly refreshing (and admittedly surprising) Hollywood exception. Not only does it present a geographical picture of the American Midwest (for whatever that's worth), but(more importantly) it speaks volumes about current state of our society; a commentary on the degradation and emptiness of contemporary American life. The cousins who can't find work, and so just sit around. The semantic difference between sexual assault and rape. The idea that a hospital stay would cost more than a million dollars. The shallowness, selfishness and pettiness within relationships. The nearly dead main street, with for lease signs all over. The focus on TV (extend that to cellphones, iPads, etc), and media as the central distractor. The movie paints a tapestry in this way. It is a classic. No wonder some may see the movie as being depressing. It's all a mirrored reflection of devolving life in America. Sad, but true. At the same time that it does this so well, interestingly enough, it contains a message of hope through love expressed not merely in words, but in actions. So all the dark, real life commentary comes head to head with this love, and in the end love - unsurprisingly - comes out the winner. Beyond everything else, love never fails. It triumphs. Oh, and yes there are just so many funny moments in this movie. Funny in the sense of how the movie is spot on in capturing reality as it is in our contemporary life. The acting was great all around.

6152470,5,B00H9L28OO,"There's a lot about NEBRASKA for contemporary audiences to hate. It's in black-and-white, for one. Yuck. Also, the story and acting are all incredibly subtle and patient, and -- aside from a mugging and a quick right hook -- it's fair to say almost nothing happens in the film. Depending on how close you are with your own father or son, you might also find the movie depressing. People who live on the coast might watch the film and find themselves pitying Middle America with a bad taste in their mouths. People from the Heartland might easily feel mocked.

But these responses, however legit, are certainly coming from people who are only giving the film a surface-level viewing.

Painfully funny (if rarely in a ""ha ha!"" kind of way), the movie follows a quiet man named David as he takes his father, Woody, on a trip to Nebraska in order to claim a million dollar prize. Woody, always shown with a half-vacant gaze and Doc Brown haircut, doesn't appear to operate on the same plain of awareness as anyone else. It's easy to think he's teetering on the edge of senility, but many of his remarks and responses indicate a man who is not suffering from decrepitude so much as ennui or despair.

In fact, the movie is chock full of people who seem to view life as a giant waiting room for some kind of Great Bland Hereafter. You will not find anyone in this film with a whole lot of passion, as if most of the cast were an embodiment for the apathetic sterility of the gray flatland that makes up the film's heart-breaking scenery. In spite of what feels like a near total apathy in the characters, there are glints and glimmers of satisfaction in the quiet, simple lives these characters lead, whether they're running hometown newspapers or just sitting by the side of the road and watching the cars go by.

The real story is one of connection between father and son, and it happens at such a slow simmer that it's nearly impossible to tell when and where the relationship fully flowers into understanding. Thankfully, the film never resorts to sappiness or schmaltz, and it absolutely refuses to moralize with the script, the closest you get to a moral coming in the following exchange:

A: ""What's wrong with your father? Alzheimers?""
B: ""No. He just believes what people tell him.""
A: ""That's too bad.""

Delivered with the same dead-pan as nearly every other line, what is both sad and hilarious about that exchange is easy to miss in the stark black-and-white silence of the rest of the film. But it neatly encapsulates the point of the film: belief, connection, and how it's too bad that neither of those things ever come so easily or so neatly. A lesson that's easier said than learned, it matches this film that will try the patience of hastier viewers, but which will reward those who don't mind sitting by the road for a while and just waiting contentedly to see what happens to pass by.",1393459200,2,2897,4.604651162790698

6152477,5,B00H9L28OO,"'Nebraska' is a gem of a film that has been overlooked by many in Hollywood. However, the storyline and the acting has been given great kudos by those who have seen the film. Filmed in black and white, it brings the melancholy and decay of Nebraska and the life of these characters to the forefront. The story of a man looking for something is told with great charm and many well placed words.

Bruce Dern plays an aging man, Woody, with some senility probably due to his great alcohol consumption over the years. He sits at home and does nothing. His wife, Kate, played by June Squibb, is loud and proud and keeps no holes barred. She says it like it is, and often it is risqu and pretty darn funny. Will Forte plays one son, David, who sells electronics in a store in town in Billings, Montana. Another son, Ross, played by Bob Odenkirk is a newsman on the local television station. Mom has run the family for years, Woody with his alcohol, an absent father it seems. Bruce is somehow taken in by a letter in the mail from a firm selling magazine subscriptions but promising a million dollars. Woody decides to go and fetch the money himself. Unable to drive since he lost his driving license, and his wife refuses to drive him, so he starts walking to Lincoln, Nebraska. David realizing Woody is not going to give up decides to drive him. David wants to get away from a relationship gone bad, and spending time with his dad will be good for both of them.

The journey is heartwarming and sad at the same time. Will Forte has really shown his acting chops. June Squibb is a true character and deserves her supporting actress role, but it is Bruce Dern who shines. The old codger, not saying much, brain addled with alcohol, but wanting something for his family. Truly an endearing film, anyone who comes from a family will enjoy it.

Bruce Dern stayed within character made easier by his terse script.  But, he does give us a glimpse that his senility does not detract from his ability to manipulate family and friends.  The acting of his son (Will Forte) was generally lackluster.  I do not understand the acclaim showered upon to June Squibb as her script was most responsible for the effectiveness of her character.

Those who have cared for elderly relatives will recognize many of the character traits and may laugh at some and be annoyed by others.  The parasitic and stereotypical greed displayed by characters was also effectively annoying and the B&W film conveys depressed settings for a story that is almost as depressing.

They pass through Hawthorne, Woody's old home town to meet his brother. The rest of the family shows up as do old friends. David ends up learning more about his family history than he really wanted to know.

Filmed in black and white, the film takes on the air of the past and of despair. Much of the humor consists of laughing at senility and David's disgust with the truth. The film isn't really funny or gritty. You wade through scenes that show local flavor such as a bunch of old men sitting quietly in front of a TV watching football, occasionally talking about a 1979 Buick. Oh yea. People claim this is one of the good scenes. Nominated for all kinds of stuff, but not nearly as good as ""The Book Thief"" which wasn't.

But this is such a melancholy film.  It was really great to see Will Forte again.  He's a gem of an actor and very versatile, as well as great to watch just in his vanilla (self) character.

If you grew up in a small town, had family problems, or anything along that line, or are otherwise depressed, I wouldn't recommend this film.  I love film noir and would rate the film ""Pii"" higher on the happiness scale than this.  It's just so depressing.  The father and son (both sonsBob Odenkerk was very welcome here too) element was probably the only uplifting element of the film.  Everything else was a depressed man chasing a dream.

If you're happy and upbeat, and want to watch all of the nominees for the Academy Awards this year, then go for it.  It's a great film.  But if you're anywhere lower than that, mentally, this film will really, really drain you; make you really question life.  I guess that's what a great film does.

I wasn't really sure what to expect from this. After watching it I have to admit the movie is also kind of hard to describe. While it's not exciting or fast moving it really isn't slow either. The movie is not depressing but it also isn't a happy movie. You know from the beginning what is going to happen when Woody reaches his destination but the longer the movie goes on the more you hope you are wrong. This really shows how people act when the possibility of those they know become rich. That isn't always a good thing. There are some funny parts in this but I would not consider this a comedy. Alexander Payne's movies (About Schmidt, Decendents) have a certain feel so if you have seen his other ones then you know what to expect.

6152564,4,B00H9L28OO,"Nebraska is another of those movies that I would never have gone to see (or probably even rented) if it wasn't nominated for Best Picture. I don't think it's a ""best picture,"" but I am glad I saw it. Of all of this year's best picture nominees, it is probably the one that will linger the longest in my mind despite it's very subdued quality as a movie.

And it is subdued. Slow moving. And black-and-white, which adds to the subdued quality. I've been trying to figure out what the movie would be like in color, and I can't really imagine it that way. Color would change the tone of the movie, which is kind of weird to me, but I think it would. It would make it not quite so somber, and it needs the somberness, the sense of depression and desperation, to make it work.

Being black and white, though, it won't appeal to a lot of people (my daughter (and, yeah, she's just a kid, but I've known plenty of adults with the same attitude) refuses to watch b&w movies out of principle. The fact that it's slow, including scenes of people just sitting around not talking, will also make it unappealing to pretty sizable chunk of people. But some of those scenes of people just sitting, or sitting and watching football, reminded me of being a kid in East Texas, and those scenes really resonated with me which has caused me to continue to think about it even though it's not at all spectacular.

The other part of that is that the movie is not what it's about. On the surface it's a movie about an old guy that seems not quite all there trying to walk to Nebraska to pick up $1,000,000 that he thinks he's won, but it's not about that. I mean, it's not about growing old and losing your grasp on reality. It's about relationships and how we don't always know people as well as we think we do, even when those people are our parents.

The acting was great. I'm not sure Bruce Dern deserves the best actor nomination, but he was very good. He really sold the depression and desperation. Okay, maybe he does deserve the nomination. The role is so... normal; it makes it hard to tell. Will Forte was even better as his younger son, David. He brought the helplessness and exasperation to the role. They were great together. And Forte was also great with Bob Odenkirk who played his older brother. They had great chemistry. June Squib was frightening and hilarious as Woody's wife.

I'm going to hold myself back, at this point, and not talk about the relationships and family dynamics, because it would require all kinds of spoilers, and I think this is the kind of movie that each person should come to on his/her own, so to speak. It probably has something different to say to any given person based on what that person is bringing into it, like my resonance with the old men in my family sitting around, mostly silently, watching football.

This one probably won't appeal to a lot of people at the outset. There are no explosions, no gunfights, and no car chases. But, if you let yourself get pulled along, I think it's one you'll find yourself pondering at odd moments for weeks (or at least days) after you see it.",1392681600,13,3111,4.43006993006993

Along the way, they stop and spend time in Woody's home town, where old friends and family are revisited(some expecting a share of Woody's ""winnings""), secrets revealed and unfinished business is resolved. The way small town America is portrayed, may be stereotyped to some, but stereotypes have a basis in fact. As someone coming from small town Wyoming, the scenes of the town and the people were so right on, I burst out laughing.

He's already directed fantastic dramas like ""About Schmidt"" and ""The Descendants"", proving he knows what he's doing. His films may be slow-moving and emotional, but by the end you feel as if you've lived with the characters for years.

Forced to face their past problems together, they embark on a unique road-trip full of funny and interesting surprises.

Payne directs beautifully, with stunning black and white visuals that knock you off your feet.

6152571,5,B00H9L28OO,"We wandered into this movie because we couldn't find anywhere to park for the other movie we wanted to see.  All in all I'd say we chose wisely.

What you get out of this will depend at least in part on with whom you watch it.  In our case, the audience was filled with cackling older people who guffawed violently every time the main characters said something obnoxious or abusive to each other.  While I see the potential for humor here I was more saddened by the abuse than amused by it.  Your results will vary wildly.

From a plot perspective this is a fairly standard offering.  The patriarch is a lost and lonely old man who has spent his life being abused by his wife and taken advantage of by his friends.  His wife is a acidic old crone who has very little nice to say about anyone, most so when it comes to her family.  The kids are detached and don't really understand what's going on and are themselves constantly the target of their mother's abuse.

Most poignantly the movie is about small towns and the people in them.  Scenes depicting family get-togethers in which everyone sat on the couch and watched TV in silence were completely true because that was exactly what my family did growing up.  In this environment conversations between people getting together after years apart commonly consistent of:

Person 1: What'r you up to?
Person 2: Nothin' much.
Person 1: Still workin'?
Person 2: Yup.

And so ends an entire evening of conversation.  This is brilliantly and accurately rendered in the movie.  Greed, jealousy, pettiness and gossip also play key roles in this film just as they do in the small towns on which the movie is based.

In summary, this movie can be funny but it can also be a vast social lesson on what it means to live a life confined to a narrow and repetitious rut and what hope can do to the people in that situation.  So choose the movie you want and you'll find it.",1391212800,12,1910,4.471098265895954

RATING: 2.5 out of 5.0

If you are a lover of 'quirk', then you will enjoy 'Nebraska', the latest from the master of quirk himself, director Alexander Payne. Understand that there is a formula to quirky movies. The protagonists are always quirky themselves, with some glaring faults, but in the end quite sympathetic and lovable. That applies to Nebraska's main character, Woody Grant (solidly played by the veteran actor, Bruce Dern). Woody has numerous faults, principally that he's a curmudgeon and an alcoholic.

Woody may be suffering from a touch of early onset dementia when a police officer finds him walking on the side of a highway, mumbling how he's determined to trek all the way to Nebraska on foot, in order to claim a $1 million Publisher's Clearing House sweepstakes notice he received in the mail. Woody's son David (played by comedian Will Forte, in a straight guy role), wants to prevent additional ill-fated wanderings, so he agrees to drive his father from their home in Billings, Montana, all the way to sweepstakes headquarters in Lincoln, Nebraska. For me, Woody seems simply an irascible and stubborn curmudgeon, rather than an Alzheimer's victim, so I had trouble believing that he would actually believe that he was a sweepstakes winner.

Once you accept the unlikely premise, it's not hard to believe what happens next. Basically Woody and David get waylaid after Woody goes on a bender, trips and falls (resulting in a gash on his head that requires stitches at the hospital) and then loses his dentures, forcing the hapless pair to back track to a railway yard where, after a short search, recover the old man's false teeth. With the day shot, David convinces Woody to go to his father's old haunting grounds in the town of 'Hawthorne', where they visit Woody's brother.

At this point, the second half of the definition of the 'quirky movie' can be explained. The 'antagonists' who comprise these 'quirkfests' are not only 'quirky', but nasty too. Sometimes these characters are outright caricatures (such as the 'twins' who end up assaulting David, to get their hands on Woody's sweepstakes notice); or perhaps they're more nuanced like Ed (played by the other veteran in this picture, Stacy Keach). No matter how fine Payne manages to draw his antagonists, he can't escape accusations that he looks down on them.

Payne's air of condescension has not gone unnoticed by a gaggle of professional film critics. Here are a few examples: A.A. Dowd (The A.V. Club): ""It's when Nebraska veers off the road, and into the one-horse town David grew up in, that condescending comedy begins to take precedence.""; Jessica Kiang (The Playlist): ""...the rounding out of Woody's character and back-story happens largely at the expense of the local citizens, relatives and townspeople -- in trying to make us understand Woody, Payne kind of makes us despise almost everyone else, notably the film's ""villain"" Ed (the terrific Stacy Keach). There is a troubling air of condescension in the portrayal of a lot of these folks as either venal and grasping, or just plain stupid. ''; Lou Lumenick (NY Post): Bob Nelson's original script, a sort of unlikely cross between ""The Last Picture Show'' and ""The Miracle of Morgan's Creek,'' offers a biting satire of Midwestern life that Payne sometimes allows to border on condescension.''

Payne depicts Woody's old friends and relatives in the old town all managing to take the low road, whether it involves hypnotically staring at a Sunday football game on TV en masse, some cheesy karaoke warbling and being stupid enough not to ask a few questions that would confirm that Woody did not win the $1 million. Things get even more ugly when the old friends start trying to hit Woody up for a piece of the sweepstakes winnings, claiming he borrowed money from them in the past. Fortunately for Woody, his equally curmudgeonly and foul-mouthed wife, Kate, intervenes, preventing the townspeople from inflicting further physical damage on her husband and sons.

If there's anything redeeming about 'Nebraska', it's in the depiction of the bonding between father and son. David's gracious gift to Woody (in the form of a pickup truck trade-in), allows Woody to get in one last dig, at his unpleasant former friends.

'Nebraska' also benefits greatly from some gorgeous black and white cinematography which highlight the bleak but haunting Midwest landscapes. The acting here is quite good as the cast seem like they're straight out of the artist Grant Wood's masterpiece, 'American Gothic'. What's missing here is Payne's ability to sympathize with the crowd he's determined to criticize. For him, everything is 'black and white'; I say better to draw both your good guys and bad guys, in more nuanced 'shades of gray'.",1390608000,10,4813,5.021303258145363
6152573,5,B00H9L28OO,"I don't understand some of the reviews for Alexander Payne's ""Nebraska."" Gritty and unsentimental the film certainly is, but the assertion that it's crueler than anything by the Coen Brothers is nonsensical to me. Payne's direction and Bob Nelson's screenplay reveal successive layers of both brutality and poignancy in the story of Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) an old man in Billings, Montana, who clings stubbornly to the idea that he has won $1 million in the Publishers' Clearinghouse sweepstakes. David (Will Forte), Woody's hapless son, offers to drive him to Lincoln, Nebraska, just to prove to him he didn't win a cent. But Woody's sudden illness waylays father and son in Woody's home town of Hawthorne, Nebraska, where Woody's family members and old friends take Woody's claims of sudden wealth at face value.

""Nebraska"" is a masterpiece of wry humor, and has a keen eye for the tensions that build up within families. Exemplifying those tensions is Kate (June Squibb), Woody's wife, who expresses her disappointments in no uncertain (or chaste) terms. There's also a lot of meanness in the film, exemplified by Woody's old crony Ed Peagram (Stacy Keach) and David's weirdo cousins Bart and Cole (Tim Driscoll, Devin Rattray). But the final emotion we feel in ""Nebraska"" is love, as Woody expresses things he never said before and David learns things he never knew before. It is that tenderness at ""Nebraska's"" core that makes it a transcendent experience. Phedon Papamichael's photography of the Great Plains is as starkly beautiful as anything in ""The Last Picture Show,"" and the acting--particularly that of Dern, Forte, and Squibb--could not possibly be finer, funnier, or more nuanced. ""Nebraska"" is one of the finest films of 2014.",1389225600,18,1744,5.140845070422535
6152574,5,B00H9L28OO,"I don't know how Hollywood found all my uncles and cousins to play the bit parts in this film! I thought most of 'em were dead. The women were probably easier to cast; just stand outside the only grocery store in my home town (Wells, Minnesota) and sign 'em up. ""Hawthorne, Nebraska"" ain't on the map but I'd recognize it in a wink; it's Lake Wobegon way further woe-begone and with sentiment washed off. Don't be fooled by the assertion that the film is in black-and-white! Gray-on-gray is the real color scheme of cultural stagnation and senility in the ""back sixty"" acreage of the high prairie states. Gray are all the heads, gray the faded siding on the farm houses, and gray the prospects for anyone under thirty still living there.
There were lots o' laughs from the urban audience in the the theater where I saw Nebraska, but they were ""laughs at"" rather than ""laughs with."" Since the real-life peers and look-alikes of these characters are, some of them, dear to me, I felt uneasy laughing but I couldn't help it. ""Nebraska"" doesn't glamorize its cast of petty, narrow-minded, selfish small towners as 'salt of the earth.' They're unredeemed and outlandish. Comparison with ""Fargo"" and other Coen Brothers films is inevitable, but ""Nebraska"" is grittier and - because it's so realistic - crueler than anything from the Coens. Only the younger son of the almost-demented old boozer is assigned any sort of human decency or generosity of spirit ... and he's a dead-end loser, a home theater system salesman living in a claptrap apartment in Billings and wondering whether he hasn't failed to get a grip on real life yet in his solitary thirties. The old man is acted by Bruce Dern, but if you remember Dern from older films I guarantee you won't recognize him. That's the mark of fine acting.
And the film is the best of the year, at least of those I've seen, in every category: screen play, direction, leading and supporting actors, cinematography, even the subtle almost subliminal sound track. Unless you're likely to be offended by such a forthright harsh portrayal of run-down rural America, you must see ""Nebraska"" before your next family reunion in Pothole, USA.",1387756800,2,2175,4.818181818181818
6152575,4,B00H9L28OO,"Nebraska is a stark and harsh look into the waning time in old peoples lives till dusty death.

It is a grim movie studded with dead pans as if were a Taylor casting in a WoodyAllen movie that enhanced the near death experience of everyday life with seniors in the 70s age range. Gone are our abilities to hold our urine, fecal matter, and the drool most  excellent today, surely,  a sign of robust health. That is why drug stores and supermarkets have a wide array of
adult diapers. Life is good if you are exceptionally rich.

Nebraska is a movie down the highway of death with the everyday dullard and mundane as sign posts. Black & white
photography makes the motion picture even more barren and empty. The aged live a pitiful and pathetic existence.

Surely death is a respite. There was some humor but not enough to hold off the Grim Reaper or the desire to do so

The movie is pathetic and pitiful and does life well. It is a lot tedious for sure. I nodded off. The authorities hounding
me to death 24/7 mentioned that half the audience is asleep. I believed it.

If you want to see what your life will hold for you in your 70s-see it.

Me, I am 69 to be 70 in May next. I took a foot scooter to see this boring masterpiece from over 2 miles away from the cinema, Lincoln Plaza Cinema, NYC. Used a bend bar for 100 reps before entering the theater that was airing Nebraska.

Nebraska is depressing, honest, plotting and dull. Age is surely a bitter pill to swallow.

6152576,4,B00H9L28OO,"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.

Director Alexander Payne delivers another piece of Americana and like his 2004 film ""Sideways,"" it's a road tripper.  Early on one is reminded of Peter Bogdonovich's ""The Last Picture Show.""  The vast landscapes of the great plains of Montana, South Dakota and ultimately Nebraska replace flat and dusty north Texas, but like the 1971 masterpiece, Payne chooses to shoot in black and white.

Aging and on the cusp of dementia, Woody Grant (wonderfully played by Bruce Dern) believes he has won a million dollars.  He's received one of the Publisher's Clearing House promotions and is determined to get from his home in Billings to Lincoln in order to collect his winnings.  His cranky wife, Kate (award-worthy June Squibb) won't take him so he makes a couple failed attempts at walking.  His youngest son David (Will Forte) finally agrees to take him, just to keep him from wondering off on his own.  Along the way, Woody falls in his motel room which requires a trip to the local ER.  Woody's mobility is not only impacted by his age but by the fact he sneaks in a drink whenever he can.

David convinces Woody to stay with his brother Ray over the weekend in a small withering town in Nebraska.  This is where Woody grew up.  Word leaks out that Woody has won a million dollars and everyone in town assumes it is the lottery.  Many of Woody's old friends get quickly reacquainted especially his former partner played by Stacy Keach.  Then of course, the nephews, and assorted in-laws all want a small piece of Woody's ""fortune.""  Kate and Ross, the older son (Bob Odenkirk), join the reunion and help David keep things in check.  This is where Ms. Squibb really shines.  Cantankerous as she is, she loves her husband and wants to protect him.  She has some great scenes confronting the relatives, but nothing better than when the family visits the local cemetery.

While there is plenty of humor throughout the film, it really is a loving and realistic look at a past.  Some good, some not.  Angela McEwan has some memorable scenes as the local newspaper publisher and a former sweetheart of Woody's.  A very good film with some performances that will likely be noticed at Oscar time.",1387584000,175,2230,4.75
6152577,4,B00H9L28OO,"Believe it or not, even in the 21st century of technology, black and white feature films are still relevant. For those of you that are young enough to not comprehend the fact that the VCR used to a monumental piece of technology, it probably blows your mind to imagine having to watch every single movie in back and white. But, thanks to evolution and plenty of smart people to keep pushing that hamster wheel forward, here we are in a world dominated by high definition, IMAX, and 3D. However, every now and then a director decides to do the unthinkable and revisit the landscape of colorless cinema. While he's certainly not the only director to make a movie in black and white this year, Alexander Payne still decided to go with a classic look for his newest endeavor, Nebraska.

In the film, originally written by Bob Nelson, Bruce Dern stars as Woody Grant, a stubborn, elderly man that believes he's won a million dollars from a magazine sweepstakes letter that he received in the mail. Relentlessly, Woody keeps attempting to walk (since he has no driver's license or vehicle) from his Montana hometown all the way to Nebraska to collect his winnings  despite ridicule from his wife, Kate (June Squibb) and unsuccessful attempts by his sons, David (Will Forte) and Ross (Bob Odenkirk) to restrain him.

  As it happens, David recently broke-up with his girlfriend and believes it might be best for him to get out of town for a bit. To appease his father, David decides to drive him to Nebraska  but they will make a pit-stop in Woody's hometown to see their relatives (whom they haven't seen in quite a long time). It becomes quite the unique reunion when Woody shares the news that he's about to become a millionaire. Like in most small towns, word travels fast and Woody quickly becomes the talk of the town, quickly earning the attention of his old business partner, Ed Pegram (Stacy Keach).

The film might be called Nebraska, but it has very little to do with the cornhusker state, other than it being the ideal destination for Woody. It's his persistence and ambition to make it to Nebraska to claim his prize that fuels this story, even in spite of the fact that everyone close to him knows its a complete waste of time. Other movies, like Napoleon Dynamite and Clerks come to mind after witnessing this film, not because Nebraska is black and white or a comedy, but because of the randomness of the scenario. Films of this nature, despite how silly they may seem to some, tell unique stories about unplanned courses of action, ultimately leading to a successful narrative.

Bruce Dern, a well-established and greatly respected actor, puts on the performance of a lifetime. Yes, that's a statement that is far too overused these days, but the most incredible part of the performance is that he has very few lines throughout the course of this film  a film which is completely centered on him. It's hard to decide what drives this character, and that easy to decipher from his very first scene of the film where he's already randomly walking down the road. You don't know where he's going or what he's doing half the time, but this character seems to know what he's doing  at least that's how it seems. It's also quite possible he's going crazy or on the verge of Alzheimer's. Regardless, Dern plays this character off like a carefree, tireless man (even though he's often caught napping).

Dern's co-star and onscreen son, David  portrayed by former Saturday Night Live funnyman, Will Forte, gives a relatively serious performance as a rather mild mannered, causal son. Oddly enough, if you were expecting the humor to come from the MacGruber star, you will surely be disappointed. Instead, the majority of the comedic relief comes from Dern's unfiltered wife, Kate  portrayed by the delightful June Squibb. She is a dominant presence in each and every single one of her scenes, and is clearly the commanding figure in the family. She's vulgar at times, but will quickly earn the admiration of viewers. In fact, she might even be in line for a few nominations come award season  and if so, she should be considered a serious contender.

Overall, Nebraska is a warm, heart-filled film that proves that even the simplest ideas can still make for an entertaining story. The biggest hang-up with this film is the fact that it's in black and white, which has the tendency to turn some moviegoers off. However, after seeing it without color, there's little doubt it would be an entirely different animal if it were in color. Also, audience will sway towards an older audience, which is understandable since the film does center on an elderly man that thinks he's won a million dollars. Obviously, the presence of anyone under the age of 35 years sends the message that this film isn't for a younger audience to begin with, yet it still manages to depict the elderly as child-like on more than one occasion. It also shows just how greedy friends and family can become when they find out you're suddenly wealthy. In the end, Nebraska is no Grumpy Old Men or anything extreme like that if that's what you're thinking, but it definitely has its own share of outlandish, unpredictable moments. If you have the temperament for a black and white feature and just want to watch a fresh movie with outstanding acting, feel free to give this one a shot. You won't be disappointed.

6152578,5,B00H9L28OO,"On my way to 'Nebraska' earlier this winter on the bus going up Third Avenue in New York, it was bitter cold outside and two men and I, all strangers past sixty, smiled at each other in weather conspiracy. The man sitting closest to the driver introduced himself from the Deep South, and mentioned jovially that he preferred this brisk chill, adding that he had worked for many years in Alaska where the temperature dropped sometimes to 53 degrees below. The other one facing him with silver hair and pale roses in his cheeks was busy warming his hands, and quietly added that when he was in North Korea, he had experienced the same thing. Turning in my direction, he murmured with a twinkle in his eyes 'well, the whales are happy anyway', to which I nodded amused, and then a light conversation began between the three of us.

If I bring up this small anecdote, it is because it occurred to me how much these two contemporary Americans of mine have traveled, how much they probably know about America, and that one of these days I plan to pull out a map and start doing some homework on what one might call 'The Heart of America'. There is a big difference between an American and a 'New Yorker', and while friends of all nationalities have traveled the States for years, my knowledge extends to a long summer in Maine when I was a child, where these memories still conjure up the scent of honeysuckle vines lingering in the warm air.

But what about the State of Nebraska, as depicted by Alexander Payne, the director of this important movie with a brilliant cast starring Bruce Dern, and many others in a stellar performance? Mr. Payne was born in Nebraska by all accounts, and he takes the viewers on a journey that may be a memorable one for some of us in a myriad of ways. Filmed in black and white with stunning clarity, the opening begins with an old man, a derelict and vagabond by the looks of him, on a busy highway staggering painfully past the outskirts of the city of Billings in Montana with a mission in mind, and a young man by his side, his son David, attempting to stop and argue the point with him. It is not the first time that Woody, his father has tried to leave home in this way. He received via standard mail an embossed page of official-looking stationery addressed from Lincoln, Nebraska, announcing that he is the big prize winner of a $1 Million Sweepstakes Award, and the cash is just waiting for him to be collected. Elderly Woody is not taking any chances with this one and the mail delivery. He is on his way to Nebraska on foot, if necessary, to collect this sum with pride, and become a millionaire before his time runs out. He wants a new truck although he is no longer able to drive, and an air compressor which he lent to a close friend thirty years ago who never gave it back (later we run into this bully of a borrower and friend, and then further on to an ancient air compressor in a barn on another stop while driving slowly along on the country road).

""Nebraska"" is a story about a family, but it is not a 'family movie'. It takes place today during these uncertain times, and it is a serious topic that is of interest to a few of us depending on our different roles, responsibilities and age in life, not only in Nebraska but everywhere, when sobering and difficult choices have to be made, as we or our parents may be reaching the end of the road in some way. The couple depicted here and born some time after WWI, Woody and Kate Grant have two sons Ross and David, the former considered somewhat of a success for being a newscaster on the local TV channel, the latter and younger one in a sludge job, where he is beginning to wonder whether he has any options left for a better life and is operating in a vacuous indecisive rut.

Their father Woody has always been indifferent to them. He's one tough old bird, and while working on the treadmill of life with a heavy fortifying bottle in hand, he appears to have been distant from the concept of family, offspring and friends.  More in tune with nature, there is perhaps only one exception long ago, which leaves him looking briefly sad on recollection. Kate, their mother with a loud and foul mouth, is the strong feisty one here, and might be called by some of the viewers 'a piece of work', while never giving into feelings of surrender or defeat. She's had it however with her husband who was considered somewhat of a wild catch in his heyday, while her sons are arguing whether it is time to place their old man in a home for his own safety and their sanity. Although they are both sour about their father, David finally decides reluctantly to travel this last journey of unreality with his father, take a few days off from work to drive him to Nebraska to essentially look after his now helpless parent.

As a choice of characters, this viewer's attention lay focused on how David, a mild-mannered if tenacious man in his early middle-years, was going to handle this trip: whether to mend bridges with his callous father who is sinking into senility, or simply as an act of good faith for himself in the end. Perhaps for both reasons as the case may be. And here they go on an adventure, taking them from one state to another, with a brief side visit to their relatives and acquaintances, whom they haven't seen in years and were most likely planning never to see again in the fictional town of Hawthorne, Nebraska.

Kate, followed by her other son Ross, decides to join them at some point so that she is not left out of the party, and because ultimately she cares in her own unsentimental way about her family. Before they show up however, Mr. Woody Grant, to the exasperation and frustration of his son, has told everybody on the road to Nebraska that he is now a millionaire, and they in turn are all suitably impressed with glee in their eyes - a millionaire among their midst! Lots of congratulations and back-slapping are in order, followed by family meals, the appearance of lost best friends and neighbors, some old pals clamoring for past loans of various kinds, and Woody's inevitable bar-hopping to the only joint in the small poverty-stricken forsaken Hawthorne, where the healthiest past-time for senior men is pulling out a chair in front of one's house and watch the grass struggle to grow. As for the rest of the story in what is termed as a slow-paced movie, the time flew for this viewer and was pitch-perfect in so many ways. Others may have much more to add to Woody's quest, and determine whether there is in fact a conqueror of gold on this expedition to Nebraska.

There is nothing maudlin in this portrait of realism, and the flavor of the picture is as real as home-made apple pie. It is stark, bleak and powerful in a quiet way. Darkly wry in its portrayal of the lifestyle and behavior of some of its characters, and as comical as life can be on occasion, this viewer and movie companion ducked at times in disbelief and some angst. The variety of expressions alone from the people depicted, along with their posture and stance, is enough to engender a stunned reaction of mixed mirth and sobriety. Not everybody is going to feel this way, of course, and may wish with validity that none of this is happening. They may start sitting up straighter in their seats, and look at the expansive view unraveling before them, with serious stony eyes.

But on another note, the vision of space and wide-open skies in rural Nebraska is breath-taking in scope, and when Woody is revisiting his abandoned family home, looking silently at an immense barren field, it is not so much what he may be thinking, but what he is feeling at this poignant moment. And then there are some other tender moments to be found in this whole scenario of a brilliant movie that some of us may have experienced in both different and similar ways; some feelings that one can relate to, without feeling too uncomfortable in the process, and that give one cause to wonder.

The audience here at first viewing? With few exceptions, it was a generous senior one on a week-day as we expected an empty theater at this time of year. When my friend and I stepped out into the lobby slightly subdued afterwards yet with a tinge of elation, a sighting of one of the most expensive stores in Manhattan hit us in the eye with a slight punch. 'Timely', I ventured quietly, thinking of the vast poverty we had just witnessed. 'Glad I didn't see it alone', my friend replied with a flinch in her voice, causing me to reflect as rarely unsettled, she has great strength of character and endurance. Then an elegant woman of a certain age turned to us with gentle wise eyes, raising a finger to her lips, and we joined her solemnly in reading the large movie placard on an easel describing Alexander Payne's ""Nebraska"" in more detail.

Later, as we walked together in the brisk late winter afternoon, I asked my movie companion who has been traveling America for a living for nearly forty years: 'Is it really like that? When shall we go? How long would we last?', and as I listened to what she had to say and what she knew, I felt it was all true. 'Did you notice that Payne left out any sights of children, young people, or animals in his movie? Perhaps to keep our focus on this somewhat forgotten senior population? The younger generation is leaving our vast falcon prairies and coming to the big cities now', she added.

But when I reached home, and from the little I read about Nebraska, it appears that the pulse of this homeland State is beginning to be one of the first to revive at a steadfast pace, and here I shall simply say to Mr. Payne in conclusion: 'Thank you for bringing the temperature of Nebraska to us in such a rich and rewarding way'. A difficult and sensitive masterpiece of his, one that this viewer intends to see again with even greater interest than the first time and with more in-depth understanding.

6152579,4,B00H9L28OO,"""Nebraska"" (2013 release; 110 min.) is the latest movie from Alexander Payne (""Sideways"", ""The Descendants""). When the movie opens, we see an old guy, whom we later learn is Woody Grant (played by Bruce Dern), walking past the city limit sign of Billings, Montana. A police officer driving by pulls over and asks him where he's going. Woody just points beyond the horizon. It eventually comes out that Woody's got a sweepstakes letter stating that 'we are authorized to pay you $1 million dollars' and Woody, who can't drive anymore, is determined to collect the money from the sweepstakes company (located in Lincoln, NE). Woody's wife Kate (played by June Squibb) doesn't know what to do anymore as Woody has 'escaped' on several times from the house to walk all the way to Lincoln. Woody's son David (played by Will Forte) feels sorry for the old man. When asking Woody why he simply doesn't send in the letter to Lincoln via regular mail, Woody explains ""I'm not trusting the mail with 1 million dollars!"", so David offers to drive to Nebraska. They decide along the way to make a stop in Hawthorne, NE to meet up with long-lost cousins and uncles. At this point we are a good 30 min. into the movie. To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, this movie is a love letter and ode to the Midwest, and Nebraska in particular, from director Alexander Payne, himself a native Cornhusker. But beware, the movie is drenched in nostalgia, if not melancholy, as life in small town America seems to have lost a step or two along the way, take a look at (fictional) Hawthorne, NE, with its run-down main street and widespread unemployment. Second, ""Nebraska"" is filmed in dramatic back and white, and the movie brings gorgeous shots as Woody and David drive from Montana to Nebraska by way of Wyoming and South Dakota. For a while, the movie does feel like a true road movie, and it makes you want to hit the road yourself. Third, in the gatherings in Hawthorne with family and old acquaintances, you can't but help feeling sorry for the whole bunch, as everyone is convinced that Woody truly is a millionaire and they feel entitled to some of that money, reinforcing the message that money does bring out the worst in people. Last but certainly not least, much has been made by the acting performances in this film, in particular Bruce Dern as the cranky ol' man (he won Best Actor at the Cannes film festival earlier this year), and deservedly so. But for me the true scene stealer in this movie is June Squibb as his feisty ol' lady Kate, with her non-stop comments about everything and everyone. At one point, they go visit the graves of family and friends in Hawthorne, and Kate sees the grave of an old flame, just watch what she does next!

The movie premiered to great acclaim at the Cannes film festival 6 months ago, and it finally opened at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati this past weekend. I went to see it right away. The screening I saw this at was very well attended, and I think this movie has all the makings of a solid hit on the art-house theatre circuit, and maybe even more if the movie does well in the upcoming awards season. Bottom line: ""Nebraska"" is a delightful comedy-drama with some serious and nostalgic undertones, and fantastic acting performances. If you are in the mood for something that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Nebraska is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!.",1387152000,21,3553,4.656050955414012
