8452940,2,B003ZSI6SW,"My girlfriend loves orchids and likes to learn more about taking care of them. Since this is about the only DVD on the subject I could find, I went for it. Since there aren't any reviews I thought it would be worth helping people understand what this is. Even though it's burned on to a dvd-r, it's clearly transferred from a VHS tape. The audio is terrible, the graphics and visual transitions are laughable. I can't say the advice is bad but the production is lacking for sure considering the price. Amazon should discount this or be more up front about the quality.",1330732800,5,568,4.524271844660194
