2639457,5,B000HNNB0Q,"Like another reviewer, I just saw the restored TCM version of 1924's ""Beau Brummel"" with its new score by a recent winner of the TCM Young Composer's competition. It certainly does this great silent justice in both the score and the video restoration. The particular DVD version for sale here is not restored - it appears to me to just be the VHS version transferred to DVD, and I wouldn't recommend it at all. The film itself is a great showcase for John Barrymore's talents. He gets to play the spurned romantic, the comic rogue who is always laughing at everyone else, the beaten man in decline still hanging on to his dignity, and finally an insane aged man completely unaware of reality.

Brummel starts out as a young man in love with Lady Margery (Mary Astor). The feeling is mutual, but Margery's mother is ambitious and insists that Margery marry the wealthy Lord Alvanley. She considers Brummel not good enough for her daughter. To soothe his grief, Brummel plunges down the path of a self-destructive and hedonistic lifestyle, indulging in the finest food, drink, clothing, and women, but nothing can kill the sting of his losing Lady Margery. Alec B. Francis, as Brummel's gentleman's gentleman Mortimer, actually has a role equal in importance to Mary Astor's role, and he shines in it. Early in the film Mortimer corrects a visitor when he refers to Brummel as his master. Instead, Brummel is his life. He stays with Brummel when he can no longer pay him, and even after he is wrongfully discharged and he returns to England, he continues to send money for Brummel's upkeep. This is a long film for a silent at over two hours in length, but it doesn't drag at all.

This year is Warner Bros. 85th anniversary. Let's hope this film was restored with an eye to putting an official version on DVD. You'd think that since this is one of the few early silent films still in existence that was made by Warner Bros. that is not a Rin-Tin-Tin film, that this would be the plan.",1201651200,7,1983,4.630681818181818
2639458,2,B000HNNB0Q,"This version of ""Beau Brummel"" is not from Warner Home Video (WHV) -- and it shows! It's from some outfit called Televista, whom I have not heard of. The keepcase design on the back is poor, with type very hard to read (colored type on a black background -- bad type color!, and a poor choice of typeface.)

The print itself is lousy+. What is infuriating above all is that this silent film was projected through a sound aperature, which cuts off part of the top and lefthand sides of the frame (all of the inter-titles are off center, and the tops of most of the heads are partly cut off).

I feel I spent way too much for this version, and I hope that WHV will come out with their own version. I suspect, considering the quality of this film, that it is a 16mm copy of a much-used 35mm print. It is hard to watch, with such low quality, and certainly no care was taken to put it on this DVD. Do not waste your money on this one!",1193270400,15,930,4.132596685082873
2639459,3,B000HNNB0Q,"Beau Brummel is a dandified gentleman who enjoys the respect of the English royalty and the attention of the local ladies.  He pinches his snuff,and poses in his tights.  Things go rather well until a tussle with a girl causes him to insult the regal(and portly) Prince of Wales.  Now dear Beau becomes a cast-off, enjoyed only by his sweet Lady Alvaney.  The years pass, and Beau transforms into a doddering old man. How could he know that his beloved Lady still loves him?  A perfect suit for the elegant Shakespearean John Barrymore, 1924's ""Beau Brummel"" signaled the actor's first Warner Bros. effort. More would follow. Barrymore carried on an active affair with his co-star, Mary Astor(just 17), throughout the production. A marriage was fortold(It would not happen). ""Beau Brummel"" offers an unending array of ""left profile"" shots of the famous Barrymore; but his rich clothing and constricting pants would be a source of discomfort and embarassment in years to come. He would soon avoid the ""prissy"" roles of this early career.  Barrymore much enjoyed his ""transformation"" scene at the end( he always did), as he steps out of his ""ageing self""; observing what's left of his time-battered body; loved only by his faithful servant.  Televista provides a first DVD release of ""Beau Brummel(a spotty video tape has been available for a few years)"".  This disc continues the murky problems of the tape, and is clearly un-restored.  Historically Barrymore's first major Hollywood production, the film is sadly slow-moving, and almost without any drama.  The sentimental ending is surely enjoyable, but it cannot compete with the dreay soap-opera that comes before.",1191974400,8,1667,5.140740740740741
2639460,4,B000HNNB0Q,"Clyde Fitch's play, written for renowned stage actor Richard Mansfield, is a very romantic interpretation of incidents in the life of George (Beau) Brummel, the Regency dandy whose name has become a watchword for sartorial splendour and correctness, and is itself freely adapted for this film that showcases the unparallelled talent of John Barrymore in his prime as Brummel. With revenge in his heart, Brummel sets out to manipulate London society in a great game due to his, because of an untitled station, having lost his lover, played well by 18 year old Mary Astor with whom Barrymore began an affair during this filming, and he utilizes a close relationship with his sponsor, the Prince of Wales, the Regent (later King George IV), to advance his plan. Barrymore's control of his scenes is unmatched as he expresses the widest possible range of emotion and reaction with the smallest movement of eyes or mouth and, although there are opportunities aplenty for emoting, his utilization of a prolonged gaze into the eyes of a lover or foe speaks volumes. Barrymore is strongly assisted by a very able supporting cast, including Willard Louis as the Prince of Wales, Aleck B. Francis as Brummel's loyal manservant and, as the Duchess of York, the exquisite Irene Rich, whose rhythms and ability to focus upon her character's persona nicely complements Barrymore during their shared scenes. Harry Beaumont, as always, directs capably and is assisted enormously with his efforts by cinematographer David Abel, whose skill with large groups during complicated action was later markedly in evidence as he supervised the cameras during the best of the Astaire/Rogers films. Somewhat more than a cavil might be a desire for the scenario to have presented more of Brummel's full life rather than the lengthy treatment given to its denouement, and that lacking in accuracy, but certainly allowing Barrymore a good deal of dramatic opportunity that does not go shunned.",1160784000,,1963,5.1375
8140560,5,B000HNNB0Q,"This is definitely the best copy extant on  this Barrymore classic.  Throw out those old public domain copies and purchase this pristine masterpiece. The picture and sound have never been better especially the wonderful newly composed score by James Schafer which adds immeasurably to the enjoyment of this silent film classic. Barrymore contributes another memorable performance as the dashing but arrogant tragic hero Beau Brummel. His final scene as the senile Brummel entertaining the spirit of his lost love ( Mary Astor ) is heart wrenching.  Along with the great  Lon Chaney John Barrymore is one of the best silent screen actors of all time, only Conrad Veidt and Emil Jannings are their equals. The film encompasses the rise and fall of Brummel.  We first see him as a captain in the kings army wooing his one true love the Maid Margery before she is forced to marry an elder statesman.  Because of this action he vows to avenge himself on all of high society. He does this by first coming to the rescue of the Prince of Wales during an indiscretion with an innkeepers wife. For this he is awarded a house in London where he resigns from the army to become the prize dandy of all England.  He begins to set trends and styles, natural hair instead of powdered wigs is a revolt against  the powder tax, he also begins to have several illicit affairs with the wives of prominent men and begins accumulating debts which will eventually lead to his downfall. Barrymore is magnificent as the crafty Brummel who is cultivating a friendship with the lecherous Prince of Wales only to become a poor and penniless old dreg of society once he falls out of favor with the prince.  His downfall is truly heart breaking and tragic.  Mary Astor is beautiful and breathtaking as his true lady love. During the filming she and Barrymore were having an affair which adds a panache to their love scenes. Also worthy of mention is Willard Louis as George Prince of Wales soon to become King George of England. He is both funny and likable as the amorous obese prince.  The cast and costumes are all excellent in the Warner Bros. tradition with no expense spared. So do not miss out on this silent classic because it is a dandy.",1485907200,2,2216,4.67095115681234

8140562,4,B000HNNB0Q,"Note: as noted by many reviewers, the Warner Archives edition is far superior to the Televista DVD that still may be floating around. That goes for both the picture quality, and the music, which is rather random on the Televista as opposed to written for the piece and quite good on the Warners

It's interesting how much 'wit' can be found even in a film without spoken words. ""Beau Brummel"" is playful, a little naughty, and at times quite sad. The acting here is notably restrained and natural for a silent film. with John Barrymore leading the way in an excellent performance as Gordon Byron 'Beau' Brummel.

Brummel was a real person, even though the film acknowledges up front that his escapades have been largely fictionalized by legend. In this reality, Brummel was an 18th century army officer and dandy, who, despite his lack of wealth or noble blood, partied with the elite, romancing the women, befriending the men, and being a style and trend setter. What gives this a sense of drama to go with the playful social satire is the fact that Beau is denied the one woman he really loves, so his other successes are all a bit hollow. Also, in the end Brummel has little other than his smarts and charm to stand on, which keeps him always one insolent move from falling into poverty and disrepute.

There are weak spots. The photography and direction aren't particularly imaginative, with a very stagy feel to the blocking and camera angles. Most of the film is shot in head on, eye level medium 2-shots. The sets also often look a bit more like something designed for the stage than for the 360 degree vision of film. But if this isn't a great film, it's a good, clever, enjoyable one, and a chance to see Barrymore, said by many to be the finest actor of his time, as a comparatively young leading man.",1416441600,2,1811,4.583333333333333
8140563,5,B000HNNB0Q,"It saddens me that reviews of the apparently wretched Televista DVD release of this wonderful movie have dumped into this excellent Warner Archive made-on-demand DVD's Amazon advertisement page. Note that any and ALL owner reviews dated prior to the September 18, 2011 one (which is the ONLY review for the Warner release, prior to mine) do NOT apply to this Warner Archive release, therefore are ENTIRELY irrelevant and should be COMPLETELY ignored!

DO order, without ANY reservations about quality, a copy of the Warner Archive made-on-demand DVD. The transfer is gorgeous, and the new orchestral score is perfect and truly magical. The Warner Archive release is SUPERB! It's the beautiful copy that TCM airs. If you've seen this movie on TCM during the past few years, this is the DVD release that will precisely match what you saw and heard there.

I love this movie and this Warner Archive DVD release of it. It looks great, as mentioned the recent-years score that's been added is impeccably complimentary and magical, Barrymore, Astor, and the two lesser main female actresses (Carmel Myers and Irene Rich) are all stunning to look at, the story's never boring, is very entertaining, there's a lot of humour and wit (though this is as much a drama as it is amusing), and the 127 mins. playing duration moves briskly. Take note of that time as I've presented it accurately (127 mins.), whereas the Warner Archive site, and various other sites (including here, on the Amazon site), mistakenly list this movie as being only 80 mins. in length.

I think this would be an excellent choice of movie to show to uninitiated Silent movie viewers, who don't believe they'd be interested in Silents; I think they'd be inclined to ""take"" to this one. This movie is so visually rich, the leads are so attractive, and the story is so involving and entertaining, that I think even people who believe they only can enjoy modern fare would be interested. I have a substantial and wonderful Silent movies DVD collection, and this movie, in this precise release, is one of my very favourites in it. Buy this movie in this fine Warner Archive release and enjoy!

PS: I realize that this review I've written about the Warner release may - and probably will - synch automatically into the reviews for the Televista release, since both apply to the same 1924 movie. If so, realize that my review does NOT apply to the Televista release - SOLELY to the Warner!",1366675200,13,2444,4.825775656324582
8140564,4,B000HNNB0Q,"SYNOPSIS for BEAU BRUMMEL--
Ex-Capt. George Bryan Brummel (Barrymore) enjoys a high position among the elite of British society during the pre-Victorian Regency era, until an insult of the Prince of Wales becomes his downfall.

Based on Clyde Fitch's play, this Harry Beaumont-directed film details Beau's love of a blueblood named Margery (played by 18-year-old Astor), an affair abandoned due to his lack of proper lineage and Margery having to marry Lord Alvanley (Humphrey). In bitter revenge, the arrogant Beau mocks those he so wishes to be a part of by adopting a foppish social butterfly demeanor.

Through an opportunistic chance he becomes a trusted friend of Prince George (who'd ultimately be crowned king) and the two change men's fashion standards all over Europe. They abandon powdered wigs and popularize top hats, frock coats and ties. Beau has several romantic liasons and makes lots of enemies in the process.

When Lady Margery resurfaces, the rather obese prince becomes enamored of her, which doesn't sit well with his loquacious friend. Beau's rude comment, plus his courting of George's sister-in-law (Rich) leads to complete estrangement from the prince. To avoid creditors and an angry ex-lover (Myers) Beau travels to France, where he ends up a financially ruined and disgraced man who loses hold of his own sanity.

8140568,3,B000HNNB0Q,"""Death kills but once - life kills many times"" is an intertitle in this 1924 silent film which poignantly summarizes the tragic story of George Bryan Brummell, also known as `Beau Brummel', who lived in early 19th century England.  History remembers him as a colourful character of high society who set the trends in fashion and style, and whose wit and charm endeared him even to the Prince of Wales.  But fame and royal connections could not save Brummel from his decline into poverty and illness due to his extravagant lifestyle.  This film tells the story behind the historic facts, namely the one and only true love he could not marry, which became the fate that twisted his soul and was the underlying pain he carried throughout his life.  While the story is well told and interesting enough in itself, the two leading roles could hardly have been better cast, with John Barrymore playing Beau Brummel in a life story which mirrored and forecast his own fate.  Already a superstar in the 1920s, Barrymore also suffered a tragic decline due to alcoholism in the later years of his career, and perhaps he could relate to the real Beau Brummel and thus portray him so well.  His leading lady is the beautiful Mary Astor, whose career took off after starring opposite Barrymore in this film, helped along, apparently, by a torrid affair with Barrymore at this time.

This Televista DVD has a barely average picture quality such as general flickering and some blurriness, but without any serious flaws so that scenes and intertitles can still be appreciated.  The accompanying music is a medley of pre-recorded pieces from obscure classical and orchestral music to some more contemporary sounds, but in many cases the music is reasonably fitting to the scenes and atmosphere of the film.  No doubt admirers of the flamboyant Barrymore will be able to overlook the less than perfect quality, and the film itself is worth seeing, if only for its stars, Barrymore and Mary Astor.",1228953600,2,1977,4.8601190476190474
8140569,3,B000HNNB0Q,"I have watched John Barrymore in talkies (particularly 'Grand Hotel'), but this was my first opportunity, as a silent fan, to enjoy him in a silent film. For years, the only 'Beau Brummel' movie version I had known was the MGM spectacle with Stewart Granger, Peter Ustinov, and Elizabeth Taylor, which I saw as a child when it was on TV. The Barrymore version is nearly superior to the 1954 film, due to the performances of the Great Profile (and what a stunning profile, shown to such an advantage) and a luminescent, heartbreaking Mary Astor. The screenplay is good, and maintained my interest. It also went to the depth of Barrymore's abilities to watch him go from the handsome young Army officer, to his heyday as the 'Beau,' then poverty, and finally, so aged and broken that he appears older than his loyal manservant. (Several times, I thought of the older Barrymore as he appeared only 8 years later in 'A Bill of Divorcement.'). Considering the fact that he was in his Forties when this was made, I was amazed at how well he capably handled the transition in age. The costumes and sets are beautiful and appear stunning.

I say appear, because it is difficult to tell.

Regrettably, the transfer and the video's condition is disgusting to the point of being a crime. Frames go from light to dark; the ""dirt"" is obvious and headache-inducing; title cards are not only fuzzy, but the odd zoom to bring them into focus or to segue is disconcerting (I don't remember seeing it done so often in a silent, and am wondering if this is something that was actually part of the movie, or something done by the company releasing it). The soundtrack ranges from slightly ('slightly' being the key word) appropriate to more annoying tunes that sound as if they belong to the Twenties and not the time frame of the movie itself. (If I heard that one piano tinkling tune again, I was going to put my head through the drywall! And at one point, during a key scene between Brummel, Lady Margery and the Prince, a tonal type drone begins that seemed more appropriate to a modern science fiction movie. At least, I think it was some kind of music because initially, I thought it was a bad sound effect). Even the attractive photo gallery with selections from the film itself looks as though it was created by a beginner with a Power Point program!

It is my hope that some superior company will take this movie, do a complete restoration, then release it as it deserves to be. I am reading in other reviews, that there is a restored version, but it seems to have only been shown on cable at this point. I hope that someone will eventually 'take pity' on those wishing to own it, and will release a worthy copy. Until then, I recommend this only for curious silent fans. It will be taxing watching the poor transfer currently available, but almost worth it.",1206057600,5,2847,4.589390962671906
