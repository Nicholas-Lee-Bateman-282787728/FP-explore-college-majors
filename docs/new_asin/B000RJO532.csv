8201029,5,B000RJO532,"My grandson of 15 months loves this series from the early 2000.  The actors are upbeat and engaging with happy giggles dispersed throughout the wonderful lessons learned.  I don't know if he's learned any lessons at his age, but maybe subconciously it will sink in.  He will not ride in the car without screaming for the Berenstain Bears dvds.  I have the whole series with these same actors.  The older versions are more subdued and he doesn't stay with it as he does with this group of actors.  There is a catchy song and a happy upbeat nature to this group.  I've tried Elmo dvds, but he actually prefers the Berenstain bears.  It's strange, but he loves them!",1267056000,2,663,4.559322033898305

She talks about Mama, Papa, brother and sister as though they are her friends.  She has other Berenstain Bears DVDs and books and loves them all.  They are great.  Amazon has a good selection of these products.",1265760000,,357,4.515625
