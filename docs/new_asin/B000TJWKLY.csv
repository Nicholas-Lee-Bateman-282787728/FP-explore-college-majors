Take a color photograph of the Grand Canyon, copy it into 4 panels, rotate each panel around, and then merge them together into a single composite picture; the effect is stunning. Words just don't do this novel effect justice. And as an added bonus, a separate actual film is included of the desert southwest. I originally thought this other film would be not-so-great; an after-thought by the producers. Not so! First rate stuff! You figure...for 10 dollars, how good can this DVD be right? Darned good! This DVD is a steal. Top shelf stuff. Absolutely novel, well done, and worth owning. I did good with this one, gang!",1458086400,,783,4.807407407407408

These are places I've seen through all my growing up. They are there for me to spend a moment with again.
I can almost smell the greasewood and heat, the rain on dust Dust & the breese of Popping Trees and Snow.
Because of this film one can go home again.
