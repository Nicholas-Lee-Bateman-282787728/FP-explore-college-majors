8010968,1,B0001DMWOI,Just terrible and not worth the money.  The fights are horrible and the fighters have very little skill.  Puchase PRIDE instead where the best fighters in the WORLD come to fight.,1152576000,,179,4.741935483870968
8010969,1,B0001DMWOI,"UFC 45 is a remarkably bad event.  The only decent fight on the card is one that holds no bearing on nternational rankings and is between two guys who have never amounted to anything and never will(Lytle and Lawler)  OTher than that the rest of the show is terrible.  I mean sure, if you enjoy watching two overweight fat slobs throw punches at each other for a round than you might enjoy it, but if you are a true fan of MMA than this show is the pits.  You can tell that all these guys have very little skill compared to the guys in Pride and sometimes are akin to fat barroom brawlers.

Pride FC is the top organization in the world.  Sadly, the UFC is far behind.",1152403200,,667,4.171875
8010970,1,B0001DMWOI,"Ultimate Fighting Championship is a U.S.-based mixed martial arts (MMA) organization, currently recognized as the major MMA promotion in North America.

UFC 45 - Revolution is flat out, a terrible event. The card is  full of everything you don't want in a Mixed Martial Arts show.  Terrible fights, brawls that look more akin to bum fight, and idiotic officating decisions.  The fact that this event marked the UFC's 10th anniversary made the effort all that more pathetic.  The only remotely interesting fight on paper is the heavyweight showdown between Ricco Rodriguez and Pedro Rizzo.  The fight was relegated to prelim status and featured two old men circling around the octagon for 15 minutes.

UFC 45 will go down in the books as being one of the UFC's worst PPV events.  Stay away from this one at all costs.",1152403200,,816,4.86231884057971
8010971,5,B0001DMWOI,"This is a great night for the UFC.  The 10th anniversary of the first UFC event back in 1993, where Royce Gracie stood victorious among the contestants in the tournament.  Yes, back then fighters fought more than once a night...

On this occasion, the UFC honors its 10 most revered fighters in a ""Viewer's Choice"" segment.  The top 3, not surprisingly, are Royce Gracie, Ken Shamrock and Randy Couture.  You've got to love Couture.  Shamrock and Gracie also become the first two fighters inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame.

The preliminary bouts are not all that memorable.  Yves Edwards and Nick Agallar have a decent bout that ends unexpectedly in the 2nd round.  Ricco Rodriguez takes on UFC legend Pedro Rizzo in the last fight of both of their contracts.  Rodriguez is completely lackluster and fights a boring, heartless fight.

Chris Lytle then takes on rising star Robbie Lawler, who is back from a hip injury that sidelined him back in UFC 40.  This is an entertaining fight.  Lytle definitely has skills, but he lacked the power to trade with Lawler.  They go at it hard in a few truly exciting standing exchanges.

Powerhouse Phil Baroni then matches up with Evan Tanner. Tanner moves down to middleweight for this fight.  Baroni's punching power is apparent immediately, but if there is one thing that we all know about Evan Tanner, it's that his experience, composure and heart have served him well in the UFC in the past.  A controversial but interesting fight, as miscommunication leads to an unfortunate early stoppage.

Cabbage faces UFC legend Tank Abbott (honored earlier that same night) in the next bout of the night.  This is, as was expected, a slugfest until it is stopped due to a cut.  Decent fight, but mayhem ensues in the octagon after the fight, which somewhat sullies the anniversary celebration.

Lindland and Vitale rematch.  In the first fight, Lindland attempts a slam and ends up knocking himself out, as Vitale lands on his head.  Lindland is able to redeem himself this time with a legitimate win, somewhat erasing the freak loss he suffered in their first meeting.

In the main event, Matt Hughes takes on highly-decorated newcomer Frank Trigg.  Hughes displays his wrestling ability against Trigg, who proves to be a worthy opponent for the champion.  Hughes is not known for his submissions, but he demonstrates one not previously seen in UFC competition in this fight.

A great night of fights at a great UFC event.  As usual, there is plenty of entertaining behind-the-scenes bonus material to satisfy fans of the UFC.  Highly recommended.",1143504000,,2584,4.889400921658986
8010972,4,B0001DMWOI,"You people are on crack. This was a great event. It had it all... KO's, controversy, blood. A must own. By the way, the Tank/Cabbage fight was kick ass. To say that one fighter wimped out and 'let the fight be stopped' is simply ignorant. The doctors stopped the fight because of a brutal cut above the eye. The fighter has no say in such a thing I am sorry to say. Buy this DVD, it rocks.",1136332800,,389,4.064935064935065
8010973,3,B0001DMWOI,"After the 2 pevious UFC events, which were great, this one (UFC 45: Revolutions) is a let down. The only fights that I enjoyed were the Huges-Trigg match (the closest to a pure freestyle wrestling match that I have seen in MMA, both fighters very well matched) and the Lindland-Vitale rematch. Some people find Lindland boring because he cannot finish, but in fact he is extremely active in his fights, setting up a work rate that exhausts his opponents. The Baroni-Tanner match had a horrible ending - I hate when a bad referee messes up a match. Cabbage-Tank was entertaining but short - one of the fighters wimped out and let the fight be stopped. Lawler-Lytle had a controversial decison ( I would have given it to the other guy), also Lawler refused to engage for most of the fight, retreating to lure Lytle into attack mode and make it a slugging contest, something Lawler was more likely to win. This made the fight pretty frustrating. The Edwards fight ends in a knockout, but before that it is 1 1/2 rounds of stalking, with little engagement by either fighter.
Overall, a weak event. Get it if you are a completist and must own every UFC event, or for the Huges-Trigg fight.",1085011200,,1184,4.61611374407583
