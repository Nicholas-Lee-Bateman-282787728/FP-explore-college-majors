8274115,5,B0013672X8,"This is not an easy subject to tackle on film.  The directors captured the depth of the emotions surrounding the trauma without letting it overshadow the hope the story meant to convey.  When you watch the DVD, you're not just a bystander along for the ride.  It puts you square into the film, as an active participant on the ground who commensurates with the successful recovery of some of the victims, and sympathize with the other victims whom have a longer path to recovery.  Watch this DVD to get a full dose of the hope that can exist after the brutality of war, and feel yourself wanting to do something to expand that hope.",1201392000,5,631,4.508771929824562
