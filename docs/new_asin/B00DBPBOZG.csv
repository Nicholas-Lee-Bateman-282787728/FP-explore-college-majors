5787477,3,B00DBPBOZG,"No boobs, no sex, beautiful scenery . . . Just a simple ghost story.  A bit slow but not unbearably so, some chills, a little gore; really just a nice, simple ghost story simply told.  Not the greatest or the scariest but not the type of movie that makes you, ""I can't believe I wasted time and money on that!""",1372723200,4,310,4.15
5787478,4,B00DBPBOZG,There's nothing fancy about this movie. Just good old fashioned story telling. The Director had a unique way of filming that was very effective. I love horror movies where the creature doesn't fool around and there's nothing anyone can do about it. I thought I had the story figured out early but I was wrong and I'm not easily fooled. It had the atmosphere of a excellent stage play and its a story you'll not soon forget.,1372723200,16,423,4.5064935064935066
5787479,1,B00DBPBOZG,"The movie was underwhelming. The plot was not clear, so it went nowhere until the ""twist"" occurred at the end. Soundtrack for this film was overemphasized on the worst scenes.

5787481,5,B00DBPBOZG,"I was really surprised at how good this movie actually turned out to be,not to mention how creepy. I have seen a few tooth fairy horror flick but this one is by far the best. It has a really cool nice little unexpected twist at then end... I recommend it for a late night date night,,,
I would say more but i don't want to ruin the movie for u guys as some  people seem to have the urge to do..lol

5787497,3,B00DBPBOZG,"The Haunting of Helena (Christian Bisceglia and Ascanio Maglarini, 2012)

There are some truly arresting scenes in The Haunting of Helena, the kind of risky stylistic choices that, done correctly, can go a long way towards making or breaking a movie. For example, the scene where Helena (Sabrina Jolie Perez in her only screen role to date) is sitting at one of those brightly-colored little-kid desks. There's nothing much else in the room, which is odd and does not ring true and contributes about a mountain's worth of atmosphere. Then something falls and clatters off the desk, and this begins a rain of bloody teeth as Helena scrambles under the desk. It's a pretty amazing visual, and little scenes like that, were they correctly integrated with the rest of the movie, would have made this an overlooked little gem. As it is, however, they make it an interesting, if ultimately failed, experiment that still manages to be worth watching for little things like that that crop up once in a while.

Plot: Helena and her mother, Sofia (Smile's Harriet MacMasters-Green), move into a lovely old home. Dad (The Passion of the Christ's Jarreth J. Merz) is out of the picture, so the two of them are on their own. Everything goes swimmingly until Helena loses her first tooth. (Soon after, Sofia has a rather terrifying vision that you would think would make her put more stock in what her daughter is saying, but no luck.) She starts talking about a tooth fairy who comes to visit her demanding teeth, to the point where she starts buying teeth from kids at school...and paying them in rare coins that seem to have been mysteriously conjured out of nowhere. Sofia, determined to find a rational explanation for all of this, draws in an ever-widening circle of doctors, psychologists, and even her ex, while Helena continues to insist that there is indeed a supernatural explanation.

The movie's main drawback, which more than counteracts the main strength above, is that you have seen it before (even the Tooth Fairy angle has been covered by at least two movies I can think of off the top of my head in the past decade). Bisceglia and Maglarini did nothing new with the story; it struck me that they were relying on a series of arresting images to carry the film, rather than attempting to push any envelopes. To their credit, said images can be very arresting, and the film is beautifully-shot. If that's enough for you, it's worth checking out, but it probably shouldn't be at the top of your list. ** ",1402531200,2,2505,4.751724137931035
5787498,3,B00DBPBOZG,"I'm a horror buff and my honest opinion this doesn't make that horror,grade . Maybe it's more of a suspense or thriller but  either way it didn't for me",1396224000,2,152,4.241379310344827
5787499,4,B00DBPBOZG,"It was a good movie, it even creeped me out a few times which can take a bit since my daughter and I are avid scary movie watchers.",1395273600,,131,3.7142857142857144
5787500,3,B00DBPBOZG,"This is one of those movies that 20 minutes into it you're thinking renting it was a mistake. If your patient and willing to settle for the ""less than desirable"" video quality, it's a good story and has a somewhat haunting ending. Well worth the price of a rental. If re-done with a big hollywood budget and a mid-level cast that stayed true to the original story even better.",1394668800,2,376,4.463768115942029
5787501,4,B00DBPBOZG,"This movie was good, but the key word here is creepy.  Good old-fashioned creepy storytelling done well with an excellent creepy atmosphere.

Written and produced by rookie filmmakers, the long-short of it all is this:  In this twisted take on the ""tooth fairy"" fairy tale, an Italian Malaria ghost wants her teeth back and she'll kill as many innocent people as it takes until one of them happens to randomly figure out why she's killing, what she wants and where to find it.

The story begins when young Helena notices her first loose tooth and inquires about the tooth fairy.  Her mother Sophia, like any loving parent, humors her with an all too familiar story.  But for the ""horror"" in this story to take root something must go wrong for Helena and her single mother.

This evil enters their lives after they get a cursed wardrobe with claw marks on the inside.  Maybe it's just me and I'm just paranoid or superstitious, but upon seeing claw marks on the inside of a lockable ""anything"" I'd think twice about it.  Like an imprisoning lamp to its genie, this wardrobe had--until now--kept an evil restless spirit at bay.

Following familiar formula, the young child in our story begins to act strangely.  Helena buys teeth from her elementary school classmates in the schoolyard with curiously old coins which she couldn't possibly have stumbled across on her own.  She also begins producing disturbing drawings.

From there some very creepy things happen, Helena begins talking to an ""imaginary"" friend, and there are some good scares along the way.  Many scenes were VERY chilling.

There's a twist at the end.  It was unnecessary; the movie was fine without it.  But I had fun with it anyway and it added another dimension to the solid storytelling.

This is no must-see sensation, but it was done very well and it would be a worthy contribution to a dark and stormy night (alone or with a date, etc.).  The ghost is presented with fine effects; our evil tooth fairy is creepy, disturbing and nuanced.",1393113600,2,2009,4.771014492753623
5787512,3,B00DBPBOZG,"This had much going for it, it could have been better edited, tightened up here and there but for the most part I liked the slow dream quality of story, they didn't go for the throat but slowly told the story, I liked the ending, worth watching if you like a haunted story line with a European backdrop instead of something thrown together in the States. It has some good direction, the acting was so so but it did have an unusual story to tell.",1393027200,,445,4.247058823529412
5787513,2,B00DBPBOZG,"Well, the horror visual effects were very well done, so I'm sorry the acting and the pacing dragged it down. If the movie was a montage of that and cut out the ""acting"", I'd like it much better. Ugh! The mother needs acting lessons. She overacted and came off like a histrionic sometimes and yet wooden at others. How does that happen? The kid was one note all the way. The pacing was poor- the story moved like it had lead boots on. Few horror movies have conveyed such a lack of urgency. Ultimately, it bored me. The Tooth Fairy here has no teeth.",1392422400,7,549,4.288461538461538

5787517,3,B00DBPBOZG,"A decent paranormal movie that could have stood to have about 30 minutes cut from the running time.  There were quite a few portions that felt very repetitive and unnecessary to the story.  It felt like they were stretching to fit a running time.  The overall story is good, the mood is well established and it was overall an enjoyable movie.",1385078400,,342,4.573770491803279
5787518,5,B00DBPBOZG,"I wasn't sure how this would turn out, but I really liked it. The plot was unique and freaky. The casting director didn't seem to notice that the little girl looked nothing like either of her ""parents"" though, so, that made things a little less believable. It was also nice to see a movie come out that wasn't concerned about a happy ending.",1384473600,,341,4.428571428571429

5787520,3,B00DBPBOZG,"I don't know if it was the storytelling or the editing, but the scenes seemed choppy and like something was cut out of the film, leaving some breaks in continuity.  Creepy enough, but a bit hard to follow since it doesn't seem to follow a continuous timeline (not that it jumps around, but that it jumps from one scene to another without a particular reason for the connection of scenes).  Worth watching on Instant Video, but glad I didn't buy it because it's not the kind of film that I'd watch over and over.",1383091200,,511,4.425531914893617
5787521,1,B00DBPBOZG,This had a lot of potential but in no way met it. Weak scares and terrible acting make a forced story become even more jumbled.,1380758400,,127,4.12
5787532,1,B00DBPBOZG,"I don't understand why people are giving this movie good reviews. This was an absolutely horrible movie. Bad acting, bad effects, and boring story that just dragged! I love watching low budget horror films and finding gems that not many people know about, but this is not one of them! The case drew me in to buy it, so that is basically the only good thing about the movie, the case. I have never written a bad review on any movie, but I hated this movie so much and it was such a disappointment that I had to warn everybody. So please don't waste your time and money on this one.",1380326400,2,580,4.2342342342342345
5787533,4,B00DBPBOZG,"I love horror movies that take a traditional aspect of our lives and turn it into something terrifying.  I particularly enjoy those flicks that can take an innocent childhood tale or myth and distort it into a horrific joyride of fun.  And that is exactly what THE HAUNTING OF HELENA does; it turns a light and airy ritual of youth into a dark foray into horror.

The Tooth Fairy has always frightened me, but I'm not sure why.  It might be because she can slip into your house undetected, much like Santa Clause, but she comes to take things instead of leave them.  Or it could simply be her obsession with teeth and her willingness to pay in order to get them.  If such a being existed, how far might she go to get what she wanted?

THE HAUNTING OF HELENA is not a traditional Tooth Fairy story, but it sure packs one hell of a punch.  It is shot very well, and I have to confess that some of the cinematography is what makes the film so creepy.  The opening scene is particularly well done, and I was shocked to learn in the Behind the Scenes featurette that much of it was done with computer animation.  The CG images are seamless and create an amazing opening sequence that sets the tone for the whole film.

The acting is pretty good overall, although I am almost ashamed to admit that I don't care much for performance given by the actress who portrayed young Helena, Sabrina Jolie Perez.  For me, she lacks the emotional range and depth needed for a role like this one.  Instead of sadness or joy, all I see in her facial expressions is a bland gaze that reads like depression.  This does not detract from the movie, as her portrayal of Helena is simply downright eerie, but I do feel it is worth mentioning.  Hopefully, her future roles will come out differently.

But what really wins this film for me is the writing and the story itself.  There is a huge revelation towards the end that I never saw coming, which almost made the movie for me in itself.  The plot moves at a nice pace and I never once felt like it was going stale.  There are also several chilling scenes that literally made my flesh crawl.  You just can't ask for much more in a horror film.

THE HAUNTING OF HELENA is a top notch film that deserves your attention.  The film is available now in a variety of formats, so give it a look.",1379980800,2,2314,4.332558139534884
5787534,4,B00DBPBOZG,"Sophia (Harriet MacMasters-Green) separates from her husband (?) and lives with her daughter Helena (Sabrina Jolie Perez) in Italy, in a town with a strange history. They find an old wardrobe in the basement and move it into Helena's room. Sure enough the wardrobe is occupied by the tooth fairy who is obsessed about teeth as is now Helena. I am just glad my parents kept all my baby teeth for me in a jar.

Once mom figures things out, moving the wardrobe back into the basement doesn't seem to be an option as the piece is functional and makes the room. So she moves a piano in front of it. The haunting escalates. Mom attempts to unravel the history.

The film was done fairly well. I enjoyed the twist at the last ten minutes which should have come about half way through the film. I didn't find the film overly scary even if it displays some originality.

Makes for a good rental. I can't see owning it. Might be one for the eight year old kids on a sleep over.

5787537,3,B00DBPBOZG,"The plot here is rather like the terrible tooth fairy beast merges with a battered wife. Though there are a few ""ewwww yuck"" moments (how do you feel about bloody teeth raining down upon your head while you're a patient IN a hospital), the film in its entirety was a little better than just OK.  It seemed almost like a couple different story lines showing at the same time.

5787539,4,B00DBPBOZG,"This movie was good and projected a lot of atmosphere.  There was a constant undercurrent of horror just beneath the surface; that put me on edge with a feeling of dread and apprehension.  It just didn't concern ghostly horror, it also depicted the psychological horror of people at their worse.  It was not a slash and gash with a little soft porno added.  This was a low key supernatural thriller with very good acting.  The plot had twists and turns and all in all it was a pretty unnerving flick.  Of course, this is just my opinion.
