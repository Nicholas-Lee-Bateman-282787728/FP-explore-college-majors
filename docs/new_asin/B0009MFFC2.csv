8063136,1,B0009MFFC2,"I would have liked to hear the lapping of the ocean waves and the soft rustle of the reeds waving in the wind with soft music in the beckground.  Instead, I strain to hear the relaxing sounds of nature when all I can hear is music.

Nice photography.",1157500800,8,250,4.1875
8063137,5,B0009MFFC2,"When I viewed At Water's Edge, my expectation was that I would feel relaxed.  But there was something about the combination of the vivid imagery of nature with its healing waters and the soothing music that felt transformational.  Literally, I was sitting there and felt something unexplainable shift inside.  The DVD goes beyond relaxation. You just really have to experience it for yourself to get the full benefit.",1120694400,8,417,5.102941176470588
8063138,5,B0009MFFC2,"I believe this DVD is a great relaxation tool for someone like me who finds it hard to relax to only music.  The visual nature scenes allows my mind to stay focused rather than wandering towards stressful thoughts and emotions.  My favorite part is the autumn leaves reflections on the mountain pond.  I find the music beautiful and I even use it to help me to sleep at night.
