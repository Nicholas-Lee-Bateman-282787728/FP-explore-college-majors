4987956,5,B006GX6BGC,she was the touch that lit the way for all women  -  yo ucould see on her show how different this time was how women were perceived as only baby and home makers -  there were times when you could see joan trying to make jokes of the things her male guest would talk  to her  - but looking at it now in this day and age  -  you could see how insulting it was  -  she handled herself great  - she had balls to do what she did back then  - i loved watching  all three of these series  - really showed me how amazing she was from the very beggining,1412208000,,544,3.75
4987957,5,B006GX6BGC,"In this final installment of ""That Show with Joan Rivers"" guests include Nancy Walker, David Suskind and Dr. Joyce Brothers.

 Six episodes are included in this set from Joan's very first television talk show that aired for only one season from 1968-1969. The series aired on most owned NBC stations and was syndicated to others. However, after a year Joan was exhausted from doing this and her comedy concerts and was fed up with the poor ratings the show received later in its run. This was due to many stations moving ""That Show"" up against big network fare in the afternoon like soap operas and game shows. Some stations even aired it on prime time against the likes of ""The Carol Burnett Show"" so the chances of ""That Show"" surviving became very small.

 There are three volumes of ""That Show with Joan Rivers"" available for purchase and they also come in one complete set containing all 18 episodes.

 Watch a legend in the making. ""That Show"" is simply a marvelous way to spend an afternoon with an old friend who became not only the greatest funny lady in the business, but a superstar in her own right.",1328227200,5,1111,4.614213197969543

8497919,5,B006GX6BGC,"This is hilarious! Joan is so funny. The topics are often not PC by today's standards. It is refreshing to hear people talk candidly about issues that we currently don't consider PC like spanking children, the woman's role in the home... I also enjoy googleing the guest stars and reading about their claims to fame from many decades ago. So fun and different.",1444176000,,360,4.73015873015873
