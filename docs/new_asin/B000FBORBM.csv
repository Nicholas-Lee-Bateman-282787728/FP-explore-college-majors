8120455,1,B000FBORBM,My all time favorite series. IT WAS ON desilu and should be produced with excellent quality. Ordered the second volume and they sent another of volume one. What a mess. Obviously taped off late nite tv the quality varies from near wash out to barely audible...and I didn't get my favorite episode. These will have to do for now.,1377820800,,328,4.576271186440678
8120456,1,B000FBORBM,Dvds have been recorded from television - audio ads for chanel 50 run over credits. Tracking adjustments clearly visible on image. Image extremely grainy and poor. Doesn't play well at all. Freezes up in several places. Might have been tolerable at bargain basement price but price charged was outrageous for such low quality. Think twice before you buy. I should have read the reviews. Can not recommend this product.,1173830400,22,418,5.072463768115942
8120457,1,B000FBORBM,"taken from tv and was never edited, you see tracking being done, the channel it was being taped from-etc.  quality is so poor that if you watch it, you'll never watch it again",1170201600,42,175,4.303030303030303
8120458,3,B000FBORBM,"I wish I would have read the reviews first!  I was so excited to see that ""Our Miss Brooks"" was available for purchase, that I did not look to see the reviews.  The quality of the recordings are far worse than I ever imagined!  It is extremely grainy, flickers and is annoying to watch.  For all of you lucky people who read the reviews first, just know that you will be purchasing one of the worst quality recordings ever. Buyer BEWARE!!!  This says I give it 3 stars, but that is 3 stars too many!",1165449600,41,499,4.2105263157894735
8120459,1,B000FBORBM,"I thought I would be getting quality programming coming from Amazon. However in this case I received a very very poor quality video.  These shows were taped off a television program similar to nick-at-night. It was channel 50....wherever that is.  Unfortunately, you see parts of commercials, station identifications, poor quality jumping from one scene to another.  There are parts of shows that start and than just stop and don't end.  The picture quality was very poor at times.  You see that someone was using the tracking button but to no avail.  I would not recommend you buy this videos from Amazon's private dealers.",1155945600,65,624,5.009708737864078
