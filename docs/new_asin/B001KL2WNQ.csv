8315230,2,B001KL2WNQ,"John (Joe Ryan) was fallen off the deep end after the death of his father. He takes off work and returns to the picturesque family farm with his wife Diane (Vanessa Daniels). Here she meets John's childhood friend Mindy (Monica Knight). They have a serious psychotic love-hate relationship. John's family suffers from dementia and have suicidal tendencies. There is clearly a family secret which we try to piece together from the clues before they tell us.

To anyone who watches these type of mysteries have most of it figured out from the first clue. The plot wasn't that bad, but the acting, dialogue, and general film editing/direction left much to be desired. The characters never grabbed me. I never felt for poor Diane and found myself more concerned about the poorly shot wildlife meandering in the woods, moving in various directions when they are suppose to be giving chase.

Guide: F-bomb and sex. No nudity.",1415318400,,919,4.922580645161291
8315231,5,B001KL2WNQ,Joe Ryan pulls off a great zombie-possessed character.  The lack of nudity makes it OK to view with the family.,1394236800,,111,4.55
8315232,5,B001KL2WNQ,Really liked this. Beautiful scenery - Not the best movie I have seen - but interesting and glad I watched it.,1325030400,,110,4.285714285714286
8315233,5,B001KL2WNQ,"Character develop is the key to success in suspense thrillers such as ""Windcroft"".  Set in the beautiful and lush countryside, this riveting chiller develops slowly...but picks up the pace...just as your heart will as you enter the final 30 minutes.  While some reviewers have a problem with a ""slow start""...I don't.  We need to warm up to the husband and wife duo as they venture out for a much-needed getaway.  But when the truth comes out, all &^%$ breaks loose.  This is a classic thriller...in the Hitchcock vein.  I gave it 5 stars.  But before I rated this gem, I noticed on the back of the box that it had won six awards...BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY, BEST ACTRESS (Monica Wright), BEST DIRECTOR (Evan Mezaros), BEST PICTURE, and two additional awards for Monica and Evan.  Right on!  This is a must see for thriller freaks.  Enjoy the slow start and fasten your seat belts for the gripping conclusion.  BRAVO!",1251849600,5,911,4.7756410256410255
8315234,5,B001KL2WNQ,"This is a fantastic gem of a film. The pacing is amazing. It pulls you in and captures you along with your imagination. It is scary, romantic and intelligent. I would recommend this to anyone. Loved it. Well worth the purchase for repeated viewings!",1235433600,3,249,4.681818181818182
8315235,2,B001KL2WNQ,"I went out on a limb as Vanguard was releasing another unknown with a cast and crew no one has seen before. To the credit of the makers, this was the best filmed (camera work) of any title that VG has released - ever. But then they had to throw in a story that muddled a valiant freshman attempt at making some kind of slow-burn suspense shocker.

The story tells of a married NYC couple adjourning to an isolated family farm, only to fall victim to an emotionally snapped husband.  In watching the DVD docu, the skipper talks of wanting to record the inner beauty of the landscape, great lighting, unique cinematography, and keeping the detail on the hidef film. I am glad they used better film, because the over 40 minutes of outdoor and indoor pans (with no people) make for a great Country magazine spread, but then those damn characters started talking again to ruin the montage.

Now about that coyote ending; since I have to live with coyotes every day on our property, I was fascinated to see this part was even written. I know it wasn't meant to be a comedy but I was laughing uncontrollably.  But hey, they threw together a short shoot, with tons of variables on an awesome farm so kudos to them. That ambiguous ending sucked; the cast said it best by saying this film has no genre - and has a pace of a slug.

I would recommend it as one of those slow night rentals where you won't get scared, might get bored, will enjoy the scenery and when finished probably won't recommend it unless you knew someone in it. And whoever is responsible for that DVD extra of Whitty Whiskers needs to be fired.",1235260800,6,1605,4.4271186440677965
8315236,5,B001KL2WNQ,"This is an old-school thriller at heart. Deliberate pacing, proper character development and a solid, straight-forward plot that I could really sink my teeth into. At times I felt like I was watching an old noir thriller, but with very modern themes.

Very modern, in fact. This film turned into a horror film in the last act, which was great. I never saw the turns coming in this one and I'm grateful for the surprises. All the actors brought the movie home for me and I believed it from the first scene.",1233619200,,505,4.489130434782608
