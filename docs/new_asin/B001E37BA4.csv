8296198,3,B001E37BA4,"Gomez is in my absolutely FAVORITE workout video (with Janis Saffell) so I assumed this one would be as good. It's really just okay - I was disappointed.

It isn't high-impact enough, and he keeps adding all the drills together, which gets REALLY boring by the end of the video.",1263513600,,350,4.661290322580645
