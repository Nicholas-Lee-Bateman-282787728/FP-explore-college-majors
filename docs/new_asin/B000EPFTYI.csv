8112508,4,B000EPFTYI,"This is a very unique and very informative DVD series...In all other respects its pretty crappy.

These are 1980? British fishing shows that were probably low budget even back then. It has no entertainment value unless you get off on really crappy TV shows.

BUT I gave this four stars because it is one of kinda here in the United States. British fishing is very different. They use equipment and techniques we don't and they go after fish you'll never see in any other American DVD. The British know how to catch fish in high pressure areas like no one else's business.

They have several episodes on Long and Short pole fishing. An extreme version of fly fishing the British like to use. It involves 30' lightweight poles without reels with size 24 hook and 1-2 pound line and they catch a 100 pound of fish in one sitting, Its amazing. They use advanced chumming techniques to draw fish into range and to keep them feeding despite actively catching the school down to the last fish. If you fish high pressure areas YOU can learn allot from these techniques even without the exact same equipment.

There is also a great series on long distance fishing for carp and pike. They demonstrate some great casting techniques that I now use surf fishing and cat-fishing to reach areas 100-150 yards away.

Unlike more interesting shows this is more like an instructional video so while its a bit boring it really explains everything thoroughly and when your done with the video you can actually go out and use the techniques.

The show also demonstrates some equipment that you can buy online from Europe and Britain but will never see otherwise here in the USA. This includes remote controlled bait boats, chum rockets, and impact shields(I uses these exclusively now and they are incredible.)

I could have made a better DVD in my back yard BUT As an experienced fisherman I really found this informative and it is absolutely unique in that I don't think you can find the information in this set anywhere else in the United States.",1222905600,2,2028,4.695774647887324
