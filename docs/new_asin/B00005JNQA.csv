1524093,3,B00005JNQA,"""The Interpreter"" is a fundamentally sound suspense thriller made unconscionably tedious by the imposition of a romantic subplot.  It looks great, sounds great, and when it sticks to the smart-thriller game plan it really works.  Scott Frank's wonderfully old-fashioned sensibilities and Steve Zaillian's epic tone are both evident in the screenplay which does a fine job of making global-historical issues tangible and compelling.  In the best sequences - the opening, the bus, and the high-stakes finale - Pollack's direction is typically strong and assured.  But when the Broome/Keller (Kidman/Penn) relationship strays unnecessarily from stressed-out, suspicious professionals to would-be lovers, you're inevitably reminded you're watching a movie which probably owes too much to nervous executives and low-scoring all-female test screenings.  The apparent willingness of Keller to contemplate bedding Broome when his own dead wife is barely cold is a character curve ball that adds nothing to the story but distaste.  Had the chemistry been left to the performances rather than corny, hamfisted dialogue or, better yet, had the relationship been restricted to the more interesting ground it ultimately regains - two inconsolable people helping each other through grief - then this would have been one of the 5-star movies of the year.  As it stands, ""The Interpreter"" ends up being one of those most frustrating cinematic experiences - a very good film that is nonetheless strangely disappointing.",1114128000,6,1502,5.619469026548672
1524094,5,B00005JNQA,"I'm an interpreter with 9 languages under my belt, and I think Nicole KIDMAN is an incredible actress, not to mention the fact that she is absolutely to die for BEAUTIFUL.

1524188,5,B00005JNQA,"This movie is a great thriller about trying to find human rights in battered South Africa.  Both stars, Niicole Kidman, an Afrikaner who is an interpreter at the UN, and Sean Penn, who is a Secret Service agent charged with protecting her, are both wounded characters.  In finding justice re the corrupt ruler of South Africa, they also manage to heal each other.  A great film I highly recommend.",1498089600,3,397,4.72463768115942
1524189,5,B00005JNQA,One of my favorites.,1492214400,,20,4.25
1524190,4,B00005JNQA,"Everybody with the slightest familiarity with Africa under colonial rule, European colonial rule, knows that those powers carved up the continent to their liking, their pleasure and just as in the Middle East after World War I did not consider ethnic, tribal or any other rational arrangement when their had their wanting habits on. And basically as each colonial territory gained its freedom by hook or by crook those arbitrary lines of division were left in place. Left in place for whatever the liberation fighters could put together stable or not. That is the background for the film under review, The Interpreter, with the odd proviso that the film looked at how that carving up affected the whites, or a couple of the whites, who fought in the struggle for liberation. Or thought that was what they were doing.

How do you get to the interpreter part, the title of the picture part? Easy. That is where Silvia, played by Nicole Kidman, a white ex-liberation fighter in a fictitious African country who eventually ahd a change of heart and laid down her weapon, comes in (she and her brother had joined the resistance, the new post-colonial resistance, after the President of the country had mined the rural areas and their parents and sister were blown away from one such land mine). Silvia was now an interpreter at the United Nations. Unfortunately one night in the building after an evacuation she overheard a conversation in Ku, a dialect she knew from her country so there was no mistaking that what the conversation was about was a plot to kill the President of her country of origin. The guy whose landmines had killed her family.

This where colonialism effects and where yesterdays freedom fighters get wrapped in tyranny and corruption. That President once the hope of the nation upon liberation has turned into another garden-variety dictator who has moreover been accused of ethnic cleansing atrocities as part of his keeping power. The International Criminal Court (which by the way in the real world the United States does not recognize, did not sign the accords establishing that body and don't expect it to do so anytime soon) wanted to put him on trial. He was going to the United Nations to speak before the General Assembly to lay out his case, to conjure up some excuse to get off the hook.

That is where things get tricky, where what Silvia had overheard and reported to her superiors, gets involved in international diplomacy (and intrigue). The U.S. Secret Service which has a unit charged with protecting foreign dignitaries is put on the spot. Or rather crack agent Tobin, played by Sean Penn is put on the spot.  He didn't believe what Silvia overheard, or maybe better as he delves into her background what her agenda was in the whole matter. They go back and forth and Tobin eventually saw that what she overheard was the real thing, or what they thought was the real deal. As it turned out this nasty President and his henchmen had killed off the opposition (including Silvias brother who stayed in the armed struggle against the President) and had cooked up the whole assassination scheme to cover their tracks, to gain sympathy against those ICC indictments. Silvia, beside herself once she had found out that her brother had been murdered along with her lover by the Presidents henchmen, was able to get into the safe room where the President after the bogus assassination attempt was being held in order to get her revenge. Tobin talked her out of that rash action. The President would thereafter goes before the ICC and Silvia was expelled from the United States.

In the end no romance between the magnetic pair of Kidman and Penn but a better than average thriller centered on the problems, the serious problems, with neo-colonial Africa.",1491350400,,3781,4.837712519319938

I don't believe there has ever been a horrible, yawn-inducing movie in the entire history of Hollywood and film. Do not waste your time watching this movie. You don't agree? Read most of the other reviews and you'll agree with me. Too bad a beautiful woman (i.e. Nicole Kidman) was in such an awful movie like this.

1524413,5,B00005JNQA,"I enjoyed ""The Interpreter"" on first viewing when I checked it out of the library (I never saw it on its theatrical release). I thought it was a taut, suspenseful, well-crafted thriller, with interesting characters, believable (mostly) dialogue and outstanding locations (it was the first commercial movie ever filmed on location inside the United Nations building in New York City).

The plot moves fast in most places, with just a few draggy bits. The story swept me up and kept my interest to the last frame. I always enjoy tales about the ""everyman"" (or -woman) caught up in confusing webs of treachery, murder and deceit, and ""The Interpreter"" fills the bill nicely. After I watched it, I was satisfied that I understood all the plot twists and turns.

But I was wrong.

Watching it again with director Sydney Pollack's commentary revealed whole new layers of detail, intricacy and plot foreshadowing that I had missed. I liked ""The Interpreter"" the first time I watched it; I loved it the second. Although Mr. Pollack doesn't talk as much as I'd like him to--there are long stretches of silence on the commentary track--he says enough to put things into perspective. He reveals why he made certain directorial and editorial choices, which I find fascinating, and also discusses the plot in detail, which is where I gained additional important insights. I came away even more impressed with his cinematic accomplishment.

""The Interpreter"" is a fine film, well made and exciting. Fans of the genre should enjoy it a lot.",1425686400,,1525,4.968627450980392

The interpreter has tragic moments where people have lost loved ones for different reasons and yet the pain is the same.  One learns that in different societies that death is perceived differently and I found it to be very enlightening and one can free ones sorrows in a different light than we do here in the USA.

1524581,4,B00005JNQA,"Filmakers today should take some of the principles employed in developing  the plot in this movie ""The Interpreter,"" and apply them to movies that come out these days.  Obviously the director was influenced by some of the great masters of suspense like Alfred Hitchcock or Terence Young (""Wait Until Dark"") to name just a couple.  And in turn the director of this film himself takes his place alongside these luminaries.

Having a great cast, solid plot development, suspense, and great character development made this film a very satisfying viewing experience.  Also the film lets the viewer have a peak at the social and economic conditions in another part of the world that they may not be living in.  This is a great element to include in a film from a ""Human Interest"" perspective and increases the film's overall impact.  Again, great cast.  Ms. Kidman, and Mr. Penn did a great job.  I especially like Ms. Kidman's performance of an Africaaner accent.  It sounded perfectly normal and not at all as if she were ""doing an accent"" and not quite nailing it.  Which is something else missing in alot of today's movies.  Some actors although good actors just don't have the getting a particular accent down thing together.

1524629,5,B00005JNQA,"This is a dynamic movie - I don't care what anyone else says.

The byplay between Broome and Keller (Kidman and Penn) is fraught with emotion.  He is recovering from the very recent loss of his wife in a car crash, but 'needs' to continue working.  I can understand that need...
She cannot get in touch with her brother in Africa, but ""knows"" something bad has happened.

She comes to be an interpreter at the UN because she believes that there is a better way than guns to solve problems.  I find this [personally] hard to imagine - her strength in this belief, because both her parents and younger sister were killed in their car, driving over a landmine.  I am not certain what my reaction would be.  I really am not.

I do not consider myself a ""good reviewer"" of films, because my emotions get involved.  I become part of a story, and I do the same with a good book.

1524738,4,B00005JNQA,"The Interpreter(released Apr/05)stars Nicole Kidman as the titled interpreter Silvia Broome,Sean Penn as secret service agent Tobin Kellar,along with a nice supporting cast. The film pulls you in from the start and Pollack is on game,revealing plot elements like pieces in a puzzle;with a very pleasing but different end result.
The film opens in Matobo,a fictional African country,full of strife and internal violence,run by its dictator Edmond Zuwanie(Earl Cameron).Three people drive up to an old stadium,in disrepair, for a rendezvous;one is a black interpreter,one is Kidman's brother Simon and one is a friend of Simon and Kidman's,Phillippe,a photgrapher,who arranged the meeting. Phillippe stays behind in the vehicle as the other two enter the stadium. They find three young boys playing soccer and one of them leads the two men under the stadium to view several dead bodies,from a recent massacre. After a few moments the boy yells to the men that someone is coming. As they rush out they are confronted with the boys who now are armed. The two men are shot dead. Phillippe hears the shots,as one of Zuwanie's men drive up. Phillippe hides,then flees the country.
Back in the States we start to follow the life of interpreter Kidman,who works at the UN.One day an evacuation is called in the building,and all personnel leave. Kidman,who forgot her satchel,returns to her office to retrieve it and hears some chatter on her headphones. It is a conversation about the killing of the teacher(Zuwanie),who is coming to speak at the UN.As she listens the lights in her room come on and she frantically switches them off,but the voices appear to know she is there and she flees. The next day she reports what she heard and secret service man Penn and company show up. In short time he/they doubt her story and she goes through a battery of testing and interrogation. They cannot shake her story,as she is adamant about what she heard and its intent. We learn Kidman is originally from Motabo and her sister and parents were killed there,years before. She took up arms briefly with her brother,but left after killing a young boy,who was about to kill her.
As the film progresses,Kidman is being followed and fears for her life. In fact an intruder enters her apartment,taking a mask,then appearing on the outside fire escape and running off. That man leaves behind a trace of hair and a Motaboan killer,the same one seen outside the stadium where her brother got killed,appears and snuffs out his underling for his sloppiness. Kidman knows of a  rival of Zuwanies in New York,Kuman-Kuman(George Harris).She meets him on a bus,accusing him of much of the violence in her home country. He denies the charges and says he will see what he can find out about her brother. In the meantime,the Motabaon killer has come on board with a satchel in hand,along with one secret service agent following Kidman and another following the killer. It's a cozy set up until Penn asks his men via radio ear buds,whether the man is carrying anything. Penn and his associates have found the killers victim and some explosives. When the killer gets off it first appears that he has taken everything with him. Penn tells his men to get off,Kidman and one agent do,as a woman finds what she says is a lunch bag the killer left behind. In seconds the bus blows up,killing many aboard,including the agent and Kuman-Kuman and his entourage,along with others on the street.
The day of Zuwanies speech comes and Kidman is taking a shower,at least that is what Penn thinks;as he and his colleagues have been sitting across the street monitoring her room and activities. However she leaves the shower water running and escapes out the bathroom window. She goes to the UN and waits in a safe room,the place in which she figures Zuwanie will be taken to,if anything should happen. The scene switches to the UN where all precautions have been taken inside and out,as Penn suspects this is going to be a suicide bomber,and the bomb,he thinks,is already in the UN.As Zuwanie stands before the UN giving his speech a hitman has entered the sound control booth and he is putting together a rifle. Penns hunch was wrong but when he spies a hole cut in the booth glass,pieces of the puzzle come together in his head and in short order, is quickly climbing the stairs. I won`t reveal the ending as such,but it brings together alot of the puzzle that Pollock has laid out before us through the films progression. The ending is bittersweet also,but a fitting one.
Pollock himself appears a few times in this film as Penn`s boss and did a great job(not the first time he`s appeared in films,either his own or someone elses).After that shooting takes place in the opening scenes Pollock has our attention straight away. From then on we switch to the States and the puzzle and its pieces are laid out bit by bit, building on one another. Pollock weaves a compelling tale and the climax is quite the culmination of layers of many elements. Smart,well presented and edited,this is definitely one of my favourite Pollock films.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include deleted scenes,an alternate ending,three featurettes and a short on Pollock discussing widescreen vs Pan and Scan. The latter I watched and it should be mandatory viewing for all movie goers and watchers,especially the home bound crowd. It also should be mandatory viewing for ANYONE involved in the distribution of movies,in any capacity.
All in all an excellent and engrossing tale about African corruption and violence,coming to US soil and its ultimate consequences. Pollock,along with his two main stars do a bang up job throughout. 4-4 1/2 stars.",1348531200,,5731,4.890030832476875

1524742,3,B00005JNQA,"I really wanted to love this movie. I really did. I am a big fan of political thrillers, but this one.....something is missing here. First off, I will admit that Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman give good performances. They're very convincing in their respective roles. The dialogue is sharp, I'll also give credit to that. But then, their chemistry is very uninteresting. It's almost the weakest element in the film. But it's not: the weakest part of The Interpreter is the lack of tension throughout the film. Usually, with such a fascinating plot, there would be plenty of suspense between the protagonists and the unknown force that's binding the story (in other words, the unknown antagonist). But there's hardly any tension, and that's mostly because the chemistry between Kidman and Penn's characters mostly get in the way. Just when you think that the story would progress, then in comes the the scenes involving the two characters' friendship. And then, there's the ending, which was relatively predictable.

The Interpreter isn't really that bad, but it's not great, either. The film is marred by lack of suspense, unnecessary chemistry between Penn and Kidman, and a fairly predictable ending. Our two actors give very nice performances, though, and if you're a fan of either of them, you MIGHT feel satisfied with this movie.

1524756,4,B00005JNQA,"Nicole Kidman plays an interpreter who works at the United Nations.  Her speciality is southern African dialects, since she was born and raised there.  In the meantime, half a world away, three men enter an abandoned soccer stadium, and after seeing a room full of bodies, are in turn killed.

One night she returns to work after hours to retrieve a bag she left there, and incidentally overhears some men over the UN's translater system.  She doesn't know what it means, at first, but the US Secret Service gets involved, because an extremely unpopular leader of a southern African nation is coming to the UN to address the assembly.  Sean Penn plays the officer who leads the team in charge of the investigation.

That's the set-up.

I have to admit that I was fairly impressed by the series of plot twists and intertwined story lines that were woven together in this film.

Kidman, originally from Australia, plays a convincing southern African.  Penn, though clearly aging, does a good job of playing a grieving widdower who believes that working will help him deal with his loss.

The development of the story line, illumination of character after character and how they are connected with each other made for a great movie-watching experience for me.  This is not, however, an action adventure film, it is a political thriller.  There are no high speed chase scenes, no spattered automatic weapons fire, but there are plenty of scenes that build significant suspence, and enough other scenes when the tension is released that it worked, at least for me.

This film is, all in all, a solid film, and I recommend it, but it won't ever be a 5-star classic in my book.  it is well worth watching a time or two.",1290384000,,1712,4.739864864864865

1524762,4,B00005JNQA,"The Interpreter is an excellent film.  It is serious and thoughtful- not the overblown nonsense that I think the advertisements and whatnot made it out to be. It's a political thriller that is realistic, at least in the way it treats the characters and their motivations. Perhaps some might argue that the individual ""suspense"" elements of plot are not very realistic, but the fine acting, script, and serious presentation give those elements more credibility than they might have if just considered on their own merits.

The film is measured, without a lot of dramatic music and flashy editing. It also treats the fictional political conflict, which could easily stand in for any number of real-world situations such as Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka, or the Congo, very seriously and does a good job connecting human emotions with a type of conflict that most of us probably don't relate to very well here in the US.

The best thing about the movie is the acting by Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn. They are both utter professionals who clearly embraced their roles. Ms. Kidman is icy and enigmatic, but somehow still allows the viewer to feel her barely submerged pain and suffering. Mr. Penn is completely convincing as a consummate professional torn up by some inner demons.

Perhaps some viewers may not find this movie particularly ""entertaining."" It lacks the sensationalism and flash that audiences might expect. It also features some pretty miserable characters-- I don't think there's a single laugh in the whole film. The politics it deals with is the type most Americans would rather pretend don't exist- the continued suffering and strife of impoverished post-colonial African nations. It is however, a masterfully acted, technically accomplished, and thought-provoking movie, and a really tense thriller, as well.",1250553600,2,1813,5.156462585034014

1524831,4,B00005JNQA,"This film would be, unfortunately, director Sidney Pollack's last. Boasting a cast of Oscar winners (Kidman and Penn), and a slightly convoluted story, ""The Interpreter"" is also gripping entertainment. Pollack begins his story in South Africa with the killing of 2 journalists and then segues to the UN where Kidman as an Afrikanner interpreter works.  As the story slowly unfolds, we find that her knowledge of a planned assasination could put her life in danger and that's where a cynical FBI agent (Penn) comes in to check up on her story.  What begins as a tentative relationship between the two slowly unfolds as they become intricately involved but without actually having a consumative relationship which marred Pollack's own ""3 Days of the Condor"" (I could never buy the relationship between Redford and Dunaway).  In this era of short attention spans, Pollack should be applauded for taking his time in developing these relationships as well as slowly involving us in their dilemna (the slight twist near the end was nice).

The plot is realistic in the sense of how the world deals with conflicts in non-oil rich 'banana republics' and the director's pro UN / anti war point of view shines clearly through. Other than that the story line is thin and far fetched as many have pointed out. But the acting is no less excellent despite of that and there are many philosophical gems inserted along the way (allegedly all deriving from the sayings in the 'Ku' language).

1524839,4,B00005JNQA,"Director Sydney Pollack creates a well-crafted thriller in his film, The Interpreter. Tapping into the global paranoia of a post 9/11 world, the story acts as both a standard political thriller and a rallying call for peace through better communication. The screenplay was written by Charles Randolph, Scott Frank, and Steven Zaillian.

When Silvia Broome, an interpreter for the United Nations, overhears a conversation concerning a plot to kill a controversial political leader from Africa, she is thrust into a dangerous world of international intrigue. When she reports what she's heard, no one believes her. When a government agent named Tobin Keller is assigned to uncover the validity of the potential threat, he at first disbelieves Silvia's story... until she herself becomes a target. Then Tobin, who recently lost his wife in an automobile accident, begins to bond with Silvia, who herself has a tragic past and is very familiar with loss. As it becomes clear that there really is a plot, Tobin and Silvia must rely on one another in order to find out who is behind the conspiracy. But the more that Tobin learns of Silvia's past the more apparent it becomes that it was no coincidence that she overheard the conversation to begin with. Is Silvia involved in the plot or was she targeted from the start? And can Tobin protect her from the many dangers that they now face?

The film stars Nicole Kidman as Silvia Broome and Sean Penn as Tobin Keller. The supporting cast is filled out by Catherine Keener, Jesper Christensen, Yvan Attal, Earl Cameron, George Harris, Hugo Speer, and Curits l'Cook. Director Pollack also has an uncredited role as Chief Jay Pettigrew. The entire cast gives great performances, and Kidman, in particular, gives a powerful sense of loss and moral confusion.
While the film may not be Pollack's most impressive directorial effort, it is a remarkable written and acted film with some surprising twists. Unlike most thrillers of this kind, the two main characters never consummate their relationship in a sexual manner. Instead the screenplay allows Kidman and Penn to give subtle performances with nuance and believability. What makes The Interpreter so suspenseful is that we, as an audience, are given time to become emotionally invested in the characters as they are tested emotionally, physically, and morally.
Also adding to the believability of the film is the fact that many scenes were actually shot at the United Nations, which had never before allowed a commercial film to shoot within their walls. So in a way, Sydney Pollack has made movie history by earning permission to film there.

The DVD includes an alternate ending, deleted scenes, Sydney Pollack at Work: From Concept to Cutting Room featurette, Interpreting Pan & Scan vs. Widescreen featurette, The Ultimate Movie Set: The United Nations featurette, and an insightful audio commentary by Pollack.

1524840,4,B00005JNQA,"Normally, I am not fond of Nicole Kidman's acting abilities, but in this movie, I was pretty impressed with her skills in playing the part of Sylvia Broome a multilingual interpreter at the United Nations.

Sylvia Broome overhears a death threat against a controversial African leader, but is unable to identify the speaker due to the circumstances. She reports what she hears only to have the Secret Service not believe what she has to say. In fact, the Secret Service thinks Sylvia Broome may be a part of the plot her self as she has a reason not to like African political leader.

Sean Penn plays the part of Tobin Keller and is assigned to investigate Sylvia Broome to see if what she has to say has any merit what so ever. The movie becomes a fast paced, suspenseful, political thriller and is fun to watch!",1222128000,,813,4.561643835616438

Besides, she's a pretty girl, and a movie could do worse than show lots of close-ups of Nicole Kidman's face, and I told him  (and you too, amazon readers) if a person REALLY wants to see a movie that sets the record for having so much of itself consisting of close-ups of one person's face, try The Ring Two, where practically the whole movie is close-ups of Naomie Watts's face.",1208649600,,715,4.37593984962406

1524926,1,B00005JNQA,"For the first half of the movie I thought ""The Interpreter"" was going to be good. Then it got bogged down in twists and turns that happened so fast one hardly had time to figure out what was going on.  In the second half, new and undeveloped characters galloped in and then out. It was hardly satisfying when one finally learned who the really bad guys were because even the ""good"" guys seemed like bad guys. I believe I could have understood the plot better if I watched it a second time, but I have no desire to do so because I never found much reason to care what happened.

I'm not a fan of either Nicole Kidman or Sean Penn, but her nearly lifeless portrayal of Silvia made Sean's Secret Service man look really interesting.  Kidman does not act at all using her face ... it is almost frozen and pretty much unchanging, we have no idea what her inner emotions are.  She seems to be a one-note actress wherever she appears. But Penn's face is excellent at letting us know what the interior man is feeling.  As he has aged, it seems to me that he has gone past the arrogance and shrillness he once displayed in almost every role.

It was the plot in the second half of the movie, however, that did me in ... car chases, explosions, failures of surveillance officers to keep track of whoever they're trailing, and the refusal of Kidman's character to reveal what the cops needed to know ... just didn't jell or make sense.

Probably a good thing the two main characters went their separate ways ... Penn displayed a poignant sense of grief for his dead wife, Kidman hardly changed expression as she went through her brother's papers.  The plot badly needed simplification and cleaning up.  Too many undeveloped characters as well.  In addition, somewhere in the film the moviemakers might have found a way to make us care.",1202601600,,1824,4.5
1524927,3,B00005JNQA,"Long, boring, and incoherent, this is one of those 'global' film experiments that falls flat on its' face. I think Angelina Jolie is the only one that got it right on 'Beyond Borders', but this film takes Aussie Nicole Kidman and places her in the UN, where the poor thing is supposed to convince us that she can speak a variety of languages.

The problem is, Nicole sounds like she's speaking Australian English even when shes speaking Swahili, which obviously isn't a good thing. The high power star cast does nothing to clarify the confusing, meandering plot, and by the time the end comes, you're left wondering why it is you're supposed to care. I had more fun watching the unintentionally hilarious 'Original Sin' starring Antonio Banderas.

This film looks like it wanted an Oscar so badly, that they got the best director, and cinematographer to work on it. In the process, they forgot to concentrate on the script, and Nicole playing a South African who is 'patriotic' really got on my nerves. Why couldn't they cast a black actress in her role if they really cared? It would have made more sense. In the end, we get the feeling that this blonde, blue eyed beauty is some sort of Africa-loving philanthropist, and I didn't buy that.

Next time, they should cast someone really good like Thandie Newton in a role like this, and respect the real crises that Africa is going through, instead of glossing it over and giving us guilt-ridden Caucasians in lead roles that so obviously belong to a black person.

Even Two Stars is generous for this narcissistic mess.",1194220800,,1569,4.736263736263736
1524928,4,B00005JNQA,"Nicole Kidman might have never looked so beautiful as she did playing the haunted UN interpreter Silvia Broome.  And Sean Penn has this masculine arrogance that somehow holds her attention long enough for her to forget about her pressing problems concerning Africa.  I saw this film again last night on cable TV and it was much more confusing the second time around.  Probably should invest in the DVD so I could access the deleted scenes which (maybe) explain everything.  There must be deleted scenes like crazy involving Catherine Keener talking to her agent and listening to the agent explain why she really needed to be in this movie, for they might as well have hired Nicole Richie so little acting ability was needed for her brief scenes with Penn.  Keener's mumbling, thin lipped accent made Nicole Kidman sound almost human.

Director Sydney Pollack must have felt bells clicking in his head when he glimpsed Nicole Kidman and heard a tape of the various accents she has essayed on screen.  Not since Meryl Streep has anyone done so many so promiscously, and it is said that Pollack forcefed Kidman hours worth of tapes of Meryl Streep doing the famous ""I had a farm in Africa"" opening to OUT OF AFRICA, of which I now consider THE INTERPRETER an unoffical remake.  The implication is that Kidman, and her doomed family the Broomes, are the real inheritors of Africa, and that the black revolutions and counterrevolutions that have destroyed the Broomes are hopelessly evil and subhuman.  Why, Nicole, why?  Maybe you wanted to show you weren't afraid of big issues, but why play an African saint when so many talented black actresses were out there just longing for a big meaty part opposite Sean Penn--and many of them much more able to adopt a whispery Danish slash Dutch accent than you (not to mention playing the flute).  Do the DVD scenes tell us why the screenwriters decided to have her play the flute anyhow?  Was it just to get her back into the building after hours?

Couldn't she have just forgotten her Metro Card or her purse or something?  No, no, it had to be musical--tragically musical.  John Garfield spent four months at Juilliard learning to play the piano for HUMORESQUE (1946), but Nicole Kidman learned the flute in under forty-five minutes on the set of MOULIN ROUGE.  Ah, the pace of modern filmmaking!  No wonder she seems to make even more movies than the stars of the Golden Age Hollywood cinema.",1191974400,,2435,4.77326968973747
1524929,4,B00005JNQA,"I saw this movie at the end of its run in the movie theaters. My husband & son were not interested but I was intrigued by the reviews I had read so I went by myself. I do not care for gratuitous violence in movies. A really good movie, in the opinion of the men in my life, must have a violent death in the first 60 seconds and 25-30 violent scenes total -- car crashes, murders, blown up buildings, fight scenes. There is violence in this movie but it is not gratuitous and I found the movie much less violent than I expected. An explosion and murders occur but they are the type of violence that would happen if this film was relating a real life African political intrigue. The African political situation at the core of this movie is plausible which is more than can be said about the plots of many other movies. I thought the screen play for this movie was both well written and true to life. (I don't mean to imply implausible is the necessarily the same as bad-- some of the best movies ever are completely implausible.)

Nicole Kidman's character, a UN interpreter who is expert in African dialects, returns to her booth to pick up an item left behind. The UN floor appears to be empty but she inadvertently overhears a conversation about a planned assassination of the current leader of an African nation , a man who is due to make an appearance at the UN. The African nation is the one in which her family lived; she grew up there. She reports the overheard conversation to the FBI. The FBI, especially a grieving agent played by Sean Penn, does not believe her. They investigate her and find in her past life in Africa many reasons to doubt her story. However, they must investigate the planned assassination anyway even if they think it is bogus. It soon becomes clear as unexpected (some violent) events begin to take place surrounding the interpreter that something is going on although the FBI agent played by Sean Penn is unsure whether it is a real African based assassination plot or the interpreter reported the conversation to throw off suspicion from herself for something she is planning. At the same time, he finds himself drawn to her, the first woman who has interested him since the death of his wife. Nicole Kidman brings to her role the sort of class and reserve one would imagine a UN interpreter to possess. I found Sean Penn's tortured FBI agent portrayal sympathetic and very Sean Penn-ish. (I must admit I do not believe FBI agents are really so dishevelled looking. Perhaps I am just assuming as truth that FBI agents are ""men in black."")

I enjoyed all of the plot twists (there ARE many) in this story, the unfolding of the mystery behind the overheard conversation, how it relates to the interpreter's past, the rise and fall of leaders in the African nation. This story was more layered than most thrillers (I have seen them; one can't help it with the men in my life). I would not call it a thriller at all, but a political mystery. It's a very good mystery movie and an unusual one. The movie is set in New York City and partially in Africa. The movie addresses political corruption and legal ethics (which crimes might be justifiable, which crimes should be punished). The UN scenes are fascinating to someone (like me) with an interest in world politics. If you have such an interest too, you may enjoy this movie as I did.

BTW on nit-picking reviews: I have noticed some negative reviewers who have nit-picked the movie to justify their thumbs down for it (one review: chess board mistake, ""booger"" sighting). My husband, too, likes to pick out nits in the movies he did not like. Recently, I have been drawing his attention to the nits in the movies he loves: a little reminder that there are unbelievable situations and errors in his favorite movies too. His attitude is ""so what?"" I guess we honestly do not mind nits in the movies we like and they loom large and overwhelming in the movies we hate. And then there are the movies that are so bad, no one likes them! Still I would like to see negative reviews that explain more fully why the reviewer did not like the movie. It would be more helpful to amazon customers.",1190332800,,4166,4.522546419098143
1524930,2,B00005JNQA,"The over rated Kidman could not nail a proper accent so her accent is from a non-existent country, which is what directors have to do when they have hired a marginally talented performer.  Sadly Kidman has very little to show us that has not been seen over and over again as Hollywood keeps selling her as a talented actor.  If one focuses on Sean Penn trying to keep a straight face by pretending he actually cares about her character and if one buys into the ludicrous plot, one can be entertained by this movie while drunk.",1187308800,,526,4.46875
1524991,4,B00005JNQA,"The premise in this tightly wrought thriller directed by the very accomplished Sydney Pollack is that Zuwanie (Earl Cameron) the old dictator (once ""freedom fighter"") of an African nation called ""Matobo"" is coming to New York to make a speech in front of the General Assembly of the United Nations.  Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman), an interpreter at the UN, overhears part of a conversation after-hours that leads her to believe that there will be an assassination attempt on the leader's life.  She tells security.  Federal agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) is called in to investigate and help prevent an assassination.

Keller quickly discovers that Silvia is from Matobo where her parents were murdered by some of Zuwanie's henchmen and where she was subsequently involved in some political/paramilitary activities.  Two questions that Keller must answer are, does she have some sort of motive to lie and how is she involved?

The problem with the film (aside from some of the usual improbabilities and contortions found in Hollywood thrillers--and to be honest there weren't that many in this one) is the ending.  Without giving anything away, the probability of Zumanie being left alone after what had happened is something like zero.  But the real problem is what happens between Tobin and Silvia at the end.  They are both very available and after they have had the opportunity to bond under very difficult circumstances, can you guess how their relationship is resolved?  I understand there was an alternative ending.  Maybe Pollack should have employed it.

Pollack's films going back several decades are characterized by diversity of subject matter, excellent scripts, and star power.  Four of his best are They Shoot Horses Don't They? (1969) (depression ear dance marathon drama starring Jane Fonda); Tootsie (1982) (romantic comedy starring Dustin Hoffman); Out of Africa (1985) (adapted from the famous book by Karen Blixen under her pen name ""Isak Dinesen,"" starring Meryl Streep and Robert Redford); and Sabrina (1995) (splendid remake of the Audrey Hepburn film this time starring Julie Ormond and Harrison Ford).  But he tends to like action/adventure as much as comedy or drama.  He is one of filmdom's most versatile directors, and this film, while not his best, is very representative of his work.

But what carries the film is the charisma of the stars, Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman, especially Kidman who seems the very impersonation of what an interpreter at the UN might be.  She manages to be delicate but tough, thoroughly professional and beautiful.  I have seen her in seven or eight films and can say that she is as talented as any actress currently working.  In her ability to concentrate and to completely immerse herself in a role she is comparable to Meryl Streep.  Some early films of hers that display her youthful vitality and the natural sophistication and nuanced manner of her style are Dead Calm (1989), Flirting (1991), and To Die For (1995).

By the way, ""Matobo"" is not an actual nation but is the name of a national park in Zimbabwe and as far as I can tell ""Ku"" is not an actual language.  (I have no idea what they were speaking.)

Sean Penn also did a great job as the agent trying to figure out the truth. It being filmed in the U.N. makes this film really unique and realistic, especially with the protestors outside that add an extra touch to this film. Overall, this movie is worth seeing.

1524997,2,B00005JNQA,"Nicole Kidman gives an absolutely lifeless performance as the interpreter of the title in this curiously flat Sidney Pollack film. THE INTERPRETER is unique as it is the only film ever shot on location inside the United Nations building in New York.

Kidman plays Sylvia Broome, a minority White expatriate from a politically torn racially-mixed African nation. Members of her family have died due to the violence in her native land, and other friends and relatives who have remained behind are backing one or another contender for the Presidency of the fictional country. Kidman becomes the centerpiece of a massive international investigation after she ovehears discussion of an assassination plot against the despotic President, who is scheduled to address the United Nations. Sean Penn plays the govenment agent who is assigned to simultaneously protect Kidman, foil the plot, and find out what she really knows and where she really stands.

THE INTERPRETER has all the elements to make up a grand espionage drama, but Pollack and the all-star cast fail to ignite this film. THE INTERPRETER should have worked but it doesn't, leaving it the sort of film that cries out for a remake the day shooting wraps. The story plods along at an elephantine pace; the willowy Kidman is too morally ambiguous to gain the audience's sympathy; Sean Penn is convincing but cranky. No one seems to speak over a murmur even at the most dramatic moments. The contrivance of a fictional country is far too quaint for the world-is-the-size-of-a-grape 21st century.

1525000,4,B00005JNQA,"I think in many directors' hands, ""The Interpreter"" would be run-of-the-mill stuff.  Thankfully, Sydney Pollack isn't run-of-the-mill quality.  He's crafted a really suspenseful and - in my mind - realistic thriller that keeps you fully engaged throughout the entire film.  [And, I might add, Pollack - as usual - acts here as well and he's as engaging on camera as he is talented behind it.]

Now, I've never been a big Nicole Kidman fan (""To Die For"" aside), and the coquettish whisper in which she delivers every line in this film is certainly distracting. Thankfully, Pollack gets solid performances from Catherine Keener, Sean Pean, George Harris (on a roll after ""Layer Cake"") and the Danish actor Jesper Christensen.  Christensen, in particular, makes the film in my estimation.  Is he a good guy or a bad guy, you're never quite sure.  [In fact, in the 'Deleted Scenes' on the DVD, you can see Pollack stripped out a couple of scenes that give away some of Christensen's character and motivations too early.  That's a master touch because the end product keeps you guessing without losing any of the narrative drive.]

At the heart of tale woven by Pollack is the story of African dictator 'Zuwanie,' as portrayed by the regal (and then-88-year-old!!) Earl Cameron, a dictator in the Mobutu mold (colonial liberator slowly morphing to repressive, gun-toting dictator).  Will he be killed on an upcoming trip to the UN (as Kidman's character has overheard) or will a staged and failed assassination attempt consolidate and strengthen his hand back home (as Harris' 'Kuman-Kuman' suggests)?

Considering the level of talent involved in its making (Sean Penn, Nicole Kidman and Catherine Keener in front of the camera and director Sydney Pollack behind), ""The Interpreter"" turns out to be a surprisingly dull and lackluster political thriller, one whose attempts at topicality can't make up for the film's extreme over length and tedious plotline.

Kidman plays Sylvia, an interpreter working at the U.N., who accidentally overhears what sounds like death threats aimed at an African dictator who is scheduled to deliver a speech before the General Assembly in a few weeks.  Penn and Keener are investigators who begin to suspect that Sylvia may not be quiet the disinterested observer she portrays herself to be in regards to the case.

There's nothing overtly wrong with ""The Interpreter"" except that it never manages to engage us very fully in either its storyline or its characters.  Everyone involved in the production - from writer to director to actor - seems to be just going through the motions here.  In the inevitable romantic scenes, Penn and Kidman generate zero charisma together, and Keener is essentially wasted in her role as Penn's unsmiling, cynical partner.

On second thought, there is one aspect to ""The Interpreter"" that might, be deemed offensive by some - and that is the film's willingness to use sensitive topics like genocide and terrorism as mere window dressing for what is, when all is said and done, a pretty lightweight whodunit confection.",1147219200,7,1487,5.094650205761317

For most of the way, this was a slick thriller, nicely photographed and nicely acted. Sean Penn is outstanding in here. I like to see him play low-key characters instead of hot-headed sleazeballs. Nicole Kidman also gives a good performance. Sometimes her classic beauty hides the fact she can act.

The story was pretty involving, hard to put down once you've started. My only complaint up to the ending was the obvious plug for the United Nations. This looked a public relations piece for that organization.

However, then came that ending - a real insult to anyone's intelligence. In a nutshell, nobody would go the extremes they went to here to protect a visiting dignitary, using all that manpower and machinery....and then leave him all alone in a room at the end! Are you serious??? It was unbelievably stupid and ruined what had been an entertaining and somewhat- smart film.",1146441600,8,963,4.824242424242424

I just finished watching this motion picture and have to wonder why it was packaged as a ""suspenseful thriller""?  My heart beats faster during a Wednesday night IDOL vote off!  This film had a great cast but there was no character development.  Oscar winners Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman star in this movie about African politics that come to the United Nations.  Penn is the secret service agent who is assigned to protect Kidman's character. She is a United Nations interpreter (from Africa) who overhears a plot to assassinate the president of her own African country.  There are also gripping scenes that take place in Africa showing the horrors of genocide.

What could have been touching and poignant scenes were just flat and unemotional.  I cry during television commercials yet I wasn't even sad during parts that normally make me sob.  Even during the scene where the rifle was being assembled to 'pretend' shoot Zuwanie, I didn't care if Sean Penn's character made it to the sound booth or not.

I think the story was a good one but could have been better.  I enjoyed the shots of the United Nations and of New York City.  Nicole, as usual is lovely to look at.  I did sit through the entire film so I did find it mildly entertaining; I just wouldn't watch it again.",1146268800,,1286,4.6415929203539825
1525049,2,B00005JNQA,"In the DVD bonus materials, Sydney Pollack admits that casting and shooting on this film started without a script.  His comments suggested that this movie was written as they went.  All the silly plot and character twists are proof that approach was taken to this movie, start to finish.

The Interpreter starts quickly, suspensefully, gets bogged down in the middle, and has a corny, boring ending.  The first hour of the movie is promising.  The second hour is almost regrettable.

What derails it is the forced twists and turns that only make sense due to the injection of a (rather uninteresting) back story.  Because I do not want to spoil the entire film, I'll leave out details.  Suffice it to say, the movie would have been better had it followed the plotline suggested very early on, i.e. that Nicole Kidman's character, Silvia Broome, simply stumbled upon an assassination plot.  Instead, her past is tied in with the events that unfold throughout the rest of the film.

It's as if Hollywood writers and/or directors these days cannot resist bringing multiple subplots together to (artificially) create suspense.  Not every so-called ""action thriller"" needs an ironic climax.  Most films in that genre do not seem to use the device particularly well -- most seem to overuse it -- and The Interpreter is one such film.

Nicole Kidman does a great job with the character and ""script"" but her character is ridiculously improbable.  At the risk of giving away too much, a person of Ms. Broome's (political/activist) background would never get a job as an interpreter at the UN.

Sean Penn's character, Tobin Keller, is interesting and well-played, but he seems more New York City detective, maybe low-level FBI, than Secret Service Agent.  Looking at him on the screen you can almost smell the alcohol on his breath.  While clearly a bright guy that knows his job, Keller does not seem like the buttoned-down, highly-disciplined prototypical Secret Service agent.

The portrayal of the UN as a body that is greatly concerned about ""genocide"" in Africa rings hollow.  In reality, the UN has sat by idly while various African nations have torn themselves apart through civil war, inter-tribal fighting, genocide, political corruption, AIDS, and a score of other ills.  Given the reality, Pollacks' UN lovefest is puzzling to say the least.",1146182400,7,2343,5.020725388601036
1525050,4,B00005JNQA,"It's always a nice surprise when movies turn out better-than-expected. The Interpreter, thanks to Nicole Kidman, was not just thoughtful, but involving. As with anything having Sean Penn in it, it was somewhat top-heavy in the 'message' department, but Kidman's elfin grace saved the day. Her portrait of a 'white' woman-and fair-haired as well; which kind of drives home the point-whose 'home' is a country where white skin is a cause of social displacement, discrimination and alienation, was understated and therefore effective. By comparion, Penn was ponderous and colorless; which is possibly as it should have been. His character, despite a contrived background that served mainly as a tool for some contemplative philosophy of life and death, remained essentially shallow and undemanding.

The pacing of the story was uneven, but in this instance that was an asset. There was too much heavy stuff in here, which required some down-time on the part of the audience. All in all, the dosage was well measured and applied judiciously.

For those who wonder, after they saw the movie, just what exactly was the 'point', or what it was all 'about'-apart from it being a political polemic, which, of course and sadly, it was to a large extend...

Well, it's all in the ending-which in this movie does wrap things up, showing up the dismal and near-uncrossable gulf that will always exist between people who have something to live for and those who basically don't.

Sydney Pollack's thriller suffers from a bit of an identity crisis - does it want to be a Hitchcock suspenser, conspiracy thriller, character piece, morality play or poltical drama? To which the answer is, probably. Throwing away its Hitchcockian premise, it wears the conspiracy clothes most comfortably, but the plot is easily guessed thanks to two massively unsubtle hints and, aside from a good sequence on a bus, builds up to what would be a serious anticlimax if the rest of the film were any better. Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn, the latter looking like a bizarre deflated hybrid of Walter Matthau, Dustin Hoffman and Pollack himself here, do ok by their cliched parts and the casting of Earl Cameron, one time elder statesman of British race-relations pictures like Sapphire and Flame in the Streets, as the Mugabe-like liberator-turned-dictator is clever.

Sean Penn plays the U.S. Secret Service agent assigned to investigate the interpreter and see if she did hear what she says she did.

""The Interpreter"" is Sydney Pollack's first film since 1999's flop ""Random Hearts"".  Pollack's directing is one of the two high points of the film.  The other is the cast.  Kidman and Penn are both very good and, paired with Pollack's directing, they keep the film going.

Other than those points mentioned above, the film has little going for it.  About fifty minutes through the film I was sick of it.  There's very little originality in the film; it's cliched and predictable.  I felt like I was watching another dumb thriller.

1525107,2,B00005JNQA,"Just got done watching The Interpreter and I must say, it just lacked something. I really like Nicole Kidman and think she is a good actress. I also like Sean Penn in most of the work he has done and Katherine Keaner. But this movie just wasn't that good. First I found no chemistry between Penn and Kidman which would have been fine if they wouldn't have tried to throw in this stupid connection or love story with them. If it would have just been cop and the person he was protecting/suspecting it wouldn't have been bad that they didn't click together. They for some reason decide that Penn, who has only met this woman a day or two before and thinks that she may be a conspirator and possibly an assassin, for no reason at all is going to bear his soul to this complete stranger about his wife being killed just recently and how much he loved her and wanted her back and that she was coming back (which they show you by having him listen to his answering machine with a message from her saying she was coming back right before she was killed and how much he despised the guy she ran off with). No we are suppose to believe that he would tell somebody he doesn't even know this and show this total vunerable side of himself to a stranger but we are also suppose to believe that even though he is grieving the woman he loved more than anything and that she has just recently been killed that he immediately is falling for a woman that could be a killer. This is just forced, stupid and adds nothing to story but actually adds more time and makes it even more bogged down. If it would have been Kidman being a master manipulator and playing on Penns vunerablilities and using him, fine. But this was just crap that hollywood feels they have to add so they can have some love story that doesn't even need to be there.

The pace of the movie is also slow. There are also so many African politicians, rebels, security, bodyguards and FBI, Secret Service, cops, survielance and UN Officials and interpreters that were unremarkable that I had a hard time remembering who was who. Keaner was also underused and simply a character that could have been really interesting but was basically just somebody that could say, ""are you alright?"" and ""you need to go home"" to Penn every other time she spoke.

Its worth watching once but I really wish I would have rented it and not bought it. I wouldn't recommend it. Not one of Penn or Kidmans best efforts but that may be because of the story and direction which was a suprise cause Sydney Pollak (who makes his usual cameo) is usually very good and right on.",1138320000,,2597,4.397089397089397

The opening is really strong -suspense and excitement you could cut with a knife. And then I had to leave! I was hooked and had to see the end so I went out and got a copy and I'm happy I did.  The interplay and sexual tension between Penn and Kiddman was done with a masterful hand. The plot, a little farfetched if you looked too closely, had enough twists and turns to keep me focused and engaged. The action - explosions, chase scenes, shoot outs - was well done and not over done (given the current trend where action alone transcends plot and character).

The wrap-up (in my opinion) was not up to the quality and excitement of the opening scenes and I left wishing for an alternate ending.  But I loved the fact that this was shot on location (NYC makes a great backdrop) and had a New York look and feel about it.

Overall, the movie was a fun suspense thriller, definitely worth a look. It probably could have been better but, heck, this review could have been written better!",1137974400,5,1109,4.338164251207729

1525110,2,B00005JNQA,"It is interesting that the African crisis that is the subject of the Interpreter must be a fictional dictator in a fictional sub-saharan country. There are so many real African dictators and ethnic wars to choose from, to do so would have underlied the fact that the UN rarely does anything substantial about these situations. Pollack's reverence for the physical UN, clearly in evidence in the DVD extras, may have a lot to do with the story looking like something that passed through a bureaucratic approval process. High on the unintentional hilarity scale is the moment where the headquarters are described as a place ""where things get done.""

The telling Africa crisis for the UN was not the made-up Matobo but the very real Rwanda genocide in 1994. Anybody familiar with the international effort there won't be easily convinced by ""the Interpreter"" that anything major gets resolved in that building, by all those diplomats in all of those suits. Will the villain get sent to the Hague for ten years of checkers with Milosevic?

Kidman and Penn, the latter whose mere involvement kind of gives away the theme of the movie, have this interesting lack of chemistry. All of their scenes together feel like a bad first date, which could have really worked for the movie but for the very last scene. Kidman hasn't had any interesting work since ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" where the strained chemistry with her co-star was used brilliantly. The little ""I believe in the UN"" speeches that Kidman gives are absurd and little insulting. Penn gets very little to work with in telling his background tragedies. The two actors are probably too high-profile to convincingly embody characters whose careers rely at least partially on anonymity.

I won't give away the movie here, but it's notable that the most violent (and well-staged) event in ""the Interpreter"" resembles recent scenes in Europe and Asia - but not the United States. While such things are possible here, the makers of this film try to prop up the role of the UN by whitewashing some very recent history. In short, watching this movie really shouldn't convince you of the importance of the UN, with its big rooms, clumsy podiums and 1950's era furniture. Go rent ""Grizzly Man"" instead.",1137456000,4,2236,4.91005291005291
1525171,4,B00005JNQA,"Only liberal Hollywood would cast Sean Penn as - of all things - a Secret Service agent and fulfill his egomaniacal dream of actually standing at the podium of the UN General Assembly.  But I'm going to try and rein in my feelings for Sean Penn and the UN here - although it will take a great show of will for me to pull that off.  Suffice it to say, I had sworn a solemn oath to never, ever watch a Sean Penn movie - and then Nicole Kidman, one of my personal favorites, goes and makes a movie with the guy.  Thus, this was an unusual film for me to sit through - and, as much as I dislike Sean Penn for a myriad of reasons (not just political - the guy did marry Madonna back when I had a teenager's crush on her, after all), he delivers a darn good performance in this movie - he was even better than Nicole.  Were it not for the fact that I have an issue with the ending and the matter of a few plot weaknesses along the way, I might have considered giving The Interpreter 5 stars.

It's hard to judge Nicole's performance because I'm not sure if I was supposed to truly like her character.  Silvia Broome (and how ironic is it that Nicole plays a witch and a character named Broome in the same year?) is fairly remote, mysterious, and secretive, and I never really warmed up to her.  This is the first time I've ever not liked or loved a Nicole Kidman character - I even loved her in To Die For, and she wasn't exactly Miss Sweetness in that one.  Here, she plays a UN interpreter who just so happens to overhear a whispered conversation (in a language only she and a handful of other people understand) pointing to an assassination attempt against President Zuwanie of the (nonexistent) African nation of Matoba.  After learning the next day that Zuwanie is planning on addressing the General Assembly in a few days, she reports what she has heard.  Now a lot of summaries tell you that Tobin Keller (Penn) is assigned to protect Silvia, but this is not accurate (not at first, anyway).  Keller's job, as a part of the Secret Service branch overseeing the security of foreign dignitaries, is to protect Zuwanie from the time he enters the US to the time he leaves.  He initially thinks Silvia is lying about the purported assassination attempt.  It's certainly true that she isn't divulging a heck of a lot of relevant information.

There are a lot of subplots and gradually revealed secrets throughout this film - and the writer and director earn major kudos for making sure all of it makes sense and doesn't cause great confusion.  In fact, it's all laid out so well that what might be considered surprises toward the end aren't surprising at all.  I wouldn't dream of going into any of the intricate details in my review, though - just know that the story is complex and very well told.

There are some definite Hollywood elements to the story, especially in terms of the ins and outs of the UN.  One would hope that UN security is better handled in real life than it is here.  Background checks, people.  Security sweeps really should involve more than someone walking through a room without actually checking anything.  And that safe room - here, it should be called a ""well, we might have checked it a week or two ago room.""  We all know the UN is corrupt, but it can't possibly be this vulnerable to security breaches.  And why were there any General Assembly microphones on at all when Silvia went back after hours to retrieve her bag?  Of course, all of these things can pretty much be forgiven - this is just a movie, after all.  It's amazing to me that the United Nations allowed Sydney Pollack to shoot a number of scenes in actual UN locations, including the General Assembly and Security Council areas.  The shooting was done on the weekends, but still - why let a brood of movie crew members traipse all over the place?  I wonder if they did background checks on these guys - and whose hands they had to grease to get the OK to film there in the first place.

In closing, I'll just say that The Interpreter surprised me - in a good way.  It was a far more intelligent, suspenseful story that I expected, and Sean Penn's presence didn't ruin it at all for me.  That's not to say I plan on watching any other Sean Penn movies, though - not unless he costars with Nicole Kidman, Jodie Foster, or Aishwarya Rai.",1137369600,2,4328,4.400753768844221

1525173,4,B00005JNQA,"Director Sydney Pollack has pulled together a movie that teeters precariously between brisk, complex thriller and serious-minded political drama. The 2005 result has several effective scenes though a sometimes muddled storyline that strains credibility toward the end. Despite a few pyrotechnics, there is no pumped-up music or over-extended special effects, and I am grateful that Pollack keeps the tension at a human-sized level. In fact, there is a pervasive old-fashioned feeling about the whole venture perhaps because Pollack has done a similar-feeling thriller back in 1975 called ""Three Days of the Condor"" where the protagonist gradually unravels a major conspiracy.

In this film, the mystery focuses on the protagonist herself, Silvia Broome, a native of a fictitious African country called Matobo. Working as an interpreter at the United Nations, she accidentally overhears what might be a plot to assassinate Matobo's bloody tyrant, President Edmund Zuwanie, when he is scheduled to address the General Assembly to respond to charges of genocide. Of course, she becomes endangered and is placed in the care of no-nonsense federal agent Tobin Keller, who himself is grieving over the auto accident of his wife two weeks earlier. There are two warring factions wanting to overthrow Zuwanie, and the subplots multiply until the tense and somewhat contrived finale. In his accompanying making-of featurette, Pollack says he was working without a final script in hand with no less than five writers working on the screenplay including Scott Frank and Steven Zaillian. It shows in some of the convolutions of the story that don't hang well together, in particular, the growing attraction between Silvia and Tobin after their convincingly antagonistic battle of principles.

With an especially clipped, Afrikaan-sounding accent, Nicole Kidman portrays Silvia effectively as both mystery woman and nave idealist even when she has to spout some patronizing lines about the value of the UN. She conveys her character's cryptic motivations fluidly as each revelation about her background comes to the fore. However, Roger Ebert and I had the same thought - how much more texturally interesting it could be to have a black actress play Silvia and how Angela Bassett comes to mind. Like a Method-version Bogie, Sean Penn plays Keller in a world-weary manner with moments of teary-eyed vulnerability as he thinks of his wife. It's a good turn by Penn though I feel the role is definitely below his skills, and there is an odd lack of chemistry between him and Kidman that actually works in the movie's favor until the mutual attraction becomes pronounced.

The rest of the serviceable cast is given short shrift by the story, including Catherine Keener, who still shows shades of her dry wit and quirky manner as Keller's sympathetic partner, Dot Woods. The real UN locations help considerably in lending authenticity to the story, and other scenes garner the right amount of suspense, such as the what-does-that-mean opening in the soccer stadium and the Brooklyn bus incident where several plot strands come together. Even the fictitious language sounds real even though it was apparently made up as a blend between Swahili and a native language of Mozambique. The ending comes up a bit empty, but the movie does pop and crackle when required.

Along with the making-of featurette which is as much about Pollack as it is about the movie, the DVD has several good extras. He is the sole voice on the commentary track and consequently, his informative contributions are separated by many unfortunate dead pauses. There is an alternate ending which is a more pointedly sentimental variation on the one used, and I agree with its excision since it is far more contrived. Three deleted scenes are included of which only one is of interest as it provides an interaction Dot has with Silvia and a predictable revelation. There is also an eight-minute short on the UN and how filming was handled there. Two other shorts offer genuinely interesting insight - the first is a fascinating presentation by Pollack in which he explains the difference between widescreen (which he uses here) and pan-and-scan formats, the second is about how real interpreters work at the UN.",1136937600,,4261,5.188953488372093

Zuwanee ascended to lead his country and was praised as a savior but soon his administration degenerated into a policy of racial genocide.

U.N. interpreter Silvia Broome, played by Kidman, a native of Matoba inadvertantly overhears an assassination plot against Zuwanne through her headphones at a time the building was being evacuated for security reasons.

Running Time:  129 minutes

Rated PG-13 for language and some violence.

Who knew Sydney Pollack still had it in him? Pollack, the veteran director behind ""Out of Africa,"" returns to the thriller genre that served him so well with hits like ""Three Days of the Condor"" and ""The Firm."" In recent years, Pollack's output has repeatedly flatlined (""Random Hearts""), but that changes with ""The Interpreter,"" a relatively, smartly mounted thriller.  A 71 year-old man in what has unfortunately become a young person's business, Pollack uses his years of patience and respect for the audience to help maintain his picture's pace and reluctance to spell things out; ""Interpreter"" isn't some gaudy, ridiculously half-baked piece of pop film-making. While it clearly relishes its thrills, the picture is a much more restrained experience that leans heavily on character exploration and tension than on goofball money shots.

One late night while retrieving some personal items, United Nations African interpreter Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman) accidentally overhears an assassination plot involving a controversial African dignitary in town for a visit. Calling for protection, Silvia meets F.B.I. Agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn), who initially sees Silvia as a threat, but quickly comprehends that there is more to this story than she's letting on. Fearful for her own life, yet reluctant to give Keller all the facts, Silvia finds herself in a hurricane of intrigue as the days count down to the dignitary's volatile appearance.  As Keller gets closer and closer to the truth behind Silvia's estranged past and the essence of her involvement in the U.N., he must also determine the best course of action to keep Silvia alive and ensure the safety of the United Nations all at once.

Kidman has one of the best opportunities in her distinguished career to shine; shifting from being a possessed, driven woman who wants to ensure the safety of the U.N. and a paranoid schizophrenic whose prime concern is her own personal wellbeing.  Sean Penn, on the other hand, plays a Keller a man suffering from insomnia. He gives a mannered reading to this man that can't accept what fate has dealt him and appears to be sleep walking in most of his scenes. While being not one of Penn's most felicitous appearances in front of the camera, one wonders if it was because of problems with the director, or just a lapse in Mr. Pollack's judgment about this character.  The international cast put together responds well to the director. One casualty is the enormously talented Catherine Keener, who has little to do. Jesper Christensen, Yvan Attal, Earl Cameron and George Harris are seen in minor roles.  Pollack has always constructed films beautifully and ""The Interpreter"" is no exception; however, the film lags frequently and the innuendo between Silvia and Keller seems fairly redundant and below the standard of such a fine director.  A good, yet not great film from a director the film industry is glad to have back on board.",1135728000,,3163,5.138401559454191
1525177,2,B00005JNQA,"My suspicion that this film was mainly a ""rah rah"" piece for the U.N. is shared by several of my fellow reviewers.  I hope that is the case so any who put work into ""The Interpreter"" can say they at least accomplished something.  A really good spy thriller will maintain a nagging sense in the back of your mind that there is something amiss but keeps the action coming so you won't have an idle moment to ponder it.  At the very end, the final piece of the puzzle will drop into place just in time to roll credits.

In this movie, that nagging detail is so glaringly obvious that a non-stop chase scene couldn't mask it and there are no chase scenes in this movie worthy of the name.  Staggering coincidences are required every few minutes to keep the plot moving.  When the details of the nefarious conspiracy are revealed, the viewer is left thinking ""really, that's it?

So, I'm wondering around the Video Store and see a DVD cover with SEAN PENN and NICOLE KIDMAN starring in a Sydney Pollack film. There is no hesitation.

To be honest I'm not the biggest Kidman fan around... not sure why but just find her a little too plastic somtimes. This film changed all that...

A subject matter close to my heart living in Africa only a few thousand kilometres away from Zimbabwe. This film struck a few cords / mirror images.

Filled with Political Intrigue : It follows the story of a once loved / now despised African Leader responsible for Genocide in his country. Coming to the UN to defend his actions with a ""Please Help - Know Nothing - Denial"" attitude!!! An INTERPRETER hears a planned assassination discussion for this leader in a language that she and only another ""handful"" of people in the world can actually speak!!! Now, can she get anyone to believe her? Enter "" Twists, Turns and New Discoveries"" that may end up placing her as a Suspect rather than Witness!!!

Filmed entirely at the UN BUILDING!!! A feat never tried before... even footage from the actual General Assembly. Sean Penn is phenomenal (as always) and Kidman truly superb.

Look out for a cameo from Pollack.

This film will have you on the edge of your seat.

SUPERB THRILLER... A must see!!!",1133740800,5,1337,4.659574468085107
1525222,3,B00005JNQA,"From Smother Magazine smother.net:

Staring Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn, ""The Interpreter"" is a high suspense drama that also shows American audiences how corrupt African nations are. With the genocide in Sudan, any film that brings attention to this is important. Lucky for us, the movie is really good too. With twists and turns, the movie follows a UN interpreter skillfully played by Nicole Kidman after she overhears two men talking about assassinating an African nation's corrupt leader (they used a fake country's name for some reason). Sean Penn is the US Secret Service agent that's assigned to not only watch and investigate her but also to prevent the assassination. The script was well-written and the acting was superb.

I had high hopes for this film and only gave it 2 stars because of Nicole Kidman.

The story plods along SLOWLY and PAINFULLY with no tension, no anxiety.... in fact, you don't care for any of the characters in the least.

This feels like on of those 70s films like ""All the Presidents Men"" that simply puts you to sleep.

Lost of talk and attempts at creating a storyline about attempting to stop the supposed assassination of some tyrannical leader of a 3rd world country.

It's hard to care to much if he gets knocked off or not.

Penn and Kidman's characters seem stilted and stiff.

Simply put...... the film has ZERO suspense, ZERO tension, and stirs ZERO interest for the characters.

It simply does not come together and WORK like a good ""magical movie"" like Shawshenk Redemption, Door to Door, Straight Story or other great non-action movies do.

1525224,3,B00005JNQA,"The movie neither stalls, nor leaps ahead.

The major problems with this movie are that the characters are totally one dimensional and the plot is absurd.

You are transported to a world where the UN is not the author of child rapes, food for oil scandals, and a general fund for 3rd world dictators as is well known to everyone.

Instead in this fictional world we are treated to an opening where France wanes eloquent about moral issues confronting the not so free world which it created and continues to propogate, the US is of course and at a best an uncaring bully, and the UN is the hope for all oppressed people everywhere.

This movie is really nothing more than another trip for Sean Penn to Iraq, but this time he gets to make full use of hollywierds revionist story telling skills.

At the end of the film I was fairly bored and completely unsurprised and unimpressed as usual with the typical drivel these left leaning pedantic preofessional underachievers seem to churn out these days.",1133136000,3,998,4.6477272727272725

Finally, until one explosive moment there is no action to speak of. I actually fell asleep during the movie and had to be awakened because my snoring was louder than the vapid dialogue.

If I were Sean Penn I would be embarrassed - he is truly a good actor who probably was too awestruck by the usually great Sydney Pollack to complain. Nicole Kidman - sorry but I can't see you in this role. You are not weathered enough.

Plot has so many holes and unbelievable sequences. How can a single person be allowed to float around the UN building during at any time of the day and end up overhearing news that will shake the world ... in a rare language no less? Come on!!!

And I was pleasantly surprised watching it as I wanted the film to last as long as possible - I was enjoying it that much. I liked every scene, every dialogue (they all were brilliant and very living), every line.
This is one of the best political thrillers I've ever seen but there were something more to the film so I can say it's not just a thriller. It's a very tender and sensitive story about two life-beaten persons who are trying to cope with life's difficulties and find love maybe. We can't speak definately about love here, because everything remained rather hazy in the picture, but I found a lot of love there - much more than in any regular love story. Kidman and Penn were so convincing in their roles, and Sydney Pollack executed such an elaborate and delicate directing, so that for me this is one of the most truthful movies about love between two people, although there are no love scenes and even no kisses. It's so rare these days we get a chance to see something really worthy like this. It's the exact case when we can say for sure that the film was done by real professionals.

We never really do understand the Kidman character .. is she a sweet innocent, NO is she a freedom fighter, NO is she a loyal UN employee No ... what in the world was she supposed to be .... she turns out to be just a prickly porcupine type character ....

1525228,4,B00005JNQA,"Two of Hollywood's biggest names, Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman, and a highly respected director, Sidney Pollack, come together for the exciting and intelligent thriller, `The Interpreter'.

Nicole Kidman stars as Silvia Broome, a UN interpreter who, upon returning late one night to collect some belongings, overhears a threat to the life of the controversial leader of her African country. The catch is, it was in a dialect that only she and a handful of others speak. Then comes Tobin Keller, the Federal agent sent both to protect her and investigate her claims. With her political background and the uncommon dialect of the threats, however, Keller is sceptical of whether she is really telling the truth. The story unfolds, with threats to Silvia's life and the arrival of the political head in question, and finishes with a twist you won't see coming.

Kidman and Penn are solid in their leading roles, and Catherine Keener gives a great performance as Keller's sarcastic (and undershown) assistant. Whilst Silvia is a complex and at times uncertain character, Tobin Keller comes across as the stereotypical overworking Agent with family problems. Fortunately, however, Sean Penn manages to still make this role interesting. The plot, though at times a little hard to follow, is clever and will keep you guessing and surprised at the turns the film takes. The other remarkable aspect of the film is that it is the first (and as yet only) time that filming has been permitted in the majestic UN headquarters. This not only adds to the realism of the movie, but is a magnificent setting to watch the events unfold in.

The DVD also features several notable bonus features. There is an alternative ending to the film as well as trailers and deleted scenes. Then there are a number of segments featuring interviews with some members of the cast and the director, Sidney Pollack. Firstly there is a feature on the making of films by Pollack, showing behind the scenes of the director at work. A segment on the United Nations building shows the rooms of the great building both through shots from the film and other footage, and also provides information on the UN and the filming of the movie in the headquarters. This makes for interesting viewing and is one of the best of the bonus features. The other standout feature is one on the vocation of actual interpreters. This features interviews with some UN interpreters and also the Pollack and Nicole Kidman. As well as these, there is an audio commentary for the film done by Pollack and the director talks in a segment about the choice of film format for his movies.

`The Interpreter', though at times difficult to follow, is an excellent film, featuring some of Hollywood's most popular and skilled actors and director. Though not perfect, this is a thoroughly enjoyable thriller that I recommend seeing.",1132531200,2,2859,4.925311203319502
1525229,1,B00005JNQA,"It takes itself a bit too seriously.  The casting is far stretched also.  A silly piece of work.

Halle Berry would have been perfect in the role of Sylvia, but Nicole Kidman?  She is supposedly African, with an African lover, and in all the photographs within the movie and among all the other people shown as her countrymen in the USA, she is the only one who is not black.

There is no credibility on any count, whether the casting or the very, very weak story.  Neither are the views of Manhattan, particularly in the last scene where it looks like a pastel backdrop rather than a view of the east side of the island.

1525271,3,B00005JNQA,"Nicole Kidman plays an interpreter for the United Nations who accidentally overhears a conversation she thinks is linked to a possible assassination plot.  Sean Penn is the Secret Service agent assigned to investigate and/or protect her - it's never completely clear.  The movie holds together well for about the first hour, beginning with a tense scene set in Africa.  Gradually, we learn about Kidman and Penn's characters.  Penn is initially skeptical of Kidman's claims, which adds some nice tension.  However, the plot shifts dramatically during a confusing bus ride, and the movie's believability subsequently went out the window for me.  The script for ""The Interpreter"" reeks of doctoring - indeed Scott Zallian (Schindler's List) and others were supposedly brought in for re-writes.

A major problem aside from the muddled plot is that Nicole Kidman's character is quite remote.  It's hard to sympathize with her when you never have any idea what she's thinking or feelings.  In this respect, her work and character here reminded me of her movie released just prior, the dismal ""Birth.""  Penn is solid in his role, but he's certainly had more to work with in other recent films (Mystic River, 21 Grams).  Unfortunately, the brilliant Catherine Keener is wasted in yet another movie.  Her role is generic, and there seems to be no rhyme or reason for when she appears.  She seems to be Sean Penn's partner, but then he seems to work alone quote a bit.  Anyway, she's sadly wasted here.

""The Interpreter"" made a bit of press as the first major release filmed at the United Nations.  This setting does help with a few scenes, particularly those featuring the General Assembly.  However, many of the U.N. scenes consist of stairwells or small offices, even a bathroom.  The overall effect is probably not worth the hassle, as Sidney Pollack reportedly had to fight voraciously for permission to film there.  Speaking of Pollack, ""The Interpreter"" is only his second film in the last decade, following the bomb, ""Random Hearts.""  Pollack was one of the most talented directors working from the late 60s (The Shoot Horses, Don't They?) through the mid-80s (Out of Africa), so it's somewhat perturbing to see him floundering with a mediocre thriller.  He has even contributed to this genre previously with the far superior ""Three Days of the Condor"" (1975); even ""The Firm"" (1993) is arguably better.

In sum, ""The Interpreter"" is a decent thriller and time-filler, although it is rather old-fashioned in its storytelling and pacing.  In that respect, it has the feel of a 1970s thriller, although a weak one at that.  Extras include an unremarkable alternate ending and a very sedate director's commentary from Sidney Pollack.",1130716800,23,2730,5.069506726457399

Sydney Pollack is a very intelligent individual, but here he lost his head once he realized he could film inside the UN.

The direction is boring and predictable: most of if is composed of shots of Kidman and counter-shots of Sean Penn, with some intrusions from secondary characters and set-pieces which don't help to sustain our already ripped net of suspense of disbelief.  Politically inept (cinematically and dramatically it doesn't fare better), the film tries to convince us that those who fight against corruption become corrupted once in government without any external help doing so.  It seems here that African people is naturally ineffectual in establishing a secure government for themselves.  Does the West have something to do with that?  Can an armed revolution establish a better government (than before) for the people?  I have some examples at hand, and those contradict whatever false pacifism Pollack is trying to get home.  When romantic music arises in one of infinite personal encounters between the interpreter and the secret agent that ""investigates"" her (did I mentioned that the agent recently ""lost"" his wife?), the worst of Hollywood takes command and remembers you that some people in some place think that you're so stupid that you will pay for their inflated wages and stock-options from the entertainment industry.

1525277,2,B00005JNQA,"This movie reminded me of another clunker, ""Proof of Life"".  Much like that film, here we have two popular actors (it had Russell Crowe and Meg Ryan) with good acting skills who find themselves with no real material to work with.  This movie is much more predictable than that one, and is very improbable.  While ""The Interpreter"" has some action, most of it will leave you yelling at the characters on the screen to do the obvious thing, but they never do.

The movie has Sean Penn as a grieving agent while Nicole Kidman is an interpreter who overhears part of an assassination plot.  When she brings this to the authorities, Sean Penn doesn't believe her and tells her why her story is completely improbable.  This is the most realistic part of the film.  Unfortunately, the film makers never explain the holes in the script made obvious by Sean's character. Then he later decides to completely believe her, even though she keeps lying to him and he keeps finding out more about her throughout the movie.  Yet, he only believes her more and more; it gets ridiculous.  Sean Penn is a very talented actor, so I'm sure if we listen carefully we can hear him punching his agent in the face repeatedly for getting him this gig.

Although you find yourself liking Sean Penn's character a little, Nicole Kidman's character is very unlikable.

1525279,4,B00005JNQA,"""The Interpreter"" has the distinction of being the first commercial movie to be filmed inside the United Nations building in New York City. The UN Charter prohibits commercial use of the building, but director Sydney Pollack was able to get permission to film from UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on the grounds that the film's themes support the UN mission. It helps that ""The Interpreter"" was able to film on location inside the UN, as that building's huge open spaces and natural light improve the film's aesthetics considerably and would have been impossible to recreate. The premise is that Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman), a simultaneous interpreter at the UN, overhears a conversation about an attempt on the life of Edmond Zuwanie (Earl Cameron), President of the fictional African nation of Matobo, who is scheduled to give a speech before the General Assembly. Secret Service Agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) of the Dignitary Protection Squad, and his partner Agent Woods (Catherine Keener), are assigned to protect Zuwanie and to investigate Silvia's claim. Even when it becomes clear that her life is threatened, Silvia's politics concerning Zuwanie and her involvement in the drama are still suspect.

Silvia Broome and Tobin Keller are not what I'd call well-written characters, but Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn give them more weight than lesser actors would. Silvia has a bizarre, unidentifiable accent. The character has one British and one white African parent. A South African accent would seem appropriate, but that's not what she has. The Matoban language ""Ku"", which Silvia translates, was created for the film at the South African Language Institute in London. It is a cross between Swahili, commonly spoken in East Africa, and Shona, a language of Southwestern Africa. ""The Interpreter"" is a suspense/thriller, so what the characters and audience don't know is what makes it work. Edmond Zuwanie's enemies may want him dead, but his supporters also want to prevent his speech at the UN, so it's anybody's guess which camp the assassin might come from. Silvia Broome is far from disinterested in the politics of Matobo, her home nation, but is she acting on her interests or her ideals? Those are the questions that keep everyone guessing. ""The Interpreter"" isn't a great thriller. It didn't have a script -or rather, the script was written as they were shooting, and it shows. But if you're looking for a reasonably entertaining film featuring talented stars, ""The Interpreter"" fills the bill. 3  stars.

The DVD (Universal 2005): Bonus features include a less probable Alternate Ending (3 minutes), 3 deleted scenes (2 minutes), 4 featurettes, and an audio commentary. In ""Sydney Pollack at Work: From Concept to Cutting Room"" (10 minutes), the director talks about what he likes about directing, the challenges of filmmaking, and shooting this film without a script. ""Interpreting Pan & Scan vs. Widescreen"" (5 minutes) is Pollack's explanation of why he objects to pan and scan. ""The Interpreter"" is the first film Pollack has shot in wide screen in a long time, as he felt compelled to shoot in full screen format because his movies were being panned and scanned for television and video. ""The Ultimate Movie Set: The United Nations"" (8 minutes) talks about shooting inside the UN building. ""A Day in the Life of Real Interpreters"" (8 minutes) is an interesting look at the challenges of simultaneous interpretation, explained by Diana Liao, Chief of the Interpretation Service at the UN, and Brigitte Andreassier-Pearl, Chief of the French section of the Interpretation Service at the UN. The audio commentary by director Sydney Pollack is sporadic, with long lulls, but it is interesting. Pollack discusses the intention of the scenes on which he comments, what he added after shooting and took out in editing and why, story, locations, and some technical challenges.

Nicole Kidman plays the mysterious interpreter Silvia Broome, a woman with a very mysterious past, though throughout the movie the viewer is never sure just how mysterious.  Kidman is perfect for this part.  She seems just as mysterious in real life, so this role did not require a whole lot of character change.  Still, she makes her character come to life on the big screen.

Sean Penn plays a Secret Service agent assigned to investigate (and later on, protect) Kidman's character.  He doesn't deserve an Academy Award or anything, but he pulls off the job quite well.  Sean Penn is just a fun actor to watch.  I don't think he copies anyone else's style.  He is unique in his approach to his craft.

I don't want to giveaway the plot of this film, so I will just say that there are a few turns and twist that keep the viewer guessing.  The rest of the cast, the directing, and the filming are all topnotch and enjoyable.

However, the entire line of the story having to do with the interpreter, played by Nicole Kidman, does not make any sense.

Assuming the bad guys could set her up to overhear the conversation, what would have happened had she reached Pierre and found out her brother was indeed already dead, ergo he could not have anything to do with the plot?  Would she take the issue further?  Why would she ... where was her motive?

Even if you buy into all the improbabilities to do with the interpreter, why would the Secret Service make her a target of investigation?

Also, and the capper for me, why would the dictator's henchmen want to kill her ... or, in the alternative, assume they wanted to kill her, why get into her apartment, steal a ceremonial mask, and then stand on the fire escape to scare her???  Why?",1129420800,2,965,4.575581395348837

Nicole Kidman gives a glowing performance as always as a UN interpreter who overhears the assassination plot for a visiting African dignitary.  Sean Penn is the SS agent haunted by the recent death of his estranged wife, and the agent who handles Kidman's accusations.  Catherine Keenar is wasted as Penn's partner, a cardboard character whose presence is nominal to say the least.  Director Sydney Pollack turns up in a cameo as Penn's hardnosed boss, but his direction is certainly not Oscar caliber.

1525318,2,B00005JNQA,"Having heard such a buzz about 'The Interpreter' I couldn't wait for the movie to be out on DVD and got it reserved at the local video store on the day of the release.

Unfortunately, my intense curiosity and interest waned very quickly. Having heard nothing but great things about the film, I expected to be thrilled. Instead, this fatally flawed movie simply dragged on - aimless, blind, and totally handicapped by a ridiculous, and sometimes desultory script, leading to an almost embarrassing denouement.

Catherine Keener is completely wasted [talent not alcohol, ha ha], and I'd use the same terms for Kidman and Penn as well. Notwithstanding her family's horrible fate at the hands of Zuwanie, it was pretty difficult to sympathize/empathize with her character. In 'Dogville' you'd have rooted for her despite her cruel decision at the end, but here, despite the constant victimization, your heart feels exactly 0 lbs heavier. To make things worse, there is zero chemistry between the leads - although I do feel they could have explored Penn and Keener a bit more; and simply no glue left to hold the script together once the final act began.

You could almost feel yourself begging the writer not to swamp things even more toward the ending - luckily the alternative ending was a disaster while the original one just about managed to hold on to the last shred/thread of believability.

I can understand that some people are enamored of the film and the acting - after all, there are OSCAR winners on board - but I fail to see how overall I'd give this dud anything more than 2 stars. In fact, the presence of OSCAR winners raises expectations to a very high level.

The plot holes are big enough for an 18-wheeler to make a u-turn through, and some unbelievable scenes [Kidman's brother saying ""It's OK"" right before dying after getting shot - laughable; and the bus scene is ludicrous for its depiction of otherwise highly intelligent Secret Service operatives] only served to lower the credibility and likeability of the script further.

In summary, while Kidman and Penn have performed admirably, it's really difficult to say a great many good things about the movie itself.

On the plus side, the music was excellent and totally non-intrusive [Take that, Jerry Goldsmith!] and the cinematography was splendid, capturing the essence of the locations.

On the minus side, the script was terrible, detached; the pace pathetic, and the twists most unbelievable.

See if only if you have nothing better to do...and yes, no flames from fans, please :-)

1525319,4,B00005JNQA,"Pollack is a wonderful director, isn't he? I enjoy his body of work immensely and the Three Days of the Condor film, now 30 + years old, remains in the top 3 or 4 of the 'Hitchcockian character up against the evil empire' movies. And the evil empire ain't the Russians!

I don't think the Interpreter compares favorably to Condor, for argument's sake, and while Kidman and Penn surely hold their own against Dunnaway and Redford, I think the script was if not weak, confused.

First of all, that these two characters, Silvia the interpreter (Kidman) and Keller the Secret Service Agent (Penn) are damaged goods make them so much more interesting. They are superior actors and they strut their stuff well. And that Pollack doesn't take the easy way out and get them into bed shows great retstraint and a powerful sense of human caring as opposed to that other thing.

But she was an armed rebel in a foreign country. Her family was murdered by one of the member nations of the United Nations. Do we really think she's going to get a job passing extraordinary scrutiny to be within reaching distance of the 191 most important people in the world?

And he's married to a (and I certainly don't mean to denigrate the profession) a stripper, I believe, who finds other men, has passionate affairs with them, leaves Sean and then comes back. Time after time. Over and over. This time, 10-14 days ago, she's in a drunken accident and dies. Now Sean Penn (Tobin Keller) is the guy who guards the President. Do we think he can pass a High School psychological test much less one for the Secret Service?

So ill fated people meeting eachother is a good start to a good mystery - thriller. It's just hard to believe it's going to happen in the UN.

Kidman gets more beautiful and gifted with each film. Sean Penn is everything Deniro and Pacino had 30 years ago. The guy is great. The two of them carry the movie gratefully beyond the limits of the script. Pollack's film direction is always good. It just seemed as though the movie was in place before the decision was made as to where they wanted the script to take them. 4 stars. Larry Scantlebury",1128384000,5,2139,4.542857142857143

Unfortunately its the script that ultimately sours this political thriller.  It becomes quite obvious soon into the film ""who"" the bad ""guys"" are with simple deductive reasoning.  Pollack had a choice of either cluing we the viewers in on who the enemy is or instead keep it a mystery until the films climax. Sadly he chooses the latter. Instead of watching the bad guys plotting their next move Pollack decides to make us guess.  We've all seen enough of these movies to guess pretty much right all though this film.

1525364,4,B00005JNQA,"I was riveted by the performances of Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn in Sydney Pollack's ""The Interpreter"".  As the film unfolds, both of their bleak outlooks on life - his worn on his sleeve, hers hidden beneath the steel resolve of a life that is acetic, on the surface - meet to dance a little with each other, and Pollack, wisely, does not pursue romance, just leaves the watcher believing that the two of them will remember each other for the rest of their lives.

 Penn's character, Tobin Keller, is with the Secret Service.  He has recently lost a wife, in more ways than one.  Sylvia Broome (Kidman) has lost a brother.  You see him die in the opening scenes, but don't know he's her brother until much later in the film.  Both are reserved and steely in their resolve.  Their mistrust and wonderment about each other is cloaked in elegance.

The setting is the United Nations, and Pollack filmed much of the movie there, a first.  His cinematography (by Darius Khondji) makes you intimate with the UN, it is crisp and alive.  Sylvia is an interpreter there, one of few who can speak Ku, the primary language of the African country, Matobo.  (Matobo is fictional).  Some of the political heat that Pollack has taken about the film is in the ""fictionalization"" of Matobo.  In character and events, there is much that is reminiscent of real life African countries; Pollack has merely given us a hodge podge of likely events.

Broome's knowledge of the language allows her to overhear a threat against Matobo's dictator, who is to visit the UN.  The threat is brought through channels, and the wheels of security begin to invade Sylvia's and the UN's existence.  Assassination of Zuwanie (Earl Cameron) would be devastating for the world opinion of the UN, and cause even more instability in his little corner of the world.

In tense sequences, the drama plays out with the UN backdrop; the most exciting scenes taking place with a potential bomb on a bus - here Pollack shifts incessantly between the bus and the security forces who track and follow it from various venues in the city.  There's also a remarkable scene for Penn when he finds, without really seeing, an assassin in Sylvia's apartment.

It becomes obvious that Sylvia is no innocent bystander, that she has an agenda, that unlikely as she seems, she is an activist; is she, in part responsible for the threat?  Tobin Keller does not really know, he just begins to trust his instincts about her.  As the film moves rapidly (it is a long film, but the time seems to go swiftly) to the end, the filmgoer realizes that he/she's been caught up in the performances strung together with some well-filmed action sequences, but that the message that Pollack was trying to convey got a little lost, and dragged its feet.  As such, the time spent viewing it is well spent, but, as you reflect on the film, you're not certain it will have a lasting affect on you.

Some points that need to be brought up - Catherine Keener is a welcome presence as Tobin's partner.  She's dynamite in what is little more than a cameo.  And the DVD has some excellent extras, notably:  A Day in the Life of Real Interpreters, and a feature on the use of the UN for filming, The Ultimate Movie Set:  The United Nations (I was less enthusiastic about the features I normally like, an alternate ending, the deleted scenes...good thing they were deleted... and scenes of Sydney Pollack at work at the set).

This is a film that should be watched for its context, particularly in light of where we are and where we are not in the world today; a film that should be appreciated for its nuance - but the action sequences will be more attractive and it is the disconnect between the film's intellectual value and the action that is bothersome.  This coupling was done far better in ""Hotel Rwanda"", for one.

See it, but rent it.",1128211200,5,3857,4.627941176470588
1525365,3,B00005JNQA,"I was always brought up with the adage ""if you cannot say something positive do not say anything"" so here is my fors and against on this movie.

Plus, Kidman and Penn are excellent in their chosen roles. Also it is good to see what all the money is being paid for in keeping the UN open.

Minuses. It is a pretty incredulous plot. Someone who works in the UN can come and go without any evidence of their ever being there?  Thirty years ago someone of my acquaintance worked in Harrods in London where they worked on trust and where there was no such thing as a timeclock. The IRA bombed the store and the lack of accounting led to intensive searches for people who purportedly were at work but who had, instead, played hookey. They were found which reduced the death toll and the number of persons, missing, presumed killed, and timeclocks were introduced. Given the focus on the UN it is inconceivable that there were no records. Ditto for being able to leave personal belongings in an interpreters booth, in full view of the General Assembly podium. Never in a million years.

No mention of diplomatic immunity anywhere and yet the Secret Service can come and go at will apparently in a foreign embassy without challenge or fear or favour. I do not think so. Foreign diplomats, accompanied by US agents but able to carry a weapon. Hmmm.

The interviewing of a foreign national in their own residence by a person of the opposiite sex without a female officer present. No I do not think so either.

Published details of an exiled opposition leader's preferred bus route. Really.

An interpreter who can steal into the UN building, stay there all night without detection then be next to a head of state in a room with no security personnel, that is  more than a stretch.

The most incredulous thing to me is the visit of two secret service officials to the home of a person of interest in search of that person. A chap answers the door but apparently has no english. The agents leave him a card but make no attempt to have him accompany them or call in the services of an interpreter, nor do they follow up. Not very likely is it?

There are some poignant moments in this movie which deserve attention. Firstly the portrayal of the use of young boys as killers in Africa to commit murder against undesirables. This is quite commonplace in the horror of the conflicts going on in Africa and it is a facet which up  till now has received scant attention of much of the media to this appalling abuse.  We should be grateful, despite the norror of the notion, to this exposure of the problem.

Mind you, the likelihood of the directors of the killings showing up with a government car and a military escort is pretty slim.

Secondly the whole notion of the homemade bomb factory albeit it with high explosive bought from your local friendly arms dealer, is one which should send a chill down our spines. The hard truth is that it remains relatively easy to purchase the ingredients for homemade bombs in the US and our concern with personal privacy and constitutional rights should not blind us to the fact that we do not know what our neighbours are up to and we cannot always assume the best.

Lastly the scene on the bus where the assassin leave the package, which goes unnoticed until it is too late shows how relatively easy it is to carry out such attacks. If we have not learnt through movies such as Blow Up and this one that we must be vigilant at all times, every waking minute of the day, then we must wonder what else must be done to shake us out of our complacency.

This may not be the best movie in the world. In fact, in my view, it isn't.

BUT

There are important lessons to be learned from it.

Firstly the reality that this is an interdependent world and what we do is impacted by others.

Secondly, it is easy to get caught up in someone else's quarrels which can do us serious harm.

Thirdly, we should always and everywhere be on our guard.",1128211200,7,3959,4.455678670360111

1525442,3,B00005JNQA,"""The interpreter"", directed by Sydney Pollack, is a thriller that deals with a plot to kill Zuwanie (Earl Cameron), the dictator of Motobo (a fictional African country) in front of the United Nations' General Assembly. The pace is quick, the general premise interesting, and the actors excellent, but in the end the movie is just good, not great.

The main character is Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman), an interpreter working for the United Nations, who lived a long time in Motobo. One day, Silvia returns to the interpreters' booth in order collect some things she forgot, and by chance hears some conspirators whispering in Ku (the language of Motobo) about a plan to kill Zuwanie. Unfortunately for Silvia, they see her, but she manages to escape. The following day, Silvia goes to the police to tell them what she heard. The problem is, they are not totally sure they believe her. And as events develop, one of the officers in charge of protecting visiting dignitaries, a very troubled Tobin Keller (Sean Penn), begins to suspects that Silvia has more reasons that anyone else to kill Zuwabi. In the end, it is difficult to know who is lying, and why.

The ending is somewhat surprising, but it feels a little contrived. Also, there are hints throughout the movie of an emotional connections of sorts forming between Silvia and Tobin, but nothings gets round to happening, and some spectators will end up saying aloud ""Is that all?"" at the end of the movie. At least, that is what happened to me.

Notwithstanding that, I would like to point that I specially enjoyed two of the extra features included in the dvd, ""The Ultimate Movie Set: The United Nations"" and ""A Day in the Life of Real Interpreters"". My favorite was the first one, in which the director and part of the crew talk about the process of gaining permission to shoot in the building, and what it meant for them to get it, turning ""The interpreter"" into the first film to be shot inside the United Nations Headquarters. That feature also shows extra shoots of the building, the General Assembly and the room where the public sessions of the Security Council are held (depending on the issue, there are also private meetings not open to the public).

On the whole, and despite the excellent acting, I think that this movie was no more than adequate. Truth to be told, the thing I'll probably remember more about ""The interpreter"" is its set, that is, the United Nations' building. But... I believe that something is wrong with a film when the most noteworthy feature is the setting.

There are so many analogies with many nations in the world pitifully, but this compelling film focuses about not only the gradual process of political puzzle, but its inner and even outer consequences; that's the case in Silvia Brome who has lived the hell before her eyes, and tries by all means to guarantee the peace and the justice in her beloved country.

1525444,3,B00005JNQA,"Sydney Pollack presents us with a political thriller that is reminiscent of his films that he has graced us with in the past and which all shared one common thread. The personal struggle that leads to the catharsis whether or not the resolution (catharsis) of the political situation is achieved.

The film involves an assassination plot of a African country leader that is accidentally overheard by Silvia Broome, a U.N. interpreter portrayed by Nicole Kidman and the investigation that is carried by Tobin Keller, a Secret Service agent portrayed by Sean Penn.

Personal issues are uncovered throughout the process of the investigation hence the plot pleasantly thickens to a believable level without going overboard. Any, few to mention, predictable outcomes, are overshadowed by the lead performances that convey under toned emotions and maturely balanced issues; issues that would be too vague if one had to carry within and too melodramatic if one had to extend through outbursts of speaking their minds out loud.

Take note of the performances that are carried many times through facial expressions when any single word would be considered overacting.

One point that becomes a fashion in most of the Sydney Pollack films is that even though there is a resolution of personal issues, the people involved, the two lead characters separate their ways, either for ""good"" or for a ""good period"" of time.

In the first case the viewer is left at the end with the notion that there is no possibility that the two characters will cross paths. In the latter case the viewer is left at the end of the film with the notion that some further psychological mending needs to take place and then the two characters may take it from there.",1121644800,3,1731,4.955172413793103
1525445,4,B00005JNQA,"Despite mixed reviews, I wanted to see THE INTERPRETER as soon as I discovered the United Nations had actually allowed director Sydney Pollack unprecedented permission to film on location in the U.N. Building.  Just seeing the inside of the U.N. Building for the first time since I moved from NYC would have made the film worth the price of admission for me, so I was pleasantly surprised when this story of a South African interpreter (Nicole Kidman) embroiled in an assassination plot when she overhears the wrong thing at the wrong time turned out to be a suspenseful, thought-provoking, character-driven thriller that builds up a nice head of paranoia.  THE INTERPRETER's drama is primarily of the cerebral kind, almost a throwback to 1970s thrillers like THE PARALLAX VIEW and Pollack's own THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR, which is not to say there aren't some suspenseful chases and set pieces.  The jewel in its crown is a nail-bitingly tense sequence on a Brooklyn bus that recalls Alfred Hitchcock's SABOTAGE, even if it *did* beg the question of why an expatriate African political figure (LAYER CAKE's George Harris) involved in hot-button issues would let himself be seen going on a city bus as part of his daily routine, as seen in a newspaper in the film...but I digress... I suspect that most of the negative reviews I'd heard came from folks who resent actually being asked to pay attention to dialogue instead of waiting for stuff to blow up real good.  It was refreshing to see the evolution of the relationship between our heroine and the troubled, all-too-recently widowed Secret Service agent (Sean Penn, reminiscent of a young Marlon Brando here) who's assigned to protect her, their initial wariness thawing into a tender friendship without the pair actually tumbling into bed together.  I've always found Penn a hard actor to warm up to, but Kidman's sympathetic presence has a good effect on him; the two work well together.  I also liked that our heroine, who after all makes her living choosing words carefully, has many fascinating lines about the meaning of words and the nuances of language (one of my favorites:  ""If I interpreted `dead' as `gone,' I'd be out of a job.  `Dead' and `gone' are two different things."")  As Penn's fellow agent, Catherine Keener gets some choice dialogue, too; a scene-stealer in her offhanded way, she's like the Eve Arden of the Secret Service.  If you're in the mood for an intelligent thriller concerned with issues and not just a rollercoaster ride on a movie screen, and filmed in ever-photogenic NYC to boot, THE INTERPRETER is very much worth seeing and hearing. I'm looking forward to getting ahold of the DVD this fall. (For what it's worth, my husband wondered why they didn't cast native South African Charlize Theron in the title role.  I figured it was because she was busy making AEON FLUX, and besides, the role would be a bigger stretch for Nicole Kidman than for someone who already had a South African accent! :-)",1121558400,,2987,4.871794871794871
1525446,3,B00005JNQA,"'The Interpreter' has strong cast, slick direction, and authentic mood (the film being pastly shot in the real United Nations building).  If the film had been shot in the 70s, the incredible story (and especially its ending) might have sounded more plausible.  As it is, with today's more complex political situations surrounding the UN, 'The Interpreter' remains just an OK thriller -- entertaining, but ultimately unbelievable.

Of course, you don't have to make everything believable in thrillers, but I point out this obvious thing about reality because 'The Interpreter' starts with an excellent premise.  While in a booth in the UN Headquarter in New York, an  interpreter Silvia Bloom (Nicole Kidman) happens to overhear part of conversation (in one African fictional language Ku), which strongly suggest that one assassination plot is going on.  And that assassination, as she learns later, might happen here, in the UN.

Consequently, security agent Tobin Keller is called in, who at first does not buy her story.  However, as the story unfolds, several incidents happen to Silvia, and Tobin starts to guard her with his men, thinking that there is a possiblity that she is still lying to him, or to us audiences.

You get two superstars -- Nicole Kidman as UN translator, and Sean Penn as security guard.  Both do not disappoint us, but I must say there is no chemstry between them.  As the film is basically a thriller, well, I can ignore that flaw, but not this one, which is the film's too complicated and incredible story about assassnation.

Think about this.  If you're a president of some country, and is being accused of tyranny (I hope you're not!), would you come all the way to New York City where most likely you will not be welcomed?  And when you might be assassinated?  His motive is explained in the end, which -- excuse me for using strong words, but ... which is an insult to our intelligence.  And Nicole Kidman's character, at first a pretty credible one, gradually becomes awfully contrived and even ridiculous (sorry I cannot revela that part).  Do you believe all of her 'past'?

Despite the great cast including Catherine Keener, Yvan Attal, Jesper Christensen, Earl Cameron, George Harris, Hugo Speer, Clyde Kusatsu, and Michael Wright, their characters are all pieces of a big puzzle, which is not uninteresting itself, and considering the complexity of the material, Sydney Pollack did a superb job with his slick direction (as in seen in 'The Firm'), but all in all I was not intrigued by the whole film, of which politics are outmoded, and even silly in this post 9/11 world.  Good acting, lots of suspence, not-so-good story.",1120176000,3,2665,4.934977578475336

There is a plot, there is character development, there is suspense. Then there is New York City, swooping helicopter panoramic scenes of the UN complex along the river, and there are subdued scenes inside those buildings, from metal detectors to removing a cut circle of class from an enormous window. N.Kidman is dressed down the whole movie, in only a few places can her natural beauty shine through the fruminess, S.Pean is older, more chiseled face then i remember, the other cop a lady is entirely forgetable.

Everything is sacrificed to the continuity and slow step by step incrementalness of the action. You are aware that some details are left out so that you really know more than you think you do, that information is flowing from several directions at varying speeds, all designed to suck you up into the action and make you only aware of it. This makes the director and the writers key, and they are good, the plot doesn't lack for believability (looks like it is about Mugabe and Zimbabwe), casting such a blonde pale  thin woman like Kidman as an African is excellent, the plot is sharpened and the irony heightened vs using a black women in the part. i'm sure it was controversial, it was a good choice.

You can think about the politics, about the brutality of black on black violence that has been the news in Africa for 75(?) years but the movie doesn't push it, nor does it preach strongly, it uses it. What it ends up with, in contrast to where the action takes place (the UN) is a mild this is a human problem that needs to be solved by all of humanity, not a black African one. The street scenes of NYCity add to the conviction that different people can live together, maybe, kindof, well hopefully.

I liked the movie, i didn't have the usual nagging regrets, it completely pulled me into it, the only problem is that S.Penn has such a history and such a past profile that i was never quite able to forgot that it was an actor playing a part.

I would have appreciated more African music in the background, the end was spectacular and i wanted more. I would have appreciated more early information about who the two men where in the beginning but i realize now that it was a deliberate technic to heighten the suspension",1119916800,,2289,4.530266343825666

1525449,5,B00005JNQA,"Non-stop suspense is the order with Sydney Pollack's deftly directed ""The Interpreter"" as Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn, two talented Oscar winners, interact fluidly in a film that, in addition to entertaining, has a good deal to say about the current international political scene.

Kidman, a United Nations interpreter who has come to New York in hopes of working for peace, overhears a telephone conversation in which two men talk about assassinating a controversial African head of state.  Kidman is one of the few people in town capable of understanding the conversation since the language is that of her home country, an African nation headed by a ruthless strongman who was once a popular military leader but was corrupted ultimately by power and turned against his own people.

Sean Penn, in the midst of tragedy following his wife's death only three weeks earlier, works in a special branch of the Secret Service. When asked to investigate Kidman's revelation he is initially skeptical, but when activities begin heating up and an African is killed by his roommate he realizes that danger lurks.

Circumstances are compounded by the fact that the UN wishes to pursue legal means through the International Criminal Court and that an assassination could make the victim a martyr in the eyes of the people of his nation and further compound instability there.  In the interim the dictatorial strongman is on his way to the UN to address the General Assembly in hopes that he can sway negative public opinion in his direction.

As the story develops it becomes clear that Kidman has a personal stake in the outcome of the emerging tragedy beyond being a citizen of the nation in question.  It is learned that the dictator victimized her family, and that previously she along with so many of the nation's citizenry had admired him greatly.

As the film nears its breathtaking climax Kidman has an opportunity to speak with the dictator.  The question is whether she will attempt to deal with him on her own rather than letting international law take its course.  Penn is on the scene and uses his influence to steer matters to a peaceful conclusion in which legality will prevail.",1119225600,5,2182,4.920980926430517
1525450,5,B00005JNQA,"Who says this isn't a well-oiled thriller, its twists may come undone to some but they are far from witless. I saw the denouement three quarters of the way, but in all fairness the screenplay had me engrossed and thinking twice about every bathroom break I needed to take.

The script is somewhat reminiscent of Hitchcock's North by Northwest -- United Nations, mistaken identities, intense chases and shadowings -- but Pollack's keen sense of narrative makes sure The Interpreter plays with a full deck.

Most refreshing feature: it doesn't tiptoe around political messages despite its Hollywood roots. It audaciously sports a white African as the pivotal character. Anyone who's lived in modern day Africa knows that much of the continent's violence is now instigated by its own indigenous reprobates, not by Apartheid. The leader ""Zuwanie"" and the fictitious nation of ""Matobo"" may well be ill-concealed allusions to General Mugabe and Zimbabwe, so the theme should be doubly resonant to those with an eye for current affairs.

The script couches several well-meaning lines about war and international politics, and of course, the raison d'etre of the United Nations. I found most of it credible, but caveat emptor to people who are disillusioned by the UN as it stands today: prepare to plug your nose in some scenes.

Thankfully, there's a smattering of other reasons to watch this fine production. Aerial shots of NY's streets are slick. James Howard's music employs silence to great effect, building to sensational crescendos when a standoff could be so accentuated. I gather this is the first Hollywood crew to have been allowed access to actual U.N. premises, a privilege that Pollack takes full advantage of.

While there is some merit to the gripe that it wallows in its characters' muddy pasts, it crackles in every attempt to unravel who is playing for whom, and more notably, why. Penn and Kidman's chemistry has attracted much commentary, though I was more taken by what keeps them apart than what brings them together.

Set in the United Nations building in New York City, Nicole Kidman plays Silvia Broome, a South African attach from Motago.  Sean Penn is Tobin Keller, a CIA agent assigned for Silvia's protection.

In the opening sequences, Silvia over hears a possible plot to kill the incumbent leader of her homeland, Motago.  Though not a supporter of the current regime in power, Silvia reports the possible threat to the authorities.  After a series of seemingly unrelated deaths, Silvia's story begins to garner greater respect.  However, when the leading suspect is also murdered in a metro explosion, the possible suspects are no longer clearly apparent.

Directed by Sydney Pollack, the film moves effortlessly through the plot twists and unexpected turns that you come to anticipate in a film of this nature.

1525482,3,B00005JNQA,"Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman put on a master acting class in ""The Interpreter."" Set amidst the shifting political alliances of the United Nations, it isn't groundbreaking or jarring, but it is thoughtful, partially because these two actors know what to do with a scene when they get a couple decent ones.

Kidman is Sylvia Broome, a native of the fictional African nation Matobo, an UN interpreter who overhears an apparent assassination plot of Matobo's leader, Zuwanie, a once-reformer who, not unlike Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe, has turned his nation toward a military dictatorship. Sylvia has her reasons for wanting ""The Teacher"" dead, but here she is, reporting the plot to Secret Service agent Tobin Keller (Penn).

Keller's assessment? ""She's lying,"" he tells his partner Dot (Catherine Keener). And Sylvia is - about her past, her connections to the Matobian resistance movement, maybe even her own motives.

Director Sydney Pollack, out of the game since the bomb ""Random Hearts,"" allows ""The Interpreter"" to burn slowly. Keller, conversation by conversation, inches closer to Sylvia, who hides her nationalistic fervor with an idealism that seems like a front until the end, when its ironic source becomes clear, and undergirds the most critical decision of Sylvia's life.

In between is the mystery - not all that mysterious - of who, if anyone, wants Zuwanie dead, or maybe just targeted for death. Let it be said that The Teacher's head of security (Jesper Christensen) hangs around the investigation a lot. One of Zuwanie's opponents (Yvan Attal) is assassinated in the movie's opening sequence; the other, wonderfully named Kuman-Kuman (George Harris) is part of movie's most suspenseful sequence aboard a NYC bus. Other scenes stand out: The dictator, Zuwanie, recalling a parade on the George Washington bridge in his honor the last time he visited New York; a quiet moment inside the United Nations, with its comfy earth tones and swooping ceilings.

But the chief pleasures are Penn and Kidman. They're A-list stars now, capable of carrying a film on their presence and talent alone.

Starting with ""Mystic River,"" Penn tapped into middle-aged weariness with authority; it never would have been said of his early career, but he now embodies ""old-school"" man like Jeff Bridges does - virile, wise, angry. Kidman seems to play a broad range of characters, but they're all intellectually intense, often emotionally fierce, generally challenging. Kidman pushes her acting somewhat - ""spunk"" can be the residue of trying a little too hard - but at least it's not a mail-in. Both peel back their personal layers haltingly until they acknowledge they're kindred spirits.

Love never develops between Keller and Sylvia, but they merge as angry, romantic souls. Were political futures actually settled by people other than lifetime government employees and the Condi Rices who've spent lifetimes in library basements, you'd prefer this good-intentioned passion.

1525483,3,B00005JNQA,"The point of ""The Interpreter"" seems to be that in a civilized world one should always drop the machine gun and rather use diplomacy and the UN. Now, if we could just convince our president to do that. Anyways, I found this to be a powerful movie that sneaks up on you. I found myself feeling underwhelmed for the first hour or so, only to be completely enthralled by the time the credits rolled. This film, which lives and dies with its storytelling ability, overcomes many of the pratfalls of the political thriller to tell a powerful story.  In most political thrillers the director takes us to a land of make believe where really important people are replaced by people who they tell us are important.  By avoiding this you can avoid character development of the villains (see ""All the Presidents Men"" and while not a political thriller a film nonetheless ""Fahrenheit 9/11""). This film contains the make believe land of Motobo, and with the filmmakers not wanting to name names it sort of neuters the film. That is not to say the movie is totally apolitical, UN strife, suicide bombers, and terrorism are things born out of our recent political past.  The film revolves around a Motoban citizen who now works in the UN named Sylvia (Nicole Kidman) who hears about a assassination plot that is to be executed inside the UN. Sean Penn and Catherine Keener are the people the government sends to investigate the threat (playing quintessential Sean Penn and Catherine Keener characters).  From there people's pasts are examined, and Sylvia is thrust into the middle of Motoban's political upheaval. There are at least 3 very good suspense scenes that were impressive to me. I could have done without the romance between Kidman and Penn. I know some girls out there will only show up for any movie if they think there is a possibility that the climax will involve a wedding in a park. However, and I don't know about you, when I'm knee deep in Motoban politics I don't have time for anything else. I also enjoyed the connections this film had to my real life. Oren's Daily Roast (my employer) was represented in the form of three coffee cups. Also, when the bus blows up, it blows up on Nostrand Ave. in Brooklyn, the same street that I live on.

1525484,5,B00005JNQA,"""The Interpreter"", the brilliant new political thriller directed by Sydney Pollock, marks, among others, the most violent film to ever recieve a  PG-13 rating. It's not grossly violent, and it isn't dominated by blood soaked action sequences, it's just suprisingly bloody, and you don't expect it to be. It's not like I have never seen a bloody PG-13 movie (""XXX"" or ""Spiderman 2""), it's just that when you see a movie that kids are seeing in the same show as you, you don't really expect to see a person shot and see blood spurt. It doesn't take anything away from the movie though, which for all of its running time remains a suspensful and fairly frightening thriller. The acting is top-notch, and Sean Penn does a great acting job, probably his best since ""Mystic River"". Katherine Keener, playing Penn's partner, has not yet retired from her token role as comic relief sidekick, but she does a very good job with her role. The settings are great, and most of the movie takes place in either Greenwich Village, or the Upper East Side. The settings are appropriately claustrophbic, but colorful and cozy. Nicole Kidman does an excellent job as the title character. Now, I guess it goes without saying that Sydney Pollock, who has what is known moreover as a glorified cameo, does the sequences of characters talking much better than the action sequences. The set piece, I guess, actually comes in the middle of the movie, when an assassin comes to kill Nicole Kidman, and Penn is involved in a five minute gun fight with him. What makes the scene all the better is that the assassin is never seen by Penn, so he must shoot towards the noises he hears. This adds a probability to the movie that the rest of the movie does not have so good. The talking set piece, however, is a sequence that dominates the first act of the film. It is a twenty minute conversation between Kidman and Penn. The movie has several scenes that don't really need to be there, like the scenes between the technician that Kidman works with. He acts creepy and we all think that it may lead somewhere, but it never does, and he plays a tiny part, if any, in the climax. There are also many scenes, like the one where Penn explains his gruffness and uses an old African ritual as a example, that work beyond working ability.

Nicole Kidman plays Silvia Broome, a U.N. interpreter who grew up in Africa. She has had a tortured childhood, with her family (her parents and little sister) being blown up by a land mine. She grew up with her brother, Simon (Hugo Speer), who is a person who frequents soccer stadiums and peace rally's. Silvia moved to New York because she ""did not want to stand on the side of the road with a machine gun"". She interprets the African region in the U.N. into English. She has a lonely life, living alone in a pretty large apartment in, if you have not yet figured it out, New York. She has African relics around her house, to remind her of Africa and her only remaining relative. The plot begins when Silvia goes back to her booth late at night and overhears a plotto kill the African president, Edward Zuwanie (Earl Cameron). Nobody in America, or Africa for that matter, likes him very much because he started a genocide in Africa, single handedly killing hundreds of African's. She goes to FBI agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) and his partner Dot Woods (Catherine Keener). They don't believe her, and they have about three days to do so. The problem may be that Silvia waited a day after hearing the comment to go to the police. This is because the plotters referred to him as ""Our Father"", and so did a man that Silvia interviewed the next day. Stranagely, he is never considered a suspect. Everyone, except for this guy, is considered a suspect, since nobody likes him very much, as I stated before.

The climax to the film is well done and very intense, and the writers, Martin Stellman and Brian Ward, generously devote the third act to setting up the pivitol scene. The end of the movie is done very well, and is at one moment intense and the next sweet and caring. Althought the movie runs for a rather lengthy 135 minutes, it does not feel that long. It feels more in the 90 minute range. It may be because the film is so interesting and rather seminal in a strange, weird way. Although the movie does get a little crazy in terms of violence in the middle, it never feels overdone or like it does not need to be there. It is all there for one reason or another, and it feels as if even one sequence, one minute, one second was missing, the whole movie would collapse. The film works on too many levels to describe, and this is definetely the second best film of the year (the first being ""Crash"").

Running Time: 135 Minutes (2 Hours 15 Minutes)

Questions, questions...And who wrote the excuse for a script for this? Whoever it was he/she needs special mention. One needs talent to write something as low quality as this.

  Nitty gritty time. A blond woman (guess who) is being hunted by bad, bad, bad african characters who work for a corrupt, corrupt, corrupt african leader from an imaginary country which according to the script has a major blond and/or white  population but is otherwise in no way connected or influenced/manipulated by the west. This was by the way a touch i seriously loved. Kudos to the scriptwriter again.

  A black haired cop (guess who) comes in to save the blond african girl (the tears, the tears). The blond african girl is an interpreter who -we're told speaks ""Koo"" but in the process of the film winds up speaking several other languages in a moment's notice. Now, pay attention, the blond african girl overhears some bad Koo-speaking black Africans plotting the assasination of the soon to come to the U.N to give a speech in English bad African leader of Kurduboo (or something like that, the country is fictional) who also speaks Koo. Koo is very trendy in the film.

  This sets off the slowest hunt in the history of bad movie making. The bad Koos chase the good Koo and the Brooklyn accented copper almost learns Koo himself in the process cuzz he spends more time doing the Koo thing with the blond african girl than anything else. Oh no, this doesn't mean they get to do the hot thing if you get my drift. But they sure beat it a lot around the Koo bush trying to get there. Confused? Hey, it's not me, that's the film i'm describing here.

  A bus explodes, some more Koo gets spoken, Penn and Kidman seem to be undetered in their quest for the slowest advancing romance ever, and the world meets in the U.N to hear some more Koo. You get the picture.

  I really don't know (not sure i want to either) why actors of such caliber chose to participate in a heavily disguised mediocre comedy such as this. I suspect in horror they thought the script was good. But i don't want to believe it. The film is promoted as a ""political thriller"". It's neither political nor does it thrill. It fails even as a comedy. It fails in fact in so many aspects you can easily lose count. But it sure inspires you to write about it.

  As a last note i'll say this. The holes in the story were only outmatched in number by the sheer size of them. In a display of pure professionalism the scriptwriter kept the biggest hole for the very last scene where the entire security force of the U.N watches Kidman through a camera hold a gun to the head of someone (plus breach all levels of U.N security in the process) only to walk breasy-easy free afterwards cuzz she was doing the right thing.

1525487,4,B00005JNQA,"The first time that I saw a preview for this film, I thought to myself, ""Nicole Kidman looks great in that"".  That's about it.  The previews kind of made it look like a generic movie that everyone has seen dozens of times already.  Then it was released, and good press started to come in by the barrelful.  So I decided to check it out after all.  As the title of this review suggests, for the most part, this is a pretty good political thriller, but it kinds of runs out of gas at the end.  I don't know, maybe the writer couldn't come up with a good ending twist.  Whatever the case was, it's too bad, because with a better ending, this could have been a memorable classic in years to come.

Anyway, the story centers around Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman), an African-born Caucasian who is filled with a desire for change in her homeland, but has chosen to do so with words rather than bullets.  She has become an interpreter for the United Nations (this is the very first movie to actually shoot on location at the UN building).  One night, while retrieving some of her belongings, she overhears some people discussing an assasination of a much-hated leader in Broome's home country.

When Broome reports this, US Secret Service assigns Agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) to protect/interrogate her.  Keller, while a very good agent, is a little on edge, due to problems involving his wife.  He is so ridden with angst and despair that he calls his own telephone number in order to hear his wife's voice on the answering machine.

As time goes on, the pair gets more and more involved in the conspiracy as people try to frighten them away from investigating the matter further.  Along the way, we discover some interesting facts from Silvia's past.

Both Kidman and Penn give great performances in their respective roles, and the acting is pretty good all around.  As I already stated, this is the first time that the actual interiors of the UN building has appeared in a movie, and they are definitely a sight to behold.  The one thing is that the ending didn't really do it for me.  It seemed as if the writers took the easy way out instead of coming up with something truly shocking.

-- what kind of background security checks do they do at the UN (as envsiaged in this film) if someone with Nicole Kidman's history is so easily hired on?

-- how many languages does she interpret anyway??

-- can Nicole Kidman get any more gorgeous?

-- why does Sean Penn need most of the movie to fall in love in Nicole Kidman?

-- same question, roles reversed?

-- it's always wonderful to see footage of Africa, even a baleful Africa.

-- is the old dictator thinking in the climactic scene, ""shoot me if you must, but spare me the philosophizing""?

-- can Nicole Kidman get any more gorgeous?

-- why isn't this movie forty minutes shorter?

-- and even when they do find out that they love each other, the audience reaction -- at least this audience -- is, ""who cares!!""

-- Clint Eastwood makes a better Secret Service agent than Sean Penn.

-- too bad nobody gets to ride on AirForce One.

-- Sean Penn looks like he needs sleep even when he's had sleep.

-- the long set-up to the most spectacular scene of the movie is really tense and well-done.

-- can Nicole Kidman get any more gorgeous?

Finally, one problem with The Interpreter is that all of these mind-static thoughts take place simultaneously with watching the movie.  That's a big problem.

1525489,4,B00005JNQA,"I have never subscribed to the movie maxim that a great director makes for a great movie, but here it was never more true. Sydney Pollacks political thriller set inside the United Nations is a masterful pot boiler full of suspense, credible plot lines and directed with a masterful even handedness that is never overbearing. Nicole Kidman plays Silvia Broom, a multi lingual translator working in the UN in New York, who overhears a plot to assassinate the dictatorial leader of Matobo (a war torn and divided African State). She is summarily placed under the protection of the Secret Service in the form of Tobin Keller (Sean Penn), an action that actually heightnes the nightmare into which she has become immersed, and the intrigue and suspense begins to build in even layers. Both Kidman and Penns characters are intertwined as they each deal with their own recent personal losses, but Pollack deliberatley steers away from a formula pattern of attraction, instead delving deep into character development and a great storyline. Is Kidman a target? a victim? or even a suspect? we find ourselves asking as the story unfolds. The two begin to play a gripping dance of evasion and revelation that keeps them both guessing as they head to stop a potential international crisis. There are some dramatic sequences, and thought provoking side comment along the way, giving the whole picture a complete and professional feel seldom seen in other films of the genre. The movie itself was groundbreaking as it is actually filmed  inside the UN (the first time this has ever been done), but this is just an interesting caveat to a great movie. Pollack himself pops up for a small but believable cameo (as he seems to do in most of his movies) but he takes a back seat to some top class acting, chiefly from Kidman and Penn in the lead roles. The early 2005 release will probably preclude an Oscar nod for next year, but this is right up there, and represents some of Pollacks best work, of the calibre of Three Days of the Condor, and The Firm to name just two. One or two very minor inconsistencies and flaws I felt personally, kept me from giving this 5 stars, but make no mistake, this is an excellent movie from all angles.

1525540,4,B00005JNQA,"""The Interpreter"" begins with Sylvia Broom (Nicole Kidman), a mysterious UN interpreter from Motobo (a fictional African nation that is the film's focal point), overhearing signs of an assassination attempt against the Matoban president. Eventually, when problems occur and a masked man threatens her at her home, the CIA steps in, as they happen to be waiting for the Matoban president --a famed extremist-- so as to protect him from New York City opposition and protesters. This is when Tobin Kellar (Sean Penn) steps in, often followed by a middling Catherine Keener. At first doubting Broom's honesty, Tobin begins to take a liking to her when he discovers that, like him, she lost a loved one. It is at this point ""The Interpreter"" takes its most interesting and perceptive turn. In taking time to study Tobin and Broom, director Sydney Pollack achieves a bit of elevation above most films in this genre.

More frequently than necessary, non-stop explosions and CGI are shoved down our throats, but Pollack achieves an appropriate balance between character and suspense. And now that most critics spend entire columns talking about the film's intelligence, a point must be made that ""The Interpreter"" does not go without its fair amount of excitement. In fact, a scene where most of the film's major characters some how end up on the same bus (in the middle of New York City, no less) is so well-directed that all thoughts of contrivance are forgotten, and it soon blossoms into one of the best-filmed scenes of this year. Its craftsmanship would have even made Hitchcock salivate. Ultimately, ""The Interpreter"" is a solid thriller worthy of wide audiences, though its smarts may unfortunately be taken as box office poison. However, if you're into intelligent thrillers, it's highly recommended.

Above all else, ""The Interpreter"" attempts to comment on the modern world with its central characters, who share the pain of loss. ""Why can't you name the dead?"" asks Tobin. ""You only name the dead once you're ready to move on,"" responds Broom. Neither seem ready to move on, but in the mean time I guess they have each other, a relationship in no need of translation. We've all had similar connections; they're all over the cinema: ""Lost in Translation,"" etc. Pollack opts to use this relationship as a metaphor for a fallen world lacking any form of similar cohesiveness. The international community's inability to accept superficial differences and value more profound connections --the every day problems and people that shape us, struggles and loss, comedy and tragedy-- is part of what the movie is concerned with, beyond suspense. Here, characters matter: the world matters.",1115596800,,2684,5.097727272727273
1525541,5,B00005JNQA,"This complex thriller concerns U.N. interpreter Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman), who grew up in a war-torn African country, now ruled by dictator Dr. Zuwanie.  She overhears (or does she?) a plot to kill Zuwanie at the UN in three days.  Secret Service agent Keller (Sean Penn) is assigned to protect her and to see if she has any involvement in the plot.  He learns Silvia was active in the anti-Zuwanie movement back home, where her parents and siblings were killed by him.  As the day of Zuwanie's appearance at the U.N. approaches, several attempts are made on Silvia's life.  But is she an innocent caught up in a political storm or is she an assassin?

Kidman is great as the mysterious interpreter who is filled with her grief and her ideals, and maybe is not what she seems.  Penn gives a refreshingly understated performance as a dedicated agent and recently-bereaved husband.  The script avoids a clich romance between the two stars, but shows their connection to be heartfelt, nonetheless.  Filmed entirely in New York City, there is a constant sense of danger, helped by an intense and energetic soundtrack.  This movie is not particularly scary or violent, but succeeds because of the fine acting of the two stars and a script that makes you pay attention and think about what you are watching.

You have to pay attention and make an effort to comprehend the issues the characters face in order to understand their behavior.  One reviewer noted that Sean Penn's character seemed, at times, disinterested.  That's because he was!  His character is troubled over a recent tragedy and he's distracted -- and Penn plays it well.  The main characters in this film are arriving at the center point of the story from completely different directions and that makes the film interesting.  This is not Penn and Kidman unite to conquer the bad guys, this is Penn and Kidman dodging and weaving... and who are the bad guys, anyway?  This may not be Pollack at his very best, but he's certainly near the top of his game.  Sean Penn is an excellent actor and he does a great job in this film, he plays his role very well, tormented characters seem to be a natural for him.  I'm not a great fan of Kidman, but she turns in a good performance and was well cast.  All in all, it is a very good film and one worth seeing on the big screen.",1115251200,2,1139,4.350710900473934
1525543,4,B00005JNQA,"What is it about 2005s The Interpreter, directed by Sydney Pollack and starring Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn that has sent audiences around the globe into a not so eloquent verbal and critical frenzy?  Its semi predictable ending perhaps?  Honestly, I don't think Sydney Pollack was out to shock the masses with a twisted and unexpected ending, or even to make a film rife with explosions and action sequences.  It's deeper than that, and thank god.  If there's one director to make a political thriller, it's Pollack, just take a look at 2003s The Quiet American, in all its haunting and heartbreaking glory.  Maybe if the hundreds of eyes in the theatre actually looked into the film rather than skimmed its surface, they might be able to comprehend its incredibly accurate and important message, particularly in our lives today.  If this were the case, then maybe the ending would still be up in the air, leaving you breathless, maybe a little shocked to have seen the incredible lengths that people will go to in order to defend their culture, their lifestyles, their lives.  How appropriate this theme is in a time of unsettled American and international conflict. (Spoiler alert). Sure, maybe you figured out that Nicole Kidman took the job as a U.N interpreter in search of the opportunity to get close to the man who gave her and her country everything and then stripped it away, an opportunity to carry out her vengeance, (and if that's the case, bravo to you), but beneath that is her incredibly powerful performance, supported by a witty, wry and exceptionally well written screenplay by Martin Stellman and Brian Ward.  Admittedly, Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman are an unexpected duo, but the energy they both exude (particularly Kidman) lights up the screen in performances equally worthy of praise.  It's an electrifying film, one that will pierce deep into your core if you let it, and leave you thinking about so much more than whether or not Nicole Kidman's accent was accurate. (By the way, the African languages were fictional, made up for the film, so that excuse bears no merit here on whether or not this film is worth seeing.)

1525544,4,B00005JNQA,"The movie ""The Interpreter"" is the first ever to be filmed inside the actual United Nations Manhattan complex and the inside look at the building, hallways and conference rooms is a main attraction for me and a show how important and powerful Hollywood has become. Take for instance the 1959 thriller ""North by Northwest."" Denied at the time even the chance to film the exterior of the building Hitchcock's people had to resort to covert means to grab the shot of Cary Grant approaching the entrance (legend has it that the camera was concealed in a van.

So here we are almost a half-century later and the United Nations opens up its doors and they couldn't have chosen a more intelligent and globally relevant, classy effort by veteran moviemakers.

The story begins with simultaneous translator Silvia Bloome (Nicole Kidman) overhearing a whispered exchange in Ku, the little-known language of the fictional South African nation of Matobo. The message may signal an assassination attempt on Matobo's President Zuwanie (Earl Cameron), soon to arrive at the U.N. to defend himself against charges of in humane acts.

The threat activates the Secret Service's Dignitary Protection Squad, in particular Agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn), a troubled and weary man soon fencing with the glacial, guarded and lonely Silvia.

Is Dr. Zuwanie a patriot or a terrorist? Is Silvia herself a target or a sleeper? The trail leads to immigrant walk-ups and a Central Park rendezvous. The players assemble -- Zuwanie's head of security Lud (Jesper Christensen), his political enemies Kuman-Kuman (George Harris) and Xola (Curtiss Cook), plus a photographer who has seen too much (Yvan Attal). Bodies begin to accumulate. The key is in what Keller will be able to extract from Silvia's murky past as their private lives begin to merge.

""The Interpreter"" builds a creditable sense of claustrophobia and dread, with the occasional heart-thumping spike, but is more often a long stall with the phrase ""It's got nothing to do with you"" used once too often. This is one movie where unraveling the plot complexities may need a second viewing, but no matter because Pollack is one of the best in the business.

That face, that marvelous face -- Penn's, of course -- with its furrowed brow and great pendulous nose. His Keller has a nothing-left-to-lose swagger to his walk, and we soon figure out why.

""Interpreter"" also gets mileage out of Kidman, perhaps as beautiful as ever she has been with her low, richly sculpted voice and schoolboy clothes. That's another of the problems: Both of them are gamin and tousled. This movie is said to be a make-or-break for her after some problems in recent duds and I would lay my bets on her emerging from this springs movie  lineup in good shape.

To get to the sophisticated stuff, we will have to swallow a plot implausibility or two, beginning with why conspirators would discuss their plans in the General Assembly.

It's too bad; the movie throws out scenes of unexpected power, for example, when, on a dusty African road, two men with an agenda pass a man with no eyes.

Will a summer-primed audience accept a thriller without action, an adult, if dry, psychodrama? Only time will tell, but I think this will be mentioned in future promo's for other movies when the posters of other features proclaim loudly ""From the Director of The Interpreter.""",1115078400,2,3373,4.9416961130742045

1525547,4,B00005JNQA,"MOVIE:

This movie can best be compared to the recent remake of The Manchurian Candidate, except that this movie is actually relevent to events occuring in the world. The film centers around two main characters, an interpreter and a Secret Service agent. Nicole Kidman plays an interpreter who accidentally overhears an assassination plot to kill the dictator of a fictitous African country. Sean Penn plays the agent sent to investigate the case. What follows is a movie that focuses mainly on the action rather than the story.  Yes, we do get the troubled pasts of the two characters, but it's really the past of Kidman's characters that matters, because it is her that Sean Penn suspects as being a lier.  The film has a lot of political mumbo jumbo that I won't get into, but it's not all stuff that will bore you, it will only bore you if I write about it now.  There's really not much I can talk about because the film relys on tension building and what the audience doesn't know.  All I can say that it is a very intelligent and well made thriller.  James Newton Howard's score adds to the tension, and he borrows some of Zimmer's African vocals at the end which I really enjoyed.  I loved the ending to this movie, there was a real sense of closure, something very rare in films today.  It doesn't end right after the climax peaks, no silly one line from the main character and a fade to black, but an actual end that closes the film. I liked it, some points were slow, but Syndey Pollack handled it well.

ACTING: Sean Penn was great, Nicole Kidman was not.  I really thought Kidman's acting was stale, she had the same tone of voice throughout the entire film, she never changed her tone of voice. Sean Penn on the other hand shows that he deserved the Oscar, his acting was very emotional and very real. Everyone working here is a veteran in the film industry, the result is a professional and intelligent result.

BOTTOM LINE: Tense moments, very satisfying ending. A great thriller from a great filmmaker, with great acting for the most part. It's not stupid, you won't ask questions, no real plot holes. Just plain movie fun.",1114992000,,2139,4.5732984293193715
1525548,4,B00005JNQA,"The Interpreter is helmed by Oscar-winning director Sydney Pollack and Oscar winners Nicole Kidman, Sean Penn and an Oscar nominee Catherine Zeener. The story line may not be exactly intriguing but offers a good glimpse of the United Nations. What made the political thriller thrilling has to be the strong performances by the leads.

Nicole Kidman has come a long way and even in a role where she is required to speak in different languages including an African tribal language (fictitious?), she comes across as being a natural. In emotional scenes, Kidman's facial expression conveys the story even before she speaks. Sean Penn resonates in his role as a secret service agent troubled by the death of his ex-wife. The lines exchanged between Kidman and himself are mostly well-scripted and even funny at times.

The part of the story that stuck out as a sore thumb would probably be the suggested romance between the two leads. Luckily, it didn't quite happen.

The mix of political theme including United Nations, genocide and terrorism is good material which could easily become too predictable or incredulous if not carefully handled. For the most part, Pollack has kept the story exciting for viewers to want to find out what's happening next. Credit should also go the screenwriter for some of the best lines in the movie: ""United Nations - too many layer of words but no action"", ""Vengeance is just a lazy form of grief"" and ""The smallest whisper can be heard over the largest army when it speaks the truth.""",1114905600,,1517,4.8949416342412455

From there the film just goes downhill, and it's hard to feel anything for any of the characters. Sean Penn acts like he doesnt really want to be there, and Kidman is unconvincing as the South African.  The other problem with the film is that it goes on for too long!

To market the film, they have plasted Sidney Pollack as Director all over it (as if it guarantees a sure-fire hit) and the fact that it was filmed in the United Nations Building.

I really wanted to enjoy the film but found it uninteresting, dull and a big try-hard.  Definitely one viewing is enough.  Can't understand the box office bliss that it got on its opening weekend.  Assume it was because nothing else was on.",1114905600,,851,4.516339869281046
1525627,2,B00005JNQA,"The Interpreter 2.5/5

I had high expectations for this film. It stars both Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman and is directed by Sydney Pollack, an Oscar-winning director.

UN interpreter Sylvia Broome, specialist in African languages, overhears a possible discussion about an assasination attempt on the soon to be visiting President of Matobo. The President was a grass roots freedom fighter but after becoming the country's leader, he became a brutal dictator. Broome, as initally interviewed by weary Secret Service agent and recent widow, Tobin Keller (Sean Penn.) Keller is normally assigned to protect visiting dignitaries and tries to size up Broome and her accusations.

Soon, we learn that Broome's past in Matobo crosses with the dictatorship in way that affects her for the rest of her life. As the film drags on, we learn more and more about the past of the elusive Sylvia Broome.

The performances in the film are credible but not especially noteworthy, no doubt due to the weak script. Kidman isn't particularly appealing as the central focus of the film. Her vulnerability is diminished by her elusiveness. Her interactions with minor characters in the film, seem contrived, rather than by chance or surprise.

The film is not succint enough to make for a delicious thriller. It doesn't give you a good aha moment where it all falls into place. You don't get a chance to try to solve the mystery on your own like you do in other films. There are moments of tension, but they don't make up for the poor script.

I'll give Pollack credit, though, for not adding a fashionable, sugary romance. It appears romance was part of the shooting but all it was wisely edited out of the final cut.

The theatre was packed but it was mostly older folk, 50s and up.

I wouldn't watch it again.",1114905600,3,1789,4.823529411764706
1525628,4,B00005JNQA,"The Interpreter proves to be a solid but uneven movie about this woman played by Nicole Kidman who overheard an assassin plot against this dictator of a fictional African country while at work in the United Nation. Ironically, she is also from that country as well long ago. Sean Penn played a Secret Service agent who had to investigate and access the threat to that dictator who will be coming to the UN and also checked out Nicole Kidman's character as well.

The general story moves along pretty well. The main characters are well developed. The movie played along as a some sort of a ""spy thriller"", a lot of cloak and dagger type of theme. Both Penn and Kidman's characters shared a same common problem of losing love ones and dealing with it. Both actors proves to be quite good in their roles. I am pleased that for once, Sean Penn isn't his usual outrageous self that some fans like him to be. He is very restraint in this movie, letting his body do his talking for him. Kidman I thought, was quite believable character and she proves herself to be a solid actress despite of her good looks. (Some reviewers actually panned Penn because he was so restraint.)

Overall, the story works but only up to a certain point. The script wasn't as tight as it should be. By middle of the movie, you began to see thing far more clearly then what the director intented. The only real killer however, was the ending. After all that talk about forgiving, why would the movie end the way it did?? And what govenment would released a would be assassin based on a word of a secret service agent. Maybe I am giving away too much here in this review but overall, the ending hurt the film because its lack creditablity and believablity in contrast to the rest of the film.

Amazingly, no sex scenes, no romance between the two leading actors, I guess they were just too busy staying alive and doing their jobs. That proves to be quite refreshing.

Overall, pretty solid movie like I wrote before. But it could have been so much better if the director and scriptwriter didn't fall flat on their faces at the end. (I would give it a 3.6 stars rating if I had a choice.)",1114905600,,2156,4.464467005076142

1525631,4,B00005JNQA,"Words have a significant meaning when expressed with genuine honesty.  This is also the easiest way of communicating, as it quickly can convey the meaning of something important.  When communicating in a different language, skills are necessary to decipher the foreign language.  If the language skills are lacking, or not proficient, it could lead to misinterpretations, which could have dire consequence.  Thus, it is essential for an interpreter to be able to translate a language proficiently without errors in order to eliminate misunderstandings.  When Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman) works at the United Nations (UN) Headquarters in New York, she translates different languages and she is fully aware of the importance of clear and concise interpretation.

The Interpreter opens in Matobo, a small African nation amidst brutal ethnic cleansing, where the audience witnesses the cruelty of weapons and hateful teachings.  This brutality provides some hints to what the story is about, yet it leaves the audience in complete darkness as it is not clear how these characters are related to the story, as it takes place in New York.  One evening after a failing metal detector Silvia returns to her working place, the UN Headquarters, to pick up a bag that she left behind.  As Silvia enters the room with her bag she accidentally hears a conversation in a foreign langauge, which she was not intended to hear.  What was said, remains a mystery to the audience, as subtitles are not provided, which enhances the suspense in the story.

Eventually Silvia figures out the seriousness of the conversation that she overheard, as she reports it to the security of the UN Headquarters.  Consequently, the Secret Service arrives to the location in order to investigate the situation headed by Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) who personally is struggling with the loss of his wife.  When Tobin and Silvia meet for the first time there is tension, as Tobin finds her insincere, yet he cannot place his finger on what makes him feel this way.  Nonetheless, the audience learns while the story unfolds that this political thriller has a several layers colored by personal feelings and powerful political undercurrents sweeping through the UN and the Big Apple.  Cleverly, the director Sydney Pollack only discloses the crucial facts at the critical moment, yet it is also here where some of the weakness rest within the story.

One of the more important notions conveyed through the film is the importance of forgiveness.  Initially, Silvia tells Tobin about a custom in Matobo where they do not utter the name of the dead until the mourning feel that they can move on.  She also tells him about the tradition where they throw a murderer into the river while the surviving victims can choose to save or let the murderer drown.  If the survivors decide to let the person drown they live and will continue to live in disharmony, as they have acquired their vengeance.  Yet, harmony can be salvaged by saving the murderer from drowning.  Another layer of the story that Pollack illustrates is the blindness of vengeful hatred and anger, which flushes away any kind of existing sympathy.  Tobin thoroughly describes in a scene what he would do to the murderer, as clouded thoughts prevent him from seeing nothing but retribution.  The film cleverly depicts the aftermath of anger while it balances with harmonious forgiveness through both Tobin and Sylvia who are mere pawns in the big political game at the UN Headquarters.

The Interpreter offers an intelligent political thriller that does balance human emotions with politics through the main characters.  Being able to shoot the film on location, the UN Headquarters, helped developed a genuine atmosphere where the audience can feel the tension between the nations and the individuals in the film.  It also offers an opportunity for the audience to reflect over the seriousness of the matter in the backdrop of recent political events in the world, which also builds up more anticipation and suspense.  Yet, the true treasure of the film rests within the emotional aspect of the story, as it provides a honorable lesson of human existence.  Unfortunately, some of these aspects come across a little too strong, as it almost feels too blissful and overly righteous.",1114646400,2,4299,5.068181818181818
1525632,3,B00005JNQA,"Going into The Interpreter I was hoping for a truly great, well written, edgy, nail biting suspense thriller that kept my interest all the way to the end.  So MANY thrillers look great in the previews but then fall flat when you watch them.  I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed!

Kidman, I must say, was as sublime as always.  She does the mysterious, haunted, beautiful female thing soooo well.  In this role she plays a United Nations Interpreter who translates into an obscure African tribal dialect with which she is familiar because she grew up in the (fictional) country which speaks it.  Her performance is serious, gritty, and believable.

Penn plays a role that is unlike anything he has done before.  He's a mess, and he does messy remarkably well!  He's the FBI agent tasked with determining if the threat which Kidman surfaced is legitimate while also trying to overcome the recent death of his wife.  It was refreshing to see Penn let his hair down, so to speak, and not be afraid to look ugly, old, and tired on camera.  His performance is worthy of a nomination, I think.

So why 3 stars, and not 4 or 5?  As gripping as this movie was, it still wasn't the timeless classic I was hoping for.  It's a FANTASTIC show with superb acting and great directing, but it didn't captivate me the way, say, The Fugitive or The Sixth Sense did.  It doesn't quit get under your skin and make you dream about it the night after watching it.  Does that make sense?  I give it an A.  Not an A+

In a nut shell - watch it.  You'll be glad you did.  It's every bit the serious and grinding suspense thriller you're hoping for.",1114646400,,1626,4.444067796610169
1525633,3,B00005JNQA,"Movies serve many purposes.  For example, they might edify so that we never repeat past mistakes (Schindler's List, Hotel Rwanda); they might just serve to make us laugh (Dumb and Dumber, Planes, Trains, and Automobiles); or they might drop us into a suspenseful world with sketchy characters and hidden pasts (The Deep End, Chinatown).  The Interpreter fits neatly into that last category, aiming to keep the audience on its collective toes as it asks a new question with each one it answers.

Nicole Kidman is certainly credible as Silvia, the title character, of both British and South African descent.  She makes an allegation that cannot be substantiated, while her motives may be suspect.  We in the audience see things as much from Sean Penn's perspective (Keller) as hers.  Penn, always a good actor, plays a sleepless secret service agent whose job is to get to the bottom of her tip and protect her if she is in danger.  Perhaps this is just because of his illustrious career as a portrayor of countless gangsters, thugs, and jerks, but Penn does not strike the audience as perfectly suited to his role.  He always seems more at home on the other side of the law, as the sleazy lawyer-turned-wiseguy David Kleinfeld in Carlito's Way, or the brooding, dangerous Jimmy in Mystic River.

As the action progresses, we ask the same questions Keller does: who is this woman?  Is she religious?  Single?  Have any children?  Any enemies?  As it turns out, she isn't totally straight with him in the beginning, and in fact continues to omit important details about her past.  Kidman pulls this off without being exasperating in her evasions, and provides a compelling character for the action to follow.

If you've ever wondered what the inside of the UN is like, The Intepreter will show you: it is shot entirely on-location (the movie was shot on weekends to avoid interfering with actual UN proceedings).  The Interpreter provides adequate action and suspense for a popcorn movie with brains, but will not bowl anyone over as especially memorable or unusual.",1114646400,3,2063,4.916184971098266
1525634,5,B00005JNQA,"""The Interpreter"", directed by Sydney Pollack, is a very smart political thriller.  Critics have called it an ""old fashioned"" movie and that it is an ""old school"" political thriller in the vein of a ""Manchurian Candidate"".  This is meant as a compliment and high praise.  Being called old fashioned may not seem like a positive thing these days, but when talking about ""The Interpreter"" the critics are saying that this is a well crafted, well written, well acted film which pays attention to building a believable story where the tension builds and builds.  It all means something and has a point, rather than the flashy style without substance that many of today's films seem to be using.

Sylvia Broone (Nicole Kidman) is an interpreter for the United Nations.  She is a white African from the fictional nation of Motobo.  Having to return to the UN late one night to retrieve a bag she left in her booth, she overhears a conversation in the language of Motobo.  Before she believes she is spotted, she hears a whispered discussion talking about an assassination.  She doesn't at first know who the plot is against, but later realizes that the plotters are talking about assassinating the leader of her native Motobo.  When she reports the threat to her superiors, the United States Secret Service is brought in to protect the leader of Motobo when he arrives at the UN.  The agent in charge of this investigation is Tobin Keller (Sean Penn), a man dealing with his own pain even as Sylvia seeks to hide her past for reasons she won't reveal.

It builds.  Little by little Sydney Pollack gives the viewer a deeper glimpse into the world of Sylvia Broone and who she is.  Keller is suspicious of anything he doesn't understand and Broone does appear to be hiding something.  Little by little we find out more of what is going on in this movie and the tension grows and grows.  Younger filmmakers can learn something from Sydney Pollack.  He doesn't play all of his cards right away but gives enough that the audience remains engaged.  Nothing in this movie is clear cut, and nothing is the way we initially perceive it to be.  Pollack keeps us guessing long enough through the movie, but without insulting our intelligence by throwing swerve after swerve.  Sure, there is a twist or two, but that much has to be expected.

It must be noted that this is the first film which was given permission to actually film within the United Nations Headquarters, and the UN itself feels like a character.  Even Alfred Hitchcock was denied permission to film there.  Pollack is respectful of the mission and the work of the UN while still expressing reservations about the shortcomings and shortsightedness of the organization.

""The Interpreter"" is a very good movie, and a very smart movie.  In a week where the other big movie is the remake of ""The Amityville Horror"", ""The Interpreter"" is a welcome breath of fresh air in what has otherwise been a fairly dull season for movies.

Silvia Broome (Kidman) is an interpreter for the United Nations.  Late one night, when returning to her sound booth to retrieve belongings, she overhears a plot to kill Edmond Zuwanie (Cameron), president of the fictional Africal country of Matobo when he appears at the United Nations to give a speech.  Broome is originally from Matobo, and has lost the majority of her family to a landmine.  When she overhears the assassination plans, she is spotted, and becomes a target for the assassins too.

Secret Service agents Tobin Keller (Penn) and Dot Woods (Keener) are called in to investigate what Silvia has to say.  They are skeptical at first, but given her dislike for Zuwanie, it seems doubtful that she would make the story up.  Tobin comes with some baggage himself, having recently lost his family in an accident.  They begin to form a bond of sorts, and he takes on the role of her protector.

""The Interpreter"" is an entertaining and timely political thriller.  Zuwanie is a dictator who started out good, but became corrupted by power.  He enforced a purge of his opposition, and killed many innocents in the crossfire.

Kidman and Penn give their usual excellent performances.  The story is top notch, providing action, suspense, and even some thought.  It is effective because it is grounded in the reality of today's world.  It does not cheat or go for an overly happy ending.  This is a good, solid movie and well worth checking out.",1114560000,,1685,5.014440433212997
1525654,5,B00005JNQA,"I am a big fan of Nicole Kidman. I think she is an amazing actress and I always rush to see her films. This film once again showed her acting skills as brilliant. Her character is very believable and her accent is good too. Sean Penn also did a brilliant job in this film and I think I will be also rushing out to see his next film.

The suspense in the film is great and you are kept guessing as to what will happen. Although it's fairly easy to figure out in advance a lot of the time.  The plot is intriguing enough to keep your mind working hard to keep up with everything.

Yeah sure there is some holes in the plot. Isn't there always. By the way in response to reviewer Ter, the reason Silvia is not placed in a safe house is because they want to initially use her as bait in order to try and catch the assasain.

For me the biggest hole in the plot is how she managed to hide all night in the room that they were keeping Zuwane in after the attempt on his life. I mean come on, they lock him in a room on his own, does anybody not think to go into the room first and check if there is somebody in there. And how does Silvia know that is where they are going to keep him. Also when they were checking the building over that morning how come she was not found.

But don't let that stop you. This is a great film, well worth watching.",1114560000,,1339,3.962825278810409
1525655,4,B00005JNQA,"**Warning!  Contains spoilers**

As a director myself, my personal belief is that we don't need to see certain things, one of which is nose mucus---in other words, snot and boogers.  The scene where Kidman is crying after hearing about the death of her brother contains just such yuckies and I can't believe Pollack and/or his editor didn't fix it.  Now, having said that, the performances are excellent.  For those who think Sean Penn monotones his way through the film, in my opinion he is supposed to be deadened by the continual infidelity and recent death of his wife, and when one is deadened a monotone frequently results.  Plus, the character is supposed to be drinking heavily at times, which would also contribute to the way he sounds.  I found Penn's performance both touching and believable, and the makeup was perfect: he looked haggard and miserable, like a guy who can't sleep and drinks too much.  Kidman delivers her usual sensitive and intelligent performance; she's the Meryl Streep of her generation.  Is there anything the woman can't do?  She is superbly talented.  She has the accent down pat as well, which I found important in that it gave the character great believablity.

Now for the plot holes.

It's always interesting to me how screenplays are given short shrift---remember the old adage about the Hollywood starlet who was so stupid she slept with the screenwriter, not knowing he had no power whatsoever?  If the story has holes the size of Cleveland in it, I don't care how wonderful the performances,  direction and production values are, the intelligent viewer---and by that I mean someone who can relate to ""House of D"" and ""Driving Miss Daisy""; in other words, character- and story-driven as opposed to CGI- and sex-driven films---you just don't believe in the movie.

For example: the initial premise is downright silly.  Let's see: Kidman as Silvia Broome going back to get her flute happens to overhear people talking about an assassination plot?  Get real!  Why would you discuss such a thing in one of the most microphoned and videotaped buildings in the world?  Another thing: they've obviously seen her (because Kidman's character turned the light on briefly), so why don't they kill her immediately?  Hell, they can find out where she lives with no problem, which leads to another plot hole: why on earth wasn't she secreted in a safe house as soon as they believe that her tale of the assassination threat is real?

One last gripe: actors in film work largely with their eyes, so Kidman's scraggy overbleached hair falling all over her face drove me nuts.  Same thing with Penn's partner Dot Woods; I seriously doubt a female Secret Service agent would have all that hair flopping in her way.

I will give the screenwriter credit for not falling into the most annoying trap of all, which is having Kidman and Penn fall in love, with all its resident fish kissing---whatever happened to kissing like you meant it, as opposed to seeing how far you can open your mouth and inhale somebody's tongue?  Not to mention languid backlighted shots of them having sex, etc., etc.  At least they were wary of each other, although they did respond to each other compassionately as people.  Very, very few films have ever shown male-female relationships except in the tiresome context of sex.  ""Norma Rae"" is one of the few which comes to mind.  This continual male/female sexual context might best be explained by the fact that a lot of screenwriters are males who wouldn't know what a non-sexual friendship between a man and a woman was in the first place---unless one or both of the parties were gay.  As I have often observed over the years, Hollywood is a horny stupid town.  No wonder poor David Duchovny's first film is being vilified.

Now for the good things:  Pollack's direction is sure-handed as usual.  Shooting at the actual UN adds authenticity, and the bus bombing scene I thought was first-rate, with no silly lingering shots of blood, death and gore.  Pollack, a highly intelligent director, has always been known for his imagination and restraint.  The performances as mentioned previously are excellent with the exception of one scene: that in which Penn yells at Kidman, saying she is lying, was obviously to me picked up and filmed before the actors had time to work up to pitch; the pacing is noticeably off.  It's the only lapse between the two actors in the film.  The small characters were much more fascinating than usual; Catherine Keener, who played Penn's partner was consistently interesting.  I'd like to see more of her.  And it was great that she was neither beautful nor ugly, which is what you usually find in casting.  In real life most people are ordinary, and to me film should reflect that.  The various members of the Secret Service team Penn headed were refreshingly minorities who tried hard and weren't perfect.  Minorities in my opinion are vastly underused in film.  And I particularly liked the surprising revelation at the end that Silvia Broome had had a love affair with Ajene Zola and that it ended because she was white.

All in all, it was a good film with a flawed screenplay---but aren't they all.",1114473600,3,5185,4.848691695108077
1525656,1,B00005JNQA,"Sean Penn comes off as a real doofus in this film.  Is he asleep throughout?  Kidman does a wonderful job as the interpreter, she is beautiful and believable.  We believe she is frightened, but Penn seems to be sleepwalking through the role of Keller.  Hello?  Somebody smack him awake, this beautiful woman's life's in danger!!

I was really disappointed in Sean Penn's performance.  He failed to pull out some real emotion and compelling character.  He's not even believable as the grieving widower.

Sadly, a forgettable film. Kidman's performance was wasted.  No action, slow pace, needed more suspense, a car chase, or something.  I've seen episodes of Fox's '24' that were more of a thrill!  The bus scene was THE highlight of the film.  The Interpreter is surely not in the class of ""Three Days of the Condor"", ""Ronin"", or even ""Bourne Identity"".",1114473600,8,853,4.922535211267606
1525657,3,B00005JNQA,"This film was good. That's right, just good. The storyline is suspensful and manages to do just enough to suck you in, but I wondered aloud to my friends if they, or I, would even remember the plot after two months. I doubt any of us will.

The reason for this is Sean Penn. I have always liked him, especially in roles like The Thin Red Line (which was perfect for his gloomy demeanor), and Mystic River, as well as his ability to direct (Indian Runner and The Pledge come to mind). But here, alongside a strikingly beautiful Nicole Kidman (who does a wonderful job in this film), he loses his audience as a Secret Service Agent.

There are long lapses of time when Sean Penn does little more than manage to move a single facial muscle and speak above a monotone. Some would say this is classic Sean Penn being loosed and allowed to act the way he has admittedly craved, but I disagree. Wanting him to move past that classic depressed Sean Penn resonance, I found myself disappointed once more, because Sean fails to do so again.

A good film but certainly not what the critics are calling it.",1114387200,7,1094,4.432835820895522
1525658,4,B00005JNQA,"Late one night, Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman), a United Nations translator, returns to her booth high above the floor of the General Assembly, to retrieve a bag she left behind. She overhears two men talking about an assassination plot involving the genocidal dictatorial leader of Mobatu, a small African country. The next day, she learns that this same leader is coming to the UN to address the General Assembly on Friday. She reports what she heard and Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) and Dot Woods (Catherine Keener) are the Secret Service agents assigned to the case. At first, Silvia assumes that she is going to be protected; she thinks that the men having the conversation may have seen her. But Keller soon explains that it is the Secret Service's job to protect the foreign dignitary in question. Not her.

So begins ""The Interpreter"", the new film from Sydney Pollack. Pollack is the director behind such films as ""Out Of Africa"", ""Three Days of The Condor"" and ""The Firm"". It is one of his better films, but still lacks a few elements to help it join ""Condor"" in the top tier of great movie thrillers.

Actually, the film begins in Mobatu. It is almost eerie how closely this scene resembles some of the recent headlines out of Iraq. This memorable prologue helps to quickly and efficiently establish the people and place the remainder of the film is about.

Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn are both great. Kidman plays Broome, a woman who grew up in the small country of Mobatu and then lived in a number of European countries, making her a perfect candidate for a UN interpreter. At one point, Keller says `she is the UN' referring to her training and upbringing. Throughout the story, Kidman walks a fine line, balancing opposing parts of her character, which is quickly called into question. Keller has trouble believing that she overheard two people, late at night, talking into a microphone, on the floor of the General Assembly, in a language that only Silvia and a handful of others understand, talking about the assassination. As he digs further into her background and motivations, Kidman walks a fine line between victim and instigator, diplomat and revolutionary, helpless and in charge. These shades of her character are revealed gradually, as her back-story unfolds, lending a subtlety to the performance. Also, the film occasionally backtracks, as Keller's investigation proceeds, and Broome's character changes even further. The character and the performance are equally complex, adding great depth to the story.

Penn plays Keller, a by-the-book agent for the Secret Service who has just returned from leave. He is experiencing some troubles in his life and his boss (Sydney Pollack, in a cameo) isn't sure he is ready to return to work. Preferring to stay busy, he wants to be out of his apartment as much as possible, going so far as to sleep on the couch of his office. The interesting thing about this character is that Keller is experiencing the same sort of feelings Broome has experienced many times in her life. In one of their conversations, she reveals how the people of Mobatu deal with similar problems and this seems to give Keller a degree of comfort.

Thankfully, the filmmakers shied away from making these two characters lovers. Keller does bond with her, but he simply wants to protect her and figure this whole puzzle out. Naturally, Broome is drawn to Keller, but only because he is her protector. It is a relationship of convenience and provides some interesting conversations.

Catherine Keener's Dot Woods is a memorable sidekick. Keller's partner, she is the equivalent of the comic relief character that all agents of the FBI, DEA, Police department, etc. have in films. But Keener's character is more intelligent, her remarks are more deeply observed and she doesn't live to provide comic relief. Woods is the longtime partner of Keller, it almost seems as though they can read each other's thoughts, and she knows a lot about him and his problems. This knowledge is what leads to her `witty remarks' and they also help us to learn more about each character.

All of Sydney Pollack's films are created with the highest quality craftsmanship. They look great, the editing is superb, and the locations are real and believable. These films are crafted with skill and love by people who love to make films. ""The Interpreter"" is no exception. The fact that Pollack was granted access to film within the UN speaks volumes. Hitchcock didn't get this when he was making ""North By Northwest"". This adds an element of authenticity and interest to the story, especially when Keller and Woods uncover security problems within the institution. Why would the UN allow a story about security breeches to be filmed within it's walls? Of course, the story is fictional, and I strongly doubt all of it would be as easy as it seems, but it seems a bit strange.

The film contains a terrific set piece, more or less halfway through, which serves to ratchet up the suspense a couple of notches. As we watch this scene unfold, we believe that it could happen, because all of the elements leading up to it have been planted throughout.

One complaint is that this is the highpoint of the film, and it happens too early. The final showdown at the UN is good, but doesn't have the bang that the earlier scene does. These two scenes, and the scene at the beginning of the film, set in Mobatu, serve as bookends for the more dialogue heavy scenes. Because the middle scene is so good and the other two are more subdued, it makes the film seem slightly uneven.

My other complaint is that the pace, at times, could best be described as `languid'. In ""Out of Africa"", the pace works for the story. We watch the characters build a life on a coffee plantation in Africa. They work hard and when they are not working, they relax and talk. It adds a beautiful element to this outstanding romance. In ""The Interpreter"", a thriller, the same pace slows things down considerably. Shaving ten minutes out of the running time might have improved the pace of the film considerably, and improved the film as a whole.

All in all, ""The Interpreter"" is the type of intelligent, though-provoking thriller that adults crave. If only it had delivered a little more bang for the buck.",1114387200,,6282,4.812789620018536
1525659,1,B00005JNQA,"Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman) is an interpreter for the United Nations. She speaks Spanish, French, and ""Koo"".  When she leaves her flute in a soundbooth and goes back for it, she overhears (in Koo, of course) the plot to assassinate Zuwani, the president of Matoba (or something like that, it's all made up).  She reports this, and Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) is assigned to investigate her (not the assassination, just her for reporting the call).  Keller's floozy wife died two weeks prior, but he comes back to work, looking all dark and brooding, as Penn always does no matter what.  His wife apparently left him many times, running off with other men, BUT, she always comes back to him, and she was coming back this time.  But as the guy she ran off with was driving her to the airport, he wrecked the car, killing them both. So Keller is mooning over his immature, disloyal wife, who was just going to leave him again anyway. Boo-hoo.  He directs all his anger toward the guy she chose to run away with.

What follows is a bunch of political propanganda concerning South Africa, landmines, corrupt politicians, (and when you see Zuwani's chief of security at the beginning, you know he's up to no good),murders, and Nicole Kidman's wig hanging in her face. First it's in her eyes, then out of her eyes, back in her eyes, behind her ear, in front of her ear.  Very distracting! Not to mention, she's in dire need of some chapstick.

And what's with Sidney Pollack casting himself as Tobin's boss?  That was really uncalled for.

NOT a good movie, no matter what anybody tells you. It's been done at least fifty times already.  Bobby Zoren from Law & Order - Criminal Intent could have solved this crime in less than 50 minutes, and he would have been a lot more interesting to watch doing it.",1114387200,12,1795,4.592476489028213
1525660,2,B00005JNQA,"The trailers for ""The Interpreter"" make it look like a taut suspenseful thriller, here we have a case of the trailer being better than the movie.

 This Sydney Pollack film is about a United Nations interpreter (Nicole Kidman) who happens to over hear an assassination attempt on a African dictator (Earl Cameron). After Siliva Broome (Kidman) reports what she heard the secret service get involved (Sean Penn and Catherine Keener) and soon we are engaged in a guessing game of who could possible want to kill the African leader. So far pretty straight forward, right? What I dislike about the movie though is as it's setting up its characters we can tell who's going to do it. At first we think the movie is just trying to make us beleieve it's ""so and so"" but by the end of the picture we see that it actually is ""so and so"". The movie never should have done this. What this did for me was lower the suspense of the situation. The movie is actually leading us down the right path.

 Another problem I have witht he movie is Nicole Kidman's performance. She has a murky past, and at first agent Keller (Penn) isn't sure he can trust her. She's keeping too many secrets. Now clearly the movie is doing this to create suspense and have us suspect Kidman but the way I interepreted her character was as someone who is non-cooperative and making things harder than they have to be. Kidman's character fears for her life and yet she will not fully cooperate with the police. What's wrong with her? She could die at any moment and refuses to tell the police what they need to know. After a while I lost all sympathy for her which is bad because now who does the viewer have to invest their emotions with. This cat and mouse game betwen Penn and Kidman, while interesting at first, becomes annoying.

 Now I should point out my high opinion of the talent involved. I think with the exception of Naomi Watts, Kidman is the best actress working today. Sean Penn is without doubt the best actor of his generation. While he may not have the box-office appeal of a Tom Cruise or Tom Hanks, I think he can dances circles around them. Performance after performance he demonstrates his wide range: ""Mystic River"", ""21 Grams"", and ""Sweet and Lowdown"". I also have a lot of respect for actor\director Sydney Pollack who has directed some films I've enjoyed very much. Given my opinion of the people involved you can imagine my disappointment.

 Much has been made of the fact this movie was the first to be shot inside the UN. I think once we start paying more attention to the locations than the story we're in trouble. So what if this movie was shot inside the UN. I didn't think much was made of it.

 I want to go back to Kidman's performance because I was bothered by it so. There's a moment in the film when Penn asks 'What do we know about this woman?' What's her religion? Does she vote? Is she a Democrat or a Republican? In short who is she? The question is asked but I never quite felt we get an answer. The movie spends too much time trying to hide her past and not enough time activately involving her in action.

 But perhaps I'm being too hard on the film. I don't know. There were moments when I enjoyed Penn's performance and thought the film had some suspenseful moments, a bus scene comes to mind. Despite everything I even thought Kidman has one or two good scenes and Sydney Pollack does a nice job of holding everything together. He knows how to handle the material. But overall I just can't help but feel the movie doesn't quite live up to what could have been.

** 1\2 out of *****

p.s. I noticed a goof in the movie. Pay attention to Kidman's hair in the scene where Penn questions her about a photo and a scene in a bar. Notice how her hair shifts position.

 Bottom-line: Mildly disappointing film that has a wonderful cast that doesn't quite live up to what could have been. Has some goos scenes but left me wanting more.",1114387200,6,3934,4.4430555555555555
1525661,2,B00005JNQA,"THE INTERPRETER was well-acted and pretty to look at, but the story was incomprehensible and vague. I'm still not entirely sure what the heck happened, to be honest. Sean Penn's character is given a ridiculous backstory. The centerpiece bus scene took about 5 minutes too many to set up. And the ending was a dud.

My friend Black and I tried our best to discuss it last night, but there wasn't much to discuss.

""Could you figure out what was going on?"" Black asked me. ""I got lost in it really early, and I still don't know what happened.""

Though I'm not exactly sure happened in the film, with its one to five assassination plots explained away while the pacing seemed so slow, I am sure it was not as well-done as it could've been. The movie needed more time inside the UN, a more coherent plot and a lot more Catherine Keener.",1114387200,5,832,4.42483660130719
1525662,2,B00005JNQA,"There's obviously a portion of the movie-going public that enjoys stressful  ""thrillers"".  And yes, they can be good movies if done properly.  There's a fine line between ""thriller"" and ""horror""; Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" is a good example of a film that dances along that line.  Some movies go too far toward the horror side, and are failures.  Another way a thriller can be brought down is when in an attempt to be, y'know, thrilling, it's just hard to follow.  Sydney Pollack's ""The Interpreter"" winds up doing the latter.

 Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman) is a foreign language specialist at the United Nations who overhears a whispered plot to assassinate the corrupt leader of the small African nation where she used to live.  In typical government fashion, rather than believing her when she notifies the authorities, Secret Service agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) instead ""investigates"" Silvia, which makes very little sense.  Why would someone connected with an assassination go to the authorities about it?

 At any rate, after a couple tense scenes where the Bad Guys try to silence Silvia, Agent Keller changes his mind and decides to protect her by doing really helpful things like watching her apartment from across the street.

 From the trailers, this movie looked like it had real promise, but it just never really worked.  If there is one thing that is to blame, it probably has to be poor editing.  It's not that the editing was sloppy (though I don't even want to talk about Nicole Kidman's magically switching hairstyles), but some techniques that were probably meant to be artistic or interesting were just plain confusing.  There would be two different scenes going on, and the picture apparently randomly cut between them, paying no heed to what the audio was doing.  We'd be looking at one person doing something, and hear the voice of someone who was in an entirely different place.  That's not artistic, it's just stupid.

 Another editing-related problem was that the film was just plain-and-simple too long.  There were a couple scenes (including a very climactic, tense scene) that seemed too long.  Even that tense scene went on so long that I didn't care how it ended as long as it just ENDED.

 But the kiss of death for this movie, pushing it into two-star territory, was that it phoned ahead on a few things.  This is absolutely the worst possible thing you can do to a thriller.  The whole point is that the audience has no idea what's going to happen next, and if they've been tipped off, you've already lost it.

 Without a doubt, the saving grace of this film is Sean Penn.  The guy doesn't win an Academy Award for nothing, you know.  His character is definitely the most likable in the film, and he plays it brilliantly.  There's the right combination of toughness and sensitivity for him to be conceivable as a competent Secret Service agent and a caring person.",1114300800,5,2906,4.84349593495935
1525701,4,B00005JNQA,"""The Interpreter"" is an excellent movie. Nicole Kidman plays Silvia Broome, an African-born U.N. interpreter who overhears a conversation about a plot to assassinate the dictator of Matobo. Federal agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) is then assigned to protect Silvia and crack the case.

This is a great suspense thriller with an interesting and witty plot. It's also a psychological drama of sorts: Tobin and Silvia are both coping with personal losses while trying to deal with the stressful situation at hand. Kidman and Penn are both amazing Oscar-winning actors, and they turn in amazing performances in this film.

My favorite thing about ""The Interpreter"" is that it is the only feature film that has ever been shot on location inside the United Nations. It was great to see the details of these famous and somewhat intimidating government buildings and watch this exciting story unfold. (There are also some really great scenes shot in the streets of New York as well.)

The only thing that bugged me about this movie was the ending. Silvia kind of flips out at the end of the film, and although she definitely has clear motivation for what she does, I had a hard time buying into the fact that she wigged out to such an extreme, and also that her little speech to the dictator appeared to have such a profound effect on him. The story wraps up pretty nicely at the end, though, so that one little inconsistency can easily be forgiven.

I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good suspense thriller: good movies are hard to find these days, and ""The Interpreter"" is definitely one you don't want to miss.",1114214400,90,1622,4.761565836298932

1525704,5,B00005JNQA,"Sometimes movies can be parceled into good points and bad points: the story may be weak, the acting may be pedestrian, the camera work may be so over the top that the film is lost, the editing may cry for clarity - or the opposites can occur in one or two of these categories for critique.  Not so in the case if THE INTERPRETER.  This film is a model of integrity and incisive execution of a fine script into an intelligent, highly suspenseful foray into the world of international politics as 'overseen' by the United Nations.

In the pre-title opening scenes we are plunged into the imaginary African country of Motobo and witness a tense and grisly episode that for once serves as the appetizer for the story that is to follow. Watch is very carefully and you may be able to get close to the spark that motivates the action and message of the film.

Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) is a governmental agent in charge of protecting visiting dignitaries, but as he enters the story he is an emotionally broken man, drinking heavily, an in mourning for a wife that has once again left him for another only to end up dead in a car accident: his outlook on life is bleak but he is able to maintain his brilliance in his job. His job partner Dot Woods (Catherine Keener) is able to keep him together and lighten the atmosphere with some very funny if unintentionally comic asides.  The two are assigned to the upcoming UN visit by Zuwanie (Earl Cameron), the president of Motobo, who plans to address the United Nations Assembly in defense of his controversial position.

Incidentally observed high above the delegates during a UN session is Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman), an interpreter for the UN who is one of the few who speaks Ku, the language of Motobo (she is from that small country riddled with political intrigue and strife, having been involved in the peoples' struggle for fair government until an incident altered her perception and encouraged her to leave her country and seek the higher moral issues of the UN as a voice).  After an evacuation of the UN building on a routine day, she returns to her soundproof interpreters' booth to retrieve her bag and while there she overhears a whispered statement in Ku that sets the suspenseful story into play.  Frightened she has been observed in the dark of after-hours at the UN, she eventually  tells the authorities about the whispered message that likely indicates an assasination threat to Zuwanie.

Keller and Woods question her, doubt her story as a hoax, begin to suspect her as a perpetrator and eventually believe her and are assigned to protect her.  Posted in the apartment across the street from Silvia's apartment, Keller is slowly drawn into the credibility of the intrigue and spends every moment of his broken life guarding Silvia.

Tension mounts as Zuwanie's arrival approaches and amidst all of the preparation, clues are dropped, plots and manhunts abound, and eventually played out against this background of terror Sylvia and Keller mutually reveal their inner demons and bond.  The story seers to a breathtaking conclusion that ties the ending to the beginning in a climatic scene.  The ending for once addresses not only this story but makes a powerful statement about the multiple countries around the globe that are involved in heinous genocide.

And on top of this fine story is the crowning achievement of the extraordinary acting skills of Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn.  Their spectrums of finessed qualities of character creation are as fine as any actor on film today.  Whether in individual scenes or in the electrifying interchanges together, these two consummate actors redefine the gold standard of acting. They are amazingly fine.  Catherine Keener as the sole comic relief in this tense story is the pinnacle of understatement. The entire supporting cast from bit part to major/minor role is superb. Sidney Pollack's direction keeps the story focused and propelled in the way of the masters of the genre (one aside: why must he always write himself into the screen action of his films? Megalomania?).

The musical score by James Newton Howard is riveting as are the cinematography of Darius Khondji and the precise and story-driven editing of William Steinkamp. In all this is a successful film from every vantage and will doubtless go down as one of the finest films of the year and of the genre.  Highly recommended.

1525705,3,B00005JNQA,"Physically beautiful, produced in a style that harkens back to the ""big"" movies of the 70's and 80's Sydney Pollack's (The Way We Were, The Day of the Condor) ""The Interpreter"" incites reactions from its audience for some of the wrong reasons. It's gorgeous to look at, it's directed to within an inch of its life, the actors look great and seem sincere and yet the experience is very much like eating Low-Carb Ice Cream: it just ain't the real thing...something is missing and that something is a decent script, which at the very least should make an honest attempt to piece together the disparate plot threads into a cohesive hole. No such luck: this script is muddled at best, incomprehensible at worst.
On the other hand Pollack directs a scene that is shot simultaneously on a bus, in several cars and features all the key actors that is terrifically exciting and makes you marvel at a style of film-making, both in the directing and the editing which can cause such a tremendously visceral reaction.
Also, on the plus side, Nicole Kidman as Sylvia Broome, a UN Interpreter with a dicey past, is so magnetic that your eyes follow her every move and when she begins to speak in KU, a made-up language of the ficticious Matobo people of Africa...you buy it hook line and sinker. Kidman once again plays the ice-queen but at least here she has a back-life that is mysterious, murky and ultimately spells trouble for all concerned.
Sean Penn as the Secret Service man assigned to investigate Sylvia, Tobin Keller seems to be stuck in a groove playing men who have recently lost something (21 Grams and The Assassination of Richard Nixon) or someone and are in deep despair and mourning. Here, Keller has just lost his wife 3 weeks before the film starts and he cries a lot of the time. Don't get me wrong: it's great to see this fine actor cry on the screen but Sean... do yourself a favor...do a comedy, what don't you? If  De Niro can, you can.
Catherine Keener does her, by now patented smart-ass, dry-witted best to add levity to the proceedings and for the most part she succeeds.
""The Interpreter"" is a good way to spend an afternoon: it's pretty, it has good manners and it says please and thank you. I just wish it would have been less polite and kicked ass a little more.",1114214400,3,2281,4.577017114914425
1525706,4,B00005JNQA,"Here Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman show why they are superstars and why they are where they are.  Both give excellent performances in what is an interesting if sometimes not very thrilling political thriller.

Sydney Pollack directs an interesting movie where we never really know the motives of everyone involved until the end.  He and the screenwriters do a grand job of giving us little pieces of information throughout the movie where we can, along with Silvia and Tobin, find out exactly what is going on, why it's happening, and who is doing it.  While there are moments of genuine suspense, anticipation and fear, overall the movie is more talking than action.  People who don't like talking movies may want to think twice about going because at 2 hours 20 minutes, it could be a potentially long time.  I happened to enjoy it, but I also enjoyed the interplay between Silvia and Tobin because you never really know what the cards will deal.

Fans of political thrillers will enjoy it, and it was interesting to see a little behind the U.N. doors.  This is the first movie that has allowed Hollywood to film behind the U.N. doors in the unclassified areas and it was kind of cool.  I'm at a loss of what exactly to say.  It isn't the greatest movie I've seen but it is probably one of the best released this year so far.  The acting in it is incredible (as always when concerned with these two actors) and there are enough little surprises about how the plot comes together to create enough intrigue to last for the length of the movies.  Those who don't like a lot of talking in movies may be turned off though.  Overall, I'd recommend it.  It's actually intelligent and sometimes genuinely thrilling.",1114214400,2,1707,4.6466666666666665
1525707,4,B00005JNQA,"First, adjust your expectations and open your mind and you'll be fine as you watch this first-rate movie. Secondly, could reviewers please separate opinions of Mr. Penn OFFSCREEN from his performance ON SCREEN and just concentrate on the movie, the art itself? No fair panning a movie because you don't like the way a guy conducts himself at the Oscars - or whatever. Thanks.

  Now, as to that movie... Nicolle Kidman plays Silvia, a U.N. interpreter and her motives are left somewhat unclear for a good part of his movie. Is she truly someone who has overheard what she should not and is the target of bad guys? Or is she possibly one of the bad guys, with her own, complicated agenda, one she can't own up to?

 Penn plays Keller, a federal agent who is sent to figure out what is going on and separate truth from speculation and his emotional tension is palpable. In fact, tension, suspense and paranoia are major elements of this film, which was plenty strong enough to hold my interest.

 But I was also riveted by the personal pain of the main characters. Keller has lost his wife, Sivia has lost much of her family (I don't want to give away too much of the plot so I'm being intentionally cryptic here, better you watch it unfurl yourself).

  I'm sure the movie will get mixed reviews as it wasn't without flaws (it isn't formulaic and it does challenge the viewer; some people don't like that) but I, for one, thoroughly enjoyed it. It made me think of the ramifications of all sorts of political scenarios and ""what ifs?"" and it haunted me for days, burrowing into my subconscious and bringing up ideas and impressions at odd moments. I love films like that, the ones that stay with you long beyond the drive home from the theatre.",1114128000,2,1743,4.5576923076923075
1525708,4,B00005JNQA,This movie is suspenseful and full of drama. Nothing here is black or white but plenty of gray. Nicole Kidman plays an interpreter who overhears an assasination attempt or is it? Sean Penn plays the skeptical investigator. You constantly ask yourself in this movie. Is anyone who they really are? But you will have fun trying to find out. The ending is real winner.,1114128000,2,365,4.71875
1525709,3,B00005JNQA,"The Interpreter's utopian perspective of the United Nations provided by Sydney Pollock and his crew doesn't pass the laugh test.  Never mentioned is the real one's financial corruption and consistent kowtowing to dictators.  There are even a couple of snide remarks regarding the United States' decision not to fully comply with the UN war criminal courts and how most of the world supposedly (and implicitly with good reason) hates us.  All of the UN officials come across as benevolent and more than willing to bluntly confront national leaders suspected of genocide.  These people are remarkably efficient and relentless in the pursuit of world justice and peace.  Leni Reifenstahl would have been proud. Pollock lacks her genius ability to frame a shot, but he's the late film maker's equal as a propagandist.  This film is pure liberal propaganda.  Of course, what should one expect?  Sean Penn is an unapologetic spokesman for the radical Left.  There's no way that this ideologue would not push his peculiar point of view.  How did the investors get suckered into putting their money into this project?  Couldn't they sense a train wreck in the making?

The plot is overly complicated and implausible.  The relationship between Sean Penn as a secret service agent and Nicole Kidman as the UN interpreter seems inauthentic.  Sparks do not fly between these two individuals.  Conservatives will shun The Interpreter, and liberals will feel uncomfortable with the violence. The latter prefer not to know that evil people truly exist. Political moderates will leave the theater bewildered and dissatisfied.  In two weeks, this film will be on its way to the video stores.  Nobody involved in this project will receive an Academy Award nomination.  Some things are best quickly forgotten.  This is definitely the case with The Interpreter.",1114128000,4,1841,5.179661016949153
1525710,4,B00005JNQA,"This is a pretty good thriller that can be a little long winded at times, but still managed to keep my interest throughout the two hour running time. The acting by Nicole Kidman is some of the best she has done in quite some time (a great comeback after the horrible ""Stepford Wives"" remake) and Sean Penn takes a more laid back approach to his character here and it works to his benefit. It's hard to describe this movie without giving anything away (it has a pretty standard political assassination plot), but if you are the mood for a political thriller which focuses on the character drama just as much as the thriller aspect, you might enjoy this one. I don't regret seeing it in theater, but I kind of wish I waited to see this one on DVD.",1114128000,,745,4.366906474820144
