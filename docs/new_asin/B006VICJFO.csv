8504992,2,B006VICJFO,I was really surprised by this because I expected more from both of them..felt like they didn't have much chemistry and he acted like he wanted to be anywhere but in the bedroom with her. Basically they spent the whole time trying to get her to orgasm and when it did happen (if it did)it was very uneventful. If your going to do a scene like that at least exude some passion..I've seen more on a soap opera. In one word.. disappointing.,1381449600,,437,4.341463414634147
