7076525,4,B00V4TUA74,"Just checked out London Payback after seeing the trailer and looking into the movie a little bit. I knew I recognized a few of the faces, and was up for a London crime movie that I didn't have to pay too close attention to. Let me just say that the trailer did not do this movie justice. I mean its not an Oscar winning film by any means, but its a hell of a good time. The movie is shot very well, and looks like it was made with a good bit of budget.
Matt Di Angelo plays Brad Walker, a young man just recently fired from his job who stumbles into the London underground crime world.  Matt is a very likeable actor, and has a good bit of star potential as well. I could say the same about Lili Bord&aacute;n who plays his love interest in the film. The two of them really make it an enjoyable ride, along with all the other big name supporting actors like Stephan Marcus, and Alan Ford. Overall a very fun watch. Lots of great action, and all the beautiful women didn't hurt anything!",1455148800,,986,4.162303664921466

Also known as ""The Smoke.""

Brad Walker (Matt Di Angelo) gets his walking papers in the first few minutes of the film and his girlfriend also leaves him (Anna Passey) for his friend Tom (Christian Brassington). While doing a few lines on a bowl in a nightclub he overhears about a drop-off which he copies down because...he does. Then by coincidence the car doing the drop off just so happens to stop in front of the little cafe he is sitting at...facing the license plate of said car. While the driver leaves for a quick pit stop, Brad steals the car, makes the drop, collects the cash in what would seem to be a clean get away. Not only unbelievably do the bad guys figure out it is him, but a high price mobster prostitute lands in his lap the same day.

Now I don't mind one or two freakish events in a story. Heck, if you are going for a weird cult film, the more the merrier. However this film lacks the over the top grindhouse style to get away with a bunch of stuff that just wouldn't happen. I found the main characters to be dull. Our two stooges who botched things up were the only decently written characters as the talked about films, i.e. ""Godfather vs Star Wars.""

Could have been better.

The scripts/plots are better written and the actors all seem to have better skills/training, not to mention the cinematography, brilliant! 5 stars all the way, bring on the Brits, Amazon!",1481241600,,299,4.769230769230769
8709143,3,B00V4TUA74,"It was...OK.
A lawyer (Matt Di Angelo) loses his job when someone else places the blame on him for a mix up at the law firm. This doesn't seem to bother him all that much. He also doesn't get too upset when his girlfriend breaks up with him immediately after he loses his job.
While in a bar, the lawyer overhears two gangsters discussing a money drop. He just happens to come upon the go-between for the money drop and steals his car. He shows up at the prearranged meeting place for the drop and casually steals the money.
Then when he stops in front of a hotel, a desperate woman happens to jump in his car begging to be rescued. Without giving too much away of the story, there are way too many coincidences in this film.
The two gangsters are a little like Laurel and Hardy working for the mafia. They have no problem knocking off just about everyone they come in contact with while bantering back and forth about their life. The London police force must be on vacation, because they are nowhere to be seen in this movie.
The acting is OK. There is some nudity and violence, but not a lot of blood. Closed captions are available.",1479600000,2,1134,4.35377358490566
