2990498,5,B000WS6YAA,I work in tourism and to watch those movies is the next best thing to travel there.  Is a fascinating region where people emigrated to EUROPE and the rest is history !!,1331424000,,168,4.25
2990499,5,B000WS6YAA,"As far as I can tell, THE COLOR OF POMEGRANATES is the only major sufferer here. Its colors are faded, which I wouldn't have known if not for YouTube, which has a much more vivid version(with more ornate titles). POMEGRANATES' mandatory and often-mispelled subtitles don't help, either(the other DVDs have optional, correctly-spelled subtitles). YouTube has the other movies, too, straight from Russia, but these DVDs match them, more or less. But for POMEGRANATES, what a difference. On this collection, you're basically watching POMEGRATES on film left out in the sun. Still, of these four movies, it's the one I've watched most, poor quality or not.

Of the other three, SHADOWS OF FORGOTTEN ANCESTORS is easily the most popular and acclaimed, but I've watched THE LEGEND OF SURAM FORTRESS and ASHIK KERIB more, maybe because they make less sense and there's more to wonder about. After several viewings, I don't know which I like more. Both sort of hypnotize me.

I'm amazed by the extras. Over these four discs, you get extensive interviews with Paradjanov(they're not always happy), a great short film by him, footage from his unfinished last movie, an interview with his wife, music videos, trailers, etc... They're not just extras; they're often historical documents, informative and fascinating.

You might want to discover Paradjanov one movie at a time, but if you want them all, this is a great way. But what happened to POMEGRANATES?",1306972800,30,1446,5.11864406779661
2990500,5,B000WS6YAA,"You haven't landed on this page by accident, let's face it.  Paradjanov isn't a household name: it's a fair bet that if you've got this far you already know a little about the measured pace and challenging approach taken in these films. So let's get to the point: these movies, particularly the celebrated 'Colour of Pomegranates' are what cinema should be all about: a perfect marriage of imagery, light and sound. Sensual, strange amd moving in a way so few films are. They belong in your collection and you can buy this set with confidence.

That said, the state of the prints is very poor - the colours are washed-out and lacking in the vividness they so obviously deserve. Of course, had Paradjanov chosen to please the thugs running the Soviet state his masterpieces may have been better cared for, but then again, had he done that they wouldn't have been masterpieces!

Hopefully one day a fresh print of these gems will surface - prteserved miraculously from the ravages of the Soviet tyrants. Until then, these will do.",1306022400,22,1028,4.764044943820225
2990501,5,B000WS6YAA,"The box-set has 4 movies, spanning pretty much the entire career of Paradjanov (who unfortunately for him spent a lot of his life in the soviet jails). The first two are absolute masterpieces, but I care much less for the last two. This being said, both the ""colour of the pomegranates"" and ""shadow of the forgotten ancestors"" were one of a kind experience and I would highly recommend both to anyone interested in movies that stretch one's conception of cinema and art. That's pretty clearly a big if, but if you recognize yourself as such a person, go for it without any hesitation (and maybe start with the pomegranates rather than the shadows: this is not the chronological order, but this would in my view make for a gentler introduction)",1259020800,18,743,4.723076923076923

8225386,5,B000WS6YAA,"Paradjanov is an entirely other kind of cinema, a category entirely of his own. His films resemble dream-visions of icons or persian miniatures, come to life - static tableau become dances, movements as ritualized as Noh drama, exquisite colors flooding the screen. His films are visual experiences, dream-visions or hallucinations, not narratives. He was considered subversive, imprisoned, his films banned by Soviet authorities; definitely not ""socialist realism"".  I think he might have had similar troubles in the west - artists and filmmakers loved his work, but definitely too weird for Hollywood. ""No commercial potential"", as the song goes - but one of cinema's greats",1419292800,3,676,5.5

8225389,5,B000WS6YAA,"The films of course are masterpieces, all of them. But the crown jewel of this collection is undoubtedly The Color of Pomegranates. I am just not sure how this film came through with the worst quality out of the all four films in the set, when there is a better quality copy on YouTube. I accidentally caught the film on a basic TV channel through my antenna, which had an unbelievably good quality and colors.
Overall, not taken the quality into consideration, I am very satisfied and happy to own these films.",1381276800,4,511,4.565217391304348
