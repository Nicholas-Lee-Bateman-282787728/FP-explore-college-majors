7968297,3,B00006G8KP,"XPW really is the red headed step child of Pro Wrestling
While it had various problems it also did a number of things right
This was the first XPW event i seen and truth be told it didn't surprise me at all
This very first commercial tape should've never been released to the public it should've just went to various tv markets to try and sell time on there network
If Global Force Wrestling released there ""sales pitch""/promo for there wrestling it would look a lot like this

During the Pro Wrestling Monday Night War
wrestling was at a peak where it was drawing huge ratings for both USA and TNT and the internet was young
ECW already had a number of there original talent jump ship for better pay and actually getting a pay check
Rob Zicari. aka Rob Black had a working relationship with Paul E. and ECW
Black broker deals to bring the likes of Jenna Jameson, and Jasmine St. Claire in ECW
There working relationship dissolved
and Rob Black decided to open his own Pro Wrestling Promotion on the west coast
That promotion would become Xtreme Pro Wrestling
The Revolution will be Televised was Black's and XPW introduction for fans into this new sleazy pro wrestling company
Keep in mind while WWF and WCW were going at it in a ego stroking contest
Extreme Associates were able to have a handful of there commercial tapes (VHS) reach the top 10 on Sports list
There commercial tapes had actual artwork and looked ""real"" unlike ECW that always had cheap commercial tapes on blank VHS cassettes in a white cardboard box and XPW tapes were sold nationally in all types of stores (Not just online retailers)

XPW also gets a lot of hate from ECW fanboys (As good as ECW was it was far from perfect
XPW fixed the problems ECW had for years lighting and HQ cameras)
This commercial tape was just a set-up/introduction to a true outlaw promotion

History of the XPW Title
Profile of Lizzy Borden
Profile of Johnny Webb
Profile of Messiah
Profile of Supreme
Profile of Kristy Mist
Chris Candido vs. Homeless Jimmy
Johnny Webb vs. Steve Rizzono

Fans over think this very first release
It's a long promo for XPW tv and there ""Brand"" it's not meant to be the best and brightest event
It's a introduction plain and simple it will not blow you away but, it'll give you a idea what XPW was trying to be from the start",1457913600,,2307,4.498806682577565

7968299,2,B00006G8KP,"I Love XPW Wrestling,
But it's not what I expected for.
Before I bought this video, I thought it would be many matches in this video:
Hardcore matches, single matches etc...
But no, the only full match was Chris Candido match for the XPW World Champion,
the other matches was Highlights.
The rest of the tape, tells the history of the XPW TV series, and the wrestlers of XPW.
If you are looking for XPW history & wrestlers info, this video is for you.
If you are looking for matches, buy another tape of XPW.",1368403200,,508,4.3578947368421055
7968300,3,B00006G8KP,"Let me first tell you that I'm a very big XPW fan but this is it. They have only been around for 4 years abd that history? the tape itself is not that bad, but at least spend your money on a live event. This is the run down.
