8222768,3,B000WCU7NQ,"Since my first viewing of the documentary BLOOD, BOOBS, and BEAST I had grown quite affection for Don Dohler.  His movies weren't the best in the world, but they had a certain charm.  I've since watched NIGHTBEAST and ALIEN FACTOR, and in the documentary there were various behind the scenes for DEAD HUNT.  I was very curious about this movie, so I wanted to see more of his work.  And literally being his last, I had to watch it.

First, the movie is well photography for its time (2006).  For all the years Dohler had been filming, he did an exceptional job.  Also, the editing was quite effective.  It had the feel of a Hollywood movie, but on a shoe-string budget; A really thin shoe-string.  The make-up and even the visual effects showed Dohler as a true pioneer of the DYI world.  After all, he published the magazine CINEMAGIC; a ""how to"" in filmmaking in were people like JJ Abrams learned the process.  But, with all that some glaring issues remained.  The acting, with no disrespect, was atrocious.  A couple of actors weren't half bad, but others were more than half awful.  The writing also left much to be desired.  The premise of a group of journalists attending a horror convention and getting killed off was interesting.  But for some odd reason, it took place in a warehouse. Maybe it was because of budgetary reasons, but it's one I'll let pass.  So, a deranged killer starts killing because of receiving bad reviews of his movie.  This reminded me a lot of Vincent Price's THEATER OF BLOOD, but not quite executed. The dialog was so expositional that it would have been better to watch it with the mute on.  Having the character's tell me everything in the what, when, where and how is painful.  Since most of these actors can't act, silence would've be golden.

Even with those issues, I still was able to watch this movie In its entirety.  To even have affection for a filmmaker like ED WOOD, I can hardly sit through PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE or even GLEN OR GLENDA.  Bad isn't always good.  But, DEAD HUNT is a hundred times better than some of the Indie movies I've watched.  This movie in particular is for Don Dohler fans.  I know Joe Ripple co-directed it, but Don Dohler overseen it, which included the final cut.  Before Don's passing, he stated he was ""sick of the exploitation stuff and Dead Hunt would be the end of that.""  As it stands, he hated the original ending (which is available on the DVD) and re-shot it; Without the BOOBS.  In retrospect, I thought the original ending was very Hitchcockian, but executed badly.  Don was correct in re-doing the ending, and I'm glad he did or I wouldn't have like the movie as well.  He wanted to distant himself from some of the gratuity that plagued his latest work and he was able to do that with Dead Hunt.

Watching the BBB documentary was the selling point in why I bought this DVD.  I will go back and watch the rest of his movies and enjoy their heartfelt, low budget approach.  Don Dohler wasn't the best moviemaker, but he did leave a lasting impression.  I think of him constantly and wish we had crossed paths. To me, that's the saddest part of all.",1373846400,2,3137,4.511545293072825
8222769,5,B000WCU7NQ,"From screenwriter Eric Strauss and filmmakers Don Dohler and Joe Ripple comes a fresh horror slasher with overtones of THEATRE OF BLOOD in it. This independent film is better than a lot of the bigger budgeted counterparts out there. If you like fun slashers, you need to pick this up!",1363219200,,284,4.7
8222770,1,B000WCU7NQ,"Terrible writing, terrible directing and abyssmal acting. The concept is good - a gathering of horror genre media interests getting their just deserts, but this production is just plain horrid. The pausing between each line of dialogue, the boring kills (which occur off-screen by the way), taking a minute and a half to show a scene where someone asks where the bathroom is...uh.",1211241600,,380,5.0476190476190474
8222771,5,B000WCU7NQ,"DEAD HUNT is the great Don Dohler's last film, and it is a perfect coda to his stellar career in filmatic horror mayhem!  Humor and mystery make this gruesome slasher movie great fun to watch as a group of horror conventioneers navigate their way through a dark warehouse trying to evade a blade-wielding slasher who truly enjoys the wetwork. Inventive murder scenarios keep coming at the viewer, who will most likely be watching through their fingers as the body count escalates.  Great cast, including co-director Joe Ripple as a harried husband and real-life scream queen, Leanna Chamish, doing her sexy thang as a fictional scream queen named Raven. If you are a TimeWarp fan or simply a horror afficianado, you will love DEAD HUNT!",1197331200,4,736,4.92741935483871
