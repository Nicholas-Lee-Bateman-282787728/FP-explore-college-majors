8524258,5,B0082NOUTE,"I bought this as a gift for a friend. He enjoys it immensely. He plays it over and over. He invited me over to watch it  one evening. I have to say, as a person who has no interest in the game, and therefore, don't have a clue how to play, it was interesting.

The way the game is explained, as to beginners, actually gave me a rudimentary understanding. If you are interested in learning how to play the game, and also some advice on the best strategy for beginners, this may very well be the video for you. It's a great place to start. No wonder my friend plays it over and over.

My friend also played two other craps instruction videos for me. While they were pretty good, none came close to the beginner's point of view like this one did.",1416614400,,743,4.181818181818182
