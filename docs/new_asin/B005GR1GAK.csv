Patch is an eccentric genius and a saint who seems to have transcended the self centeredness most of us mortals still struggle with. Who else would have ever thought you could go to the worst areas of the world and help by clowning! He is radical. Like Jesus. He feels very strongly about injustices and frustrated that the injustices continue and the apparent indifference of those in power that could help but don't. I wouldn't vote for him if he ran for office but I certainly see his point. On everything he said. He has a point. Watching this film willl change you. Patch Adams will change you for the better if you let him. He seems to have overcome his ego! Good for Patch. He's an amazing human being. He has a beautiful heart.",1435363200,,877,4.4875
