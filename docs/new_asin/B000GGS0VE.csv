8131991,1,B000GGS0VE,"This product was listed as ""Like New."" However, the cover was extremely worn and white when we received it. It did not look the image here at all! In addition to the misrepresentation of the product, when I contacted the seller. They indicated they would not give a discount and this was an an item that cost $23.99--that was clearly not like new! I would recommend not buying from this buyer--bf__bh__007.",1392249600,,406,4.732394366197183

8131993,5,B000GGS0VE,"I have been certified in Spiral Dynamics and use it extensively in my ministry, and have done some organizational consulting. The model has unlimited potential for use in a variety of organizational settings. This DVD brings the material to life, mainly because of the presentation style of Don Beck. I do think that a basic understanding of the Spirla Dynamics model is helpful before you view, as this is not a primer approach to the material. I would rate it as an excellent adjunct to the book or a well-presented live introduction to the material.",1167868800,7,552,4.821052631578947
