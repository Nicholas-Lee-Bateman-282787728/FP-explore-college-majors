8578811,1,B00C91WI7Q,Love this season of my lifelong favorite show. Couldn't get this to play on my players.,1431043200,,87,4.5
8578812,5,B00C91WI7Q,I got seasons two three and four from this seller and hope to purchase season 5 if they keep their remaining copy until Friday and it's great I also purchase season 1 from another buyer but that is not the point these DVDs won't work on a standard U.S. DVD player you will need a DVD player such as an Iview to watch these discs which I own subtitles and audio can be customize in the main menu you can turn subtitles on or off and set audio to English or Thai I prefer English but hey that is just me. Overall if you have a universal DVD player like an iview and enjoy this fantastic cartoon buy it you won't regret it.,1401235200,,620,4.048780487804878
