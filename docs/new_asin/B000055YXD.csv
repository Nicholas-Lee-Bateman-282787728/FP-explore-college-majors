7931319,5,B000055YXD,"Greatest movie of all time. This isn't my opinion. It is a fact. Before you leave this dimension and go on to the next one, make it a point to watch this one.",1381104000,,158,3.8181818181818183
7931320,3,B000055YXD,"The ghoul stars Peter Cushing and John Hurt. It's not a great
movie for classic horror mystery fans. Cushing gives his all
as usual but John Hurt's character as a psycho was just annoying.
the movie isn't horrible but I would say only for Cushing fans like me.",1370736000,3,260,4.4375
