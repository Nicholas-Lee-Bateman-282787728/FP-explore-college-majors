If you're new to this series this is probably not the best place to start.  Go back to the early years and give a few a sample.  Even then, don't be surprised if you are lukewarm to the program upon first viewing. This is a show that grows on you with each episode. The first time I saw LOTSW I was underwhelmed... but I watched a few more and it began to grow on me. A few more and I was hooked!

While the cast is different than the early years it's still one of the best and ""gently"" funny programs available.

Now what I'm looking for is a full release of the first two series.  Sure, there are a few episodes of those series available but I'd like it all!",1445040000,10,4179,4.445026178010472
7052885,5,B00UMDF51E,"Took a while to get this.  Wish more would be developed for Region 1.  Would love to have the complete series and know other folks who would, too.  Anyone listening????",1444262400,9,168,4.533333333333333
7052916,5,B00UMDF51E,"Enjoyed the 2005 Last of the Summer Wine, as all other versions.",1505174400,,64,4.416666666666667

7052919,5,B00UMDF51E,I have the entire series from now back to 1976 . It is not a knock you off your seat comedy but it is more laid back and easy watching. It is about several old timers who grew up together and never got old. They constantly get into trouble with their wives and friends and others through doing thongs they thought they still could do. You need not be an Einstein to get through these because the jokes are light but funny for most.  A lot of things like trying to skate board or drive a stick shift or just going fishing.  They all mean well but nothing goes right for them.  We enjoy them as  an escape from todays fast paced comedies where you miss so much if your not hip enough or up on the street lingo.  If you buy one  buy one video from the 1980s. I think that was their funniest years but if you don't like the video you bought you won't like any of them.  It is for the older crowd and the one who have been there before. I would say those who are 50 or older would appreciate them more. .,1486166400,,999,3.9899497487437188

7052925,5,B00UMDF51E,"There never has been, and I suspect there never will be, a series like this.  As others have mentioned, it takes a few episodes to get to know some of the characters and get a feel for them.  Once I did that they seemed like old friends, and I can't get enough of them!

Cancelling this show has to be one of BBC's biggest mistakes.",1469491200,3,332,4.076923076923077

It's sad not to have Compo and his antics anymore, but that's real life isn't it? The replacement characters do a nice job in their own right. Nora still gets harassed, Howard and Marina still hardly know each other, Cleggy still smoothes the water. The fun goes on with new dimensions.",1445472000,3,498,4.533333333333333
