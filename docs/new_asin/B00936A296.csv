8535061,5,B00936A296,"This is a great movie full of excitement.  It is a movie that will interest both men and women.  It has many scenes with a lot of flying in it.  It stars Sharon Gless from Cagney and Lacey, so you know the acting is first rate.  if you want a good movie that will maintain your interest, this is one for you.  I highly recommend it.",1393718400,3,332,3.9696969696969697
