7931642,3,B000056AWM,"In the year 2790 A.D., a giant Ark, drifts through deep space, out of control, its crew having been killed five-hundred years earlier. When the accident that killed the crew occurred, the airlocks connecting the ship's domes that housed the last survivors of the dead planet, Earth, were sealed. Cut off from the outside world,: many communities simply forgot that they were on a spacecraft. They accepted that their world was fifty miles in diameter and the sky was metal. Content with their lot, no one knew that their world was in grave danger. Without a crew at the helm, the Ark was on a collision course with a sun.
Another short-lived SF series that probably looked exceedingly good on paper, but lost something in the translation to video. The only survivors of a ravage Earth roam the galaxy in their spaceship looking for a home. What they find, however, is alien menace and alleged adventure week after week. Harlan Ellison (along with Ben Bova) created the show, then aborted the mission upon seeing its maturation
Invasion
