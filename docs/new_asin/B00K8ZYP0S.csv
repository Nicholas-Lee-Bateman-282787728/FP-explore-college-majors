8656846,4,B00K8ZYP0S,"Always loved this movie but despite having a French minor in college, Louis de Funes always talks too fast for me to understand. So I have been looking for an English subtitled version that could play in the US for a long time. I would give it 5 stars just for the scene where the Nazis do their ""chair dance"" but a previous reviewer was right when he said that the subtitles are not properly synced with the dialogue, so it's a little frustrating to watch at times.",1447113600,,466,4.306818181818182
