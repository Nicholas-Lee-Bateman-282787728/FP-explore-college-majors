fast forward button. Avoid.",1199318400,7,221,4.615384615384615
8174730,1,B000N49QQW,This movie has been butchered by the Korean censors.  I do not understand why a Korean company would bother to issue such a DVD if they are timid about showing the human anatomy. The continuous cuts are done with no regard to the the continuity so that scenes jump from one place to another constantly throughout the movie as the censors delete the offending frames. I am amazed that the copyright holders of this movie would allow this version to come out under the movie's title. It is so completely eviscerated that it bears no relation to the intent of the original film.,1188518400,22,575,4.58252427184466
