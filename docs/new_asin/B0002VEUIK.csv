2126058,5,B0002VEUIK,"Thriller: A Cruel Picture is absolutely the greatest, grittiest, sexiest exploitation/revenge movie ever made. Don't hesitate to buy this one cuz it won't be here forever. Christina Lindberg, where are you?!",1096934400,7,207,5.709677419354839
2126059,4,B0002VEUIK,"THRILLER - A CRUEL PICTURE might not live up to the Tarantino hype; it's not the roughest or the most extreme revenge flick I've ever seen. Yet, I really dug the movie. It really didn't need the hardcore penetration close-up shots (obviously using a body double). Yet, I can live with it. The movie overall is up there with other B-movie/Revenge flicks like LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT and I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE to name a few. And I thought the filmmakers did a good job with the limited budget they had. I've seen much worse filmmaking within the exploitation realm and THRILLER is far more accomplished than other ""Z grade"" movies that I like (i.e. ZOMBIE HOLOCAUST or I DRINK YOUR BLOOD). And I thought the acting was good as well in its original Swedish language with English subtitles. Granted, I don't speak any Scandanavian languages, so I can't really gauge how well (or bad) some of the performances truly are. However, the English dubbing is horrendous, as almost every other English dubbed movie would be. Like most 70's films (and foreign film in general), the pacing takes it's time telling the story. So, if you're accustomed to MTV-style of fast-paced editing, then this movie will certainly disappoint you. For me, this was one cool revenge flick.",1096416000,12,1257,4.744292237442922
2126060,5,B0002VEUIK,"I watched this movie yesterday and all i can say is...WOW!!! I could keep my eyes of the tv screen. Christina Lindberg is perfect. She goes from a shy girl to a tough woman, and looks extremely beautiful all the way through. I though the director, Bo Arne Vibenius, did a great job, and the cinematographer (i forgot the name) even better. For me, the movie wasn't slow at all, even though it doesnt have much dialogue and probably many will think it is rather slow. I absolutely love the score and all the freaky dubby effects and music. They where perfect, Its what a madman/woman would be hearing in his/her mind. The final fight scenes were enchanting. The super duper slow motion effects where a great touch. Its funny because if you keep your eyes at the guys mouth while hes getting beat up, you will see he's trying to hold the fake blood until finally he gets kicked in the head and all the blood spills out toward you( in super duper slow motion). And the ending was also perfect, paying homage to the spaghetti westerns. About the porn...its weird because it pops up out of nowhere, a extreme penetration close-up( obviously not her ) which is more funny than disturbing, but it shows to your face what is really going on and what the guy is actually putting this already disturbed girl through. Its the reason why she goes mad and gets her revenge. Like in many of the other movies made during this time, the chairs, sofas, lamps, rugs, curtains, and clothing were as funky as my grandmas trousers. I wish my house was decorated like that. The only thing I didn't like is that when she driving the car like crazy psycho on heroin, she's deliberately trying to get innocent drivers that had nothing to do with her problems to crash and die. She should have stuck to killing only those that did wrong. Or maybe she thinks they are part of a society that chose to close their eyes while innocent girls like her where being raped and hooked on heroin, making them part of the problem also. Overall, a fantastic movie with a heart. Watch it with friends.",1095984000,,2061,4.498666666666667
2126061,1,B0002VEUIK,"I expected so much from this movie! All the hype, Quentin Tarentino's admiration, exciting and flashy advertising, limited (25K) release, ability to buy it before the official release date - I've never seen anything quite like it before. So I finally got the movie, dropped everything and watched it. What a dissapointment! I knew that it was not a great filmmaking but I could not imagine how bad this movie really was. It's trashy from start to finish. No acting to talk about, no decent editing (scenes drag on forever - thank you for the fast forward button), no musical score. If the director went to study with Ingmar Bergman (as some reviews claim), he probably flunked the course. Yes, I have to admit that Christina Lindberg is cute and the color-coordinated eye patches are trendy, but she cannot act. Overall, waste of time and money!",1095984000,7,845,4.794520547945205
2126062,1,B0002VEUIK,I'd looked forward to watching this for a long  time. I wasn'expecting a masterpiece but was sorely disapponted at this inept piece of moviemaking. Bad acting. Bad direction. Bad photography. The action scenes were handled with no style whatsoever. Makes Jess Franco look like Bergman.,1095811200,4,285,5.333333333333333
2126063,5,B0002VEUIK,"Mere words cannot express my excitement for this release! ""Thriller: En Grym Film"" aka ""Thriller: A Cruel Picture"", ""They Call Her One Eye"", ""Hookers Revenge"", etc, is one of the most sought after cult classics ever. Fans have had to tolerate blurred and wash out VHS bootlegs lacking subtitles for years, but that is all about to come to an end with this beautiful presentation of the film uncut on DVD thanks to Synapse, the company who brought us the awesome ""Vampyros Lesbos"" DVD among others.

First about the film for those who haven't seen it: Gorgeous Swedish cult siren Christina Lindberg plays Frigga who cannot speak after a childhood trauma. One day she misses her bus and accepts a ride and later a dinner date, from a rather shady character who kidnaps her. After getting her hooked on heroine, he forces her to work as a prostitute, and gouges her eye out when she refuses her first client. Frigga saves her money and pays for lessons in martial arts, race car driving and shooting, before taking her revenge on those cruel customers who used and abused her and her pimp.

As the title suggests this is one viciously bleak film. From the barren wind swept Swedish landscape and eerie electric score to the hard core sex scenes and eye gouge scene which was created using a real cadaver, ""Thriller"" is a truly potent cult shocker. A lot of the credit for the films impact must go to Lindberg for her brilliant performance. She draws the viewer in right from the beginning, making us feel her silent suffering and savor her revenge. Her color co-ordinated eye patches were later ripped off for Darryl Hannah's character in ""Kill Bill"", but this is the real deal. Lindberg is a truly striking and unforgettable cult figure, carrying a shotgun and dressed all in black she is enigmatic and certainly makes shameless plagiarizer Tartino's work look pale by comparison.

As mentioned above, this is the first DVD release ever. From early reports, Synapse's DVD transfer is stunning. Not to mention that they have gone all out to give fans some great extras:

New 16:9 Anamorphic Transfer (1.78:1)
Uncut, Uncensored Version with ALL the Sex and Gore!
Original Swedish Language or English Dub Options
Optional English Subtitles
Extensive Still Galleries of Rare Behind-the-Scenes Photos, Including Many Candid Nude Photos of Christina Lindberg on the Set!
Original TV Spot and Theatrical Trailers
Outtakes
Alternate Harbor Fight Sequence Reconstructed from Rare Vault Materials
THRILLER: A CRUEL LAB MISTAKE - Rare Photos Detailing an Unused Fight Sequence Ruined by the Film Lab During Production
THRILLER: ""The Story in Pictures""
Actor/Director Filmographies
Chapter Selections

In conclusion, while this film certainly isn't for everybody, it is in my opinion the single most important cult DVD release this year! Unfortunately this DVD edition is limited to 25,000 units, so I would suggest preordering now!

P.S. 4-disc ""Dawn of the Dead"" is another must own!

UPDATE

I got a copy of the DVD today and though I'd add a few first hand comments to the review I'd already written now that I have personally seen the DVD. Hope it's helpful......

As soon as I opened the case I was imediately impressed with the gorgeous color insert containing linear notes and some nice photo's of sweetheart Chirstina Lindberg. The menu's on the disc were cool and exploring them I found all the great special features promised. The photo galleries were especially good, I really liked the cute shots of Christina relaxing on set in between takes.

The picture quality is great, while being overall a little soft (a few seconds seem to have being taken from a deteriated print) the colors are rich and vibrant. After only seeing the film on sloppy bootleg VHS copies, indeed viewing Synapse's DVD is as though viewing the film for the first time, stunning!

Once again, I cannot recommend this one enough.

Thank You Synapse!",1093046400,140,3920,4.9407294832826745
2126132,5,B0002VEUIK,"One of a kind sexploitation flick from Europe (Sweden to be exact).  Previously, Sweden was known to me through Bergman's filmography, which is far from what Bo Arne Vibenius or Alex Fridolinski...directed in 1973. The movie was so shocking at the time that it was banned in liberal Sweden for a good amount of years.  The director had to use multiple aliases in order to avoid any lawsuits or law problems.  The movie contains explicit scenes of actual sex of a couple who of course sold their services for money.  The scenes are incorporated into the rape scenes.  The female star of the film Christina Lindberg who was 23 year sold at the time can be seen on numerous occasions fully naked (nice set of breasts she has).  The director of the movie supposedly took out a life-policy on Lindberg just in case if she was accidently killed...the reason for it: real ammunition was used during the shoot-outs.  How crazy is that. Vibenius wanted to make a very commercial and successful movie (rumor has it he was in desperate need of money, for his previous two movies failed and he did not cash-out on them as he planned).  Rumor also has it, that a scene where Lindberg's character gets her eye cut-out a real body from a morgue was used in order to make it look authentic.  The movie contains great amount of slow-motion scenes, especially during shoot-outs, which at the time was a novelty. The film as the title suggests is a ""cruel picture"" in every sense of that phrase.  The picture and filmography looks cruelly done, the characters are cruel, the music is cruel, and the story line is cruel.  It is vengeance movie with an unusual amount of hate.  Q. Tarantino liked the movie so much as a young man, that his Kill-Bill franchise is loosely based on this film.

The movie starts out pretty slow...but once you get past the first 20 minutes the movie speeds up.  I personally, think that the ending could have been done better. I don't really understand the meaning behind the horse and the bad guy being buried up to his head.  A really weird death. Actually, the movie scenography and poetic ending reminded me of Deadlock (1970) by Roland Klick .  Thriller: A Cruel Picture has influenced such movies like: I Spit on Your Grave (1978), Ms. 45 (1981), and a ton of lesser known films of the rape-revenge genre or sexploitation films.",1417737600,,2343,4.63680387409201

2126140,5,B0002VEUIK,"This movie is awesome in every way and may be my favorite rape revenge film ever! Also I think sometimes adding porn footage can hurt a film in that it goes too far but I believe just like Caligula it enhanced this film. BTW it's very obvious it's not the lead actress in the X rated shots. Clearly footage from another movie or something shot after the fact. That doesn't take away from the viewing pleasure though, just and observation. The only negative thing I have to say about this film is the slow motion goes really overboard at the end. It almost felt like they were trying to extend the running time and it took me out of the film some. However I still think this is a 5 star and must watch film for fans of the this sub-genre.",1391472000,,737,4.23404255319149
2126141,2,B0002VEUIK,"I first read about this film in Shock Cinema magazine number #11 (1997).  The reviewer, Steve Pulchalski, at the time wondered why Quentin Tarantino hadn't latched onto this film.  Little did he know that Tarantino would soon ""borrow"" the plot and several images for the Kill Bill movies.  I finally got to see this uncensored version for myself and it's a good companion movie to Last House On The Left, House On The Edge Of The Park, Candy, and other revenge movies from the seventies.  That is, if you are a fan of 70's revenge rotgut.  I'm not.  At least the title is honest.  This is a cruel ugly story that would depress most people and make them want to take a shower afterwards.  To make things worse, the people who made this film didn't really care about the story.  There's plot holes the size of Montana (like how did she manage to stay one step ahead of the hired assassins?  She couldn't possibly have known they were after her.  How did she know that some of her victims would be eating at a restaurant?  Is she telepathic or something?  How did she know where her former employer was hiding? etc.) By the last third of the film, logic is tossed out the window and the viewer is merely watching one murder after another until the credits roll.  And the murders are, as other reviewer have complained, in slow motion and not just regular slow motion, I mean...really...s-l-o-w......m-o-t-i-o-n.  It just goes on and on.  The only reason this film is remembered at all is Christina Lindberg.  She looks great with her long hair and eye patch, wearing a black trench coat, and carrying a sawed off shot gun.  It's an iconic image that stays with you. It's an image that deserved a better movie.",1377561600,,1706,4.555921052631579
2126171,4,B0002VEUIK,"After being kidnapped, drugged, and forced into prostitution, Frigga uses what few resources she has left to plot her revenge in THRILLER: A CRUEL PICTURE! Swedish director Bo Arne Vibenius creates what many consider to be the perfect Exploitation film, parading images of sex, drugs, and violence in a cavalcade of perversion. Adult film star Christina Lindberg plays Frigga, who is pushed over the edge by a group of disgusting men who use and abuse her in the most unimaginable ways possible. When first he finds that she is being ""uncooperative"" with the clientele, the sadistic Tony cuts out her eye as a means of persuasion. Unbeknownst to him, however, Frigga has been saving her meager earnings to hone her driving skills, weapons proficiency, and martial arts training as she prepares for an all-out assault against her aggressors. Lindberg is as beautiful as she is deadly as Frigga, a role that single-handedly transformed her from a sexy starlet in to an action icon as she dons her trenchcoat and eye-patch before heading out for revenge with a sawed-off shotgun. The raw and gritty action sequences recall Sam Peckinpah's STRAW DOGS from just two years prior, while the hardcore sex scenes are as shocking as they are graphic. One can't help but rejoice as Frigga rips in to each of her enemies after having every last shred of her humanity stripped away. An undisputed classic in Exploitation cinema.

The uncut/unrated version is VERY explicit both on a sexual and on a gore level but this is a really good movie and yet another example of what happens when a woman is scorned.",1362960000,,314,4.413793103448276
2126175,3,B0002VEUIK,"When I was told about this movie by a friend, who is a movie collector, he didn't seem confused about whether he liked the movie or not but he knew he probably wouldn't watch it again. That's basically my take. It's a definitely a genre film from a very specific time period. The impression of the cover art is that the movie is over the top. It is, but not stylistically. There are a number of plot points that are completely absurd and I'm not sure how we're supposed to feel about the hardcore graphic rape scene which shows close ups of very unattractive penetration. It's a sadistic scene, not at all sexy to watch, and the only thing I can say about it is that it's effective in making you feel disturbed.

I don't exactly feel satisfied at the end of the movie but I also don't feel ripped off. I'm not sorry I watched the movie. It was something I haven't seen before. But as I said, it's not an experience I think I'll go through again.",1342915200,,945,4.279329608938547

If you are a KILL BILL fan, you'll love every precious second! The firearms, martial arts, and evasive automobile training are glorious! The slow-motion ""cop takedown"" sequence is sheer, bloody ballet! As for the ""hard core sex scenes"", I found them quite tedious after the first, though they do hammer home the degree of perfunctory degradation involved. If you're just looking for ""porn"", look elsewhere, as these scenes are meant more to show animalistic emptiness than to incite any lust.

2126180,3,B0002VEUIK,"I bought the Limited Edition release of ""Thriller: A Cruel Picture"" since this version is, supposedly, a limited release. This release came with a decent number of extras. However, the movie is pretty boring.

When I watched it, the first half of the movie was good as it was gradually building toward the climax (where she starts to take revenge).

However, the second half of the movie, where all the action takes place, is actually very boring. Here's why:

  -EVERY time she shoots at someone, it is in slow-motion.

  -Also, during the car chase, a few cars wreak, drift off to the side of the road, then, after a second or two, explode (in other words, the pyrotechnics are badly timed).

One last note, the hardcore sex scenes are included, like advertised, and the total running time of the hardcore insertions is about 65 to 70 seconds. To be honest, I have no idea why these shots were used at all, but if you really want to see this movie in its complete, uncut form, then by all means, buy it.",1247961600,2,1005,4.50828729281768

I heard alot about this flick and when I read that it had been re-released...I got a copy.  I wish I had not.  There is not much of a movie here at all.  Crappy acting, crappy direction, crappy lighting, even worse cinematography...and sadly crappy sex scenes.  Yes even though there is literally a penetration shot...it's not a money shot..there is no money shot in this whole out dated mess...and I would save my money if I where you.

The only thing Cruel about this picture is that I was suckered into watching it.",1235952000,7,614,4.638888888888889
2126202,5,B0002VEUIK,"Whoo-boy!  This is one pounding violation of the cinematic routine.  Director Vibenius tries to penetrate deep into your mind by mixing the arthouse with the pornhouse.  Check the EPT stick...yep, after wineing & dining your senses, he impregnates all your expectations and leaves you with dirty diapers on the brain.

It even starts off in harsh fashion.  After getting raped as a little girl, the beautiful Madeleine stumbles through her life in total silence and disarray.  After reaching adulthood, she is victimized by another devastating, life-altering event.  A seemingly nice guy offers some help, then secretly dopes her up and turns her into a heroin-addict/prostitue.  Sex, drugs, no rock-n-roll...ahh not such good times.

Thriller:A Cruel Picture is a dizzing strain of unfathomable events.  The director studied under the brilliant Ingmar Bergman, and his artistic influence is evident throughout.  This is contrasted by graphic images of sex and abuse.  It's mind-boggling, gives an extreme sense of such sad desperation and erotic disorientation.  Many people will dislike this bizarre experience, but hey, imagine how this chick feels.

Not to worry though, of course she seeks her revenge.  This is a brutal cult gem of exploitation cinema.  A must-see for fans of disturbing movies.  A must-avoid for almost everyone else.",1227571200,3,1341,5.400966183574879
2126203,5,B0002VEUIK,"Wow, what a crazy, funny, and depraved little movie this is. I've heard mixed review's about this one and I'm glad I ignored the bad one's. I can now gladly say with pride........I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!! This is the epitame of a perfect exploitation movie!
Okay, still don't believe me? Check this premise out: The movie start's out with a little girl (around 5, 6, maybe 7?) walking around the wood's with an OLD man (around 50) only to have him totally molest her in the opening sequence of the film (not graphically you sicko's!). Sound strange? IT IS! So then they show her as a young woman (now traumatized and can longer speak) who meet's a guy who then proceed's to get her addicted to heroin, by quietly shooting her up in her sleep and then forces her to prostitute in exchange for heroin! Sound awesome? IT IS! This all happen's in the first 20 minutes of the film (and some people say there is nothing offensive in this movie?!?!) I'll tell you right now at this point I was already sold as a huge fan of this movie. She then she rebel's against her pimp only to have one of her eyes gouged out in graphic detail, there are rumor's that a real corpse was used for this seqeunce.......cool. Not that I condone this kind of behavior but you have to respect that kind of audacity, and you really have to keep a sense of humor watching these exploitation/grindhouse movies. The rest of the plot is about (THEY CALL HER ONE EYE!) her training for battle and plotting revenge on all who have wronged her, and she does (in violent, slow motion detail!) Now tell me that is not the coolest premise you have ever heard for a movie?!
This is a film Quentin Tarantino called ""The roughest revenge movie ever made!"", with good reason. Any fan's of his should give this a watch at some point in their live's just too see some of his old influences. This is a highly entertaining movie made during the golden age of exploitation, when director's didn't take themselves too seriously and nothing, and I mean nothing was off limit's!

2126204,4,B0002VEUIK,"First of all, make sure you buy the red (limited edition) and not the yellow (vengeance edition). The former has footage the latter doesn't have and you are watching this genre of movie, you probably aren't into tasteful edits for the sake of decency.

The film covers the abuse, rape, maiming and disfigurement of a comely young thing who was a child sexual abuse survivor. But don't cry for her, by the end of the film she is giving as good as she gets, and all those who touched her will be sorry/killed.

The sex in the red version is rated X where you can see the special hug that adults do in close up graphic detail, so close up in fact that it seems unlikely that the actress who plays the main character was used to film it. To put it simply, sex is definately being done, but it seems clipped from some other movie that amazon doesn't carry.

The action/violence is actually poor, and in slow motion similar to the action sequences from an old Bionic Man episode. But at least it is needlessly graphic and somehow fulfilling, when the entire work is seen as a gestalt.

Besides, if one wants slick Hollywood violence where the squibs fire on time and the blood doesn't look like a Ragu product you are better served with a Coppola or Tariantino movie. But if you want to be schocked sickened and titillated scores of times in an hour and a half, this is better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. The main charcter is a deaf mute, but her violence speaks most eloquently about the sound and fury that is woman scorned.",1187568000,28,1535,4.375438596491228

If an hour and a half of mediocre acting, and disgusting sex/rape, followed by a couple minutes of slow-motion, but somehow still boring violence appeals to you, you should be in prison.  At which location, you will see first hand how messed up all the aforementioned events actually are.  Have fun with all of that.",1186099200,2,532,4.877777777777778
2126206,1,B0002VEUIK,"Yep...I fell for Quentin Tarantino's recommendation on this one. Before ""Kill Bill"", I was unaware of this film but I figured if he, being an exploitation afficianado, loved this film, I might find something memorable or entertaining here as well. When I read ""roughest revenge movie ever"", I'm thinking of ""I Spit On Your Grave"". If any movie can top that one, I will gladly tip my hat. ""Thriller"" does not come close to being in the same league as the aforementioned, at least in terms of revenge.

However, the circumstances under which ""One-Eye"" is living, the setting is ripe for brutal revenge. Afer experiencing a traumatizing molestation as a child, she is kidnapped by this Leisure-Suit Larry type of guy, looking suspiciously like Larry Dallas with a mustache. He shoots her full of heroin for a while and preps her for a life of forced prostitution where clients of all types and fetishes come to his swingin' pad to have their way with her. In fact, one such client becomes the reasoning for our ""hero"" being named ""One-Eye"". In the grand scheme of things, this has little or nothing to do with anything relevant in the movie.

After about the first 15-20 minutes, ""Thriller"" takes a turn into more of a pornographic nature with many sexual situations laid out on screen for all to see. Some situations are left out but it's hard to tell if that was done with purpose or just an oversight. The rest - consisting of anything short of oral sex, is on screen for all to witness with the occasional close-up. Pretty much nothing is left to the imagination and nothing is implied. Somewhere amidst all of this sex, One-Eye finds the time to take karate and sharpshooting lessons to eventually exact her revenge.

Nevermind the obvious questions about how she was able to find the time to prepare herself with kung fu or why her pimp would even allow her out long enough to learn these skills. If you've seen any of these Euro-sleeze exploitation movies before, you alredy know that logic eludes these films almost entirely. If you have not experienced these types of movies, the obvious lack of continuity, narrative and sense is very apparent from the outset. Still, this could have been a relatively exciting film had the big build-up to the apparent revenge had been something more than it turned out to be. After sitting through about 75 minutes of porn and drug addiction mixed in with occasional scenes of preparation to exact her revenge, One-Eye finally goes on her ""rampage"" against her aggressors and, in the end, it is no more ""brutal"" or ""rough"" than anything you've ever seen cable TV, only with much less stylization.

So yes, the big final is all a giant waste. After pulling no punches with the pornography scenes, the ""killing spree"" at the end is no more exciting or heart-pounding than something you might have seen on Hill Street Blues. Even One-Eye finally getting her pimp was a big build up to nothing. With the sex, nothing is left to the imagination. When she kills her assailant, you get nothing. In a way, this could be the result of voyeurism on my part - wanting to see grizzly death sequences after seeing so much explicit sex. But that's the point of exploitation films - nothing is supposed to be implied or left to the imagination. It's the trade-off for sacrificing story, character development, acting and all of the other traits of a good film. If you must see this movie, rent it first. Otherwise, skip to something that lives up to it's moniker.",1182902400,2,3490,4.707037643207856

1- Buy the ""venegeance"" version. Or better, don't buy this movie.

2- Cinema is an art form, accept it in its completeness. Modern people are so much used to getting their demands done in a second, some are really spoiled. A movie isn't a bigMac; you don't have the priviledge of asking the director to take the onion out of it. Eat it as it is or don't buy it.

3- The very same people are infact responsible of censore. Again, if your stomach cant take it, don't eat it.

4- Thriller is a very good representative of 1970 European movie industry in many aspects. Read about movie history first and learn why directors had to include such scenes. Thriller was made in 1974, so it was shaped by that days' environment, so think according to that. You cant ask the studio to take out the scenes nor do it yourself at home just because it doesnt suit todays culture or rather just because it doesnt suit your personal taste.

5- You sound like a retard who doesnt like a color in a picasso painting and painting it over. Editing a scene in a movie -after its completion by its director- is nothing different than painting over a picasso.

6- Learn to accept any kind of art ""as it is"". Its a form of respecting others thoughts",1179273600,5,1345,4.338645418326693

Now, I love Tarantino, but he must have been completely wasted, and/or thinking of a completely different movie when he said that.  That, or it was 1976.

This movie is absurd.  I'm sure back in 1974, it was cutting edge and over-the-top and totally controversy-worthy.  Well it's 2006 now.  Blame it on desensitization, but I'm no more desensitized than anyone else that would be wanting to watch this movie.  The hardcore pornography is the only thing that might cause a stir these days, but it won't because you'll see worse things popping up while you browse the internet on any given day.

Violent? HA! Anyone buying this hoping for a fun action-gore movie will be let down.  Here is a summation of the violence and gore in this movie:  Girl gets shotgun.  Girl shoots everyone in the gut in ULTRA SLOW MOTION with shotgun.  Girl also kung-fu's a few dudes in ULTRA SLOW MOTION with unimpressive chops and kicks and throws.  *spoiler* Girl busts a cap in a dude and proceeds to own him in a pretty cool manner involving a hungry hungry horse and a rope. *End Spoiler*.  That's all.  The effects of these people getting shottied to death are horrible.  It looks like something from a bad student film.

I give this movie 2 stars for one reason;  If it were remade today, it might be interesting.  They could jazz it up with some not ULTRA SLOW MOTION fights, some modern special effects, and some frigging music.  I don't think there was 30 seconds worth of music in the whole movie.  No ambience at all.

Plus... an above-average looking girl gets her eye cut out with a scalpel and proceeds to wear an eye patch, which everyone knows is awesome.",1150329600,7,1825,4.616822429906542
2126224,3,B0002VEUIK,"I have to say that you have to watch a lot of trash to uncover these good movies.  When you finally watch movies like this it makes it worthwhile to have watched the garbage you had high hopes with.

This is an exceptional movie in many ways but also highly flawed.  One I really enjoyed though I also have a lot of problems with it.

This is about a girl who gets raped as a child and later is kidnapped and given herion while unconscious to get her addicted to do prostitution for the man's clients and to be rewarded with more herion.

It really is far more well-acted and convincing than others of this type (such as the cheezy 'I Spit On Your Grave').  You see her in the despair of the situation all the way to the determination of learning martial arts and to use a gun.  I really felt this girl had become skilled in these.  I could tell the attress obviously had a lot of real life hard experiences and was putting something real into her performance.

There is X rated material in this.  I have to disagree that it is gratuitous.  It may be the only non porn movie containing porn that uses the porn non-gratuitously that I am aware of.  As opposed to types like ""Emanuelle in America"" which is entirely gratuitious keeping with context of the movie.  And as opposed to types like ""Erotic Nights of the Living Dead"" which the porn is gratuituously out of place and disconnected to the overal context of the movie.

The X rated material in Thriller really serves the atmosphere of the plot and is not intended to be 'hot' or erotic.  It does add to the mood of an intimate act done out of coerced reasons much better than cutting away would have.

The problems I had with the movie is I am undecided if ""One Eye"" would be allowed to leave the house and go where she wants.  The premise to me is that there are no drug rehabilitation services available there unless you have money.  I have a hard time buying them believing they have her hooked and submissive enough to the drug addiction not to inform authorities or others about her situation.  It seems unrealisticly absurd to me yet at the same time totally plausible.

A real problem this movie had near the end is that ""One Eye"" is running people off the road and when anything crashes, it explodes.  It really took away from how convincing the rest of the movie was.

There were also a lot of extreme slow motion shots at the end which also I don't appreciate.

Overall, it's a great film and well worth watching.",1149120000,3,2478,4.37417943107221

This movie was boring,  it was basically a high production swedish porn.  The death scenes were soo boring and Christina Lindberg's performance was so emotionless.

SPOILER ALERT!!!

Alright  my take on the movie.  It starts with a little girl...  she gets molested and becomes mute from the ordeal.  She grows up on a farm and one day after she misses the bus a man drives up and gives her a ride.  She goes out dinner with him and goes back to his place where he drugs her and shoots heroin into her unconscious body.  Then he pimps her out.  Thats in about the first 20 mins.  Oh yeah,  he gouges out her eye after she claws her first ""customer"" in the face.  The eye gouging was rumored to be with a real corpse.  It lasts about 2 seconds...  there was no suspense at all,  and it wasn't the least bit disgusting (this coming from a guy who threw up at that scene in reservior dogs with the ear)  the next hour is alot of sex scenes which I guess is the rough part of the movie and mondays...  her days off in which she trains to exact her revenge.  None of this seemed trialing, hard nor did she ever show an emotion exept discomfort.  Now we get to the killings.  She buys herself a car, alot of heroin so she can get through it and steals a shotgun and a handgun.  The first revenge scene is with a client.  she rings the doorbell.  This is when I got excited,  finally something interesting is going to happen.  He opens the door and then...  the movie goes into this horrible eternal slow motion that they used for every death oh and oh don't even get me started on the ever so deafening floods of delay on the gunshot that were just annoying.  Oh yeah she beats up two cops which they also put in slow motion,  and I'm pretty sure that yup the air around was enchanted to kick their asses. Oh wait I think I did see her lift her foot an inch.  She stole their car and drives around forever with the siren on and for some reason every car she passes drives off the road and into something resulting in little popping noises with lots of fire (weak explosions)  The end was almost cool  if only it made me feel something besides Oh Finally its over!

It is old and I guess it had some great thoughts,  but for me they failed entirely.  I have no idea was this is a cult classic,  I guess some people just like cheesy cheesy death and porn.",1148860800,3,2469,4.207708779443255

Now about the movie itself. It's one of the most foolish ones I've seen. Maybe in the beginning of 70s it looked shocking and rather brave, but now it doesn't work at all. And actually I can't imagine how it could work for a thinking person at that time either. A mute girl is kidnapped by a seemingly charming guy, who drugs her and makes working in his brothel where she experience nothing but humiliation and sexual abuse. Brothel owner writes letters to her parents on behalf of her, saying she doesn't want to see them anymore and that she hates them. Meanwhile, when the girl has free time, she leaves brothel to do whatever she does. Why doesn't she come up with idea to visit her parents or to go to the police? That's a mystery. And she spends her time learning martial arts, how to shoot and to drive a car. And then, seeking revenge, she kills every customer who visited her in brothel and the pimp too. How does she get addresses? Mystery. Why all the shoot-outs are in slow motion you get tired in ten minutes of? Mystery. Looks stupid. Why all the cars explode after a slight collision? Mystery. Looks even more stupid. By the way all the porn-scenes are close-ups, not a single time you see faces of actors, seems like those were just scenes taken out of some cheap porn-flicks. What are they here for? Why? Mystery.

The movie looks so naive and ingenuous I lost interest after half an hour from the beginning. And the beginning is yet the best part. When showdown starts - all you are left is a laugh.

If you are a fan of old exploitation flicks, I guess you'll like this one too. And if you didn't like ""I Spit On Your Grave"" (which is much better then ""Thriller"") don't bother with this one.

2126241,1,B0002VEUIK,"Let me start off by saying that I'm a film geek, and I especially love ""Grindhouse"" films (which this movie is NOT)... some people who review this movie really DON'T sound like they are quite qualified, so I want to say that I'm not some kid who saw the movie and got bored. It's just a bad movie. ""Sex and Violence"" sounds intriguing, especially from a foreign film from the '70s. But it's bad sex and REALLY lame violence.

SUMMARY: 30% porn, 40% slow action, 20% set-up, 10% art crap. 100% boring.

THE STORY

The movie's plot sounds like a classic grindhouse revenge movie. Well, the plot IS classic (a la Virgin Spring)... girl gets kidnapped, forced addiction to heroin, then sold into prostitution. She learns martial arts, first-class driving, and how to use firearms. Then she exacts revenge.

THE ACTING

I can't really tell how good the actors are because they're speaking Swedish but the main pimp guy seems really, really, bad. The female says nothing at all so i can't really judge. She's pretty cute, though.

THE SEX

I'm not that interested in porn, and that's what this film contains: many, many close-up shots of a large penis going in and out of a vagina (from behind). The shots are SO close up, in fact, that it's clear the people performing the sex acts are not the actors/actress in the narrative part of the movie. There is a shot where the penis ejaculates all over the vagina. It's JUST PORN. Not even interesting porn.

THE VIOLENCE

While she's training, there is a great scene where one of her trainer quickly disarms and subdues another one, as a demo. It's REALLY COOL. It lasts about 4 seconds. That's the ONLY cool action in the movie. The rest is SUPER-SLOW MOTION of people running and getting shot. I mean, REALLY REALLY SLOW. Instead of music being played, there is an inconsistant beeping noise like a broken alarm. It's like Chinese water torture. The action is very boring; she flips two police officers (KIND OF), and shoots three or four other people, all in this rediculously slow pseudo-artsy single-shot way. There is also a scene where she is running around a waterfront shooting and getting shot at by an unseen assailant. That's not in slowmo but it's still boring. The car chase scene is okay, because about a dozen cars spontaneously just EXPLODE for little/no reason. That's pretty funny and entertaining (but after that fighting crap, just about anything would be).

So yeah. Don't waste yr. money or TIME. It's REALLY REALLY BAD. Instead, check out Master of the Flying Gullitine, Blood Feast, Cannibal Holocaust, etc. STAY AWAY FROM THRILLER!",1138233600,10,2597,4.76391982182628

Anyone who says that this movie features ""terrible acting, even for a 70's movie"" is guilty on two counts.  Number one...for implying that the acting in '70s movies (the last decade in which great cinema was still fairly common in America) was generally bad.  And number two...for rating the performances of actors based on their body language alone.  Unless this reviewer is fluent in Swedish (which I'm going to go ahead and doubt), she either:

a) Didn't understand a word the actors were saying (if she watched with subtitles)

or, more likely...

b) Is basing her assessment of the actors' performances on the performances of the VOICE-OVER ACTORS who looped the movie in English (a truly unforgivable crime against cinema)

2126243,4,B0002VEUIK,"In Swedish filmmaker, Bo Arne Vibenius', work 'Thriller-A Cruel Picture' he explores the art of revenge. It stars Christina Lindberg as Madeline, a mute young woman who is kidnapped, drugged and forced into a life of prostitution by a smooth pimp. In her new life she if forced to have sex with women and with men who abuse her. When she rebels, her captor gouges out her eye as punishment. Then, her friend Sally, a fellow tom, is killed and her parents die, prompting Madeline to take action. She learns how to drive fast, do karate and shoot a gun. She also tries to get heroin on her own so she won't have to rely on her captor for her addiction. After she has completed her training, she steals a sawed-off shotgun, buys a car and goes on a bloody rampage of revenge.

Some people think this movie is too violent, and to a certain point it is, but most of the really violent sequences are more artistic than gruesome. When Madeline blows her enemies away with her shotgun or karate chops them to death it's done in slow-motion so we feel every blow and every shot. The movie is also relatively silent compared to other films and the silence is unsettling.

2126244,2,B0002VEUIK,"""Thriller-A Cruel Picture"" starts out with a young girl named Frigga who is sexually assualted at a very early age.  Due to the experience, she was left as a mute.  Fast forward years later to when she was a teen.  One day, she misses the local bus and runs into a strange man.  He takes her out to dinner and then to his place.  Unknowingly to Frigga, he drugs her and kidnaps her.  From that point on, she becomes a prostitute and a heroin addict.  Years later, she is a young adult and sick and tired of the prostitute/addict lifestyle.  She decides to pay her folks a visit, realizing her parents committed suicide due to her lack of communication.  She then goes in revenge mode against anyone who has caused her pain or goes in her way.

When I first purchased this film, I thought it would be a great revenge flick.  When Quentin Tarantino quotes it, then you notice to buy it because of high praise.  Unfortunately, it became slow pacing and borish.  The revenge part doesn't come into effect until the last third of the film.  It starts promising, but it ends up be a complete lame duck.  Even the ""pornographic"" scenes-which look inserted from an X-rated flick-make no sense and is a complete turn off from the storyline itself.

It is a shame that the beautiful Christina Lindberg had to show her talent in this mess.  Because of her performance, I have to give the film two stars.  Even though she doesn't speak a word, you can see the pain she goes through.  Her expressions and actions speak for itself.

The only reason this film ultimately only gets 4 stars from me is because it just misses on some of the sex action.  There is a strong, hard core, anal sex scene however, complete with the males climax, rare indeed for a 1974 film...I was getting all hot and bothered by a ""potentially violent"" hot sex scene when an attractive lesbian woman began slapping Christina Lindberg's face, in order to get her to kiss and fondle her breasts....but the scene was cut much too short, so then all the erotic tension building quickly subsided.

It does mostly deliver in the ""sexual tension"" department, a must for Capt. Freaky to recommend any film...the acting was not the best by anyone in the cast, and the slow motion murder sequences are tiresome and boring.  Who cares how she kills these sex customers of hers?  What mattered most was how they show her being abused by them!  And on that note, the film mostly delivers.

As always, I would have enjoyed more in the rough sex department, but it was clear to me by the ""visual condition"" of the genitals being shown in the scenes, that our star Christina Lindberg, was NOT the actual woman who was having actual sex during those few scenes.  It probably was some old, Swedish ""has been"" actress....I still give this film credit for showing real sex however, something rare in these types of films...where it is mostly poorly ""simulated"".

2126249,5,B0002VEUIK,"Looking back at the 1970s from the distance of nearly three decades reveals a number of troubling revelations. The gruesome spasms known as disco came to the fore during this decade. Then there was the clothing, a toxic mix of fluorescent colors matched with retch inducing stylistic innovations. And don't forget about the hairstyles--oh, the hairstyles! The less said about haircuts during the decade of Watergate and lines at the gas pump, the better for all involved. There is one redeeming feature of the 1970s, however, and that is the full blossoming of the exploitation film. The sleaziest films ever made came out between 1970 and 1979; films packed to the rafters with gore and highly stylized violence, often mixed with beautiful babes prancing about in their birthday attire. I thought I'd seen most of these films over the past ten years or so, but I was wrong. It took the introduction of DVD to bring forth one of the sleaziest, vilest pieces of exploitation cinema ever made in the western world. That movie is Bo Arne Vibenius's ""Thriller: A Cruel Picture,"" sometimes referred to by the title of its censored version, ""They Call Her One Eye."" Whatever name it carries, this is one sick, over the top movie.

""Thriller"" follows the exploits (and the exploitation of) one Scandinavian cutie named Madeleine (Christina Lindberg). Her life on a Swedish farm leaves a lot to be desired. The victim of a vicious assault as a child, Madeleine developed muteness as a psychological defense to the memory of this aggression. She's still mute all these years later when, as a fetching young lady, she takes trips to a doctor for treatments to restore her voice. It is while she's waiting by the side of the road to catch a bus for one of these trips that the greasy Tony (Heinz Hopf) rolls up in a fine automobile. He readily offers our young heroine a ride to the doctor, which she unfortunately accepts, but his intentions are far from honorable. Tony is a procurer of young ladies for a local harridan hotel, and he saw dollar signs (Krona signs?) after spotting Madeleine. He takes her out for a bite to eat and then convinces the girl to come back to his place for a spot of rest and relaxation. Tony quickly subdues the girl with injections of hard drugs, and keeps her locked up in his apartment for weeks on end so he can insure Madeleine develops a hardcore addiction. Sick stuff, for sure, but things get worse in a hurry when Lindberg's character heads to the brothel.

A highly sought after prize for both male and female customers, Madeleine soon learns the cost of resisting her new profession when she attacks her first client. Enraged by her imprudent behavior, Tony shows up with a scalpel and removes one of Madeleine's eyes--shown in nauseating close up. What follows is just as bad, as we witness Lindberg's character working her way through a number of customers. The camera hides nothing from us during this part of the film; it's as hardcore as you can get. Madeleine bides her time through these indignities, however, carefully stowing away money for her future plans of retribution against her myriad enemies. She eventually manages to slip away from her place of employment for classes in self-defense, learns how to shoot a variety of firearms with a trained professional, and even takes driving classes. When we finally see our gal don a long black coat to match her eye patch, we realize we're seeing ""One Eye"" about to embark on a bloody spree of revenge. She shotguns to death several of the abusive men in her life, and in one scene deals with a couple of cops by beating them to bloody pulps. Madeleine gets her revenge, but will her future be any better than her past?

Oh boy! You've not seen exploitation until you've lived through ""Thriller."" This film has every conceivable debauchery acted out in full view. I'll skip right over the scenes in the brothel and get straight to the hyperstylized violence. Nearly every act of vengeance carried out by Madeleine takes place in extremely slow motion, so we the audience can see the huge squibs blowing open and the body cartwheeling through space. The scenes involving the beat down with the cops are virtual ballets of flying fists and spurting blood. Literally. You can see huge strands of the red stuff arcing through the air after Lindberg delivers a blow to the chin or nose. The whole thing runs on for something like five full minutes. Once you get past the sleaze and violence, you'll likely notice this enchanting woman named Christina Lindberg, an actress who can truly emote with just a look or a gesture. She's an amazingly beautiful young woman who will send your heart into paroxysms of joy. It's tough to watch this charming gal undergo such brutal treatment at the hands of thugs, so don't be surprised if you find yourself rooting for her to take full revenge on these gorillas.

As for the film itself, there's some controversy surrounding Synapse's release of the film. Director Vibenius supposedly opposed his film coming out on DVD, and he fought Synapse at every turn. Nonetheless, the company performed an admirable transfer (although some footage looks quite grainy) and turned up some alternate footage and assorted cutting room floor snippets to throw in as extras on the DVD. A photo gallery, liner notes, film bios, and a huge number of trailers accompany these supplements, with most of the trailers carrying the cut version title ""They Call Her One Eye."" Any exploitation fan worth his or her salt needs to watch ""Thriller"" at some point, just to say that they've seen it. It's a strong drink indeed, but one worth taking if you like this sort of thing.",1120953600,27,5674,4.769074262461851

The ""Tarantino"" reference seems misplaced at best, as this move bears no semblance to his slick stylized mayhem and tension driven flicks.  One can compare viewing ""Thriller"" to observing the proto-art of the Neolithic era and noting some very oblique similarities of the pornographic cave carvings to the works of Rubens.

It doesnt make sense at times and is corny but it has some nice gore and even though i was prepared for the ""hardcore action"" it still shocked me when i saw it so for that i applaud it.  This movie isn't comperable to anything recent but you can see that this movie started allot of movie making trends and for that it needs to be respected.  Its possibly the best exploitation movie i have ever seen but in the end it is just that so i can only give it three stars.

2126263,4,B0002VEUIK,"OooooooK. This is not what I expected, then again it isn't an American film and I didn't realize that till later.

 I was expecting something along the lines of Ms. 45 and Shaft, but what I got was a VERY intersting plot that was ahead of its time, but could have been thought through better...

...then again this some hard core porn, which happens to only devote about 10 minutes of the movie to the porn, which it uses to illistrate the reality of the star of the movie is going through.

 The problem I have with this movie is not the porn, but rather the fact that everyone seemed to be psychic in the film. They always knew where to find who ever it was that they were after, no matter how remote, or unlikely the location, which led to a TON of loose ends in the film, but that is beside the point.

 Considering the low amount of cash that went into this film, the concept itself, and the time period which it was made, I'd say it was definatly something I've never seen before, and still holds its own over the tests of time.

 Horror and Gore fans should dig this one as well, as there is plenty of gore and interesting ways for peole to die, while at the same time, some of the death styles were WAY over done. Regardless, the eye poking scene was the BEST I've ever seen, infact Fulci couldn't ever touch this in a million years. The female actess HAS to have one eye in reality, and had to have a stunt eye in her socket or something!

Must watch at least once! Maybe twice for the sweet gina. ;)",1117324800,4,1509,4.190311418685121
2126264,4,B0002VEUIK,"The revenge flick is rarely ever pulled off with as much panache as in THRILLER: A CRUEL PICTURE.

Let's set aside, for a moment, the lame title.  I mean really!  A more appropriate title would be something like DIE!, DIE NOW! or DIE SWINE DIE, but that's an altogether different exegesis.

Essentially this is an extremely linear story that holds our attention with snippets of ultra-violence and hardcore anal action.  I'm not kidding.  Full on penetration.

So it's a fun watch, but the proportions are off.  It's about a 60/30 split on the victimization/revenge ratio, which tends to be the flaw in lots of these 70's yarns like I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE.  Jeez, how many times to you have to see a woman brutally savaged, raped and mutilated to get on board with her consequent merciless quest for vengeance.  I'd say just once and the scoundrels have it coming.  The fact is, from the first frame of flicks like this, I'm just marking time until the revenge.  The part of the film that establishes the bad guys as deserving to be revenged upon is kind of like the oral sex in a porno: It's an okay warmup, but let's get to the screwing already.

Likewise, THRILLER has us a little antsy for the revenge to arrive, and when it does finally, I must confess it's not quite as ass-kicking as I had hoped.  Alas.

Of course, it's a must see flick for anyone even remotely into the genre, and when it comes to the revenge game,""One Eye"" most assuredly puts the likes of the celluloid Punisher to sheer and utter shame.",1115856000,3,1513,4.511029411764706

Special effects such as the slow motion fight and the dodgy looking car crashes give it a real B-movie appeal.  This is certainly a film of its time.  Interestingly, the dialog is limited by the fact that the movie centres on a woman who became dumb after a childhood trauma, but this creates a unique feel that seems to work well.  Christina Lindberg is great to watch as the lead character and she definitely makes this movie worth watching.  The middle section rolls like a comical highlight reel of martial arts and weapons training, amateur rally driving, drug taking and hard core sex close-ups - each following closely on the other and then starting again.  This will probably shock some while amusing others - anyway you have been warned.  Speaking of warnings, the controversial ""eyeball scene"" seems to attract plenty of comments and yes it is a bit disturbing to watch.  Sadly the quality of the print used for this DVD is somewhat disappointing, but the DVD does have plenty of extras on it.  In conclusion, it is easy to see why this movie has achieved somewhat legendary status and whilst the passage of time has weakened its impact, it will still manage to raise a few eyebrows.",1114300800,4,1340,4.6680851063829785
2126268,3,B0002VEUIK,"As far as transgression cinema of the 70's is concerned, Thriller: A Cruel Picture (aka They Call Her One Eye) is probably one of the more disturbing if not one of the most influential films of the decade.  The film, made purely to cover up the financial failure of the director's fist film, is the quintessential exploitation film featuring stark nudity, prostitution, drug addiction, graphic violence, and unsettling hardcore pornography.

The plot is fairly simple revolving around a young mute girl, Frigga - played by Christina Lindberg, who is abducted, hooked on heroin, mutilated and then prostituted by a pimp, Tony - Heinz Hopf.  Frustrated by her dependence on drugs and sickened by the clientele she has to entertain, Frigga seeks people to teach her how to fight, shot, drive and kill.  It's pretty obvious where the film goes from there.

What sets this film apart from most exploitative fare is the lengths to which the director went for realism.  Between having the star use a real hypodermic on herself filled with saline, using a corpse for the infamous eye gouging scene, to inserting real sex footage, this film becomes far more disturbing than similar films such as The Big Bird Cage or The Street Fighter.

What really surprised me was how influential this film seems to be.  The action is all filmed in super slo-mo, which ends up looking very similar to The Matrix, not to mention the star's wardrobe, which is very similar to the garb that Neo and Trinity wear, and is practically stolen by Kurt Russell in Escape From New York.  It's also important to note this film's influence on director Quentin Tarantino, who based the Daryl Hannah character (Elle Driver) on this film's star.

Though the film is rough, slow in places and over dramatic in it's five minute slow motion action sequences, it's still very entertaining, especially for those into exploitation or transgressive cinema.",1112918400,2,1911,4.94375

If you are a severely depressive mental patient, I would not recommend watching this film.  Also, if you are offended by hardcore pornography, don't watch this film.  The porn in this movie is not meant to ""turn you on"" and is not arousing in nature; it is simply an ingredient to show you the horrors and degredation that the main character (played by the gorgeous Christina Lindberg) went through.

2126295,5,B0002VEUIK,"This film, brought from obscurity by Synapse Films, is a genuine masterpiece.

First off, I have to credit Synapse for doing an outstanding job on converting this film to dvd. Not only did they include the English dub, but they include the original Swedish dub with English subtitiles...something that Blue Underground (another cult dvd reviver) refuses to do! (????) So, you can expect great quality, and options with the audio. PERFECT!

The story is of revenge. Pure and simple. Lindberg does a great job of acting...admittedly powerful, given the fact that she doesn't speak a word throughout her performance! An example is her scene shooting heroin where you do not see the needle, but her face. I have to say, that I think it is real. Either she spent a good deal of time watching people do it, or she was in fact doing it. It just looked too real. PERFECT!

Bo's use of the viewer's imagination was the foundation. This was the most important part of the film, and I think all the other reviewers did NOT see what Bo was trying to say with this film. Your imagination is more powerful than seeing something itself. He said this with the intro, the turning point, and the ending.

intro-rape. imagine.

turning point-only friend dies in bedridden bloodbath. imagine.

ending-the horse and the rope. imagine.

Bo probably laughed at his reviews. Not many probably got it. What is sex? He'll show you. What is drug use? He'll show you. What is murder? He'll show you. What is ten times more powerful, and will remain in memory further than some of the more graphic scenes in this movie? Your imagination.

I was interested in seeing this film as I had heard that this was one of the movies that had inspired Quentin Tarintino's ""Kill Bill"" Duet. I am not in any way offended by sexually explicit material, nor am I bothered by violence. However, after watching this film I have come to the conclusion that it has no socially redeeming value as art or even as pornography.

""Thriller-A Cruel Picture"" is a sad commentary on how far Western culture has slid into decay that there are those that can find this entertaining. It is essentially the story of a child that is kidnapped, hooked on heroin by her kidnapper and than forced to work as a prostitute to support her habit and to provide enough money to train herself for revenge. The sex scenes are graphic and though the actress at the time of the filming was an adult (barely) and there were most likely body-doubles (...) this thing in my opinion is child pornography of the most brutal kind. It ties in violence and sexuality which has been proven to be a deadly mixture. I believe in freedom of speech, but just because you can make a film like this doesn't mean that you should.

2126297,4,B0002VEUIK,"I'm an incurable movie buff and just recently quit my part-time job at the local video store (Visart - great store).  So, I am surprised that I somehow missed all the buzz about this release.  I'm glad I did.  Hype always seems to lessen the experience.  I suppose that 'Thriller' does deserve the hype it generated.  Not only is this one hell of a sordid exploitation film, it also is just a cinematic oddity with an aesthetic all its own.  Certain aspects of different genres are sporadically recognizable, but the way these elements are assimilated creates a style that is, if nothing else, unique.

Like many exploitation films, the acting is often wooden and the script is sometimes laughable.  There is hardly any story and redundancy and gratuitousness abound.  However, from the very beginning of the film, there is a noticable artistic sensibility that is lacking in most films of this genre.  Visually, this film is, at times, stunning.  I guess the Swedes take their schlock more seriously.  The opening sequence is very surreal and the super-slow-motion action sequences are painterly, almost Kubrick-esque were it not for their ridiculousness.  But these sequences are ridiculous in the very best way - ridiculous spelled f-u-n.

Yes, there is eye-piercing (I hear a real cadaver was used.  Looked real to me) and there is actual penetration (this is just not at all novel in other countries) and enforced prostitution and so on.  Did I mention that this was an exploitation picture?  There is nothing about Thriller, a Cruel Picture that should offend anyone familiar with the genre.

So, don't expect anything intellectually stimulating.  Neither should you count on anything all that abrasive (it's just too hard to take seriously).  Rather, watch 'Thriller' if you are in the mood for some violent art-trash.  Much of what makes this film great was unintentional.  For instance, I don't think there is supposed to be any humor.  But so much of this movie is so ludicrous, I found myself laughing quite often.  If you keep all this in mind, you shouldn't be disappointed.",1099872000,5,2087,4.965317919075145

Picture"" was one of the greatest revenge films of all
time.  As most of you know, Quentin is the director of
the Kill Bill volumes, ""Jackie Brown"", ""Reservoir
Dogs"", ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""True Romance"".  After watching ""Thriller"",
there is no doubt that Quentin was inspired by this
purely ""ADULT"" (almost porno) revenge masterpiece of
30 YEARS AGO.  Yes, it was released in 1974 by
director Bo Arne Vibenius of Sweden.

The film features Swedish Actress Christina Lindberg
as a tormented woman who was raped when she was a
child.  I need not say anymore.  This film is
definitely not for everyone...I wasn't really sure it
was for me...but since I enjoyed the Kill Bill volumes
immensely, I just had to watch one of the films that
inspired Tarantino's legacy.

There is nothing ""family"" about this flick.
Definitely keep the kids away.  [...]

Mature themes aside, I must admit every victim in this
film deserves what he gets.  If there's one lesson
learned from this film it is definitely the
correlation between men and ""dogs"".  If men act like
""dogs"", they deserve to be taken under the wing of
animal control.  In this film, Christina Lindberg is
the Director of Animal Control.

violence...but if you ever wanted to watch a true
""revenge"" film...this three decade old classic still

THRILLER : En Grym Film is a brutal ride of revenge. That is first and foremost what this film is. But it is also a surreal Dali-esque mix of martial art film, European art film, drug film, hardcore porn, and spagetti western. Plus as an added bonus, one seriously messed-up car chase scene. As far out as all this seems, this is a really fantastic film. I ordered this with out ever having seen the film before.

I am aware of what I like to watch and figured that I would dig it. I did!!!! Thanks QT for turning me onto this flick.

I can only imagine how bad the bootlegs of this looked. Having viewed many boots of various quality over the years, I know how bad it can be. I think that this print looks fabulous. It is a low budget Swedish film from the early 1970s. How good could it look to begin with? But, I love the look, feel and mood of this type of film. I have no complaints on the visual of sound. I was very impressed. The extras are good too. There are not a lot of extras, in comparison to say LOTR EE, but I was surprised at the number of extras that were included for this film. My favorite extras were the Thriller mini-film (a 40-second, compressed version of the film comprised of frames from the film) and the Christina Lindberg nude photo gallery. This was my first exposure to Christina. A very lovely woman.

I liked the technical aspects of this film too. Cool cinematography, lighting, sets (autumn leaves), wierdo editing, costumes, eyepatches, etc. all add to the tension that builds and builds, until she explodes into berzerker mode. The story moves along and never bogs down. I totally dug it.

8033073,2,B0002VEUIK,"Thriller is an interesting and ultimately puzzling time capsule from the early seventies, a dyed in the wool, by the numbers exploitation film that explores an often traveled road in that genre, rape and revenge. A young girl, Madeline, is sexually assaulted by a stranger. She is left traumatized and mute by the experience, and fifteen years later lives a quiet life on a farm with her two parents. One day she accepts a ride from a young man into town, and is subsequently kidnapped and forced into an existence of prostitution and heroin addiction. One would think that a woman traumatized by rape would be leery of accepting rides from strange men, but never mind. She does not go into this hell without a fight. After assaulting a prospective client, her pimp carves out her eye with a scalpel. Since he had addicted her to heroin, one would think that a couple days of forced withdrawal would be just as effective discipline without resorting to disfiguring his ""merchandise"", but never mind. She seemingly resigns herself to this new life, until the suicide of her parents shifts her into a revenge mentality. Apparently her pimp was sending them hateful letters supposedly written by her, to cover up the fact that she was abducted. Secretly saving money, she begins to take lessons in martial arts, firearms, and offensive driving. How she is able to save the money, attain the freedom and mobility to take these lessons, and do so while under the continued influence of heroin is hazy at best, but never mind. She masters these skills, and the stage is now set for The Comeuppance as she goes after her clients and ultimately the pimp. While doing so she happens to take out many who had nothing to do with her predicament, but never mind.

In reviewing these types of films, it can be seen that I occasionally want to get bogged down by the details. In any other genre I would allow this, but I feel that for exploitation films, plot holes are irrelevant. Never mind all that, and focus on the holy trinity: sex, violence, and nudity. This is what was promised to rope in the audience, and this is what they are expecting. Does it deliver?

Yes. But in a very mediocre way. The action scenes all take place in slow motion, presumably to heighten mood and psychological impact, but really it's an attempt to mask choreography which is quite basic and poorly executed. When the bullets and fists fly, it had a curiously stilted and slipshod feel. Nothing really flows within the sequences. More importantly, nothing flows between the sequences. There is no sense of build up or resolution. There are no accompanying feelings of suspense. It is as simple as Figure A Enters Stage Right, Shoots Figue B, and just as dull. And when the blood flows, it looks every bit as fake as it is. The sex and nudity are equally lifeless. About a minute of hardcore footage is spliced in, presumably to spice things up a bit, but it's generic material incapable of so much as lifting an eyebrow. It's as routine as A B C, as if the producers were following a how-to manual.

And that, I think, is this film's problem. The majority of exploitation films are inarguably bad, but oftentime it's obvious that the backstage crew involved have a genuine passion for the work. They're doing it to make money, sure, but the real driving force is that they LOVE this genre. They grew up on it, and now they want to be the ones who create it. And despite the shoddy production values, the awful acting, the amateurish cinematography, and the messy editing, that enthusiasm is capable of shining through and ultimately making the viewing experience FUN. But I suspect that Thriller's crew was in it solely for the money. There is no passion to be found here, and certainly no thrills.

The one saving grace is Christina Lindberg, the actress who plays the protagonist Madeline. Even with an eyepatch, her beauty is quite simply stunning. In addition, playing a mute character is a significant acting handicap to overcome, yet she is able to command a considerable presence whenever she occupies the screen, which is the majority of the time. It's easy to see how this character inspired Quentin Tarantino for the creation of Elle Driver in Kill Bill. For this reason alone, I would recommend a place for this movie in the library of people who have an appreciation for exploitation. The film is noteworthy as a history piece and for Lindberg's presence. Otherwise... never mind.",1465257600,,4462,4.731362467866324

Movie Review: Yup! A turtle f***** a snail and this movie was the result. I love exploitation, I love revenge movies but THIS PIECE OF S*** SUCKED!! It's not a ""so-bad-it's-good"" type of movie. It's so slow paced, at the end of the flick I thought I was 80 years old. The movie wastes most of it's time with these people staring at s***, some of the grosses sex scenes I've ever seen (I SWEAR THE WOMAN'S BOOTY CRACK I SAW HAD HAIR COMING OUT OF IT! GUUUUUUUUUUUH! BLEEEEEGH!), the slowest action scenes ever (IT TOOK UP TO 2 MINUTES FOR ONE INDIVIDUAL TO DIE), abysmal storytelling and uninteresting characters. The only good scene was when One Eye was driving around, running random people off the road for no reason. That was hilarious. But this is by far one of the worst exploitation movies I have ever seen and it's sure as s*** not for it's sex and violent theme. It's just terrible, PERIOD!

In Conclusion: Screw the DVD and 1/2 a star for Thriller: A Cruel Picture!",1425254400,,1069,4.533678756476684
