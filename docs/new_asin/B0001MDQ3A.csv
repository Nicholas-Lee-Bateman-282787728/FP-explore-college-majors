Some of these encouraged me. I found Garri Garripoli's book at our library, and really liked it. I'm glad I was able to find him on Amazon, and now have his book and video. I'm pleased with both.",1300060800,,367,4.333333333333333
8014610,5,B0001MDQ3A,This is a very good tape.  It covers all of Qigong.  The best part is the last half where it's more abbreviated with enough exercises to make your body feel healthy.,1211068800,,165,4.290322580645161
8014611,5,B0001MDQ3A,I started with a sore back and after just one half of the tape version I was so feeling so light and energized.,1118016000,,111,3.869565217391304
8014612,5,B0001MDQ3A,"I have studied Tai Chi and Hung Gar kung fu for about 9 years, but I can safely say that this is one of the best (if not THE best) Qigong forms I have ever learned. If you do the complete Wuji long form, you will sweat, so it is a mild workout. Keep in mind that it's meant to ""heal"", not build muscle, so don't expect miracles. ;-) But do expect to feel something and to experience a sense of calming that you so rightly deserve. If you can spare about an hour, even once a week, then do this workout. You'll soon want to do it much more often than that. ;-)",1025395200,40,559,3.912280701754386
