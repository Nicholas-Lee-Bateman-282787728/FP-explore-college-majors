of my favorite movies so I'm prejudiced.  You must remember the time it was made and put up with some ""dated"" acting.
How could you get a better cast than Walter Huston, Walter Brennan, Dana Andrews, and Anne Baxter!

I  don't revue the story.  Again remember the time it was.  What I am so impressed with is the clarity of the pictures and
the sound.  My copy is Blu-Ray I consider it outstanding when you remember this was relreased in 1941 and is black and

2510574,5,B000E994OA,"Jean Renoir fans won't see much of his directing technique in this swamp, but a great film nonetheless. Standard story with a great blu-ray print that looks fantastic. The sound is ample while the extra features are not....however, well worth the price for this seldom seen film with some interesting scenery in an actual swamp, which was considered quite different at the time....definetly worth a watch or two....good stuff....",1339891200,6,429,5.231884057971015
2510575,4,B000E994OA,"Jean Renoir's first American film has been treated as a mere footnote in the director's career for decades, yet Twilight Time's Blu-Ray edition of SWAMP WATER ought to earn this unusual collaboration between the French filmmaker and Darryl F. Zanuck's 20th Century-Fox regime some new admirers.

Scripted by ""Stagecoach""'s Dudley Nichols, ""Swamp Water"" is an interesting, if not entirely successful, melodrama set in the backwoods of Georgia where the Okefenokee Swamp comes off as a character all its own (despite having only several minutes of location shooting produced there; the rest of the film was shot on soundstages and on the Fox ranch). Dana Andrews stars as a young man trying to break free from domineering father Walter Huston's clutches; he's able to do so by venturing into the swamp after one of his beloved hunting dogs goes missing. En route, Andrews runs into escaped fugitive Walter Brennan, hiding out after having been unjustly convicted of murder, and the two forge a relationship - one that also extends to Andrews courting Brennan's daughter (a young, and fetching, Anne Baxter).

Renoir's direction is superior to the material at-hand here, and as Julie Kirgo points out in her package essay, while the director's vision was compromised by the studio (resulting in Renoir using numerous stand-bys from John Ford's stock cast, as well as having to suffer an ending re-shot by producer Irving Pichel), there's enough of Renoir's artistry on-hand to mark it as far more than just an early `40s programmer.

Twilight Time's Blu-Ray presentation is exceptional for a film of its age: the 1080p AVC encoded transfer is crisp and filled with detail, while extras include an isolated track of David Buttolph's dramatic underscoring.",1337040000,18,1751,5.180212014134276

2510593,4,B000E994OA,"Dana Andrews, Walter Brennan, Anne Baxter and Walter Huston all turn in good performances in this Okefenokee Swamp adventure,  It is the story of a young man venturing into the swamp to find his missing dog and ending up finding the dog with a fugitive that has been living in the swamp for over five years.  He befriends the man and then partners with him trapping the swamp.  While he vows not to tell that the man, Walter Brennan, is living in the swamp - it eventually comes out and troubles galore arrive.  This 1941 film was remade in 1952 and called ""Lure Of The Wilderness"" with Jeffrey Hunter and Jean Peters in the Dana Andrews and Anne Baxter roles.

8107577,5,B000E994OA,"(continued)  The entire cast was great.  Walter Brennan has a meaningful role as something other than a 'geezer' ... Dana Andrews (always one of my favorite actors!) was great as the young man who ventures into the scary Okefenokee Swamp seeking his lost dog.  When asked why he would risk his life going into that awful swamp, he looks incredulous and simply says ""That's my DOG!"" (Dog-lovers don't need any other answer).  A teen-aged Anne Baxter is truly stunning in her debut film!  Walter Huston is ... well, Walter Huston ... which is to say always good.  An early Ward Bond plays a credible bad guy.

8107580,4,B000E994OA,"Swamp Water is a black and white 1941 film based on a 1940 serial from the Saturday Evening Post that was later turned into a novel by Vereen Bell (1911-1944). In 1952 it was remade as a color film called Lure of the Wilderness.

It tells the story of life in a small village on the outskirts of the Okefenokee Swamp. The main plot features a young boy (Dana Andrews) trying to gain his independence from his authoritarian father (Walter Huston). Along the way he meets an escaped convict (Walter Brennan) who lives in the swamp, falls in love with a young girl (Anne Baxter), and deals with the towns scoundrels (Ward Bond, Big Boy Williams).

There are wonderful performances from John Fords favorite character actors (John Carradine, Russell Simpson) and much of the music and location settings are reminiscent of a Ford film, although the camera is more fluid.

Dana Andrews, Walter Huston, Anne Baxter, and Walter Brennan appear in this film and played together in 1943 The North Star.

Dana Andrews (1909-92) appeared in over 100 films, including memorable roles in The Westerner (1941), The Ox Bow Incident (1943), Laura (1944) and The Best Years of Our Lives (1946). He seems a little old to be playing a young boy in this film, though his performance is OK.

Walter Huston (1884-1950) was churning out films in the 1930s, sometimes as many as 8 in a year. His performances were relatively undistinguished, even if some of the films (e.g., Gabriel Over the White House) were hits. Huston got better as he got older, and he was nominated for an Oscar in 1937 (Dodsworth) and 1942 (Devil and Daniel Webster). The year after this film came out he was nominated again (Yankee Doodle Dandy) and won in 1949 for Treasure of the Sierra Madre. He does his usual credible job.

Walter Brennan (1894-1974) won 3 Oscars for Best Supporting Actor (Come and Get it in 1936, Kentucky in 1938, and The Westerner in 1941) and was nominated for his work in Sergeant York (1941). We know him best for his Emmy nominated role in the TV series The Real McCoys, and his film comedies (The Over the Hill Gang) or as the grumpy side kick Stumpy in Rio Bravo, but he was equally capable of playing the villain, as he showed in The Westerner (1940), My Darling Clementine (1946), and again In How the West Was Won.

This was one of Anne Baxters  (1923-85) first major roles, just before her role opposite Joseph Cotton in Orson Welles The Magnificent Ambersons (1942) and her top billing for North Star (1943). After this she won the Oscar and the Golden Globe for The Razors Edge (1946) and was nominated for an Oscar for her role as the ambitious Eve Harrington in All About Eve (1950). In 1956 she appeared as Queen Nefertiri in The Ten Commandments which was probably the peak of her career.

 Variety said French director Jean Renoirs first job for an American company, its something less than an auspicious beginning. Giving him a story dealing with a segment of the US population with whom not even many Americans are familiar appears open to debate. The NY Times was less kind calling it a melodramatic mess about Georgia crackers.

1941 was a terrific year for films  Citizen Kane, The Maltese Falcon, Sergeant York, How Green Was My Valley, Meet John Doe, Buck Privates, They Died with Their Boots On, The Sea Wolf High Sierra, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and A Yank in the RAF.

The film is better than many critics said. The scenes in the swamp are great and you get a real feeling for the swamp as a character. Andrews dog Trouble is a central character and there is lots of dialogue about the proper way to consider the lives of animals. That being said, kittens are drowned, and animals are killed and skinned.

Well worth watching for the swamp footage and the performances.",1471651200,,3770,4.632683658170914
8107581,5,B000E994OA,"VERY GOOD! I liked a lot this 1941 drama by renowned French director Jean Renoir. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Okefenokee Swamp, Georgia, a very poor rural area, somewhere around 1910. A young, rather likeable but somehow rebellious man, Ben Ragan (Dana Andrews), lives still with his father, Thursday Ragan (Walter Huston) and his stepmother, Hannah (Mary Howard). Hannah is much younger than her husband, but she and Thursday seem to be very happy together  however, her former beau, Jesse Wick (John Carradine) still didn't renounce his claim and even if he is not welcome he sneaks to try to see her when the husband is not at home. Ben wants to move out soon and be on his own, once he marries Mabel MacKenzie (Virginia Gilmore), the most desirable (and proudest) local girl.

The dangerous swamps are mostly avoided by locals, as quite a few people died there, victims of treacherous mud holes, quicksand, venomous snakes, alligators and even an occasional panther (puma) attack. Because people don't usually go there, a wanted murderer, Tom Keefer (Walter Brennan), was hiding in Okefenokee for the last five years. Nobody knows it, not even his teen age daughter Julie (Anne Baxter), who once her father ran, was taken as house servant by a local shopkeeper Marty McCord (Russell Simpson) and his wife. Local sheriff, Jeb McKane (Eugene Pallette) would certainly give a lot to know Keefer whereabouts

One day however Ben Ragan wanders into the swamps, looking for his old, loyal but a little bit silly dog Trouble. He does it even if his father forbid him to do it and two local bullies, Bud Dorson (Guinn Williams) and Tim Dorson (Ward Bond), mock him publicly, warning that he will never come back. Ben's entering the Okefenokee will set in motion a dramatic chain of events and at that moment the film really begins

This is a short film (88 minutes) but incredibly well organised and managed - the description above, a kind of entrance of artists, covers like first five minutes! Jean Renoir was already a great master of cinema when he began his Hollywood adventure and it is immediately visible in ""Swamp Water"". The perfectly rhythmed, perfectly organised story, with pace of events successively accelerating and decelerating according to needs, is just a sheer pleasure to watch. The story is interesting, we care for (almost) all characters, there are twists and surprises, there is a good mixture of heartbreak and joy, etc. etc.

Tons of talent are present in this film. Dana Andrews and Anne Baxter were destined to make great careers and in this film they SHINE! Barely 18 years old Anne Baxter is especially impressive, in her only fourth role in cinema (but to be fair, she already played theatre, since she was 13). Many other great actors appear here, many already experienced veterans, like Walter Huston, who just before this film was the Devil in the amazing ""The Devil and Daniel Webster"" and Walter Brennan, who today is mostly remembered for one of his last roles, the amazing performance as Stumpy in ""Rio Bravo"". John Carradine, aged 35 at that time, was also already a veteran, but he was going to keep acting until his death in 1988 - his last film opened posthumously, in 1990.

At 38 Ward Bond was also already a very experienced thespian and as we all know he was going to act in many more famous movies, until his very premature death from heart attack in 1960. Special mention goes to Eugene Pallette who plays the local sheriff  he is nowadays mostly remembered for his role of Friar Tuck in 1938 ""Adventures of Robin Hood"" but he also aced his comic roles in ""The bride came C.O.D."" and ""Heaven can wait"".

The treasures of this film are many. There is drama, romance, tragedy, tension, humour, betrayal, jealousy, stink eyes, two bonny lasses, romantic rivalry, a barn dance (followed by an unavoidable fistfight), a skull on a cross, doggies and last but not least, the Okefenoke Swamp itself, definitely a great place for a wilderness adventure of Dungeons and Dragons. There is also the local spake of deep rural Georgia, which is simply AWESOME))) But the best thing is that Jean Renoir took a terminally American story and added a little bit of French touch, creating a uniquely tasty mix. I don't of course know if it was his intention, but for my personal taste there was a little bit of Maupassant naturalistic short stories about peasants in this film  and it added some good Beaujolais to ""swamp water""...)))

This film is based on popular novel ""Swamp Water"" written in 1940 by Vereen M. Bell, a young officer of Us Navy, for whom writing was just a hobby but who sure knew how to spin a tale Tragically, he died in World War II. During the famous battle of Samar (""the last stand of tin can sailors"") on 25 October 1944 he served on escort carrier USS ""Gambier Bay"", which was sunk by Japanese battleships (including the super battleship ""Yamato"") and heavy cruisers. Bell survived the sinking and was rescued but succumbed to his wounds the next day. He was then barely 33 years old A great talent was lost that day...

I LOVED this film and I will definitely keep the DVD for another viewing! A thing to see ABSOLUTELY! ENJOY!",1463529600,,5215,4.7630121816168325
