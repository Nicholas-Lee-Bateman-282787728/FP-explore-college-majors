8457123,5,B0054WPWQG,Its an idie film. low quality camera cover up by making it look like film from the 70's. As an horror filmmaker I love it.,1444521600,,122,3.92
8457124,3,B0054WPWQG,It was not as good as I hope for.  It is not worth the money to buy if you wants a good porn movie.,1438473600,,99,3.125
8457125,2,B0054WPWQG,"Jessicka (Elske McCain) is apparently a mute and she is kept locked up (at times) by her cousins who sexually abuse her and rent her out. About 15 minutes from the end she goes on a killing rampage.

At no time is she ""rabid"" as in rabies and the title is clearly a poorly conceived rip-off. It interjects old films into the production which was a plus and a justification to shoot with old inferior grainy film. The Troma name is on it, but their presence is only in the extra features, which also include a fully nude slide show of Elske McCain, if you are into that sort of thing.

The horror/slasher aspect of the film doesn't pick up until the end. It appears a sequel is in the works.

Guide: F-bomb, sex, rape, nudity (Elske McCain, Cisiany Olivar) 2 Stars for the nudity.",1417132800,,779,4.358620689655172
8457126,1,B0054WPWQG,"This has got to be the worst ""movie"" ever made. The lack of a storyline, poor sound quality throughout, grainy footage, amateur acting and horrible camera work, all add up to make this a complete waste of film. The story is based on a woman who is kept in a dog kennel cage in someone's garage and she's led around on a leash like a dog. She's routinely abused and happily submits until she begins killing the abusers. Every person in the film seems to think that it's perfectly normal for a full grown woman to be walked around on a leash and literally treated like a pet. I feel that my IQ actually dropped by 20 points just by having sat through this crap to the closing credits. My bad. Thankfully I didn't rent or purchase this garbage. Don't waste your time watching this movie if you consider your time precious. The best thing about this flick was ""The End"".",1363392000,4,866,4.385093167701863
8457127,1,B0054WPWQG,"This is the case of a sexy dvd box used to sell a dregg of a movie. The ""star' is a slightly overweight actress who plays a retarded girl treated like a dog,really,with collar and everything. A sister whose as demented as her brother comes to stay with the brother and is slightly more sympathetic but not much. She dresses Jessica up and then confuses her when she takes her along on her date. Jessica snaps,foams at the mouth and kills her sister. Her brother shoots her like a rabid dog. Nowhere as interesting as it sounds. Only republicans could symnpathize with the main characters",1330646400,7,587,4.6
8457128,5,B0054WPWQG,"Well...
About the actress who made Jessicka...I didn't know Elske McCain yet.
She's very cute and very good actress as well.
She steals the scenes she appears, in fact SHE is the movie!

As a puppy ,she speaks with her eyes, and even makes that dog expression when she is taken to ""do her business"" in the lawn...
She made that exactly serious face dogs make when they are pooping! Fantastic!

Do not forget to watch this movie! This is awesome!",1329004800,6,445,4.481481481481482
8457129,5,B0054WPWQG,"This movie gives you the creeps. The filming style sets the tone right off with the dog barking a dark omen of things to come. The almost Shakespearean tragedy about to unfold reminds me a bit of movies like ""Carrie"" or ""Rosemary's Baby"". The acting is superb. Elske McCain doesn't only play Jessicka, she becomes Jessicka, and makes the viewer sympathize her plight. Trent Haaga plays an Unforgettable psycho about to burst. He seems to be the Mad Hatter of indy horror. Loved this Movie.",1328918400,3,489,4.764705882352941
8457130,5,B0054WPWQG,"This movie is not for the weak stomached, or people expecting academy award style film. However if you enjoy blood, beautiful women, and old style grindhouse films. Buy this and enjoy Elske as Jessica.",1328918400,3,201,4.9411764705882355
8457131,1,B0054WPWQG,"Low low low budget garbage. I read a review and I was very curious. She isn't shown nude nearly as much as she could have. The rape scenes are G-rated at best. The acting...what acting? SFX what SFX? Gore....cheap and not enough. Tame in violence and nudity which is a shame since the main chick has an awesome rack! Trash. I cant believe Troma put their name on this. AND THAT IS SAYING SOMETHING. Avoid or you will toss in the trash or sell back on here, like me.",1328832000,12,465,4.235955056179775
