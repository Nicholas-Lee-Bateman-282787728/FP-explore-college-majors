3526381,5,B001D6OKUQ,"This was one of the best performances/productions that I have seen of this great opera, which I saw as recently as last year in Strasbourg. I would highly recommend it.

The singing is first class. It is well acted all round and the staging/production very appropriate and effective. I loved the witches.

Despite the Amazon page showing it as 4:3, the copy they sent me was 16:9 and it is printed as such on the slip inside the box. I pointed this out to Amazon, who told me I was wrong. I am not - it is definitely 16:9. Don't allow Amazon's error to stop you buying it.",1302307200,,572,4.287037037037037
3526382,4,B001D6OKUQ,Dmitri Pittas gives a heartrending account in his lead tenor role. Mr. Lucic is a promising Verdi baritone. Ms. Guleghina seems past her vocal prime but gives a harrowing account of Lady Macbeth.,1287878400,,195,4.9393939393939394
3526383,4,B001D6OKUQ,"The main reason to acquire this DVD is for the superb orchestral conducting and the excellent singing. James Levine, one of the finest Verdi conductors active today, paces the performance perfectly and illustrates many of the felicities of the composer's scoring of this attractive earlyish work.

Maria Gughelina is in excellent voice as Lady Macbeth, though I sympathize with the fact that she has to sing some difficult passages lying down. She also is lumbered with some dreadful frocks. Macbeth is well sung although there is some strain in the high notes.

The updated production is eccentric and tends to loose focus in the later acts. It does not however detract too much and the viewer gets a good idea of what Verdi is aiming at.

The sound and picture quality are very good. Warmly recommended with minor reservations.",1239926400,8,829,4.9496402877697845
3526384,5,B001D6OKUQ,I found this DVD of Verdi's Macbeth entertaining and look forward to replaying and enjoying this version of Macbeth many timws !,1228262400,3,128,4.863636363636363
3526385,4,B001D6OKUQ,"In reviewing the Barcelona Opera DVD in which Maria Guleghina also appears as Lady Macbeth, I've already expressed my view (not shared by everyone here) that ""Macbeth"" is one of Verdi's underappreciated operas. Forgive me if I quote what I said there rather than rewrite it: ""Verdi took great source material and used it to compose an opera with choruses that range from spooky (the witches) to weary and heartbreaking (the people of Scotland); arias for Lady Macbeth with vocal leaps and pyrotechnics that are Mozartian in difficulty; a great marital spat duet in which Lady M's diabolical hold over her husband is revealed; a final aria for the title character that garners sympathy for him, cold-blooded murderer though he is. The score is taut; not a wasted note.""

As in her Barcelona Opera performance, Guleghina's intensity and utter commitment to the role go a long way to make up for her vocal difficulties. She struggles with the coloratura requirements of the role  and is sometimes sloppy in her execution of the music, allowing her fiery acting to interfere with her singing. Verdi said he didn't want a Lady Macbeth with a beautiful voice, but that didn't mean he wanted one without discipline. (Listen to a Callas CD of Lady Macbeth's arias to hear that perfect combination of ""ugliness"" and discipline that Verdi was looking for in Lady M's voice.) But despite Guleghina's vocal shortcomings, hers is a Lady Macbeth that will be seared in your memory long after the opera is over; such is the power of her stage presence.

Zeljko Lucic does a fine job as Macbeth, although his performance is not as good as that of Carlos Alvarez in the Barcelona Opera production. Alvarez has a deeply mature, burnished baritone voice and creates a more nuanced Macbeth. Lucic's voice is rather generic and dry, although (as is the case with Guleghina) his vocal inadequacies are compensated for by strong acting. By the end of the opera, Lucic has turned Macbeth into a tragic figure.

John Relyea (who seems to be in almost every Met production these days) has a powerful deep bass-baritone voice. He excels in Banquo's aria. He may be kept from starring roles due to his stiff demeanor onstage and an irritating tendency to sing out of the side of his mouth.

It's a treat to see James Levine at the podium, conducting with great energy and precision right from the opening notes of the overture. The orchestra responds in kind, making Levine and his musicians one of the highlights of the production.

I liked the updated 20th Century setting, reflected in the sets and costumes. After all, Shakespeare's play is still one of the best political thrillers ever written. It's timeless: the masses suffer while the powerful plot and scheme.

If you love this early Verdi opera as I do, then I highly recommend this production despite its shortcomings.",1224633600,24,2852,4.868041237113402
3526386,4,B001D6OKUQ,"I must admit at the onset that I had no intention of seeing, let alone buying this set, but the local PBS station KCET broadcast it and since I was not planning an outing I stayed in and watched it. I should say at the outset I have only seen this opera twice on stage, with San Francisco,1955 (Borkh and Weede--an under used and utilized singer) and in Vienna in 1972 with Christa LUdwig and Kostas Paskalis, one of the great evenings at the opera).Of course I owned the Verret performance and had heard the EMI edition of Callas. It is best to draw a veil over the Suliotus and the second Verret recordings. A friend lent me a VHS of the Glyndebourne performance with Paskalis and Barstow. I don't hesitate to state that in my pantheon of great performances this DVD is still the leader of the pack in spite of shortcomings and elements that can be criticized.

But on to the DVD at hand. First off I had great reservations about the Lady. I was aware that the ""bel canto"" elements of the vocal line were beyond her capacities so it came as no surprise that parts of the Brindisi were smudged as it were; this occurred elsewhere but then at times she could surprise you and bring it off. What she did have was a committment and involvement that was absolute. Considering that she is not in the first flush of youth and that she has been singing a fairly heavy diet of spinto and dramatic roles she has more voice that I would have expected. At the time of her training in Russia I have no doubt that she was not exposed and trained in the kind of singing that was common in 19th century Italy (It doesn't appear to be taught now there either.) I first heard her Lisa in the Maryinsky's Pique Dame. Not terribly exciting, but the overall performance was dull. I was shocked to read that she was going to sing Abiagile in Nabucco, your basic voice killer role. My recollection is that she was ill that Saturday and Susan Neves deputised; I remember turning in late and and not knowing of the replacement was stunned; here was a very good voice. Of course in true Met fashion Ms. Neves has not returned. But the fact that she was singing the role at all seemed to augur for a short career. Well I do have to eat my words: she is not the second coming nor a contender for the greatest living spinto but she made the time I spent with her more than satisfying. Her partner Zeljko Lucic was totally unknown to me. I seem to recollect that he was a substitute, but I could be off base. Considering the puacity of Verdi baritones he more than filled the bill. At timess the tone could be dry and unresonant, but again there was no gainsaying his devotion to the role and his qualification to sing Macbeth. No, it was not in the same league as Paskalis but then there is not exactly an abundance of this kind of voice.

Levine and the Met orchestra were supberb, the chorus as well. The production has more than a whiff of regie about it (what were the chairs doing in the sleepwalking scene? It's true that she was given support but terribly unnecessary). The witches appear as mid twentieth century ""demons"" and the requisite leather coat/jacket was worn by Macbeth. Niggling points that don't detract from a positive addtion to the discography (can I use that word with regard to DVDs?) of this opera.",1221696000,10,3297,4.4032786885245905
3526387,1,B001D6OKUQ,"This was one of the most disappointing of all the Met broadcasts. I love this opera, but this performance was extremely disappointing with lackluster singing and unimaginative sets.",1220659200,11,181,5.5
3526388,3,B001D6OKUQ,"For the record, I'm writing this review without having watched the actual DVD, which hasn't been released yet and which I don't plan to buy, I'm basing it solely on having seen the HDTV broadcast at a local cineplex several months ago. Under those circumstances, perhaps I have no right to write a review in the first place, and I'm sure some readers will write comments telling me this. So be it. I'm not reviewing the DVD, I'm reviewing the production and the opera, which are the same as what I saw in the theater. Even though I am a huge fan of Verdi, and the Met, and James Levine, I found this performance to be nonessential viewing.

I admit, Macbeth is far from being my favorite Verdi opera. The main reason, Verdi wrote this during his early period, while he was still adhering to many of the elements of bel canto style(at the same time reshaping them into his own unique sound, sure, but at this point he hadn't quite achieved a total transition). Well, bel canto, a rigidly structured, florid, and, let's face it, occasionally shallow style of music is a poor match for vintage Bard, particularly his darkest play. I'm convinced that if Verdi had waited a few more years and written an opera of Macbeth around the time of Luisa Miller, Stiffelio and Rigoletto, he would have given us a great opera. If he'd waited even longer and done it near the end of his middle period, or even in his late period, he might have produced his greatest masterpiece. There is evidence to support this. He actually did revive the opera around the time of La Forza del Destino, and it is the revised version that is generally performed nowadays. The new music(the battle scene, the ballet, Lady Macbeth's act two aria) is probably the strongest music in the piece, it is certainly more mature than the rest of the opera,  more suited to the menacing mood of the play. It's a shame Verdi didn't compose a completely new Macbeth during this time, a loss, in my opinion, as great as his failure to produce a King Lear, but that's how it goes. What we're left with is more a curiosity than a great opera, a weird, unsettled attempt to challenge the conventions of the time, adapt them to heady and brooding material that demands a more sophisticated brand of music. The attempt is largely unsuccessful, but still quite entertaining when taken in context, and in the right mood.

Given that this is a rather eccentric opera, something of a misfit in the Verdi canon, a transition between his boisterous, unapologetic bel canto hoe-downs(Nabucco, Ernani) and his more thoughtful and mature work, then a camp approach might be just the right way to present the material, and if so I should really like this production. But for some reason I don't. If you like the idea of the witches stomping their feet while dressed as bag ladies, if you like the idea of Banquo strutting around with a machine gun, wearing an artillery belt, if you like the idea of Lady Macbeth's boobs practically hanging out of her sagging wardrobe(well, okay, I'll give you that one), then this Macbeth is for you. Personally, the whole thing struck me as silly, even more silly than Lady Macbeth shrieking about summoning demons from hell in a shrill, manic cabaletta, or she and her husband plotting a murder in perfect bel canto harmony. Maybe that's the problem. The opera is over the top and unwieldy enough on its own, it doesn't need the embellishments of a stage director and set designer and wardrobe head trying to prove how clever they are. This is dumbed down Verdi, not to mention Shakespeare, and I'll politely take a pass.

Musically, this is a good performance, though not legendary. Maria Guleghina's performance as Lady Macbeth(without even taking into consideration her lack of underwear) will do nothing to dispel the controversy that surrounds this tempestuous singer. Either you love her  wild abandon, her primitive shrieks, the feisty way she attacks a role with spirit and venom, or you don't. I enjoyed her as Abigaille in the Met's DVD of Nabucco, and I enjoyed her here. The other standout performance comes courtesy of John Relyea as Banquo, who sadly bites the dust midway through the second act and only reappears as a non-singing spectre. Relyea is one of those Met stalwarts, reveling in the smaller, non-glamorous roles and making them his own(even his Nightwatchman in Meistersinger is distinctive). Maybe someday he'll snag some of the meatier bass-baritone roles, but if not he'll still have a stellar career to look back on. The whole cast is good. And Levine seems to be having fun with the score - even if it isn't among Verdi's more substantial, Macbeth still offers a certain freshness, a diversity of musical ideas in which to luxuriate and indulge. I was disappointed, however, that the usually cut-resistant maestro chose to do without the ballet, which was part of the revised version and ranks among my favorite musical moments in the whole opera.

This production is worth seeing, once, but, for me at least, it isn't worth spending the money, especially with far superior Met productions from this past season being released simultaneously(Manon Lescaut, Peter Grimes, La Boheme). It's good to have the Met back on track in terms of regular broadcasts, and more plentiful DVD releases. It's also good to have another Macbeth on DVD option. I really wanted to love this: Verdi, the Met, Macbeth, Levine. Sorry, but it doesn't quite make the cut.",1218931200,50,5453,4.771186440677966
8291982,5,B001D6OKUQ,"First off, unlike the other reviews I've read here, I don't know opera. That is to say, this past season I discovered the Saturday Met radio broadcasts, and found them so intriguing as to decide to start purchasing operas on DVD for an occasional home opera night. I do know something of theatre.
As for this production, I've given it 5 stars. I do this as an appreciator of theatre entering the experience without preconceived notions. I found the performances riveting. This productions concept of the witches was especially frightening. Equally frightening was how quickly I was seduced by the performance by Maria Guleghina as Lady Macbeth. As for William Shakespeare and Mr. Verdi, My profound thanks.",1449619200,,706,5.042735042735043

8291985,3,B001D6OKUQ,"I fully agree with the other 3-star reviewer.  This production is ridiculous.  It is not just that the witches are dressed as  ""Tuareg camel drivers"", there are also too many of them; and too many murderers to kill Banquo and his son (in spite of which, the kid does escape).  Also too many children throughout the production; you are reminded of that other scene in the Magic Flute where Papageno (Simon Keenlyside) has jumped into Papagena's bed, and the children are coming to them one after the other ; here you have Macbeth and his wife in a double bed with the witches bringing the children (""First a little Macbethgeno, then a little Macbethgena"") only to remove them almost immediately.

As often happens nowadays, the director  ignored the libretto.  ""They  vanished"" says Macbeth after his first encounter with the witches; actually, they are sitting there, all of them (pretending to be invisible?) -- and they do not have any facial hair.  Later on, we see the witches brewing something and the libretto lists all the ingredients, but there is no cauldron on stage; nevertheless, Macbeth notices that ""the cauldron has vanished"".  The cauldron, actually was pre-empted by Lady Macbeth who is taking a bath in it, with her clothes on, trying to wash her hand.  The banquet in Scene 3 becomes a cocktail party:  no table and no chairs for the guests; everybody is standing.  As for ""Birnam forest"", the leafy branches that are supposed to hide the attacking army have been reduced to bare sticks (no branches, no leaves); this, we are told in the notes (page 6, just before the synopsis) is ""reminiscent of those which the witches waved in the first scene -- a further symbol of their controlling influence.""

On the back of the Blu-ray case, you can read that Liudmyla Monastyrska is ""both imperious and subtle""; well, she does try hard to look imperious, but is not convincing.  I did not notice much subtlety either.

If you are looking for a good Macbeth, you may want to look at the filmed version by Claude d'Anna (1987), with Leo Nucci and Shirley Verrett (conductor: Riccardo Chailly; Deutsche Grammophon; subtitled in English, German, French, Spanish and Chinese).",1392681600,4,2183,4.859459459459459
8291986,5,B001D6OKUQ,"I wanted to get some operas that I wasn't familiar with and when I saw this DVD with very good reviews I thought that this was going to be a good selection.  I also knew the two main characters of the cast from other performances. Simon Keenlyside was very good as Macbeth, He showed the ambivalence of this character very well,  for instance he did every thing in his power to be a king even to get involved in commiting murder and having some remorse for his acts. He also was tormented by his dreams as a result of some of the premonitions received by the witches. Opposite to this performer was Ludmila Monastyrska who played Lady  Macbeth with a powerful voice and acting  this ambition character showed with great success  that she was willing to do any thing to be a queen .The rest of the cast as well as the chorus were very good.
 Using mainly black, red and gold for the scenery and costumes and the effect of the lights to reflect Macbeths tormented dreams mixed with reality made for an outstanding production.
The quality of this blu ray was perfect with outstanding sound and filming. I enjoyed this performance very much.",1379203200,2,1137,4.521951219512195

8291990,5,B001D6OKUQ,"I just want to concentrate on SIMON KEENLYSIDE, who plays MACHBETH, as both his singing and acting are superb, in this lively and well staged production. He was also a remarkable HAMLET, in THOMAS AMBROISE opera (in French). I think he is well on his way to become a Shakespearian Operas super-star !",1340668800,5,300,4.679245283018868
8291991,4,B001D6OKUQ,"If the concept behind Phyllida Lloyd's direction at the Royal Opera House production of Verdi's Macbeth (revived here under director Harry Fehr) isn't immediately obvious and doesn't seem totally coherent, it's perhaps because the marriage of Verdi and Shakespeare itself in this earlier opera of the composer (unlike the magnificent later adaptations Otello and Falstaff) isn't the most consistent or coherent either. Lloyd's production however remains faithful to Verdi's imperfect interpretation of the work, working closely to mirror the tone of the production with what Simon Keenlyside, in an accompanying interview on the DVD and Blu-ray, vividly describes as the ""black tides"" of Verdi's score. Partly, that's mirrored in the black, white and red colour schemes, but there's also a sense that the production wants to put all the dark violence, all the horror and its consequences right up there on the stage also.

Here the true nature of the violence is made ever present, and the full extent of its consequences made real. The reign of blood that is embarked upon is visible throughout here and no amount of hand-washing will completely erase it. The stage is often littered with the bodies of Macbeth's crimes that usually take place off-stage, and since all this is so vividly described in Verdi's score, why shouldn't it? Directing the orchestra of the Royal Opera House, Antonio Pappano seems determined also to tease out some greater subtleties in the score that aren't really there (although the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Currentzis-Tcherniakov-production/dp/B006NO1SSA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Currentzis/Tcherniakov production</a>&nbsp;for the Paris Opera would beg to differ) and, consequently, it's a little bit too delicate when a bit of a heavier punch would be more appropriate, but it does nonetheless manage to draw that gloomy darkness out of the work very well. For all its efforts to put the horror up on the stage and the close attention paid to the score however, there's initially a detachment between the orchestration and the performances in Act I at least, which seems to be down to there not being enough attention paid to the acting. Things warm up a little by the end of Act II, Act III's potions, prophesies and apparitions are delightfully staged, and thereafter the deepening horror of the drama and the score starts to make the full extent of its presence felt.

At the very least, the listener will be beaten into submission - as they should be - by the singing and presence of Lady Macbeth. The formidable ringing tone and sheer power of Ukranian soprano Liudmyla Monastyrska's voice certainly achieves that, even if there isn't always an emotional depth behind her pronouncements and her acting ability is practically non-existent. With that voice, and Verdi behind it, that's not something to worry about in this particular opera however. On the lighter end of the register Simon Keenlyside is a true Verdi baritone. His consideration of his lines and delivery of them makes real the forced bravado and the underlying horror of his fate that lies in his character. That's quite impressive, particularly in his death scene aria 'Mal per me' (the opera working from Verdi's 1865 revision of the opera, but successfully reinstating some of the 1847 cuts like this one). Banquo is also well served by American bass, Raymond Aceto, and his Gran Scena 'Studia il passo, o mio figlio' is sung very well.

The Blu-ray release of Macbeth is up to the expected high standards, the strong high contrast lighting showing good detail, while the mixing on both the PCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 tracks give a fine account of the score, the mixing (along with Pappano's conducting), achieving a good balance between the orchestration and the singing voices. Extras on the BD include a Cast Gallery, Behind the Scenes Rehearsals and Interviews with Simon Keenlyside, Raymond Aceto and Liudmyla Monastyrska. Subtitles are in Italian, English, French, German and Spanish.",1331164800,34,4058,5.298136645962733
