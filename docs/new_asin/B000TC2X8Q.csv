8208566,5,B000TC2X8Q,The pilot episode and the storyline featured in several later episodes of Miami Vice as well.  This show changed my life and made freshman year in high school.  I liked it so much that I went back to purchase Seasons 1 & 2.  I'm sure I'll have Season 3 by month's end.  This show doesn't get enough credit for the transformation it kicked off for both television and movies and for the national view of Florida as well.  It played a major role in my decision to eventually move to Florida.  I make it a point to catch it whenever it's on in syndication or whenever I have a few minutes to pop in the DVD.  Highly recommended.,1429574400,,625,4.245762711864407

8208568,4,B000TC2X8Q,"It's really neat to go back and reflect on where the long standing, infamous show started. I enjoy the vintage era footage of the evolving South Beach area of Miami. D. Johnson is a little 'red-neck' in this pilot but that was I believe, to exaggerate the contrast with Tubbs coming out of NY. The crokodile thing is a little over the top but all in all, a worthwhile purchase for those of us who really liked that series and what it was all about, and those 'scarface' times.",1355356800,4,476,4.359550561797753
8208569,4,B000TC2X8Q,"The Pilot Miami Vice Episode is a Classic! Unfortunately , it is not a BluRay so the picture/audio quality is so-so. Still, if you're a Miami Vice fan, this is a must have. Also, the newer Miami Vice remake with Colin Farrell and Jamie Fox is on BluRay and is very true to form(with the original Miami Vice).",1346630400,,308,4.327586206896552
8208570,5,B000TC2X8Q,"A must have for Miami Vice fans. Mine's a VHS version but, now that i found it in DVD, I'll buy it.",1295481600,2,99,3.5454545454545454
