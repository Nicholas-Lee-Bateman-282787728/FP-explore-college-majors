8515405,3,B007EQR30S,"The shows on this disc are shown in a smaller box, for some reason. Not widescreen, a reduced size. Maybe it says something about the quality, because it's not very good. I think they may be running out of good GG Allin footage to (commercially) release. In case you don't know, the average concert contains a totally naked GG (save for the boots... and his tiny weiner is clearly the star of the show), pooping, eating it, smearing himself with it, and hurling it at the crowd. He beats himself up with the mic or a can, bloodies himself, jams the mic up his butt, grabs and molests unwilling females, fights the crowd, and hurls stuff at them. 20-25 minutes seems to be the threshold for a show, whether that's GG's, the band's, or the club owner's threshold, I'm not sure. I see these as strange social experiments. The shows on here are:

- Memphis, TN 11/16/91 (23:25, with encore!) ""I hope you all get killed on the way home!""
- New Orleans, LA 11/17/91 (17:54, starts part way into the show) There is really bad feedback throughout. Looks like a dumpy warehouse.
- Knoxville, TN 11/23/91 (24:29) Another warehouse. GG sings while fighting a fan! ""We're bored.""
- Youngstown, OH 5/12/93 (21:59) An actual club, and it's packed.
- Richmond, VA 5/13/93 (31:52) Shaky cam, epic length! ""Don't come here and tell me that I owe you anything."" A slightly different version of this show appears on Live and Pissed.

I would recommend any other commercially available GG Allin disc over this one (save for The Best of GG Allin and The Murder Junkies), but it's definitely worth owning to complete your collection.",1357603200,5,1611,4.669014084507042
