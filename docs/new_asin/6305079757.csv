961833,1,6305079757,"It's true that this set is probably as good a set of the dubbed version as there is out there absent remastering from the source and a commercial release, which does not seem to be forthcoming.  However, with all due respect to the considered opinions of a gentleman from Belgium, things aren't so rosy, and the ""the best available"" ain't saying much.

VIDEO:

Lots of artifacting (that's when there's no real data in a section of the program and normal scenery is replaced by digital blocks that look sort of like the mosaic effect that they use to cover people's naughty bits on TV)

Lots of wash-out (that's when the colors are badly faded from a print)

Hiccups (like a skip but it's transient--often together with artifacting)

I had a friend who's a graduate student in film and something of an expert in digital video replication look at this and he came to the same conclusion as another reviewer.  THIS IS A DVD COPY OF A VCD COPY OF A LOW-QUALITY VHS EDITION OF THIS SERIES, AT BEST.

AUDIO:

NOT SO GOOD.  Static crackling is nearly as loud as the dialogue almost as often as not, sometimes characters sound like they're at the bottom of a well.

LEGALITY:

Very, very doubtful. There is no assertion of rights on anything I bought save what they poorly color photocopied off the packaging of the original Japanese release they were pirating. On their website they also sell DVDs that are CLEARLY in violation of the copyrights of Toho, Daiei, Tsuburaya Communications, and no doubt a bunch of other companies, things like pirated copies of recent box sets from Japan that they can't POSSIBLY have the rights to, because Toho never releases rights to the American market until the Japanese have had stuff for years so as to avoid competition from imported American DVDs (DVD prices in Japan are 2-3 times what they are here). If you care about these issues and feel that the heirs of Eiji Tsuburaya have a right to be paid for their father's legacy, avoid these people like the PLAGUE.

SERVICE:

WRETCHED. Here's some words about Novarose themselves.  They ship their product in unpadded envelopes, as a result of which one disc arrived damaged and unplayable. I had a very prickly interaction with their customer service people concerning this and a few other issues and I would not recommend doing business with them if you have any other option available to you.  It's probably not worth the aggravation; these people have seem to no interest in making you happy once your money's in their hot little hands.

A legitimate copy will come out eventually; amazon has tons of good Japanese SciFi--try Ultraman Tiga or THE MYSTERIANS or the '90s Gamera films instead; they're fantastic and legitimate, too!",1122508800,,2716,4.769230769230769
961834,5,6305079757,"I purchased this 4 DVD set  of all 39 episodes & I think its the best! And I've seen many.  This seller has an excellent video & audio quality set, and it's a legal copy.  For a nearly 40 year old TV series made on ancient Japanese analog equipment, I was really happy about the great quality.  Sure, there was about 8-10 seconds of hiccups spread out over 16 hours of viewing, but I would be a jerk to care about those seconds.  I was pleasantly surprised when the set came with extra bonus materials as well - like rare deleted footage restored, though, only about 4 minutes worth so I can see why it wasn't advertised, but nonetheless, I loved that feature.  I also loved the bonus feature of the Japanese credits for Ultraman, because I had never seen it before (just the American dub version). And it comes with the Bonus of episode 1 of Ultraman Ace - seeing all 5 different Ultras together was a blast, and made me feel better knowing that Ultraman was still alive.  :)  Each DVD had a motion interactive menu, so about 15 seconds of each episode was played -- great feature to help me jump and skip round.  The Customer Service of the Seller was also impeccable - Grade A+ all the way.  I will be buying all my Ultraman titles from this seller.

While the show itself is fun, and easily deserves 4 stars, the dvd set itself is severely lacking. The dvd's come in cd slipcovers inside the case. This isn't a big problem. The menus aren't anything special, I've seen better in pirated dvd's, but that's acceptable and not important. What isn't acceptable, and what brings down my rating, are the issues with video and audio quality. The images are washed out and look like an old vhs copy. When watching in English, the audio frequently changes to Japanese. Changing it back does not always work immediately. The subtitles are usually completely different from spoken lines, and sometimes stop running for no reason.

962034,3,6305079757,"Having watched this since age 5 it's pretty close to my heart and full of wonderful nostalgia, but all that aside, this release is a minor letdown.  I know the company lost the rights due to a court battle and the DVD publisher will have to stop selling these at one point.  It's probably just as well, since this release is nice, but has some agonizing flaws that bring it down, such as odd sound choices that made me guess ""would it be the original Ultraman theme song that I've known and loved or will it be the less appealing (for me, anyway) Japanese version?"".  Additionally, those chose the original video from the Japanese opening titles-a bad choice IMHO.  Also, the video playback is less than smooth, sort of like the reason I don't take cable or dish anymore, with frames that seem to have been removed and the actor often ""clicks"" along. Is it time compression?  If so, I have to ask ""why"". I really hate that and it's distracting in the worst way.  Now, this set certainly isn't a total loss.  The show has really held up for this fan!  I love these shows even at the ancient age of 41.  The characters are terrific and give me a warm feeling every time I watch one.  I enjoyed the extra interviews of the dubbing crew, even though the quality of the video on that was really really bad.  WTF?  Nice folks.

Now, this set replaces a bootleg I had and never enjoyed watching too much.  I paid about 3 times more for the bootleg so overall I have to say I'm happy.

Having the first program is awesome because neither my husband nor I knew how Hiata had become Ultraman.  The actual product we recieved was new and better than expected.  My kids have said that there is an episode where part of the audio goes into Japanese and they couldn't understand it.  I've watched most of the shows with them and haven't heard it myself.  Another great benefit to ordering a series of a show like Ultraman is you can set it up with your family to view it on a certian night as if it really were a scheduled television show.

I would recommend turning on the English dubbing and the captioning. There are a few scenes that don't have the English dubbing. The captioning gives you the Japanese translation into English; which most of the time is different what is dubbed into English. The special feature on the 1st disk (Vol. 1) explains the reason. My 14 yr. old says everything looks so fake. I tell her we knew that; but as kids we used our imaginations more that you do today. This is 1966 technology. There was no computer technology for TV in existence. You relied on models & special effects, people dressed up in costums and special camera effects at the time.

Remember this is the original Japanese version. So the credits are in Japanese. The U.S. version at the beginning of each program can be seen in the Special Feature section.",1190505600,2,960,4.5813953488372094

Yes, some of the episodes lapse into Japanese, with subtitles.  But that is a plus, because you get the full episode, not just those portions that were dubbed for American t.v.  Great packaging, great liner notes, etc.  Well worth the price if you enjoyed Ultraman as a kid.

I can now put these on for my own kids, ages 4 and 7. (A small number of the episodes are a little bit scary for 5 and under, so screen them with junior.)  They love it, even the Japanese parts.",1189382400,4,589,4.3

962091,5,6305079757,"Having now watched Series One, Vol. 1 of Ultraman, I can sum it up for the perspective buyer like this: If you watched this show as a child, you loved it and you're now reading these reviews debating on whether or not to buy it, I say ""Buy It Now"", you simply won't be disappointed.
Sure some of the complaints mentioned in other reviews are valid but unless you are an absolute connoisseur of sound & video and demand perfection, the audio is great, the video is great and the DVD extras are great. You won't be disappointed.
We all watched these episodes on first pass in Black & White, on small television screens with little circular UHF antennas, what you will now see will blow that away.  In color you say? They are just an absolute blast to watch again after almost 40 years, they are that much fun. You won't be disappointed.
Since we've all seen the episodes, the true enjoyment from this set comes in the form of the DVD extras and alternate audio sound tracks.  As others have mentioned, watching it in the original Japanese language with English subtitles is just too cool.  You get a sense of how the episodes first appeared in 1967. Even more cool is watching in English with the English subtitles turned on.  The difference in what was originally written in Japanese vs. what was dubbed in English is very surprising to say the least. It is very interesting and often has a more mature almost serious tone to the episodes especially the Ultraman origin episode (no spoilers here).  The DVD extras just add to your enjoyment. You won't be disappointed.
I'm not looking for the secret director's cut of ""Revenge Of The Sith"" or the 20th anniversary version of ""Robocop"" here, I want Ultraman. I want 40 year old Japanese television at it's best and all the insight I can gather about it as a viewing adult.  With that in mind, you will thoroughly enjoy it and won't be disappointed.

For thirty years Ultraman never crossed the radar screen of my memory. That all changed about 5 years ago when I stumbled across a seller on Ebay with the user name ULTRAMAN. SNAP! It all came back to me in a flash! I immediately began searching for the show on the internet. To my dismay, NO DvD's were available. I found all 39 episodes on VHS, but the quality was very poor. When I discovered the DvD's were now available I ordered them immediately and I am VERY satisfied. The picture quality is BETTER than the originals that aired from film on TV. The audio is excellent with the only MINOR issue of Japanese being dubbed in for short periods in a few spots.

This live action Sci-Fi series was a staple of my childhood, surpassed in esteem only by Star Trek and Doctor Who. The U.S. English Language release stopped airing around 1980. I was overjoyed to find that it was finally available in a non-bootleg release. Although some of the original footage has been replaced with black and white (very minimal) and the English language version occasionally drops into Japanese due to the loss of portions of the dubbed release, the quality of this production is quite excellent.

The story involves Hayata, the hero, and the other members of the ""Science Patrol"" the damsel Fuji, the clownish Ito (Ide), Captain Mura (Muramatsu), dependable Ayashi, and boy sidekick Hoshino. The Science Patrol is called in to investigate strange phenomena, natural and scientific disasters, and, of course, monster sightings. In the first episode, Hayata is accidentally killed by a benevolent alien who merges with Hayata in order to restore him to life. Hayata is normally human, but when danger calls (almost always in the form of a 200ft Godzilla analog, but with ingenious variations, including lobster-clawed bug men, carnivorous space algae, and abominable snow men) Hayata transforms into a giant bug-eyed red and silver bio-mechanoid who can shoot death rays, fly, ""Shuwach!"" and do amazing Sumo moves. On watching this show again as an adult after 30 years, I am struck by the show's refreshing lack of political correctness. The contrasts between the English dialog (often cynical) and the Japanese (overblown and exaggeratedly technical) are striking, and show the difference between the post-60's anti-intellectual attitude of the U.S. compared to the earnest sincerity of the Japanese.

I strongly recommend that English speakers listen with English audio and the subtitles (which show the contrasting original Japanese dialog) simultaneously.

This show is certainly intended for children or those nostalgic for their childhood. But as such, it is a wonderful addition to my library. I have watched all the episodes recalling the joy which they brought me as a child, and can't stop singing the theme song. I hope this would translate to present day children. The special effects are done with blue-screen imaging and men in plastic monster suits, but, as with Doctor Who, the plot (however minimal) and the monster concepts drive the show. Many scenes have an spookiness or poignancy which one wouldn't expect from whatever today's version of Pokemon or the Power Rangers might be.

The box has a dimensional image of Ultraman embossed on the front in full color with a shiny foil finish giving it a metallic look. This set contains a full color eight page booklet with brilliant photos of the Kajiu (monsters). The history of Ultraman and a detailed summary on each episode. The discs themselves are a work of art as well, with a metallic finish to them. I really haven't seen anything like them before! The set contains three slim lined DVD cases. The picture quality, considering the age of the films are excellent. Some of the sound effects seem to reach out grab you. The interviews with Peter Fernandez, Corrine Orr, and the late Earl Hammond were great. This is the same English dub team of Speed Racer, Marine Boy, and I believe Johnny Sokko and his Flying Robot. The interviews were fun and full of insight. This DVD set has both the original Japanese version and the English dubbed version with options for subtitles. I highly recommend this set! I'm having more fun watching this stuff at 36 years old than eight or nine years old. I hope somebody releases the Johnny Sokko and his Flying Robot as well. Purchase this set now!!!

HERE HE COMES TO MY DVD!

I've been a fan since my first exposure to Ultra-Man back in 1975.  With the Ultra-Man DVD release I feel like I can 100% relive and cherish some fond childhood memories.

Now I know many people are going to squibble about some sound and video troubles but if these are from the masters (as it appears) then this may very well be the best we're going to get anytime soon so just enjoy them.

The 3-disc set features the first 20 episodes of Ultra-Man and the Science Patrol battling every monster from the Space Mummy to Bemler to the Baltans to everybody's favorite Gabadon (""Don't cry children!"").  One of the neat features of the set is that at select moments the episodes have reinserted footage that was originally removed from American viewings (yes there's no dubbing for this part but so what it's fun to see what we may have missed the first time).  The subtitles and Japanese tracks are well done and really add a new element to practically every scene.

If you're a fan, pick up this set.  I guarantee you'll have a smile on your face and in the immortal words of Ito...""That sounds ULTRA-good!""",1165104000,5,1144,4.541463414634146
962153,1,6305079757,"Being a big fan of Ultraman and Tokusatsu in general, I was thrilled when I heard this series was coming out on DVD and couldn't wait to get it. Whilst I agree with the online reviewers who get annoyed with those who do nothing but complain about the release of a much anticipated set such as this, I have to say that it is a big disappointment.

This is because BCI Eclipse Company is working together with Chaiyo Productions Company, Ltd., and Sompote Saengduenchai, who all but stole the rights to Ultraman from the show's creators, Tsuburaya Productions. Unfortunately, Chaiyo Productions has no interest in releasing quality merchandising of any kind, which sadly extends to any Ultraman related merchandising (action figures, etc.). This is the reason for many of the flaws previously stated that keep this from being an exceptional DVD release of an old classic: the poor audio track, the pixelation, the fading in and out of the picture quality, the mismatched titles on the box to the actual tv episodes, and the lackluster packaging.

While it's great to see Ultraman finally being released officially to the United States, it would be so much better if it were being released under its rightdul owners. Fans of the original Ultraman, as well as the characters up to and including Ultraman Taro, would do well to hold off on buying this DVD set and wait to see if the legal issues between Tsuburaya and Chaiyo can be resolved. If Tsuburaya does get the rights to their characters back, an Ultraman DVD release from them will be well worth the wait and will put this already poor quality set to even greater shame.",1163980800,11,1623,4.772241992882562
962218,5,6305079757,"This is something I've been waiting for for the entire history of home video; the official release of the one and only Ultraman on DVD!  I'm working my way through volume 2 of the series right now, but I want to address one issue in particular; the problem of the audio track sometimes changing from dubbed English to subtitled Japanese.  The booklet that comes with Volume 2 explains it, but since it wasn't explained in Volume 1, I'll relay it.

The problem is actually fairly simple; when the series was being prepared for American TV, it was cut heavily to satisfy time issues for the various stations it was being syndicated to.  What you're watching is the original, full-length Japanese version, exactly as it was broadcast in 1966-67 (so it's pointless to ask why there's a letterboxed version, because there simply isn't one; what you see is what Japanese TV viewers got).  When the series was remastered for DVD, the company used the original U.S. dub; however, it doesn't match up completely with the full-length version, so there are places where an English dub is simply not available.  That's why the audio track seems to switch.  My own advice is, keep the original Japanese audio track and turn on the English subtitles.  The subtitling is quite good and you get more of the genuine experience of watching Ultraman as it was originally meant to be watched.  (Of course, if you miss the U.S. opening title, it's available as a special feature on Volume 1!)

As for the series itself, it's hard to find descriptions that don't sound like overblown superlatives.  Ultraman is, quite simply, the gold standard for Japanese live-action ""special effects fantasy"", as it's called in the opening titles.  Every live-action kaiju (giant monster) and sentai (superhero team) series since then has owed something to, and borrowed something from, Ultraman.  Quite simply, this box set - both Volume 1 and Volume 2 - is something that, literally, nobody with any serious interest at all in Japanese SF/fantasy TV should fail to own.",1163289600,3,2035,4.8979591836734695

So I bought it.

It's awesome.  The dub isn't perfect, but when you're watching Ultraman fight the monsters, it doesn't matter.  I feel like i'm 5 years old again and watching my son's reaction to each episodes was worth the money.

IF you loved Ultraman as a kid and have a chance to watch it with your own kids, you'll love it even more, because it will remind you why you liked it all those years ago and will make you realize that monsters, never get out of style...

962223,3,6305079757,"Like most of the posters, nostalgia made me buy this (like most children in Charleston SC in 1971, I rushed home from school to watch this on the sainted HAPPY RAINE show).

I've alway said that there are 4 responses to seeing shows that you haven't seen since childhood-

1. You liked it as a child, but now that you're older and ""get it,"" you love it even more.

2. You loved it then and you love it now.

3. You realize now that it wasn't all that great, you only liked it because you were a kid at the time.

4. You hated it then and despise it even worse now.

To me, this falls in the #3 category.

This show enthralled me as a 6 year old in 1971. The creepy titles, the nightmare-inducing monsters, and the whole idea of the Science Patrol (which led to a childhood interest in science on my part. I wanted to grow up and join Hyatha and Fuji in the Science Patrol) greatly appealed to me at the time. Seeing this again for the first time in 35 years made me say ""WHAT THE (HECK)!?""

What corn! The monsters that scared me so in the Nixon era now look stupid and laughable. I now realize they were stepping on toy trucks and outrageously phony scenery. The episodes tell the same story every time, etc. ad nauseum.

But I still have a slight crush on Fuji, and it's nice to have a window to my childhood around in times of stress. Besides, some smaller kids of today still might be inspired to like science because of this.",1160524800,2,1430,4.189781021897811
962224,4,6305079757,"Okay, I'm ordering this, so I can't say I've reviewed the product yet, but I was living in Japan in the 60's and 70's watching this as a little Army brat.  Since I was sooooo foolish to throw out my original Ultraman merchandise when I ""grew up,"" this is my chance at redemption.  Unless I can find my 1971 Ultraman pillowcase, the only relic I have left is a couple of scratch-on stickers in my Japan scrapbook.  Any Masked Rider fans out there?  I have some scratch-ons of him too, and, yes, there are landfills somewhere where my childhood Masked Rider merch ended up along with UltraMan merch.  Dig this, I once had an Ultraman flower waterer in the shape of him flying, where the water sprayed from the fingertips!

The American versions that cropped up in the late 70's on WTCG, later WTBS (aka Turner burner) did not do the original Japanese releases justice, but, oh to wake up at 6:30 on Saturday mornings or to come home from school to watch Turner's collection of Japanese gems!!!  Remember Space Giants?!!!

I'm definitely getting this series to share it with my kids, who love that kind of stuff, think the Power Rangers are a devolved joke, and appreciate my zeal for late 60's/early 70's classics, including UFO SHADO!",1160438400,,1233,4.623853211009174
962225,5,6305079757,"What can I say?  The negative posts were obviously written by people who either didn't grow up watching the dubbed series, or didn't realize how cheesy special effects were in the '60s.

I bought this for my 6-year-old son (and myself.)  I was able to pry him away from Power Rangers and explain that THIS is how they got their start.  We made it thru the box set in one weekend.  Jacob is even able to tell his cousins that if the light on his chest stops blinking, ""Ultraman will NEVER rise again.""  It brought tears to my eyes (not really, but it was cool.)  I hum a portion of the Science Patrol theme music in my head everyday.  It's too late; I can't be helped.

I can't wait for the second half of the series to be released.  Anyone complaining about certain scenes not being dubbed in English probably doesn't understand the term ""syndicated.""

The release of the original Ultraman is meant for the generation of kids who grew up using rotary phones and are frustrated with cell phones.  If your parents bought you a cell phone when you were nine, this series is not for you.

962226,5,6305079757,"First off, I saw Ultraman when my Mom and I took a summer trip to Japan to see my Grandmother. I couldn't speak Japanese at all (and still can't), even though my Mom was born in Japan. My Mom tried to teach me, but I just didn't want to learn it. Now, as an adult, I wish I did.

I was 9 years old when I first saw Ultraman in Japan back in 1976. I couldn't understand a word they were saying (it was in Japanese), but I enjoyed it none-the-less. I could at least pick up what the gist of the stories were, and for a 9-year-old, a guy who could change into a giant superhero was awesome. And, all the different creatures brought back all the Godzilla memories I had as a kid as well.

A few years later, I remember when this came on American TV. At last, I was able to actually watch the show and understand what was going on.

Now, with this DVD release, I can actually watch the shows in their original Japanese dialogue AND read what is being said. It's amazing how much can be lost in the translation, especially when they have to try and synch the lip movements to English words.

Still, watching these DVDs was such a blast from the past for me. So many memories came back as I watched Ultraman battle so many creatures. I even had an Ultraman book from Japan that listed all the other Ultramen heroes along with hundreds of monsters.

This is so great. I can't wait to see the other series that I never got a chance to see. The only complaint I have is the lack of special features. It would have been nice to have something to explain how the series began, where the actors are today, etc. But still, it doesn't detract from having the beginning of this series on DVD.",1159401600,,1676,4.192546583850931
962227,5,6305079757,"I have read all of the other reviews & I can assure you that of all the ""versions"" of the series you can buy, this is by far the best quality.  And it's a legitimate release, not a bootleg.

I have never been clear on whether a real Japanese DVD set has ever been made availible prior to this, just the laser discs & VHS tapes.  I am going to guess that now there is, the Japanese versions on this collection are superb, I doubt you will find any better quality considering the age of the show.  They are broadcast quality.  I highly recommend viewing the Japanese versions on this set as you will see that the translations into English remained very faithful to the story & character names (except some monster names were translated phonetically).  This is not ""Gatchaman/Battle Of The Planets"" where the translations & edits resulted in two completely different stories.

I grew up on ""Ultraman"" in the 70's & early 80's.  I was too young to remember whether or not anything was edited when ""uncut"" episodes surfaced on the trading market in the early 90's.  I bought the entire series on VHS from 16mm prints for like $100 in 1995. NONE of the episodes had the title sequences at all.  Here on DVD, you get the Japanese intro on both the Japanese & English versions for some reason.  That is all the more reason to watch in Japanese as they also translate the theme song AND the credit details which reveal, by default, why so many alternate episode titles have existed in English.  Prior bootleg DVD sets have generally used on title sequence per disc & it was just pulled from one of the four episodes on the anniversary VHS from about 10 years ago (referenced in other reviews).  Watching the Japanese version with English subtitles will also eliminate the audio glitches.

The original English dubs originally omitted Ultraman's vocal exclamations for the first 12-or-so episodes, the anniversary VHS attempted to restore this to the English dubs, hence a lot of inconsistencies.  I remember getting a copy of several ""restored"" epsiodes after my initial series purchase in 1995 to find that the first couple minutes often were in Japanese before English.  In those cases, missing footage had been restored & this appears to be the case with this DVD set.  It is possible these restored episodes have been ""in limbo"" with copyrights for years, they seem to be working backwards when it comes to which version of Ultraman is released commercially (was floored when the Tiga series was released here in its entirety not too long ago).

This set contains the legendary ""Monster Dinosaur Base"" episode (have heard a variety of alternate titles over the years) which features a creature called Jirass.  It's simply the mid-1960's Godzilla costume with a frill (""Godzilla in drag"" as the ad for the VHS tapes stated in 1993!) resembling a frilled water dragon.  This is also one of the episodes that features a full ""beta capsule"" transformation that includes the swirling ray of light surrounding Ultraman's human host.  Only a handful of episodes have this.  Ultraman also laughs for the only time in the series when fighting Jirass (have heard this was edited in some markets when in syndication).  Monsters from the series have been marketed as toys & kits throughout the years & Jirass is just about the rarest, having only been modeled faithfully a few times.

The future franchise of Ultraman appears in ""Brother From Another Planet"" where an evil being assumes the form of the superhero & Ultraman is forced to fight himself.  The most popular creature in the franchise, the Baltan, debuts in ""Shoot The Invader"".  As the series progresses, you will notice that many creature costumes were recycled into other creatures, but the Baltan remains as is.

The only inconsistency I didn't like was the episode numbering on the individual discs.  While the packaging is correct, the discs number each episode per disc, not per the series.

In conclusion, you will not find more ""bang for your buck"" anywhere in the US market.  Period.  This set is well worth the purchase.  The menus are nice & you are guided by a Science Patrol logo when making your selections.  The interview segments are edited poorly, VERY poorly, but if you can manage to sit thru them, you will hear the actors reinact some of their Ultraman dialogue & reflect on the series.

The next DVD set will include the only two-part episode in the series & you will get to see Ultraman return his human host to his human form in that one.  You will also see the only episode where Ultraman appears in human size.  But most of you reading already know this...just can't wait to see the original Japanese versions.  Even tho' the technology of today has made the more recent Ultraman series shine & sparke for TV, this original ""where it all began"" series remains my favourite of all.  Will be interesting to see if they attempt to release ""Ultraman Seven"", the first ""spin off"", next.",1158883200,2,4952,4.762016412661196

All in all, this is a huge step forward from the bootlegged versions, one of which I bought on Ebay and was disappointed in for a variety of reasons.

962306,4,6305079757,"Hi all,

 After watching just the first 6 episodes and being mentally swept back to my childhood viewing of Ultarman from its initial appearence in the late 60's, I wish to share some views with you:

#1 This is indeed the original 60's dubbing.

#2 I believe that no scenes were cut in the original; the absence of English dialog in some places on this DVD is due to its being lost by subsequent cutting for syndication over the years. I audio taped the series back in the 60's. If I still have those tapes and ever find them, I will be able to give you a definitive answer. I will also offer them to the folks who made this set should they be interested in adding the missing dialog to future pressings (but be warned; it is a VERY primitive recording, I had a dinky little recorder back then and NEVER cleaned the audio heads).

#3 The extended Japanese opening credits appeared as the opening and closing credits of the original US release. To simulate this; take the point where the US song repeats and move that to the end of the show; you will have a recreation of the US broadcast of the 60's (which I watched on ch 56 Boston, Ma).

 By all means do NOT let any of the flaws dissuade you from buying this release. There may never be a better release, and even if one eventually turns up; this one is WELL worth the price. Also, we need to encourage the releasers of this edition to continue with what appears to be plans to release EVERY Ultraman series to DVD; most of which have never been shown in the US!

962308,5,6305079757,"When I picked this set up I was overjoyed that it was the nice clean transfer from the Tsuburaya Ultraman restoration project. With this old 1966 Japanese serial it difficult to say what you would get even if it was professionally done. During this project they spent 100s of hours cleaning and restoring this film. For any Ultraman fan this set is a must. From time to time I've run into this series and it's like I've seen it again for the first time.

  This is classic Japanese TV and after watching this it is easy to see why they've done about 20 seasons of this thing. It's fun, witty, and highly entertaining. If anyone is familiar with Dr. Who, it falls into that category. The characters of the Science Patrol are enduring, the effects are innovative for TV at 1966, and an original high concept. The plot is simple. It is a revamp of another Japanese serial that is like the Outer Limits called Ultra Q. Every episode of Ultra Q would have a group of reporters and scientists that try to stop the monster of the week. In the case of Ultraman, what stops the monster is a mysterious outerspace policeman.

  Now to the complaints about this set. Most of them are totally unwarranted. I do not know what they were expecting. This is 1966 television and not film. Other old television serials about that time in color, like Star Trek, are also riddled with flaws despite the clean up. Most people just look past them, i.e. the latest transfer of 'the Menagerie', from how they remembered it. There is some patch work here, but come on, they can't resurrect the dead to fill in the dub spots of scenes that were scissored 40 years ago.

  A must for Sci Fi fans, TV buffs, the curious, and Ultraman alumni. Six stars if possible. Check it out.",1156896000,3,1750,4.477987421383648
962309,4,6305079757,"I was one of those people who hesitated to pick up this DVD set after reading the atrocious early reviews it received on Amazon. But then, a curious phenomenon took place; one that would pique the interest of the Science Patrol itself: the reviews became more numerous, AND more positive! And so, not unlike the numerous times it happened to Ito in the series, I fell under the influence of these positive outsiders and picked up the DVD set for myself. And while the DVD set is by no means perfect, it nevertheless more than satisfied my hunger to see Ultraman on DVD.

Yes, I too was one of the millions of kids across America who thrilled to the adventures of the silver and red alien superhero from Nebula M78 broadcast on afternoon television (UHF, for those of you who remember) in the mid-70's, and once again in the early 80's during the anime boom. And, like many of the other fans out there, when the show went off the air for the last time, I scrambled to find bootleg VHS copies of the episodes. Over time, I found several sets of varying quality, the last of which featured the video from the Japanese laser discs (remember those?) overdubbed (somehow) with the audio from what I can only assume were various VHS copies of episodes taped off TV the last time the series was broadcast in the early 80's. And though these bootlegs were pretty good, they still were missing some scenes I can clearly recall from the broadcasts in the 70's.

Yes, to the best of my recollection (which is pretty damned good in this area) Ultraman was broadcast completely UNCUT the first time around. I owe this to the fact that there was a lot less advertising on TV in the 70's, which meant stations needed more CONTENT to fill a half hour, to say nothing of the fact that the show generally showed up on (what were then) low output UHF stations without a whole lot of advertising! So, for those of you who believe that the show was edited for the US broadcasts, you're right. It was edited: in the 80's re-airings! Why? Well, more commercials, obviously. But it also might have had something to do with a whole crusade against airing so-called ""violent"" programs when children could see them. (The masterminds of this crusade were targeting many series at the time. Chief on their list was a little show called VOYAGERS! Anyone remember that one?) In any case, many ""violent"" scenes (i.e., Ultraman and monsters ripping body parts off each other) were cut when the show was rebroadcast.

That brings me now to this DVD set. If you already have the same bootlegs of the show that I do, you'll recognize that the English audio track on the this DVD is absolutely IDENTICAL to the one used in the bootlegs. It drops out in several places and reverts to Japanese because either A.) that piece of audio was missing when the show was rebroadcast in the 80's or B.) teh quality of the audio when it was recorded was so bad that it wasn't worth preserving. Oh, and now that I've actually watched the first couple of episodes, I can report that the dubbing on them is in fact IDENTICAL to the tracks that appeared on the ""Ultraman 30th Anniversary Collection"" VHS briefly released 10 years ago. Again, all the English dialogue is there (except for the ""that light"" lines in the pilot - where that's gone, God only knows), and it has the same reverberation problem (probably due to somebody not paying attention when mixing the mono tracks to stereo) the samesaid tape had! In any case, I wonder why the producers of this DVD decided to use the bootleg audio instead of getting their hands on the complete, uncut track from Peter Fernandez, et al? (Unless, of course, he doesn't own the rights to it!)

The picture quality is, as one other reviewer noted, pretty darned good for a show that's 40 years old. Some of it looks a little grainy, but I believe that's how it looked when it was shot. (Don't know what kind of per-episode budget they had for this show, but I'm sure greater emphasis was placed on costumes and set design than in the cost of film and development!)

At any rate, now that I own this DVD set, I would say that overall it is well worth it to have Ultraman in a format that, if properly taken care of, will last forever. Is it a perfect release? No. Is it still enjoyable whatever language it happens to be in? Yes. Will I buy volume 2 when it comes out? Absolutely!

So, stop whining and rejoice Ultra-fans! Our favorite hero is back on our TVs whenever we want him! I think that's cause for celebration!",1156809600,2,4511,4.508557457212714
962310,4,6305079757,"I loved Ultraman as a child in the early 70s in Delaware (Philadelphia TV).  When I moved to St. Louis, they did not have it.  So it has been over 30 years since I saw the show.  After getting Internet in the 90s I looked for Ultraman, found and bought a VHS with the first four episodes, but was disappointed to learn that TBS (the Japanese production company) had no plans to release all 39 episodes.  The other thing I learned was that Ultraman was just the beginning (at least of the Ultraman character, Ultra Q preceded Ultraman).  There then followed over the next decades and into the present a whole ""family"" of Ultramen.  I have yet to see these.

As for the release of the original Ultraman: I think for what you get, this DVD set is good enough.  Is there room for improvement when the second volume is released?  Yes, there is.  And, hopefully, the company will note all the comments and work on them.  Some of the sound problems and the English dubbing issuess are curious, but not too distracting.  Clearly the Japanese versions were re-overlayed with English dubbing, instead of the ""original"" English dub versions being put on the DVD.  Thus the Japanese with English subtitles (and sometimes just Japanese with no subtitles) is the combination of the uncut Japanese scenes for which no dubbing ever occurred and just the incomplete English dubbing altogether.  Other reviews have noted that some of the scenes are absent the English dub because those scenes were deleted to fit US time slots.  That is true only in some cases.  I clearly remember some of the scenes from the English versions, but which are in Japanese only here.  Another inconsistency is the opening.  All the openings are the longer Japanese version, but sometimes the English song is played (twice through) and other times the Japanese is played.  There appears to be no pattern to this phenomenon, however.

But this should be all about the content of the shows themselves.  Again, this is good enough.  We now have access to the Ultraman shows.  And having them all reveals the changes in Ultraman's suit over the series and his various powers.  Nothing like seeing them in order!

962368,5,6305079757,"After waiting forever and a day Ultraman has finally arrived on DVD. I remember watching it on TV when I was a kid, when they had UHF channels, when you put off homework, and maybe watched Captain Scarlet afterwards. Ahhh! Good times.

Now this a 3 DVD set containing the first 20 episodes of the first series, UNCUT which you can watch in dubbed English (for those nostalgic denizens of Earth) or in it's original Japanese version (highly recommended). Actually the Japanese versions are better because you are getting the episodes that were aired in Japan in 1966 so there are no stupid edits made for commercials when the show was in syndication in the U.S.. And the audio track is much better than the dubbed one. You may also notice that some episodes go from English to Japanese. My theory is that the scenes in question were cut for U.S. distribution and syndication and therefore never originally dubbed in English so the only thing that survived was the original Japanese so to make it complete add the scenes with the subtitles. Makes sense to me.

Now the Special Features are a little slim. You get a very amateurish video interview with Peter Fernandez, Corrine Orr and Earl Hammond that is really not that insightful. I would have liked an audio track with them doing running commentary during the episodes. You also get a Kajiu (monster) encyclopedia and the opening U.S. credits. Now it would have been nice to have the Japanese actors tracked down and interviewed for this set (maybe that might be coming on future sets) but I am not in charge of these things.

As far as the quality goes, the video is as good as your going to get at this price-point. I have seen bootlegged DVD's and they were HORRIBLE and cost 4x as much with no features at all so why complain. The audio track for the Japanese version is far superior than the dubbed one but there are some phasing anomalies in the audio which can be kind of cool and groovy but keep in mind this isn't Citizen Kane so don't expect a major restoration effort, 5.1 audio, and letterboxed. This was a TV show meant to be viewed on TV and for under $30 bucks it's a bargain I can live with. Most of us probably last so Ultraman on an old Zenith console color television set with an antenna on the roof so compared to that this is like BlueRay.

So, if your fan of the show you will not be disappointed in this purchase. Order now, the power of Ultraman compels you.

962370,5,6305079757,"Introduction:  Ultraman is a live-action science-fiction/horror/fantasy program aimed at children.  I have fond memories of watching this show after kindergarten/first grade and then discussing it with friends the next day.  The show tackled some ethical quandries from time to time, and I learned some powerful lessons from this show (e.g. the necessity of justice, the need for mercy, the permanence of death).  Now a father with children of my own, I have greatly desired to share this program with my kids.  At last, I can...and they love it!

Overview:  The Science Patrol protects Japanese society from monsters.  One of their own, Hayata, is saved from death by a mysterious alien named Ultraman, who gives his life to Hayata.  If Hayata needs help, he merely needs to use the beta capsule, and Ultraman will appear to help defeat monsters.

Monsters ranged from truly evil to child-like, and both the Science Patrol and Ultraman would have to decide to destroy or preserve the monster.  Science Patrol members would sometimes question the virtue of their work.  Because the monsters were usually bad, the rare occasion of their being preserved was noteworthy and delivered a subtle message of mercy and compassion.  The destruction of the evil monsters provided a glimpse of the concept of justice.  (Understand that the monsters don't just get up and run away to return later, as they do in other shows.  They die.)

My Kids' Reactions to Problems:  Given all of the criticisms of the audio problems, I thought I should share my childrens' reactions.  Basically, they love the show.  The occasional lapse from English into Japanese (with or without subtitles) is funny to them, but it intrigues my older child, who has become curious about the differences between Japanese and English.  To them, the ""problems"" with the DVD are a non-issue.

Overall, I recommend this release.  I find the audio problems irritating, but they don't happen that often.  I'm glad to revisit an old childhood pleasure, and I'm grateful for the teaching opportunities this show provides.  We all anxiously await Volume 2.",1154736000,3,2108,5.078717201166181

I prefer the Japanese version, but I enjoy the subtitled version as well, the voice-over actors doing a superb job-it's like getting twice the content.  There are inconsistancy problems with the printed titles and the on-screen titles, but they don't cause any real confusion.  I found the quality to be very good over all.  Another point is that there were no collectable cards included, no big deal for me, but if you're a card freak and that is why you are buying this-be forewarned. If you have any interest in Ultraman you need this set, technically it's not crafted perfectly, but to see these again after almost 40 years is a real treat.",1154563200,2,791,4.669064748201439

I do believe the reason for the blips of japanese voicing and english subtitles when watching english dubb is frustrating and I know they were dubbed, I had seen them on tv many many years ago, i'm certain this was what they considered the fix to a nasty problem in the sound. Putting all that aside great batch of episodes, wish they could have fixed all to great quality but that is not always possible.

Look.  This isn't absolutely perfect.  The dub version has some pretty distracting audio problems, but they're transitory, and I am 99% certain it was the best they could do at the price-point they wanted to be able to offer. Could they have cleaned up the audio? I'm not sure, but I bet if they did the whiners would be whining that the set cost $75.00.

People are complaining about how it sometimes drops into subtitled Japanese--this is so that you can watch THE WHOLE EPISODE, for the first time ever in the US. The US version was previously heavily edited for time. And this simply illustrates my point, to wit:

This is a Japanese series.  The actors are Japanese.  The director was Japanese.  The scripts were in Japanese.  The expensive audio and video remastering done a couple of years ago for the Tsuburaya region 2 version was done by, you guessed it, Japanese. The English dub is an afterthought.  A treat for American fans too young to read.  It's a special feature at best. The Japanese audio is crystal clear; the subtitles are legible and accurate. AND THIS SHOW IS MEANT TO BE ENJOYED IN ITS ORIGINAL LANGUAGE (say it with me now, kids): JAPANESE!

And to the nimrod who complained that the DVD wasn't letterboxed: this show was produced for television 40 years ago. The aspect ratio in which it was presented is the aspect ratio on the DVD.  There is no letterboxed version.  Anywhere.  If you still want it letterboxed, ask your mommy or halfway house caregiver for the safety scissors, cut some black construction paper into two long strips, and TAPE IT TO THE SCREEN!

As for the DVD set itself, it is Ultra disapointing. Only for the fact that they didn't put the effort and care in manufacturing this set that it deserves. It's the little things like not being able to skip the show intro because the show chapters are divided weirdly. You have to fast forward through the intro manualy as you get tired of watching it 5 shows in.  Also if you stop the DVD and resume, it doesn't start where you stopped. It jumps to the nearest chapter break. The box also states that the shows are the unedited versions, which they are, but doesn't explain that the parts that were added do not have an english dub because obviously those parts were chopped out back when the show was originaly dubbed. It would have been better to redub these parts so it wouldn't be so jarring, but the least they could have done was to explain the situation either way so that newbies wouldn't think the show was defective as many have been stating.

Ultraman is kind of boring but is a real fantasy world that is so original.

It's definitely the grandad of Power Rangers and so many others.

One thing I did was watch them in the original language with subtitles.

The english dub is extra really but it's cool to watch them as originally intended.

And I am glad to say I was happy I bought it. The Picture quality is superb (taken from the Japanese master DVD no doubt), and even the complaining fans mostly agree on this, it is the audio that most people don't like, which can be explained. Unfortunately when Ultraman was first dubbed into English, the running time on each 1/2 hour show had to be cut down by 2 or 3 minuets to fit within the constraints of U.S. commercial television. This meant that certain scenes with dialogue were NEVER DUBBED IN ENGLISH. So as a result you may be watching this DVD, which is comepletely uncut, and japanese audio with english subtitles will pop up from time to time, these were for scenes cut from the American Broadcast version. Unfortunately Tsuburaya has locked away all the language dubbs of the original Ultraman and isn't releasing the rights to anyone, so all things considered I think BCI did a good job of obtaining a clear-as-possible copy of the english audio and mixing it with the Japanese uncut version. The only way the complaining fans could get the show they wanted would to have 2 seperate VIDEO tracks as well (the original japanese, and the edited U.S. version, which is only avalable in public domain). The video quality would be sub-standard, and the DVD set would cost DOUBLE for getting something of inferior quality. The only other option would be for a completely NEW English Voice track to be created, but then you wouldn't have the voices that we all grew up with. Be aware that the same thing will happen if we ever get Ultraseven on DVD and the Canadian English track (which was Heavily edited), is mixed with the unedited Japanese version (heck 3 episodes of that series were never even dubbed in english).

The english dub is not without its' issues (distortion, hiss, etc.), but I can't imagine that the source for these tracks from the 70's was in too decent a shape in the first place.

Switch to the japanese audio track, turn on the english subtitles, and enjoy the release as it was intended by its creators...

AHA! I stand corrected. The audio switching issue is NOT due to broadcast cuts. BCI were apparently not given the complete English dub. An older videotape release from Expressions in Animation demonstrates this, at least for Episode 1. There is a  scene where the Science Patrol talks briefly about the nature of the Color Timer. On this dvd release, with the english dub on, this scene reverts to english-subtitled japanese. On the EIA tape, this scene is dubbed entirely in english...

Is this a flawless release? No. It is, after all, a series that debuted in Japan 40 years ago, almost to the day. The japanese elements were meticulously remastered for their Japanese release a few years ago. The elements used in this release are not up to those standards, but are in a quite servicable shape.

Ultraman is a giant super hero who fights giant monsters in Japan.

Need I say more? This show was one of the first of its kind if

not the first and it is still one of the coolest shows ever made.

At times this program can be funny or scary or mysterious. It's

full of action, explosions, lasers and sci-fi x-files type situations.

Ultraman is primarily a kid's show, but it is also interesting and

fun for adults. The premise is simple. An alien or a monster

will show up who generally intends to take over the world or

wreck the city. The elite Science Patrol engages the monster but cannot win. Then Ultraman appears and saves the day.

The DVDs are pretty good. I don't think the problems are worth mentioning. I am glad BCI released this volume and I look forward

to volume 2.",1153699200,5,818,4.3509933774834435
962456,3,6305079757,"Thirty Five years ago, in the age of Superfriends and Johnny Quest, there was a small TV station in Atlanta called channel 17, which was owned by a guy named Ted Turner.  Day after day my friends and I would watch this station after school and on Saturday mornings, receiving a daily fix of entertainment gems like Clutch Cargo and the Banana Splits.  It was also here that I received my first taste of Japanese culture, in the form of Speed Racer and Ultraman.

If you are the parent of a small child, whatever you do, don't expose your children to this or any show originating in Japan.  Seriously.  It will screw your child's head up, just as it did mine.  Some people may think that a show featuring a bunch of guys in cheap latex suits smashing cardboard buildings and toy planes in just harmless entertainment.  Think again.  The truth is obvious.  The Japanese, still smarting over their defeat at the hands of the allies, sought and found an insidious way to get even.  By striking at the youngest and most vunerable of us; namely our children.  You may think I'm joking here, but seriously, I'm not. This show, and other shows from Japan like Pokemon or Power Rangers, will warp your child's brain.

Ultraman is a space opera set in a dystopian near future, a nightmare world where a virtually helpless civilian population lives in a state of constant fear, as rampaging monsters, over 50 foot high, regularly appear to reek havoc on major cities.  The only thing standing between civilization and a complete social breakdown is an elite fighting force known as The Science Patrol (which sounds a lot cooler if spoken in the original Japanese).  They have at their disposal an arsenal of the most sophisticated weapons known to man.  In fact, they've allocated so much towards their miltary budget that they literally didn't have enough funds left to purchase a decent automobile.  What's most disturbing is the fact that in the near future, Japan has become fully remilitarized.

The Science Patrol's cast of main characters has been imitated in numerous ensemble action films and TV series, most recently ""Armegeddon"" and ""Team America"".  There's the elderly leader (who frequently takes orders from Hiyata rather than gives them...strange), two slightly goofy members who provide comic relief from time to time,  the hot female member named Fuji, and Hiyata, the lead charcter who is the Clark Kent of the show.

Each episode follows a basic formula.  A monster appears, the Science Patrol promptly picks a fight with it, gets in over their heads, and then Ultraman shows up to bail them out.  While this may seem like an innocent premise, there are some very dark and disturbing underlying messages.  What parents may find troubling is the xenophobia that still permeated Japanese culture at the time that this show was made.  Some of these monsters are clearly sentient beings, yet the Science Patrol rarely  makes any attempt to resolve their conflicts diplomatically.  Like the Japanese of the pre-colonial era,  outsiders are usually considered an enemy who must be dealt with in a violent fashion.  And like the Japanese military during the second World War, the Science Patrol typically find themselves in over their heads and unable to finish the fight that they started.

Ultraman himself is an obvious metaphore for the Japanese army.  Although he comes out swinging, he's unable to stick in the fight for the long haul.  If he does not defeat his enemy quickly, his warning light begins to blink.  If it stops, he dies.  I won't use this forum to debate the logic of having a warning light on your chest that tells your enemies that you are getting tired.  The light itself obviously represents the Japanese rising sun.

The most insidious thing about this show is that it encourages young people not to utilize their critical thinking skills.  In most forms of narrative fiction, be it print or film, the plot details are slowly revealed through the actions and the dialogue.  Here, a narrarator clearly explains everything to the viewer.  This is clearly a Japanese plot to make our young people stupid, and we are only now starting to see the bitter fruit that this has produced.  Just look at our elections of 2000 and 2004.  No doubt many of these voters grew up watching Ultraman and Speed Racer.  With the advent of Power Rangers and Pokemon, we have probably lost another generation as well.

But now that I'm old enough to handle it, I can view Ultraman with a fresh perspective.  So, what do I think of goofy mosters smashing cardboard buildings an model airplanes?  I freaking love it!  I must admit.  I LOVE IT!  Now that I have the collection on DVD, and will gladly embrace the horror time after time after time.

For those out there with short attention spans:  if you don't want to sit through the entire episode and just want to see ""the good parts"", Ultraman does not actually appear in any episode until the clock is between 21:00 and 22:00, without exception.

Episodes of note:

Episode 1: Not very good.  ""I am Ultraman"" is cheesy even by this show's standards.  But it is the debut.

Episode 2: Not nearly as good as Episode 16, but it is the debut of the crab people.

Episode 4: This one really freaked me out when I was 5.  The monster looking in the window.  It stuck with me.

Episode 5: Plant Monster smashes church.  Blasphemous.

Episode 8: Ultraman visits Monster Island.  Way cool!

Episode 10: Ultraman vs. Godzilla. 'nuff said.

Episode 16:  The Crab People are Back!!!  One of the absolute best!  Debut of the lazor saw.

Episode 20:  Wow!!!  Aeial dogfights!  Some of the absolute best action of the entire collection.  Ultraman amost gets his a** kicked.  A very good episode.

Disapointment:  this collection did not feature the moster who looked just like R. Shulman, from elementary school.  You know who you are, dude.  The moster with big broad shoulders looks just like you.  I was disappointed that this episode wasn't on this collection.  I was looking foward to laughing at you.

Special Effects:  I love them.  If you judge them against today's standards, you're totally missing the point.  The filmakers obviously loved what they were doing and took their craft very seriously, and it comes through.  And they do get better as the series progresses.

About the DVD transfers:  all the negative comments about the DVD quality is justified.  I don't really care that much, though.  Its not ""Lord of the Rings"", after all.  All the restoration in the world isn't going to change the fact that this is a forty year old TV show with really bad (and by bad I mean ""AWESOME"") special effects.",1153612800,15,6657,4.773286467486819

Perhaps BCI should be given a special trophy for being the first at something.

962491,5,6305079757,"I received my copy of this dvd on July 19 - after having waited many many years. And a lot of people are dissing this release and frankly, I don't care:

Sure, it's no Blu-Ray or HD-DVD..But I watched the first 7 episodes on my 50"" Sony SXRD and thought it was quite good considering it's a 40 year old show. I don't care if it's not the ""official"" release/masters from Tsuburaya. When are we going to understand that ithere is NEVER going to be an official ""authorized"" release in the US by them?

Most people who are checking this item out have literally waited YEARS to see this show again. To see Ultraman battle all those great monsters again is incredible....All the rest of us already have multiple copies/versions of this show and have probably shelled out hundreds of dollars for it over the years....Having to pay just $20 to get half of the series and relive those childhood memories is WORTH THE MONEY. Ok, so in some places the japanese bleeds into the english or there are subtitles. They probably could have fixed this. Why they didn't I don't know but then again....I don't care!! I can't wait for the next one.

And I'll admit the quality of the bonus feature interview with the people who voiced the English version is pretty bad. No doubt filmed on a cheap video camera at a convention years ago. But, considering that Earl Hammond ( who played Hayata among others ) is deceased it's still a pretty cool little thing if you haven't seen it before.

Bottom linw is this: If you are a fan of this show and have been waiting forever to see it again you will NOT be disappointed!",1153526400,12,1594,4.4673539518900345

Once BCI had obtained the legal rights to release Ultraman, they had the option to seek out prints from different sources if the ones they were provided with were poor. But I am not conviced that the versions they were handed were of poor quality. I believe that all the defects here are in the digitatal video production and transfer and not in the prints they were provided. The audio noise and video imperfections are the result of poor production and manufacture on the part of BCI.  The choppy stilted movement of the video is a digital fowl-up. The noise in the audio could have been removed quite easily if they had only taken the time to do so. They just didn't care to.",1153526400,5,781,4.423611111111111
962494,4,6305079757,"Like many others I've waited a long time to see Ultraman again and am thrilled about this DVD set. It's a great show, just the way I remember it... in fact it's funnier than I could have realized back when I was a kid. Several of the shows are downright magical especially 'The Rambunctious One From Space.' The writing in this particular show is funny, touching and sometimes just scary enough for kids. Great family viewing or wonderful if you're just into the kitsch of it all.

For new fans thinking about getting this set: you're about to see the origins of Power Rangers and other similar shows. Only the original Ultraman is the king of the genre and never successfully imitated.

For anyone reading all of the harsh reviews, be aware that bootleg versions of these shows are NOT better. It is true that the sound on this set is often poor but it is the best we're going to get. And the fact that it includes the original Japanese language track (and subtitles) puts it well above the bootleg dubs on the market. Picture quality ranges from excellent to just okay but that must be down to the available source. Overall it is not as bad as others are suggesting but it's true that sound quality is not always great.

Sound quality aside, there are several flaws I can find. The hope is that the manufacturer will rectify some of them:

1. A couple of episodes have glitches that cause the picture to freeze. On my computer they cause my player to crash. On my home player it just causes a momentary freeze.

2. The titles in the booklet and on the menus do not match the titles on the DVD packaging. This is a minor issue but it seems sloppy for such a beautiful packaging job.

3. The booklet does not explain some of the manufacturing issues... like the fact that the show reverts to Japanese from time to time (its difficult to know if this is because of the lack of English dub or a defect as others have suggested). It would also have been helpful if the makers of this set had taken the time to explain some of the picture and sound quality issues.

4. Sometimes the English version of the theme song plays at the beginning and sometimes the Japanese version plays. It's difficult to know if this is on purpose but it's confusing and seemingly just sloppy design.

5. Where are the collectible trading cards? I suppose those were pulled because of licensing issues but that's a shame. I was looking forward to them even if it's not that big of a deal.

The bottom line is that this is not a perfect release but it's really the show that presides. The major flaws will hopefully get fixed but we'll have to live with poor sound quality. We're just lucky that someone has preserved this great piece of pop culture.

I give the show an ""A-"" (the early shows are slightly boring) and the DVD a ""C"" (great packaging, sloppy manufacturing and poor sound).",1153526400,44,2861,4.46360153256705
962495,5,6305079757,"I've read people complaining that when people are watching the movie in English dub mode that it switches to Japanese dub with English subtitles sometimes, there IS a reason for this.

When the show were shown in American a couple minutes needed to be cut from the episodes so that the show could be shown with ad breaks. The shows were edited and then dubbed. Because of this, there are several minutes in each episode that were NEVER dubbed into English.

When this DVD was put together the company took the only existing dub, and placed it over the video, however there are parts of the episode that dubs dont' exist for, so they decided to leave those parts in Japanese with subtitles. It's not a mistake on the DVD, it's really the only way it could have been done, without having a whole new dub created.",1153440000,7,810,4.503401360544218

I have mostly been watching in original Japanese with subtitles, mostly because I'm used to Anime and like to listen in the original language.

962593,3,6305079757,"Some of the reviewers think the Japanese audio bleed-in error is intentional due to edits in the original English dubbing for commercial breaks.  They are only guessing.

I have access to the VHS copies of the English-dubbed versions and they are speaking English on the exact sequences that the Japanese audio is sneaking in on. Case in point, in episode 1, the crew of the plane is surmising what Ultraman's blinking light indicates.  On the VHS, this dialogue is in English.  On this new DVD, the Japanese audio breaks in.  This must be an engineering flaw in the DVD release.

This release is not garbage; neither is it a stellar production.  It does have audio problems with hiss and changes to Japanese inexplicably for several seconds within the show.  The bootlegs I have seen don't even do that! The hiss can be filtered out through my stereo; it's not THAT bad.  The color and clarity are very good. The Monster Encyclopedia is OK, but it only features the monsters within the first 20 episodes.  That makes sense but it is not clear up front. The interview with the English-dub cast was obviously made years ago as Earl Hammond died in 2002.  My guess is that they purchased this simply made video and decided to use it as a bonus feature.  They had no control over the quality of the original source material.  It's better than no interview at all !!

I can't understand why the Japanese credits are the default for this American release.  That would only makes sense if Japanese was the default audio. I agree that we should be able to choose the English version of the opening credits, as we can with audio. Overall, I'm glad to see this release.  However, the production company and its engineers should be ashamed to release a product with such poor quality control.  If they don't correct all the issues for Volume Two, then they will be as bad as all of the other reviewers make them out to be.  They should be willing to provide clean copies to those of us who complain about Volume One.  Buyers beware!",1153440000,11,2022,4.597765363128492

I was thrilled when I heard it was finally being released and I have to admit, it is fun to watch this again after all these years. But I have to agree that this is a poor production. The special features are anything but. Poorly filmed interviews with the english voice cast, the english opening sequence and monster files detailing the baddies. The video pauses, pixlates and jerks consistantly, once, even switching back to the menu screen in the middle of an episode. This is my second copy by the way, having returned the first thinking it was defective, boy was I wrong. And I found it so irritating when the english dub suddenly switched to japanese right in the middle of the first episode that I don't even bother listening to it anymore. The Japanese track is much less jarring but, like the english, it still seems to speed up and slow down all through the episodes, hardly ever matching the actor's lips. This one only rates 2 stars because I'm just happy to see this show again. It's still Ultraman. It's still fun for nastalgia's sake.

(To those not familiar with the series{ Ultraman is a japanese program dubbed into english. The dubbing was, perhaps, the best dubbing ever done on an imported Japanese film.) When this DVD does have parts in english, the sound is very out of synch with the movie. Also, the sound IS very very bad. And I agree that I cannot hear a word that Peter Fernandes and company are saying. So even the extras are bad. The U.S. version opening credits were lifted from episode four of the Expresions In Animation VHS that came out in 1996.  It also sounds awfulI, but on the original tape it sounded great. I have never purchased a video, imported or otherwise, as bad as this one. Never.

962596,3,6305079757,"Review by Michael Anthony of MAACP Radio. - I've been waiting for a decent copy of Ultraman probably as long as most of you. And I've seen my share of bootlegs. Here's how it stacks up.

The video quality has been restored somewhat. It's clearer than my ""official vcd release"" put out in Japan only by TSUBURAYA PRODUCTIONS. That version has no englsih audio by the way, but is a beautiful addition for an Ultraman collector. (I'm always looking for cool collectables.) The DVD tracking does freeze up on occasion for a few seconds here and there. The English text closing is in the special features section. And there are additional problems.

The audio sounds much better than any vhs or beta version. Yes, episode one has that terrible loss of English dub right there in the heart of the episode. Happens at the same spot on the boot legs. I can't remember whether it was like that on my favorite UHF channel when I was a kid but no matter. The quality changes here and there but I must stress that I haven't heard anything better. And I can't understand Mandarin Chinese so what am I to do?

The poor special features section really is a slap in the face especially to those wonderful actors who dubbed the series in English. This interview seems to have been filmed and edited by Lancelot Link and the agents from APE... well more likely the chimps from CHUMP. I was angered that these people who were part of our own pop culture (Speed Racer, Marine Boy...) were filmed as if they were trying out for some early 70's indie porn company. It was sad... funny... sad.

I personally wrote TSUBURAYA PRODUCTIONS a few years back asking them if a deal could be struck to let my company release the set on DVD and was told in a very blunt letter that TSUBURAYA PRODUCTIONS had no interest whatsoever in releasing the series in English and or in the USA. - I, of course was quite stunned. I do believe that for the right amount, we will see the real, official release at some point. (i.e.; Speed Racer) After all, it had been said that George Lucas would never release the trilogy on DVD.

I think that ""if"" CHAIYO PRODUCTIONS, the company that put together this DVD set, felt like they needed to do it quickly before TSUBURAYA PRODUCTIONS had a chance to stop it, then it just might be the reason for this messy release. More than likely though, they're just a cheap company that cuts corners wherever possible and makes as much as they can, as quick as they can.

My bottom line is you may as well get this version for what it does offer. And when a better version comes along, snatch it up! Maybe we'll forget about the $20 that we spent here. Even with all of its horrors, Ultraman: Series One, Volume 1 was worth it for me. Yes, I'll buy Series One, Vol 2. After all, I know someone personally who spent over $100 on a lousy VHS version. That guy. He was such a sucker!",1153267200,9,2872,4.4196597353497165
962597,5,6305079757,"Ok, first off, I have to respectfully disagree with the bad reviews here re: quality of this release.  After reading them, and then buying the set, I was pleasantly suprised when I popped it in the dvd player.  The video quality is very good (without question better than any of the three different bootlegs sets I've seen) and the audio dub is, well, pretty good.  Was the audio totally restored and cleaned up? No, I don't think so but it doesn't sound overly noisy (again, especially compared to bootlegs).  I have the Japanese laserdisc set and I also have the Japanese DVD box set that was fully remastered (video and audio [only in Japanese though - no english dub or subtitle included]).  The picture quality on the Japanese dvd set is amazing but this set looks pretty d*mn good...AND this set has the english dub and subtitles!  AND it's very affordable!  For $20, packaging is great, as are the menus and booklet.  If you're an ultraman fan, should you buy it? ABSOLUTELY!!

Re: the TSUBURAYA PRODUCTIONS VS. CHAIYO PRODUCTIONS issue, it is a shame.  Ultraman deserves the best quality release and it's out there!  This set does have it's quirks (some spots where the dub isn't present, strange chapter marks, haven't found the original english intro yet - maybe it's here somewhere) but Tsuburaya has never made much of an effort to try to release this much loved series to the U.S. --- I love AND support Tsuburaya (again, bought the Tsuburaya Laserdisc and DVD Japanese Box sets...for a small fortune) but c'mon...40 years and nothing!

Go buy this - you'll love it!  And maybe, if it sells enough, Tsuburaya will take notice and find a way to release a-Japanese equivalent 11 DVD fully remastered English set...but if you want to feel like a kid again, running home afterschool to flip on channel 48 (well, in philly area), this is, without question, the best $20 you could spend!",1153267200,20,1894,4.737804878048781
962598,4,6305079757,"First off to answer the question of ""Captain Vegetable"", there was a show called ""Spectreman"". It was a low budget rip off of Ultraman. It seemed to be on an even smaller budget then ""Zone Fighter"", which was cool. Zone Fighter at least had Toho monsters like Gojira and King Ghidorah make guest appearences. Spectreman wasn't horrible; just not as fantastic as ""Ultraman"" and ""Zone Fighter"". On to the Ultraman volume one set. It is incredible to have Ultraman finally available in the good ole U.S. The box set was obviously made by fans of Ultraman and Japanese cinema, like myself. I grew up watching this show, like the rest of us. The quality of the set is good. The video is what is to be expected for a 60's tv show. But one does wonder if they were able to get material from the original vaults. The audio, while not bad, does leave a little to be desired with the annoying hissing sound. It does not take away from the sheer enjoyment and achievements of this box set. Some websites state that there are 2 free cards that come with this set. Well, mine did not come with any cards.  And strangely, in the middle of the 8 page booklet, there seems to be a page ripped out; can't confirm that at this point. Overall, great presentation and menus. Major kudos for including the original Japanese language tracks. That was just plain awesome. Hopefully more companies, like the company that is handling the ""Gojira"" 2 disc set due out September 5th, will appreciate Asian cinema and continue to release the ""original"" versions of the tv shows and films that we love. Companies like Sony Pictures/Columbia Tristar, Tartan Asia Extreme, Tokyo Shock/Media Blasters(even though they don't keep to their release dates and their retail store availabilty sucks), Image Entertainment, Panik House, Discotek, Synapse Films, Cult Epics, Palm Pictures, TLA Releasing, Tai Seng, Manga, Viz Media and Geneon: KEEP UP THE FINE JOB YOU ARE DOING!!! My hat is off to  all of you. Buy or order Ultraman volume one and then get volume two when it releases. They are worth every penny.

962600,4,6305079757,"Arriving exactly 40 years after it's premiere on Japanese television, the Region One Ultraman box set has been revealed as a box of ultra love.  The people who put this together know their stuff and it shows all over the discs and the packaging.

Most notable of this release are the language tracks.  Not only do you get the English dubs we all grew up with, but the original Japanese audio as well (contrary to Amazon's description) along with fresh subtitles.  This is an extra special treat for those of you who have grown to love anime and Japanese cinema.

The picture is as good as can be expected from a 60s television series. The audio isn't bad either.  Not great... but not bad.  This is the best way -- and the only way -- you're gonna see Ultraman, and it's not all that bad!

DVD menus are somewhat cool.  It's obvious the designers know the show.  This is even more evident with the package design.  A somewhat sturdy foil slip case -- complete with an embossed image  of our hero on the front -- holds a three-disc set, each in it's own slimcase.  And everywhere you look, there's a monster.  The set also comes with an 8-page booklet outlining the birth of Ultraman and a rundown on the episodes in the set.

My one complaint are the chapter marks.  The theme of the show is a lot longer in the original Japanese version and you're not likely to watch it over and over.  Why, then, the end of chapter one does not coincide with the closing of the theme is beyond me.  If you're going to skip over it, you're going to have to fast forward through it.

Bottom line: if you grew up with Ultraman then you need this box set.  Get it!  And relive the adventures.  You'll experience a deja vu of nostalgia.  You'll laugh at some of the effects.  You'll wonder why the Science Patrol has a huge building... for only 5 members.  Why the phone sounds like Ghidorah when it rings.

I have wanted this series for decades, and, while I don't expect the quality to be as nice as the Japanese DVDs, they should be close enough. I am now 50 years old and do not care to wait until Tsuburaya decides to release the ""official"" version...SHOOWAT! (PS 07/2008: Picture quality is fine, and the scenes that were edited out of the English versions are reinserted with Japanese subtitles. I'm happy to report that both Ultraman sets from BCI are well worth getting!)",1149984000,10,560,4.666666666666667
962637,4,6305079757,i heard and read rumors on ultraman forums that tsuburaya productions will most probably file an injunction in u.s. courts blocking the sale to the new ultraman dvd.,1149292800,5,165,4.928571428571429

962639,5,6305079757,"While I'm aware of all the rancor over the legal proceedings surrounding the ""Ultraman"" property rights, this DVD is a completely legitimate and legal release-- which is more than can be said about the thousands of bootleg copies of the series that have been floating around for years.  Sounds like this release will include lots of nice extras, including both the Japanese soundtrack and the original English dubs as well as interviews with the English speaking voice actors.  It will be nice to finally have this iconic Japanese series on an officially licensed Region 1 DVD compilation.",1148342400,8,589,5.061855670103093
962640,5,6305079757,"Considering the lack of mainstream availability for this series, I found the $45 price to be satisfactory.  It is not crystal clear perfect video reproduction, but well within the expectations of the price range.  Packaging and presentation exceeded my expectations.  If you are looking for a stroll down memory lane (it is always much cheesier than you remembered as a kid), this is an affordable blast from the past.  I give it 5 stars because the price fits the product.  You get what you pay for, which is pretty good bang for the buck.",1143936000,,540,4.702127659574468

7882429,5,6305079757,Much improved video and audible over a previously bought Ultraman disk by the same company found in a bargain bin for less the $2. Definitely worth the extra money is this 2 disk set. In addition to the huge improvement in video and sound the new disk keeps the English dubbing along with English subtitles that are hilarious because they aren't the same as the dialog! All this adds to the charm of the Ultraman series. Perfect for 4 year olds and mature fun loving adults.,1510272000,,474,4.523255813953488

Pretty repetitive too, a new monster to fight each episode.  Fun for what it is but really cheesy even by kaiju standards.",1494633600,,296,4.068965517241379
