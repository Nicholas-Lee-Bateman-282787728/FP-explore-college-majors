Sasha Cohen and Alexei Yagudin were my favorites. Sale and Pelletier also did a really fun number.if you can get this and watch it,I definately say go for it!",1148688000,,281,4.73469387755102
7958770,4,B0000639LW,".. as previously stated, the feeling of the video is edited and the performances cut off at the end, missing the sometimes loud and lengthy ovations from the crowd.
Fortunately, most of the performances in the exhibition are included in their entirety.  Michelle Kwan's performance to Eva Cassidy's haunting remake of Sting's ""Fields of Gold"" is probably the most beatiful and emotional skating performance I've ever seen, and it's included here.  Hearing Scott Hamilton's voice breaking as he's reacting to the performance was heartfelt and probably representative of most skating fans.
But there is much more here - the amazing Russian male skaters (Plushenko and Yagudin) and the pairs (Canada vs. Russia), Timothy Goebel etc.  Lots of great skating and heartfelt performances.. if only the judges would get with the times and let the skaters use lyric-inclusive music in competition, skating's appeal would increase tenfold.
