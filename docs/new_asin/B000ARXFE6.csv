2391946,5,B000ARXFE6,I liked this movie because it was a different version of beauty and the beast. I love old fashioned romance.,1313280000,4,108,4.45
2391947,4,B000ARXFE6,"I read the book in my youth and had fond memories of a romance with enough conflict/tension vs passion to make it interesting. The story is a little far-fetched, but I think its focus is on the characters' developing relationship.
I liked the character of Bolt in both the book and the film, eventhough he was a little stereotypical.  Susan Penhaligon was well cast, I thought and Keir Dullea had the right look if a little annoying with his American accent.  His character and dialogue were less passionate than those in the book.  The ending was a little wooden.",1256428800,,564,4.6767676767676765
2391948,4,B000ARXFE6,"Very watchable story, I think more a womans romantic "" cup of tea "" and my  wife having read the book really enjoyed the film.",1251504000,,126,4.04
2391949,5,B000ARXFE6,"I taped this movie from Cinemax YEARS ago and I have played it until it's grainy. It's hard to understand why Leopard in the Snow got such poor reviews, as I thought it was a good story told well. Of course the plot is contrived - what do you expect from a film based on a Harlequin Romance, but the acting is superb. Crisp, tight directing propels the story by subtle - and not so subtle - twists and turns and exacts compelling performances by the entire cast. There is one of the most sensual love scenes, accompanied by the most stirring music in this movie that I have ever seen - and it has nothing to do with overt sexuality or sexual behavior beyond a kiss. I am thrilled to find it now available on DVD.",1199664000,10,712,4.204379562043796
2391950,4,B000ARXFE6,"Even though this movie was made in 1978, I loved it! I actually have the book and I read that first. Then I found out it was turned into a movie so of course I had to get it too! My only complaint is that the movie seemed so fast so the love connection seemed a bit impossible but I guess since its a movie they had to speed it up. I wish they would have showed me a bit of the ""after the happy ending"" like they kinda did in the book, but of course its a happy ending so I'm still happy. Oh yeah, did I say Keir Dullea was hunky? He sorta looks like that guy in Lord of the Rings, Viggo Morstensen",1153612800,6,598,3.753968253968254

8079509,2,B000ARXFE6,"The film itself is well acted, however, the video presentation on Amazon Instant Video is terrible.  It looks like a copy of a well-worn VHS tape, with very blurry picture and washed out color.  Amazon should demand a better print from the company that provides this film.",1442361600,,272,4.76595744680851
8079510,5,B000ARXFE6,A bit different than the book but I enjoyed both! Love Keir Dullea!,1436227200,,67,4.230769230769231
8079511,4,B000ARXFE6,"Okay, this was a nostalgia purchase for me. I first saw it as an impressionable romantic young woman about 35 years ago, so in today's technology, I guess you could say it's somewhat cheesy. Now, as a very mature adult, doggone it, I still like it. Good old-fashioned romance with no or very little foul language & no bed scenes. Just a lot of falling-in-love tension & your imagination. Yeah!",1431993600,,393,4.628571428571429
8079512,3,B000ARXFE6,This film is well acted. The female lead could be a secret twin of Mia Farrow. I watched only because I adore Kier Dullea and there just are not enough of him in film. He's fabulous. The writing is old school romance novel and pretty cheesy.,1431302400,,241,4.260869565217392
8079513,5,B000ARXFE6,This replaces the VHS copy I recorded at the time it first came out. I still enjoy this first movie made on Harlequin books.,1418947200,,124,4.208333333333333
8079514,5,B000ARXFE6,I am very happy with it I watched this movie in 1978 with my nana just before she died and I  have been trying to source it since she died but you cannot buy it in newzealand so I am stokeed,1364774400,2,190,3.6341463414634148
8079515,4,B000ARXFE6,"I gave this DVD four stars. The picture quality is fairly good as far as the DVD itself goes, considering the movie was filmed in 1978.  I read the paperback novel years ago when I was a teen, but for some reason never did see the movie when it originally debuted or when it was featured on T.V. Anyhow, I was pleasantly surprised. In my opinion, the acting is above average with a good cast and the storyline flowed well. There were some scenes with the leopard, of course, but the overriding theme is about the heroine, Helen, and her love interest, Dominic. Some of the storyline is a bit of a stretch, but overall it worked for me. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys romance novels which make it to the screen. I paid a little more than I normally would for an older movie on DVD such as this one, but if you like romance stories based on novels, this is a sweet one to add to your collection,",1363996800,,910,4.2298850574712645
8079516,3,B000ARXFE6,"it is a fair movie, but not at all what I was looking for. I was hoping for a movie about leopards and got a romance",1356393600,,116,3.5
8079517,5,B000ARXFE6,"""LITS"" was the very first romance/Harlequin novel I ever read, so it holds a special place in my heart.  The movie closely follows the book except for a certain plot point that I still don't agree with, but it doesn't harm the movie as a whole.  Also, at first, Keir Dullea didn't quite strike me as a Harlequin hero, but he grew on me after awhile...

The plot is classic Harlequin: Helen James flees her comfortable, stifling life in London.  Her car dies, she gets out to seek help,and encounters not only a leopard in the snow but its owner, a grimly handsome man who gruffly offers his hospitality...but when Helen recognizes her host is Dominic Lyall, a racecar driver whose brother died in a horrific crash, Dominic makes her his captive until he can establish a new identity and go back into hiding.  Trapped, Helen's feelings begin to shift and change--but can her growing love melt Dominic's icy heart?

I love this movie; it respects the source material and the acting is fine throughout.  A splendid adaptation of what's possibly my favorite book, and you can't ask for more than that!",1342828800,,1097,4.682291666666667
