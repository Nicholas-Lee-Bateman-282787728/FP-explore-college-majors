8176574,4,6300229734,"Another excellent compilation of rare cartoons . In this tape :
two more Fleischers' cartoons , "" Small Fry "" and the surreal
"" Betty Boop's crazy inventions "" ; one Chuck Jones from the early forties "" Inki and the Minah bird "" ; one of the best Duffy
Duck's from the second world war period ,  by Frank Tashlin who would work later with Jerry Lewis directing him in some of his best films ; one silent Walt Disney , "" Alice the toreador "" ; Pat Sullivan's "" Felix the catin non-stop fright "" ; one of the first  Looney Toons fromthe serie "" Bosko "" and the jevell of this compilation , a short with animated puppets by Charlie Bowers , a master of stop-motion animation of the early era of the cinema . The only problem of the tape is that some of the prints are not of very good quality . Anyway , I recomend it very much.",1017360000,2,825,4.024390243902439
