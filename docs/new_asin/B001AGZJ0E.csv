3447991,5,B001AGZJ0E,I really like her workouts.  I really gets you moving and works many muscle groups.,1223769600,3,83,4.533333333333333
3447992,5,B001AGZJ0E,"I've always liked Ellen Barrett -- her calm voice, her clear cueing, and her integrated workout series.  This DVD is another demonstration of Ellen's exercising philosophy -- integrating the full body by incorporating cardio, strength, and stretches.  To me this program is more of static strength trainings than yoga.  I still break a sweat even after having used the DVD for a few weeks.  Try it.  You won't be disappointed!",1222992000,6,426,5.0285714285714285
3447993,5,B001AGZJ0E,"I love Ellen's workouts.  She is so easy and pleasant to follow.  This one packs it all and is definitely her toughest yet.  It doesn't necessarily get your heart racing, but you're sure to break a serious sweat using such ""seemingly"" simple movements.  It is a fabulous full body, toning, stretching workout.  I highly recommend this one.  For beginners I would recommend trying her Crunch Super SlimDown Pilates Yoga Blend first and if that's up your alley then definitely give this one a shot when you're up for more of a challenge.",1222128000,7,535,4.760869565217392
3447994,5,B001AGZJ0E,"I own several Ellen Barrett led workouts, and this is one of the better ones.  She's always chipper and outgoing without being anoying or offputting and she leads very well, with clear instruction so you shouldn't get lost too much.
All up, this is about 45 minutes and great to do either after a strenuous workout, or at the end of a hard day.  You will definately increase flexibility and balance after doing this even only a couple of times.  It does get a little easier with each try.  With all the yoga moves, there is also muscle toning too.  I love the little stretches between moves.  There is nice relaxing instrumental music and overall the workout is relaxing (yet you will feel this for the next day or so).
I really enjoy doing this (I'm not a major Yoga fan, but enjoy this one) and have done it even twice in one day for the heck of it.  It's great and Ellen is great.  She's a terrific instructor who clearly loves doing yoga and teaches well.  I highly recommend this one.",1215993600,44,989,4.3901098901098905
3447995,5,B001AGZJ0E,"Just like Ellen Barrett's other two Buff Girl releases, this is a barefoot mat workout that lasts approximately forty-five minutes and will give you a thorough workout for your time spent.  The video is shot inside The Studio, Ellen's workout space, which means the background is fairly boring.  The moves are demonstrated by Ellen and two assistants, one of whom demonstrates modifications of the moves.

I particularly like Ellen Barrett as an instructor, and own almost all of her videos.  Her cueing is excellent and easy to follow, she has a pleasant and calm voice, and she gives you encouragement and motivation to keep going when the going gets tough.  She also has the type of lean, dancer-like (very feminine) body that I am working toward rather than a chiseled or muscular body like many other fitness instructors.

As you can probably tell from the title, this particular workout is more yoga oriented than her other Buff Girl Fitness videos (which involve more pilates), and includes poses that should be familiar to anyone with even the most basic yoga background:  downward facing dog, Warrior I and II, etc.  Some knowledge of basic yoga positions would be helpful when trying this video, but is not required in order to follow the exercises and get a good workout.  The poses here are relatively simple to follow, and even people who are inflexible and/or out of shape (like me) should be able to follow along.  One caveat:  There were more inverted poses in this workout than what I am generally used to doing, which left me a little light-headed afterwards.

The workout itself is not simply a yoga workout either, but incorporates stretching, toning, pilates posture and an emphasis on flexibility.  The exercises, including the yoga poses, include unique twists by the instructor to make them more effective and interesting.  The first thirty minutes of exercise are standing, and the last fifteen are spent on the floor.  In particular, this workout is geared toward toning and strengthening the female trouble areas of the abs, thighs, and hips.

In short, I can't say enough good things about Ellen Barrett.  As an advanced beginner/intermediate exerciser, I recommend this workout highly to any level of exerciser, and believe you will find it to be both challenging and invigorating, no matter what your fitness level.  I have been using this video in conjunction with her other two Buff Girl Fitness videos&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fat-Burning-Fusion/dp/B000ZZT7BS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fat Burning Fusion</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slim-Sculpt/dp/B0013KGWBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slim Sculpt</a>&nbsp;on a rotating schedule for a well-balanced training series.",1213920000,87,2810,5.634204275534442
3447996,5,B001AGZJ0E,"The first time I did this workout I was a whimpering, sweaty mess.  However, I have done Ellen's workouts for so  long that I really trusted her to deliver a rewarding workout.  So I persevered, and after 5 or 6 times through it I really came to love it.

The hurdle for me was mainly developing the upper body strength to do all the downward dog, plank, cobra, etc poses.  This makes it sound like a yoga class, which it really is not. The workout also greatly challenges my flexibility. It's so strenuous (for me anyway) yet so flowing and graceful.

So I am whimpering less as I gain strength and flexibility.  But I really have to be up for it.  You can't fake your way through this one!

All of Ellen Barrett's videos are great, especially the latest ""Studio"" series.  They are the current mainstay of my lifelong endeavor to fitness.  I love the invigorating, yet placid and unhurried nature of her workouts.",1212451200,48,914,4.512195121951219

3448001,5,B001AGZJ0E,I have some other Ellen Barett exercise DVDs but this is by far my favorite.  The floor work is challenging and definitely works your core. It is a great blend of yoga and pilates.,1401753600,,180,4.294117647058823

3448004,5,B001AGZJ0E,Ellen's Yogini Workout is challenging!  She suggests great work-arounds until each pose is comfortable.  Ellen is a fantastic and motivating instructor.,1390521600,,152,6.190476190476191
3448005,5,B001AGZJ0E,"I enjoyed this workout......very easy....but as an advanced fitness enthusiast, I don't feel it provides a 'thorough' effective workout.

3448006,4,B001AGZJ0E,"I originally was interested in this as a yoga workout.  As a yoga workout, it's merely ok.  It's meant to be more of a yoga-inspired workout.

3448008,5,B001AGZJ0E,"This is a great workout.  I don't really like real yoga but this is great.  You get some strength and stretch and you will sweat.  The music isn't the greatest, but it isn't too bad either.  I really felt challenged and look forward to doing this at least once a week.",1370908800,,268,4.196078431372549

3448011,5,B001AGZJ0E,"I just tried this one yesterday and woke up sore today!  Great workout, easy to follow.  I am not a Yoga person.  I get so bored with it.

3448012,5,B001AGZJ0E,"any of ellen barrett video's are excellent.  a very easy, non-intense workout but boy do you break a sweat.  i think she is very easy to follow - a great exercise video for all ages.",1366934400,,182,4.171428571428572
3448013,4,B001AGZJ0E,"I love Ellen and have a lot of her videos.  This is definitely one of the more challenging ones and is usually the one I pull out when I've had a donut earlier in the day.  I really like this workout, but the music is terrible.  To be clear, i'm not commenting on how the music sounds.  It's interesting and peaceful, but its terrible exercise music.  There are times when it's really hard to hear the beat and other times when the moves seem to be going at a different tempo than the music.  Some of these exercises are REALLY challenging and its very frustrating to be doing plank or down dog hip drops and get completely out of sinc with her only to realize that you have 3 more left than you thought you did.  I've noticed this with a couple of her other workouts.  It's really important for exercise music to have a steady beat.  Especially ones like Ellen's that ask you to get into the flow of the movements.  You can't flow if you're constantly having to speed up or slow down.  Love this workout, hate the music.",1366675200,,1021,4.293193717277487
3448014,5,B001AGZJ0E,"If you love stretching and getting a great workout, this one is for you.  It would be a little tough for beginners, but if you eased into it, you will love it.  The workout concentrates on Belly, Butts and Thighs, and you will feel it!",1366156800,,235,4.2
3448015,5,B001AGZJ0E,"I loved this workout; I liked how well the whole workout flowed from one exercise to another and was pleasantly surprised that I broke a sweat doing this!  Fantastic for days I don't feel like lifting weights or too much cardio, just want to stretch and feel good.  I liked this better than her Pilates Yoga Blend; liked the overall feel of the entire workout and it didn't seem as repetitive as PYB.",1362355200,,400,4.465753424657534
3448016,5,B001AGZJ0E,"i love ellen barretts videos. i have been doing 2 of her other videos and really have been wanting to learn yoga. definitely not as easy as i thought it would be. im new to yoga and i could do about half the video, probably less. But my insides(abs) hurt for 2 full days. so it deff works. Im excited to get more flexible to be able to do the video, it will take some time but ellen makes it enjoyable. and this is coming from someone who hates working out.",1361836800,,457,4.032967032967033
3448017,5,B001AGZJ0E,"I have become a fan of Ellen Barrett. She is upbeat without going over the top. This is one of her more challenging workouts and I almost caved in to the couch  halfway through. But one of the other instructors in the video offers modifications and that is helpful.  After a few more tries, I was able to get through the video and felt stretched and challenged.
This is a video you will use over and over.",1361491200,,405,4.246753246753247
3448018,5,B001AGZJ0E,"This is not a Yoga workout.  It combines yoga moves with pilates, stretching, cardio, etc.  Don't be scared by the title of this DVD.  It is much more than typical yoga.  Love it!  Ellen always does such a great job with her workouts.  I'm a fan.",1361404800,,246,4.239130434782608
3448019,5,B001AGZJ0E,"I have Ellen's ""Yogini Workout"", ""Fat Burning Fusion"" and ""Slim Sculpt""**. I have been doing these exercise programs for three years. I am 60 years old and have always done some mild yoga to keep my body flexible and my core strong. I've never been one to do weight lifting or serious cardio. Ellen's workouts keep me feeling great. I alternate between the three videos during the week (Mon, Wed, Fri)and do my treadmill in between for more cardio. Over the years, I've joined various exercise programs only to quit because of the inconvenience. With Ellen, I can do the routines right in my own home, first thing in the morning, then get on with my day. I have two other of her tapes, but prefer the three I mentioned. I believe these exercise programs will keep me feeling good and hopefully prevent some of the stiffness and lack of mobility that plagues many of us as we get older. Thanks, Ellen!
**I did a review for ""Skinny Sculpt"" as well, but prefer ""Slim Sculpt"".",1357862400,,972,4.56
3448020,5,B001AGZJ0E,Ellen is encouraging and calm.  While I am dripping sweat I am enjoying a sense of inner peace and the knowledge that in the end I am doing my body a favor.,1357171200,,156,3.875
3448021,5,B001AGZJ0E,"A little different spin on the Barrett style. I am not a yoga buff but wanted to try something different. This DVD was easy to follow, I think her cues are very well done. Long-time yoga fans will likely find this unchallenging, but for me it was fine. Its a good stretch in particular, great for use after a long day of sitting.",1355875200,,329,4.238095238095238

3448023,5,B001AGZJ0E,"As always Ellens workouts are the best. Challenging without adding bulk. I feel all of her workouts tone the midsection the best.

Quick delivery too!",1353456000,,150,5.0
3448024,4,B001AGZJ0E,"This is a great workout DVD for my in between days of power vinyasa hot yoga.  It is very challenging for a beginner or intermediate exerciser.  When really pushing into the poses you can make it harder.  It went fast and I felt great after.  I was surprised how much my heart rate was elevated by the end.  Definitely great for stretching out while working out.  I also like that it doesn't start out crazy, it definitely works up to a challenge, but doesn't kill you in the first fifteen minutes.",1348012800,,498,4.417582417582418
3448025,5,B001AGZJ0E,"We love Ellen Barrett.  Her cuing is great.  Her attitude is just right, not too perky, not too bossy or serious.  The moves, as we've often found to be the case with Ellen, are more taxing than you'd think.  We usually come out of the workout feeling good and that maybe we didn't quite work out hard enough. Later, we realize our muscles are definitely fatigued. As you would expect, this DVD is heavier on yoga-style moves, but they are definitely workable for a yoga novice.",1347062400,,478,4.523255813953488
3448026,5,B001AGZJ0E,"I am already a huge Ellen Barrett fan and this video was no disappointment. I felt like I had a great, whole body workout but not overly fatigued. She truly knows how to do fitness and this video is by far her best. Also, just got skinny sculpt and like that but this one takes the cake of ALL her DVD's IMHO.",1345593600,,309,4.0
3448027,5,B001AGZJ0E,"I LOVE this workout!!!  Although a yoga/pilates based work-out, I do not go through it without sweating like I have been running for miles!  The faster pace also gives you, what Ellen calls, a 'cardio buzz' which I absolutely love.  Definitely a total body workout!

I am an advanced beginner/intermediate exerciser, and this workout is a bit challenging for me.  I have little upper body strength which makes all of the plank-based positions (most of the matwork) my weakness.  Ellen is soothing but not annoying in her encouragement, and her cues are right on point.  I HIGHLY recommend this workout!",1340323200,,602,4.96
3448028,5,B001AGZJ0E,"I do some yoga and have worked for a long time with weights and cardio routines, so I know a lot about exercising at home with videos.  This is one of the very best exercise videos I have ever owned, and I really enjoy doing it:  the moves feel good, but they really push you, especially if you are body-conscious (making the whole body participate, instead of just 'going through the motions'). Honestly you just cannot go wrong with this video.  There are modifications for the less-able exerciser (but I tend to go the other way, doing leg-raises with no fingers on the mat, for example), but most people will find that the challenge Ellen provides is just about right, especially as they continually return to the workout.  She is a LOVELY leader and a charming presence, and I have no criticisms.  Wonderful!",1330732800,3,813,4.6573426573426575
3448029,5,B001AGZJ0E,"I have just started working out to this and I am finding it amazing and very graceful and fluid whilst kicking your butt.  Yoga normally really bores me and I have a hard time continuing but this takes it to a new level where I am not counting the minutes until it is over.  I have Ellens Fusion Fat burning and I can testify that these are not for the faint of heart.  I have worked out most of my life and am in great shape so its really saying something when I say that these workouts have me in a puddle of sweat.  The music is just great and soothing which helps you concentrate on the moves and makes you feel centered.  I feel really calm and at peace when I do these workouts and to me that is worthwhile to have such good feelings.  I highly recommend this.  I thought I would comment again on this after using it for a while and I have to say that since using this and Fat Burning Fusion I am seeing phenomonal toning in my upper thighs, saddle bags, buttocks and area under buttocks.  I have always been fit but these areas were hard for me to perfect and I cannot believe how well I am doing and also sleeoing better!",1329868800,3,1129,4.1

I recently had a baby and have not exercised regularly, but decided it was time to get back into it. I wanted something different and trust her workouts. This is by far the most difficult! Its a lot of pilates and yoga moves and doesn't seem that fast paced but my legs were on fire and heart pounding after. This is exactly what I needed to get back in shape.",1328918400,,469,4.108695652173913

The first time I tried this I almost could not get through it and was sore for days afterwards! Although the workout is fairly relaxed, don't be fooled - it is a serious workout and you'll use muscles you didn't even know you had!",1305849600,,384,4.12
3448034,5,B001AGZJ0E,"So I figured I could do this dvd as a nice follow-up to a 23min kickboxing video... nope. I had to stop, take a day off and then try again. Though I love Ellen Barrett, I love her Fat Burning Fusion as well as her Burn and Firm Pilates and look forward to owning other video's made by her, I wasn't sure I was going to love Yogini the first time through. I now realize it is because it isn't a subtle workout like her other's. In Yogini I am working out and I know it. This video showed me my weak points and now I am going to embrace this video to work the weakness out... ~Grin~

I have come to appreciate what Ellen accomplished in this video. Ellen stretches you and works you at the same time, I really felt the area she was working. So many other videos I hear... ""do you feel that burn in your legs"" and often I do not, not the case with this video. Yes, there is quite a bit of planks and downward dogs toward the end of the video so people with weak arms think about modifying and those with weak wrists may want to reconsider. However, everyone else... I loved it, I recommend it.",1297641600,5,1090,4.069767441860465
3448035,5,B001AGZJ0E,"Yogini looks like a gentle workout to start - something to do on ""off"" days.  The illusion lasts until you're about seven minutes in, when you realize you're doing some fairly intense resistance training.

Like other studio videos, it's performed barefoot with a mat - no weights or props.  A few elements are borrowed from yoga, more seem to be borrowed from Pilates.  The standing work consists of lunge sequences, modified sun salutations, some chair pose chair pose variations, and plank work.  The seated mat work is stretching and a boat pose sequence.  The music is so low-key as to be almost nonexistent.  As usual, Ellen cues well, keeps the pacing even, and has a soothing and upbeat voice.  I really like the ballroom where she produced the first three Studio videos - it doesn't seem claustrophobic like a lot of sets.

The first time I did the workout I felt very relaxed and cheerful afterward, once I'd caught my breath.  The nice stretched feeling didn't prepare me for for the ""ow, didn't realize there was a muscle there"" feeling that developed over the next two days. My entire core, all the way around my body, had worked really hard.  It got easier with repetition, but it remains a real workout and not just a way to loosen up.",1295913600,4,1249,4.657534246575342
3448036,4,B001AGZJ0E,"Despite the name of the DVD, this is a very challenging workout that incorporates some yoga moves but kicks it up several notches. You will definitely get your heartbeat up there and plan on taking a shower afterward. With that said, you will really feel like you had a terrific workout when you are done and yes, you will give yourself a hand!",1280016000,3,344,4.476190476190476
3448037,5,B001AGZJ0E,"This has definitely turned into one of my favorite fitness DVDs in my collection. I most always work out at home and aim to complete at least 30 minutes of yoga/pilates-type workout, combined with a true cardio/strength workout. This DVD is great for the daily yoga/pilates stretching & toning mix. The description boasts that it will provide a cardio workout as well, but as a consistent intermediate exerciser, I wouldn't really agree.

The DVD is 45 minutes long and while you will work up a bit of a sweat, it is a bit too slow-paced to truly get you breathing hard. But - it is absolutely perfect for delivering the ""long & lean"" toning that Ellen Barrett is known for. Your thighs get a great work-out with a lot of standing work, especially your inner thighs with a lot of what she calls ""breathing plies"".

As always, Ellen Barrett is a great, non-annoying instructor who cues perfectly without an excess of praise or unnecessary motivational speeches, which tend to appear too often on fitness DVDs.

I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to incorporate yoga/stretching into their routine, but wants something faster-paced & results-driven than the standard Hatha/Ivengar practices on the market.",1273276800,7,1215,4.946078431372549
3448038,2,B001AGZJ0E,"As a general rule, I love Ellen's workouts - I have heaps of her DVDs and do them regularly. I was a little concerned about this workout being yoga-based, but since the product description said a ""teeny bit of yoga"" I figured it would be okay. I did the first 15 minutes of the program and had to stop (and then watched the rest) - there were definitely too many yoga-type exercises in it for me to handle. I am relatively fit, fairly flexible, and have experience with Ellen's pilates, fusion and weights workouts. However, yoga-style programs don't agree with me because for some reason I can't sort my breathing out properly, and I simply don't breathe often enough. This makes me quite sick and I can take a couple of hours to recover from it, so I now avoid yoga programs. This problem with breathing happened to me with this video, since I would often hold my breath while doing a pose. Even though Ellen would say to keep breathing, I find that I need regular instruction on when to inhale and when to exhale, otherwise I get too distracted with trying to hold the correct pose and forget to breathe.

The start of this video reminded me a lot of Crunch - Super SlimDown: Pilates Yoga Blend, which moves faster than this one, but Ellen instructs breathing much better. The Crunch video also is fantastic for stretching out the body and combines many other yoga-inspired moves that are present in this video too, but to me just works better and has more of a cardio element to it. This is the first video by Ellen that I don't like, and I am unlikely to try again. I will stick with her other videos though since they are great.",1269129600,8,1634,4.446666666666666
3448039,3,B001AGZJ0E,"I own all of Ellen Barretts DVDs and have been working out with them for a few years now - so I was excited to hear she had a few new releases. Her ""Yogini"" workout did make me work up a sweat, and I like that there's no high impact jumping to annoy my downstairs neighbors, but I found this workout quite difficult towards the end, when there are a lot of moves from the ""Plank"" position, which is really hard for me to do - especially stretching out from the plank to a one-handed side stretch!

I don't do yoga and am only familiar with some basic moves, but somehow, this workout didn't really do it for me. Having said that: It's a good stretching out of the back, so if you have tension there: go for it!",1265846400,14,710,4.107913669064748
3448040,4,B001AGZJ0E,"I'm a personal trainer, avid cyclist and teach a boot camp class twice a week.  I  am a real fan of The Studio workouts for rest days or days you are just not feeling all that.  The stretching feels amazing on tight muscles and really compliments tougher workout days.  And this DVD really works your core.  It won't torch loads of calories but it will help create that longer leaner physique we are all after. Ellen Barrett's style is upbeat and encouraging without being cheesy and her workout partners actually look like real women!  Another good one from The Studio.",1265500800,12,570,4.65
3448041,5,B001AGZJ0E,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this workout! I wasn't expecting to like it so much, but once I got all the way through it, I was amazed at how great I felt DURING the workout, not just afterward. There is so much stretching and strength and flexibility built into this perfectly flowing workout that you move through it with fluidity and grace. This is perfect ""power-yoga"", in that it incorporates basic yoga principles but moves more quickly and fluidly. LOVE it. I actually look forward to this workout. I like Ellen Barrett generally, but this one is her best.",1260403200,5,550,4.622448979591836
3448042,5,B001AGZJ0E,"I love yoga and do kundalini yoga (which is fairly vigorous) several times a week, so I was a teeny bit skeptical about whether or not I'd feel worked out after a ""yoga-type"" workout. But I also really love Ellen B's workouts, so I should've known better than to doubt... this was a really fun workout that really did make me feel not just worked out, but also relaxed, stretched out and - no kidding- happy! Time flew by and the video was over before I knew it- not that it was easy, since I was pretty sweaty and sore, esp in my core. If you enjoy Ellen's other videos, then this is a must-buy. Like other reviewers have said, it's also the perfect workout for a rough day or when you've been doing a lot of other types of athletics and need a good stretch. It's also a nice introduction to the benefits of yoga for people who might be a bit wary of yoga- you get the stretchy part without the spiritual stuff that seems to put many people off.

All in all a fun video I'm looking forward to doing again.",1259884800,17,1006,4.185567010309279
3448043,5,B001AGZJ0E,"I am going to preface by say that I love Ellen Barrett's workout DVDs. She's friendly and inspiring w/out being cheesy, and has a clam gentle voice that doesn't get irritating. I have a few of her Crunch dvds and one she did with Self magazine.

The Yogini workout is great because it fuses yoga poses w/ gentle cardio and leaves you feeling relaxed and refreshed but also sweaty, so you know you just got a good workout. I had backed off from traditional yoga classes and videos b/c I don't have the arm strength right now to do a zillion sun salutations, so this video allowed me to get a pinch of the parts of yoga I enjoy.

I can't wait for the new Studio workouts Ellen has coming out over the Holidays!!",1251676800,6,709,4.2835820895522385
3448044,5,B001AGZJ0E,"I absolutely LOVE this DVD!  Ellen Barrett is my all time favorite instructor.  She is great at cueing, not annoying or over excited, and knows how to make you get a good workout. I also own Fat Burning Fusion and Burn and Firm Pilates, and I think this is a great addition to those collections.  I will be enjoying this workout for a long time!",1250208000,4,345,4.276923076923077
3448045,1,B001AGZJ0E,This video was slow and boring. There were a few challenging moves at the end but by the time i got to them i was bored and uninterested. I doubt i will ever play this dvd again it was a huge waste of money!,1248307200,3,207,3.727272727272727
3448046,5,B001AGZJ0E,"I have all of Ellen's DVD's so I had to order this one.  I didn't really think a yoga workout would be very hard--I was wrong!  Ellen keeps you moving and that HR up.  She also gets in a lot of strength moves.  This is a great all-around workout:  Strength, Cardio, Flexibility and the feel-good benefits of Yoga!",1246406400,3,313,4.327586206896552
3448047,5,B001AGZJ0E,"I have all three workouts in this series and adore them, though I admit, Yogini did have to grow on me. Ellen starts out easy and simple, but before you know it you're doing a lot of downward dogs into plank pushups over and over and sweating like crazy. While this is yoga-based, it still incorporates Ellen's signature moves of second position plies, side lunges and more, along with some fierce chair squats and other strength moves. No equipment required! I am alternating this with her other two Studio workouts and am loving the results! And maybe I'm in the minority, but I love the music. It's slightly eerie, reminding me of a dark, rainy October day.",1244505600,,660,4.64957264957265
3448048,5,B001AGZJ0E,"This is an excellent DVD!  Ellen Barrett is a great instructor - calming voice (not annoying or overly ""bubbly""), easy to follow and inspiring.  I have many of her DVDs.  In this DVD the movements flow and are easy to follow and you can tell you are getting both a cardio and sculpting workout!  Highly recommended!",1244160000,4,315,4.571428571428571
3448049,4,B001AGZJ0E,"Lots of classic Ellen moves in a barefoot workout that's still a challenge, but in a good (and manageable) way. A little yoga, a little pilates, some low impact cardio - it's all covered.
If you like EB workouts get this one. If you haven't tried her before, Yogini is a great place to start.",1241308800,3,292,4.327272727272727
3448050,5,B001AGZJ0E,"I do this video on my off days from running.  It has really helped w/ my form, flexibility and breathing.  The stretching is awesome after hard running or a week w/ particularly a lot of miles.  It really helps strengthen and shape the core and arms that get neglected from just running.  She is fabulous and her cues are right on.  This dvd is also great b/c it never pushes you to the point of exhaustion but there is definitely exertion.  This is a nice, relaxing change from my normal work out and Ellen's voice and smile are soothing!!  I also like the way she explains which muscles are being worked and how.",1236902400,3,614,4.380530973451328
3448051,5,B001AGZJ0E,"This workout is wonderful! It's challenging, without being overly tough, and leaves you feeling thouroughly worked out, but energized and relaxed. Ellen is amazing! There aren't enough days in the week to do all of her great workouts! This one especially works the lower body (the chair pose after all the downward dogs is awesome for your thighs), but also includes some upper body (mostly shoulders) and ab work. It's best in conjunction with her Slim Sculpt (a killer upper body workout) and her Fat Burning Fusion, but it's also great by itself on days when I need to be energized or release tension and stress.",1236124800,4,615,4.811320754716981
3448052,5,B001AGZJ0E,I received this DVD on Friday and sat down to watch it before I attempted to do the workout. I have three of Ellen's DVD's so I thought this one would be a little slow paced. But believe me when I tell you that watching it and doing it are two totally different things! I thought the Fusion workout made me sweat but this one is unbelieveable! This is her most challenging that I've tried so far.,1234828800,3,396,4.1558441558441555
3448053,5,B001AGZJ0E,"I did this workout on a Sunday after an entire week of working out fairly hard. I consider myself lower advanced level, and I was sore so I thought this would be an ""easy"" workout for a light day.  Um... no.  The workout started off very relaxing and flowing, which Ellen is known for.. I have several of her other dvds and love the graceful moves.  The workout intensifies as it goes on, and I couldn't believe how hard I was working.  Even though I was sore from my other workouts, I pushed through it and felt EXTREMELY satisfied by the end.  This is not your run of the mill workout, and it will add a powerful, graceful flair to your workout routine.  Do not miss out on this one!!",1231632000,9,686,4.2384615384615385

It does have yoga elements but like all of Ellen's workouts is a fusion of different disciplines.  I really like it because im a long time exerciser and find i have to keep myself challenged.  This is a great work out, although the beginning is mostly a lower body workout, you get a arm/shoulder workout too, It really hits every spot you can imagine.",1485907200,,508,4.111111111111111

8277397,5,B001AGZJ0E,"I just finished this workout tonight and thought it is high time I review it. I've been on an Ellen kick lately, I own many of her dvd's going back to the Crunch days. I find this workout to be the most strength challenging of them all. She does just enough reps of each vinyasa so that you're really getting into it before you move on. She does a nice stretch in between each vinyasa that effectively targets whatever muscle or joint that has just been worked. Every time I do this dvd I am sweating and trembling by the end and my whole body feels nicely worked. I've been working out for years, I do many different types of exercise but this one is always a nice challenge. As with all Ellen dvd's, you get what you put into them.",1440115200,,733,4.205673758865248
8277398,4,B001AGZJ0E,"This does for the legs what Skinny Sculpt does for the arms - steady but gentle and non-threatening, and the legs do get a little fatigued.  I can see why people love Ellen's workouts because they don't really feel like workouts, but they do get you moving if you really detest exercise, and any movement is better than none.  This one is one of her better ones, I would say.",1438128000,,375,4.3428571428571425
8277399,2,B001AGZJ0E,I love yoga and was looking for something to switch up my routine. This workout is far more Pilates based than yoga and was very similar overall to Fat Burning Fusion. I can't imagine I will be doing this workout for long as it is not challenging and even gets a bit boring. If you are looking for a moderate to advanced shaping yoga workout I recommend Elise Gulan Yoga Fitness Plus.,1432771200,,384,4.347222222222222
