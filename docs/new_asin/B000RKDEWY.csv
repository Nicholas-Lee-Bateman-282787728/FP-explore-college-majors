As a big boxing fan, Schusterman Levine IS the WORST amateur fighter I've ever seen.  A laugh riot.

Dogs In Quicksand deals with the norms of love and hate in relationships and does it so incredibly bad that it comes across as refreshing to see people act this way!!!!

A great double bill if you want to laugh your head off knowing full well that the creators of these two movies, want you too!!!!!!!!!!",1313107200,,532,4.557894736842106
