It's great for children, by watching this I learned about the history of the ottoman empire, Istambul, Constantinople and more. It focases on the ottoman's from the 1420's to the 1450's. It also attracts children with it's action sceans, it's not bloody or goory or anything, it has a great score, agreat plot, cool action sceans and edjucational facts that keep me coming back for more. Check out this video it ROCKS!",987120000,5,508,4.9186046511627906
