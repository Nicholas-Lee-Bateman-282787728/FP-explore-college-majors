4897230,2,B005VAB788,".....at least a Couple of Feet...when I watch a Gay Romance movie.

Sorry to say...this film got me barely an Inch.  Even after a couple of watchings.  And here are just a few reasons WHY (I exclude any comment on the storyline, which Bobby Lind has already done his stellar job of providing):

- None of the (shared) 4-Leads struck me as being anything other than average actors (tho Blair Dickens, as Forrest, would get my vote for ""Stand-Out"" in this particular group---and not just because of his above average tallness).

- Lead characters' LIKABLENESS was pretty much Nil for me:  dour acting...close-mouthed...whiny...taciturn-looking are just a few of the negative personal traits given these characters by writers and actors (tho, again, Dicken's role was written as more upbeat, more understanding).

- Storyline is stale....having been done 100s of times in heterosexual wedding movies, throughtout the history of film.

- Ah, yes...lest I forget The Girls.  Since most Gay Romances must give us the B(Girl)FF / Advisor, I'd have to grant that Melissa McCurley, as Samantha, does an OK job.  She only butts in, obtrusively, a couple of times (wait...maybe that's supposed to happen---Ugh).  The other 3 females on board help stretch out the action...but are not there for much more than that.

- The last minute of the film is a Whirlwind...and I will cede to Mr. Lind's take on that.

A Second STAR was added only due to decent cinematograpy and the acting of Blair / McCurley

I will NOT be keeping this film in my Gay DVD Library.",1328918400,4,1544,4.888461538461539
4897231,5,B005VAB788,"Hold Your Peace surprised me. I expected to like it, of course. Otherwise, I wouldn't have bought it. But I didn't expect to love it, and think that it is one of the best movies I've seen in the last year. It's the combination of laugh-out-loud comedy, delicious drama, and sweet romance that make this a movie that should put a smile on your face for the whole film. Highly recommended!",1328140800,4,387,4.464788732394366
4897232,5,B005VAB788,"Far too many LGBT-themed romantic comedies retread the same old themes and tired old jokes. That's not the case here. The cast turns in appealing performances, particularly Chad Ford and Scott Higgins. Production values are high for an independent film, and the director keeps the story moving briskly.",1327104000,5,302,5.3125
4897233,4,B005VAB788,"Aiden (Chad Ford) is surprised to be invited to the commitment ceremony of his ex, Max ... and even more surprised when he is asked to step in as best man.  The problem is that Aiden is still very much in love with Max, although he doesn't want to interfere in his ex's chance for happiness with Forest, his very nurturing but somewhat controlling beau.  Aiden turns to his best female friend/roommate, Janice,  for advice, and she agrees he should be there, and suggests that he take along their mutual friend Lance, a twinkish party boy more than a decade younger than Aiden, to pose as his new boyfriend.  The introductions don't go quite as expected, with Max careful to demonstrate he is very much in love with Forest, while Lance only has eyes for Forest.  Janice develops a plan to force Max and Aiden to face their feelings for each other.

This is a cute, though somewhat simplistic story, which is handled capably by the actors within the tiny indy budget available.  The film provides a positive depiction of gay and lesbian relationships, with a minimum of stereotyping.  The ending is a bit abrupt and largely unrealistic, which is the only real problem I have with the film.  Worth a look, and I'll give it four stars out of five.",1325980800,7,1244,4.592760180995475

8487362,2,B005VAB788,"This movie almost didn't make it to the okay status. This is a hackneyed and clich ridden movie. Boy is an ice maiden and can never commit so his boyfriend leaves him for an older man who can commit and then wants to marry him and lo and behold first man is jealous especially when the soon to be married ex calls on him the be his best man, why? Who knows! There will be no academy awards given to this thing at all and especially for the acting which by all concerned was well below par. The absolute worst was Chad Ford and the icy one called Aidan. This is nothing we have not seen a million times whether it is a male/female couple or a male/male couple. It still washes out the same way, not funny, not poignant not much of anything at all. Pass this one by as you will not even chuckle once.",1495411200,,798,4.089171974522293

8487364,3,B005VAB788,It was a so so predicable comedy.  The leads weren't that believable in their roles.  And weren't that attractive.,1465171200,,114,4.947368421052632
8487365,5,B005VAB788,I liked this alot. Don't understand some of the reviews and nay sayers. Hey it's Breaking Glass Pictures not Martin Scorsese. I'm happy someone is at least attempting to make funny gay movies.,1428969600,,192,4.848484848484849

8487368,3,B005VAB788,"This great little movie is about types of gay men and the struggle to make things work. I laughed and growled during this movie. The men are good looking, the dialogue is urbane and witty and the struggle to find and keep love is pretty much right on. I was startled by the ending. It is incredibly abrupt. Maybe they couldn't think of a better way to end it. You'll get that quizzical look on your face and then you'll laugh I think:) It's an enjoyable movie.",1373846400,2,460,4.2988505747126435
8487369,1,B005VAB788,"OMG....this movie was so BORING!  I watch just about every gay film that comes out, especially the romantic comedies, but this one was neither romantic nor very comedic.  Honestly, after about 40 minutes I just couldn't take it anymore and had to shut it off.  The acting was forced and very mediocre, and sorry to say it, but the lead male actors weren't very attractive.  Let's admit it, we can sit through just about anything if the guys are cute, but bad acting AND homely actors?!  Don't waste your time or money on this film.",1338508800,2,531,4.5473684210526315
8487370,2,B005VAB788,"This film would have got one as 1 + 1 is 2! The plot is predictable, but even then, the end of this boring story is hard to digest. So perfectly sweet I felt nauseous.
Besides, a little bit of originality wouldn't do harm to anybody, especially to viewers. It's yet another copy of ""My best friend's wedding"", but this time with gay couple in the picture.
Acting, as usual in such enterprises, is not the strongest part. I really don't know if there is one role played well from a to z...",1332460800,3,488,4.258064516129032
