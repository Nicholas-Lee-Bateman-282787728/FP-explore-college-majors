4008168,2,B002WNUVJ8,"The MANEATER franchise hits rocl bottom with this laughably bad film.  Actor Rick Schroder directs with little imagination and the effects lame.  The cast including a quasi-cameo from Ben Cross is ineffective to be kind.  Also for supposedly immortal pups, the titular characters die pretty easily.  The hellhounds are also seen sparingly.
While previous MANEATERS aren't classics, they were entertaining...sadly, HELLHOUNDS isn't.",1295222400,4,431,5.903225806451613
4008169,2,B002WNUVJ8,"If you look at the cover of Hellhounds, you will see three - count 'em, THREE - devil dogs. And understandably, if one were to watch a film about monstrous dogs, one might consider a pack of dogs to at least consist of three if not more of them. When it comes to Hellhounds, one would be wrong.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. You may be familiar with the tale of Persephone of Hades, wherein an innocent demigoddess is abducted by Hades to become his queen. Demeter, Persephone's mother and personification of Mother Nature, was outraged enough to plunge the world into eternal winter. Hermes was sent to the underworld to retrieve her, but Hades tricked Persephone into eating pomegranate seeds which bound her forever to the underworld. Zeus split the difference so that Persephone shuttles between the two realms, which is why we have the changing seasons when Demeter mourns for her missing daughter (winter) and rejoices upon her return (summer).  You can find all of this out by perusing Wikipedia.

Director Rick Schroder - yes, THAT Ricky Schroder -- does not read Wikipedia.

Instead, we have Kleitos (wooden Scott Elrod) what has just married princess Demetria (only slightly less wooden Amanda Brooks).  When she rejects the advances of Kleitos' best friend Theron (James A. Woods, the only good actor in the bunch), Demetria is mysteriously assassinated.  Convinced that he can save Demetria from death itself, Kleitos marches off to Tartarus to retrieve his maiden fair, all the while unaware that there's a traitor in his midst.

Beyond the similarities between the names Demeter/Demetria, this tale has nothing much in common with Greek myth.  Or any myth for that matter, unless those myths involve walking down poorly lit hallways, wandering around in the forests, and swinging torches in fog.

Hellhounds wants to be so much more, and it gets props for a unique setting for a monster movie.  But if the script has ambition, it lacks just about every other successful ingredient. The rivalry between hero and villain plays out like a schoolyard brawl. The adventuring party spends way too much time wandering around in confusion and arguing about which way to go without ever speaking in contractions (because that's how the Greeks spoke, right?).  This film could easily be shortened by twenty minutes.

The actors try hard to convince us there's a whole pack of hellhounds off screen, referencing an ""alpha male"" which has glowing red eyes, but when it finally does show up they couldn't even afford the red eyes. Apparently Rick didn't have enough money to render a whole pack of hellhounds.  So we get exactly two - not even the three promised on the cover. The real Greek tragedy is a distinct lack of the namesake monsters.",1282435200,12,2749,4.911447084233261
4008170,5,B002WNUVJ8,"I don't know where one gets that Lou Diamond Phillips is in this, because he isn't.  However the storyline is set as it is in the old myths...The bride is poisoned on her wedding day by the main character's rival and he goes into Haedes to bring her soul back.  They fight ***yes Hellhounds*** and such along the way, and it does have a lot of action in it.  Yes, there are gory scenes so it's not for the kiddies...If you remember the song ""Don't Pay the Ferryman"" from the '80's you will have a good idea what myth that this film originates from.  The acting was well done in it, and I enjoyed seeing Ben Cross in this one.  He played the part of the king well.  I guess the other reviewer didn't get into it because he didn't get the plot.  Those of you who are into the Greek Mythology and such will like it, I think...Rick Schroder did an excellent job directing these actors too.  There was no overacting.  The make up and costumes were good as well.",1273363200,13,956,4.237569060773481
4008171,2,B002WNUVJ8,"Sword-and-sandals meet horror in ""Hellhounds.""  After his young bride is poisoned on their wedding day, a brave warrior and his loyal comrades descend into the underworld to retrieve her soul.  Challenged at every turn by one horror after another, they return from their chilling journey to find they are not alone; they've been tracked by a pack of snarling, savage beasts that kill everything in their path.  Lou Diamond Phillips stars.

The only interesting thing about this low-budget flick is the combination of ancient times with modern, grisly special effects.  The movie is not for those easily turned off by the sight of blood -- a lot of it.  There are no bonus extras.",1271980800,4,679,4.912280701754386
8383347,3,B002WNUVJ8,"Another fairly early outing from the 'Maneater Series', Hellhounds is typical of what this line of films is all about - cheaply produced made for TV movies with a science fiction/horror theme. While most of the series have been set in approximately the present day, this time the setting is some ancient time when men fought with swords and there were villages with peasants and kings who ruled over small domains. You get the picture.

The problem with this difference is that the lack of production values becomes even more pronounced as there is very little money to spend on costuming or sets. And this is fairly obvious in Hellhounds - even the cast is miniscule in number.

Having said this, the story is very ambitious and has a lot of good ideas, with a princess being poisoned on her wedding day and her husband and a group of his followers chasing off to the underworld to bring her soul back. There is actually quite  lot going on but oddly, even though the film has a decent run time of just under 90 minutes, the thing feels constantly rushed. Quite often a scene is set and then the story moves along, brushing the idea aside in its rush to get to the next scene. It's a bit exhausting trying to keep up.

As is common with these productions, the directing is just adequate and the acting is generally wooden or worse. Again, it seems the whole thing is just rushed to get it to the TV screen.

Hellhounds isn't the worst of the Maneater Series but it's also nothing special.",1476057600,,1489,4.5

8383351,1,B002WNUVJ8,"This movie was horrible. The acting in this moving was almost as bad as the acting in Amityville Theater...I had to force myself to finish this movie just to say I finished it. The mail character's acting was the worst..you could tell he was speaking and acting from memory and not attempting to actually ""act"". The dude who plays ""Hades""...omg..worst acting ever along with the main characters ""best friend"" who betrayed him. The ""princess"" was alright...but I am telling you...the acting for this movie is HORRID at best.
The plot was pretty idiotic as well; most of this movie had nothing to do with ""hell hounds"".
I would rather listen to nails on a chalkboard than have to watch this movie again. I have a dvd rental business and I tossed this in the trash after buying and watching it. Chalk it up to a bad investment!
Please save your money....this is a horrible movie",1454371200,,875,4.651612903225806

8383355,5,B002WNUVJ8,"I thought this was really interesting. There are a lot of cool visuals. The hellhounds themselves aren't the most realistic-looking animals but the effects are decent. The other effects in the movie, including the blood and gore, are quite impressive. The plot was engaging and suspenseful. Definitely one of my favorites in the maneater series.",1367884800,,345,5.290909090909091
8383356,5,B002WNUVJ8,really enjoyed this movie thought it was going to be stupid but really surprised me. then again I just Love The Maneater Series Really Enjoy These Films. Thank You For The Prompt Service Sincerly Mr. Stone.,1362873600,2,206,4.75
