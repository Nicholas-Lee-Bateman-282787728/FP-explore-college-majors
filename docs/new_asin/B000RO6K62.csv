2872725,5,B000RO6K62,"como pueden saber yo compre esta pelicula por que me encanta jaime camill, es muy gracioso y la trama estaba muy buena me rei de lo lindo con esta pelicula es recomendable.",1366934400,,172,4.40625
2872726,5,B000RO6K62,"Terribly funny! Awesome comic movie! You'd better speak Miami Spanish to get all of it, but an awesome, hilarious movie!",1357084800,,120,5.05
2872727,2,B000RO6K62,This could have been a much better film had the writing not been so lame. The idea of a shipwrecked Castro living in Miami could provide endles opportunities for storylines but the writers blew it here. This film was probably under-budgeted hence the b grade quality of the film.,1339459200,,279,4.714285714285714
2872728,4,B000RO6K62,"The movie captures Fidel's culinary skills as well as his love for the game of baseball. Stranded in Miami, Castro pretends to be someone else. He befriends a young boy, who knows who he really is. His life among those who despise him, forces him to re-examine his life and the revolution. Brief nudity, language. Great movie if you want to learn Spanish swear words. The movie portrays Fidel as a flawed human being with lofty ideas and not as a monster with horns, which might turn off the Fidel haters.",1277510400,3,505,4.56043956043956
2872729,3,B000RO6K62,"The movie's premise is brilliant. A cantankerous, vicious, temperemental Fidel Castro is on a boat in Cuba, which gets blown up in an attempted coup. He survives on a raft, drifts with the current and wakes up in Florida. Naturally, he loses his beard and takes on another name and keeps trying to return to Cuba. The actor playing the dictator is excellent whenever the dictator, who is used to everyone being a bootlicker and jumping at his every whim, is contradicted or frustrated in his demands. If the movie had simply stayed with this story, it would have been perfect, but the problem is that a couple of parallel stories (a boy being bullied at school, infidelity between couples and an incoherent side story of arm smuggling) detract from the story. Even so, the movie is worth buying. It will give you a good laugh.",1275004800,,826,4.664383561643835
2872730,2,B000RO6K62,I got this movie solely because Jaime Camil was in it but the movie was too political with too much blah blah blah on Fidel Castro - soooo!  I didn't like this movie that much!  How can I return this crap?  LOL!  I do love Miami though!,1268092800,,236,3.9574468085106385
2872731,2,B000RO6K62,"It could have been a better story with another director or better script,Seems like the producers of this movie like Fidel Castro in some way,a lot of famous people in the casting for a poor production,Johnny from Menudo,Jaime Camil,Felipe from Escandalo TV, and ex Miss universe Cecilia Machado,mediocre direction and acting",1236902400,,325,5.392156862745098
2872732,2,B000RO6K62,"A great concept that could have made for great satire and comedy.  But, alas it did not happen.  However for director, it may be a good start to a successful artistic career.

I especially liked the crime scene after the fire. It was done in a most realistic manner.

Lastly, buy the movie (it's almost impossible to rent) and make up your own mind.",1203811200,2,349,4.40625
2872733,5,B000RO6K62,I really enjoyed this movie. Maybe it's because I love Jaime Camil.  He is a great actor.  I think one of the best Mexico has to offer.,1198886400,2,135,3.962962962962963
2872734,2,B000RO6K62,"While not a dreadful movie, it leaves a lot to be desired.  Ofelia Medina (as Doa Emelia) and Mexican child actor Adrian Alonso (as Tony) give the best performances.  Spanish actor Juan Luis Galiardo does a respectable job in a role that portrays both the dictatorial and human sides of the demonized Fidel Castro, but his lack of a Cuban accent is a major flaw.  The rest of the cast is lackluster.  The story line is herky jerky and confusing at times.  Overall the promising premise of this movie is undermined by a mediocre cast, script, and direction.",1188864000,,556,4.63265306122449
