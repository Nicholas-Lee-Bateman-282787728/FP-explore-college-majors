5528963,3,B00AZ88D4W,Sorry to say...not much info about Kateri's life - focuses too much about modern day people involved with her shrine.,1363392000,23,117,4.9
5528964,5,B00AZ88D4W,"Blends reinactments of her life and situation, with contemporary documentary of Native American, clerical, and other devotees. Of special note are revelations of the Jesuit journal kept during St. Kateri's lifetime, of her remarkable virtue and holiness.  Perhaps best of all, we meet the boy (and his family) whose miraculous cure, after much suffering, led to St. Kateri's canonization.

Bonus features include lengthy footage of the canonization,in which the growing weakness of His Holiness is in painful evidence.  Have the tissues ready.",1362182400,22,543,5.597560975609756
5528965,5,B00AZ88D4W,"Of necessity this DVD has to be more of a documentary than an acted film. She was a wonderful young Iroquois/Mohawk woman who listened to the Blackrobes (the French missionary priests) and fell in love with Jesus and spent the rest of her life living out the Gospel. She had to escape from her environment to be able to live as her heart yearned, and she came to a community of Native Americans who had been baptized like her and had left their environments and lived in a place which is now part of New York. She is the first native American to be canonized. Her life is inspiring.",1361404800,29,582,4.348623853211009

5528970,1,B00AZ88D4W,It s sad that this movie has no captions or subtitles.  Deaf people including myself would have loved to watch it.,1410912000,6,114,4.428571428571429
5528971,4,B00AZ88D4W,"I love Kateri Tekakwitha so much, I was able to get past some of the things which seemed irrelevant. Kateri was such a mystical and contemplative soul, I love imaginging myself walking her path. It's a documentary, not a motion picture.",1406332800,2,236,4.780487804878049
5528972,3,B00AZ88D4W,"Not what I expected.  Was hoping for a drama that would appeal to teens more.  Should have read information more closely, my fault.",1405382400,,131,4.6521739130434785
5528973,2,B00AZ88D4W,The documentary shows the miracles used for her canonisation more than the story of her life. Not what I was expecting.,1398643200,5,119,4.714285714285714

5528976,3,B00AZ88D4W,Thought this was a move but it is a documentary of her life.  Interesting but not what I was expecting.,1384300800,2,103,4.15
5528977,5,B00AZ88D4W,"This DVD is a documentary, not a movie.  It covers history as well as the current impact St. Kateri has had on peoples lives.  Very worthwhile.",1383177600,5,143,4.461538461538462

5528979,3,B00AZ88D4W,I really have a special devotion to St. Kateri and I was hoping this movie would be a great compliment to all the reading I have done. It is really difficult to give it a rating..... the problem I have with this movie is the drum and music in the background is so loud I can't hear what anyone is saying!! Maybe I need a hearing aid but this was really terrible! From the little I was able to hear it sounded great.,1377043200,7,415,4.0120481927710845
5528980,3,B00AZ88D4W,This documentary was alright.  There were a few miracles in it that made it interesting enough.  But its not something I would watch again.,1375920000,,139,4.75
5528981,5,B00AZ88D4W,certainly shred more light onto this person of love and Christian faith. She is an inspiration to any person who is separated from their family and/or friends from loving Christ even more.,1370649600,3,188,4.90625

5528985,5,B00AZ88D4W,This documentary was very interesting and enlightening about St. Kateri Taekakwitha's life and the miracle that brought forward her canonization.

8559480,1,B00AZ88D4W,"A horrible, pagan retelling of people who are suppose to have a devotion to a Catholic Saint.  Instead, they talk about sensing her ""magic"" around them.  Garbage, and not at all Catholic.  It is so saddening that so many people think it appropriate to interweave St. Kateri with the Native American superstitions that she left behind.  This movie was a waste of money, and an insult to our beloved Saint.",1524441600,,404,4.728571428571429
