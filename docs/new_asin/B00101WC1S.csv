Common Law Cabin - Not Russ Meyer's best. Kinda dull but fairly interesting (for the ladies in it)

Finders Keepers Lovers Weepers - The reason why I bought the box set. My favorite Russ Meyer movie and in my opinion his best (and I've seen them all, Faster Pussycat is WAY overrated!). This film is greatly underappreciated. It has all the elements of a great Russ Meyer movie: a great story, funny dialog, great directing from Meyer, and of course
loads of BIG BREASTS.

Good Morning and Goodbye - Your average Meyer movie without the nudity. Some great dialog here and beautiful women here but lacking in the bare breasts department. Worth a view or two

Ignore what the previous reviewer said, these DVD's are GREAT QUALITY. The sound and picture are as good as it's gonna get for a movies this rare and old. The only drawback, like the other reviewer mentioned, is NO TITLE MENUS. Kinda weird but who really cares, just use the stop and forward buttons if you need to.",1222819200,12,989,4.607954545454546
8236514,2,B00101WC1S,"This 4-disc set contains 3 of Russ Meyer's lesser films from the late 60s, ""Finders Keepers, Lovers Weepers"",""Good Morning and Goodbye"" and ""Common-Law Cabin"", as well as a ""promo reel"" 4th disc.

The transfers are poor, with a washed-out look that could easily have come from a VHS source, and there are no extras, nor even a DVD menu! You pop the disc in and the film immediately starts playing. If you do hit the Menu button, you get one of those generic DVD menu screens that comes with your authoring software, and only 1 menu item, which is to play the film.

The shoddy presentation and lack of care in these discs suggests bootlegs, but this is in fact an officially authorized release from Russ Meyer Films (check their website if you don't believe me!)

The 4th ""promo reel"" disc is merely a half-hour of clips from various Meyer films, spanning his career. Unfortunately they only include clips for films that are already available on DVD, so forget about seeing anything rare or obscure.

Each disc is held in individual trays within a single, oversized DVD case.

I wish Criterion or someone would do properly restored and loaded releases of Meyer's canon, but in the meantime we're stuck with this.",1219104000,12,1212,4.725118483412322
