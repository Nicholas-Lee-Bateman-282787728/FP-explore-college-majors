1665377,5,B00005UF9R,"Martin Sheen skillfully narrates this colorful and wonderfully-shot depiction of the inner workings of the Vatican. The film shows us the printing service, post office, art restoration lab and choirs of the world's smallest state. You will also learn about site's history, starting as Saint Peter's tomb and growing to a small ""trophy,"" and to two successively larger basilicas. The section on the search for Saint Peter's tomb is especially well done, with computer graphics used to explain the location of a 1st-century necropolis beneath the basilica's massive dome. The Swiss Guard is depicted through the eyes of the young men who swear to defend the Pope with their lives. It is also depicted via the tailor who must design each of their 100+ piece uniforms. You will meet Arturo Marti, the Vatican photographer, view some of his quietly-touching photographs and accompany him to a papal audience with visiting dignitaries. You will meet the Franciscan nun who has devoted decades of her life to hand-restoring some of the Vatican's priceless artworks. You will encounter the Sampietrini workers, who labor unsung to clean the floors and haul the massive draperies used during beatification and canonization ceremonies. And you will glimpse the Holy Father himself as he ordains another crop of bishops who follow in the footsteps of the Apostles to do Christ's work on earth.

""Inside the Vatican"" is a loving look at part of the Church's material edifice. The film does not sugarcoat the real-life historical excess of those who walked its marbled corridors. Crusades, Inquisitions and venality -- all parts of the human experience -- have colored the history of the place. Yet one would have to be a rabidly anti-Catholic polemicist (or just plain stone-hearted) not to admire the craft, effort, love and piety that also went into shaping these hallowed palaces.

""Inside the Vatican"" is a wonderful choice for Catholic Sunday school teachers who wish to impart a bit of the positive side of the institutional Church to their students.",1105315200,42,2044,5.135135135135135
1665378,5,B00005UF9R,Every teacher of the Catholic faith to young adults and adults should incorporate this DVD into their classes.  It is so unusual to see the Catholic faith presented without an agenda -- and this succeeds.  Everything is clearly explained and given a historical context.  I was impressed with the archival newsreel footage incorporated into the explanation of the papal elections.,1026777600,47,379,5.283333333333333
1665379,5,B00005UF9R,I found this dvd very entertaining and informative. It is a fascinating look into the operations of the most visited place in the world. The beauty and grandeur of the place especially the priceless paintings and artifacts have made the Vatican the most valuable wealth of historical information available. The dvd is great! National Geographic has done a great presentation of the Vatican and great to watch especially if you have never been there. This dvd is a great addition to any dvd collection.,1026172800,20,501,4.976190476190476
1665380,5,B00005UF9R,"This video is an excellent video to show students, young adults as well as adults who want to know more about their faith and how did the Vatican came to be.  I think it is also encourage anyone who is interested or curious about the Cathoilc faith to take a preview of the video.  The video decribes how an ordination happens at Saint Peters, what actually goes on during an ordination.  The video also decribed a Blessed and is story and how one day, he could become a Saint by the Pope.  Finally, once a Pope dies, a new Pope must be elected, the video will cover that as well.  The pictures of the Vatican are just awesome. I've been to Rome before, and these pictures just bring back memories.  Also, I forgot to mention, the Swiss Guards.  The video goes into how one becomes a guard for the Pope and there uniform.  You must buy it or at least rent it if you can.  The Pope is seen in several frames thoughout the video.",1020124800,14,927,4.251428571428572
1665381,5,B00005UF9R,"National Geographic has done an excellent job on this documentary for it contains the most impressive views of the Vatican and some of the activities that take place behind the scenes.  The documentary focuses not only on the present day but also on the two thousand year history of the Holy See and Christianity. The viewer will be taken on a privileged tour of some of the most exclusive places within the Vatican walls: St Peter basilica, the Sistine Chapel and the Vatican Museum. It describes some historical events, and the ancient traditions and rites, some of which date back to the time of the Renaissance, such as the Gregorian calendar, the Swiss Guard, the ordination of bishops, the ceremonial Beatification of the Blessed, and the selection of a new Pope. This documentary provides a good-natured view of the history of the Catholic Church in particular, and Christianity in general. Although it may be better appreciated by Catholics, it has an enormous historical value;  it links our western civilization with its evolution from the time of the Roman Empire. Narrated by Martin Sheen, the picture is magnificent and the Dolby sound is excellent.",1018310400,10,1162,5.015544041450777
1665382,5,B00005UF9R,I gave this to my daughter who is planning on going to Rome and the Vatican and I'm sure she loved it.,1395187200,,102,3.6818181818181817
1665383,3,B00005UF9R,"This is a nice, basic book on the Vatican, but with a name like ""Inside"" the Vatican, I was expecting something more educational and descriptive of the structure and workings of the Vatican.
It does touch on these areas, but it wanders and has some mild, general commentaries that are sort of bland to read.",1380931200,,307,4.6
1665384,3,B00005UF9R,"The Vatican's grandeur's is quite impressive, but would have better covered with more time exploring it and less on the mundane aspects of general and artifact maintenance. The Pope at that time looked to be in very poor physical and mental health - so much so that it made his office a caricature of what it should be. Wish they'd waited for a more healthy Pope to take office. Would also very much liked to have had more time spent on the areas under the Vatican - including dating of some of the bones and relics, especially in the area reputed to contain the bones of St. Peter. The tapestries were also incredible - more detail on their construction, estimates of how long it took to make them, etc.",1375315200,,704,4.465116279069767
1665385,5,B00005UF9R,Saw this myself in VHS and am buying it for my pastor who is being assigned another church.  Hope he enjoys it.,1369526400,,111,4.045454545454546
1665386,5,B00005UF9R,Teachers love it.  They use it to teach religion classes in school.  Very interesting and informing.  Certainly a good price.,1367107200,,125,5.15
1665387,4,B00005UF9R,"This was a good documentary. Having just been to St. Peter's and the Vatican, I thought it would be worth the time. It was. I actually wish it would have been a little longer. The focus was multi-faceted so you got a little information about a lot of the elements of the Vatican City.",1355875200,,284,4.277777777777778
1665388,4,B00005UF9R,"this is a good telling of the story of the vatican, but the footage is alittle old in places and I have seen more detailed accounts. But all in all good.",1353801600,,153,3.967741935483871
1665389,3,B00005UF9R,"Interesting even if you're not a Catholic, or even a Christian. The art treasures, the attention to detail in ritual and mundane work alike, and a pretty rare look inside a place that is off limits to most people most of the time.

The Swiss Guard are examined in detail through preparations for a swearing in ceremony. The whole process of beatification through the lives of five prospective saints, especially the first one from Puerto Rico, a study of the life of the pope. Did you know, for example, that the Sisters of the Poor (the ones founded by Mother Theresa of India) run a soup kitchen inside the Vatican? Or that the Pope has his own personal photographer, who apparently serves for the life of the pope at least, if not his own life. That there is a program underway to digitally record and restore old documents in the Vatican archives, including a letter written in Leonardo DaVinci's own hand? It seems that iron in the ink he used has eaten away the parchment or paper (don't remember which; think it was paper). There are three major art restoration laboratories: stone, tapestries, and paintings. As a needlework enthusiast myself, I stopped breathing as I watched a nun meticulously cut away a few threads on a tapestry which were a previous and not very skilled restoration.

These people think not in years or decades, but centuries.

We got to watch the Vatican Choir practice and then perform. Boys enter at the age of nine, and leave when they turn 13 ""or their voice breaks, whichever comes first."" Discreetly, no mention was made about the castrati of previous centuries.

But some negative things were included, especially an explanation of how the Holy Roman Empire became so terribly corrupt, with popes who made land grants to their bastard sons. The one that commissioned a particularly fine basilica pawned the priceless tapestries to pay the builders. The trial of Galileo is mentioned, and the Inquisition -- very briefly.

2001 was in the reign of John Paul II, the Polish pope. He looked so bent and feeble in these pictures that after the film was over I looked him up in Wikipedia. He lived until 2005, so I guess he wasn't quite as bad off as he seemed.

It's interesting history and culture, and Catholics will probably find it priceless.",1336867200,,2280,4.744949494949495
1665390,3,B00005UF9R,"DVD, not Blue Ray.  Fair introduction to the Vatican but lacks pictures of major places one would expect to learn about.  Minimal historical review.  Not bad but not what I was looking for.",1316131200,,189,4.666666666666667
1665391,5,B00005UF9R,"This was a nice film. It was reverent and respectful without being overtly religious. It's not ultra fact-heavy, rather giving you a little taste of life in the Vatican.",1292630400,,169,4.862068965517241
1665392,5,B00005UF9R,"I was actually Surprised at the Objective view presented,It is common to bash Catholics and found that this Documentary Inside the Vatican was not about that, Vatican City is a Beautiful and Mysterious place and this goes behind the scenes and looks at some of the people who help run the Vatican.",1287360000,3,297,4.730769230769231
1665393,5,B00005UF9R,"I loved this movie! And for anyone who is interested in learning more about the Vatican I would strongly recommend it.  It gives the viewer a good overview of life in the Vatican, some history, and what is going on presently.  National Geographic did a great job.",1240099200,,263,4.574468085106383
1665394,5,B00005UF9R,"""Inside the Vatican"" is a must-see for anyone aspiring to travel to the Vatican.  It gives the audience unique behind-the-scenes access as to how the Vatican operates on a daily basis, & why certain protocol is followed as it is there.  It was an educational experience for my whole family--& a joy, especially, to share with my two young daughters.  I teach Faith Formation at our parish & I plan on incorporating ""Inside the Vatican"" into my curriculum from now on.",1215907200,,467,4.7407407407407405
1665395,4,B00005UF9R,This documentary is typical of the high quality type of documentary we've come to expect from NatGeo.  Inside The Vatican provides a rare and fascinating look into this church/state and the enormous amount of anonymous work that goes into making it function.  This is the most inside look at the Vatican that I've ever seen.,1210291200,3,324,4.872727272727273
1665396,5,B00005UF9R,"Anyone who's ever wondered what life is like at the Vatican need look no further than this very well produced dvd.  Told in a very organised manner looking at typical major events in the lives of a number of people, the director uses these to inform and educate the audience just what goes on at as well as the history of the capitol of the Catholic Church.  Even the blemishes are not covered up as there is a very frank discussion about the sale of indulgences which was a major factor behind the Reformation movement, about bad popes, about the wrongful treatment of Galileo etc.  Narrator Martin Sheen does a great job as well as he describes what goes on in the build up to a Beautification, an appointment of an archbishop, an appointment of a Swiss Guard, the life of the official photographer, the council which decides on sainthood etc.

In addition to very good content I was very impressed with the picture quality which is first class as well as the sound quality which comes in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound which is very rare for documentaries.  This definitely enhanced my enjoyment of this dvd.  This would be great viewing for RCIA's, cell groups, and other Christian study groups as a great way to find out what a ""typical"" day at the Vatican is about.

One of the best documentaries that I've ever seen and I highly recommend it!",1203811200,,1351,4.580912863070539
1665397,5,B00005UF9R,Good graphics. Loved the tape. I have seen the outside of the vatican and this was a way for me to see the inside of it.,1179100800,2,120,3.6538461538461537
1665398,5,B00005UF9R,"This is an in-depth vision to all people who wants but can't get inside the walls of one of the most emblematic buildings and ""treasure container"" of our history.  This is a great tv series collection.

1665399,2,B00005UF9R,"I was disappointed in this video.  I came to it not as a devout Catholic but as a fan of travel videos.  In other words, I watched this video with the same motivation I would have to watch Shackleton's Antarctic exploration, or something from the Globe Trekker series.

With that in mind, the target audience for this video is not me.  It is the religious Catholic.  Therefore, from my perspective, I can't recommend it.  I'm not one for all the pomp and circumstance of religion.  I don't enjoy worshipping the ""Holy Father"", or watching the construction of the clownish uniform of the Swiss Guard.

If you are a devout Catholic you will probably enjoy this video.  If you are not, and just came to the video because you wanted a Globe Trekker style tour of the Vatican, you are likely to be disappointed.

And that is what these reviews are for - to let you know whether you will enjoy the video or not.",1153872000,22,905,4.463414634146342
1665400,5,B00005UF9R,"In 2 weeks, I will actually be at the Vatican for my first visit. This wonderful DVD showed me places and things that I will never be able to see as a tourist, but just knowing about the workings of the Vatican will add such a richness of knowledge to visit.  This is a beautifully done 90 min DVD as only National Geographic could have done.  I was thrilled with every minute I spent watching it and will enjoy watching it many more time when I get home --- to remember my trip.",1127520000,13,479,4.139784946236559
