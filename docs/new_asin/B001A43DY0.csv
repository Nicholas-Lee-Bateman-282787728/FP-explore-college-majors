8326243,1,B001A43DY0,"I enjoy Mike Sexton's commentary while watching the World Poker Tour.  He is an expert communicator and you can't help but learn something about Hold'em while listening to Mike.

I really can't rate this video at all because i am unable to view it!  When I place the DVD into my Sony DVD player, there appears an onscreen message: ""Restricted Region"", ""Unable To Play"".

After doing some yahoo research i learned that DVD's have an embedded region code. For example, DVD's that are intended for distribution worldwide are Region Code 0, and so can be played on a DVD player sold in Taiwan or anywhere else in the world.

Distribution within the US & Canada is Region Code:1
People's Republic of China & Hong Kong are Region Code:6
You get the idea.

I don't think that this is a bootleg copy but simply a copy that was intended for distribution in some other region such as Eastern Europe. So it just don't play in the US.

Would have liked to played the DVD because Mike is both an excellent speaker and an expert on Texas Hold'em.
