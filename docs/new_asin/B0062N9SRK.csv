8491263,4,B0062N9SRK,"The picture is a bit dark at times, the beginning especially and yes the sound quality isn't top notch but when you think this is taken from a recording for television it's really pretty good. If you are a big GM fan I would recommend this. Worth the nearly 40 I paid for it. I have an old stereo system with a graphic equalizer that is hooked up to my dvd player so I got the sound quality to epic proportions.",1517788800,,411,4.08641975308642

8491265,5,B0062N9SRK,"I agree with other reviews that this dvd quality could have been better, but other than the fact that the picture is a little dark in the beginning-- it is still a great concert. It gets brighter around the second or third song! George Michael is so energetic here, and that velvety, smooth voice is mezmerizing. He was such a beautiful artist in all respects. The song list is as follows: killer/papa was a rolling stone, father figure, fame, ain't no stopping us now, calling you, back to life, tonight, everything she wants, baby don't change your mind, don't let the sun go down on me, ain't nobody, I knew you were waiting. Then he does 3 numbers with Andrew Ridgeley: careless whisper, I'm your man, and freedom 90. I love GM, so I am thrilled to have this in my collection. I love this concert! He was one of a kind and will be dearly missed. RIP...",1506297600,7,856,4.424050632911392

8491268,4,B0062N9SRK,Not a bad concert but the footage is dark at first but gets a little better as it goes.  Same for the sound quality.  Starts out bad but gets a little better.  Considering the footage is from Brazilian TV and was probably converted from low quality film to DVD hurts the quality but the concert itself is enjoyable and gets you moving.  It is in Dolby Digital though supposedly maybe that helps the sound some.  Update 8/30 I got a new DVD player that has HDMI and it does the video much justice.  The picture quality is much better and the colors are rich and deep.  The sound is much better in digital too.  What a difference a new player can make with a good TV.,1495497600,4,665,4.222222222222222
