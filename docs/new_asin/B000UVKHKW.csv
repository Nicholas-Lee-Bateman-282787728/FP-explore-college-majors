8215098,5,B000UVKHKW,"Where hardcore wrestling, blue humor, and a traveling Guatemalan freakshow collide, you will find JCW's Slam TV.  Wrestling purists, those without a warped sense of humor, or anyone waiting for WWE's upcoming We Just Suck And No Longer Care:  The Best of J.B.L, would be well advised to look elsewhere.  This mutant brainchild of Insane Clown Posse has to be seen to be believed.  Like the classic Stranglemanias 1 and 2, Jay and Shaggy (under their inexplicable noms de wrestling 3D and Guido) provide all your totally profane commentary needs, while the cream of Japan's hardcore scene (2 Tuff Tony, Nosawa, Mad Man Pondo), The U.S. independent scene (Zach ""pogo stick"" Gowan, ""Holy"" Trent Acid, and the Human Tornado), plus an assortment of random jabronis and derelicts do battle in front of those impetuous, faygo flinging ICP fanatics, the juggalos.  You will be amazed, baffled, and possibly spray beer from your nose during a laughing fit.",1208390400,5,947,5.044871794871795
