6901661,5,B00R7ECEP6,"The show starts off simple enough . Tough guy Harima loves Tenma who loves Karasuma who loves curry. The first few episodes revolve around this . Then the show takes off . I never thought there were so many ways to mess up just telling someone that you love them . It's hard to say too much about the show without spoiling it . There are lots of misinterpretations of comments and actions , like where Harima grows a huge beard because he thought Tenma likes whiskers . There are plenty of memorable characters and funny situations. If you like off the wall comedy , then you'll probably like this . School Rumble is so enjoyable that I'm going to order the second semester.",1272758400,,674,4.443548387096774
6901662,5,B00R7ECEP6,"""School Rumble"" is probably my favorite modern comic from Japan. Equal parts straight comedy, bizarre strangeness and hilarious romance hijinks, it manages to get the mix just right and have me cracking up in a way I haven't done since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Hina/dp/B001M6SHD8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Hina</a>.

The basic premise is nothing unique. Boy likes girl who likes different boy who likes other girl who likes different boy who likes an entirely different girl who is in love with the original boy who liked the original girl. I remember when I first picked up the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/comic-book/dp/1435271106/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">comic book</a>&nbsp;in Japan, the display had a giant flowchart detailing all the romantic entanglements.

""School Rumble"" has a great ensemble cast without any throwaway characters. Tsukamoto Tenma is the nave cute girl desperately in love with Karasuma Oji. Why she loves Karasuma is a mystery, as he is a stone-faced oddball with no particular interests outside of curry, and who wears a kappa costume whenever it is raining. Tenma is loved by the delinquent Harima Kenji, who tries to balance his wild nature with his feelings for Tenma. Tenma has a supporting cast of girlfriends, Eri (the rich princess), Mikoto (the brawny and busty kenpo athlete) and Akira (the cool calculator) who each have their romantic entanglements.

What is unique is how the series is handled. The first few episodes are pretty straight forward, but then the whole storyline takes a quick turn to left field, almost as if the writer got bored with his original plan. I always tell people looking to check out ""School Rumble"" that they need to stick with it for a couple of episodes when the pace and quality really pick up. Out of nowhere, Tenma's little sister comes in, with the ability to read the mind of any guy who finds her attractive, which is everyone but Harima Kenji. Kenji suddenly becomes a long-haired fortune teller with the ability to talk to animals. Ichijyo Karen makes an entrance, a small girl with tremendous strength who can lift a piano single-handedly. Slowly, the Harima/Tenma/Karasuma triangle heads backstage, and the crazy fun begins.

The animated series follows the comic almost exactly, with the same story arcs and situations. They did a phenomenal job capturing the look and feel of the comic. Tenma is even cuter here, and Harima is even cooler. The way they handled Tsukamoto Yakuma's (Tenma's sister) ability to read minds was quite clever. The animators obviously knew that the comic worked just as it was, and did a direct translation to screen.

This DVD collection by Funimation is equally fantastic. It has the entire first season, 26 episodes, in four slim cases. I love getting a whole season on DVD that doesn't take up a lot of space on my shelf. I'm not a big fan of dubbing, so I can't comment on that, but the subtitles are excellent and do a great job of capturing the original dialog.

Like others in Funimation's Viridian Collection, this box set is a re-release of ""School Rumble,"" offering a more ""bare bones"" edition at a lower price.",1263340800,18,3238,5.2776699029126215
6901663,5,B00R7ECEP6,"I was dreading this anime ever since I heard about what it was. I usually hate love triangles, and hopeless romance stuatons, but this anime thrives on both of those  things!!!

What makes it so good that I'll give it 5 stars?

Well, even though it's a romance anime, it's also a character-driven expedition that proves that the best qualities of people are shown when we are with people who we can trust, even if we aren't prepared for it.

Even though these two protagonists have their own love interests (one likes the other lead, and the other lead likes another. Confusing, right?), they are both the best of friends (later  on), and are both very likeable, and caring people... but they're also two of the most dense and stupidest anime characters EVER...

Out of all the anime you'll see, you wouldn't think that this title could do what it does and still be ridiculously  enjoyable. But the charm of this series is how every SINGLE character is practically fun, lovable, and necessary.

The extra OVA is not a sequel or a recap, it is just scenes of things that already happened in the past.

The ending of the series isn't really an ending it's more of a way of telling you that it continues on, and that everyone is much closer together than they were at the beginning...

The presentation is in 4:3, which isn't bad, but I do love widescreen, but this series doesn't have many special effects, so it's okay.

The audio options are in English stereo and Japanese stereo. Strange that  Funimation decided not to give the English ver. a 5.1 mix, but, again, this isn't a really super-special-effects anime...

As for the dubbing, I loved it (I usually love dubs to begin with)! Luci Christian and Brandon Potter, play the energetic and sweet Tenma, and the big-hearted and bad-boy Harima respectively. If you're familiar with these VA's you should well aware of hoe talented they are.

School Rumble first season  does what no anime can do very well. Which is, a romantic comedy that is doomed to fail. Our leads may have people they want to be with, but that doesn't mean that they won't make other people happy and content  instead...",1256256000,10,2144,4.647214854111406

It's not always easy for her to follow due to the Japanese culture and tropes they use, but she agrees it's extremely silly and fun to watch.

6901697,4,B00R7ECEP6,"They made some change from original story which I would not of changed.

- Harima and Yakumo coming into school with Harima's motorcycle front of entire school while they was racing against deadline of manga contest in middle of mid-term. Not only that Yakumo stayed at Harima's apartment (Itoko's apartment to be exact) over for few nights during those times and that created another ""miss understanding"" through out entire school. (... this becames another fuel to set off Eri's jealousy)

- After the school track meet and folk dance incident of Harima and Eri, Eri cut school for pretty good amount of time, not just single day. During this time Eri was managing her confused feeling with target practice (with Harima's face as drawn on target) and she walked to Tsukamoto Resident with Yakumo with clarify what was going on with Harima and Yakumo. (...except Eri is a chicken and she ran away as soon she rang door beel rang...).

- The Yakumo replacing the content of beer bottle with ice-tea, when the girls where spending night at Tsukamoto Resident.

.. and they replaced these with very cheesy last 2 episode with something else... I don't know why they did that. But other than that, it followed the original very story and every character was much more alive then comic books and that was real positive.

My favorite is Lala.. ""Ichi-Joe!!""  that has stuck with forever... and that was something original story could not do.",1376697600,,1435,4.836734693877551

Based of the hugely popular manga School Rumble follows several high school students in the strangest love triang-...er...polygon possibly shown in any mainstream anime. Harima (resident school bad*** and main character #1) likes Tenma. Tenma (resident school airhead and main character #2) likes Karasuma. Karasuma (resident school...oddball?) likes...?. Sounds simple right? WRONG! Throw in the mix of Tenma's friends who in the process of trying to help Tenma hook up with Karasuma end up up getting caught in the whirlwind of strange antics of Harima's pursuit of Tenma and Tenma's pursuit of Karasuma. Making sense yet? Well now add a full class of crazy kids who spice of the plot and if that wasn't bad enough there's enough interruptions, misunderstandings, and failed confessions for poor Harima and Tenma to make you want to run your head into a wall.
In between the chaos of Hanai who thinks Harima is after Tenma's little sister Yakumo, Lala who can from Mexico to fight school wrestling champ Ichijou, Akira (serect agent?), and a whole fleet of strange events how with our Harima and Tenma ever manage to get their feelings across?

Many parts of the love triangle just become irritating. I can say with out any doubt that the second semester is better in so many ways. If you are an animie fan, you will enjoy this. If you are looking for fan service, don't get it. If you are looking for a cozy romantic connection, this misses that by a mile. School Rumble is more of a comedy with a hint of romance, more geared towards young puppy love or classic crush since it is all mostly one sided.

The level of dirtyness of the show never goes past an argument over a girl's cup size, and the violence is very mild (until the beginning of the 2nd season where the school goes nuts.)  For those who don't want the extra craziness of the 2nd season, the 1st season is a good place to stop.  If you change your mind, you might even grab the season 1 and 2 box set later and shove the S.A.V.E. edition into the hands of a random friend.

This show is an over the top high school rom com if there ever was one. The writers throw convention and restraint to the wind and it works beautifully, there are several laugh out loud (see that, I typed the whole thing!) moments in each episode. The best episodes actually made me laugh so hard I cried, seriously. The animation is smooth and pleasant to watch. The character designs aren't exactly award winning, but the visual appearnace of each character and their expressions fit nicely with their evolving emotions as the series goes on. There are some tender moments in school rumble that can be heartwarming, but they add to and enrich the humor and overall story without stealing the show's thunder. Honestly folks, I'm an anime fan of 12 years on a seriously tight budget, and I can't recommend this title enough.

6901709,5,B00R7ECEP6,"SEE UPDATE BELOW:
This is a very good high school anime series.  Basically boy loves girl, girl loves other boy, other boy loves spicy food and water imps... and another boy loves girl, girl has a little ESP and hides from boy... and another boy is loved by all the girls but he loves the one girl who can't stand him...

It's on a level with Azumanga Daioh, but not as weird as Cromartie High School or as Otaku as Genshiken.  It's not very deep, but it is well paced, funny, and interesting.  The animation quality is top notch, maybe not up to the level of the big hitters, but equally as good as the latter mentioned series.  It's a solid 4 star, but for around $20 (when I bought it I think it was $22.99) it's a 5+ star!!!  I think Azumanga Daioh had more likable and interesting characters (5 star), Genshiken had clever Otaku references (4-5 star) and Cromartie was... well... insane (5 star).  So I based my four star rating off comparison with these others with Azumanga Daioh being the yardstick I measure all high school comedy anime on.

The price is amazingly low: one beef though, the plastic 'page' inside the case cracked and doesn't hold into the bracket anymore.  Just a minor irritant, doesn't bother the discs at all.

I prefer watching in Japanese with English subtitles because the dry humor just comes through so well in Japanese.

UPDATE (3/3/11): Just finished the last disc.  What a crazy and fun way to close out the series! The cat/Tenma swap was great, the UFO awesome, and it's worth watching the entire series for Harima's gesture towards Tenma after the 'cat dream'!

School Rumble is a fun series to watch because of all the love triangles, randomness, and zany characters. It's one of my favorite animes. This comedy is all over the place, but easy to follow. It follows one basic thing: ""It's not what it looks like!"" It's one of those series where I love all of the characters. They all have their moments in nonstop comedy. Schoorum may have a few overly dramatic parts, but it's only to lead up to a big joke. It's very random, which is one of the points that make it funny. For example, in one episode there may be a girl climbing out of the bathroom with plungers, in the next a 'survivor game' in the school. There are many love triangles, such as Harima, Tenma, Karasuma and curry. Hanai, Yakumo, Harima. Overall, it's a constant battle between class representative Haruki Hanai, and juvenile delinquent, Kenji Harima. All over the misunderstanding double meaning of 'Tsukamoto'.",1293494400,,1080,4.75

8694410,5,B00R7ECEP6,This is a really great anime. There is love and comedy and some fighting. My husband even likes this anime and he usually only watches shows like bleach and naruto.,1502064000,,164,4.5
8694411,5,B00R7ECEP6,"It's a basic collection with the season 1 episodes, the opening/closing songs, and a couple interviews. They do also include a couple ova's, which is cool. I wish they would have done that with the second season, too. The show itself is pretty good provided you're open to comedies or dramas. It's rated TV PG, but some of the thematic elements are a little more mature than that would suggest.

Overall, this is totally worth the price. The only draw back is that you may get hooked then slightly let down by the second season set, which does not include the 2 ovas that actually end the series.",1495584000,2,596,4.518518518518518
8694412,3,B00R7ECEP6,I thought I was buying the entire season but it was only 5 episodes.... best thing is the collectors case. It's my all time favorite anime and I'm just disappointed it's only 5 episodes.,1489104000,,186,4.5
