380078,3,630191564X,"It's a Fred Olen Ray flick. Need I say more.

Here's the scoop. A cheeseball indy film studio is producing a cheeseball sci-fi flick that is total exploitation. Things aren't going well so they bring in Emanuelle (Edy Williams with a boob job) as a ringer to build anticipation of the release. One of the problems is that people involved in the production are getting killed off. Who could the killer possibly be? Do we care?

This is what it is. It's a T&A flick of a type you don't see much anymore. The acting is bad. The sets are cheap. The costumes are alluring and the sound is as bad as everything else. I was in video distribution when this was released and, with a $52,000.00 budget, that's where it went. Not even a drive-in release to give it any respectability. But that's what it's all about. Just enough plot to get the viewer from one nude scene to the next. And it delivers the goods.

Yes this is some awful stuff but you know it going in so you really can't be disappointed. Just sit back and enjoy the beauties of the female form.",1354147200,13,1049,4.341836734693878
380079,5,630191564X,"I can't tell you anything about the plot because I was too busy watching all of the skin... There is nudity at least every 5 mins or so.  A great girl-girl wrestling match that of course is topless.... I thought it was some good skin for the buck.  Lets face it, you're not gonna buy a movie like this for a plot or story...",1290297600,8,324,4.046875
380080,5,630191564X,"Ignore the bad acting and hackneyed script...this movie delivers in the two areas that count most: cheap laffs and hooters (and lots of 'em!).

Edy Williams, Brinke Stevens, Jasae, Dana Bentley...eight of the finest boobs on Earth!

Don't take this flick seriously and have some fun!",1123545600,11,283,5.130434782608695
380081,3,630191564X,"The movie title is the title of the grade Z Sci-fi-sex comedy that a zany film production company is making.  It is sort of campy, but has lots of snappy sight and dialog gags inserted by a smart script writer.  The plot is rather thin--a Freddy-type menace is stalking and killing members of the film crew--wearing an Army surplus cold weather mask, yet.  The VHS version is certainly worth the...cost, and because it spoofs many other films (you have to be listening and watching closely to catch the subtle references and gags), it holds your attention in a campy way.  There is the requisite T&A, tho I was a bit put off by the pumped up female lead.  The movie is tongue in cheek, and a lot of the gags could have been done better, but is good enough for yucks and laughs when watching it with company with nothing better to do.",1017705600,3,833,4.4183006535947715
380082,2,630191564X,"On my quest to see everything famed B movie actress Brinke Stevens has been in, I bought a copy of Bad Girls From Mars.
Bad Girls stars Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls' Edy Williams and Jay Richardson from multiple  other Brinke Stevens films.
Starting off on the set of a movie (a campy b  movie about beautiful female aliens trying to take over the earth) it looks  good.  The first scene seems so funny that I thought I was in for a treat.  Unfortunately that was it as the director of the movie shouts out 'CUT' and  the movie stars revolving around the cast and crew that are making this  film.
The movie turns into a serial killer movie about the lead  actresses.  All of them seem to be getting murdered.  Enter in Edy Williams  as the new actress.
Some mild who dunnit, lots of Edy Williams  disrobing and that's about it for this movie.",911606400,25,844,4.339743589743589

When the leading actress is killed on the set, Edy Williams is brought in to replace her and hopefully discover who the killer is before she herself is killed.  After watching this I couldn't decide whether the cast were really bad actors or if they were just really good at playing bad actors.  The plot is virtually nonexistent and the main attraction is the topless scenes (on average, one every five minutes).  The movie gets four stars only because of Jay Richardson, who really camps it up in the roll of the egotistical but dim-witted male lead in the science fiction movie.",1445299200,,637,4.660714285714286
