1247510,5,B00001XT78,"Don't miss this classic European film that offers  a realistic portrayal of those who chose to become an integral part of the WWII war effort. Without the saboteurs in occupied countries like Belgium wreaking havoc, the war would have been even more difficult. There are few plots that have been woven with such skill into the storyline. The cast and acting are both exceptional. Recommended for all who enjoy this era in cinematology and those who want to discover it's depths.

The title came from Lord George Byron's, 'Childe Harold's Pilgimage:'

""Yet, Freedom! yet thy banner, torn, but flying,
Streams like the thunder-storm AGAINST the wind;
Thy trumpet-voice, though broken now and dying,
The loudest still the tempest leaves behind;
Thy tree hath lost its blossoms, and the rind,
Chopped by the axe, looks rough and little worth,
But the sap lasts, -- and still the seed we find
Sown deep, even in the bosom of the North;
So shall a better spring less bitter fruit bring forth.""

The sentiments so well expressed within the storyline.",1383177600,3,1043,4.909090909090909
1247511,4,B00001XT78,"I'm a big fan of WWII resistance films. This is a very good and entertaining one. It's not a heavy duty actioner with lots of chases, fights, bullets, explosions, or special effects. There are some, but it's presented more as a well-acted, tense, drama with some action sequences. The espionage escapades are quite original and enjoyable. It shows successes and the role of just-plain-old-nobody's-fault-bad-luck in the failures.

It feels very British in a stiff-upper-lip sort of way, but it also has that slice-of-life, take from it what you will, French narrative film quality. The characters are sufficiently defined that you will like most, dislike some, and feel the pain when a few of them die.

In his review, Tony Lesce said, ""... the emphasis is on the danger and the nagging fear an agent sent into enemy territory suffers..."" It't that nagging fear which carries the film.

Of course, we can't forget Simone Signoret, who starred twenty years later in the film masterpiece, ""Army of Shadows"". Many - including me - believe it to be the best WWII French Resistance film ever made.

I watched the streaming version and gave it four instead of five stars because the print is not great. It's quite watchable and the sound is good.",1379116800,,1303,5.161137440758294

1247513,5,B00001XT78,"This is the most authentic espionage movie I've ever seen. There is no James Bond super-hero type action, but instead the emphasis is on the danger and the nagging fear an agent sent into enemy territory suffers. Set during WWII, it lays out some of the training agents received, and showed that some casualties were from accidents, not enemy action. Parachuting from an aircraft is inherently dangerous, especially at night, and one of the team does not survive the drop. Overall, a very accurate, although low-key, portrayal of the secret agent's life.",1287100800,8,554,5.032608695652174
1247514,4,B00001XT78,"""Against the Wind"" was a 1947 British film from director Charles Crichton that was pretty much ignored when it came out because World War II stories were no longer of interest (remember, these are the people who got rid of Winston Churchill soon after victory was declared).  The film stars French actress Simone Signoret as the most prominent member of an international group of mostly Belgians brought together to be inserted behind German lines in Belgium where they will engage in acts of sabotage.  When one of their number (Peter Illing) is captured by the Nazis, the group heads off across the Channel to get him back.  The master sabotage plan is not really clear until too late in the film, as which point we are juggling a whole lot of fairly standard war plots, jumping back and forth between rescuing their comrade, dying noble deaths, disconnecting a railroad train car, discovering the traitor in their midst, and, yes, even finding time to fall in love.  But if you can get past the overly familiar plot lines the acting by Simone, Robert Beatty as Father Elliot using the confessional to pass information, John Slater as Emile Meyer who longs to see his wife, and Gordon Jackson as the somewhat shaky explosives expert Johnny Duncan who suffers from an appalling inability to speak French, is pretty good.
The script was based on real stories of those who fought in the Belgian resistance, but some of the authenticity is lost in the jumble of plot lines and some of the film's more melodramatic moments.  The film is certainly a change of pace for director Crichton, who is better known for comedies from ""The Lavender Hill Mob"" to ""A Fish Called Wanda.""  There is something of a documentary feel to the early part of the film where the group engaged in training and as long as Simone Signoret is on screen, our interest is maintained; especially when she coolly dispatches the double agent.  ""Against the Wind"" is a solid little war story, even if it came out to late to offer either inspiration or information to anybody.",1037491200,2,2040,4.745762711864407

7915027,3,B00001XT78,"While I am a fan of British war movies I found the first thirty-five minutes or so of this movie to be very boring.  I mean come already and get to the heart of the story.  I didn't allow the not so great  image or audio quality or of this movie to influence my three star rating. It just took to darn long to get going and I have no patience for movies like that. However i did stick with it and overall it wasn't a bad way to kill some time. I've seen better, much better and would never watch this movie again.",1406160000,,513,3.9134615384615383

7915032,5,B00001XT78,"This is another of the classic WWII films from J Authur Rank and Ealing Studios. It has all the elements of later, more sophisticated movies and British TV miniseries.  This movie has the formula of a good spy thriller - a hero or two, a heroine, a bad guy, a tyrant for a boss, and along the way a realistic and unexpected demise for some of the good guys. This movie is also interesting in that it is set in Belgium, rather than France, as most British spy films from that period were. If you own the miniseries ""Wish Me Luck"" then buy this movie; it is the Grandmother of that series. The climax on a moving freight train appears to have pioneered action sequences found in much later movies and TV, and is actually worth buying the movie for. To be fair, I have a weakness for these older movies, so my review is somewhat biased. The only shortcomming is the DVD itself - it appears to be taken from an older print, and the sound is somewhat muted in places. My profound thanks to Synergy Entertainment for recovering this classic for us to enjoy.",1389830400,2,1051,4.362244897959184
7915033,1,B00001XT78,"Am perplexed why no reviewer mentioned the abysmal picture AND sound quality of this probably fine film.  I would add that I played half the film on one large-flat screen Sony & the other half on another, with equally unacceptable results.  I dislike weighing in with only one star, but my hesitation is outweighed by a desire to caution other buyers, on the basis of my experience, of the possible risk involved in making what for myself was a disasterous investment.",1383264000,2,468,4.765432098765432
