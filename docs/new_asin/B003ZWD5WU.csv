4236412,5,B003ZWD5WU,"I've purchased this triple pack elsewhere and I wanted to express my admiration and respect for the show.

When ""Stargate: SG-1"" first came out on Showtime channel, I remembered the first film (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate/dp/B000JCSPG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate</a>) and I did not expected to see MacGyver in a ""new"" show as I always watched him as a kid. Then, I backed away for a while and gave into indulgence to a world of college years, and I came back to the show when it came out on SciFi channel with the re-runs of previous seasons. Right then, I became hooked to the show.

All four characters (O'Neill, Jackson, Carter, and Teal'c) were magnificent. O'Neill was one of the main characters and was a leader of SG-1 until his promotion to a general. He, along with Daniel Jackson, was among the first team to step through the stargate and experienced first-hand the battle with a Goa'uld named ""Ra"" in the film. I felt Anderson's character in the series to be more comedy yet serious man and quite a strong influence among the team. I sure was glad to see him again in a brief cameo for ""Continuum."" Daniel Jackson (played by Michael Shanks) is my favorite character because of his profound ancient knowledge and his knack for discovering many things hidden. I sure was saddened when he ""died"" and then he appeared as an ""Ascended Being"" and returned as human. As a character, he had had gone through a great deal, even for an archeologist (not to mention the fact that he ""died"" so many times over the years). It's a guilty pleasure of mine that I often wanted to be like him. I always learned something new and exciting from him. As for Carter, she is sexy as hell and yet I often found myself at lost when it comes to understanding her when she started speaking techo and astro to the rest of the team over the years. Finally, Teal'c, as a former First Prime of the Goa'uld Apophis, is a firm warrior and willing to sacrifice his life for the value of freedom, not just for himself but for others. The last two characters have my respect for their well-founded knowledge and inner strength among the team and served as role models for the rest of the SG Command.

I do admit that I was surprised to see Ben Browder and Claudia Black arrived on scene as Colonal Mitchell and Vala Mal Doran respectively for later years on the show (as I've seen them both in ""Farscape"" - a show that I hardly seen). They both made great additions to the team for each have exciting personality and I still admired their presences.

""Children of the Gods: Final Cut"" is comprised of two-part pilot episode, which is about the re-creation of the Stargate program, one year after the original film, and follows several characters from the film with three ""new"" characters for the series. O'Neill was taken out of retirement ""again,"" Jackson was ""believed"" to be dead but now living, and we meet for the ""first time"" Captain Carter and Teal'c. While everyone was assuming that Ra was still alive, they meet a new villain who goes by the name of Apophis. This final-cut version have new visual effects and never-before-seen scenes with few existing scenes been altered (the nudity had been removed).

""Stargate: The Ark of Truth"" takes place after the SG-1 series finale and served as a conclusion to the Ori story. This film expressed the story where SG-1 was searching for the ""Ark of Truth"", an Ancient device that was designed to brainwash whoever looks into it. It's very much like the series as there are many characters included from the show, including the two opposing ascended beings: Adria and Morgan le Fay. While I was expecting to see Ori and SG-1 fighting it out in this film, I just didn't expected to see Replicators making their appearances with an interesting twist.

""Stargate: Continuum"" is considered to be a sequel to ""Stargate: The Ark of Truth,"" which serves as the conclusion to the story involving the last system lord, Ba'al. This film involved time-travel and alternate universe where Ba'al went back in time and changed the timeline to which three members of SG-1 survived the initial changeover and had no choice but to live in an alternate world. Ba'al now armed with the knowledge gained from the original timeline, took control of the entire Goa'uld Empire with all the known system lords serving him. Then, he plans on taking over the Earth in a calm manner while SG-1 once again been called to service and aims to change back their timeline.

All three films in this triple pack are very enjoyable to watch and to watch again. It's great to have in a collection for a fan and wonderful stories to get lost in. I would, without a doubt, recommend them to the fans of the series but those who have never seen the series before will likely be disoriented by the stories - as I would suggest to them to watch the series (if one cannot watch all 10 seasons, I would recommend watching 9th and 10th seasons as they contain the stories that gives a kind of a back-story to these last two films).",1363651200,7,5074,4.700787401574803
