545431,5,6303038514,"Frank Lauder's ""The Happiest Days of Your Life"" represents British comedy at its best.  Alastair Sim (Wetherby Pond) and Margaret Rutherford (Muriel Whitechurch) provide a command performance as headmasters of separate non-coed prep schools.  The supporting cast add an additional comical romp that begins as an ordinary day with the arrival of a new English instructor, Richard Tassell (John Bentley), which appears to be the plot of the story.  However, that is not the case, and scene after scene show the unpredictable and uncanny craft that Lauder offers in order to portray the madcap adventures that occur at Nutbourne Academy.

The film revolves around a fictitious all boys prep school, Nutbourne Academy, which is situated along the English countryside.  Problems arise when there appears to be a mix-up with the Ministry of Education.  They accidently goofed in assigning an all-girls school, St. Swithin, to bunk and attend classes at Nutbourne; just the name of the school gives you the hint that all chaos will break out.  However, not without a laugh a minute.  The climax of the film showcases a visit from one of the all-girls school's parents and their tour around the school.  And at the same time, the Governors of Nutbourne pay a visit as well.  In the process, a lot of shifting occurs in order to prevent Nutbourne from passing as a co-ed school.

""The Happiest Days of Your Life"" is one of those movies that show that within a whirlwind of chaos and confusion, laughter goes a long way.  Enjoy.",1123977600,7,1518,4.933070866141732
545432,5,6303038514,"Alistair Sim and Margaret Rutherford acting opposite and off each other. What more do you need to know? Sit back, enjoy and marvel how they can do so much with so little. Are there any actors today who can be so effortlessly funny? Bill Cosby maybe, but the list starts and ends with him.

If Sim and Rutherford are not enough, there is also Joyce Grenfell, but nothing can distract from two great actors at their wonderful best",1114473600,3,428,4.487179487179487
545433,4,6303038514,"I rated this film with 4 stars due only to the fact that the original play it is based upon was & is a bit creaky to begin with.  However for devotees of British cinema and comedy I need utter only three names:  Margaret Rutherford, Alistair Sim and Joyce Grenfell- enough said already.  These comic geniuses redeem, transform and illuminate an average vehicle of this most British comedy of errors centered around a public school.  And yes, growing coffee in Tangynika sounds like a great opportunity.",1097193600,14,502,4.8023255813953485

looks dated but still funny.no dorky special effects so the actors and actresses had to act which is something you can't say today. These british films could always put a smile on your face that's why true british culture will always be ours.",1075248000,6,282,4.549019607843137

7835966,4,6303038514,"THE HAPPIEST DAYS OF YOUR LIFE is redolent of an era of 'make do and mend,' when everyone in Britain had to endure the privations of education on a shoestring.  Based on a stage success, Frank Launder's film boasts two towering central performances by Alistair Sim and Margaret Rutherford as the head teachers of the boys' and girls' schools forced to share accommodation.  The two actors have a field day, using their full range of facial expressions to create characters who, although harassed, can make the best of an almost impossible situation.  The supporting cast contains some memorable cameos, notably Joyce Grenfell as Miss Gossage (""you can call me sausage""), Richard Wattis as a harassed teacher (no one could do harassed like Wattis), and Guy Rolfe as a slimy boys' school teacher with an eye for young women.  The film zips along at breakneck speed, especially at the end, when the two head teachers try their best to convince some visitors that everything in their school is perfectly normal.  THE HAPPIEST DAYS OF YOUR LIFE is only seventy-five minutes long, but is nonetheless packed with incident and humor. Definitely worth a look if you're feeling low.",1385251200,,1172,4.959183673469388
7835967,5,6303038514,"Movies made before the 1960's tend to be my favorites for so many reasons, and this lighthearted film fits right in to my favorites list.  Alastair Sim was so perfect for the role of Scrooge, that I often forget he was a great actor in other films. I was delighted to hear his laugh once again. Margaret Rutherford couldn't have been more perfect for this role and was well-chosen.

There is little I can add to other reviews, but do put this movie into your library if you love older movies, particularly those with wonderful, seasoned English actors.",1370390400,2,552,4.622448979591836
7835968,5,6303038514,"The Happiest Days of Your Life refers to your younger days spent at school.  however no school is like the two schools shown in this film.  it's a tale of how an unfeeling  and inept Ministry Of MisEducation manages to get two schools mixed up, one being a Boys School and the other of course a Girls School, with the funniest results possible,  the previous reviews say it all and i cannot improve on them.

However, i could not let this pass by without chiming in with  an experience i had  a very long time ago.  i actually discovered a theater in upper Manhattan (NYC) in Washington Heights that was showing as a double feature ""The Happiest Days of Your Life and ""The Belles of St Trinans"".  Heaven in a movie theater.  even the discovery of a flat tire and a parking ticket after this magical exhibition couldn't dim my enjoyment and the memories of that evening.",1366416000,,869,4.477707006369426
7835969,5,6303038514,"This comedy Gem stars the wonderful Alistair Simm as the Headmaster of an all boys school that, by a clerical mixup, is forced to share space with an all girls school run by the equally wonderful Margaret Rutherford.

7835970,4,6303038514,"First the picture quality, etc of this DVD is excellent. Next, I came to it with high expectations, recalling my enjoyment of it decades ago. I'd recommend it highly but add a small caveat: be prepared for a bit of a fall-off in its brilliance as you progress towards the end. The problem is understandable and is shared by a lot of comedies. As with The Lavender Hill Mob, the unfolding of the situation in the first half hour is impeccable. I could watch the professionalism of the scene sequencing, the editing, the introduction and departure of one character after another, the restraint of the double takes; it's a joy to watch. There are little moments like the comment about the gong-ringing, the crocodile of arriving students and parting of the kitchen staff, the look of dread on Alistair Sim's face as the victualing by the domestic science students is broached, the wonderful trapped way he moves towards a blank corner of the room, and so on. It is simply that it's a tall order to keep up this nicely controlled process and the film tends to become a little desperate, just as The Lavender Hill Mob did when we got into the police exhibition. Rutherford is classic of course, and watch Joyce Grenfell. There is a tiny moment when she makes a little duck-like movement of her body that echoes that funny little gesture of coyness she does with her chin; it's a sort of postural ""golly"". So, as they say,""For people who like this sort of thing, this is the sort of thing they like.""",1290729600,2,1494,4.599250936329588
7835971,5,6303038514,"The other reviewers have already said what a wonderful movie this is. All I am doing is begging the powers that be to please make a DVD available. My old old video could break any day now and that would be an awful event. It also seems to me that there was an extra scene or two that I saw when it was screened at a college movie event when I was the age of the hapless students. If that is so, I hope the full movie makes it to the DVD",1178841600,,436,3.75
7835972,5,6303038514,"It is no exaggeration to say that this is one of the great British classic comedies ever made. Sim and Rutherford dance an exquisite and complicated dance of manners while wrestling for power. Watch out for Joyce Grenfell who steals all the scenes. Although the world in which the premise for this film operated is now largely non-existant (at least on the surface), viewers will adore the little touches of wit and dry comments which are almost unbearably perfect! Why on earth is this not on DVD?! Beg, borrow or steal a copy of this film, yes, even on VHS; pour yourself a glass of port and take the phone off the hook. You will find yourself watching this time and time again and it is a guaranteed cure for any kind of blues.",1168128000,5,730,4.455223880597015
