3145941,3,B0015NR2F2,"After reading high praise for Cheryl Barker's Butterfly, here and elsewhere, I was expecting great things and tried very hard to like this performance, but I could not.  The singing was just not that good, and by good I mean pleasant to hear.  Ms. Barker's lower register was beautiful, but all the higher notes (and that's what makes the opera!) were unpleasantly harsh.  To be fair, this probably came across better in the theater, and her acting was good.  Sharpless and Goro were OK, but other performances were not that strong vocally.  Scenery and costuming were a bit unusual, and there were a host of nonspeaking characters, dressed in yellow moving around the stage, which detracted from the drama, in my opinion.  But none of that would have mattered if the singing had been good!",1284336000,2,790,4.814814814814815
3145942,3,B0015NR2F2,"I had no knowledge of the cast or company prior to reading other reviews. Based on the enthusiastic comments, I ordered and looked forward to watching and listening to this most recent Madama Butterfly.
The voices are technically excellent but overall, this is hardly a 5 star product. The scenary is well done for a minimalist approach. I acknowldge that I prefer more classical staging and scenary but even with a minimalist approach, more is certainly possible - specifically the ""entrance of Butterfly"" - in my mind, one of the most beautiful scenes in opera. She should be heard before she is seen, her voice soaring above her companions, building expectations. I have seen this as a magically moment - even when the Butterfly is in reality overweight and older. It is theatre magic when done right. This production moves through it almost mechanically.
Even the best live performances are frequently performed by non-Asians but more certainly could have been done with makeup, particularly when you have the closeness of the video camera and the well-lit [perhaps too well lit] production. Yes, Pinkerton should be exuding testosterone but I found our handsome Pinkerton's and attractive Butterfly's acting (and singing) too mechanical.
This production would have been better as a CD as opposed to a DVD as the bright lights, limited make-up, minimalist scenery, ordinary stage management do not add to the experience.
Finally, although the vocal elements are technically very well done, they lack feeling. I listened to an old Tebaldi-Bergonzi CD afterwards and one realizes what expert reviewers are talking (or writing) about in terms of investing the roles with feeling, passion, drama. Some time ago, I saw (and heard Scotto) near the end of her performing career - you did not see her age or weight - she was magically transformed.

3145943,5,B0015NR2F2,"We should be thankful to be living in a day when we have access to seeing as many opera productions as we can. Opera is an art form that involves the lot, singers, orchestra, sets, costumes, lighting and the drama. Opera was not written for a CD, it is meant to be seen as well. Thank god we have recordings, but now we can watch as well. This butterfly is as full an experience as you could imagine. Yes I have amongst others the magnificent Scotto and Callas recordings as well as a unique recording by the great spinto Eleanor Streber. I have wonderful DVDs of Freni, Kabaivanska, the stunning La Scala production with Yasuko Hayashi and the filmed version by Frdric Mitterrand. All are good and great in their own way and I detract from none of them. However this performance by the beautiful Cheryl Barker is a stunner. I would not call it minimalist, but elegant and powerful, It is no use complaining about the supposed acoustic difficulties of the Sydney Opera House as in the over 30 years I have travelled there I have nothing to complain about. I have seen wonders there in both artists and productions, I have bruised my hands clapping, injured my feet stamping and swollen my throat cheering. Yes I have had the experience of great live opera there as well as elsewhere. I have seen a rather dead Butterfly in Vienna one night followed by a magnificent Macbeth another. It matters not where, but who. I also have attachments to this opera such as seeing the very young and large in stature and voice, Jane Eaglan sing it here in Brisbane in a heart thumping, exciting production in a voice that indicated the Wagner and big Verdi roles she would later conquer. I also remember opening night of a beautiful Butterfly with the great Australian Soprano Joan Carden a day after I nearly drowned on a boat trip with her and a couple of others from the production. Fortunately, only I did the drowning. Another season I was invited to attend every night as I was involved with supporting the opera in those days.

In this DVD Cheryl Barker begins as the wide eyed young girl and ends with devastating emotional impact. Her voice is strong and beautiful. She sounds like an opera singer and can act more convincingly than any Butterfly I have seen. There is a lot of originality in the characterisation of familiar roles and all works to reveal the story and the reality of the human drama enfolding. Impact, impact,impact. The handsome blond Jay Hunter Morris (Pinkerton)from Texas, is the perfect flirtatious cad whose lovely voice is seductive and manipulative. We see a best friend in Suzuki and a beautiful son. Add flower petals, some white silk, a pond and the soaring orchestra and magic is born.",1262044800,14,2710,4.645833333333333
3145944,4,B0015NR2F2,The vocal performances are outstanding. I would have made this a 5 star review if the costuming and makeup could have reflected a more Asian/Japanese mood to enhance the beautiful efforts of Ms Barker.,1252540800,,201,4.9411764705882355
3145945,5,B0015NR2F2,"I can only reiterate what the first reviewer has stated.  Opera Australia has a knack of getting to the heart of the matter, without using distracting gimmickry of staging etc.

I have long believed Cheryl Barker to be one of the most under-appreciated sopranos in the world.  Her ability to act are on a par with that outrageous Diva Angela Gheorghiu, yet her 'Australian-ness' has kept her grounded and a complelety professional and delightful performer.

The acoustics of the Sydney Opera House have always been difficult.  It is a great pity that the ABC didn't record this in Melbourne during its season, as the acoustics are far superior.  It is clear that no wizardry has been weaved to enhance the sound of this 1997 production, and that is evident also on the CD release (ABC Classics/Universal Music 476104-0).  One can only hope that with all the new technology available for audio and video restoration, that ABC Classics will release an improved version, because this performance, in my mind, is hard to beat.

I guess what Opera Australia do best is bring plausibility to their productions, which instantly make them more accessible and enjoyable.  Casting fine singers who look the part is also another part of their success.

Despite the caveats of the sound, I still return to this production for sheer enjoyment.  While I don't mind updating Opera settings, I find the 2003 Netherlands Opera performance&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Madama-Butterfly-Giacomo-Puccini-Netherlands-Opera/dp/B001FZQOO0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Madama Butterfly - Giacomo Puccini / Netherlands Opera</a>, also starring Cheryl Barker, to be alienating in its austerity.

3145946,5,B0015NR2F2,"THIS IS FAR THE BEST VERSION OF THIS OPERA AVAILABLE ON DVD!

3145947,5,B0015NR2F2,"In many ways this Opera Australia (OA) Madama Butterfly reminds me of the 1993 OA La Boheme --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Puccini-La-Boheme-Baz-Luhrmann-The-Australian-Opera-2002-Edition/dp/B00006LPE9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Puccini - La Boheme / Baz Luhrmann, The Australian Opera (2002 Edition)</a>. Each production illuminates relationships and develops the libretto in ways which make the story more meaningful and understandable.  For example, Butterfly and Suzuki are clearly girlfriends and not merely mistress and loyal servant in the OA Butterfly.

If you value opera as a theatrical experience, both this DVD and the OA La Boheme are hard to beat.  If you care only about the music making and could care less about the drama on stage, stick with Scotto and Callas.  Each is in excellent form and their Madama Butterfly studio recordings are superior to the sometimes difficult acoustics of the Sydney Opera House.  Visually, however, the Scotto and Callas recordings are no competition since these sound-only recordings lack any video.

Everyone in the OA cast not only acts and sings well, but each has a physical appearance that matches their character well.  Cheryl Barker, the only principal who is also in the OA La Boheme, is even better as Butterfly than she was as Mimi.  Done four years later in 1997 (not in 1974 as indicated on Amazon's site), Barker's voice is significantly stronger, although she had yet to achieve the vocal polish she reached in 2003 when recording her Puccini Passion CD with Richard Bonynge (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Puccini-Passion/dp/B000ION66S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Puccini: Passion</a>).  In both operas, her acting is animated, engaging, and moving, getting better as each opera moves from opening to final act.  No soprano capable of singing Madama Butterfly can realistically portray the 15 year old Butterfly of Act 1.  Barker comes close, although by the end of Act 1 she still seems to me more woman than child.  In Acts 2 and 3, however, she very much captures the teenage, 18 year old Butterfly in a way that no one else I have seen has attempted, let alone managed.

It is worth noting director Moffatt Oxenbould's staging.  The set has a stylish, traditional feel despite using a modern, minimalist approach to the point where sometimes humans discretely play furniture, parts of Butterfly's house, dream figments, and other things.  No doubt clothing the principle players in traditional appearing garments, the extensive use of wood and screens, and the inherently minimalist nature of Japanese aesthetics contributes to the traditional feel.  Still, it is remarkable that overall effect is much closer to turn-of-the-century Japan than something resembling a space ship.  Also noteworthy is the work of lighting designer Robert Bryan who makes the color and shading of Butterfly's house echo the mood and circumstances of the libretto.

In summary, this is a superb Madama Butterfly, if you have an interest in what is happening on stage.  Even if you could care less about the drama, you still should find Barker's well sung Butterfly worth hearing despite the Sydney Opera House's less than super acoustics.",1214870400,29,3271,5.598377281947261

The sound quality is probably the most disappointing factor, and definitely keeps this at 4 stars. That said, the overall level of the performance is high. The production is quite lovelyas good as you can expect in Sidney's beautiful but compromised opera houseand honors Puccini's score and understanding of the story. The cast is solid, if not the best that could be imagined, and the orchestra is first-rate. I found the acting good throughout, with many nice touches, especially by Jay Hunter Morris as Pinkertona notoriously ungrateful role to do justice to. He has to be callous enough to reflect the American arrogance toward the culture and the people of Japan (not to mention Butterfly!) but not so nasty that Butterfly's devotion, and their gorgeous love music become meaningless.  I do not hesitate to recommend this to anyone who either is looking for one outstanding Butterfly for their collection, or anyone who wants to fill out their collection with a solid, well performed traditional Butterfly.",1396224000,,1162,4.989690721649485
8259192,4,B0015NR2F2,"I thoroughly enjoyed this very moving performance though I too agree that Butterfly's entrance was weak. The makeup was weak as well. It was often difficult to suspend belief that she was actually a 15 year old innocent girl. Barker comes off a little closer to Elektra than a duped teen. But generally this is quite well played.

Suzuki is great. All the men in the cast are superb. Pinkerton makes you want to scream at him and the U.S. consul conveys sympathy well. The marriage broker is nearly a mime but plays well the character at which to boo and hiss.

The child could have had some acting coaching. Granted, his part is nearly irrelevant but he was rather wooden.

So I took off a star. Still I'm glad to have this in my collection and wonder if there is anything better available? There are some very tough parts in this opera so I don't see a young, cute Asian being able to carry the music. That said, the performance may be just about as good as it can get.

If you're relatively new to opera, this a great DVD to buy. It's not expensive and the story is very compelling. Seasoned viewers may find more fault.

8259193,4,B0015NR2F2,"I have recently begun to follow the career of tenor Jay Hunter Morris, and purchased the video primarily because he is in the cast.  The production is from the late 1990's, about 15 years before the wider opera world learned very much about Morris, and it's pleasant to see him handling a major role so early in his career.  He makes a very convincing lover in the rapturous duet, and handles the other dramatic scenes well.

Soprano Barker seems much too old for the role of teenaged Butterfly, but this is not something to be held against her, very few sopranos appear young enough during the years when their voices are at their peak, and full length videos and shorter clips usually feature women long past their teen years.  Her voice, however, is wonderful.

The staging is done very traditionally.  The orchestra is fine, camera angles all done well.

For Morris fans, this is worth the price.  I would have liked more extras, perhaps a tour behind the scenes of the famous Sydney opera house, and an interview with the director.  But in the late 1990's, those goodies were not de rigeur.",1374451200,,1095,4.661458333333333
