but a friend of mine got me to watch Munger Road on a trip to Chicago.
I can tell you I jumped from my seat a few times. I thought the story
line was good and I walked away thinking I hope the sequel comes out
soon as I want to know what happens to these kids.. Worth the watch.
Bruce was an awesome sheriff  in this movie and the kids were amazing. The next
time I fly to Chicago I will be looking to find Munger Road!

5182075,4,B008U1ANOY,I really like this movie. I saw this in theater's. Nick did a great job with the limited funds he had and even being a small town director. Good job Nick everyone in Saint Charles is proud of you!,1347235200,2,196,4.051282051282051
5182076,4,B008U1ANOY,"This thriller kept me on the edge of my seat.  With two story lines going back and forth, I kept wanting more from one while the other drew me in.  This kept me interested in the current storyline while anticipating going back to the second storyline.  Great suspense and good choice of characters.",1347148800,3,298,4.584905660377358
5182077,5,B008U1ANOY,"I had met the director, Nick Smith, when he was a student at Columbia College. When I went to an early screening of this movie, what I expected to see was a ""student film"". But from the opening frame this film was an incredible surprise. Suspense, scares, really good performances, interesting visuals, wonderfully shot, an amazingly professional first-time film. I was surprised that Roger Ebert chose to review this film but not surprised that he gave it a rave three-star review (out of four). This film is worth seeing! Maybe even more than once!",1347062400,4,550,4.861702127659575

5182150,4,B008U1ANOY,"A group of friends heading out to a railrod crossing to try and experience a supernatural phenomenon said to occur there.  A town sheriff and his deputy patrolling the streets, on the lookout for an escaped convict who went on a murder spree in the town years before.  These and other seemingly unrelated plots and subplots converge in the atmospheric horror movie Munger Road, a little-known gem.  It's the kind of movie where you're drawn in before even understanding what's going on, and it stays riveting as the pieces start getting drawn together.  The feelings of uncertainty about how different elements relate to each other ends up being a plus rather than a minus.  It's well-made, scary, engaging, and features high caliber performances from the whole cast.

The only flaw with the movie, and this has been noted by others, is that the ending is Very abrupt.  I've got nothing at all against open door endings, but there kind of wasn't even that - the movie just stops on a dime.  It's obvious they intended for there to be a sequel, but it's been a little while now and there doesn't seem to be any sign of one.  I really hope they make one, but even without this still stands out as a pretty excellent, if incomplete, horror mystery.",1433289600,,1245,4.648401826484018

It says to be continued.",1423008000,,97,4.157894736842105
5182153,3,B008U1ANOY,"Nothing new to see here, not even any outstanding rendition of familiar territory. But a pleasant enough way to kill 90 minutes while reading the paper or some such. Bruce Davison and his partner manage a certain small-town charm, and the teenaged cannon fodder isn't actively annoying.",1399507200,,286,5.1063829787234045
5182154,5,B008U1ANOY,This movie is masterfully done. It is a good popcorn flick. It's very entertaining. The acting isn't cheap or cheesy like in other horror movies.,1385683200,,145,4.84

5182156,3,B008U1ANOY,"I had never heard of this before, but apparently if you leave your car on the train tracks on this road, ghosts will push it off to save you from potential train accidents.

5182157,5,B008U1ANOY,Great movie to watch. I like the movie cause there wasn't to many special effects which sometimes it takes away from the and it doesn't make it real enough to seem scary.,1361750400,2,170,4.34375
5182158,5,B008U1ANOY,We saw the movie at the show and it was scary. It's better at home with the lights out. Eerie and subtle at same time. Doesn't hit you over the head with jump out scares.,1360022400,2,170,3.8857142857142857
5182167,5,B008U1ANOY,I saw this movie at the theater and honestly can compare it to the original Halloween (with Jaime Lee Curtis).  Absolutely bone chilling with little to no gore.  The psycho factor is there minus the blood.  More modern day horror movies should be filmed like this.  Sometimes the imagination and anticipation are more entertaining than the blood and guts. This will probably turn into the same cult classic that Halloween eventually became.,1357948800,2,440,5.069444444444445
5182168,1,B008U1ANOY,I have no idea why they gave this movie this title. I think they came up with this title because they didn't know what else to name this garbage. Total trash and I want my money back.,1357948800,2,183,3.972972972972973
5182169,1,B008U1ANOY,First time after 30 minutes I fell asleep. I woke up to try to watch more of it but then fell asleep. Later that day I saw up to 1 hour and fell asleep.

5182170,1,B008U1ANOY,"The movie is slow, predictable and worse...unfinished. There are a lot of movies with sequels, but at least they tie up most of the plot before ending and gearing up for a new chapter. This one simply goes off with nothing explained at all and a ""To Be Continued"" that only makes you swear never to waste money on this title again. I deserve my money back after that bait and switch move!",1356739200,3,388,4.328767123287672
5182171,1,B008U1ANOY,This is just an all around bad film. Very confusing plot and an infuriating ending. I can not believe people liked this film.,1356739200,,125,4.478260869565218
5182172,1,B008U1ANOY,"This could have been a good movie, in the style of the far better ""Wind Chill"". There were moments of suspense, and a few pretty creepy images. However, at least 50% of the film is so dark, you can only guess by sound effects what is happening. There are long periods where the screen is totally black. I actually thought there was something wrong with my tv. I watch movies to actually WATCH them. If I wanted radio theater, I would turn on the radio.

The other, and totally unforgivable, problem with this film is the ending. I don't care if this is a spoiler: the makers of this film didn't know how to end it, so they went for the total rip-off: To Be Continued... I couldn't quite believe it. I paid $3.99 for ""To Be Continued""? I might have given it 3 stars in spite of its other failings, if it hadn't been for that outrage. I wish I had read the other reviews before I rented this. I just looked at the inexplicably high average rating and took my chances. Big mistake.",1356220800,2,978,4.286486486486487
5182173,4,B008U1ANOY,This little gem is not bad.  I checked it out on a whim and was delighted about by impulse decision.  This story is a ghost/suspense and horror story done a bit more cleaner than most of the movies coming out.  It does not necessary thrive on gore but it's story line.  I noticed that the role the small town police department seems to play is more genuine and real instead of the stereotypical ones.,1355961600,,400,4.364864864864865
5182174,4,B008U1ANOY,This movie has a lot of suspense and a good story line! I believe the writer / director has a great future.,1353888000,2,107,3.909090909090909

5182176,2,B008U1ANOY,This movie actually ended with 'to be continued'.  Another movie labeled 'horror' that certainly wasn't.  It seemed like a made for TV movie.  Amazon should let their customers know this.,1353628800,2,187,5.166666666666667
5182187,3,B008U1ANOY,"I saw this in the theater near where it was filmed, so that was kind of for nostalgia. This was a film made for less than $500,000 so you can not expect a lot. You do not see much of the hinted at violence in the film, in fact there is essentially no violence, more just low budget horror suspense, so if you want some (not many) scares but no nudity and no blood splatter, this is that sort of supernatural horror. The lead actress (Brooke Peoples) provides some nice eye candy and acts well. Bruce Davison is a well known actor and plays his role quite well.  Worth a watch, but don't expect any big budget effects.  Shot on a RED camera if I recall, so nice cinematography and color grading, as well as audio, unlike some low budget horror films. You don't have ditsy no-experience actors in this film, the acting is done well enough, It is the script that falls short in my opinion, and with a very unsatisfying ending.",1353283200,,923,4.329479768786127
5182188,1,B008U1ANOY,"Munger was painfully boring, made for tv type movie. I am so angry I wasted $3.99 and totally confused by all the high ratings! I've seen plenty of low budget, pg-13 scary movies that were fairly decent. I am assuming most of the viewers were teens. To be continued???? Trust me. Skip this one.",1352419200,2,294,4.462962962962963
5182189,4,B008U1ANOY,The movie was very suspenseful and interesting. I'm excited for the sequel. Nick Smith did a great job on this movie. The Bears still suck.,1351209600,,139,4.6
5182190,3,B008U1ANOY,"** CONTAINS SPOILERS **

I mean, sure, we've all fallen prey to a great horror/murder premise that leads us in to watch it with either a good storyline, a good trailer or even just some well put together cover art re: DVD or poster ... but ending anything on TO BE CONTINUED is b/s of the highest order, sorry!

OK, as you can read either a) ""it was so realistic, so wonderful,"" or b) ""it was bad, so bad"" in the 22 other reviews listed here before me, let me bring you up to speed quickly with an A-Z ... a local fair is setting up for the weekend and at the same time a convicted child killer breaks out of prison (we never see his photo on the fax though) and a group of 4 teens journey out to Munger Road, the scene of some spooky goings-on over the years.

The fair is a waste of plot time, the escaped convict too (as he proves to have been already killed in a hit and run at 11pm the same night he escaped), and so the only two stories are a) the Sheriff and his deputy chasing a copper piping thief out of (would you credit it) the escaped convicts old house, and b) the four teens stuck in a broken down car gone midnight on a spooky, foggy road!

As the kids get supposedly (as we never see it happen to any of them) killed off one by one by a mysterious, red lumberjack-shirted older man (who loves to leave a single handprint on their car windows), the Sheriff and his deputy eventually make their way to the old house that the convict used to own - and kill his past victims. The only girl to escape thus far was Jo, who instead of following the rail road track into town, decides to veer off into the woods, finds the creepy house, and then chooses to look inside for her boyfiend!

She encounters the ""killer"" who chases her outside by the barn, where she finds her boyfriend, Corey, safe and sound - but acting too calm, too ""ok"" with everything for my liking! He then, off camera, goes to fight the ""killer,"" whereupon seemingly loses and the ""killer"" (still unseen) comes to kill Jo - but doesn't, letting her survive. But she DOES get a look at him.

Come the arrival of the police, they comb the area but there's no sign of the other three teens - dead or alive - but the camcorder that one of them uses throughout to record ghostly stuff is quickly studied. It's then that, given it's last entry, the deputy asks Jo what really happened ... and as the camera turns to her, the screen goes black and the words TO BE CONTINUED come up!

This film was not good enough that it needed to be a two-parter, but was just about good enough to be a solid 3 out of 5 movie for entertainment value. The acting was cheesy at the start, but once you got to know the characters you accepted their level of acting and went along for the ride, so to speak.

In closing, it was co-produced by Robert Englund and his wife so that might explain a few things! (but not much!!)",1351036800,6,2876,4.169369369369369
5182191,5,B008U1ANOY,"I think the director, Nick Smith, did a commendable job with this movie. Being from the area where it is set and knowing the history of Munger Road added to the suspense. My kids and their friends from Glenbard North High School would often drive to the area (which I did not know until recently that years ago, they did this) and even if you don't believe any of the tales, the location has always been a dark, eerie place - the road and surrounding area itself is unique. Sure it can be said- that is true of many other areas but Munger Road, (the actual road) has its own set of circumstances; it remains isolated and remote, and as depicted in the movie the kids can run or walk but seemingly, any direction leads to nowhere, especially at night. The actor Bruce Davison does a fantastic job, Randall Batinkoff is great, the ""kids"" are excellent as well. Munger Road is enhanced by this cast, in that, their characters are believable. Hopefully, a sequel or part 2 will be made of Munger Road.",1350777600,2,997,4.453551912568306
5182192,5,B008U1ANOY,I saw it the day it came out in the theater. I enjoyed it even more the second time seeing it at home.  I love seeing St. Charles and the surrounding area in a film.  Can't wait for the sequel!,1350345600,,193,3.8

SPOILER ALERT: the ending - to be continued? Really? This isn't a weekly made for TV movie, so that was a total rip-off. SO you basically are watching a movie with a story you may never know the ending to. That was a very cheap shot.",1350172800,12,390,4.2
5182194,5,B008U1ANOY,"I just saw this movie last night at it's re-release at Charlestown Mall in St. Charles. Uncoincidentally, it is the weekend of the Scarecrow Festival there. I loved the movie! Not only was it really fun to see St. Charles as the backdrop (I got married in the church they went into, and had my reception in the Rainbow Room at Hotel Baker, also a scene in the movie), but I also think it was a very good horror movie. Good use of lighting and sound, an effective score, solid acting and a serious dose of suspense made for a very enjoyable movie experience. Another thing I appreciated was that all the violence happened off camera. You could hear it but not see it...that's always so much worse!",1349568000,2,696,4.4453125

Had a bit of suspense and leaves you questioning in the end, but I probably won't watch it again except for the mere fact that I live in the area the movie is set in. That's the only reason I was interested in it in the first place, and it left nothing to be desired otherwise even after watching it. Could have been worse for a lower production movie though.",1348963200,,389,4.2

YEAH the army trail/munger rd sign we had to lasso that thing down.  those things where total P**sy magnents.  ""owwwww youve been to munger rd"".  ""yeah baby (in bruce campbell voice) we own it"" then give sign to girl.  fortunatly for us the statute of limitations is up on that.  but also we used to hide in the woods and run out at the idiots parking by the tracks and scare them into driving off.  i actually didn't make it all the way through the movie fell asleep at a friends but looks like the dude who made it burnt it on his own computer, it was a freaking dvd-r.  jeez why didn't they go door to door in Wayne and get some loot off the rich dudes there to get the dvd's produced.  i don't think they answered the real mystery of munger rd.  WTF happened to the house that was 10 feet from the tracks in 1998 and in 1999 there was no house just demolished.

5182217,1,B008U1ANOY,This 'movie' is a RIP-OFF! The positive reviews are FAKE (look and notice that they only have 1 review listed in their profiles). I've never seen a movie do this before. It builds VERY slowly to a supposed 'finale' and suddenly says 'TO BE CONTINUED'! This thing was clearly created to rip people off. It doesn't even show all of the shots that are in the trailer! Don't give these shameless charlatans your money or we may see a VERY unwelcome trend of 'to be continued' movies! It's an INCREDIBLY SLOW half-movie that these pukes decided to split into 2 movies in order to rip horror fans! SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT THIS CRAP they are pulling!,1348876800,4,641,4.5344827586206895

I thought we'd already seen all the decent horror movies out there but I was pleasantly proven wrong.  The movie was ""real"" enough that you both believed and cared about the characters. Plus, the juxtaposition of the teen storyline and the cop storyline kept both from feeling too tedious.  Yes, the TBC at the end was pretty ridiculous, but I really did like the open ending--it added a new creepy factor that it's hard for movies to pull off!  It's enjoyably slow with a nice build-up, and not too much ridiculous gore or stupid, unbelievable actions from cardboard characters.  I really liked this movie and I recommend it if you're looking for something a little scary and entertaining.",1347667200,4,879,4.718954248366013

Munger Road did a great job capturing the beauty (and creepiness, lol) of St. Charles and I was pretty scared in parts. Scary like the first and best ""Halloween"" movie! The ending was a tad lame but all in all I would recommend it.
Ideas to include in the sequel: South Cemetery on 7th Avenue, out West by Garfield Farm, the now closed Hideaway Restaurant and any part of Valley View!",1347580800,6,585,4.376146788990826
5182222,2,B008U1ANOY,"Bland, boring, slow storyline. Slow. Slow.

The dialogue brings a lot to be desired. Davison salvages his portion of the movie with a believable delivery and a very genuine portrayal of the character. The teens are painful... thats all I really need to say. The acting is grueling to deal with at some ... well, most points.
 With the exception of Bruce Davison, the acting gets a C-.

The movie tries to cram so much set up into its hour and a half run time, that (I'm not exaggerating) NOTHING happens for 45 minutes.

The actualactual appearance of the movie is good. Professional and high quality.

Honestly, seems like this movie was written almost to appeal to St. Charles townies. Its almost a reference a minute to things specific to St Charles (store names, businesses, hang out spots. ""Pratt woods forest preserve? the one right off Munger Road?""...  ugh). I don't see it having a wide appeal outside of the immediate ""Munger road region"".

I'd say the movie is a forced attempt at Halloween and Blair Witch. Not a good mix.

For a horror fan (and my taste spans all types of horror), Ill say go watch some actual horror movies before trying to write one. Do your homework, study some of the greats. Study their writing, study the visuals.

Plus, if you're gonna make us sit through 45 minutes of almost nothing, don't skimp on the gore. I mean, there was NONE. Its implied, but nonexistent.
I'd say save yourself the 20 bucks on the movie. I'll bet it'll end up on the 5 dollar rack at your local department store, in one those 8 movie packs in the dump bins at a Wal Mart (or similar store) or if they're lucky on Redbox. So you're likely to find it cheaper.",1347494400,4,1670,4.503311258278146
5182223,5,B008U1ANOY,"My entirely biased opinion: I dig the movie a lot, though I did help make it (I'm the Production Designer).

I think it's a great movie for people who dig old school thrillers like Halloween, and who don't need a bunch of torture porn or gore to enjoy a scary movie. It's got a great sense of atmosphere, pacing, and intrigue, and all without the trappings of a multi-million dollar budget. I watched the premiere at the first midnight screening in St. Charles, and the vibe in the room was incredible.

Munger Road makes great use of local legends in the towns of Barlet/St. Charles/Geneva in Illinois, and employs some great old-school tricks to make up for it's very modest budget. I had a lot of fun turning this sleepy little suburb into the set piece for a deranged killer, and I'm really happy with the results.",1347321600,,818,4.557823129251701
5182224,2,B008U1ANOY,"Hmmm...7 glowing reviews about the DVD, all posted within 3 days of its release, all by people who've never posted an Amazon review before. Suspicious? I think so. Here's the truth from someone who's NOT affiliated with the movie: it's a competently made film with pretty good acting, especially Bruce Davison as the sheriff, but while it's admirable in its attempt at an old school ""slow burning"" horror movie, it's very slow and way too tame (even for PG-13). The worst part, however, is the ending, which resolves nothing and pompously assumes we want to see a sequel.",1347321600,12,571,4.836734693877551

8530385,1,B008U1ANOY,Interesting how you can diagnose an electrical issue by squeezing A/C lines.  FYI:  If you don't have cell service...walk down the friggin' road a bit.  These characters act as though they're aware they're in a horror movie.  Just because the equipment needed to make movies is so easily attainable doesn't mean every moron should make one.,1529539200,,340,5.017857142857143
8530386,3,B008U1ANOY,"This would have been a pretty good story if they would have either ended it or had a follow-up film. It appears that this film was made some time ago and no follow-up film was made to conclude it.
 My theory is that Cory, fueled by the urban legend, went crazy and killed the two friends but couldn't bring himself to kill his girlfriend. There.....lame as it is, you have an ending.",1525910400,,383,4.319444444444445
8530387,1,B008U1ANOY,"This movie sucks beyond sucking, it's piece of complete crap, don't even waste your time, they quit writing the script mid way through and say to be continued and they never make another movie or anything.",1524182400,,205,4.722222222222222
8530388,5,B008U1ANOY,"Honestly didn't buy this movie on Amazon. I owe it on DVD and bought it from the cafe the characters were at in this movie. That being said, I grew up for 16 years in St. Charles, Illinois and I love just seeing people talk about our town on Amazon. I really enjoyed the movie and(yes Munger Road is creepy at night and yes people still drive on it to see if it's haunted), if you ever have the chance go to the Scarecrow festival in St.charles it's loads of fun!",1523750400,,463,4.0989010989010985
8530389,1,B008U1ANOY,To be continued............really! What was the whole purposes of the tunnel scene when the cop had to break through the wall to get to the farm house which means the killer didn't use it so why have it in the movie to begin with...oh to waste time and make the movie longer!,1521158400,2,275,4.3076923076923075
8530390,3,B008U1ANOY,"There are a lot of other reviews here, so I'll keep this brief...

Acting was pretty good.  The ambient music certainly added to the suspense...  and the movie as a whole was pretty suspenseful...

That said, while the camera work was generally good, this movie once again goes with a ""let's shoot 1/2 the movie pitch black so nobody can see anything"" concept...  and let's use a billion cliche techniques to try to get jump scares ( some of them were ok, but most were like ""duh, didn't see that coming"" )...

And...  once again, EVERYONE in the movie has the IQ of a hamster ( police included ).  These guys take the ""We need to stick together.  So, I'll go by myself down the road 10 miles to get help."" concept to the extreme...  Even the police did the dumbest things...  ""Ok, let's split up...  and make sure you turn off your radio...  and don't use your flashlight...""  Where in the world is that in the police manual???

Any case...  yeah, the movie is suspenseful...  but I really just wish some horrors actually used lighting...  and maybe, just maybe, wrote in some characters who have brains...",1520553600,,1107,4.532994923857868
8530391,1,B008U1ANOY,"Enormous waste of time, everyone involved should be embarrassed.  Don't watch it, it's not a complete movie.  I might have been a little more charitable in my evaluation had I not invested so much of my time to watch PART of a story.  There was no indication beforehand that this was incomplete.  It wasn't that good to begin with, but the lack of an ending erases anything positive I might have thought or said about this.  A rotten experience on every level.",1519257600,,460,4.560975609756097
8530392,5,B008U1ANOY,Pretty good scary movie. Underrated.,1506643200,,36,6.4
8530393,2,B008U1ANOY,"Gosh, could have been so much better. Super-lame 'ending,' it does not conclude, it 100% says, ""Yup, we are hot. This is gonna be a huge hit. We have arrived.""  No sequel in 6 years!",1473120000,,182,4.2
