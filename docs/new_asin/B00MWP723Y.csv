6602970,5,B00MWP723Y,Haven't seen it yet but was at the Disorderly Conduct show in Perth Australia. He clearly stated the that it was going to be part of a documentary from the world tour. It's not one of his normal specials.  Clearly some people need a life. Personally I can't wait to watch it because I haven't laughed as hard as I did at the show for a long time.  It was awesome.,1416182400,4,363,4.098591549295775

6602972,5,B00MWP723Y,"Best dvd ever! I saw this on comedy channel, and laughed so hard, I had tears in my eyes, I may buy 2 one for me , one for my sister. Those that don't like it don't have a sense of humor",1416182400,7,186,3.4523809523809526
6602973,2,B00MWP723Y,"I own every Jeff Dunham DVD and I really like all but one which was just okay. But this is really BAD. This is chopped up pieces of his world tour, a joke from this country and a joke from that country. You will not see all of his usual characters and the ones that do perform will not perform in every country during the DVD. Jeff is truly just taking his fans to cleaners with this project. He should have picked one country and filmed the whole show. Please also notice that most of these other reviews were written by people who did not see the dvd yet. They are writing about how much they love Jeff Dunham not this DVD. Jeff is great but this DVD is terrible, save your money.",1416182400,33,682,4.135338345864661

6603014,2,B00MWP723Y,It would have been interesting to see the full show from each country but of course that would have made for a long dvd. So I didn't really mind the format of just having clips from the shows he did in each country. The reason for my two star rating is that I didn't really find this humorous at all. Achmed and Peanut are usually the funniest for me but in this dvd their parts were just blah. It's like Jeff couldn't come up with any funny material or maybe he felt stifled by the different cultures. I don't think I even laughed once. And is it just me or do all his characters voices sound almost the same in this dvd? Usually they're very distinct and you can tell without looking which character is speaking. This dvd is definitely not one I'll watch again.,1487376000,,763,4.268965517241379

6603099,5,B00MWP723Y,"Jeff Dunham world tour special All Over The Map I watch with an open mind based on what people said about the product.  For me personally I found his special to be enjoyable, lots of good facts about all the places the tour took place.  I also found all the characters were very funny in all the countries even when the rules were very strict about certain things said on stage.  The DVD does give you a choice of bleep and unbleep so for those like myself and my family we enjoy the uncensored version of all his specials. Which of course fully uncensored specials is five out of seven specials which I now own this one.  I normally do give away any spoilers about DVD'S but those with families, the unbleep version has walter dropping alot of F words on stage during the preformance.  But like said before the special is actually very good if you watch with an open mind and enjoy all the extra's of how they flim it which is what alot of people complain about.  I didn't find it to be an issue at all with the special still funny and made me almost cry from laughing so hard rib cage still hurts today.",1455580800,,1105,4.2631578947368425

The plastic seal was just laying over top the movie. For almost $20 I thought I bought this brand new! Very disappointed.  Plus as we watched it everything is beeped out, that is not what I paid for! I have watched the show on TV and loved it as far as that goes. But couldn't really understand second time around since you heard a loud beep ever 5 mins.",1447459200,,514,4.089108910891089

6603135,4,B00MWP723Y,"This is nothing like most of the other DVDs.  (I say most because I do own the Jeff Dunham Show on DVD.)  This is 12 shows in 12 different countries chopped up and then sewn together for one DVD.  You get Jeff on stage in other countries with Walter, Peanut, and Bubba J.  Achmed is allowed on all stages except one.  That's right folks, one country tells Jeff to sideline Achmed.  They even tell Jeff that he can not say the name Achmed.  What Jeff does about this is classic!  Anyway...overall this was an awesome DVD.  You get some great moments in all 11 countries (the 12th country is USA, and all we get is Jeff jumping off the stage) and some jokes that are related to that specific country.  One surprising moment occurred too...a marriage proposal!  I enjoyed this DVD very much.",1447113600,,788,4.440559440559441

6603203,5,B00MWP723Y,Jeff Dunham is the best ventriloquist I've ever see. I never accepted Edgar Bergen as a true ventriloquist because he always moved his lips when his characters were speaking. Jeff has the stage-presence of the best of the stand-up comedian. An hour watching the hilarious exchanges with Jeff and four or five of his characters is well worth the time and money you will spend. I recommend any of Jeff's DVD without reservation.,1434326400,,426,4.8493150684931505

6603213,4,B00MWP723Y,"This is better than his Halloween special from a few years back, but not as good as his ""Showtime"" Specials.  The reason is the editing of trying to squeeze 29 cities into a 90 minute DVD.

No topic is sacred: Beards in Israel, the Kandura in Arab countries, drinking in the British Isles. I especially liked the ad lib in Malaysia when they were told Achmed could not take the stage or even be mentioned during the act. Who knew he had a French cousin?",1431302400,,586,4.518867924528302

We get to see all 5 characters in each country.

Cons:
It's a tour, which means it's not a full show. We only see bits and pieces of each act.
Maybe it's just me, or maybe it's the parts of the act that they chose to put in, but i felt like the act lost it's touch towards the end.

6603329,4,B00MWP723Y,"Jeff Dunham's newest vid is a bit of a let down compared to his other releases;my favoruite being Spark of Insanity. It is less about one straight routine  this time,although goodness knows there are many different ones. We are shown  back stage and in front as Jeff traverses the globe in search of fun and laughter with his sidekick dummies. In is interesting to see Jeff entertaining folks in such diverse countries as Abu Dhabi,Israel,Malaysia,Iceland,The British isles,etc. They all laugh at the same jokes we do here,although the Malaysian visit was just a  bit tricky. They wouldn't allow Jeff to perform with Achmed. He was too culturally incorrect. So Jeff,not to be deterred,performed with Jacque the Terrorist instead. Just Achmed with a beret! Well,he lived to tell about it,and you see it all unfold here. And speaking of Achmed. Ever want to know what kind of reaction Achmed gets in the Muslim world? Take a looky. It is educational.
Technically the DVD is in w/s format of 1:85:1,and is clear and crisp. Extras include some behind the scenes goings on on his tour.
All in all this isn't as strong as his others...it's just different. It is not a whole 90 minutes of Jeff and his dummies. It is a look at his world tour and his playing to other audiences/cultures. It is certainly interesting to see how much Jeff will push the envelope. Besides his obvious gifts as a ventriloquist,Jeff is an extremely talent individual in many other ways.

6603354,3,B00MWP723Y,I know it is difficult making a DVD with short clips of different shows all over the world - but is Jeff Dunham maybe becoming a bit too relaxed ?,1421020800,,146,3.9

6603399,3,B00MWP723Y,Jeff's other DVD's were better than this one. It was hard to follow the countries he visited and the clips from those shows were short and choppy.

6603407,3,B00MWP723Y,this is a ok movie. this is not one of jeff's best specials. it is funny but not as funny as it could be. I really hate to give this a 3 star. but it's ok. it's not a full stand up special he is just showing you the funniest bits from each country on this tour. it was ok I will still probably buy it for my collection. so basically 3 for the dvd and 5 for jeff. if you have not seen this then I recommend you do. it is funny so I still recommend you see it.,1419811200,,458,3.59

6603409,3,B00MWP723Y,Jeff Dunham is my favorite comedian however this was not anywhere close to what was expected.  The comedy was great when you got to see it.  The best I could tell it was only partial segments of the shows and this was very disappointing.  I would not recommend this to anyone.,1419724800,,276,4.372549019607843

6603414,1,B00MWP723Y,I love Jeff & his characters. This DVD follows him around the world. The problem I guess is the language barrier. He is limited in what he can do in these places. I could not even watch the whole DVD. It just wasn't his usual funny stuff. Sorry.,1419724800,,245,4.125

6603423,4,B00MWP723Y,"If you're expecting his usual, one location-only specials, then you're s*** out of luck. This special is not for the domestic US audience, but for the international fans who managed to catch him on this tour before his Vegas residency.

I attended one of those shows, so I was excited to see this finally come out. I didn't mind the highlights-only format from each stop as they were still pretty funny to me. Don't get me started on how I feel about the people who didn't like this one because it felt too fragmented for their taste.

Only 4 stars because the camera work on some of the shows could stand to be better, and for the lack of Jose in the final product.",1419552000,,666,4.362903225806452

6603445,5,B00MWP723Y,A great video with great laughs from many different countries. My favorite parts were with Walter in the UAE and Achmed in Israel. I was kind of dissapointed that my laughs had to end when the video did.,1419120000,,203,4.368421052631579

6603449,3,B00MWP723Y,I own all the Jeff Dunham I can find including his television show. Although his humor is fantastic the set up on this one did not meet my expectations. If he had just done one show overseas I would have enjoyed it more. However I will still watch all his stuff.,1419033600,,262,4.1568627450980395

6603456,3,B00MWP723Y,"I have seen many of Jeff Dunham's DVDs and in-person, but for some reason this one was a little disappointing to me. I believe the main reason was the different types of cultures he had to deal with and the fact that he was limited to certain views, and comments he could and could not make throughout the show. Jeff even stated that prior to one show that anything relating to pork would get him in trouble because of the countries culture. These restrictions made it quite difficult for him to give an ""all out"" concert. This is why I gave him 3stars.",1418947200,,553,4.378640776699029
6603457,5,B00MWP723Y,"We really enjoyed the Jeff Dunham: All Over the Map.  We watch his shows whenever he is on.  He is the best ventriloquist I have seen in quite awhile.

6603472,2,B00MWP723Y,"Very disappointing.  This is mostly an itinerary of Jeff and his trip around the world.  If you are expecting to see a lot of Peanut, Achmed and the rest of the gang, forget it.  When you do see them, it's pretty much the same old stuff, juts in cameo roles.  No really new material except that based on the local region he happens to be in and then because we are unfamiliar with it, well it gets lost.  Love Jeff, but this was a real let down.",1418601600,,445,4.068965517241379

This one is SO funny and of course my favorite is Achmed the Dead Terrorist! The fact that Achmed is a huge hit in Dubai says a lot for the character and also people in general, we all love a good laugh.

We own all his other shows (including the short run TV series), but after this one we will not buy them when they first come out. We will probably rent them first.

To say the least, I am a fan!  I admire his talent and his ability to focus the audience on Walter, Achmed, Peanut and his other characters, making them the real actors on stage.  I pre-ordered ""All Over The Map.""  I am very disappointed after watching the entire disc, including the short list of special features.  The high-point of the disc was his workaround of censorship of the appearance or mention of Achmed in Malaysia.  My disappointment comes from the lack of an entire show at the end of the five-continent trip chronicled through very short segments at each city visited.  When he reached Hawaii as his last stop, the show that he performed there would have been the perfect show to include in its entirety to tie together all the pieces from England, Ireland, Abu Dhabi and elsewhere on the trip.  We'll never know because when Jeff reaches Hawaii the credits over him shaking hands with audience members.  While an entertaining travelogue, not a Jeff Dunham DVD of the quality of ""Controlled Chaos"" or ""very special Christmas Special,"" and why it gets my one star rating.",1417046400,11,1238,4.747663551401869

But I must state how very disappointed I was in this All Over the Map DVD.  First of all the video qualtiy was ""horrible"", it looked like some kid recorded it with his own camera.  Second,  where the heck was Peanut in this entire video?  All total I think he might have had 7 minutes of performance, if even that.  The editing also was not very well, just quick short clips and on to the next country.  I was so looking forward to watching this DVD since I preordered it.

(since it will probably be a while until his next one now he's on contract working in vegas).

Anyway, I couldn't wait to see the full special (since Comedy Central always butchers them for TV) And while cool to see jeff go all over the world (especially UAE and Malaysia)and also that it's undeniable that this definitely has it's funny moments....I have to say it was a slight disappointment overall. I mean I recently re-watched his first 2 specials after not seeing them in a while and they still had me laughing my ass off multiple times whereas with this, there are good laughs but still not quite in the side-splitting/hard to breath/crack-up every time I think about it kind of way his past specials have got me.

I get he has some different jokes for different regions/countries but I honestly think they should have filmed a full special in one place and then maybe thrown in the clips of him in different countries in between.",1417046400,,1169,4.509433962264151

6603533,2,B00MWP723Y,"Frankly, I feel gypped.  My husband and I are both great fans of Jeff Dunham and have all his DVDs and have been to 2 live shows.  Having said that, however, this DVD was not what we thought it would be.  Silly us - we thought it would be a stand-up comedy DVD!  Instead it was like watching a never-ending Bonus Feature.  It was clips of Jeff talking about his tour, interspersed with short pieces of his stand-up routine that addressed the locale where he was performing.  In other words, the only stand-up you'll find on this DVD are the bits that he does for ""cheap props"" regarding where he currently is and the audience in front of him. WE NEVER GET TO SEE HIS WHOLE ROUTINE or even anything besides the very specific jokes aimed at the different cities he went to.  Oh, you also get to see a lot of audience shots, probably to help you understand some of the locale-specific jokes he's making.

To give you an idea of how I felt, half-way through I turned to my husband and said, ""This is getting boring. Can we just skip to the Main Feature, please?""  He replied, ""This is it.""  Oh, crap!

Unless you find it cheap and used somewhere (and there will probably be a flood of copies from disappointed viewers that bought this thing new) I'd say skip it.",1416787200,,1258,4.356223175965665

6603539,5,B00MWP723Y,"I knew going into this that it wasn't going to be a full routine, but the price of the DVD at the time of preordering it was lower than any of this other DVDs. The good thing about it is that since this is a sort of ""best of"" compilation there aren't many slow moments that there are with his other DVDs, such as the ""Sweet Daddy"" bit from ""Arguing With Myself"" and ""Marvin the Superhero"". Something which isn't mentioned, at least by the time I post this review is that the runtime is 83 minutes, or about twice the material shown on the Comedy Central showing.

All in all it's a funny DVD. Sure it's not a full routine, and it is obvious he is reading from notes sometimes, but considering all the places he went, and all the different routines he did in a short time, I wouldn't doubt he needed it to keep all his facts straight.

EDIT: After I watched it on my DVD player, I brought it to my parents and played it with their DVD player and there is indeed an option for censored and uncensored. This option appears before the disk menu.",1416614400,14,1041,4.226130653266332

6603543,4,B00MWP723Y,I love Jeff Dunham and I'm glad he chose to take his act to different country's it is nice to see how other cultures respond to his comedy. The only thing about this that was disappointing was that it wasn't a complete comedy show. It was bits and pieces so your never sure what you might have missed.,1416528000,,301,4.206896551724138
6603544,5,B00MWP723Y,"We'd been waiting for this for about 6 months. We'd seen him in Hawaii and we were hoping it would be on his next video. It was just at the end of the movie, when he's back in the States and going on stage, but we're thrilled we were there when that part was filmed (the show was great, of course).

This is different from a regular full-show approach. It's bits from different shows in different countries, but it shows the local flavor and improv in each. And it shows locals in the streets and wherever else they may be.

It's definitely one to watch for the variety. Quite the talented guy!",1416528000,5,594,4.294642857142857
6603545,2,B00MWP723Y,Didn't enjoy it all--would have been better labeled as a documentary and even then boring.......Wish at least we could have seen the whole show for the last stop on the DVD Joint base Pearl Harbor/Hickam,1416528000,,203,4.828571428571428

6603547,2,B00MWP723Y,"Disappointing. Even moreso considering became an unabashed Jeff Dunham fan the first time I caught his act more than twenty five years ago at Froggy Bottoms Comedy Club in Lubbock, TX. Oh, Jeff is just as funny as ever but this isn't a full show. Rather, it's more of a tour documentary laced with clips from the shows. Even the ""extras"" are mostly fleshed-out clips from the main program. This would have worked GREAT as a special feature add-on to a show, but as a main program it falls flat. I wish I had watched it on TV rather than popping twenty bucks on the Blu-Ray.",1416441600,24,573,4.415094339622642

6603550,4,B00MWP723Y,"This show is entertaining and even educational.  The background clips from around the world are beautiful, and it shows that every nation's people can have a sense of humor without taking offense.  His reaction to not being able to have Achmed in Malaysia was heartfelt because he was thinking about his fans.  The fact that he modified his character so that they could still enjoy him was priceless.  It is not a full routine so don't expect that but instead enjoy the different cultures and people.",1416355200,11,500,4.77906976744186

6603554,4,B00MWP723Y,"People, know what you are buying. Those expecting a full routine should not buy this, and I was not EXPECTING a full routine, as the promotions for this special never said it would be. This video does a great job of highlighting the culture of the various places that he visited, and Jeff did a great job of turning that culture into something humorous for his audience, just like he does when he tours in America. The difference is, we got to watch, and I not only laughed a lot, but I learned a lot too. Jeff is a master at adapting to his audience, and nowhere is that more evident than his performances in Abu Dhabi, Tel Aviv, and especially Kuala Lumpur. I enjoyed this, and those that aren't expecting just a cut and dry full routine will enjoy it too.",1416268800,33,758,4.345070422535211
