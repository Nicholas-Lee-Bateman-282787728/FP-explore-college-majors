Many secrets are reveal in these final episodes leding us thinking,why didn't I think of that?I was amaze by the way they organized the story. I have to say that my favorite part was when the serie take us again to the beggining where all really started making the story take a new sence. You don't want to miss what really happened to Tenchi and his friends at the end of the story,now do you?I totally recomend this one to you.",985651200,3,555,4.295238095238095
1407636,5,B000059LGP,"Although those favoring the Ova series might not be happy with this light ending, it concisely wraps up the Universe series and leaves a window open for future installments.  The basic plot of the final 4 episodes entails confessions and realizations of some of the main charachters, the apparent death of one, and the defeat of intergalatic evil. The dvd gets 5 stars for its keeping in line with the Tenchi genre.",984873600,3,415,4.763888888888889

7933762,5,B000059LGP,"This is the final entry in the Universe series. Tenchi learns that he is the rightful emperor of Jurai as the fight with Kagato draws near. There is also some heartbreaking drama involving Ryoko and Ayeka. Tenchi takes on Kagato to prove the innocence and claim the title of emperor. This DVD is an amazing climax. When I saw the final episode for the first time I shed a tear or 2. I was an overly emotional 16 year old at the time, but it still tugs at my heart strings a little 13 years later. It's amazing, you can't miss it!",1353024000,,529,4.196078431372549
7933763,5,B000059LGP,"Tenchi and the gang find out the true nature of the evil they face, as Kagato comes for them!  This is not the Kagato from the OVA series, but a Prince of Jurai who has turned to the dark side of the Jurai power.  He was defeated by Yosho and his name erased from history.  Now he returns.  He battles and wounds both Yosho AND Ryoko, kidnaps the Ayeka and escapes, deciding to fight Tenchi at a place and time of his choosing.  He tells Tenchi that he will be waiting for the boy at the Jurai Palace and disappears.
As you can guess there is a good reason why there are four episodes on this DVD.  The ending is complex and very detailed, as the gang battles to get through the layers of defenses around Jurai.  One by one they show their skill and talent as they help Tenchi get closer to the palace.  But one by one they also drop out, either wounded or powerless to go on. Even Nagi and a wounded Ryoko do their best to deliver Tenchi to the palace before they withdraw.
Within the palace the Knights confront two Dark Knights who serve Kagato, which allows Tenchi to slip past and carry out the final showdown with the evil Kagato.  At this point think Samurai epic.
The very last episode is a ending without a ending as many of the characters slowly return back to Earth to be with Tenchi and the last scenes are almost the same scenes we saw at the start of the first episode!
Because this TV series, ""Tenchi Universe"", is so much longer than the OVA, it allows for a lot more character development, more themes and a exciting main plot.  True, being made for TV meant it couldn't be as mature, but I felt it was worth the money.  Now, of course, the DVDs have been collected into sets, many of which you can get used, so make sure to shop around before you give away your hard earned cash!",1087603200,,1797,4.2251461988304095
7933764,5,B000059LGP,"Tenchi Universe ends here, or does it?  During the last few minutes of the last espiode, it seems everyone is coming back to Earth and re-start the ""carnival""  that is Tenchi Muyo!
  Tenchi Defeats the evil ruler of planet Jurai, but not easily.  After the battle, Tenchi goes back to Earth.  Akeya seems downhearted that Tenchi has returned to Earth.  Tenchi and the gang gets help from the Bounty hunter Nagi along with Ken-ohki.  Ryoko takes Tenchi to the palace of Jurai, but it seems the Ryoko was badly hurt when she was attacked by Kagato.  A great ending!",1035417600,,563,4.606060606060606
7933765,5,B000059LGP,"These last four episodes have some sad scenes.... Anyway, I don't want to ruin any part of the ending sinces it's a nice ending.  Unfortunately, the ending isn't ""complete"".  You'll know what I mean when you watch it.  Tenchi is a very good show and all anime fans should see it.",1032998400,,279,4.431372549019608
7933766,5,B000059LGP,"Although Tenchi Universe was not as well done as Tenchi Muyo! it has the best two episodes of any Tenchi series, ever. And those two episodes just happen to be on this fantastic DVD.
The best one is the final episode of the Tenchi Universe series, 'No Need For a Conclusion.' This is basically all a flashback episode, with Tenchi thinking back to what happened after the battle with Kagato. We learn what has happened to every single character within the first fifteen minutes of this episode... except for one. The whole thing with the snapshot-like scenes is really well and gets the point across further, and then the end of the episode is just incredible.
The second best episode is 'No Need For Ryoko,' episode #24. This episode is quite emotional, and really focuses on Ryoko the most, although the main point of the episode is that Tenchi decides to go save Ayeka, and initially all of the people of Juraian Royal Family lineage. Most of the other characters take a backseat to Ryoko and Tenchi during this episode, even though nagi has more of a role that matters very much to the storyline in this episode than in the previous episodes. The end of this episode is such a cliffhanger, and will leave you hanging by a thread that is not picked up by the next episode, either.
Overall, this is just the best DVD of the Tenchi Universe series. If you are going to buy only one DVD of Tenchi Universe (and why you would buy only one Tenchi Universe DVD is beyond me) this is the one you should purchase. It is surely worth the price tag on it.",1014854400,,1548,4.4734982332155475
7933767,5,B000059LGP,"Tenchi Universe proves that a series can do justice to the original OAV. The end episodes are so beautiful, you want to cry and watch them over and over again. The conclusion will bring closure to your heart as you can imagine what will happen.",998006400,,244,4.444444444444445
7933768,5,B000059LGP,"This Tenchi Universe Dvd has 4 episodes and all of them are excellent, the first No need for Karma explains about the villian's past, the person whose had Jurian forces chase after Tenchi and his friends, then the next three episodes involve a desperate struggle, against him, the last episode however is very interesting and leaves you off in perfect condition to start a Tenchi in Tokyo DVD Collection, you may not enjoy those as much as you did the Tenchi Universe, but they will keep up with your hunger for the Tenchi Series.  This DVD is a must buy, so buy it now!",988848000,,570,4.480769230769231
