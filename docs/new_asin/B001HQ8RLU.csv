3643474,4,B001HQ8RLU,This piece gives a personal view of the story of the US / Fermi race to beat the LHC and tanking budgets.  It is surprisingly up to date given the inclusion of the 2008 LHC start.  The length of film is just right so as to be complete and develop character but not drawn out.,1316476800,3,275,3.981818181818182
3643475,4,B001HQ8RLU,"This documentary is mostly about the physicists, not the physics, of high energy particle research and how the US government has devalued this research. Since this level of physics requires federal funds, it of course has a political element. (In the interest of balance, maybe the producers should have found some conservative physicists to argue why their research is not of sufficient economic value and government investment in their life's work has been a waste.) The Fermilab budget is continually undercut and the United States' position as a world leader in research, as in so many other areas, continues to erode. Infrastructure has never been a politically exciting talking point, and infrastructure for the future is even less so. It's not morning in America for science.",1300752000,10,782,5.214285714285714
3643476,3,B001HQ8RLU,"""Atom Smashers"" attempts to make a difficult scientific topic interesting to a general audience, with only partial success.

The documentary portrays the effort of scientists at Fermilab, near Chicago, to find the ""Higgs boson,"" an atom-like particle that many theorists believe must exist, but no one has actually found. Some describe it as key to understanding life itself.

The strength of the film lies in its portrayal of the scientists -- dedicated, passionate people who are unashamed nerds (they write songs using terms from the Unix programming language, for instance). They're likeable folks and they are committed to finding the Higgs boson, though not very good at explaining what it is.

As a viewer, you want to get caught up in this quest, but the film does a poor job of explaining the scientists' efforts. We see researchers planning experiments and we're shown various charts and diagrams, but too little effort is made to explain them. It seems like the filmmakers gave in too easily to the idea that particle physics is really complicated and difficult to understand, so why bother trying.

The other weak point in the film is a clunky section in the middle in which the scientists whine about dwindling government funding for their program. It was like a PBS fundraising drive suddenly interrupting an otherwise engaging drama.",1276214400,6,1348,5.085972850678733
3643477,2,B001HQ8RLU,"Like some other reviewers I was similarly disappointed with the outcome of this particular production. In its defense, the program's title is The Atom Smashers, thus suggesting a concentration on the scientists rather than on the science. However, the program covers a broader spectrum of issues, and, unfortunately, does not tackle them systematically, thereby leaving the viewer uneasy. This aspect could so easily have been solved by dividing the program into distinct chapters: i) the historical background to this species of nuclear physics, ii) the historical role of Fermilab, iii) the current work at Fermilab through the eyes of the current scientific community, iv) the funding crisis, and a scientific (rather than subjective) justification of continued Governmental subsidy, v) thoughts on the future of subatomic particle physics and the work at CERN.

The lack of structural backbone to the presentation is not alleviated by some scientists' constant use of the colloquial. Ben Kilminster is doubtless a fine particle physicist: he is, nonetheless, a poor communicator in the televisual medium, hampered by a lack of ability to express himself cogently and eloquently. In an attempt to portray him as a figure relevant to youth, with examples of his prowess on roller-skates and in the arena of modern popular music, the program directors do not allow him to come across as a razor-sharp champion of the cause. Similarly, the overly-familiar linguistic expression of Robin Erbacher cancels out what surely ought to be a public conception of advanced science conducted by erudite and inspiring people. The program's public is not dumb; their expectations need to be raised up, not patronized. One also assumes that science at this level is hard and difficult, so scientists' pointing this out will possibly engender more animosity than empathy. They are, after all, doing a job for which they are paid.

While some of the other interviewees speak more formally (and, by extension, more convincingly), the force of their arguments is undermined by the general detraction imposed by the program's unnecessary dwelling on dull aspects of private lives. I am sure all the interviewees are very nice people with decent moral fiber, and so forth, beset by the vicissitudes of the human condition (as are we all!), but this does not make for absorbing scientific interaction between scientists and the general public. When we hear from the great mind of Leon Lederman, a brilliant and attractive ambassador in the field, the program fails to bolster him sufficiently so that even he comes across with an air of resignation. This may well be an authentic representation, but it serves to support what other reviewers have observed, namely that the program appears as an account of a spineless grieving for evaporating funds. Where is the scientists' spoil for the fight? Perhaps there is one, but we would not know it having watched this program.  The understandable (emotive) question of why tens of millions of US dollars are not redirected towards cancer research is a hugely potent one in the public's perception of such Government schemes. However, the message that we, as cave dwellers of the 21st-century must continue to venture out and discover our genesis, rather than to retreat, fails to be tackled comprehensively enough in this program. Its communication of a sense of apathy brings to mind the controversial cancellation in the USA of the  Superconducting Super Collider at Waxahachie in the early 90s, a skeleton now only resurrected in the popular culture of the West Wing, (and that done brilliantly, of course). For most people it remains forgotten.

On an ironic tangent of the funding question, one witnesses the provision of several cases of champagne to celebrate a milestone of the Fermilab's success. If it was paid for by the Federal Government then  here is a missed opportunity for a point of gratitude to be made: a thank you for the taxpayers' money seen as going towards the joy as well as the grit of such a project would have been appropriate.

Finally, a comment about the definition of a Higgs boson in this program. While some of the interviewees coyly play with the notion that this hypothetical mechanism is as impossible to define as it is, apparently, to discover, a metaphorical description could be addressed in a matter of minutes (Lederman's wonderful teaching style comes closest here.) Given that the Higgs is a major aspect of the program's focus it seems ridiculous that more time is not allocated to the science behind the definition. Yes, the mathematical complexity behind physics at this level is daunting for many, if not most. Nonetheless, it must be possible to delineate the subject in a way which takes as its starting point people's intelligence not their lack of it. Stephen Hawking, Richard Feynman and Leon Lederman all succeeded, at various points in their lives, to open up the minds of those for whom particle physics is traditionally a forbidding area of scientific concept, observation, theory and experiment. To say that science needs to be more `sexy' is a horrible indictment of the minds of young people. Children do not need the teaching of science to be more sexy: they need it to be taught with a charismatic conviction setting the highest intellectual goals, and underscoring a purpose far beyond the realm of the roller-skate and the rock band.",1266796800,11,5424,5.108229988726043
3643478,2,B001HQ8RLU,"i agree, its not really a scientific documentary or anything... it just shows you a little bit about the people who are working on the most amazing things ever.  it doesnt really talk about the actual amazing things, which i found to be extremely dissapointing.  not sure who this is really aimed at, its not good enough 'reality tv' for your wife to like it, and it doesnt have any science in it for a 'techie guy' to like it... so really... its like its made for a high school science class or something.",1266278400,6,506,4.372340425531915
3643479,3,B001HQ8RLU,"It mostly puts a human face to the scientists looking for the ""God Particle"", Higgs Bosom. It really doesn't get much into the science itself. Now that CERN is scheduled a new experiment in Feb 2010 maybe they can find it since Fermilab is now pretty much gone.",1262390400,4,261,4.458333333333333
3643480,4,B001HQ8RLU,"I enjoyed this documentary. I watch a lot of science related programming, so this was okay for me.

It would be good if more people realized how much damage the Bush Administration has done to the sciences, but this probably will not happen. Many Americans just do not have an interest in science. As a country, we are on the way down.  Our lead role in the World is rapidly becoming a thing of the past. Our next supercollider was shelved years ago due to politics. Meanwhile, the rest of the World moves ahead, and other countries are now becoming the leaders.  Beating on our chests and saying ""America is the best"" is not enough.  We actually have to do something to stay the best.

I am a software engineer, and there seem to be fewer and fewer American people that understand anything anymore. Much of our high-tech work is routinely farmed out overseas.

That whimpering sound you hear in your ears is the noise a country makes when it is in decline.",1262304000,4,957,4.502890173410405

8309338,2,B001HQ8RLU,"The program falls in the trap of doing sound bite presentation. This is the best way to fluff up a presentation without having to follow a train of thought.

They could have stuck with one presenter or narrator until they were finished instead of a hodgepodge of bits and pieces.

Unfortunately due to politics the Fermilab replacement in Waxahachie, Texas, known as The Superconducting Super Collider (SSC), nicknamed the Desertron, was never completed and is not mentioned in this presentation. However it is in the extras.

They do mention The Large Hadron Collider (LHC,) CERN. Then the true nature of the presentation comes out as a complaint about the U.S. not funding partial physics research.

Most of the presentation is dumbed-down to the point that it is excruciation to watch. You might give the fast forward button a thought.",1390262400,,838,5.0071942446043165

The Read Shift readings, can be explained as, compound gravitational lensing of photons.

This is the story of how we kept science busy for two decades.
Two axis showed up at CERN.
One is going to be in alignment with the Magnet field = perpendicular to Volt movement.
The other is going to be in alignment with the Geofield of the Earth.

Higgs Boson is an induced field, where the Sun excites the metals in the earth to produce their own field.

I figured this out on my own.

8309341,5,B001HQ8RLU,Very enjoyable movie about folks who up until recently were doing wonderful work.  It is a shame that the US is now out of the particle physics game.,1347753600,,149,4.321428571428571
8309342,2,B001HQ8RLU,"I love watching documentaries about all kinds of topics, but I most enjoy science based documentaries.  I would not even count this as a scientific documentary.  It was more a personal interest story (I don't care if you commute or have kids, tell me about what you are doing to find the higgs!).  It talks about some of the people who worked at fermi, but didn't really go anywhere.  It didn't end with the finding of the higgs boson or the closing of the tevatron, it just ended.  Of course they would still be filming if there was to be any conclusion, but I felt like it was a waste to time to watch.",1345939200,,604,4.2631578947368425
8309343,5,B001HQ8RLU,"Those that want to know why the Higgs particle was discovered in Europe and not America should see this film.

As basic scientific discoveries are shifting outside the US, this film shows how it did in the personal terms of the scientists here that had to see American efforts curtailed due to the politicization of fundamental science and its defunding. The film reflects well the consequences of the disinterest in basic science in the US, and the movement of basic discoveries, and the scientific leadership to make them, to outside of our nation.

This disinterest is also strongly represented in the comments here on Amazon that think that those that want basic science pursued here are doing so with a political ""liberal"" agenda. Nope, the motivation is simply to keep America the leader in science and technology, which, unfortunately due to narrow political interests and the rise of anti-intellectualism, is forcing the US to lose this position.",1341532800,3,954,5.070063694267516
8309344,1,B001HQ8RLU,how would you like some big government propaganda shoved down your throat at near the speed of light? i'm almost convinced the researchers at fermilab would have beaten the LHC to the higgs boson had they not constantly bitched about how terrible america is. it will also be interesting to learn if LHC made its discoveries with energies capable at permilab even with infinite funding.,1341360000,2,385,4.938461538461539
8309345,3,B001HQ8RLU,"Well, the Amazon site- as well as the streaming video recap- have this as ""starring Terrence Howard"".  I figured it was a work of fiction loosely based on real scientific endeavors.  Turns out it's just a documentary and has nothing at all to do with Mr. Howard.  Someone at Amazon made a huge tiny mistake. It's pretty interesting in itself though.  But I just wanted to clarify that this isn't really what it appears to be due to the Amazon error...",1324684800,3,451,4.530864197530864
8309346,3,B001HQ8RLU,"Fermilab officially smashed their last atom with the Tevetron earlier this month (October 2011). The Tevetron is now closed. I am not sure if that will have any impact on peoples view of this movie but it is good to know before watching. While the people in the film complain about funding cuts maybe now viewers like some of the other reviewers can have a little more sympathy for them. It would appear they were afraid of not having their job eventually and that probably struck fear in all of them. As it has with millions of other people from different industries.

The movie does not cover their work in great detail which is what I was hoping for. I wouldn't watch it again but I am not upset about spending time the first time through. If you can watch it for free and have at least a hint of interests and nothing even remotely important you could be doing, then watch it. If you don't meet all of those per-requisites I wouldn't recommend this movie.",1319155200,5,959,4.448863636363637
