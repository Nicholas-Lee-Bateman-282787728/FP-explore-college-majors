The first two season moved fast and furious to a conclusion of sorts, telling the stories of Nikita and Alexandra, along the way. It was brilliant. But this 3rd season plodded and didn't pick up it's pace until the last few episodes. I would recommend you buy Seasons 1,2 and 4. Watching this Season will stop you from ever making it to the fantastic conclusion in Season 4.

4675908,3,B005FISC3Y,"Season three of Nikita takes our heroes off in a new direction, sort of.  They are still trying to take down Division, but this time they are doing it from the inside because they are running it.  It created some interesting stories, but Im still not quite sure it worked as well as the previous two seasons.

The only reason that Division is still up and running is so they can take down the last few rogue agents.  They would prefer to bring them in and help them adjust to a normal life, but they will take any means necessary to do it if they don't cooperate.  After all, the goal is to take down this super secret organization as quickly as possible so our heroes can go on with their lives.

Leading the fight in the field and back at the super secret office is Nikita (Maggie Q) along with fianc Michael (Shane West).  (And just wait until you see how the proposal happens.)  Ryan Fletcher (Noah Bean) is officially running the office and reporting directly to the President.  Still on the computers is Birkhoff (Aaron Stanford), and Alex (Lyndsy Fonseca) is often helping in the field as she also tries to come to grips with her family legacy.  Meanwhile, Amanda (Melinda Clarke) is still out there and working to bring down Nikita any way she can.

The main problem I had with this season is how dark it got.  I know the show has not always been sunny and light  this has been more of a hard action drama.  However, the writers took the characters to some seriously dark places as the season progresses.  I liked how they handled it and the character growth it provided, but I didn't always think it was necessary.  In fact, at times, I felt they went too far just in an attempt to give us another plot twist.  And it's that element that bothered me more than the story they were telling which at times veered toward soap opera.

This does mean that the actors were called on to do more, and they stepped up their game.  No matter how much I was rolling my eyes at the plots the characters were given, I always believed the acting that went with it.

Likewise, the special effects were great when needed, and the action was always top notch.  This is an action show more than anything else, and it works perfectly as that.  Those scenes are fun and adrenaline pumping  what else do you want?

All 22 episodes are available in their native wide screen and full surround in a five disc DVD set and a four disc Blu-Ray set.  Extras include deleted scenes and a gag reel.

I was ambivalent about the show continuing until I saw the season finale.  Thats when I realized how much I still cared for the characters and I wanted to see how things would resolve.  Fortunately, well get six episodes starting late in November of 2013 to wrap things up.  Fans will want to catch up on season three of Nikita before that happens.  Heres hoping the show goes out with a bang like the first two seasons instead of middle of the road like this season.",1434067200,,2945,4.390018484288355

4675944,4,B005FISC3Y,"With Percy dead & the government finally in the know, Division is tasked with tracking down rogue agents & cleaning up their messes with Nikita & the gang at the helm. If they do, everyone is free to go with new identities & a fair amount of money. Unfortunately, things begin to go downhill when Amanda reappears with an obsession with showing Nikita how naive and stupid she is to think she can't be hurt or has nothing to lose.

While the first two seasons are increasingly amazing, the third season is where it derails, hence why the series was cancelled. Seemingly, the vast amount of plotlines & plot twists fit into the first two seasons resulted in the writing staff getting writer's block- at least that's how it appears. The main problem, though, is that the first two seasons were based around an uneasy chase/ thriller theme which made it unique & drew in the fans. With Nikita literally having an army at her back & no longer on the run battling against an enemy that is, the third season looses that & begins to feel pretty similar to a lot of your average cop & spy shows. And, if you've watched seasons 1 & 2, the plot twists (which tend to happen at every act break of every episode) begin to feel pretty predictable.

However, it's not horrible. It takes far longer for the plot to take off, but has a second half just as good, if not better, than the previous two seasons with an excellent finale that sets up the six part series finale (aka season 4). That, and, the writers still do manage to surprise you now and again all season long. If you love the show, though, it's worth watching. But, if you haven't seen it, SERIOUSLY don't start here.",1424131200,,1665,4.437908496732026

4675969,3,B005FISC3Y,"Oh dear! Division has gone all pink and fluffy. Gone is the glitz, the intricate plotting, devious bosses and shady organisations. There's not a Lamborghini or a Ferrari in sight - instead we've got a feeble plot, cringe-worthy corny dialogue, stock SUV's and sensible Nissans while the gaunt, formerly bottom-kicking Nikita totters around on her spindly legs whining about not wanting to kill anyone and losing virtually every ridiculous fight she gets into.

This low budget Division with a conscience makes for remarkably dull viewing on the whole; even the reappearance of a couple of key characters from earlier seasons fails to lift this above mediocre. The narrative is episodic and linear with very little underlying plot to hold it together and far too much soppiness and character development. There are a few surprises along the way but the writing is nowhere near the standard of the excellent former seasons. Even the season finale is a bit flat - do we care? Not really.

It is no surprise, therefore, that season four is the last one and only consists of six episodes; on the evidence of season three I'm amazed it got any funding for another run. Even a three star rating is perhaps on the generous side; most disappointing.",1421539200,,1240,4.9

4676118,5,B005FISC3Y,"Fair warning, this will contain spoilers from season 2 and some spolerish material from season 3, but no major season 3 giveaways.

This season is all about Division vs Amanda.  That is the new Division that was created after Percy was killed and Amanda exiled at the end of season 2.  Melinda Clarke really gets to flex her muscles as a bad guy this season.  She is the main antagonist throughout the season, although the new Division (now headed by the ex CIA analyst Ryan Fletcher) faces threats from Amanda and from inside the government that is allowing them to operate.  More and more of the backstory is being told (including more of Amanda's origins) all leading up the the truncated final season.

Like is the case with the prior seasons, this one begins and ends with the characters in very different circumstances.  There are several twists and turns throughout the season, some which are harder to buy than others.  This is however a show that you have to suspend your disbelief a lot.  If you try to look for logic in everything it will frustrate you to no end.  The season ends on a storyline cliffhanger that threatens all of the main characters, but one above the others.

If you like the format of the previous seasons then you will like this one.  The writing and acting are pretty much on par with the prior seasons, but the writers do seem to want to be a little clever with the twists.  Some work, some not so much.  But all the characters having shades of gray, even among the ""good guys"" continues.

For those who get the discs, the A/V quality of the blu rays is great as you would expect.  As far as extras go, there are some deleted scenes on select episodes and a gag reel.  Definitely less than in prior seasons. That is the one drawback for those who like going through the bonus material, but all in all it is worth getting.",1400544000,,1854,4.470238095238095

So that is the cast of characters who I told you about that plays in this tv series or show. Meet the new division. In a game-changing turnaround, division is now run by nikita, michael and former cia analyst Ryan Fletcher, who has been tasked by the u.s. president to clean up after the regime...or else.

4676459,5,B005FISC3Y,"I've only watched 9 episodes so far, but I like it a lot! It seems to me TV shows have far exceeded non-avant-garde movies in ways (actual dialogue, more reasonably-realistic character interactions, etc.). Here's my breakdown; obviously this is all just opinion, so you're welcome to disagree!

Great: Reasonably realistic dialogues (characters aren't unrealistically romantic, even when you might want them to make up / make out as a viewer). Maggie Q is an awesome action character, and good all-around actor. It's not surprising in retrospect that she was a student of Jackie Chan. The mix of action, suspense/drama, etc. seems good to me -- it's a fun viewing experience.

Good but could be better: The average show environment is good, but not as jaw-dropping as a super-spy-thriller could offer. Shane West (Michael) doesn't come off as a sexist entitled douche, unlike many male leads in the action industry (Andrew Lincoln or Jon Bernthal in The Walking Dead, for example), and can be at times genuine, complicated, and likeable ... which altogether is relieving but not groundbreaking.

Could be improved: The storyline in the first 9 episodes hasn't had as many twists and turns as I would have liked. Despite the loyalty conflicts in or between characters, minor ploys, etc., they have followed the ""hunt down bad division agent X"" format a little much. On the other hand, it's kind-of nice not to see Fletcher become yet-another corrupted leader ... I'm not exactly asking for the ""opposite"" plot-wise. Social dialogue around Michael's transient disability (loss of hand) has been a degree of unsubstantiative so far.

Also: It's really unfortunate Amazon Instant Video doesn't work on my primary Linux desktop (with my 27"" korean IPS) or have native Android apps ... I'm really hoping some time mainstream audio/video content publishing won't be a frustrating user experience. I'm okay with paying a reasonable price for content, I just wish it were easier to access! Blu-ray's no better though, and Unbox on my [dual-boot] Windows laptop works well.",1375056000,,2063,5.149253731343284
4676460,5,B005FISC3Y,"This show has been a good middle ground for me and my wife.  It's action-packed, but the fight scenes are pretty tame.  The story line has been interesting, and the acting is pretty good overall.  Same applies for the first two seasons as well, though season #2 started a little slow and picked up quite a bit in the last few episodes.",1374710400,4,335,4.370967741935484
4676461,4,B005FISC3Y,"I really enjoy watching Nikita!  Sadly, Alex's character seems to be confused about her direction.  This has caused me to lose interest in Nikita.  It would be better with just Alex, Michael, Nerd and Amanda.",1374710400,,208,4.885714285714286

4676490,3,B005FISC3Y,"I liked Nikita.  It was however, something that had to come to an end.  As the third season brought one into the the depths of the mind of Amanda.  I am not one to be pro-psychology, all their insights Rule sort of person. My take was ""Amanda is an Evil Witch.  I wanted her dead and good and dead."" The fact that Division had to most definiately define the Psychology of their methods was understandable.  I think it's also fair to say that through the Media, Schools, and Books.  We are being torn apart by some form of ""Social Justice"" that is birthed from something outside of the Bible.  The other side of the coin is that if someone is going to take on a cancer like Division, The Oversight Committee and eventually the Club.  Which are all code words for ""rich people with Money in a limited form are ruling the world.""  I looked up the Name Nikita and it means ""Freedom for the people.""

4676562,4,B005FISC3Y,"I think I've seen every iteration of the Nikita franchise and this one has turned out to be the best.  The underlying story is really quite grim but this time around they've mixed things up with enough suspense to really move things along and enough brutal violence to make Wayne LaPierre happy.  Why four stars?  Well, I just think that at this point (end of third season) the story has run out of gas.  Of course, I have no idea what's coming but the stories have gotten more and more fanciful and just hard to believe.

In case you haven't seen this Nikita, my favorite episode is the sensational ""All The Way"" from season two, where Nikita, having escaped Division, fights her way back in.  There are scenes in this episode that are as exciting as anything you'll see in the movies.  Since things have gotten pretty familiar by the third season, I enjoyed the few humorous bits.  Early in season 3, Nikita is at CIA headquarters, locked in a fight to the death with an equally attractive Russian agent.  Two unsuspecting CIA guys walk by and the girls have to stand down for a minute.  During this time out, Nikita complements the Russian on the great shoes she's wearing and the Ruskie gal says ""thanks!""  Then they get back to trying to kill each other.

The best moment, I thought, of the entire 3rd season was when Owen returns to his hotel room where he has Amanda shackled to the bed.  Owen's just made a multi-million dollar deal and he plans to dispose of Amanda as soon as possible.  Obviously, this is a tense situation but Owen says ""I hope you haven't been using the mini bar.  They really kill you with the prices on those things.""",1369180800,,1648,4.483221476510067

4676799,3,B005FISC3Y,The first and second season were much better. Turning the place into a do-gooder seems like a bad move. Bring more bad boys and bad girls back into the mix. And I don't mean villains like Amanda.,1365465600,,195,4.297297297297297
4676800,5,B005FISC3Y,"I first caught this on Netflix when I was on medical leave and forced to be flat in bed for an extended period; being in information, international relations, humanitarian affairs and human security, I was interested to see if I'd like this show because I know the landscape of threat assessments. I run a foundation that puts out a journal on this, and I know others in the field. I figured I'd be hyper-critical, but instead I loved the intelligence of the show, the sense of bringing certain histories and character development  to the fore, beloved ""Nerd"" caustic quips and both obvious and subtle references to fantasy and sci-fi, and Nikita always trying to make sure she's using her abilities for the right reasons, and questioning those who don't. While some of it is far-fetched, I also know personally that truth can be stranger than fiction. I'm now getting caught up here on Amazon on season three after binge-viewing on Netflix the first two seasons. I'm hoping they continue forward for further seasons, and they they'll keep up the level of intelligence in the writing as well as the complexity of character development. Those like me, who love smart television, and who also know what's going on in the world, need more entertainment like this for decompression from the very real, brutal world some of us deal with every day.",1365206400,,1342,4.834782608695652

The show is what happens after division which we haven't seen before. Executive producer Craig Silverstein stated it best when he said, ""It's a dark fairy tale. This girl [Nikita] is taken from one life, her identity is erased, she's put in another life and she's transformed. It's like Alice in Wonderland. She's told, 'Eat this, drink that, steal this, kill that,' and she's not told why. And, she begins to find her own identity through that. It's just a great story.""",1361923200,,605,4.716981132075472

Niki is a badass!  she is complicated but not obnoxiously so.  every episode I wonder how the writers are going to take it anywhere and every episode I am surprised and in awe of how they can keep you guessing!  the missions are obviously over the top but not in a way that you can't even fathom how it would be completed.  The romance isn't the total focus.  Her sense of loyalty and family give the show its well rounded plot value but being as I like action flicks, It doesn't take over the purpose of the show.  She sticks to her missions and does what she thinks is right regardless of the danger.  Her being a chick makes me love it even more!  move over 007, 00Niki will give you a run for your money!",1361750400,,791,4.111111111111111
