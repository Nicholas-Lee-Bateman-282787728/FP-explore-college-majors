WRESTLEMANIA 2

The first portion of the show took place in New York, the next in Chicago and the final third in Los Angeles. This of course is the only Mania to do this, probably because it didn't work as well as it looked on paper I guess.

1. PAUL ORNDORFF VS DON MURACO-this was a cool opening match that started as a technical match and morphed into a brawl. That of course is what lead to the double count out. This was a good opening bout.

2.[I-C TITLE]RANDY SAVAGE VS GEORGE STEEL-this of course is the one I always want to watch over because my boy Randy Savage defends and keeps his title, I love it. The match is mostly Savage running from Steel and getting manhandled. From time to time Savages speed helps him out as well as Steels obsession with Elizabeth. Of course the Macho Man retains here even after Steel tears apart a turnbuckle.

3. JAKE ROBERTS VS GEORGE WELLS-this was a pretty short match that would see Roberts dominate and come out on top easily. Of course the snake makes an appearance and used on Wells despite what the broadcast team wanted.

4.[BOXING MATCH]RODDY PIPER VS MR. T-this was the boxing match that continued the feud that these two became infamous for in this sport. One of the best real life feuds was showcased here. This was an entertaining match while it lasted and accomplished what it was meant to. T gets the DQ win of course because you cant have a celebrity loose, or so Vince thinks. I am a huge Piper fan so anything with him I am always into. This was the main event of the New York segment.

5.[WOMENS TITLE]THE FABULOUS MOOLAH VS VELVET MCINTYRE-the first match in Chicago was a really quick one for the Womens title. The legend herself Moolah makes quick work of Velvet pulling a Randy Savage.

6.[FLAG MATCH]CORPORAL KIRCHNER VS NIKOLAI VOLKOFF-the winner of this one would get to raise his colors high. This is that good old USA versus whatever other country we are up against, in this case it was Russia. Naturally the American comes out on top here, this is of course only the second Wrestlemania. Quick match that wasn't really long enough to say anything like the last match.

7.20 MAN BATTLE ROYAL-the other match on the card that people remember other than Pipers, this of course is probably the best on the entire card. Still despite what people will tell you when thinking back this was not the main event for Chicago. It was so cool to see Bruno here and of course the excellent Hart Foundation. This was the WWF/NFL connection as people from both walks of life competed here. The crowd was really into this one for obvious reason as players from the Bears were included, refrigerator anyone. It comes down to The Hart Foundation against Andre the Giant, this is the most fun part for me. Andre as you all know gets the win here.

8.[TAG TITLE]THE DREAM TEAM VS THE BRITISH BULLDOGS-this was the main event of the Chicago Mania with two great tag teams. The Bulldogs in particular have always been a favorite of mine, one of the absolute greats. The champs were Greg Valentine and Brutus Beefcake against Davey Boy Smith and Dynamite Kid, The British Bulldogs. Now if the battle royal wasn't the best match this one was because it is excellent. Good back and forth action with both teams having moments of dominance. The Bulldogs pull out the victory and win the straps.

9. RICKY STEAMBOAT VS HERCULES HERNANDEZ-this was the first match from L.A and I should point out that Elvira was on commentary here. The first match in LA is excellent with The Dragon controlling most of the match and goes on to win it. But Hernandez showcases his power here in this match. Great contest.

10. ADRAIN ADONIS VS UNCLE ELMER-this was the quickest match on the LA card with Adonis coming out on top. Fun match but like some of the other quick ones it was a bit of filler, still good.

11. JUNKYARD DOG & TITO SANTANA VS TERRY FUNK & HOSS FUNK-this was another great tag match and that seems to be a thing at this Mania. These two teams went at it hardcore. In fact it turns into a hardcore match towards the end with the ref losing control. Good back and forth action with classic heel and face storytelling. Great match.

12.[WWF TITLE STEEL CAGE MATCH]HULK HOGAN VS KING KONG BUNDY-this was obviously the main event of the evening and delivered. This was a fun cage match that didn't really showcase anything new or different from a Hogan match other than the environment. Bundy of course used his side and worked on the injured champion. Hogan of course would fight back and from under like a classic face. He of course drops the leg and goes over the cage for the win.

This was a good event although not one of the best Manias ever. There are some really good things here and is essential to any wrestling fan. It is of course the second ever WrestleMania and the only to be held at multiple areas.",1430265600,,4864,4.5

8562023,1,B00B361GGC,"Here, fans, is the genesis of Vince McMahon's invention, Sports Entertainment. Sure, it's the company's biggest wrestling show of the year, but the in the ring stuff is clearly secondary. And why not? You've got the lights, the glamour, the Hollywood Royalty (Cathy Lee Crosby? Finally!). Most importantly, you get the man responsible for all this pomp and circumstance (no, not Macho's theme song this time): the Immortal Hulk Hogan!! Yes, Hogan, just 2 years into his first WWF championship reign, has never been bigger, both popularly and medicinally. But is there any chance he can retain the belt when he has to step inside the steel cage with the awesome King Kong Bundy?
  Full disclosure: I was at this show. Well....sort of. This was McMahon's first attempt at a nationwide PPV, and since that whole scene was an unknown commodity, the company also provided dozens of closed circuit sites around the country so fans could gather at a theater-like venue and catch the show. At this time, I was living in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and so naturally I was a diehard Mid-South wrestling fan. Like so many other long time fans, I absolutely hated what Vince was doing to The Sport of Kings. I actually thought that maybe he was attempting to commit genocide on his own industry. What else could he have in mind, raiding the territories, stocking his own roster with the best of the best, then showcasing them by turning them into harmless, goofy buffoons?
  Anyhoo, my buddy and I decided to check it out, due to the fact that we were wild and crazy teens looking for stuff to do, and because we were rasslin' nerds who would complain about the WWF daily like it was the 4th Reich, yet pay ten bucks to watch a wretched looking card on a big screen. Did I say wretched? That would've been a big step up...it was unholy. And not in a cool, Dio way.
  First off, you haven't lived until you've heard popular television veteran actress Susan Saint James provide color commentary for a seemingly endless amount of time. If memory serves, here's how Miss Saint James described the simmering feud between Mr. Wonderful Paul Orndorff and the Magnificent Muraco: ""Vince, it's clear the bad blood between these two respected veterans has been simmering since Muraco was the WWF Intercontinental champion while Orndorff was toiling for Bill Watts in Mid-South Wrestling. Orndorff felt that his skill set was superior to that of Muraco, who was garnering the glory while competing in Madison Square Garden main events. This reminds me of Jumbo Tsuruta's reaction to Antonio Inoki's popularity in Japan...."". Uh...sorry, wait. While refreshing myself on WM2 for the first time since March of 1986, I see that S.S.T.'s announcing was more akin to, ""Oh my god, these guys are huge! What do you feed them, Vince? HaHaHaHa!!!"".
  Tho the announcing was unbearable throughout (only Jesse Ventura seems to understand he's there to watch and explain wrestling matches), it was like a college class taught by Lance Russell, Jim Ross, and Gordon Solie compared to the vile goings-on inside the squared circle. Let's see....while I was bummed about the great Jake Roberts leaving my home territory to play with the big boys, I felt a stab of pride when he was greeted by fans with tremendous heat. This despite the fact that he was facing George Wells, who was strictly a Jobber to the Stars on WWE TV every week. A squash on a PPV? Man, this Vince is breakin' all the rules! After Jake's quick win, we're treated to one of the evening's main events: Rowdy Roddy Piper in a boxing match vs. Mr. T. Guess what? It sucked eggs like a vacuum in a hen house. Thankfully, Vince and Susan were doing their best to make sure nobody watching was actually paying attention to inside the ring activity.
  I officially entered Dante's 7th centrifugal level of wrestling Hades when Nikolai Volkoff squared off against the WWF's newest flag-waving patriot, Corporal Kirchner. The Corporal was a panic hire by Vince after Sgt Slaughter left the company, leaving a crushing void in the crucial racist foreigner bating department (this gimmick was THE staple of the entire business in the '80's). Sadly, Corporal had a couple of minor deficincies: he was abysmal in the ring, and he was nutty as a loon in real life. I blinked, and he was pink slipped.
  Since the word was out that McMahon only seemed to feature roided up bodybuilder types, Vince decided to show his critics that he was more than willing to exhibit the morbidly obese as well. Thus, Uncle Elmer vs. Adrian Adonis. Elmer, a 400 pound hayseed who made George Wells look like Lou Thesz, actually received cheers from these witless, misguided WWF fans. Contrarily, Adonis had long been one of the most talented and respected workers in the sport. Unfortuneatly, Adrian, never a workout fiend, ate himself into one of the disgusting physiques wrestling had ever seen. While nauseating to look out, however, Adonis could still bump like an old school Dolph Ziggler, throwing himself around the ring like a Chinese Acrobat with an inner ear disorder. Vince rewarded his loyalty and talent by giving him a flamboyant gay character, ensuring the vet's utter and permanent humiliation among his peers. Not long after that debacle, we yawned through the WWF/NFL battle royal, pitting WWF stars against some of the NFL's biggest names at the time. Winner, of course, was the only guy in the biz whose body was so bad that Adonis used to razz him, Andre the Giant.
  Before I get to the main event, I'm sure you're figuring I was having a pretty miserable time stuck to a cheap folding chair while hiding my eyes through this embarassment. Actually, things got interesting locally about halfway thru the show: In walked Mid-South promoter, and avid McMahon hater, Cowboy Bill Watts. He strolled to the main area in the little theater, his 6'4, 300 pound frame noticeable by those with even the worst peripheral vision. He did not sit, did not move, for over an hour and a half, as he accomplished two things: checked out the competition, and made himself not just visible but larger than life to the 200 or so fans in attendance, 99% of whom were also rabid Mid-South Wrestling fans. You could literally feel this amazing audience-wide net of shame settle down on all of us, mortified that not only had we wasted good money on this atrocity, but that we were being personally eyeballed by the anti-Vince, the man who was then creating the greatest wrestling product anyone in America had ever seen, the big Cowboy. It felt like my mom had walked on me while I was flogging the dolphin. Enormous shame.
  With Watts' shadow hovering over me, I was reminded even more of what I was treated to live every Sunday night at the Tulsa Civic Center: wrestlers like The Freebirds, Ted Dibiase, Steve Williams, Dick Slater, Dick Murdoch, Eddie Gilbert, and at least a dozen more as good as anyone in the business at that time, showcased by the best booking anywhere, all analyzed to perfection on TV by newcomer Jim Ross. So when King Kong Bundy, who was currently being pushed as the most intimidating monster ever but who looked like a bald oompa loompa compared to Mid-South's monster heel One Man Gang came to the ring for a match that nobody, not even the dunciest WWF homers in those days of kayfabe, considered the possibility that this clown could overcome the most visible performer in wrestling history. When Hogan finally won, ending our thoroughly debasing night at the closed circuit matches, we joined the rest of the crowd as we jockeyed for position in order to exit as far away from Bill Watts, who was practically blocking the exits while still staring up at the now blank screen with a look that clearly said, ""Nearly a century of tradition is burning down because of THIS crap??"".
  After a trip down memory lane, DVD style, I must concede that my disgusted reaction to WM2 back in 1986 was actually entirely too kind. Somehow, the genius, the greatest promoter in wrestling history, managed to stack a card with Hall of Fame talent like Piper, Randy Savage, Terry Funk, Bret Hart, Rick Steamboat, Jake Roberts, the British Bulldogs, and more, yet produce a show so absurd, forgettable, and insulting that even in today's increasing nostalgia-heavy culture still provokes the same violent reactions among fans worldwide.

8562026,4,B00B361GGC,"I remember first watching this event on a Coliseum Video release during the 80's and it was completely butchered with many segments cut out in order to fit in a certain time frame for the video.

Well this DVD release restores many of those scenes and feels more like a complete PPV from back then. Unlike the later Mania's, the announcers here did not refer to the Federation as ""W-W-F""(they actually said ""World Wrestling Federation""); so we don't have to endure those edits where the ""F"" is dubbed into an ""E"".

As far as the event itself, Wrestle-mania II was historic in that the event was held at separate arenas and included a cage match as the main event. Certain parts of this Mania felt a bit disjointed(because it was held in three different arenas) and some of the guest celebrity announcers sounded clueless.

For the DVD, it would've been nice to get a few extra features. Maybe a retrospective, or some commentary from former wrestlers who performed at Wrestle-mania II. Run-time for this DVD is slightly over 3 hrs and 2 mins.",1367625600,2,1042,4.683060109289618
8562027,3,B00B361GGC,"A couple of notes here in that this is the exact same version of this event taken from the WrestleMania Anthology set meaning that all references to ""WWF"" & various music has been changed to due the rights expiring but there is no blurring of the WWF logo since this event happened before the ""Attitude Era.""

""What The World Has Come To"" is the tagline for the second edition of WrestleMania & WWE decided to do something they've never done before with this edition by broadcasting from three different locations across the country.  Various celebrities include Joan Rivers, Tommy Lasorda, Susan St. James, Cathy Lee Crosby, Ernie Ladd, Rick Schroder, and Ray Charles singing ""America The Beautiful.""  This event also featured the WrestleMania debuts of various superstars & legends like Randy Savage & Miss Elizabeth, Mr. Fuji, Magnificent Muraco, George ""The Animal"" Steele, Jake Roberts, Bret Hart & Jim Niedhart, Davey Boy Smith & Dynamite Kid, and Dory Jr. & Terry Funk.

New York City's Nassau Coliseum hosted the first part of the show with the main event being Roddy Piper vs. Mr. T in a boxing match that featured Joe Frazier & Lou Duva as the corner-men which saw the crowd begin to favor Piper, Intercontinental Champion Randy Savage vs. George Steele, Jake Roberts vs. George Wells, and Paul Orndorff vs. Magnificent Muraco.

Chicago's Rosemont Horizon featured 20 Man ""NFL vs. WWF"" battle royal that featured various superstars such as Andre The Giant, Hart Foundation, Iron Sheik, the only in-ring appearances of Bruno Sammartino & Pedro Morales & Tony Atlas, NFL legends Bill Fralic & Russ Francis with the memorable showdown between William ""Refrigerator"" Perry & Big John Studd.  Other matches include Tag Team Champions Dream Team vs. British Bulldogs with Ozzy Osbourne in their corner, Corp. Kirchner vs. Nikolai Volkoff in a Flag Match, and Womens Champion Fabulous Moolah vs. Velvet McIntyre.

The Los Angeles event was broadcast from the Memorial Sports Arena with WWE Champion Hulk Hogan vs. King Kong Bundy inside the new ""baby blue"" barred steel cage which to date is the only regular steel cage match in WrestleMania history, Dory Jr. & Terry Funk vs. Junkyard Dog & Tito Santana, Uncle Elmer vs. Adrian Adonis, and Ricky Steamboat vs. Hercules.

This concept looked good on paper but it didn't work out quality wise to the point where WWE never did it again as only 5 matches went around the 10 minute mark while 6 matches went 5 minutes or less as  WWE spread the roster very thin here just for every city to get the same amount of matches.  This was a ""quantity over quality"" Mania so I would only recommend if you were a fan of WWE during this time period.",1364428800,2,2688,4.849344978165939
