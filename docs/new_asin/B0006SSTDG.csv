8042987,3,B0006SSTDG,"In spite of the lurid artwork on the DVD cover, which promises much, the mystery provided inside is nothing short of tepid.  The plot involves a murder that takes place in the Sphere Museum, a consortium of freaks and acts of a dubious nature.  Two mayoral candidates are seeking to make headlines by shutting down corruption in the city, starting with this seedy establishment which they hope harbors drug trafficking.  When City Councilman Blair Newgate (Sam Flint) is shot and killed, the prime suspect is the man who was standing next to him when the shot rang out (Joseph W. Girard as Police Commissioner Brandon).  Naturally, they try to throw suspicion onto a member of the sideshow..........any member, take your pick, they blame several.  A nondescript reporter decides to solve the case and gain a story.  The Commissioner's daughter, Phyllis Barrington as Lois Brandon, tries to help him in this endeavor, almost getting them both killed.

On paper, this must have sounded terribly exciting.  Unfortunately, it is routine at best, a by-the-numbers mystery.  It's a story of revenge and drugs, one having nothing to do with the other.  The scenes are stagey; the sets are flat pieces of cardboard with a few furnishings.  The acting doesn't amount to much and no one person stands out in this sea of banality.  The transfer is abysmal.  In some scenes the image ripples, the debris is noticeable.

I was not impressed.  Won't be keeping it to watch again.",1438300800,,1465,4.922448979591837

8042989,4,B0006SSTDG,"""Murder in the Museum"" is a 1934 whodunit starring silent film legend Henry B. Walthall (inexplicably misspelled in the opening credits as ""Walthal""). The ""Museum"" in the title is not what one commonly imagines as a building housing historical or scientific exhibits, but a carnival show with unusual and often tawdry attractions.  In fact, ""Murder in the Museum"" was supposedly inspired by ""Freaks,"" Tod Browning's 1932 controversial drama.  The ""Sphere Museum"" in this film, however, does not offer many ""freaks.""  There is an armless artist and a talking female head, but the latter is an obvious fake.  The museum mostly has scantily clad Spanish hootchy-kootchy dancers, Kinetoscopes with risque images, and sideshows like knife throwing and card tricks.

The reform-minded city councilman and the police commissioner (both of whom are running for mayor) investigate the Sphere Museum after receiving anonymous letters about dope pedaling and other vices being committed behind its doors.  During their visit,  the city councilman is shot dead.  Many among the strange personnel of the museum are suspects including the sleazy, drug distributing owner, a Mexican revolutionary turned knife thrower and drug dealer, and even the armless painter. Newspapers also consider the suspicious actions before and after the shooting by the police commissioner who has an obvious motive of ridding himself of his political rival.  The case is further complicated by the evidence found at the scene.  The only gun uncovered is a Colt .45; however, the bullet that killed the city councilman is a 0.32 caliber.

On the case is reporter Jerry Ross who is accompanied by the police commissioner's ditsy niece intent on clearing her uncle of any suspicion.  Ross is also aided by ""Professor Mysto"" (Walthall), a bibliophile and former professor of philosophy who is forced into performing magic acts to earn a living.  Ross was played by John Harron, the younger brother of Robert Harron who starred with Walthall in many silent films for D.W. Griffith.  Both Harrons died young.  Robert of an accidental shooting at the age of 27 and John of spinal meningitis in 1939 at the age of 36.

""Murder in the Museum"" is a fast-paced, hour-long film with a clever and somewhat unexpected ending.  It does get a little side-tracked by the drug dealer shoot-out scene, but that does not last long.  The acting, for the most part, is very good especially Walthall who brought his character an air of elegance and sophistication amongst the unsavory carnival players.  Like with most of the Alpha Home Entertainment editions, the packaging is impressive with bold and colorful images on the case and disc.  The price makes this pre-Code curiosity a bargain.",1282348800,,2735,5.172727272727273

The ""Sphere Museum"" has a collection of ""Natural and Unnatural Wonders"". When a ticket-seller sees the law they tone down the talk. The conversation gives the background to local politics. The presence of reporter Ross may force the politicians to take action. They have a ""Punch & Judy"" show (does that go back to Medieval times?). There are dancing girls. They see a ""shimmy shake""! There is a shot and a man falls to the floor. The police find a load of dope and arrest the performers. Newgate was shot by a smooth-bore .32, not the .45 found in the museum. Does the press still tell people what to think? Ross interviews Professor Mysto about the museum. Who called the police before Newgate was shot? The museum now has a new attraction.

Ross and Miss Brandon watch from the loft. Who is watching them? This man gets away. Later Ross goes to an old mansion. While listening Ross hears more. But he is caught. He hears shots fired! Did somebody try to hijack the drugs? The bodies on the floor say they didn't succeed. Where will Professor Mysto go? Ross follows him and finds a clew. Ross hears what happened long ago, and how a plot was concocted to get revenge on Newgate. A written confession will clear the innocent.

The idea of a political reformer with a past is not a new idea. ""Reform"" can be a euphemism for repressive politics. This film is dated in its story details but is still interesting.",1263859200,,1447,4.53639846743295
