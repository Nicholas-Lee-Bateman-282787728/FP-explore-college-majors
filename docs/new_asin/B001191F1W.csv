It is a funny and heart warming film.

8241080,4,B001191F1W,A great Indie film.  Love movies with quirky characters and this movie has quite a few!  The animation is brilliant!,1202428800,,116,4.75
8241081,5,B001191F1W,"It is a wonderful 5 star movie. Ok, the second half is a wonderful 5 star movie. Sweetly, I could easily imagine myself seeing and experiencing and living in that new world of the trailer park, as I watched the main character experiencing it.  I found myself filled with feelings of what it would be like for me to be there.  I was totally engaged and there.  OK, if you have to fastforward past some of the slower first parts of his life in the office, then do that, but DO that and get yourself to Paradise Park - it is a fascinating and sweet place to be, with great folks to meet along the way, including yourself!",1200614400,,618,4.220338983050848
8241082,4,B001191F1W,"We need more films like this: well written and directed, giving the actors all they need for their creativity to come thru. It's also a storyline we can all relate to. We saw it at a film festival and it stuck with me and my husband.",1200009600,,233,4.086956521739131
8241083,4,B001191F1W,"This is a great little indie movie. The cast is engaging, characters that reminded me of a few in my hometown. Nicely directed, manages to tap your emotions without being manipulative. A good ride!",1198800000,,197,4.823529411764706
8241084,5,B001191F1W,"As an ex-ad agency person, I found this story delightful.  Filled with interesting characters and really great performances.  Enjoyed it very much and definitely recommend it.",1198368000,,175,5.6923076923076925
8241085,5,B001191F1W,"This is a smart little movie it reminds me of the old movies where you had to pay attention.  It's really a guys' flick, but it has a sensitivity that can be felt by anybody.  I like it because it is a thoughtful dialog based movie.",1198195200,,232,4.021739130434782
8241086,5,B001191F1W,"Saw ""Postcards"" several years ago and I hated to let the characters go.  My husband and I both felt it would have made a great sitcom keeping the key residents and bringing in visiting friends with all their comedy and pathos as they ""got on their feet"" in Paradise Park.  Has there ever been a sequel?",1198108800,,302,4.375
8241087,4,B001191F1W,"I remember seeing this at a film festival years ago and wondering why more movies weren't as personal. From what I recall, the characters and some of the situations were quirky and yet I identified completely with the story. Glad to see it's come out on DVD as I'd like to visit Paradise Park again. I see by the DVD cover the tag line is ""A movie for anyone who's ever gone nowhere fast."" Sounds like most of us. I recommend this movie.",1198108800,,437,4.27710843373494
