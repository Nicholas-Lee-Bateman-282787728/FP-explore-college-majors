6223060,1,B00HUOZKJA,We can't play it!  It's in a format that can't be played.  Also it's missing one of the discs.  We need to return it and receive credit.  We're hoping to find a set which is formated for USA DVD players -- and is complete.,1420761600,10,222,3.977272727272727
6223061,1,B00HUOZKJA,I did not see the disclaimer that the dvd will not play in many regions. It was a Christmas gift and my mom was really disappointed. Not happy I wasted so much money on something which is so useless. Why sell something that won't play in many areas on here?,1420588800,12,257,4.16
6223062,1,B00HUOZKJA,"Five Stars for the series.  One star for the dvd.  Very disappointed that the dvd is compatible with British dvd players only.  Bought it for my mother-in-law for Christmas.

6223090,5,B00HUOZKJA,"6 stars if allowed.
This is a fine way to get started on Call the Midwife if you have yet to own any of the series. It has gone beyond 3 seasons, but the beginning is not to be missed. It is important to begin here, with season one, and progress along with the midwife staff, the other cast, and all the education of what evolved with midwifery in the 1950s. It is period perfect. It is drama at its best with suspense, romance, action, humor, well, every conceivable portion of greatness incorporated.

It begins with stars in important roles, but the show itself is so well written and created that other actors became stars as a result. Vanessa Redgrave, although performing only in voice, is a mature Jenny and tells the story of growing up in the profession. Jessica Raine is the filmed youthful Jenny shown as the story unfolds. She is in all 3 series, but will depart from the series later, but by that time a bevy of unforgettable characters vie for attention. Pam Ferris (perhaps best known earlier as Laura Thyme in Rosemary & Thyme) becomes a permanent cast member as a nun, and remains well past these 3 seasons.

The show is based on reality, the memoirs of the real Jennifer Worth of 1950s London, but the series has taken on an iconic realm of its own. Its hard to say what is best, as that depends on the viewer. Something for everyone. I know a retired obstetrician, deliverer of hundred of babies, was so impressed, he takes this show on mission trips to show to ongoing midwifery practices around the world. The content is that accurate.

This is a series that needs watching and reviewing to assimilate all that is presented. Fast action and multiple storylines in every episode. One episode carries over to another, the reason for the need to begin with season one and then enjoy to the fullest.",1454198400,8,1816,4.5474006116207955

6223095,5,B00HUOZKJA,"I LOVE this series! I think I love this series better than Downton Abbey. The writers and actors have done a superb job. Each episode is down to earth, absorbing and a joy to watch. Mostly I hear women watch but I think both men and women would love. The characters have been SO well developed. I watch on my Mac and can understand every word where if I watch on PBS I miss some. HELLO British TV, we love you!!! Give us more please.",1435708800,,433,4.105882352941176
6223096,5,B00HUOZKJA,"although I am unable to watch the one I ordered through because I was unaware of the viewing region code, I have been able to watch it with Netflix. the series brings both tears and laughter of joy to me. when I see just how life was on the poor side of London's dock yard, Popular in the late 1950s.  The fact that these are  actual stories of different people that the nuns  and nurses of the house of Nannatus helped makes it interesting enough,at least for me, to want to learn and see more",1434499200,,494,4.178947368421053

6223102,1,B00HUOZKJA,"I read comments by other sellers that theirs would not work on American equipment, so I searched for a similar statement by this seller. Finding none, I assumed it would work in the USA, so I ordered a set for myself and for a friend in another state. Being tried in Michigan, Florida, and Alabama on three different DVD players, each received the same or similar response, ""Eject the disc; this cannot be played in your area."" This has not made me happy! My friend has already returned her set and I will be doing the same this week, and I will be looking for a prompt refund. Unless you have UK equipment, do not buy this set!!",1424649600,3,629,4.338983050847458
6223103,1,B00HUOZKJA,Ordered two and neither one will play on my DVD!!  Now what?,1420761600,6,60,4.0
8635946,3,B00HUOZKJA,"This was a gift for family member for Christmas.  I received this later in year of 2018.  I gave the gift after I received it.  He did not open DVD until he got ready to watch.  It would not play on his TV.  I was told it was for our region (region 1). When he opened the movie box, he found it was for region 12.  I need to try to exchange it for something different if you have something  for region 1.  Please let me know what to do.  I don't really want a refund; just be able to exchange for other Midwife series that will work in region 1.

8635951,5,B00HUOZKJA,"Love this series! A very realistic portrait of maternity care by midwives in England in the late 50's, early 60's. It is fun to revisit the culture of the era while living the drama surrounding health care to this impoverished section of the UK. The characters treat each other with respect and love...so missed at times in today's world. As a nurse who worked in the field with midwives for many year, I feel that they realistically represent maternal/infant complications and the tecnology of the day.",1491523200,,503,4.8604651162790695
