7167055,4,B00XBL0KHI,"This DVD deals with the history of ballet until the beginning of the XX Century.  It lacks all the history of the XX Century in Russia and Europe, which is very, very rich and exciting.  It only touches the history of ABT during the XX and XXI centuries.  The rehearsal shots are good and the slow motion scenes too, but they take too much time of the film watching dancers in slow motion and it gets boring after some time.  Besides, with such a big range of dancers that have danced with ABT and are alive, why so much from Julie Kent?  She's not that significant for the audiences!!  I really missed more about great and exciting choreographies, choreographers and dancers that have taken part in ABT, and of course, of Baryshnikov.

Anyway, it was so good to be able to get a piece of ABT, I hope that they do more films.  If they choose some ballets from contemporary choreographers, not classical or romantic ballets, they could really sell something good to their audience.",1442102400,3,980,4.56
7167056,2,B00XBL0KHI,"a PBS documentary full of talking heads ranging from Lucia Chase to Jennifer Homans (why on earth?;go figure!).  Curiously, Barishnikov - a former director - isn't given a single word to say.  ABT Ballerinas, past and present (Julie Kent through Misty Copeland), say typically ballerina things.  Little snippets of dance and rehearsals interspersed, but nothing to get excited about.",1440115200,9,383,5.4576271186440675
7167057,3,B00XBL0KHI,It was okay.  Gives a good history of the company.  If you want to know more about the company then I would recommend it.,1438560000,,121,4.0
7167058,5,B00XBL0KHI,"This episode of PBS' American Masters series was directed by Ric Burns (who is the younger brother of Ken Burns),  best known for his documentary on New York City. Though the title implies that it is the history of America's first dance company (founded in 1940) to present repertoire from more than one choreographer, it is so much more. Nearly the first 33 minutes of the 104-minute film is devoted to a history of ballet. There are some great archival film clips and both new and archival interviews with those involved in both the early days of the company as well as today.

I appreciate modern ballet a bit more than classical ballet but found the film well worth watching. I did ""like"" it a lot but I'm sure anyone very familiar with the company itself will find even more to enjoy. Hence, I'm giving it five stars. And a copy probably belongs in ever performing arts library and it would make a great present for a young person who is considering dance as a future career.

The DVD has no additional bonus features.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7167062,5,B00XBL0KHI,"Streaming is the HD version of the documentary where the DVD is not but regardless, a superb documentary. Ballet originated in France in seventeen hundred and moved to Soviet Union and later moved all over the world. This documentary covers the history of ballet in a very calm and subduing manner that you will be glued to the monitor all the way to the end. Watching those dancers in slow motion from jumping into the air and then landing so gracefully while communicating without a single word expressed, is an experience that requires physical and mental dedication unlike any other sport other than art of ballet. This documentary takes you through from the beginning of ballet to what it takes to be in ballet and the language of ballet. It will get you pumped up enough to the next rational exuberance; Have ballet on your bucket list Magnificent, informative and extremely well done documentary.

7167064,1,B00XBL0KHI,"Nothing really important is revealed here. The changes in the company from old Ballet Theatre, with distinct aesthetic goals, to the amorphous entity ABT is today are glossed over, barely mentioned. There is not much about Lucia Chase or Mikhail Baryshnikov who truly tried to turn ABT into an influential company but failed. This is just an infomertial for the current touring company without an artistic profile which is what ABT has become.",1485475200,3,443,5.082191780821918

7167068,2,B00XBL0KHI,"I was quite disappointed and agree with the comments of other reviewers regarding this DVD - lots of talking heads, no substantive mention of Baryshnikov and other dancers who had such a powerful impact on ABT and not enough dance - just snippets, really.  It seems to be more an advertisement for ABT than a thoughtful presentation of dance.  For those of us who cannot travel to NY or other cities to see ABT in performance, it would have been a great opportunity to present segments of some of the more current works.  It was nice to hear and see the dancers who were there at the beginning and who provided some very interesting information about their experiences. I do not recommend this DVD if you expect to see much dance.",1473292800,4,730,4.557251908396947
7167069,5,B00XBL0KHI,"One of the finest summaries of the ballet world; the rigors of development, practice, administration and performance. The photography is unparalleled and story telling top quality. I highly recommend this video without reservation. Note: the storyline offers the viewer a glimpse into the world of American Ballet, it's history, performers, ballet moves in exquisite slow motion and samples of performance works",1472601600,6,411,5.754098360655738
7167070,2,B00XBL0KHI,"The cinematography is indeed gorgeous, but I cannot see how this documentary is particularly 'informative'.  For someone who already knows a bit about ballet, this holds nothing new.  The commentary is mainly composed of vague, poetic, and subjective comments while much of the interesting facts and history of ballet and ABT are left unmentioned.",1470009600,2,347,5.407407407407407

7167080,5,B00XBL0KHI,"Amazing documentary, and I'm not even terribly interested in ballet. It is riveting from the very first moment the ballet shoe falls from the air. In fact, the watching the dancers is as fascinating as the stories behind the company's success. The cinematography is completely captivating. I loved that it not only gave a history of ABT, but also a history of ballet itself. Fast paced, but with wonderful use of slo-mo on present-day dancers. The history is told through former and present dancers, along with critics and a few others. Can honestly say I've watched this at least a dozen times, and never get tired of it.",1463788800,11,622,4.768518518518518

7167097,5,B00XBL0KHI,"Beautiful, truly. I know absolutely nothing about ballet. Never seen one in person. Maybe portions of the nutcracker on tv at Christmas time. But that's it. Sad to have miss out all of these years. I hope someday to witness such eye and soul candy in person someday.",1450915200,,266,4.5625
7167098,2,B00XBL0KHI,"I'll second the opinion of the ""French critic"" somewhere else in this section. As a fan of both Ric Burns (his Donner Party doc. is one of the greats), ballet (NYCB more than ABT, but ballet in whatever form of excellence it takes), and Jennifer Homans too (her writing on dance is very strong), I was gobsmacked at how awful, banal, just plain irrelevant this documentary was. The interviews are (as FC noted) pedestrian, the history (such as it is) is cursory, and--most shocking of all to my mind--even the excerpts from dance pieces were, as frequently as not, disasters. How can that be, you ask? Monsieur Burns clearly has no idea (no idea) what ballet is, is about, or how it communicates, so he changes it to something he can understand by (are you ready for this?) slowing it down. Yes, many of the clips are in slow motion, as if ballet were the equivalent of Olympic gymnasics or selections from the NFL highlight reel--you know, the grace of Jerry Rice as he lunges, in slow motion, for that touchdown pass or the sweat thrown off the brow of that Big Bear tackle as he smothers somone, in slow motion. I guess I'm not doing a very good job describing the level of misunderstanding represented by Burns' slo-mo techniques, but take it from me, it's not about ballet. A real disappointment, and proof (but we've had this kind of proof before so don't get me started) of how shabby the American Masters series is, was, and continues to be. They'll broadcast anything. No selectivity, no control (except over nudity and speech codes, the absurd controls of American TV), no critical discrimination, no historical intelligence. Everything in the American Masters series is the best, greatest, turning point of the century, most amazing whatever it is. And if you don't believe it, just listen to the bimbo celebrity interviews, where friends of the honoree tell us what a genius he, she, it was. Nothing and no one profiled is less than brilliant or did less than change the entire history of the medium or form forever. (I teach in a film and television program where professors already do this to the history of television and the movies, telling the students that every piece of junk they screen in class is revolutionary; but I would hope that television itself is smarter than the people who teach its history in the academy.) The PBS shell game of ""art for the masses""--the brain-dead masses, to all appearances--goes on, sad to say, and this documentary and the entire broadcast series it is unfortunately not an exception to is just one more proof of it.",1444780800,10,2570,4.726057906458798

8715646,1,B00XBL0KHI,"This is awful in so many ways. Between the never-ending slow-motion footage and incoherent, unchronological historical content, it has little to do with ABT. Rather, it fetishizes it. PBS used to deliver some fine ballet, especially during the l'age d'or of Dance in America in the '80s, but no more. And, a little of Jennifer Homans goes a long way. Many of us have read her book and vividly remember her condemnation of today's young dancers, indeed the entire future of ballet. Now, I'm supposed to take her seriously when she sings a different tune? Please Lord, do not let her become the spokeswoman for ballet.  If you're interested in a truly articulate, informed and fascinating ballet documentary, try Dayna Goldfine and Dan Geller's marvelous Ballet Russes (2004).",1523232000,,774,5.046875

8715655,1,B00XBL0KHI,"Singularly one of the worst films on dance and one of the worst documentaries I've seen in a long time. The script is totally unfocused and can't decide whether the subject is the history of ballet or the history of the ABT.  The dance sequences are miserably shot and mostly in slow motion. You never get to thrill to any dance sequence because they are all shot in small bits, slowed down and accompanied by music that doesn't match the dance. The archive footage that has been unearthed is mostly silent footage that is jumpy and unremarkable and not matched well to the scores.  With such a rich history to draw from, why are there so few people interviewed for this film, the most articulate being Clive Barnes. I would have liked to have heard from more dancers and choreographers of note. Just a ghastly film.",1488672000,6,816,4.582191780821918
