8565975,2,B00BCJR9OI,"This film is the ""teens explore an abandoned mental institution"" coupled with the hand held found footage genre. The first three chapters of the film is talking about ghosts over the family water pipe, along with a history of mental institution torture with the same lame historical black and white film plus a little Greek Mythology.

Chapter 4 (in case you want to skip all that stuff and miss the mild character build up) starts the meat of the film as our threesome enter Greystone and start filming in a most annoying fashion. U-tube videos of people making love in a small row boat during a storm while tossing their camera into the air does not have as much jerking motion as this filming. When you add the fact of the lights flashing on and off, it is a wonder that you can make it through it without developing some weird epileptic motion sickness.

Sean ""Shaky"" Stone is the main character. He is accompanied by Antonella Lentini and Alexander ""Shakes"" Wraith. The film is a clever descent into madness either through the power of suggestion of something supernatural. Unfortunately they chose a genre that ruined any script genius. Lights going out. People screaming. Shadows, quick movements. These cheap effects have all been done before and better.

Parental Guidance: F-bombs, no sex or nudity.",1397606400,2,1309,4.860986547085202
8565976,3,B00BCJR9OI,"I guess I'm the first reviewer to have found out the hard way that ""The Asylum Tapes"" is the same exact movie as ""Greystone Park."" I should have known, just reading the product description. Oh, well, live and learn. I don't really know which title is the original; I do know that I bought GP in the Blu-ray/DVD combo and am pleased with that. I just thought I'd share this bit of knowledge with my fellow horror movie buffs. I do like the movie, though.",1369612800,6,453,4.341176470588235
8565977,4,B00BCJR9OI,"When I first read the plot synopsis for THE ASYLUM TAPES, I have to admit that I was not too interested.  After all, the found-footage sub-genre is flooded with similar concepts.  But I'm very glad I took a chance on this film because it is actually a unique and well-made jaunt into terror.

I did not realize this film was made by Oliver Stone's son until I pulled it up on IMDB.com while writing my review.  This explains where director Sean Stone gets some of his talent; I would wager that the filmmaking gene is almost hereditary in their family.

THE ASYLUM TAPES is shot well, or as well as can be expected when it comes to supposed found-footage.  This means that the camera is shaky, but never to the point to where you can't see what's going on in the scene.  This is a good thing, too, since the filming location has low light-levels in most of the shots.

The acting is also good, which makes this film even more enjoyable.  As we all know, acting in these kinds of movies can be sketchy...but no so here.  Sean Stone and his fellow cast mates deliver believable and, in some cases, chilling performances that enhance the already existing tension in this film.

My sole complaint about this film is the background music that accompanies some of the scarier scenes.  Since this is supposed to footage that was found at the scene of a crime, a background score doesn't make any sense.  When it arose, I was immediately yanked out of my immersion in the film and irritated.  Still, this is by no means a reason to ignore this film.

THE ASYLUM TAPES is a taut thriller that contains spine-chilling terror and visible tension.  There are many images in here that will leave you white-knuckled with fear.  I actually jumped at a couple of places, which is a true testament to the talent of the filmmakers.  If you're a horror fan, I recommend checking this one out soon.  The film is out in stores now.  Give it a look.",1364342400,2,1927,4.482758620689655
8565978,5,B00BCJR9OI,"This movie is a great find for fans of the genre.  Sean and his friends explore an abandoned psychiatric hospital, and discover way more terror than they had ever bargained for.  Features a cameo from Oliver Stone!",1362355200,,214,4.756756756756757
