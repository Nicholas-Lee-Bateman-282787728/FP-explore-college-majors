7805854,5,6300210847,"I have seen this movie several times in 16mm since the early 70s. A great adaptation of the Christ taken from the four gospels of the new testament. A low budget movie, but very moving and magnificently dramarized, especially by Robert Wilson who plays Christ. Quite accurately diologued according to the King James version of the Bible. Would like to see this movie made into a DVD. Great movie with relevant continuity. A treat for the family and churches alike. Some well known actors are featured in this movie "" Lee J. Cobb "" and "" Mike Connors "" to mention a few.",1332115200,3,569,4.533980582524272
