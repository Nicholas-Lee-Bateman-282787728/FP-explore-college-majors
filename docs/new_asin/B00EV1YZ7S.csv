8609741,2,B00EV1YZ7S,The image quality is AWFUL! It looks like someone dubbed this from a VHS tape. I think my old copy is even better than this one and it's deteriorating.,1462320000,,151,4.241379310344827
8609742,5,B00EV1YZ7S,This came really fast and in perfect condition.  I loved the Santa and the Three Bears Special when I was young and I'm enjoying sharing it with my son now.  Thank you!,1458950400,,168,4.21875
8609743,5,B00EV1YZ7S,"I bought this for the 3 bears. A movie my daughter and I watched on tv all through her childhood, but suddenly it was not aired and for many years, we have not seen this great heart warming film...She is all grown up, now and I gave her the dvd, a couple of weeks ago, she was giggly like the little girl, I remembered. Her smile, her giggles, makes this a priceless movie and I recommend it for all families.",1431561600,2,409,4.125

8609745,3,B00EV1YZ7S,"I had a vhs copy of a Gumby holiday tape. It consisted of about 30 mins of stop motion stories,which were excellent by the way,ranging from Christmas to Thanksgiving. I was disappointed with Gumby's Christmas Capers,but truthfully,my expectations were NOT high. I knew this dvd would NOT live up to my cherrished video,but its better than nothing. Santa and The Three Bears was ok,but the guality of my vhs copy of this cartoon is better than the dvd:-/",1419120000,,453,4.82051282051282

8609747,5,B00EV1YZ7S,"Here we have the wonderful and always adorable Gumby and Pokey, and a feature called Santa and The Three Bears!
This is total fun for the entire family. Very entertaining, funny and just sweet stories. Took me back to when we grew up in more innocent times and life was not about iphones and social media. You cannot go wrong with this one since you can invite the kids to join you! 5 stars!!",1395878400,5,392,4.3108108108108105
