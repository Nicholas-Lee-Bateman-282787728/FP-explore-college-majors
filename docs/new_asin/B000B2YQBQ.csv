2399399,5,B000B2YQBQ,"It's apparent that those who have the 1-star ratings for this video are not Duke fans (and even some admit it).  So, if you're not a Duke fan- why watch it?  And then blast it with negative reviews?  But for those of us who are true blue, this video is a MUST HAVE.  Watch it once and you'll wanna watch it twice to see the fascinating history that you may have missed the first time.  It's packed with outstanding footage of games from the beginning of the Blue Devil legacy, to the initiation of the Duke vs UNC rivalry and up into Coach K's fantastic leadership of the team.",1140307200,9,577,4.256880733944954
2399400,5,B000B2YQBQ,"I've seen this DVD and I have no idea what these guys are talking about. Clearly, they haven't seen this movie. There is no 27 minute interview with Jay Bilas and I find it counterproductive to be debating the merits of Jay Bilas' basketball opinions. Instead, we should be talking about what a great and entertaining film this is. It seamlessly chronicles the history of a storied program with thoughtful interviews from all the great Duke players and Krzyzewski. And the DVD extra on K'ville captures the phenomenon of students tenting like none I've seen.  It's the best Duke film yet. Any Crazie would be crazy not to buy it and reminisce.",1133395200,22,643,4.741071428571429
2399401,4,B000B2YQBQ,"I am so tired of people speaking on material, and only making

comments on its content because they are speaking from their

heart..I see so many people, and this may be a little off base

because it has little to do with the DVD we are speaking of here, but just because you like or hate a certain team does not

mean they deserve that low or high a ranking just because you

are filled with hate or love a team..think about it..I am sure

some of the NC fans probably think they will go back to back

this year..Just remember JJ Redick picked NC and rooted for them to win the national championship last year..I wonder when the last time a Carolina fan, or player for that matter pulled for Duke like that..",1131667200,12,709,4.246268656716418

2399404,5,B000B2YQBQ,"This movie is a must-have for any blue-blood duke fan, and should be watched by all college basketball fans to show them EXACTLY HOW A PROGRAM SHOULD BE RUN.  Coach K is the greatest coach in NCAA history and clinched that title with what he did in the Olympics!!! I live nowhere close to Durham, being from Saint Louis; but I still recognize that this is the greatest NCAA movie available.",1366156800,,390,4.492957746478873
2399405,4,B000B2YQBQ,"This is a very interesting view of the history of the university and the people and players that made the rich heritage of championship basketball possible there.  You will see footage and pictures from the very early days.  You will see and learn about the players.  Remarkable footage of these early athletes and the stories that surround their days at Duke.  If you are a Duke basketball fan, you will not be disappointed.",1362787200,,425,4.780821917808219

2399407,5,B000B2YQBQ,"I got 3 of these, one for my husband and one for each of my 2 sons who are all Duke grads and huge Duke basketball fans.  I watched this and totally enjoyed it, and I know my husband enjoyed it even more.  Especially when it got to the years he was at Duke.  It was fun for him to reminisce.  I enjoyed all of it, but especially when Coach K came on the scene!  If you have been a long time Duke basketball fan I believe you will really like ""100 Seasons of Duke Basketball"".",1355270400,,475,3.90625
