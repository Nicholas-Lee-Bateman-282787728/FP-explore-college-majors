3622224,1,B001GZJTIW,"Wow, just wow. I saw this online yesterday and was blown away...by how bad it is. How the writer(David S. Goyer) of Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and Blade wrote this junk is beyond the realm of human comprehension. The biggest mistake is having David Hasselhoff playing the cigar-chomping, retort-flicking superhero. Anybody with sense knows that Kurt Russell would have been a shoe-in for Nick Fury.

The story: Andrea Von Strucker(Sandra Hess) plans to release a poisonous gas into Manhattan. Nick Fury with the help of his partner/former girlfriend Countessa Valentina(Lisa Rinna) are out to stop her.

Hasselhoff playing Fury is the least of the movies' problems. The dialogue is almost on par with Batman and Robin. I find it hard to believe that the guy who wrote Batman Begins can write such jewels as: ""I'll get the blood from that viper even if I have to suck it out of her neck myself"", ""pop sicko, get it? Pop sicko"" and How's your needlepoint"".
Sandra Hess wins the ham of the year award hands down for the cheesiest supervillian in superhero movie history next to Uma Thurman and Arnold Schwarzenegger in Batman and Robin. The maniacal laughter is acceptable in cartoons but in a movie its downright corny.
Plot holes and continuity errors run amok. One hole is that Fury is kissed by Andrea earlier in the movie and is poisoned by this kiss yet he is still able to fight like a tank throughout the movie.

What more can I say? If you like your superhero movies extra-cheesy with mold on top, you will have a ball with this one but if you expect it to be great than expect to be disappointed. One of the corniest superhero movies next to Captain America point blank period.",1228176000,11,1688,4.6767676767676765

3622248,1,B001GZJTIW,"I didn't pay attention to what Region this was in . It was a gift for my husband and come to find out , he cant watch it because it is not the right region . I wish I had paid attention to this as I wouldnt of brought it.",1414108800,2,221,3.44
3622249,4,B001GZJTIW,"Yes, it's cheesy.  Yes, all the acting is over-acting.  Yes, it doesn't stand up to the current standard of comic movies or the Agents of SHIELD tv show.  But come on people, it was the late '90s, what movies weren't like that by comparison?  For the review that says they didn't know about the movie until it was on tv.... it was a made for tv movie.  It stars David Hasselhoff, who does a good job of portraying the Nick Fury of the comics (seriously, go pick up Strange Tales #135 and tell me he did a bad job).  You can't, because the Hoff nailed it.

If you're looking for cinematic perfection, this ain't it sister.  If you want a fun romp that stays close to the original source material (from the mid-60s, for all you new-age comic ""lovers"" who didn't jump on the train until it was ""cool"" to be into comics) then this movie is worth the time for true fans.  It is not worth more than a few bucks out of the bargain bin though.",1408492800,7,935,4.207865168539326
3622250,1,B001GZJTIW,"Think baywatch hasselhoff, but worse at acting, and that's exactly what you get with this movie. Kill yourself before you even consider watching.",1398384000,,145,5.3478260869565215
3622251,1,B001GZJTIW,"its pretty commonly known that this is one of the worst comic book movies ever made, not to mention that it's so bad and unknown that barely anyone has even heard of this movie, I didn't hear of it till it was on tv when I was 20.

There is absolutely no reason that this horrible movie should be even over $1, the new and used prices both being over $40 for a horrible film? especially with The Avengers out and The Avengers is FREE on amazon prime to watch!!!! compared to an EXTREMELY OVERPRICED HORRIBLE movie? really?
the people selling it must just want to keep it forever and have it on display on amazon, looks like they use amazon as a museum for their HORRIBLE movies that they don't want to sell lol!!",1397692800,7,712,4.274074074074074
3622252,5,B001GZJTIW,"THIS WAS AND STILL IS A GREAT VERSION OF THE ORIGINAL NICK FURY. JUST LIKE THE ORIGINAL NICK FURY COMICS AND SGT FURY.

3622253,1,B001GZJTIW,"Really? 120 bucks for a Hasslehoff movie? No thanks, I'll just go watch The Spongebob Squarepants Movie instead. At least I don't have to pay for that s***ty performance.",1381968000,3,170,4.896551724137931
3622254,1,B001GZJTIW,"I never knew this was made until my friend found it used, at complete random, in a shop, for under five dollars.  It is hilariously bad through and through(it's made-for-tv anyway), and very fun to give the ""bad movie""/""hoo-hah"" treatment, but why in the world is it up to 120 bucks on here?  Part of the appeal of buying crap movies was how little they're supposed to cost.",1380240000,7,374,4.485294117647059
3622265,4,B001GZJTIW,"This is a, relatively, cheaply made overacted 'bad movie' - however it actually attempts to bring the Nick Fury of the 70s and 80s spy-fi comics to life. The Hoff overacts as Fury in a manner that is actually consistent with this era. It is not a 'Good' movie by the conventional standards but as a bit of giggle it is fine. Don't take it too seriously and you might enjoy it. If you like the Matt Salinger or Reb Brown Cpt America movies you should enjoy this.",1368835200,3,461,4.25
3622266,3,B001GZJTIW,"Let's try to remember a time when Marvel wasn't making blockbuster hits with their catalog of characters.  Not so long ago we were treated to gems like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Captain-America/dp/B005E7SF7E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Captain America</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Howard-the-Duck/dp/B001MWUWU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Howard the Duck</a>.  Then you have David Hasselhoff as Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.  This was a made for TV movie, probably a backdoor pilot for what could have become a TV series.  There's a good reason it did not.  The plot is pretty standard comic book movie fare, evil organization intends to wipe out Manhattan with poison gas, it's the acting, or rather over-acting of the Hoff that hurts this.  It's not helped by Sandra Hess' villain, the awkward action or the script's real lack of peril for the leads. Thankfully, the pacing keeps the film moving and it's engaging enough to keep you entertained.  Ultimately, while this is not a successful effort, it's far from the worst entry in the Marvel catalog of films.  For a fan of Fury, it's nice to see a live action version that pre-dates Sam Jackson, and to see a helicarrier and L.M.D and all the trappings of S.H.I.E.L.D even on the small screen.  For a comic movie collector it's a must have.  This wasn't a wide release (Best Buy exclusive) and was hard to come by then, even harder to own now.",1361318400,19,1505,5.708520179372197

3622268,4,B001GZJTIW,The movie is really not very good but it is kind of fun and it has the Hoff in it so it was worth it.,1346371200,,101,3.08

3622270,4,B001GZJTIW,"This little TV movie is a real guilty pleasure of mine. I've always loved Nick Fury, whether he was a Howling Commando or an agent of SHIELD. And though this movie is not a classic adaptation of Kirby or Steranko's Fury...it does a pretty good job of keeping up with the Marvel Comics series.

Two gripes: Would've loved to see the REAL Hydra outfits. And Baron Strucker was disappointingly portrayed.

But for 90 minutes of mindless comic book fun, this can't be beat.",1297641600,5,469,4.63855421686747
3622271,4,B001GZJTIW,"Like Hasselhoff or not the film is a classic comic story brought into a movie that seems to be for a potential weekly series that never got picked up. As someone who has read the comics I was entertained, it is great to see Fury vs Hydra instead of the typical Batman-Joker, SpiderMan-Goblin, Superman-Luthor that have been done.
If they made this film today with all the effects you can easily add now it would be pretty good. As it is old technology you have to forgive that.
As far as the price I think that is based on supply & demand. I can't imagine they pressed more than 10K of these if that many so if you need to own a copy....
I say watch it once and you will be all set.
They need to do a Fury film with Jackson since Marvel made him the Movie version",1288483200,4,763,4.093333333333334

3622274,5,B001GZJTIW,"Compared to the first early Marvel movies,Captain America,The Punisher, and The Fantastic Four(which I did not see but I heard mixed things), Nick Fury was really good. First of all, Hassellhoff actually looks and acts like Nick Fury and the plot was pretty good for its time. Arguably, the villians could have been better, however it was good movie. Look at the horrible Punisher(Ugh!)then look at the Captain America( double ugh!) and you will definitely appreciate Nick Fury.",1236384000,17,478,5.141025641025641
8307492,3,B001GZJTIW,"Made for TV film that was dated, even for the 90's... I missed it when it first aired (only once in the US) and I've watched it for the first time in 2016 so you can imagine my less than impressed reaction... It's not a terrible film, but there's a fine line between lame and entertaining. This version of Nick Fury is the original incarnation, before they changed the character's ethnicity... I own it now but can't imagine watching it again. For those of you curious to see it, go ahead it's worth checking out. Even if the story is just ok, but overall decent performances by everyone. WARNING: so far up to 2016 this film has yet to be released in the United States (gee I wonder why) this version is the U.K. release, so make sure you have a compatible player before purchasing this DVD.",1474761600,,792,4.394557823129252

8307495,5,B001GZJTIW,"This is the closets adaptation of a marvel product since the huk conan and dr strange... the best characters to adapt are the ones that are not the ones that paid theb ils betwen jack kirby and stan lee its these type of characters that are good for tv.. Conan Nick fury dr strange, ghost rider which they jacked up in every direction, David Hasselhoff was great as nick fury people talk about his acting but he looks like he read the comic books and even nick fury was too much in those pages any of those pages and  any guests appearances he made in the comic books in other heroes books...Remember he plays an old war horse thrown into a directive status and therefore is a nosy secretive character like men in black or mr seven from star trek - james bond... there was a lot of love ion the production and in many of the super hero stuff that comes on tv i found out while the show was on or the commercial just came on and I did not know a thing.. so this is high entertaintment . david haselhoff should have been given the nick fury show with this pilot if that was what it was.. think of all the old actors that could play a cameo appearance thiat did not show up in Knight rider.. thats what these things are about!
the new sheild thing just aint working at all- sharon carter- etc... This is a good show.  I would have loved to see david haselhoff in this i would not miss an episode just like I only missed 4 episodes of the flash with john wesley shipp....",1445990400,,1467,4.180212014134276

If you recognize all that and appreciate what Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, and Jim Steranko accomplished c. 1965-67, and just sit back and watch this for pure enjoyment's sake, I do not think this will be a time-waster.  Sure the whole thing is camp and corny but geez what do you want, Sir Michael Redgrave or Sir Laurence Olivier?  For its genre (and intent) it is a blast-from-the-past entertainment.  No I did not buy the DVD; I watched it on Youtube (and could only find the finale in voice-over Russian there.  I understand enough Russian and for those who don't, the film scenes will carry you through).  This is indeed comic-book level but it's good.  Yes, this is good.  If I could afford it I would buy from Amazon and maybe I will one day.  It's a good once-a-year view.
