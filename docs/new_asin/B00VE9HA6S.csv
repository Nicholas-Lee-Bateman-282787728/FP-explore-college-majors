8709838,4,B00VE9HA6S,"You do not have to speak Hebrew to enjoy this movie (but it would help). Zero Motivation follows the story of a handful of Israeli Defense Force (IDF) conscripts at an outpost in the midst of nowhere.

The three main characters, Admin LT, one admin assistant who would become an officer and one, Zohan, the center of the story.

This is a slow, but quite funny movie. Should you find time on your hands and happen to see this available for viewing, go for it.",1470355200,,459,4.3882352941176475
8709839,5,B00VE9HA6S,"Young Israeli women soldiers serve as office personnel in a distant, far from everywhere army base. Their CO, an over-plump woman captain is determined to make a success of her military career, alternately threatening, cajoling, or begging her women soldiers to perform.  When they fail to serve coffee and bisquits for the staff meeting (the most odious task in any chauvinistic institution), she ridculously does it herself. She is an obvious failure as a leader, hence the Hebrew title -""Zero in interpersonal skills"". The young women, on the other hand, could not give a damn. They are there to somehow fill the time until they get discharged, to wonder what will they do when the service is over and real life begins, and to experiment (mostly with hilarious failures) with love and/or sex. They show no military motivation, period.
The movie is not a critique, neither a pean, nor a deep social feminist commentary. It is in many ways patterned on MASH, but it is not. Army serves as a backdrop only. It is a pure comedy, with rapid Groucho'esque dialogue (often very good) and part very good slapstick, a must for a good laugh. Great writing, directing, and particularly acting. Dana Yvgi, an ugly-beatiful all-around star is fabulous (as she almost invariably is).
Warning-some situations are very Israeli, therefore may be hard to translate into the global idiom. But on the whole it should not impair your enjoyment. Buy! Watch! Have a good laugh (more than one).",1434844800,,1473,4.939516129032258
8709840,2,B00VE9HA6S,"Found this very disappointing.  The language was crude and,more importantly, there wasn't a single female soldier showninapositive light.if it was meant to be a spoof, that didn't work either.",1433462400,,192,5.620689655172414
