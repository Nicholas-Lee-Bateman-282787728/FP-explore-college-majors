8014237,1,B0001LYFQ8,Vanguard delivers a crappy 1.85:1 letterboxed full frame VHS rip to deliver that 100th generation VHS feel from the 80s. I don't need reminders of what poor worn out VHS tapes looked like Vanguard!,1475798400,,197,4.823529411764706

8014240,1,B0001LYFQ8,My title of my review pretty much wraps up my review of this film. The story is long and confusing as all heck. The video transfer (from what I imagine was from some old VHS tape)is lousy and the picture quality is very poor. The story line is inundated with so many meticulous details that result in an overly long film that confuses the viewer into eventual boredom.,1376524800,,368,4.426470588235294
8014241,5,B0001LYFQ8,"In ""Si te dicen que cai"" (""If They Tell You I Fell"" from 1989), by Vicente Aranda (based on the novel of the same title by Juan Mars&eacute;), we have a bold and insightful analysis (a psychological one), of the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War (1936 - 1939) and the Franco dictatorship, as seen from the perspective of a small circle of survivors in a suburb of Barcelona. The story takes place in 1940 (via flashbacks from 1970 where the story opens), up to the present-time (1988). This is basically a story within a story as it unfolds from the recollections and second-hand accounts of the main narrators. Including the orphaned children who play out and tell stories (aventis), of the horrors they have witnessed and experienced.

Too bad most people don't seem to get this film and have missed the point for the most part. What Aranda and Mars&eacute; (co-screenwriter) have accomplished here is truly thought-provoking. For instance: the heightened sexual-theme and nature of the story (similar to Pasolini's ""Salo"" 1975, but without as much emphasis on ""shock value""), served as a way to contrast the repressive mentality of the Franco regime and its supporters, with the desire for ""individual freedom"" of the resistance fighters. As some of us very well know: Sex---can be a liberating thing! But in the hands of certain degenerates (in this case: El Falange, the Aristocracy, Royalists, the Church, etc.), it's completely the opposite. The inadequate and sexually-frustrated ""fascists"" (the Corporate State), seem to only take pleasure in other people's pain and suffering, through acts of degradation (this of course also has political and religious overtones). This was perfectly exemplified by the sociopathic character of 'Conrado' (Javier Guruchaga).

 With an excellent cast on hand: Victoria Abril, Jorge Sanz, Antonio Banderas, Javier Guruchaga, Juan Diego Botto, etc., etc. This film is a valuable addition in every cinephile's collection, not to be missed. Ideals and principles (like one character said to another), can never be killed, how true that is.

The DVD picture quality is very good. NTSC, Spanish (English subtitles), NR 114 mins. (BTW: due to the sexual-nature of the film, recommended for mature audiences only.)

Love and Peace,

8014244,4,B0001LYFQ8,"This movie is very dark, Victoria Abril is a prostitute that is also part of the revolution in spain.  Antonio Banderas is the rebel leader, this story has many twist that I won't ruin for you, but you should know that There is alot of nudity and violence. And Victoria is quite pregnant during several brutal sex scenes.  Again this movie is a very dark look at war and what it does to people. One final note, it is in spanish with subtitles.",1314835200,5,443,4.325301204819277
