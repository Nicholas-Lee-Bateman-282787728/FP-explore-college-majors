8187710,1,B000OYNV5I,"When I buy a ""season"" on DVD I usually expect more than one episode on the DVD! Even though it was cheap, there are other foodie seasons that fall in that price range so was very suprised to find that it only contained one episode.",1283731200,,231,4.155555555555556
8187711,4,B000OYNV5I,"one thing to watch on this DVD-R.  make sure you note this is DVD-R Format.  not all players will play DVD-R.  note this is in the format description.  this seems to be a good DVD, if you note the format, so you can make sure you have a player that will play it.  My Player does play this DVD-R well.  not all DVD players will play DVD-R.  the same is true of blue ray players, be sure they will play the format that you purchase.  there is +R and -R DVD.
I like the show, and it works in my Sony player, just be sure to get a model that will play DVD-R on this one.  I know how you feel about the format being incompatible with your player, for some.  I have not yet purchased video on demand format, due to the fact it won't play on a DVD player.  if you watch Amazon, you can find real good DVDs, watch the format and you can have a good DVD if you make sure your player plays the format you buy.",1282780800,,899,3.8846153846153846
8187712,2,B000OYNV5I,"Basically a cropped version of Adam Richman's Man Vs Food. Unfortunately, the cropped bits were the best part of MVF. On MVF, every episode is essentially of 2 parts, a walk-through of the specialties of the restaurant in question followed by food battle. Far as I go, it's the walk-through that's the more enjoyable part as the audience is introduced to the mouth watering dishes that the restaurant offers. Food is invariably presented in a flattering way in this part. The food battle can be a bit predictable and unappetizing as it always features Adam Richman's stuffing his face with hitherto appealing dishes, which is enough to make the most attractive food appear unattractive.

The DVD contains only the equivalent of the food battle part of MVF. It therefore only makes for indifferent and uninspired watching for us foodies.",1266364800,2,836,5.014388489208633
8187713,1,B000OYNV5I,"I have watched this quite a bit on the Travel Channel, but when I saw it on DVD I had to own it once and for all. So I ordered it because it was cheap, and wouldn't you know? That old adage ""you get what you pay for"" didn't even cross my mind.

I tried for over a half hour to get the thing to play and my Sony Blu-ray player would not read it. Sorry, it's the only player I have in the house. Sent it back. Awaiting refund. Went searching for similar problems and turns out this is the only review for this product.

If you don't think your player can read a DVD-R, don't chance it. I did, and now I'm a little mad. Live and learn.",1250121600,,632,3.853846153846154
