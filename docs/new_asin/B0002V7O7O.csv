8032738,4,B0002V7O7O,"If you're interested in ""family"" movies like this you'll enjoy ""Chitty, Chitty Bang Bang"" and ""Yours, Mine and Ours"".  Chitty, Chitty is an outstanding fantasy, musical, dance, escapist entertainment and Yours, Mine is a circa late 60s nostalgic family comedy of the first order making subtle, hilarious social commentary on the ""make love not war"" set, the affect of Vietnam in everyday life (of the late 60s), and the unintended consequences of true love.  However, ""The Black Stallion"" is really a Francis Ford Coppola conceit made with an annoying young ""actor"" with loads of annoying filler and camera techniques; at least in the first 1/2 hour.  Hate to be too criical of the Coppola but this is only a ""family"" movie if your family likes horses - it really shouldn't be included in this package.",1293321600,,802,4.925925925925926

OK - you want a review - here it is:

chitty chitty bang bang - wonderful fun for the whole family. clean and happy, nice songs, sweet story. 4 1/2 stars.

the black stallion - great kid, great horse. stunning photography. love the music, love the beach scene the best. beautiful. a boy and a horse. it rocks. 5 stars. woo hoo.

yours mine and ours - Lucile ball, Henry Fonda. i love this movie. too many kids and the parents trying to handle it. good clean sweet fun. you'll laugh - you'll cry. you'll be glad you don't have 15 odd kids.

this movie is actually based on a true story. i read the book. they were a military family, stationed near Seattle, i believe, on whidby island, i think. anyway, the book was good too. you get a lot more detail on how to make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for 15, in an assembly line in the morning before school.

and how do the parents get a minute alone together to conceive the ""ours"" of the story?! it's a hoot! 5 stars. love it.",1115164800,12,1130,4.306603773584905
