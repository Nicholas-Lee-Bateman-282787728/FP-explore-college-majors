The first half is an incredibly rich emotional fair that actually got me to cry for a few minutes. This is the second media production of any kind that has gotten me so sad i have cried, the first being the Green Mile. It is so sad, has amazing character development, and a visual style that hasn't been successful in decades, but really shines here. I highly recommend it.",1236384000,14,534,4.515463917525773
