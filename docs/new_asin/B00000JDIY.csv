1231974,5,B00000JDIY,"This film is a fine documentary of one dedicated group's 1997 journey to retrace the Endurance expedition. Unfortunately, the packaging and marketing of this piece misrepresents the content contained within; one  expects an historical narrative of the Endurance story.  Don't let that  dissuade you: This documentary is a great tribute to Shackleton, and a fine  exploration in it's own right. Any Shackeltonian will appreciate the value  of such an attempt. In the true spirit of Polar Exploration, a slightly  crazy but absolutely wonderful Irish team constructed a beautiful replica  of the James Caird lifeboat, which they christened the Tom Crean, &  transported to the Antarctic in 1997. They attempted to sail the tiny  vessel the 800 miles across to South Georgia from Elephant Island. (Only  the Irish would think they could get away with this feat twice in one  century!) The difficulties and utimate heartbreak the team endured simply  reinforce Shackleton's feat, as the going was so dangerous. They could  easily have killed themselves, had they been foolhardy.  Yet they used  Shackletonian thinking, and stayed alive to finish the trip to South  Georgia. At King Haakon Bay they set a memorial in stone to Shackleton.  Finally, they traversed the uninhabited interior of South Georgia, crossing  Crean's Glacier and finally reaching Stromness and Shackleton's final  resting place.  Their ""pilgrammage"" is a lifetime fantasy come  true for anyone who has ever imagined that 800 mile open boat journey. Use  this film in conjunction with the 1919 Hurley film, South, and you won't be  disappointed.  And if they ever try again, I'd like to go along.",949795200,19,1663,5.23574144486692
1231975,2,B00000JDIY,"This film includes an interesting recreation by some Irish sailors who followed Shackleton's voyage. It was an odd combination of modern and historic information, not really satisfying on either count.",947030400,3,201,5.733333333333333
1231976,1,B00000JDIY,"If you are looking for a video with film and still photography from the original Shackleton expedition, keep looking.  This video is really about a group of Irishmen who wanted to replicate the Shackleton expedition--and  only the part at the end where Shackleton's crew sailed in a small boat  from Elephant Island to South Georgia. To make it worse, they failed  halfway there and wound up on a larger cruise ship the rest of the way to  South Georgia, bemoaning their disappointment the whole way. After reading  the account of the Shackleton expedition, I was hungry to see Hurley's film  of that amazing journey.  Imagine my disappointment to find out this video  was, despite what the cover sleeve promised, nothing more than film of a  relatively uneventful personal adventure which uses Shackleton's expedition  more as an outline for the video's storyline than a reason to produce it in  the first place.",940118400,59,913,4.973509933774834

1232020,3,B00000JDIY,"If you like listening to Pachelbel's Canon over and over again this might delight you. The video footage seems to however be from an amazon rainforest not a Florida beach. Some might be from Hawaii too as the waterfalls looked rather magical. I am just guessing because I can't find any information on what locations were used during the filming. Mostly this seems to be water images of waves and waterfalls with moments of ferns and light filtering through trees.

Some issues I had with this was that the waterfalls are at times sped up. It feels like the producer tried to make nature fit the music. This caused some of the waterfalls to look a bit fake or cartoonish. Some of the images also show a background that is out of focus and this bothered me as it sort of hypnotized me while also making my eyes a bit tired.

A few spectacular scenes do however appear. There is a baby blue ocean with matching sky that is gorgeous. One pretty secluded waterfall also speaks of a more mystical forest. There are some unique birds I've never seen before that look like something out of an amazon rainforest.

Some of the musical tracks sound the same while others seem to be made with different instruments. Some have vocals, some not.

The scenes of the sky looked a bit like a grainy transfer from a video. But the rest of the DVD did not seem that way so you could just skip that part.

So this has positive and negative things. I suppose I'm on the hunt for the perfect DVD for relaxation. This has its moments but might focus in on ferns and waterfalls a bit more than ocean waves.

Even on the selection menu, there is a beautiful picture of a blue sky with palm trees. I would have loved to have seen that on this DVD. There are mostly scenes of waterfalls and streams in a forest, however, there are a couple of ocean scenes, but for me, they are not that great. Sometimes they seem to be in slow motion and out of focus. The scenes are constantly changing, which I love, and if one scene seems blurry then the next one is better. There are 2 scenes of Ayers Rock. The music is beautiful and sometimes seems angelic. This DVD didn't have the scenes that I wanted so that does influence my review.",1233446400,9,735,4.183098591549296

After we had dinner and did her homework, I put in the DVD and soon enough we were both dancing along with the BZOTS as they rocked against Globocrud.  The music was great and the animation was delightful.  I had to see if there was more to the series and luckily there is.

They don't watch any TV and have only seen some Baby Einstein videos and Finding Nemo. They love ""The Robots."" The tunes are really great and I find myself singing them after we watch the movies. The animation is totally cool - a cross between Monty Python and Yellow Submarine. The show reminds me of The Monkeys in that the plot is secondary to the fun music and groovy visuals. My daughters like it a lot and always want to watch more than the 2-3 songs we let them watch in a sitting. Both DVDs have great bonus documentaries, one about breakdancing and one about real robotics. The bonuses were fun for my wife and I and would be great for older kids. Keep the Bzots coming!",1085961600,,797,4.25
1232055,5,B00000JDIY,"At first, I wasn't sure how my nieces would like this DVD, as it's a little different from your average children TV shows. However, they love it! It holds their attention even better than the other TV shows, and they sits as if they are in a trance when it's on.
Overall, I highly recommend this DVD! It's enjoyable for my nieces, and I enjoy it too!",1081382400,,350,4.2388059701492535
1232056,5,B00000JDIY,WOW. I've never seen anything like BZOTS. Everything looks so awesome in this show. How did those crazy guys do it? I am absolutely blown away by all the graphics.

1232057,5,B00000JDIY,"This is quite possibly one of the best children's shows I have ever seen. The creative storylines combined with the loveable characters make for an irresistable adventure. What is especially attractive about the BZOTS is that it's not only a show that teaches about life's little lessons, it's a show that appeals to all the senses.  The graphics are amazing and the music even makes me dance.  Above all else, it's cool. This isn't your average everyday children's show.",1081036800,,471,4.949367088607595

Catchy music, spectacular production design (especially the amazing robots), and captivating stories, this is a great video, and I eagerly look forward to the next one.",1080950400,,438,4.776315789473684

1232063,5,B00000JDIY,"A terrific display of 21st Century Children's programming. I found ""Escape A Go-Go!"" to be the ultimate babysitting tool for my nephew Alex, who is as fickle as they come.
At first, Alex sighed when opening the Bzots DVD because he had not recognized any of its characters. Within minutes, he was humming along with  the songs and, when the program ended, was begging for me to play it again.
What stands out the most with this, and all Bzots episodes,  is it's ability to engage adults with its quirky, topical humor.
I recommended this highly!",1080864000,,545,4.666666666666667
1232064,5,B00000JDIY,"This is such a GREAT DVD!!!!  It's about Robots escaping from a factory.  My 3 and 4 year old children LOVE it!  This is SOOO entertaining for them.

Although this is a children's video, it's entertaining for adults as well!  Highly recommended!!!",1080864000,,383,4.7272727272727275

Every kid in America will soon be rockin' and learnin' with SKREE, WKE-WKE, and BDONK! The BZOTS have escaped and are on the loose, doing what they love most. Rockin'! The BZOTS really know how to jam and their songs keep you energized and toe tapping all day long, while they encounter everyday life adventures! These three are sure to be a hit with kids as well as adults. I should know...I'm both! I highly recommend this kids show. It is a mix of hip-hop, rockin' music and crazy antics,with an educational message that your kids will surely remember.",1080864000,,682,4.691666666666666
1232067,5,B00000JDIY,"First, let me say that this is a really good kids video.  Having said that, let me add that what I think does not really matter, so long as kids like it, and I have proof that they do.  My son and his friend (a regular playdate) request to watch this DVD more often than others in our collection (more than Bob The Builder!).  The story line is fresh and gives children credit for being thinkers.  But the truth is even I enjoy it as well.  The DVD is very music driven and the kids like to dance with the songs.  I like that they can get up and be active as well.
The storyline features three robots who ""escape' from their assembly line jobs at the ""Globocrud"" factory.  It's something of a musical as they often explain their feelings through song but the music is modern and very appealing to the kids.  There are scenes of children during the songs running, jumping, playing and dancing which acts as inspiration for activity in your young viewer.  This is definitely a great new concept in kids video, you would do well to get this for your children.  In a short time it will be as big as Wiggles I think.",1080864000,,1111,4.2727272727272725
1232068,5,B00000JDIY,"I heard about this DVD from the Apple Website and decided to order it.
From the FBI warning (which is very original and fun) til' the end of the video, I couldn't stop going, ""WOW, this is cool. Why didn't I have videos like this to whatch when I was a kid"". Seriously, I bought it partially for my kids, but also because of the article on the website. What makes this cool is that both my kids and I can relate to it, but on different levels. I mean, they just think it's a fun DVD. For me, it means good stories, with good moral values, and great humor, not the corny stuff they do on kid's videos. OK, some of it is corny, but it's still cool.
What I like the best is the music. It's real music, not that silly nonsense you hear on a Blues Clues or (please help me) a Barney video.
If my kids watch this a million times, I won't get tired of the music.

1232069,5,B00000JDIY,"Honestly, I looked at the box cover and thought my three year old daughter would have very little if any interest in anything not soft, cute, and/or Disney. Boy was I wrong.
Within the first two minutes of the Bzots Escape-A-Go-Go, she was transfixed! She watched it in it's entirety and twice without interruption. She sings along to nearly all the lyrics. Her fave is ""Let's Make A Friend  Now"".  She ""scratches"" with Wke Wke,and the best part of all...she cries when the Bzots ""power down"". She has never reacted emotionally to any other of the countless DVD's we own. Our new term for bedtime is to ""power-down""!

This film mixes the best of Hurleys original footage with a modern adventure as a brave Irish team follow in the wake of their fellow countrymen Shackelton, Crean and McCarthy  on that incredible boat journey. There is spectacular footage of Elephant island, the Antarctic Ocean and South georgia. I really enjoyed this film - especially after being put off somewhat by one of the Amazon reviews - but that reviewer obviously didn't do their homework - I already had Hurley's original film and wanted something more.

But, having said that, I would also like to say that there should be more of it.  The old line, ""always leave them wanting more"" comes to mind, but, seriously, this is something which should have a regular series or movie.  As for the 'story' itself, it reminded me of the book ""The Infinite Worlds of Maybe"" by science-fiction writer Lester del Rey, where people could journey to other versions of Earth, although un-like the book (minor spoiler ahead), which placed newly-teleported voyagers at ground level, the purloined device upon activation by a user appeared to place them elsewhere, choosing a random spot without regard to their safety (or the device's).  The so-called heroine's (but spelled heroin at the time of this writing for some un-known reason) reason to be called such wasn't evident or explained.  At best, we could think of her as an anti-hero if the use of such a device by the corporation which created it would be to dispose of hazardous materials to another dimension, but, this was not said or hinted at in any way.
