For what it is I think Donnie Yen did a great job directing this movie, and his little sister Chris Yen is a big surprise in a small package. Charlene Choi and Gillian Chung are both adorable, of course. I laughed out loud several times, and shook my head more than once, lol. Check your reality meter at the door, and enjoy it for what it is, good mindless fantasy and fun.",1473292800,,428,4.219512195121951
8229263,3,B000XR6QWG,"I just bought this movie and watched it last night.  In terms of if this was a good movie, I would say not really because there is no plot.  Charlene and Gillian need a place to stay and Rose (played by Teresa Mo) is looking for someone to take her place in the fighting world so Charlene and Gillian end up living at Teresa Mo's home.  Ekin Cheng plays a taxi driver who ends up wearing a Robin costume.  If you are a Charlene Choi or Gillian Chung fan like I am, then you can probably overlook most of the movie's flaws.  There were some moments where I was laughing because of the humor and silliness.  But there were also moments where I was wondering where Donnie Yen was going with the movie.  When the the characters started singing a rendition of Silent Night, I definitely wondered what the director was thinking that day.  Both Charlene and Gillian are really cute in this movie.  However in my opinion, Donnie Yen should find another career because directing is not his strong-suit.",1196380800,,993,4.472222222222222
