8137211,5,B000H6SVAS,Scott's done it well. This is not the first and probably not going to be the last program I invest in from Mr Sonnon. Well put together and the addition of precautions makes me appreciate the system more. A good addition to my gym...,1381622400,,233,4.318181818181818
8137212,5,B000H6SVAS,There are none better than Scott Sonnon at breaking down every exercise into precise detail and it's progressions. I highly recommend FlowFit ll to athletes of all types.,1359590400,2,170,5.107142857142857
8137213,1,B000H6SVAS,Having read so much about the RMAX products I thought I was in for a challenging workout when I ordered this product.  Wow was I wrong.  If you have a wrestling background where you are used to doing movement type drills you will find this DVD not very challenging to say the least.  If you are new to movement drills then perhaps this DVD might teach you something and even perhaps challenge you.  For my part I was very disappointed as I expected something akin to Ginastica Natural.  What I received was a very basic mobility workout.,1348704000,2,537,4.494845360824742
8137214,5,B000H6SVAS,"I am always looking for a deal and both Flowfit DVDs I bought at discount.  Worth every penny!  The first Flowfit introduces and very simple number of movements, that become exercises in themselves when repeated throughout all the '3 levels of difficulty' Sonnon demonstrates and teaches.  Once you play around with that then checkout the Bodyweight Exercise Revolution free e-book and see if you like Sonnon's Circular Strength Training structure.  When you find that you do, as I have begrudgingly...well, at times begrudglingly for there are many systems of movement, this is a great dvd.  It compliments most martial training very well, it expands on the first dvd naturally and fluidly.  To get the most out of this requires practicing a lot of the flowfit stuff.  If you are a pilates and yoga buff, first start with his free e'-book I mentioned and think more about the 99 dollar club package after checking his free Prasara yoga demos on youtube.  Check him out and see if you want to know how he does what he does.  That's it, he gives most of it away just none of the detailed explanation intact in this simple, spartan dvd.  I dig it!

  Something to be said, this is definitely a part of many educational manuals that are structured like a curriculum.  The various products I have bought came entirely out of curiousity and when I employed his methods I saw rapid results in strength-practice technique.  A lot of what he says is something martial artists could very well be familiar with.  This is not something to jump into without seeing the first dvd in my opinion.  I would say that the parlance he chooses will seem odd to someone who didn't see the first one.  Plus, the start positions in this dvd are solidly from positions one would be in if they were doing the basic flowfit drills.  I'm stoked!  I am into Pavel's stuff, I dig Matt Furey, EDT and all sorts of training....ginastica....this is just good and solid.",1253491200,4,1937,4.691394658753709
8137215,5,B000H6SVAS,"I've been playing with Scott Sonnon's unique Flowfit program on and off for a while now. It has only been during my last training cycle though that I've been devoting a significant amount of time to it. Given my positive impression of Flowfit 1 I decided to get FF2 recently and boy, was I in for a surprise.

I have seen a short introductory clip of Flowfit 2 on Youtube and found it hard to imagine how the movements shown could be strung together as a flow. After viewing the FF2 DVD I was yet again amazed by the genius of Scott. He has managed to ""mimic"" the exact 6 degrees of freedom as expressed in Flowfit 1 in FF2, but in a very different way. You see, Flowfit 2 is all about engaging the ground. Before you ask; this is not only relevant to martial artists or wrestlers who fall down a lot but to anyone who wants to befriend the ground that they stand on. In fact Flowfit 2 brings to mind the freedom of movement we all enjoyed when we were kids (in my case this meant falling down and rolling a lot).

The DVD starts (like Flowfit 1) with an introduction to the concept of intuitive training and, dare I say, I think Scott does an even better job in this second iteration of explaining this concept in such a way that anyone interested in physical wellness can get something from his explanation.

Scott continues to break down all the elements of the flow into manageable chunks in such a way that even a big guy like me can see myself eventually mastering the movements. The DVD ends with the movements strung together as a flow, which is one of the ultimate goals of Sonnon's system. He calls it ""flow"" and I also like to simply refer to it as total freedom of motion.

If you are looking for something different from treadmills, weight machines, endless hours of running, or whatever, that will take your fitness and movement potential into a totally new direction I can heartily recommend Flowfit 2.

I have to mention that the program is not easy but the way in which Scott breaks everything down into manageable chunks brings into reach some pretty amazing movements even to mere mortals like me.",1241827200,8,2116,4.429305912596401
8137216,5,B000H6SVAS,"First and foremost, this is not new levels of the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FlowFit/dp/B000EQH2PG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FlowFit</a>&nbsp;(an excellent work out program), but new exercises that expand on the vocabulary of movement developed in the first program.  This having been said, I would suggest getting comfortable with the second or third level (of four levels) of the first program before trying this one.

FlowFit II is about going from standing on your feet to lying on your back, front, or side, and back again, smoothly and without hurting yourself.  A simple goal, with a sophisticated methodology.  Rather than the traditional breakfalls, the aim is to use your entire body like the elastic structure that it is (can be, should be for someone in normal health), so rather than viewing the ground as a threat to be mitigated, the ground is just another element that can be used for leverage and resistance.

The exercise flow is well thought out and better instructed than the previous FlowFit, and is more directly usable.  This is about falling, a thing we do, even people who are not training for UFC or combat, a skill that anyone can use.  And the instruction is well structured and clear, and doesn't dwell on fighting or Scott Sonnon's background (unlike other videos where the instructor's ego interferes with the quality of instruction).

With minimal material and space requirements, this is a great addition to a fitness program for someone on a budget or who pursues a bodyweight fitness program for whatever reason.

This is an excellent product, and the program has become part of my personal training plan.

8137217,5,B000H6SVAS,"A few years ago one of the regulars on a popular usenet martial arts forum conducted a poll on what martial skill the group members had *actually used* most often.  Virtually without exception, the answer was ""falling.""

Whether you're a fitness enthusiast looking for a good workout, a martial artist, or just an ordinary person that occasionally trips on a curb, this DVD is for you.  Sonnon takes movements that are useful for (as he puts it) ""engaging the ground"" and weaves them into a self-contained, scalable workout.  Martial artists will find that these movements go against some of what they've learned about breakfalls.  I'm not going to attempt to tell you how this way is better than your martial art's techniques, but try it and see for yourself.  Breakfall moves designed for mats don't always translate well to concrete, and there are other approaches that may prove more fruitful.

Although the material is particularly useful for martial artists, the DVD is not particularly addressed to them.  A fitness enthusiast with no interest in martial arts will still find a killer workout, and the chance to train some movements that are really useful in everyday life at the same time. Next time you trip over the curb, you may be surprised (and very pleased!) at what happens next.

One cautionary note is in order here.  Since this is FlowFit II, some viewers may find that going back to the original FlowFit DVD is a better starting point.  However, I think most will be able to put this to good use right out of the box.",1165536000,24,1536,4.758490566037736
