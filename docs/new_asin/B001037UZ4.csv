[This set doesn't contain many extras.]

Alien Anthology on Blu-Ray
[Excellent collection but it is mostly duplicated here. One of the discs is full of Alien Quadrilogy extras.]

Predator Trilogy on Blu-Ray
[Contains the third Predator film (Predators) not available in this collection but also sold separately.]

Alien vs. Predator on Blu-Ray
[Contains the second Alien vs. Predator film not available in this collection but also sold separately.]

AVP: Alien vs. Predator / Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (Unrated Two-Pack) [Blu-ray]
[2 Stars.]

Since this collection is out of print consider purchasing the amazing Alien Anthology and the good Predator Trilogy instead (both on Blu-Ray). This set is not available on BD in the US. A US Blu-Ray release with 2-hours of new content would be amazing. The Ultimate Showdown DVD Collector's Set has held its value well.",1377216000,,1623,5.10188679245283
8236686,5,B001037UZ4,"Okay... the two figures that come with the package are well designed, but are for display only!
No, they do not move! Plus the alien figure lights up when you press a button on the alien's display stand!
Be careful with the Predator's blades though, both on my figure broke off... oops!
The movies:
2-Disc ALIEN: Excellent blend of horror, science fiction, and mystery!
2-Disc ALIENS: One of the greatest science fiction, action movies ever made! It's in my top ten best movies of all time!
2-Disc ALIEN 3: The weakest of the ALIEN movies; dull, boring, and without imagination!
2-Disc ALIEN; RESURRECTION: Good science fiction, and action flick but still lacks the charm of the first two alien films!
ALIEN Quadrilogy Disc: Lost of cool stuff that fans will enjoy!
2-Disc PREDATOR: Excellent action movie!
2-Disc PREDATOR 2: Not bad, but not nearly as fun as the first Predator!
2-Disc ALIEN VS. PREDATOR: Tried to be a good movie, but with a couple of flaws!

The special items:
1. Comic Book: AVP Sand Trap
2. Movie tickets to see Alien vs Predator: Requiem... keep the tickets but don't see the movie, it's bad!

Bottom Line: If you are a fan of the AVP franchise this is a must have in my book!",1313712000,5,1199,4.624413145539906

8236688,5,B001037UZ4,"This is truly one of the best DVD sets around.  You get all the ALIEN and PREDATOR films in 2 DVD sets, plus the bonus disc. But the best part is the awesome light up ""Alien vs. Predator"" statue that holds the set together!  Very, very cool!  Plus a comic book and two free tickets to see ALIEN VS. PREDATOR: REQUIUM!!!!  A must for any horror or sci-fi fan!",1196121600,7,358,4.144927536231884
