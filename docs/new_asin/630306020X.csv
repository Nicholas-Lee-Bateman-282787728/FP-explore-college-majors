543164,5,630306020X,This is an awesome movie! Cicely Tyson is wonderful as Jane. I loved this movie from the first scene to the last. Definetly a must-see!,1004745600,,135,4.44
543165,5,630306020X,"This was one of the first movies I had seen with Cecily. I really thought she was that old. 110! Keep in mind I was around 10 when I first saw the movie. Then I had seen Sounder and realized.. that was some Damn Good Make-up Cecily had on to make her look 110. But, this movie was SO Good I have never forgotten it. I purchased it when I got old enough to work. But, It's about the Civil Rights Movement and How Miss Pitman took a stand. Another Movie that is Really Good with Cecily are Mama Flora's Family. You can't go wrong with either movie!",983923200,,546,4.064814814814815
543166,5,630306020X,"I remember when The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman first aired on broadcast television in 1973.  I was a freshman in College and memories of civil unrest were still fresh in the minds of many Americans.  Although the production gets off to a bit of a slow start with some stilted acting by a few of the actors, it soon warms up and becomes very real.  Ms. Tyson gives one of the most moving and real performances that I've ever seen.  I remember that the movie was shown in the evening and, as far as I know for the first time in TV history, the network received so many phone calls as a result of its showing that they pre-empted their programming the next day to show it again.  It remains just as moving today.  Once you start you will not want to pause or stop until the end credits are rolling up the screen.  Incredible.",981158400,4,830,4.282051282051282
543167,4,630306020X,"I saw this originally when it was on TV.  I don't see an age range listed, but I would make sure children don't slip into the room while watching it.  I still have nightmares about the lynching scene. I think I was 10 or 12 at  the time.  It is an excellent story, just too much for kids to handle in  parts.",950313600,2,308,3.903225806451613
543168,5,630306020X,"A sad note to my first review...when the producers and crew were shooting ""The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman"" in the rural South one of the producers had to run with Ms. Tyson who, like her on-screen  character Jane, was determined to maintain her lifestyle by going for a  lengthy run in the predawn darkness in a section of the country that  necessitated her needing an escort.",950140800,,384,4.701492537313433

543468,5,630306020X,"Great classic! Watched this with my grandchildren for Black History Month. They had many questions as being a child of the 60s it was an eye opening experience for them - to see the history our our people was a good experience for all of us. I remember this movie as a child and watching it then. As an adult its a completely different perspective. I explained to them I REMEMBER the separatism in elementary school and desegregation, and the pride and appreciation we must have for our race. It was a rewarding experience with them as well as for myself.",1456272000,4,555,4.5049504950495045

543523,5,630306020X,Great piece. I first saw it as a child in the 70s and it should be recquired in schools today. Although it's a fictional documentary this way of life was commonplace for black America after slavery and may explain where we are today.,1454371200,,233,4.441860465116279

It thought it was fantastic to get to see the author and hear his story and how he relates it to his book.  I've got to get the book next and read the book.  There was a lot they said that got left on the cutting floor.  Cicely Tyson is fantastic and very believable as a young to old woman.,1443484800,,404,4.0

543564,5,630306020X,"Excellent viewing for the entire  family.  An all time great.  Cicely Typson does a superb job portraying the more than 100 year old, Miss Jane Pittman who survived the struggles of slavery without parents and a baby boy she informally adopted after his mother was killed during a freedom fight ambush.  All of this only to be faced with even further challenges after she turned 100.  This movie tells it like it was and reaches all of those tender spots that you didn't even know were there.  Well worth the time investment. What a gift!",1441756800,,538,4.610526315789474

543675,5,630306020X,"February is Black History Month.  I usually attempt to read a book about black history or read a book written by a black author or both.  This year I decided to read a novel I read back in 1971 when the book first came out.  Since then the book has become a classic.  A movie was made in 1974 starring Cicely Tyson.  I sort of remember the movie was good.  I think I shall check to see if Amazon has the movie and will watch it after I finish the book.

The book is fiction but is written in the style of oral history.  The authors brilliantly crafted book interweaves historical references and recollections into an overall framework of the life of a woman born into slavery who survived to the point of the beginning of the civil rights movement of the 1960s.  The story is told as seen through the eyes of a 110 year old woman who had lived though it all;  with simplicity and immense dignity Jane Pittman speaks of the Reconstruction period in the deep South, with its struggles for black self determination and betterment.  The constant terror of the Ku Klux Klan to thwart those efforts, and the legacy of racism that white Americans use right up to the present day.

Gainess description of the plantation is authentic and spellbinding. The story gripped my attention right from the beginning and kept it throughout the story.  This is a book that I enjoyed the first time I read it and have enjoyed it even more on the second reading.  Gaines was born on a Louisiana Plantation but was educated at San Francisco State and Stanford University.  This is a must read book for everyone.  Lynne Thigpen did an excellent job narrating the story.",1424390400,3,1646,4.491582491582491

She was magical, from her early age portrayal of Ms. Jane Pittman to a sage of a woman walking stooped over with a limp.  Her wisdom and genius was transmitted through the screen.

543928,5,630306020X,"I am so glad I took off my eye make-up before settling down to watch this movie because I cried my eyes red.  I had never seen this TV movie.  I just bought it and I'm glad that Amazon has the 2 Disc version because the 2nd disc comes with extras.  You get interviews with the directors, producers, book author, actors.  What a story!  Then you get to see the interview with the book author and you see how his childhood of the 40's and 50's living in a Louisiana plantation were the inspiration to his book.  I can see him as a child/teen having to write letters for the elders who couldn't write nor read.  I can see him as a child sitting on front porches hearing the stories of these same elders.  He didn't know back then how all this would spark in him his creative writing degree at a California university.  There's also a clip of when this TV movie won 9 of the 12 Emmy's it was nominated for and you see the elegant Cicely Tyson accepting her two Emmy's for this movie.

This is a MUST SEE movie.  It is beautiful.  It is sad.  It is historical.  There's a Louisiana professor (white) who LOVES this book and always has it as required reading in his class.  He also tells how the book is required reading in many schools. Somehow, I missed the TV movie and I missed the book but I'm so glad I found it on Amazon.

This is one of the best films I've ever seen and I love good films and have seen a lot of them.  This is MUST see.  It is an excellent reminder to all Americans of a very shameful time from the Civil War to the Civil Rights marches.

She is looking forward to it because she read the book. I don't believe she read it in school, but she goes to the library with her parents a lot and most likely found it there. I asked her if she thought her school would let her class watch it, possibly through a week, to be able to see it all. She told me she didn't think so.  I was sad to hear that and she was also. She said, ""grandma, if everyone could see this movie or read the book, maybe there would be no more racist remarks made, and people could understand how it was for the slaves years ago.""  I certainly know where she is coming from.

544007,5,630306020X,Cicely Tyson acted her behind off in this movie. You would never guess that this was not a real character because it chronicled so many things that occurred throughout history.,1350950400,,176,4.9
544008,4,630306020X,"First, let's clarify that even though it is titled ""Autobiography,"" it is fiction. Miss Jane is a bit like other historical fiction characters, bringing together a great many realistic incidents into one life. She was only a child of maybe ten or eleven when at the end of the war, the master of the plantation read the Emancipation Proclamation to his slaves, declaring them free. He said the paper came ""during the war,"" but he didn't see any need to read it then.

A Union soldier had been kind to Jane, giving her that name instead of her ""slave name,"" and had told her he was from Ohio. So when she left the plantation, she decided she was headed to Ohio. She was one of a group of freed slaves that were sleeping in a barn when marauders attacked and killed most of them. Only she and a little boy named Ned survived, and so the two of them continued north.

The main reason I gave this story 4 stars instead of 5 is that while each incident or situation was interesting, there was not much of a thread between them. The story starts when Miss Jane is celebrating her 110th birthday, in what I believe was 1962??? Young Jimmy, maybe in his early 20s and a college student, comes to her and asks her to join him with some friends that are going down to the courthouse so one of the black girls can drink from the whites only water fountain. As Jimmy points out, if one of the boys did it, the sheriff and his deputies would simply beat them up. They are hoping that a girl will simply be arrested, and they will then have a civil rights test case. Miss Jane says she'll think about it and tell him tomorrow.

Meanwhile, a white reporter from a New York magazine shows up and wants to do a feature story on her, and begins taking her oral history. So most of the story is episodic flash-backs. She uses souvenirs from a shelf near her chair to illustrate her stories. The two pieces of flint were Ned's mother's, used to make fire. When she was killed by marauders, Jane grabbed them up and had little Ned carry them.

There's a photo of Joe Pittman, a handsome fellow who was good at breaking horses. One day he brought home a ""devil horse"" (an albino), and Jane became terrified that the horse would kill Joe. She even consulted a voodoo fortune-teller, who confirmed her fears. So one night, Jane opened the corral where the horse was kept and let it run free. Bur Joe was angry with her for this, and mounting his brown horse, went riding out to recapture the albino. The next morning, the albino came back, dragging Joe's body behind him.

Ned went off to fight in the Spanish-American war, and returned with a wife and daughter. He wanted to open a school for the local blacks. I think this was in Louisiana, as Jane had earlier been stopped in her attempt to get to Ohio by not being able to get across the Mississippi, and she talked about the bayou. Anyway, Ned was big on speeches advocating education and civil rights activism for his friends and neighbors, and was killed by a cajun who used to fish with Miss Jane and had eaten at her house several times, just because he did what the bosses told him to.

It's a somewhat disjointed story, partly because of the format of the flashbacks, but it is otherwise an interesting story and well told. I felt sympathy for Cecily Tyson having to put on all that extreme makeup to play an incredibly wrinkled 110-year-old woman, but she did a great job. Her make-up artist did a great job, too, except for toward the beginning where there was some smooth area below all the wrinkles because the dress was too open at the neck. That got fixed in later scenes, but it was something of a distraction.",1336867200,,3654,4.39792899408284
544009,5,630306020X,"A very moving tale!  Well acted  and told, a 110 year old black woman tells her life story.  In it she has been a slave then share cropper when that war was supposedly won.  It shows very clearly the rankness that some white people contineued to wallow in when they could not hold slaves any more.  A tale that if not literally true would tell the tale of many such incidents that had happened.  Do the names need to be correct to show justice?  I don't think so.  Slavery is just one of a few types of behaviour only humans can be so animalistic to show.  A very good story all need to see.",1335398400,,591,4.114035087719298

This film is truly a television classic which features a legendary, once-in-a lifetime performance by perhaps America's finest actress, Cicely Tyson, who earned two Emmys for this performance. She deserved to get an Academy Award if possible. She is brilliant in anything but in this film, she plays Miss Jane Pittman who recalls her lifetime at 110 years old from her youth as a slave, surviving a massacre after the slaves were freed; she and a young boy, Ned, who calls her Mama later on make the journey to freedom. They work on farms, ranches, and etc. She is the mother of Ned who she sends away to get an education. He returns to free the slaves again from the mindset of slavery. Unfortunately, Ned doesn't take his mother's warning and is murdered. Jane marries a man but she doesn't tell him that she's barren and unable to have children. Their happiness is short-lived though. Miss Jane as she is referred to becomes a hard-working, church-going woman who survives two world wars, slavery, the Civil War, segregation, and she tells the young white journalist about her life. Believe me, there is not a dry eye in the house. This performance and others of Cicely Tyson earns her place as one of America's finest actresses (African American, Caucasian, Hispanic, or other).

I really love this movie and am glad that I got to see it. Cicely Tyson was so remarkable as Miss Jane Pittman. The title of this movie would almost make you believe that it is based on a true story--it is not, though. In this movie, you get to hear Jane's life story from her early years as a slave on a plantation (born into slavery), her adoption of a little boy, her marriage to Joe Pittman, and living to see the civil rights movement of the early 1960s. Jane lived quite a life; up to 110 years of age. She was a kind of person who had seen and been through quite a lot of things during her lifetime, which is obvious for anyone who lives that long. Cicely won an Emmy for her role in this movie, and she deserved it. The makeup was great as well. Cicely was only in her 30s or 40s at the time this movie was made, but with the makeup, you would almost think that it was an elderly lady playing Jane in the later years. I love this movie. There are some scenes in this movie that are disturbing, though, such as the scene where Jane and Ned (the little boy she adopted after his mother and other free former slaves were killed early one morning by the ""patty rollers"") went to a lady's house for a drink of water and got a very negative and cruel reception from her (trivia: cameo appearance by Katharine Helmond in this scene), some very disturbing scenes of the KKK, and her husband Joe Pittman's tragic death because of a white horse on the ranch that was a subject of evil, and several other sad scenes. But, all in all, this is a great movie worth seeing. I'm just so pleased that it is out on DVD. The quality of the picture and audio are both sharp and clear, you will never have to watch it again on VHS. The extras on the DVD are excellent. You get to see the Emmy award presentation, the making of the movie, as well as how Cicely was dressed to look the part of Miss Jane.

544204,5,630306020X,The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman remains a classic historical perspective for African Americans.  It is wonderfully made and will bring tears to the eyes of those old enough to remember the Civil Rights Movement and will educate those that have no knowledge of African American struggles.,1162512000,6,294,5.25531914893617
544205,5,630306020X,"Much has been said about the role that network television news played in shining a spotlight on Bull Connor and the rest of the racists in the Old South of the Fifties and Sixties, and those observations are correct. By the late Sixties, with the passage of landmark Civil Rights legislation and grudging acceptance by some that change was here to stay, real barriers began to be broken and doors opened. But, like all seismic shifts in culture, change would have to be reinforced to make it complete.

""The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman"" proved again what the small screen can do to change hearts. The measure of a truly great work of art is that it can be viewed in any number of settings and never have its impact diminished. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is nearly as mesmerizing on television as it was on the theatre screen, so groundbreaking was its approach to the question of human potentiality. In equal measure, ""Autobiography"" is worthy of the big screen, so artful and compelling is its treatment of the issue of human dignity.

Thanks to extraordinarily skillful makeup artists, but largely to her own meteoric talents, Cicely Tyson turns in a flawless performance that will never grow old. Her facial expressions, voice timber, eye movements - her complete persona - embody the convictions of a woman growing more mature, more realistic, but still never losing her hope and dreams. It is an astonishing performance that demands exposure to the widest possible audience.

The acting is so trueful and understated allowing the shear power of the subject matter presented to reach up and envelope the viewer.  The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman movie can change the coldest of bigoted hearts if you allow it to do so.  The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman teaches without preaching.  This movie is a beautiful strong black woman's unflinching look at a lifetime of the most hiddious ugliness possible in the hearts of so many in her community. Fiction Mrs Jane Pittman defeated with charm grace and defiant dignity the most potent bile hate and evil people in her world could muster and yet she rises above it all with a humble quiet dignity lost to so many in todays world.

I have been blessed to know real people who lived through the indignities portrayed on this DVD who have survived with the same quality of forgiving humble dignity and enhanced sense of self worth.  That people can survive the brutal banal atroscities born of hate in this country with the sense of inner peace shown in this DVD movie is entirely true for I have witnessed it in the hearts of some special people I have known.  When Mrs Pittman takes a drink from the Whites Only fountain I totally lose it crying like a baby because everything about the DVD builds so effectively to that piviotal moment that my heart leaps with joy when it finally happens.

This is one DVD I am honored to have in my collection, I am enriched far beyond the meager price I paid for this DVD for the priceless lesson it teaches me and all who watch it.  If I could buy just one more DVD in life this would be The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman, and I would purchase it reasons far too numerous to count or put into words.",1137542400,7,1881,4.441860465116279
544208,5,630306020X,"It surprises me how many people think that The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman is an actual biographical/autobiographical work. It is not -- it is fiction. It is a brilliantly crafted work interweaving historical references and recollections into an overall framework of the life of a woman born into slavery who survived to the point of the beginnings of the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s.

The style of the book made into a film is one of oral history. The editor interviewed and transcribed Miss Jane's stories beginning in 1962 and going on for nearly a year. The editor also talked to other people, particularly when Miss Jane would fall silent or forget things (he couldn't tell if she was doing this deliberately or not), and also talked to people after Miss Jane's funeral. Some of this is lost in the film, but the overall narrative flow does keep this flavour in the story.

In a small space, the author (who is to be distinguished from the editor, a character in the novel) shows his intention -- this is to be an overarching story of black experience from the Civil War to Civil Rights, seen primarily through the experience of one woman, but incorporating and representing the experiences of all others.

The telling of the tale begins in the Civil War, where Miss Jane is child (she can't actually remember when she was born). Her name at that point was Ticey. Her first story deals with negotiating the delicate balance between fleeing Confederate soldiers, arriving Union soldiers, and the dominant presence of the mistress of the plantation. It was a Union soldier who suggested the name of Jane to Ticey ('Ticey is a slave name' the corporal said). Thus she became Jane. Jane Brown, adopting the last name of the corporal.  These scenes are portrayed in the movie with strong performances.

Unfortunately for Jane, the mistress didn't like this, and tried to beat the name out of her. Jane refused to recant the name, and got put out in the field for her 'sass'. A year later, when the war ended, she set out for Ohio, the state where the corporal who named her had lived. The decision was a tough one -- the older folk didn't want to risk the journey, perhaps a case of better the devil you know. The young folks, however, were having none of the continuing presence of a master and mistress. They set out right away. Jane bid farewell to her Uncle Isom and set out with a group of people, some misfits, some smart.

Soon they had their first run-in with the forerunners of the Klan. From her hiding place, Jane watched the 'patrollers' kill Big Laura, the mother-figure of the group, and all of the rest of the travellers. Suddenly she was alone save for Ned, Big Laura's little boy. She was a mother figure right away. Being resourceful and pragmatic as a slave is forced to learn to be from earliest days, she grabbed the supplies and left with Ned, still hoping to travel to Ohio.

However, fortune and lack of proper directions led Jane and Ned into many encounters through the south, and when finding someone who has a map, they also come to the realisation that there might be difficulty in finding soldier Brown in Ohio. Which part of Ohio is he in?

Jane and Ned end up on a plantation, doing work like they had done before. Jane remained behind to experience ongoing strife and trouble, encountering carpetbagger politicians, business dealings, and abandonment. The plantation was purchased by an old Confederate office, Colonel Dye, and the people supporting the blacks all left. Cicely Tyson takes over the role as the adult Jane Pittman at this point, and does an absolutely stunning job at the part.

Ned left for the North, having changed his last name to Douglass, after Frederick Douglass. His life was in danger, so he had to go. After Ned left, Jane began her relationship with Joe Pittman; living together outside of marriage at first, which Jane justified in a way by explaining that black folk didn't have church marriages in slavery times, and they just weren't sure what to do now.

Joe and Jane left for east Texas for their own land after a time, after having an altercation with Colonel Dye over $150, plus surprise interest. Joe worked at breaking horses, becoming 'chief' Pittman, something of which both Joe and Jane were proud. Jane worked in a house as a servant. They did this for about ten years. Joe was killed by a horse no one could break, including Joe -- Jane had premonitions of the death, but Joe had to go 'a man's way'.

The story of Miss Jane continues apace through experience on another plantation and finally ending up in the Quarters. This is where she helped give birth to and raise Jimmy.

Anytime a child is born, the old people look in his face and ask him if he's the One. No, they don't say it out loud like I'm saying it to you now. Maybe they don't say it at all; maybe they just feel it -- but feel it they do. ""You the One?"" I'm sure Lena asked Jimmy that when she first held him in her arms. ""You the One, Jimmy? You the One?""

Jimmy was the one who would get Miss Jane involved in the Civil Rights struggle late in her life, a struggle which she had in fact been participating in all her life. Jimmy, like so many in Miss Jane's life, like so many in black experience, would end up being killed, this time over protests for drinking fountains and bathroom privileges. But as Miss Jane said, just part of him was dead.

The greater part of Jimmy was still alive, and with the courage and example of Miss Jane, they went to Bayonne to stand up for their rights. Miss Jane was affected by many events; Miss Jane finally stopped reacting and acted up.

The author of the story, Ernest Gaines, was born on a Louisiana plantation. His descriptions and situations are authentic and mesmerising, and these are captured well in the film. Cicely Tyson's portrayal of Miss Jane in the film is an endearing performance, but one misses much if one relies solely on the film (plus some of the details are changed, sometimes inexplicably). One thing I would recommend is watching the film and reading the book as companions to each other -- some of the dialogue in the film supplements the book (like Miss Jane's final speech to the reporter), and the book fills in (as all books do) many of the details glossed over in the film.",1136246400,51,6301,4.573581560283688

This was Cicley Tyson's first film after her Oscar nominated role in Sounder.  This solidified her status as the greatest black actress of the time.  She receive two Emmy Awards for this role (it was the year of the ""Super Emmy"").

This is the greatest TV movie of the 70's (probably ever) and should be required viewing for everyone.  Bravo to director John Korty and writer Tracy Keenan Wynn who both won Emmys along with the movie itself.",1133913600,10,792,4.406896551724138
544210,5,630306020X,"One advantage to getting old (well I'm past 50 anyway) is that I can allow myself to tear up and even outright bawl when a movie moves me, without worrying about what people will think.  The label of tearjerker is not necessarily seen as a compliment; the reputation of many films has suffered because American taste in general teaches us that to be moved to tears by a mere movie is somehow equated with being weak.  Well then, when it comes to this move, I am one of the weakest viewers in the history of motion pictures.

When unleashed on the public in 1974, this film was heralded by critics as the greatest made-for-TV movie ever.  More than 30 years later, that statement is still true.  It's certainly remained one of my favorite films, and not just of the ""made-for-TV"" variety.  This film is a powerful and emotional experience that has rarely seen its match among television or theatrical productions.

Cicely Tyson is Miss Jane Pitman, a 109 year-old former slave, who has been asked to reveal her memories to a magazine writer at the dawn of the modern civil rights movement.  I had read the book shortly before I saw the film, and was worried about what portions of the plot would have to be sacrificed to allow for the limited time allotted to a motion picture.  Happily, the answer is none - the screenwriter and director have managed to squeeze virtually all of Ernest J. Gaines amazing story into a 112 minute film.  And Ms. Tyson makes you believe every minute of the story; she is that skilled as an actress.

The interview starts with a ""freedom investigator"" played by Woody Chambliss (curiously, this character is never given a name in the film) asking Miss Jane for her earliest recollections.  ""How far back do you want to go?"" she asks, ""To the end of war?  I can do that"".  Hoping for something a little more special, he asks, ""Can you remember when they gave you your freedom?""  Miss Jane, her eyes full of wisdom, reflects for but a moment, and replies with simple conviction, ""I hope I never forget it"".  This is the first point in the film where tears begin to well up in my eyes.  What follows is a story so detailed, so harrowing, so horrible and so wonderful that it's easy to forget that this ""autobiography"" is fiction.  As Jane speaks, we are swept away and the old South, the REAL old South, comes hauntingly to life.  Reconstruction, segregation, white supremacy, the rise of the Klan, the struggles of poor blacks attempting an ever-frustrating search for equality, dignity and a fair share of the American dream - it's all there.  Miss Jane relates it all with such gripping, vivid detail that, for me, the trickle of tears that starts when she says, ""I hope I never forget it"" soon becomes a downpour of release.

Her conversations with the freedom investigator are lessons in wisdom, humility, dignity and respect.  At one point, she explains to him that she talks to an old oak tree, rationalizing that the tree is the only living thing around that has seen more than she has.  ""It's the nobility that you respects"" she says, and, of course, the moment highlights the great nobility of her own situation.

The film climaxes when Jane, upon learning of the death of Jimmy, a local civil-rights activist and the hope of many in her community, travels downtown in a show of defiance to finish what he set out to do: take a simple drink of water from the ""white only"" fountain at the courthouse.  The magazine writer, who has reluctantly been called back to cover another matter, instinctively follows when he sees Jane, seated proudly on her rocking chair on the back of a pickup truck, slowly make her way downtown.  Unaided, she slowly, proudly and with great dignity walk to the fountain.  Her way is momentarily blocked by the local sheriff, but what can he do?  He has known her as a dignified member of the community all his life; her status as an ex-slave, who bears the scars on her back from the days when she was a living piece of property, entitle her to respect and awe that no one can deny.  She moves past him nervously, but with great determination, and he must yield to this walking piece of American history, the shame of a century of repression gently but firmly nudging him aside.  As the town watches, black and white, old and young alike, they silently witness the validation of her life as her lips approach the cool stream of water aching up and waiting.  She drinks.  She turns.  She makes her way back home, unmolested.  A small triumph, maybe, but the symbolism is lost on no one, especially the audience.  As Jane makes her way to that monumental sip, the music swells (the soundtrack is filled with some of the most effective music I've ever heard) and the tears come pouring forth.  If you have witnessed even a small part of the civil rights struggle of the 1960's, it is impossible not to be moved.  If you are too young to remember and therefore appreciate what it was all about, a great education is waiting for you in this film.  You will watch, and you will finally understand.  A historian once said that you cannot understand America without understanding the Civil War.  I believe that this powerful movie can help almost anyone to put the civil rights struggle into perspective.

And there is no one who can say that tears shed for Miss Jane are anything but respect and awe for one of the most remarkable stories ever told.",1133654400,5,5404,4.5875
544261,5,630306020X,"I cannot possibly overstate the reputation this film had in the 1970's - it was considered one of the most monumental achievements in the history of television. Now nobody talks about it anymore.

With all the incredibly stupid notions Hollywood has for movie remakes (The Longest Yard? - are you kidding me?!) why doesn't somebody do this movie?! Maybe the funeral of Rosa Parks will help somebody there get a clue.",1130976000,4,416,4.859154929577465

The first time I watched this movie, I was a young girl.

This movie will be a great history lesson for your kids.

Cicely Tyson will always be one of the best...

544264,5,630306020X,"The gifted Cicely Tyson is a marvel as Jane, gradually transforming from a young girl to a wizened but still spirited lady of 100+ years. A revealing history lesson and tribute to the sturdy spirit of one human being who endured through periods of vast change, this important and touching film feeds both brain and heart. Widely recognized as a creative milestone in television programming, ""Pittman"" makes for ideal family viewing.",1125878400,2,432,5.098591549295775
544265,5,630306020X,"Like some reviewers, I first saw this as a child (age 9) in 1973 when it made it's television debut. This was one of my first glimpses into Black history, which would become my profession as an adult.

Overall, this DVD is the best version available. The special features do a good job of typing up loose ends on the final film and explaining the story.

This is a good case of fiction being pretty accurate with the facts. The end of slavery, Reconstruction, Jim Crow, and the Civil Rights movement are depicted with excellent attention to detail and actual incidents as a backdrop (aside from the nitpicky point of Black people wearing 70' style afros prior to 1962). This is good history for the masses. Although Jane Pittman and the other characters are fictional, what they experienced was not.

What Cicely Tyson says (in a 1974 clip) about the real Jane Pittmans of history bears repeating today.

Watch it,learn, and think.",1123459200,,931,4.728395061728395

544267,5,630306020X,"All I can add is that it's better than the book, at least in one significant way:  The book does not have the ending the movie has, and the book leaves one just hanging out there, while the movie brings the story to a beautiful climax.
Read the book (or listen to it on tape), and then watch the movie.  Awesome.  Having read the book after seeing the movie several times, I felt like I had been ripped off and couldn't believe the book ended at a dead end.  Thanks to the movie, my mood is repaired.",1086307200,4,500,4.123711340206185
544268,5,630306020X,"A 110-year-old former slave breaks a racially enforced law in the 1960s. Miss Pittman's haunting and often brutal journey, from a girl on a plantation to her involvement in the Civil Rights Movement, captivates in chains of pain and joy and releases in one of the most eloquent and powerful climaxes ever committed to paper and film.
Network executives in 1974 dismissed advertisers nervous about prudish viewer demographics and gave us THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MISS JANE PITTMAN. This bold and daring presentation, expertly compressed from Ernest J. Gaines' novel, mixes education and entertainment with a narrative quality reserved only for the best theatrical films. The miniseries ROOTS and the two-part SYBIL followed suit later in the decade.
THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MISS JANE PITTMAN, a rare gem in the vast slop of made-for-television movies, must not be missed. When you order it on tape or in its upcoming DVD format, it belongs not on a shelf but in your jewelry box.",1009324800,6,971,5.075
544269,5,630306020X,"I do not like to repeat myself and I cannot bestow any more praise on this noteworthy film. However, I have received a couple of condemnations because I stated that this is a work of fiction. There are some viewers that actually think there WAS a Jane Pittman. Some of these are so vehement in their views that when faced with proof of her being a creation of the brilliant mind of author Gaines, they still turn a ""blind eye."" One reader went so far as to accuse me, and others, of trying to hide the ""truth"" about past heroes.
Like most movies that are total fabrications of their creators' abilities, this one ends with the following disclaimer:
""The characters and events depicted in this teleplay are fictional. Any similarity between them and actual persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental.""
Would this be needed if Miss Jane Pittman were a real person?
The character is an inspiration to all. But, the ""life"" shown is one of skilled storytelling, nothing more.",1005436800,,975,4.707602339181286
