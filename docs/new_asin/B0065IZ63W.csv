8493429,3,B0065IZ63W,"This most competent (if somewhat dry) 1980 BBC miniseries of Dickens' sweeping tale set against the French Revolution stars Paul Shelley (who plays the roles of both Carton and Darnay), along with the lovely Sally Osborne as Lucie; and the revered Pinter muse/interpretist Vivien Merchant as Pross.

When Lucie Manette (Sally Osborne) travels to Paris to retrieve her father, long believed dead, from the horrors of the Bastille, she meets by chance the dashing French aristocrat Charles Darnay (Shelley).  Back in London, Lucie and Charles marry, whilst in Paris the citizens rise to reclaim their independence from their oppressive lords and masters.  Unbeknownst to Lucie and their friends, Charles hides a secret familial connection to one of the most reviled members of the Parisian aristocracy, and when he is lured back to Paris to help one of his imprisoned former servants, his fate looks to be sealed...

That is essentially the crux of the plot, but in typical Dickens fashion, the central story is surrounded by a catalogue of supporting characters and their various subplots.  The BBC's production values (which now look quite crude and rough in the light of more recent productions) are well-intentioned, and if Michael E. Briant's teleplay sucks out a good deal of the story's excitement, especially in the early episodes, he more than compensates in the last two instalments which are tensely-plotted and played with great skill by the cast (the confrontation scene between Miss Pross and Madame Defarge - chillingly played by Judy Parfitt - is a highlight).

Having Sydney and Charles played by the same actor seems a bit gimmicky but Paul Shelley manages to maintain a few individual traits for each character (I prefer his sardonic Sydney to wishy-washy Charles though).  The lovely Sally Osborne should have had a long career in period drama (she later appeared as the kindly Miss Temple in the BBC's 1983 miniseries of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jane-Eyre/dp/B000784WMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jane Eyre</a>) but she seems to have dropped off the radar.
