Dave Wright's well-researched documentary reveals the truth behind the somewhat glamorized earlier accounts of Baby Doe's life. Enlightening, detailed, educational-- with a bit of western flair!  Wright has a way of getting you into the ""feel"" of the times in the mid-19th to early 20th centuries mining, every day life and the great wealth that was made. I enjoyed this series very much and look forward to more of Wright's work on Colorado's colorful history.",990748800,,590,4.94949494949495
8324448,3,0970792514,"You can only enjoy this series if you are a history buff.
I found the whole series very informative and well done.  It leads you through the entire life of Horace Tabor and his story in Colorado.
It answers a lot of unansered questions about the story behind Tabor's romance with Baby Doe.
