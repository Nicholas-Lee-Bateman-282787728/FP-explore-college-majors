2756988,4,6300256553,"Previously only available on VHS, SHOOT THE SUN DOWN finally gets the Blu-ray treatment. Any fan of Christopher Walken can rejoice at this starring role for him, as a bad-ass, knife-throwing, soft-spoken, gun-slinging bounty-hunter. He looks very young in this (1978 was right before  he made THE DEER HUNTER), and every bit the leading man. The story is about a race for buried treasure set in Santa Fe in the Old West. Also appearing is a young and crafty Margot Kidder (right before she did Superman) and the ever-charming Geoffrey Lewis, who almost steals the show as the filthy scheming scoundrel. SHOOT THE SUN DOWN is one of those old-school films that takes its time setting the tone and letting the story play-out at its own pace. Probably too slow for some, but definitely worth your time. It is TREASURE ON THE SIERRA MADRE meets ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST.",1384646400,5,870,4.723684210526316
2756989,4,6300256553,"I had great time seeing this cult classic western.  I'm a fan of the genre, and I love seeing lesser known films.  The plot has it's weaknesses, but seeing Margot Kidder, Christopher Walken, Geoffrey Lewis, and A. Martinez before any of them were well known actors was amazing.  Great chemistry between this group.  Incredibly beautiful visuals, places in the southwest I've only dreamed of going.  It has a slow, almost ""French"" pace, with pauses and silence that speak loud and clear.  A lot of fun overall.",1384387200,4,509,4.8604651162790695
2756990,4,6300256553,"I just saw a special screening of the Blu-ray of Shoot The Sun Down in Los Angeles. It was terrific. The performances, especially Walken, Kidder, and Lewis were excellent. Well acted throughout. The visuals were amazing. One of the most beautiful westerns I've ever seen. Yes, the pace was a little slow, but slow like in French films where you really inhabit the space with the characters and the silences are so pregnant. All in all, a real trip, and  a must for fans of the genre or Waken.",1384214400,2,492,4.52808988764045
2756991,4,6300256553,"Did not know what to expect when I went to a screening at the AERO Theatre in SM to see a movie that has essentially been ""lost"" for almost 40 years. Stylistically, it was as if John Ford, Sergio Leone, & Quentin Tarantino made a movie and hired whoever scored Logan's Run for the soundtrack. Yes, sounds a bit ambitious (and probably odd as well), but it worked for me. Despite some ""thinness"" in the story at times, Geoffrey Lewis' part is well-written, acted & very entertaining to watch. Walken plays his part with brilliant minimalism, forcing you to study every nuance in his face & Kidder is believable as a woman of ""ill-repute"" searching for her chance to escape indentured servitude. The writer/ director does a nice job of weaving tragedy, treachery, & futility throughout the film. I felt like I was among a privileged few to open a time capsule of a bygone era in which a student film collided with an innovative concept & features household name actors before they were household names.",1384214400,4,1000,4.6875
2756992,3,6300256553,"While the movie isn't Oscar material, its typical of the times and fun to watch.  More importantly, its great to see a less than well known movie from that time released.  It tells me perhaps others, like ""The Farmer"", will find their way back and become available for once.",1384214400,4,274,4.571428571428571
2756993,4,6300256553,"I just saw this film at a screening in Santa Monica and was quite impressed.  Stunning visuals, and it was great to see Walken and Kidder pre The Deer Hunter and Superman.  The performances and interactions were very good, and the dance of the intersecting characters very interesting.  The film was obviously influenced by Sergio Leone and Kurosawa, but there was also a feeling of French new wave cinema in the sense that the scenes had real three dimensional space, where silence and pauses said as much as words.  Felt like I was ""in the moment"".",1384041600,3,550,4.697916666666667
2756994,2,6300256553,"Just reading the movie description and looking at the movie jacket has turned me off. Why do these directors seem to think that the audience is ignorant? the jacket for this depicts a cowboy holding an 1873 colt. The movie description tells us the setting is 1836. So my next question is what will the costuming be like, drop rigs and belt loop pants with the ""ladies"" wearing prom dresses? If this has been on the cutting room floor for 30 years maybe it should have stayed there -- just sayin but then 30 years ago no one paid any attention to details so I'll give it 2 stars.",1381968000,,578,4.3119266055045875
2756995,2,6300256553,"I have seen part of this film on broadcast TV (with bad reception) a long time ago.  I would like to see the whole thing, but am not sure I want to buy it to do so--I've read a few actual reviews--none good.

But...Chris Walken has a fun role, Margot Kidder (before her breakdown), along with a number of other respectable actors all do a decent job.

The section of the film I've seen, perhaps 30 minutes, follows the troop of this idiosyncratic quest through the Mexican desert, in an attempt, I believe, to find Montezuma's gold--using a giant, carved disk of rock (think 8 foot diameter, foot thick Mayan calender) as a map...

If you like strange bits of cinema, and you can find a copy of this, I'd check it out, but I don't know enough to say you will actually like it...",1159228800,6,778,4.344827586206897

8175080,4,6300256553,I bought this because I was curious to see what kind of a part Christopher Walken would be playing in a western.  The movie was entertaining and I really enjoyed watching the very young Christopher Walken performing.,1397692800,,216,4.837837837837838
8175081,1,6300256553,"The plot was totally predictable, the acting was poor at best, the whole thing dragged on and on.  Every aspect of the movie was poorly done. I should have stopped it early on when the electric power lines could be seen in the background.  This was an excellent example of the worst of movie making.",1389225600,,299,4.418181818181818
8175082,3,6300256553,"not bad... pretty cool character played by Walken.... Kiddler is sexier than she was as Lois Lane... and Lewis is finally a formidable foe, instead of the goof he plays in so many movies.

it was a good attempt to copy the magic and uniqueness of sergio leone's westerns starring Clint Eastwood... however the acting, editing, music, and story I thought all just fell a little short.

this would be worth paying $10 for a DVD, but only the Blu-Ray is out right now (December 2013) so, I don't know about $25.",1386028800,2,508,4.510869565217392
