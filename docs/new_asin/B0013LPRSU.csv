8252097,5,B0013LPRSU,"This delightful visit to ""Kid's Camp"" held in Curacao is educational & fun to watch for all ages. We also understand Curacao is one of the most treasured areas to 'snorkel'. In addition, it shows 'Swimming with the Dolphins' in their natural setting. Brittney does an outstanding job with the dolphins, which includes a special 'Show' where the dolphins play with her, carry her and bring her safely to the dock. If swimming with the dolphins is a dream of yours, this is a great video to watch.",1364256000,,495,4.636363636363637
