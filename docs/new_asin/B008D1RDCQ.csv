5152931,5,B008D1RDCQ,"These are the two best films of the Prophecy franchise, & they are on one blu-ray disc.
I actually like the 2nd film  a bit more than the first film.
The PQ and AQ on the blu are pretty decent IMO.
Recommended for fans of the Prophecy series.",1362700800,3,242,4.041666666666667
5152932,4,B008D1RDCQ,"Nice looking blu-ray is bare bones but does feature the only two of this franchise worth owning.  Gregory Widen writes and directs the first Prophecy, a clever and often very creepy horror flick concerning a second war in Heaven spilling out onto the Earth. Jealous over the attention God has given humankind, the Archangel Gabriel (Christopher Walken) has waged a war that has lasted centuries. But, if he can acquire the soul of a heinously evil human general who has recently died, it could turn the tide. But, loyal angel Samuel (Eric Stoltz) has hidden the soul in a little girl, Mary (Moriah Snyder) and now it's up to ex-priest turned cop, Thomas (Elias Koteas) and school teacher, Katherine (Virginia Madsen) to stop Gabriel from getting the soul from Mary. Complicating matters is a third party, Lucifer (Viggo Mortensen) who has an invested interest in how this situation plays out. Widen gives this film a nice atmosphere and creatively weaves Bible scripture into this very original and effective horror, as well as, gives some very good dialog for star Walken and Mortensen's Lucifer to chew on. He also has a nice visual style and makes good use of a small budget. He gets good performances from all the cast with Koteas really convincing as a man who has lost his faith now faced with defending the God he turned away from and Madsen making a strong willed heroine forced to stand against the unthinkable. Obviously, thought, it is Walken who takes his role and runs with it with his sinister and quirky performance as the vengeful Gabriel. But, not to be overlooked, is Viggo Mortensen giving one of the creepiest representations of Satan on film. His fallen angel is dripping with evil and malice and delivers Widen's dialog with an unsettling restraint that is a perfect contrast to Walken's more over the top Gabriel. A witty, original, unnerving and very entertaining horror. Direct to DVD sequel, Prophecy 2, actually isn't bad. Can't compare to the original but, it is entertaining. Story has Gabriel (Christopher Walken) continuing his war to take control of Heaven. A loyal angel, Danyael (Russell Wong) impregnates a human woman, Valerie (Jennifer Beals) to create a Nephilim, a human/angel hybrid who is prophesied to unite the angels and end the second war. Gabriel now must hunt down Valerie and destroy her unborn child before it can ruin his plans to take over Heaven. Greg Spence writes and directs this time and doesn't quite have the cleverness or style that Gregory Widen had but, he directs competently and gives the sequel a brisk pace and Walken is once again worth watching for his quirky and sinister Gabriel. The rest of the cast is fine with Beals giving a strong and sympathetic performance as a woman fighting supernatural odds to save her child and Russel Wong bringing a strong nobility to Danyael. Also staring Brittany Murphy as a suicidal girl Gabriel uses as his human familiar and Eric Roberts as the angel Michael. Not bad as direct to DVD sequels go. Fans of the original will probably be entertained.",1362268800,,3053,4.871153846153846

8526908,4,B008D1RDCQ,"Prophecy is a interesting film . It was filmed 1995, But Released in 1998. The casting of Christopher Walken made this film a semi hit .
This was directed by Gregory Widen the mind behind "" Highlander "" . Considering the low budget , the costuming of the Angels in what we now steampunk style , the Angels are wearing Frock coats and crouching on the edge of a chair gives a look of a bird wings due to draping of the rear of the frock coats . There is one particular scene where one of the Angels Simon played by Eric Stoltz is sitting on top of a chair back rest , he looked just a bird on branch . This show how a lower budget can give us more interesting scenes ,and narrative, As far second Film go's . It is direct to video and even a lower budget , But interesting . Ninety percent of the sequel is filmed at night which is effective cost cutting exercise , It is watchable, especially with Christopher Walken again as the Archangel Gabriel.",1404345600,,948,4.185792349726776

8526910,4,B008D1RDCQ,A great price for a 2-disc blu-ray set.  The first movie in particular is a classic for fans of this type of horror.,1365811200,,116,4.043478260869565
