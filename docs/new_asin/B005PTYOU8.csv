4857549,5,B005PTYOU8,LOVE LOVE LOVE...enough said... great workout for anyone if you love boxing and weights. I used weighted gloves throughout the entire workout.,1394755200,3,142,5.5

8482680,5,B005PTYOU8,I did the boxing workout on this dvd last night with one lb weighted gloves. I thought it was great. I was pouring sweat by the end of it. But like they say sweat is fat crying. I definitely recommend this workout to everyone. If you don't have the weighted gloves I highly recommend them to up your workout intensity. I am really sore today. But that is a great thing. Love Kelly Coffey Meyer workouts! She is an incredible trainer.,1482883200,4,433,4.3580246913580245

8482682,3,B005PTYOU8,"It's a good more or less steady state cardio. It's not super tough if you exercise regularly, but it is still good. As with all the 30 min to fitness series there are also many premixes to pick from so the length and combination can be decided each time.",1461196800,,254,4.204081632653061
8482683,5,B005PTYOU8,I love this exercise video.  It is challenging but most of all fun.  I have bought about 15 of Kelly Coffey-Meyers dvd's and I have not been disappointed.  It is a great workout.,1458777600,3,178,4.333333333333333
8482684,5,B005PTYOU8,"I just finished this workout and feel obligated to take a few minutes to write a review.  I LOVE this workout. Ive been doing it for about three months.  It is fun, energizing, and intense.  I love Kelly.  I love the music.  I love how I can FEEL my muscles working and getting stronger doing the workout.  I never realized that punching the air could work your core muscles so well and be so tiring!  I love how there are so many options in this exercise DVD, which allow you to customize your workout, depending on how much time you have, or which part of the body you want to work.  There is Workout #1 (boxing) and Workout #2 (conditioning, which includes challenging exercises for upper and lower body, including abs).  Kelly has included premixes which offer variety and flexibility.  Many of the options can be chosen individually, and many are components of her premixes.

I probably would not recommend this DVD for beginners, although she does have Lauren doing modified moves.  Even if you are at an intermediate level, the boxing routines can be frustrating at first.  It took me a few weeks to become fluid in the moves and really enjoy and get into the workout.  I started without gloves and worked up to 1 lb. gloves, which is what Kelly and her crew wear.  Kelly also does a lot of squats and some twisting/pivoting which are great, but not for someone with knee issues.

My first Kelly Coffey-Meyer DVD was 30-Minutes to Fitness, STEP Boxing.  I loved that one so much that I bought TLC-Train Like a Contender and a few others.  I have 30-Minutes to Fitness-Plateau Buster, 30-Minutes to Fitness-Muscle Up/Lift 2B Fit, 30-Minutes to Fitness-Cardio Pump, and 30-Minutes to Fitness-Weights. I plan on buying more as my budget allows.  I will try to come on in the future and write more reviews.  (By the way, I am 52 years old and have lost about 35 pounds this past year. I would like to lose about 5 more, but I feel great and fit!  I got back into exercising about a year ago by walking on the treadmill and doing my old Kathy Smith STEP videos, and Jane Fonda STEP video. I did the Karen Voight Ultimate STEP Circuit for a few months, and I also do the Ageless with Kathy Smith-Staying Strong DVD. I walk outside when it is nice, and after my treadmill broke, hauled my old Nordic-Track out of storage.)",1458000000,5,2322,4.520383693045564
8482685,2,B005PTYOU8,Kelly seems great and the workout itself is very good as long as the play controls of this DVD actually works. The editing is horrendous. Some sections just won't play. It freezes. I spend more time trying to get this to play rather than working out. I missed the return date window; otherwise this was a waste.,1428624000,,311,4.473684210526316
8482686,5,B005PTYOU8,one of my favorite!,1410134400,,19,4.0
8482687,4,B005PTYOU8,"Bought this for days when I didn't feel like doing a high intensity Cathe workout. It's well produced and her queuing is good. I would say this is more intermediate level. I only workout at home and years ago began collecting only Cathe videos. Since converting to all her videos, Kelly is the only other instructor that I enjoy .I have a few of her earlier workouts and like those as well.",1407888000,,390,4.430555555555555
8482688,5,B005PTYOU8,"Kelly Coffey-Meyers' workouts are great--based on athletic/boxing moves, very vigorous but she shows modifications. Love the music, love Kelly's attitude and presence, she's so professional. I used to do a lot of Jillian Michaels' workouts but found they killed my knees and back. I've replaced them with this dvd, Your Best Body, and Cardiokickboxing--all by Kelly Coffey. Much better.",1397433600,4,386,5.559322033898305
