The movie begins with a flatbed truck carrying a tall load, a statue of a dinosaur. The whim of a movie producer? A symbol of the past? There is a book that sold 4 million copies because of its human interest. An actor has pain from a muscle that isn't being used. Can a writer use a book's title to create a hit movie? There is a meeting where the executives discuss business. [Subtle humor?] ""88% of people polled like the title!"" [Is the grass always greener on the other guy's lawn?] Do these characters remind you of the ""Dilbert"" comic strip? They view old movies for inspiration. ""He wouldn't let you down."" They go to see a movie star. [The story begins to drag here.] ""I'm only kidding."" Did they come at the wrong time? [Not a funny parody.]

That writer talks to his wife. Another man talks to his wife. The writer, Herb, suggests he is not right for this project. Can he get inspiration from mundane scenes? [Can the conversations get any more inane? Yes.] The Committee discusses the movie. A newspaper article has a story. Can you believe everything in a newspaper? [No.] The Board doesn't like that dinosaur statue. A conflict over opinions? [De gustibus et coloribus non est disputandum.] ""Dare to be great."" Joe falls at the wedding, and goes to the hospital. Joe has another idea about a movie. Herb works on it. Will things get better for Herb and his wife? Why not?

This is an inane and boring movie. I guess it was made as a parody or satire of Hollywood, an in-joke for the people who made this movie. You have been warned.",1303776000,5,1577,4.46875
