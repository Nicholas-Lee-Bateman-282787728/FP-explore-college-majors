8024467,5,B00029NM22,"This is off-beat, intelligent, laugh-out-loud and unexpected.  David Paymer has given up on the theater for a life of writing dull sit-coms.  A ""friend"" (Judge Reinhold) who goes to film school has been given the assignment ""interiors"" and is surreptitiously doing a documentary about David, the most ""interior"" man he knows.  He interviews David's friends and family, giving a lot of great cameo comedians a chance to muse hilariously about what's wrong with David.  You'll love Peter Falk and Bea Arthur as the parents, and Marilu Henner as the lunch date from not exactly hell (maybe Uranus?).  Most of all, you'll love David Paymer, a master of comic understatement. This film was finished shortly after 9/11/01, a bad time for comedy to find a distributor.  I was shown the film back then by one of its producers, and am delighted to finally buy it on DVD.  A great find.",1389139200,,876,4.8389261744966445
