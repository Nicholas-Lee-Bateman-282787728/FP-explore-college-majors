5889454,1,B00E44FEAE,"This film has a great soundtrack. The review goes downhill from here, way down hill. It reminded me of when you have to write a term paper and have a good idea, and plan to bring it all together at the end, and tie up all the loose ends nicely.
Then, you get tired of doing it, time is running out, and so you take all your ideas to make your point at the end, and jumble them all together in an incomprehensible mess that make no sense whatsoever.

To say that the acting by some of the actors in the film seemed ""wooden"" is an understatement. It was like they were reading their cue cards on the side and not quite comprehending just what scene they were in and what it was about.

I was tired of this thing about one third of the way through it. I wonder if anybody out there is in contact with Sean Lockart? If you are, please ask him if he would refund the money I spent on his movie. If this were an undergrad paper, it would get a D. If it was a grad school paper, the instructor would send it back and tell the student to start again.

I did not include any comment about what the story of the film itself is supposed to be about ,because the reader can get that information from several sources.

Lots of other independant films to recommend, not this one, however.",1387670400,2,1274,4.125

5889456,3,B00E44FEAE,"Following his return from a tour of duty in Afghanistan, Chris is having problems adapting to life in San Diego.  After several job offers fell through, Chris reluctantly agrees to a proposition from a young woman, whose brother died in Chris unit overseas.  She hires Chris to seduce and kill Andrew, her brothers lover, in order to receive a valuable inheritance that would otherwise go to him.

This film is directed by Sean Paul Lockhart, aka gay porns Brett Corrigan, who also plays Andrew.  Judging by Lockharts long-winded introduction that preceded the film on the DVD, I wasn't expecting much, but it was somewhat better than my reduced expectations.  The plot is far-fetched and far from cohesive, some scenes are stretched out way too long, and the acting by the secondary characters is cartoonish.  Still, the story does provide some suspense, and the final reveal is something I was not expecting, so Ill give them three stars out of five for effort and eye-candy.  Unrated, but would be a solid R for male nudity and simulated sexual situations.  DVD bonuses include outtakes, a music video and a behind the scenes feature.",1385942400,7,1137,4.9162303664921465
5889457,3,B00E44FEAE,"I am a big fan of indie cinema and they are often timely reminders to the big studios as to just how good and innovative films can be. This is not one of those films - sadly. It starts with the star and director, Sean Paul Lockhart (Andrew), doing a piece to camera explaining why he made such a great film and how they all put `blood sweat and tears' into the production. Actually judging from some of the scenes there were probably a few other bodily fluids thrown into the mix too.

We then have a veteran of Afghanistan, Jack Brocket playing Chris, he has returned with PTSD and just wants a job, but instead winds up getting hired as a hit man. This is to kill another vet who has inherited a fortune from his now dead gay, soldier lover and whose half sister will then get the lot if Andrew goes to the big gay disco in the sky. So begins his courtship of Andrew.

This is gay and so as such there are what can only be called `gratuitous shower scenes', some bedroom action and some nudity. I think it might have been me but the plot is so ludicrous that I stopped caring. Scooby Doo has better thought out plots and the acting lacked more conviction than a hedge fund manager trying to explain why he deserves a bonus. The sound levels vary in places and the CGI action is poor. The two leads are good looking but there needs to be more than good looking guys who are allergic to wearing their shirts to make a film more than just a pre watershed porno. So sorry good effort but no cigar and all that - it is not disastrous hence my rating but there are too many issues to make this anything approaching `good'.",1385164800,15,1618,4.216129032258064
5889458,3,B00E44FEAE,"What can I say, the movie was decent -- at best.

It really felt like an extremely low budget production that was filmed by a college student who decided to take on the project for their class final exam. The video quality looked like those used on Soaps and the script had glaring holes in it.

However, despite the issues I had with the film, I'm a sucker for cute looking guys playing in gay themed movies. It was still a half way decent movie to watch, but I won't be buying it on DVD.",1384214400,12,489,4.136842105263158

5889473,3,B00E44FEAE,"I was very excited about this movie. I do think Sean Paul Lockhart did himself a disservice not giving the acting part of this movie his all. He is a pretty good actor and I think he came off a bit fake or amateurish as an actor in this movie. Not his best work. There were many things in the movie that didn't make sense or seemed quite unlikely and common sense movie mistakes so I can only give it an OK. I would have preferred longer love scenes with him and Jack. I do recommend seeing it, just know it isn't Sean's best work, not bad for his first time starring and directing though, he still has a lot to learn, but that will come with experience.",1436400000,,654,4.1171875

5889475,4,B00E44FEAE,"Triple Crossed is a movie that requires close attention. Clues and explanatory resolutions are shown behind opening and closing credits. NB: Don't leave the DVD the moment the movie ends. A worn out veteran (with possible PTS) named Chris Jensen (played by newcomer Jack Brockett) returns from the Afghan wars and settles down in California. He faces difficulty in adjusting to his new life and finds potential employers unwilling to hire a veteran who also appears to be ""damaged goods"".  Suddenly, out of the blue, he is approached by an attractive and forceful young lady who somehow finds out about him and offers considerable compensation for a job requiring his ""special talents"".  All he has to do is kill the former lover of her late brother who also served but died in Afghanistan and left 51% of his father's company to his lover (Andrew Warner, played by Sean Paul Lockhart who also directs).  The sister wants it all. The problem now is how to get close to Andrew and then make his death appear as an accident. A contrived plan to meet Andrew during a jog in the park works and gradually the two begin to bond over a period of time. Unexpected feelings on the part of Chris towards Andrew emerge. Andrew comes off as a really nice guy and Chris's own inherent sense of decency and his new relationship with Andrew (both emotional and sexual) serves as a blockade to fulfilling his latest mission.  The sister (well played by Laura Reilly) becomes more and more impatient and demanding. Time is running out. From this point on the pace of the movie rapidly picks up. Without giving anything away (NO SPOILERS HERE), the question for Chris is whether or not to dispatch Andrew as planned; make believe that he has done the dirty deed (Andrew doesn't really care about his inheritance) and fool the sister into believing he has; and how to deal with the sister in general who Chris really doesn't like nor trust. To say any more would be giving too much away. Suffice it to say, as is the case with most ""murder mysteries"", all is not as it appears and this film's title and subsequent information are the best clues. The ending is a humdinger. I did not give the movie 5 stars because the credulity of certain segments seemed a bit too stretched. A nice extra deals with the making of the film - which also contains some very pleasing ""eye candy"".  The movie is ""unrated"" for obvious reasons (a hard ""R"" might apply).
The ending to this film is worth the price of admission.",1435622400,,2484,4.62358276643991
5889476,3,B00E44FEAE,"Just finished watching ""Triple Crossed""  released by Balaloo Studios through TLA Releasing.
""Triple Crossed"" can best be described as a modern crime noir movie that centers around homeless Army veteran Chris Jensen, who is living in his car after being discharged from tour of duty in Afghanistan.  Jensen, while trying to find a job and an affordable apartment, while also trying to get his veteran's benefits; is called by a young woman who is offering a job - only not the type of job he thinks.
Suffering from PTSD, Jensen has been self-medicating with illegal drugs and alcohol to blunt the memories of the war.
Jensen is informed by the pool side interview that he failed the drug test; but that she does have a job for him - kill her dead brother's partner so that she can inherit the entire company and he can have $50K and a shot at a new life.
Jensen reluctantly decides to take her up on her offer - kill Andrew Warner; or does he?
""Triple Crossed"" is NO ""Double Indemnity"" - not buy a long shot.  Yet, ""Triple Crossed"" is an intriguing mystery that lures the viewer in and makes him wonder who is double crossing who.
Perhaps the best line in the entire movie is when Andrew waves a gun around and shouts:  ""Hello, angry ex-boy friend here with a gun!""
Recommended.

5889498,1,B00E44FEAE,"Well, the premise/plot of this movie started out in a credible manner and then descended into the implausible, then the ludicrous, the absurd and then the utterly ridiculous. The notion of gay military personnel with partners on the civilian side living their lives while anxious for their partner to return is very current. That premise in and of itself is a story worth telling. To ineptly add all the layers of treachery and betrayal and implausible situations, just makes it a soap opera. I know that finding a motivation is important, but knowing how to do that in a new way, is the art of film making. Sean Lockhart (aka Brent Corrigan, pornographic movie actor who was unintentionally--and not criminally--involved in a notorious homicide years ago), is probably one of the most handsome fellows around and is demonstrating his somewhat credible acting skills and technique in role after role. Even in the context of movies that aren't so good overall, Sean is showing some ability to really act. This film was written by, directed by and stars Sean. In general, my feeling is that projects that are written, directed, and star the same person, require a lot of talent from beginning to end. It is an enormous effort and weakness in any area (the acting, the story or the direction) can doom the project.  Sean is apparently ambitious, but at this stage of his ""legit"" career, he should collaborate and become excellent in one area of the business at a time. I have the feeling Sean will continue to challenge himself and find a different voice that makes a contribution not just to gay cinema, but mainstream cinema as well. I give Sean an ""A"" for effort and ambition, but the movie is a clear ""F."" Not the sort of work you want on your resume, but if Sean learned a lot, maybe it was worth it...at least for him.",1409788800,3,1821,4.690625

Sean Lockhart and the male lead are both extremely good looking and there is some nudity and a few sex scenes which are not bad, and that is is the good part of the movie.  You have to know if you watch many gay themed movies and I do, that the acting is always bad and low budget and this is no exception. I tried to overlook that when it started but the from the get go the plot was silly, and the actors were merely phoning in the performances. If you want eye candy it is nice but if you want a story skip it and the ending was the most pathetic thing I have ever seen.

I think the intention was to make an ""erotic"" thriller in the tradition of other thrillers like Body Heat etc but of course with a gay perspective. Unfortunately while not terrible, the skills of those behind the camera, and the screenplay are not up to the task. The pacing is slow, and the obvious plot takes too long to unfold, and some technical aspects including sound are not up to par. When it comes to films aimed at a specific audience, does one say, well in this particular category ie movies designed for a gay audience, this movie is better than average, or does one rate it on the basis of all movies regardless of category. I respect that attempt of these film makers. I've certainly seen much worse. Some of these movies are impossible to get through.

5889525,5,B00E44FEAE,"First you need to understand that I have a great respect for Sean Paul Lockhart. Controversial though he may be, he is an example of a young man who has a plan and is following it. He not only convinced a skeptical adult film industry that he was old enough to do it (when he wasn't of legal age), he then became a successful participant. Something those much older never achieved. Always moving forward, he moved into Gay film and is successful in that arena. Taking the next step, ""Triple Crossed"" is his debut as a director, while holding a major role in the film. Sean Lockhart is a genuinely nice young man, and aside from his entry into the adult world, has proven that he is honest. I wish Mr. Lockhart all the best in his future. The movie ""Triple Crossed"" is well written, an uncomplicated story line, but have to admit  I didn't see it coming. Well worth viewing, holds your interest, you actually like the characters. Jack Brockett made his acting debut, and has great appeal. I own this film and recommend it. I also look forward to new film starring and/or directed by Mr. Lockhart.",1390003200,4,1095,4.50251256281407

8600830,3,B00E44FEAE,"My grandmother used an expression: ""doubledutchdamn"". I was never sure what the origin of it was, but it wasn't an expletive. It was an expression of profound disappointment. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't have a rating like that because it would be perfect for ""Triple Crossed"". With just a little more work - low budget, indiegogo or not - director/star Sean Paul Leonard *could* have made a tight, suspenseful thriller. IF only he'd ridden the screenwriter, Linda Anderson,  a little harder and had her at least try to darn up some of the holes in the plot. But the resolution depends on information the audience doesn't get until the climax. And that's a cheat. IF only Leonard had ridden himself and his co-stars a little harder and really done some acting - at least enough to create tension in a genre that depends on it - the production values wouldn't matter (I can forgive almost anything if I can believe the acting). But as physically attractive as these players are, Leonard lets himself and the others deliver lines so flatly that it seems like rote recitation or, going to the other extreme, they're chewing scenery like it was the last ham sandwich at the deli where they were all waiting to be discovered. And that's a shame - there are flashes in script, in Laura Reilly's performance as the murderous sibling and especially in Brockett's performance as the vet with PTSD and even in Leonard's own performance as the intended victim - that made me think that with a more rigorous director at the helm, this could have been so much better. For whatever reason, he tried to substitute a hefty amount of full frontal male nudity and sexual behavior for character development. On the one hand, no complaints: Leonard and Brockett are easy to look at. On the other hand, it quickly becomes apparent that he's relying on it to distract from the film's shortcomings. So why 3 ""doubledutchdamn"" stars? Because it's clever, easy to watch, but, sadly, also easy to forget.",1506038400,,1979,4.803519061583578

8600834,3,B00E44FEAE,"The triple cross was clever and unexpected.  Otherwise the movie is cliche and corny.  Too much stupid behavior including gratuitous sex in situations where anyone would be too anxious to get it up - but maybe if you are stupid enough to put yourself in that situation to begin with, you might be too stupid to experience anxiety.",1488672000,2,330,4.672413793103448
8600835,2,B00E44FEAE,"I tend to give low budget productions a pass in so many areas because, given the rigors of the artform, it is truly a miracle that they are completed at all with their miniscule budgets. That said, this film does not deserve much forgiveness. The screenplay is a mess and the story fairly ridiculous, but more importantly, even if it had been re-written and the plot holes filled, this story should never have been attempted on a shoestring budget.

The direction was, for the most part, competent and the performances about average for an indie film of this type.

One cannot make a good film from a bad screenplay, but everybody involved in Triple Crossed gave it their best shot.",1485388800,,682,4.675
