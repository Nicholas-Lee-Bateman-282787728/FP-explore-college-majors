I would have given the review an additional star if it included a French song or two to make it more fun. Otherwise, it is great for learning French for the entire family.",1280275200,,337,4.2
3010359,3,B000Y0J36S,"My son and I love this video, along with the other two we purchased in this series. So what's the problem? The English subtitles are set as the default, and whenever I put the DVD in, I always have to go back to the menu and turn off the subtitles. Why do people want subtitles in English when they are immersing their children in the foreign language? It just confuses everything and it's annoying to have to turn them off all the time. Many parents who order this DVD already know French and even those who don't can figure out what is being said from context (it is not exactly Derrida, after all).",1266624000,,601,4.327433628318584
3010360,5,B000Y0J36S,"This program is of an amazing quality. The images are clear and engaging, with bright colors and friendly faces. The sound is perfect with a clear well articulated standard French (beware it is not the case of all the programs out there and I'm a native I can tell). Also very important the article is said in front of each words (again beware it is skipped in some other of programs). Kids love it. Ah! finally a way to get half an hour to myself without any guilt.",1222300800,5,466,4.306818181818182
3010361,5,B000Y0J36S,"I just showed the Little Pim DVD in French to my one year old niece.  It was a big hit.  She was smiling at the animated panda and the real children doing every things like eating and playing.  I wasn't sure if a baby would really be engaged with a language video, but it was clear that she was noticing the sounds and activities.  I was really impressed by the quality of this video.  The colors are bright and clear, the real children in the video are multi-ethnic, and the narration is easy to understand.  I haven't studied French since college, but it began to come back to me just hearing the words repeated.  After they left, I watched it again with subtitles, and was pleased to realize that I had learned a bit, too!  I'm planning on buying Little Pim in both Spanish and Chinese for my niece and the rest of the babies in the family.  I only wish Little Pim had been available when my daughter was a baby!

8230456,4,B000Y0J36S,Pim was recommended to me. At first my daughter wasn't interested so I was skeptical and then 2 yrs later she loves Pim watches it and repeats the lessons constantly.,1398556800,,166,4.566666666666666
8230457,5,B000Y0J36S,"this is amazing for young kids, my baby is trilingual and I would love it if he can learn a bunch of other languages.  It is very fun to watch him repeat every word!",1371168000,,165,3.8529411764705883
8230458,2,B000Y0J36S,"I was very disappointed by this DVD. My 3 yr was not interested for more than 5 minutes. Also, they don't tell you what they're saying in english, making difficult for a child to figure it out.",1364860800,,193,4.243243243243243
8230459,3,B000Y0J36S,"I liked it but my kids both walked away from it (I have a 5 yr old and a 2 yr old).  We are a spanglish household as it is, so perhaps that's why.  I guess it seemed too much like an actual Spanish lesson than just watching a movie.  I recommend El Perro y El Gato.  They're fun and the kids don't even realize they're learning Spanish.",1363305600,2,336,3.8970588235294117
8230460,1,B000Y0J36S,"So I purchased this video after seeing the rave reviews for it.  I am a foreign language teacher myself (but in French) so I was hoping to find something to help my daughter with her Spanish.  Being familiar with the Pimsleur method and seeing this was from the same family, I had high hopes.  The DVD is insanely short, and doesn't teach much at all.  My daughter walked away with nothing new, and was totally bored watching it.  It is definitely not fit for anyone over 3 - saying it's good for up to 5 is crazy - my 5 year old was bored to tears.  And frankly, I'm not sure anyone under 2.5 would be interested in watching it either - so it's just not fast paced enough nor does it provide enough information to be worthwhile.  And I should mention - it is not cheap!  Save your money and watch Sid the Science Kid for free on PBS in spanish instead.",1357257600,5,853,4.190184049079755
8230461,5,B000Y0J36S,"I HAVE TRIED NUMEROUS SPANISH EDUCATIONAL MATERIAL(BOOKS, MUSIC, VIDEOS) AND THIS IS THE BEST SERIES I HAVE FOUND FOR TEACHING SPANISH TO MY 2 YR OLD SON(MUZZY SEEMS GOOD BUT TOO EXPENSIVE FOR ME TO TRY). MY WIFE AND I  DO NOT SPEAK SPANISH SO WE ARE ALL LEARNING. MY SON AMAZES MY FAMILY WITH THE WORDS HE KNOWS. I THINK THIS IS A GREAT HEAD START TO LEARNING A NEW LANGUAGE. THE VIDEO IS ENTERTAINING AND KEEPS HIS ATTENTION FOR THE ENTIRE VIDEO. HE ASKES FOR THE VIDEO BY NAME AND WATCHES THEM OVER AND OVER. WE TRY TO LIMIT TV TIME, BUT IF HE IS GOING TO WATCH 30 MIN A DAY HE MIGHT AS WELL BE LEARNING. WE HAVE 4 OF THE 6 VIDEOES IN THE SERIES AND WILL GET THE OTHER TWO WITH TIME.",1285027200,4,686,3.971014492753623
