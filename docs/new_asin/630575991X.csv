1071451,1,630575991X,"It's time someone gave this pretentious film the panning it so richly deserves. First of all, let me say that I have nothing against Wallace Shawn or talkative films - I rather enjoyed ""My Dinner With Andre,"" which somehow manages to hold the viewer's interest with its interesting dialogue and enjoyable setting. This film, however, is a yawn, and it doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense either. Throughout the movie we mostly see three things - the faces of the three characters talking, in front of some nameless postmodern background. As if this weren't visually boring enough, things get worse when we have to use our ears. Each in turn, the characters spew a lot of ridiculous monologues at the viewer in affected, self-serious voices. Somehow this is all supposed to tie together into one of the characters appointing himself the ""designated mourner"" for western culture (though why this random fool should matter to us in any way is never clearly explained.) All I can say is that if western culture is dead, it was this film that killed it.",1031184000,5,1050,4.743169398907104
1071452,4,630575991X,not being sure what/whom lead some to argue about the protagonist's transition from high- to low-brow. if this transition had anything to do with this movie it must have happened before since jack is nothing else but a pretentious low-brow pal who's faking his way around. otherwise a nerve-test: excellent interpretation around a low screenplay.,1008547200,2,346,5.3090909090909095
1071453,4,630575991X,"Funny how people revere this movie, using terms like ""thought provoking"" and ""intelligent"" and ""masterpiece,"" but no one seems to know what it's about.  The acting is impeccable, and  the script seems to be about the death of an elite inteligencia and the  victory of a shallow, all-surface society where nobody has to do much  thinking.  But the protagonist, the Mike Nichols character, though he  denies understanding the ""highbrow,"" displays the coldest and  sharpest mind in the story. Compared to him, Ayn Rand was Danielle  Steele!
The ending is moving, and the metaphor of the designated mourner  is touching, but when people try to talk about this one they stop short of  being specific about what in hell it was they found so interesting.  They  all sound like Roger Ebert; they use a lot of the lingo of film reviews but  they don't really know what the thing was about.",958780800,13,880,4.786666666666667
1071454,5,630575991X,"David Hare's The Designated Mourner starring Mike Nichols, Miranda Richardson, and David de Keyser, is based on a play by Wallace Shawn. Told almost entirely in direct address, the film is a genuinely original,  intimate, and compelling viewing experience of the sort as Wallace Shawn's  earlier triumph, My Dinner with Andre (written and performed with Andre  Gregory). The Designated Mourner is a cerebral, engaging, fascinating film  that will be reflected upon long after the closing credits run.  Color, 95  minutes.",952128000,10,521,5.45

Fine performances, especially Mike Nichols as Jack the ""designated mourner."" This is not for everyone; it's avant-garde, experimental theatre, but once you've experienced the genius of Wallace Shawn you will want to watch this over and over.",1495152000,,398,5.333333333333333

7894690,4,630575991X,"The mourner presides at the death of high art and decides to celebrate its passing.  It's a way of life I don't want to see pass, and so the play makes me uneasy (its intention, I imagine) here or in its recent live production with the author at the Public Theater in New York.  Nichols is exceptional.  And so--a play that makes me squirm and one I will probably go back to more than once.",1379030400,3,390,4.173333333333333
7894691,4,630575991X,"This is quite unlike anything I've ever seen, but the play's the thing, not necessarily the film. A good friend of mine leant me this DVD, and I sat down to watch it without having read what was on the case and knowing virtually nothing about it. At first I thought to myself, ""This isn't really my cup of tea."" Three actors seated at a table talking about various people in their lives as the camera moves back and forth among them. Obviously a ""writer's movie,"" or something you might see Off-Off-Broadway. But I kept with it, and as time went on and the circumstances in these peoples' lives were gradually, subtly exposed, I began getting really sucked into it. By the time this little play reached its haunting conclusion, I felt as if I had witnessed something really powerful.",1372464000,,783,4.6
7894692,4,630575991X,"Seeing legendary director Mike Nichols in the central, direct-address role as 'Jack' in Wallace Shawn's
The Designated Mourner is a real treat. Directed by another stage giant, David Hare, Nichols is breezy
and conversational while the play is obtuse and mostly unyielding. With two other actors punctuating,
the liberal paranoia and persecution wish-fulfillment phantasies mix rub up against social banalities,
making for a slow--but combustible--mix. I don't think I'd be able to sit through the filmed play without
such extraordinary talent driving it.
There were a couple of miniscule audio drop-outs, but otherwise, the restrained film style and subtle
lighting made for a nice visual component. But mostly, The Designated Mourner is a piece of very fine
writing that comes alive through some amazing performances.",1361664000,,819,5.56
7894693,3,630575991X,"Wally Shawn is a fine actor/writer(My Dinner With Andre) and Vanya in Vanya on 42nd St, but his plays don't have a lot of movement either in action or subtext. He is to be commended for giving plays to off B'way that break the bloat of the deadly theatre in NYC as described by Peter Brook in his fine theatre book The Empty Space. I consider Wally the Ionesco of our time, did what the theatre of the absurd writers, Ionesco, Pinter, Genet, Beckett, did , shock the audience into seeing that their lives are devoid of any metaphysical mystery and is full of platitudes and stupidities as Flaubert called in his Dictionary of Received Ides, as in Ionesco's The Bald Soprano, which has no bald soprano in it and has 43 recoginzed comic techniques. This play has a good hook, that Mike Nichols who plays the lead, is the mourner in a dystopian society which kills off gradually the intelligensia. But you have to ""dig out""the story. Seems he needs to cut it down to an essence.
  Wally Shawn despises mainstream theatre in NYC as he said in Dinner With Andre, feels  like Ionesco did watching it in 1930, very depressed when he sees actors on stage acting as if they are dragging around a sack of rocks. This play was done in London and I am happy for Wally, as I am a playwright trying to put on different plays, that he got some nice money for it. But the last time he did it was in a high school gym, with him playing the lead, Andre Gregory directing, and Larry Pine playing the father in law. This play if you stick with it is very dense and would give you a sense of seeing the effects of a dystopian society like the film Farenheidt 450.-- if you can get through the long speeches.

7894694,5,630575991X,"Any story - from Transformers 4 to Moses requires a couple of critical elements to set the hook, to work in fiction. Character development, complication, story; listen if the details of this drama are lost on you, it could be argued that you fail citizenship 101. What are we, so lost to the crux of authentic human suffering we'll miss the point altogether without a few boobs and the more visible explosions. This is a first rate play wth extrordinary renditions all around and if you don't quite ""get it"" you owe yourself a little patient education and a spot of quiet regards your ""tastes."" It's oddly difficult to live so downstream of freedom's capture we no longer understand the stakes and so may have to relive them.",1275264000,2,725,4.671875

7894696,5,630575991X,"Okay. Most of the people complaining about this movie act as if the MOVIE failed because they fail to take it seriously.

Yes, it's three actors talking directly to the camera for 90 minutes.

Get over it.

Yes, Wallace Shawn is not exactly the person to write an obit on the death of High Culture. And one reviewer is right to say the main character is just a pretentious faker (like Shawn?!).

And no, no one appoints that character the designated mourner for Western Culture--no one but himself.

But this film is also about despotism, and how quickly the life of the mind is snuffed out by politicians who put limits on expression.

The movie is a fascinating allegory. Yes, it's conflicted. Growing up with the inheritance of The New Yorker, no less, Shawn must be terribly conflicted about Cult-chya. But so is our society as a whole.

That's the worst thing about these other reviews. Even the writers who realize the film's about the various 'brows'--highbrow, lowbrow, etc.--fail to recognize how complexly the film negotiates these choppy cultural waters.

I adore Miranda Richardson. She's the perfect self-aware victim here--brittle but not shrill (as she can be).

Mike Nichols is indeed a revelation. He can do about ten layers of irony wrapped in sarcasm underneath hatred etc.

And if you don't want to think or be challenged, see another movie.

If you watch this one in the right frame of mind, it will really touch you deeply AND make you think.

And Pauline Kael in her last interview said it was an overlooked gem. So I'm right.

I know it's childish, but it's how I feel.",1118448000,26,1593,4.728260869565218
