457308,4,6302311764,"I have other Firm videos and wanted to get a few workouts that I could do quickly before or after work.  I thought this DVD was a great value for you get several workouts on one DVD.  All are about 30 minutes long.  The only negative I would add is that it would be helpful to have the weight set that is paired with these workouts.  I have other free weights and had to take a little longer to switch out between sets.  The band that comes with it is a little short for me (I'm 5'8"") and I couldn't do some of the pilates moves either.  All in all, it is a great value.",1283904000,13,570,3.9130434782608696

It is a lot of fun and keeps your interest-I have been using it for awhile and I still find it fun. Isn't that what a workout should be? There is plenty of variety since you have 4 workouts to choose from. It is the best workout I have found for the amount of time. It makes it easier to commit to some form of exercise everyday.",1283472000,,460,3.752577319587629
457310,5,6302311764,"These workouts are no longer than 35 min long each and they make you break a sweat! The first workout, Total Body Crunch, this one is my favorite, only 25 min long is a combination of cardio and toning mostly toning. There is a pilates workout, which I think if you are new to pilates moves, a beginners pilates dvd is best before doing this workout. Hardcore fusion is good also, kind of like the first workout ( Total Body Crunch) but about 10 min longer. And finally the Cardio Express is good, best part is the kickboxing section, but the rest of the cardio moves in this section tend to be a little tricky, a lot of dancing and the women don't queque you on time.  Overall, you're getting 4 workouts and a pilates band on 1 DVD for a great price.",1278028800,24,751,4.251748251748252

I love it because it's fun, gets results and the workout times are 25-35 minutes which are perfect for a busy mom.  I haven't lost much weight so far (probably because I'm gaining muscle), but I have lost about 6 inches.  Total body time crunch and Hard core fusion are my favorites on the dvd, but I also really like the cardio party.

I purchased this DVD because I thought it would be an economical way to get 4 workouts for essentially the price of one.  I have the Ultimate Fat Burning Collection which is a compilation of the longer version of 4 workouts and does not include the express versions of the work.  This DVD; however, only includes the express versions of the workouts listed.  The version of Total Body Time Crunch on this DVD only includes the sculpting portion of the workout and not the cardio components.  For Cardio Party, it includes the portions of the workout by all the instructors except Annie Lee.  I have done this express version of Cardio Party many times; it's a fun workout. I can not comment on how the express versions of Sculpt-ilates and Hardcore Fusion differ from the longer versions of the workout.

457314,5,6302311764,"I'm relatively new to ""The Firm"" workout series. I tried one many years ago, but couldn't keep up as I was seriously out of shape at the time and gave up. Since then I've lost 50 pounds with diet and exercise. I've been looking for something new as far as exercise is concerned, so I decided to give this DVD a try. I did my first workout last night. The ""Total Body Time Crunch"". It was awesome! The choreography was a bit complicated in the beginning, but I restarted the dvd and kept pushing through until I got it. And once I did I started having a blast. This really is a Total Body Time Crunch. I worked up a sweat and I feel the burn today. But it's a good burn. Arms, Buns, Abs, Thighs..you name it. They were all worked. Rebekah is a good instructor though her cueing is off at times. She's upbeat without being annoyingly ""perky"". And she has an amazing body. I was motivated just by looking at her. I'd forgotten how much fun working out can be after getting bored with the Elliptical and Treadmill. I'm actually looking forward to my next Firm workout. I think this DVD was just what I needed to reawaken my zest for exercise and boost my metabolism. Already thinking about what Firm DVD I'm going to buy next!",1269475200,7,1222,4.317391304347826

457459,3,6302311764,"To be clear, none of the four workouts offered on this DVD is new: each was previously released on a prior Firm DVD as an ""Express"" version of the full workout.  I purchased this DVD because I had not tried any of those prior releases, and so I thought that this might be a good deal.  Unfortunately, I found all four of these workouts to be uninteresting, uninspiring, and generally too easy for my high intermediate level.

The Main Menu simply lists the four routines, each of which are approximately 30-35 minutes long.  I have provided brief breakdowns below.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-FIRM-Total-Body-Time-Crunch-DVD/dp/B003UVO8CM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The FIRM Total Body Time Crunch DVD</a>&nbsp;(25:14)
This short, all-strength routine is led by Rebekah Sturkie.  The 5-minute warm-up includes moves such as step-touch, step-squat, low jacks, and knees.  There are three total strength segments, each 5 minutes long.  The first consists of biceps curls, squats with knees, bent over rows, and dead lifts.  The second series includes standing chest work, plies, overhead triceps press, and one-legged squat.  Finally, the sequence involves ""corkscrew"" (front lunge with a twist), pec flies and pelvic raises on the floor, and abs work.  Rebekah does add some compound work on the second set; she repeatedly states that you are doing ""3-in-1"" moves.  The workout ends with a 5-minute cool-down with lying stretches for the hamstrings and quads as well as seated stretches.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sculpt-ilates/dp/B0018BEG5U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sculpt-ilates</a>&nbsp;(31:15)
Robyn Johnson instructs this Pilates-inspired workout, the only section of the DVD which uses the included band.  Robyn starts with a standing warm-up without the band, performing moves such as knee pull, roll down, standing spinal twist; she flows into more challenging movements such as standing saw, swan, criss-cross, and mermaid.  Moving down to the floor (at 11m), Robyn adds the band for Pilates row but then drops the band again for side-lying work, including star, inner & outer leg lifts, and mermaid.  More rows and biceps curls with the band follow, and then Robyn moves through the Pilates series of five without the band.  Final stretches include hip flexors, gate pose, seated spine stretch, seated spine twist, and diagonal stretch.  I enjoy Pilates, but the time really dragged during this routine, and the music was WAY too loud and jarring for me.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Firm-Hard-Core-Fusion/dp/B001EC6JDU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Firm: Hard Core Fusion</a>&nbsp;(35:47)
This is a cardio/strength circuit workout led by Allie Del Rio.  The 5-minute warm-up starts with marches, step taps, side taps with ""funky"" biceps, and v-march with speed bag arms.  Each interval is about 5 minutes long.  Allie starts with strength and performs plie rows, hammer curls, and side lunges with triceps press.  Next comes a cardio sequence with jump rope, balance leg lifts to the rear, punches, lunges, and kicks.  Some of the transitions in this segment felt very awkward to me, and the cardio wasn't sufficient to keep my heart rate up.  For the next strength interval, Allie introduces ""heavy"" lunges, one-arm rows, triceps presses, and plies with side delt raises.  The second cardio segment was a bit more enjoyable, with some interesting moves such as plies with twists, side kicks, front-back kicks, and knee holds with front kicks.  However, I thought that Allie's cuing was surprisingly poor here.  The final section is strength-based and focuses on core:  Allie performs standing side bends, knee crunches, and squats with twists, and then she goes to the floor for ribcage pullovers, reverse crunches, and ""triceps tummy toner"" crunches.  The workout concludes with a 5-minute cool-down stretch, but I HATED that planks were included as part of the cool-down!  The stretch portion offers seated twist, cat/cow, and standing stretches.

This workout features various instructors, including Rebekah, Allie, and then also Alison Davis and Emily Welsh, both of whom appear as background exercisers on the above workouts.  What bothered me here is that they are all teaching routines that they offered on DVDs PRIOR to the release of Cardio Party, so this is more like a ""Firm Greatest Hits"" compilation.  Alison is up first, instructing the 4.5 minute warm-up (marches in/out, etc.)  Her 3.5-minute sequence includes ski back step with bounce, repeater knees, and side leg raise with knees.  Emily is next for a kickboxing-inspired routine that will look familiar.  She starts with a standing crunch, adding a twist and then a kick.  Next comes a jab-cross to the side, moving into jab-cross-knee.  This is followed by squats which turn into plyos and finally, repeater knees with a twist.  At 7.5 minutes, this segment felt MUCH too long.  Rebekah's series (8.5 minutes) is supposed to be more ""funky,"" as she introduces Latin-inspired moves such as samba and salsa.  Added on to these are a touch-side-rear and a low lunge wrap.  Finally, Allie states that her dance is going to be a ""fiesta"" party.  She begins with a cha-cha, adding in a triple step and arms. Allie fancies up the cha-cha with a butt kick; she also performs a cross step with heel lift, shimmy, and drag step.  Her sequence lasts about 6 minutes, and then she moves right into the approximately 2-minute flowing cool-down (rib shifts, plies, leg circles).

Overall, I found the workouts on this DVD to be just so-so.  My least favorite was the Sculpt-ilates; the others were okay; there just was not anything particularly different or interesting about any of them.  This DVD would probably be best suited to experienced beginning exercisers who 1) enjoy the newer Firm workouts (but have not tried any of the prior DVDs from which these routines were taken), and 2) who are short on time and would appreciate these shorter offerings.",1382832000,13,6240,5.5882978723404255
457460,3,6302311764,I like any of the cardio ones. I haven't used this one enough to say It's great or not great. Will be working on it more.,1381622400,,121,3.6923076923076925
457461,4,6302311764,I have about 3-5 various firm workout dvd's which all are GREAT workout and the problem is more with me than the workout! I just can NOT KEEP UP! some dvd's have a part when you do the move several times slowly then you move to tempo. My lack of coordination makes this video very diffcult for ME! I even tried doing the video back to back to see if I could learn the routine and it was still hard for me to keep up after a week. I love the challange that this workout gives and it is not a extremely hard workout. If your coordination is great the firm dvds are the best I would recommend!!!!,1372636800,2,593,4.033898305084746

457463,4,6302311764,"I've had this DVD for nearly 3 years now & it's still my go-to for squeezing in a workout.  Granted, when I first started it I was not in the shape I am in now & I thought it was beyond difficult & the direction was poor.  But over time you learn the moves & how to focus on the specific muscle groups for optimum performance.  I wouldn't rely solely on this for a ""total body makeover"" but it's a great help, especially when you just can't get to the gym.  It's especially good if you double up and even triple up the segments.  It won't benefit you if you just go through the motions, though.  You really must use your space for the cardio segments & focus on your movement & control during the strengthening moves in order for it to deliver.  To me, that just goes without saying for any workout, mind over matter can make even the simplest workouts more grueling.  I definitely can't say that it leaves me drenched with sweat like an express workout with Jillian Michaels, but it's great for active recovery days & for adding an extra oomph to your regular routine.",1366675200,,1069,4.336683417085427

457516,4,6302311764,"I have been exercising with The Firm since 1998.  The routines are easy to follow and are well-scripted, so the excellent cues and coaching really help you learn the sequences.  You will always get a great workout.  These routines are about 30 minutes each which I add to my own set of yoga and exercises.  Because I am doing more strength training now, I like Hardcore Fusion the best.  The Cardio Party is a little redundant, but it's easy and you can throw in some variations of your own if you want.  Overall, I am a big fan of The Firm.  They are the best for beginners because of the combination moves and scripting. I'm not in their ""Firm Believer"" program, but I still use the VHS tapes from the early 90's (Low-Impact Aerobics with Janet Jones).  The quality of the tapes is outstanding and they have stood the test of time.  These routines offer the best challenge for an effective workout.",1342483200,4,900,4.506172839506172

The last video, Cardio Party is all cardio and is fun.  The pilates is the part of the video I use the least, because I don't feel like I am getting much from it.  I probably need to get a band with better resistance.  The other two workouts use weights, with one combining weights and cardio.  There is a little something for all your workout needs on this video.

Maybe once you do it often enough it gets more fun and you can follow the moves well but for me it was horrible!

So I did two workouts one after the other and still nary broke a sweat. There was not much exertion, and whatever exertion there was wasn't long enough. The DVD with workouts of about half an hour each that did give me a total body makeover was Jillian Michaels' Ripped in 30.

I saw this DVD in Target and was happy to see that it came with a workout band and didn't require a step (I find I'm getting a little scared of using a step now that I'm getting older and my balance is not all that great).  What really sold me was that there were 4 workouts on one DVD.  I've tried all 4 of the workouts.  They are all great, but I wish there were a little more arm and chest work included.  The moves in Cardio Party were really difficult to learn, and I sometimes still mess up with them, but I just keep on moving.  I'm not into jumpy aerobics, so when they do anything that requires both feet off the floor at the same time, I just modify it with a similar move with both of my feet on the ground.

The Hard Core Fusion I liked that they did the Aerobics and Weight Traning and some dance into it and my favorite is the Cardio Party that they had different Instructors guiding the workouts my favorite is Allie's especially that she does the Salsa Dance that I love alot.

457552,5,6302311764,"I have been doing the FIRM workout videos for about 2 years now.  I own the Total Body Makeover that uses the Fanny Lifter which is a great strength training video.  It also has a hard cardio workout and ab workout.  This Total Body Makeover is just the mini version, which I like!  I'm a busy mom of twins and don't always have a full uninterrupted hour to work out.  I like the Cardio Party for a quick heart rate spike, and then I cool down and tone with the Sculpti-lates!  I really like how multiple instructors come forward to lead the exercise.  That adds something different every few minutes.  I haven't tried the other parts of this video, but the other reviews seem favorable overall.  I definitely recommend this video.  Even if you think 30 minutes isn't long enough...do 2 portions of the video!!!!",1293321600,,812,4.537931034482758

Ah, The Firm (invoke sighs).  I grew up with this workout.  I started doing this workout on Taylor Street in Columbia SC where I am from, and I actually had the founder; Anna Benson as one of my workout instructors back in the 80s when this workout was the rage.  Sad to say The Firm is no more, except in DVDs like this by Gaiam, the studio does not exist and Anna Benson is no longer with us.  However, these workouts are still classics and they will last for a long time.

This DVD contains the SHORT versions of longer workouts ONLY-if you are like me, you probably already have the longer version of the workouts somewhere and just wanted another DVD that had just the shorter workouts.  All of the workouts are from 25 to 35 minutes in length.  Total Body Time Crunch Express is with Rebekah Sturkie, and is my favorite on the DVD.  At just 25 minutes she works everything, and she also really works up a sweat!  Sculpt-lates with Robyn Johnson has a band in the DVD included for its use, it is a functional pilates type sculpting DVD that clocks in at 31 minutes.  Hard Core fusion express with Allie Del Rio, one of The Firm's most popular instructors, is probably the easiest to follow and has some of the best cuing. This one was 35 minutes.  Cardio Party Express is thirty minutes and has two of the above instructors with Emily Welch and Annie Lee and is a nice, cut down version of the original workout which was 40 minutes in length.

The band that is included with this DVD is nice, and has lasted for over a month now.  I'm a FIRM believer and I love their workouts-boy are they missed.  An excellent purchase!",1516924800,,1701,4.372611464968153

If you want the full workout version buy each DVD separately. Even though they are three express version they still get the job done.
