8278384,5,B001AOOTCU,"Though this Drama is a fictional piece it certainly is food for thought
about the politics involved in hospital procedures and placement of
Doctors on the totem pole.  Actually, it is frightening to think that
there are doctors who behave this way in real life.  I did very much
enjoy the drama and the actors were very believable.  Any time you can
despise a character, you know they are doing a great job.  I would definitely recommend this drama.  And the romance part is sweet.",1220832000,,481,4.6117647058823525
