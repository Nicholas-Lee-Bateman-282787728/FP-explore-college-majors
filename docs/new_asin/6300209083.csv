*Plot and ending analyzed*

Showdown at Boot Hill (1958) is interesting, but it fails to elevate itself above standard fare.  It's short on action and horse scenes, mainly concentrating on the effects of a shootout.  The shootout pits Charles Bronson as a deputy marshal bounty hunter who wants to take some murderer in.  The murderer draws his gun on him and dies.  The result being that everyone in the town turns against Charles Bronson, who needs witnesses for his affidavit to collect his reward.

Charles Bronson does not yet have that strong charisma to carry a picture, he is fine acting wise, but a bit stolid.  His character also has a ""Napoleon complex"" (Bronson is of short stature).  The ""Napoleon complex"" is absurd and doesn't seem to explain his motivations.

Charles Bronson falls for some woman who is also equally socially inept.  Eventually the town wants to kill him and organizes a mob.

It's average stuff for Western fans.",1490572800,,988,4.885542168674699

8156853,3,6300209083,"Young gun bounty hunter with a chip on his shoulder arrives in a small town to bring a killer to justice. Except the killer has no intensions of surrendering and the young gun ends up having to kill him.

One might expect this to be the end of our bounty hunters troubles, except the killer was a beloved resident of the town and when the townspeople are asked to identify the deceased, in order for the bounty hunter to collect his bounty, the townspeople flat out refuse. So the bounty hunter stays in town, looking for ways to collect his bounty.

Along the way he falls in love with a young waitress, just as lonely as he is. Slowly the iron mask he has been hiding behind starts to fall away, but not before our young hot head has to face all sorts of threats from different sides. Finally though the bounty hunter is tamed and in true Hollywood fashion gets the girl.

This is by no means a great western and by no means the best Charles Bronson movie ever. The movie does however showcase the talents and charisma of a very young Bronson and it is a nice little character study, which - unfortunately - is ever so slightly spoiled by the rather pathetic Hollywood style happy ending.",1446854400,2,1190,4.4

His role as a U.S. Marshall hunting the bandido, killing him and wanting proof that he killed the wanted man becomes hardest part of the movie. If you like Charles Bronson, you'll like this film.

8156859,3,6300209083,"The all but forgotten Showdown at Boot Hill is an okay little B-western that offers an early starring role and his first top billing for Charles Bronson as a bounty hunting US Marshal who faces an unusual dilemma when he gets his man - dead rather than alive - in a small, sleepily corrupt town, but finds himself unable to claim the reward when it turns out he was so popular with the locals that no-one will identify the body. It's a neat spin on the High Noon formula, beginning with the gunfight before the town turns its back on the lawman, though Bronson's no Gary Cooper here: he's in it for the money (so much so that he won't kill anyone without a bounty on them even when they try to kill him), and no sooner has he holstered his gun than he's snapping ""Better have an inquest real quick. Weather like this, he won't keep."" But it's that kind of town, where even the closest thing he has to an ally, John Carradine's barber-cum-doctor-cum-undertaker says of the latter part of his job description ""Nailing the lid down ain't nothin' more than carpentry,"" while a couple of sleepy cowpokes set the dead man's brother on our anti-hero just to liven things up a little.

Intriguingly, some of the townsfolk are given good and valid reasons for their resentment and Bronson shows some initiative to identify the corpse, even making an ill-fated attempt to photograph it (slightly ironic since director Gene Fowler Jr would helm three episodes of Bronson's TV series Man with a Camera the following year). Unfortunately the film begins to drag its feet as Bronson starts to fall for plain Jane waitress Fintan Meyler and the real reason for his ornerieness is revealed - he's desperately insecure about his height, something everyone picks up on and taunts him over. From then on it's all a bit of a disappointment as he learns that ""No matter how many men you kill, it ain't gonna make you an inch taller"" en route to a redemptive anti-climax that feels like something out of a 50s anthology TV show.

Still, unlike Bronson's some of other early leading roles like the same year's When Hell Broke loose, at least this doesn't look like bad 50s TV even if the plot could have come straight out of an episode of Steve McQueen's Wanted: Dead or Alive. Oscar-nominated editor-briefly-turned-director Gene Fowler Jr. does a good job of marshalling his limited resources and shows a good eye for the black and white Scope frame to add value to the picture, though he seriously miscalculates by cranking up the two quick draws in the film to unintentionally comic effect. Released as the supporting feature to Harry Black and the Tiger, it's the kind of film that isn't strong enough to stand up as a main feature on its own but is a decent enough `inbetween' movie.

Olive's Region A-locked Blu-ray release offers a decent 2.35:1 widescreen black and white transfer, though there's nothing they can do about the limitations of the original Regalscope process used to shoot the film, which is a bit hit-and-miss - mostly good, but in some shots one part of the frame might be in softer focus than the rest. No extras.",1381968000,6,3116,4.661818181818182
