3984895,3,B002TJ1ERI,"Like the first reviewer, overall I found this video to be extremely informative and the instructor was very good at explaining his actions and the way the pistol parts fit together.

I was very pleased to see that the instructor covered very well the differences between the Kimber 1911 models and the classic 1911 models. Also, this DVD featured a detailed index that makes it very easy to find a section describing the assembly or disassembly of a specific part of the 1911.

The only surprising deficiency I discovered was that the narrator's audio level varied greatly from time to time during the video. Sometimes the audio level dropped so much that it was somewhat difficult to hear what the instructor was saying. Fortunately, this did not happen too often.

Experiencing this problem was quite surprising, given that the video quality (lighting, focus, angles) is very good throughout. I would have rated this product higher if it were not for the somewhat annoying audio problem.

Overall, despite the audio production problem, this video will enable its viewer to become competent in disassembling and reassembling a 1911 pistol with confidence.",1321833600,10,1156,5.1005291005291005
3984896,5,B002TJ1ERI,"I am new to 1911 pistols and wanted a video to show me how to completely disassemble and reassemble my pistol.  This DVD is perfect for that purpose.  It shows in great detail the exact methods for both disassembly and reassembly of not only the basic Colt 1911 but also the newer variants.  The video detail is excellent, and everything is explained very thoroughly.  Highly recommended for anyone who owns a 1911 model pistol.",1300924800,5,428,4.743243243243243

8380144,5,B002TJ1ERI,This is an excellent video on how to disassemble and reassemble a 1911. It has tips on other brands of the 1911 as well. I found the video very helpful and informative. If you want to learn how to completely disassemble your 1911 for a thorough cleaning and then reassemble your pistol this video will be very helpful. For those of you with Kimber 1911 pistols you will find this video very helpful.,1424044800,,399,4.47945205479452

8380146,5,B002TJ1ERI,Very good course on the 1911 pistol. I would recommend this DVD. The other reviewers give a good description of this course. I would pass on the AGI 1911 Armorers Course.,1408147200,2,170,4.516129032258065

8380149,3,B002TJ1ERI,This DVD is a good resource of information. You can select and view individual chapters or play all in sequence. The low video quality seems like copy of earlier VHS recordings but is tolerable. I recommend this DVD for anyone needing basic information beyond the owner manuals.,1391990400,,278,4.9361702127659575
8380150,5,B002TJ1ERI,"As always AGI videos are complete and highly detailed with extremely good video quality--including the close ups necessary to really understand how the parts go together.  As an added bonus--the instructor is extremely ""likeable""--with a good sense of humor and helps convey some of the pitfalls (such as flying springs!) that can happen to anyone.  I have worked a lot with SW revolvers---but never really owned a .45--this video made understanding all versions a snap.  Includes series 79, series 80 and variations such as kimber...can't recommend enough.",1387929600,2,557,5.379310344827586
8380151,5,B002TJ1ERI,"An outstanding video that shows you a wide variety of model 1911 .45 pistol, ""HOW TO DISASSEMBLE/REASSEMBLE"". The gunsmith tells and shows little known facts that makes the process easy for anyone. This video is ""GOOD MONEY SPENT"" !!!",1373673600,3,234,5.0256410256410255
