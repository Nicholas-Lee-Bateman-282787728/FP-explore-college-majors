8659978,5,B00KMABT6C,"The last Season (Season 4 of the Killing is on blu ray but, it's a import you can snag it on amazon.uk.co
I have yet to get it mostly cause anytime I'm on Amazon's uk sister site I forget it's in my wish list

This set regardless is close to flawless you get for first 3 seasons of The Killing in beautiful 1080p HD the only way to really appreciate this series is to view it in the proper way (HD)
The only major negative is you'll need a region free player (which isn't that hard to get anymore I got a region free 3-D br, dvd player here on amazon for around $130.00
Any hardcore collector must have a region free player
This set contains  the two season of the Killing exploring who murdered Rosie Larsen
(which is a flawless detective story with amazing twist and turns) some fan were unhappy with the first season never raping up the Rosie Larsen Case but, it never bothered me.... Look at season one of the Killing and tell me HBO's True Detective wasn't inspired but, this first season
Season Three takes place a year after the events of the Rosie Larsen case being solved
Sarah Linden is no longer a cop and has put here stressful past behind her to try and be normal
Until Stephen Holder comes looking for Sarah for help on a new ""darker"" twisted investigation
That takes the two down a rabbit hole into the dark souls of humanity  where actions lead to grey areas where nobody comes out the same again!

Season Three was yet again the second time AMC dropped the ball and canceled the series yet again for a second time
They did the ""spin"" game of blaming poor rating and the fans
Keep in mind AMC never fully understood or even tried to push and promote The Killing
AMC only cares about a stale zombie series
Season Three was saying a hell of a lot in terms of a deep social commentary on a massive epidemic in this country
That being teenage run away's/ homeless teens and I'm sure it bothered various executives at AMC cause god forbid they had to see what's really going on and they didn't wanna swallow that!
Killing zombies time after time no longer has any real subsistence but, a real issue going on threw out  North America shouldn't be examined and looked deep at...... Guilt is a interesting thing

For all AMC's The Killing fans who got duped into buying the first season on blu ray a few years back! you can sell that version
all the extras from the U.S. blu ray is on the first season set! I was one of those duped so i can feel your pain
This box set is a must have  10/10
For anyone who was majorly disappointed in True Detectives Season Two get this set you're forget that season ever happened",1450051200,,2621,4.315040650406504
8659979,4,B00KMABT6C,"Some two years ago I watched the excellent original Danish version and having some time to kill (no pun intended) decided to settle down on netflix and watch the American adaption....could it be as good or even better? In short no but it is still an excellent series and one that you must be prepared to engage with and spend some time with over a long period to really feel the benefits, the enjoyment and possibly play amateur detective as you along with Detectives Sarah Linden and Stephen Holder analyse the evidence and decide who killed lovely Rosie Larsen.

The story differs from the original ie the killer is not the same and thus this makes the final outcome different. I was able to identify the killer quite will hidden but always obvious (to say more would give the plot away) however there was a great twist in the final episode which was astounding and showed that the killer did not work alone.....his accomplice will sadden and amaze you! Sarah Linden will not amaze you however she may as a detective have proved more than capable but as a mother she is a total failure. She appears to work 24 hours per day, live out of motels, eat only ready made fast food, and more importantly leave her poor son Jack all alone to deal with his own teenage angst...is it any wonder that her proposed marriage never happens and that Jack finally returns to live with his father in Chicago.

The American series does suffer from the fact that it is unnecessarily long and would have benefited from some good editing; there is one complete chapter devoted to the search for Jack who disappears (not that I blame you Jack with a mother like Sarah Linden) and we spend a wasted 45 minutes in an attempt to locate him.....he finally return to the motel and we the viewer can return to the search for Rosie's killer, and the final outcome is still well worth the wait. There is some wonderful heartfelt acting from Rosie's parents Mitch and Stan Larsen and as the story concludes there is a particular scene that will brings tears of sadness to the most hardened  viewers.....So some great acting, memorable moments, and a good attempt at an English version of the Danish series....but if you want the best the original Danish series is unbeatable!",1446336000,,2246,4.62406015037594
