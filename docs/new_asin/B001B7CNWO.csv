3484508,4,B001B7CNWO,"I'll be honest, I only watched this because I was tired, it was free (Prime membership rocks!), and I wanted to see some ""candy"".  I thought I'd watch for a bit and then switch to something more worthwhile after I got my fix.  But the movie was really funny, and the acting was good.  The situations weren't over played, and mostly non-cliche, which was the most surprising.  I've never seen Carmen in a movie before, and while she's no Hepburn, I really liked her in this.  Now that I've seen this, I think I'll stop avoiding films with her in them (sorry about that Carmen).  Anyway, to sum it up, instead of getting my ""candy"" fix, I got my ""really good comedy"" fix instead.  Very worth watching.",1311638400,,699,4.456692913385827
3484509,4,B001B7CNWO,"Absolutely delightful fantasy about two clueless British guys trying to make it big in the film industry via a road less traveled. I found it hysterically funny. The juxtaposition of dry British humour with the production of a problematic porn film had me giggling helplessly. The best way I can describe this film is as a ""Ferris Beuller's Day Off"" meets ""The Full Monty"" kind of film. Seriously, I had to tape my ribs after watching this one. lol.",1311465600,6,449,4.69620253164557

3484511,4,B001B7CNWO,"Carmen is not seen until suffering movie is one-half over.
How she teamed with these nerds is beyond words.
I guesss the answer is like asking Ed McMahon why he did commercials until he died--he needed the money.
Hey Carmen: you don't need stuff like this to film for us.",1240790400,2,271,4.44
3484512,3,B001B7CNWO,"I am not sure what I was hoping for when I got this, other than that I wanted to see Tom Riley in something else. He plays quite a brat, producer, smooth dick to Tom Burke's sulking wannabe director. They, driven by the absolute need to make a movie, any movie, find themselves making soft porn with Candy Fiveways (Carmen Electra). Yeay.
Ensues lots of porn/cooking gags. Some good, some not so great. Something lacks in this movie, something about heart... or maybe it's too long... or the actors fail to convince.
Maybe it's a case of them having far too good a time making the damn thing, leaving us with the crumbs. Anyways. If you remotely enjoy watching Tom Riley do anything, this one is for you !",1239926400,,705,4.4728682170542635
3484513,1,B001B7CNWO,"Okay, I love Carmen Electra...she has a figure to die for, however, the concept of the movie and the DVD cover are EXTREMELY deceptive. There isn't a whole lot of Carmen at all in this flick. The character she plays is supposed to be a porn star, so you would think that she would show some skin when she does appear, right?
WRONG! There is more nudity in a Gremlins movie than in this cheeseball!
You can get a good look at her from behind about...oh, let's see...once, and she's only in lingerie throughout the entire flick, which is about all she wears on a day to day basis anyway.
So don't get your hopes up if you think you're going to see Carmen's fabulous figure in any more than her normal everyday pictures that are strewn out by the millions all over the internet.
ENOUGH ABOUT THAT...ON TO THE MOVIE:
A one star stinker!
The acting is ridiculously bad, the plot premise is way too far-fetched to take itself seriously (even for a comedy)! Who are these people anyway? I haven't heard of a single one of them being in any other notable movies! And it looked like it was filmed in someone's personal garage and backyard as well!
Poor production on all accounts!
STAR FACTOR: One miserable, let-down star!",1232409600,37,1214,4.497737556561086
3484514,4,B001B7CNWO,"This has a lot of good laughs in it, it's a mix between a situation comedy and the background behind an ""arty"" sex film made by students who end up owing some sleazy gangsters.

It has a lot of good moments in it and some excellent lines. It's a good film.

3484516,1,B001B7CNWO,"Sorry, I just did not like this film. Every turn in the script was totally unbelievable, and it was not very funny.

Maybe some will like it. Put it this way: if you think that somebody eating toast with pubic hair in the butter is hilarious, and if are not bothered by the logic of two guys apparently believing that combining their epic love story script with a porn movie will get them into Hollywood, then you'll like this film.",1219449600,5,432,4.4

8282109,3,B001B7CNWO,"Amazon started by putting it in the wrong ratings category. That is Amazons fault not the movies. At best it was very a slow movie and had some funny points but like has been said before  The label is very dissipative and it probably should of had a PG13 rating instead of the R

Very disappointed",1381536000,,297,4.285714285714286

If you're looking for a comedy of errors about the making of a skin flick, this IS it.

Think Risky Business meets Get Shorty in the suburbs of London.

When you need to have a gut busting good laugh, this is it.",1340668800,,318,4.015873015873016
