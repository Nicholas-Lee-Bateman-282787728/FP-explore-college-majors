2684325,1,B000K7VL4M,"I bought and watched the first 3 seasons of this show and although it's not the best show in history, it had it's good points. But what happened in the 4th season?-This became a mess!! Most of the stories don't make any sense to me, and are rarely funny. I thought the first season was so sickening sweet the first time I watched it. I longed for it after watching these episodes! The Christmas show has Santa carrying a gun throughout the show? I wonder if it was Doris' idea to change the format. I can't imagine what the fifth season is going to be. What a let down!!!
I've given the 5th season a chance and it is an improvement over the 4th year.",1181001600,9,650,4.208
2684326,4,B000K7VL4M,"I love Doris Day - an inspiration to us all, and love her work with the Doris Day Animal League and Doris Day Animal Foundation - however, to me the first seasons of the series are the best.  I loved the farm, and the way the series started - hated it as cast members changed, and as Doris moved to the city.  In season 4, when the childen suddenly disappear without any excuse, the show floundered. This also disturbs me as I think many in the tv gig forget that to child actors, the series is like a real family to them - and very upsetting to suddenly be ""dumped"" - particulary when the series went on without them.  To me, the series is at its best for the first couple of years, making your heart yearn for a life like that - a simpler farm life, with a distinct sense of purpose and values as to what is really important.",1179014400,7,827,4.124223602484472
2684327,5,B000K7VL4M,"Such a treat to revist these classic TV shows.  But Doris, what happened to your kids that were in the first 3 seasons?

There is not one mention of her 2 children this time around - still it is pure enjoyment & of course the season includes the traditional Joseph Magnin fasion show  -- included as the second to last episode.",1178928000,,327,4.327868852459017
2684328,5,B000K7VL4M,"I am a huge Doris Day fan who knows virtually all of her movies, even the less well-known musicals from the 50s.  I *adore* this woman.  I'm too young to have seen the ""Doris Day Show"" in its original airings (unless my mom had it on the TV next to my crib...), but I have treasured watching Seasons 1-3 on DVD.  It's fine television that presents Doris in a different light from her films, and she rose to the occasion with some fine performances.  I knew that big changes were in store for the show in Season 4 and really looked forward to seeing how they would work.  Well, I wish my feelings were better, but frankly Season 4 strikes me as a mess.

It's common knowledge that this season marked the biggest changes in a sitcom concept that was from the beginning somewhat unstable.  In Seasons 1 to 3 we watched Doris transform from a widowed farm mother to a woman-on-the-town career girl, and although the transition wasn't often smooth, it was plausible.  Doris pulled it off.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure even she could pull off such drastic changes as the ones we find at the beginning of Season 4.  Here we're given an entirely different cast, albeit it similar sets (the glorious apartment, the office).  Most disconcertingly, there isn't the slightest explanation as to what happened either to Doris's kids, to her onetime best friend Myrna, to Mr. Harvey, or to Nick.  They disappear as if they never existed.  The show's reluctance to do even a little bit of scene-setting (as they did in the first eposides of seasons 2 and 3, to clarify the changes that followed) is a problem that I can't ignore.  We're thrust from the first episode into a complex, familiar relationship between Doris and Cy and asked to accept Jackie as her best girlfriend, but there there just isn't a context there to allow us to do that.  We have no history with these people, although strangely enough Doris does.  I found it very offputting, even confusing.  I wonder what they thought back in 1971!

But there's another change that the posters below haven't commented upon: the pace and mood of the show are also radically different.  There seems to have been a concerted effort here to perk the plots up; the pace is fast, the dialogue feverish, and the episodes crammed with events and material.  It has a restless quality that is far removed from the charming, relaxed silliness of the previous seasons.  To make it worse, the new tempo gives Doris and her co-stars very little space to develop their characters or grow on us as people.  I found myself tiring of Cy's endless haranguing; Jackie's character frankly seemed inconsequential as she has so little to do.  Add to this that the plots are getting more inane and outlandish (Doris intervening in a jewel heist aboard a train bound from Paris to Nice, with the richest rajah in the world and an Asian coup d'etat occurring on board...) and the whole thing just gets hard to watch.  Doris spends a lot of time with pistols pointed at her face, in disguise (that ghastly Christmas episode...), or fighting with Cy.  The emphasis is strongly on her work life; we see much more of Cy than we do her erstwhile boyfriend Peter.  The Palluccis and Mr Jarvis are still around, but their roles are minimized.

What in the world happened?  It seems to me that Doris's age was becoming a bit of an issue by 1971 to someone affiliated with this show, be it the network, the writers, or Doris herself.  She was 47 and the show's previous concept--widowhood, children entering dating age, spinster best friend, babyfaced boss--perhaps was making that age a little too obvious, especially when CBS had a hit show about a modern woman in the form of Mary Tyler Moore.  It's hard not to mention that show here, because the many changes in Season 4  seem geared toward puting this show more in line with MTM, albeit perhaps targeted to a slightly older generation.  The result seems to me a mixed success.  Even Doris's wardrobe is out of whack; in an effort perhaps to make her seem funky, she dons some of the ugliest, most unflattering prints I have ever seen on this usually stylish actress.  The fashion show is her best moment, actually.  It's her everyday wear that is so odd, and don't tell me that's just what they wore in the 70s--Doris looked great in Season 3, and Mary Tyler Moore looked fabulous throughout the 7-year run of her show.  Doris looks like a middle-aged woman trying hard to seem hip.  It doesn't work, and I felt kind of sorry for her as I recalled that this is one of the most beautiful women, and perfect figures, Hollywood has ever seen.

Let's hope things settle into place a bit for Season 5.  As it stands, I'd reserve this set for the Doris fan who must have it all.",1174435200,27,4736,4.586206896551724
2684329,4,B000K7VL4M,"Still a wonderful trip back down memory lane for 40 somethings and over, as well as fans of the one and only Doris Day. Having not seen this show since its original airing, I am saddened to realize it was not as good as I recalled - but how wonderful the show's first four seasons are available at all. Crammed with extras that baby boomers will love (Doris' two Whats My Line appearances, etc), if you are a fan of typical 60s sitcoms, or of Doris Day herelf, the reasonably priced sets are worth every penny.",1174348800,5,510,4.322916666666667
2684330,5,B000K7VL4M,"The Doris Day Show- Season 4 is wonderful.  I have already purchased Season  1,2,3 and can't wait for season 4 and season 5 to be released.

Doris Day is just the most wonderful actress and so funny.  If I have a bad day at work all I have to do is come home and watch one of her shows and it will make you laugh and forget what kind of day you had at work.

She is just the best and so good at whatever she does. I have been a fan of hers for48 years and no one compares to her talent. So if you want a good laugh and to relax, purchasing this dvd... it's well worth it.",1168214400,10,571,3.725
2684331,5,B000K7VL4M,"The fourth season of the highly popular ""The Doris Day Show"" which CBS aired from 1971 - 1972, brought with it some major changes in format.  What remained constant, however, was the lady herself. Doris Day continued to delight millions every week and if the writing on the show was sometimes less than stellar, Miss Day made up for it with her energetic performance and completely natural, unaffected way of performing.

During the new season, gone were the two children that had been mainstays on the series since its debut in September, 1968. Poof - no more kids!!

However, Day's character of Doris Martin continued to occupy that dazzling apartment in San Francisco with the spiral staircase (perfect for making an entrance during the show's opening credits). In addition, landlords Angie and Louie Palucci (Kaye Ballard and Bernie Kopell) were still around to lend their over the top comedy. Other holdovers from previous seasons included Billy De Wolfe with his inimitable humor and wit as Willard Jarvis.

Doris Martin had received a promotion at Today's World the San Francisco based magazine she had worked for during seasons 2 and 3. She now worked for Cy Bennett (John Dehner), creating a strong foil for Day and Day's best friend at the magazine was now played by Jackie Joseph, whose bubbly personality grows on you during the season.  Joseph had played a minor role in Day's 1968 hit film, ""With Six You Get Eggroll"".  She was at the time the wife of CBS sitcom actor Ken Berry.

As in seasons past, the series was sumptuous to look at and boasts a enviable line-up of guest stars.  Everyone from Bob Crane, Iris Adrian, Harold Peary, Robert Lansing, John Fiedler, Gordon Jump, Van Johnson, Barbara Nichols, Alan Hale, Jr., Regis Toomey, Barbara Hale, John Banner, Werner Klemperer to almost 90 year old Estelle Winwood, adds their own special skill to the proceedings. Day also finds a love interest in a dashing doctor portrayed by veteran Peter Lawford.

One of the most hilarious episodes has Miss Day masquerading as Santa Claus while attempting to unravel a mystery.  Charles Nelson Reilly makes a strong impression in that episode. As had become the custom, there is a fashion show episode in which Miss Day gets to show off her stunning figure in a dazzling array of early 70's fashions. Another highpoint is the episode in which Day and Ballard go to a health spa.

While there may be series that are better remembered or admired today, ""The Doris Day Show"" has one element that none of them possess - Doris Day. She can make even the most inane or seemingly uneventful plotlines take on something very unique and special by the sheer presence and sincerity that she brings to everything she does.

The fourth season is due out in February, 2007. Rumor has it that there will be a lot of specials and extras.  Judging from those contained on seasons 1-3, that in itself makes them something to anticipate.

So go out and get a copy and sit down and prepare to enjoy yourself. It's the perfect remedy for the cabin fever that is certain to be present by late February. Doris Day will bring enough sunshine to eradicate even Seasonal Affective Disorder.",1163980800,45,3175,4.791208791208791

2684375,2,B000K7VL4M,"Season four of ""The Doris Day Show"" makes me feel like I'm watching science fiction, where characters get sucked into a black hole never to be seen again.

I love Doris; I'm a big fan of her movies and I like the previous seasons of this show, but this one was weird for me.  Suddenly, her boys, Billy and Toby, are not there and there's no mention of them.  Maybe they're hidden away with Tiger from ""The Brady Bunch"" and Chuck, the oldest son from ""Happy Days.""  There's never a mention of what became of these beloved pets and, more shockingly, beloved family members.  Where DID they go??  Add to that, the magazine where she works has apparently cleaned house...Myrna, Mr. Harvey and Mr. Nicholson are gone.  I can only hope they're taking care of Billy and Toby in... THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

The season starts with Doris Martin going about her life and work without any explanation whatsoever to the viewing audience as to why she's no longer a mother, or why Rose Marie as Myrna is no longer there as her best friend, or why she has no connection to her father or the farm or, well...the list goes on and on.  O.K., I know this show was never high art; it was always fluff, but it was fun & enjoyable fluff; better still, plausible fluff.  This season, the genius that is T.V. executives asked us to suspend all rational belief.  Doris Day deserved better and so did we.

They did keep Billy DeWolfe as next-door neighbor Mr. Jarvis and Kaye Ballard as friend and restaurant owner, Angie Pallucci.  But Katie bar the door at Today's World Magazine...that place was like a sieve with employees being sifted out left and right.  Gone was the lovable McLean Stevenson as her boss and in was John Dehner as boss Cy Bennett.  Nothing at all against Dehner; I like him, but it's hard to like anyone in this situation.  He and Doris have an almost psychotically hostile relationship.  Jackie Joseph was brought in as his secretary, but given very little to do.  A very thin and shaggy-haired Peter Lawford was added as Doris' love interest.

There are some preposterous plots; she travels to France and becomes part of a diamond heist, but wait...there's more:  Most unintentionally funny plot?  She is taken hostage by Middle Eastern rebels (stop laughing; it's true).  I don't know what was more unbelievable, the hostage situation or the acting by said rebels.  Most annoying plot?  The supposed Christmas episode.  Seasons two and three Christmas shows are charming.  But this debacle has Doris investigating someone dressed as Santa who committed a murder.  Most entertaining?  The ever-popular fashion show.  And most ridiculous?  Doris is required to be her doctor boyfriend's surgical nurse for an emergency operation at sea.

There are 24 episodes.  Extras include:  interviews with Jackie Joseph and Kaye Ballard, an episode of ""Pet Set,"" hosted by Betty White with guests Doris Day and Billy DeWolfe and more.

Some, like me, may want to get this season to complete their collection and enjoy the effervescence that is Doris, regardless of the material; others may want it for the weirdness that T.V. often brings...but remember - ""You are traveling through another dimension, a dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind. A journey into a wondrous land of imagination. Next stop, the Twilight Zone!""",1334620800,5,3314,4.796819787985866
2684376,1,B000K7VL4M,"Suddenly, Doris' children and father have disappeared. Viewers asked why their funerals weren't covered. Was it some terrible automobile accident or an earthquake? So, if you lose your father and children, you comfort yourself by having fashion shows. Doris Day herself said this series was ill conceived, and that she isn't proud of it. I agree, Doris. I give it 1 star, Doris Day wishes to forget she ever did it. One thing I will say, even at her age, she looked great in the expensive clothes. Although some looked like they should be on younger women, she still had a great figure.

Let's face it, Doris Day is wonderful, but she was never able to adapt to television. She still thought she was doing a Hollywood premier, not a TV series. This is a boring season, if you want excitement, watch the grass growing on your lawn.",1253577600,5,830,4.608108108108108
2684377,5,B000K7VL4M,"Having already placed my review for this series with Season 5, I cannot stress enough that out of all 5 seasons, both this and 5 are the best of the whole series. It is a shame that Doris felt that the series ran it's course by Season 5, but to me, after seeing the previous episodes, I think there were a few more years of laughs left with what seems to be all in place, and Doris looking comfortable in her role.",1247097600,,414,4.060975609756097
2684378,1,B000K7VL4M,"I loved season 1 and season 2 - laughed and really enjoyed them. But seasons 3 and 4 - I wasted $40! Doris Day has done so much better! Totally different than the first two seasons.. gone were the kids, and the comedy, the ""working mother of two"" and is now the woman all men are after and suddenly she is on the wealthy side of things! I have watched both seasons today and haven't cracked a smile.  It's like they took a low budget drama storyline and tried, unsuccessfully, to put some comedy in to the story. The storylines were just to serious to be comedic. The liveliness and comedy in these 2 seasons is completely missing... stick with the first 2 seasons!",1239494400,9,665,4.362903225806452

8154981,4,B000K7VL4M,"If you watch this season with an open mind then you'll highly enjoy if you're a Doris Day fan.  Otherwise, if you watch this season constantly wondering what happened to Doris' sons from the previous seasons, Billy and Toby, as well as her former boss and former best friend/co-worker Myrna, then you're not going to enjoy it.  I've read other comments stating that Doris' sons went back to the farm to help her father Buck, but I disagree with that logic.  Based upon dialogue that is spoken during this season with Doris mentioning working with her former boss Cy during the last few years, I like to believe that season four starts maybe ten years or so AFTER season three meaning that her sons are now grown and perhaps working and/or in college.  And it makes sense that people come and leave at all jobs so her previous co-workers could have perhaps gotten married, moved elsewhere within the company, and/or have gotten jobs elsewhere.  Only with this point-of-view I can enjoy this season.  Otherwise, you're too busy wondering what happened to everyone!

I can say that I do enjoy Doris' character dating a lot more in this season.  And the extras are as always FANTASTIC.  Especially the special feature of the show ""The Pet Set"" with Betty White.
