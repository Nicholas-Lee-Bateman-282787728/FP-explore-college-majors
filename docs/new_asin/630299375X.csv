Some of the best one's in my opinion are ""Somewhere in Dreamland"" (1936), ""Christmas Comes but Once a Year"" (1936), and ""Jack Frost"" (1934). You can look these up on YouTube as well. These are all old cartoons, but that makes it unique and a special VHS to keep in the collection of Christmas movies. I only wish that it was on DVD now.",1349568000,,394,4.266666666666667

Very truly yours,
Marty",1070755200,5,189,3.6341463414634148
