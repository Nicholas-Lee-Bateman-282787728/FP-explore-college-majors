I think that most people wouldn't believe that religious groups were persecuted to such an extent only that short distance in the past.  Terry's group are treated like they are a danger to the community.  People curse them and call them names while they have they're own children on their shoulders.  Some of the ""christian"" individuals in this video are kind of frightening.  It reminded me of the Salem Witch Trials that took place so long ago.  Some things never change.  One of my favorite parts of the video are the original songs put to video footage.  They include:  Are We America, Children of the Circle, Lady Liberty, and Pagan Man.  This is a one-of-a-kind video.  If you are pagan or interested in religious persecution, you will want to watch this video.",1179619200,4,891,4.6050955414012735
