3646878,5,B001ICUVPS,The DVD's are great.  My girls have been watching them for about 3 weeks now and my 2 year old now knows almost all of her letters!  My 4 and 5 year olds LOVE the sight words DVD's.  They are wonderful educational DVD's.,1237939200,,220,4.069767441860465

3646880,5,B001ICUVPS,"I was debating on which tapes to purchase for my 28 month old son. The reviews for the Leap Frog tapes (DVD pack) are excellent as well. However, I did some comparison and broke each tape down according to what it teaches, and the appropriate age group. I decided that my 2 1/2 year old son would benefit more from the Preschool Prep Series.

When I got the tapes, we started watching the Letters. He loves it! He will sit down and watch for about 10-15 min, then get up and play, but the tape will still be running, so he can still ""watch and learn"" as he plays with other things in the house. I don't play it too much throughout the day, b/c I don't want him to get bored from the tapes. (as i would do for any other program he is watching)

The next day, I put on the colors. Again, he enjoyed watching the colors move around and keep him interested. I would keep my son interested in watching the tapes with him and saying things like ""wow, Hi Q (or R, S etc), how are you today?"" silly things like that, that would get a 2 year old excited.

The tapes do not offer a ton of excitement, but they do play music and keep them wanting more. It's a great beginner tape to introduce them to all the Letters, Numbers, Shapes, and Colors. We have not watched the Sight Words tape yet, but we will get there in time.",1237248000,,1312,4.1171875
3646881,5,B001ICUVPS,I gave these DVD's to twin boys for their second birthday.  The mother has called me twice to tell me how much they are enjoying them.,1235952000,,134,4.153846153846154
3646882,1,B001ICUVPS,"I bought this video set for my 22-month old son (read great reviews about it), hoping it will make him learn the basics. Sad to say, not even one of the videos were able to hold his attention. After 5 minutes, he just turns off the tv. My husband found the videos boring, and my son did as well. Very disappointed. I'll be having another baby soon. I will try to introduce these videos to her at a much younger age and see how it'll go.",1235952000,9,436,4.0813953488372094
3646883,5,B001ICUVPS,My 2 yr old now knows all of his shapes and colors. He also knows 19 letters of the alphabet. He has learned so much from watching these videos.,1233705600,,144,4.0
3646884,5,B001ICUVPS,"I was in the process of buying some Leapfrog videos (which are also very good) and came across this video set. I decided to go ahead and buy it because I wanted the sight words. I have only had the videos for a couple weeks and my three year old loves watching them. We are working on the sight words, but after every viewing, he wants to watch the colors. He already knew the colors by name in English, but he now knows them in Spanish also. These videos work even better when used with flash cards after the show (there is video flash cards on the DVDs, but I also use paper flash cards).

The animation for the videos looks like it's done in Flash and it looks like it was made for the internet. On my big screen, there is a lot of jaggies on the diagonal lines when they move, but it does not distract from the show.

There is not a lot of action in the videos. I have some videos that the story line of the show distracts from the lesson that is being taught and there is so much action that the child doesn't know where to look. These videos are meant to teach and any action is designed to enforce the lesson.

I think that these videos offer a great deal to children and I am very happy I bought them.",1233532800,2,1209,4.071428571428571
3646885,5,B001ICUVPS,"I bought this series for my 2 yr old son and a 3 yr old autistic child in my care.

My son was deathly afraid of the voices at first and would not watch it for more than 1-2 minutes without begging me to turn it off or go to bed (yes, it was that bad).  However, I turned the volume down a lot (well below the norm), and now he absolutely loves the shows.

Now from an adult perspective... they suck!  They're mind numbing, brainwashing, torture!  All they do is repeat the same word over and over and over while showing the shape, letter, or color.

I do give them 5 stars though, because they do what they are meant to do.  They hold the attention of active toddlers while teaching them something useful.  They have helped the autistic child to verbalize and both boys love to watch them.  As painstaking as it is for me to watch them, I would still recommend them.",1232928000,46,867,4.206060606060606
3646886,5,B001ICUVPS,"First my 2 year old grandson amazed us with what he learned  & then our 1 year old followed, we could not believe how fast they picked up letters-numbers -shapes and sight words. My 14 month old knows her numbers & letters - she has about 4 shapes and even though she can't pronounce octagon, she knows it. We were amazed she can even knows a couple of sight words. With continuity between parents -g/parents & daycare they learn quickly and think its fun.
I think I believe what the tapes say about a window of time for learning, just as they are learning to speak. Or maybe my babies are geniuses as I thought.",1232323200,10,612,4.321739130434783
3646887,4,B001ICUVPS,"I bought this DVD set after buying Meet the Sight Words volume 1 and 2.

This collection of DVD's (Meet the Letters, Meet the Numbers, Meet the Shapes, Meet the Colors) definitely skews to a slightly younger viewer than the Meet the Sight Words DVD's. So if your child is already making progress in the Meet the Sight Words DVD's, then I would not recommend this set since your child probably already knows most of this content by then.

I've also noticed that the narrator did not sound very enthusiastic in the Meet the Numbers DVD. I think that's the creator of the series. Still, her delivery of some of the numbers (such as the number 7) is flat and unenthusiastic.

The Meet the Colors DVD is good if your child doesn't know the colors yet. But if he or she already does, the DVD would be very repetitive in terms of the content it teaches. Though it does make a good effort in teaching the same colors in several different ways.

The Meet the Shapes DVD is a bit short on shapes. I noticed that there was ""octagon"" but not ""pentagon"" or ""hexagon"".

This set makes a great gift. But get this set before your child goes through the Meet the Sight Words DVD's.",1231891200,28,1164,4.395348837209302
3646888,1,B001ICUVPS,"I am astounded that this has a high average rating.  We bought the Letters, Numbers, Colors, Shapes set and it is the most cheaply-produced thing I've ever seen.  The ONLY thing on the DVDS is a showing of each shape/letter/what-have-you for about 2-3 minutes each, while the narrator repeats the name of it over and over and over.  In fairness, a diamond is shown as a black diamond shape, and then a kite flying in the sky, but all they do is repeat the shape name.  There's no ""plot"", as you are lead to believe by the description - where it says ""children easily make the transition from a character to a shape name"".  There is no character, just a shaped turned into something (like a kite) with a face slapped on it.  This is a horrible waste of money, especially since it's so expensive.  They HAD to have paid for all their endorsements, because no one who actually knows anything about how children learn will approve of this set.",1458518400,2,939,4.488235294117647

3646895,3,B001ICUVPS,"These DVDs are more for ages 1-3 years old. Any 4-5 year olds I see watching this get bored with it. My three has been watching since 1 year old because his sister was 4 at the time. She was bored but it kept him interested and he learned very quickly. My daughter did like the sight words with their corky imagery and bright colors. She also loved the colors when they danced at the end. Also, at the end of the sight words dvd, a child in the DVD reads to a book which highlights the words as the child in the DVD reads them. It helped my daughter with her reading as she began to recognize the words. The narrator of the DVDs is very mono tone. Sometimes emphasize and silliness is key to have things stick in your child's mind. Of it makes them laugh, chances are they'll remember it later versus someone mono tone repeating a letter, color, shape, or word. I've had both a bored and interested kiddo with these DVDs. So it appears to work for some but not all. The coloring books that preschool prep did way more for my daughter than the dvds.",1453161600,2,1048,4.218905472636816

Every video that my kids were exposed to, they learned the concept within a week or 2.

After week 6, I randomly showed them images of the alphabet, shapes, numbers and colors on the iPad, and they responded correctly about 90% of the time.

I was SHOCKED to find that he learned all of his upper case AND lower case letter simultaneously within a week of watching them only in the car when we were out and about!!  He also learned his shapes and numbers within a few days of watching the videos in the car!!  I spent months and MONTHS teaching my older two these things through games and lessons, but these videos made it VERY quick and easy for me.  I now recommend them to anyone I know!  They are not exciting or fun like the Leap Frog movies, but I have found that my kids will watch anything in the car and paid attention to the videos and enjoyed them that way.",1421020800,,1053,4.127450980392157

My boy has now found a great interest in Preschool Prep. In fact he loves it and so does my youngest. Will be purchasing the full dvd set soon.

I read the reviews before purchasing and thought to myself ""Well, everybody is different when it comes to learning."" I was very disappointed with what I bought. I would rather have my children watch the free Preschool Prep preview videos on YouTube! Plus I found a ton of educational material on YouTube(BusyBeaversTv and Kids123) that will suffice for now. I will not purchase any other Preschool Prep Dvd collection's.",1416787200,4,583,4.83

3647020,5,B001ICUVPS,These movies are AMAZING!!! My daughter knew her colors AND shapes before she was one and could say them all!!!! For those unaware of how the young minds work they work through repetition!!

3647050,5,B001ICUVPS,"The best review that I read about this DVD was from someone who said ""It's Awful, now buy it"". Sure enough, the video seems boring and redundant, but my kid can sit and watch this for an hour and it ABSOLUTELY worked. This product gave my daughter a solid foundation that gave her the confidence to master her reading skills over the years. She is currently in 1st grade but reads on a 4th grade level.

We introduced our daughter to this sight package when she was somewhere between 2 and 3 years old. By the time she was 3 1/2years old, she could easily recognize all of these words and began reading sight word books with ease. Currently, she is in 1st grade and she just breezes through EVERY  sight word test they give her. Learning to read is the last thing that my kid has to worry about right now.

I often recommend this to parents of classmates who are struggling with sight words.....and I donated my DVD's to her kindergarten teacher last year. The teacher loved it!",1407801600,4,978,4.4222222222222225
3647051,5,B001ICUVPS,"I started the first series with my daughter when she was around a year old. By 18 months she could tell you all of her letters, numbers, shapes and colors even in real life situations (not just when watching these videos). Obviously you have to work with your child on recognition in real life but these videos absolutely lay the foundation for it. She is 3 years old now and knows all of her phonics and most of her sight words. She has moved onto reading simple sentenced books now and sounds out the words she doesn't know in combination with the learned sight words. Once again I credit this series for laying the foundation for all of it. I'd recommend this series to anyone and everyone. Yes, it's annoying to listen to as an adult because it's all simple repetition but it's worth every second. I have a 5 month old as well and plan on introducing this series to her when she is around a year old.",1406851200,,904,4.355029585798817

3647054,3,B001ICUVPS,"Okay folks, I was so happy to get a used copy of this from Amazon. It came on Saturday and my husband and I played it for my daughters while we were cooking breakfast on Sunday. My coworker mentioned this to me months ago. It wasn't in the budget until I saw it used.

Pros:
- It gets to the point quickly
- It's very relevant to what the 2 year old and 10 month need to learn.
- I love that it plays without watching a lot of commercials first. We don't have a remote to the DVD so I can hit play a few seconds after putting it in and I don't have to walk back.

Cons:
- It drags a little. It's too slow. If my daughter had never watched Leapfrog movies it would be okay, but she LOVES Leapfrog. I have to peel her away from the TV because she is too close when watching any of her Leap DVDs.  We have watched 3 preschool prep DVDs. They keep her attention for a several minutes then she gets distracted. I found it to be entirely too slow for me. I can watch Leapfrog movies with no problem. This may be best for my 10 month old and not the 2 year old.
- The animation is okay, not extraordinary. Leapfrog is better.
- My concern is that if I didn't purchase this used I would have paid ""leapfrog money"" for this. This product should not cost the same as Leap dvds. I have noticed the price has dropped for larger box sizes.
- Yes, it's useful. Yes, it teaches the basics with fewer thrills.  If a child doesn't have Leapfrog DVDs this is a great gift idea. But, the entertainment value is not the same.

In short, Leapfrog is more entertaining to child and Mama. I like to see competition in the market. So I don't regret the purchase.",1405296000,,1638,4.0588235294117645
3647055,1,B001ICUVPS,"I purchased this set of DVD's over a year ago.  My main goal was to play these DVD's in my vehicle.  Apparently, this series (2006 series) are not made to be played in a vehicle. I recently realized this when buying the phonics DVD's and receiving 2011 series DVD's with those that did work.  I am not happy with this.  I feel that the buyer should be made aware that you're essentially getting old DVD's.  So, when buying these, make sure that you're getting updated copies, not the old ones. Very disappointed, as these were not cheap.",1404950400,4,537,4.494845360824742
3647056,5,B001ICUVPS,"These DVDs may not speak to a child who watches a lot of tv & expects fast moving animation, BUT in terms of brain based learning, they are great!  Repetition is very important, old studies showed we need to see something 5-7 times to master it, however newer studies have shown that it may take as many as 60 times. These videos use this principle.  Color & movement also make it easier to remember because you can associate the action that the letter was doing or the color it was, or both. It just became meaningful, which is the key to a long lasting lane. Additionally, the actions the v letters are doing are things that children see in the world in a regular basis, so they have context for what they are seeing, another key for learning & memory. This works for the auditory learning, visual, and for my son, kinesthetic (he often acts it what the letters are doing).  As a teacher of psychology and a special ed parent, recommend these dvds all the time. There is sound, brain based learning in these videos. Just because it isn't the way it's done in schools, doesn't mean it's bad or wrong. Just like there are many ways to do a math problem, there are many ways to teach a concept.",1404950400,4,1193,4.389140271493213

We started playing them for my son around the time he had turned 1 and he would watch them every day (1 dvd at a time for a few weeks) and he LOVED them!  Almost immediately he was able to identify shapes and colors, even though he couldn't say the words yet.  Shortly after he had learned all his letters and numbers and by the time he was 18 months he knew all his shapes, colors, letters and numbers!  My son is very active and always going but he'll actually sit still to watch these dvds and really learns from them!  He is now 2 1/2 and knows all 50 + sight words (from the other collection) and is working on his phonics (other collection).  He knows so much more than any of the other 2 and even 3+ year olds we know thanks to these dvds!  As a parent it feels so good to have help on teaching your child these things (especially a kid who doesn't want to sit still to learn), but he absorbs this knowledge like a sponge thanks to these dvds.  I know a few reviews said they were boring and they aren't really entertaining but they do exactly what they need to do to re-enforce your child learning these things.  I don't let my child watch too much TV and am so happy to put him in front of these and watch him learn!  I recommend these dvds to every mom I know!",1403136000,,1301,4.086614173228346

3647094,5,B001ICUVPS,"I have read many reviews that say their child either hate or love these dvds. Honestly, I hadn't even seen these dvds until my 3 year old and I went to a ""story time reading"" at the local library. Every week, she is allowed to borrow one book and one dvd. Now my daughter doesn't watch a lot of tv to begin with, but when she does... they include Word World, Super Why, and Sid the science kid. She also likes Little Einstein's but not something she watches all the time.
My child leans toward very educational programing and doesn't watch a lot of empty entertainment. 30 minutes a day and the rest of the time it is hands on learning time. With all this background put into consideration, my child loves watching things that will make her think, interact, and learn. I recommend going to your local library fist, borrow the dvds (they might not have the set, but they have them individually available). Have your child choose from, meet the numbers, colors, or letters. So they feel more in charge of what they are watching.
Bring it home and see how your child reacts. This can take up to three days. Some children love it right away, while other children need it simply in the background as they play with their toys. Yes it might seem ""boring"" as some people have stated, but the repetitive words actually help the child (not us!). We know our letters, numbers, and colors (One would hope ;)....) It will help the child/children recall what they are learning by the repetitive recalling of the said subject matter.
I borrowed the dvd meet the letters, and my daughter begged me to allow her to also borrow, meet the numbers (that was also available), I decided to let her (I am really glad I did) after a week, I was online buying this complete set! Mainly because, my daughter decided she loved the two dvds so much that she didn't want to share or give the dvds back to the library! My daughter loved the dvds instantly, so I did buy this set. So far she loves the colors, letters, and numbers, she is so so with the shapes. All around with these dvds, my daughter loves the main menu where we can choose to watch all of it, and then look over flash cards, and other options as well. For the most part my daughter understood her colors, shapes, numbers (counting 1-15), and also recognized all of her letters (just not in order, she knows all the letters and their sounds).
After three weeks with all the dvds (between borrowing them and now owning them), she repeats the colors every chance she sees them, same with shapes, and now she also says all the letter in order (her favorite letter is W!), I feel do to watching these, she now wants to count higher than the dvd (we now can count to 29 she can actually counts to 30, but when she gets to 29 she says she doesn't like 30 and doesn't want to add that number after 29! ha ha ha). So with this super long review, I will wrap it up like this.... I love the set, we have now pushed out dvd watching time to almost an hour and a half a day! Do to my child wanting to spend more hands on time with all her educational toys and repeating the said subject be it numbers, letter, shapes, or colors!
I truly think these are great products, and if you are unsure how your child will react; borrow them from the local library, be prepared to head right back here and buy them! Because, they are great products!!!",1400976000,,3365,4.351351351351352

This program teaches by repetition (playing the same letters, shapes, sounds, words) over and over and over again. I have 4 children and have tried multiple programs. My youngest child has learned more and is further ahead than any of her siblings at her age. I've never seen a program that works this well!

3647096,5,B001ICUVPS,"I've been showing this series to my baby boy since he was 7 months old. We started with letters/colors/numbers/shapes and did about 1 or 2 DVDs a day (they are about 30 min long). They are mind-numbingly dull for parents and older children, but my baby loved them!  He started to show signs of absorbing the information by 12 months-he could show a couple numbers (namely, 1 & 5) and could retrieve colored balls on command fairly accurately.  But without verbal communication, I wasn't sure how much of the other information he was retaining.

Now at 22 months, he knows all his colors, shapes, letters and numbers - even some of the phonic sounds and sight words. He is off the charts on his verbal skills and ability to recall the names of things. And he still enjoys watching the DVDs. He seems to notice new things and key in to different aspects now that he's older.

This program is amazing and I highly recommend it to pretty much everyone I meet. However, I think one of the keys to it being successful is starting young and avoiding other 'flashier' programs.  If this is the best thing your child is watching on TV, they will absolutely be enthralled by it, but it can't compare to Dora/Bubble Guppies/etc as far as animation goes.",1400025600,3,1242,4.576576576576577

Once they know them, they identify numbers, colors and letters all around them in their environment and they get so excited!! I highly recommend the phonics and sight words as well. My girls are early and exceptional readers and I credit these videos. There is no way to completely avoid TV with kids, and I figure if they're going to watch, why not make it educational? Plus they love them as much as Dora or any other mindless cartoon, but they learn so much while watching. I'm amazed at how fast they learn too!!!

Our 4 and 5 year olds loved it.  They liked guessing the words that the letters were trying to depict.  Like I think G wore glasses.  And H was hiking.

She said that they seem strange to adults but for some reason her kids (4 1/2 and 3) really love them and will pick them over Disney videos sometimes.  That impressed me.  So I requested the sight words videos from our library and put it on.  My 5 year old lost interest after a little while but my 3 year old was glued to it.  I would put it on for my 3 year old each day when he asked for it and the more he watched it the more my daughter became interested.  Now she loves it as well!  She went through 2 years of preschool and didn't learn any sight words so for me this was a wonderful.  Now they point out words and blends and diagraphs when we are out running errands.  We continue to use them as part of their language arts studies.  We have used all the sights words videos as well as the Phonics diagraphs and blends as well as the letter sounds.  I am amazed by how much I am learning as well, since this is my first year home schooling.  I would highly recommend these videos.  My daughter learned far more from watching these videos then I could have taught her while I run after a 3 year old and care for a one year old.  These videos have been a real life saver.  My advice is to request them from your local library and put them on during lunch.  I don't normally let the kids watch videos during the day, so for them it's a treat.  We request these from the library so often (at the kids request) that I am now looking into buying them.  I can vouch that these videos are super helpful.

I am a math teacher by trade, but I had no clue on how to go about teaching him things like letters or sight words. We were just doing flash cards as often as he'd allow. After nearly a semester in preschool and worked with both my husband and I, he was only able to learn about 8 letters (by learn I mean that he could correctly identify them doing flashcards). We bought this DVD set to help. He has only watched the ""Meet the Letters"" DVD in the car for about 10 - 15 minutes at a time, just driving to therapy or preschool, most days of the week. Within two weeks he went from knowing 8 letters to 20 letters, and able to correctly pick out all of the letters when all the cards are laid out. This is both for upper case and lower case.

Obviously, your mileage may vary and what works for my kid will not necessarily work for yours. He requests this often in the car, but he's a captive audience there.

3647164,5,B001ICUVPS,"These DVDs are wonderful.  My son is two years old and knows all of his colors and most of his shapes.  We're currently working on numbers.  The DVD starts out by introducing each number.  The ""narrator"" says the number multiple times with different tones and different inflections so the child knows no matter who says it or how it's said that number is still that number.  This is great because I definitely don't have the patience to do that.  The DVD then turns the  subject into a cute character that will intrigue your child and keep them interested.  Then they slowly remove the character and leave behind the subject.  This cycle repeats several times for an hour.  This is the case with all of the DVDs that we've watched so far.  We haven't ventured into the sight words yet.  Some of the DVDs say for 9 months to 5 years and a couple of them say for 15 months to 5 years.  My son is two years and three months, but I still don't see us attempting the sight words any time soon due to his lack of an attention span.  What is nice about how the DVDs are set up is each new subject is a chapter.  So when we were learning colors and he was having a hard time remembering purple, black, and white, we could just jump to those particular chapters for a quick refresher. These were recommended to me from a friend of mine that has been teaching pre-k for several years.  After the wonderful experience we've had, I highly them to you.",1384560000,2,1439,4.333333333333333

But my son loves them! He wakes up in the morning and instead of watching a stupid cartoon he asks for ""letters"" or ""shapes"". I mean, he knows what an octagon is! I have been raving about this set to all my friends and I'm just waiting to find the sight words on sale to get those as well.

3647178,5,B001ICUVPS,I started using the shapes and letters and colors DVD with my nine month old daughter. In the beginning her attention span was only two or three minutes. But this was developmentally appropriate so as time went on her length of attention span increased. I think. It is important to work on attention span with children at a very young age. Before she was a year old she was able to identify receptively her colors and lowercase letters by pointing to the letter or color in a field of two or three. I highly recommend the preschool prep DVD series. I also think the leapfrog letter factory is fabulous for children who are over 18 months. The preschool prep series is better for younger children such as six months to 18 months. They also have a phonics series as well.,1379030400,,769,4.5

She immediately loved the DVD and would watch it, or just have it as background noise.  I had no idea if she was absorbing the info or not since she couldn't talk.  Around the time she was 18 months i had a birthday card that said ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY"" and asked her ""where is the B' and she would point to the correct letter, then i kept asking her other letters and realized she knew all of them! I was amazed.  Around this time she also knew all her numbers.  Shapes and colors she knew by the time she was 2.  All my fellow moms ask me how i taught her all this info...and all i can say is that this DVD taught my daughter EVERYTHING.

3647220,5,B001ICUVPS,"My son is now 20 months and until recently he would only say a few words. He understood a lot but just couldn't get his words out. We got the DVD's about a month ago and we try to play them at least every other day and I've noticed they have really helped. Initially, we would just play them at home but I noticed he would watch the first few minutes then go play with his toys. So I transferred them to his tablet and now every time we are in the car he watches the DVD's and it's been perfect! My son still rear faces so he has nothing better to do then watch his DVD's! Anyway, one day while in the car I hear this beautiful little voice repeat the word ""purple"" I was ecstatic!! From mommy and daddy to purple! I couldn't believe my ears! As soon as we got out of the car I pointed to something purple and asked what color it was and again he said purple! I've also realized that although, he hasn't said the other colors he knows them and will point them out for me. In addition, I had downloaded the preschool prep vowels flashcard app (itunes, it's free) and while playing with it he repeated A and I. So I made some flashcards and realized he knew and said A B D and I. So in all, we are very pleased with these DVD's. I feel they provided our son a nice start for learning his ABC's, colors, shapes and numbers. I think after seeing that he could learn the alphabet at 20 months, my husband and I have become more proactive in practicing with him. Right now we are focused on the alphabet, so I made him some ABC flashcards out of foam (the paper ones are too flimsy and I wanted something with just the letter)<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crafters-Square-Foam-Sheets-20-Sheets-Various-Colors/dp/B005M6AK0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crafters Square Foam Sheets (20 Sheets) Various Colors</a>, we also got him&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hape-Alphabet-Puzzle/dp/B0077RKXWE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hape Alphabet Puzzle</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Munchkin-Bath-Letters-Numbers-Girl/dp/B007XTGJWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Munchkin Bath Letters & Numbers - Girl</a>

3647221,5,B001ICUVPS,"At first, I was a little skeptic about it because as many reviewers have pointed it out, it is really repetitive and I thought I was just going to shoot myself the first two weeks. Totally boring for parents and my two year old son hates the Letters so much he covers his eyes the whole time.
But the reality is that after a couple of months, he knows his colors, numbers and shapes, he is on his way to master all three Sight words DVDs. It is amazing. The daycare he goes to sucks and I know for a fact that he is not learning a thing over there (though the instructors are very nice).
But the bottom line is this: the people who made these DVDs know toddlers and preschoolers. They know that repetition works. When your child starts preK or kindergarten, that's the method they will use, make no mistake about that. You won't be there to go through that horror with your child but it will be all about repetition, again and again and again... till it finally sticks. That is what these DVDs do. My son is now so eager to read, it is almost scary. The sight words DVDs made him realize that he does not know lower case letters as much as he initially thought. He knows his upper cases perfectly but needs a little more work on his lower case which is normal for kids of that age. But now, wherever he goes, he tries to read just like he saw it on his DVDs, the traffic signs, the ads in the street, everything. And we know these DVDs helped him in that regard. A lot. I am now ordering the other DVDs about the phonics and totally recommend these DVDs.",1367280000,7,1554,4.20066889632107
3647222,4,B001ICUVPS,"I showed these videos to children ages 19 months - 3 years. I did each video for 2 weeks, and they watched it once a day Monday-Friday. The 3 year olds pretty much already knew the colors and shapes and some numbers and letters. The toddlers would repeat the names of some shapes and colors, but not necessarily match them to the correct shape/color. It has brought up awareness of color and shape names for the toddlers, but they didn't really get the numbers or letters. I continue to show the videos occasionally as a review for the children, and they have always really enjoyed them. The letters one is too long to watch all at once, and they even recommend breaking it up into sections. Each DVD has extras on the menu, where you can do flashcards, or some entertaining review video, or choose each color/shape separately. For the price, I think it was worth the money and would buy it again. I think as the toddlers get older, they will understand more and more from the videos. I think having the same videos to show them over the next year will help them really memorize it. So, it's not as I expected, as they advertise that it will take like 3 weeks and they'll learn it and it will be amazing that young toddlers pick it up so fast.

He could do the same for the numbers 0-10 by 14 months. We were very proud parents but thought perhaps our child was a genius (what first time parent doesn't?). Nope, worked the same for his little brother, who we started on the videos a bit later and not as regular (his older sibling provided a lot of entertainment/distraction), but he still caught on quickly and at about 14 months knew them all.

I'd say the sweet spot in age is probably 8-15 months old for these videos. Our kids were glued to the TV when these were on, until about 15-16 months old and by then needed something more (or maybe they were just bored since they knew it all). Some parents find the repetitious voice annoying but it never bothered myself or my husband. I find Sesame Street characters and many animated voices far more irritating!

We have the 3 sight word DVDs as well and feel they have helped our kids with the basics of early reading, but there is simply no comparison to the first DVDs in terms of progress - it's amazing to witness a child recognize any letter by age 1. I'd prefer them learning and catching on with these videos to any other TV or technology-based media (tablets/computer games) for short spurts of time. In other words, if you have to give them TV time at a young age, this is the way to do it!

An added bonus: you can select English or Spanish on the DVD.

It's truly remarkable how effective these DVD's are.  We try & limit how much she is watching, and I must admit, these DVD's are QUITE annoying to me as an adult, but they captivate her.  The most amazing part is that she is really learning from them, and not just memorizing the DVD.  Like I said, she applies the information to things all around her today and doesn't just remember the information when watching the DVD's.

I am very impressed at how quickly both of my girls picked up and learned all of their shapes, colors, numbers and sight words!! My two year seemed to be having trouble identifying her colors and shapes - after two or three viewings of the DVDs she was shouting out the correct shape etc as soon as it showed on the screen. The sight words have seemed to whet my five year old's appetite for reading as she can now identify them on signs, packages and in her books.
I also  bought the flash cards and a separate workbook specifically for sight words  for reinforcement. I play a game with the flash cards. I lay them all out on the floor in front of the tv, put on the sight words DVD and as soon as the sight word appears on the screen they have to find the card on the floor and bring it back to me. Whoever hands the most correct cards to me wins - or I give a mini m&m for each correct card. The kids love it!
I'm giving the pack only four stars however, because I was not impressed with meet the letters. I believe that children should learn letter sounds first so that they can transition from letters to reading easier and not be confused.

As one reviewer pointed out, what is boring to an adult isn't always so for a child, so I figured I'd give it a try. BIG MISTAKE. I bought the 4 disk pack and I'm really kicking myself because after popping in the ""Meet the Letter's' DVD we only made it to the letter D before the kids were over it. Literally, there is nothing more to this DVD then that they flash the letter on the screen--and then say the letter over and over. You might as well go get yourself a set of flash cards and use those with the kids--its essentially the same as this DVD.

We have Leapster's Letter Factory and both my boys LOVE it. Now I'm wondering what I'm going to do with 4 worthless disks that aren't going to be watched and that got a total play time of 7 minutes. ;/ VERY dissatisfied, what a waste of money. ;(",1337904000,71,956,4.224043715846994

He is now reading, and it made it so much easier for him that he knew those hard to sound out words by sight.  The first video begins with ""of"" which is the absolute most difficult word to read because neither of the letters in the word follow the phonics rules.  My 2 1/2 year old has watched these videos a handful of times over the last 6 months because I didn't think he was quite old enough for them, but he has picked up several of the sight words.

Learning shapes was also really easy for him with these amazing videos.  My jaw fell open when I realized he recognized the sight words and began saying them when prompted by video...he is only two and recognizes 48 sight words!  I would definitely say that these videos are geared for babies and toddlers... Also, my son does not watch a lot of television...when I do turn it on he is mesmerized and watches the videos intently.  I have been a second grade teacher for 8 years and thanks to these videos my son has mastered concepts at the age of two that many of my students struggle with in second grade.

I watch all of these videos with them and talk to them about what they see. You need to make connections between the videos and books they can read.  I recommend buying the sets of reading books and the coloring books that come with the Preschool series.  We have moved on to ""Heidi Songs"" DVD's and CD's.  The 2 year old can also read, sing, and spell most of the sight words she sees.  Singing, moving, and reading help to better develop a child's multi-sensory skills.",1332028800,,789,4.507042253521127

3647366,5,B001ICUVPS,"As a former teacher now stay at home mom, I was skeptical that these would actually teach my son at such a young age. I started putting them on when he was about 9 mos. while I took a shower. He probably watched each one 1 time per week. By 19 mos. he can identify and say all of his colors, shapes, numbers 1-10 and 23/26 letters. He even points out numbers and letters at stores and while I'm driving. I reinforce a little but definitely don't spend time drilling him, haha. People are amazed at what he knows and even his Pediatrician was surprised at his language skills. I always tell others it's because of these DVDs, I definitely cannot take all the credit. I am considering homeschooling him and will buy the sight words DVDs. I'm also looking into purchasing other preschool prep products online. I HIGHLY recommend these.

3647367,5,B001ICUVPS,"Here in Hong Kong it's very normal for kids to learn to read early. English is merely a warm-up for the serious thing, Chinese. At nearly 2 and a half years of age, my son can count into the twenties and read and spell (but not write with a pen) all the words taught in the DVD. and it's nothing to do with us, he wouldn't listen to us -- he has learned everything from the preschool DVDs.

He started with the numbers at 1, shapes at 14 months, colors at 18 months, sight words at 24 months, which is where he's at now. We actually started showing him the colors when he was about 10 months but he was not particularly impressed and much preferred Noddy in toyland. We insisted for a few weeks and then gave up. All his playground mates knew colors, he didn't, but we didn't want him to enter the rat race and figured he'd pick it up eventually, as after all we had. One day he got us to play ""meet the numbers"", which we hadn't planned to show him since he still didn't know his colors, but that's what he liked and he learned the numbers in a week or so. From then on his learning has gone almost uninterrupted (interruptions included Noddy, Mickey, Pingu, Shaun the sheep). Because he started the numbers quite early he actually spent quite a bit of time on that DVD, whereas the colors were digested in about one month, once he was ready for it.

Timing will greatly affect your kid's experience. I'd suggest guiding your child and letting your child decide too, if like our son he prefers to learn numbers before colors. Apart from the obvious fact that kids shouldn't spend too much time in front of a TV set, our experience is that a child of one can benefit from these DVDs. The reviewers who reported that their child was bored had much older children than that --- the first 3 DVDs on numbers, colors, and shapes are designed for the very young, that's why the numbers only go up to 10.

Kids' ability to memorize at the age of 2 or 3 is unbelievable. My son would ask me to play such or such DVD saying ""my! my! my!"" or ""it! it! it!"" and I would wonder what he was trying to say until I noticed that the DVD cover of one volume had a big ""my"" on it, of another a big ""it"" on it, etc. As I wrote earlier, our son wouldn't learn from us, but we would sit patiently with him and watch the DVDs with him, and he liked that. It's fair to say that the DVDs are much better teachers than us. One reviewer said that it could be torture for the parents to listen, but I for one didn't experience it that way at all, I didn't mind it that they would repeat ""yellow"" a dozen times, I enjoyed it.

A little off topic but of possible interest: I strongly recommend the ""Baby Einstein"" series (I hate the name), which our son loved and still loves so much. Especially good for an urban child to see the countryside, animals, agricultural machines. It doesn't work for an adult so well, but our son absolutely loves the series. And another absolutely awesome thing are all the learning apps you can get on a smartphone (especially on the iphone, not so much on android as of Feb 2012). While we were traveling my 2 and half year old son borrowed my android phone, which only has one half-decent app for kids, while I was dozing, returned it to me after half an hour and proceeded to count from 1 to 10 ... in French! Absolutely unbelievable. So get those apps now and teach your kid foreign languages too!",1329350400,2,3402,4.24537037037037

 I like how simple the letters are when shown on screen (no distractions), the fact  that they also show different formats of lowercase lettering (a and g for instance), then the letters change to an actual animation. They have lots of repetition with each letter, which is awesome for babies learning. I will pull out his flash cards while watching the alphabet, so hes seeing and hearing on the Tv, but also seeing and hearing with a hands on activity.

Within one week, my son can recite numbers 1-10, he hasn't got zero down yet and doesn't fully have them in order, but after only a week, I think its amazing. He likes to sing along with the alphabet, naming a few letters. He's yet to say the shapes, but can point out which is which when asked. Hes already knew most of his colors and how to say them before I purchased this set, so its more of an added bonus for us. He did start saying ""lo lo"" (yellow), which he never said before.

 He absolutely loves these Dvds, laughs at many of the characters. I will warn you parents, these aren't the most exciting for us to watch over and over again, but my son is learning and fast, so I can live with it.",1328745600,,1435,4.315985130111524

I recommed this greatly. We put it on when I get him dressed in the morning and he has been watching it since he was around 9 months old and he knew A to D with the first 2 weeks. He also speaks very well to be 1 and uses a lot of noises compared to babies his age that have no exposure to things like this.

He likes to watch the Blues Clues videos and Leap Frog videos (also very good) but they do not keep his attention as long as these did. We also watched the numbers video in which he was very interested in as well. We put it on yesterday to entertain my 24 month old and another 48 month old while we did projects with the older children 7 and 9 in youth group.  To my surprise the 7 and 9 year olds got very involved with the video and watched them with the younger ones reinforcing the numbers to them instead of doing the project they had been so eager to do.

3647375,5,B001ICUVPS,"Well, the worst thing I can say about this series is that it is annoying for adults.  Lots of repetition, repeating the names of the colors, numbers, etc over and over and over again.

However, I do realize this works for most children (adults too, as annoying as it is).  My four year old loves them.  The graphics are fun, a lot of the scenes result in squeals of delight from her.  She asks for these videos and that means a lot considering they sit on the shelf along with the Disney collection.

I also discovered that the company Preschool Prep has several iphone apps available which I have purchased to further entertain and enforce the lessons with my child.  While I'm not sure if these will result in improvements in school I don't think they are hurting.  Overall I would consider this a good purchase and would recommend, if only for their entertainment value.

My kids are polar opposites and her very early academic interest was something we weren't quite sure how to nurture and help develop without making it boring for her, her brother didn't show the same interests at her age although he does very well now in school.

She at 18 months old obviously was amazed by all things learned, alphabet was the first, 2 years came sight recognition, then phonics by 2 and a half, then came the song she still likes to change up. I realize most kids sing the song then the recognition, no, she was showing me which letters and numbers were which upper and lower case, then telling me ""Ta"" T, ""Ah"" A, ""MMM"" M and ""Ka"" K, well before the song in it's correct order came out of her little voice.

In the beginning of her fascination we purchased her foam letters, upper and lower case, a friend gave her Leap Frog's fridge alphabet with a number of 3 letter words, that didn't do more than give her letters in another form, wasn't interested just yet in spelling anything, just the letters, which were great, but not enough.

I asked her Pediatrician, he said hmmm, was amazed, he was also my son's Doctor since he was 6 hours old, 18 years before and since, so well familiar with both of them and our family. Said it is a rarity and a joy to see them interested with such intensity and to not force it, try and make it fun and of course read to her. Let her lead and try and give her the tools to show us what she wants to learn this early on. It's easy to push to hard and make it boring or to pressured, so have fun, let them have fun.

Well, so while searching and looking through 'tools' as per his advice we came upon numerous options, my baby can read *NO THEY CAN'T*, leap frog, word world, but not anything with this many levels and varieties of packages that we could afford. I would call this 7 DVD set the FIRST level, the 7 DVDs are where you start, they sell them in many forms, some with letters, numbers, shapes and colors, some with 2 DVDs, some with 3, 4 or this set which I thought the most economically affordable to gauge where we were at exactly, outside of the foam letters, obsession with ""Word World"" on PBS, and so on, of which this set includes Sight Words 1, 2 and 3 which is what I was really after.

We were past and familiar with the alphabet, shapes, colors and numbers. The Numbers DVD covers 1-10 only *This is my negative, needs to cover more than 10 numbers, 20 would be nice, 50 would be better, the concept of MORE than 10 is important, and in my opinion wasteful of your money to pay for just 10 numbers unless you have a year old child).

I will break it down based on her level
Letters - she knows them all and is bored by it because of it's length, it does say to break it up for children that do not know the letters, please understand she was past that, so if your child is not, please follow their advice and break it up into several sessions. We lent it out to a friend with a child 6 months younger, they love it.

Colors - loves this one, even though she knows them, this is entertaining and attractive to her.

Numbers - Boring - 1 through 10, not enough numbers for her, I wish they would have gone further with the numbers.

Shapes - Loves this one, same as the colors, she is entertained by this DVD

Sight words 1-3 are all as captivating as ever, she will watch any of them any time of day all day.

ANYHOW, the videos are not PIXAR quality, they are 2 dimensional and maybe 1980-1990 animation artwork technology, and yes, I was sincerely afraid my daughter would immediately bored. I popped in the first one I knew she knew which was Colors, she was mesmerized, stopped what she was doing and sat down. She knew the colors, but was engaged, much more than any time I'd seen her before in front of a TV show. So, we watched that video and sat down at the dinner table and I popped in Sight words 1, she was glued to it, I had to pause it several times to get her to eat her dinner, which she did, but was so into the experience she barely took her eyes off it. For weeks it was a several times a day thing, she began at about 34 months, and is now 3 and has mastered all of the sight words, she just turned 3, so in 2 months time she has learned every sight word. We can write most any Sight Word and she knows it, she tells us if it appears in a sign, or is on a shirt, in her books, it is amazing, barely 3, (3 years and 4 days old) my child is 'reading' sight words.

I can't give you a regiment as far as a schedule or how many times we watched each one, or how often, and realize when they tell you each experience for each child is different. My son most likely would NOT have had the same result at her age, different personalities, although, I couldn't tell you, he is 15 years older than her and he showed no interest in much more than playing, always running and full of energy. She is those things too, but she has a balance of wanting to learn and wanting to run and kick the soccer ball around.

Understand a very important basis of learning here is that the concept behind Sight Words is memorization, words you know by recognition, as with the Letters in the alphabet, or numbers, NOT by phonetically reading them, so please don't mistake the word 'reading' as actual reading.

The DVDs come with a built in flash card option, where you can use the flash cards on screen aside from playing the DVD beginning to end, and let them use their learned skills to test themselves. Show off what they've learned.

Aside from the DVDs we purchased the Sight Word Flash Cards, she is also obsessed with Flash Cards, these work well on the go and apart from the DVDs.

I just ordered the 3 Phonics DVDs that went on sale and will begin those after Christmas, as they are intended as gifts for the holiday for her. I am hopeful they produce results as well as the others.

I would say, if your child shows an interest I would thoroughly recommend first the foam letters, get both the upper and lower case, remove or separate the numbers to make sure they understand they are not one and the same, take out punctuation symbols (some believe it or not have punctuation in the sets). READ as much as you can to them, we just purchased a wonderful Dr Suess book full of 13 complete stories and his history ""A Bakers Dozen"", she loves his books, she loves reading, this set or this method as a way to nurture the interest and help them without intimidating or overwhelming them.

Hope that helps you with your purchasing decision.
Thanks for reading!",1322006400,,6774,4.233927188226181

3647390,5,B001ICUVPS,"My son first watched Meet the Shapes and I thought I would go nuts from how annoying some of the voices were.  But my son loved them (at age 3) and mostly paid attention to the animated character/picture.  My two sons have now watched all of the DVDs except the newest Phonics dvd multiple times, and my boy is almost 5.  He learned to read mostly from watching these, although I'm doing other Preschool things with him.

Plusses:  Classical musical is played in the background, and the cute, animated letters, numbers, colors, shapes, sight words, and phonics blends all have eyes and mouths.  The sight words and blends are shown doing what they mean or say.  For example, 'on' will be standing or stepping on something.  I can't think of another example right now, as I am not often watching them with my children.  I find some of the voices to be annoying.  I agree with other reviewers that it can be boring, but they are geared for toddlers/preschoolers so the children should enjoy watching them even though the words or letters, etc., are repeated several times.  It surely does help the kids learn to read fast!  I suggest having your toddler watch Meet the Shapes, Meet the Colors, Meet the Numbers first, then watch Meet the Letters before moving on to Meet the Sight Words 1, 2, and 3.  If they don't like them, then don't force them to watch them.  Your older children may sit through them once but shouldn't be required to watch them if they already know how to read.  However, my older son is 6 and still enjoys the music and animation even though he's been a reader for almost a year.  My younger son has learned to read almost a year and a half earlier than my older son, and I believe it is partly due to these DVDs.",1320364800,,1734,4.457142857142857
3647391,5,B001ICUVPS,"Summary:

The PreSchool Prep series is excellent FOR WHAT IT IS, but you have to understand what it is before you buy it! I say this as an English teacher and reading specialist with experience working with children from four to twenty, and also as a mother of a six-year-old and a seventeen-month-old.

Disclaimer:

The PreSchool Prep Series is NOT about teaching your child how to read, comprehend, or equate numbers. If you're looking for phonics instruction or word families or blended sounds or help with addition and subtraction, then this is NOT the DVD pack for you. (Then again, how many ""preschoolers"" are doing these things at 3 & 4? Reading-wise, consider this series as a precursor to Level 1 readers or ""A"" readers or what have you.) I don't mention this as a criticism of the DVDs at all. It's OKAY that the DVDs do not do these things as long as you understand what you're buying before you buy it.

One criticism I do have? Well, it's a DVD for kids. Be prepared to go bonkers watching it.

What the DVDs Do Well:

This pack teaches children the most basic building blocks for learning to communicate, and it does it through exposure and repetition--two extremely necessary and educationally-sound techniques for acquiring basic knowledge. Rote learning, or memorization, helps your child recall information quickly and (almost) automatically. In this way, the brain doesn't have to work as hard on the ""basic"" things (because of the network that repetition has created) and can spend more energy focusing on more complicated uses for the information. It's the same as memorizing multiplication tables, the Periodic Chart, anatomy, case law, etc.

PreSchool Prep is NOT about teaching your child to think or read, it's about helping them to free up some mind space to think a little easier, and maybe a little better, because they don't have to sweat the small stuff. Repetition is complementary to more complex learning, not in opposition to it.

This may be controversial to some, but having a child who has memorized the alphabet or the numbers, colors, and shapes by or in preschool will not harm that child. Teaching a child sight words (especially those that don't follow the traditional rules of phonics)--which nearly every elementary school does from various high-frequency word lists--will help that child spare up some space to sound out other words or aid in your child picking up word patterns later on.

Think of it this way: How do you teach your child the ABCs? Do you sing the song? Do you sing it a hundred times over? Do you point to letters in a book and say the letter name? Sometimes, do you add in the sounds the letters make? And do you repeat these things again and again and again? Then you are doing what this DVD pack does, but they're doing it with flashy colors and catchy music and cute little fuzzballs while you're cooking dinner.

Graphics and Sound:

The graphics are slow-moving and unimpressive--which is exactly what they should be for the recommended ages on the DVDs. (The pictures are not as important as the repetition.) Quick, excessive graphics and repetitive patterns can actually work against a child's attention span (see the recent study about SpongeBob and small children for a well-publicized if highly one-sided study). It may be cheesy torture for you, but it's not so awful for your two-year-old (unless they're already used to SpongeBob and Pokemon and other quick cartoons).

The sounds, or voices, are a mixture toddlers, children, and adults--which makes a lot of sense when you consider the sources of sound and information in a child's world. It may be difficult for you to understand ""baby-fied"" language, but this is what your child encounters when they interact with other children, and hearing the same word spoken differently will help your child recognize the speech pattern when they hear it from someone else. It's like teaching a child that Picture A and Picture B look different, but they are both cats--only this time it does it with sound.

How to Make it Better for Your Child/More Thought-Oriented:

The best thing you can do is to watch parts of the DVDs with your child, maybe 5 minutes at a time, and talk to your child about what is going on in the video. ""Oh my! What do you think Black is going to pull out of the treasure chest? Are we looking? Wow! It's a magic wand! I wonder what Black can do with that magic wand? What do you think? Oh! Is this a magic show? Look! There's a black ball under the cup!""

The ""talking"" is not about your child actually answering you, it's about teaching your child to question or ""think critically"" about what s/he is seeing on the screen. It's connecting questions and discovery with the rote learning (or, in other words, complementing it) and building in comprehension skills. (These are the same techniques you should use when teaching your child to play; instead of telling him/her what a toy does, ask questions about what it might do and let the child discover certain aspects for him/herself after brief modeling.) Talking also helps your child to acquire more words, more contexts, and more meanings while being exposed to repetitive information--something that will help increase your child's vocabulary (speaking, reading, and writing) once those skills are developed. The more you talk to your child about the world in regular, conversational tones, the more words your child will acquire as they age. (This is an actual study.) If you want these DVDs to help bridge the gap between memorization and real learning, teach your child to be curious.

Personal Anecdote:

When my oldest son was one, my brother's girlfriend bought him the ""Meet the Numbers"" DVD for Christmas. It was something we'd pop in occasionally, and sometimes he'd sit and watch, and sometimes it was just background noise. Although it drove me and my husband up a wall (We still occasionally say, ""One. Oooone. One!"" at random moments), my son really enjoyed it. A few months later, when my son showed up at daycare, we were shocked to learn that he was well ahead in identifying numbers. (We worked mostly on the alphabet at home; as an English teacher and reading specialist, I was biased in my focus.) I was never entirely sure, but I had an inkling the ""Numbers"" DVD had something to do with it.

After reading the reviews and talking with several early childhood teachers, a cognitive psychologist, and school psychologist, I bought the whole series while pregnant with my second son. He's sixteen months now, and just started showing an interest in the ""Meet the Colors"" DVD. At first he'd barely sit through ""Yellow,"" and now he sometimes watches all the way through the first ""Black"" introduction. It's mostly on as background noise, because we're playing and eating snack and cleaning up or doing other things at the time, but he will stop and watch for a few minutes every now and then (When he stops I usually try to talk to him about it or ask some questions, but I don't always).

Again, I didn't think anything of him watching the DVD until my husband noticed that we could ask our son to bring us things by color and he'd bring the correct items! ""Can I have the blue block?"" when there were red, green, and blue blocks sitting there; ""Where's the red sock?"" when there are blue and white and red socks in the pile, etc. He can also point to colors although he doesn't say them yet. ""Which circle is yellow?"", etc. I'm no SuperMom, and I don't really focus on teaching the colors or anything, but somehow he picked these ideas up--and I do think the repetitive nature of the DVD had something to do with it.

I'd recommend these to anyone with very small children who are looking for some background noise and maybe some decent preschool prep. You'll be amazed at what your little sponge can absorb from watching a few DVDs, but it'll never be as much as they can learn from you.",1320278400,39,7909,4.75492341356674

After 4 weeks of daily exposure to meet the letters he was pointing out (accurately) the letters in story books and on paper at school.  He learned to recognize the numbers very quickly as they are only 1 - 10. It has proven more challenging to teach him counting.  If I could do it over I would've taught him counting before number recognition.  I'm not a psycho mom who's pushing him into Ivy League schools at 18, 19, 20 months, but giving him the tools he will need.

3647418,5,B001ICUVPS,"When learning about the paid commercial, ""Baby Can Read,"" I was curious as to how it worked since I didn't want to pay the $200 plus dollars.  I came across Preschool Prep and I thought that was more of a reasonable price to pay and was pleased with the video quality.  Our son was 4 yrs old when we introduced him to the DVDs, and over the summer he watched them over and over again - this was awesome since he was about to start Pre-K.  Thanks to Meet the Sight Words, he now knows 46 of the 100 high frequency words from 1st grade!  He is now 5 and in Kinder, and can pretty much read 1st grade through 2nd grade books.  We were EXTREMELY pleased with the set.  My only disappointment was with the ABCs - it would say the letters, but never what sound they made, for this we used Leap Frog's Letter Factory, which our son also loved to watch and sing along.  Other than that, we're still pleased with the product.  Just this weekend we learned that they had two additional DVDs, blending and digraphs (th, ch, sh, wh, etc.), which we added to our collection.  Its great to make vocabulary cards to have your child review, or purchase the cards already made too (just a suggestion).
My wife is a teacher and has used the DVDs to help out students with dyslexia, resource students that do not read at grade level, and students that are building on their English vocabulary.  All in all, this has been a GREAT INVESTMENT in our children's learning.",1315180800,2,1448,4.349442379182156

I didn't really expect much from them now because he's so young but I was pleasantly pleased that he has been extremely interested in the videos and after 1 month of owning them has already started to try and mimic the sounds that the narrators make.  Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised.

I work at home and run a family daycare from it and only cater to ages 0-5.  A few parents learned that I had purchased the videos and encouraged me to include them in our pre-school curriculum.  They all loved the videos from the first day that I began showing them and 2 families have already purchased them for their use at home.  These two children are 1 year olds and after 2 weeks they can already recognize their shapes and colors.

He watched as much as allowed. He has memorized the sight words just from watching a few times.  Now he enjoys reading books and he gets excited whenever he recognizes the words he learned from these videos on street signs or wherever we are. It's a boxed 7-DVD set each contained in a slim case so it's easy to store or you can take as few or all of it on the go.  It's not a step by step system .. you can start anywhere.  That's the part I like.  It's educational without a sweat.  I agree with my son .. it's fun! He's so happy and i'm so proud from all the compliments.,1302048000,,732,4.156028368794326

I was so excited!  You see all the hype but never know if its true or not.

Meet the shapes is ok - definetely not as good as meet the colors. It's shorter and it seems like for an older child (mine was 8months when she started watching these). there is not as many examples of the shapes and it took my daugher a few months to start recognizing the shapes. with the colors she just stars laughing immediately.
Meet the numbers is even worse - wayyyyyy too short. Definetely not worth the money. Some numbers like 9 and 10 are very boring and my child just keeps squirming during their part in the video. The smaller numbers she is ok with and pays attention.
Meet the letters - haven't seen it yet.

So my 20 month old daughter is saying many single words but only a few two-word combinations. She has been watching the ""meet the letters"" etc. DVDs in the car since just after birth because I bought them for her older brother at about 2 years old (he still watches them but at 4 he prefers the Baby Einstein series DVDs unless it is his turn to choose - then it's Cars, Shrek etc.) Knowing what I know now, I should have started him a lot earlier...

So the other day she is playing with blocks that have letters on them and saying something each time she stacks one. When I listened closely I could barely make out her pronouncing each letter on the block (she is still so young her pronunciation skills are not too good.) I quizzed her and realized she really does know the letters, possibly all of them! We never tried to teach her except to read the book to her at bedtime and play the DVD of the same title - we never had to push her to try and remember or identify her letters!  Yesterday for giggles I started drawing the shapes on a chalkboard to see if she could identify her shapes.  YEP - she knows them!  Today she was counting as well (one to ten).  These are just very effective learning tools for the 1-3 age group.

My son who is 18 months learned the colors within 3 weeks of playing the video once per day. He is now learning the numbers but he does not pay much attention to the shapes video. I also don't like the fact that the video shows an octagon when hexagon is more important in my opinion. It does not show a cross or a heart either just the basic shapes. Also the square sometimes looks like a rectangle and it does not have anything to do with my TV because half of the time it looks fine.

I do recommend this set. I think the ideas is ingenious!",1290556800,,658,3.9473684210526314

She can do this with almost all the shapes now, and many of the letters.  This series is designed for the very young child, and in the beginning of the DVD they even state that their target audience is the very young toddler.  I have noticed that some of the negative reviews for this series have come from folks who tried these DVD's out on older kids, who probably would get bored.  I'm not saying that our little Maddy is ready to read Tolstoy now, but I am impressed with her ability to recognize the letters and shapes at such a young age.

This set is absolutely wonderful!  At first I thought it was very odd and wasn't sure I liked it, but my 1 1/2 year old (at the time), truly loved it!  After only watching Meet The Colors, and Meet The Shapes a few times, he learned all of them!  He is now 2, and also knows all of his numbers (0 - 10) and all of his letters, which is awesome....but today he totally shocked me!  I also have a one year old, whom I had put down for a nap, so I popped in one of the more ""advanced"" DVDs, Meet The Sight Words 2.  My 2 year old has only watched it about three times, and much to my delight was saying the words as soon as he saw them, prior to the prompt!  I was awestruck!  It was amazing to hear his confident little voice, ""I see there, I see him,"" This set is genius!  The characters are adorable and the music is cute.  The graphics are very simple and it will probably drive Mommy and Daddy nuts to hear ""yellow"", ""square"", ""zero"", etc. for the 100th time, but the DVDs are very effective.  I love this set! The only complaint I have is that phonics are not covered at all.  My son knows the letters, but this set does not teach the sounds associated with each letter.  I have also tried the Leap Frog Learning Set in order to teach my kiddos phonics, but they loose interest within the first five minutes.  The Preschool Prep set has been way more effective.

3647539,5,B001ICUVPS,"Well I was hesitant to buy these because of some of the reviews written by folks in the education field saying that this was not an educationally sound way to learn.  I am SOOOO glad I ordered it though, and have since ordered as gifts for friends who are pregnant a second time and will have two kids under two (hey, they need something to do while you're nursing right?). I got these when my son was 17 months old.  He already knew shapes so he never watched that one.  He has known upper and lower case letters since he was 20 months old. I used to put this on while I made dinner and repeat the letters and their phonetic sound shouting from the kitchen.  He has known his phonics since 21 months. He is now 26 months old and knows his phonics, upper and lower case letters, numbers 1-10, shapes, colors (colors were the last to come, around 25 months), and many of the sight words. He has even made some of the sight words by putting letters together from his Leapfrog Fridge Word Builder. He is attempting to sound words out and can now sing the alphabet start to finish. He has really taken a shine to letters so I am hoping this will transition well into reading.  Too bad there are no videos by this company teaching to read...but I think there is where the ""educationally sound""  part comes in.  These teach through repetition.  One can't simply memorize every word in the dictionary (I suppose only the sight words).  But for basics that everyone needs to memorize such as what the letter A looks like, I don't see why repetition is so bad. If you were to learn another language, wouldn't you learn their alphabet through memorization/repetition?  You wouldn't learn to read that way, but in order to read you'd first need the building blocks to sound out the words.  I believe that is what these videos give - the basic building blocks for future learning.  My son actually never liked Sesame Street (which I believe another reviewer referred to as educationally sound) until he had memorized his letters.  It was at that point that Murray playing the ""Whats on me that starts with (letter)"" game became really interesting.
I think these videos are great, and have taught my son so much.  I only hope I can keep him on the fast track without the aid of more awesome videos. The best I can seem to find to teach him to read are some Hooked on Phonic products and the Leapfrog Singalong DVD set.",1281484800,3,2405,4.461187214611872

After getting tired of her prior videos, i re-introduced preschool prep.  Over time she paid more and more attention.  First she would dance to some of the music, then stand still watching the rest. Then it happened, she started saying the words and repeating the colors when they would appear on screen.  Amazing.

If you have small children (my son started watching these at 2), start with the Meet the Letters and Meet the Numbers movies.  Depending on how often you watch them, your child can master letters and numbers at an early age.  Then watch Meet the Shapes and Meet the Colors.  Meet the Sight Words 1-3 are great for ages 3 and up.  If your child likes the PBS show Word World, he or she will like the sight words movies.

3647580,1,B001ICUVPS,"Let me first start out by saying that I am a teacher - I really value any educational toys or learning activities.  I wanted to get a few educational DVD's for our car for my son to watch on longer trips. I was excited after reading about the awards this series received in a parent magazine.  I popped in the first DVD and waited for my son to be ""ooh-ed and ahh-ed"" - after about 5 minutes, he no longer wanted to watch it.  I brought the DVD's in the house and sat down to see what they were all about.  I was shocked at how horrible they are, the graphics are very low budget, the character talks in a very high and hard to understand voice, and ther is no story/plot...the ""characters"" just move across the screen and repeat their letter over and over.  No wonder he did not want to watch it.  I thought maybe the letter one is just too basic, so I popped open the sight words DVD - same horrible experience, only the character repeats the word over and over.  It is not educationally sound AT ALL, I think they must have made up the award they received. :)  I thought maybe I was missing something so I took the DVD set over to a friend of mine who is also an elementary reading specialist, she agreed that they were horrible and was shocked they cost $50+ dollars for the set.  She also said that they do not even follow the protocal of how letters are introduced and the foundations of phonemic awareness to teach phonics or sound.  She said you are much better off with the Sesame Street or the Leapfrog learning DVD's.  Amazon was great for letting me return this horrible series....we orded the entire Leapfrog learning DVD set when my son was almost 3 and he still loves this DVD's (and asks for them) at 4.5 years.

3647586,5,B001ICUVPS,"I bought this as well as the leap frog tad series and the brainy baby series for my 2.5 year old. This is the one that actually taught him the letters, numbers, words, colors, shapes and more (I mean I was also working with him but I think these dvds way reinforcing the subjects are the reason they stuck). The leap frog one worked great for after he had learned the info because of the story line prior to that he wasn't interested in them because he didn't know the letters yet. The brainy baby was nice reinforcement when I got tired of listening to the preschool prep series repeating (over and over and over, some days you just can't put that in) but he wasn't as interested in the brainy baby ones. As far as him actually sitting down and watching, or just paying attention while playing something else this is the series that actually worked. Within weeks he now knows all his letters, all his numbers (and counts to ten and counts objects). All his shapes, all his colors and most of the sight words by sight when reading the books with me he'll point them out in on the pages and say them. This is great and well worth the cost.

*note, this dvd was not his first introduction to these subjects- I have worked with my child a lot and did not rely on the dvds to teach him from the ground up. I can not say if the claims the dvds themselves make are true but I do recommend this set based on our experience.

------------------------------

*UPDATE* My toddler in the review above is now 6 years old (and reading chapter books) and I have another almost 3 year old who is using the same dvds. They are working just as well this time around. He is not quite as quick as his brother on learning these things (his strengths lie in music rather then learning we think. Music fascinates him and he can pick up tunes like no ones business). Still, he is much farther then many of his peers, regardless. If you lay letters out in front of him or show him letters somewhere (book title, bracelet with initials, whatever) and ask him to show you the A or T or R or ect he can point to the right letter without hesitating. He can also draw the basic shape of most the letters if you ask him to and name any letter you point out to him. He knows all of his colors by sight whether you are asking him to name the color you show him or to pick the color out of a pile. He also knows a few of the sight words and how to count up to 5 and down from 5 and can recognize some of the numbers 1-10.

After using these dvds for two children I don't hesitate to say they do work as great reinforcements if you are teaching little ones.

-----------------
*My 5 year old is now 6 and can read just about anything you put in front of him. I want to caution that his results are probably abnormal. Our oldest is very very quick to pick up on just about anything learning wise you try to teach him, taking hours/days/weeks to tackle subjects that take most much longer (he taught himself subtraction and addition and is currently working on multiplication- now with IXLs help). His brother has proven to be much harder to teach- but I think is probably more on par with what most kids are like learning these things. These dvds still make a world of difference in how I feel the reinforcement and retention of the learning goes. I feel, whether you have a 'gifted' child when it comes to these subjects or not that these dvds are a huge help. Just be forwarned... they are annoying for adults, lol.",1262131200,,3482,4.2617246596066565

3647592,5,B001ICUVPS,"I started using this series with my little boy when he was 16 months old. I showed him ""Meet the Colors"" once a day, and I let him color every day after supper. He quickly picked up the words ""black"", ""blue"", and ""purple"" (he called them back, boo, and purpurp), and he LOVED the video.

I had been reading to him every day since I was 3 months pregnant with him. When he was 22 months old, I started showing him ""Meet the Sight Words 1"", not because I wanted to force him to learn to read, but because he was taking books away from me and pretending to read. He quickly taught himself the words on the DVD - after he watched it every day for a week, he would try to guess the word before the voice said the word. If he got it wrong, he'd cry, and he'd try again with the next word. His speech also got a lot clearer and easier to understand 2 weeks after he started using the DVDs, I don't know if there's a connection.

We just started using ""Meet the Letters"". I play the ABC song 3 times for him and I sing along. Then we watch the letters A - D. When we're driving somewhere, we practice saying the letters A-D and he can make it through C by himself.

I like the fact that the vocabulary is based on the Houghton-Mifflin reading series, because the school he will attend uses this series. I have no complaints about this DVD series at all.

I watch 4 Grandchildren, one year old, two 3 yr. olds and one 5 year old.  I love many of the things that others complain about.  When my own children were young, they preferred to watch Mr. Rodgers, over watching Sesame Street.  They liked the calming show better than the wild one.  While I have all of the Leap Frogs and highly recommend them, too, we have really liked the educational, fun, and calm way that these shows are presented.  They start out by completely introducing what they are teaching, in a fun way. Then they start repeating the concept in similar fashions, but moving faster.  There is a lot of repetition, but it is done in a fun way.  One of my granddaughters is blind and gets over stimulated easily.  She stands next to the TV, to try to see the simple shapes and loves the music.  The pictures are kept simple, really featuring the thing being presented. The music is often soft and often is a nursery song, with music only, in the background, while the concept being taught is being presented.  Personally, I find it much more calming than most educational videos, yet every grandchild adores them.  Perhaps your own attitude towards them would make a big difference, too.

When the purple segment came on, my granddaughter grabbed her ""purple bunny"" and sat down and watched with great interest which shows me she is understanding the concept of colors.",1245283200,3,985,4.358695652173913
3647651,5,B001ICUVPS,"I used the sight words dvds with my 4 year old, and he learned all 3 dvds in about 2 weeks.  I am now using the numbers, colors, and letters series with my 20 month old, who loves it.

I have given these as gifts.  One friend bought the whole series after receiving the ""letters"" as a gift.  Her ""almost 2 year old"" has mastered every dvd.  The docs didn't even believe the mom at the 18 month appt when she told all the child knew.

The songs can get a little old for me, especially in the car, but since I already know my abc's, etc..., I can get over it.  The kids love it.  I love the results.",1245196800,2,597,3.9166666666666665
3647652,4,B001ICUVPS,"When I have the DVD's on, I personally find them boring and dull but for some reason my son is very interested in them so I guess they are doing their job. I can't get him away from the TV when they are on! I haven't heard him say any if the words yet but we just got it and started using it regularly. I would recommend.",1244937600,,321,3.8059701492537314
3647653,5,B001ICUVPS,"While my 2 year-old is good at somethings, communication has been somewhat slow developing.  When I watch ""Preschool"", I don't see how it maintains his attention, but somehow, he's able to sit through a whole DVD.  Furthermore, within 2 weeks of watching the ""numbers"" video, he can actually count 1-10.  He recognizes all of the alphabet letters and I was floored when he actually recognized ""sight words"" on signs and was able to ""read"" or repeat them.",1244246400,,454,4.87012987012987
3647654,3,B001ICUVPS,"I purchased the entire 7 Preschool Prep videos.  I was very pleased with the ""Meet the sight word"" series.  I purchased them as an experiment but after watching them 10-12 times (at about 20 min. a time since we didn't watch the repeats) my 5 year old learned almost all of the sight words and my 4 year old learned about 1/2 of the the sight words.  It is WELL worth your money, as I have spent an entire school year trying to teach these words.  Once the kids know them, it makes reading so much easier because they don't have to sound out every word.  I prefer ""Meet the sight words"" over Your Baby Can Read just because the kids will see the sight words in print in almost any book they pick up.
As for ""Meet the Letters"" it is a huge disappointment.  My kids were so bored with it that they wouldn't even sit through 1/3 of it.  Also, IT DOES NOT INCLUDE LETTER SOUNDS, which is fundamental for reading success.  I purchased ""LeapFrog Letter Factory DVD."" which is much better for teaching letters and sounds.  It is 35 min. long and is much more engaging.  I will be using the letter factory DVD and the meet the sight words DVD.  I suggest buying the Meet the Sight words and not the ""Meet the Letters, Numbers, Colors, or Shapes.",1243641600,152,1237,4.288793103448276
3647655,1,B001ICUVPS,"This stuff is not only annoying, it is absolutely terrible. During the whole time you'd hear:

""Yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, ..."" until you'd either turn off the TV or become a brain dead. (Yellow gets substituted with other colors, or shapes, or numbers, or whatever, based on the DVD theme.)

The reason I bought this stuff - it was suggested by Amazon after I bought Leapfrog's ""Letter Factory"", ""Math"" and 3 other DVDs. They are absolutely not comparable. I had a great experience with Leapfrog and was very-very happy with their DVDs. Don't waste your money and don't torture yourself and your kids - buy Leapfrog's DVDs instead - kids will learn faster and in much smarter way.",1242864000,108,902,5.213793103448276

3647667,5,B001ICUVPS,"I bought the 7 DVD Pack for my 3yr. old son. He loves them. Each day he requests a DVD by title. It's been about a month and he now knows all his shapes, colors, and letters. He learned to recognize 15 letters in the first week. Everywhere we go now, he says ""Mommy look v! Mommy look a!""  I love how each letter is made into a character and repeated. Kids needs skills to be repeated at least 9 times to master them and Preschool Prep does that. He is currently into numbers and sight words and doesn't get bored from any one of them. It's a great investment.",1242259200,,560,4.090909090909091

3647669,3,B001ICUVPS,"I bought this item and also the Leapfrog series.  This series is rather boring for my 2 1/2 year-old.  He hates to watch any of them.  It would probably be better suited for a younger child, maybe 1+.  There really isn't a story line, it simply says the letter name/sound OVER and OVER and OVER again while showing the letters.

The plus to this series is that it includes capital and lower-case letters, as well as several different types of fonts for each letter.",1241481600,18,465,4.488095238095238
3647670,4,B001ICUVPS,These are good movies.  My 22 month old loves the color and shapes ones.  The letters one is a little boring and long for right now so we mostly just use that one to sing the ABC's on.,1241308800,,184,3.8157894736842106
3647671,5,B001ICUVPS,"I am so happy to have a product like this.  I bought it for my son when he was 22 months old.  Late during my second pregnancy I had to resort to TV to help entertain him.  I wanted to find something that was worthwhile watching, so I searched the web and found these.  Although I find them a little slow and boring myself, they are perfect for him.  He loves them!  The alphabet DVD shows both upper and lower case letters (something you don't get with the Leap Frog DVD, but is very important), and in the case of ""a"" and ""g"", it gives a couple of versions of the lower case letter that you see written sometimes.  All of the videos are done in a fashion that helps them learn, with different sections:  first simple introduction, then a mini short story or song, and then a review.  In just a few days my son was recognizing letters and numbers, his color knowledge improved significantly, and he had his shapes down pat.  I'm holding off on the site word videos for now due to his age.  A couple of things I think would improve the DVD would be a more fluid story (like you see with the Leap Frog Alphabet Factory, and on the shapes DVD, they introduce the octagon, but not the pentagon, hexagon, etc.  It would be more complete with more shapes.  I still give it a five though because it allows them to learn something rather than just introduce them to gross or violent junk you'd find on most cartoons or TV in general.  There's no question his knowledge base has improved since watching these videos.",1240876800,,1508,4.339285714285714
3647672,1,B001ICUVPS,"We purchased this DVD with great anticipation due to earlier positive reviews.  However after our first viewing, it was very clear that our 2 year old son was not the least bit interested in watching or learning.  He either walks away from the television or falls asleep.  In fact, it was actually painful to sit through the video with him.  The constant repetition was appropriate but the animation and music were quite dreary.  If you have insomnia I would highly recommend it.  As a learning tool, don't bother.  I find the leapfrog videos much more stimulating and appealing.",1240444800,5,579,4.846938775510204

They are very repetitive but the get the message across.  My 3 1/2 year old knows her letters, numbers, shapes and colors already but she still like to watch the videos because she loves when her younger sister repeats the words (as she does not talk a lot...it does seem like the videos are helping her to say more words).  I will start working with my 3 1/2 year old with the words but I would like to do that in the house so we can pause and take our time and get her to start learning some of the site words.  I do feel like this is a good set of educational DVDs.",1239840000,,697,3.8461538461538463

But he's absolutely crazy for it.  He barely started talking last week (""mama"" ""daddy"" and ""dog"" are the most recognizable).  But he's in love with the alphabet so I decided to try out this DVD.

After roughly a week and a half: He can recognize almost all the letters and he shouts most of them out when they come on screen.

The DVD is really annoying for adults (seriously), but my son and all of his friends think it's fabulous.",1239667200,,483,4.322222222222222

I would come home from work and put these DVD's on. Yes it's repetitive, but it catches their attention when their 2 years old. I would watch the videos with them and reinforce the lessons. When my kids turned three years old  they knew all of their shapes, letters, numbers and phonics. They also new all of  their sight words and then some because I have always challenged them. AT THREE YEARS OLD  MY KIDS WERE READING  KINDERGARTEN READERS. People didn't believe me so I would video my kids just to show people that they were in fact reading. Preschool prep really got their attention , they learned from the videos , and I reinforced everything they were learning. Don't expect to just turn on the videos and expect miracles, parents have to do their part as well. What can I say ....it works.
