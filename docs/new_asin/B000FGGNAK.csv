2564743,5,B000FGGNAK,"I was lucky enough at the Belmont show, and it was amazing.  25-minute epic Knight of the North, live?  Not to mention the choir on Having Caught a Glimpse.  The DVD does an excellent job of capturing the energy of the band live.  First time I put it on, I was intending to just watch one song because I was busy with other things, and, well, I ended up finishing the whole DVD because I couldn't bear to turn it off. It's definitely the greatest DVD from this band, and my favorite of concert DVDs I've seen so far.  If you couldn't make the performance, I highly recommend adding this DVD to your collection.",1154995200,2,610,4.315789473684211
2564744,5,B000FGGNAK,"I was lucky enough to attend this show, but was not in the best of spots to get the best audio experience. This show will bring the goosebumps to your arms when you listen to the band with the choir.  My favorites were ""Farewell to Shadowlands"", ""Knight of the North"", and ""Run Lisette"". The mix was well done and no one overshadows anyone else.  The new guitarist David Wallimann injected an energy to the performance and complimented keyboard wizard Fred Schendel.  The DVD set also gives a more intimate look at the band and show how down to earth they are.  There is also some extra footage that shows behind the scenes and bonus performances.  For 250 minutes of footage, you won't find much better in a music DVD set for the price.

The music of this band is especially entertaining as for me was stimulating intellectually and emotionally.  When I received my copy, I watched it fives times before I decided I needed to pay my bills, get something to eat, and go to work.  If you are a fan of progressive music, this is a MUST HAVE.  You will not be disappointed.",1151712000,3,1070,4.474226804123711
2564745,5,B000FGGNAK,"As one that was at this legendary show (on the front row nevertheless) and has been awaiting it's release, I can confidently say it is everything I expected and so much more! For those not already acquainted with the symphonic proggers from Chattanooga, this will be an eye and ear opening experience that will leave you speechless. I challenge anyone to find more talent and pure musicianship on one stage in prog or any other genre.

A few other general comments before I comment on each song on Disc One. For those familiar with the Lex Live DVD, this one is light years ahead in video quality, production, and esp. audio quality (the 5.1 surround is incredibly clear and crisp). That's why this DVD is so outstanding, it does justice to the quality of the musicians and voices present on that stage in Nashville that November afternoon. Disc Two has some really nice features for the hard-core fans especially. It was nice to see the 2003 concert appearances-even though the video quality is fairly poor. The slideshow has very entertaining commentary by Fred Schendel (keyboards, vocals), Steve Babb (bass, vocals), and Bethany Warren (backing, lead vocals), and an enormous amount of brilliant still shots.

Now on to the show itself:

1) ""Long and Long Ago"" - After the stirring instrumental opening, the entire band proper hits the stage and newcomer guitarist David Walliman quickly makes an impression by mixing lightning fast runs, soaring lead lines, and subtly jazzy bits in this opening song from Disc Two of The Inconsoable Secret. Fred quickly earns the title of ""hardest worker on stage."" He's all over the multi-layered keys with his Nord lead synth sounding esp. marvelous on the 5.1 mix. Matt Mendians on drums does not need any warm-up on his bombastic style. He is truly getting better and better with each performance! Flo Paris has a nice but brief solo, which goes into the note perfect harmony at the end of the song. This song also features the Adonai String Trio and Eric Parker on the steel guitar. Like most, if not all, of the selections, this is much better than the studio version IMO due mostly to David's harder/crunchier guitar sound!

2) ""One King"" - this selection from Lex Live is not only better than the studio version, but much better than the LL DVD version also. The vocals are much clearer and prominent in the mix, and Carl Groves (guest vocalist from Salem Hill) really starts to come into his own and gets more confidence with the band. David has some really nice subtle but tasty riffs before going back and forth with Fred which would prove to be the first of many guitar/keys battles (that IMO rival that of Howe and Wakeman on ""South side of the Sky"" on the 2004 Yes tour). Someone please get Fred a towel!

3) ""Run Lisette""- for me this one is THE highlight of highlights. The quote from Bill Bruford about the song ""And You And I"" comes to mind-this song is everything that GH does right in one song-and the fans love it, and the critics will probably hate it. The intricate instrumental interludes are super tight, the harmonies are spot on, Susie Bogdanowicz's soaring soprano on the ending is breathtaking, there's just too much amazing things about this song to mention them all. A very overlooked, underrated song from a phenomenal CD (Shadowlands) that hopefully will now get more notice!

4) ""Farewll to Shadowlands"" - another great song from that album-first time played live-and is extremely tight. I did notice a few too many camera cuts and angles (IMHO) on this song and in a few other places. Eric's slide and Steve's bass are a little more prominent on this one. David and Fred have some more great trade-offs and the vocal harmonies are as tight as ever.

5) ""Through the Glass Darkly"" - I was highly anticipating this one due largely to Susie's lead vocal and it does NOT disappoint! The only thing it does do is make you wish her and the other GH beauties were down front more often! Beautiful work from the trio and Fred on piano also; just a stunning song! Carl's voice blends very nice with Susie's and the split camera shots are nice on this also.

6) ""Knight of the North"" - another highly anticipated number by all. This is the epic from disc One of TIS and again, was MUCH better live! Especially the long instrumental interludes. This song really gives the core members Fred, Steve, David and Matt time to shine with some added slide and acoustic guitar from Eric.

7) ""Then We Were Young"" - and as Steve says ""if there wasn't enough people on stage already"" here comes the combined choirs from Belmont University (150 strong) who barely all fit on the risers. The emotional and intense song from Lex Rex is also better (I know-broken record) than either the original or LL DVD versions-mostly due to the strength of the choir and David's soaring guitar work. Another stunner!

8) ""Having Caught a Glimpse"" - this one starts beautifully and never lets up. This is one of GH's strongest and prettiest melodies ever-and the choir clearly takes it over the top. ANOTHER highlight!

9) ""Heroes and Dragons"" - the sugar on top! The funny thing is I never cared for this song much on LL due mostly to the programmed drum sound, this version is not only better, it takes it to a completely different level. Carl and Susie's vocals are perfect - a perfect ending!

I know I've waxed on too long anyway. Don't just take my word or any other rabid GH fan's word-get it and see for yourself - YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPPOINTED! And then meet us all in Chattanooga in October for a repeat performance!

The above review was originally written the week of the DVD's release, and I can honestly say some months later I still enjoy this DVD just as much or more. True, I am biased-I was there, and I have met and know most of the band personally-but I still think objectively that GH is the most underrated and overlooked PROG band around-and this DVD is the perfect introduction to skeptics or anyone that enjoys well played thought provoking music-and let me say again-the sound quality on a good 5.1 system is INCREDIBLE!!!! It ranks up there with YES-Symphonic, YES-35th Anniversary show,Peter Gabriel's live DVD's, David Bowie's latest,etc. The sound is that well-mixed and that good! Give it a try, and then like I already said-meet us in Chattanooga in October to see, hear, and feel first hand! Peace,David.",1151712000,2,6375,4.686327077747989
2564746,5,B000FGGNAK,"Since I saw this concert live, I had great expectations for this DVD. I knew how fantastic the performance was, with songs from The Inconsolable Secret (""Knight of The North,"" ""Long and Long Ago,"" ""Having Caught A Glimpse"") and other Glass Hammer classics (including my favorites, ""Run Lisette"" and ""Heroes and Dragons""), and with the powerful finale including the combined choirs of Belmont University singing (in English and Elvish!). But this DVD managed to amaze me, despite my great expectations. The terrific camera and sound work captured everything I loved about the performance - and gave me great perspectives I couldn't get from my seat! - but the added materials also provided welcome insights into the rehearsals and backstage planning of the show, and the slideshow and commentary were highly entertaining and amusing. This DVD set gives an intimate look into the personality of Glass Hammer as well as clear proof why the band is considered to be the world's foremost name in symphonic progressive rock. Don't get a copy of this DVD set: get two, and give the second as a gift!",1150156800,8,1092,4.972677595628415
8122248,5,B000FGGNAK,Highly recommended. The French guitar player David Wallimann is one of the best on the planet.,1433462400,,94,4.9375
8122249,5,B000FGGNAK,Absolutely fantastic. David Wallimann is one of the best guitar players in the world.,1433462400,,85,5.142857142857143
8122250,5,B000FGGNAK,It's a great shame we don't hear more from Flo Paris. She's by far the most awesome vocalist Glass Hammer have ever had.,1417824000,,120,4.260869565217392
8122251,5,B000FGGNAK,"This was bought as a gift for my husband, who loves Glass Hammer.  Even though I'm not a huge music fan (I'm much more visual than aural) I even enjoyed it.  I think this will become one of his favorite DVDs.",1369440000,,208,4.048780487804878
8122252,4,B000FGGNAK,"Well you know that my opinion has been never affected by my symphonic music background and as such an interesting live - like this recent one - brought about a certain emotional feeling among all the fans of the band, including me, I 'm happy to review this product after burning it at my DVD player one more time. In fact We have been waiting for this important performance - as it is witnessed by their second most inspiring and best DVD (after ""Lex Live"") - for a couple of years and right now I can say it's really worth the price.
Of course - even though the mood is not equal for instance to that incomparable transmitted by another symphonic band like After Crying (think of a couple of recent famous lives, regarding this latter fantastic amd more versatile Hungarian band), I think that the approach of G.H. is well worth checking out at least. But coming back to their tunes, I like to mention the stunning instrumental opener of ""Long and Long Ago"", where David Walliman - their newcomer guitarist - shows his good skill, even when He plays a few "" more jazzy"" harmonic lines taken directly from Disc Two of ""The Inconsolable Secret"" studio album; then I appreciate ""One King"" very much, a selection from ""Lex Live"", which is better than the original version. Moreover here Carl Groves is well fitted into the new ensemble of G.H., like otherwise in the track ""Through the Glass Darkly"", where He supportes Susie - the lead vocalist - in a remarkable way!!

Instead the epic number ""Knight of the North"" is worth a special mention, because the long instrumental interludes work in a cool way, above all thanks to the team work, regarding of all the core members and the instrumental unplugged lines by Eric Parker as well...the quality of the mix is good in general, making this ""Live At Belmont"" a must- have for the fans of this intelligent US band.",1274227200,,1862,4.591591591591592
8122253,5,B000FGGNAK,"The video quality is poor in some parts, but the sound is great! It's not all echoes, as in another GH DVD (the title slips my mind at the moment). If you're a Glass Hammer fan, this is a good choice.",1242432000,,200,3.902439024390244
8122254,5,B000FGGNAK,"Chattanooga, Tennessee prog-rocker's Glass Hammer are back with another exciting release just in time for the holiday season:  Glass Hammer:  Live at the Tivoli.  A new Glass Hammer project is always a reason for great rejoicing and fanfare: studio maestros Steve Babb and Fred Schendel lead a magical team of vocalists and musicians that never fail to disappoint.  Around the time Glass Hammer released their stellar Culture of Ascent project they gathered for two amazing evenings of symphonic progressive rock enchantment. The spectacular results of those shows are gathered here on Glass Hammer:  Live at the Tivoli.  The band is in fine form on Tivoli and the result is a live performance that is unique, epic in scope and powerful in emotion and presentation.

On Tivoli Glass Hammer tears through a solid ten track set that hits many fan favorite highlights...starting with the new track ""Eiger Dreams"" and rolling through classics like ""A Cup of Trembling"" from Lex Rex, ""Lirazel,"" ""Heroes and Dragons,"" ""Knight of the North,"" and closing with a distinctive twist on the Yes classic ""South Side of the Sky.""

The music of Glass Hammer creates layer upon layer of gorgeous sounds and textures all woven into a dramatic tapestry.  The band perform superbly on Tivoli: Babb's bass is rich and booming; Schendel works memorable keyboard wizardry; Carl Groves provides an amiable presence and smooth vocals (check out the great version of Dan Fogelberg's ""Longer""); Matt Mendians crack drum work adds great rhythmic texture; guitar hero David Walliman offers astounding guitar pyrotechnics.  Adding to this already solid musical base is the Adonia String Trio (Rachel Hackenberger-Beckmann, Susan Whitacre, and Rebecca James) who joins Glass Hammer on most of the songs for a rich foundation of inspiring string parts; also returning are the tender, melodic vocals of Susie Bogdanowicz, Bethany Warren, and Flo Paris.  Finally, The Lee University Choral Union and The GPS Girls Choir lend their impressive vocals to the magic Glass Hammer sound captured on Tivoli.

The video is good quality and does a fine job of capturing the essence of the live performance but the star of the Tivoli DVD is the stunning 5.1 surround sound mix.  This *IS* the way to hear a band like Glass Hammer; the layers of sound I mentioned are best heard in the additional dimensions provided by the 5.1 mix.  This is Glass Hammer in 3-D (or is it 5-D?) sound; majestic, powerful, intoxicating.  Buy it and give it as a gift but most importantly pop Glass Hammer:  Live at the Tivoli in a surround sound system, sit back, and be blown away.",1228867200,,2620,5.016166281755196
8122255,4,B000FGGNAK,"I just discovered Glass Hammer recently. Over the past couple of months I've developed a severe addiction to their excellent double album, The Inconsolable Secret (it's playing in the background right now). When reading about the Live at Belmont DVD, I realized that it contained live performances of some of my favorite songs off The Inconsolable Secret and Shadowlands. I ordered it immediately, and I eagerly anticipated its arrival. It finally came yesterday, and it did not disappoint.

It is 4:3 and not widescreen, but I understand they probably didn't have a big budget, so that's forgiven. They did use a lot of cameras, which keeps things interesting even if a couple of the cameras didn't provide the best quality shots. The sound quality and mix are great.

Fred Schendel does an amazing job on keyboards, though I wish they had another camera to show close-ups of those amazing solos. Steve Babb's bass work is awesome, and his vocals are surprisingly good. On one track I think he might have turned into a troll for a little while. Susie Bogdanowicz, Bethany Warren, and Flo Paris are out of this world, just MAGICAL! I wish every song featured their vocals. Their performances are the ones I feel I'll be watching again and again. Then there is Carl Groves. Even though he is reading some of the lyrics, he really does an amazing job vocally... but those moves... ugh. The dude is cheesy, there's no way around it. Face it, the band is cheesy in many ways, but in good ways, endearing ways. Carl Groves on the other hand is distractingly corny, sometimes cringe inducing, but he sings so well that I'll try to forgive him. The rest of the band is great, especially David Wallimann with some blistering guitar solos, and that violin player has some wickedly intense expressions. For the last few songs a choir comes on stage, and it really adds to the epic climax of the show.

On the second DVD there is a 5.1 version of Lirazel, which I plan to crank up to obnoxious volume levels the next time I'm alone. There is also a slideshow with an amusing commentary track that gives you a glimpse of Fred and Steve's personalities.

I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because the video quality is lacking, and because of my minor annoyance with Carl Groves.

Overall I'm very happy with the DVD. It doesn't seem like Glass Hammer do much touring, so this is a great way to see them. For fans of this band or progressive rock in general, I highly recommend this DVD.",1197331200,,2467,4.636155606407323
8122256,2,B000FGGNAK,"Music almost O.K., the band was boring to watch do the music. They did not perform the songs they just played them with the house lights all on.
Band had big smiley faces. I have a suspision that they might be a  ""christian"" band, and we all know what thats like. Skip this band and just get you some Moody Blues, or some Yes and you'll be alot better off.",1182902400,,356,4.085714285714285
8122257,5,B000FGGNAK,Excellent performance ! and the music is almost perfect. I really like this because I'm a huge fan of progressive music and Glass Hammer. For me it's hard to see them in concert because I live in MX and not many people know them and this was a great experience to see them performing live. I recommend this to the fans of prog music !!,1178496000,,335,4.1692307692307695
