6155142,5,B00HDU41MS,"Maria the Korean Bride- through this DVD compilation of her 50 marriages across the USA I was able to see parts of our country that I normally won't be able to see and or feel welcome in. She has brought us closer to our country and the people in various states by talking about 1 common theme: Marriage. As an Asian myself I can relate to the pressure that is felt and the pedestal that we are put on since the day of our birth to live up to the expectations of not our family but our Tradition. Being a newlywed this DVD has illustrated that marriage is not a name on a piece of paper, but the word and value of commitment for each other through out a life time till age; no matter the race, religion,tradition and common beliefs of what a partner should be. This DVD would make you laugh, cry and see that equality does not exist even in America but no boundaries would keep any two apart once they are set to be committed.",1390262400,4,926,4.17877094972067

Expressed via a documentary format, artist Maria Yoon explores what marriage means to her as a first generation Korean American, while dealing with family pressure to wed and settle down as traditional Korean woman should: or should they? Traveling across the United States Maria assumes the persona Maria the Korean Bride and sets off on a quest to marry a groom in every state. Full of unwavering determination, she discovers via the people she meets, and those/them/it that she marries, what marriage is all about. It will keep you laughing, while your mind explores the meaning of, the purpose of, and the future of marriage.",1389657600,5,761,4.953125
6155165,5,B00HDU41MS,"Well what can I say that hasn't been said about Maria the Korean Bride Aside from the fact that I thought this movie was an interesting commentary on the value of marriage within different culture realms, I found it to be so much more than I expected it to be. It came to me highly recommended, so I knew of its context. What I didn't know was how much it would get to me emotionally. It has its funny moments, its sad and frustrating moments, and a surprise or two as well. What I truly was not expecting was how much my HUSBAND enjoyed it! After refusing to watch it with me the first time, he sat down with me at my second viewing (yes, it's well with a second time around) and just loved it. He had opinions, questions and everything that I believe this filmmaker was after, as did I.",1395792000,2,788,4.190789473684211
6155166,5,B00HDU41MS,"This movie takes a contemporary look at the institution of marriage in America and how it is constantly evolving.  Maria, the Korean Bride, takes us on an exciting journey through all the fifty states of America to get an understanding of what marriage means to people from all different backgrounds and cultures.  It is a fun, entertaining ride as we travel along with Maria on her quest to get married in all 50 states.  We see how she boldly questions her own cultures expectations of how and who she is to marry, and witness her own self-discovery of what marriage means to her.  This movie is very inspiring and a must see for anyone who is considering getting married or is wondering what it takes to maintain a successful relationship.  It is a great date film.  I highly recommend it.

Whether married, single or in between stages, one can easily relate to the experience being shared in the film.

6155171,5,B00HDU41MS,"I have to admit that when I first heard about this project, I thought it was a bit crazy. I mean the idea of 50 weddings across 50 states is shocking to any sensibility - especially to someone that grew up fairly conservative as I did. But the larger themes of what marriage and love mean are so universal and so compelling that by the end of this film, I have to admit I was moved. Maria's a compelling artist and this is one piece that will challenge your views on love and life - and in the end, isn't that what art is?",1391904000,3,522,4.028846153846154

6155174,5,B00HDU41MS,"I LOVED this film. Without being heavy-handed, Maria challenges us to think about marriage and its constructed meanings. The film is also simply beautiful. Maria traveled to and was married in each of the 50 states and the photography captures what is special the different locale.  In each ceremony, Maria's partner is always of symbolic importance and though you can't help but smile as you watch, you realize soon enough that what the film is really asking is that we think about the way love and its expressions are conditioned by cultural expectations and stereotypes. Great depth is given to the film by Maria's inclusion of interviews with married couples--gay and straight--who reflect on what love and marriage has meant to them. Maria's interviews with children also remind us of the ways in which marriage and our expectations of it are taught. This film is so heartwarming and intriguing I have to give it my highest recommendation.",1391126400,3,944,5.012738853503185

The beauty of this project is that peoples of all backgrounds and colors and upbringings were challenged with the notion of marriage, and it allows a space for all of us to ask questions about what is important to us. The fact that this film elicits a reaction from us as human beings shows how beautifully relevant it is to our society. Personally, I can identify with the constant battle of my upbringing's strict definitions of marriage, and how, even now, I am still confronting those notions to ultimately find what is important to me in life. Maria, thank you for being courageous enough to inspire us to take that chance to live life freely by challenging and embracing what makes us who we are.",1404777600,2,828,4.756944444444445
