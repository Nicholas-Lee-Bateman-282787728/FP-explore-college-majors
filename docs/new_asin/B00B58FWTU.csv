5556954,4,B00B58FWTU,"Of late Scandinavia has been receiving many accolades for their dark crime dramas, both in film and television.  But the same region has also been producing small, often understated and better-than-average horror films as well: Let the Right One In, Sauna, Dead Snow, and now Thale.  Even lesser films, like Rare Export or Troll, are often are more original and interesting than the typical horror-fest offerings found in the US, which far too often simply represent rehashes of previous movies striving to outdo their predecessors in blood and flesh.  Granted, these Nordic tales often have little to do with the formula slasher or torture-porn produced with such repetitive frequency in the US, or the more-twisted-is-better fare that has of late come out of Japan, Korea and France.  Instead, the better horror films from Scandinavia seem more concerned about atmosphere and dread occurring within the most mundane of settings and to the most ordinary of people, than the typical slash and flash, let alone unrelenting action used as distraction. Accompanied by droll humor and less reliance on shock and gore, their thrills are less overt but to my taste just as effective for not being heavy-handed, while placing greater emphasis on stories more original, both in terms of narrative and presentation, than their commoner, flashier counterparts.  Not that these latter films can't be effective as well, but not when the viewer is being bludgeoned over and over again by the same devices and visual/auditory deceptions.  So, to my mind, Scandinavia is not only producing better crime dramas these days than the US, but better if fewer horror films as well.",1363651200,,1660,5.152416356877324
5556955,2,B00B58FWTU,"I was able to watch this movie today, This movie was like a SyFy production,it is short in duration and lacks a lot of detail. The movie is subtitled in English, does not bother me but may be a show stopper for others.

I found it interesting but not really worth a 4 dollar rental. I would wait to see this on Prime when it comes available.",1363305600,7,341,4.08955223880597
5557036,4,B00B58FWTU,"To start, look up the word ""hulder"" on Wikipedia to get a sense of what the main character ""Thale"" is. This movie reminded me kind of a serious version of Troll Hunter in that it was foreign, had a serious plot, and involved mythological creatures. However, it's not a funny movie or a ""mockumentary"" like Troll Hunter was. In involves 2 crime scene cleaners who are sent to clean up a deceased old man and what they find at the house takes up the rest of the movie.

I would classify Thale as being a Mystery/Drama with a Fantasy twist. It is intense at parts, some violence (I wouldn't exactly call this a horror movie but there are a couple horror-type scenes), and some tasteful nudity but I don't think one curse word is said.

The best part of the movie, in my opinion, is the score or background music throughout. It really sets the tone for the entire movie and is very well done, considering this is an Indie movie.

The plot is hard to follow sometimes, I don't know if this is a result of bad writing or ""lost in translation"" text. Also, the movie tries to leave the viewer with a heart-felt message at the end that just falls short. All in all, worth a watch.",1457222400,,1171,4.337899543378995
5557037,4,B00B58FWTU,"Interesting - not really horror, but not whimsical either. Running time is quite short.",1453248000,,87,5.285714285714286
5557038,5,B00B58FWTU,"This is not a horror film although through most of it you think that's what is going on. I do suppose there is some horror, chiefly that of humanity's need to do painful research on those they think they can gain something from. And that's really at the heart of this modern day fairy tale. Two men who own a crime scene cleanup business get called to a small cabin in the woods where they've been asked to clean up after an old man died there. And then things get really weird as the pair discover things like a hidden room, medical textbooks and drawings depicting strange hand and limb formations, tins of canned goods, and (drum roll please) an ancient tape recorder that contains the freakiest ""found footage"" type dialogue that's very reminiscent of Session 9.

And all of that is before they discover the beautiful young woman that's been hidden away in this creepy little cabin and why she's there. I won't give away any spoilers except to say this seems like a slow film, you keep waiting for the other shoe to drop, and then when it does you really won't quite believe what it all turns out to be. The film is in Norwegian, so you better be cool with subtitles. For me this gave it an added otherworldly flair and I loved hearing the language and learning about the legends of woodland creatures that aren't exactly human. But have been living side by side with humanity for some time, much to their own detriment as it turns out.

Of course they have to sell people on the film with brief flashes of a naked attractive woman, but weirdly enough that all makes sense when you learn what's really going on. The final scenes of the movie also bring home an overall message: that sometimes it's not the perceived monsters who are the monsters at all, but us.

And with that I'm going to end my review. I won't give anything away, you'll have to see it for yourself. And be haunted and smiling and yes, humming a weird little tune that stays stuck in your head for days afterwards. And if you want to know what the heck I'm talking about you're just going to have to watch the film for yourself.",1452297600,,2101,4.423772609819121
5557039,4,B00B58FWTU,"I thought this was a great movie, but not for reasons you might suspect, as most of us Americans might turn their nose up at such a film. This film is a simple modern spin on a mythical being, the Huldra. It will appeal to those that like fairytales for the value they carry as psychological creations illustrating the autonomous power of the psyche. Frankly, I think the deeper meanings, which aren't explained in this movie will go by most viewers who have grown accustomed to the hackneyed Hollywood style of storytelling, having everything spelled out for them. This movie is not everyone's cup of tea! However, I enjoy foreign films such as this because they tend to have a much different sensibility to storytelling, using symbolism and mythos to impart a deeper message.",1451692800,,777,4.8059701492537314

5557044,3,B00B58FWTU,"First off, let me say this movie is completely mismarketed. Its marketed as a horror film when in reality its more a dark fantasy film. That said, its not a bad film at all. Not many sets or locations, most of it takes place in a house & the surrounding forest area. The trailers to this are sort of misleading, giving it a more horror feel which it doesn't really have. There is some blood but little of it, the few killings here are somewhat tame also. Cast does a decent job, especially the actress who plays Thale as she doesn't talk & everything is conveyed though mannerisms. Certain things I think could've been better explained or at least expanded on like the people who randomly show up towards the end of the film & the other creatures you very briefly see. Worth renting if nothing else just to check it out if you are in the mood for a good fantasy film that's a bit different from the norm.",1445126400,,904,4.323529411764706

Not the typical monster jumping out at every turn, no chase scenes, even the bits of hot woman nudity may not be enough for the die hard horror fan (if they can get past the subtitles).

To say more might spoil it, but I quite liked it, especially that this folk creature has its own reality, it's not a human viewpoint. There are some unexplained things, but for me that added to the unsettling atmosphere. Cast is very good, special effects are, well, effective but the movie doesn't use them as a crutch. Under 90 minutes yet it never feels rushed -- in fact some might find it slow at times -- and I liked Thale's lean 'n mean approach.",1417219200,2,561,4.6767676767676765

5557237,4,B00B58FWTU,"Independent cinema is now the first stop if you wish to see something different, or a bit more unpredictable than standard studio fare.

Thale is another fine entry from the Scandinavian film market, again showing that region to be a serious force in independent cinema.  Not as flashy, or polished as Hollywood, but what it lacks in CGI, or name actors (at least to western audiences)  it more than makes up for with solid performances and an intriguing story -- which is always the better half of the pie in my opinion.

If you like urban fantasy, this film more than satisfies, and it is good to see more stories that draw from folklore other than the standard European well.

The ending dealing with the situation of one of the protagonists I saw coming early on, but I can overlook that, since it was more of a side story than involving the main plot.  I look forward to what director  Aleksander L. Nordaas presents us with next.

Although I consider budget to have no purpose in the evaluation of a films merits, when I discovered that Thale was filmed on a budget of $10,000 I was truly amazed.  It does confirm my belief that film has truly become a medium available to everyone.

If there is one disappoint I have with the Dvd it is that there are no commentary tracks, or behind the scenes making of extras which would have been extremely useful to other independent filmmakers.  Hopefully this can be addressed in future releases.",1411344000,,1442,4.59375

5557241,5,B00B58FWTU,"Watched this on on hulu, and intend to add it to the DVD collection. It is a fantastic story, perhaps a little slow paced for the typical ADHD American audience, but more patient people will appreciate a good, perhaps even enthralling story, and excellent acting(particularly on the part of the lovely Silje Reinmo. With no lines in the film, she had to rely solely on body language and facial expressions to convey her character. She did so brilliantly. Granted, the fact that she is such a knock-out may have helped) Also, this film is definitely not deserving of the ""horror"" label it keeps getting slapped on it. It has some of the typical suspenseful feel of a good American horror movie, but doesn't really focus on that, and it is as far as possible from the plotless bloodbaths that have been released as horror lately. Yes, there was a couple of bloody scenes and gruesome deaths, but by that point in the film, the violence seems justifiable. This film would be more appropriately labeled SciFi-Fantasy, or perhaps a Modern Day Myth. It really conveys the core of the classic hulder myths on which it was based while adding a modern scientific spin to them.
I would recommend this film to anyone.",1407628800,,1206,4.720379146919432
5557242,5,B00B58FWTU,"One of the more unique movies I have ever seen. Begins like a horror flick or a particularly gruesome episode of C.S.I. with two working class shmoes who are called into clean up a home after the death of an elderly man. Leo is unflappable while Elvis is reactionary and clearly forcing himself to do a job he is unsuited for but needs to do for the money. What they find initially is very disturbing and finding Thale, a young mute woman who is perhaps older than she looks and whose circumstances seem to backup a very twisted event. The acting in this movie is very well done by everyone involved and the pacing is  rather benign and at the same time builds suspense bracing the viewer for the worst and then throws in a very unexpected yet satisfying beautiful ending.

 Also appreciated the fact that a riveting movie could be made on a small budget and in less than an hour and a half. During this time we are presented with three characters who each are dealing with their own set of dark issues, the simplicity and directness of the film is refreshing and the seriousness is conveyed without extracurricular drama and over-acting that Hollyweird relies so heavily on.

Loved it, so very much.",1406937600,,1200,4.567441860465117
5557243,5,B00B58FWTU,"A very good movie worth 5 stars in part because it is sincerely trying to do something different, and generally succeeds at doing so. The acting is mostly understated and very good. The pace is deliberate. Some have complained Thale is boring and ""nothing happens."" I can only assume these are folks who don't like movies such as Rosemary's Baby, The Haunting (1963), and other movies which take the time to develop characters and establish atmosphere. Thale is billed as a horror movie but is more of a fantasy drama, with moments of suspense, in a real-world setting. It bears some resemblance (not a lot but some) to 2009's Splice, but Thale is a much, much better movie. My one complaint about Thale is all the vomiting. Maybe it's a Scandinavian thing but I myself have a Scandinavian background and don't vomit half as much as the characters in this flick. Be patient through the first 5 or 10 minutes of the movie, as the puke content decreases after that. In all seriousness, if you are looking for action-based excitement and gorror (that is, gore horror) you will be disappointed. If you like the other movies I mentioned or are looking for something different then you might like this.",1406160000,,1196,4.7272727272727275

Without spoiling too much, Thale was a breath of fresh air in that it avoids many of the common horror tropes and cliches.  It doesn't inundate the audience with the sort of heavy-handed lore that comes standard with most creature/sci fi/fantasy films these days (indeed, what Thale IS is only openly referred to once.)  It doesn't try to cram itself into the lost footage format that's getting amazingly stale these days.  The main characters don't split up or do anything amazingly stupid to put themselves in danger; they're just a fairly average pair that have accidentally fallen upon something that is amazingly strange.

The film is minimalist; it elements are carefully pared down to what is necessary to carry the story, leaving your imagination to fill in many of the gaps.  This, to me, conveys a sense of trust and faith in the audience, and given the ham-fisted approach many movies take these days, I'm definitely appreciative.

Was the film perfect?  No.  Some of the elements that the film introduced didn't seem to make a lot of sense, and without ruining too much, the antagonist's backstory/motivation was a major example of this.  Unlike ET, where I felt like the government was  acting out of some misappropriated sense of protection or scientific inquiry, or Serenity, where the unnamed agent was acting towards his twisted sense of the 'greater good,' the antagonist in Thale just seemed like an evil government suit crammed into the story with little to no reason for his motivation beyond ""the huldra are evil and such"" (something we never really see in the film.)

That said, this is really nitpicking as Thale was an absolutely wonderful film.",1401840000,2,1863,4.87936507936508

Even the subtitles didn't detract from the story given the minimal dialogue (and I generally hate subtitles). The pacing was perfect, the dialogue very natural, and the story intriguing (as well as easy to buy into even without knowing the folklore behind the mystery). It was easy to feel for every character as a fully realized personality (and very quickly) without the need of exposition--or even much of a backstory. The mystery and suspense are maintained throughout the film without leaving the viewer feeling left out or confused (as many modern films of this type seem to do) and while there is some violence, it is not overtly graphic.

With the owner and supposed sole inhabitant of the cabin recently deceaed, the pair are more than surprised to find, in a lab-like basement, a young woman, apparantly captive, alive and immersed in a nutrient bath with a breathing apparatus hooked up to her.  After freeing the unusual, mute prisoner, the pair plan to alert authorities and wait for their arrival at the isolated cabin far out in the forest.  But the girl isn't what she seems, and someone or something else may already be coming for her.

I don't want to go too much into specifics as to the movie's second half: Thale is a movie that you don't want to have heard all the spoilers to before you see it.  It's original, strange, suspenseful and at times hauntingly beautiful.  It draws heavily from Scandinavian folklore and offers up some unusual and memorable visuals, which are helped along by a great sense of cinematography.  It's highly unique, but perhaps the best points of comparison would be movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pan-s-Labyrinth/dp/B003XC1OP2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pan's Labyrinth</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Let-Me-In/dp/B004LRVFX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Let Me In</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trollhunter-English-Subtitled/dp/B005ILYWN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trollhunter (English Subtitled)</a>; if you like those you've got to see this.

Leo and Elvis, two crime scene cleaners, discover Thale in a basement of a home they've been sent to. Over the course of the film, we begin to understand who Thale is, why she's been held in the basement, and who/what wants to get to her.

I will say this though: While trying not to give anything away, the pictures of Thale on the cover, as well as her description on the back cover, are a little inaccurate/misleading/deceptive.

5557341,5,B00B58FWTU,"I find myself buying more films from Sweden, Norway, Russia, and other European countries because the stories are superior, uniquely told, and more thought provoking than most of the crap coming out of LaLa-land.  Hate to say it but American films (except for most independents and small studio fare) could be made by thoughtless automatons.  Perhaps this is because American movie makers only care about the holy dollar, not the story.  Too much money is spent on special effects or terrible overpriced actors (?) and advertising.  I believe that LaLa-land can't make movies without nudity, foul language, anti-Americanism (I don't understand this position at all), thinly disguised racism, anti-God or anti-Christian, anti-family, etc messaging.  The few good films that get made earn Billions worldwide so I just don't get it.

Generally, foreign films are low budgeted endeavors concentrating more on story.  No matter the genre, the story is what matters.  In the case of ""Thale"", a film based on the ""hulder"" of Norwegian folklore, we have one of these beings, female, discovered by ""cleanup men"" (sort of a forensics team) as they process a death.  She's been locked away by members of a government research group for years, unable to speak, and not understanding her situation.

This movie cost about $10000 to make and not a penny is wasted.  Acting is very good and so are the special effects.  Thale is a great morality play and well worth watching.  The film is in Norwegian or dubbed English.  Subtitles are provided as are additional highlights.

From a flashback from a drone narration we know she was found and cared for by the dead Norwegian who lived there.

The film is an interesting concept. The characters started out interesting, but then became more boring as the film went along.

5557427,4,B00B58FWTU,"PRODUCT NOTE:  I bought the DVD/BluRay combo and the English dubbing was not very good, smacking of the wooden English voiceovers of Anime.

This movie was pretty ""neat"" but ultimately lacked the impressive storytelling (of Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale), character development (of Let The Right One In) or creature-based intrigue (of Troll Hunter) of other genre-fan-acclaimed Scandinavian favorites.  If you like any of these other movies then you'll probably find Thale's allure to be irresistible.  Just set your expectations appropriately for more of a good idea presented as a single-serving; almost an extended one-act augmented by flavorful flashbacks.

Leo (Jon Sigve Skard) and Elvis (Erlend Nervold) run ""No Shit Cleaning Service.""  They are basically a dead body clean-up crew and Leo is much more strong-stomached than his queasy partner.  On one of their jobs disposing of a dead man they come across an underground dwelling that looks like a mix of a science lab and a bomb shelter complete with weird recordings as if made by a researcher on his stenograph.  While exploring this ""lab"" they find a strange, mute, naked woman (Silje Reinmo; Bak lukkede drer).

The recordings reveal that she is ""Thale"", that she has been down there for decades without food, and that there are others like her and that they want her--or something from her.  Thale possesses preternatural strength and the gift of ESP/Telepathy, which she uses to communicate to Elvis why she was being kept down in that bunker.

As Leo and Elvis try to figure out exactly who (or even what) Thale is, their stay in the bunker becomes a fight for survival against ""something or someone.""  Meanwhile, we gradually learn more about Thale, her origin and those who seek her.

Much to my surprise, Silje Reinmo spends a lot of this movie at least partially naked, portraying the serious and challenging role of a creature that doesn't speak but is filled with fear and curiosity.  She communicates a powerful range of emotions with her physical demeanor, facial expressions, and especially her eyes.  She does a fantastic job with her almost alien expressions and movements that resemble a feral, animalistic early adolescence.  This role reminds me of Jenny Spain's starring role in Deadgirl (2008), during which Spain faced even more challenging and limiting restrictions.

Another shock was decent creature effects.  It was all CGI, but done well (except for the action, when the quality degenerated).  This struck me as a lower mid-budget film, so I forgave that.

After I saw the amazing Norwegian film ""Troll Hunter"", Sweden's stunning ""Let The Right One In"", the UK's fun ""Attack The Block"", South Korea's astonishing films ""A Werewolf Boy"" and also ""Howling"" (starring Song Kang Ho), I decided to give ""Thale"" a chance and I am glad I did. A horror/thriller/fantasy film of wonder and intrigue. I love foreign films to begin with from South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, China, Thailand, the Philippines, France, Sweden, the UK and now Norway is on the map. ""Thale"" is one of those films that creeps up on you and pulls you in. It is a film that is short and sweet and gets right to the point. I will post a blu-ray review for ""Thale"" once mine arrives in the mail. UPDATE: Very nice blu-ray transfer that really shines and pops in some scenes. Good audio as well.

The setting is beautiful at times, but primarily focused upon a woodland cabin (underground warren) and surrounding terrain. However, this low budget Indie approach works, as we experience the daily grind of two men who clean houses, including those with crime scenes or dead occupants. These characters are nicely developed as the story unfolds, and you end up caring about them. They are dealing with the burdens of life - as we all are. Their mundane cleaning assignment takes an ""Alice"" turn when they decide to fall down the metaphorical rabbit hole only to meet a seemingly ""habituated"" Huldra. The performances are good all around, with the actors carrying the water without much dialogue - they must rely upon emotion, interaction, flashbacks, physical, etc. The pace and plot are just fine, albeit slower than the big budget stuff - same feel as Troll Hunter. The CGI was well done for the price, and I deemed the rental cost worth it for the intro to the Huldra mythology. On my Indie scale, it's a 4 star, but temper your expectations to that production style. Finally, this doesn't meet my threshold for the ""horror"" category. It's barely Dark Fantasy.

5557431,4,B00B58FWTU,"A pair of unsuspecting cleaners stumble upon a mysterious girl that has been locked away beneath a remote cabin in the woods during one of their jobs. After searching the cabin, they quickly come to find that the lovely Thale may belong to a mythical race of woodland creatures, and that there are evil forces at work outside the cabin that hope to capture and exploit her for their own gain. Aleksander Nordaas brings the Scandinavian legend of the Huldra to life in the Fantasy Horror film, THALE. THALE is given a sense of whimsical wonder through Silje Reinmo's inquisitive performance as the titular creature. Reinmo acts as though she is experiencing the world for the first time, and lashes out with an animal-like ferocity when cornered. Erlend Nervold and Jon Sigve Skard are left to navigate us through the story as Elvis and Leo, whose personal defects give them an unbridled sense of humanity as we are drawn deeper in to their characters. The story, itself, seems quite strange at first for a Fantasy Horror piece of its kind, but Nordaas adapts many modern themes in order to blend myth with reality. THALE continues the trend of fanciful Scandinavian creature features as we have seen recently in RARE EXPORTS and TROLL HUNTER, bringing a dark new twist to ancient lore.

5557434,4,B00B58FWTU,"Of late Scandinavia has been receiving many accolades for their dark crime dramas, both in film and television. But the same region has also been producing small, often understated and better-than-average horror films as well: Let the Right One In, Sauna, Dead Snow, and now Thale. Even lesser films, like Rare Export or Troll, are often are more original and interesting than the typical horror-fest offerings found in the US, which far too often simply represent rehashes of previous movies striving to outdo their predecessors in blood and flesh. Granted, these Nordic tales often have little to do with the formula slasher or torture-porn produced with such repetitive frequency in the US, or the more-twisted-is-better fare that has of late come out of Japan, Korea and France. Instead, the better horror films from Scandinavia seem more concerned about atmosphere and dread occurring within the most mundane of settings and to the most ordinary of people, than the typical slash and flash, let alone unrelenting action used as distraction. Accompanied by droll humor and less reliance on shock and gore, their thrills are less overt but to my taste just as effective for not being heavy-handed, while placing greater emphasis on stories more original, both in terms of narrative and presentation, than their commoner, flashier counterparts. Not that these latter films can't be effective as well, but not when the viewer is being bludgeoned over and over again by the same devices and visual/auditory deceptions. So, to my mind, Scandinavia is not only producing better crime dramas these days than the US, but better if fewer horror films as well.",1363651200,10,1654,5.152416356877324
