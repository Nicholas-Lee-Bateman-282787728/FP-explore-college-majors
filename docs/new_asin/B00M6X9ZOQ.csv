6562053,4,B00M6X9ZOQ,"A recurrent delight in the three good Scream movies is cast members who deconstruct what needs to be in a good horror movie.

I'm going try to do that in this review.

Why does SNE2 work well?

Setting: Ideally, an unusual but still believable event will bring everyone together in an appropriate setting. Leads, supporting cast, Mr. Horrible have got to inhabit a place both justified and well stocked with the tools useful to mayhem. Unfortunately, most of the time, the event is so obvious and mechanical that sharp audience members think of sneaking into another theatre at the multiplex. However setting, premise, and back-story are made believable here.

Characters: Unlike most horror flicks, we are hooked into caring about these main characters. Love interest, repressed guy, and marriage broker--not unusual but here work. It is seeing these first three people in essentially caring roles (grim but caring) where their professionalism and human concern about what they do make us we care about them. An established bond between viewer and the victims-to-be is hardly ever this firmly established. ""Only connect"" happens here.

One step behind those we care about is always a monster. Even if it is not unearthly (Ripley gets a pass here) it is still going to be something superhuman. The deck is always stacked. (If the sheriff's shot doesn't hit the oxygen tank all is lost.) Some part of the plot is going to establish a sometimes-sick balance of a monster's strength matched against our own curiosity and desire not to be bored as we see how the last lambs are slaughtered.

Exposition: Some sort of back-story is necessary, particularly in a sequel. Most of the time it is just jammed in. When badly done, somebody just talks about it like a maid in the old fashion mystery who answers the phone and bathers all useful details in a lump. The necessary needs to be done; but SNE2 it is done seamlessly and with elegance: lot's of engaging action goes on while we are clued in.

Plot: Sex: The event and what appears its deadly consequence seems a staple of American horror. If we had its patent, we would all be rich and watching this movie in a home theatre in our Mac Mansion. Generally after somebody does something naughty, people start turning into corpses. (As Americans we like to think we follow a motto of ""Live Free or Die"" but our movies seem to say, ""Have Sex and Die."")

Plot: Other Stuff: Once the mayhem begins, there are any number of variants on the slaughter that follows.

Bad horror movies rely on a gruesome death not the loss of a character. In the bad, the guy who is clumsy or the girl who gasps too loudly dies. This means that the herd just got thinned and we see the event as a spectacle. A good movie saves its characters to the last microsecond and makes us feel their loss. This movie does; so there you go.

When it comes to plot, no good writer has ever entirely avoided either Shakespeare's rule of ""If it is important, say it three times"" so the audience will understand when it is used later."" Or the more simple law of ""If you mention a gun over the fireplace in Act I, kill somebody with it by Act III."" Most movies belabor or ignore these necessary refinements. This movie does the needed and necessary with care.

Good horror movies will avoid all of the following in closing moments: first responders counting bodies; a hint in any form of the possibility of a sequel; no unnecessary final fright after the movie is clearly over (Even Stephen King broke this rule in the first Carrie but then he's not perfect, just prolific and a genius.); and no...

Then too at some point, most so-so horror movies will settle for tears and snot, unthinking flight, brainlessly charging ahead or repeating mere variations or even repetitions on the running about already clearly unsuccessful. Such movies just plunge. A good movie will give respite. A smart movie will turn to a small detail mentioned before and use it now to make the pause believable and effective. But you know this and so did the screenwriters for SNE2.

Enjoy!

By the way, the directors pull a Hitchcock and appear on screen.  Theirs is not a walk on since they appear side by side on morgue dollies.",1412726400,,4212,4.680649526387009
6562054,5,B00M6X9ZOQ,See no evil 2 picks up where the first one was over. They showed clips from the first one to make sense of what happened. Now i think that this one is a little bit better than the first. I don't know it may just be me but still just wait till you see what happens in it i don't want to spoil anything so if you liked the first one than you have to see this.,1407369600,,357,3.6493506493506493

6562057,4,B00M6X9ZOQ,I liked this. My boyfriend is a wrestling fan told me to check it out. I usually don't watch slasher films. This wasn't bad though. Kane is a big man!,1518393600,,150,4.033333333333333

6562062,1,B00M6X9ZOQ,"Let me just say I liked the first movie. It was scary and had some pretty disturbing scenes. I never thought that it needed a sequel, but here we are with See No Evil 2, and its direct to DVD too. This was just completely unnecessary. First off, Jacob Goodnight shouldn't be still alive nor able to come back to life since he was just a normal human being who fell down a two story building and had his heart punctured by debris, he's not Jason Vorhees post F13 part 6 he's a pro wrestler. Second, why is the movie set immediately after the first one when this was made years after the first one came out? Third, showing clips from the first movie when seeing inside Jacob's mind is just lazy. Fourth and final, Jacob shouldn't be talking so much. Him repeating the lines ""I can see"" takes away most of his menace. I mean he only had one line in the first movie and only needed one line. This was just lazy and unnecessary, but it killed off some time. And in the end isn't that what really matters?",1513987200,3,999,4.2356020942408374

This movie resurrects the villian from the original film but makes him way more badass.

I feel that Kane is a better actor and killer instead of a wrestler as well a very intelligent person I seen a video on YouTube of him speaking on economics that made me say wow he should have stayed a teacher again this movie was a waste of time,1456704000,,884,3.8097826086956523

Then became confusing toward the end and I kept asking myself how can that be??  Overall you learn more about the character and abuse that was touched upon in the first one. His trigger is religion and sins and there is plenty in this movie to see. Much better than number one. The hacker scenes are more graphic although predictable.

6562202,2,B00M6X9ZOQ,"I have always thought the standard slasher movie in which the insane monster walks along at pace, but somehow always catches up to those running from him are stupid.  Of course, all the premises have to be in place that there is no communication out, every door is locked so no one can get out, but how would they have gotten out before the disaster began?  Everyone has to be in panic to die.  OK, but then the real stupid stuff starts, not just the presumptuous nonsense.

Like at the end, the guy is fast enough to get all the way around a building and knows the girl will be behind the door to kill her by stabbing through the door?  What is he?  Precient?  He wasn't when he was searching for them earlier in the movie.

He then seems to manage to make a hugely long trek to the only survivor's car and gets into the back seat (guess it was unlocked because there is no damage to the car).  The survivor sits in the car and thinks for a while, etc. and drives off.  But when he gets to a gate he must open, this seven foot monster that can't walk any better than Frankenstein has quickly and stealthily gotten around his back and comes up behind him.  He did all this after being injected with gallons of formaldehyde.

Again, why didn't the guy go straight to the police or get help to get the police?  Why didn't he notice a 7 foot behemoth in the back seat of a mid sized car (or smell him, the guy has formaldehyde, sweat and filth enough accumulated over what looks like years of working on a pig farm.

I don't mind some of these things when they make sense to a degree, but when all sense is just thrown out the window and there is absolutely no explanation for any of the inconsistencies, it just gets dumb.

full of impossibilities, this is fantasy horror at best.
granted, it is well produced.
however, if you have any brains, don't waste your time.

to point out 'some' of the issues:
the morgue is huge and has only 3 employees.
the killer shuts all the lights off in this huge morgue, a feat that would take an electrician more than 2 seconds.
the killer chains up all the exits in record time.
there are no emergency lights powered by batteries which have probably been part of public building requirements for the last 10,000 years.
there are no emergency fire alarms for the employees to use.
the killer pretends to be dead so he doesn't have to go to jail - his mortal wound being some type of impalement in his eye which seems to penetrate to his brain.
the morgue seemingly has no phones although it is carefully shown that all mobile devices are locked in a small safe while employees work.  the devices are never brought up after this display.  i suppose we are to presume that securing the building and shutting off the lights included disabling any and all outside communications.
one of the morgue employees is in a wheelchair.  obviously he's getting killed or will be the surviving hero.
and finally, the killer survives being embalmed by the last survivor only to kill him in a few moments by beating him to his own vehicle and hiding in the back seat.  how could the killer know which car was his?

i would recommend that the bad dude get a job in building maintenance as his true skill set appears to lean in that direction.

on top of all of this, you have rather good acting though.
the cast is much more deserving of a better script.",1447027200,3,1665,4.5083056478405314

6562285,5,B00M6X9ZOQ,"The unusually long (8 years) gap between a movie and its first sequel hasn't hurt See No Evil 2 in the least.  Featuring Glen 'Kane' Jacobs back in the role of chain-wielding, hulking slasher Jacob Goodnight, See No Evil 2 is actually a significant improvement over the original, which itself was a very fine horror movie despite a couple of flaws.

The eight-year gap doesn't exist in the movie itself, with events picking up just minutes or hours after the conclusion of the first one, with a dying Goodnight being rushed to the hospital before dying en route and eventually being delivered to the same morgue as the bodies of his previous victims.  At the morgue, it's the middle of the night and virtually deserted, with one of the place's three graveyard shift workers, Amy (Danielle Harris of the Halloween movies and an impressive number of other horror films) ready to sign out for the night and head off to celebrate her birthday with a small gathering of friends.  When news arrives of fresh bodies coming in, she scraps her plans, prompting her co-workers to conspire and call over a few of their mutual friends to have a smaller celebration after their work is done.  It's only after the shipment comes in that they realize that what they've got there are the remains of a massacre, complete with the body of the killer himself.
Jacob Goodnight turns out to be not quite dead though, and after reviving and attacking two of the friends, proceeds to target anything else that moves.  It's past midnight, down several floors underground in a labyrinth-like collection of rooms and corridors and autopsy chambers, with many of the secondary doors locked up for the night, and many of the chambers containing large numbers of diverse cutting instruments.  It's hunting time.

The stalking and hiding and pursuit scenes, and the fact that the main group gets seperated into two smaller units, neither of which wants to leave without their friends, actually make it credible how Goodnight is able to corner his prey and cut off the few unlocked routes out of the morgue.  It's also very much of a vicious cat-and-mouse game, with the killer on a couple of occasions seemingly slowing down his onslaught for a few moments just to let a seemingly doomed victim escape and stay alive for a few more minutes, thus prolonging the fun.  Goodnight is a killing machine, but one that clearly relishes his work.

He also comes off as smarter and more powerful this time around.  The look of the character has been modified, with Jacob using a burn victim's mask to cover his face (badly damaged in the previous movie) and incorporating a leather apron (of the kind worn by coroners during autopsies) as part of the makeshift binding for some of his other wounds (again, from the previous movie).  He was an effective villain the first time, but here he comes closer to being a horror character that can actually be counted among the likes of Jason Voorhees, Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers and company. An interesting sidenote is that the cast of Goodnight's actual or potential victims contains cast members that can be traced to all three of the 'Big 3'; Harris, as mentioned, appeared in several of the Halloween films, while Katherine Isabelle was in Freddy Vs. Jason.  The movie itself is well made, with gruesomely believable special effects, a solid overall job on production, and good performances all round.  Having made the second chapter of this series a notch above its predecessor, and having now established that Jacob Goodnight can come back from more than what was thrown at him in the first film, I see no reason there couldn't be a See No Evil 3.  Hopefully it just won't take eight years this time.",1433289600,,3712,4.785602503912363

I loved the first See No Evil and while it was not a horror classic or anything it was still very fun. Since the day it was released I had been waiting for a sequel.  The years went by and I could not believe that it never came. The talk had been there since they started filming the first one. As the years and films from WWE went by they even released sequels for some of their other films. Finally the day came and it was announced that a part two was coming out, and that it was going to be darker. I was so excited that the film was finally going to be made.

Jacob Goodnight is dead and on his way to the morgue for his final processing along with the victims of his from the first film. Unfortunately for the staff on the nightshift this actually isn't true, Jacob is very much alive. So as the night goes on and staff starts to disappear it seems one body that came in is also missing, Jacobs. Now the crew must fight to stay alive as Mr. Goodnight stalks the halls of the morgue.

This is a good film and a nice sequel to the first film and like the Soska Sisters wanted it looks and feels like a different movie from the first. I have to admit that they did a good job making this look and feel like a more traditional horror film. You see the first movie in this series was more fun and over the top and seemed less like a horror film even though it was. This one has got the look and tone down perfect even down to the film taking place in a dark cold morgue. Add in that the characters are trapped in said building and it is very horror atmospheric.

Now with all that said I have to say that a big deal to the twins was the kills in this film and for what the movie is they were very good. But I liked the over the top kills of the original just as much so I don't think they upped the anti here like they bragged about. Still it was a good film and makes me want a third film even more, perhaps the look and feel of this one with campy fun of the first is the recipe for a classic film with Jacob Goodnight.

The acting here is perfect for what was called for and while there very little likable characters I kinda think that makes you root for Kane even more here, which is fun. The writers here came up with a good story to follow up the last that called for a smaller budget, in fact they have gone on to write two upcoming WWE films in Lockdown which will have the excellent Dean Ambrose in it and then a film called Bermuda, which is about, you guessed it the Bermuda Triangle.

The DVD comes with some behind the scenes stuff as well as a feature on the Directing Sisters among other things. I really wish we would have had a commentary on here. Out of all the types of films I love commentaries on it is horror films. I very disappointed that we didn't get one here. One with the sisters or with them and Kane would have been great. I say check it out if you are a horror fan or wrestling fan, it is a good film over all.",1427155200,2,2958,3.9864864864864864

I thought the first installment was much better than the second (as is usually the case for most sequels).  The first one actually had a decent script, plot, and served up enough gore to please most gorehounds.

The second installment is just silly.  Kane's character (Goodnight) is hauled to the morgue since he was apparently killed after being impaled on pointy iron bars.  But we all know if there's a sequel, a little impaling isn't going to kill your antagonist.  Amy (played by Danielle Harris) also works in the morgue.  She secretely pines for another assistant there, as he does (also) for her.  Her friends throw her a suprise birthday party inside the morgue...and the rest is history.  This film contains one scene that is so nauseating you may want to turn off (or at least FF) through it; if you're a necrophile, I'm sure you had to clean yourself afterwards.  Lots of killings involving morgue ""playthings.""

(Something only a true fan or collector would relate to)  Cheers to The Twins for wanting to try to revive a creepy killer, however I think the expectations of a new Horror Icon are a bit overstated.  In my opinion that can only be achieved when the original work offers a complete new idea. See No Evil was just yet another movie faulting the mother, so will always have that limitation going forward. While I give the finished product 3 stars, after watching the extras it made me want to give it 5 stars for the spirit in which this movie was made.

The one thing I'll give credit to in this movie was that they were creative with some of the ways the death's happened but was just pretty much your typical ""slasher chases kids"" movie that I would only watch once & probably never again unlike how I actually watched & enjoyed the first one on more than one occasion so I would recommend this for a stream or rental at best.",1416355200,,1259,4.566371681415929

This is all dull and uninspired (not even the kills have any real verve) and the general impression is this was quickly made to cash in on the vastly superior original.

6562351,3,B00M6X9ZOQ,"Even though I'm giving this movie three stars that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it.  I actually did.  It has a lot of flaws, but in the end it is a pretty fun, although forgettable slasher.

Let's start with the positives.  First off, the movie looks great.  I'm guessing the budget on this film was pretty low, but the film never looks cheap.  The lighting, set design, cinematography and direction are all solid.  Most of this movie is shot in low light, and yet the image is never swallowed up in the shadows.  The direction works towards creating some solid tension during several scenes, and there is enough creativity on display to avoid the point and shoot plague that befalls so many low budget horror films.

Secondly, the cast is good.  There are no stand out characters, as they spend ninety percent of the film running around the maze like corridors of the morgue, but everyone does what they are supposed to do, and does it well. The two stand outs, and the obvious draw for horror fans are Danielle Harris and Katharine Isabelle.  Danielle Harris is a slasher pro, and handles her part with ease, always seeming in the moment.  She could have easily phoned her part in, but instead she sells every dramatic beat with gusto, giving her role enough weight to make the audience care about her.  Katharine Isabelle is the real stand out for me though.  Her part is more over the top, and Isabelle tackles the goofy, exaggerated character with a vengeance.  She also avoid being annoying, which is a risk her type of character runs.  The rest of the cast sells the film just as well, and in the few moments before the killing starts, they are believable as friends who are just out to have a good time. You can see why they like each other, and in turn, the audience gets to be a little more invested in them then the usual cardboard cutout characters you see in films like this.

Kane as Jacob Goodnight is probably the weakest link.  When he has to be the strong, silent killer he works wonders, using his imposing physical stature to sell himself as a very real threat.  When he has to emote and deliver emotionally sappy dialogue, he feels a bit forced.  You'll know the moments when you get to them, and they sadly come off as more comical than emotional.

Now, this movie is violent, but it is not particularly gory.  Jason Goodnight tosses his victims around like rag dolls, crushes their throats with his bare hands, pulls them by hooks, gouges out their eyes with his fingers... you get the idea.  The actual gore, as in the special effects work, is fairly restrained, although not completely dry.  There are a few interesting kills, but the majority of the icky sticky bloody stuff is left to the imagination, with the majority of the gore being left up to blood splatter.  I'm guessing this is mostly due to budgetary reasons, and for the most part it works.  First off, all the effects that are on display look great.  I would rather they do what they did here, and use the budget to create a few top notch gore gags, instead of spreading their budget thinner, and giving more mediocre gore.  I'm a seasoned horror fan, and I didn't feel cheated.  These aren't off screen kills, just ones that pull back before becoming too over the top.

The two things holding this film back are common problems in horror sequels.  The first is the constant call backs to the original film, particularly flashbacks to footage from See No Evil.  The two films have wildly different feels to them, especially in the look and feel of the sets, and it can be a bit jarring in presentation.  Also, outside of a few repeated scenes connected to Jacob's mother, the scenes really offer nothing other than a rehash of the original film's kills (which again, are vastly different in tone and presentation to the second film).

The biggest issue this film has is pacing.  Once Jacob shows up the chase is on, which means a LOT of shots of characters running down very similar looking hallways and screaming and trying to open doors.  Most of this film is one giant chase scene, but the constant cut aways to characters wandering aimlessly hurt the film's pace, and make parts of the film lag.  Now, this isn't nearly as bad as some films in the genre, but after a while it starts to become obvious that the runtime is being padded.  Pacing issues aside, though, I must say that I was never bored.

See No Evil 2 is not going to go down as a classic in the slasher genre.  It probably won't be remembered for very long after it comes out.  Still, as far as straight to DVD/VOD horror movies go, it is still a pretty solid entry.  While it may disappoint with it's restraint in the blood and guts department, it still manages to create some tense set pieces, and do so while looking very solid.  Give it a try.",1415491200,3,4803,4.516801853997682

I know the Soska supporters will say they failed here because they didn't write the screenplay, but the fact is that the director(s) control the film and this sequel fails to deliver on nearly every department except blood and gore. Missing from this film is the atmosphere from the original and the kills are unexceptional, if bloody. Watch the original again and skip this one, unless you have to see every slasher film ever made.

6562364,4,B00M6X9ZOQ,"Katharine Isabelle is absolute adorable and hilarious in this film. Her character is very entertaining and is a great departure from her other roles as Ginger Fitsgerarld, Mary Mason, and Margot Verger. Despite the cool tones of the scenery and lighting, she still manages to pop with color on the screen.

Since it's a Soska film, it is clever while also fulfilling the expectations of its specific subgenre. So there are kills that are fully expected, but it also subverts your expectations after it gets really into it. But there are so many great, interesting and entertaining characters that you can't help but be very disappointed when they meet their demise. It is a slasher, so don't expect many survivors.

I have not seen See No Evil, but with the editing and the ways that the film showed bits and pieces of the first film to make sure new members of the audience know what's going on, I am interested in seeing the first one now because of this movie.

It is not as good as American Mary, but it is a very entertaining film until the last third. The last third has some touching moments and impressive kills, but we end up following the least interesting characters and waiting to see which of them is going to survive the encounter with Jacob Goodnight.

I like it, and I do recommend it. It's definitely better than a lot of other horror movies out there. But if you haven't seen American Mary yet, see this one first, as American Mary is the superior Soska Sisters film.",1414540800,,1485,4.592452830188679
6562365,5,B00M6X9ZOQ,After some technical difficulties I was finally able to watch the film.  This is the rare sequel that I liked more than the original. The film showcases Glenn Jacobs (aka Kane from the WWE) returning as the murderous and tortured Jacob Goodnight. The film picks up almost real time from the end of the first with Jacob arriving at the morgue. Danielle Harris is working on her birthday when he arrives. A group of co-workers and friends throw her a surprise party. Of course Jacob gets up and shenanigans ensue. The film has a really nice mix of horror with comedic moments (most provided by Katherine Isabelle with one scene she will have to explain in every interview she will give for the rest of her life). The cast was excellent with each fulfilling a vital function to the film but this was Glenn Jacob's film. He is a tour-de-force as Jacob Godnight. He provides a breathtaking balance between sadistic murderer and abused child (which if you watched the first film you undestand that he was tortured by his mother and this is why he becomes the monster). His duality lifts this piece above the standard slasher faire that is par the course for most torture porn horror that most slashers strive for today. Great film and well worth seeing for horror fans for Halloween.,1414540800,,1277,4.6755555555555555

Jacob (Kane) is taken to the morgue where a b-day party is being thrown for Amy, she is always working) I don't even think I need to tell you more...chaos and mayhem ensue.

Again, the first was not grand cinema nor a superb horror film but the ambiance in the first film was good and the kills were pretty fun and somewhat inventive. The sequel was a decent enough effort and it's not bad but it lost the flavor that made the first one fun meaning no eyeball gouging... This may seem silly but that was sort of a trademark of the first film; the fact that Jacob was gonna pull some eyes out of their sockets from some poor fool's head. Not to be in this one sad to say.

Sequels often suffer from diluted efforts but what really should have happened here was to stick to the eye gouging, hence the title See No Evil... So then it really becomes rather unimaginative and mundane. Kane is certainly an immense man and an awesome looking killer for sure but his imposing figure seems to get wasted and this movie could have been more fun to watch had they stayed in the vain of the first film.",1414281600,,994,4.177083333333333

6562373,4,B00M6X9ZOQ,"Im not a big fan of the original See No Evil. Despite the use of the imposingly massive WWE superstar Glenn Kane Jacobs, the film was a by-the-numbers slasher that generated very little suspense and its juvenile delinquent characters didn't generate much endearment to give us someone to root/fear for. But, the film does have a bit of a following and did well, especially on home media. So, after 8 years Jacob Goodnight is back and hes not only bringing fan favorite scream queens Danielle Harris and Katharine Isabelle along with him but, he is being directed by the devious duo behind American Mary, the Soska Sisters, as well.

The story opens the same night as the massacre at The Blackwell Hotel, with pretty morgue attendant Amy (Danielle Harris) about to leave her shift and head out to celebrate her birthday. But, with bodies from the massacre heading in, Amy decides to stay and help her co-worker Seth (Kaj-Erik Eriksen) with the added workload and thus her friends, including vixen with a morbid side, Tamara (Katharine Isabelle) decide to surprise her at the morgue with an impromptu birthday party. But, there is still some life in the prone corpse of vicious serial killer Jacob Goodnight (Glenn Kane Jacobs) and soon he rises from his slab, with an assortment of postmortem surgical tools at his disposal, to continue his work by slaughtering the sinners who are partying in the morgue. Will any of them escape alive as Goodnight seals them in and begins adding to the bodies already stored there?

With the Twisted Twins taking over from ex-porn director Gregory Dark, the film is an improvement over the first one and for some very surprising reasons. The Soskas are working from a script by Nathan Brookes and Bobby Lee Darby and thus it doesnt quite have the delightfully eccentric tone of Mary, that they wrote themselves but, it does have their style and does have a bit more fun with this slasher sequel than the deadpan and too-serious-for-its-own-good first flick. And at first I was a little disappointed as the film started out and seemed to be a bit routine coming from directors whose work is anything but, until the second half suddenly cranks things up considerably and thats where the film surprised me a little bit. And its not with the kills, which are cool, that the Soskas really got my attention with, but, with some surprisingly poignant moments between the characters, mostly involving Harris Amy, that really resonated and really added something to the proceedings. Its been a while since Ive seen a slasher/horror that took the time to have such nice character moments between the carnage and it really added to the endearment of those characters and the suspense of wanting them to get out of there moderately intact. The film also deviated at times from the slasher formula and that added some freshness to it and the Soskas, as with American Mary, give us some disturbingly gruesome moments but, without going overboard or being gross for gross sake like SNE #1. A little restraint makes the violent moments all the more effective when they do come and there are a couple that elicited an out loud whoa from me as I watched. Add in some nice moody cinematography by Mahlon Todd Williams that takes good advantage of the city morgue setting and a nice score from The Newton Brothers and you have an entertaining little slasher that does have the usual slasher plot holes such as, are there so few exits in such a large public building that Goodnight could seal them all on all floors and without anyone knowing, and why are the guests cellphones locked in a safe? but, it still entertains like its supposed to.

As for the cast Kane is as imposing as ever as Goodnight. Harris does really strong work here. Not only in creating a little depth for Amy, who has chosen a career that is obviously not popular with her family, but, really shines in some of those character moments I mentioned before. Amy is a strong, though slightly cynical, heroine with guts and a heart. She also has a nice chemistry with Eriksen, who is good as Seth. Seth is crushing on her big time and she knows it and the scene when they reveal their mutual feelings for each other works really well and the actors chemistry makes it work despite there being a 7 foot madman stalking them at the moment. Isabelle is a hoot as the promiscuous babe with a dark side, Tamara. Its not a deep role as her Mary Mason and it seems like, this time, shes having some fun with a more ditzy part and letting Harris do the more serious emoting. Her postmortem lap dance for Jacob Goodnights corpse is a fun number, to say the least. The rest of the cast are solid and despite Amys brother Will (Greyston Holt) being a bit of a self-centered jerk, we have a fairly likable cast of supporting characters with Chelan Simmons as pretty blonde Kayla, Lee Majdoub as Tamaras boyfriend Carter and Michael Eklund as the chief morgue attendant Holden. A much more endearing bunch than the angry delinquents that populated the first flick.

So, See No Evil 2 may not be a classic but, it is a solid and entertaining slasher that has some surprisingly effective quieter moments in-between the well-orchestrated carnage. The Soskas bring the action and suspense, especially in the second half and even with its barely 90 minute running time, give us some nice resonating character scenes bolstered by its lead actors especially, Harris, who does some of her best work. And thats what impresses about the Twisted Twins the most they can deliver some very sick and twisted moments but,  can also deliver some poignant quiet moments in between, just like the little conversations between Mary and Lance in American Mary. Another intriguing film from two of the more original filmmakers out there.",1414281600,,5785,4.7522388059701495

6562379,2,B00M6X9ZOQ,"In the tradition of Halloween 2 (1981) and Cold Prey 2 (2008) the killer from the first film is supposedly dead and ends up at the hospital or morgue.  Once there, unfortunately, he turns out to be less dead than everybody thought.  See No Evil 2 differs from those two obvious influences in one very important way that I will get to in a moment.

See No Evil 2 is a huge improvement over the original which was directed like a pornographic movie that delivered all of its money shots exactly when you expected them.  See No Evil 2 is much smarter, rarely killing its characters when you expect or in the way you expect, which results in considerably more suspense than the first film ever mustered.

See No Evil 2 was directed by Soska Sisters (American Mary) and they've brought a cast headed by not one but two scream queens--Katherine Isabelle (American Mary and the Ginger Snap films) and Danielle Harris (Rob Zombie's Halloween films).  See No Evil 2 is well-directed and paced.  Unfortunately the Soska Sisters are working with someone else's material here and the script eventually reveals itself to be nothing more than an exceptionally well-directed and acted body count flick, which is a letdown if you are familiar with the Soska Sisters previous movies.

While the killer in the hospital set-up worked well previously in two similar sequels the vital difference between those films and See No Evil 2 is that in the earlier films the revived killer was after the girl who survived the original film.  See No Evil 2, on the other hand, gives the viewer no one in particular to root for, which makes the film kind of dull after a while.

See No Evil 2 is an above average slasher movie but as the Soska Sisters' follow-up to American Mary I expected a lot more.",1413936000,2,1771,4.6293929712460065

Riddled with cliches and logical loopholes, the only thing to really stand out is the decent performances of a few actors. I did find the sequel more enjoyable than the first, but it does very little to develop the character of Jacob Goodnight.",1413936000,,357,4.59375

I was curious to see what they would do with the genre and wasn't disappointed.  Goodnight makes Jason look like he needs to hit the gym. This fast-paced, muscular slasher delivers creative kills and effective scares.  At the same time, the characters show the touches of the weirdness that defined the sister's earlier work. This a far superior sequel and and probably the one of the better direct-to-dvd sequels I've seen so far.",1413936000,2,567,4.835051546391752

6562384,3,B00M6X9ZOQ,"Left eye- right eye!  Who can tell the difference?  Everyone but the twisted sisters!  I liked the first See No Evil okay, but interesting note.  At one point in the 1st movie Kane's left eye is destroyed by a metal pipe.  Big hole, really bloody.  In this movie it's his right eye that's destroyed!  They actually show a flashback of Kane losing his left eye.  In the very next shot his left eye is fine and his right eye is gone!!!  How is someone this stoopyd?!  This is the worst, dumbest, most amateur mistake I've ever seen in a movie!!!
It's painful, it really is.  Not losing an eye.  I mean sure that's painful too.  It's painful because I love this genre of movies and I very much enjoyed American Mary- their last film.  Also Danielle Harris and Katharine Isabel are awesome as always.  Big fan of both of them and I think they do a terrific job.  As a slasher/monster movie it does bother me that the main character's resurrections (2 of them) are never explained and nor is the fact that he moves like a ninja.  I kind of hope there's a 3rd movie that explains his weird and inconsistent supernatural abilities.  Frankly that also really bothers me.  It's a decent rent, but unless your a big fan of the sisters or the actresses in the movie it's only a rent.  I like the sisters and respect their passion, but they need to try a lot harder.  I'm a perfectionist and I think it takes 1 to make a good movie even of this type.  Effects and kills are good and there is some humor which helps.  I wish them luck.  Maybe this movie would be better with some alcohol.  Then you might not notice the mistakes.",1413936000,,1616,4.3244147157190636
6562385,1,B00M6X9ZOQ,"I was actually rather hyped for it because I didn't mind the first film. I thought that it had potential to be a pretty decent home video series (like Wrong Turn). Sadly, It's a bit of a let down. Aside from the generic, predictable plot, It's painfully slow and takes a good 1/3 of the run time in order to get any where. So if you actually managed to sit through that part, and God bless you if you do because I ended up skipping most of it, you'll realize that it simply goes down hill from there. The poor performances, Bad casting, and lack-luster kills/lack of thrills simply ruin it.

Simply put - Don't bother. It's neither worth buying nor renting.",1413849600,4,657,4.385245901639344
6562386,4,B00M6X9ZOQ,"See No Evil 2 picks right up where See No Evil left off. Seth, Amy, and their boss, Holden are working the late night shift at the local morgue and Amy is preparing to get off her shift and meet her friends for her birthday celebration. All such plans are put on hold when they receive word that a number of bodies are being sent to the morgue. The bodies consist of Jacob Goodnight and the multiple people he slaughtered, as this just so happens to take place on the same night he went on his mass murdering--shades of the first See No Evil.

Things turn out for the better when Amy discovers that her friends Kayla, Tamara, Carter, Seth, and her brother, Will surprised her with a birthday celebration at the morgue with the permission of Holden. Not too long after, Tamara and her boyfriend Carter leave the celebration and go to look at the bodies. After uncovering Goodnight's body, she becomes turned on by it (necrophiliac alert) and she and Carter begin to have sex in the room. The energy and act of the sex somehow resurrects Goodnight who kills Carter, while Tamara barely manages to escape.

Goodnight goes on to find a plastic transparent mask and chooses his weapons before raiding the morgue floor to floor, hall to hall, in search for his next victim. From there, the celebration is over and this once fun night has quickly transitioned into a fearful and deadly blood-filled cat and mouse game in the morgue. Jacob Goodnight is back from the dead and ready to punish those he comes across and make them pay for their sins

Overall: See No Evil 2 really isn't as bad as what a lot of these negative critics make it out to be. While the plot is cliche and some of the characters are stereotypical, the Soska Twins put their own perverse spin on it and make it into something worthwhile. It doesn't take long for the action to start, so you won't be twiddling your thumbs waiting and wondering when the action comes in for too long. The Jacob Goodnight character is given more dialogue than the first See No Evil, so you'll hear him talk quite a bit more in this sequel. In a way, I was hoping that Kane would've used one of his wrestling masks for this sequel but the clear face mask doesn't look all that bad either. Some say See No Evil 2 is more gruesome than the last and in a way that could be true as Jacob Goodnight uses a variety of weapons to obliterate his victims with but personally I find the first one to be more violent. The ending also leaves way for another potential sequel (so keep your eyes peeled for it). Overall, See No Evil 2 is a fairly well done sequel put together by the Soska Twins that I recommend giving a watch this Halloween season",1413849600,14,2679,4.4080808080808085

6562388,3,B00M6X9ZOQ,"I didn't think the first one was that good to warrant a sequel. Jacob (Glenn Jacobs) because ""Jason"" might bring a lawsuit is our killer who died at the end of the first film, but didn't. Like Jason, he comes back to life, wears a mask, is huge and kills kids who are sinners.

The setting is the city morgue as Seth (Kaj-Erik Eriksen) and Amy (Danielle Harris) work the graveyard shift on her birthday. Bodies are brought to the morgue from the end of the first feature, including the killer. Amy is given a surprise birthday party, because killing just a few people and a guy in a wheel chair has been done before and better. Oh where are the chainsaws when you need one.

This is another me-too slasher attempting to remake another Friday the 13th series.

6562389,3,B00M6X9ZOQ,"Directed by Jen & Sylvia Soska, this is their first studio film & their first film not written by them. And after making quite an impression of their indie films, Dead Hooker in a Trunk & American Mary, how does this one hold up? Unfortunately, this is not one of their best. To be honest, I really wanted liked this one & I did to a certain extent. Now the sequel is not awful, but it just becomes a very average slasher as the film progressed. The first See No Evil is by no means a masterpiece, but it's generally regarded as a guilty pleasure & lots of fun to watch. WWE's Glenn ""Kane"" Jacobs is very much the star here as Jacob Goodnight. His acting is limited, but he's still intimidating as he was in the last film. Scream Queen, Danielle Harris is good here as our lead heroine, but easily the best performance is Katharine Isabelle who brings a much needed flavor into the film. She is delightfully hammy & clearly having a lot fun as the promiscuous one. Now--I'm not going lie, I was bit disappointed with the death scenes. With some blood splatters here & there which are beautifully shot, but the kills are so tamed & not even original about them. The first film had these labyrinthine & very over the top deaths which representing each of the victims with a dark irony to it, but here you don't get none of that. I understand this is a straight-to-video sequel with a very limited time & budget, but having such talent like the Soska Sisters behind the camera, you expected a lot more from them. Overall, See No Evil 2 is an average follow up which is predictable at times & could have been so much more. Clearly, this was made with good intentions & if it was made by lesser known people this could have been a quick, generic, paint by numbers slasher film. With all that said, I still recommend the film if you are fan of the people behind it & want to show your support. Just don't get too excited for this one. For that I give See No Evil 2 a RENTAL",1413504000,6,1967,4.290322580645161
6562390,3,B00M6X9ZOQ,"Being a fan of the first installment I had very high hopes for this sequel seeing as this year has been lacking in the horror department. I'm sorry to say I was somewhat entertained but disapointed. The beginning was fun and had a creepy feel to it when Jacob was brought to the morgue,like when Jason and Michael Myers were brought to the county morgue in their respective films.

There was only one or two memorable kills in the film as far as effects go ,most people were choked ,killed off screen or some other effect dodging method!

Danielle Harris plays it straight while Katharine Isabelle turns up the camp and plays it for laughs in her performance! The acting was good of course as the main actors are great and deserve a better script than spending two thirds of the film running through the halls of a morgue acting like rats in a maze.but when they do get to act the chemistry is really good between the characters.

Kane looked cool in his new garb but the fact that he came back from death AGAIN he seemed too human in his speech and reasoning this time around. The story was basic but worked OK.I'm being so tough on this because this isn't some film by amateurs but the Soska Sisters!",1413504000,,1202,4.429864253393665
6562391,4,B00M6X9ZOQ,"It's odd that this sequel was released 9 years later, but it proves to be damn entertaining. For the most part the cast is fun and Kane is very mean spirited here.

6562392,2,B00M6X9ZOQ,"This movie somehow manages to incorporate nearly EVERY single horror movie cliche there is.  You have a good looking girl that dropped out of Med school to pursue a career as a mortician.  (Now don't misunderstand, there's nothing wrong with wanting to be a mortician, or even a good looking woman being a mortician (though I've never actually seen one) but no one drops out of Med school to take it on?!  At least, I can't imagine.)  Then you have her overprotective brother.  Her WAY too slutty friends (which honestly, isn't all that out of the ordinary), the silent (but dreamy) mortician kid she works with that is in love with her and she secretly loves as well.  And last, but not least, we've got a guy in a wheelchair as the boss.  As if only to throw something ELSE into the mix.

It's Amy's (Danielle Harris) birthday.  She's supposed to go meet all her friends for a drink after work, but instead decides to hang around to help when a call comes in.  She walks into a room full of corpse's only to be surprised by her friends.  FANTASTIC....  They proceed to throw a ""party"" by each couple heading in a different direction to get their gratuitous ""sex scene"" on.  Some party?

Ok, ok.  Here's what gets me.  As Tamara (Katharine Isabelle) and her boyfriend head into a room, she discovers the body of serial killer, Jacob Goodnight (Glenn Jacobs).  Apparently, she's got a massive fascination going on with this guy?  She proceeds to climb on top of him and give him a lap dance.  Her boyfriend, finds this ONLY a little unsettling until she kisses the corpse.  He then gets only mildly angry and the two begin to make out and get their ""lovin"" on.  Now, maybe it's just me, but if my girlfriend kissed a corpse, there isn't any getting angry or anything, it's me leaving an (most likely) never talking to her again.  But that's just me.  Regardless, you get the picture and can obviously guess how this scene ends.

This is pretty much how the entire movie is played out.  However, the ending is COMPLETELY stupid, as it's just another set up for a sequel.  Will I watch that one?!  OF COURSE I WILL!  Don't ask me why.

Even as bad as the movie is (and you obviously know it's going to be going into it) it's still filmed well and has a decent look.

When Goodnight rises and begins killing again no one is safe. This is yet another movie that there isn't too much to say about it. This is pretty much the same thing as the first movie but this takes place in a morgue instead of a hotel. The movie is nothing more than gore and how many ways can we kill someone and how much blood can we show. I realize that this is a horror movie and it is what fans are looking for but to me there is no suspense. There is no connection to any characters so all you think when one of them die is gross. I'm sure many people will like this and it is made for a certain group but for me horror involves more than killing and blood. Overall, a movie that gore fans will love.

After the original, I went in with high hopes, but those hopes were dispatched faster than a sex-crazed teenager in a horror movie. Half the movie is flashbacks lifted from the first movie; it's as though the story they developed wasn't detailed or substantial enough to carry the entire movie, so they had to fluff it with filler. The story line is far fetched, more so  than your average slasher film, and you end up spending the entire movie cringing and flinching, not from the scares but because of how truly awful it is.
