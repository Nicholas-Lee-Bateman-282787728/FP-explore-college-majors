8061611,3,B0009IXRKI,This is older and not as good as Unlocking the Code with Susan Sarandon but still good.  A much simpler version that does not really go into Mary Magdaline until the end and is mostly the Arthur legend that is all about the cup.,1334880000,,228,4.181818181818182
8061612,3,B0009IXRKI,I was expecting more from this History Channel's Holy Grail but the information are not much different from what you hear from Da Vinci Code's echo documentaries. This is a very brief documentary and the quality is not that good.,1164931200,6,229,4.75
