There are two primary talking heads along with some Monks and what to me, although I could be wrong, was a suspicious focus on certain meditation groups/gurus/practices that like in ""what the bleep? when you dig a little deeper find out almost everyone was involved with the Ramtha School of Enlightenment (ie. JZ Knight's channeled cash cow).
I like the interviews I have heard with the producer and I like the sound of the research he is doing, but I wouldn't even have the ability get through this if it were free on youtube. I do hope his other vids are better done.",1437004800,,878,4.425925925925926
