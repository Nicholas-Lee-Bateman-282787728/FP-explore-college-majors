2315599,4,B0009S4J50,"I rather enjoyed this DVD. I am a fan of Pink Panther and my kids love him too. I thought this DVD was fairly good. It wasn't as good as the first and second volumes, but I liked it a lot better than the 4th volume DVD. I recommend that you buy this DVD. It's full of laughs that are remarkable.",1155859200,,295,3.8524590163934427
2315600,3,B0009S4J50,"Of the three individual Pink Panther Classic Cartoon Collection DVDs, volume 3 is my least favorite.  It has cartoons from 1968-75 and it seems the writers were running out of ideas.  A lot of these episodes are bland and uninspired with plots that were done before.  A lot of PP chasing things, dogs getting blamed for PP's deeds, insect trouble, etc.  There is even a flash back episode (""Pink-In"").  It also includes what I think is the worst PP cartoon of all time, ""Extinct Pink.""  PP, dinosaurs and a caveman run around competing over a bone.  It has to be seen to appreciate how stupid it is.  Not only that but it includes a laugh track!!??  The only episode here that had promise is ""Pink Aye,"" but it ends with the old lounge chair turned lion gag.  If you only want to buy one PP DVD, get volume 1.  It has ""Pink, Plunk, Plink"" that includes a cameo appearance by Henry Mancini, ""Pink Ice"" and ""Sink Pink"" which feature PP speaking, and ""Super Pink"" which, even with the laugh track, is one of my favorite PP cartoons.  Here's what volume 3 has to offer:

Pinkcome Tax:  PP (in Robin Hood style) tries to save a man imprisoned for his inability to pay taxes.
Pink-a-Rella: PP gets his paws on magic witch's wand and turns a poor, plain Jane into a princess so she can win a date with Pelvis Parsely.  Funny part:  Pelvis tries the slipper on PP.
Pink Pest Control:  PP has a termite problem.
Think Before You Pink:  PP has trouble crossing the street (uh...yeah).
Slink Pink:  PP sneaks into a home with stuffed wildlife and keeps getting the hunter's dog in trouble (this story line had been done several times before).
In the Pink of the Night:  PP is not an easy riser.
Pink on the Cob:  PP has crow trouble.
Extinct Pink:  (Laugh Track=LT) This may be the worst PP ep ever.  All it is is PP, a caveman, and dinosaurs competing over a bone.
A Fly in the Pink:  (Voices=V) A fruitfly is on the loose.

Pink Blue Plate:  PP helps an overworked fry cook.
Pink Tuba-dore: (LT) PP is bothered by a tuba player and the dog keeps being blamed for PP's schemes (again).
Pink Pranks:  PP takes a plane to Rome but winds up in Nome (Alaska) and helps a friendly seal avoid a seal pelt hunter.
The Pink Flea:  PP tries to get rid of a flea and resorts to shaving himself.
Psst Pink:  PP chases a runaway tire.
Gong with the Pink:  (LT) PP is a waiter at Gong Ho Restaurant and bangs the gong for orders which is next door to a glass shop.  Full of Asian stereotypes.  Definitely not PC!
Pink-In: (V) PP reads an old pal's letter and reminisces.  This is a flashback ep with clips from Pink Package Plot, Pink Pajamas, and Pickled Pink.  Weak.
Pink 8-Ball:  PP chases a runaway basketball.
Pink Aye:  (LT) PP is a stowaway on the Luxitania (yes, that's the name)  and becomes an opera singer's stole.  It has a weak ending with the old lounge chair gag.

Trail of the Lonesome Pink:  (LT) PP defends furry critters from two French fur trappers.
Pink Da Vinci:  PP keeps changing the mouth of the Mona Lisa.
Pink Streaker:  PP makes life miserable for a fellow skier.
Salmon Pink/Pink Elephant:  These two eps have the same premise.  PP feeds an animal (fish and elephant) and each winds up his pet.  The writers must have been running out of ideas.
Forty Pink Winks:  PP can't find a place to sleep.
Pink Plasma:  PP encounters a vampire.
Keep Our Forests Pink:  PP is a forest ranger whose quest is to stop a camper who keeps breaking the law.
Bobolink Pink: PP helps a little bird learn to fly.",1143072000,28,3498,4.3753894080996885

FYI: if you are a PP fan and remember the PP half hour show that had two PP episodes with an episode of THE AND AND THE AARDVARK, or an episode of THE INSPECTOR sandwiched in between the PP episodes, then you may be interested in PP Classics  Vol  V  and Vol VI. these two volumes are dedicated to these two sidebar cartoons in a single volume dedicated to the one cartoon each per volume. Volume V has 17 episodes of the ANT AND AARDVARK.  Volume VI  has 17 episodes of the INSPECTOR.

My children and I try to explain the cartoons but they just don't get it. I ordered the Pink Panther Series, 3 of them, so we could all have a copy. Now, my grandchildren and my children along with myself all what and then talk about the cartoons and have great fun and big laughs. I would rather see them watch pink panther than some of the God Awful cartoon, or at least what they call cartoons, that are on tv today. TALK ABOUT VIOLENCE!!!

2315764,4,B0009S4J50,"This collection of Pink Panther cartoons which delighted theater audiences many years ago.  These cover the years from 1968 to 1975.  The first half-dozen or so marked the end of the first ""period"" of these cartoons. Then, after a three-year hiatus, they were brought back.  Many of the ""newer"" ones had the same trademark gags but a few had some new angles.

All of them here range from good-to-excellent, except the ones with the laugh track. Those are lame, but with 27 individual cartoons, you get a lot of good stuff certainly enough to warrant the purchase of this DVD.",1250380800,,575,4.72

2315766,4,B0009S4J50,"When you think about it, the Pink Panther cartoons are a precursor to Wall-E.  Everything is done in mime.  I really like how much of the humor is NOT generated from cruelty.  For example, in ""Salmon Pink""
the Pink Panther befriends and makes a pet of a fish. There's gentle humor in how the Panther is trapped by his own compassion.

In most of these cartoons, the Pink Panther is interacting with a comic little human, who is mostly nose and hat.  ""Pink Tuba-Dore"" and ""Pink Da Vinci"" are excellent examples where the Panther torments this annoying little human.

I was struck by the differing artistic styles of the backgrounds. Each is individual in line and coloring.  These cartoons are a notch above the other TV cartoons of this period. This is a great piece for a collector and excellent for kids of any age.",1218240000,5,817,4.593103448275862
2315767,5,B0009S4J50,"I hadn't seen Pink Panther since I was a kid.  Of all places to see Pink Panther again, was on our trip to Mexico.  Of course all the cartoons were in spanish, but when they saw Pink Panther... They loved it!  They could understand him perfectly because there really is little to no talking at all in Pink Panther cartoons.  Perfect if you don't understand the language!  As soon as we got home we bought the DVD's.  Also my oldest son was a late talker and now will narrate to his younger brother everything he thinks Pink Panther would be saying.  It's great to hear him build his vocabulary.",1188604800,,594,4.394495412844036
