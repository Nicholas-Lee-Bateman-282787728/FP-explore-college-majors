However, I wanted to loop the DVD, and apparently this disc wasn't recorded in a manner that allows auto repeat.",1417737600,,282,4.66

7906271,2,B00000F0YP,"While this cartoon is animated, it really feels more like the reading of a book than an actual cartoon. This is due largely to the fact that there is only one actor doing all the voices and the narration, and very little distinction is given to the different character's voices. The story is sweet enough- Santa is out delivering presents and a little boy named Sam sneaks on the sleigh. Santa then decided to take him to a Christmas Eve party at the North Pole before he delivers him home. Sam is introduced to various elves and they eat and exchange gifts. Santa realizes that Sam't gift is at home but wants to give him something while he is at the North Pole, so he gives him his pocket watch, which plays music. The elves sing ""We Wish You a Merry Christmas"" (with multiple verses), Sam gets sleepy, and then wakes up in his living room, where he pulls the watch out of his pocket. The whole cartoon moves very slow (with large portions dedicated to specifically stating what the characters eat at the party and what their presents are.) It is not something I would watch again, and it is most definiteky not a classic Christmas cartoon that needs added to my collection. It gets 2 stars instead of 1 because the animation is fun (especially given that this was 1980) and because I was amused that the gift one of the elves recieved was specifically mentioned as ""Elton John glasses, he has very nice specs.""",1351209600,,1413,4.501945525291829
7906272,5,B00000F0YP,"Great little Christmas cartoon! I am glad that it is being sold here! I  watch it once every Christmas with my mom. It is about this little boy that  sneaks into Santa's sleigh in the middle of the night, and ends up in the  north pole. He parties with Santa and his elves till midnight, and at the  end of the party, everyone recieves a special gift from Santa. When Old St.  Nick realizes that he has forgotten the small boy, he gives him his pocket  watch. It is a joy to watch! Buy it, and put it in your movie collection!",965260800,2,526,4.107843137254902
