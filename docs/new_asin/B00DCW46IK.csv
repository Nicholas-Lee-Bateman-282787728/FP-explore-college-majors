8592031,5,B00DCW46IK,I have been a fan of Pats nes reviews for quite some time. He is a YouTube star and has appeared on Pawn Stars. His reviews are hilarious and very well made. He owns pretty much every nes game and has tons of knowledge in his well done hair. Buy this DVD!,1377648000,,255,3.923076923076923
8592032,5,B00DCW46IK,"Pat is just like any Nintendo fan that grew up in the 80's with the NES collecing awesome nitendo collectibles filed with nostalgia, the only difference is that Pat has a talking Rob the Robot that at times could funnier then Pat himself.
In each and every episode you will see Pat become more creative and imaginative with the games he plays, he would make an atmosphere that helps distinguish the game (like in the Halloween episodes).
For the mothers out there looking to buy this dvd for their children, Pat doesn't really curse that much rather than a familiar youtuber ehem cough *avgn*
Pat the nes punk has this type of episodic approach to his videos sort of like chapters, where some episodes would be followed up to each other.
all in all pat the nes punk dvd is a good buy, and a good time",1377302400,2,800,4.448979591836735
8592033,5,B00DCW46IK,"If you are an 80's kid and grew up playing video games you'll love Pat's nostalgic and hilarious trips down memory lane in this 2 volume DVD set.  You can grab this set for $20 off Amazon now, or try to find it years from now at a markup, perhaps at some slummy flea market or swap meet... the choice is yours.",1377302400,,310,4.0
