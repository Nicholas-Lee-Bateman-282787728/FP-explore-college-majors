7992294,1,B00009PBYH,One of the worst. If I were an actor in this movie then I would make sure it is not listed on my resume.,1480809600,,104,3.375
7992295,5,B00009PBYH,loved it and a must to rent or download if you are lucky enough to find it! The cast is great!,1366502400,,94,3.5238095238095237
7992296,1,B00009PBYH,"I'm a fan of both Adrian Paul and Michael Biehn, and even I couldn't sit through this entire movie.  Maybe if they'd stayed focused on their characters and not stuck a B-rate ""G.I. Jane"" rip off into the middle, it might have been better.",1195344000,,238,4.409090909090909
7992297,3,B00009PBYH,"I purchased this video due to Adrian Paul's presence in the cast.  Paul is one of my favorite actors and, in my opinion, one of the most attractive men on the screen today.  This 1997 outing is definitely not for kids -- there is a great deal of violence.  I won't give away plot points, but I did find some of the scenarios highly improbable. I would recommend this as a novelty to any fan of Adrian Paul, but that's about as far as it goes.",995760000,9,442,4.116279069767442
7992298,5,B00009PBYH,"Lots of fun, lots of action.  The title doesn't make much sense, but if you like military action stuff, you'll like this movie!",964656000,6,127,4.521739130434782
7992299,2,B00009PBYH,"Ok, so I'm a Biehn fan.  His talents were totally wasted on this movie.  Only die-hard Adrian Paul and Biehn fans will appreciate this movie, and that's just because so few of their movies make it to meaningful/wide  release.  I'm a feminist, too, but the plot of a practically entirely  female platoon behind enemy lines to disarm a No. Koren nuclear facility is  too much.",950745600,8,374,4.676923076923077
7992300,4,B00009PBYH,good movie with a couple of slow spots and  a few surprises along the way. the character mihael beihn played is good along with adrian paul.,926985600,2,140,4.384615384615385
