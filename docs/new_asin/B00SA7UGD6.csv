8697910,5,B00SA7UGD6,"Great Restoration!.Lot's of features. The short film(Himorogi) is a treat as it keeps morphing while it plays as well as the music,making me wish it were longer. Then it would not be a ""short"" would it?.Nice interview with Marina(wish it was on camera)but still nice to hear her voice!!!.Also nice interview with Alessio explaing the short film. Not sure why it's a Two-Disc set,as the DVD is identical to the blu-ray. A ""portable"" copy to take on a road trip. Speaking of ""Trips"",enter the world of Walerian Borowczyk and you've been transformed.
p.s. Marina Pierro is so photogenic,absolutely beautiful on film.",1487548800,,613,5.079207920792079

Another lost film recently unearthed by Arrow Films, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Miss Osbourne (aka Docteur Jekyll et les femmes) is, as the title states, strange. I was unfamiliar with the film before reading about its new release, however I was familiar with director Walerian Borowczyk, probably best known for his films The Beast and Immoral Women. I had watched one of his films, Behind Convent Walls, about five years ago (on September 23rd, 2010 to be pointlessly exact) and based on that film's strange blend of artful sleaze, I knew what I was getting into.

The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Miss Osbourne (damn that's a long title) stars Udo Kier (who I love) as Dr. Henry Jekyll. Jekyll is having a get together announcing his engagement to Miss Fanny Osbourne (the lovely Marina Pierro). Some of the guests include a General, his daughter, a fellow doctor (Jess Franco's buddy Howard Vernon) and a reverend. Shortly after the guests arrive, they start getting knocked off one by one, though not by ordinary means. The inhuman killer seems to have a giant pointed wang which he uses to penetrate his victims to death with. Ouch! I'm sure you can guess who the killer is by the title of the film...or can you?

This film (I'm NOT going to type that title again!), is not only strange, but it's warped. Really warped. The use of classical music confuses your expectations, as do the beautiful settings (Borowczyk did the set designs too) and the hazy, period camerawork. But don't let this fool you, this film has plenty of perverse scenes and characters. The killer's (as described above) appearance is startling and Jekyll's transformation into Mr. Hyde sends him into an almost orgasmic frenzy. I'll admit, there are some slow parts in this film, but I never found my mind wandering or my ass squirming in my seat (well, maybe in a couple key scenes...but not out of boredom). Arrow's release is pretty amazing, in both quality and quantity. The transfer used for this release is stunning and clear. And the bonus features? Boy do we have bonus features here. Interviews, commentaries, short films and even a booklet! Overall, not a perfect film but definitely an oddity that lovers of avant garde and sleazy films should seek out. Below are a list of the bonus features included in Arrow's Blu Ray/DVD combo:

8697913,1,B00SA7UGD6,"I happened to encounter this film as a borrow from my local library, so I came to it blank slate. I'm a fan of Euro cinema, so I had some hope of a good time. Let's just say, if you are so foolish as to waste your precious time watching this, you only have yourself to blame. Where to begin...? Oh never mind. OK, a few things; actors are terrible, direction is terrible, soundtrack is terrible, screenplay is terrible, cinematography is terrible. Possibly substitute laughable for terrible. Oops, direction is terrible too; the director seems most interested in getting the clothes off the girls; don't get me wrong, as a guy that's fun, but this is a real stinker. My wife says, it was creepy too.",1441065600,,699,4.555555555555555
8697914,2,B00SA7UGD6,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

I have to admit something up front. Ive never been a big fan of Euro-stylized films that seem more interested in just that as opposed to telling a story. Certainly there have been exceptions to the rule but I honestly cant name one off the top of my head. I just felt I had to make the point before saying that for me this film wasn't the be all to end all that Michael Brooke makes it out to be for me. Im happy that for him this release in this form met his expectations and delight. For me, not so much.

While most of us are already well aware of the classic novel on which this movie is based, it gets a different treatment here than what has come in the past. The film opens impressively with an eerie blue tone as a young child runs through the streets to avoid a well clad gentleman chasing her. He eventually catches up and brutally beats her within an inch of her life. Then we quickly shoot off to the home of Dr. Jekyll where he and his soon bride to be are in a romantic embrace trying to still their lust since they're about to host a party concerning their upcoming wedding.

Guests begin to arrive and conversation begins. Along the way word of the child found outside comes up and concerns are discussed that dwell off as new conversation topics arise. As the evening progresses different guests begin to be attacked by someone in the house. The fact that no one notices each time this happens Jekyll is nowhere to be found says a lot about said guests. That these attacks can happen in a house that isn't near mansion status confounded me. Yes, I know you should suspend belief in a movie but between the size of the house and the behavior of the guests I felt like the deaths of these people was a way of thinning the herd.

The passing of each guests is discovered and discussed and the weapon of destruction is apparently a long, curved penis with a point on the end, shown at one point as one of the guests allows herself to be used by Mr. Hyde as a way of getting back at her father who is tied up and forced to watch. And not to worry, Hyde is an equal opportunity provider as he later kills a man in the same fashion.

The twist in the story here, along with the way Hyde is killing the guests of his alter ego, is that his wife to be has no problem with most of it. When she discovers what her husband to be has been doing, she joins in by dousing herself in the same manner he has been and becomes a female version of sorts to his Mr. Hyde. A second twists from most films of this topic has a different actor playing Hyde rather than a single actor in make up as has been done in the past.

But as this story unfolds it isn't the tale at all that has had people talking about this production. Instead the talk focuses on the cinematography and use of light and soft focus that has fans clamoring to watch the movie. Its the small amount of naked flesh that titillates and thrills pre-teen males enough to have made them rent this movie years in the past. Its all under the guise of art film as opposed to exploitation with discussions of the films director, Walerian Borowczyk, and his earlier works involving stop motion animated pieces and short art films prior to this release.

Included in the extras are two of those short films as well as a lengthy discussion of Borowczyk and his works from a producer for this DVD and long-time fan I mentioned earlier, Michael Brooke. While the information Brooke provides is interesting his delivery is very monotone and his enthusiasm doesnt quite come through. Several other interviews are included as well making this the typical Arrow Video release, in other words a fantastically rendered version of the film itself accompanied by what could arguably be said to be the best collection of extras found in DVD releases today.

Some may thoroughly enjoy this movie and I don't want to have you walking away thinking this is the worst piece of film ever made. I have little doubt that fans of this genre will walk away scratching their head wondering why it was I didn't enjoy it as much as they did, thus my disclaimer at the start. For me Im not likely to revisit this film in the future and sitting through it once was more than enough for me. For others I suppose repeat viewings are in store as I am sure they are for Mr. Brooke. In the end it all depends on your own personal taste. For most this won't be your cup of tea.",1438300800,,4455,4.295238095238095
8697915,5,B00SA7UGD6,"A superb Arrow video release of one of Borowczyk's best films, loaded with bonus features and impressive packaging. Heartily recommended.",1437091200,3,137,5.9
8697916,5,B00SA7UGD6,"Arrow Films haven't just released the most important Blu-ray/DVD of the year, they have delivered the art world one of its great lost treasures in a version that is jaw dropping in its execution and presentation.  This exhaustive special edition disc that now houses Borowczyk's once lost film is absolutely stunning and film lovers everywhere owe a sincere thank you to its chief creator Daniel Bird and his entire team, including co-producer Michael Brooke.  Arriving on disc with pristine picture quality and sound,  The Strange Case Of Dr Jekyll And Miss Osbourne can finally be seen as Borowczyk originally intended.  Watching this version was an absolute revelation to me and, while I hate to use this cliche, it really was like seeing it for the first time.
The Strange Case Of Dr Jekyll And Miss Osbourne has been granted a Criterion Collection style release and contains a number of absolutely essential bonus features, most of which were created by Daniel Bird.  First up, the disc has an engrossing and fascinating commentary track made up of a 1981 archival discussion with Borowczyk and new interviews with cinematographer Noel Very, editor Khadicha Bariha, assistant Michael Levy and filmmaker Noel Simsolo.  Expertly put together by Bird, this is one of the most rewarding commentary tracks I have heard in ages.
Two short films can be found on Arrow's disc including a newly discovered Borowczyk animated work called Happy Toy, a charming and surprising film from 1979.  Also on hand is the startling Himorogi, a 16 minute 2012 homage to Borowczyk by his greatest muse Marina Pierro and Alessio Pierro.
A number of interviews are included on this special edition as well including a touching chat with Udo Kier and a thought-provoking talk with the fiercely intelligent and intense Pierro (who appears off-camera).  We are also treated to a discussion with Alessia Pierro on Himorogi and the charming collaborator Sarah Mallinson.
Rounding out the superlative extras on The Strange Case Of Dr Jekyll And Miss Osbourne are a number of featurettes including a terrific 30 minute introduction to Borowczyk, which is both wonderfully informative and personal, by the disc's co-producer Michael Brooke.  An insightful video essay on Borowczyk by Adrian Martin and Cristina Alvarez Lopez entitled Phantasmagoria of the Interior follows as well as two terrific Daniel Bird works, Eyes That Listen (a profile of the daring composer Bernard Parmegiani) and Return To Melies:  Borowczyk and Early Cinema (an ingenious look at how silent cinema helped shape Borowczyk and especially The Strange Case Of Dr Jekyll And Miss Osbourne).  The theatrical trailer and a long booklet is also included.
Arrow's special edition The Strange Case Of Dr Jekyll And Miss Osbourne is not only an absolutely essential purchase for Borowczyk fans but also for art and cinema lovers in general.  The Strange Case Of Dr Jekyll And Miss Osbourne is one of the most important films of the past fifty years and with Arrow's Blu-ray/DVD combo it has finally been given the proper release and respect it has been deserving of for such a very long time.",1431907200,22,3133,5.085769980506822
8697917,4,B00SA7UGD6,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

When it comes to surreal and bizarre films, they just don't get much more so than THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MISS OSBOURNE.  Id never heard of this film prior to getting the press release, but its a cult classic from what I understand.  Granted, it will not appeal to everyonebut if you're in the mood for something trippy, that will both shock and entertain you, then this is the film to see.

Cinema is full of interpretations and adaptations of Robert Louis Stevensons dark classic, however I will wager youve never seen one like this.  On the other hand, fans of director Walerian Borowczyk will quickly recognize his distinct style and themes.

THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MISS OSBOURNE is shot well and visually resembles a fever-dream of epic proportions.  The picture purposely has a slight haze around the edges in some scenes, which gives the viewer the feeling of watching a dream.  This is a clever way of creating atmosphere for the film, and it forces the audience to engage with the story.

The acting is very good, with Udo Kier playing the lead and Marina Pierro portraying his fianc.  The pair have a natural chemistry onscreen, which makes the occasion being celebrated in the film more believable.  Likewise, Gerard Zalcberg does an amazing (albeit disturbing) job as Mr. Hyde; I had no problem believing he was the sexually-voracious alter-ego of Kiers Jekyll.

But the story and the bizarre things that occur around it are the big winners here.  So much is going on within the house, its sometimes difficult to take it all in.  One of my particular favorite pieces of weirdness occurs when the General looks out the window to try and track down the elusive Mr. Hyde, but winds up shooting the carriage driver by accident.  The General turns to the coachs owner and simply says, Misfortune follows misfortune. Madame, I have murdered your chauffeur. My humblest apologies.  He then moves on like nothing ever happened!  This type of craziness is aloof throughout the film, and it makes for a very interesting 90 minutes.

Although its not traditional horror, THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MISS OSBOURNE is still a big win for me.  I plan on watching it again soon, simply to see if I missed anything.",1431907200,7,2314,4.711442786069652
