4985635,4,B006G1QDR6,"""Amador"" (2010 release from Spain; 112 min.) brings the story of Marcela, who is having a hard time making ends meet. Her husband Nelson sells ""second hand"" flowers and wants to buy a new fridge for storage purposes. He encourages Marcela to find a side job, which she does: taking care of an old man (Amador), whose daughter (and her husband) are preoccupied building a seaside resort. Marcela and the old man try to find a way to get along. Meanwhile, Marcela also finds out that she is pregnant. Then, about 45 min. into the movie, there is a major event. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is an outstanding and powerful emotional drama, showcasing Marcela's bleak existence and commensurate desperation. There are also a number of moral undercurrents in the movie, but to say much more would spoil fome of the plot, so I won't say more. Second, the performance of Magaly Solier  will absolutely blow you away. At one point in the movie, she reads a letter written by the old man, just watch that scene as she is overcome with emotion, and along the way we are too. Wow. Third, kudos to Spanish writer-director Fernando Len de Aranoa, who brings us the story with an astonishing attention to details, both in the story and in the direction.

This movie was released in 2012 by Film Movement as part of their on-going releases of foreign and indie films. As usual, the DVD comes with a bonus shortie, and this time it's a gem: ""How It Ended"" (2011 from the USA; 18 min.), starring Debra Winger. I'm not going to spoil anything, just watch! Meanwhile, ""Amador"" is a very worthy addition to Film Movement's library, and is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1398988800,,1754,4.651612903225806
4985636,5,B006G1QDR6,"Una trama sorprendente, que siguiendo las inquietudes y preocupaciones cotidianas de la gente, consigue llevarlas a una trama interesante con una narrativa bastante fluida. Llega escenas muy cmicas sobre situaciones serias, sin perder por eso la gravedad del caso. Vale la pena verla.",1390867200,2,284,5.627906976744186
4985637,5,B006G1QDR6,"This movie is what you least expect, I was blown away by the ending of the movie. It is a very well thought out plot that leaves more room for interpretation than most people would expect. It is also perfect for the classroom, if we want to develop critical thinking skills in our students than this movie will give you a head start. Love, work, life, survival and cheats. It has a little something for everyone! Get it, if you can!",1354233600,5,432,4.345679012345679
4985638,5,B006G1QDR6,"This 2010 film from Spain will not be for those who enjoy the thrill and excitement of faster paced movies with more action.  It is a quiet, low-key, slow-paced film with metaphors, symbolism, and wisdom.  It is also about the circle of new life and death.

A young woman, Marcela arrived in Spain and lives with her boyfriend in a shoddy one-room apartment.  Marcela is a few weeks pregnant.  Nelson, her boyfriend runs a ""recycled"" flower shop out of the home.  The flowers, of which we know of,  are stolen from a trash bin, and rejuvenated, kept in the refrigerator, separated and repackaged, aerosol sprayed and re-sold.

When the refrigerator that houses the flowers breaks down, Marcela must locate  a job to pay for the installments.  She becomes caregiver for an old man who knows his time is up soon.  He spends time in bed completing a large puzzle of the sea.  He shares with Marcela his metaphor of how life is like a puzzle....and how we are given the pieces,  but it is we who are responsible of putting the pieces together.

Then, the old man dies, and Marcela, desperately needing the income, does the unthinkable..... not reporting the death and keeping the body on the bed.

The one person who learns of his death and the charade is the aging hooker who makes a weekly visit to service the old man.  The hooker and Marcela keep the secret going while befriending one another.

As I mentioned earlier,  the symbolism reveals itself in the flowers which are classified as dead at one time, then revived, freshened up, aerosol sprayed to smell like flowers.  In turn, the man's body is dead, freshened up, smell erased by aerosol spray.

We don't arrive with all the answers to the storyline, but we have enough to be satisfied that the film is very good!  In this film, you also see how a circle of dependency plays its role on our lives.

Surprisingly, I realized that the actress Megaly Solier, who plays Marcela was the starring role in the Best foreign Film nominee, 2009 for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Milk-of-Sorrow/dp/B00432M43C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Milk of Sorrow</a>, which I deemed a rather strange but good film also.

If you are new to Foreign Film, I suggest following the Film Movement movies that are brought to us via the distribution of award winning and foreign film movies.  Often, there are meaningful discussion guides.  I have seen many on their list, quality filming, quality directing, quality acting.  See this one, by director Fernando Len de Aranoa

4985639,5,B006G1QDR6,"Set in contemporary Spain, Amador embodies the best of a Ken Loach social drama. With a sprinkle of irony, the film gives a realistic and fine portrait of Marcela, (anti)-heroin shaken in her faith but determined to serve her best interests. The sincerity and simplicity of this story, combined to the solid performance of Solier and the stunning conclusion of this black comedy are good enough reasons to see Amador!",1335916800,7,417,4.9714285714285715

4985643,4,B006G1QDR6,"This IS a very good movie from Spain with English subtitles. Very good reviews have already been written here on Amazon that I only read AFTER I saw the Free-on-Amazon-Prime film. I'm always looking for good free movies for payback on my membership. This is on of them. It is slow but it moves along and it gives you a glimpse of the migrant situation in Spain and the people just trying to make a living in their hopes/dreams for a better life.

Look for the answer of the existence of mermaids.

4985647,4,B006G1QDR6,You have to like foreign films to appreciate this as a 4 star. It can be slow and drawn out but the real ending will be a surprise. Character lacks charisma and can see annoying but does have some introspection and at the end takes steps needed to mend her life. She finds out that there can be a soulmate and that if there are words needed to be said before death or parting then there is a real worthwhile relationship.,1466640000,2,421,4.209876543209877

Ironic that the old man (introspective and wise)  knows she is pregnant but the self obsessed boyfriend has no clue, when they talk about the future and he says they may have children in a few years. this while she is 3 months pregnant sitting across the table, she wants to tell him but can't. it seems by the middle of the movie, he is the only one who doesn't know she is pregnant. ""what will you name him"" is the question she is asked by all who know.

4985669,3,B006G1QDR6,"I enjoyed the movie; it was between a 3 and 4 star movie. In real life if the main female character was me ... no matter how poor I might be, I do not think that I would for one second pretend that my (dead) client was still alive.
  Ironically, once the employers (the dead man's adult daughter) discovered that their father was indeed already dead, ... they told the maid/caregiver to continue ""pretending"" that the old man was still alive and instructed to pick up the mail, clean the apt., etc.
  Anyway, as strange as the story premise was to me, I rolled with it and actually enjoyed the movie. But, inside, also thanked the Lord that I was born in America, and knowing that ... I could aspire to be as rich or as poor as my personal self motivated me to be.",1435276800,,764,4.248275862068965

8497289,5,B006G1QDR6,"The movie focuses on Marcela, a poor Peruvian immigrant worker in Madrid. Magaly Solier plays this role perfectly, and it would be worth watching if only because of her. Before long I was wondering ""how can she be so stupid"" and was tempted to turn it off. But the story cleverly weaves into several directions, by turns humorous, touching, sad and thought provoking.
