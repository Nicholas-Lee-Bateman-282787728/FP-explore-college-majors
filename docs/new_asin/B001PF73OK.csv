3747223,3,B001PF73OK,I was interested in the blue hole as a geographic feture so it wasn't quite what I was looking for.  But anyone interested in diving would probably enjoy it.  No suprise since they were the target audience.,1426723200,,206,4.54054054054054

3747225,3,B001PF73OK,Some of the video images were great to look at. The production of the video itself leaves a lot to be desired. Kind of amateurish.,1413763200,,130,4.24
3747226,4,B001PF73OK,its obviously amateur video since its a travel vid. but still amazing shots and tour recommendations. I loved it and now I would love to travel there,1402704000,,149,4.555555555555555
3747227,1,B001PF73OK,"Poor; volume goes in and out
Does not come close in describing the true visual there
Waste of time to watch",1398124800,,107,4.142857142857143
3747228,5,B001PF73OK,I'm always interested in finding new adventures in Belize even though I don't dive  I do love visiting the keys.,1394841600,,112,4.6
3747229,3,B001PF73OK,"Picture quality was not too awesome when viewed through my HD Roku. Other shows have had better quality so I can eliminate the Roku.
It is a short film and gives some highlights of Belize, I just was looking more for a diving video rather than a travel video.",1389571200,,259,4.3061224489795915
3747230,4,B001PF73OK,"I purchased this DVD because my husband and I are planning a trip to Ambergris Caye, Belize.  It is basically an introductory travel video, which is fine if that is what you are looking for.  We did enjoy it and found it helpful.",1295654400,,229,4.3023255813953485
8333191,4,B001PF73OK,It's a desent travel video for those who thinking to vizit Belize.,1493251200,,66,4.583333333333333

8333193,3,B001PF73OK,For a dive travel video too much time was spent on inland tourism. It could use better narration.,1457827200,,97,4.444444444444445
8333194,1,B001PF73OK,Many beautiful scenes but plays like an infomercial.,1453852800,,52,5.625
8333195,3,B001PF73OK,"Diving footage is great.  The local videography seemed a bit unprofessional/immature.  Interrupting dialogue to shout to locals or ""new friends"" was a bit much.  Overall, it gave me a flavor for the island.  I wouldn't recommend unless you are traveling there.",1451433600,,260,5.2682926829268295
8333196,1,B001PF73OK,"Poor quality, Spoty sound. Take a pass.",1451001600,,39,4.714285714285714
8333197,5,B001PF73OK,"THE SOUNDTRACK IS AMAZING! Start the bath, grab a drink -  put on the video - and relax to the soothing sounds of flute solos.",1446768000,,126,4.04
8333198,2,B001PF73OK,"Only a few minutes on diving.  And the video quality underwater is marginal at best. The color quality is about what you would expect on a go pro with no red filter.

I have wanted to dive the blue hole, but with maybe a minute and a half or so dedicated to that portion of Belize I felt this was a waste.  Google answers before watching this.

They showed me nothing that would make a belize dive better than a roatan dive.  In fact all the same species.

For bang for the buck, I would avoid Belize and do Roatan.  I use Native Sons because I like their staff, lodgings and food. There are many to choose from.",1443916800,,612,4.135593220338983
8333199,2,B001PF73OK,"A few nuggets spread throughout, but I would say it was slightly better than what I could do myself.  The diving at the end was the pay-off for me.  If you're going there soon, it might be worth your time.",1436745600,,205,4.1
8333200,3,B001PF73OK,Low budget production,1432944000,,21,6.333333333333333
