8089834,4,B000BO0LNQ,"I love watching films that I know nothing about, most of the time I am really pleased with them, and this was no exception.  Robert Urich turns in a lovely performance as a man who has just turned 50 and feels like he missed something in his life.  Meridith Baxter plays his wife, who is trying to figure out her husband's midlife crisis and still keep her struggling school going.
A predictable ending, but always a performance you can count on from Urich.",1233619200,5,457,4.493975903614458
