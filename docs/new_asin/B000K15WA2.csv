2681599,5,B000K15WA2,"This by far was one of the greatest documentaries I've ever seen on the Holocaust. I liked the first hand point of view camera work as well as the first hand discussions of people who lived through the Holocaust. Gallant men such as Jack Rubin and Marian Marzynski paint a chilling portrait of what went on in Poland during the war. Such savagery, it makes me sick to my stomach.

I taped this from cable in 1996 and have randomly seen it ever since. The last two times being 2004 and 2007. Each time I view it I gain a new perspective and as the great Nathan Kaplan said: ""Sometimes in life events awaken us to new perceptions of ourselves."" Never was a quote more poignant to a production.

The statistics are horrific; 85% of Jews had their roots in Poland before WWII. Out of 1500 Jews who resided in Bransk only 29 survived after the war. Despite what some pseudo-deniers say, these stats cannot be denied. Too, those who collaborated with the Nazis although few, were able to use their clout to exact terrible vengence on those Jews whom they had secretly and openly despised. This is the legacy of the Holocaust in Poland. No, not all Polish people were responsible for the deaths of Jews, but those few who were responsible did great damage to those who, under extremely trying circumstances, clung to their tenuous existence.

Buy this great DVD. Save for Shoah, there are few documentaries that are as striking and touching as this one is.

2681600,1,B000K15WA2,This program is very long -- three hours.  Mostly it consists of interviews with very little visual support.  After about an hour we could not continue watching from the tedium.  What might have been a reasonable 1 hour program became a tedious production that did not support its premise.,1322784000,4,289,4.857142857142857
2681601,2,B000K15WA2,"Marian Marzynski has produced a long and tedious film that not only exhibits a pronounced Polonophobic slant, but fails to inform the viewer about the proper context of the tragic events that took place. A much better and objective source of information about Shtetl life, in my opinion, is the book SHTETL, by Eva Hoffman.

The content of Marzynski's film is so strongly Judeocentric that the viewer is almost made to think that nothing happened during WWII except the destruction of Jews. The viewer gets no hint of the fact that Poland, which had fallen to the Nazi German and the Soviet Communist aggression, was to suffer the loss of 3 million gentile lives in the hands of the Germans alone. Not a word is mentioned about the large number of Poles (and also some Jews) who had been deported from the Bransk area to horrible deaths in the Soviet gulags, partly the outcome of the large-scale collaboration of local Jews with the Soviets.

Marzynski presents other content in a tendentious manner. For instance, a scene depicts anti-Jewish prejudices in the form of a Polish peasant who supposes that Jews have lots of money. No context is provided. The viewer gets no idea of the economic disparities that had arisen between Poles and Jews, partly the result of centuries of a cozy relationship between Jewish merchants and the foreign rulers of Poland after the Partitions. And, of course, no mention is made of the fact that many Jews had equally distorted (not to mention also negative) views of Poles as that Polish peasant had of Jews.

Marian Marzynski pays a great deal of attention to a small group of Poles who collaborated with the German Nazis against Jews. This completely ignores the fact that Poland had a much lower collaboration rate than most other European countries. Moreover, it ignores the sad fact that the biggest assistants to the Germans in the roundup and sending of Jews to their deaths were none other than the Jewish collaborators-especially the notorious Judenrats and the Jewish Ghetto Police.

Marzynski presents a scene involving modern Israeli students. Judging by their questions and the tone and content of their anti-Polish accusations, one is struck by their frightful ignorance of basic historical facts. Not only do they have no idea of what Poles went through: They almost seem to think that Poles lived in freedom and prosperity during German rule. The tenor of Marzynski's scene involving Israeli students is corroborated by the kind of questions asked of Poles by visiting Israeli high school students (e. g., ""What kind of pensions are those Polish guards of Auschwitz getting?""). The informed viewer cannot help but ask questions such as the following: ""Who is teaching Israeli children such venomous bigotry against Poles?"" ""Denial of the Holocaust is not tolerated, so why are such Polonophobic prejudices tolerated?"" ""What kind of portent do the warped attitudes exhibited by Marzynski's sample of Jewish students have for present and future Polish-Jewish relations?""",1319414400,16,3021,5.0602409638554215

8153877,3,B000K15WA2,"I watched ""Shtetl"" last night.  I personally believe that only by teaching other generations about the horrible atrocities conducted during World War II can we prevent this from ever happening again.  That said, unfortunately, I found the documentary, ""Shtetl,"" the story of the search of one man for his roots in the small town of Bransk in Poland, long and, more regrettable, boring.

The other negative reviews focused more on what they perceived as the anti-Jewish / pro-German bent of the movie.  I wonder if the documentary had been created within a few years of World War II if the residents of Bransk would have been more honest when asked, ""what did you think of the Jews?""  ""Do you know anyone who turned in Jews who were hiding?""  It's easy for us to say we could have had the unbelievable courage to do the right thing and help someone hide from persecution even though it could mean your death or the death of your family.

The quick statistics I found on-line were from 1914.  There were 4,301 residents in Bransk.  Of those, 1,500 were Jews; almost 35% percent.  Out of all the remaining residents, only 14 (yes, fourteen) did the right, heroic thing and assisted their friends and neighbors.  (14 non-Jewish residents of Bransk are noted as Righteous Among the Nations.)  So I find it extremely unlikely that the few people they interviewed that were alive and young adults during WW2 are some of the 14 heroes.  I admit that this was one of the better parts of the story; watching the elderly residents of Bransk scramble to explain that they left bread for their ""friends.""  They weren't responsible for turning in a family - they loved their Jewish neighbors.

This is not a critique on whether or not the Holocaust was horrible (words cannot describe).  Nor is it a commentary on whether or not the surviving residents of WW2 from Bransk are probably so ""full of it"" that their eyes are brown (they are, in my humble opinion).  Rather, it's my opinion that this was the bad execution of a story that could have been presented to properly relate the lives of the 1500 Jews in Bransk in such a way as to be riveting.",1362009600,6,2134,4.632978723404255
8153878,1,B000K15WA2,"From Washington Post, ""Sir: Your film Shtetl portrayed Poles as subhuman anti-Semites. Your current film shows Germans in a more favorable light. Given that Germans caused the Holocaust and Poles did not, can you explain the contrast between your desire to rehabilitate Germans (and ""feel safe among them"") and your desire to whip up ethnic hatred toward Poles?

Marian Marzynski: I strongly disagree that I portray Poles as subhuman in my film Shtetl. I think that I presented them with the same degree of humanity that I portrayed Germans with in my last film.""
