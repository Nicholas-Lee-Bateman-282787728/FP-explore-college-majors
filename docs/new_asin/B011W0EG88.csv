8725148,5,B011W0EG88,"Looking for a highly polished, flawlessly executed cinematic masterpiece? Well, keep looking, because this movie is grainy and gray, rough around the edges Portland through and through. Although it's low budget, it goes beyond the typical low budget hodge-podge of starving bad actors waiting for their big break interspersed with serendipitously acquired starving good actors waiting to be discovered tossing lines at each other from a mediocre script in front of a film crew of starving artists who can barely afford their own equipment. This isn't to say that ZCFM doesn't already have all of those things going for (or against) it, but the primary feature of this work of malevolent genius that really separates it from other pitiful attempts at cinematic greatness on a shoestring budget is that it makes no pretenses about itself. This film dispenses with any attempt at greatness and instead wallows in its own mediocrity, to great comedic effect. It's an entirely self aware parody of itself. It knows what it is. It makes a joke out of itself and leaves you laughing out loud. This is a film that would never sell its trench coat, let alone sing an aria about it.

It's obvious that the mad man in charge of this film grew up on a steady diet of MST 3000, and there are definitely influences from terrible movies throughout, with turning points in the plot obviously written as a parodies of the botched execution of so many other genuinely awful films of yesteryear. The result of all this madness is that rare phenomenon of a cheaply made movie that's actually worth watching.

This film is pretty much as advertised. It's a horror movie about Zombie Cats. Those cats are from Mars. You will not be disappointed.",1441497600,2,1723,4.857142857142857
