8137750,3,6300268373,"Meh.  I ordered it for the Mike Oldfield sound track...  but if you're a Mike Oldfield fan, you probably already have all of the music.  The movie itself is a mildly interesting documentary on the space program of the 60's and early 70's.",1438646400,,238,4.488372093023256
8137751,2,6300268373,"Following along with other reviewers - transfer is terrible, sound is terrible, and the random use of Apollo, Gemini, Mercury and other space flight video clips makes no sense whatsoever. This randomness includes audio tracks, too: Case in point. Nixon's introduction to the phone call on the moon is followed by Nixon greeting the returning astronauts (whilst showing the safe return of the Apollo 13 crew)! To me, the worst is implying that the Archibald MacLeish poem ""Riders on Earth Together"" was written after Apollo 11, when in fact it appeared in the NY Times on Christmas Day, 1968 - and was inspired by the TV images of our lonely little planet as seen from Apollo 8. If you find a copy at a yard sale for a buck, otherwise there are many other documentaries that are so much better. Even the dated ""Moonwalk One"" is far superior to this.",1404950400,,848,4.66
8137752,5,6300268373,"This movie is a great piece of history that everyone should own. It was the produced on the 10th anniversery of the Apollo 11 lunar landing. I originally purchased this as a VHS tape and I needed an update. I have watched this movie dozens of times. The photography is fantastic and I love Mike Oldfield's ""Tubular Bells"" (musical backdrop). The 20th anniversery version (For All Mankind) was not nearly as good.",1399852800,,412,4.736111111111111
8137753,5,6300268373,"I have been looking for this movies since I first saw it years ago. It is not HD because hardly
any of the original space stuff was.  There is a long slow motion shot of a Saturn V launch which
is why I've always wanted to get a copy of the the movie.  It's weird to think we were actually going
to the moon back then but did not have HDTV!",1370390400,,340,3.7746478873239435
8137754,3,6300268373,"As a previous reviewer mentioned, surely this is not the film Tony Palmer was lauding in the Directors Interview.
This DVD, although modified to fit modern screen dimensions, delivers a picture and sound track that seems
worse than the original VHS tape that had me so enthralled, sometimes I would watch it back to back. Memorising
every word.
The extended piece of early fly boys seemed ludicrous. It doesn't add to the film at all, and
makes mankinds first attempts to get off the ground appear silly or stupid. Maybe if the early hoppers where done with
no sound at all (as was the technology of the day), the film clips would have been more poignant. (Yeah, no sound!).
As for digital remastering, they must have snuck into my house and grabbed my 10 year old VHS copy of the SM, after having
been played hundreds of times and dropped it straight onto a DVD.
Whats the go? We have the technology. I've seen movies from the 1920's restored better than this.
My rating does not take away from what is an outstanding movie. With a bit of dedication, it could be one of
the must see movies for our relatives, hundreds of years into the future. Come on, you are better than this, do it.",1360281600,,1186,4.49537037037037
8137755,2,6300268373,"Having see this on TV when the program was first shown I was excited to see it available on DVD. The program (since it was originally shown on TV) was stunning and very clear when broadcast. It really does have some segments which are rarely seen even today - especially the multiple angle shots of the Apollo lift off. Quite amazing.

It is very strange because on the cover and in the accompanying director's interview they talk about how this is newly digitally remastered (well at least when it was released back around 2007). The director's interview is very interesting and pretty good DVD quality but the quality of the main film itself is absolutely terrible - very grainy and the sound has a lot of ""wow and flutter"" so the music is distorted. As a previous reviewer noted it really does look like a bad bootleg transfer from VHS. This is what makes it strange. It is obvious from the interview with Tony Palmer that there really is a remastered version somewhere but this is not it and Amazon really should block the sale of it since it is very misleading. Particularly in the light of Neil Armstrong's death the other day, it would be a shame to buy something which should have been a great memorial but which is such a bad one as sold here.",1346025600,,1252,4.491228070175438
8137756,3,6300268373,"It was good to finally get a DVD version of one of my old VHS tapes; however,quality of video is no better than,maybe not even as good,as the old VHS version. DVD is obviously a transfer from VHS,not a digital remastering of the original NASA films.",1264204800,5,249,4.434782608695652
8137757,2,6300268373,"First of all, I want to make it clear that my rating expresses my dissatisfaction with the quality of the DVD and not the movie itself, which is actually quite good. The transfer, while enhanced for 16x9, looks like a straight videotape or laserdisc transfer and not a remastering from original sources. The sound is a complete disaster.  I suspect a lot of people will be buying this for the Mike Oldfield soundtrack, which contains some music not available anywhere else.  It is pitifully reproduced here in low-fi sound quality that does justice to neither the film nor the composer.

For a real ""out of this world"" film experience of the US Space Program, I heartily recommend Al Reinert's ""For All Mankind"".  Yes, it is an expensive DVD, but the picture and sound quality are superb.

I waited a long time for this movie to become available on DVD, and I'm disappointed.  The movie and the music deserved better.  Overall, a missed opportunity.",1181088000,16,949,4.785276073619632
8137758,4,6300268373,"This reviewer, who was 12 at the time of the first moon walk, reacts to this movie in two ways.  First, there's the recollection of the optimistic feelings seen in the movie that everyone felt at the time, contrasted with the current state of manned space flight.  [This review was written during the second stand down of the shuttle.]  And secondly there's the reaction to it as a movie, which follows.
  The movie is a collection of clips from NASA footage, recordings of the radio transmissions, and a few voice overs.  These start roughly with Sputnik, then JFK's call to send a man to the moon before the decade is out, then the Apollo program, and finally an epilogue which includes drop tests of the shuttle ""Enterprise.""
  The background sounds are the radio transmissions from NASA, and a score from Mike Oldfield.  For those familar with his music, I recognize parts from Tubular Bells, Hergest Ridge, Ommadawn, and Incantations.  For an Oldfield fan, the music is nice, for a non-fan (my friends) it can be a bit much.  I  am a fan of both Mr. Oldfield and space flight, and it works fine for me.
  My complaint is that the movie seems to be about the Apollo 11 flight in particular but, if my memory from the time serves, there are unidentified clips from a Mercury/Atlas launch, Gemini/Titan flights, and earlier/later Apollo flights.  One goes from video of the Saturn V being fueled, to the Mercury/Altas, to a Saturn IB and then back to the Saturn V in the space of maybe 30 seconds.  And there are radio transmissions from the infamous lightening strike on Apollo 12 mixed in with radio transmissions that identify Apollo 11.  It is a bit confusing.
  There's an epologue at the end showing early shuttle tests and the voice over describes what has happened from the end of Apollo until 1990, that captures the feeling that with the shuttle we were going to get a manned space station, unmanned probes to the planets, and all sorts of neat stuff.  Some of which happened, and most of which did not.
  I call it a time capsule because of the period film work by the astronauts who were not cameramen, the period animations which come before CGI work by many years, and the period feeling of optimism about space flight in general.
  Don't confuse this with a documentary, as mentioned above it skips back and forth according to the available visual imagery, not historical accuracy.  But if you can put that aside it's fun to watch.  If you want a documentary with a popular leaning, you might try Tom Hanks' ""From the Earth to the Moon,"" or if you are seriously into Apollo footage, try the Spacecraft flims (possibly Fox Entertainment by now) DVD's of the mission footage.  But if you want to capture the feeling of what it was like to live through the excitement of the period, this does it best.
  I give it four stars as a fan of space flight.  Your mileage will vary...",1072051200,3,2891,4.6007827788649704
