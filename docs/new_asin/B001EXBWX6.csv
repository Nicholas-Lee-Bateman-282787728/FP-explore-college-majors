3557697,5,B001EXBWX6,Ian McKellan's Lear is simply THE BEST on film.  He's taken a lifetime to prepare for the role and WE are the beneficiaries of his talent and craft!,1266105600,3,148,4.285714285714286
3557698,5,B001EXBWX6,"Ian McKellen does a wonderful King Lear, Sylvester McCoy is a great fool, I was also quite impressed by the actor who played Kent. Great DVD, totally worth watching if you're collecting Shakespeare like me.",1262822400,2,206,4.914285714285715
3557699,4,B001EXBWX6,"The role of Lear is famously difficult for the many contrary demands it places on the actor, and it must be said at the outset that Ian McKellan acquits himself admirably in this production. Romola Garal's Cordelia and Sylvester McCoy's Fool are also carefully interpreted, as is Jonathan Hyde's Kent. Ben Meyjes' Edgar begins as a nerdy older brother and completes the metamorphosis through Poor Tom the madman to avenging hero in a way that stretches the role: I was left wondering if that initial Edgar would even know how to handle a sword, so in the end there may be some unanswered questions about the character.  Beyond this, pacing and filmic quality are good, despite the inevitable risks in trying to shoot a stage production on film.  McKellan's interview, the only special feature here, is also a ""don't miss""--the great actor meditates on his profession.  The problem is the rest of the cast--an Edmund (Philip Winchester) who couldn't hold a candle to Robert Lindsey's dynamic performance in Olivier's production, a Goneril and Regan (Frances Barber and Monica Dolan) who rarely capture the intricacies of their roles.  Despite the flaws, this film makes a worthy addition to my collection, though it does not rise to the intense pathos of Olivier's tenderly heartbreaking agony or the mythic, heroically tragic Lear of Kosintsev.",1252713600,8,1344,5.067873303167421
3557700,5,B001EXBWX6,"Ian McKellan totters into a circle of light and raises his palsied hands to command his court into prostrate submission. McKellan's Lear has a despot's easy authority that effortlessly requires obedience. Aged, infirm and bright-eyed, Lear enjoys humiliating those who doubtless wish him dead so that they may inherit.  McKellan's Lear is a sly-suave tyrant - reminiscent of Olivier. There are other fine Lears -  the brutally hostile Ian Holm (the boss from hell), James Earl Jones' as a cranky African tribal chief, or Orson Welles' nightmare fury. All are excellent. Welles, Olivier, and McKellan are more cinematic whereas Jones and Holm are filmed versions of stage productions. Welles and Holm provide a strong dose of Sturm und Drang melodrama - the volume is turned up so high, it is hard to tell when catharsis hits. Olivier and McKellan are beautifully acted and nuanced. Jones has an amazing voice and his presence overwhelms the cast - except perhaps Raul Julia's wonderful plotting, evil Edmund.

Of the directors, Trevor Nunn is the best and most experienced interpreter of Shakespeare to cinema. He is faithful to the text, (cuts are logical and keep the action moving) but with contemporary Hollywood fit and finish. It helps that Nunn takes care of details that Shakespeare neglects. For example, he shows us exactly how Goneril poisons Regan. When Lear complains that ""my poor fool is hang'd,"" - it refers to an earlier scene where the Fool is actually strung up.

The part of Lear demands a strong actor who can easily dominate a production. Only Olivier and Nunn balance the King with a strong supporting cast. Appearing opposite Olivier are John Hurt as the brilliantly sarcastic Fool, Leo McKern (Rumpole of the Bailey) as a pompously lecherous Glouster, and Diana Rigg as the blindingly beautiful Regan.

Trevor Nunn's outstanding cast boasts Romola Gerai as a sensual Cordelia - upswept hair, wearing a strapless, white satin, wedding gown, and a simple gold chain necklace, that accents her flawless profile, neck, shoulders, and decolletage. Nunn's inspiration for Cordelia is a mystery, but to me she looks like Sargent's sensational painting of Madame X, with the black dress changed to white. She speaks from the heart, clear-eyed, like a child, rejecting Lear's incestuous demand that his daughters love only him - and pays a price for her honesty. Sylvester McCoy's amazing performance as the bitter fool -who alone speaks truth to power without punishment - rivals John Hurt's. Where Hurt practices wicked satire as a sport, McCoy is a disappointed romantic, his cynicism mixed with sadness.

Once again, Trevor Nunn has created an excellent film version of Shakespeare. If only more of his works were available for north american viewers.",1245456000,119,2771,5.119469026548672
3557701,3,B001EXBWX6,"I had the privilege of seeing this production performed live in LA. It was an incredible experience slightly marred by the fact that the concert hall was clearly a larger space than these actors were used to filling with their voices, and for those of us stuck under the balcony, it was not always possible to hear everything over the ambient noises around us. So I was thrilled when I heard that they were taking the production into the studio to trap it for posterity, and I immediately bought the (region free) Blu-Ray edition from the UK.

I don't regret the purchase, but I was somewhat disappointed. Outdoor scenes are all filmed against a blue screen that poorly simulates sky, giving all the outdoor scenes a certain cheese factor. On a stage we suspend our disbelief - the lighting changes and we believe we are now out of doors, but on a screen we expect a little more realism.

Likewise, I found the sets of the stage performance more effective as well. They had a grandeur - and later in the play, a decay - that was really missing from the sets used in the studio. I understand that the studio was aiming for more realism, so you wouldn't have the same backdrop for a whole act when the scenes shift and so on. But they didn't manage to replace the missing set with anything more effective dramatically.

Furthermore, the cinematography was very heavy handed in terms of constantly flashing from one actor's face to another to make sure no reaction is missed. It was at times very jarring. On a stage, one of the interesting dynamics is that each audience member can choose where to focus attention, and so each person walks away with a different experience. Here in an attempt to capture the richness of each scene, the camera tried to show everything, and the result wasn't pleasant. O.K. The camera didn't show EVERYTHING. The infamous scene were Lear strips down is trimmed by the frame of the camera for modesty. So if such things as male nudity bother you, this is a production you can watch with your kids.

But if you get over the cheese factor of the camera work and sets, this is still Trevor Nunn, Ian McKellan and the Royal Shakespeare Company doing their thing. You'll hear Shakespeare's words interpreted and performed with great skill.",1243728000,66,2263,4.635910224438903
3557702,5,B001EXBWX6,"It's not exactly complete--and director Trevor Nunn even feels he can switch a speech to a new place in the text when it suits him. But this ""King Lear"" is an intelligent and often deeply persuasive performance of what is generally called the greatest tragedy in English. Ian McKellan is the name-above-the-title star, but his collagues are no faceless pickup group but rather the mighty Royal Shakespeare Company. And even if the video version has too much rain and other realistic effects, it gives you much of the power of the staging on which it is based. (Incidentally, onstage McKellen tore off his clothes in the storm scene but is not naked here. PBS prudery?)The groundbreaking Brook/Scofield RSC ""Lear"" isn't available on DVD for some reason, but this production compares favorably with the all-star Olivier edition and the minimalist Holm/National Theatre staging. That DVD reminded you right under Holm's name of the actor's ""Lord of the Rings"" identity but, happily, ""X"" DOESN'T mark the spot with McKellen.",1242259200,8,1020,5.11377245508982
3557703,4,B001EXBWX6,"3-hour adaptation from the Royal Shakespeare Company. Ian McKellen in wonderful in the title role, and the rest of the company is pretty strong. But I still prefer this story when it was reworked in 'Ran' by Kurosawa, which is a much better film even without Shakespeare's words. Still, this is the only literal version I've seen, and I enjoyed it. (Someday I'll have to watch Olivier's version, which is supposed to be definitive.)",1241136000,4,432,4.851351351351352
3557704,4,B001EXBWX6,"This is a superb but ultimately disappointing production of Shakespeare's greatest play.  How can it be both?  It is superb for several reasons.  Ian McKellen is one of the great Shakespearean actors of his generation, and he here delivers a masterful Lear, moving and credible and utterly faithful to the character in the text; if there are a few too many of the familiar McKellen mannerisms, who's to complain--they work as well here as elsewhere.  The rest of the acting is at a very high level indeed; there is not a single performance I would fault, and I couldn't say that of any other video ""Lear"".  The dialog has been intelligently edited, and clearly and audibly recorded; for once in a production of Lear there are no ""What did he just say?"" moments, not even with the Fool's dialog.  Logic and clarity are equally evidenced in Trevor Nunn's direction.  A small example: in this production, the disappearance of the Fool midway through the play is explained dramatically, as we witness his hanging by forces pursuing Lear, something not in the stage directions and only vaguely supported by the text.  It's dramatically satisfying; we need not ask ""What happened to him?""  Another example: the poisoning of Regan by Goneril occurs on stage, and is thereby made genuinely horrifying instead of being a bit of off-stage melodrama.  The initial displeasing of Lear by Cordelia and his instant, irrevocable rage, which are hard to make credible in performance because of the compressed stage-time, are easier to believe in here; they come off as (perhaps) some good-natured teasing gone horribly awry (though I'm not sure that's what was intended, and if so that it is faithful to the text).  So why is the production nevertheless disappointing?  When a great actor takes on a great character of Shakespeare, we want to come away with something new and great--some new understanding, some new emotion, some new experience of the play which will change forever our relationship to the text.  Here, alas, there is nothing new.  No new sense of Lear as an individual, as in the Olivier video, or of his relation to his daughters, as in Ian Holm's version.  Just a very straightforward, highly competent rendition.  Superb, but disappointing.",1240531200,56,2245,4.962566844919786

3557709,3,B001EXBWX6,"Oh goodness. I'm a massive Shakespeare fan. I just spent 2 pretty full theatre days seeing the Royal Shakespeare Company. McKellen is still wonderful. But I find this play so confusing. We have the illegitimate son contriving to hurt his father. The idiot King on a bit of a power trip-wanting people to prove their love by dangling their inheritance in front of them-which of course backfires in the most spectacular fashion. The faithful daughter who gets kicked out only to return and be her fathers saving grace (but she still dies). It's terribly hard to follow the action. Other directors have chosen different ways to portray the infamous ""blow winds blow"" soliloquy Here it doesn't make a lot of sense. I don't think I'm the only one who struggles with this play. It is still worth seeing for McKellen. I'm a huge Ramola Garai fan and did enjoy her in this-but don't think she got a chance to shine in this",1462233600,,914,4.648148148148148

3557727,5,B001EXBWX6,"After watching this movie once, I have gone back to re-watch several scenes over and over. The entire cast was great. I admire Ian McKellen's ability to interpret Shakespeare. In particular, he has a way of taking a repetitious line, such as ""No. No. No. No."" or ""Forever. Forever"" and put different intonations on each repetition, different length pauses between them, and make it sound real, fresh and compelling. He makes his voice sound like he is 80 years old, but that means rasping and sometimes whispering, so I didn't always catch every word. However, I would go to the text in my complete works of Shakespeare and read the lines, then re-watch the scene and appreciate it all the more. My favorite scenes were the one where he consoles Cordelia, telling her how they can live a good life in prison, and of course, the one when he mourns over her body. Look for the various ways he uses his handkerchief.",1446249600,3,913,4.6419753086419755

This is the best movie adaptation of the play I have came a crossed & didn't hesitate adding it to my Shakespeare collection.  Whenever Shakespeare is translated to film much of the authors words are lost due to time constraints & such is the nature of turning Shakespeare's works into movie's, but if done well the film maker captures the meat of the matter & supplements what is lost in verse by great cinematography.  I can't say this is the case with this adaptation but it is one of the best I have found.  So I chose this version to add to my Shakespeare movie collection.",1444176000,3,756,4.41726618705036

3557768,4,B001EXBWX6,"King Lear: RSC/Ian McKellen
****

I watched two King Lears this year neither live, unfortunately  both starred established greats.  The Lear in one was an admirable, brave and quite good performance  the other deeply affecting.  Just before watching this Lear with Ian McKellen in the title role, I had read David Westons Covering McKellen: An Understudys Tale, essentially a diary of the year Weston spent as part of the Royal Shakespeare Companys King Lear.  How wonderful, then, to have that production documented and available on film.  This was not a filmed version of the staged play, such as the NTLive offerings, but rather a re-staging for the film using the same cast and director  Trevor Nunn  that followed the closing of the tour.

Reading the book first meant that I had a certain subjective familiarity with the cast members and I suppose the production itself.  That said  the play was sufficiently engaging, Sir Ian in particular, that I quickly was able to put that aside and just engage.

In his book, Weston frequently refers to King Lear  as Shakespeares greatest work  but I cannot say that is the case for me. I do think the role of Lear is a monumental one for an actor and when done well is powerful indeed  but there are also quite a few scenes that just never quite work for me.  Have I ever seen a Fool that did not annoy me on some level and seem to take up far too much stage time?  Alas, this one was no different.  The two bad daughters, Gonerill and Regan too often seem to devolve into caricature, and their twin deaths seem to be difficult to stage convincingly.  Still, the plays success ultimately depends on the Lear  and in this case, the Lear was, for me, both convincing and affecting.  The reviews of the staged performance as recorded in the book were all over the map  from raves to the occasional dismissal,  but audiences appear to have uniformly embraced the production and its star.

I first saw Ian McKellen onstage as Salieri in Amadeus.  It was a memorable introduction.  While many viewers likely know him from his work in the Tolkein films, he is first and foremost a theatre actor.  His King Lear is at once subtle and bold  befuddled and endearing.  The screen truly comes alive when he is on it.  The set is stripped down and the minimalism serves well to focus on the actors and the themes of aging and dignity, family, fidelity, betrayal and power.  Lear makes some exceedingly poor choices and seems to be clueless when it comes to the true nature(s) of his own offspring  despite that  this King Lear deserves our affection and holds our interest.

3557782,4,B001EXBWX6,"The Trevor Nunn production resolves the ambiguities of the play in one direction. Lear is somewhat dotty from the very beginning. That is why he responds the way he does to Cordelia's refusal to say how much she loves him. Her two sisters see his request as that of an old man, somewhat inappropriate, but comply because they want the property. But if that were the case, why does not Cordelia go along, just to make an old man happy? That would be the more loving way. Her obstinance would indicate that there is something more at stake. A different reading of the play is that Lear is making a very practical arrangement to deal with the transition of power. He even specifies the number of horsemen he will keep with him. He had wanted to keep the three daughters in balance and was prevented from doing that by Cordelia who also thought this a practical arrangement whereby she need pledge no more than was her duty as a daughter. I don't know how to present these two different views of Lear at the same time and a director makes his choices, but it doesn't add up and so the excellent performances by the actors are swallowed by the intricacies of the play. Also, I don't think the Cossack/Russian costumes for the males make sense in a barbaric England, and the strapless gown for Cordelia is a bit too revealing, more a sign of youth and sexuality than innocence, when innocence is at least an excuse for her rudeness to her father.",1395705600,3,1440,4.5

3557790,5,B001EXBWX6,"All right. I'm sorry I took so long to write this, but here goes.

I was very pleased with it. They stayed true to the play. The costumes looked like a combination of the Civil War era and the Victorian era. That kind of makes it hard to figure out what time period and this production takes place. Any guesses?

Now on to the acting. The villians in this production were the nastiest yet. The scene with Kent being put in the stocks comes to mind,with their gleeful treatment of him. Gloucester's blinding scene was the bloodiest I've seen. I think Gloucester could have been more defiant. We also get to see the Fool hanged (I couldn't bear to look),Goneril poisoning Regan's wine bottle, and Regan's physical demise. Any sympathy we may have had with Edmund at first (watch his reaction in the beginning at his father's comments to Kent) are lost as his villiany gets underway. He just doesn't care who he hurts as long as he gets what he wants. At least he tries to save Lear and Cordelia in the end.

Like in the play, the heroes are the best performances. King Lear manages to stay likable throughout in spite of his boneheaded mistakes. Gloucester was unlikeable at first, but redeems himself with his love for the king. The Fool was a riot. What I didn't like was the crotch grabbing he and Lear did. Totally unnecessary. I have yet to see a horrible Kent performance. This one was near perfect. My only complaint was the end where he pulls the gun out of his holster, leaving us with the impression he'll shoot himself. Unnecessary for an already depressing enough ending. The same goes with Edgar.  His Edgar/Poor Tom transformation was spot on. I've always seen Edgar as a man who's a little dimwitted at first, but ultimately a good guy who's noble and acts with the best of intentions concerning his father. This was my favorite performance. My quibble? I have yet to see a production where Edgar and Edmund forgive each other after their duel. It's in the play, but is usually left out. Forgiveness is not unrealistic. I wouldn't wanna fight with either this Edgar or Edmund. Their duel is the most physical one yet. Who wouldn't want Cordelia for a sister? She's no fake. She's even physically prettier than her sisters and a better dresser to boot. My quibble? I thought this Cordelia was a little self-righteous at first. I saw the little smirk she gave Regan after she said ""Sure I shall never marry like my sisters, to love my father all."" I see Cordelia has a humble gentle woman. I loved the way she said, ""Shall we not see these daughters, and these sisters?""

I first read about this play in Beowulf on The Beach by Jack Murnighan and The Literary 100 by Daniel S. Burt. I found a copy of the PBS broadcast at my local library and loved it. I soon read the play and loved it. This play got me interested in Shakespeare for the first time since high school. I highly recommend this DVD.

3557804,3,B001EXBWX6,"One the one hand, Trevor Nunn's King Lear is a showcase for one of the finest Shakespearean actors of our time - the incomparable Sir Ian McKellen, supported by a fine cast, and one the other... it is perplexing, misguided, and low on production value.

On the good, McKellen as Lear is perfect. He perfectly captures the madness, tenderness, sadness, and foolishness of the old king. Just as Hamlet is the ultimate role for an actor in his prime, the role of Lear is perhaps the brightest star an aging actor can have on his resume, and Lear is perhaps McKellen's magnum opus.

Romola Garai shines (almost literally) as the fair Cordelia, and the other two sisters are deliciously evil. But apart from Sir Ian, the real star of the show is Sylvester McCoy's fool. Where John Hurt played him as a literal fool (as somewhat did Pt in Kurosawa's unsurpassed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ran/dp/B0037EAJAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ran</a>), McCoy's character slowly reveals a man more sane than anyone else onscreen. His jokes peel away to reveal a cynical, weary man. When McKellen and McCoy are onscreen, the play does brilliantly.

5 Stars to the acting.

However, there are a surprising number of perplexing choices on display here. All the sets are black and dark, lit by floodlights. The setpieces are small and sparse (and while that does work in a play, when on film it can detract from the piece), the ""outdoor"" scenes are filmed on a sound screen, with background by blue screen. I wish the production values were higher. It doesn't hurt to actually film on a SET!
Trevor Nunn cuts out some very crucial and important parts from the play, abridging several lines, then skipping ahead, or behind, leaving a diehard Shakespeare fan like me confused and annoyed.

The result is a mixed bag. Watch it for Sir Ian McKellen's incredible, memorable performance, but there is little else to recommend.

Recommended. 3.8 Stars.

P.S. Check out Akira Kurosawa's electrifying adaptation of King Lear, set in feudal Japan: RAN. If Ran is not the finest cinematic adaptation of King Lear, then I'll commit seppuku. Check out my review on it.",1374451200,5,2183,5.081005586592179

3557807,4,B001EXBWX6,"This is the first time I have seen a production of ""King Lear"", and I had high expectations for the performance by Ian McKellen, who has the reputation of being the finest Shakespearean actor of this generation. McKellen did not disappoint. I was also delighted by the performance of Sylvester McCoy (McKellen's costar wizard in ""The Hobbit, An Unexpected Journey"") who played Lear's fool to a tee (in the absence of seeing any other performance. The down side, as many reviewers have noted, is that the ambiance of the space, lighting, stage dressing, and props, and even the costumes, simply did not contribute to a positive overall impression. Shakespeare's Lear is based on a pre-Roman Celtic king, whose story was transplanted to the world of the Plantagenet. This production's set, props and costumes speak of the early 19th century, with Napoleonic era firearms, artillery, and uniforms. This may not have been discordant, except that the set decoration and lighting put the actors in ""no place in particular"". They were either ""indoors"" or ""outdoors"", in a barn or in a castle, but that was it. The lighting may have been the least pleasant aspect, as most of the time, half the stage seemed to be in shadow. It was filmed on a large sound stage. I think it would have been more effective to film it on a proper stage with a fixed audience point of view.

Aside from McKellen and McCoy, the actors were competent with William Gaunt as a good Earl of Gloucester and Ben Meyjes in the demanding role of Edgar. Philip Winchester as Edmund was good for the part, but not ""great"". None of the other major roles seemed to escape a certain woodenness, except for Romola Garai as Cordelia in the last scene.

To be fair, I really need to see another production to make a fair appraisal, but this one did not meet expectations, except for McKellen and McCoy.",1366675200,,1857,4.728395061728395

The only good news I have is that the DVD came in good condition. I was going to post my opinions of this production of King Lear, but it will have to wait.

3557811,4,B001EXBWX6,"Ian McKellen's Lear is, as would be expected, magnificent.  He finds in Lear an inner strength that matches his foolishness.  The production is rich, the direction faultless.  The hanging death of the Fool, though extra-textual, is quite in keeping with the play's mood.  But why oh why does this production hold on to the age old and regrettable (and absurd) notion that Goneril and Regan are hitting menopause????!!!  When Lear curses Goneril with sterility it makes little sense (and strikes one as quite humorous) when spoken to an actress well into her forties.  I am not certain why it is that directors all insist that the two elder sisters be, well, elderly.  They are written as young, passion driven women and should be essayed by actresses in their early twenties with Cordelia being not much younger.  Ture, the two actresses give a good account of themselves, but it is difficult to take seriously a Goneril and Regan who seem to be rapidly approaching the same superannuation they mock in their father.  One sees this same error in the Olivier and the Scofield versions (I hazard a guess that the Goneril in Scofield's version was older than her father).  To my mind the tragedy is lessened by having the daughters having lived good long lives and that the tragic tenor of the play would find a greater pitch if the daughters were just entering adulthood with all life's promises before them.  This is not my humble opinion, it is based on the Master's text itself.
  Also, the actor playing Gloucester is completely miscast.  When his beard is plucked by the wretched Regan he reacts as though she simple showed bad manners at the dinner table.  Leo Mc Kern's Gloucester in Olivier's version is far worthier.",1343260800,2,1723,4.812925170068027
3557812,5,B001EXBWX6,"If you're to own one ""King Lear"", this is the production to acquire. The blu-ray transfer is beautiful; a faithful rending, I'm sure, of the stage production, but more importantly, for me at least, it includes the subtitles that the original DVD failed to include. The play's language is dense and unless you know it well, I suggest having the text in front of you (which rather negates the pleasure of watching it on screen, or have a version that optionally offers adequate and unobtrusive subtitles like this one). Additionally, I like the fact that Nunn sets his play in a faux-Romanov setting with customs and all. It is appropriate that this failing king should rule a corrupt and diseased monarchy like the Romanovs. And finally, there is McKellan as Lear. The opening scene encapsulates his view of Lear, all contained in the image of his fragile arms trying to raise his hands in blessing, painfully showing how old (but not yet apparent, senile) the good king is. McKellan is a treasure - from Richard II, Gods and Monsters, the Ring trilogy, of course, and now his Lear.

There are no subtitles to make the text easier to follow and given the movie's very considerable length, close to three hours, a significant effort is required from the watcher, despite the actors' undeniable talent.

3557814,5,B001EXBWX6,"I don't know of a perfect film adaptation of ""King Lear""; perhaps there's no such thing. In my mind's theater I amalgamate elements from different productions: the spectacle of Kurosawa's ""Ran,"" the performances of Diana Rigg (Regan), Leo McKern (Gloucester), and John Hurt (Fool) in Olivier's version. Other reviewers have astutely pointed up the values in different modern interpretations of the play's leading figure. On balance I'd say that McKellan's Lear is as fine as any we may expect in this generation. He's a soldier, bully, a bastard (not in the Edmundian sense), a fool, a maniac, and finally a very pathetic man who cannot comprehend, any more than we can, the scope of the tragedy that has overtaken him. Lear is a role that tempts the ham in even the best actors (see Olivier); McKellan is not once porcine. The actors surrounding him are uniformly fine; in particular, the three sisters are sharply delineated (and sexed up in ways that, while not gratuitous here, are often missing in the play's production). Trevor Nunn's staging remains on an interior set, as was Olivier's, though Nunn's are better interiors, with less cheesy production values. (The ""Howl, wind"" scene rains such buckets that you wonder how the studio was ever drained.) Nevertheless, this is not a filmed version of a play; the camera is used intelligently for close-ups.

Try this auto-persuasion by posing to your own ears the following hypothetical question, namely, ""How much would I pay for a TICKET to a theatre to see Ian McKellen perform King Lear live?"" I'm guessing you would easily pay $200 or more--it would be a once in a lifetime chance and therein lies the rub: You'd only get to see McKellen's Lear performance ONCE. So, you know, this DVD is selling for upwards of $90-$120...applying the hypothetical to this price does it not now appear to be a trifling little price? McKellen performing Lear for a lifetime for just a piddly $100? Indeed, upon new consideration it is no so much too expensive but perhaps too cheap!

I have seen every performance of King Lear available on Amazon and THIS ONE, the McKellen one, is *BY FAR AND AWAY* the best. You know, I listen to a lot of audiobooks--especially Homer--his epics accompany me on my cross-country drives. Ian McKellen narrated (shall I say performed?) an audio recording of Fagles' Odyssey. It was like slipping into a tailored Italian suit; it was PERFECT. I always recommend the audiobook to people by saying, ""Listen man, Ian McKellen doesn't just read Homer, McKellen *IS* Homer.""

McKellen is also Lear, in all the same ways, and in ways all McKellen's own. Having read and watched and listened to, I dunno, something like 15 different Lear productions, both audio and video, and over time I have developed a kind of ""meta-Lear"", that is, a deep understanding of his character and many examples of Lear competing against each other but then came McKellen. From the first frame, he riveted my attention to the screen; I did not ever look away.

The supporting characters are equally well cast. Many of the actors and actresses played their same roles in the BBC version of the play. Kent and the Fool are especially great and also Cordelia--she is lithe and stately and sensual and virginal and intelligent and innocent all at the same time. She has that first scene with Lear: ""Nothing, sir..."" It's got to be a daunting task for a young actress to go toe-to-toe with a guy like McKellen but she absolutely succeeded and indeed, whenever she was in frame your eyes are drawn to her.

The sets, the directing, the overall production quality--all very well done. It's just the best Shakespeare performance I own.",1496534400,,2486,4.761020881670533

8299743,4,B001EXBWX6,"Somewhat uneven performances. McKellan is wonderful, of course. Romola Garai was terrific. The sound quality was perhaps lacking as I kept finding myself unable to understand some of the lines. Sylvester McCoy was especially bad in this regard.",1465948800,,244,5.447368421052632
8299744,5,B001EXBWX6,"Thoroughly enjoyed this Royal Shakespeare Company production. Ian McKellen is Lear!  Watch Oliveier's version and compare: the king, the daughters and the fools as well. Never thought I'd enjoy anyone else as the Fool, except John Hurt, but Sylvester McCoy 's is excellent.  Make way Diana Rigg, Monica Duncan's Regan is astounding!",1465430400,,332,5.365384615384615
