Gibson may have been busy that day, but it is his  loss not  Mr. Barker's.  Good job Eric!",949968000,,262,4.51063829787234

1238668,4,B00000JT91,"The DVD version of this movie has finally arrived and finally, this movie can enjoy its just desserts. First of all, I am happy to see it in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio. I will skip the discourse on the beautiful  digital color saturation and crisp images the DVD version brilliantly  displays. Hitman's Run contains the kind of brilliant psychological study of  the violent mind that can only be found in movies such as Peckinpah's Straw  Dogs, and Jean Pierre Melville's Le Samourai. The plot unfolds like a  butterfly spreading its wings...and the dialogue, crisp and terse hammers  through like some of the best Noir, Tournier's Out of The Past or Marhall's  The Blue Dahlia...Anyone familiar with Mark L.Lester's work will find this  one arguably his best thesis on crime and the psychological unwindings of a  killer.",949622400,,828,4.985401459854015

1238670,5,B00000JT91,"This is fantastic movie!  I am a huge fan of the writer, Eric Barker, and Hitman's Run shows just how much potential he really has.  I especially liked the car chases and ultra-realistic depiction of firearm use.  I sure  hope the studio has Eric Barker write the sequel!  He was even able to  compensate for the occasionally stiff performance of Mr. Roberts.  I'm  buying this DVD for my mom for Valentine's Day, because she's also a big  fan of Eric Barker, the talented writer.",949622400,,480,4.619047619047619

He didn't over play his part as a lot of guys playing hit men would do. He is still in my opinion in the top 5 actors in Hollywood and in the 10 best of all time.

1238765,1,B00000JT91,"This movie was soooo bad that I'd rather watch a Dolph Lundgren movie marathon, and that has to be the near equivalent to choosing to commit suicide by slow cooker!  It seemed like a movie made in the late 60s or early 70s, instead of something near the turn of the 21st century.  To put this in context, this movie was released the same year as ""Payback,"" ""The Matrix,"" ""8MM,"" ""The Corruptor,"" ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,"" ""True Crime,"" and ""In Too Deep, among films in or near the same genre.  How in the world did this dated, poorly-choreographed, slow ""action"" film get made?

If there were anything to SPOIL, here's where I'd advise SPOILER ALERT.  But, alas, this movie was a rotten tomato before it was even planted!

Let's start with the script was awful.  If I'd seen this movie in 1972, I would've given it one star.  But, the mere fact that this movie was released in 1999, it gets even harsher treatment.  None of the actors gave a credible performance, and the stereotypical ""wise guys"" seemed like they were plucked from an episode of ""Starsky and Hutch,"" ""Kojak,"" or ""Police Woman.""  Absolutely nothing made sense in this movie--from the plot and plot twists to the action sequences.  It's as if the screenwriter did no research whatsoever.  The CIA is performing hits for a mob family.  A former hitman for that crime family has chosen to spare the life of an ordered hit, and so he went on the run into witness protection, where within a year, he's set up house with a mother and her eight- or nine-year-old daughter who's calling him ""Daddy"" already.  And when the mom learns she's been shacked up with a former hitman, her response is basically, ""Do you have any more secrets?"" and ""We have a lot to discuss...""  Seriously?  She's been ripped from her life, watched FBI agents murdered in front of her daughter, and, while being held at gunpoint, that's her response?

Meanwhile, the FBI, not the U.S. Marshals, is protecting the witnesses, and the CIA (an organization that restricted from operating on U.S. soil) is somehow involved in oversight of the movement of federal witnesses!!!  Yet, this doesn't set off any kind of red flag for the FBI.

To make matters even worse, Eric Roberts seemed like arthritis was getting the better of him and prevented him from being capable of pulling off the action sequences convincingly.  Several times, Eric Roberts' character stands nearly point-blank range from the mob guys, yet these professional killers can't hit him.

And, as the movie goes along, the filmmakers tossed in all sorts of obstacles that made absolutely no sense.  The whole CIA subplot was beyond asinine, ending with a couple of CIA cleaners sent to blow up the ship where Roberts' makeshift family was being held hostage.  Of course, the teenage hacker who's never disarmed a bomb before manages to disarm the bomb with one tick remaining (beyond cliche) while having a heart-to-heart with his long-lost dad.

This movie was as awful as ""Payback"" was entertaining.",1374451200,5,3009,4.798058252427184

Getting in the right mood, however, will require at least half a bottle of scotch, or something stronger.  I always excuse the actors in a movie like this because I know enough actors to know that they're working people just trying to make a living and doing the best they can with the material they've been given.  It's the material, the writing, that I have no sympathy for in a movie like this. The script here is so poorly written it makes ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" look and sound like high concept cinematic art.  Watch at your own risk.

1238769,1,B00000JT91,"This is the worst action film I've ever seen. The acting is amateurish, the fight scenes look like two year olds at play, and the dialog sounds like a bad translation of a bad foreign film. How anyone could rate this as watchable is beyond me.",1356912000,,243,4.304347826086956
1238770,1,B00000JT91,"This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. Eric Roberts is a very good
actor stuck in a super long series of grade B or lower movies. Roberts is almost
always entertaining to watch even in the really bad ones. I can't say that about
this one. It's a decent story but every actor in it sleep walks through it. Roberts
is too good an actor to be stuck in trash like this. There is very little I can
recommend about this flick.",1288569600,8,436,4.0813953488372094
1238771,3,B00000JT91,"When I first saw this video at Blockbuster, I ignored it thinking it was just another man with a gun film.  Upon recommendation from a friend, I rented it and was totally blown away.  It was brilliant.  I would gladly sell my house and all its contents just to see the sequel.  Although the direction was lacking and there are some strange edits, this film has an underlying genius to the plot...offbeat, avante garde, and refreshingly different.  I hope to see more from this writer.",1007337600,,484,4.647058823529412

1238775,5,B00000JT91,This is an action packed film.  Eric Roberts was a great choice for the lead.  Five stars for the screenwriter. I hope this is just the beginning for Eric Barker.,949968000,,162,4.366666666666666
7913508,4,B00000JT91,"Eric Roberts is Tony, a retired mafioso hit-man who finds his new life and family in serious jeopardy after a teenager with access to a list of former made men and their respective new aliases that they got through witness protection in this action film by the usually reliable Mark Lester.

While this film can't help but pale in comparison to Lester's earlier classic movies, the extremely talented Roberts once again proves he can elevate a rather pedestrian films. The kid sidekick however was another story, as I found him grating on the nerves. The plot is brain dead but with just enough action to make it a serviceable outing.",1516233600,,634,4.763636363636364
7913509,3,B00000JT91,"Really bothers me to see so many continuity errors, like a thousand mistakes in this dumb thing. The story line is typical B movie, so it doesn't stink, a little good acting, but half the characters were just bad actors. I actually loved how this was like a demolition derby for the 1970 luxury cars, like Cadillacs and Lincolns getting destroyed, which was a good thing.",1504483200,,371,4.636363636363637

7913511,2,B00000JT91,"It was almost decent comedy, not. I know there are B grade movies, but is there a C grade? For a hitman, Roberts couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with his automatic weapons. I mean any Texas youth can shoot better at 12 years old than this "" best hitman in the business"". Bad acting, worse effects. I mean you could see the blood packs under their shirts. The bad guys are using AK47s that wouldn't go through a sofa.. Really?? We sat through it just for a laugh, but it just kept getting stupider. Gave it 2 stars because I felt sorry for the actors that had to be in it so they could make rent money.",1497398400,,607,4.066666666666666
