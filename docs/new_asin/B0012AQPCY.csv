8244953,5,B0012AQPCY,Excellent. I grew up watching Space Angel before going to school. How about bring out part 2? How could you forget that voice sync they used then.,1355184000,,146,4.444444444444445
8244954,1,B0012AQPCY,"More poor quality stuff from this company.

This ""entertainment company"" is notorious for serving up incomplete hodge-podge corrupted episodes.  This Space Angel DVD has 4 episodes of the ""The Gladiators"" and SURPRISE its missing the last episode! The Video Quality is sub-standard, you get a bare minimum of a DVD menu no episode selection, illogical, meaningless chapter points and to top it off this baby will loop endlessly until you hit the STOP button. Dollar store bottom feeder video at its worst.

I cant excuse this compilation of digital refuse in any point - there are way better Space Angel DVDs out there, spend your money there.",1346716800,,643,4.990654205607477
8244955,2,B0012AQPCY,"I was glad to find ""Space Angel"" available on DVD and so cheap.  I'm glad I only bought the cheapest used one though.  At 60 minutes, the run is too short and it ends mid episode.  Very disappointing.  You'd think they could have at least included the ending of the episode they started.  No complaints about the quality, which is very good considering the age of the originals.  It did give me a kick to see the old cartoon with which I grew up. However, unless you are a desperate collector and just HAVE to have this disc, overall, it's not worth the price of the disc and international postage, which is what I paid.  Although, I must say the sellers turnaround time was excellent and they kindly included a FREE disc with my purchase called ""Defenders of Space"" which is pretty awful Japanimation from 1987.  At least it was good for a laugh.",1210809600,4,847,4.454545454545454
8244956,3,B0012AQPCY,"This disc (single, 60 minutes) has pretty good visual quality. The image is clear even though the source tape(s) were probably pretty old, hence the scratches, spots, and the occasional shaking of the image. But, given the extreme rarity of this item, Scott McCloud - Space Angel, it is a find to obtain any copy of it. One can hope there will be some version someday which gives us the entire series and with proper menus and also entire stories instead of simply cutting us off at 60 minutes and not completing the story.",1208995200,2,523,4.574468085106383
