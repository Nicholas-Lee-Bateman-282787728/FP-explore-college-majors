5772160,5,B00D3LA7D8,I highly recommend this. Chauncey Holt's story is important and needs to be heard. Chauncey Holt was interviewed a week before his death and tells many specifics that will answer a lot of your questions about the JFK assassination. The DVD is well done- don't miss this one.,1384819200,10,274,4.729166666666667
5772161,3,B00D3LA7D8,"Not as informative as I thought that it would be. However, this was no rip-off and worth the money. It just didn't have as much info on JFK as I thought that it would, and that was the real reason why I purchased it.
Still, the dvd was well produced and informative on a host of other subjects.",1384646400,8,294,4.086206896551724
5772162,4,B00D3LA7D8,for those that are curious about the jfk murder and the events around it. definitely glad i ordered it and watched it.,1382313600,4,118,4.409090909090909
5772163,5,B00D3LA7D8,"This video, and its printed sibling SELF PORTRAIT OF A SCOUNDREL, are IMHO great windows into the Pandora's box of the JFK assassination.  Chauncey Holt was central player in OPERATION MONGOOSE, an ultra-secret CIA-MAFIA project that had few masters, fewer rules, and lots of money.  Chauncey was the right-hand-man to Havana Mafia boss Meyer Lansky, serving as a combination of body guard, pilot, book-cooker, and forger, etc.  From Bugsy Siegle to Lee Harvey Oswald (whose phony ID's Chauncey has admitted he made), Chauncey Holt was a technician who carried out the plans of mobsters, spy masters, and crooked politicians on a daily basis for almost 25 years. He spoke up one week before he died and left us this video and his 700 page memoir in a trunk in his attic.  He names the names.  And explains the games.

If you want to journey down this rabbit hole, start here.  I strongly recommend both this video, and the book SCOUNDREL.  When you realize that Chauncey (Meyer Lansky's accountant, ,etc.) was photographed outside the International Trade Mart in New Orleans on August 16, 1963 with Lee Harvey Oswald, following Chauncey's meeting with Clay Shaw's boss (Lloyd Cobb), then you will start to see how the pieces of the puzzle connect.  Not for the novice, but definitely for those who want to dig deeper and who realize that they have been lied to about JFK's murder by professionals.

5772168,3,B00D3LA7D8,"I was disappointed in the production. The production values are amateurish, uncreative, and boring after awhile. Holt is credible but does not deliver the punchline: what exactly was his function as one of the Three Tramps? Who did the actual shooting? Where were they positioned? Were you interviewed by the Warren Commission or anyone else credible? Too much time explaining his background and shallow emphasis on November 22. Holt was credible, however.",1413763200,3,456,5.347222222222222

8589033,5,B00D3LA7D8,"People who would be inclined to buy this DVD will find it extremely interesting, I think.  It's absolutely worth the few dollars that most sellers are charging.  As others have mentioned, this video focuses on Holt's alleged career as a mobster and his involvement with the CIA.  It is not, strictly, having to do with the assassination of JFK.  As an expert forger, Holt claims to have created fake Secret Service IDs that he presumes were used by conspirators in Dealey Plaza when Kennedy was assassinated.  He also claims that he was ordered to create numerous fake IDs for Lee Harvey Oswald prior to JFK's assassination.  He also says that he was one of the infamous ""three tramps"" picked up shortly after the shooting.  In this film Holt - who has a great memory for names, dates, etc. - comes across as extremely credible.  For instance, he doesn't state that he knows that the fake Secret Service IDs he created were used in Dealey Plaza.  He simply states that it's a logical presumption.  He doesn't ""reach"", claiming to understand everything that happened in Dallas.  He has some very interesting documents which seem to support parts of his story.  I find the guy very believable but, of course, this sort of judgement is subjective.  Someone mentioned that the production wasn't very good - not sure what they mean.  The format is a very simple, straightforward interview - as such, it's fine.  Is Holt telling the truth?  I think it's highly likely.",1431388800,4,1462,4.788
