5854701,5,B00DTET5A0,"This movie is such fun to watch. We were thrilled to finally be able to obtain a copy. All the actors did a wonderful job of helping us relive a time when life seemed to take itself less seriously and people were less stressed and just able to enjoy themselves. I would put this movie in the same league as The Christmas Story, another wonderful contribution from Jean Shepherd. Jean Shepherd is a talented storyteller, and I would highly recommend this movie.",1393545600,,460,4.621951219512195
5854702,5,B00DTET5A0,"I saw this on public television about one year before ""A Christmas Story"" made it's debut. It's hard to believe but, but I feel it is even funnier. The casting couldn't have been better, and the narration was hilarious. The quality of the picture and sound are not the best, but I am thrilled to finally be able to see this again. If you are a fan of real comic you MUST get a copy of this",1388620800,6,389,4.064935064935065
5854703,3,B00DTET5A0,"It was a VCR rip from back in the day. You can see how rough the TV production was too, it was not as clean and proper as other 80's period pieces like Brighton Beach Memoirs or Radio Days, everything was dirty and more believable. Shep was in classic form too.",1387152000,4,261,4.137254901960785
5854704,2,B00DTET5A0,"This is a homemade DVD transfer made from an ancient VHS of the show that must have been taped from someone's local PBS station decades ago.  Both the image quality and the sound quality are barely acceptable.  Most significantly, there's no evidence that this is a legally licensed copy.  Someone's just using their home DVD burner to sell bootleg copies.  I hate being a party to that.

Now to the content:

For a program that's supposed to be set in the post-war period, everyone's sporting hairstyles and glasses from 1980.  Acting is mediocre.

If you're a die-hard Jean Shepherd fan this _might_ be worth it, but for anyone else, not so much.",1377648000,4,648,4.723214285714286

5854706,5,B00DTET5A0,This is a wonderfully funny and entertaining film starring Ralphie (A Christmas Story) and his family when Ralphie is a teen.  I was so happy to find it in a DVD and in really great condition.  A real bargain!,1433894400,,209,4.333333333333333

5854711,4,B00DTET5A0,"This is a funny funny movie that was first released as a PBS special and a young young Matt Dillion. Jean Shepherd should be known for more than ""A Christmas Story."" His writings are so entertaining and the effort to bring them to the screen have been successful to my thinking. I will never forget the line from this movie: And then I realized I was the blind date.",1413590400,4,366,4.318840579710145
5854712,5,B00DTET5A0,"Given the age of this television production, the video and audio are about the best one could expect -- they are quite acceptable. The sellers were great: this arrived quickly (we watched it with friends on the 4th!), and included a free dvd.

Great show if you love FUNNY family fare and Jean Shepherd.",1404604800,,303,4.611111111111111
5854713,5,B00DTET5A0,The seller was accurate in describing this dvd.  They sent with the dvd a very helpful instruction sheet.  They also included a gift of a free dvd.  We have watched this dvd with no problems.  Very satisfied.,1403395200,5,208,4.54054054054054
5854714,5,B00DTET5A0,"Jean Shepherd deserves someone to bring back his shows that were produced for PBS so this generation and every generation thereafter can see what a true American genius he is. Wanda Hickey,The Star-Crossed Romance of Josephine Cosnowski,Ollie Hopnoodle's Haven of Bliss,The Phantom Of The Open Hearth are all great American classics. It is a shame these are not shown just as his classic Christmas Story each season. You can find them on youtube or order online and are worth watching over and over. His radio shows are wonderful and full of fantasy. True Americana. Not many geniuses can write,produce,direct,act and create characters with so much depth and compassion that touch our core but Jean reaches those places in us only few can. You will find yourself watching over and over and over until you think the characters are family. Which they are and is how Jean wanted it to be.",1397260800,10,885,4.906666666666666
