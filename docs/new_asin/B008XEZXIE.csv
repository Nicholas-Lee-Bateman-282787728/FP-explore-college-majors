5189396,5,B008XEZXIE,It has a lot of fan service this series so guys won't be disappointed. The only thing you have to be careful with is that sometimes the discs come loose during shipping so keep that in mind but sometimes it happends and you can't help it. It's an awesome series get it.,1354320000,,269,4.1923076923076925
5189397,4,B008XEZXIE,"this is a very random anime. the graphics and animation are superb, the english dub  is badly done, mouth still moving and no ones talking type. i feel that they could have done way better as with infinite stratos.

the show has a main character who is very much a perv( plays/reads porn styled games and books) and a lucid idiot who causes war/violence and other misfortunes due to this nature, but fights for the women he loves and its very politically centered and has some weird areas you will either hate or like

*spoiler*
the girl he loves is named horizion the girl on the cover, and is dead & brought back

i truly liked all the action and weapon designs, the over story ws ok, but the detail and action, fanservice is well done, no nudity but bouncy breast type, and groping by main character.

in my opinion this is just another anime on my wall that i won't watch for a great length of time.
if you like kaze no stigme this has similar animation and the fighting style, as well as combat and action with mechs similiar to infinite stratos animation structure.

But if your looking for sekirie, girls bravo, freezing, rosario & vampire, cat planet cuties type walk away now, it won't fit you in the least

i hope this helps people on the fence of purchasing",1353110400,3,1268,4.439655172413793
5189398,5,B008XEZXIE,"When humanity descended from the sky they brought the Testament. A guideline that everyone must follow if they are to return to the heavens. In their world Japan is the only habitable country. Many different factions vie for power, and fight to protect the land they live on. Each group has an ultimate weapon called the Armor of Deadly Sins. The greatest threat is not the Armor though. The Testament ends abruptly, and this is the last year chronicled. Tori Aoi and his friends at the Aerial Metropolitan Ship Musashi will fight for the future and try to save Horizon. What or who is Horizon anyway? Is it worth fighting for? Is it worth dying for?

I bought this anime when it came out. There were no reviews or information on it yet. I was quite surprised. The first episode had me laughing out loud. At that time I could also see signs of a dramatic story in the works as well. There is an excellent mixture of comedy, drama, action, and suspense, not to mention boat loads of fan service. Most of the chicks are totally stacked, and the main character likes to run around fondling them and pulling their pants down. Along with those things this series also flaunts an amazing English vocal cast, high quality animation, and great character designs. It's got some unique themes as well as some typical anime hijinks. If I had to give you a frame of reference I would say this series very much reminds me of Infinite Stratos. I think I can see a little bit of Shattered Angels type stuff in here too. I have seen some pretty good animes come out in 2012. This series is no exception. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

P.S. I'll give you a tidbit. Horizon is the name of the girl on the Blu-ray case cover.",1352592000,12,1713,4.400630914826499
5189399,5,B008XEZXIE,"Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere is one of those anime's that you absolutely have to give a look. The animation is great, the songs are catchy, and the storyline is unique. Based centuries in the future where humans have comeback to Earth from outer-space to find that Japan is the only livable plot of land, the people of Earth create outer dimensions of Japan in order to accommodate all the people and follow the ""Testament"" in hopes of repeating history and returning to the great beyond.

 It is completely over-the-top crazy and wildly entertaining, and fails to fit in a neatly defined genre. The writing is pure genius and has carried over well into the anime which despite its complexity doesn't stop for long-winded explanations, but rather sweeps the audience away with the constant hands-on revelations about the structure of its world. This anime will confuse in the beginning you need to have strong mind that all i can say,its intriguing series that has me hooked up. There is a bit of something for everyone from Tons of action, an underlying love story, to raunchy comedy, Oh yeah Fanservice, most characters have Large Boobs.

There are many whiners that dun understand it at all, gave up on series early there lost, there is a good chance the series will continue for a long time. There Season 2 out now, may come more 3 to 4, I hope.",1344902400,47,1353,4.676470588235294
5189400,2,B008XEZXIE,"I am reviewing both the anime itself and the Sentai Filmworks localization.

I would rate this anime at least 4 stars. It takes a bit to get started, but the world is vivid and alive, the animation is smooth, the characters are interesting, and there are a lot of them without bogging down the story.(I'm looking at you, Bleach.) The premise is a historical re-creation which gives a justification to mix historical figures such as Lord Masanobu Honda in with far-future science fiction like airships and ""living"" robots, presented alongside fantasy elements such as magic, spirits, priestesses, and gods. The first few episodes are slow, running through the same day from several different perspectives, but the series heats up quickly, and in my own case I was glad I stuck with it.

To paraphrase a certain internet video game reviewing personality with a talent for creative swearing, ""How dare this series suddenly be good.""

Now onto the localization.
I would give this localization 1 star, and only because that's the lowest score I can give it.

Sentai Filmworks is quickly becoming the new 4-Kids Entertainment of anime localization. Unlike 4-Kids, however, who earned their poor reputation for editing series in effort to lower the age of the target audience and their tendency to butcher and amputate plot lines willy nilly, Sentai are earning their reputation through a much more simple means. They just don't care.

No effort was put into the translation work. As usual Sentai Filmworks simply took the official translation that Crunchyroll used for their subtitles, handed it to a group of B-list voice artists, and said ""Here, make sounds with your flappy-flappy-faceholes."" No attention was paid to continuity, personality, or translation accuracy.

For example, one very prominent character is, for political purposes, a Female-to-Male transexual whose surgical operations were halted mid-way through, again for political reasons, leaving her with a more-or-less boyish appearance and role, but biologically female. This character, fulfilling a male societal role, refers to herself using male Japanese pronouns, as do other characters who don't know her actual nature. The rest of the cast discovering she's female is something of a major event, but this is entirely ruined by the fact that in the Sentai dub, everyone has been referring to the character in question as ""she"" and ""her"" since day 1, right up until five minutes before the reveal when the director apparently said ""Oh shoot, everyone thought she was a guy. Whatever.""

As said in the review for the anime itself, the animation quality is simply stunning. Which makes it unfortunate that an encoding engineer seems to have left his job early around episode 10, where the image resolution drops rather jarringly in the middle of a scene from the standard Blu-Ray high definition to something that's below DVD quality and persists nearly halfway through the following episode. What's the point of paying the premium for a Blu-Ray copy of a work when the image quality is prone to dropping to VHS quality at random points?

Between this, the atrocious dub quality of Sentai Filmworks's Girls Und Panzer localization, and the fact that they regularly release a series without even bothering to record a dub(The Pet Girl of Sakurasou, for example), I personally will no longer be purchasing anime which has been localized by Sentai Filmworks.

And don't even get me started on what they did to Log Horizon. It's like the 1990s all over again.",1419379200,5,3519,5.116724738675958
5189401,5,B008XEZXIE,Yes - this is a very awesome Anime..  Yeps..,1413936000,,44,3.888888888888889

5189403,2,B008XEZXIE,"I bought this thinking it would be like Sekirei, Queen's Blade, or High School DxD, but it is not, it is only t.v. 14 so there is no nudity. I tried to watch it for the plot and almost immediately became disinterested. Maybe sometime in the future I'll try watching it again.",1396224000,,275,4.3076923076923075
5189404,4,B008XEZXIE,"Not going to go in to detail on the plot many of the other reviewers have already provided that. With that being said, I found this show to be truly enjoyable. There is a big plethora of characters so obviously they aren't all fleshed out but even so they are all enjoyable. Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere didn't have as much action as I'd hoped but it still had enough for me to stay interested. Speaking of action, the action scenes are truly amazing to watch, the explosions, visuals, sounds are incredible. The only dislike i had about this show was the dialogue, and the amount of talking. Prepare for A LOT OF TALKING with this show and you may have to rewind/rewatch a few times to fully understand what the hell their talking about lbvs.  Its not necessarily a bad thing its just a personal pet peeve of mine when the dialogue is over compicated, in an annoying fasion instead of a challenging manner. Overall 4/5 stars. loved the show. recommend rental before purchase",1392422400,,979,4.5625
5189405,5,B008XEZXIE,"The first three to four episodes may seem so confusing and strange that the viewer will be sorely tempted to stop watching but if the user bears with the confusion and keeps watching on then they'll be rewarded with one of the most amazing shows to date. Even if you don't understand the plot or the terminology, the fight scenes are exciting and original enough to keep the viewer engrossed. Essentially the story is set in the future where people can use magic under certain conditions and they have to retrieve Horizon's emotions that were turned into weapons.

This show had the most unique battle technique I have seen in any story. What was that technique? A debate. No, that's not a joke. That just gives you an idea of how different (and good) this show is. The characters decide to battle with a debate and what a debate! The main male character starts off with a unique tactic in this unique battle strategy that I have never before seen in a debate. Watch to find out what it was.

This anime will have to be watched twice to understand fully what is going on as it doesn't explain the background and when the characters do exposition the history or their circumstances, it is still full with gaps. A special glossary should have been included in the Extras section of the discs but wasn't. I did watch this show twice and, to once again prove how good this show is, I had just as much fun watching this a second time as I did the first.",1390953600,,1448,4.43984962406015
5189406,5,B008XEZXIE,Me and my brother love this series and wished they made more. Hilarious and lots of mech/romance/comedy is an added bonus.,1390262400,,122,4.857142857142857
5189407,3,B008XEZXIE,"Am I not the only one that confused?

Who is the main characters in this anime? They fighting each other with beautiful graphic blends with a very hard to follow story. Jumping rapidly from this character to that character, from group A to group B, speaking something who-know-what.

The beautiful lady on the cover supposed to be the main character of this show (I have bought her nendoroid form long time ago) is singing in the beginning the short song in 2 episodes I have seen so far. She's also using the broom to clean the leaves on the floor. And that's all. No emotion, no deep, no specific characteristic.

Can believe i'm still trying to watch it again till the end after many times falling asleep. Should I dare to buy the season 2 hoping for a better, clearer story?

Such a masterpiece in the middle of Nowhere!!!",1384905600,,826,4.523489932885906
5189408,4,B008XEZXIE,"So I blind purchased this and I am happy to report I am not disappointed (unlike that god-awful Bodacious Space Pirate)

I won't recap the story description that is posted with the details so I will cut to the chase.

Characters - They are well developed (not talking upper body assets) and for the most part have a unique personality. (hate the class pres character, he is a weird and it makes no sense why anyone talks to him ... but they do so w/e)
Story - Its actually good.
Animation - Very clean, action scenes are well animated and I haven't seen a botched/error yet)

Issues: For me a really confusing part was figuring out what the hell people were talking about when it came to locations ... It wasn't until later that I learned that the ship and the province they are from was named the exact same thing ....  at first I thought it was a translation issue.

I didn't really like the way the story arc ended in this 1st season, it seemed odd, from a motivation stand point. But the fallout from  season 1 carries over into season 2 so strange events aside it gets picked up in season 2.",1382140800,,1096,4.321951219512195
5189409,3,B008XEZXIE,"So I'm not even really sure where to begin but I guess I'll just start with the positive points I took away from the series. First, the art direction and animation is very smooth. Not quite as clean as say ""Angel Beats!"" but there is more going on, a lot more with mechs and tech witches and gigantic floating ship cities and a ton of supporting characters ever episode. If you like variety, I have to say that ""Horizon on the Middle of Nowhere"" has got that in spades. Accompanying the artwork the original Japanese voice over work is pretty good. Lines are delivered with emotion and debates in the 9th episode are spoken with conviction. Essentially, it takes itself seriously to a degree but the pacing is utterly insane rocking back and forth between emotional moments and then off the wall joke sequences with very little build-up to buffer the sudden changes.

Leading in from there, I get the feeling the plot is very complex but the direction they took was to explain things in long monologue sequences by separate characters in piecemeal portions in each episode progressively filling in holes about the world and the technology and backstory. It's kind of a contrived, under the bus method of telling a backstory though it does its job. I just didn't agree with the format. This style lacks elegance and breaks up the pacing a lot to have some character explain what could ONLY BE common sense to everyone else but awkwardly they do a pseudo soliloquy to simply tell the audience/viewers what it is they are even referring to so we as the audience aren't totally lost. Downside is the concepts are so foreign with no point of reference to hinge on most times, it still doesn't really elucidate what anything they are saying really means.

If that wasn't bad enough, there are holes in character development that never really get explained. For example the lead character Tori is a flippant, happy go lucky guy who is portrayed as bumbling and childish in almost all things; however he is a student council president who has no intention on bettering his home room class which appears to be only one of 2 in an entire academy and what's more he somehow has garnered the unconditional loyalty of every member of that same class with no explanation as to why. He if anything, spends his time stripping naked as weird punishment games for failed wagers with his teacher and gropes most of the other girls' bubble shaped boobs that are nearly as large or larger than their own heads.

However, after episode nine, everything sort of falls into a mish-mashed organization since the driving force becomes a rescue mission that also stands as the opening battle for a nation state's independence. It still doesn't really answer a lot of issues with characters except maybe the main 3-4 and very thin expos at that but the series really stands out by chucking new strange elements right into the battle fray. Everything from future tech witches complete with mecha styled upgraded brooms to ride on that fire lasers to powered armor suits to super relics that have battle tide changing properties and a hot headed Pope who accepts a duel from a man-girl grooming to be a major politician. Yeah, it's just that unhinged.

Altogether, I wouldn't say I dislike this series, it's just chaotic and hard to follow for what I'd consider most casual watchers. It has some redeeming qualities and the characters are generally likable if mostly unexplained correctly and lacking much character development but with all the madness that goes on from the opening sequence through the battle that acts as a linchpin for the last 4 episodes it still has its charms I guess; really you just have to take it with a grain of salt and keep in mind it's probably not like any series you've ever seen before, for good or bad.",1381190400,,3807,4.720300751879699

But then there's the story... When watching this show, you must resign yourself to understanding almost none of it. The show drops you in the middle of events, characters, and setting that are completely unexplained. Eventually the series attempts to explain what in the world is happening... But they're not very good at it . As stated previously, resignation is the key.

Unfortunately, it becomes quickly apparent that there is nothing to see here beyond the skintight clothes and fanservice. The characters talk in ways that would be interesting if they actually had something to say that was deeper than merely reflecting the action on the screen. And when they do finally have something to say, it becomes a wall of text infodump with added English and German mixed in for extra confusion. This is a train wreck of epic proportions.

But hey, the fanservice is top notch. You want to see boobs and butts and skin tight clothes? Check. Random fanservice lesbians? Check. Reverse trap with a complex about her chest? Check check check.

Honestly, I really did want to like this show. I love light novel adaptations but this one is so weak I have to pass and warn others away. Far away.
