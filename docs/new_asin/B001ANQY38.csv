8278159,5,B001ANQY38,"I pretty much bought it when it first came out because of three people who were in it, who were in other things I liked. I ended up with a new director among my favorites. Emile is really good too. To aspiring directors everywhere, if you can be half as good as Carl Bessai, you're doing all right.",1426723200,,298,4.155172413793103

8278161,4,B001ANQY38,"I bought this movie because I am a fan of Kevin Zegers but to be honest it was pretty good. You sort of get sucked into the stories of everyone and find yourself rooting for some of them, while shaking your head at others.",1422144000,,222,4.068181818181818
8278162,3,B001ANQY38,"It is a good movie.  I only gave it three stars because I really got tired of the grieving mother.

The film is about how a fatal accident forever changes the lives of three families.  It is a story about the search for forgiveness and redemption.  It is also a story about how some people let tragedy destroy themselves and those who love them.

There is an unforgiving grieving mother; a forgotten surviving son; a teenager who made a fatal mistake trying to impress his not-so-perfect best friend; a lonely stepmother; a narcissistic father who cannot connect with his son or new wife; a depressed college professor who no longer has anything in common with his wife and who hates his job; a mentally ill man who is struggling with his own demons; and the girlfriend of the deceased who has already moved on.

The actor who played the man with agoraphobia and other mental illnesses did a superb job.

The tags ""transsexual"" and ""Jessica Lange"" have nothing to do with this movie.",1244419200,13,983,4.6473988439306355
