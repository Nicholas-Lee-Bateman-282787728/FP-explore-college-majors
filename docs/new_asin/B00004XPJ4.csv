7926064,1,B00004XPJ4,"This is NOT the only travel video on the Philippines, but it IS the worst.  A lousy 23 minutes of fluff showcasing the most expensive resorts in Philippines and a fashion show nobody cares about.  Only buy this if you have money to burn.  By the way, it's on a recordable (purple) DVD not factory pressed.  If you can find them, check out the Globe Trekker or Video Visits travel videos.",1166572800,5,387,4.408450704225352

7926066,3,B00004XPJ4,"This is 1st video (now released on DVD) of The Philippines in over 5 years. I review books & videos on my website about the Philippines and I have searched everywhere. It is an interesting approach, different than traditional travel videos. Conversation keeps it lively as you are shown some of the most beautiful areas covering several islands.

It highlights romantic luxury hotels and resorts. Fairly expensive places but very nice to take your girlfriend.

Unfortunately, it is not for those who want to learn about the true Filipino culture. Actually, the DVD movie ""Closer to Home"" shows more, so I recommend it.  I wish there was a true new travel DVD about The Philippines. We have a great country, speak English, and I just do not understand why the ""travel industry"" so often ignores us. :-(

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SAVE YOUR MONEY Reviewer: Richard Bearse from Orangeburg, New York USA This is a very short video, 30 minutes in length, that is nothing more than a commercial for lingerie designer Natori and Travel & Leisure Magazine. Great emphasis is given to the usual tourist traps and luxury hotels and resorts. Great for the wealthy, fashion conscious tourist, but terrible for the average person who wants to learn about the true Filipino culture. Not recommended if you want to experience the true local flavor and uniqueness of the Philippines. This tape only shows segments that so-called high society snobs will enjoy, not your working class tourist. I was very disappointed. Money would have been better spent on a tour guide.",994809600,15,1171,5.847953216374269
