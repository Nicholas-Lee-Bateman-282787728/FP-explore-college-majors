6412903,5,B00KB3PZ4W,"I just have to say thanks to Discotek Media/Eastern Star for getting this wonderful series out of DVD!!  I have been waiting 10+ years for the second and third season of Monster Rancher.  Season 1 was never completely released on DVD, but you could get it on VHS back in the early 2000's.  I have watched Eastern Star's first season of Monster Rancher, and it was very good quality.  So I am expecting the same for the second and third season.  :)

I will try to remember to add more to my review once I have received and watched the DVD's.  Once again, kudos for getting this anime out on DVD!!!  It is my personal favorite.",1406592000,4,625,4.327586206896552

8657186,5,B00KB3PZ4W,"This was such a cool cartoon as a kid. Back than, we loved monsters, well, the kind of monsters from the cartoon that is. I loved everything from this cartoon Monster Rancher, it had action, adventure, drama, comedy and cool characters in this. They had all sorts of adventures that were so cool, so many cool monsters. This is a piece of cartoon history gold here. I'd recommend this cartoon to any kids who love monsters in their own little world.",1455235200,,449,4.555555555555555

8657189,4,B00KB3PZ4W,"I'm so happy that these FINALLY got released.  Admittedly, they aren't exactly ""high quality"" (in fact I'd say they are on par with VHS quality video wise), there are no sub-titles and no original Japanese audio, and the censoring done on a few of the episodes is still present...  But in all honesty, I'D RATHER HAVE THESE THAN NOTHING!!!  I bought all three seasons at once and the only gripe I have is that a couple of the disks (across all three sets... and I mean like 2 or 3) had some bad spots where one of the episodes on the disk would glitch for a little bit, but two of them my computer managed to play through though the video was a little garbled, and the third one I think I lost like 5-10 seconds of audio and video.  But other wise they all worked and worked well.

I guess I can kind of understand why some folks don't really care for the second season as it becomes a little more Pokemon/DBZ-ish in its focus on the monster battles and the story isn't as strong as the the original arc from the first two seasons.  That said I think it is a great addition to the series.  I thought they could have done a little bit better job on the story of how the main character comes back (as in the vist episode of this season), and the ending felt like it should have been done over at least one more episode or maybe even two and seemed VERY rushed.  And while there is a conclusion (trying not to give spoilers for those like me who never saw the third season), and it does ""wrap up"" a major portion of the story, there are a lot of unanswered questions and things left up in the air so to speak...  Imagine if the Lord of the Ring movies had ended with Gollum falling in to the volcano, Frodo and Sam walking out, the Orc army just retreating, and then fade to black.  ""Finishes"" the main story line but leaves a lot open and unresolved doesn't it.  This isn't quite that bad, but you are still left wanting more.",1419206400,4,1924,4.201086956521739
