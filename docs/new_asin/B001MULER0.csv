8321832,3,B001MULER0,"This is an entertaining film, based (I think) on a book called ""Bienvenido, T&iacute;o Sam.""  However, I have a film club to whom I show movies every Wednesday night.  Although I speak Spanish, my guests cannot.  I really think the lack of subtitles should have been mentioned by the seller.
But if you know Spanish, I can recommend it.

8321833,5,B001MULER0,"When World War II is over, the news of the coming arrival of American ambassadors to a poor Spanish town creates crazy expectations among the peasants, who make long wish lists addressed to the foreign visitors, waiting to be touched by the ""economic miracle"". Up to this day this post-II World War black comedy, written by Luis Garca Berlanga and Juan Antonio Bardem is still achingly contemporary, for today people all over the world are still looking at the skies waiting for Superman to teach them the ""American way"" and UFOs to deliver them from misery.",1425081600,,558,4.822916666666667
8321834,5,B001MULER0,"Is it a western ( la Don Pablo, el alcade, who dreams at playing the cowboys versus sheriffs)? Or is it a movie about all dangers that come with these Americans (as Don Cosme, el cure, thinks, while expecting anyway a new church bell from those sinners)? Or is it a folkloric movie, with music and dances and hats and frocks and all that Andalusian stuff (with Carmen Vargas, la Reina de las canciones, leading the show)? Is it a historical movie about conquistadors ( la Don Louis, el cabalero)? Or is it maybe a neorealist movie ( la Bardem)? A black comedy ( la Berlanga)? Just a piece of fun (anonymous opinion)?

Well, many good things have been said about Bienvenido, Mister Marshall!. Let me add here my own share. First of all it's refreshing this movie, it was made with youthful enthusiasm, as both Berlanga (director and co-scenarist) and Bardem (co-scenarist) were barely twenty and something years old. One of them was twenty-one, the other twenty-two. It's the courage to make total mockery in the way only youngsters do. That mockery that's apparently mild, while not forgetting anything and anyone. And above mockery this movie is a piece of poetry, as both Berlanga and Bardem actually love these guys that are the target of their fun. These are poor guys, living in a universe of their own and judging the Americans expected to come and to give gifts  as belonging to a comparable universe, while the real distance is as of thousand years. And so these guys from Vinar del Rio are condemning the Americans (for not being Catholics, rather Protestants, or Indians that simply forgot they had been ruled sometime by Spanish Conquistadors), they are debating whether to accept the American gifts or not, eventually everyone dreaming at an American gift. Basically they care about Americans, the way they expect that also Americans do care for them. Only these Americans live in a universe too far to care. Oh, I know very well this sentiment of waiting for the Americans to come, it's not only restricted to Vinar del Rio, and it's not only restricted to 1953.",1421280000,,2075,4.761111111111111
8321835,4,B001MULER0,"Gentle, sometimes very funny political satire, somewhat reminiscent of the UK Ealing Studio films.

The poor, small Spanish town of Villar del Rio is abuzz with the  news that American officials are coming to visit,
and plan to show off their best face  in an effort to get their slice of the Marshall Plan pie. (Spain was actually
excluded from the funds).

While sometimes predictable, and sometimes badly post dubbed this is a fun film with just enough edge to look
at the darker side of human nature, but with a smile.

Frustratingly this classic of Spanish cinema isn't available on US DVD.  But if you can play region 2 discs,
this version has US subtitles, and looks pretty good, if not quite pristine.",1373068800,,709,4.67741935483871
8321836,5,B001MULER0,"Along these four decades of oppression in Spain, Garcia Berlanga as the rest of his colleagues had to deal against the official censure. That's why his scripts were always at the edge of the madness and unthinkable situations.

Welcome Mister Marshall's perhaps the most acidic film of the Fifties in what concerns the nature of the plot.

An isolated and forgotten village, in Spain in the middle of nowhere is informed about the plan Marshall will come to reconstruct their lives. And so, an impressive crowd of people is forced to get on the line in order to attend their personal necessities.

And so -as you may expect- a set of laughable events will take place. The civil authority wants to pay a little homage to the American delegation and decides to convert the village in a West town.

A funny, ingenious and unforgettable black comedy that will surprise you from start to finish.",1250640000,4,890,4.759740259740259
