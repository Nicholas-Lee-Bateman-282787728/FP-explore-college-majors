He followed it up with The New New Thing, a wonderful book about Silicon Graphics and Netscape founder Jim Clark. This video is based on a later book, and is a fascinating take on the Internet.
Lewis travels to Ireland to ask geriatrics downing Guinness how the Internet has changed their lives. He finds a medieval town with broadband cables under the cobblestones. He looks inside the control centre for AOL, where the ""elite"" keeping this Web site going look more like a bunch of stoners.
