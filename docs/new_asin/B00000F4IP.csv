7906684,5,B00000F4IP,This is the most classic hard to find Kiss concert. I Think that this concert should of been involved in the Kissology Box Sets. After Ace and Peter left Paul and Gene found two great members for Kiss and also the most classic concert to see the legendary Eric Carr play his heart out like he always did. He defenitly gave Kiss the back bone they needed. A classic concert like this deserves to be watched over and over again and I'm so glad I finally found it again.,1192838400,,467,4.258426966292135
7906685,5,B00000F4IP,"After years of putting up with crybabies (Ace and Peter) Gene and Paul finally found two musicians that were meant to be in KISS.  Eric Carr and Bruce Kulick were welcomed additions to the band and this video shows the world what the two of them could contribute to the band.

The concert was exciting and most of the songs were a bit more face paced than they were on the studio tracks.  That only made them better!  The band puts on a solid performance that is accented with awesome lighting and powerful solos (guitar, bass and drums) that just make you glad that the band survived the original member disasters that almost killed them.

This video is a must for KISS fans that don't hold a grudge about the makeup coming off.  The band looks like they are enjoying every minute of the show and you will too.",1174262400,,811,4.409395973154362
7906686,5,B00000F4IP,"It had been like 10 years or so since I last saw this video tape. But, one day I was digging into my old VHS tapes to see if I found something interesting, then I saw something that said ""KISS ANIMALIZE LIVE UNCENSORED"" and immediatly called my eye. I was excited for finding this video, that I remember to be so inspiring when I was in high school. I played it again, and again it blew my mind! This is the kind of stuff that rock n' roll is all about. This is KISS at the top, in every way you could mean it.

Everything Paul Stanley does here is so stylish, that makes any other frontman pale in comparison. The sound is so clean, flawless, powerful, the band working like a well-oiled war machine. Paul Stanley's voice is incredible here, sounding even better than in the studio albums. Also, I loved the song selection. No filler or important missing tracks here, it's just perfect. I just love the way KISS bringed old songs to a new sound in every tour they did.

My only question is why was this never released on LP, KCT or CD??? This live experience is better than Alive III (specially for the band members voice, in Alive III you can tell that years have gone by). Also, why is the DVD not available? I'd kill to get it.

This concert is a proof that reminds me why this band made me love rock n' roll. KISS! KISS! KISS! KISS! KISS!",1159574400,,1343,4.23828125
