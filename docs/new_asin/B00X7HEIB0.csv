7162493,5,B00X7HEIB0,"This show is one of the best British comedies to come along in a long time.  Ian McKellan and Derek Jacobi are amazing together, and the rest of the cast are perfect.  If you're looking for a show that will have you laughing over and over again, Vicious is definitely it!!  I bought Season One on iTunes and I find myself watching it over and over again!  I wish the seasons were longer, but they do things differently in Britain.  Regardless, I can't say enough about this amazing show!!",1439769600,14,488,4.438202247191011

Ash has a new girlfriend,Violet is married to a real user,Stuart is the top dancer,Freddie & Stuart go to the gym. Just truly adds to the happenings of series 1,everyone's still great friends/rank on each other. Plus another appearance of Stuart's mum!",1439683200,15,434,5.126760563380282

7162615,5,B00X7HEIB0,"Vicious 2 is definitely not for the faint hearted. You will scream with laughter at the adventures of Freddie and Stuart, and their friends. Ian McKellan and Derek Jacobi are superb as the stars. Both are at the top of their game, slinging one liners at each other so fast, you'll have to back up the DVD'S to get the lines at times. You'll definitely be able to enjoy this, with more than just one viewing. The story of two vicious old queens who live together has to be seen to be believed. It is mean spirited and cutting, but oh so funny. Frances De La Tour and Marcia Warren are real scene stealers. Not for the children, or for the narrow minded. Fans of bitchy gay humor will like this the most.",1445126400,2,702,4.285714285714286

7162623,5,B00X7HEIB0,"Vicious is one of the funniest comedies on TV or DVD-the only bad point is its only 1/2 hour long. The Cast is the best with Sir Ian McKellan and Derek Jacobi leading the cast. They play a couple who have been together for 50 years, who have a very up and down relationship . The humor is biting and very cutting but always funny. Can't say much more You have to see it to really enjoy it. Buy both seasons You wouldn't be let down. Can't wait for season 3. Its about time we had a show that was adult funny and not just potty humor. In fact write about it makes Me want to watch it again-Baffle Raffle over and out",1444694400,,615,4.008130081300813

7162633,5,B00X7HEIB0,"This show is totally about the characters, who are hilarious and endearing.  There are only 6 episodes in this season, but the last one is the very best in two years  I was laughing out loud practically the whole show.

The title of my review for Season 1 was In Your Face, Very Funny and About Time. This holds true for Season 2, also.  But, as others have noted, Ian McKellen, as Freddie Thornhill, is more likeable this season. The verbal barbs are still there, but the delivery is not as nasty. This means there are lots of good one-liners and guilty laughter.

Season 2 of Vicious originally aired in June 2015. Each episode is 26 minutes without commercials. The Bonus Features were originally broken up and aired a couple minutes at a time after each of the six episodes.  Production values are minimal, as most of the show is shot on not-elaborate stage sets in front of a live audience. For season 2, however, they do have a few short scenes added here and there which were filmed on the street.

In this season, we find out, among other things, that Violet's husband, Jasper, left her right after the honeymoon a few weeks before. Penelopes personality is expanded a bit, and we see that shes not always as oblivious as she seems.

In episode 4, Stuart asks, Did you ever think youd live to see the day?
Freddie: I wasn't even sure Id live to brush my teeth this morning. - a rare admission by Freddie that he is no longer young.

And episode 6, I repeat, is the funniest episode ever. My favorite line is Penelope, Im having such de ja vu. Wait til you watch the context.

Bonus Material: Commentators include Gary Janetti (producer and writer),  Ian McKellen, Derek Jacobi (plays Stuart Bixby), Gary Reich (producer), Marcia Warren (plays Penelope), Philip Voss (plays Mason), Iwan Rheon (plays Ash) and Frances de la Tour (plays Violet).
McKellen says Iwan Rheon is ""capable of being the nastiest in the world on Game of Thrones, and the sweetest guy in the world on Vicious.

Freddie and Stuart have been a big hit in America, and Ian McKellen and Derek Jacobi were co-Grand Marshals for the 2015 NYC Gay Pride Parade in June.

If you haven't seen Season 1, watching it first may make you better appreciate the sweet parts of Season 2:

7162635,5,B00X7HEIB0,"I was eagerly awaiting the release of the second season of ""Vicious"". And my expectations were fully met! I enjoyed watching the adventures of my favorite heroes. The second season is replete with jokes, a healthy cynicism, a story life with deep meaning and a developed plot. But of course, the cast in this series is just top class! Suffice it to mention the names of two prominent actors of our time: Sir Ian McKellan and Sir Derek Jacobi . They work well together in this film!",1443484800,,481,4.540229885057471

7162641,5,B00X7HEIB0,"First things first. If you aren't aware of it, you should know that Amazon groups all reviews of ALL formats of a film or TV series (including Amazon Instant streaming, DVD and BD) and posts them on all the formats. So, when reading a review, you should know the format the reviewer is discussing. This is a review of the DVD version.

Next, since this is Season 2, I will assume that all those reading this have seen Season One. (If not, head back to get acquainted with Stuart and Freddie. Now on to the review:

In my review of Season One I pointed that that I was sure there was a laugh track and it annoyed me quite a bit. What I think they did (similar to early episodes of The Big Bang Theory) was to enhance the live audience laughter. Anyway this season the laughter seems real  it is real, as youll see in one of the bonuses  except at the beginning and a few other scenes which were actually filmed outside on the street. Its annoying but it soon passes.

I do not like spoilers and I hope that other reviewers here don't give away some really important (and very funny) plot devices in this season. It REALLY spoils the fun  and there is fun for ALL the characters this time. Freddie is less mean this season  catty, yes, but not as mean as Season one. And this was planned by writer/creator/ executive producer Gary Janetti.

There are lots of expletives in each episode and these were bleeped for PBS showings. The DVD is the unexpurgated version.
Though the package says the DVd has running time of Approx 180 minutes, each of the six episodes (which form the whole second season) is only 22 minutes so the total running time is actually only 132 minutes. (so much for truth in advertising <g>). There are three bonuses on the DVD. First comes a making of featurette (7 minutes) with the cast and the production crew (and where youll see the audience I mentioned). Next is an interview with stars Ian McKellen and Derek Jacobi. (5 minutes) and finally an interview with Janetti. All include scenes from the show so DO NOT watch the bonues until after you have watched all the episodes. In summary, the bonues total about 15 minutes.

I don't want to tell you any more as it will really spoil the fun. If you at least liked Season one (yes, the over the top performances can be an acquired taste) Im sure youll love Season Two. And with the DVD, you can reply your favorite moments.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7162643,5,B00X7HEIB0,"Freddie and Stuart step out of the flat and into the world. This series takes a little longer to get rolling than series 1 but,  when it does, it's a freight train of laughs. Violet, Ash, Penelope and Mason are all in tow as the Boys come out of the flat and into various places like the gym, dance class and a clothing store. There is quite a bit of tenderness shown between the leading men and we even get a wedding at the end. There are 6 episodes and a FEW extras so hunker down for the night, grab a glass of wine and laugh at the super sharp wit and banter that make this show a keeper.

7162645,2,B00X7HEIB0,I just saw the first episode of the second season on PBS.  I am very sorry to say it has lost most of why I loved the first so much I watched it three to four times.  I loved the first because it was staged like a play.. few sets and no laugh track.  With the now added laugh track it tells the viewer that it is not funny enough to rely on the viewers reactions only.  They are right. The first episode of season two was not as funny as the ones from season one.  Pity.,1440374400,4,470,3.804123711340206
