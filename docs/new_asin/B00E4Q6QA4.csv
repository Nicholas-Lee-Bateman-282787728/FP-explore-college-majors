Even after three centuries, the music of Monteverdi glows with the passionate genius of a musical prophet.  He was far ahead of his day in his conception of music as a dramatic, expressive art, and in the realization of that conception.  The score of L'Orfeo, first printed in 1609, records the events of its first performance at the Mantuan court in 1607. A unique aspect of the score is the wealth of information about the development of the 'continuo orchestra'.  It is this combination - the human voice of Orfeo and the 'heavenly lyre' which accompanies him - which  established opera as an art form that continues to fascinate us today.  But beyond the enchantment of Orfeo's 'heavenly lyre', is the immediacy and truth of his human voice that rivets our attention and moves our hearts.

The opera begins with the character 'La Musica' the allegorical embodiment of music, presents herself to the princely company and announces a drama in which the power of music will occupy the center of the stage; it is the story of Orpheus who conquered the Underworld with his lyre and his singing.  As this 'fable in music'(as Monteverdi called it) unfolds, we are exposed to the entire gamut of emotions, from the most euphoric to the most dejected, presented in musical language that is perhaps closer to human speech the recitative has ever been, before or since.

The story of Orpheus has been done and redone by many composers through the centuries, although it remains essentially the same: Orfeo;s beloved Euridice dies and Orpheus goes into the Underworld to find her. He is escorted there by ""La Speranza"" (Hope), who leaves him at the gates of the Underworld to be met by Charon, the boatman who ferries him (albeit while sleeping) across the river to the realm of Pluto, where he pleads for Euridice's life. Moved by the singer's lament, Proserpine, Pluto's wife, convinces Pluto to allow Orpheus to take Euridice back, but with the condition that he not look back at her while she follows him,  or she will return to Death (what a silly condition!).  And, of course at her pleas for him to look at her, he losses her permanently.  Bu t in this version  Apollo, the father of Orpheus, comes down and invites his son to ascend with him into Heaven, where he will know joy and peace forever!  Not bad I Say! (I prefer Gluck's version in which Orpheus gets another chance and succeeds in getting Euridice returned to him).

All performers acquit themselves skillfully with the singers providing excellent characterizations, but why not for they are mostly all experienced in this genre:  ORFEO-John Mark Ainsley, EURIDICE-Jaunita Lascarro, LA MESSANGIERA-Brigitte Balleys, APOLLO -Russel Smythe, LA MUSICA -David Cordier, LA SPERANZA-Michael Chance, CARONTE-Mario Luperi.  Tragicomedia, the accompanying ensemble, also experienced, perform neatly and accurately.  The choral group Concerto Palatine provide spirited choral renditions throughout the  opera.  An intense and refreshing performance by an expert cast sustained by the lead John Mark Ainsley  directed with obvious affection by Stephen Stubbs, provides us with some great Monteverdi music.  The beautifully styled, evocative stage production, rich with Pierre Audi's trademark accentuates the solemn serenity of Monteverdi's most famous work to create a moving and timeless audio-visual experience.
