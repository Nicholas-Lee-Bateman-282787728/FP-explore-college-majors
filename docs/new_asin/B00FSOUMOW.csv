6031043,5,B00FSOUMOW,Great documentary on the effects of television on toddlers.  I had already seen enough to know I did not want my children to watch television but the information was so solid that I do not want them to ever deal with the barrage of brainwashing and control the television offers. I you watch a lot of TV get informed and watch this documentary.,1381881600,,344,4.4603174603174605

8618498,5,B00FSOUMOW,I have seen like documentaries on the effects of media and this one was condensed so well into one video. It isn't exhaustive but is perfect to heighten your awareness and realize the dangers of over exposure.,1381968000,,209,4.675675675675675

After following many films and lectures from little Light Studios, including ""The Replacement God's (excellent), and Controller Level 1 & 2 (wow), I decided to purchase Pseudology: The Art of Lying.  One thing I would like to point out about Little Light Studios, is that they do not ""preach"" anything specifically, but they do compare against what the verses of the Bible state.  Not even as much as to how to live a moral life, but just as to what people did to oppose God.

This is very effective to see how dramatic the opposition is to the design of the Bible instruction, when you look at the behavior of society.  Actually, for me personally, this was one of the major reasons that won me over to become a Christian and get baptized.  Why?  Because I started to notice that either the Bible was totally wrong, or the world was totally opposite of the Bible and therefore it was a conspiracy of major proportions.  I decided after over 10 years of research that, the Bible, which when followed has resulted for me in a highly beneficial experience of freedom from the world's addictive behaviors.  Even though when at first I expected the instructions to be very ""rule & regulation"" oriented.  I now have realized that it was the world's way that made me feel restricted and trapped.

Somewhere in all of this is the lie of more is better, and that I must satisfy my desires and love me first.  No...not anymore.  Now I pray that I can let go of the hold this world has on my mind and love others first (kind of like that guy Jesus said to do).

Anyway, thank you Little Light !!  Thank you for being honest and especially coming out of Hollywood and sharing the truth.  Your stuff is inspiring and amazing.  Anyone that wants the Truth...as a certain show used to say-

The Truth is Out There.

And with folks like Little Light leading the way, I hope more people realize it.

8618501,5,B00FSOUMOW,"I recommend this film to anyone who would like to retain control over his or her own mind. I have been aware of the impact of subliminal advertising for decades, however, this documentary shows how the media has taken mind manipulation to a whole new level.",1381881600,4,257,4.608695652173913
8618502,5,B00FSOUMOW,This documentary is very well done.  It is very factual on the effects of TV on children.  Also the effect that the industries that are trying to sell their products to the consumers is a real eye opener.  This is a must watch for parents.  I give it a two thumbs up.,1381881600,2,267,4.076923076923077
8618503,5,B00FSOUMOW,Learn how the entertainment and advertising industries are trying to shape and control you.  This DVD is extremely well done and is very revealing and disconcerting.,1381881600,,165,5.346153846153846
8618504,5,B00FSOUMOW,"Beautifully shot docco which shows in no uncertain terms how the television is used to manipulate you buying habits, your beliefs and even your morals.  The interviews were great, and I found this to be a very comprehensive look into this topic, without being preachy or self righteous.  This is a docco people of all faiths (or no faith) would get a lot of good info out of.
Can't recommend it enough.",1381881600,,402,4.569444444444445
