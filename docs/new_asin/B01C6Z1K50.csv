Typically, bootlegs will have more than English and/or Japanese audio, as well stickers with volume x-x on the cover. Furthermore, the U.S. uses TV-14 and TV-MA or Unrated in place of PG-13 and Rated R, respectively for animes.
===========================================================================================================

- Synopsis: The story heavily involves females being relocated to an isolated island due to their dangerous potential and abilities. This island has strict enforcement so as to set a good example showing that they may eventually be able to return to their former homes. After all, many of the girls live their daily lives with the hopes of one day returning home.

All the inhabitants of the island are females that boasts various combat strength and abilities. In order for those latent abilities to emerge, sexual pleasure is utilized to transform their partners into weapons for combat. This anime showcases the experiences of these girls as they struggle to readjust to their new lives on this isolated island.

- Analysis: This anime may only seem like an ecchi with no other purpose other than fan-service. Due to the amount of lust portrayed, this is true for the most part. However, with a carefully thought-out analysis, this anime addresses an interesting concept. Regardless if a person tends to be sadistic or masochistic, or if they consider themselves a hunter, or the prey.

It should be noted that among other things, this anime addresses this implication: Humans generally fall under two categories: their minds and/or personality either have them consisting of a dominating ego, or a submissive ego. In general, this applies to males and females, respectively. This is evident in this anime since typically one person pleasures the other while one receives it. A give-and-take relationship that alludes to one of the core principles of Full Metal Alchemist.

Furthermore, this anime has emphasis on the relationships and interactions of the characters. This may infer to the fact that life heavily revolves around relationships and that some things cannot be done alone. Possibly alluding to fundamental concepts addressed in Persona 4 The Animation, as well as BlazBlue: Alter Memory.

- Fan-service quality: This can range from sexual content involving the groping of body parts, stimulating tongue-kissing, pleasure-induced moans, rubbing and caressing of sensitive areas, boobs rubbing against each other, and more.

This makes Queen's Blade, Seikon no Qwaser, High School DxD, Cross Ange, Dragonar Academy, and Prison School seem like tame ecchi animes. This anime just barely manages to separate itself from being a hentai; despite the high amounts of stimulating lesbian sexual content in just about every episode.

- Conclusion: If you are looking for yuri hent...I mean a simple anime with extremely high amounts of fan-service such as Freezing, Cross Ange, Queen's Blade, etc., this is perfect! If you want something plot-heavy or don't like fan-service: Please avoid this anime.",1471996800,4,3161,5.4105691056910565

8752458,1,B01C6Z1K50,"I purchased a copy of Valkyrie Drive on eBay.com. I was not too happy with it, so I wanted to post this review to warn people about this product.

First: Valkyrie Drive is a Japanese anime.
Notice: The subtitles are only in Malay, Chinese and English. (Voices are in Japanese) There is no way to watch without subtitles.

Second: The packaging is strange.
Notice: The DVD is a very thin case (similar to the indie movie cases you might see at a Dollar Tree or a 99c store).
The case has two spaces for a one disc anime. (One on each side) 12 episodes on 1 DVD. NO OVA EPISODES.

Third: The quality.
Notice: It is a bit blurry and slightly blocky. Please refer to the screenshots I posted.

Fourth: A website?????
Normally, when you buy a copy of an anime, it'll mention a website on the back (like Funimation.com, etc.) and you can watch clips and read info about the anime. This one mentioned animationlv.com and this anime was not listed. (Odd...)

Maybe I am over thinking this, but I believe this version of Valkyrie Drive is bootlegged. If you don't mind the awful quality and don't care if it is a real copy, this product may be what you are looking for.",1467158400,9,1160,4.401869158878505
