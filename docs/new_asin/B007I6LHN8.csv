5088765,5,B007I6LHN8,"At long last I got to see this beautifully produced black/white/color documentary on the late Duke of Windsor.  It is beyond tragic that the world has gone from the Duke & Duchess of Windsor to the Kardashian family in my lifetime.  Can you imagine this couple in the same room with Kim and her family?  I daresay they would be civil to the inth degree as they chuckled under their breath.  Happily, they won't have to suffer this indignity.

This DVD contains film footage never seen by Americans unless they lived in England in the 30s and 40s.  There is very little screen time for the Duchess who speaks in a Southern/English accent mix.  As a Southerner myself, I remember what I sounded like returning to the States after living in London for a few years. It is natural for us to pick it up because our ancestors arrived in this country speaking this way. She looks so pretty in this presentation.  He looks so handsome and calm.

As he reads his Abdication speech for the camera, years after it happened, I expected him to break down at some point. He didn't.  Of course I don't know how many 'takes' they made while he read the lines.

It is an era that England will never see again.  The present day monarchy has this man to thank for so many things.  He opened up the royal family and made them human and approachable.  Had he remained King, WWII would have been quite different in scope. He was, after all, not only German in heritage but he thought highly of Herr Hitler.  Would the English be speaking German today?  One can only wonder.

His life is studied from birth to the time the film was made.  What he was put through in his childhood and young manhood is there for all to see.  It must have been so difficult at times seeing his friends leading normal lives with his so regimented and sterile. No wonder he broke loose in the 30s and dined and danced all over London.

It is sad to watch this wonderful film knowing how it all ends.  His wife is never recognized by the Royal Family.  They do not return to live in England.  They spend their last years in Paris just across the sea from the country of his birth and heritage. He was not allowed to contribute in any meaningful way to England. They spent their 35 years of marriage attending parties, entertaining celebrities in their homes, dining in expensive restaurants, and touring the world as exiles.  However, his was not a wasted life.  Before he abdicated the film will show you how much experience he did get as a ruler of the British people.  Before he died he would see the Sun set on the British Empire.  Something no one would think possible in the 20s and 30s.

As long as Queen Elizabeth II is alive the decorum and pomp will continue as it has for hundreds of years.  One wonders what the monarchy will look like 50 years from now.  Or if there will be a monarchy.  Perhaps, with global warming, the Island of England will disappear like Atlantis.  Gladly, I won't be here then.  Although, if I am reincarnated, perhaps I will be!

I waited decades and decades to finally see this wonderful film.  It was well worth the wait.  So well done. Hopefully, this film will be available for a long time to come. A true history lesson of the British monarchy.  I loved it.",1384992000,20,3253,4.424957841483979
5088766,5,B007I6LHN8,This film puts Edward VIII's thoughts & feelings in perspective. The film gave the viewe ra glimpse into their fabulous lives,1378080000,7,125,5.0
5088767,5,B007I6LHN8,"Narrated by Orson Welles, based on the actual book written by the former King and starring the King, himself. It is a great historical film footage of the life of the man who gave up the throne for the woman he loved.

It is great to see actual pictures and film of the man who had seven or eight titles in a lifetime, including King of England. Amazing picture of Queen Victoria holding her baby great-grandson with her son and grandson standing behind her. Four generations of those born to inherit the throne. Today, that would be the equivalent of Queen Elizabeth II holding her new baby great-grandson, George, with Charles and William standing behind her.

Amazed to find out what a thoughtful young boy, young man, young Prince he was and why he was so loved by England. Against his father's wishes, the young Prince refused to wear (honorary) military medals in front of his military comrades who were actually in battle during WWI. At times, he was embarrassed to wear silly costumes for public events, wondering what his shipmates would think.

He was handsome, athletic, caring, considerate, and an extremely popular ambassador-like figure who travelled extensively as part of his princely duties. He shook so many hands on his first trip to Canada, that he sorely hurt his hand but continued by using his left hand. The Americans adored him.

He traveled so much that it hardly left time for him to develop a close love relationship.  In the meantime, his favorite cousin and his brother get married while he continues to perform his ceremonial duties all alone.

It is a good film. It is nice to hear the man talk about his family, his duties, what he liked / disliked, his loneliness and his falling in love with Wallis Simpson.

She's in the film, too.  She tells how she begged him not to abdicate and how she'd leave him so that he wouldn't abdicate.

Very nice. What a love story.

I, personally, like to buy used DVDs or rent them but this one is worth the Amazon price, which by the way, has dropped since I first put it on my wish list. You can't rent it on Amazon Prime, so you might as well buy it.",1377907200,6,2121,4.557894736842106
5088768,4,B007I6LHN8,"On this is what the dramatization of the '70's is based, that is, ""Edward VIII and Mrs. Simpson.""  There are a few differences, however.  (Perhaps, York House is part of Sandringham.  Also, when the queen mother is mentioned,  it is confusing to know if they are talking  about Mary or Elizabeth.)  I am glad I have both DVDs..",1362960000,7,327,4.551724137931035
5088769,4,B007I6LHN8,Lots of actual footage in the film.  Good to have seen and heard the duke of Windsor giving his account of what happened.,1361491200,10,121,4.260869565217392
5088770,5,B007I6LHN8,"Ok, we all have them...our personal, private obsessions.  And the Duke and Duchess are mine.  This was a very interesting movie.  Even though I've read practically every book written about both of them, it was fascinating to see them come to life through the old news reels.  I'm glad I got to see this very historical work and I'm glad there are groups out there working to preserve these old movies in order to make them still-acessible to us 40 years later.  I'm a person who finds it hard to sit still for the length of a movie but this one felt like it was over in no time.  Highly recommended if  they are your obsession too.",1356134400,21,631,4.3418803418803416
8517319,5,B007I6LHN8,"I love historical footage and this DVD is chocked full of film going all the way back to Victoria's reign as the Duke of Windsor was seven when she died in 1901. In interviews with both the Duke and Duchess of Windsor we get inside of the romance of the century. Sadly, we also hear the Duke reread his abdication speech of 1936. There is no reference to any of the controversial WWII issues of his visits to Nazi Germany, rather the film concentrates on the love affair that shook England and the British Empire and brought George VI and later his daughter, Elizabeth to the throne.",1523232000,,583,4.457943925233645
8517320,4,B007I6LHN8,I have loved this story ever since I read the King's book  40 years ago. I try to collect all the films and books on them. For some reason there is a new fascination about the Duke and Duchess. Maybe since Madonna's movie WE. It was beautifully done but not this one.  Of course the footage was old but I thought it could have been better. That is why I took off a star.,1522281600,,370,3.9864864864864864
