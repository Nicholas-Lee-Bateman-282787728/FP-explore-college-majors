3798130,5,B001UE7CI8,"This DVD is very interestingly produced: there are two instruction types available for the sequences and poses, one very detailed, and another with less instructions. It is well-chaptered, with all the routine times indicated on the chapter menu, so this allows you to easily choose the routines you want to follow during your session. The different moves are well explained and executed. The shooting location is just wonderful and works well with Maral's very soothing voice. All in all, I liked the DVD very much, and think this is a great addition to anyone willing to get or improve their yoga technique.",1243382400,,609,4.980392156862745
3798131,5,B001UE7CI8,"I received this DVD as a gift.  I cannot say enough good about this DVD!!! It's invaluable for learning the poses & improving your form, especially for someone new to yoga.  I am truly impressed with the quality and time that went into the chapters.  The ""mini routines"" are great, you can choose what body part(s) you want or need to work for the day.  I have tried countless DVD's of all levels and this one is heads above ALL OF THEM.  The ""nature"" background is very soothing and relaxing. I HIGHLY recommend this DVD for those new to yoga.",1243382400,,544,4.4
3798132,5,B001UE7CI8,"This is a fantastic DVD for beginners. Her directions are explicit and she focuses on form, which I really like.  I love all of the choices for different types and lengths of workouts. The natural soundtrack is very calming as is the location of the shoot. I am also pleased with Maral's voice. That is an important aspect for me if I am going to listen to someone direct me for an hour and  half. I would recommend this DVD for anyone starting out, for those who have taken a break and are coming back into yoga, or for anyone just wanting a relaxed, calm yoga experience.",1243209600,,573,4.345794392523365
3798133,5,B001UE7CI8,"I recently tried Yoga for Beginners Flow for Everyone by Maral Hadidi. It was very relaxing and great for beginners. It has 30 Routines from Simple to Full Instructional (15 Simple and Short Routines and 15 Long and Detailed Routines). The simple routines hardly have any cueing at all so I felt like I had to open my eyes constantly and turn my head to see what she was doing next. I recommend starting with the Full Instructional routines first where she does cue everything that you are going to do next. Maral Hadidi cues very well. Also, the simple routines doesn't hold the poses as long as the full instructional routines. The Simple Routines range from 57mins to 108 mins. The Detailed Routines range from 105 mins to 182 mins. It also has Simple Sequence and Detailed Sequence where you can choose to do meditation for only 3 mins (Simple) or 10 mins (detailed). It is very nice menu. I love where it was filmed. You can hear the birds singing in the background making you feel like your doing Yoga outside. I enjoyed this Yoga DVD.",1243036800,2,1041,4.542553191489362
3798134,5,B001UE7CI8,"This is probably the most detailed beginning yoga dvd that I have ever seen.  It has over 3 hours of yoga that is suitable for everyone. Whether you are an absolute beginner or an experienced yogi looking for alignment tips, this dvd has it all.

I am an advanced beginner/intermediate yogini and I found the alignment instructions to be very, very invaluable.  Maral has a natural teaching style that is not overbearing in the least.

Setting: A beach canyon.  Very beautiful with the sound of nature.
Music:  There is none during the yoga sessions, just the sound of nature and Maral's voice in voice over.
Menu:  The menu is very detailed.  It is divided into Simple vs Detailed instructions organized in yoga chapters with times next to each chapter of poses.

There is:
* meditation-sitting/breathing/meditation which consists of ujayi breathing instruction and a short meditation.
*warm-up- cat/cow pose, side stretch standing forward bend
* basic standing poses 1 & 2 - side angle pose, triangle, wide angle forward bend, tree, warrior 1 &2 (all of the standing foundation poses one would find in a beginners yoga class
* hips -hero, reclining hero, cow face pose, butterfly, fire log.
*backbends - sphinx bridge, bow pose
*inversion dolphin, legs up the wall, shoulder stand, headstand
*twists seating and reclining twists.
I may have missed a pose or two, but the dvd covers all of the poses that one would see in a beginners anusara or iyengar yoga class.

All of the above poses are organized into chapters
Breathing/Meditation
Warmup
Standing poses level 1
Standing poses level 2
Backbends
hip openers
twists
inversions
savasana
neck stretches
In the detailed section, the poses (within the chapters)are held for very long times with lots of instruction.  In the simple section the poses are held for shorter times with minimal instruction. The time is listed for each chapter.

There is no matrix but there are short routines for each section. (see dvd description) with varying time lengths. You can select a chapter to work on, or do a routine.

Other details are audio sections with a FAQ's, What is yoga and Indian Kirtan (song selection from a Gobinda/Radna cd.

What I liked:
The detailed instruction was excellent.  Her teaching has a lot of anusara yoga elements to it.  As such it is a very heart centered approach. Even though I have been practicing yoga for awhile, I appreciated the detail.  This is a slow paced dvd, which is good for all.  Beginners will appreciate the pace and even those who are used to fast paced yoga wil like this pace for days when you want to slow down.  When I did the dvd this morning, I was recovering from a bad cold and used it more as a restorative practice.

What I didn't like:
This is a small quibble, but the simple instruction has too little cuing.  I found myself craning my neck to see what she was doing. In the simple section she just names the pose and by the time she names the pose, she is already in it or heading to a new pose.

I suggest that you do the detailed instruction first (time permitting) so that you know what's coming next as the cuing/editing in this section was a bit erractic or non-existent. For example, in the meditation section, they editing out the mantra meditation.  In savasana, they edited out the meditation.  Sometimes she was moving but there was no instruction.  Just little things that made the detailed instruction so tasty were editing out to  make the simple segments shorter.  There was way too much dead air.

One more thing, headstand at the wall (or in her case, at the rock) is included here and I personally don't think a beginner should attempt headstand on their own.  As such you couldn't see the placement of her hands, because her hair was in the way.  I think safer poses would have been half handstand or half forearm balance at the wall. Like I said small quibbles.  Not enough to change my 5 star rating.

Overall thoughts:
Excellent yoga dvd for everyone regardless of level.  You will definitely get something out of this.",1242864000,27,4043,4.738197424892704
3798135,5,B001UE7CI8,"If you are new to yoga or have some experience and wanted to make sure you are doing yoga correctly without hurting yourself or feeling disappointed because you are not feeling good after the practice, then this DVD is for you.  Even experience yogis will benefit.  Why?  Maral's DVD covers all the areas needed to build a great practice.  She will help you, encourage you, and make you smile as you are doing each pose.  Her love in helping you will be felt as she explains very clearly how each pose is done, and what to expect.  This is the next best thing to going to a yoga studio.  And when you do go to a yoga studio after watching Maral's DVD, and practicing, you will be amazed how your body, and mind is flowing with grace in the class.  Meaning, you are having fun, but also feeling more happier, healthier, and stronger.  The DVD has a great table of contents that helps you select what area of your body you will like to focus, and tells you how long it is going to take.  The location where this DVD was film will give you an inner peace as you see Maral guide you in each pose.  This DVD was created with the intention to share her love of yoga with you and experience a more happier life!",1236729600,6,1204,4.2368421052631575
8343474,1,B001UE7CI8,"Constant birds screeching throughout the entire video. I actually screamed out loud in frustration and shut it off. If you lower it to the point where it does not mutilate your ears, you can no longer hear what she is saying. This looked great. I am hugely disappointed and returning it all because of poor editing.",1460246400,,315,4.642857142857143
8343475,4,B001UE7CI8,I liked the versatility of this DVD. As a beginner I liked the way it was divided into sections. One section with more instruction and longer held poses and the other section shorter with less instruction. It was good to receive detailed alignment and breathing instruction. I have to rely solely on DVDs as where I live there are no teachers available. Recommended.,1334448000,,366,4.825396825396825
8343476,5,B001UE7CI8,"I have been practicing Kundilini yoga for four years. It has been excellent for me. However, my lower half is in need of some work. Although Kundilini Yoga had really done wonders for my shoulders, my arms and upper torso, along with breathing techiques I used in everyday chores like shoveling or raking it also saved my diminishing shoulder.
I have wanted to branch out. I tried Beginners Flow for Everyone. What drew me to it was the amount of workouts that are here. I saw there were instructions for hips! I had to have it. I really needed a hip opener! After all this time, I don't feel I have flexibility in my hip joints. I am of a small frame, and my hips were a great source of pain when I was pregnant. It can also tell me when its going to rain! As I get older I concern myself with further joint issues.
I am so glad I chose this DVD! Maral Hadidi is very easy to listen to. She is very soothing. Never carries a 'know-it-all' tone whilst bending into impossible moves. Instead,she educates me as I go. She guides me through each exersize gently. She lets me know if what I am doing or feeling is ok. She eases me into poses, guides me as if knowing what I may experience. She guides me through proper alignment so I am doing the pose correctly so as not to harm myself or waste my time. She reminds me to breathe properly. Reminds me I will get where I want to be in time and practice. Before I realize it, an hour of practice has gone by and I get a better nights sleep.
There is also a 'less instructive' side. For once I have learned the practice. Wish I had that option with my old DVD. The other great part is the calm demeanor throughout. Maral doesn't keep going on and on so you cannot really relax into your breath.
It really is like you have your own personal yoga teacher in your home. I look forward to becoming proficient enough to move onto intermediate with the next DVD
Enjoy!",1305331200,3,1906,4.239010989010989
8343477,5,B001UE7CI8,This is a versatile video that allows you to pick the level of detail in guidance through the poses. I prefer more detail and to hold the poses longer to really focus on alignment. It makes such a difference in my practice!,1279584000,,223,4.333333333333333
8343478,2,B001UE7CI8,"Thank goodness I ordered two begginer DVD's and actually liked one of them.  The menu for this DVD is hard to understand and the series' are very hard to follow.  They are all taped at different locations, etc and then all thrown together.  One 75 minute session jumps from the woods to the beach with no transition from the instructor.  She also doesn't give any modifications for harder poses or any encouragement along the way.  Most of the DVD is set in the wilderness, while it's a nice setting, the constant bird chirping and bugs making noises is less than ideal for me while doing something new and challenging.  I hate to complain, but these are my honest thoughts, I will more than likely be giving this DVD away and never popping it in again....",1270598400,,756,4.562962962962963
8343479,4,B001UE7CI8,"I found the atmosphere relaxing and something natural about Maral's style that wasn't overdone with effects.  I also liked her flows though I was looking for something a little more vinyasa or ashtanga -- it was slower than my usual styles.  I also find one hour a bit long for something that slow.  Perhaps better for someone more beginner than I.

Slight mixmatched moments in the video. Nothing to worry about, but I did notice it.

Sound track was decent and location was good.  The menu was decent too.

Again, I'd use it more often if the pace were a bit faster.",1266364800,,568,4.509803921568627
8343480,5,B001UE7CI8,"I love this DVD. I had done yoga in the past and wanted to start again. The DVD is divided with 2 different versions of all the segments. You can pick and choose the segments you want or do a flow they have designed for you. You can do a few minutes if you're short on time, or spend as long as you want by combining segments. There's no music, just the sound of trees and birds and the instructor's voice so if you want to add some of your own music you can. It's not fast yoga, but rather spends time in the poses to allow you to deepen and expand.

Having lost a lot of my flexibility in not working out, this is the perfect way to begin again. It's not ""beginner"" in the poses demonstrated but rather by allowing enough time for you to adapt the poses using blocks or other props. The instruction is nurturing and encouraging and emphasizes that you can just begin and the rest will come with practice. There is a lot to be said for deepening poses and allowing yourself the time to confront and adapt for where you are at the moment, to listen to yourself.

I bought several DVD's that reviewers deemed ""too slow"" or ""not aerobic enough"". I like this one the best. How did yoga become aerobic anyway?!",1248048000,3,1206,4.239130434782608
8343481,5,B001UE7CI8,"This terrific DVD has great scenery, pace, instruction and well-timed reminders.  I really appreciated the asana labels at the bottom of the screen as I'm just learning the names.  It definately helps to see the correct spellings.  The poses are held quite a bit longer than other beginner DVD's which I found helpful. There's no music which is refreshing since it can be somewhat distracting.  Instead there are natural sounds like bird calls. All in all this was a first class DVD.  Maral Hadidi is an excellent instructor and her calm voice is soothing. This DVD is an excellent buy and I will be using it often.",1244505600,,615,4.710280373831775
8343482,5,B001UE7CI8,"I am having back pain for quite some time. I took advice from my friend and started to pratice Yoga. I've searched over the web, then I found this DVD. It is truly amazing. It has FAQ's, mini sections, routines sections, etc. For a beginner like me, it is very easy to follow. If I have neck pain at the end of day, I can simply just practice ""neck Stretches"", if I have back pain, I would practice Backbends or twists, etc.. Now my back is getting much much better. The DVD also gives me a relaxing quiet time everyday from my busy life.

8343483,5,B001UE7CI8,"I currently teach yoga and even though I have been practicing for several years I find it is always a good idea to return to the basics with a beginner-level routine in order to take the time to revisit proper form. Many so-called beginner yoga routines are not for true beginners. Yoga: Beginners Flow For Everyone is, with one exception - the headstand portion of the inversion routine. Despite the fact that it is performed up against a ""wall"" (a wall of a rock outdoors), I believe the dolphin pose performed during the backbending segment would have been a better beginner option for headstand. Aside from that, the poses offered were very appropriate and taught with intelligent sequencing in mind.
Maral's instructions were very clear and she demonstrated the use of props for a majority of the poses. I liked the thorough pace and the breakdown of the sun salutation in modified form during the warmup (i.e. low lunges and bent-knee chaturangas).  Maral's teaching style is serene and uplifting. I enjoyed her voice and her cueing style. I particularly enjoyed her Hip Openers section where she demonstrated both an active and passive version of pigeon pose. I have only ever done the passive forward folded version. The active version had arms extended overhead with the line of energy of the body drawing up out of the legs though the belly on up to the hands. I was most impressed with her entry into Gomukhasana (cow-faced pose) from a cross-legged down dog. That's a new one to me!
The option to include both a detailed and a shorter, simplified narrative on the DVD is a great idea. I have yet to do all sections from both options but what I have done is great so far! I also like the option to do either individual segments or to do set routines.
The DVD also had a few audio portions that discussed yoga FAQs and information. I personally found these to be informative and recommend that those new to yoga explore these time and again as they journey through their yogic path. The DVD production quality is good and the scenery is beautiful. The locations include a gorgeous red-hued canyon with some trees and and a peaceful shoreline, possibly along the same rocky canyon. When I was following along with the video in my living room with the windows open I thought the birds I heard were coming from outside my house but they were actually in the video! The natural soundtrack was that crystal clear! It was soothing and did not detract one bit from the routine.
It is my belief that beginners and non-beginners alike would benefit from and enjoy the quality instruction of Yoga: Beginners Flow For Everyone. I will come back to this video again and again.",1243468800,9,2674,4.701492537313433
