Thought i would own it",1496448000,,64,3.3333333333333335
8520182,3,B007P636BW,"If you remember when the Sci Fi channel used to run it's Sci Fi Originals horror movie on Saturday nights, you're pretty much in the zone for where this movie falls. Low budget, with mixed acting, but nonetheless a pretty good creepy vibe and some fun jump scares, good enough to get over the paint-by-numbers plotline.",1454112000,,319,4.714285714285714
8520183,3,B007P636BW,"This movie is your typically haunted house flick.  A group of friends decide to explore a haunted house with a few of the members starting off skeptical.  Not long after, things start happening and people start dying.  Somehow everyone is surprised even though they were warned not to go into the house at night, not to call out the ghosts, and not to break anything.  Lo and behold, they manage to break all three of the rules.
That being said, I enjoyed the movie for the most part.  It is a lower budget film, but still gives you some good spooks.  The whole movie hints at the main character having some connection to the house, but come to find out it wasn't really a connection at all.  It was more of a mistaken identity.  I did find myself shocked at how the ending turned out with its little twist.  If you're into the horror genre, you will probably enjoy this movie even though it is not on par with some of the newer horror movies.  If horror really isn't your thing, this probably isn't the movie for you.",1446854400,,1018,4.367021276595745
8520184,4,B007P636BW,"Just watched this movie for a laugh since it was rated one star, but it surprised me. It wasn't the greatest, but it kept me on the edge and it did have some scary moments. I really enjoyed it. Worth a watch late at night.",1443830400,,222,3.9555555555555557
8520185,2,B007P636BW,"i once visited the Whaley House in Old Town, San Diego, which is why I ordered this DVD from Amazon. To say that I was disappointed is putting it mildly. The house in this film in no way resembles the actual Whaley House which was constructed with brick blocks, a startling new style in the 1850s.

Some of the references in the film to the house's history coincide with what the tour guide told us many years ago during our visit -- e.g., Yankee Jim was hanged on this spot and was so tall that his feet scraped the floor.

During a bonus extra on the DVD was a ""making of..."" short, the director mentioned being limited by the fact that they were filming in an historic site. Really?

It seems as though they could have filmed an exterior of the actual Whaley House from across the street with a telephoto lens, but perhaps the original house does not look spooky enough -- which might be true since it does not have a Gothic look to it.

On my blog and Facebook page some time ago, I listed my favorite top haunted house movies. Needless to add, this film would in no way make the list -- a list that includes THE UNINVITED (the original), THE HAUNTING (the original), and THE INNOCENTS (based on Henry James' TURN OF THE SCREW.  If you can, watch THE QUIET ONES instead, or, better yet, THE CONJURING, which is one of the better haunted house films in recent years.

In the first book of a paranormal e-book trilogy which I posted here on Amazon, I used the Whaley House as the setting for a scene, although I changed the name of the house. If you are in San Diego, check out the real Whaley House in Old Town and tell us what you think.",1415145600,5,1641,4.27741935483871
8520186,5,B007P636BW,It's never gonna win an oscar just like every other Asylum flick. But I worked as the key grip on this film and it's not have bad.,1409788800,,130,3.8518518518518516
8520187,3,B007P636BW,This is the kind of movie that was so stupid that I kind of liked it.  The special affects could of been better and the acting was not good. Low budget film.,1398124800,,157,3.90625
8520188,5,B007P636BW,"Finally, a ghost hunting crew that calls out the ghosts and gets real evidence. OUCH! I liked it, liked the flow and it just kept going enough to keep you entertained and at the edge.",1370476800,,183,4.257142857142857
8520189,1,B007P636BW,"As a former film student, and still aspiring filmmaker/screenwriter I must denounce this as the worst kind of crap film making I have ever seen. One star is being generous. Lousy acting, poor camera work, writing so bad as to be in the realm of the ridiculous. The ""psychic"" guy and his ghost hunter pal were the worst. A suggestion to the producers of this crap fest: get a day job.",1349136000,2,383,4.408450704225352
8520190,1,B007P636BW,"Ghost films don't get much worse than this. The acting, if you want to be generous, was so bad I thought this must be a spoof but it's not.
The film has low budget written all over it, I've seen better high school attempts than this.
YOu would think that some attempt had been made at a decent story, the writers have gone down the road of 'that'll do' at the first opportunity.
Really, don't waste your time with this rubbish. There are so many better films out there, like Paranormal Activity.",1344211200,5,495,4.391304347826087
