1980048,5,B000192W92,"Brothers Grimm stories are far less cutesy than we think.  This version is much closer to the original German story without being quite so grotesque.  It is certainly closer (and in a way more interesting) than Walt Disney's version.  I don't like the names for the dwarves (there Disney is at least more memorable).  The Dwarves are very good, led by Billy Barty.  Diana Rigg as the Queen must have loved doing this stuff.  She is to the hilt and just shy of over the top.  Delightful.  The King is okay, the 1st queen not so hot.  Young Snow White is just too precious, but the grown up heroine is very good.  The songs are okay to very good.  They aren't wonderful, but they don't jump out as awful either.",1151280000,2,709,4.376923076923077
1980049,5,B000192W92,"Legendary stars Billy Barty and Diana Rigg bring one of the world's most beloved fairy tales to life in the Cannon Movie Tale, ""Snow White."" Starring beautiful and charming Sarah Patterson (The Company of Wolves) in the title role as the princess who fled her wicked, jealous, and murderous stepmother's castle as a child, ""Snow White"" tells the tale of how the princess is taken in by seven kindly dwarfs living in a cottage in the forest. As the dwarfs go off to dig in their mines each day, Snow White cooks and keeps house for years, growing into a sweet and lovely young woman. But, as Snow White grows ever more beautiful, the evil queen grows ever more jealous. Consulting her magic mirror and book of spells for ways to terminate Snow White, the dwarfs must repeatedly undo her vicious magic. It seems the final spell is beyond even the dwarfs abilities to break though. Their only hope lies in a young prince who is returning home from a long journey still seeking a great discovery to satisfy the longing in his heart.

""Snow White"" sits among the best of the nine wonderful Cannon Movie Tales, which are among the best live-action fairy tale films available to date. Sticking more closely to the original stories from the Brothers Grimm, ""Snow White"" and the other Cannon tales mix in simple but fun-filled songs with fantastic casts and writing that blends realism and fantasy seamlessly. ""Snow White"" features some of the best songs in the lot, and it's clear that Diana Rigg really has a ball with her villainous role. It's so terrific that these childhood favorites many of us remember from the Disney Channel's 1980's and early 90's glory are finally available on DVD (most of them at least). The DVDs include trailers (not sure if these films ran anywhere theatrically), and ""Snow White"" is the only one of the four that I currently own that is presented in a letterbox format (though not much of one). The Cannon Movie Tales are mostly family fun, though be warned that some can have their scary moments (for example, ""Red Riding Hood,"" my favorite, is done as a werewolf story that at times may be a bit frightening). The other Cannon Movie Tales, all of which I highly recommend, are: Rumpelstiltskin, The Emperor's New Clothes, Red Riding Hood, Puss In Boots, Hansel and Gretel, Beauty and the Beast, The Frog Prince, and Sleeping Beauty. Those last two have not yet been released to DVD, and I have yet to see Rumpelstiltskin at any retail stores, though Amazon seems to carry it. I wish to get them all, but currently only own my favorites: Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Puss In Boots (starring Christopher Walken!), and Hansel and Gretel. Fairy tale fanatics should own all these films, and I also highly recommend my top favorites, the Disney animated versions. Also, for a scarier version of Snow White, pick up the outstanding, ""Snow White: A Tale of Terror,"" starring the beautiful Monica Keena. More recommendations: Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre collection (also best known from the Disney Channel airings), Shrek and Shrek 2, The Slipper and the Rose (for a live-action Cinderella), Ever After (another live-action Cinderella), The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996), Peter Pan (2003), The Wizard of Oz, Return to Oz, and Rodger's and Hammerstein's Cinderella (1965) among others!",1147996800,8,3313,4.853356890459364

Over the next 12 years I watched it so much I actually wore out the original tape that we used. I was extremely excited to see that I could buy it on DVD. It definately is a show worth watching.

1980053,5,B000192W92,"Diana Rigg is the Evil Queen in this Cannon Movie Tale musical based on the popular tale from the Brothers Grimm.

Here's the movie's description available from Sony Pictures: ""Mirror, mirror, on the wall...who's the fairest storybook heroine of them all? Snow White! Sarah Patterson (The Company of Wolves) stars as the fabled slumbering beauty while Emmy winner Diana Rigg (""The Avengers"") serves up some ""delicious comic villainy"" (Variety) as the wicked stepmother who's consumed by vanity in this thrilling live-action adaptation of the classic Brothers Grimm tale.

""After her jealous stepmother (Rigg), the queen, tries to have her killed, Snow White (Patterson) runs away into the forest, where she finds refuge with seven kindly dwarves. But when the queen discovers she's still alive, she decides to destroy her rival herself using clever disguises. Finally, a poisonous apple does the trick - or so she thinks - until the handsome prince arrives to save Snow White!""

The Cannon Movie Tale series of nine films has become nearly as popular among fairy tale enthusiasts and family film fans as Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre. Some would argue that this series is even more popular. Either way, these musicals are suitable for the entire family and feature well-known actors from the 1980s.",1117929600,14,1305,5.204761904761905
1980054,5,B000192W92,"When I first saw this wonderful film, I was a little kid in elementary school and there are parts of this movie that just stick with you and really stand out.  I am a HUGE fan of all of the cannon movie tales but this one is my favorite alongside Sleeping Beauty and Hansel and Gretel.  The music in this film is absolutely beautiful and the sets are awesome.  I especially love the segments when the queen is consulting her mirror.  Diana Rigg is brilliant in her role as the wicked queen and Nicola Stapleton really becomes the character of little Snow White.  The foreshadowing in this movie is very creative and while we all know the story of Snow White, this particular film delivers lots of surprises.  I especially love the first part of the film where we first discover the wicked queen standing in front of her mirror with all of the ladies in waiting fixing her up for a ball.  This part helps foreshadow the methods by which the queen will try to rid herself of Snow White.  A completely original and wonderful approach to a well known fairy tale.  Sarah Patterson as Snow White at age 16 really has all of the innocence and beauty to play the princess.  The dwarfs are very authentic and have the same charm that we have come to love from the more traditional versions of the story. Overall, this is a movie not to be missed.  It is not overly cute or sweet.  In fact, I believe the feeling of the film is quite dark but still enjoyable for the very young.  Watch for the surprise ending and you will see why this version really pulls out all of the stops to bring the fairy tale of Snow White to life!!!",1078272000,27,1616,4.32890365448505

1980066,5,B000192W92,"OMG nostalgia!!! I had watched this version about 1,000 times at my aunt's house when I was a little kid and she would babysit me. My cousins and I loved this version and I think we probably saw this before the Disney one honestly. They moved away when I was still young and throughout the rest of my life I had searched for this and asked people about it and NO ONE seemed to know what I was talking about. I started to think maybe I remembered it wrong or something. Finally one year when they came up for a visit I requested she bring her copy with her. (She just recorded it onto a VHS tape off of the t.v.) and I found out it was just called Snow White.

So then began my quest searching for it. Never did find it. Finally after almost a year of having Amazon Prime, which is my go to for EVERYTHING it seems, I thought, Amazon has everything, I'm going to search! Sure enough, they have it! I was going to order the physical DVD but the digital copy was cheaper and that way I don't have to worry about the kids scratching it or anything. Plus, I can watch it when we visit together with them if I want to without having to lug it if I go down to where they moved!

I've also heard that this version closely follows the original story. I guess the one and done with the poison apple wasn't how the story originally goes so if that's true, I found that very interesting!",1467158400,2,1375,4.126865671641791

Unbelivably enough, we still knew all the songs, even the words wich only shows that this movie really did an impression on us.

1980151,5,B000192W92,"Michael Berz wrote and directed this  excellent live-action film version of ""Snow White."" This version, which is very faithful to the original Brothers Grimm fairy-tale, is definitely one of the very best of the beloved Cannon Movie Tales Series.
  The film begins with the wandering Prince (the very handsome Ian James Wright) riding through a wintry forest. He soon discovers  the  glass coffin where Snow White (Sarah Patterson) is trapped in a sleeping curse. The Seven Dwarfs, led by Billy Barty as Iddy, are standing guard. Iddy tells the tale to the Prince in flashback.
  I love the early scenes where the Good Queen (Dorit Adi) and her Ladies In Waiting welcome the first snowfall of the season in song, foreshadowing the birth of Snow White. The Good Queen dies immediately after the infant Princess is introduced to the Kingdom. Subsequent scenes detail the loving relationship between little Snow White (Nicola Stapleton) and her adoring father The King (Douglas Sheldon).
  Diana Rigg is perfectly cast as the Evil Queen, who is immediately jealous of the King's attentions to Snow White. The infamous Magic Mirror, with several talking heads, including actor Julian Joy Chagrin, is depicted as more  threatening and omenous here than in other versions. The scene where Snow White first steps in front of the Mirror and speaks to it-- and it speaks and laughs at her-- is spooky; but  good spooky ;in a very  enthralling way.
  As in the original Brothers Grimm story, The Evil Queen orders that Snow White be killed when she is still a child. I  believe, in the original story, Snow White was only seven years old! Nicola Stapleton looks to be about nine or ten years old here. She, of course, escapes, and finds a new home in the cottage of the Seven Dwarfs. (We are told that, after Snow White is presumed dead, her devoted father abandoned his Kingdom and died in battle).
  In this version, the Dwarfs have the rhyming names of Iddy, Biddy, Kiddy, Diddy, Fitty, Gitty, and Liddy.  The Dwarfs, portrayed here as jolly Cockney chaps, essentially raise Snow White; as she grows from a child (Stapleton) into a lovely young lady (Patterson). They all sing a funny  song titled ""Every Day,"" describing how Snow White will soon be too tall to live in the tiny cottage and will have to leave.
  Diana Rigg has a grand time portraying the Evil Queen. I love how Rigg's hair and costumes become more outrageous and outlandish as the Queen's vanity increases. As in the original story, she attempts to kill Snow White three times; with a lace bodace, a poisoned comb, and, finally, the poisoned apple. I also love how Berz devised an ingenious and very appropriate punishment for the Evil Queen's wicked, wicked ways.
  This version is less cute and sweet than the Disney Version. The film is rated ""PG"" for some good spooky-scary scenes. However, it is much less dark and scary than ""Snow White: A Tale Of Terror,"" which, I believe, is Rated R!! This beautiful  version is faithful and fun.

What a waste of Diana Rigg's talent.  The seven dwarfs are probably the best characters in the movie, but even they can't save it.",1200873600,2,279,4.036363636363636
1980153,4,B000192W92,"It's very rare to have a screen version of SNOW WHITE that tries to stay faithful to the original Grimm Brothers fairytale.  This rendition, part of the fabulous Cannon MovieTales series, does tell the story with a faithful eye to the original material.

Young Snow White flees into the forest after her jealous stepmother the Queen (Diana Rigg) tries to have her killed.  The girl finds a safe haven with seven dwarfs, but her life is threatened once more when the Queen discovers her hiding-place.  After several thwarted attempts to kill her, the Queen conjures up a poisoned apple...

As in the original Grimm Brothers story, this version depicts the Queen in several disguises trying to kill Snow White, using a tight-fitting bodice, a poisoned Japanese hair-comb, and finally the poison apple.

Diana Rigg plays the evil Queen with relish.  Nicola Stapleton plays little Snow White, with Sarah Patterson (""The Company of Wolves"") playing the older incarnation.

The Cannon MovieTales series was filmed--rather economically--in Israel, where producers had access to a wide range of appropriate locations.  Most of the films have now found their way to DVD (the series also includes ""Hansel & Gretel"", ""Rumplestiltskin"", ""Sleeping Beauty"", ""The Frog Prince"", ""Red Riding Hood"", and ""Beauty & the Beast"").

1980154,4,B000192W92,"I have seen several version of the beloved fairytale and this has to be the best one i've seen. I enjoy the disney version but this one sticks to the origional grimm story. The queen gets snow white with the corset,the comb,and the apple. I also think the romance is more touching than the disney version and that is what i love about fairy tales. The songs are more catchy as well. I like ""everyday"",""the one i long for"",and ""let it snow"" I have seen this cannon movie tale and sleeping beauty and really enjoyed both and i recomend them to anyone who loves live action fairy tales or at all.",1169942400,,593,4.351351351351352
