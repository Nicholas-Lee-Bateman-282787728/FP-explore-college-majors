8030939,1,B0002S643M,"This is yet another shoddy Kultur production.  They gain access to very good productions and then do not bother to clean them up for present-day viewing, nor do they provide any liner notes.  I have vowed never to buy another Kultur production because I have been disappointed too many times in the past.  There are many companies that take pride in their productions.  Kultur does not seem to be one of them.",1167868800,6,409,4.638888888888889
8030940,4,B0002S643M,"It's a very good video, but take notice that this one completes the other released in 88' called ""opera favorites by puccini"". Except one thing: Aragall in Tosca, is not good on high notes, I will not say as usual. 111 min. Tosca, Boheme, Manon, Butterfly, Il Tabaro (?).Except for Boheme, the great arias are on the other video, but interesting. Other scenes from Strauss, Verdi...Look on internet for more details",1134691200,4,415,4.859154929577465
8030941,4,B0002S643M,"In addition to Puccini loves scenes, also included are scenes from Verdi, Strauss, and Offenbach, and various singers in addition to Placido Domingo and Kiri Te Kanawa.

Cotrubas and Shicoff are superb in La Boheme. Placido Domingo performs an energetic Kleinzach from Tales of Hoffman. There's also passion and great singing in Il Tabarro's couple, Giorgetta and Luigi.

This is like a box of chocolates: some selections are just okay, and several are delicious.",1101772800,4,463,5.243243243243243
