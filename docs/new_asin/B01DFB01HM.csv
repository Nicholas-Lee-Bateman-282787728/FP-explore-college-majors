7712105,5,B01DFB01HM,"I really liked this movie as a very young kid in the 60s. Apparently it's out of print so if you want it you will have to pay a LOT to get it. Buy it from GMK Toys like I did through Amazon for $25 instead of the other company for $100. This version is in Japanese only. However, ENGLISH SUBTITLES are INCLUDED.  If you are hoping to get an English dubbed version do not buy this as there is not one.  This movie is only spoken in Japanese with English subtitles. You cannot change the settings because there is not a title or menu screen.  You pop the DVD in, and the movie simply plays, no menu at all. But it is the Japanese original. If you like colorful 2:35 to 1 widescreen flicks (yes black bars will appear at the top and bottom of your screen) from the sixties and are a fan of Godzilla, get this.",1397779200,12,806,4.056603773584905
7712106,5,B01DFB01HM,Exactly what we wanted.  On time and the grandchildren will have what our children had -- NO CUSSING in a movie.,1395360000,2,112,4.333333333333333
7712107,5,B01DFB01HM,"Great movie! very good copy, a true classic ,nice edition too my G,  collection.now I must order the english version, along with a few more titles.",1379462400,2,147,4.653846153846154
8755841,5,B01DFB01HM,"The story it was good, father teaches his son to stand on his own feet. Of all the godzilla films, I didn't see why this film wasn't in the stores. Now except one ,  I have the whole collection. The only thing I didn't like about the film, was there no real action-fighting scenes.",1521158400,,281,4.203703703703703
8755842,1,B01DFB01HM,Clearly a bootleg. Recorded on a DVD-R and naturally won't play on a regular DVD Player. Avoid this product and the seller.,1516838400,2,123,4.636363636363637
8755843,3,B01DFB01HM,"This is a good option for people who don't want to pay out the nose to complete their collection, but it's also overpriced. Hint: Sumo Gorilla or Showa video.

Until this one and Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla get picked up by a company that's interested in re-releasing them, the pickings are going to be pretty slim, but this is a serviceable DVD that will give Godzilla fans what they want. I'm not going to bother reviewing the movie, you know what you're getting into if you're on this page. Just make sure to do a little shopping around first.",1515715200,,545,4.561224489795919

8755849,5,B01DFB01HM,"Every copy I have ever seen started on the beach then showed the island. This one starts in a plane flying over the ocean during a rain storm. The sub titles are easy to read, and the rest os the movie is a stomp fest. I love it and now I have only 1 more movie left to get to compleat my collection.... well 2 if you count the new one.",1401408000,5,336,3.7464788732394365
