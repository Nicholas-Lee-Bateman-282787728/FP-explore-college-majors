1527494,4,B00005JNHS,"I recently purchased the McMillan & Wife Season One DVD set. While I am very happy that these shows are now available on DVD, I must say that I am EXTREMELY disappointed that the original main title is not included. Fans of the original run will recall a one-minute opening sequence where a man is walking at dusk with a flashlight. Within the ""light,"" you could see images of the various mystery movie characters (McMillan, Sally McMillan, Columbo, McCloud)in various colors. The song entitled ""The Mystery Movie Theme"" was by Henry Mancini and had a catchy whistling as part of the orchestration. This is one of my all-time favorite main titles (the visual component was by Wayne Fitzgerald). I will ask that Universal will include the original main title in future releases of the NBC Mystery Movies on DVD.",1124496000,10,810,4.83453237410072

No extras are provided, nor are there any additional flyers inside the package. Fans of the show will be very pleased nonetheless.

1527497,5,B00005JNHS,"In August 2005, Universal will finally release some long-overdue programs of that '70s mainstay, the NBC Mystery Movie.  Tell me you can't hear that whistling theme song in your mind as you read those words!

In March 2005, season one of the most famous Mystery Movie, Columbo, was released.  Clearly, Columbo is still popular, as this release was quickly followed with season two.  In August, season three of Columbo makes it to DVD, along with (finally!) season one of both McCloud and McMillan and Wife.  For the first time in DECADES, we can see these detective shows UNCUT and COMMERCIAL-FREE.  This is great news for fans of terrific '70s TV!

Season one of McMillan and Wife consists of one two-hour pilot, ONCE UPON A DEAD MAN, and seven episodes, each 90 minutes long (73 minutes sans commercials).  The episodes originally aired from Sep. '71 - Mar. '72, and their titles are:

MURDER BY THE BARREL (directed by John ""Gomez Addams"" Astin!)
A barrel contains dishes, then a body, then the body disappears.

THE EASY SUNDAY MURDER CASE
A woman's husband and dog are both kidnapped.

HUSBANDS, WIVES, AND KILLERS

DEATH IS A SEVEN POINT FAVORITE
A mysterious note is discovered inside a football.

THE FACE OF MURDER
Sally is targeted for murder by a jewel thief.

TIL DEATH DO US PART
Mac and Sally are sealed in their home to be fumigated to death.

AN ELEMENTARY CASE OF MURDER
An old flame of Mac's comes back into his life.

1527720,5,B00005JNHS,"By the early 1970's Rock Hudson's film career had pretty much stalled. Like many actors he decided to concentrate on television as that was where the work was and the money was big. Universal, his old film studio, offered him a series called ""McMillan and Wife"" where he played Stewart Mcmillan, a San Francisco police commisioner who solved crimes with his beautiful dark-haired wife Sally, portrayed by Susan Saint James. The series was actually the forerunner for the Stephanie Powers/Robert Wagner crime drama ""Hart to Hart"", and like the former what made ""McMillan and Wife"" work was the chemistry between the stars.

 The series was actually a telefilm (airing in 90 minutes installments) that aired as part of the powerful ""NBC Mystery Movie"" on a rotating basis with others including ""Columbo"" and ""McCloud"". ""McMillan and Wife"" actually became the most popular airing for an impressive six seasons.

 Rock Hudson would state he hated doing the series because he felt it was a step down from his film career and the scripts were less than Oscar worthy. However, he and Saint James remained friends until the day he died and most audiences remember his television career because of this project.

 Character actress Nancy Walker had a cute supporting role playing the McMillan's housekeeper Mildred.

 The first three seasons of ""McMillan and Wife"" are available on DVD and more are sure to follow. However, there are no bonus features.

 The following is a list of ""McMillan and Wife's"" episodes along with their airdates:

1. ""Once Upon a Dead Man"", Sept. 17, 1971
2. ""Murder by the Barrel"", Sept. 29, 1971
3. ""The Easy Sunday Muder Case"", Oct. 20, 1971
4. ""Husbands, Wives, and Killers"", Nov. 10, 1971
5. ""Death is a Seven Point Favorite"", Dec. 8, 1971
6. ""The Face of Murder"", Jan. 5, 1972
7. ""'Til Death Do Us Part"", Feb. 16, 1972
8. ""An Elementary Case of Murder"", March 1, 1972",1299888000,4,1891,4.859813084112149
1527721,4,B00005JNHS,"Debuting in 1971, MCMILLAN AND WIFE was originally part of the NBC Mystery Movie, a ""wheel"" series which rotated installments of MCMILLAN AND WIFE with episodes of MCCLOUD and COLUMBO.  Although COLUMBO is easily the best recalled today, all three of the titles were extremely successful throughout the 1970s, with new episodes of COLUMBO airing as recently as 2003, MCCLOUD continuing through 1977, and MCMILLAN AND WIFE continuing through 1976, when it underwent a major adaptation and then continued for another year as MCMILLAN.

COLUMBO, which starred Peter Falk, had a unique format.  MCCLOUD, which starred Dennis Weaver, tended toward action.  MCMILLAN AND WIFE was frothy and fell into the genre of mystery-comedy, a difficult style to carry but which benefited here from stars that knew how to play out the flyweight scripts and who had tremendous chemistry.  Rock Hudson, of course, had been a major star since the 1950s, and he was certainly no slouch when it came to romantic comedy; films such as PILLOW TALK are classics of their kind.  Susan St. James, who was about twenty years his junior, had scored with the 1960s series THE NAME OF THE GAME.  They were exceptionally well supported by Nancy Walker, a notable commedianne, and John Shuck, a relatively new face who would continue as a major character character on stage, screen, and television.

Each episode ran approximately ninety minutes (all the NBC Mystery Movie series were ""feature length"") and most followed a certain formula.  McMillan (Hudson) is Police Commissioner of glamourous San Franciso and is married to socialite Sally (Saint James)--who has a knack for embroiling herself in his cases.  Many of the cases arise from the McMillan's own social circle, with McMillan either on the scene of the crime when it occurs or called in to deal with the San Franciso upper crust.  Sally, who is smart but daffy, complicates matters by accidentally stumbling upon clues and accidentally putting herself in harm's way, up to and including being held at gun point, being attacked with a rapier, and being kidnapped.  McMillan is supported by his trusty junior, Sgt. Enright (Shuck) while Sally augmented by hard drinking housekeeper Mildred (Nancy Walker.)  The first season features a number of guest stars, ranging from Claude Akins to Jackie Coogan to June Havoc.

Although the cast plays everything with an expert twinkle, the quality of the episodes vary a great deal.  Some are truly enjoyable from start to finish--""Murder By The Barrell"" is a good example, with Sally discovering an unknown body in a packing crate.  Others, however, are as off the mark as an Ed Wood movie, with ""Easy Sunday Murder Case"" jaw-droppingly ridiculous (June Havoc gives an especially awful performance.)  Ironically, given their on-screen chemistry, in private life Hudson and St. James were not impressed with each other, and their off-screen relationship was often tense.  Hudson despised the series, which he considered beneath him.  Even so, he was enthusiastic enough about the project to allow the pilot episode to be filmed in his home.  Those really are his blood red carpets, mirrored walls, and dark pannelling, and fans of the star will enjoy a glimpse into his inner sanctum.

MCMILLAN AND WIFE has often been compared to THE THIN MAN series of the 1930s and 1940s, which starred William Powell and Myrna Loy.  There is considerable reason for this: Hudson and St. James have tremendous chemistry, the characters emphasize charm and humor, and the series is even set in San Franciso--and now and then there is a scene that actually imitates a scene from one of THE THIN MAN movies.  Unfortunately, it lacks the same edge.  Seen today the scripts and stories have a knocked-together and trivial quality; it is easy to understand Hudson's complaints about the series.  Ultimately, one is left with the chemistry between the players and the nostalgic pleasures of the costumes, sets, and occasional on-location footage that are so very evocative of the era.  Norah Charles may have had screwy hats, but Sally McMillan gets mini-skirts and a then-fashionable chocolate-brown refrigerator.

Episodes included in season one are the pilot; Murder by the Barrel; The Easy Sunday Murder Case; Husband, Wives, and Killers; Death is a Seven Point Favorite; The Face of Murder; Til Death Do Us Part; and An Elementary Case of Murder.  Since the episodes vary a great deal, it is difficult to know how to rate them.  I'm giving them two stars for star power and two stars for the nostalgia factor.  Why not?  It's all good fun.

This is an updated Nick and Nora Charles and Mr. and Mrs. North put together with Hudson's charm and Saint James' sweet humor.  Can't wait to see season two!  Every episode is different -- no predictable, pat formula plots -- an outstanding chase scene in first episode.

1527724,5,B00005JNHS,"I hadn't ever heard of this show but was running out of the good old 70's shows I love.  I went back and forth...no reviews, never heard of it, no other seasons released...UGH.

I really loved this show from the first episode.  Some of the older shows that I never saw before, it takes a couple episodes before I know if I really want to watch the whole thing but this is one of those I had to purposely stretch out since I knew there weren't anymore episodes available.

The acting is great, the mysteries are good, creepy enough without today's assault of gore. I like today's mystery/crime/dramas but when I watch them from the 60's and 70's, even some from the 80's, I like tat the stories and characters are the focus and strength of the shows more than the blood and guts and violence and ""shock factor"" of today's shows which seem to sometimes add so much for shock value that there isn't a whole lot of time left for character and story development.  It's not so obvious until you watch a bunch of old mystery/crime/dramas and realize that because of moral differences and/or FCC regulation at the time, they actually had to write a full and complete story with well-developed characters because there were no HD graphics, computer generated scenery, and shock value tactics to fall back on/depend on/write around.

Of course, the clothes, language, hair, makeup, etc are all classic 70's but not campy or cheesy.  I don't mind the campy and cheesy but sometimes it's a bit distracting in some of the old shows.  This one just seemed all about the mystery/crime/relationships of the characters and I loved it.  Also without all the camp/cheese, it reminded me of my early, early childhood and the old photos of my parents in those wonderfully identifiable 70's clothes and hair.

A great show that leads to further frustration in the dvd market when there are no further episodes available and the companies that release older shows seem to have no interest in putting out complete series in any decent amount of time - or ever.  They throw out half a season here, a full season there, and then quit or back-burner it for 3 yrs and then put out a bit more - or something else entirely.

Great shows, well-worth the money and time to watch, would absolutely buy the rest if it was out.

In addition to the primary McMillan and Wife - McMillan's sidekick/driver/detective is freakin' hilarious, dry humor, deadpan facial expressions, really enjoyable.",1270080000,3,2457,4.712616822429907
1527785,5,B00005JNHS,"Of all the major studios to release movies and television series on DVD, Universal has had, by far, the most problems with defective disks i.e. freeze-ups, skips in scenes, or even to a completely different part of the program. The blame here rests almost entirely with Universal's insistence(until recently)on stamping all the sounds and images onto double-sided disks. This is a difficult manufacturing process involving four different encoding stages, with the latter steps often leaving physical damage to the earliest ones. 20th Century Fox also prefers two-sided disks, but oddly, has not experienced problems to the extent that Universal has. Both Warner Bros. and CBS/Paramount use only single-sided disks, and I am happy to report that of the hundreds of Warner-Paramount titles in my library, NOT ONE has ever given me a problem!

  It is impossible to tell if a disk is defective, merely by visual inspection. A badly scratched disk may play just fine, while one you can see your reflection in may skip all over the map. Nor is there any way to tell when buying a disk(s) whether or not you have also bought yourself a load of trouble.

  The safest advice is to only buy DVDs new from a reputable dealer. Then, if they are defective, at least you can bring it back for an exchange or refund. Avoid used copies in mint condition. Why on earth would the previous owner give it up(I should talk. I just bought a mint, used McMillan & Wife. Look for a future update!)?

  You might also consider upgrading your DVD player to a more high-end model. Expensive or well-engineered units often have circuitry that can compensate for defects in the disks. Ask around, or read Amazon's customer reviews before making a final decision. I've also recently discovered a trick that works well and doesn't cost a cent: As soon as problems begin to rear their ugly heads, press the ""Eject"" button (not the ""Stop"" ), and remove the disk. Spin it slightly and then place it back on the tray and reload. With most DVD players, the action usually picks up right where it left off, and in some 70% of the cases, I've found, this does the trick, and there are no more hick-ups (At least for awhile). Its especially helpful with DVD-Rs. However, in the case of those blasted Universal two-sided abortions, all bets are off!",1263600000,13,2311,4.771929824561403

1527787,5,B00005JNHS,"I bought the MCMILLAN & WIFE SEASON ONE DVD set because it was on sale here on Amazon. Although I only remembered bits and pieces of the series, so I wasn't a fan by any stretch, I decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did.

The story lines are fun and interesting to watch, and there are great shots of San Francisco, CA, in the background. I love watching retro movie or television shows that show real background shots and ""McMillan & Wife"" does not disappoint. The retro clothes and hairstyles also give this series a charm not unlike comfort food.

Basically the story revolves around Stewart ""Mac"" McMillan (Rock Hudson), an attorney who gets appointed to SF police commissioner, and his newlywed wife Sally (Susan Saint James), whose deceased father was also a police commissioner(?) or some other highly respected law enforcement individual and so she inherited his gift of solving mysteries. Together they solve the various cases that come across the commissioner's desk.

Chemistry wise, Hudson and Saint James are great together. Both play convincing newlyweds and have great rapport joking and sharing affection with each other. Saint James was superbly cast as Hudson's wife and even after having the 20/20 hindsight of Hudson's personal life, they both still come off as convincing lovers and stuff.

Nancy Walker, who plays ""Mildred"" the McMillan's maid, and John Schuck, who plays McMillan's side-kick ""Sergeant Charles Enright,"" provide great supporting roles.

Each episode lasts over one-hour and there are eight episodes altogether on 2-double sided DVDs. The DVD clamshell package contains each episode's synopsis and original air date.

Unfortunately there aren't any special features on the DVDs. Anyway, if you like detective shows, mysteries, and retro TV shows then you'll love MCMILLAN & WIFE SEASON ONE and make it part of your collection. Can't wait for Season 2!",1255046400,5,1894,5.093548387096774

""McMillian and Wife"" is like those movies except for the crime solving element and with Susan Saint James in place of Doris Day. That would make Sargeant Enright (John Schuck) the Tony Randall in Rock's debut TV series. My reason for making my purchase is that ""McMillian and Wife"" has two things in it I really like to watch in a mystery series. One is humor with such things as congested traffic, a coffee machine and a water fountain. The other is being that since this show was made in the pre-CSI era, the violence is suggested. The idea someone has been murdered comes across without graphic details.

1527857,4,B00005JNHS,"Part of NBC's diverse Mystery Movie lineup, McMillan and Wife chronicles the crime solving adventures of San Francisco Police Commissioner Stuart `Mac' McMillan (Rock Hudson), and his lovely bride Sally (Susan St. James).

Hudson, with a background in romantic comedies, is a pretty smooth fit with the perky St. James, some 21 years his junior, and already an Emmy award winner.  Crime solving is a joint venture, built around the charm and flirtatious chemistry of the couple.  `Mac', is generally low key and deliberate, yet capable of quickly springing into action.  Fashion freaks may get a kick from Sally's wardrobe, and the 70's dcor.  The pair is aided by police Sgt. Enright (John Shuck), and the McMillan's sharp-tongued and abrasive housekeeper, Mildred (Nancy Walker).

This unique duo is appropriately confronted with some unconventional and peculiar crimes, mostly centered in high society circles.  The stories hold together pretty well, though at times things get ridiculous, when action is stressed over logic, or when the writers try to get too cute.  This set contains eight episodes on two double-sided discs.  Among the more notable are . . .

Once Upon a Dead Man: Things get off to a good start in the series pilot.  An Egyptian sarcophagus mysteriously disappears at an art gallery auction, where Mac and Sally are present.  Both McMillans are soon involved in the case, and the body count starts to rise.  An impressive highlight is a wild, and scary bike chase through the hilly streets of the city.  Guest stars include Jack Albertson, Jonathan Harris, Kurt Kasznar, Herb Edelman, Rene Auberjonois and James Wainwright.

Death Is a Seven Point Favorite: Stories associated with pro football were `in' at the time, and while this one about sports gambling doesn't make much sense, it is a lot of fun.  Don Stroud, usually known for playing a heavy, goes against the grain as a quarterback under pressure from more than a pass rush.  Andrew Duggan gives an enjoyable, over the top performance as the team owner.  However the most humorous situation involves Sgt. Enright, who gets a striking new hairdo.  Sally sometimes slept in a red football jersey, with the number 18, reminiscent of then 49ers star receiver and future NFL bigwig, Gene Washington.  In this fluffy nonsense, Sally finds herself both on the field during a game, and then running for her life in an empty stadium.

Til Death Do Us Part: A psycho serial killer has his sights on the McMillans, and sets an elaborate scheme in motion.  The method of their demise is original, but not very credible.  The McMillan residence is tented for fumigation.  With the couple trapped inside, poison gas is pumped in.  The killer has removed all sharp implements, so they are unable to cut their way out.  Why not just crawl out from under the covering?  What is far more interesting is Sgt. Enright's love life, as he is off on a weekend trip with a lovely fashion model.  Who knew?

An Elementary Case of Murder: In the last episode of the season, we learn that Sally is pregnant.  Mac is in an interesting situation, as an old flame, singer Lee Richards, played by singer/actress Barbara McNair, is a suspect in her husband's disappearance.  McNair is black, and her character Richards, supposedly was romantically involved with Mac some 12 years earlier, which would make it around 1960, when an interracial relationship might have raised a few eyebrows.  These potentially controversial matters do not surface.  The story is actually quite good, as Mac is torn between his feelings for a friend, and the facts of the case.

Subsequent real life events, may make viewing even more interesting.  Rock Hudson, a homosexual, was one of the first public figures to be recognized as having HIV in the 80's.  San Francisco, is where Hudson was rumored to have pursued a gay lifestyle in his later years.  Sadly, he may be remembered more for how he died and the aftermath regarding his estate, rather than for his long distinguished acting career.  Contrary to what was portrayed in front of the camera, Hudson apparently had less than warm feelings for costar Susan Saint James.  Given this, it is quite ironic, how much the couple's affection for each other, and Mac's appeal to women in general, was emphasized.  Besides the frequent smooching and romantic interludes with Sally, Mac was also constantly running into beautiful women from his past that are attracted to him.

Susan St. James seems to have little to say about her costar.  She had another hit series, `Kate and Allie' in the 80's, and married TV executive Dick Ebersole.  She tragically lost one of her sons in a plane crash in 2004, in which Ebersole and another son were also injured.  Putting aside the off screen matters, McMillan and Wife has its flaws, but is pretty entertaining, particularly if husband and wife crime solving teams appeal to you.",1203206400,4,4902,4.918392204628502
1527858,4,B00005JNHS,"McMillan and Wife was part of NBC's Sunday night Mystery Movie series during the 70's, alternating with Colombo and McCloud. All series were great, but McMillan and Wife is my favorite. A great mystery set in my favorite city, San Francisco with subtle humor and a good partnership/marriage between Mac and Sally (Rock Hudson & Susan Saint James). The stories were inventive and fresh. The more SF Police Commissioner Mac told Sally not to get involved with his cases, the more she became - with her natural nack for following even the most obscure clues.

Well, so much for that...and yes, I get a few odd chuckles when I say it now, but I am still looking for that perfect Sally.

1527862,1,B00005JNHS,"The original ""McMillan & Wife""--a wonderful TV-movie series along the lines of ""The Thin Man"" films--included only 36 episodes (not counting the few dull ""McMillan"" outings after Susan St. James departed). So why did Universal decide to issue this cheaply produced ""season one"" set?

Blank DVDs and plastic cases cost pennies--there's no valid financial reason for any production company to put out double-sided disks. All the complaints about defective disks have hurt sales. And if sales are slow, Universal will abandon the project, leaving those who did buy with only a fraction of the series in their libraries.

It would have been smarter to issue a well-made box set of the entire series--perhaps including a new interview with St. James--and charge a premium price. I'm willing to pay more to get the entire series in good condition. But I'm not willing to pay $25 or $30 for skipping disks when I know the rest of the series may not be released.",1189814400,21,954,4.919254658385094

Nancy Walker as the McMillan's wisecracking maid and John Schuck as Stewart's not-so-bright assistant, play comedic foil to the couples amusing-but-cute domestic squabbles and sleuthing.

As San Francisco Police Commissioner Stuart McMillan, Hudson - his film career by then in decline - paired with on-screen wife Saint James and their stand-up comedic and nosy maid (the late Nancy Walker) for a series that, at least for a couple of hours once a week, took us away from all the unrest in the real world. By contemporary standards, the series is clearly dated (Hudson with a toolbar mustache and Saint James with bell-bottoms and a shag hairdo) and is undeniably light fare. Who cared when the flimsy plots were more than compensated by the guest apperances of some of Hollywood's elite at the time? Among the plots in this freshman season are  McMillan and wife trapped in their own home and ready to be literally gassed to death, an old flame of McMillan's returning with something more than fond memories in mind and a professional football quarterback targeted for murder. Arguably, Hudson might have been at his pinnacle best here but, if post-AIDS biographies, books et al are to be believed, Hudson so detested the series that he reportedly drank himself into obvilion watching himself every Sunday night. For Saint James, though, the series was her springboard to even greater fame, a decade later, in ""Kate and Allie.""

Watching the show brings back fond memories of watching with mom, but also of the effervescent Susan St. James, the bitingly funny Nancy Walker, endearing John Schuck and of course the ultra-cool and patient Rock Hudson as the commissioner.

I'll have to echo the comments already aired here about the lack of any special features or inserts. What gives here? Also, the dual layer DVD's are a real drag. How about a little more substance for the season two set, Universal? Don't be so cheap!

Finally, you've got to add in the Mystery Movie whistle theme...

Love the show, so glad to see the DVD's. Let's go Season Two!

PS: Having watched the entire season now, I found a hidden episode with Claude Akins. It's not documented on the DVD packaging, probably because the last 20 minutes are riddled with DVD skips. This episode has Mac and Sally visiting Palm Springs to play golf with Mac's old buddy played by Claude. On the way back in the private plane they're in, the pilot gets shot and Mac has to land the plane in the middle of nowhere. No explanation of how they find a phone, but hey, that's okay. It's still cute, if you can stand the skips at the end. I found it by selecting ""play all"" on disc 2 side B.",1130889600,39,1375,4.444444444444445
1528072,3,B00005JNHS,"If my review were based solely on the merits of ""McMillian & Wife"", it would easily score five stars.  This modern interpretation of Dashelle Hammett's Nick and Nora Charles from ""The Thin Man"" is, to its fans, almost flawless television.  It was my favorite of the NBC Mystery Movie entries, and today I enjoy it even more than I did then.  How delightful to slip back into the more innocent, gaudy, fun times of the 1970's with Mac and Sally.

However, one must beware of DVD compilations released by Universal Studios.  Like all of my other Universal sets, skips and sticks beset this one.  Two of the eight episodes are ruined, one has a gap of about 90 seconds that is lost to a sticking problem, and another loses almost ten minutes in this same fashion.  There are similar comments all over Amazon reviews by others who have had these same problems with Universal sets.  We also own the Dragnet set, which skips, sticks, and has a totally jacked menu.  We recently purchased the Adam-12 set, and it not only skips and sticks, it appears to have actually damaged our DVD player.  Now the machine makes a loud whirring sound, and has begun to skip and stick on ALL DVD's.

I can't imagine what is wrong with those people at Universal, but they are putting out some seriously botched product.  Buy any set from them with caution.",1130371200,58,1333,4.578059071729958
1528073,4,B00005JNHS,"I've been waiting for this to show up on DVD as I remember the first season was the best season for this program. It's been 35 years since it was first shown, and some of Rock Hudson's suits will give the age of this show away. It's still as funny and clever as I had remembered it, and the video and sound are fine. Everyone in the show seems to be having a fun time, and Susan Saint James is a real standout. I say- ""try this DVD, you will like it""!",1130025600,3,451,3.9130434782608696
1528074,5,B00005JNHS,"The plots weren't always the most intricate.

The production value of sets was minimal.

But, my oh my did Rock and Susan have the chemistry.

I loved them together. However the plot may drag in spots, when

those two were on screen together, it was magic.

And John Schuck was simply superb as Enright.

And then there was Mildred. I smile just thinking of Nancy's

inspired performance.

Watch out for Sally and Mildred plotting together. Chaos will ensue<G>

You gotta love Mac's hideously dated wardrobe. What a wonderful hoot. I had forgotten.

Great guest stars often propelled the plots above the ordinary.

But, it was all about Rock and Susan.

And it worked fabulously. And thanks to the advent of DVD, it still does.

One technical note about the cds. I detest these double sided

discs! What a hassle.",1129939200,6,813,4.755395683453237
1528075,5,B00005JNHS,"I watched McMillan & Wife when I was a kid in the early seventies. I remember looking forward each time to a new episode airing. I also remember being specifically enamored with the beautiful San Franciso city with its very steep streets and it always seemed like the golden sun was shining and then melting into a sunset that you can only find in San Franciso.

I love Nancy Walker as Mildred the ascerbic-tongued housekeeper; the playful verbal gouging between her and the police commissioner (and Sally too) is always charming; I think a lot of people love that particular dynamic.

I like John Schuck's character Seargent Enright; he is very likeable and seems ""totally"" dedicated to his job. I think it is hilarious how most times when he is about to sit down to eat a dinner he has fixed for himself or is in bed about to drift off to sleep, the commissioner calls him on the phone and asks if he is busy doing anything and Enright always indicates that he isn't doing anything of importance (just starving to death or going without sleep mind you); the commissioner then tells him to get over to so and so a place and Enright ruefully looks at the sandwich he has just made and was about to eat and puts it away in the refrigerator and off he goes once again, belly empty.

I love the playful and very loving relationship demonstrated between Mac and Sally. Have you noticed how gentle they are to each other? I wish more couples had that kind of respect for one another.

And, oh baby, what a crush I developed (and still have) on Susan Saint James! Beautiful woman!

When I bought this collection I wanted to savor each episode, especially in that there are so few episodes in this collection as compared to other television series.

Oh, and before I forget, the very last episode in 'my' McMillan 2 DVD set has a bug or error in it that will not allow me to watch the last episode. The beginning of ""An Elementary Case of Murder"" begins to play normally, then, the disk ""freezes up"" and I cannot fast-forward it or reverse it or anything. It seems to occur in the same exact spot in the episode. The image on the screen is dreadfully jumbled-looking at that moment. Can anyone else verify having the same bug?

To finish up:
I love this collection so very much and am champing at the bit waiting for the release of Season 2. I recommend this collection, even 'with' the ""bug"" in the last episode.",1128902400,6,2406,4.466970387243736

The cast was great, and Rock Hudson and Susan Saint James, as Stuart and Sally McMillan had great chemistry together.  I would check the TV guide every week and always make sure I was home to watch McMillan and Wife on the Sunday Night Mystery Movie series.  I am so pleased Season 1 is out on DVD and look forward to the following seasons to be released soon.  I would enjoy some behind the scenes footage, as well.",1128211200,6,501,4.354838709677419

I really looked forward to the release of McMillan and Wife and McCloud, especially since I hadn't seen many episodes since my childhood.

The script-writing is awful. The plots are lousy. Susan St. James is VERY cute. John Schuck is funny enough. But everyone else is boring. In one episode, Rock Hudson's fake punch is SO FAKE, it was laughable. I didn't buy the set to laugh AT the show! Oh, well...

I am desperately waiting for December 6th and the release of season one of The Rockford Files. I've seen that show often through the years and it combined great acting, writing, and story-telling.

1528162,4,B00005JNHS,"One of the rotating NBC Mystery Movie series in the 1970s, McMILLAN AND WIFE remains my personal favorite.  Unlike COLUMBO, we do not see a killer commit a crime in scene one that Columbo has to solve; instead, we have a suspenseful whodunit.  Also unlike COLUMBO, we do not have an intoxicatingly romantic leading lady in Susan Saint James.

An almost perfect blending of mystery, romance, and comedy, McMILLAN AND WIFE stars an excellent Rock Hudson as San Francisco Police Commissioner Stewart McMillan and Susan Saint James as his friendly, romantic, intelligent crime-solving wife Sally.  They live on Russian Hill--you can still visit that cul-de-sac one block away from the crooked part of Lombard Street.  The series is at its best when clearly in scenic San Francisco and not on the Universal back lot.  That's one area where COLUMBO wins--it already takes place in Los Angeles.

MAC AND WIFE has some good writers, including story editor Steven Bochco (who later created HILL ST. BLUES), Oliver Hailey (who once was kind enough to answer a fan letter on studio stationery), and series creator Leonard B. Stern.  Directors included Robert Michael Lewis.  The memorable theme music is by Jerry Fielding, and the beautiful painting backdrop credits are (I think) by Wayne Fitzgerald.

The plots are solid, intelligent, and engrossing--an autographed football has clues to a football player murder; a man and a valuable dog are both kidnapped--and the wife only wants the dog back!; Mac is a pink bunny rabbit and Sally is a slinky black cat at a homicidal costume party; Mac and Sally are trapped inside their insecticide-filled apartment on her birthday--I love Saint James' gorgeous orange dress in this truly chilling episode; and Barbara McNair plays a singer accused of murder, and only Mac (who used to date her) believes she is innocent.  This last is one of the season one bests and has a twist climax plus a haunting ending.  (But where is the McMillan baby in Fall 1972 if Sally is pregnant in this episode from March 1972?  I believe Susan was really pregnant.)  The boxed set includes the two hour pilot and seven 90 minute episodes that were run one a month during Fall 1971 and Spring 1972.  Having them uncut and non-commercial is something out of a dream.

Most of all here, we have the incandescent Susan Saint James.  When MAC AND WIFE was repeated on CBS late at night in the 1980's, I would watch until 2 a.m. on work nights and wrote fan letter after fan letter to Susan.  I sent her Christmas and birthday cards.  Every single one of them came back to me as undeliverable, so I finally gave up in frustration.  All I wanted to say was that, with her huggably romantic beauty and superb sense of comic timing, the incomparable Ms. Saint James was the reason I watched her series until the wee hours on work nights and why I still love it on DVD.  I still have a powerful crush on Sally McMillan--Susan Saint James makes her pretty and friendly and immortal.  Now she may be watching the DVD set with her grown-up kids.  And hopefully reading this.

McMILLAN AND WIFE is a superb mystery-comedy-romance series that is worth owning.  Only one complaint:  where are the original NBC MYSTERY MOVIE credits with the whistling man and his flashlight out in the desert?  Henry Mancini gets music credit at the end of every episode for music that is not on DVD! Otherwise, MAC AND WIFE is unbeatable entertainment, and I look forward to the other seasons of both it and COLUMBO on DVD in the near future--maybe with some bonus material, the original Mystery Movie openings, and less cost-cutting production, like the infamous dual layer.",1126396800,5,3657,4.800319488817891
