6264150,5,B00II6C66E,"The following contains spoilers that may be found to tarnish the experience of someone wishing to watch Shiki for the first time. The section that readers who have not watched or are watching the anime should avoid will be bolded. Readers discretion is advised.

Its a pain in the butt to find a good horror anime. And by horror, I don't mean just classic horror species, such as vampires, because that would imply that Rosario Vampire is horror. And while it is scary for completely different reasons having to do with how crappy it is, Shiki is the complete opposite. While it isn't scary in the nightmarish sense it is scary in the psychological sense. While some scenes can be eerie, what youll find is scary is the way the vampiric creatures called shiki are personified as actual people with real emotions, some of whom don't want to kill and are only doing it to survive. Thus, the humans are killing the vampires to survive and the vampires are killing the humans to survive so isn't logical that humans shouldnt be quite so mad and intolerant toward them when they are acting as humans do? This and many other questions of value make Shiki into more than some average vampire story. Because I don't believe the series is about vampires against humans. I believe that this is a series that is humans against humans.

Shikis story starts surprisingly simply. An old European style mansion is built in the middle of nowhere. Of course, a castle of its like is quite uncommon in Japan and gets quite a few odd glances from the local townspeople. Few of them even know who live in it. Then, suddenly, people start to die. The blame is placed on an epidemic that is sweeping through, but Dr. Ozaki, owner of the local clinic, finds himself wondering if that is really the cause. At the same time, a teenage boy named Natsuno Yuuki finds himself being confronted by the recently deceased Megumi, a girl who was infatuated with him. And concurrent to that the junior monk at the village temple, Seishin Muroi is getting visits at night from the strange little girl who lives at the castle, a girl who has read his books and is a big fan. But she has a disease that prevents her from going out during the day.

 The story is slow but not in a particularly bad way. There are so many deaths and we see pretty much every one. At the same time though, the characters have internal conflicts they are resolving as well as conflicts amongst themselves. We are constantly introduced to more and more people, each of which adds a bit more to the story. Because while they may not accomplish anything and may die, they do show essentially the chronicles of what took place in this tiny village.

The problem some may find with the story is quite simply how generic it really is. Old castle, vampires, small town. The only difference is, were seeing this classic European tale in the Japanese countryside. Does that make it any different from any other vampire stories youve seen before? It really does. It embraces the rural Japanese culture as well as makes the characters from those tales much more modern. Dr. Ozaki is a chain smoking bad***. Seishin is akin to the catholic priest of the small European town. Of course, theres that one villager who catches onto things, Yuuki.

This is not to say that the story is without its faults. If you are a vampire moving into a rural Japanese village, would you build a castle or just a normal home? The castle drew unwanted attention, just as it should. And when you don't come out during the day and play it off as being because of some sort of disease, youd think someone would wonder even more. Small villages are suspicious of new people who don't introduce themselves, and this idea is in the anime but I spent half the anime feeling like the village was defending the creepy people in the castle.

Major Spoilers Here:

Other tiny problems I had was Sunako Kirishikis backstory not being totally explained. It was kind of half explained and you are made to imply why she is in Japan with the other Kirishikis. One werewolf dies of being shot but Tatsumi Kirishiki is shot to hell and still manages to run around and have a hand to hand fight. And that brings up another point. Are werewolves the name given to vampires more powerful than Shiki or are they actual werewolves? Im assuming they arent, but why would you name a vampire a werewolf? Thats  confusing.

The anime wraps up nicely and the last six episodes are classic horror conventions that remain effective, especially because of the feelings you have toward the vampires. Its not a giant ending that is awe-inspiring, but it isn't too subtle. It just ends things perfectly.

The animation is not good for 2010. Characters look old-fashioned in a way. They look like they belong in an anime from eight or nine years ago. The motion is somewhat jerky and its just all very bare bones. The environments look good though, I cant say the village is in any way badly animated. Later on, toward the end, blood is getting all over the characters and it looks really bad. Its like a red film was put over their faces and clothes.

The one really good thing about the animation is the facial melting is lovely, if thats even possible. And the use of red circles in the dark as the vampires eyes at the beginning of the series is eerily effective. Later on, its not used at all because we don't need that to tell us the vampires are coming, we know. The anime doesnt treat us like idiots.

And then theres the hair. Whoever animated this anime had to have been fired from Square Enix because of how ridiculous the hair was in Final Fantasy X. The hair is almost unbearably stupid. Ozaki and Seishin have decent hair, but then Ozakis wife and mother are shown andGod almighty I think the most annoying hair was found on Tatsumi who, I guess, has taken a flat top and cut it up so he appears to have ears. How can you even take a guy with hair like that seriously? And on top of that is the way these people dress. Some of the clothing choices are ridiculous. Tatsumis jumpsuits are weird, Natsunos eventual pink shoes and leggings with a pair of shorts over them and a hobo coat is awful. Megumi and Sunako are the only two of the females who dress in a conventional and/or cute manner. Of course there are minor characters who dress fine, but some of the main characters are having fashion problems

And that brings up a good point. You can usually tell a character is important because their hair is ridiculous and they wear idiotic clothing. This is not always true, but there are many characters who prove this.

The sound is actually quite good. The two opening themes are good, with the first being excellent. The endings are good as well. But the music really shines during the show. Dramatic moments are tinged with eerie music and even normal moments have good music. There were no particularly annoying voice actors.

Characters range from awesome to annoying. The three main characters, Ozaki, Seishin, and Natsuno are all good, Ozaki more so than the other two. Ozaki is a character that starts as important for a completely different reason than how he ends up being important. Hes pretty much a bad***. Seishin is kind of a wuss, but at the same time I did like him and found his actions to be honorable. Natsuno is kind of an dirtbag. While Megumi was annoying, I did like her and found that Natsuno treated her like total garbage. He was just an all-around dirtbag at the start of the series, though grows a little more likeable toward the end.

As far as the vampires go, none of them really stuck out besides Sunako. Her parents weren't all that exciting. She seemed to be the emotional focal point of the series, and you do feel bad for her. At the same time, I was kind of emotionally invested in Megumi for some reason. Maybe it was her screw everyone attitude. I don't know why I liked her. But the last episode hurt me quite a bit concerning her. More so than anyone else. Talk about brutal

Another character I may as well mention is Masao Murasaka. This guy was the only character I totally hated. Every time he appeared on my screen I wanted to reach through and strangle him. He was so annoying and the ending doesnt show him getting whats coming to him, which annoyed me. I saw Megumi get it, but not this piece of garbage..

Shiki has a large cast of eclectic characters, a good story, an interesting point of view, and is an all-around fun ride. Its animation is pretty bad, but that doesnt detract from it much. If you can look past the fact the characters look ridiculous and the designs are idiotic, youll find something very fun. Its slow paced, but it keeps your interest by jumping around and inserting key moments at just the right times. Its eerie, its character driven, and its effective. And it ends. Which is something absolutely lovely because rarely do I find myself watching an anime with a satisfying conclusion (at least lately) and this one wraps up with only a few holes, but not enough to totally detract from the experience.

Fans of horror will enjoy this series and be able to make parallels between this and other works such as Mary Shellys Frankenstein. If you're not a fan of horror, this may have some things you are looking for though. Its not scary;  its an effective story about the persecution of a people who are not unlike us.",1401580800,,9383,4.536960378474276
6264151,5,B00II6C66E,"About a month or so ago, I came across a list online of recommended animes for a more serious or mature taste. At the top of this list was a title, ""Shiki."" There was no description, no summary, no information whatsoever about what the show was about or why it was worth seeing. All it said was, watch. I find it to be most fun when I start a book or movie as blind as I can so as to make everything a surprise. Naturally, I figured it was an opportune chance to start a new show. Lately, I've grown tired of the homogenization of American TV and cinema and have found quality in the manga and anime mediums with titles like ""Attack on Titan"", ""Cowboy Bebop"", and ""Uzumaki"" to name a few. However, among these titles, as incredible and emotionally compelling as they are, none possess the sheer brilliance and horrid beauty of Shiki. It tells the story of a village located in the mountains of Japan. The villagers, all knowing each other, are neighborly and sweet if not a bit eccentric. Their lives are ones of simplicity and peace. But as August begins, death after mysterious death befalls the village. But this strange epidemic has an ulterior cause...

To remain succinct and clear, Shiki was a show unlike any other I had seen before. Yes, it starred characters who possessed the typical anime design with their thin physiques and colored and strangely styled hair; something I usually tend to avoid with a few exceptions. However, this quality proves to only benefit what makes Shiki so great. The juxtaposition between its sweet natured characters and its nihilistically horrid atmosphere creates a heartbreaking story that will never leave your memory, like an undying fairy tale engrained from childhood. This is completed with an individually unique ensemble of characters, hauntingly sweet music, and a motif of tragedy. I recommend both the Japanese and more so the English dub for they are equally talented.

To end my story, I shall leave you with this: horror comes in many forms and facets. It can be found in the dark and in the light. In our enemies, in our friends. It permeates our fears and our nightmares. It induces our worries of being forgotten, abandoned. To die alone. To lose innocence. What is Shiki? A child's music box endlessly resonating within a village mortuary; warding away and calling forth to those who listen. Shiki... is what it truly means to be forsaken",1399593600,38,2398,4.73444976076555
6264152,4,B00II6C66E,i love this anime so much it's one of my favorites but this is only subbed which makes me so upset if this was dubbed it would be an automatic buy for me,1397260800,2,153,3.6666666666666665
6264153,5,B00II6C66E,"Sotobamura is a small, secluded village where the old customs, such as the burial of the dead, are still practiced. Life in Sotobamura is calm and boring. When three old people die in the outskirts of the village, it is marked down as old age or heatstroke. But when a healthy teenage girl expires, it starts to look like the deaths might be connected. The local doctor, Toshio Ozaki, starts to see a pattern--light anemia followed by sudden and inexplicable death-- and suspects an epidemic. But what sort of disease causes its victims to quit their jobs before dying? And what about those families that disappear in the middle of the night in moving vans?

I've always been partial towards the idea of vampires in stories, but I rarely like the sort of stories that have vampires in them (a contradiction, I know). But Shiki manages to create a excellent atmosphere of creepiness and uncertainty. The story moves on at a rather languid pace, but it is never boring. Shiki has the sort of feeling of a horror movie, but it isn't scary. The vampires are rather pretty, but very creepy.
The story follows a range of characters and not all of them survive, which makes it even more interesting. Shiki is more a story about a village, rather than a character. Not that the characters are unimportant or boring. Most of them are quite likable, which makes their situation a little sad.

I really enjoyed Shiki. But I don't think it is a show for everyone. It's biggest appeal is the atmosphere, and if you don't get drawn into it, then there isn't much left for you. When giving this series a try, you should watch at least 3-4 episodes before passing judgment. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!

I've been putting off buying Shiki since it was released because I really wanted the complete series in one set (its a space thing). But now the only full set to be released is a SAVE edition? I am now considering buying the two separate parts. The SAVE editions are great for series you want cheap, but for a series you really like, it is probably worth it to shell out the extra cash for a nicer set.

PS Shiki is based on a book by Fuyumi Ono, who also wrote the source material for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-Hunt/dp/B003SPDSAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost Hunt</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Twelve-Kingdoms/dp/B0021BSOHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Twelve Kingdoms</a>&nbsp;anime. They are very different from Shiki, but both are good so you should go check them out :)

UPDATE: I just got my Shiki set today and I must say I am very pleased. It looks like they just took the original two sets and slapped a S.A.V.E label on it. It comes in a sturdy cardboard box with two Blu-ray/DVD sets.

UPDATE 6/8/14: I am now confused. I pre-ordered my set directly from Funimation and received it some weeks ago. Today I received another set. The first set was as described in the first update. The second is a single double width blu ray case with all of the DVDs and the standard green S.A.V.E spine. It is a decent set, but not as nice as the first one. The one pictured on Amazon looks like the first set, but I've had problems with Amazon showing the wrong picture for S.A.V.E editions before. So in the end I can't tell what the actual S.A.V.E edition is like. Be aware there might be two types.",1397001600,34,3421,4.8493150684931505

I am sure the product will be good as a whole, however I am not sure about the ADR part .

But for this title itself , I won't be buying this. Why? Because when  I was watching  the japanese release ,I was getting depressed by the minute .

6264155,2,B00II6C66E,"I was very excited to watch this show. Reading a short summary of the plot sounded like it was right up my alley...sadly that was until i began watching it.
The story premise i enjoyed,along with many of the characters,but i feel like so many scenes are redundant in this show. I get deja vu constantly because so many scenes are so very similar to one another.
I just feel as though this show was padded out in an uninteresting way.
So many times it seems the characters take to long to make any big story changing decision. They seem to wait until things spiral well beyond their control before taking some action.
In short so many characters just seem naive and oblivious to their surroundings.
Now i do understand that the show was trying to be a little bit different and it does succeed in that regard. But overall my brother and i found ourselves dozing off by episode 10 as the show just drags along far to slowly.",1516492800,2,921,4.423529411764706

When I saw that it went on sale I was so excited! Then I realized that the case had many issues. It could of been due to the uncarefull packaging that was just a piece of card board wrapped around it and two other anime that I bought. There was no padding in it at all and it felt like they could have been sliding around inside. After looking it over, excitedly, I realized that the case wouldn't close all the way because the bottom clip is broken off. There's some sort of distortion of the plastic sheet on the back, the top is cracking down the folding point, and one of the disc clips that keep the discs in place has a piece broken off. I'm utterly disappointed because I was going to start collecting anime and I can't replace the case because of it's ability to hold so many discs.

I was only able to watch half of this anime before giving up on it, every episode seemed repetitive. This anime is about vampires so i couldn't help but be reminded of the twilight movies. Sad to say, as terrible as the twilight movies may be, the twiligh movies are FAR more entertaining than Shiki. Dont get me wrong, this anime is watchable, i have seen way worse animes before, but in my opinion, this anime is for little kids. Not scary, there is no gore or any real violence, no foul language, no nudity, the plot and charcters are awful, no real drama either. Your better off skiping this one.

6264174,5,B00II6C66E,"Shiki tells a fascinating story- it's one of the anime I've enjoyed most.  It's important to understand what it is and is not, though.  It is a compelling tale, which feels more tragic than horrific, with a grounded and realistic style (no magic and very downplayed supernatural elements).  Episodes reveals pieces of a single story with absolutely no ""filler"" episodes or wasted time.  This is a thought provoking, serious, and emotional story that includes some moments of action and horror - this is NOT Hellsing or Trinity Blood.

Reasons to watch:
Strong, interesting characters
Setting that feels real
Emotions and ideas are complex and engaging, but the story itself is straightforward
Slice of life/documentary style told from the perspective of numerous diverse characters
Original take on horror genre: violence is shown as unfortunate and there aren't heroes/villains per se

The village doctor Toshio Okazi tries to find the cause of these deaths and put an end to them even if he has to do some shady things in the process. Shiki is a slow show. Like really, really slow. I almost dropped the show multiple times but I convinced myself it would get better.

It does get better in the second half as the story kicks in and the slow build pays off. The towns people start to fight back against the Shiki, vampire like creatures that were the cause of the random deaths. The show tries, however, to make the viewer sympathetic towards the Shiki by going over their own inner monologs and povs. It is hard to feel sympathy for them when they were the ones who attacked first.

The show tries to make the viewers question the morality of both sides, human and Shiki. I don't think it works if you paint one side as villainous and evil only to then flip flop and say otherwise. The show's pace is slow and may be a turn off for some viewers and I completely understand. I would say watch a few episodes before you judge but you'd have to watch a lot to do so. I hesitantly recommend Shiki, but maybe read the summaries of the first few episodes as the show takes a while to get going.

6264187,2,B00II6C66E,"This is a review of the overall product, not just the content of the anime, which I haven't watched to completion. What I've seen I've enjoyed and I suspect it's a fine show.

The product, however, is a different story. This will not apply to most people, but only people either fluent in Japanese or attempting to immerse in native material without the aid of English.

The Blu-ray version of this show forces English subtitles when the Japanese audio track is turned on. This is a worrisome trend I have seen in other products, especially since it is never disclosed on Amazon. The only reason this package doesn't get zero stars is because the DVD version DOES allow independent audio track and subtitle selection, and because the product was otherwise satisfactory. But as it stands, the Blu-ray version is useless to me.

FUNIMATION: There is LITERALLY NO LEGITIMATE REASON to lock subtitles on. They are distracting and frustrating for someone who doesn't want them, and you absolutely should not assume that just because someone lives in North America that they want English subtitles on a video production. I am a typical white, native-born American, and if I don't want them, clearly there are many others who would be even less likely to. Obviously the product should have subtitles, but they should be optional, and forcing them makes absolutely no sense. This is not the era of VHS tapes where we should have to choose between a subbed version, a dubbed version, or a native version. Region restrictions are stupid enough to begin with (from a consumer standpoint), and now we need to extend it to forcing language on people? I also bought the Berserk Golden Age movie collection on Blu-ray, and will be returning it, as it does the same thing. This means I have 0 options for an acceptable domestic release of those films, so unless I decide to resort to piracy or buy a Japanese Blu-ray player and import the movies (which I cannot afford to do), I will never get to watch them. Keeping up practices like this is only going to lead to people like me buying fewer of your products, whatever alternative paths we choose to take. As it stands, I now can't trust your label, and will have to rely on other people to tell me whether or not subtitles in your products are forced. I will probably never look at a Funimation release again unless I can get this confirmation from someone, which is unlikely.

I hope you will take note and rectify these problems in the future.",1477612800,,2481,4.696551724137931

6264191,4,B00II6C66E,"Conceptually, this series reminded me of Stephen King's ""Salem's Lot""--the only vampire story
that ever gave me nightmares. I have yet to find out if ""Shiki"" will, as I haven't slept since, lol.
Seriously, this is one of the most disturbing, and gory, animes I've ever seen...but that doesn't
make it bad. Just be warned, this show is not for children, or the squeamish.
The biggest problem I had with it is that there are no characters I could identify with, and only
a few even to root for. When the villagers finally awaken (no pun intended) to what's going on,
their methods of fighting back quickly blur the line between human and monster.
There were also some continuity breaks which helped keep this show from a five-star rating. An
episode might end with a cliff-hanger, only to have the character involved disappear for several
episodes, then reappear perfectly okay.
With all this negativity out of the way, I'll say that the show is well worth your time, once the above
caveats are considered. It has a style to it, and the overall story is very quickly paced. I'm no binge-
watcher, but I went through the 24 episodes in two days, so anxious was I to see what happens next.
One thing I particularly liked was that victims who rose as vampires retained their personalities. Some
were gleeful at the thought of killing without remorse, while others were horrified at what they'd become,
even refusing to feed on their fellow townspeople.",1472256000,4,1447,4.746031746031746

I was drawn to this show by a video on youtube that showed one part of brutality this show has. I was curious about it so i looked up the show. The first theme song is absolutely amazing. Kuchizuke
The show starts off slow(not saying its a bad thing, gave me a feel of the town.) if felt like a mystery mixed with the undead. soon it begins to be a race to stop the people of the town from dying or there will be no one left. This is different from a lot of other shows i have watched. In Shiki, It goes great lengths to show how the living go through life and the undead as well. It isn't just one sided where you hope the 'good guys' win. I finished the show with mixed emotions, it definitely isn't for everyone, it almost wasn't meant for me, but even how dark it gets, i still enjoyed Shiki.",1469145600,,984,4.0

6264227,3,B00II6C66E,"First of all the price for the DVD Blu ray combo pack was very reasonable.  The art style is interesting featuring some very wild hair, sharp angles, and interesting colors as well as particularly large eyes and though it is not very realistic it's not totally jarring either.  The character designs are quite distinct and each person is easy to tell apart from the next due to its unique style, however I did notice the animation start to get a bit choppy here and there, though the movement was not terribly fluid to begin with.  The voice acting being a funimation production was above average though there were a couple of stinkers.  Most of the teenage characters are voiced quite well, (with the exception of the little spoilt overly dramatic brat that looks like an anemic Marilyn Manson who is obviously meant for comic relief).  Many of the adults however sound very nonchalant making some of the visually and plot-heavy tense moments anticlimactic. The anime itself, being a psychological thriller, involves a lot of thinking and problem solving as well as a lot of medical hoo-ha and humanitarian, social-ethical dilemmas. For those of you who enjoy mysteries and the more scholarly types of material this is going to be fairly engaging.  If you are the kind of person who prefers the random ZOMG! goofy stuff that you have to turn your brain off to really enjoy, this might be kind of talk heavy and plot driven for you.  This also isn't for the faint of heart or squeamish as some moments get fairly disturbing and bloody, including a total societal breakdown, a village slaughter, and a teenage vampire diva who gets her head crushed, Gallagher style by a tractor tire....unless you like this sort of thing.  On the downside there are many moments which are horribly cliche and over the top, but all in all this breed of vampire is a refreshing break from the current romantic, sparkling-in-the-sunlight vampire craze.",1434067200,,1932,4.833333333333333

6264231,5,B00II6C66E,"I purchased this series, on a whim, and have been very satisfied with it. One thing to be aware of is how the discs are laid out. The Blu-Ray/DVDs are not in chronological order according to their format. By the time I realized this, I was nearing the middle of the series. I advise you to reorder the DVDs, according to the format you prefer and then you'll enjoy them more.

This series is far different than I imagined. By saying that, I mean that it contains realistic human behaviours and there is no great hero who rises up to quell the evil but, instead, a determined man pushed to the brink who rallies an entire town to reclaim the fate of their own humanity from the intentions of the Shiki (Vampires). No matter who you may think will step up, you're better off waiting to see, as you'll be shocked when the twist happens.

This is definitely a Mature Audience anime. I cannot imagine showing it to a younger audience, despite it being animated, as they will be unable to grasp what they are seeing and the nuances will either fly over their heads or set them upon a path as dark as this series (presumably with you in the house with them). This is, yet another, series that would be ruined by live action. I have long held the theory that anime was what live cinema wished it could be and there are things that can be animated but could never be shown with real actors without receiving a rating that would bar all but true adults from watching it. If you are looking for a deep but heavy subject, this is the one you shouldn't pass up.",1431648000,,1548,4.334482758620689

6264239,5,B00II6C66E,"There aren't many ""good"" horror anime out there because drawings of terrible things happening always sort of seem to be more distant and less scary or creepy than stuff like Nightmare on Elm Street or Psycho. Horror anime have to make it up in different ways that skew to the more psychological aspects of the genre by exploring insane characters or just the depravity of humanity when at death's door. This show in all of it's death and destruction asks primarily why humanity is so great when characters on both sides of the Shiki/human conflict turn into monsters that justify killing as a means to survive.
  Shiki consists of two parts essentially, the buildup, and the payoff. The buildup starts slow but then picks up after it sets up an eerie ignorance to what is really going on in the town in the first few episodes, it's there to show inklings of what's to come. The payoff is what made this show for me just for the sheer amount of bloodshed and self-righteous justice being served to those who ""deserve"" it.
  This show is a great example of what horror in anime should strive for, a creepy and ominous atmosphere, instead of the Saw inspired gore fest shows like Corpse Party. Another show that has the same feel that Shiki possesses is Higurashi.",1426809600,,1261,4.641255605381166

Set in a small rural Japanese village in the middle of no where. As a new family moves into the village a mysterious illness starts to spread like an epidemic. As the villagers try to uncover the origin of the illness they uncover something... Something supernatural.

The end.

I'm joking!

The series is a true plot driven show. It can take its time to build up but its very suspenceful once it does! It will leave you on the edge of your set yet can scare you to your core. Overall great character development for the most part. They try to put a name and story to everyone. A very unique anime that is not often seen. I really enjoyed it and consider it great.

6264254,5,B00II6C66E,"For those that are fans of the horror and vampire genres (and even those that are not), this is one series not to be missed. Far too many movies and series choose the method of depicting the dark and fearsome world of vampires with a tremendous amount of blood and gore, looking to tap into pure shock factor alone. Far too often the psychological elements of fear toward the supernatural is passed over. For Shiki, this is not the case. Shiki is a well written, truly fear inspiring horror series that avoids most of the shock value and instead utilizes tension and scene build-up to keep the viewer not only on the edge of their seat each and every episode, but also plants in their minds the bone chilling, nearly paralyzing type of fear one might expect to experience if you actually encountered a real vampire. Solid script writing, characters and mood setting music as well as visuals place this series toward the top in quality compared to all other entries in this genre, and makes a more than respectable showing for itself in the overall anime world.",1421712000,,1060,4.6436170212765955

6264263,5,B00II6C66E,"I've seen a lot of anime ranging from comedy to drama, although very few actually tug at my emotional core. Shiki is one of them. I kept passing up this recommendation from Amazon for a long time until one day, I just decided to give it a shot. I was not disappointed.

The show is genuinely creepy from the bloody visuals to the soundtrack, which adds to the already messed up plot. People are dying rapidly in a small village and the people begin to think it's an epidemic and honestly, the series doesn't really pick up until about episode 7 and after that, the ball gets to rolling and doesn't stop. And fair warning, these are the kind of vampires from the original Vampire myth with the exception of a few ""Daylighters"", (my own term for Vamps that can walk in the sun although there's a term the anime uses but I don't know how to spell it and I'd rather not butcher it.)

One of the things I value most about this anime is that it felt like a live-action U.S. television show. The many different characters, fashion, (the Vampires in particular have an amazing, distinct sense of style), and multi-character developments add to my opinion as well as the layout of the story.

The show is rated TV-MA for good reason considering the amount of bloody violence and religious imagery, (which actually ties in quite cleverly instead of coming off as pretentious or corny.)

I feel like this anime would be a great addition to the Toonami lineup since I find Shiki to be as good as, (if not better than), Attack on Titan but alas, my opinion isn't always with the popular so I just going to hope you give it a shot like I did.",1417737600,3,1628,4.416666666666667
6264264,5,B00II6C66E,"Shiki is not for the faint hearted. The setting an isolated Japanese village where a new European style castle has been built. The residents of this new castle move in during the night, are elusive at best  and with their arrival comes the disappearance of local teenager Megumi who is alter found dead. And so the Sobota village summer epidemic begins.

Shiki is a classic vampire story with a Japanese twist. The village begins experiencing a lot of residents dying which leads authorities to believe the village is suffering some sort of epidemic. As the tale unravels some begin to believe that indeed vampires are behind the killings. The story focuses on many characters, some in more depth than others as we follow who lives, who dies. The anime is not afraid to go very dark as the imagery is gruesome at times and characters treat each other terribly. The series get particularly bloody and gruesome towards the series ending.

My only minor complaint about this anime is the somewhat jarring character designs. There are three styles of characters - the super cute round eyed characters, the more realistic styled characters, and the psychotic looking wide eyed characters with a single dot for a iris/pupil. It was strange at first but after awhile I adjusted.

This a great horror anime and one that does satisfy.",1417392000,3,1325,4.875555555555556
6264265,4,B00II6C66E,"Spoiler alert!

I was hoping that this anime would not be about vampires, because there are way too many vampire anime out there. However, even though I was a little disappointed in the subject matter, I still found Shiki worth watching.

The village of Sotoba has been experiencing high fatality rates, and Dr. Ozaki can't figure out why so many unrelated people have been dying of what seems to be anemia. After a few episodes, though, he starts to believe that there may be undead and/or vampires at work, and he's right.

The story also concerns Seishin Muroi, a Buddhist monk, who is also a novelist and the doctor's best friend. He meets the little girl Sunoko, who is mysterious but not frightening...at first. She and her supposed family have moved into the mansion on Kanemasa, and the villagers are suspicious of them, but no-one connects them with the deaths that have been occurring, for a long time. Muroi struggles with accepting that there are vampires around, and even when he is convinced of that, he has a hard time accepting that staking the vampires is OK, because, he says, they are living beings, and killing the living is wrong. He and Ozaki get into fights about this, and finally he steps away from his friend and goes to Kanemasa, it's not really clear why, but he ends up allowing the vampires to feed on him.

The other important characters are Kaori and her younger brother Akira, and their friend Natsuno. Natsuno watched his best friend, Toru, die from the strange illness, and soon becomes convinced that there are indeed vampires at Kanemasa. He, along with Kaori and Akira, vows to stop the vampires, but when Toru rises again and comes for Natsuno, Natsuno doesn't put up a fight. He dies several episodes before the end, but that isn't the last of him!

After killing Chimizu, one of the vampires, in full view of the villagers, Dr. Ozaki finally gets people on his side. The last few episodes are dark, with the villagers ruthlessly hunting down the vampires and the vampires ruthlessly hunting down villagers. Sunoko is forced to flee, and does so in the company of Muroi. Ozaki and the villagers watch the village burn down, and the doctor wonders if what they have done has actually made a difference...

This anime is creepy, gory, and can be hard to follow. Every character is named in subtitles, and since many of them are only seen in one episode, this can be overwhelming as you try to pick out who is who. There are also a couple of side stories which concern only one or two characters, and I wonder if there was really any point to adding this kind of filler. In addition, some characters are introduced and then dropped (like the priestess). The anime also ends with several key questions unanswered: who did Kaori meet in the hallway? How did Akira escape? what happened to Mr. Kirishiki? Where did Megumi get all of those Goth outfits?

The art and character design are different from other anime I've watched. The style is unusual, and I have to admit that I wasn't sure I wanted to continue watching the series because of that. Once I accepted that, however, I found that it didn't affect the plot, so I let it go. On the other hand, some of the style helps make Shiki spooky. One of the characters' entrances was so creepy that I couldn't get it out of my head.

If you like vampire stories, or general creepiness, it is hard to go wrong with Shiki.",1417392000,3,3403,4.603960396039604

6264270,5,B00II6C66E,"I have been waiting over a year for funimation to put part 1 & 2 together and when i first heard they were slapping this onto the s.a.v.e line i was kinda disappointed.  Usually in the past they would have a complete series (usually in a thinpack) with a big distracting, sometimes distasteful s.a.v.e logo on the front cover art.

It is NOT the case here!

When i received my copy it was packaged in a chip board box usually used for limited editions. While housing 2 blu ray cases with box art on each with the dvd/blurays. The box did say s.a.v.e on it, but only unintrusively on the back of the box.

If you were on the fence of getting this anime GET IT. You are getting a good horror anime packaged as a limited edition release. Well worth the $20",1412640000,,753,4.244755244755245
6264271,5,B00II6C66E,"This set is fantastic as is, but you should know a couple things about the S.A.V.E. edition before you buy it.

First off, you're getting a GREAT bargain. With this release you're getting all 24 episodes (22 original, and 2 extra episodes that were added later, numbers 20.5 and 21.5) on Blu Ray AND DVD. The show looks pristine on Blu Ray, my only problem with it so far is that the menu sounds are terrible; way too loud and just plain obnoxious. The DVDs look fine, but I've only watched one episode on them, so if there's an issue, I don't know about it. The English dub is well made and all of the voices are great, with the exception of one character (you'll instantly know which one when he shows up), but this was intentional. The series so far (I'm on episode 8) is very interesting. The animation is nice, but not as good as the opening and ending themes (main issue: long hair on female characters doesn't move. Like, at all. There's no sway, no bounce, no anything. It makes it seem like their hair is plastered onto their head.).

Anyway, what you need to know is what you're getting if you buy this. The pictures in the customer images section shows the earliest release of the S.A.V.E. Edition. The LE version of this show didn't sell well, and there were a lot of leftover chipart boxes and cases, so Funimation slapped a SAVE sticker on the back and sold them that way until they ran out. I knew there were no more left when I bought this, but others may not. What you will get now is an oversized Blu Ray case with all 8 discs inside, attached to plastic pages. There is an ugly SAVE Edition cover art redesign, which thankfully is reversible. The opposite side shows Natsuno (which is fine, but I would have preferred Megumi), but it doesn't say ""Shiki"" on the spine, which sucks. Another nitpick is that every time you open the case, you'll be able to see the ugly green SAVE label. Also, the Blu Ray case is quite flimsy, a part of the inside has already cracked (nothing major, but still a small annoyance) so be careful when handling this.

This is still a great deal, but if you're a huge anime collector, you can still buy a copy of the LE box set, albeit at a much higher price in two seperate parts. If you're like me, this set will do just fine... Except when you can't find it on your shelf. Spine labels are CRUCIAL, Funi, I hope you're taking notes!",1412553600,48,2380,4.3558558558558556

It also gives you two sides of the story through the various charcters. It's gloomy but my main bif with it is the soundtrack repeats a lot when spmething supposedly is bad.

I wouldn't call it a comical anime due to it's horror scenes and music nor would I call it an anime for kids due to it's blood content yet it is still a great anime to watch if you're into horrors and what.

The first 13 episodes established them as villains!!! You can't make them the good guys thats not how it works especially since the towns people lost so much!!

8642190,5,B00II6C66E,"The village of Sotoba was surrounded by death, until death came creeping in the night, claiming its inhabitants, one by one.

Some these villagers don't stay dead. They rise fom their graves, making the local legend of the okaegari (vampire) a reality.

 Shimizu Megumi, a village girl dreaming of the big city is one of the first to fall and rise. Yuuki Natsuno, the boy she desired enough to stalk from beyond the grave finds that neither he nor anyone he loves is safe from Megumis hunger. Ozaki Toshio-sensei, the long suffering village doctor, finds himself dealing with an epidemic he can neither control nor stop, until hes confronted with the source of Sotobas ailment. Aspiring writer and young monk Moroi Seishin, who was already trapped in a life he didn't want, expresses his darkness in his prose, only to meet a fan whose love of his literature may have doomed to the village to suffer the same darkness.

These characters take on a central part in the tragic drama which enfolds Sotoba, giving most of its residents a voice. For the okaegari are not undetected. If theres one thing more terrifying than the creatures creeping out from their graves, its the violence of humanity rising to meet them.

This is not a light hearted show. Nor is it for viewers who require a happy ending. It asks hard moral questions, creeping into ambiguous moral territory. It takes a classical horror story of the undead rising, giving it a new twist and new depth. It tells a dark story, using beautiful animation, haunting music, drawing the viewers into its sinister ambience and the fearful perspective of the characters, growing aware of the monsters creeping up on them. Slowly, our perspective expands to include the monsters as well, leaving us no longer certain whom were rooting for.

This is horror, explored in a rich depth not always given to the genre. Its one of the most well crafted stories Ive ever seen, among the best in horror, if not the best.
