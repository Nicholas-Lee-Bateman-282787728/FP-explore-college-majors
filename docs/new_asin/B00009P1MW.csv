I would not recommend this to anyone, unless you want to buy mine, in which case it's great!",1156896000,21,258,4.7555555555555555
1887626,5,B00009P1MW,"I am a young music teacher and I am always looking for new techniques to teach my students. This DVD is excellent for many reasons. It talks about practice routines, breathing techniques, vocal and more. This book has really helped me understand the body related to singing. It has also helped my students improve their singing. I would commend this DVD to anyone who is interested in working on their vocal techniques. Enjoy! Also check out The Contemporary Singer by Anne Peckham.",1124150400,18,482,4.890243902439025

7992207,4,B00009P1MW,"Nice to watch a live lesson with a student. The lesson doesn't involve too many tips for a beginner so if you want a more technical lesson you may want to get something to complement this DVD.  Having said that, there is def information here that will assist your vocal training.",1398297600,2,279,4.470588235294118
7992208,2,B00009P1MW,"I'm just dissappointed because all it is, is the woman on the cover giving a student a vocal lesson.
I thought that it would be more like a personal voice lesson with organized tips and chapters containing in-depth information about the voice, diaphragm, and so on. I don't know, I just felt like I was sitting in on someone's vocal lesson for an hour..",1367971200,3,353,4.53125
7992209,3,B00009P1MW,There was nothing terribly new or ground-breaking in this DVD. It was very similar to most other methods and advice that I have seen previously.,1357257600,2,144,4.8
7992210,5,B00009P1MW,Good DVD.  Practiced good breathing techniques and singing in your head and chest voice.,1237334400,3,88,5.285714285714286
7992211,2,B00009P1MW,"To be honest as a singer wanting to explore different opinions,i found this dvd usefull, yet a bit of a rip off by the way it is advertised. If a total beginner spent money on this item they would be left clueless. There should be some sort of grading to dvds instead of making people think that everyone will benefit from this. So a little honesty goes a long way.!!!",1212451200,11,368,4.271428571428571
7992212,5,B00009P1MW,"I think this DVD offers amazing value - you get several professional singing lessons for under twenty bucks. McElroy concentrates on breathing and breath control, and if you come away from this DVD with a few solid exercises to help you improve your breath management while singing, you will have gotten your money's worth (how many breaths did you need to draw to finish this sentence?).

McElroy offers a general approach on how to make up your own vowel exercises, rather than assigning you specific ones to memorize. She gives pointers on taking care of your voice (e.g. start humming right after you get up to loosen phlegm and warm up, rather than coughing or clearing your throat; and avoid coffee - it dehydrates). She also provides useful suggestions on how to manage the break from chest to head voice and back while singing.

I found McElroy's example itself a source of inspiration: her powerful voice, confident rhythm and how both are so much a part of her that her singing seems to just happen by itself, smoothly, beautifully and *right*. There is valuable information and advice in everything she says - but you really have to pay close attention and think about it carefully. If you're only half-listening you may think you've heard it all before and not ""hear"" the intended message. And of course you need to *practice*, not just sit and watch and then forget everything you just learned.

I was also impressed that the example song used in the teaching was written by McElroy herself. This got the producers around copyright issues, but it was also well suited to the singing style McElroy is trying to teach.",1185494400,14,1629,4.790035587188612
7992213,2,B00009P1MW,"I thought that this video was so strange becase you would have to know a lot about music theory and almost nothing about singing to watch it. It also had almost zero actual technique or exercises that you could practice. I was excited about it, because I'm interested in non-classical, non-white western european approaches to singing, I'm a singing teacher, but this was just sad. The woman seems unprepared and uncomfortable throughout the whole video.",1179187200,14,454,5.066666666666666
