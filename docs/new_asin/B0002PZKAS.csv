Bringing Up Baby and other movies are better.",1491696000,,84,5.071428571428571
8030477,2,B0002PZKAS,"This is a review for the Miracle Pictures DVD of PENNY SERENADE
combined with HIS GIRL FRIDAY for which I have given a rating of 2 1/2 stars.

Despite the very low price this DVD of the Howard Hawks screwball remake of THE FRONT PAGE, HIS GIRL FRIDAY seems to be intact and has pretty good video quality.
Not the greatest but at these prices, how can you complain?

Well, I'll tell you how you can complain: On this version of PENNY SERENADE there are at least three or four minutes missing, crucial minutes that are an important part of the story.

Cary Grant is pleading his case before a judge, this scene is  supposedly  the highlight of his performance, but on this Miracle Pictures DVD version Grant doesn't even start his plea before we are jumped to the next scene with Cary Grant telling Irenne Dunne that the problem is resolved and ""We'll never have to worry about that again.""

Well, thanks to Miracle Pictures we'll never have to worry about it because we haven't been told about it.  Again, with a Public Domain picture you don't expect perfection but it would be helpful if the story made sense and you didn't spend the rest of the picture--which is a classic--mentally scratching your noggin about what was really said or might have happened.

Otherwise this release of PENNY SERENADE isn't bad but I would prefer to watch a classic film that makes sense and has a creditable continuity regardless of price.",1258848000,5,1423,4.619047619047619
8030478,5,B0002PZKAS,movies like this will never come again!  Penny Serenade I watched as a young girl..cried so hard I thought the world would end.......and then---watching it again made me remember my fondest dreams of childhood...and how amazing the human spirit is....life goes on...and the laughter from His Girl Friday....so touching these old fashioned notions we had!  Nice to go back to simpler times and revisit the sweetness.,1199059200,,415,5.2727272727272725
