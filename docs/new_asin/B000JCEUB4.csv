8575186,5,B000JCEUB4,"As a beginner bellydancer I really enjoyed the variety of moves and props used by dancers in this DVD - everything from multiple scarves, to canes, zills, and a spectacular dance with isis wings. In the intro section one of the dancers responsible for organising the project is filmed giving lessons and providing her opinions on bellydance. Interviews with the other dancers and the owner of the venue are interspersed between the improv performances, giving a real sense of what motivates and inspires the women and their supporters.

The costumes, women, moves and music are beautiful and varied. The camera angles compliment the performances and the use of close ups is appropriate.",1206921600,,686,5.125
