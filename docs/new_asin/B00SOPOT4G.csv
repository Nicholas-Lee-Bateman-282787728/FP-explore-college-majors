6991832,5,B00SOPOT4G,"I think this anime is wonderful ! Upbeat, light hearted and adorable ! Jessica Nigri does a good voice over, considering this is her first anime. The Japanese voice actresses, especially Ayano Yamamoto, do a great job. If you are into the light hearted, upbeat, adorable animes that convey Japanese culture in these thems then this is for you ! There is alittle fan service if that is your thing as well.",1436140800,,404,4.625

6991834,4,B00SOPOT4G,"I love jessica, but she really does need some work on her voice acting. I bought this and was really surprised at how bad she is at the voice acting. Everyone else is wonderful and it's a great show. But I think they probably should have chose someone else for Sonico.",1432771200,8,268,4.2745098039215685
6991835,5,B00SOPOT4G,took past the 2 days on prime but still a great light hearted anime. Great distraction from the Bernie and Hillary babble going on,1458172800,,130,4.458333333333333

6991837,4,B00SOPOT4G,"I liked this series for what it was, a lighthearted, easygoing watch. Not too deep, though there were some episodes that made me think. No nudity or anything too sexual in nature (boo, Sonico is basically a sex symbol...). The artwork and animation are top notch, though the story is somewhat mediocre. I will say that Sonico dresses up as one of my favorite other characters in one episode (Kirisu Makise) and that was pretty awesome. A good buy if you're into her, the artwork alone is justification to buy if you can appreciate it.",1451260800,,534,4.631578947368421

6991844,4,B00SOPOT4G,"I actually think the english dub added to the experience. There's more life to it, verses the Japanese version, which was good, but it was also a little dull by comparison. But that's just me. True, this is Jessica Nigri's first anime role, but I think she does a pretty good job. I'd like to here more from her.",1436227200,2,312,4.305084745762712
8698992,5,B00SOPOT4G,This is good I recommend.,1518307200,,25,4.2
8698993,5,B00SOPOT4G,"Very inspiring, especially considering that I'm a musician myself. There is some fan service when it comes to Sonico's part time job but her innocent character tames those aspects.",1517875200,,180,5.241379310344827

8698998,5,B00SOPOT4G,Enjoyable! Helps to be a Sonico and anime fan first though....lol,1479945600,,65,5.0
8698999,4,B00SOPOT4G,"While this is a lively anime, with fan service (especially Soni Ani), I couldn't give it 5 stars. Soni is very busy, although not the brightest girl. It's a fun anime, but there's no real ending. If you can get it at a deal, I say go for it. But don't expect too much for a story line. I did enjoy it, but I also didn't pay top dollar.",1461628800,2,335,3.869565217391304
8699000,4,B00SOPOT4G,I love sonico and the show. But honestly I like the Japanese version better. Her voice went more with the character and her personality. Nigiri is cool and she does okay but I guess it's just not all there for me. She needs a little more practice.,1460764800,,247,4.276595744680851
