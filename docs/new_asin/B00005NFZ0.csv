1632218,4,B00005NFZ0,"This movie is good but boring plot.  I only watch the fighting parts & I like the 1st 5 minutes of the movie. The performance with the tall flags( I think that's what it is called in high school when them cheer leader girls practices them)
using acrobatic kung fu skills is bad ass.",1387497600,,282,4.222222222222222
1632219,5,B00005NFZ0,This is a great movie. I love Phillip Kwok. He is great in this movie. The Venoms are great in this movie. The action is very good. If you like Kung Fu movie then get this one.,1356393600,,176,3.7837837837837838
1632220,4,B00005NFZ0,"i love this movie it's one of my favorite filled with treachery and excitment this one will surely entertain you, i think it's a classic and recommend that you definitely give it a watch,philip kwok at his best, i am a fan of shaw brothers movies and i consider them to be one of the best martial arts producers, again i will make it clear kung-fu movies are triditionally low budget so the acting, special effect and audio ,may not be the greatest, even the editing may be weak, but it's definitely a classic movie for you collection laters folks.",1161820800,,548,4.49
1632221,4,B00005NFZ0,"One of the best Shaw Brothers old school flicks I've ever seen.  If you don't know anything about this flick and the Venom Mob, you are not obviously a Shaw Brothers fan or this one was just ""too much before your time - old timer.""  In this one, you will only see three of the famous five Venoms.

This one is full of action all the way through.  Full of lies, treachery, and betrayal - you can't sleep and you don't know who you could really trust.

The plot picks up with the usual theme - two rival schools not liking eachother.  The Eagles invites The Iron Flag to their school for a meal as a gesture of good faith and for settling their differences.  The real motive was to get them on their ground and wipe them out in an ambush.  The Iron Flag not trusting this ""so called kind gesture"" hires a hitman - The Spearman, to step in at the first sign of danger.  Although The Iron Flag were victorious, their master was set up to be killed by the eldest member of their own school (played by Lu Feng) who had also hired The Spearman.  During the heated portion of the fight, their teacher was killed.  Unknowingly to The Spearman, the teacher was a good man.  The Spearman later realized that after killing the teacher of The Iron Flag, he had been set up by the same person that hired him.

After the death of their teacher, Lu Feng becomes the head.  He convinces Kuo Chui (the most versatile and gifted of the Venoms) to go into exile in order to take the heat off of the school and return later when things have smoothed over.  He promised to send him money and look after his needs while in exile.  Kuo never received any money from Lu Feng.  Instead, he was constantly on guard because someone had hired ten killers to wipe him out.  Kuo outclassed and outmatched all of them.

Kuo later learned that the name of his school had changed and that it was Lu Feng who hired the ten killers.  He also learned that Lu Feng had joined forces with the rival school and began to run brothels and gambling rings.  When Kuo returned, he did not receive a warm welcome.  Lu Feng was still plotting behind the scenes to get rid of him and using his own followers as scapegoats to do it.

Flag-draped spears were the overall weapons of choice in this one.  Usually the battle with spears can be a bit boring, but not in this one.  The Venoms are the best at fighting with spears that you can get.

I would have given this flick five stars, but some of the scenes were cut out.  I have this one on VHS and it's much longer.  Why did they cut it? I don't have a clue.  My version is quite clear - a pretty decent transfer at best. Even though some of the scenes were cut out, you will not go wrong watching this.  Be careful to watch out for the millions of bootleg copies floating around out there.",1146873600,2,2793,4.224952741020794
1632222,5,B00005NFZ0,"This version is all right on DVD but some parts are missing. The ten deadly killers after Kuo Chui had just killed the Axe Man with Chiang Sheng was longer because the axe was left behind and Chiang Sheng was wondering who does that belong to? Kuo Chui points down int the well where he placed the body and they continue on about the appearance of the 10 deadly killers along with the saying ""The axeman and the spearman, the butcher boy, the fortune teller, the bookkeeper, the young kid, the old man with the three youths,"" All of that is missing from the dvd version. If you want to check out the VHS version --- go to [...] to get it and check it out. Other than that --- one of the reviewers was right Chiang Sheng didn't do much fighting in this film, only in the beginning and near the end. Hope this helps whoever is a true fan of the Shaw brothers films",1102291200,6,862,4.198795180722891

7946812,4,B00005NFZ0,"For a Venom movie, this underrated gem really flies under the radar.  The fight choreography might actually be even better than in their more famous movies, and, as usual, all  the principle actors really commit to their characters, silly and one dimensional they may be.
The only thing holding this movie back is a very convoluted plot, where there is absolutely no need to go there.  As great as the fights are, they seem almost pointless; with plot barely finding reasons for confrontation.
There are also way too many fighters, and it's hard to keep track of who does what and why.",1520812800,,585,4.715686274509804

In the Iron Flag clan, the chief has been tricked to be killed.  He realizes that it's an inside job, he tried to offer his seat to one of the more trustworthy students before his death, but is interjected by the senior student.  The senior student takes over the clan and acts as he is very diplomatic when in fact he was scheming to get rid of all those who would be against him and for him to permanently restructure the clan.  He exiled the chief's trustworthy student and his closest ally, and then merges with the Eagle clan to run the casino and brothel.

7946814,5,B00005NFZ0,"If you are a martial arts film fan, then this movie is a MUST!!  I love kung fu films, particularly the Wuxia genre, which refers to stories that take place in ancient China.  They have swords, spears, staves, axes, hammers, brass rings,.....wielded by heroes in amazing costumes and exaggerated hair styles.  The best of the lot are the ones produced by the Shaw Brothers and directed by the legendary Chang Cheh.  And to further break it down, the ""venom"" films would top my list.  But if I had to choose one, and its not easy, it would have to be ""The Flag of Iron"" or ""The Spearmen of Death"".  I'm sure everyone has heard this before, but this one has it all.  I like Wuxia because of the incredible display of acrobatics by the highly skilled actors.  The Iron Flag has non stop fighting, action and acrobatics.  It stars ""venom"" favorites, Li Wang, Sheng Chiang and Phillip Kwok who is now a fight choreographer.  Though its a simple revenge story, its actually quite involved with plenty of surprises and twists.  And there is a lot of blood in this movie, not to mention a HIGH body count.  What is fun about this film are the various assassins and their unique fighting styles and techniques, some of which border on the silly.  For me, the movie never got boring, even in the non fight sequences because of Chiang's and Kwok's believable friendship and charm.  The title refers to the weapon's used by the ""Iron Flag Clan"".  Its literally a flag with a spear tip.  It sounds funny, but in the film, they make it work.  A great kung fu flick, definitely worth a view.",1497225600,,1576,4.512367491166078
7946815,5,B00005NFZ0,"I personally label what is deemed as a Venoms movie into 2 categories: a full Venom movie (featuring Kuo Chui, Chiang Shang, Lu Feng, Lo Mang & Sun Chien) & a core Venom movie (with only Kuo Chui, Chiang Sheng & Lu Feng). This Chang Cheh-directed vehicle falls into the core Venom category. The film, also known for its US title Spearman of Death, follows the exploits of the Iron Flag clan who's a law-abiding group of brothers with a distaste for illegal operations. When brothers Iron Panther (Kuo Choi) & Iron Monkey (Chiang Shang) has a run-in with their rivals of the Eagle clan, this leads to a dinner meeting with the two factions where an untimely death in the clan forces Iron Leopard (Lu Feng) to lead the group & Iron Panther to go into hiding for the sake of the clan. What follows from there is a set of events which include the appearance of the 10 deadly paid assassins out to eliminate Iron Panther as well as his awkward alliance with the Man in White (Lung Tien Hsiang).

Kuo Chui shines brightly in his role as a brother torn between loyalty to the clan & digging deep to find out who was behind that untimely death no matter where the search ends. Chiang Sheng delivers as Iron Panther's brother in arms who too is forced to align with Lung Tien Hsiang. Lung Tien Hsiang sells you big time as the mysterious Man in White in his 2nd major & his most famous role under the Shaw Brothers umbrella. Lu Feng was his fiendish & conniving self as the complex Iron Leopard. Wang Li & Yu Tak Ping are equally as good as the former Eagle brothers who gets blended into the Iron Flag clan while still keeping the shady practices going. The action in this is a joy to behold & the storyline is quite unique which keeps you glued to your proverbial seats. Overall, yet another reason why the Shaw Brothers films rises above the mundane & delivers!!!",1497225600,,1857,4.41399416909621
