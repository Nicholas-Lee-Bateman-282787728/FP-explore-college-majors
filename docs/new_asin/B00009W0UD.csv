1891313,2,B00009W0UD,"Brock Lesnar was spoiled,that why i think he left so early. First off he desroys one of the greatest tag teams the hardys(by himself) within his 1st month in the wwe,then in about his second month he wins KOTR then in his 4th month he goes 1 on 1 with the great one the rock(on this dvd) a 7 time champ in a decent match to win the undisputed title I believe he's the fastest rising star peroid. Then defeats the phenom in HIAC(on this dvd) is this guy getting a big push or what then losses to big show who has to cheat like for the first time in his career to win the title. Angle who is great has to have brock cheat for him to win the title. then WOW WHAT A SUPRISE BROCK WINS THE RUMBLE! LOL! of course. Then his 1st WM he main events, its no lie in a pretty good match(also on this dvd) especially when this big 295 pound idiot tries to do a shooting star press whis he supposed to perfected in OVWand lands flat on his face,but honestly seeing it live was crazy,we go back stage maybe he's so freaking dizzy he don't know he won the title because he's not happy he looks like he's drunk. then skip john cena and go to the strecher match with big show(also on dvd) in also a good match ok let's face he was good but everything was handed to him that's why i think he left things were too easy",1145145600,,1298,4.015444015444015
1891314,3,B00009W0UD,"A collection of matches and highlights featuring former WWE superstar, Brock Lesnar. A young and athletic superstar, Lesnar was crowned ""The Next Best Thing"" upon his arrival in the WWF in 2002. During a period when wrestling was really at an all-time low, Brock impressed many with some tremendous matches against opponents like The Undertaker, Kurt Angle, Big Show, and The Rock to name a few. This DVD was compiled before Lesnar left wrestling for a chance to play pro football. Like other superstar DVD's, it features an hour-long look at the star's career with exclusive interviews and career highlights as well as ""bonus matches"" shown in their entirety. ""Here Comes The Pain"" is one of the better WWE DVD's of recent memory.",1126396800,8,731,4.951219512195122
1891315,5,B00009W0UD,"What an impact BROCK LESNAR had in the wrestling world! It is almost incredible to see him as a skinny kid and then transformed into the real HULK without the green. No other wrestler had such a fast climb to the championship of this great sport,but BROCK is no ordinary athlete. I enjoyed watching all the fights ,especally the one against KURT ANGLE that shows wrestling at it's finest. Just to see that was worth the price because i had not seen WRESTLEMANIA XIX.Beating up HOGAN,THE ROCK,THE UNDERTAKER,BIG SHOW and KURT ANGLE in less than two years is really something. I hope that BROCK LESNAR will return in WWE someday. After all,he is still very young,and the industry needs athletes like him. As much as i respect HOGAN and FLAIR for their past achievements ,they are now over fifty and can not carry wrestling anymore.",1124323200,,829,4.724137931034483
1891316,4,B00009W0UD,"This DVD was released in the summer of 2003 after Brock had only been in the WWE for a year and a half.  Unfortunately, he has since left the WWE and has tried to start a career in the NFL.  The DVD is actually pretty decent.  The main part of the DVD is a biography about the life of Lesnar.  It follows him in his days growing up, as a high school and college wrestler, and his young career in the WWE.

Again the WWE goes all out with DVD extras.  This particular DVD contains six bonus matches.

1. Brock Lesnar vs. Hulk Hogan (8/15/2002 Smackdown)

If Hogan were to win this match, he would take away Lesnar's number one contendership to face The Rock for the Undisputed title at Summerslam.  Not the best match, but the crowd was into it and it is important for historical perspectives.  This match shows the brutality of Lesnar.  (8/10)

2. Brock Lesnar vs. The Rock (Summerslam 2002 - WWE Undisputed Title)

This is Brock's first great match in the WWE.  It really showed what Brock could do because he had to try to keep the crowd into the match after the amazing HBK/Triple H match.  The crowd was on their feet the whole time.  They actually started cheering for Brock and booing The Rock.  There are tons of reversals in this match and a pretty decent announce table bump.  (9/10)

3. Brock Lesnar vs. Undertaker (No Mercy 2002 - WWE Championship/Hell In A Cell)

This was not the most exciting and fast paced match you will see, but it is one the most brutal.  Lesnar bleeds for most of the match and The Undertaker bleeds like no one has bled before.  (8.5/10)

4. Brock Lesnar vs. Kurt Angle (Wrestlemania 19 - WWE Championship)

I was looking extremely forward to this match.  Unfortunatly, Angle hurt his neck and was going to miss the match.  He decided to go on with the match, risking possible paralysis and even death.  For this reason, the match was not as good as it could have been, but it still turned out to be probably one the ten best matche sof the year.  Amazing and scary spot when Lesnar does the shooting star press.  (9/10)

5. Brock Lesnar vs. Big Show (Judgment Day 2003 - WWE Championship/Stretcher Match)

These two competitors built up quite the rivalry in towards the end of 2002 and into 2003.  I was a little disappointed in this match because the WWE built this up to be a very bloody, brutal encounter, which did not happen.  Nonetheless, it was still an exciting match.  Good spot with Lesnar jumping off the forklift.  (8.5/10)

6. Brock Lesnar vs. Big Show (6/10/2003 Smackdown - WWE Championship)

Not a great match, but it shows one of the craziest moments in WWE history.  The ring collapses under the weight of Lesnar and Big Show.  You have to see it to believe it.  (7/10)

Other extras include: two Confidential segments, training for Summerslam by Brock and The Rock, and Brock's personal video diary on his first Summerslam experience.

This is a good DVD.  I recomend picking it up, but it is not a necessity into your WWE collection.

1891317,5,B00009W0UD,"I am a HUGE wrestling fan. My g/f bought this for me recently. It is a great dvd. It has extra matches that I have never seen. Well some of them. I can't get PPV so some of these matches were a treat. Brock and Rock at summerslam i watched twice and think it is a great match. Brock and Big show in their stretcher match was great too surprisingly. It goes into detail how Brock got started in the business and all. He went from a skinny little kid to a big monster. I recommend this dvd for any wrestling fan. Of course non wrestling fans are more harder to please. Check this out,you won't be disappointed.",1065657600,,608,4.161016949152542
1891318,5,B00009W0UD,"I thought I would make a review after the DVD was released and give actual facts of the DVD and it's features. Unlike the first four yahoos that just wanted to put in their two cents in before they knew anything. It turned out that they had no clue after all, big shock there. The first chapter of the DVD is the Brock Lesnar segment from Before They Were WWE Superstars 2, and is the only chapter that you actually hear from Brock. The rest of the DVD is Superstars, Officials, Agents, and other WWE personnel speaking very candidly and as them self's and NOT as their ""turned up"" ring personas. What Paul Hymen contributes is great cause you get to see him as a man and not the little worm he plays on SMACKDOWN! Other contributors include Big Show, Dreamer, Rey, Cena, Angle, and many many more. You learn of the extent of Lesnar's WM19 injury and other great stuff. Unlike what one of the other ""review writers"" wrote these events are not highlighted, (WWE SMACKDOWN! Ring collapsing, (it is shown but as a clip, it is not even talked about), WWE SMACKDOWN Shut Your Mouth commercial w/Lesnar, or the making of the SMACKDOWN! SYM commercial.) His ""inside information"" was more like outside information that much is obvious. If you want to write a review, I don't know wait till the product is released and state the truth, and not what your ""sources"" or imagination tells you.
In all, this DVD get a 5 Star rating. It is a great piece of business.

F-5: A tornado of devastating, destructive power. Strong enough to send automobiles airborne, damage reinforced concrete structures and lift frame houses from their foundations.
Brock Lesnar: ""The Next Big Thing"" is a force to be reckoned with since his arrival in WWE. The Hardy Boyz, Rob Van Dam, Hulk Hogan, the Rock, Undertaker, Big Show & Kurt Angle have all been left in crumpled heaps ringside. And before the end of his rookie year, he became the youngest WWE Champion in history. WWE has never been rocked by a more powerful and devastating force of nature than Brock Lesnar!

1891320,3,B00009W0UD,"I guess the WWE was ahead on thinking about this release. When I originally wrote this review, I don't think as fans we ever thought Brok would leave.
Now instead of it being to early, this collection is a nice summation of a career that was much to short.
On a personal note, I do think he was given to much to soon as it relates to the Heavyweight Title.
I don't understand why the WWE rushes to do stuff like this. This happened years ago for both Chris Jericho & Kurt Angle. WWE (then the WWF) made VHS tapes for both guys when they really didn't make a true impact yet, this was also before WWF had access to WCW footage. There are tons of other guys that deserve a DVD before Brock. I am a Brock fan, but he's got a whole career ahead of him.(Yeah right) He hasn't even begun to scratch the surface. I would rather see a DVD for Chris Jericho like they did with Rey Mysterio where they have matches from various organizations or Rob Van Dam who had an impressive career in ECW (I would kill to have the footage on DVD when ECW invaded RAW the first time). I would also like to see a RAW matches DVD. They make Best of RAW but those are mostly segments, where are the great matches they have had over the years?
Not to mention there are a ton of ""From the Vault"" DVD's they can do...Andre the Giant, Randy Savage, Ricky Steamboat, and that's just the guys from the late 70's & 80's.
I don't think WWE thinks about their fanbase, they are always trying to attract the casual fan. Casual fans don't buy the DVD's these are for the diehards. Please Vince make us happy!

To the match for the WWE Undisputed Championship VS. The Rock. To winning the 2003 Royal Rumble and beating Kurt Angle for the WWE Championship at Wrestlemania XIX. Also, it goes in depth and behind the scences from Brock flying on the WWE plane and pre- match and post match interviews.

It was very interesting seeing him talk for as much as he did on the DVD because I've never seen him talk so much before, Brock Lesnar is truely a beast in the ring which makes his matches so intense and enjoyable to watch.

1891338,5,B00009W0UD,"This Blu-ray was a decade in the making. WWE's single-disc release of Brock's first year back in 2003 was a good release, but could have been meatier. Now with his comeback, Brock's career highlight reel has been re-done, adding SIX HOURS of bonus material to already available content. The documentary is untouched from the 2003 release, so that means it does contain a couple of blurs. The matches however only have the WWF logo highlighted with a WWE logo (kind of like late 2002 DVD releases) while the audio is uncensored. The matches with Undertaker and Kurt Angle are amongst the best matches WWE has had since the new millennium. That Unforgiven 2002 match with 'Taker, while lesser than the No Mercy Hell in the Cell, is an unloved match that can definitely get some love now. Who knew that Lesnar also had matches with Ric Flair and Hulk Hogan, decisively beating them both? In addition, Lesnar has two very good albeit very different matches against John Cena nearly ten years apart in this collection (the 2012 Extreme Rules is a BD exclusive). All of Brock's newly recorded footage introduces matches/segments rather than being spliced into the documentary, which may very well be the only negative I have against it. Little to no mention of the NFL and UFC, although it's not enough to detract from the rating. I'm giving this five stars because of the quality of the content!

1891342,4,B00009W0UD,"The BluRay rerelease is a great look atthe career of one of the most popular WWE superstars of the past 10 years.  I very much recommend it for anyone who is a fan of Brock or of wrestling in general.

A few things:
-The documentary isn't really worth watching.  It is very outdated and is pretty much throwaway.  The beginning is kind of interesting because you see Brock return to his hometown, but other than that, it isn't the reason to get this set.

-The matches, though, contain almost every Brock match or moment that is needed to summarize his career.  To start, you get his awesome debut, the early matches with Hogan and Flair, and his title win over the Rock.

-It's great to see just how good Brock got over such a short period of time.  This is shown off in some of the best matches on this set.  The Hell in a Cell match with the Undertaker might be the best Hell in a Cell match of all time.  It is so brutal that Paul Heyman even bleeds like a madman, and he never even gets in the cell!  Brock's complete disregard for his own safety always amazes me, and that is no different in this match.

-Also, his matches with Kurt Angle are great.  The Wrestlemania match is more famous, but my favorite is the Iron Man match.  THE ENTIRE UNEDITED MATCH is included here.  That makes this set worth it alone.

-Sometimes BluRay sets aren't worth buying, but this one absolutely is.  You get five matches, including a good match with Ric Flair, a great triple threat with Big Show and Kurt Angle, and Brock's return match in 2012 with John Cena.  This match is an incredible spectacle that is unlike any other WWE match from at least the past 5 years.  This is another match that is worth the price of this set alone.

Basically, this set is beyond worth it for the match selections.  The documentary isn't worth your time.  The only match that I really think should have been included that wasn't was the great match against Eddie Guerrero from No Way Out 2004.  I understand the historical reasons for including Brock vs. Goldberg, but Eddie vs. Brock is an unreal title match that should be on this.  Other than that, this set delivers.",1363996800,,2147,4.418367346938775

The seller did nothing to differentiate the 2 in the sales ad & so I was disappointed when it arrived. The disc sent was in great shape & plays well. The content is informative & entertaining.

1891345,5,B00009W0UD,I was happy WWE released this dvd set which includes extra rare matches we didn't get to see on the previous dvd. I wish they included the Cena Lesnar match from Extreme Rules. But you get Lesnar Cena from Backlash 03 great match. Big Show vs Lesnar where they break the ring. Those two put on great matches. The 60 minute iron man with Kurt Angle is also a great match featured on the dvd. Lesnar vs RVD from King of the Ring was a good match too but I preferred the match they had on the following ppv. I wish they offered an additional documentary to the dvd but we can small clips of Lesnar talking before each match about his return to WWE. Lesnar just signed a two year deal. He will be around until Wrestlemania 31. I am glad he is sticking around. It's too bad he only wrestles part time but he puts great matches with whoever he faces. Hopefully we will get to see him against The Deadman Taker before he retires.,1359331200,,922,4.214689265536723

1891351,4,B00009W0UD,"Going to attempt to review the 2012 Collector's Edition that just came out. The documentary is either the exact same one from the 2003 release, or the same one with a few bits missing. It's incredibly outdated and skips out on anything that happened after his Stretcher Match with the Big Show. Of particular interest might be the overwhelming number of comments about how Lesnar is the guy who will carry the WWE into 2004 and beyond.

As far as the matches and segments go, WWE did a good job of covering from his developmental days to his WWE debut to his exit at Wrestlemania XX. If you purchase the Blu-Ray version, there's five additional matches, with one of them being his return to the ring against Cena. Several of these haven't been put on DVD before, so if you're a collector, you probably want to pick these up. His matches with Kurt Angle are pretty much must see for any wrestling fan.

In between each match is a short clip of the semikayfabe interview he gave on Raw after he returned in 2012. Some of it is interesting, but some parts are mostly in character, and a little silly in how they contradict things like his own autobiography.

When it's all said and done, this is probably a buy for the matches, but a pass for the documentary and interviews. I'd also recommend the Blu-Ray over the DVD for the five extra matches if you have a Blu-Ray player and don't mind spending the extra money.",1351814400,4,1412,4.4863813229571985

1891353,4,B00009W0UD,"Back in 2003, WWE released a one disc DVD set of Brock Lesnar since he was definitely the biggest new superstar to come from WWE since the Attitude Era at that time.  However nobody knew that he would eventually leave the company a short time afterwords & returned almost a decade later as a bigger name than when he left due to his accomplishments in the Ultimate Fighting Championship MMA promotion causing WWE to release a ""Collector's Edition"" of this set.  Since I've actually seen both sets (and Amazon doesn't separate the original from the Collector's Edition), I'll review both of them here.

THE 2003 ORIGINAL EDITION:
The documentary covers his childhood to his first year in the WWE however you don't hear from Brock past the opening chapter of him growing up (which was taken from the ""Before They Were Superstars"" DVD series) but the rest of the DVD contains comments from various in-ring & backstage talents including Pat Patterson, Michael Hayes, Steve Lombardi, Paul Heyman, Rey Mysterio, Gerald Brisco, Booker T, John Cena, Big Show, Kurt Angle, Hurricane Helms, Bubba Dudley, Tommy Dreamer, referee Mike Chioda and his parents.  The documentary stars off with Brock visiting his hometown talking about his childhood growing up on a farm & how he got into amateur wrestling before going into his history of achievements in the sport. Him being recruited by Gerald Brisco leads into his beginnings in WWE from his early days in OVW & dark matches to his debut in WWE, how he met Paul Heyman, and things he did that kept impressing the backstage agents along with other superstars in the ring. His first major accomplishment of winning King Of The Ring & the series he had with Rob Van Dam was briefly discussed before going into discussion of his WWE Undisputed Championship match against The Rock where the fans heavily turned towards him & against The Rock. His feud with Undertaker was next with some referring to this as his big first challenge while showing highlights of their Hell In A Cell match before going into his match at Survivor Series against Big Show with Brock showcasing his freakish strength while injured along with setting him up to be a fan favorite. Kurt Angle talked about how him & Brock are both ""wrestling machines"" coming from their amateur background before showing highlights of the Road To WrestleMania leading up to their WrestleMania XIX main event with others commenting on the match with the main topic of discussion being the negative effects of Brock's Shooting Star Press & how he's lucky to walk or even be alive after that. John Cena briefly talks about their feud & match going into the Backlash PPV followed by Big Show talking about the Stretcher Match with Brock at Judgment Day in how both of them are able to bring out the best in each other while Paul Heyman points out just how similar Show & Lesnar are in real life before the documentary ends on everyone predicting the future for Brock (which we all saw in less than a year after this was really the case).

Matches Include:
vs. Hulk Hogan - Brock put up his title shot against The Rock here with Hogan starting out using a ""hit & move"" offense that knocked Brock off his game to the point where Heyman had to get involved in order for Brock to gain some momentum targeting Hogan's stomach with elbows & shoulderblocks even powerbombing Hogan out of the corner. Hogan did his traditional ""Hulking Up"" followed by the big boot & legdrop however Brock was just unstoppable to the point where he literally ""squeezed the life"" out of Hulkamania.
""SmackDown"" Aug. '02

vs. WWE Undisputed Champion The Rock - This was one of the most intense buildups to a match that WWE did around this time based off the video packages & idea that both men didn't touch leading up to this match. Rock gave an idea of exactly where this match is going with Rock sprinting to the ring with Brock throwing across the ring with a belly to belly suplex. Brock continued to show his superior strength by clothesling Rock over the barrier & pressing him above the barrier before dropping Rock on it ribs first before Brock completely focused on his ribs with shoulderblocks & waistlock bearhugs. Rock had to resort to some dirty tactics & catching Brock off guard to get some offense in taking it to the outside & slingshotting Brock in the post before taking care of Paul Heyman. With both men continuing to counter & kick out of each others signature holds, this match delivered on what it was setup to be...a highly intense match.
SummerSlam '02
[The Epic Journey Of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson; History Of The WWE Championship]

WWE Championship/Hell In A Cell Match vs. Undertaker - Undertaker came into this match with a cast on his hand & wrist due to an injury Brock caused weeks earlier by Brock & used it as a weapon right away against Lesnar to the point that Lesnar was bleeding but Taker also hurt himself in the process. Taker used whatever he could get his hands on against Brock such as being thrown into it various times while his face was grinding against it along with throwing Brock against the steel steps while Heyman tried to get involved on the outside only for him to pay the price to the point where he was busted open as well. Brock came back in a vicious manner using the ringpost & cell to ram Taker before busting him open while also using a chair to eventually break the cast over which effected Taker as we saw later when he tried to lift the steel steps. Both men kept trading momentum beating each other into exhaustion while still being able to counter each others signature moves throughout the match as this overall was a physical war to say the least to the point where everyone involved (including Heyman on the outside of cell) paying the price.
No Mercy '02
[Hell In A Cell; Tombstone: History Of The Undertaker]

vs. WWE Champion Kurt Angle - At a WrestleMania that had so many attractions such as Shawn Michaels return to WrestleMania, the 20 year grudge match between Hulk Hogan & Vince McMahon, and the third match of between The Rock & Steve Austin...these two closed out the show. In the day & age of ""sports entertainment"", this was a ""professional wrestling"" fans dream match as this played off amateur wrestling backgrounds heavily in a very technical match. This was very similar to the Austin/Michaels match in that Kurt Angle came into this match & performed to the best of his abilities with an injured neck while Brock Lesnar wouldn't walk out this match safe as he attempted a move that went wrong to the point where Brock suffered a concussion which he was lucky to get as it could have been worse & possibly broken his neck.
WrestleMania XIX
[True Story Of WrestleMania]

WWE Championship/Stretcher Match vs. Big Show - Big Show came to the ring with the stretcher he used to attack various talents over the previous weeks only for Brock to use it against Show beating on him in & out of the ring before Show as able to fight back & drop Brock onto another stretcher at ringside before returning the hits of the stretcher to Brock. Show continued to dominate using his weight & strength with moves like the big boot & legdrop while also clothesline Brock off another stretcher that had Brock landing on his head however Brock retaliated by choking Show out with the ringside cables & having enough strength to bodyslam Show onto a stretcher. Show used whatever he could get his hands on to beat on Brock weather it was stretchers or the ringside post while Brock brought the fight right back including one moment where he knocked Show off the apron onto a stretcher so hard that he bounced off. This was definitely the best encounter between both men with the stipulation of the stretcher adding to the match to the point where we had the most unique ending to this type of match in wrestling history.
Judgment Day '03

WWE Championship Match vs. Big Show - Show dominated early using the steps on the outside along with power moves like the sidewalk slam while even using a half crab submission while Brock showcased his power with his offense like the german suplex although Brock's ribs were clearly hurt. Brock Lesnar was one of the people who is able to bring out the best quality that Big Show has based off their previous encounters but this was one of those cases where something had to give...but nobody expected WHAT did end up giving away.
""SmackDown"" Jume '03
[OMG: Top 50 Incidents]

Other DVD extras include two ""Confidential"" features on his SummerSlam match showing his training routine while also recalling the experience of the match.

THE 2012 COLLECTOR'S EDITION:
Now for those who haven't seen any of WWE's previous ""Collector's Edition"" sets (Mick Foley's ""Greatest Hits & Misses"" & The Rock's ""Just Bring It""), they are just the original material released once again with additional bonus footage & matches.  Now the documentary on here is exactly the same as the original version however the DVD extras were changed as the ""Confidential"" features were removed in favor of showing his WWE debut the night after WrestleMania X8, a confrontation he had against the Hardy Boyz, and his WWE return the night after WrestleMania XXVIII.  The additional material added to this set was a two disc collection (one & a half for Blu-Ray) of Brock Lesnar's matches from his original run in WWE dating back to his developmental days in OVW to his exit in 2004 (and 2012 return match for Blu-Ray) with ""shoot"" comments from Brock himself in between each match (some were heard in that video interview shown after his 2012 return) on some subjects such as why he left, the definition of a superstar compared to him, his focus, and why he's the best athlete in WWE.  Now it should be noted that all the matches from the original version of this set were included here (Hulk Hogan, The Rock, Hell In A Cell vs. Undertaker, WrestleMania XIX vs. Kurt Angle, SmackDown vs. Big Show) except for the Stretcher Match against Big Show from Judgment Day 2003.

New Matches Added Include:
vs. Leviathan - For those who don't already know, Leviathan would later go on to be known as Batista.  You got exactly what you expected from the start with both men having similar strong body builds in power moves like Brock easily scoop slamming Batista while later being on the receiving end of a Batista spinebuster before Brock relied also on his athleticism for his size executing a springboard crossbody off the second rope.  Batista continued to rely on his power with a belly to back suplex into a sidewalk slam before grounding Brock with various chinlocks, DDT, and a stiff clothesline that saw the sweat fly off both men when it was hit with Brock also using his power such as a release belly to belly suplexes & split leg forward slam.  Since both men weren't in their prime at the same time in WWE, this was the closest we would get to a dream match between both men but it was an athletic power match between these two big men.
""OVW"" Sept '01

Minnesota Stretching Crew vs. OVW Southern Tag Team Champions Rico Constantino & Prototype - Brock was part of a tag team with his future enemy as part of Team Angle in Shelton Benjamin to take on another future adversary in Prototype who we now know as John Cena.  This was mostly a showcasing of Brock's athleticism & strength during such moments as countering Cena's attempt at a hip toss into an over the shoulder toss & late executing a standing dropkick as the tag match was pretty basic with Rico & Prototype working over the smaller member on the team in Benjamin isolating Brock building to the hot tag.
""OVW"" Nov. '01

vs. Jeff Hardy - This was Brock's official in-ring debut as Jeff tried to use the ""stick & move"" strategy against Brock getting a few moves over time such as the Whisper In The Wind & Swanton Bomb but Brock would be able to dominate with power whenever he tossed him such as suplexing Jeff across the ring, F5, and various back to back powerbombs resulting in a finish that's rarely seen in WWE as Jeff was just a body for Brock to destroy.
Backlash '02

King Of The Ring Finals vs. Rob Van Dam - This King Of The Ring tournament final was different than the previous years events as the winner would also receive a WWE Championship match at SummerSlam. RVD tried attempted the strategy of ""hit & move"" when it came to Brock but he eventually did catch him into a powerbomb. Brock had the superior power advantage which he showcased like hold RVD over this shoulder before driving him into the corner & a powerslam before RVD took advantage of Brock's momentum to get some hits in & even hit the 5 Star Frog Splash but Brock still kept coming including catching RVD in mid-air to deliver an F5. This was a short & sweet match which did it's job in continuing to display Brock as an unstoppable athletic monster.
King Of The Ring '02
[Best Of King Of The Ring]

w/Undertaker vs. Rob Van Dam & Ric Flair - This was in interesting setup for it's time as Brock was facing the man who he beat to become King Of The Ring & set to face at the upcoming Vengeance PPV (RVD) & the man who he also cost the ownership of RAW (Flair) but the most interesting part was that his parter was the current WWE Undisputed Champion when Brock was already set to challenge the WWE Undisputed Champion at the SummerSlam PPV.  Both RVD & Flair singled out Taker with RVD using his educated feet with kicks while Flair focused on the legs before Brock was tagged in & dominated with his strength causing Flair to resort to his ""Dirtiest Player In The Game"" tactics while being able to avoid Brock that caused Brock to hurt his own shoulder as things heavy with one man being able to hit one impactful signature move after another.  This was a fun tag match but with the bigger story being what happened afterwords that would be the beginning steps of a situation that we would later see develop over time.
""RAW"" July '02

vs. Randy Orton - Orton put up a fight & was able to get some offense in but this was just an overall dominate & powerful showcasing of Brock including the unique way he was able to execute the F5 with the only relevance here being how unusual it is to see Orton in this role compared to what he would become over the next decade.
""SmackDown"" Sept. '02

WWE Championship Match vs. Undertaker - Taker was able to take Brock out of his game by constantly knocking him out of the ring frustrating him causing Heyman to cause a distraction for Brock to get an advantage only for Heyman himself to get a boot in the face for his troubles. Brock worked over the midsection with shoulders in the corner & a grounded bearhug before Taker rebounded including a punch that caused Brock to lose his balance as the fight went to the outside with Brock causing Taker to bleed. Referees started getting knocked out left & right while Taker took care of attempted interference by an ally of Brock & Heyman before Undertaker delivered the most brutal unprotected chairshot I've ever seen in my life that caused the seat of the chair to bend in half & Brock bleeding. This match just got completely out of control causing the final referee to throw the match out but Taker would leave the lasting impression by throwing Brock through the Unforgiven set. This was a teaser to setup the Hell In A Cell match for next month but Taker gave Brock more of a challenge than anyone did before him.
Unforgiven '02

Royal Rumble Match - This was joined in progress as Brock entered at #29 after defeating Big Show earlier in the night to get the spot & was very dominate from the start elimination two people at the same time while giving an F5 to another over the top for elimination.  Other highlights during the rest of this match include the return of Undertaker & having ""deja vu"" with Maven, A-Train's dominance, the reunion of the Brothers Of Destruction, and the face to face confrontation between Lesnar & Taker.
Royal Rumble '03

vs. Team Angle - This was pretty much a basic handicap match where Brock was able to stay in control whenever he went one on one against either Hass for Benjamin causing them to either rely on taking a cheap shot on the apron, double teaming, or distractions by Kurt Angle & Paul Heyman at ringside including using a chair only for Brock to eventually use their tactics against them.
As a side note, anyone paying attention to the commentary here (since they were heavily plugging it during the match) knows that Brock would get to pick any member of Team Angle to meet in a steel cage match the next week on SmackDown but since they don't show the aftermath here or the cage match on this set, Brock picked Heyman & eventually got his F5 in on Heyman taking him out of for several months including WrestleMania.
""SmackDown"" Feb. '03

WWE Championship Match vs. John Cena - Cena was out for revenge here for Brock injuring his leg months earlier & jumped Brock before the bell only for Brock to quickly regain control using his power like two backbreakers & suplexes, an elevated slam, and Cena being tossed into the announce table.  Cena was able to use Brock's momentum against him sending him into the steps to take control targeting the cut on his head using the steps & ringpost, legdrop on his head while it was on the ropes, and DDT to the point where Brock was bleeding.  They went back & forth with Brock using his strength & superior wrestling ability while Cena stuck to his brawling style & even some dirty tactics at times to the point where the winner wasn't dominate more than he was able to catch the other guy.
Backlash '03
[John Cena: Word Life]

Iron Man Match vs. WWE Champion Kurt Angle - Before I get started, it should be noted that this match is completely unedited which means that we get the complete match without the commercial breaks from start to finish. Brock Lesnar made his intentions clear in the first few minutes from attacking Kurt before the bell, faking injuries to get cheap shots in, the way he lost his first fall but gained a heavy advantage throughout the rest of the match because of it that he was going to do anything to regain the championship. Kurt stuck to his gameplan of out-wrestling Brock which we saw early as he kept tossing Brock to the outside only to get him more frustrated each time while during the match & later even going out of his usual playbook with aerial offense such as a missile dropkick from the top. Both men started to get more aggressive with their various moves as the match went on such as Brock using Kurt's own anklelock & Angle Slam while Angle later executed an F-5 of his own into the ringpost, an F-5 on the floor, back to back german suplexes including one release one that flipped Brock inside out, the steel steps coming into play at various times, and Brock's impactful powerbombs & superplex. This was a wrestling clinic & one of the best ironman matches (if not THE BEST) in WWE history.
""SmackDown"" Sept. '03
[Greatest Wrestling Stars Of The 21st Century]

WWE Championship Match vs. Rey Mysterio - This was not only Mysterio's birthday but also in his hometown of San Diego as Rey tried to use the strategy in that he was so quick that he was able to have Brock chasing after him in & out of the ring to tire himself out & get frustrated to the point where he grabbed the ringside steps only for Rey to take advantage of that too along with using his momentum against him with with moves like the sunset flip, head scissors, and crossbody.  Brock had to resort to dirty tactics to finally catch Rey before attempting to ground him with Mysterio still using his superior speed before Brock was eventually able to catch him before with impactful moves to the point where he was able to isolate Rey.  This was the ""David vs. Goliath"" type of match but a very good match using that story.
""SmackDown"" Dec. '03

w/Special Referee Steve Austin vs. Goldberg - This was one of the most unique matches in not only WrestleMania history but in the history of the company as I believe this is the first time that both wrestlers were leaving the company after the match.  With the news leaking just a few weeks prior, the NYC crowd let them have it non-stop with the chants of ""You Sold Out"" while also singing ""Hey, Hey, Hey...GOODBYE!"" along with Austin getting the most cheers to the point where he had to smurk at that.  Both men kept having stalemates & stalling for around the first 5 minutes which only had the crowd chanting even more like ""This Match Sucks!""  Both men were able to hit their trademark finishers only to kick out & question Austin about the count before the eventual finish but this would have gone down as one of the most disappointing matches in history as it didn't live up to the hype & neither man really giving a strong showing on the way out but it was the crowd that made this match with all the heckling & jeers along with what happened afterwords that ""stunned"" both Brock & Goldberg.
WrestleMania XX

(Blu-Ray) vs. Ric Flair - To top the challenge Kurt Angle did on SmackDown where he challenged a rookie (resulting in John Cena's debut), Brock challenged a veteran with Flair answering the challenge looking for revenge for Brock costing him his ownership of RAW.  Brock showcased his superior power against Flair early with responding with his trademark chops as they traded off momentum before Brock was able to kick out so strongly that Flair leaped over the referee.  Flair was able to avoid Brock using his momentum against him causing Brock to hurt his shoulder before Flair resorted to ""dirty tactics"" of his own that saw Brock in the most pain he's been in to date before it took Flair taking his eye off the ball for a moment allowing Brock to take advantage.  This was a good match on RAW that put over the purpose of Brock beating a legend while Flair still looked strong.
""RAW"" July '02

(Blu-Ray) vs. WWE Undisputed Champion The Rock vs. Triple H - This match occurred on WWE's first tour of Austrailia in over 15 years while it was also Triple H's first match in two months.  Triple H showcased why he was called the ""cerebral assassin"" during the first half of the match as he formed alliances with both Rock & Brock at various times to take the other man out with Lesnar showing his inexperience at one point after he did all the work on Rock only for Triple H to do a pin attempt yet didn't attempt to break up the pin which would have cost him the title match as well.  It would eventually become ""every man for himself"" with all 3 fighting each other with Lesnar being the dominate one to the point where he kicked out of both mens finishers, had Triple H bleeding, & even had Paul Heyman got involved from time to time.  This was a great triple threat match that saw unlikely alliances, everyone facing off with each other, and all the finishers were hit at one point.
Global Warning Tour '02

(Blu-Ray) w/Kurt Angle & Mr. America vs. Big Show & World's Greatest Tag Team - There were many stories coming into this match as Brock & Show were feuding with each other over the WWE Championship, Kurt Angle returned to WWE since WrestleMania getting himself in the middle of their feud while also firing Charlie Hass & Shelton Benjamin from Team Angle who then renamed themselves The World's Greatest Tag Team, and Mr. America was Hulk Hogan underneath a mask who Mr. McMahon wanted unmasked & gone from WWE with him hiring Big Show to take care of that problem.  This was one of those fun tag team matches where everyone got a moment to showcase their strengths against the other but this match is mostly remembered for it being the last appearance of Hulk Hogan in WWE for almost 2 years allowing Big Show to have the claim of ""retiring Hulk Hogan in Madison Square Garden.""
""SmackDown"" June '03

(Blu-Ray) WWE Championship Match vs. Kurt Angle vs. Big Show - Big Show at the period was unable to take the title away from Brock despite being his biggest threat to the title while Kurt Angle just returned from his post-WrestleMania neck surgery setting up this triple threat for the title.  Show showcased his dominance from the start when he chokeslammed Brock in the first minute but when Kurt broke it up, Show went into the strategy of ""divide & conquer"" by keeping Angle in the ring & Brock on the outside causing Angle & Brock to team up on Show using trash can lids & double teaming but Show was just too much being able to counter their attempts like a double suplex & executing a double chokeslam.  Angle & Brock still kept trying to work together only for them to turn on each other when one went for the pin with Brock F5ing anyone in sight before busting Angle open on the outside & even taking down Big Show with a running powerbomb.  The action got turned it up even more with a chair coming into the match, people being put through table, Brock being busted open in the process, Brock F5ing Angle over the top rope, Angle returning the favor with a german suplex that turned Brock inside out, and Big Show's double chokeslam once again.  Very athletic & competitive triple threat match with everyone involved.
Vengeance '03

(Blu-Ray) Extreme Rules Match vs. John Cena - For those trivia fans, this is a rematch from 9 years earlier this same month (called ""Backlash"" back then) with Cena having the rival chants again before the first entrance was made while it should be noted that Cena wore his own chain & lock to the ring from this ""Thuganomics"" days. Cena charged Brock right away to take him down only for Brock to knock Cena right back down with a powerful clothesline going into his ""ground & pound"" offense bust Cena open at the top of his head within the first minute causing the match to be stopped twice. Brock came back with back & back suplexes as Brock countered the second attempt & dominate Cena pounding on that open cut & his ribs. Cena's arm was the next target for Brock with his kamara armbar in the ring & on the outside while also throwing Cena into the barrier & ringpost shoulder first. The referees kept falling like flies from either getting in the way or getting knocked out themselves as everything they could get their hands on was used from the steel steps to Cena's chain that ended with both men bleeding. Normally I don't like the ""Cena gets beat the whole match only to come back to win"" matches but that wasn't the case here as Cena definitely sold the beating from his head to his arm throughout & even after the match while Lesnar came off like the ruthless monster heel & with the the ass-kicking (don't know how else to put it) he gave to the point where it was believable that Cena had to use his old tactics to get an advantage.
Extreme Rules '12

I mentioned earlier that Brock didn't even talk on this documentary outside of a chapter reused from another DVD set making the documentary itself nothing more than the highlight packages leading to the PPV matches along with other clips with other people talking for Brock throughout the presentation that lasted a little over an hour really just making this presentation come off as rushed more than anything else & that resulted in this being one of those presentations where the bonus matches were the true reason to get this DVD set so if you were a fan of Brock Lesnar's in-ring performance matches during this period in time then I would recommend this either set depending on his you just want his more higher profile performances (2003 version) or an overall timeline of the matches throughout his career (2012 version).",1347494400,19,27501,4.566531440162271

(Including the epic Rock vs Brock Summerslam match)  This set had it all.  My only complaint was that the length of the DVD was far too short.  Also it seemed to me like it was thrown together, kind of spur of the moment.  They went through the documentary a little too fast for my liking.  I would have loved to see this set be 2 discs but all in all it's still very solid!  I would recommend this to every collector.",1291852800,2,578,4.2
1891357,4,B00009W0UD,Good dvd but not great. The 1st 15 min of the documentary has Brock speaking and giving his story and you don't hear from him again. From there its just other wrestlers giving  his side of the story. Wish there was more storyline with brock in the documentary but other wise good documentary.

I think  now that Brock is  a real world champion  in the UFC this DVD is made even more interesting when  you watch the interviews  and hear the comments...like Kurt Angle saying...""put him in the octagon  and  he'll be the world champion""! of course Kurt is also the REAL deal..a Gold Medalist who pretends to wrestle for TNA now. OH..and lest you think  I am not down with wrestling entertainers..wrong.. i love the stuff!

1891359,4,B00009W0UD,"Brock Lesnar debuted on our TV screens on March 22nd 2002 in which he interrupted a match and destroyed Al Snow, Spike Dudley and Maven. The man was accompanied by Paul Heyman and I think all wrestling fans around the world, when watching that moment all thought ""What The F**k?"" After a few weeks and a few more match interruptions, we came to learn his name and the title that Heyman gave him of The Next Big Thing. The title was one of the only true titles that have ever been given to a wrestler, much like The Most Electrifying Man in sports entertainment for The Rock. Within the space of only two years, Brock became one of the biggest names in professional wrestling and won some of the most prestigious titles and matches in their history. He was the 2002 King of the Ring, he won the WWE Undisputed Title at Summerslam 2002 and won the 2003 Royal Rumble.

This DVD chronicles the most influential moment in Brocks very short WWE career and I'm sure will give any old school fan a pleasant nostalgic look at what once was. He was the true unstoppable force and this DVD shows how he went from NCAA champion to one of the fastest rising stars in WWE history.

Match List:

1. Vs Hulk Hogan 08/08/2002 This wasn't an overly great wrestling match but it set in stone the sheer indestructibility of Brock as he completely brutalised Hogan.

2. Vs The Rock Summerslam '02 The rising star vs. the biggest star in sports entertainment. A very exciting back and forth match which really had me surprised at the reaction of the crowd.

3. Vs Undertaker Hell In A Cell No Mercy '02 Easily one of the best ever hell in a cell matches which had both superstars brutalise each other to the point of no return.

4. Vs Kurt Angle Wrestlemania XIX Easily one of the best Wrestlemania Main Events in its history. It was back and forth, genuine wrestling action with a lot of mat work. Oh and the infamous Lesnar Shooting Star Press.

5. Vs Big Show Stretcher Match Judgement Day '03 Brock will always be known as the guy that challenged Big Show on a physical level. Rather than Show being the one to throw Brock around, a lot of the time in their matches it was the other way around. This also had a really cool ending.

6. Vs Big Show Smackdown 06/12/2003 Easily one of the best matches to ever take place on a Smackdown program. Again it's a match challenging for Big Show as in order to keep up with Brock he needs to work harder than he ever has. This also has the famous ring collapse at the end which is something to be experienced and a genuine surprise for any viewer.

If you're a fan of WWE and their history, then this is a DVD that showcases the best in their modern history. The only bad thing is the lack of special features, some along the lines of his OVW matches or special commentaries etc. would have made this DVD that much more special.",1219536000,,2850,4.3724007561436675
