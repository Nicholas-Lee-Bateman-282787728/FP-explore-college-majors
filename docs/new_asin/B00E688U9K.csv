5891991,3,B00E688U9K,"There's not a lot to say other than this ova seemed to been made purely for fan service. Story was nonexistent but that's not what this ova was aimimg for. It's 15 minutes of all the girls, except Alice, running around in skimpy swimsuits. However, I only bought it because it was $6 so it's not bad. The only extras on this blu ray are anime previews and disc credit. Not a lot in the extras department but I only paid $6 for it and received it months in advance so it's all good.",1377734400,,481,4.127659574468085
5891992,2,B00E688U9K,"While our favorite band of survivors from the series does make an appearance in the OVA (they don on swimsuits too and scour a somewhat marooned island) the storyline here has little relevance to the Highschool of the Dead main story. I'm not going to give any details out, but you can expect a heaping helping of ecchi, though there isn't really any ""full"" nudity (and thus no censors).

Personally (and I repeat, PERSONALLY) I found the OVA to be tedious and a little boring compared to the main story frame. Basically ridiculous actions lead to ridiculous delusions which in turn lead to ridiculous ecchi scenes. Again, no connection to the brain bashing, zombie milling storyline in the prior 12 episodes.

I'd say, take a miss with this. Nine bucks just isn't worth it. Not sure why the OVA would be sold by itself, let alone who is going to pick it up by itself.... Unless the cover art appeals to you as a collectors item (as of current Amazon.com doesn't display, but I caught it in a Tokyopop news mail). If you're going to purchase any HOTD Dvd/bluray at all, I recommend buying the series as a whole.",1376352000,30,1111,4.577889447236181
5891993,2,B00E688U9K,"While I thoroughly enjoyed High School of the Dead, and highly recommend it on Blu Ray if you are into fan service heavy, zombie, action anime, this tiny episode should have been included as a bonus feature on that set and not as its own full release.  16 minutes?  Really?

I've seen the episode they are putting on there.  While it is a fun, enjoyable episode, I really can't recommend paying $9 for it.  Your choice though, just be aware of what you are getting.",1375488000,172,465,4.423529411764706
5891994,4,B00E688U9K,"The group finds themselves on a tropical island, seemingly free from the outbreak.  AS the gang enjoys some time that does not involve killing zombies or fighting to survive, it is when they set a fire of some leaves that things get ""interesting"". Can they snap out of it before something bad happens?

This story does not really have a place between the first and soon to be coming second season, but it is a good escape from the horror that they have had to endure so far.  A good hold over until they bring the new season over and we learn the fates of this group and the world they reside in.",1375315200,33,596,4.256637168141593

5892017,5,B00E688U9K,i know alot of you think it isn't worth paying any money at all for a 17 min special with nothing else on the disc but buying this new through amazon will help support the show and prove there is merit for a season 2. the way anime's get renewed is through merchandise and dvd sales.

5892018,3,B00E688U9K,"Let me start by saying that I LOVE High School of the Dead. Love it, love it, love it. Its fun, interesting, wacky at times, and good old fashioned zombie fun.

With all that said HOTD: Drifters feels more like a money grab than anything else. Yes, it does feature the same characters, and yes, there are still nasty things trying to eat everyone, but the plot was lacking. I'm not going to go into what happened, but I really felt that this short, one episode film was more about having a plethora of typical anime genital shots than an actual story. I missed the story. I realize it's only one episode, but they should have tried harder to have a somewhat decent beginning, middle, and end.

I am still really looking forward to the next HOTD.",1473206400,2,745,4.430656934306569

Oh, and by-the-way, yes, I did check the fan rating first. I just wish ANN would allow user reviews so I could have read those first!

5892085,3,B00E688U9K,"This is a review for the single episode of HSOTD, I hope you enjoy!

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers) if you never seen the show High School of The Dead where this single episode is a mini continue-ation of the show, here is a small recap of what happened. Typicial zombie show, kids in high school and one day a massive zombie apocalypse. This episodes follows the same people from the main show, we have Takashi Komuro the main male character of the group, Rei Miyamoto Takashi's ex lover and spear user of the group, Saeko Busujima the sword kendo fighter of the group, Saya Takagi the ummmmmm complainer of the group? all she really does during the whole series is complain about everything, Kohta Hirano the gun loving sharp shooting nut of the group, Shizuka Marikawa the bimbo nurse yeah she really plays the dumb part really well, and last we have Alice Maresato the 7 year old who joined the group after getting rescued, not much fighting happens with Alice.  So this episode is an OVA, so the group goes on a boat to escape the zombie but they end up on an island but what happens? you got to watch to find out!

Pros: Continues the story of the main story line but only 1 episode long.

Cons: This episode is shorter than normal ones in the series, even on the back of the box its says 15 minutes long, now take 15 minutes and cut out 4 minutes for the intro and ending credits, so you are left with 11 minutes of show. Today is 5-22-2015 or 22-5-2015 (US and EU date system) so the blue ray cost $4.99,  so devide the time 11 minutes by the price of 4.99 = you are paying for $2.20 per minuet of show OR take $4.99 devide by 11 minutes and you pay  $0.45 minutes an episode. Same for the non blue ray dvd price of $3.99 devide by 11 minutes and you get $0.36 a minute or 11 minutes devide by $3.99 you get $2.75 a minute.  From my own oppion its not worth it, its just a fan service episode, boobs butt and bikini's, thats it! no action or anything.

Over all: I would only buy the main series not this OVA, sorry in my oppion its just NOT worth it at all!",1432252800,,2073,4.217171717171717

I bought before buying the series or episodes of HSOTD Basically bought the ova first just to try out Highschool of the Dead before buying the series to know what I'm getting my self into

Anime is about school students survive in a zombies apocalypse there more to that but the ova dosen't explain much it's very short the characters are stuck in the little island in trying to survive in the island and then things just gets weird o. O

Why I rate 4 stars I wanted to give the ova four half star the animation and details was fantastic ova was short I wish there were like more In the ova like mini short episode that 30 min at less you get much in the extras all what really matter I try it out but I'm going any feather with HSOTD feel free if you want to try out Highschool of the Dead ova

Despite these praises, I can only recommend this to fans of the first season of HOTD. Please don't buy this Blu-ray until after you've watched the first season. This is a great addition to any anime collection, especially if you own the first season of HOTD.

SPOILER ALERT!
This OVA ended with ""To Be Continued."" Will we finally see a second season of HOTD?? Only time will tell...
Please show your support!

Thanks for reading!",1391731200,,862,4.72

5892241,3,B00E688U9K,"I had high expectations for this based on my previous experience with HotD the first season. It is okay, but left a bit f disappointment in its wake. My overall impression of it: It seems to be a short trip on acid when you come to the finish and look back to the experience.",1391385600,,275,4.111111111111111

5892243,3,B00E688U9K,"So, no action to speak of, the plot is only moved in exposition early on in the episode, and the story of the episode is kind of ridiculous. It is also very short, basically just an episode length, ends on another cliffhanger of sorts, and probably will turn out to not even be canon once season 2 begins. There are no special features, and the ad for the anime network was annoying.

On the posistive side, They said that there will be a season two at the end of the episode, I learn what the term ecchi means, and it was neat seeing the characters again.

While it was worth the $5 I spent on it, if you are not a fan of the show, you might want to pass on this. If you are looking at getting into the show, pick up the season 1 boxset before watching this.",1390780800,,759,4.053333333333334

5892245,3,B00E688U9K,"Basically, it was a fan service commercial. Kinda had to do with the series, but mostly a boobacious pimping of season two. I guess that's ok, but as a fan of the series, I was hoping for more.",1390262400,,193,4.105263157894737
5892246,3,B00E688U9K,"After watching H.O.T.D, I thought this would be a side story to the series.

I thought there would be more then one episode but there isn't.

The crew finds themselves on a small island.  How and when they got there isn't really explained or ties in with the first series.  I am only on the 5th volume of the Manga and it isn't there either.  I am told a break comes up later on.

As I mention break; this is basically what goes on for the story.  It's a break from the running, fighting and hiding.  We get to see the girls in as little as possible for the traditional beach scene.

There is also a situation with hallucinations that follow a sexual nature so this is NOT kid friendly.

Overall I am mixed on this one.  I would like to see more but will probably wait to see if there is a series set.  As to following the first series; this is not needed as it doesn't really follow or add to it.  It's more of a diversion.

I am not sure it's worth the amazon price as all you get is the one episode and there isn't anything else with the blue ray.

5892268,4,B00E688U9K,"Taking place after the TV series ended, Takashi and his friends decide to escape from the zombie-infested mainland by traveling by boat to a small island to relax and unwind. After arriving they all change into swimware (the teenage girls and school nurse Shizuka all dress in teeny weeny bikinis) and enjoy some R&R in the sun. Later that night, they cook some fish, but the leaves they use to burn them turn out to be hydrangea leaves, which causes everyone to have hallucinations...

First, the good: Sentai has brought back all the English voice actors from the TV series to repraise their roles, and they all do great work as before. There's plenty of fanservice and humor, especially after the hallucinations set in. I definetly had a good time watching this.

Now, the bad: while the TV series followed the manga almost flawlessly, (or the first four volumes, at least) taking almost no liberties at all, this is a story that wasn't in the manga but was an original story made specifically for the anime. There's no human-vs-zombie action here, the emphesis is on light comedy and fanservice.

The biggest problem is the lack of content: the whole DVD has just one 15 minute episode, and NO extras. To me this is unforgivable. Back when Sentai Filmworks was still ADV, there were a couple of times when they'd release a DVD that had just one half-hour-or-less long OVA. (Some examples that come immediately to mind are GRRL POWER and SLAYERS PREMIUM) To make up for this they included behind-the-scenes interviews with the voice actors and voice actor commentary for both. Well, guess what? There's none of that here. It's just the show which ends all too quickly, which seems like a real waste of a DVD. They should've either loaded it with extras for the sake of having more content, or they should've included this episode in the TV series, perhaps had it at the end of the second disk after the last TV episode.

To summerize: it's lots of fun, yet it feels like there's not nearly enough here. Also at the end of the episode something happens that makes you seriously wonder about the fate of one of the characters, and we never get a direct answer.",1386115200,,2161,4.678947368421053
5892269,4,B00E688U9K,Was a single Episode which is not what i thought but that is my fault for not doing my research properly overall this OVA was alright more or less it is geared more for all the Fan Boys out there for HOTD has no real plot or any relation to the ending of the anime series if your looking for 18min of ass and Tig ol Biddie shots then this dvd is for you!,1386028800,,354,3.7972972972972974

5892276,3,B00E688U9K,"After the series of High school of the Dead (HOTD) many people wanted to see a second season. At this time there is no second season, so this is all we get. This OVA episode takes place after the 12 episode series, but takes place on a beach. What could possibly happen on a beach? If you have seen the series then you would not be surprised with what would happen in this episode.

Most importantly, one should note that this feature is only about 15 minutes long, excluding the songs. It is sort of a rip-off purchase if you are expecting a lot more from this single episode. This episode should have been released with the series, not as a stand alone. In fact, I would not be surprised if Sentai Filmworks releases the entire series again with this episode included with it. That would have been the smart decision in the first place.

What is this episode like? Well, if I told you, that would defeat the entire purpose of even watching this episode since it is so short. If you wanted to see more sexual situations and lesbian scenes in the series, then you definitely would want to watch this release.

For a show that is supposed to be about zombies attacking innocent people, this show has a lot of fan service scenes. This episode is obviously no different; in fact, the zombies are almost entirely absent from this release.

Overall, this release is for hardcore fans of the show who want to see more. The disc does not seems to have any particular special features of note either.",1380931200,,1492,4.474264705882353
