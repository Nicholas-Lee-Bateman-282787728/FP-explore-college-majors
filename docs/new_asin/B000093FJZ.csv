1877558,5,B000093FJZ,"I will give this DVD 5 stars even if the editing could have been better. Even so, Joaquin Cortes and his musical companions are a wonder to behold and listen to. The Flamenco vocals are first rate, the music is bold and daring, fusing classical, jazz and Flamenco. Joaquin Cortes' style is also daring: he is a master of all the Flamenco forms and his interpretation is fresh and vibrant. He pushes his artistry to the limit. Voices, Music and Dance are in perfect syncronization and syncopation! I highly recommend this DVD. You will not be dissapointed! Arriba Joaquin & Co.!",1053993600,,577,4.7227722772277225
1877559,2,B000093FJZ,"I love the way Joaquin Cortez dances. He not only dances, he erupts with passion in every pass and move he makes. Joaquin, keep dancing like this and thou shalt be called the new Lord of the Dance. I would buy any disc or video featuring Joaquin just for his talent alone. He needs no music to express his ways. If to such a big talent you add an excellent group of flamenco musicians, also giving their best on each act, and an excellent audio mixing and recording, you should be getting a thrilling video to share with you dear ones. Right?
Wrong... I'm telling you why.
I thought I bought a video featuring Joaquin Cortes, but I actually bought a series of short-lenght scenes, from which I hardly could put together the evolution of Joaquin's work. The video editor, Mr Fernandez, made a good work of synchronizing the changing of the scenes with the changes in rithm, but that done with flamenco renders an endless string of scenes, blended in an unrecognisable flow, each scene lasting less than 5 seconds. I understand that during the performance, some scenes of the musicians, the crew, and the cuorum have to be inserted so we are given a broader view of the atmosphere created by the artists. This should be done in a proportion of 75% for the main artist and 25% for the rest. However, in this case, we are fed images in the reverse proportion - 25% Joaquin, 75% of the rest. [...] Unfortunately, the 25% of Joaquin's images, are also an erratic scan of his dancing. While he is performing a series of spins and evolutions, the cameramen are giving us an extreme close-up of his face, his hands, even his [...], and not of his feet, which are the main dish in this banquet. And when we are given a (very short) full take of him, the lower section of the screen does not shows his feet, or they are blocked by the head of the first row attendants. Very frustrating.
Joaquin outshines other dancing performances like the shows featured by Michael Flatley, or the stiff dancers of Riverdance. Even other sound-focused shows as Stomp!, but with such a poor quality of edition, his talent is greatly diminished. [...] BR>This is my lowest-value DVD purchase of my whole collection. BR>Cheers!",1052611200,8,2198,4.60969387755102
1877604,5,B000093FJZ,"Not even this evil editor was able to hide Joaquin's genius. Even though you can NEVER really see his work, you can guess it despite the outrageous cuts that compromise the entire DVD. You would really want to see Joaquin's choreography and movements, but NO, you are forced to look at microphones, beards, wires, cavities and whatever else was in the editor's mind. What was he thinking? It's real torture. And yet, Joaquin is right there, and worth every second he is on the screen. Buy this DVD, no matter what. Just pray that Joaquin won't hire the same editor next time.",1206057600,,575,4.647058823529412
1877605,5,B000093FJZ,"This DVD is a fascinating example of the art of flamenco dancing. Joaquin Cortes is brilliant, and in my opinion, the best flamenco dancer in the world. He is so passionate about what he does, and that radiates in each and every performance. A must see!",1185580800,,253,4.521739130434782
1877606,5,B000093FJZ,What else can be said of Juaquin Cortez that has not been sed. If you want to know why he's so famous. Whatch this DVD.,1178928000,,119,3.8
1877607,5,B000093FJZ,"In this historical document dated from 2001, Joaquin Corts displays all his unbeatable art in this difficult genre, product of many crossed rhythms and musical influences, giving a successful hybrid that works out with sublime grace; he exhibits grace, charisma, frame of mind. And he also prepares the necessary choreography and ensemble process with his string sections, bass, female singers, percussionists, guitars, Peru an box, drums and cata (an African instrument) built a solid and extraordinarily convincing spectacle that engaged not only the successful audience that literally stowed the Royal Albert hall, but besides, all the viewers who enjoyed this outstanding spectacle.

My only complaint has nothing to do with Cortes, but the terrific process of edition and filming; the camera literally forbade us to enjoy highlights moments focusing faces and dismissing Cortez heel wonders. What a pity!",1117929600,,909,5.586956521739131
1877608,5,B000093FJZ,"this DVD is a well-produced overview of a fantastic performance of a tremendous flamenco ensemble !!! all the performances blend into one power-full flow of Flamenco ""Duende"" !!! maestro Cortes' dancing definately benefits from an incredible group of musicians & is the best high energy male flamenco dancing you could ever wish to see on a big stage [although Flamenco, for my tastes,is best experienced in small Juergas as opposed to the concert stage]... what impresses me most is the cohesive energy of the entire group more than Cortes' individual dancing & that's what the producer of the film focused on when filming... i can see where Flamenco dancers would be deeply disappointed by the production's constant variety of views BUT the overall effect of the video is one of the best modern Flamenco stage performances i have ever seen captured for viewers to deeply experience anytime they are in the mood to be blown away by a ""locomotive-like"" flamenco troupe... definitely an incredible experience thru a good sound/video system but not a great dance instruction video... perhaps next time, Cortes will take such constructive criticism to heart & spend more time having the camera focusing on his dance routines on film & less on the other aspects of the show... still, this is a ""must have"" to any gypsy lovers' DVD collection... FANTASTICO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1099094400,9,1373,5.1066666666666665
1877609,1,B000093FJZ,"This dvd makes it impossible to watch the work of a great, magnificent dancer. You barely get to see him dance.  There is no image on the screen for more than a few seconds, mostly less - so that you have a headache within 10 minutes of trying to watch.  The film-maker needs to go back to film-maker kindergarten!  What a shame.",1096675200,3,329,4.274193548387097
1877610,5,B000093FJZ,"Bling, Bling, Bling!!!
  Joaquin Gets Busy! all you Flamenco Purist out there, put this in your pipe and take a deeeeep inhale. Joaquin shows the
beauty and diversity of Flamenco, as he demonstrates the quality
of his dancing. The beauty of the voices, the beauty of the music
and the dancing is a credit to the beautiful art form called Flamenco! As far as the editing is concerned, I thought it was
appropriate and didn't take away from the performance. Joaquin shows that Flamenco can extend itself and not lose its form. He
keeps the root of Flamenco intact and allows beautiful flowers to bloom on its branches. Flamenco fundamentalist may cringe while watching this performance, but those with open and creative minds will love it. This is a dvd that Flamenco fans
and dance enthusiast will treasure and enjoy.
Peace, Jamahl.",1089763200,,831,4.845070422535211
1877611,2,B000093FJZ,"Joaquin Cortes is one of the most brilliant, charismatic and influential flamenco dancers of our time.  His energy is powerful, mesmerizing, unparalel.  After watching the first 10 minutes of the show, i felt a growing knot in my stomach stemming from incredible disappointment.  It's very difficult to spoil something as powerful as Joaquin Cortes to an admirer, and yet, it has been achieved in this version of his breathtaking performance.
I've read all the reviews of this DVD on amazon, and yet, i thought it was worth purchasing it, because my admiration and fascination with this performer is so great.  His performance is undermined through the editing not worthy of Cortes' caliber.  You really don't see much of his dancing, and you can't appreciate his form to the full extent.  It is my understanding that the camera should focus on the performer, instead of going from the strumming of guitar, to the cantaor and his microphone, to the red and yellow lights, back to the strumming of guitar, the overview of the stage and the close up of Joaquin's face all the time while Joaquin is dancing!!!!  You would think that since the intention of this show was to have a solo performance, the focus would be on its only dancer.  Not quite, not quite.
To make the long story short, if you're a devoted flamenco fan as myself, you'll buy this anyway, no matter what anyone tells you, because you just have to have it.  If you're a nutcase like me, prepare to be greatly disappointed.",1089244800,15,1487,4.754863813229572
1877612,3,B000093FJZ,"This DVD was unfortunately a bit of a disappointment. Don't get me wrong, Joaquin's dancing is superb and his musicians and singers are wonderful.
This show was heavily edited...way too much. The shots are wizzing around so fast, it is enough to make you dizzy.
 If all you are after is a taste of Flamenco, then you will enjoy this. Unfortunately, Flamenco dancers, like myself, will be disappointed. Just when the dancing becomes intense, they will cut to a singer. Or when very technical footwork is being done, all you will see is a closeup of Joaquin's face. You never really get to see the complete step combinations.
 Though, I do miss the fabulous energy of the female members of his company, it is a very good ""one man show"", which has just been subjected to too much editing.",1069804800,12,785,4.640287769784172
1877613,5,B000093FJZ,"I totally agree with the gentleman about the editing of the dance of this film.  I have been looking and looking for a Region 1 VHS or DVD of Joaquin (after seeing him on Ovation and for a brief number in ""Flamenco"".  I want to see the whole sequence of a step, not one hand, two hands and especially with the grace and balance of Joaquin- To me, he should have been THE SHOW. I think that I shall have to go to Spain to see him in a small venue(and I am a 70 year old gal)!  Love the Flamenco and he has certainly done a lot to bring the dance forward again.  And I also agree that Michael F. could not last as long in the routines that require so much energy.  Bravo to Joaquin and his group but Boo to the editing.",1059004800,,717,3.9172413793103447

7988891,5,B000093FJZ,"I am drooling every time I watch this.  He has such energy and expertise.  Every click of the heels and feet are right on beat.  He has the fastest feet ever.  If you are a flamenco dancer, you will appreciate how really great Joaquin Cortes is.  If you are not a dancer you can just sit there and drool as I do with all my friends.  You will enjoy this video over and over and over and over.  Highly recommended for dancers and would be dancers.",1375747200,,446,4.116279069767442
7988892,2,B000093FJZ,"My review has more to do with the filming and editing rather than the content of the show. I'm pretty sure that the show would be amazing if I was there live. The video bounces around with all of these ""artistic shots"". The shots of him dancing bounce from feet only to cantor (singer) to his full body to musician to his feet to his face to his feet to cantor...etc. You get the idea. The itself is great from what I can tell. The direction and editing of the video is seriously flawed. Please, save your money. Wish I did.",1372896000,,524,4.198019801980198

7988895,2,B000093FJZ,"If you ""see"" this DVD with closed eyes you could feel the sublime beauty of Flamenco music, but when you open your eyes you could only feel dizzy :S. The editing is by far the worst I've ever seen, is like see the video of your daughter's sweet 16, but filmed by your drunken cousin Joe.
Don't waste your money, unless you like headaches.",1273795200,,338,4.296875
7988896,1,B000093FJZ,"Joaquin Cortes is a super star in the world of flamenco.  It's because he is such a good dancer that this video is so bad. As other reviewers have pointed out, the fault is amateurish editing.

Joaquin's dances are presented the same way regardless of the song or choreography. We are assaulted with a series of quick cuts of Cortes' isolated body parts- an outstretched hand, stamping feet, a disembodied head, and so on.  We don't get a chance to see him dance for more than a second without another irritating cut.

There are some shots of Joaquin's entire body, but they are from a distance or using artificially arty angles, and the images only appear briefly. You never have a chance to relax, sit back and enjoy his dancing. It's like watching a TV promo for a Cortes appearance at your local civic center, but instead of 30 seconds, it goes on and on and on.  The result is maddening.

As an artist, Cortes deserves better. So do we as fans.

Anyone interested in masterful flamenco shot by a director who can capture a dancer on film should watch Carlos Saura's early films with Antonio Gades, or his later work with Joaquin Cortes and other contemporary dancers of flamenco.",1270684800,7,1184,4.609523809523809
7988897,1,B000093FJZ,"The editing of this dvd is terrble, with multiple camera shots of every dance move spliced together, making it a headache and very unpleasant to watch.  What happened to the dance filming in the days of Fred Astaire, when dances were shot full screen.  The editing ruined what would otherwise have been a very good dance dvd.",1261267200,3,325,4.684210526315789
7988898,5,B000093FJZ,"Fabulous dancing and performance by all.  I hated the camera work with too many closeups and not enough full body shots to fully appreciate the incredible grace and style of this master dancer.  We all look forward to more recorded performances from you, Joaquin.",1220140800,,263,4.954545454545454
