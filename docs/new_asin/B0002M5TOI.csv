2103767,3,B0002M5TOI,"Why Manos was included in an ""essential"" package is a mystery.  They must've had some sitting in the warehouse.  This is the worst movie of all time, so bad that the guys couldn't even begin to make fun of it.  There are too many times in this movie when they  have nothing to say because there's nothing happening in the movie.  If Rhino was going to re-release a movie and call it ""essential,"" they should've gone with ""Pod People"" or ""Cave Dwellers.""

As for ""Santa Clause versus the Martians,"" (a movie most noted for having a young Pia Zedora) it's good but not great.  There are definitely some great jokes and moments, as the other reviewers note, but again, not the best.

Sadly, the best movies are the Roger Korman/Sandy Frank movies, which may never be released.  How these guys could think their movies are better when viewed without MST commentary is beyond me.  The MST version of ""Earth versus the Spider"" is brilliant and notable for Crow's ripoff, ""Earth versus Soup.""  Likewise, ""Time of the Apes"" is a classic (a terrible Japanese ripoff of Planet of the Apes which includes the Sandy Frank song which apparently angered him so much that he won't allow any of his movies to be released by Rhino).  Also, Daddio and Marooned are classics which should be considered ""essential"" for the next release.",1093824000,6,1316,4.698689956331878
2103768,4,B0002M5TOI,"Yes, ""Manos"" has already been released on DVD.  And if you already own that celluloid disaster, you have to decide whether ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" is worth the duplication.

Stop right there: It is.

The third season of Mystery Science Theater 3000 was one of the program's best.  But it's one of the least represented on Rhino's video and DVD releases.  The crew spent most of 1991 watching the films of Sandy Frank and Roger Corman, and both men were enraged by the show's treatment of their movies.  When the rights to the films expired in the mid-90s, Frank, reportedly angered by the ""Sandy Frank"" song in one episode, refused to renew them, and a large swath of MST3K disappeared from sight.  Only three third season movies are still in circulation: The classics ""Cave Dwellers"" and ""Pod People,"" and the solid ""The Unearthly"" from later in the season.  (""Attack of the Colossal Beast"" was briefly on video in 1996, but withdrawn because of rights issues.)

That means that many of MST's best moments have been unavailable, and what a joy it is to have ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" back.  This high energy travesty, made in 1964, is a bizarre mash of holiday cheer and science fiction, as poorly-costumed aliens kidnap St. Nicholas to bring cheer to Martian children.  The premise is strange, the sets are cheap, and the actors bluster like a sandstorm on the red planet.  It's a camp classic.

The MST3K treatment is terrific.  Joel, Tom and Crow all come through, with brilliant commentary (""Santa Claus: Killed in Vietnam"") and the memorable ""A Patrick Swayze Christmas.""  Any Christmas song with a threat to ""break your kneecaps if you . . . . touch my car"" deserves a spot in the canon.

There's not much more to say about ""Manos,"" save that it proves there are far, far worse things than an Ed Wood production.  ""Manos"" may not be the worst film ever done by Mystery Science Theater 3000 -- the incomprehensible ""Monster A-Go-Go,"" not released on video, is almost unwatchable -- but it certainly belongs in that discussion.  ""Hired! Part 2"", the short preceding it, is achingly funny, a wonderful send-up of a 1940 Chevrolet training film.  The opening scenes with the grandfather on the porch (""Ah!  Flying elves are back!"") rank with the show's best moments.

If you already own ""Manos,"" buy this set.  You'll get a third-season classic, and you can put your extra ""Manos"" up for auction somewhere.  MST fans will enjoy a bounty this fall: a collection due in October will give us the great ""Mr. B Natural"" short.  Enjoy it all.",1092614400,16,2561,4.7681818181818185
2103769,5,B0002M5TOI,"I am very excited about this release although I do have manos hands of fate already.  santa clause conquers the martians is said to be one of the best episodes and I have always wanted to see it.  also for those big fans out there if you don't mind paying full price and five dollars shipping you can get a bonus disc of shorts volume 3.  go to the mst3k info web site for full information.  but if want the discs cheap buy em here then hope they will release shorts volume three for seperate purchase.
also they have just announced a new four disc set with 3 commedy channel episodes and a new collection of shorts.  cant wait!
update august 26:  i just got mine early from the website so that was cool.  however the packaging leaves something to be desired.  it is just a plain dvd case with the two discs held on both sides of the case.  unfortunately that means the chapter guide is just a piece of paper with nothing holding it.  also the bonus disc is just sitting in there as well in a paper sleeve.  the should have made it like the four disc boxes with a larger description of the episode inside and a slit for the chapter guide.  also it would have been really cool if there was a whole extra slot for the bonus disc.  also im annoyed that it doesn't say the episode number or have a larger description of the episodes.  but still it gets five stars because of the strength of the episodes.  you must get this.",1091664000,13,1420,4.226765799256506
2103770,5,B0002M5TOI,"This is a two-disc set with Manos: The Hands of Fate and Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, two of the ALL-TIME funniest MST3K episodes. The Manos disc also has the ""Poopie"" 30-minute bloopers reel, a great collection of outtakes from the first few seasons of the show.

 Manos: The Hands of Fate as a movie is an amazing curiosity it is so bad and so odd. A fertilizer salesman in Texas decided he wanted to write, direct and star in a scary movie and this is the result. It's scary alright! Wait till you see ""Torgo"" and the glorious inaction of this film. The staff at MST3K often named this film as the worst thing they ever had to watch while making the show. It is legendary among MST3K fans ('MSTies') because the movie is just so, so bad, but the jokes are so, so funny in spite of it. A real oddity and very funny stuff from the MST3K crew. There is also a short in this episode called, ""Hired"", an old corporate training film about teaching men to sell cars door-to-door; an interesting bit of history and very funny when Joel and the 'Bots get done with it.

 Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is a grade-Z kids movie from the 1960's and it has just about the absolute goofiest costumes, acting and music of any film ever. The much less than great Pia Zadora is one of the kids in the film. However, the MST3K crew really wrote some of their best material making fun of this one. Wait till you hear Crow's Christmas Carol, ""A Patrick Swayze Christmas."" This is must-see comedy for anyone who likes a good laugh.

 Calling this set ""Essentials"" is not a misnomer, these are truly some terrific episodes of the funniest television show ever. Movie Sign!",1091404800,18,1662,4.4506578947368425

2103773,5,B0002M5TOI,"It's about time that there was a release of one of the classic MST3K holiday experiments, just in time for the season.  'Manos' is the definitive example of an MST experiment - goofy, meandering movie with cutting riffs.  The 'Poopie' outtake collection is a longer-than-normal selection of bloopers and alternate takes - a must have for any MSTie.
But the real treat of this dual set is ""Santa Claus Conquers The Martians"".  If you're tired of normal holiday fare such as ""Home Alone"", ""A Christmas Story"", and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" place this disk in the player and watch your kids' squeal with delight.  ""Santa Claus"" is a bizarre tale about pathos and depression - among Martians!  It seems the only way to cure the holiday blues on Mars is to stage a spectacular kidnapping of the Earthling Santa Claus.  Four children (two from Earth and two from Mars) join forces with Dropo, a renegade Martian to rescue Santa, save Christmas on Earth, and bring holiday joy to the Children of Mars.  The plot makes sense with the electric performance of a young Miss Pia Zadora.  Ok, well maybe not.
Sounds interesting, yes?  No?  Well, it's a truly awful film, a definite jaw-dropping example of bad cinema.  Fortunately, the MST3K treatment is hilarious.  Joel and the 'Bots even give us the classic Christmas standard, ""A Patrick Swayze Christmas"".
I'm chucking my ""Charlie Brown Christmas"" and ""Rudolph's Shiny New Year"" in favor of this twisted classic.

I reasoned that since this movie shows up in virtually every public-domain horror collection that you can buy, there must be SOMETHING worth seeing. Yes, you can watch it for laughs. For me the funniest thing is the dubbed-in voice of the little girl--sounds like a man speaking in falsetto into his hand. I also got a kick out of the musical score--my son was composing infinitely better music when he was in high school.

2103805,5,B0002M5TOI,"This seems to happen occasionally in the review sections on Amazon: The reviews don't exactly match the product on that page. So, just in case...unless you're on the page that indicates MST3K, the version of ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"" is only the original movie, sans the bots and Mike or Joel.

Nevertheless, I highly recommend either. The MST3K folks do a great job of riffing, but the film is hilarious on its own. Like ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", it is so bad that it's really a hoot. You can find more trivia and info at IMDB, so I'll just say that the acting is awful(the director apparently was too busy working on his on-screen performance), the dubbing is even worse(sometimes not even using the actual actors), the dialogue is for those with short term memory issues(a bunch of lines are repeated immediately after they are first presented), and the music...well, it's really kind of appropriate(check out the soundtrack when Torgo is getting the luggage from the car).

This will either leave you wanting to take a shower...or wanting more. And if it's the latter, apparently ""Manos: The Rise of Torgo"" is in post-production as I write this(November 2014), 48 years after the original and starring Jackie Neyman, who played the little girl ""Debbie"" in the original, now playing Manos.

2103839,3,B0002M5TOI,"When I think of ""The Essentials"" regarding any TV show, I think of the best episodes, the ones I just couldn't possibly do without.  Or possibly the most famous episodes.  Or perhaps the very best episodes for a newcomer to the show to see.

In that respect, this 2 disc set probably more closely fits the definition of ""most famous"" episodes more than anything else, if only for MANOS alone.

Anyway, here's the breakdown by episode, with my opinions on how ""essential"" each of them are:

MANOS, THE HANDS OF FATE:  Perhaps the most famous MST3k episode of all time, the show helped catapult MANOS up (or down, depending how you look at these things) to the level of ""Worst Movie Of All Time"" causing a split for the title between MANOS and Ed Wood's PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE that continues to be debated to this day.

Its truly a terrible film.  One of the very worst, though I think the worst movie I'VE personally ever seen was the just as dull and incomprehensible MONSTER A GO-GO (say what you will about MANOS, it at least has an ENDING).

MANOS, though, is truly bad.  Its grainy, washed out, horrible dubbed (they didn't bother recording SOUND when they made it so the same 3 people do every voice), cuts every 30 seconds or less, and is clearly the work of a crew who had no idea what they're doing.  Its a complete trainwreck of the film and you can tell Joel and the Bots could barely comprehend what they were viewing.

And that's basically my problem with it.  The movie is so bad that half the time the guys are silent because they just have nothing to say about the dismal, baffling failure taking place on the screen in front of them.  So while its truly one of the worst movies to be on MST3k, I find the episode as a whole lacking in comedic value because they just don't have much to say about whats going on.  It makes for a dull experience overall.  Its not the worst episode I've seen, not by a long shot, but I never really understood why people think that just because the movie is SO bad that Joel and the Bots are left speechless that its the best episode ever.  That said, the ""Hiring, Pt2"" short preceding the flick is pretty darn great.

I do think, however, that any Mistie around should see it at least once and judge for themselves, but I always found the hype around this one unwarranted.  Sure the movie is god-awful, but that doesn't automatically make for a funny episode.

SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS:  This one is another fan favorite, and until I bought this episode I hadn't seen it.  To me its average.  The movie is certainly insane enough (I mean, look at the title), but again the riffing just doesn't seem to be exceptionally funny.  The guys just seemed kinda lazy in the theater on this one.  It has its moments, but again, its just average to me.

Overall, I didn't find these two episodes to be truly ""essential"" in any way other than the movies featured are fairly unique for one reason or another.  The riffing and the overall quality of the episodes is average.  Not bad, again, but not truly exceptional they way some episodes of MST3k are.  That said, not only are these nowhere close to being my favorite episodes, these two are episodes I would NEVER show anyone new to the show.  I know some longtime fans who STILL have a hard time making it through MANOS in one sitting.  These are painful painful movies.

If I were making the collection of ESSENTIAL MST3k episodes, my two picks would be THE FINAL SACRIFICE (the single funniest episode I've seen, bar none) and RED ZONE CUBA (which is probably as objectively bad and incomprehensible as MANOS, but overall much easier to watch and a heck of a lot funnier).

To be fair, the ESSENTIALS should probably be Joel episodesas Joel did invent the show, and in that case, I point newcomers and long time fans alike to EEGAH! and THE GIRL IN LOVER'S LANE.  So far I haven't found any funnier episodes featuring Joel than those two, they're two of my very favorites and also fairly accessible to those not familiar with the show.

The final word:  I'm glad I own these two episodes, but they're not quite ""The Essentials"" in my mind.",1310774400,6,4141,4.467376830892144
2103840,4,B0002M5TOI,"This 2 Disc MST3K DVD set from Rhino has one of the most enjoyable episodes(Santa Claus Conquers the Martians) as well as one of the most infamous episodes(Manos The Hands of Fate).

Santa Claus Conquers the Martians(1964): This campy Christmas film suffers from cheesy sets, cheesy humor, and hammy acting. Martians kidnap Santa Claus(John Call) and two Earth children to bring joy to Martian children. A renegade Martian plans on ruining Christmas! John Call was a good actor and he felt like a flesh and blood Santa Claus. The film's theme song is very catchy. I am sure TV stations used this film as filler. A young Pia Zadora plays a Martian girl.

Manos The Hands of Fate(1966): This is the same DVD that Rhino Home Video issued as a single disc. The only extras are a chapter menu and an outtake reel from MST3K. A traveling family accidentally gets lost and get stuck at a house run by a satanic, polygamous cult. Manos is a giant failure on an artistic and technical level!

2103855,4,B0002M5TOI,"Some bad movies are so bad they are funny; most bad movies, however, are simply bad, and in order to be funny they need a little help. Debuting on television in 1988 and running for eleven years, MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 did precisely that. The premise was wacky. An average Joe-type guy is trapped on a dog-bone-shaped wayward satelite by mad scientists who force him and his robot pals to watch and comment on bad movies. This MST3K ""ESSENTIALS"" collection includes several bonuses, but the emphasis is on movies, and on this occasion we are treated to two incredibly bad ones: MANOS, HANDS OF FATE and SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS.

Created in 1966 by Hal Warren, a fertilizer salesman who dabbled in community theatre, MANOS was highly anticipated in El Paso, where local dignitaries flocked to the premiere. The audience began to snicker when the film began to roll. Most of the cast and crew immediately fled the scene; by mid-point most of the audience was gone as well. Those who remained threw their shoes at the screen and at the end a little old lady attacked Warren with her purse. The story of a vacationing family that stumbles upon a devil worshiping cult, MANOS was filmed with cameras that couldn't sustain more than about thirty seconds per shot, which means you get one cut after another, with the shots not so much edited together as simply strung together.  The film was shot without sound and the entire script was dubbed afterward, and badly so, with lines out of synch and inappropriate voices and similar issues. This hardly matters because the script is wildly repetitive, unamusingly ridiculous, a complete insult to viewer intelligence at every possible turn.

Released in 1964, SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS is theoretically a holiday movie for children, but I can't imagine even the most uncritical child managing to sit through it.  Perhaps the most notable thing about this flick is the color balance, which is basically a migraine waiting to happen: everything tends toward red and the right side of the screen is generally more red than the left.  The sets, which were built in an abandoned airplane hanger, are ridiculously cheap.  The costumes wildly ill-advised, with the so-called Martians in olive drab tights with copper refrigerator tubing running out of their heads.  As if all this were not enough, the film was a vehicle for Pia Zadora's screen debut, and not only does she play the role of a Martian child, she also sings the unspeakable yet tiresomely catchy opening titles tune.  Given that she wasn't any better in 1964 than she would be in the 1980s, when her films included BUTTERFLY and LONELY LADY and she and her then-husband were famous for buying and demolishing Pickfair.

Seen as a stand-alone, MANOS is virtually unwatchable, but the MST3K gang really nail this one. The episode has more than its usual quota of skits, and Gypsy may well have the single best line uttered by any of the robot puppets in the entire series run. Joel, Tom Servo, and Crow light into MANOS with a vengence, venting forth every bit of sarcasm and ridicule at their disposal. As for SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS, it is actually one of those ""so bad its good"" movies that you can laugh at without any help, and in this instance the MST3K riffs are very much of their era.  Do you know what a Cricket lighter is?  If so, you'll likely hoot, but what really makes this MST3K episode stand out are the ""Christmas On The Satellite of Love"" segments, with Crow wearing a red nose and Tom Servo's head switched out with a snowglobe.  Recommended, with the SANTA CLAUS episode probably more enjoyable for established fans.

Episode 321 Santa Claus Conquers the Martians.  I have always enjoyed this one.  One BAD Christmas movie.  You watch the ""Invention Exchange"" to see how Dr Forrester (Trace) & TV's Frank (Frank) change the gifts by turning the boxes upside down.  It is funny, bad polar bear & robot costumes.  IF you get depressed at Christmas time watch this episode it will make you laugh.

Something that made watching Manos, the Hands of Fate even better was reading the IMDb trivia for the movie; here is a sample: The movie was given a gala premiere in El Paso upon its release, and many local dignitaries were on hand. Part way into the film, members of the audience began heckling it. Many of the film's cast and crew sneaked out of the theater before the film ended to avoid the embarrassment of having to admit being part of it. One of the best/worst parts of Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is the polar bear; it only appears briefly but Wow, that's bad!",1281225600,,703,4.449612403100775
2103860,5,B0002M5TOI,"Why yes, my brain IS burning. Anyone's brain would after watching two of the most horrendous movies in the world -- yes, even worse than Ed Wood's. ""The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Collection - The Essentials (Manos, the Hands of Fate / Santa Claus Conquers the Martians)"" is a two-part bundle of hilarity that will leave you thanking God for good directors.

On the Satellite of Love, Joel experiments with a module that causes all the bots to worship him -- and of course, once he removes it, they go right back to normal. Then comes the invention exchange, which is about as surreal as you'd expect, and then some.

Then the guys go into the theater for ""Manos, The Hands of Fate""... and yes, that comma SHOULD be a colon, but isn't. After being treated to a horrible short film about ""prospects,"" they are launched into the worst movie in the world: after a few hours of ""driving"" footage and some cop-related red herrings, a very boring all-American family arrives at a weird out-of-the-way house, occupied only by the knobby-kneed Torgo.

Amazingly, Torgo's creepy tics and constant babbling about ""the Master"" doesn't tip the family off that something weird might be going on in this place. And of course, eventually the bots begin to go insane from the sheer ineptitude of it all -- ""Hey look, there's a field! And another field! And another field!"" ""Oh yes, it's very scenic. It's just like a scene from... ""Manos, the Hands of Fate!"". Cue Tom's hysterical sobs.

Then: it's Christmastime on the Satellite of Love, and Joel and the bots are celebrating as best they can... only for Dr. Forrester to spoil it by sending up a terrifyingly awful, gruesomely sentimental movie called ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians""... which is a great title, but a baaaaaaad movie.

Basically it's about how the children on Mars have become depressed and materialistic, so the Martians go to Earth to kidnap Santa Claus. Not only do they abduct the creepily cheerful St. Nick, but two extremely wooden children called Billy and Betty. And you can probably see what's coming: Santa's influence causes all the Martians to become jolly and happy and all that. And there's some Martian who hates him, but he's so ineffectual that it's hard to notice him except for his walrus mustache.

I can see why these two episodes of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" were bundled together, because the movies they are snarking are THE WORST. They are just AWFUL -- ""Manos"" is abysmally cheap and poorly-made (giant kneecaps!) with the worst actors ever to wander in front of a camera, and ""Santa Claus"" is a grotesque mix of cheesy sentimentality, cheap sets/props/costumes, and kiddie sci-fi.

However, the snark aimed at these movies is SUBLIME. Joel and the bots have the right mix of craziness (""Oh, let's have a Patrick Swayze Christmas this year."" ""Or we'll tear your throat out and kick you in the ear!"") and weirdness (""Could you hold that one card up? What's it say? Oh, yeah - woof""). Watching these guys is fun enough to make up for the wretchedness of the movies -- where else can you hear a guy and two robots read their essay/rants about Christmas, involving Santa and the reindeer being exposed to vacuum?

I have long been in the Mike Nelson camp of Msties and still keep my feet firmly planted therein.  But finally watching Manos, The Hands of Fate made me change my opinion of Joel from ""boring, sleepy-eyed creator who should have never hosted"" to ""sorta funny, sleepy-eyed creator, who should only host after drinking a Red Bull"".

Manos is so poorly shot and the ""why not"" catfights so numerous that I was already laughing at the awkward pauses and confusing wardrobe even before the riffing began.  Almost every minute of dialogue is covered by constant riffs(which is just the way I like it) and the Torgo impressions are never a let down.  The Pizza Delivery scene with Mike as Torgo had me on the floor-good times!

Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is just a goofy movie and the riffing is sufficient, but I feel like a later Sci-Fi Channel Mike episode would have been more appropriate so as to provide ""The Essentials"" of of both eras of the show.

Time to stop attacking the wretched dross available on this site and embrace the very best things that makes The Curmudgeon NOT wish hot, burning death on everyone on the planet. In short - its a time of celebration. And hey - YOU'RE invited.

It was a total fluke that I happened to see this show.

Back when MST3K was on the air, the only place to see it was in America. This was back in the time when the net wasn't invented, we ate what we killed ourselves and people used to have sex with monkeys. Probably. Dark days, my friends.

So it was only on a ""vacation"", as you space age yanks say, to America that I discovered the wonder, the sheer unadulterated joy that is Mystery Science Theater 3000. A show that does two pretty amazing things; it effortlessly glides past its shoe-string budget, creating lovable, fun characters from hunks of plastic but it also makes watching the worst movies imaginable into 90 of the best minutes of your day.

As is the case with, say, The Simpsons and such, I'm not actually reviewing this DVD itself, more the overall show (although both these episodes are hilarious, even if Manos had appeared on an earlier boxset). So while the very, very first episodes were quite hard to sit through, with some poor jokes, dodgy voices and loooong gaps in between talking, MST3K hit a stride fairly early on in its run and the quality didn't let up right till the end.

For those who don't know what this show is (and trust me, 99% of the UK seems to have never heard of it - certainly anyone I ever met), its premise is fiendishly simple; an average Joe (or Joel, and in later seasons Mike) is blasted into space by mad scientists to watch terrible B-movies while they scan his brain. Joel creates some robots to watch the movies with him and keep him company, and they, as indeed, do we, proceed to sit and watch the entire film, with only their wisecracks to keep us from gouging out our eyes instead of watching the film.

It sounds like a show that would quickly run out of steam. How many gags can you get out of watching old movies? Well, its down to the genius writing and perfect delivery of Joel, Mike (I always preferred Mike, to be honest), Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot that kept the show fresh, funny, endlessly quotable and even at over 90 minutes at a time, often without a dragging moment.

Yes, some episodes were better than others, but that was often down to the choice of film than the choice of gags. There are some truly side-splitting episodes that demand repeat viewing, with constant inspired, surreal riffs that just seem to flow from the crew. It never feels scripted or pre-determined. Every gag sounds off the cuff. Never before have bad movies turned into solid GOLD television.

MST3K suffered more than most TV shows. In fact, it bore the brunt of most things that either make a show ""jump the shark"" or kill it completely. Different writers, different voice actors for the robots, different mad scientists, change of station, different lead star - you name it, the MST3K crew faced it, dealt with it and kept on coming up with the goods. In today's age of shows being cancelled half way through a series for no real reason (hello, Bionic Woman) its nothing less than a triumph.

Sadly, a lot of these episodes (the show ran for 10 years) will probably never see the official light of day due to copyright issues, so its more reason to cherish the episodes that have made it through.

For those that actually LOVE old, corny films (like the MST3K crew do), its a treat. For those that just love hearing the most hilarious running commentary on bad movies, it's an absolute blast. MST3K really did offer something new from something old. To watch it is to love it.

And that, good reader, is Part Three in my list of the great and the good. But what could possibly be up next? Only one way to find out..",1211068800,4,3910,4.485232067510548
2103889,5,B0002M5TOI,"It might seem a little strange that we, Sid the Elf, are reviewing The Final Sacrifice. You know, considering that it's not on the dvd and all. But, Sid only cares about the B; and he would be doing himself and his fans a great disservice by not informing you about this great MST episode. If you've never heard of The Final Sacrifice, finish reading this review then head over to sidtheelf.blogspot.com, where you can watch the movie and eventually read all our reviews and see lots of other cool stuff. When we finally get the site up and running, Sid defies you to spend less than 30 minutes there. Anyway, on to the review.

The Final Sacrifice is a terrible low-budget Canadian film made in 1990. Its main character is a horribly awkward teenager named Troy MacGregor. He apparently is an orphan, and one day he stumbles upon some of his dad's things. This includes a treasure map-seriously. So, he naturally follows the map in order to figure out some things about his dad. A classic moment happens when he finds a picture of his father and the MST guys say, ""Look, Larry Csonka!"" This was great because the guy was a dead ringer and because they played off of this joke for the rest of the show. So, Troy is following his treasure map and he suddenly is being chased by a creepy cult. The distinction of these guys was that they all wore black masks and black t-shirts(except the one guy who had a dark gray one; guess they couldn't spring the extra $5). These are the guys who supposedly killed Troy's dad, and now they're after him. They want to make Troy The Final Sacrifice. Now you get the title, right?

Troy finally finds a truck and hides in the bed. The truck belongs to the one and only Zap Rowsdower. ""Is he a makeupless clown?"" was the response from the guys. Awesome. This guy was either the best actor that has never worked again, or never worked again because he's a horrible actor. He so overdelivered his first line that it has become a staple in Sid the Elf's line playlist recently. For the record, the line is ""Name's Rowsdower, Zap Rowsdower."" He actually delivered the line like it was cool, like this was going to be his big break or something. Zap Rowsdower? He thought that was going somewhere? Even a porn producer would have said that the name sounds too made up. Anyway, the only way the actor(Bruce J. Mitchell) could be thought of as good was if it's a given that Rowsdower is supposed to be a fat, ridiculous drunk. If this is the case, Bruce deserved an Oscar because he nailed that. The best Rowsdower jokes were ""Is there beer on the sun?"" when Rowsdower is looking into the sky; and ""Yeah! My drinking arm is healed,"" when his drinking arm got healed.

Rowsdower becomes Troy's ally and helps Troy escape the black tees. They also employ the help of Mike Pipper, who can best be descibed as an old coot. He actually sounds like Yosemite Sam, which the guys take full advantage of at every turn. ""Know him? He was delicious!"" Troy learns from Pipper that Rowsdower used to be in the cult and possibly killed Troy's father! But he didn't, he was too wasted. And that's pretty much it.

The thing that makes MST so cool is that the movies they have on are completely utterly unwatchable on their own. Then, when you throw in the guys making their quips and observations BAM, instant high comedy. Sid knows he's not alone when he wonders how they ever took this off the air.",1209513600,2,3412,4.47191011235955
2103890,4,B0002M5TOI,"I have heard volumes about these two films' MST3k treatment, so this DVD was a must buy.  However, I would suggest this for fans only -- show an unprepared person Manos and they'll avoid MST3k for the rest of their lives.

I expected a lot more from Manos than it actually delivered. I've always heard it was the best MST3k episode, and the worst movie.  I can affirm the ""worst movie"" part; as to the best episode, it left me scratching my head.  Now, I usually watch MST3k eps over and over again ad nauseum -- and Manos is actually the one episode I can't stand to watch again.  It's not because of the horrible production values, which usually add to the hilarity, but because the subject matter made me feel ill.  This is not the cheesy happy-go-lucky stupidity of Cave Dwellers by a long shot -- which, admittedly, I was expecting.

Furthermore, the movie is physical proof that a MST3k episode's success rides very much on the movie mocked.  Although it has genuinely hilarious parts, Manos isn't entertaining as much as it is sadomasochistic.  Ultimately, it is almost too bad (in every conceivable respect!) for Joel and the Bots to carry.  For that reason, I wouldn't suggest showing it to anyone new to MST3k, but fans should definitely watch this if only to more fully appreciate the gags that appear in later episodes.

The surprise episode to me was actually Santa Claus Conquers the Martians.  I expected Santa and the elves attacking Mars with ray-guns and astronaut helmets, Rudolph dropping a load of napalm, something to that extent.  Instead, there are Martians with oddly applied body-paint, a man in a polar bear suit crawling around menacing small ridiculous children, and Martians with perhaps the laziest names ever concocted (Damar, the name of the father; Momar, the name of the mother; Girmar the girl... need I go on?) Hilarious episode, although some folks might find the saccharine sappiness as horrific as Manos.  However, Joel and the Bots are in top form, and I laughed so hard I cried.  It's definitely going to become a seasonal classic for me!

And as you can tell from the title of this review, this contains my favorite host segment: the Cartuner, a device that mixes two unfunny comic strips in one and makes the comic funny. This a sheer way to end MST's fourth season with a bang. 10/10

""Santa Claus Conquers The Martians"" is another favorite of mine, as Joel and the bots really rip on another Saturday-morning children's film involving Martians trying to find jolly ol' St. Nick himself to bring Christmas to Mars. As stupid as this film is, the commentary with Joel and the 'bots is uproariously funny, host segments and all. Let's have a Patrick Swayze Christmas for this one, why don't we? 9.5/10

In addition, you'll also get a funny half-hour outtake reel. 8/10",1172534400,,1122,4.623115577889447

I don't think Rhino is going to produce another Essentials DVD set since their compliations tend to come in 4 disc sets now. Hired! also comes in this package about the 45 yr. old who seems to have trouble training his car salesmen employees not to mention that he's 45 years old and still lives with his parents.,1170201600,3,455,4.3023255813953485

Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is a delightfuly sickeningly sweet movie, about Martians kidnapping Santa to bring Christmas to Mars, and the merry mix ups that occur when they also bring along two Earth children.  In contrast, ""Manos"" the Hands of Fate, is quite possibly the worst movie ever made.  The less said about this the better.  The MST group does their job quite miraculously, as they horribly abuse both movies (as well as the short ""Hired pt2"" accompanying ""Manos"" the Hands of Fate).

As a special feature, a blooper reel covering most of the show's run is also good for a few laughs.

Kidnap santa and bring him to mars so martian children can be happy like earth children?  Great idea, and with a touching ending to boot.  This will surely become a Christmas classic in my house, but mainly because of the commentary from Joel and the bots.  Check the scenes with the kidnapped earth kids on the ship back to Mars for what really makes this movie great.

If that wasn't enough, get ready to jab your eyes out instead of watching MANOS ~~ the Hand of Fate.  Quite possibly the single worst movie ever.  After an interminable drive, a family finds themselves at the creepy Manos Texas resort, home to the creepy Manos Lady Cult.  Even Joel and the bots can't do much with this one - I honestly had to watch it twice to make sure it was as bad as I thought it was.  And I was wrong; it was worse.

Without Joel, Crow or Tom Servo of course, these movies would all stink. Santa Claus Conquers the Martions is basicaly a movie about gigantic green honey nut cherrios honey bees who kidnap Santa and take him to Mars in hopes that the kids of Mars will be able to learn the true meaning of fun.

And we all know Manos : The Hands of Fate.  For two reasons, most of us are MST3K fans and because it has already been on tape.  Both it and Hired: Part II, came out on VHS years ago, along with the Blooper Reel which is just the bloopers and out-takes from Pooopie (Volume 1).  Yes, Manos, is bad, really, really bad, but why waste the space on this DVD with a repeater?  Why not a fresh MST3K episode not yet released.

Santa Claus conquers the martians: This is self-explanitory. The martians kidnap santa to keep their kids from being despondent. The Martians also kidnap billy and betty two earth kids, and bring them to mars with santa. Voldar, a martian who doesn't like santa or fun tries to kill santa and the earth kids. Dropo a goofy martian is made santa for mars and santa and billy and betty are sent back to earth just in time for Christmas Eve. There is a hideous song that palys over the credits that'll get lodged in your memory. Pia Zadora is an Martian child. Don't miss the badly costumed Polar Bear.

These are two of the BEST (next to time chasers) episodes. One is Manos which is already out but SO BORING that the MST3K boys had to find it and tear into shreads. The next is Santa Claus Conquers the Martians which is an older but funny as heck episodes. Both are hosted by the liad back more fuunier(in his time the invetions exchange was hilarious) Joel. Here a basic review

Manos- this is my favoirte and contians a great messege for those husband hating thelma and luise wannabes- Dont take directions from a man with a golf sweater. The story is of a family going on vacation and ends up at the worst Bed and Breadfast ever. The owner is a big knee stumble guy named Torgo who talks in quivering langage and has a crush on the wife (i did it I have n-n-n-nooo regrets) then he talks about his master and the master's dog kills the cute little family puppie(you never had a dog kid). at the end the family is taken over and put under the control of the womenaising master who like to burn off peoples hands in a cult vodoo cermionany( b-b-boss about you killing me, i am going to need my last pay check)

S.C.C.T.M this a older episode with chessy 'custumes'(as in the credits) and martians living in rat holes wearing anntenes. The plot is that the martian kids are wierd so the old man of the planet prescribes the kids a large dose of chirstmas( its chirstan holiday controlled by commercialism) and santa. They by accident capture two little kids and then santa witht the help of Tourge (a huge TV with a 6 year old play outfit) then the kids have to protect santa from the evil martians and santa is returned for the earth kids.

2103969,4,B0002M5TOI,"One of the reasons that MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 was such an entertaining and interesting show was that it illustrated a staggeringly large variety of bad filmmaking.  You'd be amazed at how many things it is possible to mess up.  There are the obvious things, of course: bad acting; illogical, incomprehensible scripts; cheesy dialog; woeful special effects.  The list goes on.  But there are many little things that can go sour too: obvious day-for-night shooting, inaudible sound recording, etc.  And, yet, with the literally limitless amount of mistakes that can be made, most of the films aired on MST3k fell in to one of two main categories of terrible movies: the films that were so laughably bad they became entertaining in their own right (so bad they're good), and those films that were bad because they were so unbelievably boring, slow and listless (so bad they're painful).  This ""Essentials"" collection features one of each kind, and each is represented by, perhaps, the most outrageous offender of this kind of bad film.

First up is the ""so bad it's good"" film: SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS.  At the time I'm writing these words, the Christmas season is well upon us and it becomes childishly simple to name literally dozens of great, classic Christmas movies.  They're broadcast continuously on the airwaves starting from the end of Thanksgiving, so it's easy to forget that making your film a story about Christmas is not a guarantee of success.  SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS is one of the goofiest movies ever made (and you only have to look at the title to figure out that one).  The plot involves a kidnapping attempt on one Mr. Kringle (no, not the annoying dork from the Best Buy ads) by a group of -- you guessed it -- Martians.  Yes, it is a kids' movie and, yes, kids' movies often don't stick to the rigid doctrine of logical coherence, but this is mad stuff by anyone's standards.  Look for a young Pia Zadora for additional amusement.  This is entertaining.

And as entertaining as SANTA is, MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE is anything but.  MANOS is arguably the most famous episode of the show and is something that every fan of the series needs to endure.  And note that I stated ""fan"" there.  This is certainly not a film for people new to the genre of bad filmmaking.  It's bad.  Really bad.  Bad in the worst way, really -- it's incredibly, unbelievably, undeniably boring.  You may think you've seen bad movies before, but this one is rough to get through.  If you're up for a challenge, go for this.

These are truly the essential episodes of MST3k.  SANTA is funny enough in its own ineptitude, so the mocking comments of the cast are purely a much-welcomed bonus.  And MANOS is painful enough in its own right that the heckling is a much-needed distraction from the pure misery.  This is a great introduction to the series as it's terribly representative of both extremes.  If you want to know what MST3k is all about, then this is a good place to start.

(As an aside, I heard Michael J. Nelson doing a promotional interview on a local rock station a few months back and he still seems amused by the fact that ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"" literally means ""Hands: The Hands of Fate"".  As, as I must say, am I.)",1103587200,25,3241,4.654929577464789
2103970,5,B0002M5TOI,"This is an inexpensive, truly essential set from Rhino. I know that ""Manos"" has been released before, but it is, after all, the number one requested MST of all time, and for good reason.

By now almost everyone knows that ""Manos"" is one of the worst movies ever made, appropriately by fertilizer salesman (really) Harold P. Warren. (Is he perhaps a distant relative of ""Batwoman"" director Jerry Warren?) The film is a tale of a family caught in the snare of pure evil, symbolized largely by Torgo, a caretaker with big knees. (""Uh, that's not how you wear your Depends, Torgo."") Everything about this movie is the worst in class; those people who believe that Ed Wood is the worst director of all time have clearly never seen ""Manos."" As if ""Manos"" weren't enough, the same episode features an otherworldly short (""Hired, Part Two"") featuring a man on a porch in a rocking chair swatting at flies, and demonstrating that it is possible to look demonically possessed with a handkerchief on your head. (""Ah! Flying elves are back!"") This is truly a wonderful short. Also on the disc is a reel of outtakes (""poopie"") which range from amusing to hilarious. For my money the best of the bunch is the attempted ""Torgo's Pizza"" sketch. (""Let me just get your complimentary crazy bread."" ""No!"") I would guess that I have seen ""Manos"" probably thirty-plus times over the years, and it still endures as the pinnacle of MST3K as a concept.

The real treat in the set is ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians,"" an early Comedy Central episode, and one of the greatest of all time. The film stars nobody, but does mark the screen debut of Pia Zadora as Girmar (""Girl Martian,"" get it?) in what may be her most convincing role to date. The concept is awful, the costumes, acting, sets, and cold war, extraterrestrial Santa kidnapping plot must be seen to be believed. I am particularly fond of the comic relief provided by Droppo, the laziest man on Mars. Also prominently featured is the most inane theme song in movie history, composed by no other than Milton DeLugg. Who is Milton DeLugg? You might know him better as Chuck Barris' bandleader from ""The Gong Show"" (and you will definitely want to gong the theme song). This one really hurts, but in a good way.

There has been some disagreement in the reviews, but my set did come with the bonus DVD, ""Shorts Volume Three,"" and even though I have seen them all before, they don't disappoint. My favorite of all is the unreal ""Once Upon a Honeymoon,"" which features some of the world's worst musical production numbers, featuring rhythmic telephone dialing. This disc is a wonderful bonus, and I am delighted to have all these shorts together in one place.

For the price, this set can't be beat for a diehard MSTie, or someone new to the show who wants to start out with two of the best episodes of all time. This set is highly recommended.",1100476800,123,2876,4.655511811023622
2103971,5,B0002M5TOI,"This DVD is probably worth the price just for the ""bloopers"" (or poopie as MST3Kers call it). It contains one of the worst movies ever made, ""The Hands of Manos"" which is justifiably torn to pieces by Joel and the bots. The other film, ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" is an episode I had not previously seen so I was happy to add it to my collection. If you are an MST3K fan then you will enjoy this collection. If you are not, then you probably don't enjoy any of the MST3K episodes. This one is worth having and at a reasonable price.

I would really like to see Rhino (or someone) release full seasons of MST3K, at a reasonable price.

Anyway, Manos was far and away #1 in this poll, and Santa Claus Conquers the Martians was #2.  That's likely why those two episodes were chosen for the set.

Actually, you guys should be VERY thankful...SCCTM just barely beat out Mitchell for the #2 spot, by a scant 6 votes.  That, of course, would've resulted in this whole set being stuff that's already been released...so we're pretty lucky that at least something new came out of this.

2103976,5,B0002M5TOI,"This 2-disc collection is truly essential for all fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000.

""Manos: The Hands Of Fate"" is unquestionably one of the worst things ever filmed.  (I hesitate to call it a movie.)  Even Dr. Clayton Forrester and TV's Frank apologize to Joel and the 'Bots for forcing them to watch this.  The first 15 minutes or so consists of nothing more than footage of a car driving out in the countryside.  Fortunately, Joel and the 'Bots provide hilarious commentary during the long periods when no dialog is spoken.  Torgo, the caretaker with a severe case of water on the knees, is a far more interesting character than his evil master.  The scene of the master's six wives wrestling in their nightgowns is, as Tom Servo and Crow point out, probably the only reason this film was made.

""Poopie!: The Official Outtakes Reel"" is included as a bonus feature.  I must commend Crow T. Robot and Tom Servo for valor above and beyond the call of duty. Crow's head catches fire, Tom's head falls off and, troopers that they are, they continue speaking their lines without missing a beat. Joel spaces out, Mike cracks up, Dr. Forrester and TV's Frank blow their lines and break up laughing, yet Crow and Tom Servo never even crack a smile. Thirty minutes is the perfect length for viewing this, before the bloopers get too repetitive.

""Santa Claus Conquers The Martians"" immediately became my favorite Christmas movie after viewing the MST3K version of it.  The children of Mars are depressed because they are watching television transmissions from Earth about Santa Claus, while they don't celebrate Christmas on Mars.  One of the Martian children is played by Pia Zadora who, come to think of it, has a Martian sounding name!  Rather than create their own holiday, the Martians decide to come to Earth and kidnap Santa Claus.  Santa eventually wins over the Martians and is returned to earth unharmed, which is more than I can say for anyone who watches this movie.  The host segments are among the best, especially when Joel and the 'Bots sing ""Let's Have A Patrick Swayze Christmas,"" with lyrics by future MST3K host Mike Nelson.

""Open up your heart and let the Patrick Swayze Christmas in.
We'll gather at the Roadhouse with our next of kin.
And Santa can be our regular Saturday night thing.
We'll decorate our barstools and gather round and sing.
Oh, let's have a Patrick Swayze Christmas this year!
Or we'll tear your throat out and kick you in the ear!
It's my way or the highway, this Christmas at my bar.
I'll have to smash your kneecaps if you touch my car!
I got the word that Santa has been stealing from the till.
I think that right jolly old elf better make out his will!
Oh, let's have a Patrick Swayze Christmas, one and all.
And this can be the haziest...
This can be the laziest...
This can be the Swayziest
Christmas of them all!""",1095638400,12,2861,4.658051689860835

But I already paid about 20 bucks for the other two in video casset, about six months ago. So I feel pretty cheated right now.

RHINO: DON'T MIX OLD PREVIOUSLY RELEASED EPISODES WITH NEW ONES. IT'S NOT FAIR. ESPECIALLY IF YOU DON'T LABEL THE BLASTED COVER!

So yeah, a must have if you haven't seen Poopie and Manos.",1094169600,8,464,4.530120481927711

8029093,4,B0002M5TOI,"Two of the funniest MST3K episodes in a two DVD pack! These episodes both feature host Joel Robinson and his commentary with ""bots"" Crow T. Robot, Tom Servo with Gypsy in the background, being harassed and forced to watch bad movies by evil ""mads"" Dr. Clayton Forrester and ""TV's"" Frank. ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"" was a cheaply produced and overall pathetic attempt at a horror movie from the 60's, and ""Santa Clause Conquers the Martians"" is a lighthearted children's comedy from the same decade. Both are Turkeys. You may not be able to stomach repeated viewings of these two ""forgotten"" films, but if you're nostalgic for the old MST3K show, you'll be on cloud 9 from the satellite of love for a few hours again. Also included is the ""Poopie"" tape, basically a gag reel from the entire show (covering episodes and segments many years later in the series). You'll note that the gag real starts out with the profanity being bleeped out, but in later episodes (as the shows rating coarsened a bit being on a different channel and different management) it isn't, so earmuff the kiddies if you're watching this with them.

About the only thing missing from this disc are the ""uncut"" original versions of the films. The MST3K box sets have been notorious for being overpriced after being on the shelves for a short time, but this set provides the ""bear bones"" experience just as if you were back in the old days circulating the tapes. The visual quality is about the same as a high quality VHS tape. Not much more I can say, this one is pretty straight forward. If you don't enjoy this set, then you're probably not going to like the series overall (""MST3K The Movie"" is a slightly higher budget, lighter on the jokes version of the TV show, and a tiny bit more swear words thrown in).",1462752000,,1783,4.6069182389937104
8029094,5,B0002M5TOI,"Manos: The Hands of Fate is literally the worst movie I have ever seen.  So bad it has developed a cult following for how bad it is.  We bought this set as a gift for a college student majoring in film.  He had seen this movie on a list of the worst films of all time but had never actually seen the film.  What better way to see it than with the commentating case of Mystery Science Theatre 3000?  We projected the movie onto a wall and the entire family watched it together-- with much hilarity ensuing.  It was so fun laughing at the movie (as opposed to with the movie) that another family member bought and distributed t-shirts with a picture of one of the movie's characters the following year and the music preceding the entrance of that character (doot-doot-doooot-doot . . . doot-doot-doooot-doot) has become something of an inside joke.

Anyway, this is the perfect gift for someone into movies who also has a sense of humor.  After all, if you are going to enjoy the best films ever produced, you should know what the worst film looks like, right?",1458518400,,1058,4.473958333333333

8029098,5,B0002M5TOI,"I definitely prefer the two-movie format, as with the four-movie format always leaves me with one that I'm not really crazy about. ""Manos"" is a cult classic and supremely stupid, but I truly love ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians."" Although it also is a stupid premise, the silliness so entertains me that I could *probably* watch it without the riffs. However, I do find the riffing to be outstanding. Although I grew up with Team Mike, I think Joel's whimsy comes through perfectly in these ""child"" movies. Probably because it reminds me of the movies my mother had us watch growing up, without any irony. Well, as an adult I suspect she was extremely sarcastic, but I never noticed it as a child because her humor is more dry than Joel's. Unfortunate inheritance on my part, as everyone has to ask if I'm being ""funny,"" but it does allow me to appreciate gems like these.",1435536000,,875,4.651612903225806
