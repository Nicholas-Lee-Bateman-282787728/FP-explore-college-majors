2591798,5,B000FVGNPA,"If music is art then the Derek Trucks band have painted us a piece of art with their new DVD. What a beutifully awesome guitar player he is, not just with the slide, or picking away like a chicken. I've seen Muddy Waters and Lowell George, and yes Duane, but Derek is just in a different league He plucks notes out of the air, that make me think of a time long past, and then I wonder if this would not have been the perfect 60's band. The band treats each other with respect, but to quote Derek, you show your respect, then go in their and do what you do... Wonderful, beautiful music.",1153612800,7,586,4.149122807017544
2591799,5,B000FVGNPA,"I'VE SEEN ALOT OF MUSIC LIVE, IN MY 58 PLUS YEARS ON THIS PLANET BUT NEVER HAVE I WITNESSED THE KIND OF SLIDE PLAYING THAT DEREK TRUCKS DOES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

THIS KID IS OFF THE CHARTS. I THOUGHT HE WAS OUTSTANDING WITH THE ALLMAN BROTHERS ""LIVE AT THE BEACON"" DVD JAMMING NOTE FOR NOTE WITH THE LEGENDARY WARREN HAYNES BUT THE PLAYING ON THIS DVD IS WAY ABOVE THAT. A GREAT SUPPORTING CAST ROUNDS OUT A INCREDIBLE 2 HOUR SET. THE FILMING IS TOP NOTCH. I OWN OVER 250 CONCERT DVD'S AND THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST. SUPPORT THIS MAN AND HIS BAND AND BUY THIS DVD TODAY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1152921600,57,591,4.422018348623853
2591800,5,B000FVGNPA,This band rocks no doubt.  Excellent presentation - widescreen / dolby.  Made for HDTV's.......,1152662400,5,95,5.714285714285714
2591801,5,B000FVGNPA,"Simply amazing stuff. Not always a tour de force musically (although Key to the Highway will kick your but!!!), rather it highlights how Derek and Kofi can be very subtle in their playing and still send chills down your spine.  The rest of the group is awsome too, with the Count shinning on percussion and Mike belting out some serious sound from those lungs.

A serious lesson in world/Eastern music too.  This is fusion rok/jazz pushed through India and Pakistan, with a laid back feel, that still manges to rise up and slap you in the face from time to time. Great straight blues and jazz stuff too, and the orginal tunes have a seious funk/R&B flavor to them.

My one disappointment- no ""Revolution"" from the new CD.  But some new riffs and bridges added to old favorites made up for that.

In all, a shinning example of how musicians who care about music can alter how the listener sees and appreciates music.

Amazing.",1152662400,7,925,4.603658536585366
2591802,5,B000FVGNPA,"This is a very well done DVD. The concert is well shot, the band are playng good and the sound is very good. The mix is very democratic with all instruments represented well. This is truly a band performance, where you can tell they are listening to each other.

The documentaries are very well done and give a nice insight into what makes Derek and the other musicians tick.

Very enjoyable.",1152662400,10,392,4.507042253521127
2591803,5,B000FVGNPA,"I had been eagerly awaiting the arrival of this DVD in my mailbox since I read that it was being recorded.  It does not disappoint.  It is an excellent representation of where Derek Trucks is as a musician and an clues the viewer in on why being part of a band is more important to his creative process than any solo/star turn could ever be.  In this DVD the viewer can see the continuing collaboraive process at work.

The song selection is first rate.  The band opens with Joyful Noise, the title track from the record that preceded songlines.  They play 20 songs including much of the Songlines record (unfortunately no version of This Sky, but you can't have everything).  Also included are blistering versions of two songs closely related to Derek and the Dominoes, Key to the Highway and Anyday.  The former is a clinic in how to construct a guitar solo and shows the differece in approach between Derek Trucks and most players.  Instead of attacking the solo and leaving it all in the first chorus, he starts slowly and builds to a climax.  Anyday, on of my favorite Clapton/Allman performances cooks with passion and technical excellence.

As for the video feed, the visual effect is stunning.  The colors are vivid, and one catches some of the subtle interplay between musicians.  I went back and made the logical comparison between this disc and the Allman Brothers Band's One Way Out, Live at the Beacon Theatre, and frankly the video is much clearer and more appealing (though I prefer the ABB musically).

The bonus features are quite nice, though I would have liked more.  A long piece about the nature of being on the road with the DTB and the approach to the music was informative and lots of fun.  It was especially gratifying to hear Derek talk about his career, friends and influences.  The second section ""Recording Songlines"" was a nice window into the recording process. The final section ""Working Overtime"" talked about Derek's workload, sharing time between this band and the Allman Brothers, and now the Eric Clapton tour.

All in all an excellent value in a DVD.  Watch it, the joy might be contagious.  Highly recommend",1152489600,10,2146,4.748648648648649

2591809,5,B000FVGNPA,"I bought this as a gift for my husband. It arrived quickly and in perfect shape. We enjoy music/concert style DVDs. It helps during the long, cold winter months. This DVD did not disappoint. We saw them with Susan Tedeschi this summer and while this is an older DVD, we still enjoyed it.",1420675200,,287,4.433962264150943
2591810,5,B000FVGNPA,"I've watched this thing so many times I'm in danger of wearing it out.  This performance channels the good ol' days when DT didn't have ninety odd people in his band.  I like Susan Tedeschi and cannot blame Derek for putting together an outfit with his beautiful and talented wife, but I don't really see why he had to destroy such a good thing to make it happen.  I loved DTB but I always feel a vague sense of sadness when I watch this show knowing that this killer lineup may never tour together again.",1417392000,,505,4.294736842105263

2591814,5,B000FVGNPA,"My approach to buying this DVD is simple.  This is the one and only DVD that is a full-length showcase of Derek Trucks in his own, original band  The Derek Trucks Band.  Although I enjoy all his work with Allman Brothers Band and, more recently, Tedeschi Trucks Band, his work in DTB is stylistically unique, boldly adventurous and dazzlingly technical without losing any of the rhythm and blues soul that he draws from.

Although DTB won a Grammy for its album Already Free, my personal favourite album of theirs is Songlines, so I am a bit biased with the choice material here.  The DVD is beautifully shot with a generous amount of close-ups of Dereks slide work (for you slide guitar nuts out there).  The sound quality is as good as you can expect from DVD.  All is well and good visually and aurally.

As a bonus, there are interviews with the band members, but these are just novelties.  The meat and potatoes is the music that the band create and how the band traverse through the musical passages, melding blues, jazz, rock and Indian classical in one fell sweep.  Over all that joyful noise is Derek Trucks with his vocal-style slide guitar licks that tug at your heart strings.  This is music played at a high level.  Highly recommended.",1400112000,,1248,4.622727272727273
2591815,3,B000FVGNPA,Not a good track of songs...I like Derek Trucks very much but this CD just doesn't have the good tunes The Derek Trucks Band is known for.,1392854400,,138,4.148148148148148
2591816,4,B000FVGNPA,This is a good view of how this cohesive band works.  The musicians are all on the same wavelength.  This also shows Derek from 10 years ago and shows his promise.,1390953600,,163,4.225806451612903
2591817,5,B000FVGNPA,"I'm a huge fan of these guys, so I might be biased. With that being said, I love this DVD. The sound of Derek's guitar has always brought a smile to my face. Especially when he comes in all clean and tight after a long, muted intro. Oh, yeah. That's the stuff!",1387324800,,260,4.019230769230769

Looks like I'm gonna' be in for a great evening!",1374278400,,341,4.451612903225806

2591822,5,B000FVGNPA,I had seen Derek Trucks play guitar with the Allman Brothers Band and then saw him onstage when I went to an Eric Clapton concert.  He's so talented that I just had to see him with his own band.  The delivery time was great so I didn't have long to wait!,1366329600,,254,3.9607843137254903
2591823,5,B000FVGNPA,"This video is an absolute pleasure to watch and listen to. Derek has elevated slide guitar technique and vocabulary in a truly inspiring manner. Additionally, he has an amazing band accompanying him. So, if you're interested in rejuvenating your slide guitar playing, check him out. Trust me, in no time you'll find yourself picking up that old slide, that's been gathering dust, and rediscovering your inner Duane Allman (or Derek Trucks, for that matter).",1357430400,,457,5.1891891891891895
2591824,5,B000FVGNPA,"If you like Derek Trucks and his command of the guitar, you will enjoy this.  Trucks is a guitarists' guitarist, he has a real and sincere approach to his music and his listeners; no histrionics just a focused professional showing how it should be done with style.",1357257600,,264,4.617021276595745

2591826,2,B000FVGNPA,"I watched Derek Trucks on the Crossroads DVD and fell in love with the song; 'Midnight in Harlem'. After reading the reviews on here I figured this would be a great concert but it wasn't.

I must agree that his lead singer is terrible! This guy does not have the sound I like nor does he blend in with this band. This band has talent but they will never go far with this guy having lead vocals! I have a large collection of DVD concerts but I don't see this one being played much.",1346716800,,480,4.1063829787234045
2591827,5,B000FVGNPA,"The Derek Trucks Band DVD, ""Songlines Live"" is excellent. The quality of video and sound is good, great performance and delivery was fast. I am extremely satisfied. Thank you.",1344816000,,175,5.068965517241379
2591828,5,B000FVGNPA,"This band is amazing! If you have never heard of Derek Trucks Band, buy this DVD! It is the perfect introduction to his music and incredible band. The musicianship of this group is beyond fantastic! No flash pods, lasers, or purple hair...just killer music being played by grownups.  Recommend! Buy it! 6 stars out of 5!",1344297600,,320,4.714285714285714
2591829,1,B000FVGNPA,"Dereck Trucks plays a mean slide guitar but my g@d, he needs to get rid of his vocalist.  The guy is a one note screech....its like the king with no clothes, no one will tell him that his singing is like violently scratching the chalk board.  He sends shivers up my spine.  Also most of Dereck's tunes are like a warm up to hopefully something better than its sum parts but it never goes anywhere.  I am always waiting for some type of groove, it don't happen.  Derck, go back to being a supporting player for better known groups.  Please.",1277251200,4,539,4.34
2591830,5,B000FVGNPA,I think Derek Trucks is one the most underrated guitarist out there. Not many bands are this good and tight anymore. I haven't watched to whole video yet but so far the camerawork and sound is great. If you like Derek also check out Robert Randolph family band.,1273449600,,261,4.458333333333333

The keyboard player is an incredible musician.",1269907200,,131,5.0
2591832,4,B000FVGNPA,"Derek Trucks is a superb guitarist, although probably not the most animated musician you'll ever see. I really liked the variety of this band's music. Video & audio quality are good. I'd love to see Derek and wife Susan (Tedeschi) in a joint effort (other than in Clapton's ""Crossroads""). Worth adding to your video collection.",1236297600,,327,4.963636363636364
2591833,5,B000FVGNPA,This DVD causes me to willingly lose two hours each time I turn it on.  My musical life is forever changed due to them.  Excellent!,1233446400,,131,4.2
2591834,5,B000FVGNPA,"This is an outstanding concert that was filmed at The Park West in Chicago on January 28, 2006. The music is very ""soulful"", ""jazzy"", ""smooth"", ""jam-oriented"", and ""spontaneous and improvised"" at times. The band is very talented and work very well together as musicians.

The line-up consists of: Derek Trucks on lead guitar(he plays excellent guitar work including slide guitar play), Todd Smallie on bass and vocals, Yonrico Scott on drums and percussion and vocals, Kofi Burbridge on keyboards, flute and vocals, Mike Mattison on Lead Vocals( He is an outstanding vocalist- his vocals flow along with the music just perfect),
and Count M'Butu on congas and percussion. The Band works together ""like a well oiled Machnine"".

The set list consists of 20 songs (about 2 hours of music), some highlights include: ""Joyful Noise"", ""Key to the Highway"", ""I'd rather be blind, crippled and crazy"", ""All I Do"", ""Sailing On"", ""Soul Serenade"", ""For my Brother"", ""Let's Go Get Stoned"", ""Voices Inside"", and ""Anyday"".

The encore consists of two more songs. If you like ""smooth"",""jam-oriented"", ""improvised"" ""bluey-jazzy"" music with excellent lead guitar work, you'll enjoy this one. I highly recommend this concert dvd.",1222387200,2,1210,5.291666666666667
2591835,4,B000FVGNPA,"Excellent dvd
Trucks is masterful
Disappointed that ""This Sky"" is not in the show.",1218931200,,82,4.928571428571429
2591836,4,B000FVGNPA,"Musically, this man is way beyond his years. He has pulled together and maintained an excellent band.  After watching the DVD keep it playing for some fine listening",1210723200,,165,4.892857142857143
2591837,4,B000FVGNPA,"These guys are all extremely talented and impressive. That is the first thing that stands out. The second thing is their ability to combine very diverse styles. Third is their unique way of combining multiple styles. Also in there is the surprise at Mike Mattison's ability to sing with completely different voices and styles and have complete conviction on each. I'm primarily a guitar fan and Derek Trucks is one of the few newer guitarists who can really deliver and connect with music in a passionate way. This is a good DVD and definitely a great price, but even with all of that, I just expected a little more from it. It could be me, but I just didn't connect with the music as much as I thought I would and I found myself skipping ahead 4 or 5 times. I love long instrumental jams and this has plenty of that and as I said earlier, when Mike steps up to sing, he really delivers, but I enjoyed their stuff on Crossroads 2007 far more. They just seemed to have a higher energy and dynamic there. I like hard rock, blues, some jazz, 70's era fusion (Jeff Beck, Al Dimeola, John McLaughlin etc), older Funk and R & B grooves and I like things mixed up in extended jams, so I did find this DVD to be enjoyable because these guys mix some of those and other styles in their own way, but some of the other influences seemed to lower the pulse of some of the jams. Jam bands put certain genres as the jam's musical core and bring the other stuff into it and I think that the core style is key to how well I connect with it. I'd give this 4 out of 5 stars at best .... Worth the money if you just love honest, live music and watching excellent musicians show what they're capable of.",1209427200,3,1683,4.246105919003115
2591838,5,B000FVGNPA,"Just great music and entertainment. This band is in excellent form

2591840,5,B000FVGNPA,"I am a big blues fan, but after 35 years of listening and playing blues music, there are few surprises. Sure there are great players, but you feel like you've heard it all before ... and then appears Derek. Even though I am old enough to be his father, I watch this young man in amazement. It's more than blues, but definitely blues-tinged. Even though I am sure he spent many hundreds of hours honing his skills, he has also been blessed with a gift that most of us can just watch and appreciate. Buy this video to watch the start of musical history.",1205798400,4,551,4.3076923076923075
2591841,5,B000FVGNPA,"I'm a Blues, Classic Rock fan, but I have to say I bought this DVD and I'm DAMN glad I did. What a GREAT Slide player, he is SMOOTH, what a nice touch. A Gibson SG player, so calm and focused, you could explode dynamite next to him and he wouldn't flinch! He has a unique slide style, remotely similar in certain ways to Sonny Landreth. I found Derek's music very easy to listen to. All the guys in the band look happy as hell to be playing with him.",1203033600,,450,4.011111111111111
2591842,5,B000FVGNPA,"This DVD showcases the amazing talent of the Derek Trucks Band.  I would highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.  In my opinion DTB is one of the best bands to see live and Derek Trucks is the greatest guitarist of our generation.  The DVD is done very well and the quality is superb.  For under $10 you'll have a timeless addition to your collection.  Derek Trucks is a gift to the ears...his straight from the soul solo's on this DVD are definitely face-melters sure to bring on goose bumps.  Not to take away  for his band, whom are all gifted and seem as if they were born to support him.",1202860800,,596,4.315315315315315
2591843,5,B000FVGNPA,"I had the great fortune to see young Derek while he was still playing with The Allman Brothers. I've had this DVD for awhile, I'm just catching up on my reviews. Hands down, IMHO, Derek is well ahead of the pack of the great young guitar players out there today. Everyone marvels at his slide work, as they should, but he has shown that he can use his fingers on his fret board as well. He will only improve with age and that could be scary to the competition.

Eric Clapton agrees with me too. He expressed that, (paraphrased) ""Derek Trucks has more licks and slide moves than most people who have had played for 5 times as long as he has"", in an interview with a local radio station, when he appeared here last fall. Coming from Mr. Clapton, it speaks volumes of Derek's potential.

Buy this DVD...you won't be disappointed!",1202342400,2,826,4.427631578947368

2591846,5,B000FVGNPA,"I first got blown away by the talent of Derek Trucks when he appeared with Eric Clapton when he was on tour. That wasn't that long ago. Derek trucks has been on the scene a long time, even though he is only in his twenties. So I guess that makes me a bit of a late comer in some ways. I have seen The Derek Trucks band since then, and they are brilliant. I really like the style of music they play. They infuse a new energy in the blues and mix in other influences, like jazz and african among others. The musicians are all beyond excellent. Even the keyboard player who also plays flute. I don't usually notice the keyboard player much in general, that may be because many keyboard players aren't that interesting. But because he is so interesting and good you can't help but notice. And you notice all the musicians the Bassist, the drums, vocalist and of course Derek Trucks. There is no deadweight in the band and that is why they can fly so high. I won't hesitate to see this band again. This DVD captures their great music, positive energy and band chemistry.",1191110400,3,1065,4.35678391959799
2591847,5,B000FVGNPA,This is smooth at it's best.  If you love funk/blues/jam stuff this is the best thing to add to your library.

2591850,5,B000FVGNPA,"I purchased this DVD immediately after seeing Trucks live in Sydney with Eric Clapton (Feb 07). I had also seen him on the live Allman Bros DVD. I can't get enough of him, and never tire of unique playing. On this DVD he explores a little broader music - eg African feel, but always returns to great blues and occassional gospel. I particularly enjoyed the keyboard and drumming...just great to watch. Having 2-3 guys singing made for some nice vocals work. Overally, a great DVD - probably more enjoyable than the Allman Bros live.",1173312000,,532,4.670212765957447

2591852,5,B000FVGNPA,"Any fan of Trucks will want this recording, but also any fan of good music too. What I like about this guy and this band is their open and sincere and high approach to music and culture and us as listeners (shows in how they relate to the audience and how they price this DVD).

This recording is well if modestly done. Nothing flashy here, just 6 guys playing well together. I was a bit surprised to have the show start with a few short interviews introducing the band and their approach to the music. Then for the next 2+ hours we get the full uninterupted concert. And I loved the show! And I was also glad to have had the reminder of the intention behind it.

I'm a big fan of Trucks but was more impressed by the rest of the band as well, the varied selection of tunes, the skill they played and interplayed with, and the general way they approach their task. As Trucks says in the intro these guys play as it is their church, and that includes us and the collective intention of the best the world has to offer.

This is the way to approach music; from the sacred, with humility, playfulness, joy, inclusiveness, and the love of doing it right.",1170979200,35,1150,4.290322580645161
2591853,5,B000FVGNPA,"Blues based improvisation at its best! That's what this latest release of the Derek Trucks Band's ""Songlines - Live"" DVD is. Filmed in high-definition, the sound and color of ""Songlines - Live"" matches the quality musicianship, hard at work. Twenty songs are included, plus bonus footage and interviews.

This DVD is excellent in every aspect. The original authored track selections and covers are extremely diverse, and it is obvious that Trucks' musical palette is far reaching, as Derek and his band cover a wide range of styles. There is no doubt that Derek has a very special understanding and appreciation of various genre's and influences, as The DTB covers Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Big Bill Broonzy, Don Robey, King Curtis, Lightnin' Hopkins, Ashford and Simpson, Herbie Hancock/Phil Upchurch, Clapton/Whitlock, Stevie Wonder, and Sister Rosetta Tharpe- talk about being musically open-minded! It is truly amazing to see how the DTB works their special flow of improvisation, especially the fearless leader Trucks. To my ears, every fan of slide guitar (especially us Duane Allman fans) should have ""Songlines - Live"" in their home music collection.

Highlights of the covers captured on this fine disc include the Clapton/Whitlock/Derek & the Dominos ""Anyday,"" ""Key To The Highway"" (which was also covered by the Dominos on ""Layla""), the Ray Charles smash hit (written by Ashford & Simpson) ""Let's Go Get Stoned,"" King Curtis' ""Soul Serenade,"" and Rahsaan's ""Volunteered Slavery."" Original authored standouts are; ""Joyful Noise,"" ""I'll Find My Way,"" and ""For My Brother.""

I would title The Derek Trucks Band as- forward thinking musicians, with an un-quenchable desire to explore, with very few musical boundaries. Is Derek Trucks the future of blues? I am not sure, as Trucks does not seem to want to be pigeon holed, but the music he and his band create is most definitely blues based, and the band seems to thirst for original American Blues music originally authored by founding fathers of the blues. It will be interesting to watch young Trucks grow, as he is only twenty-seven years old- so watch closely & stay tuned!

One other thought occurred to me about Trucks, and that is that I am thrilled with the fact that while Derek continues on with his own band, it is also fascinating to see him regularly playing with and (more importantly) learning with the current edition of the Allman Brother's, as well as with Eric Clapton's touring band, as from those road tested fathers of roots/rock/blues- one can only expect Trucks bear more fruitful growth. The Derek Trucks Band ""Songlines- Live"" is highly recommended listening and viewing- Enjoy!

As the musicians who surround Trucks are so very strong, I appropriately added the DTB entire personnel: Derek Trucks: guitar; Todd Smallie: bass and vocals; Yonrico Scott: drums, percussion and vocals; Kofi Burbridge: keyboards, flute and vocals; Mike Mattison: vocals; Count M'Butu: congas and percussion.

2591854,5,B000FVGNPA,"There is something about slide guitar... By choosing to play that way the guitarist accepts self-imposed limitations while opening up possibilities not accessible through standard pick and fingers techniques. I've listend to a lot of slide guitar music by greats such as Duane Allman, Ry Cooder, Lowell George, George Harrison, Sonny Landreth, and Australian wizard Kirk Lorange, but Derek has taken the style and approach to places I've never heard before. This is a wonderful DVD. Derek has surrounded himself with a band of seasoned and instrumentally formidable side-men and they play tight and soulful, creating a great selection of grooves and cooking hard when the soloing takes off. Don't make the mistake of thinking this is just a concert of blues music. There are modern jazz sounds, funky soul, African tunes and a slinky, lyrical extemporization on the folk standard, ""Greensleeves."" That said, the highlight for me, is Derek's 5 chorus solo on ""Key To The Highway."" This is a widely travelled, much covered blues, but following Kofi Burbridge's rollicking piano solo, Derek starts low and slow, taking his time and building his statement to a blueswailing crescendo as high as can be reached on the fretboard. The DVD is worth the price for this alone, but there's not a dud tune to be found and really, there are musical riches here that will make you want to watch this again and again.",1169078400,2,1402,4.995726495726496
2591855,5,B000FVGNPA,"derek trucks is unbelievable. drawing heavily from duane allman but also from indian music, r&b, funk, and many others, he creates a sound that is all his own. his guitar playing is absolutely phenomenal and when he and his band cut loose, hold on to your seats b/c you're about to be blown away! ive been a long time fan of derek trucks whether he's in his own setting or the allman brothers band. please do yourself a favor and check this dvd out. you'll never turn back",1168560000,,472,4.375

2591857,5,B000FVGNPA,"I'll admit that I was a bit apprehensive about buying this DVD thinking, oh it's just another relative of one of my generation's musical greats. Boy, was I totally wrong. This kid has done something that, in my opinion, makes a true musical icon. Within a few notes or at most a bar, you know who it is playing that magically sweet and absolutely unique sound. In this case it's a slide guitar that mimics no one, but is influenced by such a wide variety of genres that he has come up with his ""own"" sound. Think Clapton, Hendrix, Santana, Jeff Beck and you'll know what I mean. How long do you need to listen to one of their tunes before you know exactly who it is. Needless to say, I am blown away by this young man and look forward to many years of his growth as a musician.",1167782400,,777,4.1866666666666665

2591862,5,B000FVGNPA,"Derek Trucks guitar prodigy, nephew of Allman Brothers drummer (Butch Trucks) is truely an incredible musician/guitarist. I have seen Derek Trucks live a couple times with his band and the Allman Brothers. Its been a long time seen I have ever seen a young guitarist in their prime. Derek has the passion any aspiring guitarist would have he shows his raw emotion, talent, and love for the guitar on songlines live. His band which formed in 1997 has members ranging from all over the world including Derek Trucks(guitar), Todd Smallie(bass), Yonrico Scott(drums, percussion), Kofi Burbridge(keyboards), Mike Mattison(vocals), and Count M'Butu(congas & percussion). This concert was shot live at The Park West in Chicago, Illinois January 28, 2006. This DVD is filled with great music from the opening song Joyful Noise to the closing Up Above My Head. My personal favorites include Crow Jane, Volunteered Slavery, Key To The Highway, All I Do, Sailing On, and Anyday. These songs have alot of different aspirations. Their are a couple bonus features which include behind songlines, life on the road, and derek trucks side projects which include the Allman Brothers, and Eric Clapton's 2006 tour. I highly recommend this to any guitarist/musician. Derek Trucks Is Young, Energetic, And Inspiring!!!!!!!! 5 stars!!",1154908800,8,1312,5.3125
2591863,5,B000FVGNPA,"Before I bought this DVD, all I knew about Derek Trucks is that he did some second generation work with the Allman Brothers Band that helped bring that band back into the realm of my musical interests. I hadn't even thought about him lately until I spotted this DVD on sale at an area book/music store. The price was great, so I thought I'd give it a shot.
What a band! This DVD is astounding! If you like a little funk and soul, stirred with some Southern Rock, and shaken with a generous shot of the blues and a dash of world music, then you are bound to like Songlines Live. I can't recall the last time I saw a music DVD where the band is so tight and the music so fluid as it it here (Well, maybe Boz Scaggs Greatest Hits Live).
Some of the vocals are great and some I didn't care for, but I was never disappointed when Trucks and his band cut loose. My favorite here is the band's rendition of Key to the Highway. If you are familiar with Derek and the Dominoes' version (Eric Clapton's band), well Derek Trucks and his band just put them to shame. Trucks' play on that will make you forget you ever heard Clapton's version.
This is one DVD that's going to get a lot of play at my house. Take a couple of hours out of your day, put Songlines Live on, and get ready for a real musical thrill! The low price should make your decision to own this an easy one.",1154131200,40,1362,4.12406015037594

8127164,3,B000FVGNPA,I did not care for this DVD  Derek Trucks is a great slide  player but there was no energy in this performance.  I like blues Rock and this is not what I got in this DVD.  Jazz and Fusion most of the performance.  Some song just went on and on with Truck's expression never changing.  I saw his new Tedeschi Trucks band perform in Tulsa and Susan Tedeschi really helped this band get some energy.  The Show was great.  Hope there is a Tedeschi Trucks Band DVD soon,1479945600,,464,4.193181818181818
