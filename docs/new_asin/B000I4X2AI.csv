8180350,3,B000I4X2AI,"Being a Naschy fan, I waited a long while to see this movie, as it has a reputation for being one of Naschy's best. It's also rather hard to find, and when you do come across a copy, don't be surprised if its going for about $100.
First of all, what everyone wants to know immediately, yes, a werewolf and yeti do face one another in combat, but not until the very last moments of the film. There is also Naschy's obligatory eroticism; a very hot sorceress dressed like Elvira ( sans the boobs, unfortunately ); and a thrilling fight sequence between the Wolfman's human persona and an evil warlord that's pretty well choreographed.
While I certainly enjoyed this movie, I wouldn't consider it to be among Naschy's best. But, then again, I have very eccentric tastes. In my own opinion, unless you're a collector, check out HORROR RISES FROM THE TOMB, WEREWOLF VS. THE VAMPIRE WOMAN, DR. JEKYLL AND THE WOLFMAN, or HUNCHBACK OF THE MORGUE. You'll save more money, and, I believe, be more satisfied.",1463875200,,998,4.6440677966101696
8180351,5,B000I4X2AI,"This movie just makes me smile. Wacky plot(?), the general low-budget 70s ""we're having a good time"" tone that is just absent from today's movies. The story is something about a werewolf, a yeti, cannibal vampire naked women. I never quite got the gist of it, but I sure enjoyed watching it.

Anyone know any stories about this movie, the production, the release, the status of the rights, etc.etc.?

Contact me if you have any thing. This movie captivates me.",1157241600,4,460,4.7375
