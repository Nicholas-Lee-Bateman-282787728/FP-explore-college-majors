4504744,5,B004Z29WWG,"I have not been a big fan of hip hop and rap but this documentary was fantastic!  It depicts the evolution of hip hop as a music form from the 80's-2010, through the eyes of A Tribe Called Quest and many other luminaries, including Queen Latifah and Common.  The urgency of the beat never stopped throughout this unrated 98 minute experience.  It is music education at its best!  See it!",1312588800,7,387,4.485714285714286

Compared to The Beatles of Hip Hop, due to the comparison ability to incorporate sound and message in deeper ways that their mainstream contemporaries and the music transcends time. This movie documents their downfall, and its directed by a long time hip hop head, Michael Rappaport.

Director Rappaport found a worthy subject to display his passion for docu-directing and to add to his already impressive resume of film works.

4504995,4,B004Z29WWG,"It's not so strange that Michael Rappaport was involved in this project; hell, if given the chance I would have jumped at this one. I'm a huge fan of ATCQ, and I really enjoyed his work on this doc, but there were a few things that struck me as odd. I'm all for the story of Phife and his health, but it seemed that they spent most of the doc on just that. It, of course, led to a lot of the issues that he had with Q-Tip. However, it seems that they just glanced over the involvement of Ali Shaheed and Jarobi. It would have been nice to have more than just a blurb or two on these cats.

I did enjoy the back story of the guys, and of course their influences, and the exploration of the obsessiveness of Q-Tip. If you're a fan, this is a must-see; if you're into docs, I recommend giving it a look as well. Despite the at-times unbalanced timing, it's a great doc.",1356825600,,866,4.064327485380117

4504999,5,B004Z29WWG,"This documentary will be my all-time favorite hip-hop flicks to watch all of my life! To me, A Tribe Called Quest will be as one of my favorable groups of all time in hip-hop. From the start, I remember seeing the video ""Buddy"" from De La Soul, i was like they introduced me to their world. De La Soul and The Jungle Brothers were the beginners for the Tribe. One video I saw from ATCQ is ""Bonita Applebum"". ""People's Instinctive Travels..."" is a good old fashioned playful music speaks into our ears. When they step into the rap game, the stakes are really high. Then came The Low End Theory sets the tone of jazz. Q-Tip, he's a wizard for the group which he collected all the jazz records, funk, i'm like ""wow"" i was so impressed. Tip is the master of the group, but I rather give props to Phife Dawg, that almost draw me to tears when he's dealing with diabetes and his health issues and it was so personally interested to see him living his life thanks to his wife. Ali Shaheed, he's still doing his best doing his work outside of Tribe's work like Lucy Pearl and other things. Jarobi, I didn't knew how come it will come for him to leave the group before The Low End Theory came out. Jarobi's so special when he tell it to his heart about how he left the group. The Low End Theory drop the bomb in my ear and really saved me and part of my 90's jazz-rap soundtrack. Midnight Marauders were the best work of their life around. The end of their good times begins with their last two: 1996's 'Beats,Rhymes,and Life' and 1998's 'The Love Movement'. When I saw the footage of 2008 Rock the Bells Tour when they was beefing, it make me realizing this can't be working out because Q-Tip wasn't there for Phife because he dirt him off with interviews that made Phife really upset though. I feel too worry and sad about Phife of what he dealing with. 18 months later, ATCQ is fully back in the works. Congradulations A Tribe Called Quest and Michael Rapaport for lifted up the group's journey with the rise and fall of the Tribe!!! A Tribe Called Quest forever. The rap game needs you back and so do hip-hop.

4505000,5,B004Z29WWG,"This documentary is a look into an extraordinary group who really made their mark in this thing we call Hip Hop...not rap. Like many great groups before them the years together on the road took its toll and being human beings emotions ran high, but he music is above reproach and their legacy is cemented. if like A Tribe Called Quest this is a MUST SEE!!!",1349049600,,356,4.409090909090909
4505001,1,B004Z29WWG,"Phife couldn't accept his diabetes, overdosed on sugar, ruined his health, turned all bitter. Tip didn't like his attitude, and took t personal. They threw it all away over some really stupid ish. I love Tribe's music. Low End Theory and Midnight Marauders are two of the best albums in the genre. I always felt they could have done EVEN MORE (especially if you listen to J Dilla's beats on Beats Rhymes, and Life (the album)). Now I know why it all fell apart - damn. All I can say.

But that's not a review of the documentary you say. The best part of an hour and a half follows a really pathetic, really childish beef, that tore apart the best crew in hip-hop. Sound fun to watch? Only way I see someone wanting to see this, is if you're into Tip and Phife as people. Trust me, you won't like Tip and Phife as people after you've seen this. It's feuds like this, along with artistic laziness, that are the reason hip-hop is dead.

The only redeeming feature of this documentary is the 2008 Rock the Bells concert footage. Loved the performance of Excursions (Mos and Tip reading the lyrics off Tip's shirt - you have to see it). Phife always said that when they were coming up, as ten year old kids, all they wanted was to sound like their heroes. When you see these live performance, you can sorta hear flows that sound like certain crews and certain emcees that were stars in the 80s (Run DMC, Beastie Boys, LL). You don't hear that on the records. That's not enough to make it watchable though.",1348617600,3,1500,4.392086330935252
4505002,3,B004Z29WWG,"This movie is not as much about Tribe as a group as it is about Phife finding out he had diabetes and basically breaking up the group. Spoiler alert: the stuff about Phife and Q-tip as kids was entertaining, but then it got really depressing and just showed them fighting for the rest of the movie. Poor Ali got stick in the middle and he really got screwed IMO. I would have really liked to see more performance footage, more about the good times and more about the music! I would not recommend this film.",1337817600,,506,4.336842105263158
4505003,5,B004Z29WWG,Being a longtime fan fan of A Tribe Called Quest I had to buy this movie. It was interesting to see how the group came together and create excellent music. I recommend this to anyone who loves classic hip hop.,1332633600,,209,4.25
4505004,5,B004Z29WWG,Quite informative and very inspirational.  I don't agree with Phife and he should really give Q-Tip credit for keeping encouraging him when he sort of seem to have taken his gift for granted.  I never felt like Q-Tip was trying to control the vision of the group.  I was very suprised when he went solo because his public persona did not project thst image.,1330560000,,357,4.546875
4505005,5,B004Z29WWG,"Excellent documentary.  Amid the controversy before the cinematic release where the execs vowed to ""f--k Tribe"" out of their credits & backend dollars & beef with director Michael Rappaport edits & titling, Rappaport has crafted a great film that stays truthful to is subjects: A Tribe Called Quest.  The excitement of hearing Tribe songs in this context all over again is enough for the viewing of this release.  On Blu-Ray the masterful performances & production of Tribe is highlighted even more, the clarity is top-choice.

The extras are a wonderful bonus.  Explanations of the Native Tongue's demise straight (out the jungle) from mouths of members of Jungle Brothers, De La Soul, Black Sheep, Monie Love, etc. are revealing and entertaining.  Comments from pioneers like Kool DJ Red Alert on his involvement and Voilator 'Baby' Chris shed even more insight into the complex world of this genre changing crew.

The less than 24-hour delivery fro Amazon Prime was a shocking benefit, better than on-demand. Everything was of the highest quality & treament, props to Am & the makers of the dvd.

Most of all respect to Tribe for sharing even more of their instinctive travels.

I think that it was to the point and necessary with a mellow soundtrack of the bands best work. I love to know that they are going to try to make it, after the drama because I would not have wanted to see them perform on stage if they were still beefing behind the scenes. Bands, especially one's who are like family, are always going to beef. I am not talking to most of my family right now for disagreements we've had! Life goes on and everyone makes up when they can.

4505010,5,B004Z29WWG,"I'm a hardcore Tribe Called Quest fan so when i heard this film was being made i HAD to see it.  I saw it for the first time last night and i really enjoyed it.  It really takes you behind the scenes of the good times and bad times, and the present and past.  I enjoyed that all the members were very open and spoke their mind about their disagreements and tension within the group but also their love for each other.  The only thing i wouldve wished is a little bit more info about the production/release of their classic albums, particularly The Low End Theory and Midnight Marauders. Although that could be a whole documentary unto itself. These 2 albums are classic and are very important works in the hiphop world.  Kind of wished they broke down the albums track by track like they do on the ""classic albums"" documentaries.

All in all though it was a very entertaining peak behind the curtain of one of the most influential groups in hiphop that was well directed by Michael Rappaport (who is a great actor by the way).

4505012,2,B004Z29WWG,"Thank you Michael Rapaport, for taking the time and energy to film this documetary about the very talented and soulful ATCQ.
I've loved ATCQ since the early 90s. As a kid, their albums were the few that my mother would purchase for me, as they didn't have parental advisory warnings on them. I assumed that this documentary, directed by Michael Rapaport, would re-visit and re-open those days and this music that was so positive and so absolutely refreshing in contrast to ATCQ's less creative less optimistic 'hip hop' contemporaries
Unfortunately, this documentary has a very negative overtone which overshadows the uplifting and healing music that ATCQ produced in the 90s.
As a fan, I understand, through having read countless articles, that Phife and Q-Tip have had a rocky relationship: so what? This should not have been the bedrock, the foundation, of this film. Perhaps this was unintentional. A little more work, however, could have revealed a less abrasive plot line to follow. I felt the abrasiveness of this documentary from the beginning, as Phife spoke about his relationship to Q-Tip. This continued to the end of the film, when Q-Tip was not present at the film's debut. Michael Rapaport, this did not have to be your plot line. I wish you'd picked a more positive narrative to follow.

I think that I speak for a lot of ATCQ's more astute fans, when I say that we would have loved to have learned more about how the brilliant Ron Carter came to work on ""The Low End Theory."" Or how the Q-Tip, Large Professor and Pete Rock combined their powers for their various projects. Or what about the very ""purrrrrrty"" (says Mos Def in Black Star liner notes) Vinia Mojica? What about the Ummah? What about the Soulquarians? Where did Consequence come from? Did Ali Shaheed Muhammad contribute to album production? And Christ, how about we get into Neo Soul, a little bit. ?Love (in ""Fantastic Volume 1""'s liner notes) says that ""Midnight Marauders"" was responsible for giving birth to the entire neo soul music movement, which continues, fantastically to this day. Michael Rapaport, I wish you'd have taught me; taught me and made me feel fantastic like ATCQ's albums always did.

There are great and beautiful parts to this documentary: animation, great interviews, great shots, video clips, etc. They are, however, unfortunately overshadowed by the plot line.

This music, and these three (sometimes y) talented men have touched a countless number of people through soul lifting intelligent music. They did not deserve to be cast in this light. I don't think that things should have been left out. I just feel that this film's through-line should have relfected, without blemish, their beautiful and positive music.
It's not too late, Mr. Rapaport. You can always make a sequel : )",1324166400,23,2792,4.948827292110874

4505043,4,B004Z29WWG,"Usually an actor, Michael Rapaport gets behind the camera and delivers one of the better documentaries of the year.  Clearly a fan, he looks at the career of an early popular hip-hop group out of Queens, New York called ""A Tribe Called Quest.""  They were/are an iconic group for the genre consisting of Q-Tip, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Jarobi White and Phife Dawg that peaked in the late 1990's.  While Ali and Jarobi have their moments, the conflict between Q-Tip and Phife kept the group from an even more successful career.  For a hip-hop neophyte like me, this film provides some insight into the beginnings of the genre featuring song mixes with added rhymes ""spit"" out as Phife likes to say.  As in most things in life, looking back at the history of the group, the bickering and power struggles seem trivial now.  Q-Tip seems like a natural leader and the force that guided the decisions.  Phife, struggling with diabetes all his life wasn't happy about his perceived slight.  Ali (the DJ) and Jarobi tried not to take sides.  The film is in Blu ray and the current filming is sparkling clear as you might expect and the DTS-HD ""beats"" will thump the subs; although the focus here isn't the music.  The vintage film Rapaport used is what you might expect from home movies.  The film is certainly worth a look even if hip-hop isn't your thing.",1322524800,,1345,4.656779661016949

4505051,5,B004Z29WWG,"First off: I loved Phife from jump.  He became a better MC on the 2nd album but there is something fantastic about hearing an MC when they are an unpolished diamond.  I wouldn't change anything about his contribution to People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm.  I always respected Q-Tip as the leader of the group.  That is undeniable.  However, there was never a Tribe without Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Jarobi, Phife AND Q-Tip together.  Everybody played an indispensable role in making ATCQ what it became.

A Tribe Called Quest are like the standard of greatness to me. They are my favorite music group.  Outside of my friends and family I love them more than anything.  When I think of great collaborating vocalists I put Q-Tip and Phife at the top of the pile.  That includes John Lennon and Paul McCartney, Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, Andre 300 and Big Boi and Run and DMC.  Their chemistry was so perfect that it just seemed like it was meant to be.  I was a great fan of hip-hop.  I was a total hip-hop junkie BEFORE they came out.  Then Jungle Brothers came along - then De La Soul - then A Tribe Called Quest.  I never knew that I could have such a deep appreciation for something until they flipped the script on the music paradigm.

Michael Rapaport did an amazing job.  I am awestruck that the first choice for a feature length hip-hop documentary that played in movie theaters was made for A Tribe Called Quest.  They sold millions of records but they never sold records like Eminem, Jay-Z, Tupac or Biggie (or quite a few other acts).  Not even close.  The choice of A Tribe Called Quest was a wise choice.  Their influence has now spanned at least two generations of hip-hop.  Every Tribe fan that I know is a die hard loyalist like myself.

I do not think that the ""beef"" did anything to tarnish their legacy.  The documentary elevated them in my view.  It seems like being in a band where you are around each other constantly is a great training ground for marriage.  Eventually, you will perceive negatives in each other.  Navigating those negatives and achieving a goal for the greater good is what a working relationship is all about.

I accepted the break up when it happened.  I prepared myself for it beforehand.  I always figured something that beautiful would never last.  I grew up with their music.  I started a successful business listening to their music.  One of the first conversations that I had with my future wife was about A Tribe Called Quest.  That conversation never ended.  They taught me that details are important and to follow through on your vision.

A Tribe Called Quest - THANK YOU.  Michael Rapaport - THANK YOU.  To the entire Native Tongue family - THANK YOU.  Listening to The Low End Theory for the first time remains the most exciting moment of my life.  My wife knows that if I pass before she does - Can I Kick It? MUST be played at my funeral.

They turned me into someone who fought with his mind.  One day (years after their break up) I was watching MTV and they were playing a Tribe performance of Can I Kick It? from 1998.  My wife said that I was watching with a look of pain in my eyes.  She lovingly rubbed my head and didn't say a word until the clip ended.  I listen to their music all of the time.  However, seeing them live was like reopening an old wound that never quite healed.  This documentary completed the healing process for me.",1320451200,35,3414,4.494290375203915
4505052,5,B004Z29WWG,"Arguably one of the greatest hip-hop groups to ever live, this documentary on ATCQ almost had me in tears.  It is sad to see how the business side of hip-hop takes its toll on childhood friendships.  It also brings to life the harsh realities about the industry and how retirement is not an option for most.  Sure, hip-hop artists and athletes today are smarter and are investing their money so that they can one day retire, but it wasn't always like that.  I think this movie was well made, despite the controversial aspect of it and threatened lawsuit that resulted.  The only way this could have been better would have been if the title was prefaced with ""A Spike Lee Joint"".",1320192000,,678,4.570247933884297
4505053,5,B004Z29WWG,"For any true hip-hop fan, if you haven't seen this the time is now. And make sure that you have no plans during this viewing. A Tribe Called Quest lives.",1320019200,,153,4.133333333333334
4505054,4,B004Z29WWG,"I came to this DVD knowing little, if anything, about the hip-hop group The Tribe Called Quest. I'm a music journalist but hip-hop is not my focus. I think I moved to other music styles after the heyday of the Sugarhill Gang (who I still love). So my review is from the standpoint of a viewer watching a documentary about a subject with which they are not familiar. Amazon regulars will know I review quite a few documentaries.

That said, I found this film very enjoyable to watch. Actor Michael Rapaport is a huge fan of the group - which had a 20-year career until they disbanded in 2008. Yet, though he asks questions in the interviews that a fan would want to know, he doesn't get in the way of the answers. In fact, some ""fans"" may feel unfulfilled when they discover that none of the group members ever explain exactly what caused the breakup. Sure, it was differences - hey, 20 years is a long time (and two of the members knew each other since second grade!) - but we don't get more details. What we DO get is interviews with other hip-hop artists that came after ATCQ as well as the band members themselves. And plenty of performance footage.

The bonuses include 25 minutes of ""deleted scenes"" that real fans will want, a throwaway 5 minute ""on the Red Carpet at LA Film Festival"" and ""Bringing Beats to Life"" - a 10 minute featurette on the innovative graphics used by Rapaport - that I find interesting but have little, if anything, to do with the band.

This is certainly a ""must see""  and, probably, ""must own"") for any ATCQ fan. For those, like me, who know little about them, it's an entertaining 97 minutes which will tell you most of what you want to know about this most influential hip-hop group.

4505055,5,B004Z29WWG,Enjoyed seeing where some of the music originated from and how they created the songs.  I also appreciated understanding what all of the drama was about behind the scenes.  And of course loved the music!,1319328000,,203,4.771428571428571
4505056,4,B004Z29WWG,"ATCQ is hands down the best Hip Hop group that has ever lived - no disrespect EPMD, DeLa, Run-Dmc etc. The documentary shows the chemistry that made them great and also caused them to fall apart. Q-tip & Phife are like brothers and like brothers they fight over stupid stuff. They both love each other, but they both can't stand each other at the same time. Q-tip knows that he is the creative force of the group and he can't understand why Phife won't go along with his vision. Phife can't understand why Q-tip thinks he should be in control and there lies the conflict. Both think they are right and the other is wrong. This tension is what made the group outstanding and also bound for a breakup. Michael Rapaport shows both sides of the story in a very unbiased way, which helps the movie to be great. I would have liked to have seen all the group members sit down and be interviewed at the same time, but you can have everything. So 4 out of 5 mics for me!",1318982400,6,961,4.285714285714286
4505057,3,B004Z29WWG,"Victor Valdivia , DVD Verdict --Beats, Rhymes & Life does a solid job of showing how the group members exist today. While Q-Tip launched a prosperous solo career and has also branched out into acting, Phife has all but left hip-hop behind to follow his passion for sports, acting as a basketball scout. In one of the film's most telling moments, he even states bluntly that his affinity for music is so minimal that he can ""take or leave"" hip-hop. It's this disparity that manifests itself during Tribe's 2008 reunion tour, as Q-Tip and Phife become increasingly frustrated with each other. This is not a whitewashed documentary-the group members describe, in sometimes shocking honesty, how the group came together, how they created their most enduring music, and how their relationship has changed, not always for the better, as they aged and became famous. After watching Beats, Rhymes & Life, you will definitely have a better understanding of who these men really are.

Nonetheless, there are some significant gaps in the storytelling. For one thing, the film doesn't explain just how groundbreaking Tribe was when they first emerged in 1990. This is touched upon here and there, but when viewers who are unfamiliar with the history of hip-hop see Tribe in their admittedly silly-looking clothes and hear their music, they won't quite understand just what a revelation Tribe's music was back then. Hip-hop was so radically different back in that era and while some of the interviewees, particularly Muhammad, mention that, the fact that this is glossed over so casually is a huge oversight. When artists here from Common to Pharrell Williams of the Neptunes talk about how tremendously influential Tribe's early records were, viewers who weren't following hip-hop then won't necessarily understand why. The documentary shows us Tribe's music, but doesn't really put it in the right context.

An even bigger failing is that one crucial question is left unanswered: why did Tribe break up in 1998? Rapaport states in various places on this DVD that this is a question he wanted to answer, yet he really doesn't do so. There's a brief reference to a tense business meeting with representatives from Tribe's record label, and Q-Tip recalls that after the meeting, he immediately decided to break up the group. What happened at this meeting? Did the other members agree with his decision? This section is so unclear that even with Rapaport's commentary, you won't know any more about the break-up after watching the film than you did before. The break-up clearly had a huge impact on the relationships within the group-you can see it in the conflicts that erupt during the reunion tour-so the fact that it's so sketchily detailed is a sizable failing. This should have been a much more comprehensive documentary, even as good as it is at times.

The extras on the DVD are unfortunately not any more enlightening. Rapaport's commentary is worth hearing because he does explain some of his decisions in how he made the film, although there are still some holes left unfilled. ""Bringing Beats to Life"" (10:20) isn't about the film; it's really about how the animation that opens the film and is interspersed throughout was done. It's only mildly interesting. ""On the Red Carpet at the L.A. Film Festival"" (5:12) contains interviews with various celebs and musicians at the film's premiere, as well as all the members of Tribe except Q-Tip. There are some great deleted scenes (25:04) that address some interesting issues regarding the group and its history, although they still don't answer all of the remaining questions. At least the anamorphic transfer and 5.1 surround mix are both solid, although some of the archival footage looks and sounds a bit rough.

4505060,5,B004Z29WWG,"I was worried about this movie because of all the controversy surrounding it, but I must admit this movie is pretty good--I love this group, I bought The Low-End Theory back in the early 90's, and I could not stop listening to it.  At that moment I was hooked and became a huge Tribe fan.  I not sure why Q-Tip was tripping so much, the movie was fine, Great groups whether they are Rock, Pop, R & B or Rap go through personality issues, it happens.  I still Love em, because They did Hip Hop right.  Long Live ATCQ!!",1316649600,2,517,4.191919191919192
4505061,5,B004Z29WWG,"This documentary left me speechless. I consider myself a true ATQC fan and hats off to Michael Rapaport for schooling me. Love the fact that he didn't if ever show himself in this film of his. I think only once I saw him. The way it transition from them talking about the lyrics and into the actual video was amazing. I also love how Q-Tip was in a park talking one on one with the camera. He gets lost in his own thoughts and stared at the sky and they kept filming him in silence. Made me get lost just thinking, ""What is he thinking"". In all I absolutely love this and will continue to watch over, and over again.

Peace and Blessings....",1316044800,4,641,4.211382113821138
