1213590,5,B00000G022,"Having treasured this film since its production, I am thrilled to have been able to update my aging VHS copy with this pristine DVD. It feels like a rebirth in more ways than one. Our current age of ecological crisis and commitment provides a ripe climate for this Medieval tale. Many Americans of European heritage can look back to the historical chapter depicted and understand how their lineage lost sacred connection with the Earth, and determine that it can be restored. So this is truly a story whose time has come...again!

Art Historian, co-producer, and co-screenwriter Pamela Berger was inspired  by the 13th-century accounts of a Dominican monk who was a part of the early Inquisition in France. His treatise showed adequate cause for this pious predator to have brought a certain healer, herbalist and ""Mistress of the Beasts"" to trial and probable death as a heretic. Dr. Berger went further and  created a more complex plot which shows the Monk's condemnatory eyes ultimately turned inward for a personal reckoning.

Of course the Dominican friar, Etienne de Bourbon (Tcheky Karyo), with his aristocratic family roots and theological education, strides into this isolated French village with an innate sense of superiority and entitlement, however arrogantly he might protest his humility. He tries to enlist the support of the local cleric (Jean Carmet) in routing out enemies of the faith, a pursuit the good, older, wiser priest dismisses as absurd: ""There are no Heretics in my parish. My people are as pious as they are poor."" But the intruder remains as rabid in his quest as a dog with a bone.

The good Trickster priest has already confided to his house-keeper (and probable life companion) his assessment of the Inquisitor's eyes : ""like a bat's ~ fierce, unblinking, and blind.""  When the Monk wanders into the Sorceress' woodland domain with his nose in his breviary, he obviously only has eyes for his abstract, sky-based God. As Theologian Mary Daly noted in Beyond God the Father, ""New space has a kind of invisibility to those who have not entered it.""

The eyes of the Woods-Woman, Elda (Christine Boisson) are anything but blind, with her first request to the Friar ~ that he move his shadow off her collection of drying leaves ~ resonating on levels physical and psychological. Etienne's avid gathering of evidence against Elda as a ""vetula"" a Sorceress using crafts of the Devil, is prompted as much by his sexual conundrums as by church dictates, since Elda is a very comely woman.

In resurrecting and amplifying this tale, Pamela Berger joins the cause of Shakespeare and other writers of his day, who also perused church documents from the Inquisition and, in doing so, culled magical stories of the peasantry, resurrecting in their plays  fairies, sprites, and other such spirits of Nature. Bravo!",1204675200,6,2835,5.002123142250531
1213591,5,B00000G022,"A historically based movie set in 13th century France.  Etienne de Bourbon was a Dominican Friar who sought to root out heresy.  Based upon his writings and the story about his experience called The Holy Greyhound, so sort of a true story for events 750 years ago.  Beautifully filmed, a classic in religious studies classes.  A movie I'd like to see again just for pure enjoyment.  Highly recommended.",1037664000,10,402,4.852941176470588
1213692,5,B00000G022,"A most amazing story based on fact.  This little known movie tells the story of the first wave of killing ""heretics"" or what some call the ""burning times"" when hundreds of thousands of people (mostly women) were killed for their beliefs.  This was where the church was attempting to kill off the competition.  The second wave was also known as the ""witch craze"" where, at the same time as the crusades and the black plague they were killing (mostly women) who seemed different or who had land the church wanted (if their husbands had died and they were widows, especially) or were part of the social uprising at the time.  The 2nd wave lasted about 400 years.  The first one was shorter.  Monks traveled and decided whether folks were heretical in their practices.  The secular government then meted out the sentence if the (mostly women) were found to be heretics.  The sentence was death for the most part.",1407542400,,908,4.7025316455696204
1213693,5,B00000G022,"I've been taken by this story ever since the first time I saw it. I actually was looking for it for some time
I just didn't think they ever made an English version of the story. It leaves one to think.. since the canonization of saints
is a dogma the was instated only in the catholic church, and by the catholic church, are we really entitled to say
who or what is sacred in the eyes of God, in man or Beast?",1378252800,3,409,4.0

1213696,5,B00000G022,This is an excellent movie.  I saw it years ago and have been trying to find a copy of it ever since.  The French version (with English subtitles) is much better than the English version.,1346457600,3,187,4.314285714285714
1213697,5,B00000G022,This is a truly remarkable film about a little village in France during the time of the Inquisition.  All about human strengths and frailties with a wonderful cast.  Tells the tale of an all-too-human monk on a quest to stamp out corruption....and then he meets the Forest Woman....and himself.,1326153600,3,294,4.979591836734694
1213698,4,B00000G022,"This is a movie I saw in the 1980's and it made such an impression on me that I longed to see it again. However, it never appeared in video stores nor on tv, So I  searched for it on Amazon and was delighted to find it.
There was a change in this version over the first one;in the version I saw, the sorceress was actually put on the fire to be burned as a witch and saved at the last minute, but in this version, the monk decides to take her part before she can be burned. It was less dramatic but it works too.
Historically, it gives a remarkable insight into  life in southern France in medieval times, and how people used herbs for healing, and foreshadows the evil to come of the Inquisition, and hunting down of ""witches"".",1266192000,3,728,4.156028368794326
1213699,5,B00000G022,"Sorceress is in my view the best film depiction of medieval religion and culture, one that I use regularly in my classes.  Based on the legendary dog 'saint' Guinefort, the story explores the clash of noble and village culture; outsiders such as Dominicans looking for heresy contrasted with the village priest who is one of his people; medieval understandings of Christianity; and the role of healing women and men.

Although some liberties are taken with the story of the Dominican Etienne de Bourbon's life, who wrote about Guinefort at the end of his life and the healing woman Elda is much more young and beautiful in the film than in the original tale, this is a stunning film that provides great insights into 13th-C. life and beliefs.",1250985600,9,742,4.834645669291339
1213700,5,B00000G022,"I loved this movie. It's old, in French and subtitled, but so well done for it's day. It's based on a true story, the social challenges faced at the time: the beliefs of the Church versus the beliefs of the local people. Whereas the local people did not think the beliefs were in conflict, the Church did. The 13th century Dominican friar is sent by the Pope to find heretics throughout the land and he finds a woman in a local village who heals people with herbs and declares her a heretic,  sentencing her to burning as a witch.
There are a few twists and turns and in the end the friar realizes his own humanity and can relate to that of the local herb healer. I won't spoil the ending, but it's an inspiring film.",1229558400,,717,4.272058823529412
1213701,5,B00000G022,"the movie DVD the ""Sorceress"" was very good, telling a true story of woman healers being beaten down by men of faith, wrongly treated. Good acting.",1219190400,3,147,4.6923076923076925
7908669,5,B00000G022,"A remarkable insight into the interweaving of folklore, the human heart, and the medieval church.  I really enjoyed everything but the dubbing.  I think movies should be left in their original state.  At least make it language optional. I have had an epiphany much like the monks.  A. Not everyone reads subtitles well, fast and in English.  I have a hard time keeping up with the middle eastern and Russian language paired with English subtitles. I do sometimes check to see if the language is optional, so giving the fact this service is getting higher every month Amazon could make more language options.  I do realize this movie probably isn't a top priority or money maker so I will end this with thank you for this rare find.",1522972800,,731,4.671875
7908670,4,B00000G022,"For awhile I was somewhat put off, afraid that this was going to be a stereotypical story about a naturally godly healing woman, Elda, who would be burned as a heretic by a rigid doctrinaire Dominican friar, Etienne, although the medieval settings and the notion of a dog who dies for sake of humanity and is elevated to the status of a saint certainly piqued and kept my interest. (Of course it would, since I write about the mystical bond and truths I've learned from my Afghan hound, Baltho, who is now on his third reincarnation with me in Baltho, The Dog Who Owned a Man; https://www.amazon.com/Baltho-Dog-Who-Owned-Man/dp/098184300X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1520447590&sr=1-1&keywords=baltho%2C+the+dog+who+owned+a+men). I was relieved that the Dominican Etienne grew enough to chasten himself, open his heart, and stop persecuting the humble though typically right Elda.

What might easily be missed is that the movie works by drawing a number of redemptive parallels.  Both lead characters, it turns out, are gifted by knowledge gained through sexual violence and pain. The friar Etienne  as a young man was so shamed by his father for not participating in the killing of a deer that he fled and raped a young woman who was knocked out running away from him. She later bore his child, whom he knew nothing about (nor do we) till the end of the movie.  He is informed by the family friend who comes to the village to meet with him that she was the mother of Elda, who was cast out of her village for bearing a bastard child. And Elda was raped by the nobleman who murdered her fiance; she bore his child.  That child was taken from Elda to be raised in a convent and now has been brought to the village by Etienne 's friend: he knew the entire story.  There Elda's daughter has, without full knowledge of the relationships it seems, taken up the healing path that Elda walks.

Both lead characters learn to turn their trials to the greater good of humanity. At the end we are reminded that all this has come about through the sacrifice of a greyhound who gave his life for a child and was killed by a haughty nobleman, whom God cursed for taking the life of the genuinely noble hound. That dog still works mystically as a healer of those who seek his intercession, thus his title of St. Guinefort.  The local priest-- a genuine and humble man of God, able to recognize that God works in wondrous and mysterious ways (another corrective parallel)--helps Etienne realize this.  The noble man who was planning to burn Elda because friar Etienne said she was a heretic at last recognizes the error of his ways and that God may well curse him just as he cursed the noble man who killed the greyhound to begin with--again, for saving his baby through the work of Elda.

The film is much deeper and richer than is immediately apparent. My life has led me to believe that life is essentially a mystery. We begin to realize the threads of the great tapestry being woven by us all when we allow ourselves to suffer, learn, grow, and look to the greater good.  Humbled and cleansed, we begin to see.",1520294400,,3101,4.724074074074074

As for the movie: This movie takes a great deal of liberty with Stephen of Bourbon and his relation to the town's people, but there are wonderful insights that are very profound about the story of St. Guinefort. The movie was acclaimed for its accurate portrayal of medieval life and costumes. A surprisingly enjoyable movie.",1511049600,2,581,4.542857142857143

Tcheky Karyo's intense performance as a medieval country priest shows how a good man can lose control of his own decency, when he permits dogma to overpower humanity.

It's a fascinating glimpse into an era that rarely is explored in film.",1410134400,3,393,4.535211267605634
