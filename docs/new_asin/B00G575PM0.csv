6060962,4,B00G575PM0,"A WARNING TO ANYONE WHO IS CONSIDERING WATCHING THIS SERIES: when the producers made the third season of Deadwood, they did not know it was the last. Had they known, it would have been written very differently. But as it is, the story ends with much unresolved, and there is nothing resembling closure. Had I known this up front, I would not have followed the series as long as I did. Viewers who watched Deadwood as it was being broadcast did not have to face this issue. They could enjoy the show in ignorant bliss, not knowing they'd eventually be left hanging....  If you admire fine writing and great acting, you will not be disappointed. But if you require a story with a beginning, middle and end---then consider yourself warned.",1408752000,6,736,4.661538461538462
6060963,5,B00G575PM0,Fascinating show that is based off true events (obviously Hollywood-ized).  Very entertaining and good quality!,1406246400,13,111,6.4

6060966,5,B00G575PM0,I enjoyed Deadwood when it was on TV and was sorry to see it end. The acting is outstanding and based on historical fact. A show that you can certainly watch more than once. I still think of the fight scene was one of the best I have ever seen and worth watching the entire series just to see that.,1393027200,32,298,3.9833333333333334

6060969,5,B00G575PM0,"This is a great series. Even people that aren't huge western fans love it. It has something for everyone, male and female. Strong language but that's the way it was in that period. Also it has a lot of historic facts that are very interesting. I had 2 box sets. One was a gift and one I bought. Both burned in a fire so the first thing I replaced was this box set. Worth the money.",1390867200,37,381,4.026315789473684

6060978,5,B00G575PM0,"Best ""cowboy"" series ever. Stories track actual historic places and events. America was born from violence and what is now called ""The Darwinian Process"". If you weren't smart, the odds were against you making it.
This is an interesting time in our history.  Order and society formed around the strong. Even if they were ruthless or because of it. Awesome, and I think that word is overused, acting by the core cast especially Ian McShane is a bell of an actor. If you can find it, watch Lovejoy, it's another brilliant job by Ian.",1522108800,,531,4.648936170212766

6061008,1,B00G575PM0,"Beginning with the fourth episode of Season 1 (season 1, disc 1) the audio track is out of sync with the video track -- horrible. So there's about a 1/2 second delay between the actors speaking and the sound coming out of their mouths!  Making the show basically unwatchable.
Perhaps even worse, the entirety of the second disc of Season 1 is not playable at all -- some kind of glitch with the language selection frame; it just keeps looping and will not proceed to the episodes.  This indicates absolutely horrible quality control by whichever company has manufactured these discs.  Unfortunately, I didn't begin watching this until after a month had passed since the purchase, so per Amazon policy it is not refundable.  This is the worst experience I've ever had with an Amazon product.  HUGELY disappointing/frustrating since ""Deadwood"" is such an amazing HBO show.

The character he plays is despicable and always foul mouthed, so much so that it became a distraction. Hollywood always takes liberties with historical fact so if you have an interest in this period or in the history of Deadwood, do your research.

And I am a ""verified purchaser"" of the above set. Any grain that detracts and is attributed to poor transfer is misguided. The grain in certain scenes, and there is some grain, is inherent to the original production and cannot be removed. Blaming it on a cheap transfer is just wrong. I repeat these sets are identical.

6061075,5,B00G575PM0,"A fiercely intelligent, unique, and entertaining modern-style western focusing on community and social order. One of the best written series, the dialogue is witty and poetic, yet colourfully profane. Reminiscent of Shakespeare, with it's soliloquies and small talk among the memorable characters. The acting is superb, with Ian McShane a definite standout as Al Swearengen -one of my all time favourite TV roles. I'm not a huge fan of westerns,but really enjoyed this show,my only complaint is it was tragically cut short and not given a proper finale. This Blu-ray set comes with an impressive amount of extra features and a bonus disc full of fascinating history documentaries and interviews. Highly recommended for fans of Quentin Tarantino's westerns, HBO's Rome, and Boardwalk Empire.",1483833600,2,790,5.430894308943089

6061083,5,B00G575PM0,"Deadwood, visualized and created by David Milch (of NYPD Blue among others), was to my mind his greatest work. Over three seasons, an entire physical town was built, and an ongoing story line grew over the years, often referring back on itself, and growing in unexpected ways. And it was not just the writing that propelled the series to its unprecedented heights in the world of TV drama. The casting of very skillful actors and an experienced, professional crew, put it over the top. Everyone involved clearly believed and freely declared that Deadwood was the most exciting piece of work with which they had ever been associated. The complete set I am ordering now will be my second. The first box, I gave to a friend after watching it end-to-end several times; including all the bonus reels (which are definitely worth the time). Some people will be scared away by the relentlessly foul language. Oh, well. This was an outlaw town, folks. Just one more piece of real estate stolen back from the original inhabitants (the ""dirt worshipers"", as Al Swearengen would say), as soon as it was discovered that the Black Hills were riddled with gold. Life was cheap, death came easy and was seldom nice. An awards ceremony was held in L.A. during the period between seasons three and four, a video of which is included in the boxed set, and most of the cast were present. Every one of them was excited, as season four and the closing moments of the show approached. Then, for reasons undisclosed, HBO cancelled the series. Economics, I suppose. Production costs surely spiraled upward over the years. Something that beautiful doesn't come cheap.",1481328000,4,1641,4.843416370106762

But, I decided to revisit it after a while and found a wonderful and unique series with some of the best acting and writing on TV. The ""Cowboy Shakespeare"" inclinations of the writers, that was in plain view from the first season, really took off and became a main element of the show in the second season. Entire internal monologues and thoughts would blossom forth in lengthy obscenity laced rants and tirades, all delivered with brilliant pseudo Shakespearian eloquence and poetry. Amazing stuff for those viewers willing to get in the zone for it. The Special Edition set features a wide range of commentaries, special features, documentaries and photos. If you love the show this is a must have set for understanding the background, creation and production of this unique series. There's talk of a Deadwood movie to re-unite the cast and put a proper end to the story. Hope they bring it off. RECOMMENDED.",1468540800,16,1041,4.7569060773480665

6061165,3,B00G575PM0,I realize the unsettled frontier was a rough place so this is actually pretty realistic. A lot of brothel activity occurs and the language and violence are rampant. I ordered this because I thoroughly enjoy Timothy Olyphant's acting abilities and he hold true in this western. I'm not certain how authentic Deadwood actually is but for adults who enjoy a good western this is probably something they would thoroughly enjoy - I would have if it weren't impossible to ignore the rawness of this show.,1457308800,3,498,4.870588235294117

6061217,5,B00G575PM0,"One of the best series ever made. The acting is, indeed, outstanding, for the must part, but there are a few characters that are difficult, if not impossible, to stomach simply because they are written and/or acted so badly.

Timothy Oliphant is, without a doubt, THE most overrated actor in the history of Hollywood. He couldn't act his way out of a paper bag if his life depended on it, provided that not sucking ass was a prerequisite. Seth Bullock is the most wealky portrayed character of the lot, both due to Olyphant's inability to portray any kind of emotion the least bit believably and poor writing/direction.

Calamity Jane's character is another that is nearly impossible to watch, due mostly to bad writing & direction. The actress can certainly act, but is forced down a path that makes her character one of the most annoying and unpleasant portrayals I've ever endured. There have been multiple times  that I've had to ffwd through one of her scenes just to make it through an episode without giving up in disgust.

Al Swearengen, on the other hand, is in my opinion THE greatest portrayal of a character ever, in any movie or show. Absolutely stunning doesn't begin to describe the character, the way he is acted, or his dialog. He IS Deadwood.

Definitely worth the purchase though! I'll endure just about any level of suckage just to see what Al Swearengen has to say next.",1433894400,,1391,4.731404958677686

Let's face it it is the west in 1800's there is foul language. Aside from that the writing of this series is exceptional!!!!!!!!! The character development exceeded any expectations I had. You get attached to some of the characters. I LOVED Calamity Jane, she had some of the funniest and best parts in the series. Actress Robin Weigert was fantastic. I liked Mr. Wu, Joanie,Trixie and Ellsworth and little Sophia. I even liked Al Swearengen by the end of the series. My favorite segment in an episode was ""Unauthorized Cinnamon"". It was also fantastic to see Geri Jewell, her character took a beating and proved how strong she was. She also had some great lines. This was an incredible cast, excellent writing and I watched the entire series in 3 weeks time and now going thru withdrawl. I won't be eating pork for sometime,due to the pigs.

6061278,5,B00G575PM0,"When the producers made the third season of Deadwood, they did not know it would be the last. Otherwise, it would have been written very differently. As it is, the story ends arbitrarily. While I wasn't expecting closure or a tidy finish, I did expect an ending crafted by writers who knew the limitations they were working under. The conclusion, however, was a bit of a mess. If you admire fine writing and great acting, this probably won't matter. Or maybe it will. But either way, at least now you know where the story goes. Or doesn't go. Or... whatever.",1408752000,60,558,4.59

Even more recently I've watched it on Amazon Prime.  Yeah, I like it and my wife likes it.  So when I saw this set listed at a reasonable price, I jumped on it.  I specifically bought DVD so I could watch it in my trailer with my portable DVD player.",1530057600,,420,4.111111111111111
