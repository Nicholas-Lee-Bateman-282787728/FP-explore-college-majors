7223068,2,B00YJLAQS2,Interesting but  nowhere near LOTR!  I would watch it again,1465862400,,59,4.8

7223072,4,B00YJLAQS2,"After watching the first film and enjoying it I had to watch the 2nd. I was not disappointed. I then took the time to review the ""Making of"" and was impressed with the behind the scenes. I'm in anticipation for #3 and #4 to be released.  Good solid adventure story. I generally don't buy movies much anymore unless there is something ""Special"" about them.  I am officially a fan. I love supporting creative projects that turn into something memorable. I enjoy a good story and Mythica and their creators deliver!",1456272000,9,512,4.677777777777778
7223073,4,B00YJLAQS2,"The English title is ""Mythica- The Darkspore"", which isn't so much of a spore as it is a gem/rock. I didn't see the first film which introduced the characters (I did read a synopsis). There are numerous flashbacks. Marek (Melanie Stone) is the main character. She is an escaped club foot? slave who lead a group of adventures in the first film in an unsuccessful quest to save Caeryn (Natalie Devine) pronounced Karen. Caeyrn's sister Teela (Nicola Posener) is still a little peeved. She is the one with the red anime hair and painted on eyebrows.

There is a stone that gives power and was divided to the four corners of the earth. Szorlok (Matthew Mercer) wants the stone for his own evil intentions and uses the newly discovered necromancer powers of Marek in an attempt to gain the stone. The stone is in a lost city of the giants who were supposed to have hordes of gold. The party goes on a duel quest for treasure and a rock.  The party includes Daegan (Jake Stormoen) who is half elf, half human. He is lustful and says off colored things. He also loves his gold. Hammerhead (Christopher Robin Miller) is a mountain of a man. The final character in the quest is Qole (Rocky Myers) a cursed elf they meet along the way. There is dragon too.

There is also a subplot involving the selling of ownership of Marek which must carried over from the first film.

I liked the cinematography. Soundtrack was so-so. The characters were a bit dry and needed to level up on charisma. The film had some cute lines like:  ""If I get eaten by a pixie... Just tell them it was a dragon or something."" The theme is:  ""Evil runs in the blood of all men.""  or ""Trust the Goddess."" This is a $200 million dollar film made on a small budget and funded by ""Kickstarter."" It was a fun film, just don't expect Peter Jackson.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. A woman drops her robe to show off her naked body, but is camera shy.",1440806400,3,1910,4.40625
7223074,5,B00YJLAQS2,"The second is better than the first. A great magical fantasy movie with a strong heroine and her crew of warriors, thieves, and mystics on their journey to find the dark spore before evil does.",1495238400,2,193,4.542857142857143

7223078,5,B00YJLAQS2,"A second movie or sequel is often not as good as the first, but not so here, somehow they have kept up the momentum they started with. The characters continue to develop their personalities and are getting stronger (going up in level). The dragon is believable as are the orcs, The story is solid and keeps you interested. I especially liked the changes in venue.",1487980800,,363,4.6

7223084,4,B00YJLAQS2,"I just completed my review of the first of this series - MQH.  I don't have much else to add about the plot as other reviewers have done a detailed job of that.  I will say that I'm interested enough to continue buying all of the series as it becomes available.  Now that I've become well acquainted with the characters, I look forward to following them in their adventures - resist the darkness Marek!  Great fantasy fun.",1472601600,2,422,4.441558441558442

8718502,5,B00YJLAQS2,"This has become one of my favorite movies. It has it all-- great cast, great story, adventure, humor and romance. I love that it's produced by an independent film company too.

8718506,5,B00YJLAQS2,"Not all glitzy fantasy with fancy new polish and amazing special effects - but a solid entertaining series for those who appreciate a good effort. The actors are fun, fallible, and believable in their roles. The story line has a few twists that are not entirely predictable. The world is consistent.
If you are one of those people who pick apart every movie you see based on a some driving need for perfection in film - then this is probably not for you. On the other hand, if you are someone who just likes a good romp of an adventure, has a sense of humor, a vivid imagination, and can take some low budget imperfections in stride - then enjoy!

Note: I have watched all five movies in this series so my review is not based on The Darkspore as a stand alone film.",1510790400,5,765,4.3125
