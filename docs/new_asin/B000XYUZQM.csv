8230299,1,B000XYUZQM,The picture quality was not very clear...and the sound was off.  Would not recommend ordering this DVD.,1505779200,,103,5.0588235294117645
8230300,1,B000XYUZQM,"Beware of this DVD!  Despite the fact that the cover advertises this as Son Of The Blob, the print on this DVD is actually titled Beware!  The Blob!  Just like the previous 2000 DVD release by Image Entertainment.  And the print on this DVD is sub VHS quality.  The Image Entertainment DVD looks much better.  If you're going to get a copy of Beware!  The Blob! get the Image Entertainment 2000 DVD.  NOT this low quality release.

I bought this DVD because I'm looking for a print of Son Of The Blob, with the Son Of Blob title card on it.  I already owned TWO copies of Beware!  The Blob!  Given the fact that I've opened a movie and its cost, it wouldn't be cost effective to return it.  Even if it were possible, I'd still only get store credit most likely because I can't prove I didn't just copy it or watched it and didn't like it.  So, I'm warning people off of this low ball DVD effort.",1447891200,6,895,4.218934911242603
