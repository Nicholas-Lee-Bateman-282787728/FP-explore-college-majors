4229212,5,B003YGSLA8,"We have had this kit for a few months now, and my 9-month-old loves it! The DVD is a treasure - my very active baby will sit and watch the entire 30 minute show without moving, which gives me a nice break from trying to keep up with her crawling everywhere! I think the key is the music (she loves music) and the simple toys and images on the screen. Whatever it is, they might as well call it baby magic. I imagine it will eventually lose its appeal as she gets older, but for now, I couldn't be happier with this product!",1297123200,3,523,4.087378640776699
4229213,3,B003YGSLA8,"If you have Netflix, you have access to great educational children's programs for all ages.  I suggest you save your money and look elsewhere.  Otherwise, read reviews and buy just one at a time.  Don't make the mistake I did and buy a bunch of them.",1407628800,,250,4.391304347826087
4229214,4,B003YGSLA8,My 6-8 month old likes it.  The video plays nice Beethoven music with toys moving around on screen and various other images.  What my baby loves the most is the cartoon cut scene in between each chapter.  He laughs whenever he sees it.  More cartoon images like the cut scene between chapters would have been nice since my baby loves those.  The problem is there are just a few and they last like 2-3 seconds each time.,1396310400,,419,4.3896103896103895
4229215,4,B003YGSLA8,"I bought this video for my granddaughter who lives in another state. I haven't seen it in a while. So I am a little short on specifics.  But as I remember, it is very good, as are all Baby Einstein DVD's.  My favorite is the Baby Mozart, though.  So, if you must choose between the two, I would buy the Baby Mozart.",1393027200,,315,4.048387096774194
4229216,5,B003YGSLA8,my 4 month old loves this dvd even from 3 months. And it is a lifesaver whenever I'm feeling sick and just can't muster then energy to be his sole entertainer for the day and need that 29 minute break to breath.....,1391731200,,215,4.142857142857143

4229226,5,B003YGSLA8,My 12 weeks old daughter will sit and watch this educational dvd. She doesn't sit still for the whole movie yet but lasts about 12 minutes which I think is a long enough attention span. There are colorful lights and soft music throughout the whole movie.,1384128000,2,254,4.543478260869565

4229238,2,B003YGSLA8,"We live in the 21st century and so I suppose it's inevitable we'll show our children some television. But this Baby Beethoven DVD is exactly what I don't want my baby watching. The ""program"" (if it deserves that name) runs about thirty minutes, and it's a medley of cheaply recorded classical music segments, each of which lasts just a few minutes at most. The visuals that accompany the music are disconnected not only from the music but from each other. Essentially, it's a half hour of footage of out-of-fashion toys and simple animations, and set to bad music. If you want your baby to listen to Beethoven, I think you're better off buying an actual Beethoven CD. If you want your baby to listen to Beethoven *and* watch something at the same time, buy Fantasia.",1358121600,,766,4.681481481481481

4229244,5,B003YGSLA8,"All the Baby Einstein videos are amazing! Ever since our little one was born we have put these on in the mornings to get his little senses going and he is one of the most happiest babies I've ever known (not partial or anything :). He smiles at the skits in the shows and laughs at the funny parts and just watches so intently on the rest of the show like a little sponge absorbing it all.  He can't get enough!! Now at 1 year old he is extremely alert, understands so many words and is one of the best babies his daycare has.  He actually has an attention span where as many 1yr olds don't.  He can sit and play with a toy for a good 15 minutes and then find another one.  He is independent and is clearly expressive (not a tantrum thrower)about what he wants and understands interactions between himself and adults as well as other children.  He likes other videos and children's shows but Baby Einstein is the only one he watches like its going out of style.  The videos give mom or dad enough time to eat, get ready, or cook a quick dinner without little hands into everything and without the risk of commercials! I'd recomend just about any of the dvd's!!!",1346198400,,1161,4.302752293577981
4229245,5,B003YGSLA8,"My son has been watching Baby Beethoven since he was 3 months old. If he gets into a crying jag and I can't figure out what exactly he is crying about- I start Baby Beethoven and he seems perfectly happy. The music is also enjoyable for adults. I have the 29 minutes memorized after watching it a few times a week for 5 months now. Of course, it shouldn't be used as a baby sitter, but Baby Beethoven works great for play time. It's great to put on in the background while my son plays with other toys as well.",1327449600,,510,4.11
4229246,5,B003YGSLA8,"There is nothing i HAVE FOUND BETTER OR EVEN REMOTELY CLOSE 4 my little one(SON).He learns/watches/and now at 5 months even tries 2 talk back 2 them. I bought ALL the kits I can afford which is only 4 right now but I even buy cheapest T.P. so I can add 2 his Einstien Kits fund 4 the next 1. He gts so captivated like he's hypmotized. He's 5&1/2 months now and loves them just as much as when he was 1 month,If u r a single parent(mom) like me;or a regular parent w/2 of u and need some time to do dishes shower,ect the einstien KITS (CD/DVD/BOOKS/FLASH-CARDS)R the very best u can ever invest in;I could go on and on and would love to know about ALL future deals,AND I'll be telling EVERYONE on facebook also,These KITS give u and ur baby time together or u some time for urself if ur like me an r short on time,Im 32 and I would choose these KITS teach and make my only child(son) happy than I would a babysitter. To let u know just how much I believe in these(JUST LOOK AT THIS TIME I'VE TAKEN 2 WRITE THIS,I DON'T HAVE FREE TIME 2 DO THINGS LIKE THIS)I feel this strongly about these and feel other parents or single parents like me that don't have hardly any money or ones that do;Yet as 4 me I even keep my pennys so I can order more for my son Leo. To me $15.00 is a really lot bt Id work 3 jobs if thats what it took for my son to have these Einstien Kits 2 have fun with but NOT ONLY because there fun 4 him(and me);But they teach him alot as well,I have a woman who comes weekly from a program they offer 2 mothers/fathers who don't have the cash 2 pay for services like thiers and she tells me my son Leo is 2 to 3 months advanced;Its my opinion and NOT a proven fact but I believe these Einstien Kits(DVDS/CDS/BOOKS/FLASH-CARDS)have something/alot 2 do with y he is advancing so quickly;Plus of course ""TONS OF LOVE"" and ""YOU CANNOT SPOIL A BABY"" and that IS a proven FACT.This is how strongly I feel about theses Einstien Kits,STONGLY enough 2 take the time and write this cause I feel it needs 2 be known

4229247,5,B003YGSLA8,"My active infant requires constant attention, movement, and entertainment - and is already tough to keep enthralled. I hesitated to start with TV this early, but Baby Beethoven was a miracle for us. Even when baby is quite upset and restless, this DVD is riveting. Sure, you get sick of the songs and sounds, but baby doesn't. It's worth its weight in gold. Very highly recommended.",1310601600,2,382,4.803030303030303

4229250,5,B003YGSLA8,"I suppose the one problem with the Baby Einstein movies is that one can become too reliant on them to calm a fussy little one. These short, simple films are amazingly effective at calming down my daughter when I need to make dinner, take a shower, or otherwise be unavailable to watch her every move for a brief period (we simply put her in her Bumbo chair or exersaucer while she watches). I do wish that the CD had a few more songs; the DVD is about 30 minutes long, but the CD has only about 15 minutes of music. We have both the Baby Mozart and Baby Beethoven Discovery Kits; both are excellent.",1303776000,,599,4.2631578947368425

The whole time she is watching it she looks over at me as if to say, ""are you seeing how great this is?""  I admit, I fail to understand the plot, or even why she likes it so much, but what matters is that she loves it and clearly develops skill sets while watching and participating.
