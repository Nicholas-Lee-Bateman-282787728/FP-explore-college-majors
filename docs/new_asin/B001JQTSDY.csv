3659565,2,B001JQTSDY,"We LOVE Strawberry Shortcake! That being said, this video is very hard to watch! My daughter doesn't mind it, but she's too young to care just yet. I cannot STAND listening to it. The voices are shrill when they are in a conflict mode. They are trying to put together a good story with lessons, but my gosh....can we tone down the brattiness and screaming and horrible dialog to show conflict? The older Strawberry Shortcake videos are better at this than the newer ones are I'm noticing. I will have a very hard time buying anymore of the newer videos. Too bad, because we all really LOVE Strawberry and her friends.",1239580800,8,617,4.5675675675675675

Soon they are attacked by a flock of Murkrow, which ends with Pikachu flying through the air, bouncing over a group of Hoppip and Pikachu befriends the Pichu Brothers after this, and they show him around the city.
During their tour of the city, the trio roll off the top of a bus, into a river, are nearly run down by a ferry, and then are chases around the city by a Houndour. The Pichu Brothers finally show Pikachu their playground, but Pikachu tries to leave because he is supposed to meet Ash in an hour. Houndour catches sight of Pikachu and when trying to run him down ends up collapsing into a pile of tires. Despite having been aggressive to the trio before, they still help him get out of the mess of tires. Pikachu realizes it is running out of time so after they rebuild the wrecked parts of the playground, it gets into a tire and uses it to ride back to the building where pikachu says good-bye to the pichu bros and Ash is waiting. Pikachu returns to Ash who reminds him that it is the one-year anniversary of their meeting in Pallet Town, so they have a celebration party with lots of food and Pikachu gets to wear Ash's hat.",1343260800,,1282,4.323651452282157
