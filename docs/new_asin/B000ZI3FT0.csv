8235651,5,B000ZI3FT0,"I studied with Jeff Herda, a student of Harvey Kurland, when I lived in Spokane.  I moved back to Ohio in 1999 but, unfortunately, this form is not taught back here.  This DVD is an excellent review of Section 1.  I wish there were similar DVD's for Sections 2/3 and 4/5 and 6.",1527206400,,277,4.188679245283019
8235652,1,B000ZI3FT0,i didn't like this tai chi chuan at all,1407110400,,39,3.4444444444444446
8235653,5,B000ZI3FT0,I find these two DVDs very helpful in practicing Tai Chi at home.  I want to be sure I don' do the exercsies wrong because I want the maximum benefit.  I ordered them late on Thursday night after my class and they were in my mailbox Sat. afternoon.  Amazing service,1381104000,,265,4.26
8235654,1,B000ZI3FT0,Very poor quality. It looks like it was a VHS-DUB of some over-aged unfit man doing T'ai-Chi in a gym.,1371859200,,102,4.15
8235655,5,B000ZI3FT0,"As a companion to the first video, this DVD completes the first section of the Yang Dual Form. Possibly the only Tai chi Chaun form to be practiced on both sides, the Yang Dual Form balances the whole body. This is a great way to learn the movements on both sides of the body. Sifu Harvey Kurland is one of the best instructors and practioners of Tai Chi Chuan today. This is well worth the investment.",1196640000,2,402,4.302631578947368
