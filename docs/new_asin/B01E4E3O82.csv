8757600,1,B01E4E3O82,"I have a much older pilates machine that looks like the one pictured on the front cover, but when I played it Marjolein was using a newer model with the arm straps attached up on a pole and not down on the platform like mine.  Therefore, I am unable to do many of the exercises and I cannot buy the needed attachment because it will not fit my AeroPilates machine.  I love using my pilates, but I'm not sure where I'll go from here.  I can't just keep buying new machines very time they come up with new exercises.",1466812800,,514,4.171717171717172
