Movies & Candy synopsis:
This adolescent romantic comedy is set upon the beautiful Gulf Coast of Texas where five voluptuous babes and four lusty guys meet over Spring Break. All of them have a ball except the portly Pud. Despite his efforts to find good lovin', the women avoid him. He decides it's because he was shorted in the natural endowment department and so begins working to rectify the situation.

Thinkin' Big is a teen sex comedy that was directed by the great S.F. Brownrigg, I was curious to see how this would be since Brownrigg has done only horror flicks in the 70's, like Don't Look In the Basement aka The Forgotten (1973), Don't Hang Up aka Don't Open the Door (1974) and Keep My Grave Open (1976). Then he disappears only to resurface in 1986 with this sexploitation gem. It wasn't boring at all, it had some verybizarre but likable scenes. Oh! and there was boobs at least. Darla Ralsoton who plays Liz is as horny as the boys and has the goods to back it up.

Big boy Bruce Anderson is Pud and he's learning how to think big. Wong is the Oriental snowcone king with a 3 foot hooter. Which meant schlong in 1986.

The film was shot in Texas at South Padre Island during off peak season because the beaches are dead. This is basically the plot of this pointless movie. A bunch of college dudes and college women head to South Padre to get laid. Unfortunately no one else is there. Not many hilarious hijinx ensue but it still has tons of heart and the Thinkin' Big theme song is very catchy like Pud when he gets crabs. It grows on you like all good bad 1980's mind blowing movies.

Seeing Pug looking in dumpsters for ""p-ssy"" was so pathetic it put me in tears. And there is a Pud subplot where he gets jealous of his asian's friend ""Big"" penis and he tells Pud to ""Think Big"" so he can grow it. Much of the innuendo in this film is cute, clever and correct. We all want a bigger Johnson.

If this isn't exciting enough for you toss in another subplot where the girls meet a local crime kingpin and get involved with counterfeit cash. From then on it turns into an action/crime film involving Pud being the hero.

Favorite line ""Im gonna make myself a sandwich. Do you want one?"" ""Forget it, Im sick of peanut butter.""

The movie was not too good, it was cheap, corny, odd and it's very sloppy like I said but it's not boring at all, it's worth watching. Don't expect much and be rewarded like only the 1980's can.

This is a movie to put on in the background and just watch on rotation all day and visit Beach Bums Shop and swim in bad movie nostalgia heaven.",1461369600,,2632,4.335365853658536
8195851,5,B0009GVU36,"By and far the best 'worst' movie ever made.
The premise of a group of guys going down to Texas with a snow cone truck is only the beginning of this masterpiece.
There is action, drama and even some very catching songs.
Highly recommended. I only wish I could get it on DVD or in European format.",1305936000,,296,4.2105263157894735
