1196895,1,B000007PAG,"I purchased a DVD player today.. I was cruising around and spotted ""The Harrad Experiment"" on DVD.. Sorry to say this is the first DVD I've ever purchased!  I had read the book but was too young to see the movie when it came out in'73.  I thought this would be alot of fun to watch.. But they've managed to hack this DVD to bits.  Without seeing original, I could tell whole scenes were cut; language was censored... I don't understand why the DVD was even issued in this manner.. This is TERRIBLE!!  The DVD jacket should say ""censored!!!  What a rip!  If you can somehow find the original it might be alot of fun.. but this was a huge disappointment!",1020211200,11,652,4.347107438016529
1196896,1,B000007PAG,"Anyone expecting to see the original R-rated feature will be disappointed. This version on DVD has been gutted, and poorly at that.  The result is a choppy version that makes the poor acting even more noticable.  Save the money and donate it to your favorite charity.",1008892800,6,267,4.782608695652174
1196897,1,B000007PAG,I was looking for the real R rated version ..but the one i've got was the PG13 Version..that made me mad..cause all those R rated scenes were not in that movie and they have also cut it into a 50 minutes version or something..that was too bad...,1000080000,16,245,4.23404255319149
1196898,1,B000007PAG,"I saw the movie, The Harrad Experiment, a few years back on video, and I thought it was an interesting look on the relationship between men and women, controversial for its time and loaded with corny dialogue and bad acting.  I saw the DVD at a music store for 6 bucks and decided to buy it, not knowing that it was heavily cut and censored.
The actual film contains a fair amount of nudity, none of which is found in the DVD.  The scenes are either chopped out, or ""cleverly"" avoided.  There is even a scene where several people skinny-dip in the school pool, and it is obvious that there are little black bares covering their ""genital areas"".
I am one of those people who are strongly against censorship, when I saw the film ""Eyes Wide Shut"" in theatres, I did not know about the digital censoring that occured for the U.S. release, or I would not have even bothered to see it.  It's not to say that the nudity in either film progesses the plot any further, but it was not, however, the original vision of the director, something I think should be put into perspective when releasing any film.
Please do not buy this DVD, even if it is very inexpensive.",996883200,15,1155,4.408450704225352
1196899,1,B000007PAG,"The tape being offered is not the original R rated version, but the one shown on regular television.  All nudity and swear words are removed, making this film into a PG movie.  As far as I know the uncut version is not being sold anywhere.",983145600,10,239,4.288888888888889
1196900,3,B000007PAG,"The story is of a college experiment which tries to teach free love to a small group of students.  People who are too young to remember the sixties will be amazed that people could have been so vacuously naive as to believe  that all the world's problems could be solved by ""liberating""  ourselves from the tired old notions of monogamy and modesty.  The film  will also surprise those who think that there has been a continuous trend  of increasing flesh and sexuality in motion picture history.  The fact is  that no mainstream movie would be willing to put as much full frontal  nudity on the screen in the year 2000 as this movie did back in 1970 (or  thereabouts).  And actors of the stature of Whitmore and Hedren wouldn't  appear in a movie like this today, either.  Basically the movie was sincere  in its intentions, but utterly silly in retrospect.  And if you're offended  by nudity, steer clear of this one!",964310400,5,919,4.614906832298137
1196901,1,B000007PAG,"This rather cheesy movie seems to have been motivated by an incongruous combination of 1960's idiotic radical politics at their worst and a desire to show lots of footage of naked young people cavorting about.  Most of the  acting is unbearably sanctimonious, except for that of Hedren, which is  annoying, overblown, and unbearably sanctimonious.  Don Johnson and Bruno  Kirby must shudder at the mention of this film--and so do I!",942537600,5,432,5.114285714285714
1196902,3,B000007PAG,"As the author of the novel I wasn't consulted when I finally saw the film. Alas, it leaves off on the story about half way through--with lots of scenes and dialogue I never wrote--and the film never explores the group  marriage of Insix--too hot a subject for the1970's when it was made--AND  NOW!There is no Harrad yet--and the Harrad Idea is not outdated.  But the movie is fun to watch--and the swimming  pool scene a delight with Don Johnson and Laurie Walters--young, and  prettily naked. When the movie is run on network tv--the frontal nudity of  both Laurie and Don is eliminated- proving that even in the 1990's the  continuing sex revolution is not over. If the current owner of the video  rights would contact me, I'd be happy to put a few pool scenes on my  website  Anyway--if you are a film maker the time has come for a sequel.

1196915,4,B000007PAG,"It is an old movie.  Still, it does a good job of showing what the muddled thinking of academia, which started so much of the our disjointed family relations at this time such as high divorce rates, single mothers, children without fathers and so on.

1196918,3,B000007PAG,"This a movie with Don Johnson as a young adult (before he developed a body) and other characters we know and love at the last part of their adolescence in a college trying to do a social experiment at the beginning of the sexual revolution.  The concepts are good including the reforming of ""bad boy"" Don Johnson from a self-indulgent boy into the beginnings of emotionally mature manhood.",1389657600,,389,4.720588235294118
1196919,1,B000007PAG,"I watched this movie about 40 years ago and it was a very thought provoking, insightful, and entertaining movie. This reedited version has lost it original message, its insightfulness of the human condition, and its entertainment value.
This is a very disappointing version of its original screening!!!",1374969600,2,302,5.446808510638298

I saw the original release and there are nude scenes and audio censorship from the original. I noticed on IMDB that the original was 97 minutes, but there was a 91 minute UK release so this must be the UK release. I wish that the US release was available.",1346803200,17,368,4.197183098591549

1196926,2,B000007PAG,"This DVD edition from Echo Bridge Discs of the sexy 1970s classic, ""The Harrad Experiment"" is one to pass over in making a choice of which edition to acquire of this legendary film. (Another in a collection of three films, ""Classic 70s Movies"", however, would be a good choice for the sake of its surprisingly high quotient of the film's nudity.) Almost all issues of ""The Harrad Experiment"" on the various DVD and VHS releases of ""The Harrad Experiment"" have censored out, albeit to varying extent, far too much of the striking nudity of the film's actors (their frequent nakedness being essential ingredient to the movie's story and to the success of this film). Some of the actors were quite beautiful guys and gals and the film intended to show them in the full glory of their memorably naked youthfulness. In this case, even the DVD's front picture of Don Johnson is all wrong. Johnson in the photo (or drawing from one) is older, albeit still handsome, than he was at the time that ""The Harrad Experiment"" was filmed, when Don Johnson was the gorgeously androgynous teen (or ""twenty something""), sweetly lovely, ruby-lipped, and delectably smooth, with silkily wavy hair, of that time of his glamourous life. The other sexually coupled characters, and the actors who play them, are well suited, dressed or buck-naked, to their respective roles.

Regarding that irksome matter, of moments of nakedness having been excised from almost all of the commercial VHS and DVD editions of ""The Harrad Experiment"", which prevents the home viewer from seeing Don Johnson and the other actors in the most graphic full frontal nudity in the film, the Internet Movie Database (as accessed on 29. XII.2009) states that ""[t]he late-1980s Wizard Video version contains the film completely uncut and unedited. This is the only version like this known to exist on video."" Just try finding nowadays that elusive videotape (if you would like to undertake an exercise in frustration), on that label which so long ago went out-of-business!

The film, like the novel of the same title by Robert H. Rimmer, reflects the values of those years (1960s and early 1970s), when students yielded to the desires which youthful temptations stirred up in their loins and hearts. Alas, the results of those yearnings and of yielding to such longings through recklessly fornicating promiscuity, often led to tarnished and barren lives in later adulthood and to loneliness in the subsequent years of advancing age, but the novel, and the two films based on it (this one and its sequel, variously titled ""Harrad Summer"" or ""Love All Summer""), retain the glow of the youthful aspirations and of the sensual abandon of the so-called ""Sexual Revolution"" of those two decades. Two Amazon stars here for this edition of ""The Harrad Experiment"", since the film is just too unbeatably good (and quite touching), even so treacherously censored, to rate a single star in almost any edition, but, really, isn't it time to release widely an uncensored DVD edition of this classic?",1262476800,5,3035,4.996047430830039
1196927,2,B000007PAG,"Harrad Collge is where students go to experience sexual freedom, have roommates of the opposite sex, have co-ed classes in naked yoga, etc., etc., etc. The best thing about the movie is the college campus where the action takes place. It is quite inviting and lovely. On the other hand, the acting is amateurish, the cinemaphotography leaves much to be desired, much of the dialogue will make you laugh-- the four letter words are bleeped out to protect the viewer-- for all the wrong reasons. At the end of the movie someone sings something about ""it is not over,"" but the credits rolled; and thank goodness, it was over.

Nobody has a right to make such a bad movie.",1169683200,4,668,4.61344537815126
1196928,1,B000007PAG,"First, I must say - I would have liked to have been able to give this a zero star rating.

Second, this will teach me to read more of the reviews and to read them much more closely.

Third, I should have watched this DVD when it arrived, rather just doing a cursory check of the quality of the DVD: For if I had I too would have returned it for a refund.

This is to nothing more than a ""G rated"" (US television) release, replete with cut scenes and 'bleeped' speech. It is most definitely not the ""R rated"" version I was anticipating. European and Australian free to air networks would never, never mangle to such a degree a movie that was coming from such an innocuous base both in terms of language and nudity.

I can only surmise that from the time I placed my order in February 2004 til it shipped in August 2004 (a good reason not to combine orders to save on shipping costs) that an error was made as to which version I had ordered. Unfortunately, Amazon's returns policy doesn't seem to cover this type of problem - especially given the time that had expired between the DVD's arrival and my watching of it.",1098576000,9,1115,4.295238095238095

I saw the original movie several years ago and was impressed with the method the director addressed several issues. Unfortunately, the DVD version of this movie cut key parts of the movie which detract from its overall message. Very disappointed with Amazon's limited movie description.

Some of the deletions removed not only the nudity, but also important dialogue that occurred at the same time, so several scenes make no sense at all (even less than in the original, which wasn't quite Shakespeare to start).
I didn't even finish watching this version, but recently I found a bargain-bin DVD entitled ""Classic 70s Movies"" which included an uncut version of this film - nothing missing that I noticed!
