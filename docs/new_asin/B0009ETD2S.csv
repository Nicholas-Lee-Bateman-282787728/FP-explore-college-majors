Review by Nickolas Cook

 Ah!  The 80s.  A simpler time of cheesy horror, screaming bimbos, and budding horror stars.  And I'm here to tell you, FRIGHTMARE is a classic example of that wondrous period in horror cinema history.

Ferdy Mayne plays aged horror star Conrad Radzoff, once great, but now bitterly arrogant and a little evil...well, just evil enough to kill a couple of people who piss him off before he crocks in front of an auditorium full of fawning college film students.

Some of these said idolatrous students decide it'd be a great idea to break into old Conrad's Hollywood tomb and carry his corpse to his classic stomping grounds, an old mansion where his once great films had been shot.  Well, you know the story...the kids get a little tipsy, a little naked, and the next thing you know, old Conrad gets a little back-from-the-dead and starts killing them off one at a time, in some pretty nasty ways.

Yeah, pretty standard stuff...but wait...this is where the film really starts to get better than the average back from the dead revenge flick.

Like a bad dream, things get weird.  Fog rolls in from nowhere onto the set, the music gets dark and foreboding, and the scenes go from day to night, from one scene to the next.

Continuity errors, you say?

I don't think so.

This looks to have been done on purpose, and it really gives the movie a nightmarish quality that disorients the viewer.

The acting is much better than you'd expect from this kind of low budget, run-of-the-mill lot, including (little known at the time) Jeffrey Combs.  And the production values aren't glaringly bad.  At least the house remains spooky, and the lighting is consistent from scene to scene.

The worst part of the this film is the terribly ridiculous introduction by Lloyd Kaufman, the creator of the legendary Toxic Avenger and owner of Troma Studios, during which he makes some oblique attempt at humor as someone dubs in the names of the stars and director while he pretends to hold stuff in front of his mouth.  Having a little background on Kaufman's varied legal problems, I'm sure this was done more for a screw you to whomever got the short end from Troma in regards to FRIGHTMARE than for fun times.  But, hey, Debbie Rochen is around to brighten it up, so I can forgive it.

The quality of the DVD isn't great, folks.  So don't expect much from the tech end of this little seen gem of the 80s.  I mentioned the lighting and music, both of which work hard for the movie.  Unfortunately, Troma didn't work hard for them.  And that's a shame; because I'm sure it would've added an extra kick to FRIGHTMARE.

2283772,3,B0009ETD2S,"I remembered this film from when I was a kid. As I thought about it, I remembered it to be a super spooky film. When I found out it was on DVD I bought it with much anticipation. It really isn't that great, but still a little spooky. But I only watched it once before it was put away on the DVD shelf. Still it is good to have it on DVD. The opening Troma sequence is annoying as it gets though.

Look for the dude that played 'Porky's' and another dude that played in the Police Academy movies in this film.",1137283200,4,508,3.980392156862745
2283773,3,B0009ETD2S,"I'll agree with every reviewer before me who stated Troma's DVD transfer could be one of the worst ever. Bad picture and it's hard to hear anything. The movie is worth 4 stars the DVD is worth 0.

I wish Anchor Bay would pick up this little seen horror gem starring Ferdy Mayne as a beloved horror movie actor whose freshly deceased corpse is stolen from a morgue by a bunch of students. The students take the cadaver to a creepy old house where Ferdy made his most well known films. Soon the students are spooked by the spirit of Mayne.

Jeffrey Combs(""Re-Animator"", ""From Beyond"") stars in this great early 80's little known horror classic. Definitely worth an evening. Anchor Bay please pick this title up.",1130371200,3,709,4.619047619047619
2283774,4,B0009ETD2S,"It was quite refreshing, to see Jeffrey Combs,

in such an early career role, as a co-star,in

the movie, Frightmare. This is a very colorful

movie, and wonderfully macabre. It should

tickle the fancy of occultists everywhere. I

thought Conrad Ragzoff's mansion, was rather

gorey, and his memorial service very

imaginative. What a great idea! ""A Video

Funeral""

If you believe, that the dead, can come back,

for revenge, Frightmare, will remind you, to

treat them with more respect!",1130198400,5,490,5.075949367088608
2283775,3,B0009ETD2S,"AS A CHILD BACK IN THE 80'S I REMEMBER ON SATURDAY MY COUSIN AND I WOULD RENT 3-4 HORROR MOVIES FOR THE WEEKEND. FRIGHTMARE WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE HORROR MOVIES INCLUDING A HOST OF OTHER HORROR MOVIES THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD,EVIL DEAD, GALAXY OF TERROR, DAWN OF THE DEAD, AND SO ON. FRIGHTMARE IS ABOUT A HORROR ACTOR THAT DIED AND A BUNCH OF PUNKS STOLE HIS CORPSE FROM THE CEMETERY AS A PRANK. HE THEN TAKES REVENGE ON THE PUNK@$$ KIDS.

2283776,2,B0009ETD2S,"Excellent horror movie, but bad dvd. Troma blows, No effort. I wish anchor bay would have done this. The transfer is awful. tHE SOUND IS REALLY BAD. lOTS  of hiss. And no extras pertaining to the film. No trailer. Nothing.. I hope in future someone else will pick this one up and give it a better treatment..",1118448000,10,308,4.4035087719298245
2283777,4,B0009ETD2S,"Fairly competent early 80s flick, with a bunch of college students stealing the body of a recently deceased, legendary horror star, who somehow manages to come back to life and take bloody revenge on all of them.  The film has atmosphere aplenty and the creep/morbidity factor is fairly high - there's an early performance by Jeffrey Combs, but he has a secondary role and doesn't get to shine like he would in years to come in Re-Animator, Castle Freak and countless others.  After a long wait, I was thrilled to see this film finally being released on DVD, but I'm sorry to say that the transfer is quite poor, the picture is soft and hazy, looking exactly like an average-quality VHS tape, the contrast is washed out, later on this condition is reversed, and the dark areas in the image become much too dark, obliterating many visual details that are crucial to the story.  The soundtrack is the hissiest I've ever heard on a DVD, the level is so low, one has to crank up the volume to hear the muffled dialogue, thus raising the hiss to an unacceptable level.  This looks like a digital transfer from an analog video source, a very poor one.  For fans of the genre, even at this quality level, the film is highly recommended; for the casual viewer, the questionable quality of the disc may be too troubling to put up with.",1118016000,7,1326,4.554621848739496
8059612,4,B0009ETD2S,"Well, now. You'd think I would have seen this one before. But I didn't. as it happens. And I almost passed it up again until I noticed that Nita Talbot was in this, I've always thought she was a very delightful actress and lots of fun to watch, Probably great good fun to hang out with too, one got that vibe from her.
In her heyday she was all over television, Everything from COLUMBO to KOLCHAK, THE NIGHTSTALKER.
And Ferdy Mayne, of course,was the star of ebissen wird nur nachts - das Happening der Vampire
""It Happens that Vampires Only Bite At Night"" (more or less, my German is not that great) and, of course, THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS which also starred Sharon Tate (later murdered by the Manson Family).

There are some scenes from old Christopher Lee movies in this film but HE is not in this.
It's pretty enjoyable,actually. And a decent example of the saying ""Karma is a B""",1516320000,,888,4.481481481481482
8059613,4,B0009ETD2S,"Why do white folk always check out strange and unusual places and sounds alone? And what guy with any shred of dignity would let his girlfriend go search the basement by herself? WTH? Lol. Anyway, if you're into 80's horror schlock, you'll enjoy this one. Slightly cheesy and predictable (aren't they all?) but still fun. Just remember, hell isn't all that bad...you do meet the most interesting people.",1514937600,,403,4.9411764705882355
8059614,4,B0009ETD2S,"FRIGHTMARE (aka: HORROR STAR- 1983) is about aged, has-been horror icon, Conrad Radzoff (Ferdy Mayne), who, in addition to being quite a histrionic ham, is also a murderer! He's killed two directors during his career, including his oldest ""friend"". Radzoff dies, and is dressed in full vampire regalia for his funeral. Sealed in a mausoleum, his body is set for its eternal rest. Uh oh! That night, a group of Radzoff devotees decides to visit the old boy, in his place of final repose. Sooo, they break into the mausoleum, and, once inside, they choose to abscond w/ their favorite actor, and take him back to their college clubhouse for a little party. It's no surprise that, as the evening progresses, and the alcohol flows, these fans don't take very good care of Radzoff. In fact, they're downright rude and disrespectful! Meanwhile, police investigate the case of the missing corpse, and Radzoff's widow (Barbara Pilavin), along w/ her medium (Nita Talbot- SERIAL), raise Conrad from the dead! This comes as quite a shock to the young grave robbers, especially since Conrad is even more eeevil now, than when he was alive. Only one of them, named Meg (Jennifer Starrett), shows any remorse for what they've done. She actually sees something wrong in what they did. Soon, Radzoff begins picking off his own fan club, in gruesome fashion, one member at a time! FRIGHTMARE is a perfect example of 1980's supernatural horror cheeeze. Interestingly, this movie is somewhat similar thematically to CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS, which also had a disinterred, profaned corpse. Both films feature the dead being raised through supernatural means. Both have a group of defilers who get their just deserts. FRIGHTMARE is nowhere near as scary as CHILDREN, but it is more fun! The finale is to die for! Unless, of course, you're already dead! A wonderfully gooey, Halloween confection. It co-stars a young Jeffrey Combs (RE-ANIMATOR, FROM BEYOND, CASTLE FREAK, THE FRIGHTENERS) as Stu. Recommended for the fear fanatic...",1508803200,3,2027,5.07185628742515

8059619,3,B0009ETD2S,"As a fan of 80s horror films im surprised I had never heard of this one. But then again, discovering new horror films is part of the fun for me. That said, its not a bad little film at all. Certainly fun to watch & I don't regret my time with it. Its also one of Jeffrey Combs earlier works. Basic plot is an old horror movie actor (who looks like he may be inspired by Christopher Lee a bit but may also be inspired by Bela Lugosi) kills people, he himself dies then comes back to life to kill people again, this time for disturbing his grave. Now, some of the kills may seem a bit silly, like when he looked at a girl & she burst into flams. The reason this may be a bit silly is it isn't ever explained why he can do things like that but not overthinking it will make the film more enjoyable. The effects range from good to very good, not much blood or gore but whats there is effective with the best one happening near the end. The film looks good & some of the lighting in a few scenes is excellent. Extras include commentaries, trailer, interviews & a gallery. If you like 80s horror films & are just looking for something a bit different to kill time give Frightmare a chance.",1449360000,3,1183,4.125541125541125
8059620,4,B0009ETD2S,"I have to say, the first time I saw this movie, I was hooked on it. It has an element of being creepy in that house with the ""stolen corpse"" of the late actor up in the attic. The widow of the actor and her live in help, maid, whatever you want to call her, try and contact him through his prism and a sance. They somehow succeed bringing him back from the flame of Hell to once again, live in his body. He's not in the mood for partying since he realizes now he is not in his crypt! He yells out up in the attic, while the punks of the motion picture fan club of his, are below getting ready for the nights sleepover. They realize something is not right and go into attic. They find the corpse still laying in his coffin, convince themselves that the ""dead"" stay dead and don't come back to life, ever. With that, they all bed down for the night, but Ragszoff will not stay in his coffin!
He embarks on getting out of his coffin with powers from beyond the grave, and haunts the group of fans. One by one, they fall victim to his evil ""mind powers"".
It's a good movie from the early days of horror in the 1980s. I have to say, I grew up in that period, the '70s and '80s and they have some of the best horror movies made. Today, well, I can't say such a thing. There are a few gems like ""The Descent"" and ""The Grudge"".

This DVD is not that great as far as the release goes. It's okay, but could have been better. The audio is lousy with alot of hiss. When you turn up the volume to hear the actors talking, that is where you get the audio noise hiss. The movie itself is good, so hopefully one day we will have a good distributor of this little horror movie from the early '80s. Come on SHOUT Factory or Anchor Bay! Some special features about the movie itself would have been wonderful as well, like an audio commentary track from the director and some or all of the actors? No theatrical trailer here from the movie itself.
