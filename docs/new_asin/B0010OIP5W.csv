8238118,1,B0010OIP5W,"Possibly the most sleep-inducing movie made from a book ever made. The book was very good, The movie had a cheap and uninteresting look to it. Made as a television mini-series, the movie highlights much of the side story (character-building stuff in the book, cardboard sentiment in the movie) to the detriment of the main story. The result is very boring.",1215129600,2,356,4.852459016393443
