8272747,5,B001993Y5Y,"I have been watching season one and thinking ""Hey I really like this bird"". Baretta's ""friend to the end"". I like the show because it is a chance to see the many talented guest stars (most of whom didn't know the bird) that were cast in each episode. My favorite episode is the one with Gary Busey and Strother Martin as the bad guys and Mackenzie Phillips playing the girl gone wrong. Baretta somehow fixes the whole mess.",1346284800,4,423,4.435897435897436
8272748,5,B001993Y5Y,"Baretta is one of the greatest cop shows ever. I've got season 1 and have been waiting forever for season 2 -- and the rest of the series -- to come out on dvd. My money is ready to be spent, let's get them out on the market!",1342224000,6,225,3.7083333333333335
8272749,5,B001993Y5Y,"Baretta was a genuine tv classic from the 70's.  Why has only one season been released?  Given all the other DVD releases, how can this classic series be ignored?  Please give us all four seasons.",1334707200,7,196,4.542857142857143
8272750,4,B001993Y5Y,What is taking so long. I grew up watching this show and I am still waiting for them to release season 2. UGH! All these older series should be easy to release. But it seems they just wet our appetite with one season and stop. I wanted the complete series.,1214438400,29,256,4.14
