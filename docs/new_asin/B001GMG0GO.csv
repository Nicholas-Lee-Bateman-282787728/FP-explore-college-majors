8306164,5,B001GMG0GO,"Just to be clear, I was searching through Amazon to find David Gilmour Live 1984 at The Hammersmith Odeon and to see if it was on DVD, so far not available and only 1 review. Well anyway as a huge Pink Floyd fan I used to have the VHS version back in the 1990's and is a must for David Gilmour fans. Most of the songs he plays are from his About Face album and also There's no way out of here from his first album. He plays 2 Pink Floyd song's, Run Like Hell and Comfortably Numb with Nick Mason sitting in on drums.
  This was before The Momentary Lapse of Reason tour when DG was still trying his best to make it solo. Familiar Faces are Mick Ralphs (Bad Company) on Guitar, and Chris Slade (AC/DC and more). There is also a 45 minute documentary called ""After the Floyd"" on The VHS. I have know idea about The DVD, just wanted to let everyone know that the VHS version is good, Hope This Helps.",1390348800,2,897,4.090909090909091
8306165,2,B001GMG0GO,"I recorded this on my Sony beta-max system (remember them?) way back when it was on MTV.  I don't remember the picture quality being so bad in the video.  Spend your money instead on the ""Live at Pompei"" DVD - that's much better",1296864000,3,228,4.27906976744186
