8258189,5,B000QRIJX2,"Dolphins are huge tourist attractions in marine parks, petting zoos, swim-with programs, etc.  At the shows, they appear to be enjoying themselves, given their natural playfulness and a permanently-affixed smile.  But hidden within the industry that brings people so close to dolphins is a horrid truth about what happens to some dolphins in captivity.

This story skims the surface of that truth, which is far deeper than shown in the special, which is roughly 15 minutes long.  ABC, as usual, does a very good job covering the story.  You'll see famous dolphin activist Ric O'Barry speak regarding the dolphin industry.

One highly recommended DVD you can buy on Amazon that unravels the truth about the dolphin industry is ""The Dolphin Defender"" by Hardy Jones.

20/20 Dolphins is a well-composed story, and The Dolphin Defender is more of a full-length (45-minute) telling of dolphin experiences and the captivity industry.",1187136000,,927,5.222972972972973
