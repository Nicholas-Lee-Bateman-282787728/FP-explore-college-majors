8143626,4,B000I2JSXA,"The perfect life promised by Cisqua and Arc Aile has been destroyed because (it was always a lie anyway) after an assassination attempt on Cou's life. Seeing him wounded proves too much for Ren and she decides to strike out on her own to keep him from getting hurt again. Of course, when Cou recovers, he's hot on her tracks because he loves her. The sad thing is that she loves him too, but she thinks that everyone will stop trying to eliminate him if they are apart. Soon after Cou begins looking for Ren, Cisqua is able to convince a higher up in Arc Aile, who also happens to be her friend, to allow her, Rowen, and Kuea to join the search for Ren under the disguise of an extended vacation trip. Hopefully, they'll catch up to Cou before he runs into Wolx, the Edel Raid bounty hunter who sports a cute but powerful Edel Raid of his own.

The episodes on this volume were a little disjointed and haphazard since they had to split time between Ren, Cou, and Cisqua's group. I'm much more used to seeing them all together and one storyline. The writing was a little weak compared to previous volumes, bordering on the cliched, but was rescued by giving a darker edge to the Arc Aile organization, who in my mind are the main bad guys in the show so far. It hasn't really been revealed what their real intentions are. Ren gains a little more machismo in these episodes and we get to see the deepening bond between her and Cou as he strives so hard to rejoin her. Cisqua and the others also prove their mettle by going after the two, not to capture them, but to help them, even though this goes against the wishes of their superiors. This is a really good show.",1168560000,,1663,4.330128205128205
