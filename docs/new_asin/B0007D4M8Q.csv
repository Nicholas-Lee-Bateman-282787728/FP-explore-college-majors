8046870,2,B0007D4M8Q,"Hello Kitty & Friends: Basket of Fun is the seventh and final volume of DVDs released for Hello Kitty & Friends.  This disc features four Hello Kitty stories, and one Keroppi short; however, all the stories that appear on this disc appeared on previously released volumes.  Also, the stories are not listed on the back of the box in the order they appear on the disc.  On the back of the box, it lists the following order: ""Snow White,"" ""The Circus Comes to Town,"" ""Alice in Wonderland,"" ""The Wonderful Sisters,"" and ""The Big Adventure.""  The actual sequence is: ""The Wonderful Sisters,"" ""The Circus Comes to Town,"" ""Alice in Wonderland,"" ""Snow White,"" and ""The Big Adventure.""  Like all the other Hello Kitty & Friends DVDs, this was a ""low frills"" DVD.  The only special feature on the disc is the DVD credits.

""The Wonderful Sisters"" already appeared on volume four, ""The Circus Comes to Town"" already appeared on volume two, ""Alice in Wonderland"" already appeared on volume three, ""Snow White"" already appeared on volume one, and ""The Big Adventure"" already appeared on volume four.  With volume seven being the final volume for Hello Kitty & Friends, I wonder why it was even released at all.  With all the stories being recycled from other volumes, there just seems to be no reason for ADV Films to have issued this DVD.

While Hello Kitty is a very child-friendly anime, I have a hard time recommending this particular DVD.  If you already own the first six volumes of Hello Kitty & Friends, then this disc is just a waste of your time and money, since you already own everything that's included on this release.  I could probably recommend renting this DVD, but only if you haven't already seen all the stories included on the DVD.

If you have a young child at home, and are looking for kid-friendly anime, then I would highly recommend the Hello Kitty & Friends DVDs.  However, I would recommend watching the first six volumes, and skipping over this volume entirely.  If you decide to watch Hello Kitty with your young child, be prepared for boys to have less interest in it than girls.",1230681600,5,2098,4.725274725274725
