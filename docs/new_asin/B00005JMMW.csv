1515106,5,B00005JMMW,"I first saw this film in 1967, and I remember it as if I just stepped out of the theater.  Great films affect us this way and this is a great film.  The camera work and the pacing will remind you of Kurosawa and Kubrick, and that in turn will remind you how much these great film makers owe to Welles.  Each scene is perfect.  The actors don't act, they breathe the life that is in their characters.  When Welles swaggers as Falstaff, you believe Falstaff and love him and trust him and distrust him.  When he is rejected by Hal at the end of the film, you feel that all the world's sorrow is embedded in Falstaff, this dying old man.

Really, this film finally is as great as Citizen Kane, and perhaps even a little greater because what Welles does here more successfully than he did in Kane is that he is not afraid to show us what happens when a human heart reaches beyond itself and fails to touch another human heart.  In Kane, Welles could imagine that tragedy but here in Chimes at Midnight he lives it.",1131667200,108,1010,4.2513089005235605
1515107,5,B00005JMMW,"I first read about CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT in a contemporary review in TIME magazine, which gave it a glowing notice; odd for TIME which had previously massacred each one of Welles' films, picking them apart for their perceived shortcomings and failing to register their beauties.  Sometimes you can't see the forest for the trees, but by 1966 the air had cleared a bit and the anonymous reviewer gave it four stars, finally acknowledging Welles' enduring contribution to world cinema.  When I went to see the movie the theater was packed, not only with film fans, but with Shakespeare fans as well, all of us wondering how Welles managed to jam in three of Shakespeare's plays into one scenario.

The movie was filmed over time, so there are some gaps in continuity, though the time was not as long as that spent filming the unfinished DON QUIXOTE project.  Welles must have had John Gielgud for ninety minutes, you can tell all his scenes were filmed on the same day.  Nevertheless Gielgud gives a great performance, the equal to any of his Shakespearean film roles (too bad he never committed his Romeo to celluloid) as Henry the Fourth.  Gus Van Sant might have used Gielgud when he made his post-modern version of the same material in MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO, he could have played Keanu Reeves' disapproving dad just as well as the guy who did so.

Jeanne Moreau is arresting as Doll Tearsheet, the tavern wench who serves as a sort of Miss Kitty romance for the aging Falstaff.  She has a luminous beauty, extremely thin, Kate Moss thin, so sometimes it almost seems as though you can see the wallpaper behind her back.  It is rumored that Welles considered Eartha Kitt for the part; Welles and Kitt had worked together on stage ten years before, and he remained fond of the demanding, fiery singer and actress.  Accompanying Moreau is Margaret Rutherford, Miss Marple in the movies, reminding us once again what an exquisite actress she could be when reined in.  Marina Vlady, an icon of the French nouvelle vague due to her leading role in Godard's TWO OR THREE THINGS I KNOW ABOUT HER, is Lady Percy, who deplores Harry's switch from loving her to loving war more.  ""Tell me sweet lord, what it is that takes from thee thy stomach, pleasure and thy golden sleep?  Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth, and sit so often when thou sit'st alone?""  Vlady brings a sexy confidence to Kate Percy that makes Keith Baxter's diffidence almost a crime against nature.

Only in his late forties when he filmed CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT, Welles appears much older, and properly subdued when he has to be.  Gone are the accidental grotesqueries that make watching him in OTHELLO or MACBETH sort of wince-making.  Falstaff is an adult performance in every sense of the word.  The big battle scenes are famous indeed, conveying a devastating impression of the horrors of war, and yet some of its humanity as well, all on what appears to be a twenty-five dollar budget, due to clever use of montage and a rousing musical score.  The movie has its lapses, but here's hoping that one of these days the Welles estate will get off its ass and release his late films in restored versions, or indeed, any which way it can.  Until then you'll have to take my word for it.",1125964800,22,3250,4.648601398601398
1515108,5,B00005JMMW,"What a shame it is that Orson Welles' ""Chimes at Midnight"" isn't currently available on DVD. I was extremely fortunate to receive a VHS version as a gift before the usual legal wrangling over Welles' later works forced it out of print. According to wellesnet.com, a Spanish DVD is available, and there are plans to re-release it in the US, hopefully sometime after October 2004. Enter your email address in the ""E-mail me when available"" field on this site; you'll also be ""voting"" for the DVD's release!

 (Since the film is currently unavailable in the United States, the following review is based on film screenings and the VHS copy I have. I'll update my review if and when the DVD is released in the US).

 ""Chimes at Midnight"" is one of the great Shakespearean adaptations and a true 'lost classic'. It's also the last masterpiece that Orson Welles directed in his lifetime, and with 'Citizen Kane,' 'Magnificent Ambersons' and 'Touch of Evil' comprises a quartet of major cinematic works by Welles. Though rarely seen, ""Chimes at Midnight"" has influenced modern filmmakers. Mel Gibson, for example, admitted the famous ""Battle of Shrewesbury"" scene influenced his own ""Braveheart.""

 The film is an inventive re-editing and condensation of Shakespeare's plays, spanning from the end of Richard II to the beginning of Henry V. The film shifts the focus from the titular English kings to the character of Jack Falstaff, played by Welles himself in a virtuoso performance. Falstaff's relationship with young Prince Hal (later Henry V) is explored, and uncannily parallels Welles' own experiences with the young talents of Hollywood.

 There are several great performances, by John Gielgud as Henry IV, Keith Baxter as Hal, Kenneth Branagh look-alike Norman Rodway as Hotspur, Welles regular Jeanne Moreau as Doll Tearsheet, and the great Dame Margaret Rutherford (of ""Miss Marple"" fame) as Mistress Quickly.

 ""Chimes at Midnight"" can be a jarring experience due to inconsistent film quality, low budget sets and Welles' flair for shock cuts. Once you adapt to the style and limitations, it's a truly rewarding experience. Welles has found a deeply moving story between the lines of Shakespeare's histories.

 ""Chimes at Midnight"" was Welles' final attempt to popularize Shakespeare for the masses. With any luck, this film will eventually reach the wider audiences that Welles failed to achieve in his lifetime.",1091577600,64,2416,5.182519280205655

But Chimes at Midnight - and this Criterion Blu-Ray restoration is absolutely gorgeous - changed my mind. This is independent Welles at the top of his form. No studio could have made this film. It is a finely crafted work of art from the first frame to the last. The cinematography and editing are pure cinema and the actors! This is not only a tour de force for Welles as Falstaff but Jeanne Moreau, Margaret Rutherford and Sir John Gielgud all get meaty parts. Criterion has included some weighty additional commentaries, including one from Beatrice Welles, Orson's daughter, who also appears in the film as Falstaff's page boy. There is also an interview with Welles in the editing room working on Chimes at Midnight, originally seen on The Merv Griffin Show in 1965. I watched this film three times in three days when I first got it - like a great book you just can't put down. A must have for Welles' fans!",1492128000,6,1032,4.583783783783784

While less popular than Welles' other works, it is just as great and as technically accomplished as his best. I was particularly impressed by the battle between Henry V and Hotspur's forces, which is just as exciting as any battle in the latest season of Game of Thrones. You can definitely see why Falstaff appealed so much to Welles because the character's relationship to the monarchy closely resembles Welles' soured relationship with Hollywood. While the film's swooping camerawork and editing wizardry call too much attention to themselves from time to time and the Shakespearean dialogue is sometimes dense, Prince Hal's journey is still a joy to follow and its conclusion packs a wallop.",1487289600,2,912,5.210884353741497

1515533,5,B00005JMMW,"At last: ""We HAVE heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow.""

Long before film school, the first I'd read of Dear Orson's late masterpiece, ""Chimes at Midnight,"" an achievement many believe nears that of his singular masterpiece Kane, (although, I confess I am an Amberson-man at heart, butchered studio-ending and all, for that first hour and 15 minutes is sheer cinematic ecstasy, in excelsis, world without end), I read a Film Comment reviewer with no shortage of hyperbole state that Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"" rivaled Chimes AND Chaplin's ""City Lights"" as the best piece of direction an actor has ever achieved of himself.

While indeed Mr. Eastwood looked quite lost in the role of William Munny, especially as that sole glint shines in his alcoholic eye, as he finishes Gene Hackman's (how we miss you) equally nefarious Sheriff Bob in the film's climax, I must admit rarely has even a showman such as Welles, so vane as a young ingenue with his perfectly crafted nose in Kane, allowed himself to look so much a dejected piece of the scenery, as he does as the brilliant rejected force of nature that roving libertine and man of pure appetite Falstaff. But the VHS copies going around in those ancient days were so marred with sound problems (even the visual plane devolved into so much snow) much of the film's brilliance was lost to the ages.

Not anymore. Enjoy. The titles comes from:

FALSTAFF
We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow.

SHALLOW
That we have, that we have, that we have; in faith,
Sir John, we have: our watch-word was 'Hem boys!'
Come, let's to dinner; come, let's to dinner:
Jesus, the days that we have seen! Come, come.",1485907200,4,1670,4.804878048780488
1515534,5,B00005JMMW,"Let me start by saying I'm not keen on Citizen Kane, which is a shame because its legendary status left me thinking Orson Welles was an interesting but sort of dull guy. That opinion began to crack a year or so ago when PBS did a documentary on Welles' famous War of the Worlds broadcast, and I have been slowly becoming a fan of this talented actor, director, and writer ever since.

Chimes at Midnight is, as many have said, Welles at his best. The man was born to play Falstaff, the dissolute noble who weaves in and out of several of the Henry plays, and his reworking of Shakespeare to create a unique story for Falstaff is done with keen insight  and a lively sense of humor. The rest of the cast (John Gielgud , Jeanne Moreau,  Margaret Rutherford) turn in 5-star performances, but it is the handsome and engaging  Keith Baxter who brings the film to life. His journey from young prince with nothing to do except fight a war once in a while and wait for his father to die to King of England become the perfect foil for Falstaff's eternal failure and lack of recognition.

The film is shot in black and white. Often in the 50s and 60s this is shorthand for a sloppy, stagy production, but Chimes of Midnight is breathtakingly beautiful. The battle scenes, a bit long and clearly on a budget, nevertheless convey a true sense of the brutal, unrelenting nature of war. The streaming version (apparently Criterion although it's a bit hard to tell) had excellent audio.

Ultimately, it's not the exalted cast, beautiful cinematography, or even the talented adaptation of Shakespeare that make this a great film, but the sense of life and excitement Welles breathes into the story. A fine, fun, and ultimately satisfying tale.",1485302400,6,1727,4.627450980392157

A good sherris-sack hath a two-fold operation in it.  It ascends me into the brain; dries me there all the foolish and dull and cruddy vapors which environ it; makes it apprehensive, quick, forgetive, full of nimble, fiery, and delectable shapes; which delivered oer to the voice,-- the tongue,-- which is the birth, becomes excellent wit.

The second property of your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood.  The sherris warms it and makes it course from the inwards to the parts extreme

If I had a thousand sons, the first human principle I would teach them would be thisto forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack!

The above comes from this truly timeless movie written and directed by Orson Welles (1915 to 1985).  The language spoken in the movie is Elizabethan English.

It is adapted, from plays of William Shakespeare (1564 to 1616), four histories and one comedy:

(1) King Henry the Fourth Part 1 (circa 1597), provides the movies structure
(2) King Henry the Fourth Part 2 (circa 1597), provides this movies scenes (principle source)
(3) King Henry the Fifth (circa 1598), provides some lines in the movie
(4) King Richard the Second (circa 1594), provides some lines
(5) The Merry Wives of Windsor (circa 1597), provides some lines

The actual title of this movie as indicated in the opening credits is Falstaff (Chimes at Midnight).  The phrase chimes at midnight is found in the play Henry the Fourth, Part 2 Act 3 Scene 2.

Actually, I can think of other titles for this movie such as The Life and Death of Falstaff or The Betrayal of Friendship.

Just who is Falstaff?  He is, perhaps, Shakespeares greatest comic creation.  He is the irresponsible and merry, very fat companion of the Kings son, Henry, Prince of Wales (popularly known as Prince Hal), some fifty, an amazing bundle of contrasts, a liar without malice, a lover of wine, women, and song, a fool and a jester, who requires two and twenty yards of satin for a suit.

It was Welles lifes ambition to play Falstaff and he does an admirable job of playing him in this movie (hence the title of this review).  All the other actors are wonderful in their roles.

I liked the background music.  It captured the spirit of Falstaff.

Look for an amazing battle scene, roughly at the half-way point in this movie.  It lasts for about seven minutes and is unforgettable.

Criterion has cleaned up this movie so that there are no blemishes or other artifacts.  The sound is excellent.  This movie may actually be better visually and acoustically than when it was first released!!

Finally, the DVD set itself (released in 2016) has seven extras, all worth watching.  There is also a paper insert.  It is a comprehensive essay on this movie written by a film scholar.

In conclusion, if you want to know about the life and times of Shakespeares greatest comic creation, then this is the movie to see and cherish!!!

Lately (within the past couple of years), however, instead of always including a standard booklet of notes about the films--one that you read like an ordinary book by turning the pages--the CC has began to put their notes on the back of a poster that requires completely opening up to its full size and makes you read it like it some kind old-timey proclamation.  This is beyond annoying. And what's even worse is the ""art"" for these posters is done by whatever in-house ""artists"" are employed by Criterion, and to call these scrawlings ""art"" is an insult to all the real artists in the world who actually produce works worthy of hanging on a wall.

And that's another thing...even if these poster-booklets DID have something on the poster side that people thought was good enough to ""hang"" on their wall or otherwise display (for me personally, it would be the theatrical one-sheet used for the original release of the film), how many film purists who buy Criterions are going to devalue the collectability of their item by tacking a poster to their walls? Yes, maybe some, but I think they'd be in the minortiy as I would bet most Criterion collectors keep their cherised titles in pristine condition.

Criterion--STOP with these stupid posters on the back of the notes immediately!

And, yes, I am reviewing the PRODUCT not the film itself (which I consider great, btw). I'm not one of these AMZ dime-store Eberts who needs to blather about how much I loved or hated a film.  That information can be found elsewhere on countless sites on the net.

1515673,5,B00005JMMW,"""CHIMES.."" is up there with the other Welles' masterpieces. ""Citizen Kane"", ""Touch of Evil"", ""Othello"", ""MacBeth"", and the one where he directed the director {so the story goes), ""Jane Eyre"". ""Chimes"" is the show case for Welles the actor: as Falstaff, he gives the definitive performance of Shakespeare's rascal. And as a director/editor he proves that he is one the greats: note the Battle sequence and the scenes in the tavern . The Blu-ray transfer is very good, but the sound still leaves much to be desired as at time it fades. Overall, I am delighted with the disc and would recommend it to any lover of the cinema.

1515675,5,B00005JMMW,"Orson Welles appears in this film larger than ever (ironically, according to the IMDb trivia, he had to slim down to play the role - perhaps there was extra padding, one can only assume). He has the build of a boulder, and the face of the character Hagrid from Harry Potter aged in his 70's. Welles was in his late 40's, turning 50, by the time he took on the role of Sir John ""Jack"" Falstaff, the man who held his own court and council during the years of Henry the IV, but was sort of an outsider. He was a fool, a liar, a sweet guy who could get the attention of men and woman far and wide - from stutterers to the likes of women played by Jeanne Moreau - and yet he was never really 'apart' of the kingdom, that stuffy place where Henry (as played by a platitudinal John Gielgud) is in ill-health from the beginning of this story - even as he, along with his son the Prince Hal (later Henry the Fifth) - controlled the kingdom from outside invading influences.

I saw the film with someone who didn't really get what many of the characters want or any dimensions to them (outside of Falstaff, who is a force of nature). I can understand it. It's hard to get a handle at times on this story or even some of these characters; some of that, frankly, we can put on the Shakespeare dialog, which is beautiful and beguiling and deep and existential and poetic and, in 21st century times, slippery almost. But for me, the emotional component was always there, and Welles was a Mega-Master of Shakespeare even back in the 1930's (re his productions of Macbeth, Julius Caesar, even the rough draft of this film, Five Kings). So by the time he got to this, rough-hewed as it is, Chimes at Midnight is like his Final Dissertation as a master filmmaker.

Can I just take a moment out to talk how great Welles is here? He commands every second on screen. It can be said he hams it up. Can you blame him really, if it falls into that? I read more depth though in nearly every scene; even in those where Jack Falstaff hears people mock him, he takes it in stride, and can give it as good, or better, than he takes. His tongue is so sharp, and his reactions so BIG, that it's easy to read this as campy. But it's a deeply felt performance, with Welles swallowing this character into his solar plexus. He never plays Falstaff as being as regal as, say, Henry IV, or as Hotspur Percy, who is like many a Game of Thrones character (to put it in modern parlance) who just wants that friggin crown and wants it all his own.

I think the characters know what they want, or are trying to figure it out far as it goes. If there can be a legitimate criticism it's that Baxter, as Hal/young Henry V, is kind of the weak link among the cast. Albeit this is a cast with Welles, Moreau, Gielgud, Fernando Rey in a small but commanding role as another warrior. But he takes up a lot of screen time, and is best when having to do fierce reaction or passive poise - enjoying the company of Falstaff he's fine but but totally convincing. No matter - when someone like Welles or someone like Gielgud or Rodway as Percy or Rutherford as the Mistress mining the place Falstaff calls his court... it makes the journey much more entertaining. When you have a Shakespeare adaptation, especially one as ambitious and wild as this one, you got to have a cast that can pull out the emotional connections. They're here.

And if Welles really pulls out all the stops with his acting - it may even be his dare I say most towering, monolithic work as an actor, with the range going from bawdy comedy and sweet kindness to shattered tragic tones and bewilderment and shock, everything is there - the filmmaking reaches up to it. There is a battle sequence midway through the film as Henry's troops fight oncoming invaders. My God. Just... if you can get a copy of the film, if nothing else that sequence holds up as one of the two or three essential battles on film. There's chaos, there's fast cutting (yet, even with Welles, you always can see what's going on, far as it goes), and yet there's a story going on as Falstaff, who is on the sidelines of the action, tries not to get involved and even plays dead, and Welles is really crafty in cutting back to this. He apparently only had 100 men at a time to work with. He makes it look like triple that - and all the mud and blood that goes with the dirtiness of an epic battle.

It's a filmmaker who loves Shakespeare so deeply, yet he connects it with his own life as an artist and doesn't lose that. It may not matter to some, but I liked that this could be a metaphor for not just Welles but anyone on the margins looking in, unable to break through (especially at the end, as Henry V finally reaches the throne). The energy and force of the direction, the acting, the writing, it triumphs over technical flaws - the syncing of dialog in parts, the fact that parts just connect enough, as it did with Othello in the filmmaking - and in a couple of the performances in spurts. It ranks with the major Welles films, and now with this beautiful Criterion blu-ray release (looking even better than in the limited DCP screenings it got last year for Welles' 100th anniversary), I have a feeling, with time, it'll deepen like Kane with appreciation for the craft and ideas on display.",1474761600,4,5290,4.33939393939394
1515676,5,B00005JMMW,"A movie by a film genius, in Blu-Ray version that is the best I've seen yet.

Orson Welles several times adapted Shakespeare's ""second tetralogy,"" the later collection of Shakespeare's plays about English history (Richard II, 1 Henry IV, 2 Henry IV, Henry V) as a single production.  He put earlier versions of this work on the stage in the 1930s and the 1950s.  ""Chimes at Midnight"" (1965) is Welles's final attempt to boil down Shakespeare's meditation on kingship, English history, friendship, power, and the relations between fathers and sons into a single work--and it is a masterpiece of film.

Welles made the movie on a shoestring budget, and he spent all the money he had (and didn't have) on assembling a great cast, which includes Sir John Gielgud (a haunted and chilly King Henry), Dame Margaret Rutherford (Mistress Quickly), Norman Rodway (a wonderfully impulsive and sympathetic Hotspur) Jeanne Moreau (Doll Tearsheet), Keith Baxter (Prince Hal) and himself as Falstaff.  It is not a technically perfect film: there are some post-production problems, many voices only approximately synchronizing with lip movement, some clumsy edits, and so on.  But this is not an exercise in technical-polish-plus-vacuous-content (think the last comicbook-based action film you saw).  This is a profound and beautiful interpretation of Shakespeare's historical vision.

I've taught the plays (and used the film) many times over many years.  All I can say is that I wish I had had this version at the time.  Many voices and whole scenes are clearer on the soundtrack, and many images are clearer on the screen.  Welles's original aspect-ratio has been preserved.  The film is more moving and powerful than I have ever seen it.

At the very end, in a passage from Henry V, before Falstaff's coffin is painfully wheeled out of the innyard, the silly Mistress Quickly denies that he is in hell, ""Nay, he's in Arthur's bosom, if ever man went to Arthur's bosom,"" thus using her habitual malapropisms to discover a transcendent truth.  As with everything else, the Criterion blu-ray version does not ""colorize"" or falsify this moment, but it clarifies it, and so the scene carries the power Welles wanted it to carry.  We cannot ask for more.  This is a magnificent film in a faithfully rendered version.",1474156800,20,2298,5.071808510638298
1515677,5,B00005JMMW,"Orson Welles didn't have as many opportunities to make films with the type of budget he truly deserved. When ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" tanked (after being recut at the direction of the new studio head at RKO by Robert Wise AND with a limited release virtually forcing it to fail) Welles found himself struggling throughout his career to truly get the budget and films he wanted to make to the screen. For better or worse this, in a sense, freed Welles to make the kind of films he wanted to even if he struggled with the resources he had. Originally Welles had contracted to make ""Treasure Island"" (a film that was supposed to be shot at the same time but never was) using the money and sets to shoot ""Chimes. Welles revived the idea of ""Chimes"" (which had evolved from an early stage production called ""Five Kings"") which combined elements Henry IV, Part 1 and Henry IV, Part 2, but also Richard II, Henry V, and sneaking in lines from The Merry Wives of Windsor.

""Chimes at Midnight"" was mostly critically reviled when it was released back in 1966 but has grown in stature over the years and recognized as a classic.

Criterion has done a great job of transferring Welles' film for high def including cleaning up the elements from the 2009 restoration.  The film is presented in its original aspect ratio 1.66:1.  Audio is a bit  tinny sounding but that's through no fault of Criterion--it's due to the recording itself-and it has been restored improving on previous versions. Subtitles in English are provided.

The special features include a commentary by John Naremare, Welles appearance on The Merv Griffin Show from 1965, interviews with Beatrice Welles, Keith Baxter, actor and Welles biographer Simon Callow (Simon where are the other books buddy?) , author Joseph McBride (Whatever Happened to Orson Welles?) and finally a Welles interview while he was editing the film.

""Chimes at Midnight"" finds Welles combining elements of different Shakespearean plays with the character of Falstaff the common denominator. Welles was able to attract a stellar cast including John Gieldgud, Jeanne Moreau, Margaret Rutherford, Fernando Rey, Keith Baxter and Marina Vlady. Ralph Richardson did the narration. The film was shot without sound (a trick that Welles would use again and again on his smaller budget projects and they were dubbed in post production--sometimes with Welles dubbing multiple parts.

Beautiful black and white and clear sound for the first time. The only draw back to a version this good looking is that you can see when Welles used a stand in for some actors. Especially when Gielgud dies, the picture is so clear I'm wondering why he didn't hang around for the rest of the scene. But this was the way Welles was forced to work. The battle scene has so much more impact now and the extra's including interviews and commentary provide interesting info for fans of Welles. Finally justice for Chimes at Midnight.",1472774400,17,670,4.411290322580645
1515679,5,B00005JMMW,"I saw my first Orson Welles movie when I was five or six years old.

The film was THE STRANGER, and though I didn't recall the title or know then who Welles was, the final scene in the clock tower was one that I never forgot.

Orson Welles and his films have always fascinated me.  I wrote a college thesis about him, and shortly after his death, I created a one-person stage play (ORSON WELLES), which has had some productions around the country and is also available as an audio download through Amazon, audible.com and iTunes.

Thus, when The Criterion Collection announced that they were releasing two of Welles hard-to-find films onto Blu-ray, I was delighted.

CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT (1966) is Welles adaptation of Shakespeares plays dealing with Sir John Falstaff, and who better to play that overweight rapscallion than Welles himself.

For those of you not familiar the two parts of HENRY IV or THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR, Falstaff is the loyal, usually drunk friend of Prince Hal, the wayward son of Henry IV.  He is a comic, ultimately tragic figure; one of Shakespeares finest creations.

The black-and-white images that Welles generates for the film are breathtaking, particularly since, like most of the movies he made independently, he was working on a bare-bones budget.  Indeed, the power of the centerpiece battle scene rivals those in movies with much higher budgets. The money may not have been there, but the creativity certainly was.

Young filmmakers, wanting to learn how to make more out of less, should study Welles.

Besides Welles, the cast of CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT includes Jeanne Moreu, Margaret Rutherford, John Gielgud (as Henry IV), Fernando Rey and Keith Baxter as Prince Hal.  Ralph Richardson serves as narrator.

This new high-definition digital restoration of CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT is filled with extras.  Audio commentary is supplied by Welles scholar James Naremore.  There are new interviews with actor Keith Baxter, Welles daughter, Beatrice, who appeared in the film at age nine, Welles biographers Simon Callow and Joseph McBride, as Welles himself in a 1965 interview from The Merv Griffin Show.  Film scholar Michael Anderegg wrote the essay in the booklet that accompanies the disc.

The image quality of the Suevia Films is distinctly inferior to that of the other two versions and the image is far jumpier.  The most detail is captured on the Bongo50 version, but this seems to be done by reducing the dynamic range and heightening the exposure level, with the result that the image is really grey & white rather than black & white, and, for a restored version, there's still a lot of noise.  In all 3 versions, the image is very soft.  A quick search through the web indicates that some unnamed studio has plans to come out with a new release later in 2015, perhaps from the supposedly pristine positive print recently found and shown in France.  In any case, this masterpiece of cinematography definitely needs it.  None of the 3 versions I've seen is really up to par.

This is Welles' artful combining of Shakespeare's HENRY IV Parts One and Two. It centers on the friendship of Prince Hal and Falstaff (played by Welles, of course). Keith Baxter (the original Milo in the stage version of SLEUTH) does a fitting Hal, and there's a star turn by French New Wave icon Jeanne Moreau. The cinematography and lighting are extraordinary (this is, after all, Orson Welles) and the mood is perfect. I HIGHLY recommend this film if you  a) love Shakespeare,  b) love Welles,  c) love good filmmaking, and/or  d) love this film and have been waiting for a decent home-video version that does the film justice.",1394409600,,1021,4.745762711864407

1516129,5,B00005JMMW,"Finally, a neglected classic gets its due.

Released in 1965, Orson Welles' Chimes at Midnight (1965) has been difficult to find for years due to dispute in the ownership and the Orson Welles estate. Even harder to find was the right DVD that would give it the proper picture and audio quality. Yes, there were some good quality imports like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brazilian-import/dp/B0007X6KM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brazilian import</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spanish-import-with-the-pink-DVD-case-cover-1965/dp/B00874Y2AK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spanish import with the pink DVD case cover (1965)</a>&nbsp;but both of them are out of stock and, in the case of the Brazilian copy, very expensive to buy. Like other Shakespeare adaptations by Orson Welles (Macbeth, Othello), Chimes at Midnight seemed destined to be lost out of the public's eye forever.

That all changed in 2011 when Mr. Bongo released a R2 DVD of Chimes at Midnight in the UK to critical acclaim. Then in May of 2012, an all-region import of the Mr. Bongo DVD was brought to American soil. Despite some initial skepticism on my part, the Mr. Bongo version of Chimes is a revelation: the picture quality is excellent and most, if not all, the post-dubbing problems that plagued the picture have been fixed. Only the lack of subtitles is the DVD's main drawback. When all is said and done, the Mr. Bongo import of Chimes at Midnight is easily the best and most accessible version of the movie to get.

As for the movie itself, Chimes is absolutely deserving of the many accolades bestowed upon it, something that can't be said for many Orson Welles movies before and after. Condensing several of William Shakespeare's plays into one movie, Chimes is a visual marvel, with its superb camera work, expressive shadows and complex angles that will delight anyone who has enjoyed Citizen Kane (1941) or Touch of Evil (1958) for those same reasons. Undeniably, the centerpiece of Chimes is the amazing Battle of Shrewesbury scene, with its ferocious editing, dynamic action and gritty realism that has inspired many great cinematic battles including the Omaha Beach scene in Saving Private Ryan (1998) and most of the battles in Braveheart (1995)

Equally superb is the acting, especially by Welles as the cowardly buffoon Falstaff and Keith Baxter as the troubled Hal, who must choose between his duty as prince or his life in indulging with Falstaff. The climatic scene where Hal finally rejects Falstaff in favor of his ascension to kingdom is one of the most moving scenes in all of Orson Welles' movies. Falstaff's stunned facial expression at being turned down by his friend will linger on after the movie's end.

Chimes at Midnight is an absolute masterpiece and easily ranks with many of Orson Welles' best movies, including Citizen Kane (1941) and Touch of Evil (1958). It took forever to find the right DVD that would give Chimes the presentation that it deserves. Mr. Bongo does moviegoers proud by taking this classic and restoring it to vivid life. You owe it to yourself to pick this movie.

1516131,5,B00005JMMW,"King Henry IV (John Gielgud) is deeply concerned with his son's (Keith Baxter) lack of interest in his Princely duties. The young Prince seems content to carouse and drink at taverns and brothels with the debauched and lazy knight Falstaff (Orson Welles, who also directed). But the time is coming when young Hal must choose between duty and a life of indulgence. Reputedly Welles' favorite among his own films, this audacious adaptation of segments from four of Shakespeare's plays (MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR, RICHARD II, HENRY IV and HENRY V) easily ranks with Welles' CITIZEN KANE and MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS. Its flaws are technical rather than artistic. The multi international cast required dubbing, mostly with minor characters and the dubbing is obvious. In fact, one can clearly recognize Welles' own voice dubbing other characters and the narrative is sometimes vague. But those are insignificant quibbles. Visually, this is the most stunning of all Welles' films with Edmond Richard (DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE) responsible for the exquisite images. The battle scenes which are probably the most admired aspect of the film are superb, one would have to go back to Eisenstein's battle on the ice in ALEXANDER NEVSKY to find something comparable. Welles the actor does right by Falstaff, he's impeccable. The outstanding score is by Angelo Francesco Lavagnino. With Jeanne Moreau, Margaret Rutherford, Alan Webb, Fernando Rey, Norman Rodway, Marina Vlady, Beckley, Beatrice Welles and narration by Ralph Richardson.

1516132,5,B00005JMMW,"How well do you understand the universe of Shakespeare? Chimes of Midnight was directed by Orson Welles in 1965. I do not think it is really necessary to complain about the quality of the print. Chimes of Midnight is truly an anti-block buster and that is why it stands up. This film is about content, content, and content. The writing in this movie is on an entire different level. The research and talent put into the creation of Chimes at Midnight is evident from start to finish. Many film experts believe that this film revealed the true genius of Orson Welles. Also please don't be mistaken: this is a film buff's movie all across the board. It is dark, hard to understand, and choppy. It also changed the way people make movies forever. In this film Welles plays Sir John Falstaff. Falstaff is a reoccurring character in the plays of Shakespeare. Welles basically made this movie to tell the entire coherent story of Falstaff in one complete story. In other words he pieced together different elements of Shakespeare plays to create this film. The plot is a woven Shakespearean mosaic that contains text primarily from Henry IV, Part 1 and Henry IV, Part 2, but also Richard II, Henry V, and The Merry Wives of Windsor. Viewing this film through the lens of Shakespearean appreciation the outcome is nothing short of amazing. This is ultimately a powerful and intelligent film. When Johnny Cash covered Nine Inch Nails he made the song his own. When Orson Welles adapted, rearranged, directed, and acted in the works of Shakespeare, he came close to a very similar accomplishment.

We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow.",1334188800,2,1642,4.8021201413427566
1516133,5,B00005JMMW,"Welles again demonstrates his consummate creativity, merging a number of scenes from Shakespeare's plays to carve the finest portraits of both the young Henry IV and his muse and drinking companion, Falstaff.  It is a timeless relationship between rebellious youth - so in need of a break from the burden of responsibility that presses on him - and his antithesis, an old drunkard merrymaker who bumbles through life with wit, laughter, and in the worst disorder.  In a grainy production that makes no shortcuts in language, It is acted to perfection by the unbeatable ensemble of Wells, Baxter, Gielgud, and Moreau, to mention only a few.

At the center is prince Hal, whose father disapproves of his adolescent partying.  He needs the corpulent Falstaff, who loves him and hopes to use him once he gains power, as a courtier.  Gielgud (the perpetual old man) is the King, defending himself and Hal from a series of deadly challengers from family and friends.  All of these relationships evolve, so close to life that only Shakespeare could write it.  It make me weep at the mystery of life.

The film is extremely ambitious, a hallmark of Welles.  The sets are wonderfully realistic, including the horrific civil war battle between the Henries, when Henry IV must at last prove his mettle to his father.  Nothing romantic and glorious, just mud, mayhem, and fear.  It is one of the best portrayals of organized violence on film.  But there is the wider milieu as well, from the court to brothels and pubs.  It is beautiful and raw.

I saw this 30 years ago in English with subtitles on French television and remembered it so vividly that I have looked for a good version of it ever since.  This version is good, but the sound is primitive and somewhat low.  The formatting is also inset rather than full screen, hence the print somewhat inferior.  But these are minor gripes.  This is a great film that can be viewed over and over.  Now I will watch it with my children, for whom I am nurturing an interest in SHakespeare - this is the perfect vehicle.

1516205,4,B00005JMMW,"Made in 1966, this is the first and only film featuring Shakespeare's character, Falstaff. It is a joyful comedy with selected scenes from the History plays (Richard II, Henry IV Books 1 and 2, and Henry V). In a trio of Shakespeare films including Macbeth and Othello, it was directed by, and starring Orson Welles, and remains a masterpiece of its day.
The film is fun throughout. Most of the comedy is low life, with vagabonds, thieves and cutpurses living in `dens of iniquity'. Falstaff enjoys `sac' and lives life to the full, every day. However, there are also moments of drama and pathos, such as Henry Vs rejection of Falstaff during his coronation, and the lamentations after the old man's death.
Whilst Welles is the best Falstaff I have seen in a large screen film, there have been some great portrayals since then in Shakespeare's original play formats. The rest of the cast is also good, including Margaret Rutherford, a classical actress who never failed to please, as a superb Mistress Quickly. Keith Baxter also stands out as Young Hal, then as Henry V, and is convincing in both lifestyles. In particular I like John Gielgud in the very difficult role of Henry IV who speaks with such excellence and eloquence. Unfortunately we only see little of him which is a shame as he would have brought more class to the film.
As with other black and white films over 45 years old, we must make allowances for sub standard picture and sound quality, as well as poor props and scenery, caused by low budget difficulties. If and when the viewer forgives these limitations, it is a great film and a true Orson Welles classic. I yearn for a remake, but is there another Welles or Gielgud anywhere?",1321056000,6,1701,4.6923076923076925
1516206,5,B00005JMMW,"I last saw this masterpiece 36 years ago in an art cinema in London,The Electric. Then I remember the print was shakey,the sound out of sync,but I got its essence. This is the film Welles really wanted to make above all others. The film has been out of circulation for 35 years,obtainable in only Brazilian and Spanish prints. The larger-than-life character that flits through various of his plays,Henry IV parts I and II and The Merry Wives of Windsor and Henry V, based on the real Jack Oldcastle. Welles took the scenes from the different plays Falstaff is in and makes him the hero,he weaved multiple plays together to create a new narrative. Now its been released in this DVD February 2011 as Falstaff Chimes at Midnight. Richardson narrates the film from Holinshed's Chronicles.

The title comes in the elegiac opening. Originally Falstaff said it to his aging friend Justice Shallow. However, there is a degree of tragedy and sadness around this as well: Shallow and his ancient kinsman Silence represent the rural happiness and content with life that Falstaff can never really have, and when Falstaff tells him,""We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow"" it becomes nostalgic and almost tragic to think at what all this man's been through and enjoyed. Welles exudes real warmth and humanity.

Henry IV(Gielgud) is a careworn King,troubled by his son's (Prince Hal's) waywardness and his usurper role as Bolingbroke. Unable to expiate his crime by the threat of civil war. Prince Hal beguiles the time in the company of Falstaff,drinking in taverns and plotting practical jokes. Falstaff carouses with his cronies and his mistress,Doll Tearsheet(JeanneMoreau),drinking, kissing, laughing, cavorting,play-acting,gambling,story-telling. The film re-edits the plays of Shakespeare,covering the period from the end of Richard II to the start of Henry V.Falstaff is centre stage with the story of the Kings setting the framework of the plot,relegated to the background. Yet the strength of Gielgud's performance is crucial,guilty,cold,with dignity,reflecting the high stone walls of his castle,which Prince Hal will one day inherit.

There are some soundtrack difficulties(ie either too low or too high and changing from one to the other too quickly),but this should not alter one's enjoyment of this incredible film. Working,due to budget deficits,in Spain and dubbing a lot of the extras. This film is a testament to Welles' genius in the character part he was born to play,Falsaff. He gives us the jolly giant in all his pagan bawdiness,tragic melancholy,part of merrie old England, a dream world of Paradise Lost before Puritanism descended like a swathe to gut its comic heart. Falstaff represents the very core of Shakespearean goodness,an intuitional,natural innocence,a golden time of joyous, anarchic abandon. A pity there is no subtitling, as this would have greatly aided the understanding.

There are deep-focus shots,low -angle close-ups,masterful editing,imbuing the B&W film with a rhythm that complements the narrative drive and organic unity,a masterful music score that keeps it all moving,like the camera work, eternally moving round Falstaff and the sharp cinematography. The tavern is a large low-slung barn,managed by Mistress Quickly(Rutherford).The quick pacing of the Battle of Shrewbury is so energetic it rates as one of the best battles in cinema history,with bodies falling into a sea of mud. Prince Hal saves the day killing Hotspur in single combat,for which Falstaff claims the credit. All the time his cowardly bulk hidden or darting through the trees. The fat vagabond tells a tall story. All the lines are from Shakespeare yet effortlessly flow.

The dying king advises Hal to busy giddy minds with foreign quarrels to unite England. Overjoyed to hear of Hal's succession,Falstaff boasts of his future under the new King,but the transformed Henry V spurns him-"" I Know thee not old man!""-in public during the coronation procession. The changing relationship between Falstaff and Prince Hal is the heart of the drama. Falstaff is the vital link for the future king between the court and the submerged life of London's back streets. The camera captures the broken-hearted gaze of the cast-aside Falstaff,Shakespeare's most popular,magnificent creation. Keith Baxter is magnificent(Hal) as is Norman Rodway as the heroic Hotspur. Moreau is lively and expressive, Rutherford is affectionate,matronly. Welles's best film barring none. A good DVD.",1298937600,2,4489,5.388888888888889

His Falstaff is essentially a good character whose habitual lies are relatively harmless and amusing to those around him.  The contrast drawn between him and Prince Hal is conveyed brilliantly on the screen -- Falstaff being a warm and sympathetic character while Prince Hal is revealed as cold, condescending, and insincere.  The actor who plays Hal (Keith Baxter)does a very good job in portraying the prince, but it is Welles' Falstaff who dominates the story with his amusing escapades and abounding wit.

But I have always had trouble with Falstaff.  I could never fathom his appeal and popularity.  For me, Falstaff comes off as petty and vile; his humor, stale.  But I realize now that my negative reaction was a result of reading Falstaff on the page.

What a change of opinion after watching this movie!  I now feel that you cannot fully appreciate Falstaff until you see him personified in a great actor, such as Welles.  Those mischievous darting eyes, that hearty smile, those wittily delivered punch lines, how all the other characters are captivated by him.  Falstaff has charisma, and Welles brings that charisma to life.

Welles has also surrounded himself with great Shakespearean actors.  Everyone is excellent (although Jeanne Moreau is a little too sultry, and Margaret Rutherford a little too schoolmarmish.)

The movie's essential qualities can be split in two: the visual, stunning; the audio, disappointing.  Welles is a master at framing beautiful, entrancing scenes.  The shots of the towering gallows with the dead men hanging below are unforgettable.  But the audio is, in a word, poor.  All the dialogue was dubbed, and the dubbing is obvious.  But the problem is worse than that: words and whole phrases are sometimes inaudible, and noise is a regular problem.  Other reviewers have expressed the wish for a Criterion version, and improvement could best be made on the audio track.  If that were done (and closed captioning added), Chimes at Midnight would become one of the great movies for teaching Shakespeare.

It is often said that a great actor can make Shakespeare understandable to an audience.  I agree--but not in this movie.  Because of the poor audio, this is one movie for which you need to read the plays first.  Reading both parts of Henry IV should cover 95% of the movie.  Reading just the scenes with Falstaff should cover well over 50%.  There is also a book available with a ""complete continuity script"" of the movie.

I watched a DVD version marked ""Nostalgia Family Video"" on the back, and the audio seemed in synch to me.  Although other reviewers have commented on the poor quality of the disc itself, there are unfortunately no other good options available.  My understanding is that the audio is out of synch in the VHS version.

Near the end of the movie are some lines taken from Henry V.  The King says,

""Enlarge the man committed yesterday,
That rail'd against our person: we consider
It was excess of wine that set him on.""

The film version expressly adds that the man is ""Falstaff"" (which is not in the original text).  My first reaction was that Welles was taking too large a liberty here.  But then I went back and looked at Henry V again.  In the written version, the prior scene had ended with Falstaff's being ""shaked of a burning quotidian tertian""; and in the next scene (following the enlargement) Falstaff is dead.  Welles is right: the King's lines are an allusion to Falstaff, especially given the wine.  The King's act can be seen as a final parting, enlarging Falstaff from the bands of life.

What a great movie!  In an interview done in 1982, Welles commented: ""If I wanted to get into heaven on the basis of one movie, that's the one I'd offer up.""  In my opinion, he'd get in.",1238544000,10,3404,4.7406143344709895

If one does not know the story, it is advisable to read the film script first which is available through the Rutgers Films-in-Print Series.

Although it's been at the top of my DVD ""want list"" for years, I had about given up hope that a Region 1 disc would ever be released. So, suddenly seeing that such a DVD was available thru Amazon came as quite a surprise. I was amazed - and dubious. Could the quality be any good coming from some company I had never heard of before? It looked too good to be true.

After reading the mainly favorable customer comments, I decided to take a chance and placed an order. (After all, at the price there wasn't that much to lose.) Like others who have commented, I was amazed at what I saw after it arrived.

The disc was made from a fairly good copy of the film. The image is sharp throughout. The blacks are deep and I did not see the lines mentioned in another commentary. Dirt and scratches from normal wear and age are there, especially near the beginning, but during most of the film they are at a minimum. As mentioned by others, the main improvement is in the soundtrack. As I remember, it was even worse than in OTHELLO before that film was remastered. Now it is near perfect - a truly amazing change! Also, this is a widescreen presentation. The aspect ratio appears to be about 1.66. Whoever they are, Nostalgia Family Video has done an excellent job with this DVD.

1516364,5,B00005JMMW,"Orson Welles' filmmaking genius did not vanish after ""Citizen Kane."" Released in 1966 and barely shown in America, ""Chimes at Midnight"" was his best Shakespearean adaptation - featuring some of the finest battle scenes captured on celluloid. Surrounded by an excellent cast, Welles delivered the performance of his career as Falstaff. In a 1982 BBC interview, the actor-director considered ""Chimes at Midnight"" his greatest cinematic achievement. ""If I wanted to get into heaven on the basis of one movie, that's the one I'd offer up.""",1202342400,18,535,5.305882352941176
1516365,5,B00005JMMW,"With the aide of a middleman, and a tip from the great Roger Ebert, I recently acquired a Brazilian DVD of Orson Welles' ""The Chimes at Midnight"".  One can't help but applaud the foreign distributor for making this film available, even marginally, for otherwise I would have had no opportunity at all to see it.

One of the most obscure products of Welles post-Hollywood films made on lunch money and pocketfuls of change, ""Chimes"" has spent the last forty years as a critically adored, but largely unseen masterpiece. Welles compresses most of the first half of the 'War of the Roses' cycle, largely consisting of ""Henry IV, Parts 1 & 2"", and a handful of scenes and lines from ""Henry V"" (many descriptions of the film also include ""The Merry Wives of Windsor"", but I can't identify any part of the film from that play). The political aspects of the Henry IV plays are largely eliminated, and the remainder exist mostly to give some justification to the larger plot (and the war); the focus is, as the alternate title of ""Falstaff"" suggests, primarily on valiant Sir John, played by Welles himself.

Aside from Welles, the notable parts are filled by the late Sir John Gielgud (as King Henry IV), Keith Baxter (as Prince Hal/Henry V), Margaret Rutherford (Mistress Quickly), and Jeanne Moreau (Doll Tearsheet). It's surprising to see big Bard actors like Gielgud participating in a production like this, but doubtless they did it as favours to Welles, who, from the late 40s until his death was sort of like Ed Wood, if Ed Wood made good movies. Given the incredibly choppy production history, it's amazing that the film isn't totally unwatchable; instead, it's great. In fact, aside from the sometimes glaring sound synchronization problems, I'd venture to say that the minuscule budget isn't really noticeable: the Battle of the Shrewsbury is excellent, and you can clearly see its influence on Branagh's Agincourt and Gibson's Stirling.

Harold Bloom once called Falstaff the equal to Hamlet, although Falstaff arguably suffers because he, more than Hamlet, needs to be seen performed to be truly understood, while Hamlet can be more thoroughly comprehended just by reading his dialogue. I've always been fascinated by the disconnect that exists between the ""Henry IV"" plays and ""Henry V"" in regards to the character of Hal. Whatever his good qualities, the Prince's role in the first two is that of a conniving Machiavel who uses a band of jovial rogues to advance his own reputation, while in ""Henry V"" he has taken on the role of crusading hero (although Shakespeare's writing choices sometimes subvert his heroism). In many ways, it's surprising that audiences, in any age, wanted to see anything more of the man that destroyed poor Jack Falstaff.",1201564800,18,2755,4.956709956709957
1516366,5,B00005JMMW,"I obtained at VHS copy of this film back in the early 90s when I was just out of university, and I've seen it maybe two or three times. It's a remarkably outstanding piece of cinematic achievement -- much like his Othello, Welles melds the artform of the 20th century with the immortal bard's words, characters and situations to marvelous effect.

The audio quality of the VHS was difficult at times, and the same is true for this DVD (ironic that Welles' audio on so many films is subpar considering he was a radio star first, where all he had was audio), but it shouldn't get in the way of your enjoyment of the film.

The entire cast turns in fantastic performances and the stark B&W images underscores the emotional nature of this story -- the disposing of one's mentors.

One can't compare the script to anything Shakespeare actually wrote, because it's an amalgam of several pieces of Shakespeare from his ""Histories"", yet Welles stitches together the appearances of Sir John Falstaff with magical aplomb and gives the story a narrative drive that is more modern, yet still classical in its design and execution.

If any film warrants at Criterion restoration it's this film, however I have to believe the original elements are in the worst condition; still, sinking some money in by the UCLA Film Archive or the BFI for a restoration wouldn't be such a bad thing or a waste of money...",1196899200,17,1392,4.692622950819672

1516368,5,B00005JMMW,"This is Welles' most personal film; deftly editing Shakespeare's Henry IV plays, bits of Henry V and Merry Wives of Windsor, Welles tells the tragedy of Falstaff, the purest good man in all of English drama. The fat knight, who forsakes chivalrous blood-letting for merry cowardice, wine, women and song, represents all the virtues of a pre-modern England to be swept away by his protege, the politic, cunning, war-mongering Prince Hal. When Hal turns his back on Falstaff, who responds ""Banish plump Jack and you banish all the world,"" this is Orson Welles speaking directly to an audience that had banished him since ""Citizen Kane.""  This is his most personal, autobiographical film -- as if Welles stripped off the disguises he'd been wearing for years, let his fat and premature age and alternating gaiety and sadness be exposed to the camera, and truly found himself in Shakespeare.

Shot in Spain in the mid-60's on a meagre budget, but with a splendid cast of UK thespians, Welles here abandoned the pyrotechnic, baroque style of his famous films for a simple, almost John Ford-like elegance.  His own performance as Falstaff is the most nuanced, subtle acting he ever did, without mannerism, a subdued and melancholy Falstaff who knows his era is passing. Years ago, I saw a lousy dupe print of this, and it has been out of circulation for years. I have heard its reappearence has been held up in some sort of legal limbo; too bad -- Chimes At Midnight cries out for the restoration that lesser Welles films like Mr Arkadin and Othello have already received.

A final note -- while this movie is notable for its relative simplicity of style, there is one amazing sequence -- Welles' wordless rendering of the battle of Shrewsbury, which begins with chivalric pageantry and ends in slow-motion as knights hack one another to death in the mud; a battle scene that rivals Kurosawa and Eisenstein, and shows that the trickster had a few moves up his sleeve in the twilight of his broken career.",1153267200,24,1998,4.833333333333333
1516369,5,B00005JMMW,"The search for Orson Welles' late masterpiece ""Chimes at Midnight"" just got a little easier.  A Brazilian DVD import takes the Welles classic into the digital age and offers an alternative to the out-of-print Arthur Cantor VHS release.

""Chimes at Midnight"" is one of the great Shakespearean adaptations and a true 'lost classic'. It's also the last masterpiece that Orson Welles directed in his lifetime, and with 'Citizen Kane,' 'Magnificent Ambersons' and 'Touch of Evil' comprises a quartet of major cinematic works by Welles. Though rarely seen, ""Chimes at Midnight"" has influenced modern filmmakers. Mel Gibson, for example, admitted the famous ""Battle of Shrewesbury"" scene influenced his own ""Braveheart.""

The film is an inventive re-editing and condensation of Shakespeare's plays, spanning from the end of Richard II to the beginning of Henry V. The film shifts the focus from the titular English kings to the character of Jack Falstaff, played by Welles himself in a virtuoso performance. Falstaff's relationship with young Prince Hal (later Henry V) is explored, and uncannily parallels Welles' own experience with the young talents of Hollywood.

There are several great performances, by John Gielgud as Henry IV, Keith Baxter as Hal, Kenneth Branagh look-alike Norman Rodway as Hotspur, Welles regular Jeanne Moreau as Doll Tearsheet, and the great Dame Margaret Rutherford (of ""Miss Marple"" fame) as Mistress Quickly.

""Chimes at Midnight"" can be a jarring experience due to inconsistent film quality, low budget sets and Welles' flair for shock cuts. Once you adapt to the style and limitations, it's a truly rewarding experience. Welles has found a deeply moving story between the lines of Shakespeare's histories.

""Chimes at Midnight"" was Welles' final attempt to popularize Shakespeare for the masses. With any luck, this film will eventually reach the wider audiences that Welles failed to achieve in his lifetime.",1147392000,154,1936,5.394039735099338

It is Shakespeare's best adaptation to a screen, whether it is more faithful or not I don't know.

1516371,5,B00005JMMW,"As I recall, this was one of Orson Welles' favorites of his own films (he wrote, directed, and starred in it), and many have commented on the parallels between Welles' career and Falstaff's. At any rate, he had every reason to be proud of ""Chimes,"" because it's a splendid movie. The film's script is a conflation of the two Henry IVs, plus a little of Henry V, one speech from Richard II, and apparently a bit of The Merry Wives of Windsor that I've never been able to spot, cut to focus on the relationship between Falstaff and Hal and its eventual breakdown. This dynamic is realized beautifully, extending sympathy to both protagonists; Welles' Falstaff is both funny and vulnerable, while Keith Baxter as Hal goes from being a young goofball prince who clearly does love his fat old mentor to being a repressed and angsty king - in the rejection scene, Falstaff is both deeply wounded and yet proud of his kingly young protg, while the newly-crowned Henry V looks the model of composure, but his voice shakes as he pronounces Falstaff's banishment. It's tremendous. I also need to put in a good word for John Gielgud (as always!) who appears as a splendidly chilly Henry IV (equipped with a Look of Withering Disappointment which is capable of peeling lead paint off of walls), and Norman Rodway's very entertaining Hotspur (granted, Hotspur is rarely not entertaining). Also, fans of Branagh's Henry V (of which I am one of the most rabid) will note the influence of this film on his treatment - in particular, his Agincourt owes much to ""Chimes'"" nightmarish rendering of the battle of Shrewsbury.",1135036800,17,1604,4.773381294964029

7940441,4,B00005JMMW,"Four and an almost five stars. I would have liked a slightly better job on the technical side of this DVD. In particular the sound quality. The technical side of the film making places Chimes at Midnight among the best Black and White films made and a heavy argument in favor of making more. My quibble is with the equality of the sound. This is a text driven movie and every word need be clear.
To finish the discussion of the movie making involved, this movie is far less known than it should be or should have been. Welles went broke before the movie was completed and sold the distribution rights to someone who re sold them who then bungled distribution. Chimes ad Midnight did not get anything like a proper showing on the big screen and this Criterion edition may be one of the few ways for people to see this masterpiece.
My favorite part about Chimes at Midnight is the use of Black and White. High contrast film, perfect matchups between costuming and lighting, and shadow meant that actors can be reduced to just their faces or that ruined ancient castles can appear as miraculously majestic and vast cathedral like spaces.  Considering that the massive battle scene was filmed with a fraction of the actors and horses one would be willing to bet had been a cast of thousands and the many layers of Welles skills as a director is best visible in what in this movie is visible.

The script. Welles had a long, perhaps lifelong interest in the character of Falstaff and of the Shakespeare plays wherein he is present. The extras added to this DVD document that Welles had first attempted to collapse or mash up Shakespearian play as far back as High School. The movie here is based on a stage play by the same name also written by Welles and also not especially successful.
The basic plot is drawn from Richard II, the Henry IV and V plays with a touch of the Merry Wives of Windsor. Most of the Shakespeare is drawn word for word. Welles builds around the young Prince Hal on his way to becoming King Henry V. Shakespeares great comic buffoon, Sir John Falstaff (Welles) is the indulgent father figure to the wayward Prince ( Keith Baxter). The Prince is also a loyal son to guilt ridden father King Henry IV (John Guild good).

Much is made of another supporting cast member, Jeanne Moreau. She plays Doll Tearsheet, and the name about says it all. She is a woman of the town, and friend to most of the more wayward members of the Falstaff retinue. She has one speech of some moment, but for the rest she is lost in her hair or in the sheets and is makes mush less impression than the great Margret Rutherford as Mistress Quickly.

There is very little I can add to the many, more expert opinions about the brilliance of the great battle scene. It is a great rendition of just how random, ugly and deadly and muddy battle can be. My quibble is that the way Welles has himself filmed as the cowardly Falstaff, is too distracting. There is too much of Falstaff and it is not consistent with the rest of this sequence. Given the way Welles handled his scenes, it was most likely not filmed at the same time, or the same place.

Ultimately this movie is about the Young Prince choosing between his real father, and the man who was a father to him. It is about a choice between becoming mature and responsible and forgetting the simple joys of youth. A much simpler decision if your father is not on the throne by act of usurpation and when becoming mature does not carry with it healing a nation from civil war.
