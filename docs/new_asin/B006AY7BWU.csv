4981974,5,B006AY7BWU,"...my ""must-see TV"" for that day of the week was Shirley Temple movies. I just bought all three volumes of this series, which gives me a total of 18--the closest I can get to ""complete"". Almost half of these are ones I never did see as a kid. I just watched ""Heidi"" from Volume 1 of this series, and I noticed that movie offered a ""colorized"" version on the same disc. I realize that there are a lot of ""cinema police"" types who will protest ""how could you?"", but I didn't watch these on TV in black & white originally because it was ""God's intended way to see them""--it was because my mom and dad weren't able to afford a color set until the early 1960s. I find that confusing preferences with ""supposed to's"" destroys the entertainment value of more than one form of entertainment. Fortunately this outfit doesn't cram multiple movies on the same disc--that is, unless it's black & white and colorized versions of the same film. I've had bad experiences with ""box sets"" made by corner-cutting re-release companies that cram too much data on a single disc, thinking that using dual-layer discs completely solves the inevitable tracking problems. Which it doesn't always.",1463875200,,1171,4.717073170731707

My 9 year old and 6 year old really enjoy watching Shirley Temple and my wife and me really enjoy the fact that we can sit down as a family and watch something clean and wholesome. There is just something about the classic movies that the movies of now  cannot recreate.
As for the quality of the picture, it looks good to me. I've read others reviews about the color being horrible or picture being really bad but..... it's an OLD MOVIE, what do you want! You don't like the coloring, then there is the option to switch it to black and white, do that. People expect to much, just sit down and watch it and enjoy the movie and the lessons it gives, stop complaining!",1439856000,9,693,4.25

4981984,5,B006AY7BWU,"I bought all 3 volumes from best buy at a cheaper price also Amazon has the wrong release date. Any way I loved watching Shirley's movies my favorite is The Little Princess. One thing I didn't like about this set was that 6 movies were missing off the top of my heard Seabiscut, our little girl and poor little rich girl are missing. The others I don't remember the titles to them. What your getting in these sets are the same movies that come in the as seen on TV not sold in store sets. I hope fox releases a volume 4 with the missing movies.",1429401600,,544,4.1415094339622645
