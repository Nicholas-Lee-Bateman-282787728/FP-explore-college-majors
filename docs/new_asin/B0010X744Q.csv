8238954,5,B0010X744Q,"My kids and I saw the home improv special when it originally came out and we almost died laughing.  We were rolling in the aisles.  I couldn't help thinking it would be great to own.  I searched for it and finally found it on amazon.  We bought it and found it still incredibly funny.  The other specials are good but if you are going to watch only one of the specials- watch the improv special.  The DVD is of high quality and it is well produced.

With out ruining anything- the home improv special is a spoof on the real show done in a very funny way.  Even if you don't like HGTV and rehab shows this is one to watch.",1436400000,,621,4.074380165289257
8238955,4,B0010X744Q,"My sister-in-law asked for this for Christmas.  She really wanted some of the other shows that are currently on HGTV, but was unable to locate a collection.  She was excited to receive this, though, as she has not seen these shows and really enjoys creative decorating, organizing, etc.  She enjoys watching the ways that a space can be changed - even with small budgets or minimal supplies.

I gave this 4 stars because this really wasn't what she wanted, however, she is pleased with this gift.",1357689600,,496,4.732558139534884
8238956,4,B0010X744Q,"I bought this only for the ""Home Improv"" episode, and that's all I've watched.  It's absolutely hilarious, and brilliant...and well worth the price of the DVD.

Our family's one disappointment -- and it was a big one -- is that more of the hidden camera footage wasn't included.  There had to have been a lot more good stuff that had to be left out because of time limitations.",1240185600,2,377,4.514705882352941
