8183721,3,B000O77LWY,"To start, if you are not an informed and historically interested person in military aircraft combat operations, pretty much a ""lay person"", then this is fairly interesting and informative.  The veteran combat pilots' commentaries are a wonderful touch.
However, as a retired US Air Force weapons loader (bombs, missiles and bullets), and having a minor in military history, there are a lot of holes in this program.  The ""reframing"" of portions of almost all of the footage as a means to highlight sections is distracting and annoying.  Misidentification of aircraft (not every WWII German fighter is a FW190 ""Dora Nine""; not able to tell the difference between a B-17 and B-24), incorrectly claiming capabilities for specific aircraft (the A-10 does NOT carry and employ laser guided munitions, the F-86 had more than 3 machine guns), continually commenting on video being from a ""heads up display"" (obviously not, if you know what a HUD is), and claiming that all kamikazes were Zero fighters...there are many more.
When I watch programs like this, I want them to be historically and TECHNICALLY accurate.  That should be the purpose of such programs as this, to pass on historical information.  If I were still interacting with high school JROTC and CAP cadets, I would be busy pointing out the incorrect points.  If they could find veterans to comment on the footage from different wars and conflicts, then they could find someone to review the same footage and advise the producers on accuracy.  I'm not the only one out in the world who could point the inaccuracies in script and footage.",1408665600,,1594,4.992452830188679
8183722,5,B000O77LWY,"...I work in the visual-effects industry, so I can claim this as business related reference material, but find it fascinating to watch none the less.

...We have all seen WWII Aerial footage of planes being shot down from the viewpoint of the attacking aircraft...( Pilot's-View! )...and this is exactly what this DVD contains. Whenever machine-guns were fired on aircraft, of both sides, a camera shot film to record the hits. This was used to verify pilot's claims of downed planes, but also for statistics and strategy, etc.

...Pilots comment on the footage as we see it, giving valuable insight into what is being seen as well as the intent of the pilots, so it is informative, historic, and frankly, a helluva lot of fun to watch!",1362787200,,736,4.833333333333333
8183723,4,B000O77LWY,"I own dozens of war and aviation related documentaries, many of which are boring and monotonous.  This is not one of them.

""Gun Camera"" is a very interesting compilation of actual gun camera footage from World War Two, Korea, Vietnam, and the Gulf Wars.  Historians, analysts, and pilots provide commentary for the footage, which includes strafing trains and bombing ships in WW2, aerial dogfights in Korea, bombing jungles in Vietnam, and using smart bombs to take out strategic targets in Iraq.

My only complaints with the production are, 1) the repetitive aircraft information, which, although interesting, doesn't have a lot to do with the footage (many of the deleted scenes are more interesting), and, 2) the realism that is lost when sound effects (guns firing and explosions) are added to the normally silent footage, with no acknowledgment made.

Regardless of whether those two things bother you or not, I would recommend this DVD.  It kept me entertained for its entire 135 minutes.",1183248000,8,995,5.111111111111111
