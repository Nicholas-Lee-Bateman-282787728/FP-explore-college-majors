7513089,5,B017RR4YG4,So much better than I was expecting!  It was funny while still heartwarming.  The characters had depth and were realistic.,1448582400,16,122,5.05
7513090,5,B017RR4YG4,"I actually enjoyed the movie. There were already a lot of negative comments out there when I took my family. So we went in with low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised. I tried not to over-analyze it. And as a result, I found it quite enjoyable. Also, based on the audience reactions (they were laughing throughout), it was well liked. There were some sad and touching moments as well. I'm planning on seeing it again before Christmas.",1448582400,35,440,4.7272727272727275
7513091,1,B017RR4YG4,"Brutal.  Marketed as the next Family Stone, new ""Christmas movie"", missed by a mile.  Way to much going on, too many characters trying to be built.  Tried for campy and failed.",1447804800,3,176,4.612903225806452
7513092,2,B017RR4YG4,"A Christmas movie, disjointed, too many characters and flashbacks, the arguments are too intense. We saw the movie to get into the spirit of Christmas; instead got the doldrums of Christmas. Glitzy-looking, great cast, but lousy story and cumbersome, all told by the family dog. Fitting, because the movie is a dog.",1447804800,3,315,5.076923076923077

7513144,2,B017RR4YG4,"Love the Coopers?  I didn't even like them very much.  I don't think Diane Keaton and John Goodman had any chemistry.  Ed Helms is too old for the part and certainly no match for the young waitress. Why did Diane's sister shoplift, and just how far away was the police station?  Olivia and her fake boyfriend had chemistry, but I don't think the relationship will last.  Alan Arkin and the dog were the best part of the movie.  Too bad, I actually like most of the actors.",1516406400,,472,4.367816091954023

7513149,5,B017RR4YG4,I loved this movie.  There are several vignettes that make up the story and it's a funny and delightful movie.  I've watched it several times.,1514332800,,142,4.64

7513151,3,B017RR4YG4,"It's the ideal family - if you're a liberal Hollywood jew living in the riches area of say Connecticut or some such mythical fairy land. The rest of us were not doing so good under the iron fist of Obama's socialist attempted take over. Losing one's job under that wonderful liberal utopia didn't just mean little Tommie wasn't getting a bike for Christmas but that you may have to go to the food shelter at the church to feed him. So all in all I thought about how spoiled rotten this family was and how liberal and left wing they were as I watched it. They were pompous asses whining about themselves not getting the credit for this or that through the whole movie. Except the really dumb ones. Like the waitress who seems to not realize she is a hottie. But Alan Arkin is Alan Arkin and he is one funny guy. So I suffered through just for him. Well, and  Marisa Tomei who is one hot little meatball in marinara sauce. Well that's the way I see it so take it or leave it, it up to you.",1513468800,,987,4.1947368421052635
7513152,5,B017RR4YG4,"Its one of those rare Christmas movies I could watch annually because it is well acted, interesting, touching, and well paced

The movie follows the Grandpa (Alan Atkin), his two daughters (Diane Keaton), Diane Keatons husband (John Goodman), their unmarried daughter (Marisa Tomei), their other unmarried daughter, and their son.  The son is divorced with two sons and a daughter.",1513209600,,381,5.333333333333333

7513186,5,B017RR4YG4,"Many of the critics trashed this movie, and we almost didn't watch it. But I'm so glad we did! It's such a lovely film. Stellar cast, not a typical cheesy, predictable holiday movie, but a genuinely sweet, touching film. It felt real. It showed the dysfunction of family without getting too dramatic or negative. It showed the love of overcoming, and of remembering to see the best in each other. It showed that we find what we were missing right in the places we didn't think to look for them. Definitely recommend this movie.",1511481600,2,527,4.617021276595745
7513187,5,B017RR4YG4,Great Christmas movie. Not only does it have an amazing cast but it doesnt display a picture perfect family like a lot of cheesy Christmas movies do. It shows people in various stages of their lives and marriages and I thought it was refreshing to watch. It may not be for everyone but I could identify with a lot of the characters in the movie so I thoroughly enjoyed it.,1510876800,3,372,4.328571428571428
7513188,5,B017RR4YG4,A Christmas movie that isn't too cheesy!  Yay something to add to my regular holiday watch list.  Gave me the same feel as The Family Stone.,1510617600,,140,4.346153846153846
7513189,5,B017RR4YG4,"Not anything like your ""average"" or even really ""goofy"" holiday flick.  This one has enough quirkiness, levity and some cringe moments here and there, to be surprisingly intriguing.  It's just unpredictable enough at some junctures to make you ponder the outcome as well.",1510358400,2,271,5.27906976744186

7513223,4,B017RR4YG4,"Putting it all out there, I do love these types of movies. Ensemble casts that eventually all come together as one big crossover story. Some are done very well and some fall flat as any pancake you have ever seen. The Coopers....successful on every level. Funny, poignant, dramatic, deep and just plain entertaining. Silly and outrageous at times we meet and learn about this family which includes all the eccentricities our own families exhibit at many holidays. Love the story and the direction and how can you not love this cast...John Goodman, Alan Arkin, Ed Helms, Diane Keaton, Anthony Mackie etc. all are sensational, my favorite bit is Olivia Wilde meeting a soldier in between flights to action and their talks and conversation. He may be Ed Helms.",1501372800,2,757,4.921875

7513314,4,B017RR4YG4,"This movie made me laugh and left me with an overall good feeling.  Nowadays, that's a LOT for a Christmas movie, trust me!  If you liked The Family Stone, you will probably enjoy this movie, as well (both movies even have Diane Keaton in them; what a coincidence)!  This movie is somewhat amusing and emotional in a ""chick flick"" sort of  way that's hard to find any more.  The style is a little weird  (who's narrating?  Well, you'll find out!).  The movie consists of many different stories eventually blended into one - so you never actually feel bored while you are watching.  And yes...you will chuckle.  Maybe not laugh out loud...but you probably will chuckle.

Now...a word of warning.....the little girl will say something somewhere in the beginning of the movie which may turn you off!  It actually turned me off to the point where I just turned the whole MOVIE off.  However, the next day, I said,  ""What the heck...I'll give it another chance.""  So I did, and once you get beyond that particular THING (you will know it when you watch the movie), the film will be cute, quirky and watchable.  Is it perfect?  Of course not!  The Adam Arkin character befriending the super young waitress and bringing her home for Christmas?  Okay....weird.  Marissa Tomei and Diane Keaton portrayed as sisters (I believe Marissa is in her fifties and Diane Keaton is in her seventies)....that's a bit unbelievable, as well.  But....so what!  You just have to go for it.  (And the dog is adorable)!

For a low priced new Christmas film to add to your collection, I think this movie is definitely worth owning.",1487894400,,1604,4.728260869565218

It's a great, if contrived story full of a bunch of great performances. It is sentimental and tad bit sickly sweet, but it doesn't take itself seriously and pokes fun of that sweetness the whole time which in my opinion makes it all just great.

This is actually the worst Christmas movie I have ever seen. I caught it on Showtime and was so glad that I didn't pay for it since I couldn't even finish it.

You know, that awkward over-the-top neurotic Super MOM/WIFE that is so perfectly flawed but just because she has too much love for her family and that just blathers on and on and is center of every storyline? Well, if you can stomach her in that role again, jump on in and watch this baby. Every storyline in this movie is all about how others are reacting to ""HER"". God, would somebody please tell Hollywood that Keaton has passed her sell by date, and that pretending she could be a close-age-sister to with Marisa Tomei is delusional. A couple of the storylines were almost fun or interesting, but between Keaton and that sad narration - cause we're all more stupid than a dog and couldn't possibly figure out the oh-so subtle message - the overall movie was a dud.",1483228800,2,862,4.603896103896104

7514070,5,B017RR4YG4,"Classic Christmas movies have a magic that cant be manufactured, but Love the Coopers desperately tries to do just that. It employs a familiar conceit  dysfunctional family gathers for holiday meal  and enlists recognizable actors to deliver it, but the result plays like a collection of ideas and jokes borrowed from other movies. The film is occasionally amusing but rarely feels genuine.

Diane Keaton and John Goodman are Charlotte and Sam, a long-married couple waiting for their extended family to arrive for the big meal, at which they intend to announce that they're separating. We see the various family members making their way toward the gathering. Theres the son (Ed Helms) with the broken marriage, jobless and adrift. Theres Charlottes sister (Marisa Tomei), who is arrested while trying to shoplift a Christmas present. Theres a grandson (Timothe Chalamet) in the throes of romantic infatuation.

The thread that comes closest to being absorbing is played out by Olivia Wilde and Jake Lacy, whose characters do an opposites-attract dance after meeting at the airport. But the film, written by Steven Rogers and directed by Jessie Nelson, is too obviously manipulative. Its shameless appropriation doesnt help. There is, for instance, a folksy narration straight out of A Christmas Story, which is also raided for its dogs-disrupt-dinner-plans gag.

Love the Coopers wants to be as beloved as that movie and several others that it calls to mind, but its overwrought exchanges (especially between Charlotte and Sam) and efforts to push every emotional button in sight make it tedious, not tenderhearted.",1474848000,,1616,5.296875

Yes, it's your typical feel-good at the end Christmas movie, and you knew who was going to be together in the end, but it was still very nice.

There was no stable plot, and every character story (It's Love Actually style) was choppy--black & white. The narration added greatly to the choppiness. I think if the script focused on one storyline, rather than try to cram multiple, it would have been an okay movie.

To sum this movie up in a phrase "" What life would be like if the saddest most frustrated person you know wrote a screen play and ranted about all the things he never had and never understood and therefore consequently sought the comfort of sarcasm in the face of a love that deep down he recognized he would never know.

7514795,3,B017RR4YG4,"I was interested in Love the Coopers simply because it has such a great and large cast, but ultimately a lot of the actors are underused, the movie apart from the Amanda Seyfried (Waitress) and Alan Arkin (creepy old man customer), was predictable and pretty much the standard family that's grown apart, stubborn I'm never going to change and I'm not doing anything wrong and I don't really like the way you treat me family members.  I found it confusing as to who was who in the family tree, ""oh is that Diane Keaton's sister, I thought that was her daughter"" and thoughts like this occurred from time to time.  The most time and easiest to follow storyline was the fake relationship, between the daughter who was in a relationship with a married man and the army guy who gets stuck at the airport.  The robot policeman and shoplifter one seemed to have the longest ride to the police station ever.  I understand why an old man would want the attention of a young beautiful waitress, as you do see these sort of customers in any customer service environment who don't understand the staff member is being nice and talking to them only because it's their job, and never get that the staff member does whatever they can to minimise interaction with them as a customer.  But I didn't understand why no one in the kitchen wouldn't have told the old man to get out, or why on earth she would go to the old man's family dinner.  Would have also made more sense if she'd hooked up with the army guy, instead of the old man's son who was also a generation older than her, especially since she didn't seem to care to much what city she lived in.

7516058,5,B017RR4YG4,"I didn't go into this one expecting much.  The Hallmark Channel saturates the airwaves with trite cookie cutter holiday romances.  The big screen is full of dysfunctional, or worse, profane exercises set during yuletide represented this year by ""The Night Before"" and ""Krampus"".  I was expecting ""The Family Stone"" redux but ""Love the Coopers"" offered so much more.  The basic setup is the extended Cooper family is in crisis mode.  Dad Sam (John Goodman) and Mom Charlotte (Diane Keaton) are ready to throw in the towel after forty years of less than wedded bliss but are going to pull out all the stops for one last memorable Christmas.  Son Hank (Ed Helms)  in the throes of a recent divorce and loss of employment is determined to get presents for his kids.  Daughter Eleanor (Olivia Wilde) is currently in a romantic entanglement with a married man and is cynical about ever being in a meaningful relationship.  Most poignant of all is Grandpa Bucky (Alan Arkin) has a platonic friendship with a sweet young waitress Ruby (Amanda Seyfried) who is mulling going to the West Coast.  This film is a lot like life in that not all predicaments are magically resolved but epiphany is possible.  Director Jessie Nelson has a flavorful approach to the material which serves screenwriter Steven Rogers humanistic narrative to a tee.  There isn't a false note or a bad performance in the bunch.  I'd also like to note a terrific performance by Jake Lacy as a G.I. Eleanor meets in an airport bar.  The reason this is notable is that straight arrows like this are usually mocked but here he is given a certain nobility.

Here's a hint hollywood....., People want to be entertained,  lifted up and inspired... they don't want to be insulted for their world view or political beliefs they don't want to be lectured to and they certainly  don't want to watch you work out your therapy session in a film you're charging them to see.

7516083,4,B017RR4YG4,"This film had a great deal of potential, and it almost made it. The ending was so unbelievable, but there you are. Most of the film was fun.

The holidays and families, the parents of this family, Diane Keaton and John Goodman, want one more Christmas before they divorce. After forty years, love has gone, maybe. We meet the dog, who narrates this film with Steve Martin's voice. Next, comes the family, Ed Helm, the son, who is out of work, his wife has left him. They share custody of three children, and,by the way, the children seem normal, good kids, really. June Squibb, one of my favorite older actor plays forgetful Aunt Fishy. Olivier Wilde plays the daughter who does not live up to her own expectations, and she finds a man to play her boyfriend for Christmas. Marisa Tomei, Diane Keaton's sister, who also finds herself single and unhappy. She is picked up by a policeman played by Anthomy Mackie who has big issues of his own. Then dad,grandfather played by Arkin, who brings home a waitress who is 50 years younger than he is, played by Amanda Sigfried. This is the group, and it is a really interesting Christmas. The actors shine, the script and plot do not, but somehow, the film is fun up,to a point.

When four generations come together nothing ever goes smooth. What seems like hosting and attending a simple dinner becomes an adventure for everyone involved and lives and loves are begun, tested, and ended. There really isn't a whole lot to say about this movie. Mainly because it is just so much fluff and very formulaic. On the other hand, it was pretty much what I was expecting. This is a movie with the same feel as It's Complicated, Something's Gotta Give, Big Wedding, and other movies like that. This is a type of movie you can just pop in and relax as you watch. Not having to think or stress about. Those are good sometimes, but those aspects do not necessarily make a good movie.

7516123,5,B017RR4YG4,"I wrapped up my holiday by seeing this movie for the second time last Sunday, the last day of the New Year weekend holiday. I enjoyed it even more the second time around. No, it's not a silly, campy romp like Jingle All The Way or Christmas With The Kranks. It's a movie for adults. But it also had a surprising amount of heart. Diane Keaton and John Goodman are in fine form as the matriarch and patriarch of a family assembling for Christmas. She wants one final big family Christmas before they break the news that they are breaking up. He doesn't feel good about hiding it from the grown kids, and neither really wants the break up, deep down. But the whole family has a lot to work through - secrets, disappointments, new beginnings, etc. The holidays do tend to bring out everything that's wrong with our lives into the wide open. and how the family comes together and works through all their issues is real, yet touching and endearing. It's a story of how the holidays can work a little magic in your life, if you let them. And as a bonus, it's all set to an absolutely killer soundtrack, including Bob Dylan, Sting, Alison Kraus and Robert Plant, a sweet Christmas standard sung by Keaton and Goodman, and a Nina Simone cover of one of my all time favorite songs ever recorded, the Bee Gees classic To Love Somebody. When this comes out on blu-ray, it's going into the collection, and will become a perennial favorite.",1452038400,6,1426,4.4884615384615385

7516125,4,B017RR4YG4,"The Movie Review by Andy McKinney
Love the Coopers
  At this time of year we can expect to have an ensemble cast dramatic comedy involving the complications of modern family life at Christmas time.  This years entry to that category is ""Love the Coopers"" which has leaned more to the dramatic side, granted with some make you smile moments.
 The clan unites at the home of grandma and grandpa (Diane Keton and John Goodman), a couple married for over 40 years and whose commitment to and toleration for marriage has just about run out.  Ed Helms plays their son, a not successful but nice divorced father.  Marisa Tormei comes in as the younger sister of grandma.  Alan Arkin fills great grandpa's shoes, the ancient but still lucid elder of the clan who has a fascination with a very young waitress, Amanda Seyfried.  Olivia Wilde is another daughter, a free spirit.  All of them have fairly serious problems that we watch play out with various degrees of cringing or sympathy.
 Also note worthy are Anthony Mackie as a policeman working on Christmas Eve and Jake Lacy, a new to me actor who plays Joe, a solider on leave weather bound at the airport.  Lots of good actors gives a film a running start at excellence and this one has loads of very good actors.
 We have a look at two styles of sibling rivalry.  The first involves the brothers of the fourth generation, a 15ish jerk in the throws of adolescent angst and his adoring much younger brother.  The second and much more serious happens between the grandma (Keton) and her younger sister (Tormei), a decades long series of slights and misunderstandings.  These people, like all of us, are imperfect, flawed, often not entirely rational but always always with a capacity for great love.
 And that makes the movie for me.  In the tangled twine ball of the story we have four separate love stories going on.  The loutish teen summons up the juice to make a move on a girl teen of his desire.  This makes for an appallingly awkward and inept romance that will remind us all of that time in our own lives.  A tiny whisper of romance is just enough to round out and deepen the characters of the divorced dad (Helms) and the troubled young waitress (Seyfried).  Seyfried manages to wonderfully play her role with very little dialog, a tough job done well.  Keton and Goodman, the long married couple, depict the anguish of those who, after a lifetime together, may just be falling out of love.  But the best thing, the thing that makes the film for me is the relationship between the free spirit daughter (Wilde) and the chance met soldier (Lacy).  Wow, does that ever work.  Wilde, in her fourth film of 2015, is magical and enchanting.  Lacy plays the soldier with a laid back, mid west kind of calm decency that we know exists but we rarely see in a Hollywood film.  They are polar opposites who find the mutual attraction un-resistible.  They do try to resist, they just can't.  Wilde and Lacy make us believe in love at first sight with such ease that we say ""of course"".
 Director Jessie Nelson has a good record in making movies that tug at our heartstrings.  He has directed the heart-warmers ""I am Sam"", ""Stepmom"" and ""The Story of Us"".  He manages to tell all the stories in the film without either leaving anyone behind or getting them jumbled.  The script comes from the computer of Steven Rogers.  Rogers has the imagination to invent strong characters and the skill to bring them to the semblance of actual human life.  His past efforts in the same vain include ""Stepmom"" and ""P.S. I Love You"".
 The performance by Olivia Wilde pushed this one into the superior four saw blade range.  It runs for one hour and 47 minutes while carrying a mild PG-13 rating.  Made on a prudent $17 million budget (does that shock you?  A 17 million dollar budget called prudent?) it grossed around $23 million over the three day opening weekend.  It will do well financially as it should.  This would be a good date movie, even for married people.",1449446400,16,3996,4.603399433427762

7516127,3,B017RR4YG4,"Over the past decade, we've seen a recent phenomenon in film, where producers cast many big names in a clip film, that all comes together in the end. While this may work well with superheroes, it has yet to be successful in regards to comedy. That is why the film, Love The Coopers can be defined with one saying, too many cooks in the kitchen. This film features a large and impressive cast, and the previews looked terrific, but I assure you, Ed Helm's little girl calling him a dick, is just about the only truly funny moment in this film. The story here has a lot of different angles, and they do come together quite nicely, but this film is not what it was intended to be, as the last thing I would refer to it as is a hilarious holiday film. A lot of people are going to see this film because of it's cast, and from young Timothee Chalamet to veteran Alan Arkin, this cast is remarkable, however the story is not, in fact this whole film was fairly dull. I expect a lot from the cast, but even Hollywood's best and brightest can't make a film work when the writing just isn't there. I love the concept and I really wanted to like this film, but in the end it's just a big disappointment.",1448668800,5,1193,4.2368421052631575

To me this is not a comedy. Despite all the effort and good intentions and memories of bringing up a family, the kids will grow up , leave you and, yes, no matter how much you tried and how well prepared you think you were, life will give them all kind of surprises, and they will be bruised. Seems raising kid is such a lost purpose here.. If they donot appreciate the life they are living, what can we do?

The last part, when the grandpa sitting on the bed, having flashbacks of the youth days of his late wife, is definitely heart wrenching for every parent. So much beauty, love and efforts are lost in time and memory.",1534291200,,876,4.2395209580838324
