8166973,5,B000M7XR8S,"You cant go wrong with any Jet Li Movies. This one is one of my Martial Arts favorite, since it's very realistic, and you can appreciate the amazing martial arts moves! As the story develops, Jet Li is the real under-cover chinese Bushido Sensei and takes on the whole gang of corrupted French cops in order to save face.

Highly recommended to all! The supporting actress, Bridget Fonda does an expectacular performance in her role and deserves an academy award from Hollywood!  We need to see Fonda in more movies!",1219449600,,516,4.722222222222222
