He brought a college golf team to the course where I was playing. A true gentleman. Hope this comes out on DVD as I was not able to find it in that format.",1367539200,,324,4.158730158730159
8029319,5,B0002MGZQO,"The video provides an excellent disucssion of Harvey Penick's teaching techniques.  Two of his golf great students, Ben Crenshaw and Tom Kite, discuss and provide detailed illustrations of various aspects of Penick's approach.  This video is an excellent companion to The Little Red Video as well as Penick's Little Red Book.",1264291200,,325,5.352941176470588
8029320,5,B0002MGZQO,"A simple guide, at least for the beginner because that's what I am. I can understand and practice the drills anywhere and I am looking forward to putting them to use for real this summer. I understand video demonstrations better than the written word. This is as enjoyable as it gets. Anything that involves Harvey Penick is a great teaching aid.",1238457600,,346,4.688524590163935
8029321,5,B0002MGZQO,"Forget all the slick tips and hype.  This little gem is my one source for golf understanding, practice, and getting back to fundamentals.  I've had this tape for about 15 years.  Every time I go back and watch it I re-learn something important that I've let slip my mind.

I am convinced that studying this one tape, over and over till you're sick of it, will instill an inner confidence that when you venture out to the course, you will actually know and understand what the hell you're doing!

Thanks Harvey!",1181260800,5,510,4.56043956043956
