BUT, its the kinda thing that you don't want to pay blu-ray prices (and in most cases MORE than blu-ray) to have. Because their simply is just not enough in it.

And by the way it lies, this DOES NOT include the reading of the guts story

The real docu is only an hour and thirty minutes and a suprising amount doesnt have chuck even in it.

And there is very little in the second disc - they could have easily just made it one disk.

Bottomline this is the kind of thing you just watch on the internet for free - and if you get the chance to watch it than do so but DONT pay full price - don't pay anything over seven dollard",1262217600,11,801,3.9565217391304346
8167698,2,B000MBZ37C,"This was actually rather disappointing. If you have to own everything that chuck has out there then you will want this, but otherwise you're really not missing much.
Most of the DVD is about the college were they had chuck up for a weekend. Most of the video was awkward interviews with people I really cared nothing about, and there was really only a sprinkling of some cool speaking from Chuck.
The other thing was that they advertised video footage of one of the readings were people passed out from hearing the graphic story. This was also a bust, and the video footage they had was incomplete.
I have to admit, I wouldn't buy it again. And definitely not for full price.",1260144000,8,675,4.540983606557377
