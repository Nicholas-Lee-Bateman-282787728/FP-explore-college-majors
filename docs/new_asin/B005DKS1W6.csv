4660793,5,B005DKS1W6,"I am a giant fan of the silent film work of Buster Keaton. As of this writing, I have not gotten around to watching the two features included in this set, but I have watched several of the harder to find shorts. The picture and film quality is crisp. The music is appropriate. This set is an excellent value. It's recommended for Buster Keaton fans such as myself, -- I had some Keaton video that I lost to floods-- or to film fans who have not yet experienced Buster Keaton.",1357689600,,475,4.288888888888889

8467013,1,B005DKS1W6,The Best of Buster Keaton by S'more Entertainment are comprised of public domain films which have not been enhanced in any way and even the music if from the old public domain source.  Well S'more Entertainment tried but the best choice would be the shorts released by Kino.,1400889600,6,274,4.708333333333333
