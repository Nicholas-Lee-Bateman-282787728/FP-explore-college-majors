8249806,5,B0013CZTNC,"I have had the pleasure of meeting Mesmera a couple of times and was thrilled when I got to take a seminar class under her.  I have never seen a dancer of this quality using the zills like she does.  Having decided to take up the art again I searched for anything instructive by her.  If you want to learn to use these finger cymbals to rev up your dance, this is a must have item.  I've watched it several times already and the old muscle memory is starting to function.  She is such a delight to take instruction from.  This is not only about how to use the zills, but also shows how to incorporate them into your dance moves...and she covers a lot of moves and different styles of music and beat counts.  Whether you are a beginner or you just want to fine tune the technique, this is a great find.",1366070400,,801,4.162337662337662
