8153729,4,B000K0YLXW,"I found this to be a very fun little film. It's shot with a 16 millimeter camera, and while that may seem too low budget for some, I thought it served the story well. The border between the U.S. and Mexico is shot beautifully too and the sun is used regularly to help light the film.

The movie is about a musician who gets mixed up in a heist and is forced to flee the country to escape the people he ripped off. Meanwhile, one of his partners in the heist is using the opportunity to try and steal the musician's wife. The rest of the movie is about the wife's search for the musician.

The score was really great and I thought the acting seemed natural, although uneven at best. This movie looked like a student film, but the best kind of student film that you can find.",1467331200,,773,4.181208053691275
8153730,3,B000K0YLXW,"I understand what they're going for but it doesn't quite reach the level of noir or engagement I hoped. It looks great & there are several good scenes, but overall the film student level script & acting keep me at arm's length. It seems much more dated than I expected. I'm a big fan of John Doe & LA bands referenced, but more often than not the charm of non-actors doesn't carry the meandering storyline and weak script. Great to see/hear a brief glimpse of Green On Red performing. Ultimately just doesn't have consistent weight or impression.",1452988800,,546,4.639175257731959
8153731,4,B000K0YLXW,"I don't know anything about this movie, other than my current tenant was in it, so I ordered it for him for Christmas. He was very excited about me finding it.",1387843200,,159,4.161290322580645
8153732,4,B000K0YLXW,"I first came across Border Radio on late one night on AMC and I decided to buy a copy. For a very low budget film, shot in 16-mm, black and white, the story has a lot to say and captures a bygone era!",1382572800,,200,3.6744186046511627
8153733,4,B000K0YLXW,"My taste in music runs from Vivaldi to Bach and back again.  Ok, with a little detour for Leonard Cohen.  I haven't listened to pop music (do they still call it that?) since the Eagles.  And LA is a place I try to avoid at all costs.  So it would seem that this isn't a film for me.

The first few minutes had me convinced of that idea. But, for some reason...maybe because I do like Mexico...I got into it.  There are some beautiful, lyrical shots, especially in Mexico that are almost poetic.  I liked a lot of the music, too.  The acting was funny; you could tell that these folks were improvising. The story picked up and I grew fond of the characters, especially Chris,

I have to say that I ended up liking it a lot.  Don't really know why ...probably because it was a labor of love.",1278892800,2,789,4.2
8153734,5,B000K0YLXW,"amazing cinematography, beautiful shots and locations, and interesting plot.  i like this film more so for those great shots and improved scenes, but all around i loved it.",1227744000,2,172,5.142857142857143
