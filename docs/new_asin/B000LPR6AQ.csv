8163302,1,B000LPR6AQ,"When I first saw this at the library I was really excited to watch it.  I'd never seen any stand-up by Groucho, and Redd Foxx on Sanford & Son always cracked me up.  This was such a huge disappointment!  Groucho did a short standup during which he was painfully obviously reading his jokes off the teleprompter (which were not that funny to begin with, and made worse by the poor craftsmanship).  His Q & A had a few funny moments, but not funny like a professional comedian; more funny like you might chuckle at a witty shoe salesman.

Redd's episode was better and was at least funny.  But it still seemed more like someone practicing a bunch of jokes in a row, rather than a polished routine.",1280102400,3,695,4.433070866141732

8163304,5,B000LPR6AQ,"This DVD is two episodes of TV show called ""One Man Show.""

The show seems to be early 1970s or late 1960s.

Foxx (shown pre-Sanford and Son) does some great material on many subjects (including race.) Pretty G rated stuff, which is fun to see from a notoriously raunchy comic.

Groucho doesn't really inspire lots of laughs during a monolouge about his daily routine, but is rather funny as he takes questions from the audience.
Each episode is about 30 minutes long.

The DVD also has about 10 minutes of footage of a much younger Marx on the TV show Hollywood Palace.",1207094400,5,570,4.5588235294117645
