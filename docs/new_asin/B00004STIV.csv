7921935,4,B00004STIV,"Mars: The Red Planet Collection (1999)- I especially enjoyed the special entitled ""Life on Mars"" which discussed the first possible manned mission to mars with animations, models, actors and full scale sets. This fully described and illustrated one potential approach requiring sending a combination fuel generating plant and return module to the planet prior to sending a crew to Mars on a direct landing vehicle.

in Addition, certain exterior scenes appear to have been shot in the dessert with a red filter and actors wore good representations of a martian space suit. While not totally up to date this film provided a good representation of one possible means of making the first manned martian landing.",1240444800,,708,5.156521739130435
