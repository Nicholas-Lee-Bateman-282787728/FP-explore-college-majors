The tin that the movies came in was bent and cannot close.  For the price you get what you pay for.",1457481600,2,268,3.75

These twenty movies have a few silent films from the 1920s. Some are found on other collections (such as those 50 pack collections). All are in monochrome. Silent movies (#) were made before 1929, the newer ones also have higher quality. Disc 1 has two 25 minute episodes from his 1950's TV show. Some of these older movies have a loss of video quality; they have an organic base that ages. Hitchcock could scare an audience but reassure them it would turn out alright.

The 39 Steps came from a famous novel by John Buchan (who had an interesting career). It pointed out that Britain was no longer isolated from the Continent. The plot was used a number of times (innocent man pursued by both the police and the criminals). One was called North by Northwest. The Man Who Knew Too Much was also reproduced. The last version (not by Hitchcock) was called Foul Play. Sabotage came from a novel by Joseph Conrad, The Secret Agent. Europe then was threatened by terrorists bombs, much like today. The Secret Agent came from the novel Ashenden by Somerset Maugham.

There is also a bonus feature on this disc including trailers for his classic films though none here and a documentary style.

I felt the trailers should have been for the films shown here. The documentary was an old one that focused little on the films here. This collection would make a great present for a Hitchcock fan and a must for film students studying film in college.",1385683200,17,2270,5.191256830601093
