2493032,1,B000E5N69S,"Ok,first of all let me say that i am not a zombie hater. I love zombie movies. I loved dawn of the dead (the old and new). Day of the dead, return of the living dead etc. But, this is not an improvement from the first. If you hated part 1 you will be disgusted with this one. And if you loved the first one then you will me disapointed in this one. There is a very good reason this one was not released nation wide in theaters. Not, that that would make it good but, i think they had a damn good reason they didn't waste any time with this one. Don't waste your money and if you don't mind you can watch it on regular T.V. That is if you would like to lose 2 hrs of your life you will never get back.",1140048000,,700,3.8013698630136985
2493033,5,B000E5N69S,"I never feel compelled to write a review for any movie, but I have to put in a good word for this one. The writers and director really did a great job at piecing together all of the details regarding the House of the Dead storyline that Uwe Boll really threw off track. The Sci-Fi channel showed this movie right after Resident Evil and I have to say that House of the Dead and House of the Dead 2 stay closer to the actual storyline of the game they are based on than the Resident Evil movies have. As a video game movie, House of the Dead 2 really stays true to its franchise.

The writers threw the AMS in there and even addressed Professor Curien's storyline as best as possible, considering how Uwe Boll had set it up. They even used only two main characters, Alex and Ellis, who are clearly the essense of player 1 and player 2. All that was missing was G, the ever-present character of the House of the Dead series.

Lots of clichs in this one but if you're a hardcore gamer who knows the House of the Dead series, pick this one up because it really does the game some justice.",1139875200,4,1084,4.206730769230769
2493034,3,B000E5N69S,"On one hand House of the Dead 2 is better than the original...on the other hand, the first was absolutely horrible so it's not much of an accomplishment.  Still for a Sci-Fi channel movie it wasn't a terrible zombie film, I've certainly seen much worse.  It's a pretty loose tie to the first film and instead of the island, the action takes place on a college campus that has been overrun by zombies.  A team of special ops forces goes to the lab on this campus to retrieve a blood sample from the first zombie in order to try an develop a cure for the virus.

The acting by and large is OK for a TV movie.  I do have to say one very big reason to watch is for the very beautiful Emanuelle Vaugier who plays one of the Team's leaders Alex.  Vaugier is gorgeous and was seen recently in a few episodes of Two and a Half Men and also a couple of years ago on Smallville as Lex Luthor's love interest.  While none of the actors are really household names they are all experienced and most of the main characters have appeared in dozens of TV episodes or films.  A far cry from the hacks in the first film.  Look for Sid Haig in a small role.

Unfortunately the actors were saddled with a dumb script that has them do dumb things and say dumb things.  Add to that it is highly derivative of the Resident Evil films. There's the one black member of the Ops Team who constantly thinks he's finding a surving student only to be attacked by a zombie.  The zombies are quite different too.  In the first they ran fast and jumped like gymnasts...here they are traditional, Romero-type zombies who move slow and are weak.  The make-up and effects were decent...I've seen much worse and none of that stupid video game footage intercut.

For a Saturday night, nothing to do movie, it wasn't so bad.",1139788800,2,1785,4.3343373493975905
2493035,3,B000E5N69S,"When a movie skips a theatrical release and is deposited on the Scifi channel for its premiere, many would instantly think, horrible movie. I admit that I was one of those people, yet late last night I was bored and watched the movie with an open mind...I mean, it couldn't be worse than the first film right?

Much to my surprise, it was actually a decent zombie flick. Yes, there is bad acting...yet even ""classic"" zombie flicks like night of the living dead and dawn of the dead(78) weren't known for thier acting. This film actually stays close to the premise of the games(an evil corp wants a sample of the zombies in an attempt to create an immortality drug)and is fun to watch.

The makeup effects are top notch...almost up there with tom savini's best work. The CGI effects...well...thats another thing. If this had been given a theatrical release lions gate would have given more money for the effects.

Finally...I like how this film pokes fun at the older film...there is a scene in the movie where one of the characters summarizes the events of the first film...and the response to that is amazing. Its worth a view just to see how these filmmakers stick it to the director of the previous film.",1139702400,,1207,4.630841121495327
2493036,1,B000E5N69S,"Don't buy this movie!!!  I hate to say it but I think I actually like the first one better, and I'd rather get torn to pieces by a gut muncher than have to watch that poor excuse for a movie again.  It's pretty sad when Dr. Uwe can make a better movie than you.  I so wanted for this movie to be good, I was so excited to see it.  I read a couple behind the scenes snipets around the web saying the director knew how bad the first one was and was gonna make sure HOTD 2 was better.  Well unfortunatly I trusted the guy, and he let me down.  First of all don't think to yourself that Sid Haig is gonna save the movie, he only has a bit part in the very beginning of the movie as some mad scientist guy trying to bring the dead to life.  Anyway, the story is about an outbreak at some college campus, & there's this super secret squad of Zombie hunters(I guess Zombies are a big enough threat that the US needs an Anti Zombie Squad-I don't get it either)led by non other than a legless ""Lesbo"" Casper from the first movie(Ya, I thought she died too, if they were gonna bring a character back from the first movie; why her?).  Anyway, if the Zombie squad can find the original zombie from the outbreak they can make a vaccine.  Whatever, why is it so hard for people to make a descent zombie movie?  It seems like a pretty simple equation to me, and really hard to screw up, but apparently not judging by some of the crap thats been coming out lately(Day Of The Dead 2, Zombiez, Children Of The Dead ETC).  As much as I love Zombie movies, I almost wish they'd stop making them unless they're gonna make a good one, Land Of The Dead was awesome(of couse ""GAR"" is the master), 28 Days was good, Shaun was one of the best movies ever captured on film, and the new ""Dawn"" was even pretty good.  Hollywood, pay attention to these movies, look at what works, you don't have to try to reinvent the genre, it's just fine as is, you're just ruining it for the rest of us.  Please don't ruin Return Of The Living Dead 4 & 5 I'm willing to forgive for 3.  If you're a Zombie movie lover like me stay away from this movie, consider yourself warned!!!!",1138060800,11,2137,4.142857142857143
2493090,3,B000E5N69S,"Not a good movie, but it takes itself so seriously that you have to laugh.  Its full of terrible tropes, bad cut aways, ridiculous action sequences and other insane effects.  Uwe Boll himself released a director's commentary where he riffed the film.  But in that you find the redeeming quality that it's so absurd its comedy.  The overacting, particularly from Captain Kirk, is amazing.

2493144,2,B000E5N69S,"I guess there's some college pranks that may entertain people still in college and give it some comedy value. That's the good.

The bad? Everything in the movie was unreal and stupid.

This is called ""HOUSE of the Dead II"", but there's no house - it happens across a college campus.

If I was special forces, I'd be pissed at this movie. They have a short fat man that talks non-stop, not just joking around in the barracks, but in combat. He fools around in combat and cries like a baby. The sergeant had an M-16 clip that fired triple digit rounds on full auto. One of them was a ghoul that liked to take pictures of naked female zombies and was trying to sell out his country. Really makes them seem incompetent and treasonous, which isn't true.

They always make stupid decisions, they never seem to kill soldiers that get bit and it always ""bites"" them in the end.

Special Forces works with ""A-M-S"", which stands for something, not sure what. It doesn't have periods, so it's not an acronym. Maybe it's a flower company, who knows... Their ""armor"" is less than goalie gear and leaves their necks and shoulders exposed, which is kind of where everyone gets bit. Might as well go out naked except for steel toed shoes and a tattoo that says ""bite me here"" on their necks for all the protection their ""armor""  gave them. They said they didn't need special forces from the start. I guess the 2 of them, and that's all of A-M-S from what I saw, could take on an entire campus of several thousand zombies.

They take the first zombie captured away in a bread truck that says ""A-M-S"" (which is a good easy way to advertise your secret government funded zombie killing squad). He's on a stretcher. They shoot him  through the head, straight down to the gas tank, but the movie isn't based on Earth logic, so the truck doesn't explode. They get covered with brains and blood, dressed in formal wear, so that leads to the shower scene. They couldn't place a pillow over its face or use an ice pick in his eye or something?

They take a luxuriously slow shower, complete with meaningless conversation drivel, after the first zombie bite, so that means there's 1,000 more zombies now. They never get the concept of time. Anytime something happens, someone gets bit or whatever, this always leads to 5 minutes of conversation that would never happen in the real world. A cruise missile with a tactical nuke is incoming and that doesn't speed them up AT ALL. They still have a minute to watch a zombie eat someone or have more insane conversation. This was more of a ""conversation "" movie and might do better classified under the genre of drama (or maybe even insane drama).

2 AMS people are getting shot at by kids that think they're zombies. They say ""It's ok, we're AMS"". Do random college kids know what this secret government zombie extermination unit is? Really?

They're looking for patient zero and got her blood (in the stupidest way, of course), but only got one vial and lost it. Maybe there were budget cuts and they didn't want to waste money on the second vial? They took it from the zombie while still kicking and biting - Why not blow her head off and then take it? They got another and lost it as well. They never called in with radio and say they'd gotten patient zero blood and been choppered out - that would make too much sense (and choppers are expensive to producers). There was never a metal container that went around the glass vial of blood - that would make too much sense.

The zombies ""evolved"" to second generation to eat through armor (the cheesy plastic stuff). All the early zombies were killed, and all the second generation zombies were also killed, so there's no real ""survival of the fittest"" evolution going on here.

Weapons? Stupid. If I were a zombie hunter, I'd get storm trooper armor, a .22 caliber handgun with a billion rounds of ammunition and a bayonet (I looked it up - they exist) and a samurai sword. They had shotguns and rifles. Why use heavy caliber, when they ALWAYS run out of ammunition (which is why a zombie movie should have a sword). A katana from Cold Steel would be nice. Hey, Amazon sells them and you directors should check them out :)

Are Zombie scenes expensive to film? Probably not, I was an extra in a failed zombie movie as a kid, so not why not give viewers what they want and have lots of zombie scenes? Zombie movies should just be mindless entertainment, not so annoying that you spend your time making lists of how much the movie sucked to write a review. This was more of a soap opera of insanity than a zombie movie.

I wish I could give it 2 1/2 stars, for the college pranks, but I guess I'm limited to giving it 2.",1446940800,,4689,4.47423887587822

2493175,1,B000E5N69S,"**POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT**

I'm a fan of video game movies and while I wasn't expecting much, I thought it would be somewhat okay. I was wrong.

A group of elite ""Special Forces"" with a few special agents from A M S (some sort of zombie research company) go to a college dorm where the infection started to get a sample of patient 0. The SF soldiers were pretty dumb, and resembled nothing of real soldiers. They stunk. They literally walked right into the zombies and got themselves killed.

There is a part where the agents get trapped in a room with the zombies trying to bust down the door. The plan was to crawl through the vent....but for some reason they can't use their shotgun to blow the vent opening, or heck, even kick it in. One of the agents decides to cover himself in organs and blood from a dead zombie they killed so he can go out and break down the vent from the other side. Really?

So they get the sample, escape, and then at the last moment a zombie snatches it from his belt as they are escaping from a truck. It is announced that in 14 minutes a cruise missile will be taking out the campus. However, they decide to argue a bit about going back, it's decided. They go back, go down a football field battling zombies, into the scene I mentioned above, get back into the lab, get another sample, run away, battle another heard of zombies, and the damn missile still hasn't arrive. Finally the missile arrives and only the male special agent jumps out of the building as the missile is coming down, but the girl got stuck back battling the zombies.

He heads back to the truck only to find a dbag SF soldier who needed a sample because he chopped his hand off after being bit by a mosquito. Somehow the special agent girl escaped a cruise missile and a mass pile of zombies on here shows up just go shoot him. But the SF soldier drops a grenade and the sample is destroyed.

Next it shows the city all destroyed and the movie ends.

2493176,4,B000E5N69S,"Campy but fun. Lots of T&A, as you can expect with it set on a college campus. Definitely not academy award material or even TWD material but good movie for a boring Saturday with some pizza and beer.  Basic plot has a mad scientist unleashing a zombie apocalypse via unauthorized experiments on a college campus, and a team of special agents and special forces operators go in to retrieve a blood sample from Patient Zero. Along the way there is madness, mayhem, betrayal and tropes galore. Some of the special forces operators are right out of central casting to the point of being absurd. If accuracy matters you will be ripping your hair out. (Since when does the Lt take orders from the Sgt ?) Some stupidity just boggles the mind - for example if you have to retrieve a blood sample essential to saving the world before an air strike why wouldn't you draw multiple samples and distribute them to multiple team members and perhaps store them in something less fragile than a glass test tube. For that matter why wouldn't you bring more than one radio so your not incommunicado when the radio is destroyed.

But this movie dosent take its self serously after abit in the movie youll notice that the special forces team are just more focused on getting out of there and can tell they just won't to leave from there they get the blood sample but the twisted soilder at the end gets shot and pulls a grenade and the blood sample is destroyed at the end it comes down to just the 2 ams members get in a old ford f-150 pickup truck and go into a city thats been taken over by the dead and there the movie ends bascially the zombies are takeing over the world...

In this movie the zombies are the slow moving class zombies. But, ""some"" know how to run. These zombies are evolving based on what the movie said. This is the first time I ever heard a movie have their zombies evolved during a movie, so I must say that's new! Also, it's kind of strange that they would evolved because they're dead.

This movie has it's typical boobs and hot girls in, but there's not much of it. Also, it's right in the beginning of the movie, if that's all you care about.

I like the main two stars, they did the casting right for those two main roles. Everyone else was so-so.

The 1st movie was better because it had a higher budget and had more special effects, graphics, and filming, but the story wasn't as good. This movie had a smaller budget and the movie effects were cheap and no graphics, but the story was much better!

I enjoyed the whole movie and the two main characters did a great job in acting. Indeed the movie is not perfect but it entertained me for 1 hours! I do not regret watching this! Zombies looked good, and acting overall was not bad.

Cons:
There is one scene when zombie came in a close up and soldier fell on the ground, losing his weapon and acting like a child. Spec ops, huh? Or every scene where the soldier guy makes photos wit dead naked women instead of continuing the mission. 2 more soldiers were with hi and did nothing. They all knew if the fraternity house would be bombed if they wouldn't get out soon. Interesting.
2 main heroes had 10 mins to go back into the fraternity house for another cure they lost. It was in reality taking 20+- mins of the movie. And the final scene when there was no way for a character to survive. Yet she survived the explosion from the air strike. That's so Hollywood actually, lol.
Burning fraternity house= very bad cgi.
No soundtrack in the titles.

I know I depicted a lot of negatives about the movie, but believe me I liked it none the less! And even a day after I still like it. Give it a chance it's a good movie. Don't expect it to be something like resident evil and you will enjoy it, or you might.

2493318,4,B000E5N69S,"""House of the Dead 2"" is an interesting film. What do you get when you cross aiming for a Romero-styled zombie movie with a ""made for Sci-Fi channel"" movie? Apparently you get this. ""House of the Dead 2"" has all the essentials that the first movie had: buckets of gore, lots of high-energy action scenes and those big, glorious t*ts hanging out here and there. Sure, it's not a fantastic zombie movie but it's quite good for low-budget entertainment.

The only real problems I had with this movie were the storyline and the ending. Not only was the plot minimalistic, but it was too one-dimensional for me, it felt as if the writers couldn't come up with enough material for sub-plots to really fill out the film. If they had maybe supplied one or two more minor storylines, the movie would have felt more complete. Also, this felt more like a military movie than a zombie movie, as if there wasn't a solid grasp on keeping the film from waning from its intended self. Finally, the ending was pretty awkward and left an odd tone for the conclusion to a movie. Not that many zombie movies are easy to end, if they're based on a massive outbreak at least, but regardless, the ending bugged me. Check this out if you want lots of thrills and bloodshed, but don't expect a brilliant storyline. Thanks for the time, and peace.",1319500800,,1321,4.550420168067227

It is now up to a team of soldiers and scientists to deal with the problem, and in the process to collect a sample of ""first generation"" zombie blood that might hold the key to a zombie vaccine.

The good news is that ""House of the Dead II"" is a vast improvement on the first ""House of the Dead"" film (and I didn't hate the first one). The script is, for the most part, way better, and ""House of the Dead"" director Uwe Boll (aka the worst director of all time) has been replaced by Mike Hurst. The first half hour of this film is absolutely hilarious: a woman goes on a blind date and to her date's dismay, turns out to be a zombie hunter; soldiers are using photos of Paris Hilton for target practice; and there is a good section of the film devoted to essentially making fun of college students. Once the military gets in on the act, however, the film loses a lot of its sense of humour. That's not to say it becomes unwatchable. It's actually a pretty decent B-grade zombie film with lots of action and plenty of gore. It's only at the end where this film really falls down. I don't want to give away the ending, but suffice to say that it renders the film that went before it completely pointless. The film is enjoyable up until about 5 minutes before the end, which is why I gave it 3 stars, but the ending alone is enough to make me never want to see it again.",1242000000,2,1516,4.191780821917808

I mean, it could NOT get worse than the first one. Contains all the requisite gore and blood of a zombie movie, has a plot and the acting is not horrid. For a TV movie this is a pretty ok effort. Somewhat following what happened in the first movie, a team of special forces (for killing zombies) infiltrates a college campus believed to be ground zero for the zombie virus. Their mission is to obtain a blood sample from patient zero in order to create an antidote. The film explains how the first one ties in to the current story and we even get one of the characters from the first movie (who had allegedly died, guess not).

Emmanuelle Vaugier seemed to have created a new acting method: the tired acting. Somehow she always appeared bored and tired, in every scene. Victoria Pratt is always a nice addition to every sci-fi movie and her acting was better than all the other actors. The movie presented situations that proved to defy logic: from being surrounded by zombies and not getting a single scratch, to zombies being electrocuted, yet will not die by a shot in the heart, and finally, the end (without giving it away)...honestly, how does one survive?

2493355,2,B000E5N69S,"Dead Aim: House of the Dead 2 (Michael Hurst, 2005)

Uwe Boll did not direct House of the Dead 2. Thus, almost by default, the sequel had to be better than the original. However, they installed Michael Hurst, of Room 6 fame. You get what you pay for, I guess.

Hurst (who, along with directing these two dogs, also wrote the screenplays for Edward Gorsuch's The Butcher and the funniest Sci-Fi Original Movie of all time, Mansquito) makes a movie that's less a sequel to Uwe Boll's crapfest than a totally unrelated zombie movie, and that, I have to say, was a really good decision. In this flick, a virus strikes a university, turning some of its denizens into flesh-crazed zombies. (Note: Mike, you could have done a lot with the idea of fraternity house zombies. Just sayin'.) Enter AMS, a government agency not much liked by anyone, and a bunch of soldiers. Yes, you're thinking what I'm thinking, aren't you? I kept waiting for one of the soldiers to ask if they were going on another bug hunt. The twist here is that AMS believes it can develop a vaccine if they can get blood from the first zombie, so the team has to find that first zombie.

The requisite yumness is provided by horror veteran Emmanuelle Vaugier and My Name Is Earl beauty Nadine Velasquez, and the requisite cameo is provided by Sid Haig, and other than that, honestly, there's nothing much more to say. It's typical, standard fare that doesn't stand out in any way.

I don't know where they were going with the first movie because they just rushed it. There's no connection whatsoever between the movie and the three House of the Dead video games, maybe that wasn't their intention so I really didn't like the first one.

The second one also had no association with the video games but the style of the movie did resemble what we play in the arcades. There were a number of flaws in the movie but the biggest one that I thought was ridiculous was if humans are vunerable to infection by a zombie through bite or scratch, what about contact to zombie blood.

2493386,2,B000E5N69S,"Many reviewers have already said that `House of the Dead 2' is better - or marginally better -- than the awful original. I agree, but at the same time I actually thought while watching this sequel that this could be MUCH better than Uwe Boll's first one. Well, that feeling soon disappeared, however, about 20 minutes after the film began. Yes, the second `HOTD' is not good, if not worse than the original.

But what's wrong with the new one (this time directed by Michael Hurst)? `House of the Dead 2' does not take itself seriously, and you know that when it starts with `American Pie'-like silly antics by college students. Or how about `The Professor' plated by Sig Haig!? And the film says he is responsible for the zombies prowling in the university campus!

The film shows several ideas, and one of them is `zombie virus.' Of course, that's what Danny Boyle was doing in '28 Days Later' and this film clearly knows it, but the filmmakers gave a twist to that. That is, special forces are sent to the place in order to get a sample of the blood of the first `patient,' by which the scientists may make a serum, or anti-zombie vaccine. The basic plot is promising, but the film forgets it as it unfolds.

One sad thing is that thre are some nice touches in this film, but they need more budget or imagination. Special make-ups and actors' performances (including those of zombies) are decent, but the film as a whole looks like a series of familiar set-pieces borrowed from other better films. After all we have seen these soldiers shooting zombies in the head before getting bitten one after another so many times before, and we need something more than one sadistic guy taking a photo with a female zombie. There are some good ideas such as `geek' zombie or `librarian' zombie, which are few and far between in this half-baked film.

Probably the most damaging thing is the weak direction that makes the film's each scene neither intense nor comic enough. There are gores, but not much enough. Even nudities didn't impress me because of the lukewarm efforts to make us care. Surely this is far better than the original, but that is not saying much.",1165968000,6,2156,4.6214099216710185

The movie's flaws are far too numerous to mention and probably have been extolled on at length in various other posts. Believe the other reviewers, they are not exaggerating.

It certainly wasn't for wanting to see a sequel to the original ""House of the Dead"" which universally ranks as one of the most atrocious pieces ever committed to celluloid.  But while the original HOTD was such a train-wreck and so unbelievably bad that it became almost good in an Ed Wood kind of way, this second installment doesn't even have that going for it.  It's not good, it's not horrible, rather it's just mediocre in that straight-to-DVD horror cheapie kind of way.  But I digress.  I mean, what are we supposed to expect from a film like this?  At least HOTD 2, like all good zombie films should, offers blood, boobs and flying body parts aplenty.

A mad scientist (played by Sid Haig aka Captain Spaulding in an amusing cameo) is responsible for planting a zombie virus into a co-ed college chick.  29 days later, the university is completely overrun by the undead and it is up to an army platoon of zombie slayers to overrun the newly-minted zombie stronghold of Cuesta Verde University (CVU).  As the platoon make their way through the usual campus staples of hallways, classrooms, libraries and campus residences they find countless stiffs of the walking dead that they blast their way through.

The biggest disappointment I had with this film is them showing us the campus only after the zombies have overrun the place instead of during.  I would have loved to watch co-eds engage in various debaucheries while zombies crash their party but alas that is never to be seen.  Also, I found that the film seemed unsure as to what it wanted to be.  The whole zombie thing seemed often to be pushed to the background and the focus was placed on the army platoon, somewhat similarly to the Resident Evil films.  An army platoon of so-called professional zombie killers who barely know how to use their weapons I might add.  Who trained these guys?

Admittedly House of the Dead 2 does have some hilarious moments.  It has a certain tongue-in-cheek feel that reminded me of Romero's Dawn of the Dead, especially the football field scene where the commandos have to tackle their way through helmet-wearing zombies and zombie cheerleader babes still waving their pompons. Oh and let's not forget the scene where we see the female commandos changing in the same dressing room as the guys.  These scenes are somewhat effective in providing intentional laughs and to its credit the film doesn't abuse these scenes as to render the film total slapstick ridicule.

Look, no one will ever mistake this for a great or even good film.  It's a low budget straight-to-DVD cheapie that is short on ideas and common sense (even by zombie movie standards).  But darn, it gets to be pretty funny sometimes.  And kinda fun too, in a guilty pleasure kind of way.  Worth a rental, but only if you're a zombie fanatic.",1146787200,8,2984,4.670498084291188

Is it any wonder our nation is fast giving way to the perennial student, the Happy Slacker Warrior ambling his way through the undergraduate 12-Year-Plan, the Long March of doing zero and b*tching about The System that defines our little postmodern academic cloister, where even the dimmest bulbs can get a world-class education---well, or something like it.

Oh, and of course, the big Quiet that settles hard and fast on a campus just before semester final exams: Dead Week.

Only at Central State University (good ol' CSU, baby, yeah!) Dead Week comes ready-to-rock-and-roll with brain-eating flesh-rending Living Dead. If they showed up on the typical college campus hankering for brains they'd die hungry, but fortunately they just want to eat guts. Fair enough.

Plot?---hey, you've been this route before: Mad Scientist (Sig Haig, slumming it, baby)? Check! Full-frontal undead nudity with big bajoombas? Double check, skipper! Undead university research? Check and check! Breakdown of quarantine, massive slaughter, flesh-eating critters rampaging through campus? Ahoy, matey!

Look: ""House of the Dead 2"" was shot on a shoestring: the budget may have been enough to have catered ""Doom"" and waxed The Rock's eyebrows. And every dollar is on the screen: ""HOTD 2"" is a helluva lot more fun than ""Doom"", and Jesus Wept---the effects look better. The flick is like sinking your choppers down into a big, greasy, nasty fatburger: H*ll, even the acting here works, and a few of the characters (particularly one trooper who insists on getting photographed with his kills) really light it up.

You've got a rampaging virus, you've got skin-ripping flesh-eating goodness, you've got plenty of red grub, you've got a few minutes of Sid Haig, you've got bajoombas (undead ones, even), you've got a big ol' greasy keg party about to be interrupted by flesh-eating ghouls and cruise missiles.

2493426,3,B000E5N69S,"With the first HOD being a complete joke, this new offering came across much more in the zombie vein we expect. Although, nothing we haven't seen before I found it acceptable for Zombie fans. There is some great gore and usual zombie goings on that one would expect. In my opinion, the first HOD should be pulled from the shelves to never been heard from again and this one retitled as HOD1. So to summarize.... zombie fun, not bad, ...good times. - also a few points for compelling DVD cover art, 3 points is a fair rating

2493427,5,B000E5N69S,"Ok, this is no Romero classic and it's a bit looney at times, but it's quite entertaining and might I say, scary.  The story is the typical Romero zombie lore with an outbreak that spreads a disease making everyone into a zombie.  This takes place on a college campus, filmed in Occidental College in Eagle Rock, CA.  I used to live really close to that campus and I was an extra as a zombie in the film.  It was a fun experience, but I had low expectations for the film, after seeing the first film.  This movie has nothing to do with the first film.  It's totally different.  It is more like the Romero films and the Resident Evil movies, but not as sophisticated.  Check it out, it's not that bad.",1142985600,5,700,4.290076335877862

The main character will make you fall head over heels and the gore and action are top notch. I really liked the premise: We have to find FIRST zombie to design a cure.
ANYONE WHO HATED THE FIRST MOVIE WILL LOVE THIS ONE!
The make-up in this movie may be the best I've ever seen and is very impressive. Truly an outstanding entry into the zombie horror scene.",1142985600,3,626,4.405172413793103

So i duuno maybe sci-fi channel cut some kind of deal with the producers of house of the dead 2 who knows. Of course sci-fi channel being on cable tv cut out the language and what ever else might have been in it. But i will tell you i really liked this movie. Sid Haig the man who played captain spaulding in rob zombies house of 1,000 corpses and in devils rejects stars in this movie as Professor Curien..the movie starts out at a college.a girl is used for sex and video taped by a fraternity..the girl after being used and givn up her virginty takes off and crys shes on her way out of the dorm now and walking across the srteet crying when shes hit by a car.professor curien steps out and says something like oh my god im sorry i didn't see yiou..are u hurt.the girl responds no im ok Professor Curien.then Professor Curien produces a tire iron the girl screams and Professor Curien wacks her with it.he takes her dead body back to his lab.the main girl from the first house of the dead movie the one stabed at the end and brought back to life is in the second movie.shes in a padded like locked room.and shes one mean ,ugly,scary looking zombie. Professor Curien has been takeing samples of her blood etc trying to figure out the secret to reanimating hince bringing back the dead.he gives the girl he hit with his car the now dead girl the shot.nothing happens he turns for a minute .only too look back and he notices her bodys gone.she comes in from behind him and bites him.the infection spreads like a plague and the whole campus is soon infected.an elite group of commandos are sent in.to look for survivors and to find the original zombie and get a smaple of her blood.the female scientist says if we can get a sample of her blood we can quit playing catch up.and stop this war once in for all..she means if they get a sample they can make a cure to stop the infection i.e. u get bit u won't turn into a zombie. Of course the elite commandos are anything but eliete in the movie they said something like weve fought in iraq or iran or something...the soldiers are takern out left and right.makes me wonder how they really lasted fighting in a 3rd world country?i actually think this movie is better than the first house of the dead. And its much,much, better than George A Romeros some what boring land of the dead.one thing a movie must have to be good is characters that stand out.all the characters in this movie are great .each charcter stands out.so if you want a mo0vie with some really scary zombies,and high paced action. Then you cant miss one of the best zombie movies ive seen in a long time HOUSE OF THE DEAD 2.",1141516800,2,2732,4.348336594911937
2493431,2,B000E5N69S,"Of all the horror movies that deserves to have a sequel, Uwe Boll's House of the Dead would've been the last on the list to need one. But it seems that someone thought the first film made enough money that a sequel was greenlit to be produced and made. So, House of the Dead 2: Dead Aim got made and it pulled off that rarity amongst other sequels. It proved to be better than its predecessor.

This direct-to-cable sequel didn't have Uwe Boll at the director's chair and I believe that was one reason why this sequel was a much better (though this film stretches the limit of what constitute as a better film) than the first House of the Dead. Michael Hurst does the directing duties for this sequel and he seems to understand that what he's making could only be seen as low-budget fare. It helps that Hurst has experience directing movies based off godawful scripts. And the script for this sequel is just a tad bit better than the first film. Written by Mark A. Altman, House of the Dead 2 adheres much closer to the classic Romero zombie movies. In fact, it actually uses the secret zombie hunting group from the game franchise which helps it tie into the game much better than the first film without having to insert game footage like Boll did.

This time around the setting is a fictional Southern California university campus that's become zombie-central. The opening scenes detailing how this place of higher learning became feeding ground for the zombies is really told through flashy, music video editing-style scenes interspersed with the opening credits. From there we move on to a crack team of government special units led by a a pair of scientist-hunters to find the source of the outbreak and use it to find a cure to zombism. Emmanuelle Vaugier plays Alex, one of the leads, and to say that she cuts a different look for a scientist who moonlights as a zombie-killer would be an understatement. Ms. Vaugier looks stunning and she does so even while covered in blood and being manhandled by zombies wanting to eat her. I'd be on her too so I couldn't fault the zombies. The rest of the cast was pretty much made up of unknowns and/or veterans of the direct-to-video and cable movies. Victoria Pratt and Sid Haig being the two most noticeable in the group.

Really I couldn't complain much from the acting since there's barely a story to use to emote. Every quiet scene was pretty much set-up to get to another zombie attack and kill or to scenes that was suppose to be suspenseful and terrifying. It all boiled down to being funny and hilarious. Something I'm sure the filmmakers weren't aiming for but did well anyway. This was something this sequel had over the original. The cast seemed to be having fun with the crap they were cast in.

The special effects and gore for House of the Dead 2 was pretty good for a low-budget sequel. It actually had quite a few scenes of gore and zombie mayhem. Something that Day of the Dead 2: Contagium could've done better. There's some scenes where zombies were on a feeding frenzy that I was surprised even basic cable like Sci-Fi Channel actually allowed it. I'm sure the dvd would be a few seconds longer, or even minutes longer with gore and splatter scenes unedited. Even in these scenes this sequel surpasses what Boll did with the original. There's no kung-fu fighting from the zombies and there wasn't a bullet-time effect used anywhere. Also, I gave this film abit more points for keeping game footage in the game itself and not in the film. Uwe Boll truly was an idiot without the savant part when it came to coming up with cool ideas. Hell, Dead Aim even had a somewhat good ending with the mission not coming together as planned and news radio reports of things becoming abit crazy in the cities outside the campus.

In the end, House of the Dead 2: Dead Aim was a sequel that was only better than the original for the fact that the first film was just godawful bad. Dead Aim had nowhere else to go but up and they barely surpassed the bar set by Uwe Boll's first film. I have to admit that the creators and cast of this sequel seemed to have had a better tim from the look of the movie and for that I gave this movie two stars.",1141516800,30,4196,4.501312335958005
2493432,1,B000E5N69S,"If you thought that the first House of the Dead movie, directed by the master of error himself Uwe Boll, was bad, just wait until you see it's direct to video sequel made for the Sci-Fi Channel.  House of the Dead 2: Dead Aim finds a team of zombie killing commandos taking on a horde of the undead at a college campus while searching for a vaccine for the zombie plague.  Every cliche you can think of is here, the acting is about what you would expect from a direct to video sequel to a Uwe Boll movie, and the makeup and gore effects are terrible.  For as bad as House of the Dead 2 is, it's nowhere near as bad as Anchor Bay's Day of the Dead 2: Contagium, but like that film, this should be avoided at all costs.  If you want to see a good, or even great, zombie film; check out Romero's Land of the Dead, the hilarious Shaun of the Dead, the so-so Dead & Breakfast and Undead, and even the big budget remake of Dawn of the Dead.  Anything is better than this, even the first film.",1140652800,9,986,4.0880829015544045

2493434,2,B000E5N69S,"A disappointing zombie thriller, House of the Dead 2 aims to deliver the sort of grim action, gore, and violence horror fans have come to expect from the videogame series that inspired the film. Maintaining a suspension of disbelief throughout this constant carnage proves difficult even for hardcore fans as House of the Dead 2 is a constantly self-contradicting film that diminishes or dispatches with the themes and threats that drive most successful representations of the genre.  Whilst the plot follows a specialized squad of zombie hunters--it's implied that the United States military has become accustomed to such scenarios, and zombification is regarded as an almost regular threat--few if any members of the team seem trained, equipped, or qualified to handle their assignment.  Indeed, few of these characters are believable and none of them are likable, even when the script endeavors to provide them with inventive motivations.  Only Emanuelle Vaugier, the bold and beautiful heroine, stands out and shows talent.  House of the Dead 2 cancels an expected sense of scope and suspense simply because the spreading contagion that reanimates corpses is depicted not as an apocalyptic threat to humanity's very survival but as a lesser disease destined to be contained and cured--although, again, these assertions are later contradicted.  Of course, this doesn't keep character after character from falling victim to the sizable zombie horde, which looks great thanks to some better-than-average make-up effects.  As the non-stop action is set on a contaminated college campus, the opportunity for the sort of social commentary traditional to zombie stories is here but sadly all-but ignored.  Instead, the film's setting is used only to set-up opportunities for cheap titillation and crude punch lines.  Ultimately, this is all that House of the Dead 2 truly concerns itself with: sick satiation and even sicker jokes.
