932421,5,6304836260,"Let me say I was glad I waited for the DVD version of this movie.  I first saw Running Brave at the theater many years ago before taking up running as a form of exercise and healthier lifestyle.  This is one of the best films about Native American life today, overcoming life's many obstacles, and making the best of your God-given talents.  One of Robby Benson's best performances (I also recommend One on One, still in VHS).  It's hard not to be motivated to do your best after watching this film.",1127952000,7,499,4.450549450549451
932422,5,6304836260,"This movie may not be great cinema but it is redeemed by telling a great story. The movie opens with a series of running scenes that accurately capture High School cross country in all of it's glory and obscurity. As is always the case, the number of runners in each race vastly outnumber the spectators.

The movie then veers away from the running and focuses on the racial tensions and bigotry of the time. My initial reaction was that this was rather heavy handed, however the fact that few people even in the sport can name Billy Mills despite his gold medal in the 10,000 lends weight to the premise that he was overloooked because he was Sioux.

The strength of the movie is in the final race in Tokyo. The movie is worth every penney just for this footage alone. It is one of the greatest stories in all of track and field. The movie takes the time to actually show the whole race, seamlessly blending in actual footage from 1964. The movie is incredibly faithful to the actual events. Every time I see it I curse the current network morons who show us the opening several steps of an olympic distance event and then cut away for a commercial or something and then pat themselves on the back if they remember to come back and show the finish as if nothing interesting could possibly happen during the race itself.

Benson is plausible as a distance runner, and the filming of the races is very good.",1127347200,14,1406,4.463035019455253
932423,1,6304836260,"The 1983 thatrical release tells the true but much abridged story of Billy Mills, the Oglala Sioux who came from obscurity to win the 10,000 meter race in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. The core of the movie focuses on Mills's stint as a student and runner at the University of Kansas,facing the overt racism of his teammates and the white community, and his personal conflict with his coach, played by Pat Hingle, over Mills's racing style. The racing scenes are some of the best on film (if you overlook the out of place football field at the Olympics), and ""Running Brave"" rises above the level of the other sports hero genre and other racing films.

I have given this DVD a 1-star rating because it is NOT the theatrical release, but the version that was re-edited for broadcast TV. (The movie was released as PG. This version, as noted on the DVD box, is rated G.) Several key scenes have been deleted, watering-down or eliminating much of the conflict. This DVD uses a 4:3 (TV) aspect ration, not the theatrical widescreen presentation. Quality of the video transfer is very poor.",1119225600,96,1080,4.684210526315789

932425,5,6304836260,"This is the story of the legendary distance runner Billy Mills. Mills is the only American runner in the history of the Olympic games to win a Gold Medal at 10,000 meters. He ran an incredible race but more than that he led an incredible life. Robby Benson does a nice job playing Mr. Mills (who is a Lakota Indian). The final sequence on the track is very close to what actually happened in the race. A very, very inspirational movie about a very, very, very inspirational man.",1044748800,34,478,4.443181818181818
932426,1,6304836260,"Billy Mills was an inspiration to many of us distance runners, there is no disputing this. This movie however tended to dwell too much on his being part  Native American.  Do we really need to hear a reporter say, "" Billy, did you lose the race because you are an Indian?"" Other moments in the the film are at best laughable:  Billy's girlfriend says- ""I've never been to a track meet before""- when they are at a Cross Country Meet!  Finally look closely at the infield of the track at the '64 Olympics which were held in Tokyo, you can see the yard markings from the football field where the movie was shot in Southern Cal.  By the way, D.S. Everett did not allow his name to run in the credits because he was upset with decisions made by the producers.",976838400,10,754,4.319148936170213
932427,5,6304836260,"I use this film every time I teach the Theories of Personality, for it illustrates ""self-actualization"" and going beyond one's imposed boundaries.
This is both good history and it is incredible inspiration  for Billy ""became his dream.""  How many of us even come close to  those secret dreams we harbor?  But Billy took on some of the most  unthinkable challenges and he met them all.
Prejudice, lack of support  from his own coach and school, and various forms of social oppression are  all in Billy's early experiences and yet he moves on...and he does exactly,  EXACTLY what he had dreamed.  If only Steve Prefontaine had lived so  well....
And the REST of Billy's adult life has been just as inspired.  He has raised a wonderful family, he has had a super career, and he  continues to do MAJOR fundraising for Indian charities.  And Pat Mills is  now...the marathoner in the family!
See, not only do I use this film in  my university classes, but often I SURPRISE my students with Billy's  presence.  Billy and Pat are friends of mine here in Sacramento, and I am  most proud to say that I ""know them"" and theirs is a life story  only partially summarized in the film.

Also I wanted to be able to show the kids the struggles of a real person who continues to work for justice issues in our country.
 For the most part the movie is suitable for 11 yr. olds...EXCEPT for a locker room scene early on.  I was surprised by the partial frontal nudity...in a Disney movie?  Compared to similar movies, such as Crooked Arrows, the locker room scenes have the men at least covered with jock straps and/or towels.  If I show this to children, I will have to stop the tape and fast forward it past the objectionable portion!

I had to stop on the roadside to get more details. They mentioned Billy Mills. I watched the last laps many times, seeing how Billy endured a crowded field to finally break away and win. He had a smile that expanded over his entire face, I have later learned that he is a strong spokesman for native americans, and is a strong supporter for the funding of the chief crazy horse monument, He was, and still is a hero and inspiration for all distance runners.

This movie shares the struggles Billy Mills endured and how he succeeded, despite being held back and put down.  I thought the way Billy was portrayed showed he was quick to defend himself, which I think was a little over the top, but does imply that he was in a fight for his right to live a productive life.  People who endure prejudice and conflict with grace and determination, like Billy Mills did, are very inspiring.

932591,5,6304836260,"It is brilliant, it is beautiful, it is life, and it is inspiration. If you are the type that only wants 21st century Hollywood HD and loud booming sounds this may not be your cup of tea. If you are a movie goer that enjoys a good story, one who enjoys a journey back in time - this is an absolutely fabulous story that has the 50's and 60's feel to it (the actual era it is set in).

It is a story of a person, as much as a runner, whom against odds comes through on top. It is about a North American Original that despite the non-sense that settlers had carved out for them stood up to proving that he, Billy Mills, was indeed a person, and he was a runner. Thankfully he persisted and through the discrimination he experienced on/in his own land rose above the challenges and succeeded at levels above the average citizen, especially for timeframe (1960's).

If a runner this is a must watch. It is a must watch from a historical perspective and from one of motivation. It is after all a true story. The non-runner will be touched with a human story of digging-in and going places.

I think that the racial slurs are necessary in the film, despite some of the criticism here in the reviews, as this captures some of the tensions North American Originals would have experienced then, as they probably do today in some parts of North America (and also in Australia). It may not be nice to hear, it may not be comfortable to hear, and hopefully that is your reaction.

When you are done watch some of the Youtube clips of the actual 10 0000 race, from Tokyo, 1964 and enjoy the commentators reactions. Try now: look for 1964 Billy Mills, Olympic 10 000 and you will have this video in your cart in seconds. It's an oldie - and a goodie. For runners, for people.",1321574400,3,1761,4.327272727272727

Well, I bought that one on VHS, and have enjoyed it.  That's why I'm only interested in picking up the DVD if it's the original release.

It speaks to the people who have been hated at any given time in their life, whether it be for the colour of their skin, their background or their heritage.
It also speaks of the small-minded, prejudicial disposition that some (thankfully the minority) people still harbour.
As a kid, we're taught that if we're good, and nice, and follow the rules, that we will do well. This was the general concensus back in the early 80s, in England. This was a wake up call for me (at the oh-so-old-age-of-9) that sometimes, it goes a little deeeper than that for some, through no fault of their own.

I've got this movie in my treadmill rotation and have watched it several times now.  This is definitely one of Benson's better movies, although I wonder if a native American could have been found to play the role.  I guess it helped in that Mills was caught between two worlds, so Benson was something of his reverse character.

Benson's running sequences are very good, that boy FAST. <g> I wince when I see him looking over his shoulder so much, seeing him lose time with every glance as he twists himself around.  'It's a movie' I have to tell myself while thinking 'Stop doing that Mills!' at the same time.

He left out so many details because he had it revised it two hours.  He told me he wanted to share so many points in this movie that he could not pare it down.  His wife salvaged it and actually made it work.  They are a great team.  Wife does not shine in the movie but in real life, she is a rock.  Holy cow, amazing side kick that contributed to his success more the the story emphasized.  Like I said I am biased and see Mr Mills as my hero.",1458864000,2,614,4.016528925619835
