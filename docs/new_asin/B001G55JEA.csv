3595649,1,B001G55JEA,The picture quality of this movie was terrible. So bad all I could do was throw it away. It wasn't worth the $US14 I paid for it.steer clear of this dvd!,1311638400,4,153,3.967741935483871
3595650,1,B001G55JEA,"terrible product and advertised falsely on Amazon.  the first review Amazon shows you for this film is for a different DVD package.  the film is fine but this ""remastered"" product is no different than the film you get in the Mill Creek 50 pack.  Amazon should be sued for using reviews of different products to sell this DVD.",1299196800,,325,4.568965517241379
3595651,1,B001G55JEA,"As I pushed ""play"" on the DVD remote, I warily wondered why a remastered DVD would be accompanied by such poor packaging and shoddy case/DVD artwork.  I thought to myself, ""stranger things have happened in the world of B horror movie DVD's"".  Three minutes later, I stood in front of the garbage can wondering how many sandwiches I could have bought at QuickCheck with the money I just wasted.  The DVD was now in the garbage on top of the packaging it just came in and next to the food my kids didn't eat during school lunch.  A2Z's release of this title is absolutely horrible in every single aspect.  Everything from the poor quality DVD case, cheap disc case cover artwork, one of the worst picture transfers i have ever seen, and the actual DVD itself-which looks like someone printed the non-playing side artwork at home with one of the first printers ever available.  If this is the ""remastered version"", I would hate to see what they originally had to work with.  I have no idea how they can get away with even calling this DVD remastered.  If anything, this is the exact opposite of what constitutes a remastered DVD.  Save your money and buy a used ex-rental VHS copy, or rent the film and a projector from the library-you'd be light years ahead of the quality contained on this DVD with either option.  This actually rates 0 stars with me.  Shame on A2Z which stands as Awful2Zero in my book!",1276041600,13,1403,4.549800796812749
3595652,5,B001G55JEA,"I wasn't looking for perfection in the story or in the quality of the DVD. I wanted to see the movie without the blurred out women, without the edit cuts for TV, and without any other censorship like I originally saw it on late night TV. What this DVD delivers is all the boobies (what of it there is) and all the movie from start to finish like it no doubt appeared in theaters back in 1971. I never anticipated anything beyond this DVD giving me an early seventies movie, with gratuitous boobies, and hokey special effects that by today's standards may be laughable but when you consider this movie is just 1 year short of being 40 years ago, I got my money's worth buying this movie and then some. BTW I'm 12 years from retirement, so no, I'm not a teenager with overactive glands, panting over anything and everything. I appreciate this movie for what it is. A collectible horror/thriller genre movie that was made before Texas Instrument came out with the TI-99 computer that used cassette tape for media storage. Lady Frankenstein is a good movie, and this DVD is worth buying.",1262908800,,1083,4.558974358974359
3595653,5,B001G55JEA,"This film is a horror film with a little bit of romance added to it. Its about a Dr who recreates a man, but with the brain of a criminal in his head. He comes to life and kills the Dr before escaping the castle. Trying to save her father's name and stop the creature's rampage of death, Tania insists on continuing the experimentation to design a second creature who will be able to fight the first. It is a great movie and you also get to see quite a bit of nudity in it. All in all A2ZCDs did a great job remastering it.",1223424000,,523,3.9904761904761905

3595662,2,B001G55JEA,"A fine example of early 70's ""so bad it's good movies."" Lady Frankenstein appears in a few scenes semi nude. She is an absolute knock out!",1431993600,,138,4.346153846153846

3595664,5,B001G55JEA,"This is an Italian take on Frankenstein, so be prepared for the following:

1. Beautiful, charming, smart women.  Rosalba Neri (billed Sara Bay) is the titular character and completely mesmerizing.
2. Wonderful costumes and set pieces.
3. Passionate acting and pitch-perfect mood pacing.
4. Somewhat contrived, but strangely compelling, plot components.
5. Beautiful, charming, smart women.  Sans clothing.  Yes, Rosalba Neri included.

I won't reveal any spoilers.  It starts out the usual Frankenstein story with the brilliant, somewhat crazy scientist trying to create life.  After some complications, Tatiana arrives on the scene and applies her feminine qualities to set things in an unexpected direction.

OK, so the monster's makeup isn't the greatest, but so what.  Look at it this way.  You know how Italians inexplicably make some of the best Westerns?  Think of this movie as if Sergio Leone had taken a wrong turn in the studio lot and decided to finish directing this movie rather than bother to go look for Clint Eastwood and work on his own.

Really, just go see it.",1418601600,2,1081,5.149425287356322
3595665,1,B001G55JEA,"Come on, Amazon, get your act together.  The movie cuts out toward the end and doesn't finish.  I invested a lot of time in this movie only to not see it's ending.  Bush league. This is inexcusable.
Up to the point where the movie cut out, I would have given it a solid 3 Stars.",1414627200,,278,4.0181818181818185

3595667,4,B001G55JEA,"This is a pretty cheesy movie indeed! but after all its not a Mary Shelly story we're dealing with here! So if you like a fair amount of TNA then you might enjoy this, and yes the acting isn't  spectacular but its still a fairly entertaining movie if you keep it all in context.",1400889600,,278,4.148148148148148

3595669,3,B001G55JEA,"Joseph Cotton is largely wasted in this movie of a strong-willed woman willing to do anything to continue her father's work. No surprises or scares, gratuitous nudity with only one scene memorable due to the kinky sex involved. Rosalba Neri (""Sara Bay"") is the main attraction but, in our jaded times, not much of a turn-on. Rated ""E"" for ""Elvira"" fans only.",1396224000,,358,4.790322580645161

3595671,4,B001G55JEA,"1972/2008NR: Rosalba Neri ROCKED. My favorite sick-twisted-chick / monster-flick of all time. Even among the dark, old footage, some lame male actors, and no real special effects Welles somehow managed to get her fleshtones perfect. The monster dude was pretty good too.

Definitely a good candidate for a remake. Add a cool soundtrack and even Google will predict a hit. Enjoy. MFJLabs 4x",1372896000,,389,5.174603174603175
3595672,3,B001G55JEA,"Features all of the monster movie cliches: bubbling beakers and flasks in the laboratory, hunch backs, hilariously bad kills, and a bit of nudity once the second act starts to keep the viewer occupied. Reminds me a bit of the Hammer Films Frankenstein movies but on a lower budget. Not a must see, nor really recommendable, but there are far worse films with the Frankenstein in the title and if you're looking for some cheesy horror with a bit of cheese cake you've found it.",1358208000,3,476,4.6117647058823525
