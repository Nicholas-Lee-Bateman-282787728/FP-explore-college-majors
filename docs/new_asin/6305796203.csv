7895247,5,6305796203,"This is a solid piece on roots and rockers reggae from the 70`s that reveals a rare and intimate side of the icons portrayed throughout. What I found most refreshing in the artist interviews was a degree of humility and earnestness that is not likely to be revealed in main stream media.  The content and flow is very engaging with excellent video and sound quality.  I'm unaware of the constraints or preferences of the writer and director at the time this documentary was made, but it would have great to see a few more of the seminal artists of the time featured in this segment.  Regardless, this is a must have for reggae fans and a true time capsule of a critical era in reggae music and the socio-political landscape of Jamaica at that time.",1426377600,2,748,4.525925925925926

7895250,5,6305796203,"I loved every minute of it and it made me see just how poverty stricken Jamaca really is! One can also see the ROOTS INDEED DO COME FROM AFRICA!

Its a documentary with music throughout. Anyone who truly loves the genre must see this!

The actual dvd's condition was great, brand new and a very low price! I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT HOW GREAT THIS DVD IS FOR TRUE LOVERS OF REGGEE!!

I'm very pleased (can you tell?)and recomend it highly!",1144454400,4,437,4.37037037037037
7895251,5,6305796203,"Anyone who is interested in roots reggae and dub will absolutely flip out over this documentary. Filmed in 1977, an incredibly important year in Jamaica, it covers the music/culture/politics of Jamaica (mostly music though). With unforgettable moments- like entering Lee ""Scratch"" Perry's BlackArk studio while the Heptones are recording. Then there's the late great Jacob Miller, in underwear, working out a song with the InnerCircle. The Gladiators recording, Mighty Diamonds live, and Joe Gibbs sings a beautiful trenchtown song. Get the idea? This is hugely important to anyone who loves this excellent music. The narration is also insightful and there are many scenes which capture tranchtown and the hard life of Jamaica.
This DVD is an absolute must-have for anyone who loves reggae. The picture and sound quality are totally fine, especially considering this was a small documentary that was probably made with very little money. I am sure that the DVD transfer was as good as it could be (and it's perfectly fine).
One side-note to reviewers that complain about the picture/sound- this was a small project in 1977, this is not Star Wars or Terminator. Don't have some ridiculous expectation that everything has to be up to the level of a big-budget hollywood blockbuster Ultimate edition DVD. It seems that reviewers all over Amazon like to complain too much about picture/sound quality. I personally own hundreds of DVDs and find that many complaints i've read are just flat-out wrong. I think people just feel the need to complain about something, but don't let them fool you.",1075766400,40,1587,5.155038759689923
7895252,5,6305796203,"Just to clarify something: in another review it is stated ""at one point, it makes the erroneous claim that Rastafarianism was started by Marcus Garvey, which is not true"". Well, it is true (sort of), although Marcus himself wasn't a rastifarian - a statement (prophesy) he made during a speech, that a ""king (of kings) will rise out of Afrika, from the line of David"" was what initially sparked the Rastifarian belief, which officially started when Haile Seliassie (a name that came with the crowning - his birth name was Ras Tafari, get it?), 225th in line from the house of David, was crowned as Emperor of Ethiopia. When Burning Spear sings ""Macus Garvey words come to pass..."" he is reffering to the prophesy...",1052179200,18,715,4.774193548387097
7895253,4,6305796203,"This is a great documentary as it introduces you to the Jamaican reggae scene as it happened in the 1970s (as well as a few rare, choice 1960s clips of Toots &The Maytals and a lively young Jimmy Cliff). However, the film's only shortcoming is that it doesn't do too good a job in expalining various aspects of Rastafarianism (at one point, it makes the erroneous claim that Rastafarianism was started by Marcus Garvey, which is not true), nor does it get much into the history of the music, and Bob Marley appears far too briefly. By this time, Bob was already considered a major force in the music, so this is hard to understand.  But it's good as a starting point in understanding this genre.",1042502400,5,695,4.515873015873016

Ever wonder what the Black Ark/Randy's/ Randy's Record Store etc looked like from the inside in '77?  It's all here, plus the Congos, a great Joe Gibbs acoustic song,  Jacob Miller writing a tune with Inner Circle and a lot more.",1018742400,18,314,4.6909090909090905
