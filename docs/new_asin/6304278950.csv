7867356,5,6304278950,"For some unknown reason this gem is not available on DVD on its own.  But if you purchase ""The Queens Sister"" - which is absolutely terrible - you will find ""A Royal Scandal"" included as bonus material.

7867357,2,6304278950,"To think this is a real story is very sad.  I thought it was extremely hilarious how the King was crying with a broken heart.  He never was constant to anyone but his own toilet and himself so much so that he spent 20lbs a week on.  To think these people ruled the kingdom.  I guess it's really no different today I'm sure.

I would borrow from library instead of paying the price.  This is one you only want to watch once if even that.",1308873600,,436,4.070588235294117
7867358,5,6304278950,"This is one of my favorite period comedy/dramas, Excellent work by Richard E. Grant and Susan Lynch and co. The writing is brilliant by conveying much in only 60 minutes. I just discovered this gem is an ""added feature"" on a DVD called ""The Queens's Sister"" - available on Amazon.",1296518400,,280,4.62
7867359,5,6304278950,"One of my favorite PBS productions with great work by Richard E Grant, and it's only on VHS? Not even Betamax? Come on. We want to buy this thing in a modern format.",1288396800,3,165,4.03030303030303
7867360,5,6304278950,This is a great comedy about the matrimonial disaster that took place over 200 years ago between Prince George and Princess Caroline. It's a must see!!,1106611200,5,151,4.846153846153846
