7997126,5,B0000AGWJ8,"THIS IS A GREAT VIEW OF THE PAST GOLDEN AGE OF TV. 1952 WAS A BANNER YEAR FOR DETECTIVE SHOWS AND EARLY TV PROGRAM HAD THEM ALL. I REMEMBER THE STORY ""ACCIDENTLY ON PURPOSE"" AS IT WAS A GREAT TOOL FOR A YOUNG PERSON BUYING A USED CAR IN THE DAY. DISHONEST CAR DEALERS PRAYED ON THE UNSUSPECTING YOUTH THAT WANTED A FLASHY CAR THAT RAN AND MABY STOPPED TOO. EXCITING FOR ALL AGES. THE OTHER STORIES ARE ALSO GREAT, HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS RACKET SQUAD VOL. 1",1493078400,,454,4.2298850574712645
7997127,5,B0000AGWJ8,"This tape features two excellent episodes from the 50s crime drama series Racket Squad, one a particular favorite of mine called The Sting of Fate, which is a fascinating, plausible story that must have been based on real life (most Racket Squad stories were).  They are as follows:

The Sting of Fate, from Season 3, episode 34, air date 8/31/53.  Husband & wife con artists accuse a hotel of negligence when the wife suffers a slip & fall accident, then husband makes her ankle swell with bee stings from a jar (SO creepy, you have to see it).  Stars Steve Brodie & Catherine McLeod.

The Case of the Miracle Mud, from Season 2, episode 3, air date 9/20/51.  Homeowner posing as disabled war vet cons people into believing the mud on his property has healing powers.  Stars Jess Barker (once husband of Susan Hayward) as the homeowner, and Will Geer.",1376524800,,852,4.64

7997129,5,B0000AGWJ8,"This entertaining ""bunco squad"" police series ran for 3 seasons from 1951-1953, and though there were almost 100 episodes, less than half of them are currently available on DVD.
