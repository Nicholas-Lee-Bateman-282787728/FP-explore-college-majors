8177925,5,B000NIIUCO,After my friend Bugs passed away I couldn't listen to any of his music for a long time.  I am finally able to hear it again without getting emotional.  Now I simply enjoy it and know his awesome music talent lives on.,1390521600,,217,4.142857142857143
8177926,4,B000NIIUCO,Just as the title says at last some footage of the shuffle kings bugs made us wait for his first album titled at last and twice as long for the dvd. The quality is a little grainy in parts but still a great  concert dvd for any lover of the blues to have. The band is hot and sound mixing is great. A GOOD PURCHASE!,1199145600,2,315,3.8461538461538463
8177927,5,B000NIIUCO,"I've been a Bugs fan for 15+ years and was unbelievably happy to see this DVD. Bugs pulls out all the tricks and shows how a blue player with 40+ years experience should play. He was hilarious with his funny stories and incredible with his playing. The band, as always, was awesome. I was truly impressed.

  The quality of the DVD was so well done and enjoyable. It has that raw feel of a blues show, but is done in a PBS-like quality that is very very well done. The shots are excellent and the sound is amazing. You're definitely going to want to crank up the volume on this one!",1171584000,5,582,4.225225225225225
