Once that ship date came and went, I just made a claim to get my money back. A total of 2 months for DVD's that were meant for a father's day gift. These guys are clueless. Stay away from them for sure. You're better off going to Target to buy DVD's.",1152662400,,426,3.9651162790697674

I am still waiting for this 3-pack placed last October. I have repeatedly asked the company to delete items listed on its website that it does not have. I am glad that Amazon has finally removed its original listing of this 3-pack (NEW) from its website.
Jan 27, 2006

I am still waiting for this 3-pack to be delivered for, initially, the Thanksgiving holiday, followed by, as promised by representatives of Amazon, Christmas. I doubt if Amazon actually has this item for New Year's day (2006). Forget to mention that I ordered it on Oct 27, 2005 and today is Dec 26, 2005.
p.s.
I received another update this morning indicating that the item will not be shipped until Jan 27, 2006. I am going to keep waiting until somebody admits that Amazon does not have this item at all.",1135555200,,799,4.548611111111111
