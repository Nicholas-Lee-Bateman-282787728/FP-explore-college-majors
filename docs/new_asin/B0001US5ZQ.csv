2024265,5,B0001US5ZQ,Great movie of how a determined couple of teens look for lost treasure and beat the odds no matter how many roadblocks may be put in their way. And the challenges they meet head on. Any movie or TV show with Ernest Borgnine is bound to be very good.,1401840000,,249,4.1020408163265305
2024266,2,B0001US5ZQ,"This dvd arrived packaged properly, but either a very cheaply made dvd, or damaged in some way.  It appears to be a nice children's movie, however most of the sound is omitted.  We are very disappointed in this dvd.",1387670400,,215,4.487179487179487
2024267,5,B0001US5ZQ,"My son likes this movie had it in VHS needed it in DVD for his travel DVD player; needed it, found it, and got it at a great price and in great shape in a hurry. Amazon and the companies linked to it did this for me, my son is very happy.",1330905600,4,238,3.5961538461538463
2024268,5,B0001US5ZQ,This is fun movie for children under 10. I wish I could find more movies starring Mike Kelly! He was great in this!,1313971200,,115,4.043478260869565
2024269,1,B0001US5ZQ,"Story was boring.  Production was amateurish.  Suspension of disbelief would have required strong intoxicants. Semi-comprehensible plot helped to mask the many weak points: Refrigerators that apparently float away, a lost shipwreck that should have been as difficult to find as a beached whale, and villains who expire merely by falling overboard. (Despite their shipboard lives, they apparenlty had never learned to swim.) The special effects would have embarassed Ed Wood.",1291507200,3,474,5.757142857142857

2024271,5,B0001US5ZQ,"I purchased this movie because I had the opportunity in 2003 to meet one of the actors (Logan Lipton), so my review may be bias!  On that note, I would still give it at least 4 stars.  I haven't watched a family oriented film since ""Finding Nemo"", and this one was indeed a charmer.  Ernest Borgnine with an all-new up and coming cast set the stage for a fun-filled adventure out at sea.  No cursing, no sex, maybe some light violence (we are talking lost treasures and pirates here), but nothing even I couldn't handle (and I get squeamish watching ER).  Truly a delightful film, well acted, well produced, and a high quality DVD - complete with plenty of bonus features.  If you are looking for an alternative to the big studio releases, and something viewable by adults and children, then The Lost Treasure of Sawtooth Island is indeed a wonderful choice!  Plenty of humor to enjoy as well.",1105315200,16,893,4.578616352201258
2024272,4,B0001US5ZQ,"Great family show - something all too rare these days. Entertaining for youngsters and parents too.
Pirates, treasure, mystery and beautiful scenery from the Northern Michigan area make this a nice addition to the library for the kids or the grandkids.",1084147200,14,252,5.170731707317073

8016274,4,B0001US5ZQ,"I am a 62 year old widow and like all treasure seeking movies, especially involving children.  Although this film
was not as good as the Goonies, it had a simple and slower storyl ine that was engaging, and would be suitable
for all age groups.",1509062400,8,244,4.4222222222222225
8016275,5,B0001US5ZQ,not a high budget movie but the acting was great. Also there is nothing bad that distracts just because it is a little lower budget.,1508889600,3,132,4.32

8016277,5,B0001US5ZQ,"I don't know what one reviewer meant by this not making much sense. Shaking my head, anyway....
The only reason I started watching this is because I saw Ernest Borgnine in the Trailer for the movie. He was a good actor and he brings a mm, well, charm to the movie, I guess you could say.
All the acting was really good.... some of the writing or action was a bit cheezy, but I'm guessing that this wasn't written necessarily for adults. It's most likely made for kids from 5 to 11'sh years old. Of course, now days, I'm not sure what age group would fit into this. Now days, if someone's not getting beat up every minute, chances are the kids may or may not like the movie. Or if something isn't going really fast or blowing up.
Anyway, yeah, not really sure what wouldn't make sense about this movie. It played out well .... I thought it was really good for what it is.",1499126400,5,870,4.246987951807229
8016278,2,B0001US5ZQ,We watched this based on the decent reviews but it was very boring.  It also didn't make that much sense.,1493942400,,105,4.25
