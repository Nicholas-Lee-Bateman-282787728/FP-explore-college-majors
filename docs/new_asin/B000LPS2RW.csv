8163366,5,B000LPS2RW,"A good movie. I classify it in the ""Elegant Crime"" type of movies.

Is the movie where the crime is committed but the criminal ends with clean hands, and all love it.

Is in the same category of ""The Tourist"", ""The Theft who Came to Dinner"" and some other classic movies.",1420070400,,271,4.294117647058823
8163367,3,B000LPS2RW,"Bien para pasar el rato, no termina de cuajar del todo, aunque est&aacute; divertida. Las bromas y el humor negro son estereotipados.",1379462400,,133,5.090909090909091
8163368,5,B000LPS2RW,"The secret to this delightful movie lays in its title, a not so subtle pun on ""tener mala leche"", the  Spanish expression describing those who act in thoroughly bad faith.  Well, that describes the characters! They are truly ""rotten grapes"".  So is Spanish society as a whole, its economic crisis, its dependence on bad American movies and reliance on deceit and appearance as survival tools. The plot itself is full of ""mala leche"", challenging the viewer by repeatedly denying the horizon of expectation. Luckily, all is well that ends well, except for one unfortunate, hilarious, and totally coincidental death.",1349827200,,614,5.181818181818182
8163369,4,B000LPS2RW,"How exactly does one translate the title, MALA UVA: Bad grapes? Foul mood?  That's the only real mystery in this movie -- because this isn't a crime thriller about a hit man, it's a dark comedy about a hit man, wrapped-up with a romantic comedy about ... growing older, and all that that entails.

I loved every minute.  Like so many of my favorite European films, MALA UVA develops slowly and without fanfare, but inspires many smiles throughout.  Very quickly we begin to recognize the best parts of our friends, family and self within this happy, loving family of a (secretly) former hit man!  That should tell you just how quietly subversive but charming this film really is.

Sancho Gracia (Cesar) is excellent in this movie; he reminds me very much of Marcello Mastroianni, later in his own career, who performed many tongue-in-cheek roles like 'Cesar,' and had a great gift for bringing a warm but slightly skewed sense of humanity to every role.  Sancho Gracia shows he could fill Mastroianni's shoes, at least in this film -- and I have never said that about any other actor.  It's worth watching MALA UVA just for Gracia's performance, but I think you'll find even more to like, as the movie develops.  I did, anyway.

Ciao!",1306368000,2,1234,4.724299065420561
