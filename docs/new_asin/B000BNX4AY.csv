8089787,4,B000BNX4AY,"If you know bad movies, you know Bill Rebane. Probably best known for ""The Giant Spider Invasion"", he has made low budget films on many subjects, most of them ridiculous. I knew it was going to be a great movie when I saw the opening credit ""The Legendary Creature of Arak played by Janus Raudkivi"". Set in the middle of small town Wisconsin in the winter, the film opens with trappers capturing a yeti, but things don't go well as their plan has several flaws. I won't trouble you with much plot: there's a ton of walking around (a Rebane specialty), an amazingly daft looking bleach blonde yeti (I guess an albino bigfoot is a thing...), a sasquatch invasion of the lamest ski resort ever, a sheriff who does insufferable John Wayne impressions (I guess this was supposed to be the comic relief part), and Richard Kennedy as Olsen, a murderous psychopath who for some reason wields excessive power in this loopy tundra town. Basically yetis are peaceful but Olsen's evil poachers shot and killed a baby bigfoot (played by Randolph Rebane) and now mom (Raudkivi) is mad. Before it's over there's a simply embarrassing dance at the lodge to endure, an albino yeti capture and escape, and a ridiculous fire to contend with.

You will be unsurprised to learn that this gem was made in Gleason, Wisconsin on a miniscule budget. It's all quite ludicrous even by the low standards of 1970's bigfoot dramas, but like other Rebane films, that's part of its odd charm. This is a terrible movie: it's plodding, poorly acted (especially the histrionics from Kennedy), has terrible costumes and special effects, and is utterly predictable. Yet somehow, believe it or not, I enjoy it for what it is. Sure it's horrible, but what were you expecting? It's a cheap 1979 film called ""The Capture of Bigfoot"" after all.

This is one of those films that if you're so inclined to appreciate the concept of ""so bad it's good"" will fill you with mirth.",1511481600,,1931,4.710059171597633

You could not watch the movie without sitting on top of the player; because every other minute the tracking would change. It should have been tossed into the garbage.,1404345600,,265,4.782608695652174
