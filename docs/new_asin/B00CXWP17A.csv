5751718,5,B00CXWP17A,"The movie is just as intriguing as the title!  A very real glimpse at the different facets of some often undiscussed realities brilliantly translated onto film.  Also a great platform to showcase so much of the local talent- acting, music, directing- to a much deserving larger stage.  I look forward to many more projects from DeAara Lewis!!",1369699200,3,342,4.964912280701754

5751720,5,B00CXWP17A,"Tricks is an awesome, awesome film!!  Great acting and writing and a story with heart.  It is refreshing to see an original, creative movie made outside of the normal Hollywood machine.  In a perfect world, this film would be celebrated on the same level with Hollywood blockbusters.  Honestly, it is as good or better than whatever is playing at your local cineplex right now.",1369267200,5,377,4.84375

5751725,5,B00CXWP17A,I actually saw the screening and I know Ms. Lewis from some years back but I did enjoy this movie. I can't wait to see what's up next.,1458086400,,134,3.8214285714285716

5751728,4,B00CXWP17A,"The story was believable, the plot was easy to follow, but some of the acting as sub-par.  I think DeAara did a great job with the selection of girls and I look forward to seeing more of her work.",1448236800,,196,4.0256410256410255

5751731,3,B00CXWP17A,"It could have been better, but I've seen worse.  The choppy editing and muddy sound were distracting and gave it too much of an amateurish feel.  However, the performances were mostly good - with the exception of the actor who portrayed the corrupt police chief, whose performance was terrible: really hamming it up. And a lot of the dialogue was stilted and a bit awkward.  At least this film neither glamorized prostitution, like ""Pretty Woman"", with the knight in shining armor to the rescue, nor did it present some phony manifesto about ""self-empowerment"".  Instead, it presented each of the women's poignant, gritty stories in a realistic way.  I'd give this film an ""A"" for effort.",1418256000,,688,4.947826086956522

5751733,1,B00CXWP17A,Didn't get a chance to even watch because it would not play and I could not get in touch with anyone to make that known.,1414972800,,120,3.84
5751734,5,B00CXWP17A,"Outstanding!  Don't be a prude.....watch this movie. This is the most realistic view of the other side of the game from a woman's point of view. If you dug ""Hustle And Flow"" then you will dig this movie. These ladies have upgraded the game and kicked the business managers to the curb. Some say ""Pimpin' ain't easy."" This movies proves that ""Ho'ing is harder"". Brava. I need a sequel or a new movie from Director DeAara Lewis. So truthful and refreshingly raw. Kudos to entire casts and crew. Respect.",1408752000,3,501,4.629213483146067
5751735,1,B00CXWP17A,Worst movie I've ever seen. A waste of money!,1407542400,,45,4.111111111111111
5751736,5,B00CXWP17A,"What a thought provoking dramedy!!! There were some really fresh, different & interesting points of views on ""the world's oldest profession.""  This movie gave prostitution a voice without giving it redemption- not an easy feat! And made it somehow funny without undermining the message- BRILLIANT! The story was well balanced with heart felt performances from the writer/director who also starred in the movie, as well as from a few others I'm SURE we'll see again on the big screen in the future!",1394582400,2,497,5.060975609756097
5751737,5,B00CXWP17A,"This was a great film with an awesome cast!!!! I cannot wait for upcoming projects from this film maker and the cast of this movie!!!!!
This film dealt with a tough subject in a very creative way that inspired me as a viewer to think in a more compassionate way as it relates to the career decisions some make. The film really surprised me with the elements of comedy evenly dispersed giving it a really even balance!!!! I suggest this film to all who enjoy independent cinema!!!!!!!",1393718400,5,483,4.563218390804598
5751738,5,B00CXWP17A,"This film has well written story and good young talent. This independent production tells a story about one of the oldest known professions. I found that the mix of comedy and drama kept me engaged with the story.

One of the best independent films I've seen and this group has excellent potential to be something great. I want to see more from artists like this. Help support our Indie writers!",1393632000,4,395,4.642857142857143
5751739,5,B00CXWP17A,"I liked ""Tricks"" and found it to be a poignant, entertaining and real look at an important social issue. The acting, writing and directing were good and characteristic of the true spirit of independent filmmaking. I've got a feeling we are going to see more great things from this writer/director and acting team and we will be soon saying ""I knew them when..."". Bravo!",1393632000,3,369,4.78125
5751740,1,B00CXWP17A,"I thought this was a documentary, which I would have found interesting.  I don't think the description is very clear.  Its low budge, poorly acted drama that tried to have funny moments, but they flopped too.",1389916800,3,208,4.75
5751741,5,B00CXWP17A,"Tricks is definitely an in your face look at a topic that is typically taboo, though very familiar, in our typical society.  I appreciate how Deara not only directed the film, but was also able to step outside of that director role to act in it as well.  The overall acting of the film was great!  The film itself is very high quality and professional.  It's refreshing to see local-grown Memphis talent be a part of such an amazing theatrical event.  I definitely look forward to the next film.",1369785600,3,495,4.51685393258427
