8270900,2,B0018SH8BW,"This DVD should be titled ""A Beginner's Guide to Canoes and Gear,"" as most of the content deals with selecting equipment.  All good info, but I was expecting something more, based on the title.  There is one brief section about paddle strokes, but almost nothing about actually running a canoe down a river, which is what I was looking for.",1337126400,,340,4.65
8270901,1,B0018SH8BW,"I should get my money back. 100% of the video was ABOUT canoes, safety,etc. There was nothing about actual paddling. I was hoping for a good instructional video concerning two people in a canoe: draw, pry, sweep, etc.
NOTHING. Even the section on transporting a canoe was superficial. This video is a waste of money. I am in intermediate canoeist hoping to refine my strokes. This isn't even a review.",1274572800,4,401,4.742857142857143
8270902,5,B0018SH8BW,"I've been paddling canoe's since I was a child and I'm 60 now.  My wife is new to canoes but I showed her a few basic strokes and thought we were OK for routine paddling on quiet water.  I was mistaken.  I'd recently completed a cedar strip canoe of a design that incorporates a performance type hull which typically means it's not very stable in it's primary mode, which is when it's level and not leaning.  Nautically this is known as being ""tender"".  It has good secondary stability which means that as you lean it over a bit, it resists leaning further.  But if you aren't ready for this, the poor primary stability can be disconcerting.

During our maiden voyage we capsized.  I realized we needed more information on how to handle the canoe and I bought ""Paddling the Tandem Canoe"" by Quietwater films in hopes that we could learn to paddle comfortably in our canoe and not dread going out.

The video was terrific.  It explained many things including hull design and how to enter and exit a canoe safely.  I thought I knew how to do that but what they demonstrated made a lot of sense.  They push for a wet launch, which means we have to buy some water sport footwear and clothing now, but it was good information, and wet launching saves the hull from scrapes and wear.

The real important stuff, like a paddling technique that can prevent capsizing was priceless and well demonstrated.  I ran it through twice, and my wife declared we'd have to return to this video with paddles in hand so that we could go through the techniques and get a good feel for them.

I whole heartedly endorse this video, there's so much more to it that I cannot list it all here but it was a real eye opener and well worth the purchase price.

If you've paddled for a while but have not been formally taught, this video should be on your list of must see information.
