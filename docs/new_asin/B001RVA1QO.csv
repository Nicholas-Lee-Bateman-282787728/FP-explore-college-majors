3781177,2,B001RVA1QO,"I think the choice of P&egrave;re Lachaise Cemetery as the subject of this documentary is interesting. However, the way the documentary was filmed needed improvement.",1347667200,2,166,5.68
3781178,5,B001RVA1QO,"Ful of poetry and feelings. Simone Signoret is so great that even blind people get together to appreciate one of her films. We don't know what a Korean guy is saying (it's not translated) about why he loves Proust, but we can feel that he is deeply impressed by the reading of Proust. A wonderful old woman cleans some tombs and talks about Modigliani, Apollinaire, etc with a great knowledge of them. The film is about dead, life, feelings, memory, art.",1338854400,,454,4.617283950617284
3781179,2,B001RVA1QO,"How could a documentary about the beautiful Pere Lachaise cemetery ever go wrong?  This filmmaker manages to make a botch of something that could have been quite stunning.  She inexplicably spends most of the film on Marcel Proust and Frederic Chopin, and mostly ignores the other famous residents of this cemetery.  There are some fine moments with everyday people as they tend the graves of their beloved family members--I wish the filmmaker had done more of this.  I was really looking forward to this movie, but was extremely disappointed.  Perhaps Ms. Honigmann should have entitled her film ""Marcel Proust's Grave.""",1319846400,3,621,5.17
3781180,5,B001RVA1QO,"First, the movie was great.  See if Netflicks or Itunes has it...

because Unbox and Amazon Video On Demand is an endless source of problems.  From the film not appearing in My Video Library after it is purchased to the endless difficulties of the download or viewing, this system sucks.

They have a few good films here, and but I have battled through my last one.  Next turn:  Netflicks.",1283990400,,389,4.565217391304348
3781181,5,B001RVA1QO,"A Dutch filmmaker interviews people who visit or maintain graves at the Pere Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, where many famous and not-so-famous people of the last two centuries are buried. Interviews are interwoven with insights into the deceased, including their music or writings. It's a very peaceful and touching movie.",1279065600,,320,5.42
3781182,5,B001RVA1QO,"Every day since I bought this DVD last November, its enigmatic cover has been looking at me, waiting for the moment when it was best for me to watch the film behind it.  Last night I unwrapped the face behind the plastic, and entered the Pre-Lachaise cemetery through the magnificent eyes of Heddy Honigmann.  In so doing I dunked the madeleine cookie into Proust's cup of tea, only this time the involuntary memories, longings, and painful appreciations came to me in slow motion and in inconsolable waves of joy.  Everything I love about the French individual, their honesty, their words, their fatal attachment to beauty, their fearless insistence upon seeing an idea all the way to its end... all these things entered my heart against my will because of this exquisite film.  I am more alive and grateful.",1278892800,,809,4.840579710144928
3781183,5,B001RVA1QO,"Heddy Honigmann focuses her camera on the living and dead in Pere Lachaise, Paris, Europe's most photogenic cemetery. She has an uncanny ability to draw people out rather than interview them. Here those who visit the graveyard reveal their stories and at the same time, the famous dead and the forgotten dead are lovingly brought to life. The documentary is really about the consolation of art which forms a bridge between the living and the dead. We see Chopin's grave. We hear Chopin's music. We see a young Japanese preparing Chopin for a recital which is a souvenir of her love for her dead father who loved Chopin's music. Correspondences. 'O death where is thy sting? O grave where is thy victory?' A  masterpiece.",1268006400,,720,4.806451612903226
3781184,4,B001RVA1QO,"A lovely and moving portrait of the famous Pre Lachaise cemetery in Paris, final resting place of  many great artists and other historical figures, who are buried alongside countless ""unknown"" people with equally fascinating life stories. It's a beautiful, quiet place, and the film takes its cue from this, leaving plenty of room for silence and reflection.

There is no attempt to give a history of the cemetery, nor to comprehensively show all of the graves of dead celebrities, or to even tell their life stories (it is assumed that we know who these people are). Instead, we are invited to wait patiently at a few graves to see who shows up to visit them, or to witness the occasional chance encounter. The interviews that result are never intrusive. Director Heddy Honigmann respects the people she meets, and knows when to stay quiet, letting them tell their stories in their own time: a young Japanese pianist who has devoted herself to playing Chopin in honor of her dead father; an artist making a graphic novel of Proust's ""Remembrance of Things Past""; a mortician inspired in his own work by the portraits of Modigliani; a man who leads tours, with a special fondness for the graves of certain unknown or forgotten people; a dignified Iranian immigrant taxi driver who also sings Persian classical music; a woman who tends the graves of famous writers and recites their poems; and various other family members who come to visit their loved ones, all of whom have their own interesting stories. In a way, these people are as much ""residents"" of the cemetery as those who are buried there; it's a place for the living as much as it is for the dead, a place of remembrance, contemplation, and deep feeling.

However, there are a few scenes that seem out of place. In one, the film cuts from a shot of Simone Signoret's grave to some blind people who ""watch"" (listen) and comment on a film of hers shown on TV. It goes on for a long time, but we never know anything else about them or even see them in the cemetery. Another scene cuts from a shot of the artist Ingres' grave to a woman looking at his paintings in the Louvre; I love what she has to say, but again, we don't know who she is or why we are watching her. And one scene cuts from the grave of French jazz pianist Michel Petrucciani to some (stock?) concert footage of him, with no other discussion or context. For me, these scenes interrupt the flow of the film, and I wish they would have been fleshed out more, or included as extra features.

But this is a small complaint about an otherwise wonderful, poetic film that, in its own quiet way, addresses larger themes of life, death, love, devotion, memory, and inspiration without ever getting morbid or dreary. If you've ever been to Pre Lachaise, you will remember why you loved it so much. And if you've never been, it will make you want to go.",1261267200,7,2869,4.575875486381323
3781185,5,B001RVA1QO,"Those words come from the Song of Solomon in scripture.  And I can think of no film  that more completely captures the spirit of that line than this magnificent documentary.  The setting, of course, is the famous cemetery in Paris known as Pere-Lachaise.

The filmmaker succeeds in showing the impact that the departed have on the hearts of the living...a young Japanese woman who was moved by her father's love of music to become a concert pianist; she pays homage to Chopin - a taxi cab driver who dreams of becoming a singer of Middle Eastern poetry regularly visits and tends to the tomb of Persian writer  Sadegh Hedayat - a Spanish woman who is paying respects to her lost husband talks about the impact of the Spanish civil war on her family.

There is a scene in ""Rebel Without A Cause"" where the planetarium director lectures to the high school students that in the grand scheme of the universe, each human life is insignificant. This film shows us he is wrong! The lives of others can often touch, move, uplift, inspire persons far beyond their imaginings.",1244937600,4,1066,4.67379679144385
3781186,5,B001RVA1QO,"I saw this at the Full Frame Documentary Film Festival in 2006 and I can't remember ever being so moved by a documentary. It was a surprise, just one of the many films I saw that week, but its look at art, beauty and a devotion that reaches beyond death, is a profound work. Finally, it's available for more people to see.",1236816000,6,322,4.209677419354839

8338972,5,B001RVA1QO,"I first saw this film on Netflix and ""had to own it"".  ""Forever"" is drawn from the famous cemetery in Paris called Pere LaChaise. This beautiful study is artistic in that it films not only the graves of some of tho most famous people interred here: Chopin, Proust, Nureyev, Lamartine, Callas,  Wilde, etc but also the 'inconnu""-- the unknown who rest quietly, and ""Forever"".

8338974,4,B001RVA1QO,"a bit boring, and the subject matter is for those that have an interest in the subject only.  I had visited the graveyard in 2005 and it was interesting to me to see if I remembered any of the sites.  I found that there were sites I had missed on my first visit and when I return to Paris, I will visit the graveyard again to see those spots.",1392336000,,342,3.9420289855072466
8338975,4,B001RVA1QO,"I had once visited the cemetary Pere Lachaise in Paris once, so that initially sparked my interest in this film, but while I thought that it might be some sort of travelogue, it was so much more. There's no narration in this documentary; rather, the filmmaker asks questions of visitors to personal or public gravesites in Pere Lachaise.  While seemingly selected at random, those visitors share with the filmmaker some incredible stories.  There are those who are visiting the resting places of loved ones, and those who have come to pay respects to a public figure - Wilde, Chopin, Balzac, Proust.  The insights of the visitors are striking in the way that they are very personal but also universal. To use the words of one of the participants in the film, I had some facts about Pere Lachaise, but what I hadn't experienced before was the emotion. The film very gently allows the emotion reveal itself through the cemetary's visitors. Clearly coming through is the idea that all of us have a relationship with death, and it can be filled with love.",1389139200,,1051,4.763736263736264
8338976,5,B001RVA1QO,"This documentary was poignant and engaging from beginning to end.  I had seen it twice before purchasing for my library because I will view it again, many times.  The filmmaking is exceptionally beautiful and the music divine.  Pere-La chaise would be my choice for burial, if only it were possible.",1389139200,,299,4.94
8338977,5,B001RVA1QO,"Forever is one of my favorite films.  The first time I saw it, I floated into a sort of meditative trance as I watched it, filled with a sense of calmness and peace that is not my usual emotional state when contemplating death.  The film is filled with gentle beauty and poignace as people remember their loved ones, and touched with wry humor, where Jim Morrison's grave is pointed to, but never shown, and the French come to visit Proust without having read him, but a worshipful soul arrives to visit his grave having read him in his native language of Korean.",1379635200,,563,4.509803921568627
8338978,1,B001RVA1QO,"Simply put, this is not a documentary about the cemetery, but rather a series of interviews with a number of regular visitors to it. While I suppose there are those who are in the mood for such a movie, I found the discussions to be invariably uninteresting and slow, which on top of my disappointment about the subject matter caused us to give up about a half hour into the movie.",1377734400,,381,4.380281690140845
8338979,1,B001RVA1QO,"Summary: Seriously?
*** This review may contain spoilers ***

French navel-gazing drivel at its worst. Reminds me of the many reasons I have never returned to Paris or anyplace else in France. Only the morbidly self-obsessed French would create a documentary about a world-famous cemetery and devote most of it to about five of just about the most overrated dead people (Chopin excepted) out of the hundreds of fascinating people buried there, and then, in turn, slather it with the creepy, smarmy ramblings of one of its tour guides' obsessions with a couple of the long-dead interred. Grind into this a young woman who adores Chopin, who is buried at the cemetery. She is talented enough to beautifully perform his work on her piano, in some seemingly lonely apartment somewhere. Nothing wrong with that, except that much of the time the footage of this young lady appears to be of her practicing Chopin, like a student before her lesson, so we get to hear her repeat and repeat and repeat passages of whatever piece she is working on. So combine the repeated murky images of that same handful of graves over and over and over again with a piano student practicing and practicing, then with a bunch of lonely, strange and ber-intense French women pouring bottled water all over the flower-shopped grave of Marcel Proust--or someone like him. Add to that feast of soul-killing boredom the creepy cemetery tour guide's rambling, boring, florid fairy tales about stuff he really wants you to know--about himself. Oh yeah, and don't even get me started on the Proust-obsessed cartoonist. Please. Somebody hide this bloated, groaning mastodon of a documentary in a mausoleum somewhere and seal it with titanium.",1376870400,,1708,4.992982456140351
8338980,2,B001RVA1QO,There seemed to be so much more focus on the pianist than on the cemetery.  I loved the cemetery bits though.,1363046400,,109,4.190476190476191
