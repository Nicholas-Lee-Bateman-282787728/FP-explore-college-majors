8598098,5,B00DUXLKIU,"It is late for this purpose, but this film displays this extraordinarily complex and gifted individual both before and after the film where he likely became best known to large audiences all over, ""My Dinner with Andre."" We witness his current marriage to Cindy Klein, the film director, his search for the enigmatic and possibly quite disturbing figure of his father, his friendship over the years with Wallace Shawn, and much else.
It kept my attention throughout, and I have already even re-seen the film, I thought so highly of it! So don't hesitate to purchase this gem!",1475193600,,575,4.877551020408164

8598101,2,B00DUXLKIU,"Disappointing! Having long loved ""My Dinner..."" and ""Vanya on 42nd St."" I expected to learn more about Gregory's development and philosophy as a director than is forthcoming in this film. The problem may be that his wife is the filmmaker. She inserts herself much too much  I really have zero interest in her former boyfriends (before Gregory) along with their photos. Those minutes could have been used to have Gregory talk about how he actually broke into theater. In one of the ""deleted scenes"" he describes being rejected from various drama schools, but there is nothing about how he was able to begin his career after that inauspicious start. I also was hoping for more on his work in experimental theater (however, the section on ""Alice in Wonderland"" is terrific).
A great deal of time is spent on the mystery of whether Gregory's father was a Nazi collaborator as alleged in a historian's book. Gregory hires researchers in Berlin and Paris, who turn up nothing. It prompts the question: Why didn't he contact the historian who made the allegation, or trace his sources? It seems like an obvious thing to do.
The scenes with Wally Shawn are more revealing, especially when he very articulately explains why he objects to being filmed while having a private conversation. Now he'd make a great documentary subject!",1410134400,5,1321,4.923766816143497
8598102,5,B00DUXLKIU,"This fascinating & intimate film both is & isn't a sequel of sorts to the classic ""My Dinner With Andre"" -- remembering always that ""Andre Gregory"" the character isn't quite Andre Gregory the actual person. Still, anyone who was enthralled by that previous film will find much to love here, as it not only explores the roots of the man, but where he has gone since the film was made.

What really matters here is examining the creative life -- and not merely the creation of art, as a response to & a refining of life experience; but also the creation of an individual life itself, something that's always being reshaped & always revealing new facets for those willing to pursue the often difficult & frightening process of inner growth. For Andre is shown to be as troubled as he is charming & intelligent & gifted ... and perhaps being troubled, emotionally wounded from a materially sumptuous but psychologically frozen childhood, is the root source of those many positive qualities. Clearly he's a man reacting to an emotionally blank father & distant mother; if anything, he's gone very much in the opposite direction, becoming naked & vulnerable in ways that would have been incomprehensible to his parents.

But I don't want to make this sound like depressing psychobabble! That's the last thing it is, being filled with humor, warmth, and a shrewd, knowing eye on the part of the filmmaker, Andre's second wife Cindy Kleine. We're given a portrait of a somewhat unlikely marriage that's grown richer & closer over the years, a sacred or at least blessed space for two people. And we're invited  to follow Andre's long career, interspersed with delightful anecdotes & stories -- but of course ""My Dinner With Andre"" showed us what a superb raconteur he is, after all.

As the film continues, however, it also becomes an exploration of growing older & seeking wisdom. For Andre, this has been the essence of his life in the theater, and also a very individual, personal search for himself. This involves unearthing truth about his family, his past, how history & inborn temperament have molded the man. The questions remains as to whether such truth is something that can actually be found, or whether in the end it's another fiction, something created from paradoxical & contradictory raw material. And is it factual truth or emotional truth that matters most, anyway?

For those who might think of this as something of a niche film, I assure you that it has much wider application than you might imagine. While our own circumstances may not be those of Andre Gregory, we're bound on the same journey he's been taking for 80 years. As he says towards the end, ""Everything comes to pass."" And it comes for every one of us. Perhaps this look at the life & work of one man can help each of us on our own journey forward, if we're willing to face it with as much curiosity, wonder, and occasionally bewildered amusement as Andre Gregory.

Most highly recommended!",1407542400,5,2966,4.783203125
8598103,5,B00DUXLKIU,"An impresario of alternative theater and a man of the screen, Andre Gregory is the enigmatic dinner companion of actor Wallace Shawn in ""My Dinner With Andre."" That film is a charm and a delight, if one has a penchant for delectable dinner conversation that seems to span the galaxy. In ""Andre Gregory: Before and After Dinner"" we are treated to a different version of our dinner companion--hence the subtitle. I have given this film 5 stars with but one hesitation--it might have been more authoritative or conclusive about this man who waxes intellectual, heartfelt and spiritual in a whirl. There seems to be some reservation lurking within this experience. It is possible that any treatment of Mr. Gregory and the engines of his life could never be so certain--he is a man in geographical, physical and intellectual motion. This film discusses Mr. Gregory's influence on the theater, explores generational tensions in his past, treats us to a wrenching view of his very human health crisis, and explores his wife's own individual creative genius (including as the director of the film). Wallace Shawn makes appearances that are more than cameo and somewhat revealing of his own human character. As a figurative ode  the human spirit, this film is a winner!",1396828800,8,1260,5.0
8598104,5,B00DUXLKIU,I loved this film for its humor and its insight into the life and process of a great artist.  I'll never look at the theater or acting in the same way again.,1384732800,8,157,3.90625
