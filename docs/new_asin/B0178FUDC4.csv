7497874,5,B0178FUDC4,"If you like the ""Where the Bears Are"" series, you'll love number 4.  It is the most romantic between Nelson and Todd.  We knew this was coming from the final scene in Number 3 where Todd takes out a small ring box and looks in.  Todd is going to propose to Nelson.  So, this film covers their wedding.  Along with the customary murders, of course.  It's fun and it's romantic.",1466208000,,376,4.3

7497879,5,B0178FUDC4,"All of these movies are hilarious and fun, filled with all kinds of hot bears! Over the top. The stories are so much fun, and it looks like these guys are great friends and have a wonderful time making these films. It's wonderful to have movies featuring bears instead of the Hollywood ""pretty boys"" that are generally the norm. Watch all of these and have fun laughing yourself silly!",1459036800,2,385,4.594202898550725
7497880,5,B0178FUDC4,"I love this series so I'll try to write a review that addresses both longtime fans and casual viewers that might want to give this web series a look. The series is about four gay bear roommates living in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, their sexual or romantic escapades, and how they solve a murder mystery each season. The central plot of this season involves Todd and Nelson getting married and a murder/attempted murder mystery which is told through flashbacks. The fun extras on disk 1 include outtakes and unused scenes which were too racy for YouTube. This season reminded me of the classic Rashomon by Akira Kurosawa in that the bears struggle to get a clear picture of how a murder was committed and the way the possible suspects misdirect or confuse them. The series has gotten more complex in terms of storytelling this season and I think it is in my opinion the most provocative season of WTBA thus far. Nelson and Todd are getting married but there are hints that a monogamous relationship  may not be what either man wants for the long term. I liked that this thread ran through the season because it showed the ambivalence involved in legalized same sex marriage, just because same sex couples can be married doesn't necessarily mean that they need to conform to the ""straight"" ideal of marriage. By contrast, Reggie and Wood are also shown enjoying non-monogamous, short term relationships . Captain Coley, Marcus Martinez, Todd, Todd's brother Jimmy, Nelson, and Tucker are the standout characters this season. There are lots of stunningly gorgeous men present this season especially Tucker, Eduardo, Ace, Rodrigo, Big Ben, and of course, the bear strippers at Todd and Nelson's bachelor party. Overall, a very involving, tenderhearted, and sexy season of this series that I highly recommend for fans and new viewers alike to have. I hope they can make another season. As a fan even though I loved season 4, I still think season 2 is still my absolute favorite as the funniest and most suspenseful of all the seasons actually. Season 2 is what really got me interested considering the wonders they've performed with a very small budget and limited resources. I think it's the best gay web series, I've ever seen.",1458345600,,2242,4.85378590078329
7497881,5,B0178FUDC4,"Season 4 has nothing quite as bonkers as Season 3's mid flight jetliner show down, but it's more heart felt and the writing has more finesse.  The actors are also better, having become more accustomed to their characters. This is particularly true of the supporting cast. I'd definitely watch another season",1457654400,,307,5.019607843137255
7497882,5,B0178FUDC4,"This season, we get to witness Nelson and Todd's wedding.  But Nelson's mom doesn't approve.  And along with the wedding hysteria, comes a new mystery for the guys to help Reggie solve.  All the usual players are present including a few new faces  I found the ending  very touching, having watched the previous seasons.  Being that these guys have been financing their latest seasons through Kickstarter fundraisers, a new season isn't necessarily a guaranteed thing. Hopefully there's more to come.  Stay tuned.",1457568000,,512,5.170731707317073

7497884,5,B0178FUDC4,"One of my favorites in this comedy mystery series.  Lots of twists and fun turns from the supporting cast made this a stand out for me.  There also seemed to be more racial diversity than from the first season.  And, if even possible, the bears are hunkier than ever.",1497484800,,267,4.408163265306122
7497885,1,B0178FUDC4,"There are clipping off the beginning of Japanese subtitle. whole of these disks.  Unfortunately, I saw a same mistake in season 4 and told them, But they didn't check and correct it this time. I'm very sorry.",1482883200,,208,4.621621621621622
7497886,4,B0178FUDC4,"This series remains a guilty pleasure for me, but the Season 5 story itself is not quite as complex and fun as in the previous four seasons. The bears are solving a spy mystery this time around, rather than a murder. The switch was bound to happen, since the writers needed to change things up or risk being repetitive. I enjoyed it, and will continue to watch. Among the strong points: The supporting actors get more time in the story this season, and they shine. It's also nice to see Todd standing out, and staying in character as the only sane one of the bunch. It's the actors who make this series work and they remain fun and interesting.",1479254400,,644,4.420168067226891
