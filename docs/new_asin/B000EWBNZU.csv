8114941,4,B000EWBNZU,"Leaving own place for reaching the seashore where personal problems to dissolute by themselves, male lovers-a heroin junkie and a wife murderer- have been dragged through the unbelievable encounters in real and near-death-experience worlds of their native past and our contemporary present.

A deeply philosophical movie veiled with a comedic blanket of stupidity and simple idiocy (as the Westerner, not much in the modern adult animating by Southern-Asian producers of Japan particularly, could suggest for pleasing the broader auditorium worldwide with conviction that same-gender attraction is simply a mental case only) is worth any cent of $US18.35 Amazon asks for, but hardly satisfies expectations of a viewer having at least de facto spent on it triple more overseas if even a set concluded a separate disk ""Extras"".",1238803200,,825,5.496062992125984
8114942,4,B000EWBNZU,"Two samurai lovers (Tomoya Nagase and Shichinosuke Nakamura) head for the Ise Shrine so that one of them may be cured of his heroin addiction.  This bizarre film is so surreal that it nearly defies description, leaping through various time periods at will and presenting a phantasmagoric gallery of imaginative oddities.  The only constants running throughout the film are the devotion of the two lovers and the harrowing depiction of the hell of addiction.  This is definitely not a film for everyone, but I was consistently entertained by the confident brazenness of writer/director Kankuro Kudo and his talented cast.  There are episodes of head-scratching weirdness, laugh out loud moments, and even some sequences that are oddly moving.  I was particularly impressed by Itsuji Itao as the sad comedian Naniwa Hotto (whose entire schtick appears to consist of proclaiming things to be ""hot"") and Yumi Shimizu as the worst singer in the world.",1221782400,,946,5.197368421052632
8114943,3,B000EWBNZU,"At first sight Japanese comedy ""Yaji and Kita - The Midnight Pilgrims"" looks like a curious mixture of ""Easy Rider""-like buddy movie and costume drama of the Edo Period, but the fact is the film is based on Japan's cult comic books by Shiriagari Kotobuki. This boldly-conceived film is full of crazy ideas reflecting its source materials, but the comic books is also inspired by Japanese classic novel ""Tokai Dochuu Hiza Kurige"" written by Juppensha Ikku from 1802.

The film centers on two main characters of the original best selling novel of Edo Period - two ordinary males Yaji (Tomoya Nagase) and Kita (Shichinosuke Nakamura). Kita is a drug-addict living in Edo (today's Tokyo), who is in love with married man Yaji. To these men arrives a DM advertising resorts in Ise, holy place 300 miles from Edo. Yes, of course, the film's basic premise is spoof.

Like the original comics and book, the entire film is very episodic. On the way to Ise the two guys meet people at several post stations and they are mostly very strange people. Sometimes the film intentionally disregards the chronology as Yaji and Kita have their original songs released, which becomes a local smash hit. At one place the film is so self-conscious that its story becomes sort of meta-fiction with Kita watching his own movie in theater! Call it silly, clever or whatever you like it, but the film has surely originality.

Writer and first-time director Kankurou Kudo, however, seems often carried away by his own wild imagination. As you expect, the film's humor heavily relies too much on the puns and Japanese pop culture references with numerous cameos of Japanese actors, but what is most regrettable is that Kudo didn't take enough time for character development. Both actors are good as hopped-up Kita and spirited Yaji, but the story of their love and friendship is not allowed to develop sufficiently in the wildly imaginative but too muddled second half.

Interestingly the film received mixed reviews in Japan from general viewers. Some praised director Kudo's rich ideas while others disliked his unrestrained use of it. Some find his imagination amazing while others thought it rather detracts from the characters' appeal. Kankurou Kudo has been already famous and praised for his works as screenwriter and the brilliance of his writing (if not totally) is undeniable even here, but perhaps the film would have been different with another director who is not afraid of cutting some of the scenes.

Not for everyone's taste like any comedy with motorcycle riders in kimono, the film is really something unique and unusual. Even I, a Japanese, found this one so.

(DVD jacket is a bit misleading: they travel to Ise on foot, just like any other ordinary men living in the 19th century Japan. The film is bold, but not that bold as to let them ride ALL through the film's story.)",1173398400,2,2866,4.898969072164949
