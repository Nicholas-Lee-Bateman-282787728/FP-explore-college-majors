8289366,1,B001CU7UQE,"I was eager to watch this presentation on the history channel as a hand full of my friends were in this battle when they served in the Marine corps. Also I had read an amazing book on the battle titled ""Ambush Alley"" by Tim Prittcherd which was wonderfully written and extremely accurate, based on what I have been told by my friends, the men who served there. However when I watched this farce I was appalled. It could be possible that it is based off of the military version of the military actions (but when is that ever an accurate depiction of military events),  The story is not even in proper chronological order. Also Ambush alley, a four lane blacktopped road, is depicted as a narrow dirt street. I fear greatly that this will be the depiction of this amazing story that will stand the test of time. THIS IS A STORY YOU NEED TO KNOW! but you will not find the real story on the history channel. Do yourself a favor and read ambush alley, you will be amazed, shocked, and angered, that it is the first time you have learned of this amazing battle in the opening days of the invasion of Iraq.

-All that being said, the Military channel had a similar piece on the battle which was even more inaccurate.",1250035200,,1210,4.397321428571429
