3802842,4,B001ULAUEE,"Though fairly conventional ""Louise Bourgeois: The Spider, the Mistress and the Tangerine"" offers lots of solid information and is a must for anyone even remotely interested in her exceptional life.  I appreciate that the filmmakers go to great lengths at depicting loving visual explorations of her sculptures, from small, abstract figures, to her famously grand installations.

Not a masterpiece but a fine effort.",1275436800,6,415,5.571428571428571
