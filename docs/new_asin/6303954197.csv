743430,1,6303954197,This movie has one of the most incoherent plots of all time. It tellsthe story of two idiots who have a series of crazy misadventures. This movie suffers from poor special effects and an even poorer plot. See it only if you need a good laugh. Also this movie is a good one for the kiddies to enjoy.,954115200,5,298,4.155172413793103

744716,5,6303954197,"HOUSE
HOUSE 2

This is without a doubt one of the best two packs I have ever owned. Two of the greatest 80s horror/comedy films of all time. Much like the first two Evil Dead movies the first film is funny but has little more horror elements to it while the second one embraces the comedy more so. Very much so two of the most fun flicks in my collection.

The story in the first film follows a man who has released a very successful horror book but Roger Cobbs life has crumbled apart. He tragically lost his son, as in his son went missing which lead to his wife leaving him. Add on top of that that his Aunt hung herself and left him her house, the house in which his son went missing. Also just for fun, the house is haunted. Now not only does he have to deal with a house on the fritz but a nosy neighbor and maybe even a face from the past.

This is one of my all time favorite films and the DVD comes with some great special features. You get the behind the scenes look and the trailers but the real gem is the audio commentary. The commentary is done by Director Miner, writer Wiley, lead actor Katt and legendary producer Sean S. Cunningham.

The second film is about two friends named Jesse and Charlie who go on a crazy adventure throughout time, and it all takes place within Jesses new house. Add in that both have girlfriends and a guy who wants Jesses girl [see what I did there]. While moving in they find a picture of Jesses Great-Great Grandfather and notice he is holding a crystal skull with jewel eyes, naturally they decide to go grave robbing to see if he was buried with it. What they find is Gramps still alive as a zombie cowboy who attacks them at first. Once he learns who the guys are they all start to bond over his old west stories and Jesse is put in charge of keeping the skull safe. Everything is ok until Grampss old evil partner comes back for the skull, and the adventure begins.

The first the effects are brilliant and all of the different settings as they travel through time are amazing. This like I said is one of the most fun films out there. If you are a fan of the horror/comedy flicks out there then this one is for you, as is the first. The DVD comes with a great commentary by writer/director Ethan Wiley and producer Sean S. Cunningham. It is a brilliant film much like the first, love them both.

Both of these movies are super fun and are great for those movie nights with friends and such. If you come across this two pack I highly recommend it. I know that there is also a two pack with just the movies and none of the special features I, well at least I think there is. Make sure you find this two pack as it comes with everything.",1478044800,,2685,4.1937984496124034

THE SECOND STORY

I absolutely loved the original House film and knew I would love the second when I first came across these as a kid. As it turned out I was very much right, I loved this movie. Much like the first this is a Horror/comedy but goes a little further with the comedy kinda like the way the first two Evil dead films did. One of the writers from the first film Ethan Wiley returned to not only pen this but direct it as well. He did an amazing job here in what I think is his best film.

This movie is about two friends named Jesse and Charlie who go on a crazy adventure throughout time, and it all takes place within Jesses new house. Add in that both have girlfriends and a guy who wants Jesses girl [see what I did there]. While moving in they find a picture of Jesses Great-Great Grandfather and notice he is holding a crystal skull with jewel eyes, naturally they decide to go grave robbing to see if he was buried with it. What they find is Gramps still alive as a zombie cowboy who attacks them at first. Once he learns who the guys are they all start to bond over his old west stories and Jesse is put in charge of keeping the skull safe. Everything is ok until Grampss old evil partner comes back for the skull, and the adventure begins.

This is absolutely one of the most fun movies that I own and very much watch this often. This film as well as its predecessor is always a part of marathons that we put on at one anothers houses. This is a very funny film with horror flick overtones and it works very well. The writing and direction work perfectly here and the cast are brilliant in their respective roles. Arye Gross and Jonathan Stark as Jesse and Charlie respectively are absolutely magnificent together and are joined wonderfully by Royal Dano as Gramps and John Ratzenberger as the greatest electrician of all time; he is one of the funniest things about this movie without a doubt.

The first the effects are brilliant and all of the different settings as they travel through time are amazing. This like I said is one of the most fun films out there. If you are a fan of the horror/comedy flicks out there then this one is for you, as is the first. The DVD comes with a great commentary by writer/director Ethan Wiley and producer Sean S. Cunningham.

745186,4,6303954197,"I recently watched Comic Book Girl 19s review for this movie.  It had been 20 years since I had watched the movie.  I used to watch this all the time in the mornings on HBO.  House 2 is more of an adventure film rather than a outright horror movie.  It is a hard film to define similar to Weird Science, and My Science Project films that are out and out strange.  House 2 isn't a bad movie nor is it great either, but it should be given credit for being interesting and original.  I think the scariest part of the movie was the lead villains dead horse near the end of the movie.  Gramps is funny in the movie and the caterpillar dog, and pterodactyl baby are cute and add comic relief.  This is one of those films that is really out there in terms of logic and it is best to just roll with it and enjoy the ride.

House 2 was a better movie than the first film with a completely different story.  I watched the film a lot when I was younger.  It was one of my older brothers favorite movies.  For such a cheap movie the effects are well done.  It is nice to see actual props and stunt work rather than CGI.  If this film was remade today it would be all CGI look totally fake and not have the fun enjoyable moments like it has.  The movie might be a B grade material but the actors seem to be having fun and the film does have a campy charm to it.  Seems like the skull kept getting stolen every couple of minutes made you wonder why they didn't try and put it in some kind of safe instead of up on the fireplace mantel where everyone could see it.  Bill Maher plays an A-hole in this movie very well, no wonder I like his show so much nowadays.

Overall if you are looking for a different type of movie than you might want to give House 2 a try.  Those who bashed the film probably did not even watch the whole movie or give it a chance.  I would rate it 3  to 4 stars.",1465171200,,1871,3.98921832884097

one by Image entertainment and the other my Midnight madness series
both these reissues are barebones have no extras on them at all and probably are very poor Digital remaster transfers
so don't buy them they're waste of money

the only DVD versions of House & House II that have some special features and have pretty Good widescreen Digital transfers
are the old Anchor bay dvd versions which are still available to buy off amazon
or try get a copy of Ebay
HOUSE has a very Good Digital remaster transfer in 1:85:1 widescreen
extras are Audio commentary with Director Steve miner and Producer Sean s cunningham
plus a TV special the making of House
aswell as Stills Gallery and original Theatrical trailer
HOUSE II has been given the exact same Digital remaster transfer as HOUSE
so the picture quality is very Good with Dolby stereo mix
the only extras is Audio commentary and Stills Photo Gallery and Original Trailer
so until Both HOUSES are released on blu-ray with new HD transfers
Get the Anchor bay dvd versions
so 1 star for this Image ent' Double feature, 5 stars for the Anchor bay versions worth the money for sure",1442016000,4,1195,4.6635071090047395

A very special house which will plunge him into an incredible adventure...one where all of his dreams, fantasies and nightmares will be realized where he meets his 175-year-old great-great grandfather(Royal Dano), encounter a giant barbarian, confront a pterodactyl, discover a crystal skull with magical life-restoring powers and more & he'll be thrust into a life-and-death struggle, encountering things guaranteed to horrify and delight - all without ever leaving this house.

The film concludes with the revelation that Jesse used the crystal skull to travel back to the Old West marking Gramps new grave.

Unfortunately, HOUSE 2 didn't do too well at the box office when it came out in theatres in the Spring of 1987, especially since HOUSE II ignores the storyline & characters from its predecessor in favor of a new supernatural comedy, so the action & violence was toned down much lighter than the original HOUSE, which was theatrically released in the Winter of 1986 & was a lot more significant than the sequel was, despite the fact that HOUSE II still took place in the same house where Jesse's predecessor Roger Cobb(Bill Katt)and his aunt had their ordeals.",1386633600,,1395,5.195555555555556

The adventure takes off in HOUSE 2, the sequel to Steve Miner's surprise hit from 1986. The second story is much different than the first, but with many returning artists (including cinematographer Mac Ahlberg and producer Sean S. Cunningham), it provides an entertaining continuation with the same style and light comic mood of the series. Although it downplays the horror here in the sequel, HOUSE 2 opens its doors to a thrilling world of fantasy, one that takes us from the land before time to the temples of ancient Mexico, and on to the Wild West! It is here that Jesse and his friend Charlie must battle everything from pterodactyls to undead gunmen in a struggle to rescue the skull and use its magic powers to keep the corpse of his great great grandfather alive! Royal Dano appears as the lovable ""Gramps,"" and Cheers' John Ratzenberger stops in with a hilarious cameo as Bill, ""Electrician and Adventurer."" Fans of the first film are sure to enjoy the next quirky chapter in the HOUSE series!

746782,5,6303954197,"I used to watch House II: The Second Story regularly. It is an interesting mix. Humor obviously. Little bit of old fashion horror sort of like Tales from the Crypt style. Adventure. Good vs Evil. The budget may show in most of its effect alot of its little moments stick with me and the bad guy has always stuck with me ever since I first watched it. A true bad guy who has no sense of humor. Its lesser special effects are used responsibly. I put it in the same catagory as Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight, Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness.

I won't relay the opening scene but it sets the stage well and is gripping.

I particularly like that it isn't the same house as the original movie. It is interesting to note though what it has in common is the layout. Both seem to for the most part have the same layout. Top and bottom. When I was younger I entertained the notion it was the design that let these strange things loose from the supernatural world. Not sure if I'm the only one who thought that but, its where it took my imagination.

So in short, if you like any of the other movies I mentioned and haven't seen this I think most of you couldn't go wrong with House II.

In the second installment, a yuppie couple (Arye Gross and Lar Park Lincoln) inherit a mansion, only to discover an alternate universe inside. Hijinks ensue when the lucky owner reunites with his undead great-great-grandfather and, along with his goofy buddy, battles baby pterodactyls, angry outlaws and Bill Maher.

Although a character in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scream-2/dp/B00005NRO3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scream 2</a>"" cites the film as a superior sequel, ""House II"" does little to one-up its predecessor. Taking on a much lighter tone and with little to no violence, this sequel is more like a campy spoof of the first film, which in and of itself was a silly affair. No worries, though, as once you know what to expect, you can have a good time with the film. The performances across the board are light-hearted and fun, with plenty of lovable goofballs to go around (a sequel concerning these characters would be a good time). The score by Harry Manfredini is most memorable, as you'll be humming the film's main theme not long after the credits have rolled.

Writer/director Ethan Wiley may not have created much of a horror film, but his blend of the supernatural and absurd with a hint of Western makes for a winning recipe that just can't be matched. Those expecting bloodshed and jump-scares will be left in the cold, but perhaps with a few drinks in hand and with the right expectations, you'll find ""House II: The Second Story"" a film deserving of the title ""cult classic.""",1295827200,9,1795,5.571428571428571

With that being said, it is strange, crazy, outlandish, interesting, and very laughable and stupid at times. Frankly, it's just good enough if there's absolutely nothing else to watch, and you need to waste some time, you've come to the right place. There's nothing really memorable about it.

However, I do think it was way better than the first ""House"" with William Katt though. I know that comment leaves a lot to be desired for the viewers who had the misfortune of seeing the first film. Let's not forget, the extremely chessy special effects. I will give them brownie points for doing the best they could do with the budget, but I can probably guarantee that the same guys did the special effects for both films.

747113,4,6303954197,"This non-related sequel is so sweet-natured, so tame and family orientated that to assume otherwise is completely ludicrous. There is nothing in this movie that could possibly rate it above a PG, max. I wouldn't even have reservations letting younger children watch House 2.
A new house has a 20-something yuppie called Jesse (Arye Gross) move in with his girlfriend Kate (Lar Park-Lincoln). His friend Charlie (Jonathan Stark), a music agent, arrives with his new diva discovery Jana (Amy Yasbeck) to help him thru the unfamiliar first few days. The house is where Jesse's parents were killed when he was just a baby and it full of many curiosities.
Crafted in a bizarre gothic-Aztec style the house itself is a marvellous set and the many rooms and passages are as mysterious to us as they are to Jesse. Sitting on one of his many mantelpieces is a crystal skull that fascinates him for some reason. He even misses his housewarming party while studying the skull's history.
His studies lead him to dig up the grave of his great, great grandfather, or Gramps (Royal Dano), where he discovers the old coot isn't dead just in limbo. The person who possesses the skull is granted eternal youth but it also warps the space-time continuum within the House.
Gramps comes home with Jesse, is more enthralled by Kleenex boxes and TV than the mysteries around him and ducks for cover whenever someone from another time comes to steal the skull. Just like the first movie different rooms lead into different time zones. Jesse and Charlie have many hilarious adventures battling caveman, dinosaurs, Aztecs an evil cowboy called Slim. The one that killed Jesse's parents and betrayed Gramps over a century ago.
House 2 has so much careless abandon and zany plot twists that it is totally impossible not to love this movie. The huge success of the first movie meant that this one was put into production literally and hour later and Ethan Wiley was given the budget and green light to do whatever he wanted. How often does happen today? Usually it would make for a bad movie considering this was the first movie Wiley directed. But it makes for an unusually cute and light-hearted supernatural romp.
One of the weaker aspects of this sequel is that it has more SFX and animation by Phil Tippet's stop-motion workshop and less by Dreamquest. The matte paintings are gorgeous but the dated dinosaurs look hokey in a few shots. If you can just squint during these moments you won't notice.
Bill Maher from TV's ""Politically Incorrect"" even manages to show up as a music producer who is interested in Yasbeck and mighty suspicious of Jesse's antics. John Ratzenberger (this makes both movies star one of the ""Cheers"" barflies) appears as a repairman/adventurer who assists Jesse and Charlie battle some Aztecs. Look out for Kane Hodder (Jason) in an ape costume. Jesse adopts a fluffy, little baby pterodactyl and a strange creature called a Caterpuppy, a cross between...well you know. You need an open mind and a suspension of disbelief to swallow the outrageous goings on in this movie.
The commentary is better than the one on the first movie. Ethan Wiley and Cunningham get on well and have no quibbles pointing out how crazy the film is. They discuss the budget, tell tales of the late Royal Dano and explain how many of the effects were pulled off within the constraints of the budget. One of the most interesting things they mention is that even tho the movie was stuck in between The Color Purple and Beverly Hills Cop II the kids still preferred House 2 as their fave movie of the summer. But because the movie didn't have it's own opening weekend, unlike the original, it wasn't as successful. Didn't stop 2 more sequels being made. A theatrical trailer is also included.
Much like the first film the picture has been brilliantly transferred onto DVD. The 1.85:1 anamorphic picture looks super with very few glitches. Colors are rendered with pleasant accuracy and you wouldn't believe the low-budget origins when judging this picture. There is some grain during darker scenes but other than this the movie is looking great.
The Mono soundtrack is not terribly engaging and most of the film's sound is centre-channel biased. But there's no hiss or pop to worry about. It may be Mono but it's clean and fresh sounding to me.",1037059200,42,4318,4.820754716981132

The young man reads g-grandpa's journals and decides to dig the old man up - after thinking that the treasure is buried with him.
So, he goes out and digs up the old fart - who turns out is not too happy to have been disturbed.  The Grandpa cusses and shouts and almost kills his g-grandson.  In the end, they become friends and the grandpa is in posession of the skull - it gives immortality to its posessor.  Grandpa hasn't exactly held up all that good while in the coffin... I think he was supposed to have been dug up shortly after being buried, but his buddy was killed before it happened.  Anyway, there is a thing with dimensional portals and all kinds of people trying to grab the sacred skull.
John Ratzenburg (the postman from Cheers) is an electrician who happens to sideline as a trans-dimensional adventurer.  The Evil mean old partner of grandpa comes to get it.  FUN FUN FUN.
This movie kicks much ...  Funny, not scary.",1031529600,3,1162,4.408450704225352
747115,4,6303954197,"House 2 was an OK movie, it was more silly than scary but still an OK flick. Story is This guy goes not to the original house but
a different one. He sees a picture of his G G G Great grandfather on the mantle next to a placeholder that once held a mystical glass skull.
The movie is kind of quirky and it tries to explain what exactly
the power of the glass skull does, (I think it brings the dead back to life)
Anyway Royal Dano plays grandpops and I forget the name of the other guy who play his mean double crossing partner
Anyway the movie jumps back and forth in time zones with bizarre
looking characters and don't forget the cute lil dinosaur bird that stole the skull
I recommend it",1022716800,3,691,4.125925925925926
