8714592,3,B00WY8IUU8,"This is not your average boy meets girl story! (Daisy) is a cannibal who along with her mentally challenged brother Bubba, hunt and kill men for food and fun.(John Doe) is a serial killer who kills women that in his words have ""Defiled their bodies"" with tattoos.

They meet not knowing each other is a killer...But Daisy has a small tattoo and John Doe looks tasty so who will get the best of whom?

The acting is perfect for this over the top Campy film. There is some gore, most of it implied but not outright shown. The effects are hit or miss. Some work, some fail!

It's fun if you're not looking for anything serious and want to escape for an hour and forty five minutes.",1438646400,,678,4.322834645669292
8714593,4,B00WY8IUU8,"The film opens with Bubba (Scott Barrows) and Daisy (Lauren Parkinson) as you typical sibling cannibal twosome. In a subplot, John (Bret Roberts) likes to kill women after sex, especially those with tattoos. When the two meet I was expecting something like ""Psychos in Love"" but it fell short in dark comedy.

The film had some aspects to distinguish it from the genre. One was that Bret Roberts performed his own songs during the film. While not overly memorable, they were certainly topical. The second aspect was the tattoo nudity. The naked victims were porn star Bonnie Rotton and Malice McMunn both famous (or infamous) for their body art work. It seems our siblings had some daddy issues which were not explored and will most likely come out in the prequel after they run the sequels into the ground...if I know the film industry...and I don't.

The main problem I had with the film is that on screen Bret Roberts looks like Chris Cleveland who looks like John Grohl. I had trouble keeping them separate in my mind. There appears to be a certain modern look/grooming the guys are all imitating. If you love this mindless genre, worth a view.
