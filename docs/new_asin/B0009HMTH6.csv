2290821,1,B0009HMTH6,"I was hoping this program would be a bit more balanced in this presentation, but it wasn't.  Unfortunately, they focused more on the skeptic's point of view, while barely touching on the views from those in the field.",1256428800,4,217,4.7105263157894735
2290822,3,B0009HMTH6,"This is ok, it does have the story of a family that was haunted..and then psycholotists, parapsychologists, try and prove or disprove their expirience.",1237075200,,151,5.333333333333333
2290823,3,B0009HMTH6,"First off, I'd like to say I bought the box set for $19.99 and it had this and I believe four others. Last night I got to watch this one, as I didn't have time for the others. Here's my thoughts on this.

First off, if you think you'll be getting a product that is on par with a lot of the newer technology ghost watchers (i.e. ghost hunters) your going to be dissapointed. This show was taped in an earlier time. There is no interesting gadgetry like EMF detectors and such. Just basic ghost lore.

The stories were pretty good. I'm a paranormal fanatic, so if it has to do with the unexplained (of any type, not just ghosts) I sort of gravitate toward it.

However, I also like to learn more to see if there was is a logical explanation to what is going on, and here was this DVD's down point (along with the price of course). At the end of each story, they brought in 'the experts'...The unfortunate thing was that they sounded more like a bunch of kids saying 'ghosts are real...no they're not!'. All of the people against the paranormal, at least in the first two stories, gave no real thoughts to their arguement other than 'it was all in there heads'. They just denied everything and called the people liars. To me, this hurts their credibility. They didn't even TRY to investigate and see why, say, there sounded like footsteps in the hallway of the browns. Ghost hunters will actually walk through a house and check for things making the sounds to debunk it. Just saying 'they're crazy and its all in their head. Also they are lying about everything that happened' doesn't make you an expert, it makes you someone who is not even vaguely interested in the truth.

This being said, I think that a lot of the 'true ghost stories' are phoney. But there are those few that really make you scratch your head... These are what I count as 'paranormal' (whether ghosts or just things beyond our current understanding) and I would have liked them to go a bit deeper into these stories to either debunk them and give what was actually causing the problem, or shrug their shoulders and say 'well, I got nothing'. Overall, slightly disappointing, but the stories are interesting at least.

Do yourself a favor, though, and buy the box set.",1235001600,4,2236,4.497536945812808
2290824,3,B0009HMTH6,"""Unexplained - Hauntings"" was originally aired on the History channel and runs only about 46 minutes. It takes a unique approach to the paranormal occurrences portrayed in that it presents expert arguments for and against these occurrences. There are three case studies covered here - the first is about the Brown family whose house is reputedly haunted by the ghost of a suicide, an elderly man who hasn't found peace in death. The real-life occupants of the house are featured as is the case in all three stories, and these people truly believe the restless spirit of a previous occupant inhabits the house. At the end of the story, various field experts provide their arguments either in support of or against the haunting.

The second story is a haunting in New Brunswick. A family experiences disturbing paranormal events and most horrific of all ,the hauntings continue to follow them as they move homes multiple times. Here too, experts weigh in at the end with their theories as to whether they believe in the hauntings or not.

The last story is about a family residing in a log cabin in Colorado - they believe their home is a 'portal' to another world where spirits travel through frequently. Here too various field experts - a parapsychologist, a historian, a psychologist etc provide their opinions as to whether they believe the hauntings are authentic or not.

Thuogh I found this show interesting, it wasn't as riveting as some other shows especially the ""A Haunting"" series, and also, the price of the DVD here seems too costly for what you get [I watched mine on Netflix]. Other than that, I feel this would engage those who are interested in the paranormal.",1225065600,7,1676,4.832752613240418
2290825,5,B0009HMTH6,I thought this was a great DVD im always on the look out for paranormal information.  The only negative is that it wasn't too long.  but had very interesting tales to tell.  Which I found very interesting!,1218067200,2,205,4.486486486486487
2290826,4,B0009HMTH6,"If you enjoy documentary ghost stories, you will enjoy this video. Worth the money.",1173139200,2,83,5.0
2290827,3,B0009HMTH6,"Although the material presented is fairly interesting, the price of this DVD is much too high for the length (45 minutes total) of the disc. Something along the line of $9.00 would have been much more reasonable.  Three separate ""hauntings"" are presented.  Details of each are shown, followed by efforts to explain the causes.  There are no extras....only the basic 45 minute program.  Recommend that one wait until this comes to the nearest video rental store or, perhaps, acquire it via Netflix.",1124496000,68,497,5.024390243902439

8060908,3,B0009HMTH6,Pretty cool dvd from the late 1990s during the height of the paramormal trend during that time.,1509667200,,95,4.647058823529412
8060909,5,B0009HMTH6,enjoyed this DVD not because I believe in ghosts  but I do believe in hauntings,1490659200,,79,4.266666666666667
8060910,1,B0009HMTH6,"focuses too much on skeptics who  don't believe or understand anything. they should have just let the idiot skeptics out of it completely. it ruined the whole show.  I do not recommend this title for anyone. Try Haunted History instead,it's so much better.",1478390400,,256,4.930232558139535

8060914,2,B0009HMTH6,Short. I should have done more research to see how much recording was done. It was also kinda boring. Not too pleased with this purchase.,1394064000,,137,4.52
8060915,4,B0009HMTH6,"I picked this up cheap in a store - used. I was up late and wanted to start watching it. It actaully started to creep me out - so I shut it off and watched the rest the next day. My main two dissapointments - and why I didn't give 5 Stars - It is only 45 minutes long, 2 hours would have fit this documentary better and the short interviews with some PHd's - and other 'experts'. These people's minds are totally closed. We had a PHd in my family (who is now OUT of my life) - who matches these closed-minded - intellectual idiots very well.
Still - for me 4 Stars means I really like this DVD.  Scott MacNeil.",1354406400,2,610,4.0
8060916,2,B0009HMTH6,"Tonight I borrowed Hauntings from the library which was produced by The History Channel. I have recently watched other movies produced by The History Channel and loved them! I think that they're a reputable network that has varied tastes in their documentaries. However, I was disappointed by this specific film. A couple of years ago I watched the Unsolved Mysteries' series on ghosts and completely fell in love! So I had high hopes for this documentary and it fell DRASTICALLY short.

The film is broken up into three different ghost stories that are told by those who experienced it. Paranormal specialists are then interviewed about the validity of the accounts. Lastly, scholars and skeptics are interviewed to give the other side of the story. Though this was enlightening, it did not give me the chills that I wanted. I found the stories to be weak and boring (not to mention that EVERY single woman had terrible hair!!). The paranormal professionals are wacky and seem unreliable and out of touch while the skeptics look more put together and reliable. Overall, a disappointment. I think I am going to watch the Unsolved Mystery series on ghosts instead.",1274313600,3,1163,4.964102564102564
