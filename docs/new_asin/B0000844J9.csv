7978803,4,B0000844J9,This is one of two bank robbery movies that Donald Sutherland has done. It's a fairly interesting movie that is humorous at times and serious the next. The main interest in this movie is how the bank was cased and the robbery was carried out. A good watch if you have an interest in bank robbery movies.,1392768000,,303,4.333333333333333
