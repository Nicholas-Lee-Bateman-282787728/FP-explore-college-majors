It is good, but not as good as its unabridged show.  The video quality is a little better on YouTube than this.  I like watching it, but would have rather watched it in a different format.
The show has a mix of puppets and human actors, and the characters are entertaining and colorful.  The storyline has mystery, adventure, cheesy but funny bad guys, and a world that didn't get explored enough.  I would almost guess this is what inspired the show LOST.
If you get this, enjoy it, but remember that it is only a movie format of it, and missing a bit of story and events.",1453161600,,734,4.306569343065694

It's definitely one of those movies that sticks with you, with the story and the puppeteering.  ll have this for many years to come.",1387670400,,268,4.037735849056604
