6475072,3,B00L8QP082,"what a ridiculous rehash. The sets are sold separately or will be, and you can purchase them and save 30 bucks in the process. Universal knows how to  make a buck. The original Legacy sets are going for a small fortune however, there were problems with the double-sided discs. several would not play. These are great movies as this package is just another marketing gimmick.",1404432000,2,374,4.753846153846154

6475076,3,B00L8QP082,"I have decided to put my thoughts on this new box set I am glad they have made a up to date collection of the monster collection but there is something that bothers me about this new set I'm glad it has 27 monster classics and I am delighted it includes 3 a+c films as I was saying there's something that bothers me why do we need 3x house of dracula 3x house of frankenstein 2x frankenstein meets the wolf man 3x Abbott and Costello meet frankenstein if you where watching the whole box set start to finish you will might end up watching those films repeatedly the legacy collections are

Dracula x8 films
frankenstein x7 films
the wolf man x7 films
the mummy x 6 films
the invisible man x 6 films
the phantom of the opera 1943 version x 1
the creature from the black lagoon x 3 films
there was another disappointing thing that brought me down I hoped it would include other classic horrors like the black cat dr Jekyll and Mr hyde etc but overall it looks like a nice set I hope it comes out in the UK on region 2",1403827200,12,1015,4.152284263959391

6475078,1,B00L8QP082,"The set looks very nice. If you have never ever owned a Universal Monster film in any format, this is a nice one stop shop of the entire legacy.

To most people who have been fans of these films for years, including myself, it is a complete waste. All it is, is a re-issue of the Legacy Collections, with the Abbott & Costello movies and the 1943 version of Phantom thrown in.

There is absolutely no reason whatsoever to buy this collection with a price tag that insults my intelligence.

They should have done it Blu-ray.

If they had done it Blu-ray as opposed to DVD, the cost would have been less for the studio and consumer, because you can fit more on a Blu-ray, and thus there would be a lot less discs.

Plus, how does a studio go from making an awesome Blu-ray collection, back to making a DVD collection? That is backward progressive technology wise.

They need to do a Volume 2 of The Essential Collection.",1403654400,112,918,4.402366863905326

6475138,4,B00L8QP082,"A vast improvement over the previously released Legacy Collections, owing in no small part to the movies being on single sided disks vs. a one single sided and one flipper disk set where the flipper disk was almost guaranteed to be defective. The expansion of the release to include more of the Abbott and Costello Meet Movies and the Phantom of the Opera is also a welcomed editions, as is the inclusion of the Universal Horror Documentary in the Dracula Set.
That said the major draw back is that the Frankenstein, Dracula and Wolf-Man sets contain duplicate releases of some of the movies, especially House of Frankenstein, House of Dracula, and Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein, and the Phantom of the Opera DVD only includes the 1943 remake, and the other Abbott and Costello Films have been released on a separate collection, Abbott and Costello Meet the Monsters, which makes this box set nearly pointless since the Phantom of the Opera is available in a single volume as well.
Had Universal included more films (such as a set for their Poe Cycle, the 1925 Phantom of the Opera as part of the Phantom 43 set or a Lon Chaney Sr. set, or other Lugosi, Chaney and Karloff films for the other sets<Abbott and Costello meet the Killer Boris Karloff is absent from both this collection and the single volume Abbott and Costello Meet the Monsters Collection>) and new special features this set would be a must own",1515974400,,1418,4.744939271255061

6475384,1,B00L8QP082,"Universal have released all the classic monster the films and their sequels on DVD'S yet again
the first release was with the Legacy edition's way back in 2004
which had DRACULA + the sequels that came with it
FRANKENSTIEN + the sequels
THE MUMMY + the sequels
PHANTOM OF THE OPERA + the sequels
THE INVISIBLE MAN + the sequels
CREATURE FROM BLACK LAGOON plus all the making of featurettes
well this 2015 reissue is no different has exact same content, only Difference is the packaging & cover art
waste of money if you already have the 2004 Legacy edition box sets

DRACULA, FRANKENSTIEN, THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN
THE MUMMY, THE INVISIBLE MAN, PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, CREATURE FROM BLACK LAGOON
and ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTIEN now been released on blu-ray
in new HD transfers & new master audio stereo sound mixes sounds  bigger & better than the old Mono sound
i have all these on blu-ray now, i have thrown out my dvd versions
and the HD transfers for each film looks incredible, much more sharper & clearer in their usual ratio 1:33:1
100 times better than the old Digital remaster transfer, it's High Definition technology, not crappy Digital remaster
plus all the special features from the very old DVD versions have been carried over to each Blu-ray aswell
but for some reason the sequels have still not been released on blu-ray yet
Dracula's Daughter/Son of Dracula, Son of Frankenstein/House of Frankenstien, the Mummy's Hand/the Mummy's Ghost
Wolfman meets Frankenstein etc,
with the exception of Abbott & costello meet Frankenstein which was released on blu-ray in 2014
for some stupid reason Universal still have not released the sequels on blu-ray
which they should have released on blu-ray in new HD transfers when they reissued this Classic monsters collection
it makes no sense to me, alot of stupid people at Universal, no Brains

6475437,4,B00L8QP082,"Basically, in September 2014 Universal released all the Legacy monster sets individually with new repackaging and single sided discs (instead of the original double sided discs) for about $20 each, a lot less than the original sets cost. However, it does NOT appear that the films were remastered at all since the previous release, as they look and sound the same to me.

The Complete 30-Film Collection is selling for $90 on Amazon, so there's a $30 (plus tax) savings compared to buying the individual sets, if you don't own any of them, otherwise you may want to just buy the Legacy sets that you didn't buy before.

The 30-CD Collection includes all 6 of the Legacy sets packaged together and ALSO ADDS 4 BONUS FILMS: 3 Abbott & Costello (meet the Mummy, meet the Invisible Man, and meet Frankenstein) and the 1943 version of Phantom of the Opera. The Abbott & Costello films are all great but the 1943 Phantom is pretty boring. The back of the box names the films in their release order, which is cool if you want to watch them in order.

The original Legacy sets had a lot of special features and it appears that all of them are included here again. A booklet is also included with some details and pics from each film... it's decent but cold have been better.

Neither the original Legacy sets nor the releases nor this package have the 3-D versions of the Creature From the Black Lagoon films. The bluray of the first film DOES have 3-D and the regular version.

Overall, this set offers a lot to those who haven't already bought (some of) the films. Hopefully this is a sign that Universal is remastering all the remaining films for bluray as well as it did the first films, and a bluray set will be released in the near future. I'm holding out for that.",1451433600,,1763,4.5141065830721
6475438,5,B00L8QP082,"What can I say about these old classics. Just love them. The movies of today may be more bloody, but you can't help but feel the creepiness of Dracula or the Monster.

6475440,4,B00L8QP082,"This is really an extension of what I thought of the initial 8 film blu ray release. I loved getting the blu rays of the signature movies. It was the first time I have ever seen the movies, being born in the early 90s and not having a family that cherished the movies, I never got to experience them. The best films so far in my personal opinion are the Invisible Man and Bride of Frankenstein. I don't dislike Dracula or Frankenstein. But those two movies simply better and improve in my view.

This set gets a 4 star not because the movies are bad. I just felt Universal was lazy and that instead of a DVD release, why couldn't they release all 30 legacy films restored like the other set? It makes no sense. These employees are getting paid every day to restore classical movies and I doubt they cannot do the other movies. The picture quality for the sequel movies are pretty good for a DVD. I was watching Dracula's Daughter on my monitor and there were no issues, but it was a night and day difference from the restored blu ray disc. Especially Dracula(1931), that film looked gorgeous.

So I hope a blu ray set comes out. Because I am willing to get it. but please don't spread the same movie on multiple disc, feels disrespectful that Universal would just do that and not do other movies. Why isn't the 1925 Phantom of the Opera on here? I know Universal has some rights to the movie.",1447545600,,1392,4.370656370656371

6475444,4,B00L8QP082,"As a purchaser of the original Monster Legacy with the three busts set which I still think is awesome in concept I got sick and tired of the flipper discs. So I decided to get this because All of the movies in this set are on single sided discs.  I know this is just an all-in-one repackaging of the second editions of all the previous Legacy sets. But considering those sets already exist that way I think it would have made more sense if these movies were put in chronological order. Some, one movie per disc, with their respective bonus features, and others. two movies per disc. I'm sure most people would agree it is a complete waste of discs to have several movies repeated multiple times. It would have been nice if they included Abbott and Costello Meet Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde since that was the only time I believe that Universal had access to that duel character. The Fredric March version which is a property of Paramount studios would unfortunately not be able to be included in this set. Also Lon Chaney Sr.'s Phantom of The Opera silent version should have been a bonus feature on The 1943 Phantom disc. And Finally for The ""Creature"" series of films The Colgate comedy skit 'Abbott and Costello meet the Creature From the Black Lagoon' would have been a great bonus feature to finalize the set. Flawed as this set may be for what I'd like it to be it's still close to a great set for what it is. And I'm still wondering when Hammer is going to put out all of their horror movies in a big box set. Well anyway that's my opinion and I'm sticking to it.",1442361600,4,1564,4.374570446735395

6475453,5,B00L8QP082,"Every generation has something that they remember fondly.  For me, and others who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s, we were a part of the monster kid generation.  We grew up building Aurora monster model kits and reading magazines like Famous Monsters of Filmland.  And we grew up watching the classic Universal Studios horror films, usually shown late at night on the weekends and presented by wild and wacky hostsevery major city had one.  Universal Horror films have been a part of the fabric of cinema since the earliest days and they are the studio most responsible for the horror genre.

In 2004 Universal released their Legacy collections boxed sets for each of their six famous monsters.  The complete collection gathers all of those Legacy sets together in one massive 30 film boxed set.  This means you get all of those Legacy films, from Dracula (1931) to The Creature Walks Among Us (1956).  A complete list of all 30 films is at the bottom of this review.

The One new additionand a curious one at thatis the 1943 version of Phantom of the Opera starring Claude Rains.  Not sure why this one was tossed in the mix since there wasn't a series.  The 1943 version uses a replica of the interior of the better known 1925 silent version which starred Lon Chaney, Sr. although much of the story was altered.

The Complete Collection features all of the bonus features that were included in the original legacy sets.  There are far too many to list but here are some of the highlights:  Abbott & Costello Meet the Monsters, Lugosi: The Dark Prince, Back to the Black Lagoon, Now You See Him: The Invisible Man Revealed, Pure in Heart: The Life and Legacy of Lon Chaney, Jr., Karloff: The Gentle Monster, Shes Alive! Creating the Bride of Frankenstein, Unraveling the Legacy of The Mummy, and Monster by Moonlight.  In addition there are a whopping 16 feature commentary tracks by film historians like Rudy Behlmer and Scott MacQueen.

Among my favorite bonus features is He Who Made Monsters: The Life and Art of Jack Pierce.  This extra looks at the life of makeup pioneer Jack Pierce who created the makeup for Frankenstein, The Mummy, The Wolfman, and many other Universal Horror films.  Pierce was an unparalleled innovator whose techniques are still being used today.

Universal didn't re-engineer the DVDs so you will see that many of the bonus features are duplicated across the various discs since several, such as the Pierce documentary, were included in multiple Legacy set releases.  Another bonus is the 1931 Spanish version of Dracula which many feel is superior to the Lugosi version so you actually get 31 films in the set.

Obviously if you own all of the Legacy sets theres little reason to buy this set even though its a hell of a value at under $100.  But if you dont, then this is a must have.  Even if you own a few of them alreadysell them and get the complete collection to have them all in one place.  The only disappointment to this set is that it is being released on DVD and not blu-ray.  Its high time all of these films hit the blu-ray format.  I am reveling in being 10 years old again and watching Bela, Boris, and Lon again.

6475454,5,B00L8QP082,"I've seen as some concerns from reviewers here that some disks have more than one movie on them. This is true, the discs with the sequel movies have 2 on each, but almost no extras. I see no signs of lack of quality due to compression. There are a few little white flecks on some of the secondary movies, but it is very minor. All of the main movies are of excellent quality. The original theatrical trailers have lots of white flecks and look like what you might expect to see on the friday night creature feature. A DVD will hold over 4 hours  of video without compression, so you can put 2 movies on a disk with virtually no loss of quality and that is exactly what you see here, excellent quality throughout.

3. Would have been a nice touch to have the CFTBL in 3D as in the smaller Blu-ray set (which I also own).

Some of the discs have THREE movies.
I did a comparison to the ones already in my collection, same prints but the new ones are all bad,
How bad is it? How can you enjoy a movie when you have blocky compression patterns moving more than the actors?

6475623,5,B00L8QP082,"as the cliche' goes, they don't make 'em like they used to. not necessarily a tragedy when it comes to movies, since every generation has it's own geniuses, innovations, and points of view, but as per another cliche', every rule has it's exception. (my apologies if this review makes me sound like a prude, but when it comes to this, damn it, i AM a prude!)
the ""permissive society"" of the '60s and '70s was devoted to tearing down taboos, an in the process it did a number of ideals a world of good. nonetheless it must be held accountable for enabling the all-time great tragedy of cinema, the end of horror in the ""fright"" sense of the word. it's hard to say just what happened - maybe an experiment went wrong, maybe some sicko was actively trying to undermine the artistry-driven nature of the Dracula/Frankenstein type movies - but either way it eventually dawned on someone that for half the budget (not to mention about one 90th the work) you could just spray red syrup on everything in sight. to describe it as all downhill from there would be like saying ""cannibalism isn't a very nice thing to do.""
for my entirely life, it seems, the likes of Dracula and Frankenstein have been written off as tame, Saturday morning cartoon-level fare. there are people my age, even some my parents' age, who'd think i was pulling their leg if i was to point out that at the time, Dracula was considered so shocking that nurses were stationed at every theatre where it played as equal parts safety measure and publicity stunt. fortunately i'm not alone in appreciating these films, however out-of-style they might be, but still, nothing like them can ever be done again.
there are two significant problems here, two elements that the horror genre is the poorer for having since lost (or discarded). what the idiots behind the ""gore"" movies fail if not refuse to understand is that blood is NOT scary, it's GROSS, and there's a difference.
but more than that, these are multifaceted characters with depth. however edgy they might've seemed at the time, they were still built on storytelling and craftsmanship. these are characters with dimensions.
only a few of the characters presented here are villains per se. the most genuinely evil of the bunch is Dracula, and even him you have to feel something for, condemned as he is for Eternity to a frigid limbo between life and death. (granted, he brought it on himself and so probably doesn't deserve your pity, but try telling that to your heart rather than your brain.) there's a certain poignancy to his tragedy.
my favorite is Frankenstein, who's far too innocent (some would even say loveable) to be a true villain. neither his ugly face nor the morally dubious conditions of his birth are his fault. after all, he didn't ask to be (re)born. and lest you forget, he has to be provoked before he becomes in any way dangerous. the true villain of these movies, the Mob Mentality, makes Freddie Kruger look like Santa Claus.
The Mummy's tale is basically a love story, and every bit as poignant a one as any Casablanca or Romeo & Juliet. his soul is tortured as much by a desire for love as his monotonous immortality. through this character we get some idea what Dracula might've been like without the megalomania.
The Wolfman isn't nearly so scary for being such a primal ghoul as for the suggestion that he could've sprouted from the psyche' of such a likable ""everyman"" as Lon Chaney, Jr.
admittedly these psychological ramifications get a bit formulaic at a certain point, but it's nonetheless the edge they have on their modern would-be equivalents. where those characters are zombies in the automaton as well as the undead sense of the word, the classic Universal lineup had a capacity for visceral as well as physical tragedy. they raise issues and evoke feelings, and that's why they continue to resonate even in an age when it's debatable whether they're technically ""scary"" anymore.
you mark my words: if something even baser and more despicable, something EVEN LESS WHOLESOME, than gore movies was to come along tomorrow, Jason and Freddy would be swept under the rug and completely forgotten within a decade. because those zero-dimensional characters would literally have nothing left.
it's one of the great regrets of my life that these movies lost a certain luster before i was even born. even if i could find The Doctor and persuade him to take me on-board the TARDIS, i'm afraid i'm just too much a product of the modern era to ever perceive, to FEEL, how horror-in-the-horror-sense movies affected audiences in their heyday. i really should wring Jason's neck for that.
but i digress...
the product itself is quite delightful in most senses of the word. they took care to retain the commentaries and documentaries of old, and even made room for Abbott & Costello's showdowns with the characters herein. that wasn't really necessary in my case because, being and even bigger fan, i already had the complete Abbott & Costello movie set. but it's still a nice touch. it still feels right.
the principle drawback is that there are some harder to justify redundancies. the goal of the ""Complete Legacy Collection"" is for each compilation to showcase every case of a given monster's output. so, since House Of Frankenstein, House Of Dracula, and Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein involve Dracula, Frankenstein, and The Wolfman, you get three copies of each. in hindsight it might've been a better idea to offer us more rabid enthusiasts a single complete compilation rather than several specialized ones. or maybe they should've offered the selection in chronological order, Volumes 1-4, or whatever it would work out to.
but the imperfection of the presentation in no way neutralizes the power or value of the films themselves. granted, as with any selection this large, quality of product fluctuates from movie to movie, but on the whole it won't let you too far down. this is what horror was meant to be.
i'm not nave. i don't expect to sway anyone our there who's grown up on the idea that the horror genre was meant as a safe-haven from such nitpicky concepts as artistry and craftsmanship. i'm well aware that this review pretty much preaches to the choir. but make no mistake: the choir is out there, and for the Complete Legacy Collection we say Hallelujah!",1417910400,4,6322,4.806244260789716

What convinced me to finally purchase this box set is realizing that odds are slim that a lot of these movies included in the box set will receive a Blu Ray release anytime soon. If you are debating on getting this set or waiting to see if there is a Blu Ray set, you will be pleased with this. While some people complain about duplicate movies in the box set, that is because Universal sells the DVDs of each monster individually in case people don't want all the monsters. The box set also includes Phantom of the Opera, and I will admit I am confused as to why they only included the 1943 version. I also would have liked to see Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, but I am not sure if that belongs to Universal or not. The only reason I gave box set four stars has nothing to do with the movies, but with Amazon. They sent me a box set where some of my DVDs were already opened and the rest were still sealed. If I had to rate Amazon for how they sent me this package, I would give them only one star.",1417305600,2,1162,4.100877192982456

6475652,5,B00L8QP082,"A really fantastic release; before this came along I was considering buying the green legacy collection set and while that set is not necessarily bad, the movies are presented on double-sided DVDs which makes them more prone to scratches. However, I'm glad Universal decided to release this box set where all the movies are presented on single-sided DVDs. The box art is cool and the box that holds all these movies is nice and sturdy, no cheap cardboard here. The booklet included in this release contains some interesting trivia, though if you're super-fan who pretty much knows all the behind the scenes for each of these movies then the booklet may not be that important. The movies look and sound pristine and some of them have been transferred from the blu-ray release.

I don't know why some people are raising an eyebrow at the 1943 version of Phantom of the Opera; personally with a good majority of these movies being somewhat tragic, I think it fits in perfectly. Yeah it may not be the 1925 version with Lon Chaney, but what most people are forgetting is the fact that it's public domain and there's already a blu-ray release of it.

If I had only one minor nitpick it's the fact that with this release (as with previous DVD releases) you're going to be double-dipping on some films between the Dracula, Frankenstein and Wolf Man series. It's not something that should prevent you from purchasing this, but it is something you should know. Also, if you're expecting a 3D version of the Creature of the Black Lagoon or Revenge of the Creature, then you should look elsewhere.

Overall, this is really great release and I encourage people who haven't considered watching these old horror movies to give these ones a chance. You won't regret it.",1416700800,4,1754,4.7631578947368425

I owned the Legacy sets and was a bit on the fence about whether or not I should upgrade to this box set. Eventually the price came down a bit and I pulled the trigger. I don't regret it one bit. The whole package just screams class: the embossed box, the individual boxes for each monster, and nice little book that's included. The packaging isn't weak or flimsy. It will look great on my horror movie collection shelves. And unlike the Legacy sets, the discs are all single sided, which solves many of the playback issues that some people reported with the double sided Legacy discs (for the record, mine all played fine, although the menThus were sometimes sort of ""scrambled,"" for lack of a better word). And just as important for me, all the extras omit any reference to the movie Van Helsing, which remains one of the worst excuses for a monster picture to ever wound my retinas.

The films look great. I haven't done a side by side comparison with my old sets, and honestly, I probably will never get around to that. If you're super picky about that stuff, you might ask around. There seem to be some strong opinions about what Universal did and didn't do right. For my money, they did just about everything right.

A very economical way of having all these movies, that is providing you don't have any of them from the many previous releases from the folks at Universal.

Having the films on one-sided discs and in packaging that is much easier to remove the discs is a vast improvement over the previous sets and the addition of the Abbott and Costello films and the 1943 Phantom of the Opera was certainly welcome (I already own The Phantom of the Opera - The Ultimate Edition that was released by Image Entertainment in 2003).  Sure the duplication of certain films seems wasteful, but not enough to deter me from buying the set.  The transfers generally look very good to my non-expert eye in comparison to the older legacy sets.  I am quite satisfied with the purchase overall.

6475730,3,B00L8QP082,"Universal has released yet another 'corrected' multiple-film package that addresses the defective double-sided disc debacle from a decade ago.  C'mon guys, it was a total waste of disc space to repeat certain titles up to 3 times for the sake of maintaining some kind of timeline integrity when MANY other classic features could have graced this box while still following year of release continuity!  Once again, a truly money-driven and un-inspired decision on the part of Universal.

And why must there always be alterations on things that aren't broken in the first place?  Two examples I've come across so far:  on FRANKENSTEIN, Universal has elected to go back to the murky, un-intelligible DNR ladened soundtrack first employed in the 1999 DVD issue.  This was corrected for the mid-2000 Legacy collection, which saw a return of the cleaner, distortion free soundtrack of earlier video incarnations on VHS and laserdisc.  So what prompted them to go back to this inferior, distracting sound element?  The other great mystery is why they chose to create a wide-screen (1.85:1) presentation of CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON when it was NEVER released theatrically in this format?  If it was to appease the modern home theater enthusiasts who prefer a more technically up to date presentation, this was a futile effort to say the least.  Classic film purists and others who fondly remember these films on the late-night tube are the target audience for these films, and would prefer them in their original form.

Concerning the absence of a blu-ray release:  I have viewed several of the primary features on both this new standard DVD set and the recent blu-ray 8 disc collection and can honestly say that you'd be hard-pressed to find a substantial difference in image and sound quality between them.  If there is, it would be difficult to discern as BOTH exhibited a razor sharp picture and fine contrast levels.  Furthermore, I find it hard to believe that Universal would ever commit the resources to up-grading and/or doing full blown restorations to any of the secondary titles in this collection for a blu-ray release as the original elements no longer exist for many and the high cost of readying them for HD would be impractical by any stretch of the imagination.",1411776000,17,2276,5.002652519893899

6475734,4,B00L8QP082,"I love classic monster movies. From the time I was a young kid I was fascinated by the likes of Lugosi, Karloff, and Chaney (Sr. and Jr.). So no big surprise when I saw Amazon selling a box set titled Universal Classic Monsters Complete 30-Film Collection I had to grab it and this morning it arrived on my doorstep. And I'm sure I'll love it. Some of the sequels weren't the best, but it's still a wonderful collection.

But going through the discs real quick I notice something. The collection is Universal's six Legacy Collections that have been out for several years (Dracula, Frankenstein, Wolf Man, Mummy, Invisible Man, and Creature from the Black Lagoon) as well as the Claude Raine's version of Phantom of the Opera. And because those original Legacy Collections were sold individually rather than as a set there's several movies that repeat themselves with the set (such as about three copies each of House of Frankenstein and House of Dracula). Meanwhile there's no movie older than Dracula (1931) (which also means not one single film featuring the man of 1000 faces, Lon Chaney). Why not, instead of just repackaging old collections, create a new one, especially if you're going to label it ""Complete"". ""Complete"" to me would include a lot more movies, including some great silent films. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, The Werewolf, Hunchback of Notre Dame, the Lon Chaney version of Phantom of the Opera, and The Man Who Laughs would all be great movies to include. Not to mention ""newer"" movies than those included in the collection such as It Came From Outer Space or The Mole People, or even modern Universal monster films such as Van Helsing. Not to mention the packaging is very ten years ago and bulky rather than the more streamlined packaging of modern box sets, despite this set having just been released less than three weeks ago. Also, only available on DVD, in this day and age where nearly everything is exclusively Blu-ray or digital (the Blu-ray box set is only 8 films for almost the exact same cost via Amazon Prime as these 30).

Still, I love these movies and the price was nice and cheap (thank you, Amazon Prime), and they have a lot of great special features. So while it could be a lot better, I am still very much so looking forward to a monster movie a day this October.",1411171200,,2303,4.669950738916256

I did some brief previews of all the movies and I gotta say that I'm really quite surprised how great all the movies look in this DVD set. Especially the main movies, which use the blu ray restorations. They all look and sound fantastic. On some the sequels there's very minimal dirt/dust specs, but they're still great looking. I've never seen any of the ""Abbot and Costello"" flicks, but while doing some previewing I found them damn entertaining and cannot wait to get to them. I know folks are upset on not getting a Blu ray version, but quite honestly, that's not a problem for me at all. The transfers on all the movies here are the best on DVD.

If you have some of the films, a better choice may be to buy the rest individually and save money on the box set. To me, the absence of the Blu-Ray format is a non-issue, but if that's important to you, you might want to wait for a possible future release of the entire collection on Blu-Ray (there is already an abbreviated Blu-Ray edition consisting of the 8 original titles only, along with the same informative booklet included with this DVD set).

If you are like me and don't need Blu-Ray, this box set has everything you need, brought together in a nice package. It doesn't have the cool busts of Frankenstein, Dracula and The Wolf Man that came with the earlier Legacy box set, but it has the advantage of being composed of all single-sided discs, instead of the reportedly unstable double-sided discs provided with the earlier set. All the bonus features of the various earlier releases are included here, as are 4 additional movies: ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN, ABBOTT AND COSTELLO) MEET THE MUMMY, ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET THE INVISIBLE MAN, and the Claude Rains version of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (I would have preferred the original silent Lon Chaney version of the latter film).

This set also includes the restored version of DRACULA, complete with bloodcurdling screams from Renfield and Dracula's prolonged death groan. For some reason, some releases of DRACULA reverted to the earlier watered-down, edited version, and I'm happy to hear the complete soundtrack  again restored here.

One omission for which I was actually grateful was that the promos for VAN HELSING, included with the lavish original Legacy box set,  were left off this collection.

The lowered Amazon price of just over $90.00 made this set very attractive to me, even though I already owned the earlier Legacy editions and subsequent newer releases of DRACULA, FRANKENSTEIN and THE WOLF MAN.

To sum up, if you're a Universal Classic Monster fan and have beaten your brains out trying to decide which DVD collection to own, this set is a no-brainer. You could call Dr. Frankenstein and have him install a new brain for you; or you could ""head off"" the problem by relaxing with these wonderfully therapeutic old shock treatments.",1409788800,61,2329,4.866161616161616

6475761,5,B00L8QP082,"Let me first address what seems to be the biggest gripe here: that this is a DVD release. While we would all prefer a blu-ray release, I have the 'Classics Monster' set that was released two years ago on blu ray.....I also have a few of these films that weren't included in that set on DVD. Let me just say - to my eye - the difference between blu-ray and DVD for these films is pretty negligible. These are 1:1.33 ratio films in black and white that were filmed over 50 years ago. It's NOT the same as comparing blu-ray and DVDs for a modern release. The biggest differences, in my opinion, between the Universal Monster blu-rays and DVDs in my collection is that the 8 blu-ray films in the 2012 set were given better care in terms of fixing all the damage to the prints - all those little specks and other print damage have been fixed for pretty much a pristine image. I would hope that those newly digitally repaired prints for Dracula, Frankenstein, Wolf Man, Bride of Franeknstein, Invisible Man, Phantom of the Opera, Revenge of the Creature, and The Mummy would be included in this release - only on DVD. In addition, most modern blu-ray players will play DVDs at a higher resolution.

Also consider that if this was a blu ray release, the price would be much, much higher. I nearly paid the price for this set just for the 8-film blu-ray release in 2012. I'm undecided if I will be getting this release since I would be re-purchasing some of the films, but to get pretty much the entire catalogue of Universal Classic horror films for under 100 dollars - that's a very, very good deal. And it looks like the set is very attractively packaged.",1409443200,24,1650,4.4635761589403975
6475762,2,B00L8QP082,"Rating is for the overall set and not the films.
I should have known and I should have waited. When Universal first put the preorders out on this, I knew $180 was way over what the set really should be worth on DVD. However, when the price dropped to $90, I jumped at ordering it thinking it would be worth it. After receiving it today, the bottom line is that this a $50 set and should have been put out as such. Its not the films because I knew what I was getting. Im fine with that and to that end, thats why I purchased it, but the packaging and presentation is left to be desired.
The box that holds the individual cases is that standard flimsy card board box. In a year, you'll be looking at it noticing all the crappy shelf-wear from just sitting on your shelf.
The book is just a throw away really. Some pretty pics and a facts but thats it. The cases are ok, again standard, but nothing to say, ""wow, this set is really worth the $100"".
The discs are better then the release 10 years ago. Gone is the double sided crap and replaced with single sided DVDs. However, I was hoping for a little art wk on the disc but no go. Just black with a very generic silver title in a standard font.
I can't even begin to comprehend how Universal thought this was going to be a $180 set based on content, packaging and display. Im wondering now if a bit of the o'l bait and hook was used or if their marking people are just that out of touch with pricing in todays DVD/Blu world. I can say this, no one has ever accused Universal of being edgy or trend setters when it comes to their putting out films in collections.
Bottom line, if you don't own any of these, wait for the price to drop to $50. If you do own them, its not really worth the price to add this to your collection.",1409356800,29,1773,4.112391930835735

But, as for Universal Pictures, I must congratulate them on their 100th anniversary, and this set is a rather handsome set. Also, it would be nice to have all classic monster flicks in one set, no scrambling to find separate cases. I love every horror flick that Universal ever made, including the sci-fi ultimate collections, The Bela Lugosi Collection and the Boris Karloff Collection. Their horror/sci-fi movies just have something about them. A sci-fi flick that will always stand out for me is ""This Island Earth'. Back to the set: if I were to purchase this set, the older legacies would be going up for sale. Also, will they sell now that the new set has arrived/will be arriving?

6475775,4,B00L8QP082,"This is a good product for people like me who really enjoy watching these older Universal monsters. It makes me sad that I bought the original separate sets of each monster's legacy back when the movie ""Van Helsing"" came out. The thing I like most about it is that, unlike the first set, all movies are single sided disks. What I have at home now have double sided disks which I dislike greatly. It also is a very attractive boxed set and includes a nice booklet. I'm still deciding whether or not to try to sell my original set to pick up this one or not. The problems are:
1. The Price. As of this writing it is listed as $179.98. That is a very steep price for movies which I already own, just in a different format.
2. I would not call this actually 'complete'. The reason is because it includes SOME of the Abbot & Costello films dealing with monsters, ""A&C meet Frankenstein"" being the most famous. Although they include A&C meet Frankenstein, The Mummy, and the Invisible Man, they excluded where they meet Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde and the killer, Boris Karloff. To some, this is a small matter. To me, if you include some, you should include them all. I don't like having to buy the two separately if I want them. It's true that perhaps they did not include the A&C movie where they meet Jeckyl & Hyde because there is no serious movie on that ""monster"" included. The other where they meet Boris Karloff is not exactly a 'monster' meeting, but still belongs in this set in my opinion.
The one film I do not have that is included in this set but not ever in the legacy collections is ""Phantom of the Opera"". That, too, sparks my interest in owning this box set.
So, if you already bought this set in legacy boxes, you just need to decide how much you are willing to spend to have single sided disks rather than double sided disks. Maybe, since I have the movies already, I can hold off until this set has a deep discount and hopefully snatch it up then.",1407196800,8,1959,4.340599455040872
6475776,4,B00L8QP082,"This is more of a follow-up to several of the other comments regarding CLASSIC MONSTERS.

Like so many others, I bought (or was given) the 2004 Legacy Monster Collections and enjoyed them a great deal.  What puzzles me is why Universal chose to bastardize this set with 3 Abbott & Costello send-ups on Disc 6?  ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN will always stand out as one of the duo's best films.  But the other 2 were weak.  Disc #6 should have been eliminated...or pressed with the header: ""The Classic Monsters You Might Have Forgotten.""  This way....films like ""Man Made Monster"", ""The Spider Woman"", ""Captive Wild Woman"", and some of the lesser known 'B Program Pictures' could have comprised that 6th Disc.

For those of us who enjoyed watching the monster films on television...it wasn't necessary to reference Abbott & Costello and turn the classic monsters into a comedy-fest.",1406678400,3,889,4.966216216216216

Changing these formats and getting people to replace DVD's with BLU-RAY and buy new machines is the real scam.  DVD's are just fine, thank you very much.  No difference from BLU-RAY.  And I hate the way companies are just putting extra features on the blu-ray - or forcing consumers to buy both dvd and blu-ray in one package.  THAT'S the scam - I'll stick with dvd's.

But to this set, I have the old Dracula and Frankenstein ones - never got the others.  Love this set - I will buy it.  Always wanted Wolfman and the Creature.  Gonna get it here plus Abbott and Costello.

These movies are the best.  Bride of Frankenstein is in my top 5 movies of all time.  Just a complete masterpiece.  Dracula is so creepy.  Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein is just great.  LOVE the Creature movies.  And Frankenstein vs Wolfman is excellent.

This set, and these movies are too good to cry about Blu-Ray.  Geeks might see a big difference, but there is no big difference from dvd.  Like I say , the scam is getting people to THINK that and re-buy movies and buy the players.  And these were released on blu-ray already anyways a couple years ago - do a search for it.

6475783,4,B00L8QP082,"From April to October 2004, Universal released six boxed sets, dubbed ""Legacy Collections,"" each devoted the one of the studio's classic monsters [Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, the Mummy, the Invisible Man, the Wolf Man and Gill-man (a.k.a. ""the creature from the black lagoon"")]. On September 2, 2014, Universal is re-releasing each of these six sets in new, slimmer packaging, this time as ""Complete Legacy Collections."" This boxed set, ""Universal Classic Monsters: The Complete 30-Film Collection,"" is a combination/consolidation of these six re-releases, along with the puzzling inclusion of the 1943 version of `The Phantom of the Opera'. Before I go any further, here is the list of films included, broken down by starring monster:

DRACULA
Dracula (1931)
Dr&aacute;cula (Spanish version) (1931)

OTHER
The Phantom of the Opera (1943)

*NOTE: Both `Creature from the Black Lagoon' and `Revenge of the Creature' were originally released to theaters in 3-D. Neither of the 3-D versions is included here.

This set strikes me as a prototype by Universal for a similar Blu-ray boxed set which may or may not already be in the works. (Indeed, at least ten of the above films have already been released on Blu-ray.) This latter boxed set may be an inevitability, or yet to be greenlit, with Universal waiting to gauge the reception of the DVD version. Either way, here are the pros and cons of ""The Complete 30-Film Collection"" as I see them:

PROS:
- All of the original classic Universal monster movies in the same place for the first time
- Takes up fairly little shelf space
- Consists entirely of single-sided discs, unlike the double-sided discs in the problem-plagued `04 Legacy Collections
- The informational booklet contains the exact release dates of the films, so you can watch them in the order of release without having to do time-consuming research (they are also listed in chronological order on the back of the box)

CONS:
- Not available on Blu-ray
- Nothing new added (special features, et al.) vis-&agrave;-vis the Complete Legacy Collections (or, so far as I can tell, vis-&agrave;-vis the original Legacy Collections)
- 3-D versions of `Creature from the Black Lagoon' and `Revenge of the Creature' not included
- The largely unremarkable (and not especially ""monstrous"") 1943 version of `The Phantom of the Opera' is included, beating out more resonant offerings like `Island of Lost Souls' (1932), `The Black Cat' (1934), the Ape Woman trilogy (1943-1945), or even the original Lon Chaney version of `Phantom' (1925).

In summary, this boxed set appears to be a curious stepping stone between the Legacy Collections of a decade ago and a future Blu-ray ""ultimate edition."" To anyone who already has the Legacy Collections ('04 or '14), this set is redundant, while to anyone who is waiting patiently for HD, this set feels like a shameless tease. In the meantime, I, for one, am just hoping that ""Universal Classic Monsters: The Complete 30-Film Collection"" is a portent of even better things to come.
