174519,3,0983298122,"This dvd is super super gentle.  Which is what I THOUGHT I needed, but I realized I need more.

Carroll is sincere and clearly knows his business. But little more ""instruction"" separate from the routine would help.",1368057600,,214,4.756756756756757
174520,5,0983298122,"Very slow moving, kinda boring,  yet nice stretches and movements if you have extreme upper back and shoulder pain and just can't stand doing nothing for it. You can do this!  My back felt relaxed after the first view, and stronger after the 8th.",1367193600,9,246,4.568181818181818
174521,5,0983298122,"Got this video for my chronic neck/upper back after reading the good reviews on it.  I totally agree with them.  Have had  physical therapy since my back surgery which did not do the job, but since starting this a month ago, have had very good results with lowering the muscle tension/burning/locked neck symptoms.  This is not an instant cure, but if you are consistent with it, can help heal the symptoms.  Cain Carroll says to do it for 100 days, alternating the 2 routines he has and that is what I am doing.  Regular yoga has been too rough on my upper back/neck area but the motions and stretches with this are gentle enough for even me with my fibromyalgia.  I do recommend it.  We are also thinking of trying his video for helping with digestive disorders.",1360713600,25,764,4.525547445255475
174522,5,0983298122,"I have been practicing yoga for years and still tend to hurt my neck and back due to working in front of computer at my job all day long, and this is the most gentle, relaxing and yet so effective, resulting in the same benefits as physical therapy or massage.  The movements are fluid without stressing joints and calming.  If I do this DVD during my lunch break, I can get through the day without excruciating pain.",1357084800,17,417,4.402597402597403
174523,5,0983298122,"Love it! Really helps me relax and it relieves me from my neck and shoulder pain!
Would deff. recommend it!",1353369600,6,107,4.4
174524,5,0983298122,"When I played the DVD, I did not stop at any time, because Cain Carrol explains every move very clearly and with patience so I had the time to do the exercises while he was talking.
Even for people who's native language is not English (I am from the Netherlands), it is easy to follow. Normally I have to stop the DVD and look again, because it is going to fast, but this one is perfect. I am very pleased with this DVD.",1317427200,20,420,4.072289156626506
174525,5,0983298122,"As a massage therapist, I encounter so many clients and co-workers with shoulder and neck tension/injuries and this dvd, it's exercises and healing suggestions, is what I share with most of them. You have a choice of two different routines, both only 20 min. long so it seems to fit into anyone's schedule. I also find that throughout the day if I do one or two of the exercises that I remember for a few minutes, it keeps my tension from building up at the end of day. In the world we live in today, with all the driving we do and hours spent on computers,  this dvd is essential for us all.",1305590400,33,592,4.238938053097345
174526,5,0983298122,"I have a disc issue and am always looking for yoga poses, stretches, and any exercises to alleviate pain and increase range of motion. Cain's video is easy for anyone of any age and athletic ability to follow! He covers a wide range of exercises that are fun and easy to do -- his instruction and demonstrations are flawless. I love that he even demonstrates how to posture yourself while standing, at the computer, driving and sleeping. It doesnt get more thorough than that. I absolutely loved the video and would definitely purchase more videos from this very skilled and caring teacher. Also contains relaxing music and beautiful scenery. Alot of care and thought went into this video.",1303171200,32,689,4.8474576271186445

174528,4,0983298122,"I like this DVD for help with my neck and shoulder pain.  He also includes a brief therapy session for frozen shoulder, which I have.  I wish he made a DVD for the lower back.",1482278400,,175,3.9714285714285715
174529,4,0983298122,"Since I have a shoulder injury because of which I can't do my regular yoga anymore, and my mobility is very limited at the moment, I was looking for something exactly like this. The DVD is really useful. My only reservation is that I think it is possible to add some more poses / exercises.",1477699200,,290,4.290909090909091

174533,5,0983298122,I have not been using this DVD very long but i really like the moves and the gentleman who takes you through it.  I am hoping he will help me strengthen my neck.  Through the years I have had 2 frozen shoulders so I also hope this will keep my shoulders in good shape too.  I had back problems before I started doing yoga.  Yoga helped my back a LOT.  I do yoga at least 3 times a week.,1472256000,2,386,3.8354430379746836

174535,5,0983298122,"I have been doing this dvd for two weeks now, and have found it to be very helpful.  It is easy to follow, and very calming.  It could be used as a warm up or a cool down for any exercise program, or used as a stand-alone.  There are two routines, one that is 20 minutes, and one that is 23 minutes.  I find that my shoulder and neck pain are reducing, and I am gaining some mobility.  I still have a long way to go in my healing, but I am very encouraged after doing this.  My daughter also has started doing the routines, and says it has helped her as well.  Both of us play string instruments, and we tend to get very tight from playing.
Lastly, my massage therapist has noticed a difference as well, and I am happy that I invested in the dvd.  Much cheaper than physical therapy, or a doctor visit.",1435363200,3,802,4.063694267515924
174536,5,0983298122,"I have a pinched nerve in my neck, and this usually helps instantly when I'm feeling tightness/pain.  I don't do it as regularly as I should, but that's on me.  There are two routines, 20 and 23 minutes each, which is a nice amount of time, and allows you to alternate day by day.",1426464000,,280,4.166666666666667

174539,5,0983298122,"A life saver!  I've had neck and shoulder trouble for years.  The two 20 min routines on mobility and flow are WOW!
A great job of intergrating yoga and chi gong. I""m just starting, but Cain gives you hope that you can live a pain free life.",1406332800,,241,4.1063829787234045

174541,4,0983298122,"I have two herniated discs in my neck.  There are few exercises I can do, and it is very frustrating.  I tried this dvd out a few days ago. Maybe it is my imagination, but my neck felt better the next day.  I like the fact that it is not too lengthy.  Hopefully, I can start using it on a regular basis.",1384560000,8,303,3.838709677419355
174542,4,0983298122,"I like this video and the stretches are helpful.  My only complaint is that I mostly bought it because I like the pose he is doing on the cover of the video, and it felt like a good stretch to me, so I wanted to see what his directions are for doing it.  But it's not in the video!",1380844800,3,281,3.7457627118644066
174543,5,0983298122,"I have migraines due to neck pain, slipped disc from accident years ago.  Had done PT long ago but have neglected my neck and figured I need to do something with the onset of migraines.  So, why not try this?  The exercises are super easy, I don't need a video to show me how to do these, but I need the video to help me with the discipline of actually doing the exercise.  Within a week I noticed improvement in my neck and less frequency in my neck pain and migraines.  I will be sticking with the video, only 20 minutes a day.  Pleased with purchase.",1380326400,17,553,4.169811320754717
174544,5,0983298122,"This is one of the best yoga DVDs I've ever purchased.  Cain Carroll is a very thorough instructor (make sure you watch the introduction & ""foundations"" in which he explains different aspects of how to do the moves and things to keep in mind regarding the routines) and he doesn't neglect to remind the viewer of how to move & consider one's body throughout the routine (""Remember to breathe deeply, don't worry if you're not doing the move as fast as I am,"" etc).  This DVD also includes tips on how to treat one's body better during daily activities like sleeping, driving, sitting at one's desk, or ""schlepping"" an item-- practical tips and posture applications which I've never seen in any other yoga DVD ever.

The only criticism I have is that there are a few points where the sound seems to ""drop out"" and become muffled--especially during the ""foundations"" portion, you might have to rewind to catch the first bit of his sentence at one point because it is important information but the sound quality suddenly drops to a point where it's very difficult to hear him; at other points in the DVD the sound drops out for a moment or two but it's really not that jarring as that one point.

In 2011 I was diagnosed with ""military neck"" by an orthopedic surgeon.  It turns out a lifetime of bad habits and a particularly arduous work environment caught up with me.  I had to quit my job and a cortisone shot to the muscle was not an option, so I went to physical therapy and the exercises they gave me have not been helpful (or maybe I do them incorrectly at home, I don't know).  I've changed my pillow, adjusted my posture, I've gotten massages, I've done heating pads, I've tried to find illegal painkillers, everything.  Mr. Carroll's DVD is my last resort before trying to get together the money to see a chiropractor (don't have medical insurance) or perhaps an acupuncturist.

Mr. Carroll specifically says in the ""foundations"" portion of this DVD that it takes 100 days to heal, and that one should do this DVD every day for 6 days, then rest on the seventh day.  I'm on Day 6 and am extremely optimistic.  Even if this DVD doesn't enable me to heal myself to the point I would like, I do feel a difference in my pain and it's still one of the most comprehensive yoga DVDs I've ever purchased taught by an instructor who has put a lot of thought into how to best explain what's going on.",1370476800,27,2397,4.5
174545,5,0983298122,"I have cervical stenosis, facet arthropathy, and herniated disks in C3-4, 4-5, 5-6, and C6-7.  I have participated, over the years, in physical therapy twice, and used Vinyoga techniques to help.  Not only was this dvd easy to use, but I felt some improvement by the time I finished the two different sets of therapy provided by Cain Carroll.
My only wish is that Cain Carroll will put together a program for the Lumbar back.  I really need it.",1370390400,12,444,4.594936708860759

7795174,5,0983298122,The excercises help me with my Cervical Dystonia. Ive had a hard time finding exercise DVDs that are for the neck. This is a very relaxing video and you can go at your own pace if you need too. I have neck pain and these exercises are helping me build strength and loosen my neck and have more movement. I was told by my doctor that I need to exercise not only because of the Dystonia but I also have Osteopenia. Thiis heal neck and shoulder pain is doing exactly what it says it does.,1517875200,,485,4.11578947368421

7795176,5,0983298122,I have cervical stenosis and a bad rotator cuff. Since I started using this program a few weeks ago I have much greater range of motion in my neck and shoulder and I move with much less pain. Just be careful to take it easy when you start and listen to your body. Glad I tried this as it is much less hassle than going to physical therapy a few times a week and has really helped with both pain and range of motion.,1512604800,,415,3.9523809523809526
7795177,5,0983298122,This DVD is amazing! The videos are great and his voice is soothing. I feel relaxed listening to his instruction and the calm backdrop. The stretches really do help relieve the tension in my neck and shoulders. I have chronic muscle tension in those areas and live with pain and discomfort on a daily basis. I do struggle being dedicated but am trying to do the short videos regularly since they help with relieving the pain and discomfort I have been having. Highly recommend the videos! You won't be disappointed!,1504656000,,515,4.733333333333333

7795179,5,0983298122,"The movements on this DVD are crazy effective. I have a torn rotator cuff on the right and a left shoulder that had RT surgery a few years back...AND C-4, C-5 & C-6 are all fused.  So lots of issues.  And these movements done regularly give me freedom and reduction in discomfort I haven't felt in a long time. During the hand massage section, and this happens every time, I actually feel the range of movement in my neck massively expand instantly.  It's like a switch being turned on.  It would be great if it would only stay that way.  But I'll take what I can get.",1489622400,3,568,4.271028037383178
