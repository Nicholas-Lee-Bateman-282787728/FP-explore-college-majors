What a shame.",1514332800,,261,4.137254901960785
8641285,1,B00IDI30P8,"Better than U.S. redo, ""Humans,"" but producers did not wish to capture revenue from selling with English subtitles.  Small fiscal investment to add subs, but money not as important to producers as snub to English speakers.  I refuse to buy season #1 with English subtitles as cannot understand season #2 as no subs.  Can't fix stupid - they invested in one of two seasons with English.  Shameful, foolish, and disloyal to those who funded the show and actors therein.",1511568000,2,467,4.8734177215189876
