To answer the other reviewer, a 4K restoration does not imply that its 4K resolution, only that it was scanned at 4K to get maximum detail for the Blu-ray format. Most Criterion Collection blu-rays are scanned at 4K, but none of them are 4K transfers. Hollywood is only doing that to movies they think will sell well enough.",1532649600,2,485,4.705882352941177
8750013,1,B01BF2766W,"This BluRay does NOT have a 4k version of the film, only 1080p. Of course, there are no 4k blu ray players, and most likely never will be, but don't think you're buying a 4k video with this in any case. You're not. The movie is phenomenal, 5 stars. I give one star because it indicates it is something it is not.",1486771200,5,312,4.048387096774194
