8612558,4,B00F63L7VM,"The blurays arrived surprisingly quickly from Poland, in good condition, in packaging that looks just like the picture.  I was not observant enough to notice that this product only includes FOUR EPISODES of Fight Quest.  I thought it was the entire first season of 13 episodes.  It does not.  This is stated on the product page, but you kind of have to look for it to figure that out.

The episodes included are great quality HD video.  However, the ""cut"" of these episodes is different than the US version.  They are a little bit shorter (a minute or two per episode), and the voice over during commentary is of some unknown person who seems to be paraphrasing what was original said in the voiceovers.  The voice overs were originally done by the cast:  Doug and Jimmy.  But these have someone else sort of ""interpreting"" what Doug and Jimmy said and saying it a different way.  This makes sense for a foreign (Polish) release I suppose.  I would like to have had the original commentary, but it's not that big of a deal.

I would also like to have ALL THE REST of the episodes.  I would buy them if they were available.  But I can't find anything other than these 4 episodes for sale in HD.

Overall, this is a good set of discs.  It's just limited in the ways I stated above.",1499212800,,1279,4.420600858369099
