4132802,1,B003K2G0TA,"The set claims to be the complete series seasons 1 thru 5. This is misleading and not accurate. The episode Black Out, which was filmed in the fourth season and held over the fifth season is not included. This was Johnny Depp's last episode. Complete series means all the episodes. Buyer beware that if you want the episode Blackout you have to purchase the fifth season.",1288396800,67,371,4.636363636363637

And even when I love the series I realize why the series going down.  Season 5, its certainly not good at all, because the gang split off; but no matter what I'm very please for this series and if you was part of that time and you want to remember and, of course, review those nice episodes, this product going to be good for you, especially, season 1- season 4...",1285027200,,494,4.030612244897959

4132806,4,B003K2G0TA,I recently picked this up from Best BUY for $25.99. Can't argue for that price so I am very pleased with my purchase!,1279497600,2,117,4.130434782608695
4132807,3,B003K2G0TA,"I recently had the opportunity to review the Mill Creek re-issue of the Complete 21 Jump Street on DVD and I have to say that I'm both a little excited about it and a little bit bummed out.  First off, I have to make it clear that Mill Creek provided a review copy of the DVD, but I'm also a fan of the show already owning a few of the seasons that were previously released by Anchor Bay on DVD.

First, the DVD set Pros...
-The set is decently affordable at about sixty to seventy bucks (especially compared to the season by season box set cost.)

-The quality of the transfer is pretty close to the original Anchor Bay DVDs.  The original source material was rough to begin with though, and there's only so much you can do to pretty it up.  It's not the nest looking show on film.

As far as the cons go...
-The packaging is medium to subpar.  Mill Creek is the king of budget DVD releases, and over the past year or so they've changed the style with which they box their DVD sets.  Though the sets are packaged in clamshell-style cases, the DVDs themselves aren't housed on individual pegs or spindles.  Instead they're individually wrapped in plain black paper sleeves which stack together and sort of snap into a frame on one side of the case.  That means that when you want to pull out DVD #17, you have to pull them all out and sift through the sleeves, which can be a pain.  With a smaller set it's not that big of a deal, but with these complete series sets it really gets to be a pain.

-There are no liner notes and no DVD booklet.  You want to know which episode guest star's Brad Pitt?  Go to IMDB and find it that way.  Again, with a smaller or season set this wouldn't be that big of a deal, but with a complete series set it's really a pain.

-Also, and this was a problem with the original DVD releases as well, most if not all of the original music has been removed from the show.  It's a sad fact of TV on DVD production that music rights are just too expensive and were never negotiated since there was no market at the time.  It's nothing Mill Creek did wrong per-se, but it's also something they did not remedy from the Anchor Bay DVDs...

As far as the show itself goes, this is an example of Stephen J. Cannell at his most playful.  Starring Peter and Michael Deluise, Holly Robinson (Peete), Dustin Nguyen, Steven Williams (the X-Files), Richard Grieco, and of course a young Johnny Depp in his break-out role as Officer Tom Hanson, 21 Jump Street was like the older brother of Saturday Morning cartoons in the 80s.  Usually centered on some hot-button topic of the day, the series was a fun spin on detective shows that gave the actors a lot of range to play all sorts of undercover roles.

Though the episodes do stray more toward a lighter tone, they're usually fun and always entertaining.  The series is a snapshot of what the Fox Network was like during it's inception as well, and helped to define a slightly hipper alternative to the normal programming on the main three networks.  It works best as a time capsule of 80s television and features a plethora of guest stars like Brad Pitt, Pauley Shore, Mario Van Peebles, Kurtwood Smith, Jason Priestley, Mindy Cohn, Bridget Fonda, Sherilynn Fenn, Josh Brolin, Christina Applegate, Vince Vaughn, John Waters, Shannon Doherty, and Thomas Haden Church.

All in all, for the price, the set is probably worth picking up if you're a fan and don't already own the series, though I would wait for a sale.",1278892800,101,3478,4.413793103448276
4132808,5,B003K2G0TA,Have really enjoyed rewatching the series. Recieved the DVD's in excellent shape and in a timely fashion.,1278460800,,105,5.235294117647059
4132829,4,B003K2G0TA,"I'm happy the entire series is all one set, but the box design is very weird. All the discs are each in separate paper sleeves and stacked all in one pile in the middle of the extra thick case. There are no spaces or pages for holding individual discs like most DVD sets have. Just one big pile of discs in a large case. I included a picture to show what it looks like. So far the discs are working fine. Since it's an old series it is in full screen, but that doesn't bother me because that's how it was originally. I'm happy to have this set.",1492214400,2,544,4.046296296296297
4132830,5,B003K2G0TA,"Fantastic Box Series. If you like undercover cops and shows that touch on issues still prevalent to this day, this is definitely a must have.

I do not care for the packaging of this series. Each disc is in a envelope, which is tedious at times.

4132858,1,B003K2G0TA,"This set is a huge disappointment! A great series deserves better treatment than this. For one thing, the way the set is put together is terrible! You get a hundred discs full of episodes with NO episode guide whatsoever. Every other set I've gotten based off a TV show had an episode guide to at least tell you what episodes are on which disc! It's outrageous that these episodes were just dumped onto discs by seasons yet you have to play every single disc to find out which episode is on which disc! Like people are expected to know what episodes belong to which season? I had to get online and waste time looking up the episodes so I can remember, what each episode consisted of. All you get with this set is the titles of the episode once you play the discs. And each disc has like 7 or 8 episodes. Wow.

Second, the quality is atrocious. Jumpstreet was in the 80's and 90's yet you swear it was made in the 50's with the horrid quality of this  set. It looks like someone dubbed these straight from old VHS tapes recorded from a snowy TV! I could've dubbed my own DVDs from old VHS tapes of the show myself.

Jumpstreet fans and this show deserve a lot more! If you can't produce sets of good quality then don't produce them at all! I wasted my money because the full episodes on Youtube are of better quality than this mess!",1480118400,4,1331,4.294820717131474

4132866,5,B003K2G0TA,This is a great series about young adult who look like high school kids so they go into high schools to help protect the kids in the schools and stop crimes from happening.  The  characters develop throughout the series and work great in a team or alone.  Each episode deals with real life issues and show even cops can make a difference in the life of people.  This is a special group that work in a chapel and make an impact in the lives of young kids and young adults.  The series also shows how society looks at cops and that people are offended when they find out that cops are sent into the schools to stop crimes stating that it is entrapment and that the program does not  harm than good.  The series has many guest stars that  go on to become popular after their appearance on this show.  This is a great way to learn about law and how cops work.,1470873600,2,855,4.196319018404908

4132873,5,B003K2G0TA,"Apparently the missing episode issue has been resolved because the set I just received does have the episode Blackout along with every other episode.

The transfer is typical Mill Creek quality, somewhat low res and there are no subtitles, but I actually like the packaging design of the individual slip envelopes. It's not uncommon to get DVDs in the mail that have bounced around inside the case the whole way because they've come loose from the center holder. These are sturdy sets that don't have much in them to possibly break.

Anyway, this show is a great flashback from my childhood and I am so thrilled it is available for such an affordable price. Highly recommended.",1465084800,3,677,4.827586206896552

4132968,4,B003K2G0TA,"After seeing the 2012 movie adaptation with Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, I wanted to go back and watch the series it was based on. During the middle of season 2, I lost interest and set it aside until the 2014 sequel, 22 Jump Street came out, so I decided to pick up where I left off. I'd say the first 3 seasons are the best. Season 5 is almost unwatchable. It really goes downhill after Johnny Depp leaves. (I understand Depp hated being on the show and tried like crazy to get kicked off. It was cool that he, Peter DeLuise, and Holly Robinson returned to the movie for cameos. In my eyes, the movie is a sequel to this series)

25 years before Schmidt and Jenko entered Jump Street, there was Tom Hanson, Doug Penhall, Judy Hoffs, H.T. Ioki, and Booker. For the majority of the series, they go undercover in high school, posing as students and bust drug dealers, rapists and murderers. Other times, they go undercover in different places trying to infiltrate a gang or just trying to protect themselves from vengeful mobsters.

4132987,4,B003K2G0TA,"I enjoyed the original series. It is kind of fun to ""flash back"" and watch this again. I was surprised to see so many familiar faces  in the days before they became famous stars. This show featured many young actors and actresses who went on to become stars that we recognize today. I had also forgotten how many of these episodes addressed pretty intense issues (many of which, unfortunately, we continue to wrestle with today). While the fads and fashions are definitely from the 90s, the issues addressed (such as peer pressure, difficult communication between teens and parents, drug abuse, gangs, testing of boundaries, etc.) are still with us today.

This series is about young police officers whose youthful appearance makes them ideal to work undercover in high school (and later episodes, in college) to solve crimes that involve or threaten teenagers and/or young adults. Often the relationships between the officers, or the officers and their boss, parallel the issues that are part of their undercover work for that episode. Not all episodes are intense. These shows include a nice mix of comic relief with serious issues and lessons learned. Watching the blossoming of the talented young actors (Johnny Depp, Peter DeLouise, Dustine Nguyen and Holly Robinson) is an added bonus!",1381968000,,1291,5.113744075829384
4132988,5,B003K2G0TA,"THIS is the 21 Jump Street that you want to have, NOT the atrocity in which that overated idiot Jonah Hill starred in.

Pure star power alone sells this series. Action packed, aimed at a younger, teenage or ""twentiesh"" audience. Basically, it is about cops who look younger in age so they ""blend in"" with high school teens to solve all sorts of crimes. DO NOT get the bastardized version that was the recent Jonah Hill abomination and simply a slap to the face of true 21 Jump Street fans. Get the one depicted in this review. It is NOT a comedy like the recent movie although sometimes a wisecrack or insult is said that might make you laugh but that is not what the show is really about. It is about cop style action with teen style music and culture. Highest possible recommendation!",1381968000,3,1125,4.864583333333333

I adored these two characters and they were both such an addition to the cast as well as Peter DeLuise -- where did he go. Then his brother Joey (real name?) came in for a few shows and he was gone in no time. I thought perhaps at the end of season Five they would bring back Johhny and Peter and his brother for a farewell and explain how they'd been on a big case or something BUT nada-nothing-no explanation at all.  This really made me angry. The show was carried by Holly Robinson (who looks exactly the same now as then) and Steven Williams (where did he go for I haven't seen him and can't find him in anything)....and he was HOT!!!! Then a new guy Michael Benitti (sp?) came on and he was good but it just wasn't the same. I think Johnny was probably offered a bunch of roles in movies - wierd movies because he played a lot of characters on Jump but Peter (he was so adorable) I've not seen again (you remember Dom Delouise (sp?) all you old folks (like me) well Peter and his brother are his sons - even Dom had a cameo. So where oh where did the above guys go????? Other than that I loved the show from beginning to end and yet there wasn't really an ending and that in itself was a disappointment.

I thought I sent it to my Wishlist, but instead I bought it with my 1-Click Purchase function. I didn't really care because it was so cheap, and I thought, ""Johnny Depp is in it. How bad could it be?"" I got it a few days later and started watching it with my fiance, and we both really enjoy it. We watch it on and off but we're almost done with the 4th season now, and it's very rare we don't like an episode. It really was a great series.

Non-sense talk from here on out:

I only have one complaint. Stop picking on Penhall. He is one of the most endearing characters I've ever seen(I own over 2500 movies, and 200 different complete TV shows) and they always give him the short end of the stick. Sometimes they even ignore continuity to give him an extra kick.

For Example(SPOILERS AHEAD):

The did an episode about suicide, and it comes out that Doug's mother committed suicide. That's terrible enough, but then later on in the series(less than 12 episodes), it comes out that his mother and father basically didn't care about him and that his father died when he was young too, and that he was raised from the age of 12 by his uncle.  It's just mean. I could literally go on forever, but it really is said. Peter DeLuise did a great job with the character, and easily stole the show for me. I'm hoping something good happens for him before the end of the series.",1358812800,9,1477,4.317689530685921

Having watched all the episodes again, Jump Street is still fairly entertaining. Certain story-lines seemed to have been influenced by some outside agendas; but all in all it's still the same show I enjoyed as a kid.",1354752000,,412,4.5675675675675675

Not really much to review, either you are a fan of the show and know what it is or you do not...lol...I did find that the later seasons, that they just seemed to really lose whatever it is they were after and found success with. Many of the characters that you really get to like just simply disappear from showing up with no explanation.

As far as the container that is used to hold the DVDs...The DVDs are in paper sleeves and are all stacked on one another on a cheap plastic holder..Definitely not all that great. This is pretty much just for those that are either fans of the show or of Johnny Depp.. I would recommend it solely on those grounds alone.",1354320000,,676,4.24031007751938

It cost under $40.00 at the time, but I believe it can be purchased for less now, which is a great price for the 103 episodes. The bad news is that there is one episode missing, which happens to be the last episode with Officer Tom Hanson (Johnny Depp). I heard there was a music rights issue with the episode.

While there is a shortage of special features every episode is collected in the order it was originally aired featuring many famous faces you're sure to recognize as modern day stars.

The sellers have great customer services skills and are willing to work out any issues if they arise.  The only thing I do not like is that the disc come in separate sleeves and are all in one big box.  Anyway you are sure to get multiple hours of action. I still have several discs to go.,1333584000,,458,4.010989010989011
4133053,3,B003K2G0TA,"I really enjoyed this show in its original run on Fox 2 decades ago. I also noticed the lower video quality -- probably a result of cramming too many episodes on each disc. Other shows use 3 or 4 episodes per disc, but this set has twice that number on each disc. It looks better when viewed through standard video hookups versus HDMI.

Additional - Many of these episodes are just not the same without the music used when they originally aired: The Rolling Stones, Depeche Mode, REM, Blind Faith. The distributing company did not get the music rights (for whatever reason), so music tracks have been substituted with cheesy studio band music in a bad 80's style. It really changes the tone of some episodes. The music was so much better when the showed originally aired on Fox.",1332979200,5,778,4.597122302158273

But the ""suits"" made their first big mistake by replacing Frederick Forrest after 6 eposodes.  The ridiculous explanation was that audience input indicated a need for a traditional top cop.  Audience input?  An audience of primarily teenagers who don't like or respect authority and would not mind a laid-back former hippie police captain?  Add a character who took so much time away from the young actors?  Just stupid!  Fox just couldn't let the show be that original!  No wonder Depp, Nguyen and P. DeLuise were happy to get off the show.  The upcoming movie version is not something for which I am holding my breath.  Maybe it will be a pleasant surprise?",1325635200,,806,4.685714285714286

(kinda corny but good if younger people are watching).
Mostly I'd rate it PG-13, lots of sex and drugs throughout the episodes, not kid friendly.

His mother was 13 when the show first came on the air & I was about the same age as the actors, so it is a real blast for him.  I saw a few of the episodes and it was fun to watch.  They don't have cable at their house so they watch a lot of DVDs & he has tons to watch with this big set.  I thought that kids today have such fantastic special effects and high quality cartoons & shows that they wouldn't be interested in old stuff, but most of the kids I know enjoy Boomerang with cartoons way back to the 60s.

The thought and effort put into filling the shows music is kinda weak.
you'll be watching car chase scenes set to ballads.  Some music has lyrics

Its distracting, and you can't help but wonder how the original was.

4133066,5,B003K2G0TA,"I have never been one to care for or watch cop shows. Any kind of procedural based on any branch of the law. I just can't watch them. Zero interest. ""21 Jump Street"" was a show I never really watched or paid attention to when it was originally on(1987-1991). I saw bits and pieces, but it didn't grab me. It was just another cop show. Oh, how wrong I was! This show, as I later re-discovered in life, is not just another cop show. To me, it is THE cop show. A year ago, I stumbled upon the first season on sale and bought it. It was one of the best surprises I could of gotten. I immediately had to get all five seasons, which are nicely collected here in one nice package. But first, the lowdown....

""21 Jump Street"", which debuted on the just launched FOX Network in 1987, centers around a special unit of the police force, named Jump Street. This special unit consists of fresh faced officers, as young in age as possible, who go undercover as students in high schools/colleges to bust crime. Crimes that include drug rings, date rape, bullying, drunk driving, murder, etc. Several other tough topics like - AIDS, religion, race, teen pregnancy, alcohol, homosexuality don't go unnoticed either. The four officers we follow are Tom Hansen(Johnny Depp), Doug Penhall(Peter DeLuise), Judy Hoffs(Holly Robinson), and H.T. Ioki(Dustin Nguyen). The unit is first seen by Captain Janks(Fredric Forrest), and he is then replaced halfway thru season 1 by the cool and smooth Capt. Adam Fuller(Steven Williams).

Like I said in the title, 'Jump Street' is a show for people who don't like the genre and never thought they would. The show was quite hip, cool, edgy, and startling for it's time, and you know what? It still is. 24 years after it's debut and 20 years since it's end. It was the 80s, so it already has that cool vibe that immediately tells you this isn't your dad's cop show. The characters are instantly likeable, watchable, and fleshed out. Depp was the breakout star, but credits must go to everyone here, especially DeLuise. These are people you feel like you know, and can maybe see yourself or your friends in some of the high schoolers they meet along the way. We have 5 seasons here and 103 episodes. That's a lot, so I am not going to go over much in that way. Sure, sometimes it seems like it might be kind of preachy, but so what? There's nothing wrong with educating and trying to get out a message. The show, in my opinion, was really ahead of it's time. There have been episodes where I was genuinely startled. The writers never seemed to be too afraid to tackle strong subjects head on and unflinchingly. Also, part of the fun is seeing a who's who parade of people come through the show. People like Brad Pitt, Christina Applegate, Jason Alexander, Bridget Fonda, Josh Brolin, Jason Priestley, Vince Vaughn, Pauly Shore, Shannen Doherty, Thomas Haden Church, Blair Underwood, and more. Richard Grieco joined the show in season 3 as Dennis Booker, and was spun off into his own show, ""Booker"", after season 3. Johnny Depp left after season 4, along with Nguyen. DeLuise bailed out halfway thru the 5th and final season. At the end, Robinson and Williams were the only ones left. This is the first time I am really watching the show, so I can't really say anything about the music issue. What was here, what isn't here on the DVDs, and so on. I am only reviewing the show for the show, and not knocking points for music issues or lack of extras.

Brought to us by the legendary Stephen J. Cannell, ""21 Jump Street"" is a blast from the get go. It's an interesting and fun premise, and the makers certainly make the most of it. Many episodes here are thought provoking, serious, funny, touching, shocking, and everything else in between. Some episodes are tough to watch because they are so shockingly in your face. I don't think I've seen much like it before or since. There is a lot to love here. Great characters, some stellar writing and acting, a kick butt theme song, and a sense of not wanting to be a typical, by the numbers procedural. It may be a bit dated here and there, but that's part of the charm. If only things were still as great as they were then, and they still made shows like 21 Jump Street.",1307404800,4,4233,4.54521625163827

**A little warning about the Mill Creek Comple Set...Some of the sets by Mill Creek are missing the episode Business as Usual aka the ""Black Out"" episode...
It's supposed to be the last episode of Season 4 disc 4.  It's somewhat significant because it's Johnny Depp's last appearance on the show.
On the bright side they did add the fist episode of the series Booker which shows his transition from Jump Street to his new career.
It's because of the Booker first episode they screwed up and didn't put the ""Black Out"" episode.
There were 26 episodes in the fourth season and Booker's first episode was not part of the 26 episodes.
Anyway, they did eventually caught and corrected their mistake and added the Black Out episode.
So just be wary that the set you buy by Mill Creek might not have the Black Out episode.
There is no way to tell if the set has the missing episode or not until you actually receive the set and check the DVD.",1521331200,,1002,4.475409836065574
