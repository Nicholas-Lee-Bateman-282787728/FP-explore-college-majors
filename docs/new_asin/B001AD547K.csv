It begins in a small town; Church to-day is the sign posted on the saloon. Services begin for the men. The minister says sheep men will arrive. His sermon is against hate and bitterness. The government will allow sheep men and homesteaders into the Laramie Basin. Thompson objects to this, the Sheriff explains the law. Ken and his brother Wally go to the restaurant where theres a new waitress. Wally flips a coin. A crowd gathers outside, a sheepherder will drive his sheep through town. Ken and Wally will try to change their route. They stop a rider, he is a she! The sheep owner is offered help in herding.

Wally buys womens clothes for Judy at the store. Ken arrives to ask for flannel underwear, then switches a note on a package! Thompson orders men to keep the sheep herds away from his lands. His sons go to see their angry father. Butch Martin plans something bad for the herd of sheep. Miss Judy rides into town (without a hat). Wally learns of the trick. A gang rides out and drives the sheep away. The owner shoots at them but is shot! His wagon is pushed down a hill. Goldie dances with Wally. Judy hears the bad news about her father. Mr. Thompson offered his home to Judy. She goes riding with Ken, but Wally replaces him.

The Sheriff tells about Butch, he has a big roll and brags about getting rid of the sheepherder Winters. Ken takes him to see his father; Judy overhears Butchs talk and leaves. Later Ken meets Judy and asks her to return. Ken takes the blame and tells Judy he is leaving the area. Butch talks to turn Wally against Ken. Wally shoots Ken then leaves to attack the sheepmen. When Wally hesitates, Butch shoots him! Butch and his gang attack the sheepmens camp. There is shooting. Ken and his men stop them; Ken captures Butch and turns him over to the Sheriff. Judy talks to Wally. Ken will have a happy future.

There are lessons in this story about proper behavior. Did you note them? Ken has the skills to resolve conflicts peacefully, but others do not. Note how Wallys drinking affected his judgment. The problem with sheep is they crop the grass down to the ground so cattle cannot feed afterwards. It is less expensive to raise sheep than cattle. Sheep produce wool, a renewable resource. Cattle only make one harvest of hides. Many prefer beef to mutton.",1509494400,,2335,4.5260663507109005

Between Men is a strongly composed ""B"" directed by Robert North Bradbury (Courageous Avenger and several of John Wayne's Lone Star Westerns).  Bradbury was also the father of B-Western star Bob Steele, and his expertise in the genre is delightfully natural.  Between Men has a strong cast in Johnny Mack Brown as the stalwart hero, and this may well be his best role.  Beth Marion excels as the love interest, as does William Farnum in his scene-stealing role as Brown's tormented father and Earl Dwire as the standard slimy villain.

Between Men has a richly melodramatic plot.  Farnum (great wide- eyed acting) believes he has killed his young son (Brown) and flees west.  Actually, the boy was only injured and is adopted by Lloyd Ingram.  Twenty years pass and the visuals shift from the upper-scale Virginia countryside to the stark New Mexico desert as Johnny embarks on a journey to find his adopted father's long lost granddaughter (Marion).  Farnum has assumed a new name and is now Marion's guardian after his hired hand (Dwire) rustles her cattle, kills her father, and attempts to raper her.  Marion is saved by a ""drifter"" whom Farnum hires for protection, not realizing that Brown is his son, whom he believes to be dead.

Soon however, Farnum believes Brown is putting the make on Beth.  Drifter Brown is not worthy of her.  The film does not state, but seems to imply, that Farnum himself lusts after her.  After Johnny fails to heed Farnum's warning to stay away from Marion, a brawl between father and son breaks out, during which our dimpled hero obligingly loses most of his shirt.  Farnum sees an identifying scar on Brown's chest and belatedly realizes this is his son.  Oddly, the film ends with Farnum sacrificing his life for the young lovers without ever revealing to Johnny that he is his father.  Needless to say, the dastardly bad guys are killed off, with Johnny and Beth walking arm in arm into the New Mexico sunset.  There is as much plot as action in this oater, which is a rarity in the genre of the thirties.  This, along with assured direction, photography by Bert Longenecker and aptly over-the-top acting make Between Men one of the better B Westerns from the period.
