Granted Mr. Ehlinger did this as a one-man show and I give him a lot of credit. I liked the imagery and the colorful world he created and he captured the story well. I wish the women's ""peace cries"" weren't as annoying as the book portrayed them and there weren't as much bloodshed and the story stalled at times, but if he had a larger budget he'd have accomplished much more.

2769318,3,B000NJ60FM,"This version of the tale tries the most to update the film to a modern audience, and that is its chief failing. The original tale was called a Romance, and this updating removes that very concept from the story. While it follows much of the novella's narrative- in describing the way Flatland works (although the original's King is replaced by a President- who oddly still wears a crown), it departs severely from the original at its most crucial moment, once A Square is visited by A Sphere from Spaceland. In this version, instead of a mystical guide, along the line of the Three Ghosts Of Christmas from Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, A Sphere is CEO of Messiah, Inc. Ok....if the mere mention of that plot point has you rolling your eyes, you are not alone. And the attempts at satire only go downhill from there.
  Instead of Sphere's lifting up of Square into Spaceland being a religious experience, in this film it merely serves as a `wow' moment used to lead into some cheap gags, jokes, and a display of Ehlinger's animative chops. The story dissolves. Then there is some cheap and rather predictable satire of consumerism and the current Iraq War, which will severely date the film in coming years, as well as a not so funny portrayal of a Spaceland Senator Cube who sounds very much like Ted Kennedy. In the novella, the satire, while based in Victoriana, dealt more specifically with human foibles grafted onto the polygons of Flatland. Here, the polygons of Flatland and the solids of Spaceland are almost total caricatures- such as the gay sounding Flatland Senator who leads the dissenting Chromatist movement, and is assassinated by President Circle's henchmen.
  The film is best when sticking to the book's original points.... The DVD comes with an autographed thank you from Ehlinger, but the disk itself has only the film and a brief trailer. Even though the film is low budget, couldn't Ehlinger have included a commentary by himself and others? It would have at least made the DVD, if not the film, worth a bit more, on a level of interest. In this day and age, not doing so is a bit of a ripoff- small budget or not. On a real world note, the slim case DVD package the DVD comes in also has a bad holder for the disk. The disk is far too small and the disk cannot stay in its holder. While a worthwhile effort, Flatland: The Film takes on too much, misses where the book succeeds, and its ending is just bad. But, Ehlinger does show a flair and unique style. If he continues in animation, here's hoping his next film is about the same quantum leap up from this one that Spaceland is from Flatland. If it is, then we'll have a film truly worth all the praise this one has gotten.",1221091200,9,2706,4.5731958762886595
2769319,5,B000NJ60FM,"This movie is an excellent homage to Edwin Abbott Abbott's classic masterpiece ""Flatland.""

When the mathematician Abbott wrote his book Flatland on the eve of the 20th century, he used the mathematical notion of two dimensionality to decry all forms of two dimensional thinking. In that sense, movies or other works building off of Flatland can pursue both these themes or merely one of them at the expense of the other.

While this movie does basic justice to Abbott's underlying mathematics I think it's probably most fair to say that its greater emphasis is on its attack against two dimensional thinking itself.

Please make no mistake: I am a huge fan of Edwin Abbott Abbott, Flatlands and all the books and treatments that have been offered in its tradition. Therefore, I've given positive reviews to Ian Stewart's Flatterland, Dewdney's Plainiverse, Sphereland and even the original book on the Fourth Dimension by Charles Hinton even though some or all of these works have been criticized by other reviewers. Therefore, while I personally have great reason to believe that as both a mathematical concept and metaphor warnings against two dimensional thinking are important others may disagree.

But if they wish to do so I guess they can write a review just like I did.",1219276800,5,1278,5.014150943396227
2769320,4,B000NJ60FM,"I have shown the film to several friends, family members and 2 classes of students.  My wife and I really enjoyed it, although we thought the ending (last several minutes) was just weird and that's what dropped it from 5 stars.

Amazingly several friends and family members were fairly interested in it - the social commentary of Abbot's piece came in fairly well early on.  Many to most of the student's enjoyed it - a few, like anywhere, decided to sleep.  One student was so intrigued she did a report on Edwin Abbot after seeing the film.

It's not Hollywood at it's best but overall the film is quite entertaining and unless you're one of those whom hates it for some reason you will definitely want to watch it twice to get some interesting nuances.  The graphics is pretty good, just a weird ending where they got too carried away with the graphics and did some graphics stuff just because they could.",1215820800,2,908,4.574074074074074
2769321,4,B000NJ60FM,"This review covers both versions of ""Flatland"" released in 2007, one by Ladd Ehlinger, Jr. with a mostly unknown voice cast, and the other by Jeffrey Travis with some Hollywood big names providing the voices.

The source material for both is the 1884 novella by Edwin A. Abbott, but the approaches of the two films differ radically. The book is a staple of science fiction, and one of the few to address mathematical issues at its core. Being a product of its time, the book is technically naive, and politically incorrect based on current sensibilities.

The Travis film is visually slicker, but significantly shorter, and tackles philosophical issues relative to the passage of time from initial publication. As such, it tampers with the plot to mixed effect. Unlike some others, I have no problem with some of the revisions to the underlying plot since they do help bring some of the book's major issues into somewhat sharper focus. On the other hand, they also add a ""feel good"" and politically correct sensibility that seems out of place.

The Ehlinger film is much truer to its source material, which is both a strength and a weakness. Given a current perspective, its 19th century depiction of the political and social subjugation of women is a distraction that the Travis film avoids. It's also a longer film and could have been more effective with some of the same plot and editing license employed in the Travis film. Where it does tamper with the plot, some of the decisions are questionable as other reviewers have pointed out.

So which is better? In my opinion, the short answer is the Ehlinger film. Despite its length, political incorrectness, and technical inferiority (the animation of the Travis film is much more sophisticated), it resonates at a technical level to a degree that the Travis film can't match. As a scientist, this means a lot to me. On the other hand, the Travis film resonates on an emotional level that the Ehlinger film can't match. So the answer may be whether you're looking for technical insight or emotional satisfaction.

Most jarring in the Travis film is that, unlike the Ehlinger film, the animators never quite caught on to the implications of a two-dimensional universe. It is filled with objects which are instantly recognizable to us, yet would be clearly impossible or meaningless in the film's reality (e.g. the protagonist's daughter has toys which only make sense to someone with a 3-D perspective, and how does he open his briefcase?). The cover art is an obvious first impression example. The Travis film's characters look  more human, but ask yourself how their eyes work. One detail of the book is that looking at a Flatlander from above, all of his internal organs are clearly visible, as they should be. Travis' animators hint at this, but don't meet it head-on. The Ehlinger film's animators may not have had the resources to make as slick a film as Travis', but they obviously gave a great deal of thought to what they were doing (or maybe not, since the necessary designs were all in the book). In short, Travis had the budget, but Ehlinger had the passion for the project - albeit perhaps a bit too much respect for the source to create a truly superior adaptation.

The differences reflect different target audiences, though. The Travis film is an educational short film which was obviously meant to be viewed by classrooms of middle school and high school students. As such, it had to be socially inoffensive while conveying concepts of geometry that would never occur to non-mathematicians. That it includes recognizable names voicing the characters will help it grab a bit more attention - an educational short film for the ""X-Files"" generation. The Ehlinger film would mostly appeal to people with a college level interest in mathematics, or others who are already familiar with the book.

Neither film is perfect, but I'm giving the Ehlinger film a rating of 4 and the Travis film a rating of 3. Depending on your sensibilities, your conclusion may be exactly opposite of mine, so I hope this review includes enough information to guide you to an informed selection.

Or, like me, you could simply buy both... ;-)",1207612800,12,4184,4.8734177215189876
2769322,2,B000NJ60FM,"I'm a mathematician by education, and I thoroughly enjoyed E. A. Abbott's book when I read it a couple of decades ago. Flatland the film stays close to the mathematical ideas of the book, though the plot wanders astray. That variance doesn't interfere with enjoyment of the film.

What does interfere is the length of the film. It's way too long, drawn out, and frankly boring. I wanted to see how this classic of geometry played out. But for that avocational interest, I would have ejected this disk way before the end. This film wants editing, and the editor should cut it down to 1/3 of its present length. Part of the charm of the book was its small size, but the film has lost that virtue.

A much smaller sin is the stylized depiction of violence: the blood running from the figures, the repeated attacks on the opposition senator,  the massacre by machine gun from the hovering aircraft, the nuclear explosion. Even if the animators did cut their professional teeth on shooter video games, these elements are irrelevant to the central mathematical message of the story, in their fulsomeness they have little relevance to the plot, they weren't present in the book, they are patently offensive, and they make the film questionable for viewing by children. This alone would cost the film a star.

The silent panels of text contain, in some cases, important messages for the story. In the remake, audible narration should overlay these panels. If I wanted to read, I would buy the book.

The beauty and technical quality of the animation and sound is superb, and the makers chose an excellent soundtrack.

2769323,5,B000NJ60FM,"This is, undoubtedly, one of the most innovative and bizarre films I've seen lately, and I can tell you I see a few every week!

The graphics are just wonderful - probably not so high-tech as you can see in some stupidly expensive Hollywood productions, but who needs those when the beauty is in what those flat characters say and show us! Well, maybe those who don't have anything to say...

The use of the different dimensions and the explanations that the characters use to make us understand are of the highest level -- lucid and intelligent, it's a really thought-provoking film, one of those few left out there!

2769324,5,B000NJ60FM,"The challenge of creating imagery from such a novel that challenges our understanding of the world itself, a world broken down to basics and presented as an allegory at the same time, is simply monstrous. When that is done from an independent filmmaker and produces this sort of result one simply talks about poetry.

I am one of these people whose understanding of the universe and social interactions is limited enough to simply laugh their way out of most of it. And this film offered me plenty of reasoning for things that were always mysteries or jokes or pages of history I could not read. Abbott's novel was just the beginning, and as a text many people would say that they have expected it to be somewhat different or would indeed have made it differently themselves were they the filmmakers. True, but this does not make it a bad film.

I think that every kid in this world should watch it. Just for the sake of understanding some of the principles of math or the social sphere in a visual context.",1205971200,2,1007,4.558011049723757

2769326,5,B000NJ60FM,"This is the most unique, brilliant, audacious, and ""concept"" inspired movie that I've ever seen which most reminds me of the effect Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" had on me over 30 years ago (and fortunately I had read Clarke's novel before seeing the movie, which in this case, I haven't yet <g>, but have started it). It was a ""mind-boggling"" experience reminiscent of movies like ""Yellow Submarine,"" ""Fantastic Planet,"" and ""Heavy Metal""--all of which I have seen and still enjoy! Animation wise, the only thing recently comparable to its ""irreverence"" (and satire) is ""Tripping the Rift"" Everything about its animation, screenplay, production values, music and voices (and casting) are first rate. I look forward to anything the producer, director, screenplay writer, and musical director do again (hopefully together)! I will recommend it to EVERYONE I know!

P.S. I would suggest that both the DVD label and jacket have a standard COPYRIGHT statement on them! A ""Behind the Scenes"" or ""Making Of"" special feature would have been nice <g>, as well as perhaps a Director",1200441600,3,1085,5.1647727272727275
2769327,1,B000NJ60FM,"I purchased both this DVD and Flatland the Movie with Martin Sheen and other well known actors doing the vocals.  The other movie (the one with Martin Sheen) is far superior.

This film stretches out the plot to the point where my wife fell asleep and I had to watch it over 2 days.  The female voices are annoyingly screeching  and the female characters are portrayed in an offensive misogynistic manner.

I know that filmmakers take liberties with the plot of books turned into films but this one does so in nonsensical ways that really distort the fantastic meaning of Edwin Abbot's classic novel, which is really sad because the graphics in this production are quite good and the book Flatland is a perfect idea for a movie.

I highly recommend that you buy the other movie Flatland (the one with Martin Sheen).

2769330,5,B000NJ60FM,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  I saw the first half of it in a class for school and it prompted me to go out and buy and read the book.  I think they did a really good job of making the storyline up to date even though the book is very old.  A lot of people have been saying that the graphics aren't great, but they aren't meant to be.  Flatland is supposed to be a very simplistic world.  The graphics get a lot better when the film goes into 3D.  Another reviewer wrote that while in 3D the camera never stops moving.  While this is a bit dizzying, notice that the characters are almost always spinning around on their axes in Flatland 2D.  This keeps the movie the same throughout and I think the filmmakers did a great job of bringing this to the third dimension.  I agree with other people though, you really need to read the book either before or after seeing this movie or it doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  Overall, I give it 5 stars--it's probably the most original movie I've seen in a very long time.",1195430400,5,1017,4.195876288659794

2769333,4,B000NJ60FM,"Just about all of the math nerds out there, not just the card-carrying mathematicians, have happy childhood memories of Edwin A. Abbott's ""Flatland."" As a result, this movie had an audience waiting for it the day it came out - and I'm in that audience.

The mathematical content of this movie is interesting and easily accessible to most viewers; Even young kids will get at least parts of it. It presents the idea of a two-dimensional world, whose citizens resemble paper cutouts living their lives on a table-top universe. It's truly 2D - you can't even lay one of the pancake people on top of another, they can only slide by each other in the plane. Although an interesting speculation in itself (any end-to-end digestive tract would split the creature in two - so how could it function biologically?), the two dimensions are just part of an analogy. By showing how two dimensions relate to our third, Abbott invites the reader to imagine how our three would relate to a fourth spatial dimension.

The imagery is entertaining - it has the feel of an amateur work, or maybe that of a pro making computer animations as a weekend hobby. The fact that half the credits share one surname makes it look like a family effort. Still, it's easy to get hold of enough computer power to do decent rendering these days, and the Ehrliners demonstrate the democratization of movie-making. Unfortunately, to make this movie popular and meaningful to a wide, modern audience, much of Abbott's original work suffered. Not just a math-themed story, it was also a critique of Victorian class-consciousness and gender politics. All that has been lost in making this kid-friendly version. The good news is that the pedantic and archaic tones were lost too, making this a bit easier to warm up to.

It's fun any way. And, as I said, it's kid-friendly. There's some war-like activity, but the characters are too geometrically abstract for their demise to feel like real violence. Go ahead. It's cute, harmless fun - and it might just stretch a small mind in new directions.

(PS: I've been corrected. One small viewer, age six or so, got very wrapped up in the characters. When one of the young geometric figures got hurt, it really upset her. You know your little one, so use your judgment.)",1186272000,6,2287,4.779746835443038
2769334,5,B000NJ60FM,"As many other reviewers, I don't normally write reviews but felt compelled to  write one for Flatland. I read the book 15 years ago in a college math class and enjoyed it a lot. When I heard about the film I ordered it (along with a Flatland T-shirt) immediately. I was impressed with the personalized autograph on the DVD and could barely wait to watch it with a group of friends. Having watched it last night, we were all impressed. It was an amazingly well-done film, especially considering it as an independent project. It led to an hour long discussion, one interesting point being that Abbot viewing this film would be almost analogous to A-square being taken to spaceland. I would love to see Abbot's reaction. This was an excellent post-modern interpretation of a modern classic. Don't miss it.",1186012800,9,802,4.76978417266187
2769335,5,B000NJ60FM,"I just watched this movie and felt compelled to write a review. I really enjoyed it. It seems to help almost anyone step outside their current state of thinking. I normally do not like Animated films nor seek them out to watch but this one was different. It is especially successful in its depiction of a 2D world, making the appearance of the 3D world almost magical. The character voices were very well done, and there was a lot of action for a well thought out ""brainy"" movie. While you might see a little of the ""what the heck is this"" response at first from friends and older teens that will faded to some very intent staring at the screen and thought provoking discussion afterwards. I highly recommend sharing this movie with friends and older children (my daughter, 17 enjoyed it).

In a world where everything seems so cookie cutter it was great to step out of that box and into this world for a bit. I whole heartedly thank the filmaker and his family and friends that did this entirely on their own for the incredible amount of time they gave to this project to spur my imagination, and which led to a discussion about 2d and 3d worlds with my daughter!

The graphics are not up to today's standards for computer graphics (the cover art is pretty cheesey itself and the movie is generally worse) such as we see in commercial computer-generated movies but also in independent efforts like Animusic I and II.

Worse, though, the story is not well written - there is no subtlety whatsoever.  The deliberate campiness of the written narration is overdone and ends up being irritating in its self-awareness (""wait for it"", ""wait for it"", ...).  The satire of the story is too black and white with no nuance.  The characters are blind dogmatists who cite the law as if it mattered to their daily lives, which was probably not true of the populace even in Abbott's day and is certainly not true today where dogmatists found their beliefs on intricate rationalizations that can make a scary kind of sense.  Some may want to attribute the weakness of the story to the nature of writing satire, which is a difficult genre to satisfy general audiences.  Nevertheless, I found the story simply too sophomoric in its black and white characterizations and unmotivated plot.

The acting of the main character is decent when he expresses confusion, but is weak when he is expressing anger or frustration.  The acting of the other characters is simply 'flat', even the sphere.",1184371200,13,1378,4.879828326180258
2769338,5,B000NJ60FM,"The first surprise from this movie was receiving it in the mail less than three days after I ordered it. The packaging was quite familiar, because it looked very much like what I had done when I sold software I created on CDs. Unless you (the guy selling the CDs/DVDs) do a run of several thousand disks and cases, you'll never get the look of a shrinkwrapped DVD like you buy at WalMart. But, if you pay close attention to all the pieces and assembling them just right, and as Ladd Ehlinger Jr, sign the disk and include a nice signed note, you can make it into something of a keepsake. The Miami Vice DVD will get handed off to the first person who asks for it and quickly forgotten. Flatland the Film isn't walking out of my house without help from a 4D sphere.

The next surprise... I've only watched it once, and expect to watch it many times and catch more of the nuances and details... At the start it seems to flip between animation and full screen text almost epileptically (for lack of a better word), like an old style silent film, except without the silence. If you go in expecting a faithful film portrayal of Abbott's book, the printed narrative looks like it might be the device to provide that, until it hilariously breaks into modern colloquialisms. Those sucked me into this film.

My Dad gave me Abbott's book to read when I was in 4th or 5th grade. I remember reading it with a very literal mathematical focus, which was probably to have lost everything intended by the book! It's kind of like how in high school, I ""read"" To Kill a Mockingbird (actually the first and last 3 pages), then BS'd my way to an A on a ""book report"". 15 years later, a friend from the UK sent me a copy of the book for my birthday, which I actually read, absorbed, and loved. Walking in others' shoes (to use the Mockingbird parlance) is the common thread. I reconnected with Flatland one afternoon when I was in grad school, and appreciated that there was so much more to the book than I'd seen as a 10 or 11 year old.

I can sort of see the same dynamic working with this film and kids. If you turn the sound down, there are lots of interesting things to watch, like the way the Flatlanders face each other to talk, their innards, how death works. I could see a bunch of 6 year olds cutting out little shapes and playing Flatland on a kitchen table, mimicking things they see in this movie. Maybe even picking up A Square and letting him look down on Flatland, with the Flatlanders oblivious to his presence. And yet, the movie is chock full of little nuggets for more sophisticated viewers to discover. I will probably have to watch it 10 times to catch all the funny signs in Spaceland. Some of the quips are very quick, like the explanation that ""circles"" in Flatland are not true circles, but polygons with so many sides they approximate them. Basically, King Circle and his ilk were posers.

In making this film, I think Mr. Ehlinger has done a marvelous job in not only preserving the concept, but also teaching it well and using it as an integral part of his plot.  Absolutely fantastic.",1181001600,12,385,4.4714285714285715
2769341,5,B000NJ60FM,"1. I don't do reviews.

But having seen (and own 2 copies of) FLATLAND, and having interviewed the director for my cable access show: ""Anatomically Correct Shorts""  and viewed it at the ""New Haven Underground Film Festival"" (with a live audience) I felt obligated to make some sort of positive comment.

As ground breaking as 2001 this animated oddity is the WIZARDS of this new millenium. A cutting edge, wild trip in a sort of eastern european animation tradition this film is not what most American audiences are used to, in the age of super slick contentless Disni-mation.  Clicker generation/shallow/ short attention span damaged slo mo's aint gonna get this film. REal film lovers/ afficionato's/ cult filmers/ and true indies will find this film something very new but oddly retro (and I mean that in the best way) amazingly complex and simple at the same time. I say check it out. Buy a copy. Support independent film.",1180915200,18,926,4.8789808917197455
2769342,4,B000NJ60FM,"This brings the Abbot's _Flatland_ to life. While not in 1:1 correspondence with the book, it does a reasonably good job of driving home the tendency to seek certainty in dogma and to exclude evidence to the contrary. It's interesting to note that Abbot imagined this intolerance as the root of war. Recent years have demonstrated a similar connection in the United States.

Some of the movie seems a little forced, a tad awkward. But it's well worth owning, well worth watching, and definitely worth learning from.",1180828800,25,515,4.919540229885057
2769343,5,B000NJ60FM,"Decades have passed since enjoying ""Flatland"".  It was required reading for a College Class. The introduction to a different way of thinking about the Universe and Infinity was my reward. My Love for Mathematics was forged in a Smithy of bewilderment during the first few pages. My awareness of the World described in simple Euclidean Geometry has expanded to embrace the Beauty of the plane of existence we inhabit. The film was simple but subtle in a way that both theoreticians and laymen can enjoy. I think about ""Flatland"" every Day. This Film is a wonderful diversion that will be viewed over and again.",1180310400,16,609,4.855769230769231
2769344,5,B000NJ60FM,"It has been years since I read Abbott's book, but, being a math teacher, I always bring it up in class. A friend just finished reading the book and gave me her copy since mine was loaned years ago and not returned. So when I bought this DVD, I expected to see the Abbott story, but was I surprised. This is not the same story as in the Abbott book. There is a great story line here and the viewer still gets educated on geometry and dimension. The animation is excellent and I even enjoyed the sound on my surround system. Of course, the story makes more sense if you have read the book. Women have a little more respect and are considered thin rectangles, rather than lines. But you still have to watch yourself around them! Very enjoyable movie!",1178409600,41,747,4.3428571428571425
2769345,4,B000NJ60FM,"We received the Flatland DVD in the mail on Friday, but we were anticipating to watch it the next evening. Since I was so anxious to see it and my daughter was already logged into her computer, I figured it couldn't hurt to get a sneak peek. So I slipped the DVD into her computer.

It turns out that the sneak peek became Family Movie Night. We all were hooked as we wound up watching the film in its entirety on my daughter's computer late Friday night instead of Saturday night as planned!

Ladd not only takes on the difficult task of bringing boring geometrical objects to life, but he also makes these objects very likable and a characterization we all can relate to.

Ladd makes it easy for the viewer to relate in that he makes ""A square's"" house"" across the street from his brother ""B square's"" house.  Also he shows their places of employment as well as detailed interactions with each member of their families.  All of these make it very easy for viewers to relate.

We really felt sorry for ""A square"", especially at the end. (Don't want to give the ending away).

Also, I think ""A Sphere"" is a very strong character in the story and with that captivating accent makes this character that much more believable.  His presence brings the story into a different dimension,..no pun intended.  He makes ""A Square's"" transition into the world of 3D absolutely believable!

Overall the movie was fun for the entire family and I plan on watching it again when it hits the big screen!

Overall, If I had to describe it in two words.

I'd say:

Educationally captivating!

In addition, I would recommend Flatland to all!

Incidentally, I see a part 2 in the future! Flatland II-The Fourth Dimension!",1177977600,21,1701,4.604651162790698
2769346,5,B000NJ60FM,"This independent film has everything to become a big hit... a solid storyline, driven from the book by the same name, that leaves you both amused and disturbed at times. A good soundtrack that leaves it's mark, but doesn't overpower the art and dialogs. Amusing characters that you can't help but sympathize with, and finally, beautiful artwork that has nothing to envy to Hollywood productions, as it doesn't distract your attention from the story itself.

Reading the book beforehand is not necessary, but will definitely help you catch on to the story faster, as you will not sit there wondering what's up with these wacky Flatlanders while an important part of the plot is revealed.

A must see! I highly recommend it.",1174348800,18,722,4.909836065573771
2769347,5,B000NJ60FM,"I have to say, I love this film. I bought is as soon as the special release was available and my DVD is numbered #11! The detailed animation in this film is very impressive. The intricate inner workings of the Flatlanders blew me away. I mean with a bunch of characters on the screen you could see all of their eyes blink, hearts beat, etc. I was simply amazed at the level of detail.

I never read the book but the story is really great. It really makes you wonder what's beyond our 3D world. My kids loved this film also. They keep asking if they can watch it again. It's really cool to see the different things the kids pick up on, and how they interpret the film.

The film is deep on many levels. The music was spot on and fit each scene just right. I would highly recommend this film to anyone! I'd love to see this in the theater.

2769348,4,B000NJ60FM,"Ok, if you're tired of all the talking animal CGI junk Hollywood pumps out each year, this is a great alternative. Keep in mind this is an indie flick so the CGI is not cutting edge but it is never a distraction from the story. Most of the story takes place looking down at a 2D plane, kinda like an old Atari game, which was very retro. I found the voice acting to be top notch for an indie film and I swear the main character 'A' Square sounds exactly like Owen Wilson at times. The music was also very well done. I have not read the book so I can not say how much the film deviates but I guarantee you've never seen a movie like this before. Honestly, the only thing I can really complain about is the ending. The meaning of the last scene is kinda vague, but hey, so is life. Maybe that's the point. Bottom line, if you like unique films, add this to your collection.",1173225600,11,871,4.099415204678363
2769349,4,B000NJ60FM,"Literally. Flatland by Edwin Abbott Abbott was a little gem of a book which could not be pigeon-holed into a specific genre over a hundred and fifty years ago and as a result ended up on Science Fiction shelves. Combining Geometry and Philosophy (and even Religion), it was an allegory on the human condition, describing a very rigidly-structured Society where square pegs aspired to fit through round holes.

The plot focuses on A. Square, who is led to a series of epiphanies on the Nature of Reality itself to the realization that not only is there an existence beyond his two-dimensional plane in the form of a 3-dimensional universe, but that further dimensions are implied. He learns that appearances are not necessarily all they seem.

Difficult to conceptualize in its reading, Llad Ehlinger, Jr. has managed to graphically express this evolution of the mind. Despite these worlds being populated exclusively by geometric shapes, we are drawn into the story and feel A. Square's transformation as though it were our own, which it hopes to be. Flatland itself is appropiately extremely two-dimensional, yet has endearing qualities. From our hero's perspective, he is at first confused, then exhilarated as he is lifted into the three-dimensional world. We are taken along for the dizzying ride. This is only the beginning for A. Square, who then postulates other worlds with both less and more dimensions. Ehlinger has a sequence which can only be an homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey as multi-dimensionality is explored.

As if this were not a big enough task to tackle, Ehlinger expands the storyline by applying some of the original concepts of Governments to their logical path to War. Flatland, both the book and the movie, can be appreciated at many levels. By adding an extra layer, Ehlinger has actually simplified the book.

I enjoyed this movie. It is mind-bending and thought-provoking, with a graphic element integral to its message. A potentially too-heavy treatise is lightened by very humorous details, such as the warbled battle cries of female lines in Flatland, who need to both sway and make noise at all times in order to be seen when not approached from their sides, so as not to pierce unobservant polygons! There is more than meets the eye to this unusual independently filmed and marketed movie. One viewing may not be enough.",1173225600,63,2355,5.0

People who know nothing about flatland will probably not like it and have no clue what the rest of us are watching and think we are retarded.  The 3d graphics are okay, but i think they spin too much. Once in the 3d world the camera almost never stops revolving around the characters.  If you could i would suggest to rent it but you can only buy it.  I wish it was better because i know how long they put into making this.",1173139200,12,577,3.864406779661017

2769352,5,B000NJ60FM,"One STAR !?! That kid wouldn't be able to watch 2001 Space Odyssey either and probably finds old Jackie Chan movie too slow.  I too read this book several times in my youth and everything Abbot wrote.  I figured that Flatland could never be adapted into a film and do the book justice.  Wrong!  If you thought Ghost Rider was the best movie in a generation then you won't like Flatland the Film.  However, if you are one of the few thinking people in the world who don't work for corporate America and still have a sense of wonder and an imagination; then, you will buy 10 copies of this film and give it to 10 strangers telling them that if they don't buy 10 copies and pass the chain on they will be cursed and have a life time of bad luck.

I looked at both versions of this movie that were released in 2007. Although Flatland the film ran a bit longer than I wanted to show in a classroom, I found that the animation was able to hold my students' attention. I was able to incorporate discussions about math, issues of differences, and war.

Besides loving the movie, Flatland the film came with a free license to show it in my classroom. Flatland the Movie, with all its big name voices, wanted to charge me $179 to show their 30 minute film in my classroom. Have you seen the state of public education these days? I need every penny to make sure that my students and I have the supplies we need to function on a daily basis. If I am lucky enough to have $179, I will be using it to buy paper and dry-erase markers.

Pulled the book off the shelf and started reading and found it's all from the book!  Which is gratuitously contemptuous of women who are called the Frail Sex that are ""wholly devoid of brainpower.""  And a whole lot of other put-downs.

The film follows the book closely, and both are badly flawed.  Which is a shame since I've always treasured the book for its explanation of other dimensions.  I wish someone would take this concept and write a totally different story line.",1266192000,6,635,4.878504672897196
