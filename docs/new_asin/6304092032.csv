779558,5,6304092032,"Few westerns pack as much drama, family tragedy, character contrasts, prejudice, and western pioneer history as 'Gunman's Walk'.  If Van Heflin could sing, this could have been a Hackett family sing-along...but then,  maybe not!  Both Tab Hunter and James Darren were tracking singing and acting careers - this happens to be Tab Hunter's best performance as the rogue malcontent, Ed Hackett.  James Darren plays quite the opposite as the easy-going, fun-loving Davy Hackett.  Then there's a veteran cast of characters that makes this motion picture a real stand-out for its time.  Ray Teal, Ed Platt, Mickey Shaughnessy, Bert Convy, Robert Simon, and Paul Birch add class to this film - Simon is particularly effective as the Sheriff.  Mrs. Bing Crosby (Kathryn Grant) plays the beautiful half-breed love interest that divides the brothers.  And, of course, there's Van Heflin - the patriarch who lives past his prime and raises two sons on his own - fresh from another western classic,'3:10 to Yuma'.  Heflin is gritty and masterful as the powerful Lee Hackett - certainly a template for Ben Cartwright in the soon-to-be 'Bonanza' TV series.  This is what a western is supposed to be - entertaining to the very last.  It would be very nice to see this memorialized on DVD.",1160352000,3,1273,5.014285714285714

779561,4,6304092032,"'Gunman's Walk' is one of those terrific films whose narrow focus actually serves to encompass huge themes, such as Family, Race, History, Nation.  It is at this point that the provincial or local becomes properly mythic.  Because although the story isn't really about much - a father, his kids, a murder - it is also based on the oldest story of them all, that of Oedipus the King, the story of a man who unwittingly killed his father, bringing plague upon the country he ruled.
Although the Oedipal story seems deeply tragic and anti-social, it has been used by Freud and his followers to explain the processes of socialisation through sexuality.  The only way a society can ensure its continued survival is through a process that is adequately symolised in the Oedipus story - a child may resent his father's power over him, but one day he'll have to take his place in society, to 'kill' him.  Here the Oedipus story becomes a positive thing for conservative societies that locate themselves in the family.  Paradoxically, although it is the 'natural' order of things, it involves a great struggle, neither man willing to give up his position.
And this is the crux of 'Gunman's Walk'  Lee Hackett is one of those legendary characters who tamed the West, who got there before the law did, who sees himself as a kind of privileged Founding Father.  Except father is the wrong word - he is so afraid of growing old, of being surpassed, that he insists his sons call him 'Lee', while retaining the powers of a father - he has to beat them in everything, convince himself he's still  young.  as this is contrary to nature, a sort of plague ensues, leading to moral breakdown, where a man can murder another and get away with it, because good old dad, sorry Lee, will sort it out.
Lee's two sons have wildly divergent ways of dealing with their father's overwhelming pre-eminence.  Danny is the sensible, sensitive one, who defeats his dad, plays the Oedipal game, by simply ignoring his values, his macho gun-play, his turning everyday activities into masculine rites and tests.  He ignores his racism and his stifling brand of family loyalty.
Ed, on the other hand, takes Dad at his word, and tries to defeat him.  Unlike Lee, though, he has not got a powerful social apparatus that he helped create to help him, and he goes speedily, violently, trigger-happy insane.  The film's best sequences involve Ed's increasingly doomed and desperate attempts to prove his manhood, to surpass his dad.
The film, with its youthful, teen-market stars, seems to centre on the brothers, but it is really about Lee.  He is a near-tragic figure, his two sons split versions of his self, his potential for good leading to family, and his history mired in violence taken to extremes.  Van Heflin's brilliant performance, revealing the desperation behind the bluster, convinces us of this.
But, as his name suggests, Lee represents so much more - America, its history.  the murdered boy is a Red Indian - Lee's stature derives from his own battles with the Indians which helped create the West.  Times have changed: family, civilisation and reconciliation must replace violence, reputation and individualism.  it sounds so easy, but director Karlson emphasises the fierce trauma and disruption of the process.  His deftly buoyant camerawork during action sequences is among the most vivid and exciting I have ever seen.",1001030400,12,3400,4.881739130434783
779562,5,6304092032,"A rancher (Van Heflin) whose life spans the time of the wild west and the beginnings of civilization in the American West has two sons. One (Tab Hunter) embodies the wild ways of his youth, the other (James Darren)  represents his more sensitive, civilized side. The father caters to his  out-of-control wild son and dismisses the more level-headed one as weak.  Eventually, the father is forced to confront the ruffian and re-evaluate  his rejection of the kinder, gentler son.
I read a story about Phil  Karlson screening the film for hard-nosed Columbia Pictures boss Harry  Cohn. Cohn, who had two sons, wept at the end of the film and told Karlson  he was going to make him the biggest director in Hollywood. But Cohn died  shortly thereafter, and Karlson continued to languish in obscurity (despite  the major hit ""Walking Tall"" and not helped by such cheesy  assignments as Matt Helm movies), and with relatively little appreciation  for such cheapo noir masterpieces as ""Phenix City Story.""
I'm  aghast to see a review on this site calling this the worst movie ever. It's  one of my all-time favorites. [Actually it seems that someone mistakenly  posted a dis on ""Simon Birch"" as a rating of ""Gunman's  Walk,"" which is a shame since it's the only vote for GW on this  site.]
Years ago I showed this one at a film society (a million years  ago, people used to rent 16mm films and show them for a pittance for other  film fans) and for reasons I can't figure out, we drew a packed house that  somehow knew this was a special movie. The air conditioner blew out on a  hot summer day, but everyone stayed and was totally rapt by this poignant  little picture.",955584000,34,1663,4.665517241379311

7861597,5,6304092032,"Gunman's Walk is a very good film released in 1958. Tab Hunter and James Darren starred as brothers who are emotional opposites. Fans of westerns,  Tab Hunter, and James Darren will like this the most.",1430784000,,201,4.742857142857143

7861599,4,6304092032,"Van Heflin plays a somewhat aged well-to-do ranch owner who came to the area as a pioneer and was very instrumental in building the city near his now very large ranch. He was very fast with his gun in his youth and is still fast now. He fought Indians and despises them today. He wants to raise his kids to be as macho as he was and is but, as the film shows, he fails. The oldest and favorite of his two sons is Tab Hunter, who is very spoiled. He hates how his father orders him around. He is very violent with other people. He also hates Indians. The film shows how he gets into trouble several times. Heflin's second son loves his father but not his macho ways. He does not want to wear a gun, and is a very bad shot. He falls in love with a half-breed Indian girl.",1389139200,,769,4.032679738562091
7861600,1,6304092032,"The title is worse than the film. When the Spanish version offers a title which is translated as 'The Wages of Violence', you know that you're in for a long haul. The story of a gnarled old patriarch (Van Heflin) with two entirely different sons, a baddie played by Tab Hunter and a goodie, played by James Darren, is easily outlassed by 'Broken Lance' where Spencer Tracy has similar problems with his brood. Heflin is no Tracy, and neither Hunter nor Darren can compare with Richard Widmark. The theme, so inanely developed here, had been covered before in 'Duel in the Dust' where Joseph Cotten is the goodie, and Gregory Peck is the baddie. The trouble is that Jennifer Jones is more seductive and feistier than Kathryn Grant even if neither of them gives any indication of native American roots. I like Van Heflin. He was great in 'Shane' and pretty effective in '3.10 to Yuma', but when he breaks down in tears at the end of this movie, I sympathise with him. I too weep when I have to spend good money on this Columbian dross.",1370476800,,1033,4.529411764705882
7861601,2,6304092032,"i have just purchased this disc believing it to be 16x9 1.85 aspect ratio,but it isn't.. its 2.35 4.3 and the picture quality is not good ,brownish colour and blury wide and longshots..close ups are okay. this is actually an above average western with some good star performances so if you really want to own this film you may consider it worth the money,but technology has progressed so far these days that its a pity we have to put up with movie releases that are little better than video quality albeit widescreen.then again what benefit is the widescreen if the picture is so small you can barely discern the contents?",1347667200,2,622,4.663636363636364
7861602,4,6304092032,"...Today is Tab Hunter's 80th birthday.  Most of the films that he was forced to make... well... like Elvis... his handlers put him in shlock... Either the films were no good or his role that of vanilla coated All American Boy.

...Damn Yankees fun... and They Came to Cordura gave a hint of his acting talent... But Gunman's Walk... well... his handlers must have been at the casino or something... This is definitely Hunter's top performance.

...Very much cast against type... His character is handsome and intelligent... fit and skilled... and largely a sociopath... His few fits and seizures of decency... such as addressing his brother's concern for his injury... are almost awkward... as if rusty...

...He has a massive chip on his shoulder... thinking that he needs to be better than his father (Van Heflin) a legend of the frontier... and he resents the fact that he will never do it... The film starts at a time when Hunter's character starting to act out in very dangerous ways... refusing to see the dangers... or accept the consequences...

  A good plot...that deals with complex issues... Not your average ""Blazing Guns West of the Pecos"" film.  Fine supporting cast.  Van Heflin as the father who knows better but threatens a severely wounded man if he dares testify against his son...  But unlike his son, Heflin knows where the final line is... (Heflin and Hunter had worked together in late '54 on Battle Cry)

  Hunter must have relished his chance to utterly abandon the squeeky clean image for at least one film.  Other actors in his shoes might have given an over the top performance... but Hunter knew that his character suffering from years of self-doubt and resentment coming to the surface all at once... Not an evil man... but a man doing bad things because his moral compass stuck in the wrong position.

  It is said that in 1948... John Ford saw John Wayne in Red River and said... ""I didn't know that big lug could really act..."" and Wayne's career headed towards many better films.  Elvis wanted to be the white racist in The Defiant Ones... might have opened a career in vastly better films... but ""Colonel Parker"" (his handler) flat out said no... Parker was good at making money... but nothing else...

  Unlike Elvis... Tab Hunter had a chance to show what he could do... But for all of its quality... this was a relatively small Western... and Hunter already firmly typecast.  This film at least shows that he was a real actor...

  Way past time for a quality DVD...",1310342400,3,2506,4.758700696055684
7861603,4,6304092032,"I'm glad to have this to add to my collection of movies James Darren had a role in.  I wish the tape had had it wide screened and hope it will come out on DVD in that format.  My sympathies were with James Darren's character throughout and where it would have been interesting to see what he could have done with the role of the bad son, he did fine with the role of the sensitive younger son.",1179446400,2,393,4.0256410256410255
