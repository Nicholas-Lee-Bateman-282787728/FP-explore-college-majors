8304830,5,B001GBIOS2,Great workout. Her upper body is terrific! The lower body portion hurts my back but I have lower back problems. It was well worth the price for the upper body portion alone.,1492387200,,173,4.4375
8304831,5,B001GBIOS2,"I love workout videos. This workout is great and has a variety of options. You can do the premixes or the body part splits. Amy explains the movements clearly and always tries to keep you motivated while pushing through the workout. The intensity is what you make of it from the weight selection, but be warned some moves are not for beginners so proceed with caution if you are new to weights.",1356739200,,394,4.486111111111111
8304832,4,B001GBIOS2,I am very happy I purchased this video. Amy does a great job in motivating you. The excercises that she does are a little different from normal things that you would do in the gym but the same kind of workout you would get paying tons of $$$ for a trainer. I am a huge Cathe Friedrich fan and usually stick with just her videos. I wanted something similar (hard core wise) and I found it. I also purchased the 'all pump xtreme' dvd and that one is even better!,1277769600,2,460,4.122222222222222
8304833,5,B001GBIOS2,"I love, love, love Amy Bento!  I used to be a die-hard Cathe fan, but Amy is my new favorite instructor.  Amy's Slo-Mo Strength Challenge DVD is a great value, with lots of premixes.  You can do body splits, e.g. legs, back & shoulders, chest & biceps & triceps.

You lift as heavy as you can to a very slow tempo.  You'll need a lot of focus to do this workout.  Amy doesn't give a lot of form pointers, so you should be very, very attentive to your form.  You also need to have a good body awareness.  When I first did the leg section, I went too heavy and my back was sore.

I especially liked the following things about this DVD:

**Amy tells us what weights she's using; it helps me pick appropriate weights.

**Amy & crew do the equipment changes on screen with us.  Too many other instructors cut this part out and I'm always having to pause the DVD so I can change my weight or get new equipment.

**the unique exercises.  I do a lot of weight training and it can get boring at times doing the same old exercises.

**the rockin' music.  Amy has a gift for choosing great, uplifting music for her workouts.

**Amy's enthusiastic and encouraging personality.  She always makes me smile.

Since you'll need so much concentration for this type of workout, I would suggest you only do it for a month or so to avoid overtraining and burnout.  Here's a particularly effective and challenging rotation that I use:

**3 weeks SloMo Strength, followed by 1 rest week

**3 weeks of Amy's All Pump Extreme(using premixes to create body splits), followed by 1 rest week

**3 weeks of SloMo Strength, followed by a 1 rest week.

I also find it helpful to write down what weights I've used so I can increase them as I get further into the program.

I highly recommend this DVD for any advanced exercisers who are looking for something different, yet effective.",1270425600,9,1853,4.443452380952381
8304834,5,B001GBIOS2,"If you've never done an Amy Bento and are ready to take your fitness to the next level here is your chance.  Amy is very innovative in the fact that she doesn't use the same tired moves over and over and incorporates new fresh move that will challenge your body is ways you can only imagine.  This is a advanced workout but doable.  I have done Cathe before this and was really impressed on the level she took workouts, then I did Amy's workouts.  The entire workout is great.  I find that I know I did this workout even 2 days later but it's a good burn.  If you want to increase your metabolism you have to build muscle and with this dvd you will do exactly that.  You decide your level by the weight your use, but find you are capable of doing a lot more then you think.  Amy's cueing is right on target and is very easy to follow and understand.  This is the type of workout that you won't grow bored doing.  The premixes are great because you can select what you're up for that day.  A great way to build muscle and lose fat.",1219881600,3,1030,4.125628140703518
8304835,5,B001GBIOS2,"This is possibly one of the toughest dvd workouts I've seen/done.  That isn't a bad thing; it is extremely challenging and definately NOT for beginners.  The four workouts here are so tough going, they'll give you results you've been looking for for sure.
Amy makes you really concentrate on controlling the weights on both the up and down movements which are very effective ways to work your muscles.  You need a step bench, couple of different sets of weights, a resistance band and barbell.  Be prepared to work hard (and feel sore for at least 2-3 days later as I did).
Amy is a great instructor who doesn't mess around and gets straight to the core of the workouts.  She is motivating and cues well and I really 'like' this a lot because I know it works.",1199491200,12,759,4.510948905109489
8304836,5,B001GBIOS2,"Hi. First, I am an official advanced fitness DVD addict. Cathe has always been my staple ,and I'll always buy anything she ever puts out. I'm very happy there is ""a new kid on the block"" in advanced exercise DVD instructors, Amy Bento. Amy is fantastic!
 I'd read many raves for Amy on Video Fitness Forum leading me to purchase ""Slo Mo Challenge."" I would buy this DVD on the Leg/Glute work alone. She doesn't do the same old exercises & really works you hard. Amy's personality is warm and encouraging. From reading Amy's forum, she really listens to her fans and creates workouts that fit right into what people are asking for. I'm also really glad she's included an audio option on some of her DVD's to just have her voice.
 The DVD is a great deal because for $20 you get a three day split plus quite a few premixes. Keep them coming Amy Bento!!",1195430400,16,850,4.407643312101911
