8036736,5,B0006213NA,"This was something that I had despaired of ever seeing.  The YOU-ARE-THERE version of ""The Gunfight AT The O K Corral"", with future ""Star Trek"" co-star Deforest Kelley playing a rather sedate Ike Clanton.  Also featured is the Dalton Gang's final crime, the failed robbery of two banks in their home town of Coffeeville; a crime which prompted their downfall.",1468627200,,359,4.966666666666667

8036738,4,B0006213NA,"I enjoyed this show as a kid.  TV westerns were really popular back then but this show presents pretty accurate historical re-enactments of exciting events in an on-the-spot news format.  Interesting and fun novelty, and both shows only about 25 minutes.",1444521600,,254,5.170731707317073
