The story, based on real happenings, is about a little girl that climbs out her window one night and winds up lost in the Outback. There is a native tracker who can find her, but her father will not allow blacks on his land.  After several days, the mother goes to the tracker and together they follow the little girls trail, but it is too late to save her.
Most of the dialog is in the form of song, but that only adds to the pathos. Honestly, I'm extremely pleased with this movie.",1366243200,4,662,4.092307692307692
