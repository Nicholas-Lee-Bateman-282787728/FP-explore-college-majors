8395063,5,B003DZAM1G,Three very enjoyable movies. I bought this set because I wanted Great Balls of Fire but didn't want to pay some $40.00 for it at the time. I bought this set instead for $3.00 and I'm very pleased with it. Mermaids was the bonus and Autumn in New York is a nice movie also.,1474416000,,272,4.055555555555555
