I am interested to know when the DVD will be coming out with Part 1 & 2 together.  I hope there will be additional footage, pictures, etc. that we Buddy Rich lovers will be able to check out.",1010880000,,299,4.137931034482759
8516181,5,6303293123,"What I liked most was that it included a lot of video of Buddy in the mid-60s, just as he was moving into mainstream prominence.  Like a lot of teenagers at that time, I was blown away by Buddy and his sensational band,  and this video takes me back to those exciting years when the band was  frequently on TV.  A highlight is a performance of the band on the  ""Away We Go"" show, which I watched religiously back in 1967.  Wish we'd had video recorders back then!  In an published review of this  video, the writer talks about Buddy playing a drum solo using two sticks in  each hand.  After watching the clip, it was probably the case that Buddy  was just too fast for the film, and each stick blurred into two.  But it is  hard to tell!  God bless those people responsible for this series--only by  seeing Buddy, can one appreciate his true genius.",962150400,7,850,4.32484076433121
