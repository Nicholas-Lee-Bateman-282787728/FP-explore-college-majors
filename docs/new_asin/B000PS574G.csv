2827847,5,B000PS574G,Nice way to set the atmosphere when you don't have a fireplace. You can almost feel the heat from the flaming logs.,1387065600,,115,4.2727272727272725
2827848,5,B000PS574G,"Love it. Plays continuously With great fire crackling sounds, which you do t have to set the volume way up to hear. I have another DVD that I have to set the volume way up to hear any cracklings ... Then inevitably I forget when turning tv programs back on and whamo! Nice fire images too!",1386547200,,289,4.178571428571429
2827849,3,B000PS574G,I would have loved this dvd but the top of the flames were hardly visible. I would rather have seen the entire flame instead of the bottom of flames and hearth.,1386201600,3,160,4.193548387096774
2827850,5,B000PS574G,"This DVD is probably my favorite ambient DVD.  I saw something similar in a home decorating magazine once, and after looking around, I decided to order this one.  I am definitely glad I did!  I don't have a fireplace (and I don't really want or need one), but I find crackling fires EXTREMELY calming and soothing.  This DVD fits the bill!  I especially love how loud and realistic the fire noises are.  One can hear the snapping of the wood and the hiss of the fire itself.  In the autumn and winter, I put this DVD on almost every night while I am getting cozy in my jammies with a book or magazine.  Sometimes I also light a candle that smells like fire (note to producer - maybe create a package deal with the DVD and a candle?!)  If I turn the lights down a bit, it really seems as if I am sitting in front of a lovely fire.  I use this DVD at all my fall/winter gatherings, and I always get positive comments about how it is great background noise and adds to the seasonal ambiance.  I recommend this DVD to everyone - easier, less messy, and less expensive than building an actual fire, and just as realxing (though you'll have to cook your marshmallows for s'mores in the microwave!)",1383177600,3,1191,4.31981981981982
2827851,5,B000PS574G,This is a very good fireplace dvd with great realism and more colors than just orange and yellow in the various sequences. Good to relax with on a cold evening. :-),1363305600,2,164,4.32258064516129
2827852,5,B000PS574G,"Received the DVD just in time for the arrival of frigid weather, and it's a very welcome addition to my fireplace-less home. However, I was a bit dismayed at the frenetic flame action in the top three frames (as viewed from the main menu). It's fast and furious, as if somebody just tossed accelerant on the logs. Not exactly the restful and relaxing ambiance I was expecting. If the first three viewing options had titles, they'd be something like, ""Conflagration!,"" ""Flames on Speed,"" and ""Grab the Extinguisher!"" I guess what I was hoping for was something more along the lines of ""Mellow Burn."" But the bottom two viewing options have a slower flame pace and are much more soothing. And the lower right option on the main menu offers a close-up of just logs and flames, which is nice. As for the sound, except for the first frame, where the snaps and crackles have a weird, tinny sound as if the fire is burning in a giant, metal barrel, the others have fairly realistic audio, and when I walked into another room while the DVD was playing, the pops, cracks and hisses made me feel that I really had a fireplace with a nice, cozy fire going in the living room... On another cold, rainy day, I turned on my ""fireplace"" while reading a book, and ended up napping to the sound of gently popping and crackling logs, and it was lovely waking up to what appeared like a real fire. This is a nice DVD with good picture quality, and I appreciate that there isn't any naff background music. I also like that you see only the fire itself, and not a hearth or mantel. And the automatic replay means I can keep the ""fire"" going for hours without having to do anything. This DVD is near perfect, and on a large screen, I imagine it would be fabulous.",1360195200,12,1741,4.44375
2827853,5,B000PS574G,"perfect for the camper or home, nice sounds and continuous loop, just wish it was longer",1269561600,3,88,4.5625
2827854,4,B000PS574G,Pleasant to play  on a cool evening.  Scenes change quietly for a realistic approach  to a real fireplace with logs burning.  Amazon shipped very quickly.,1264982400,,154,5.04
2827855,5,B000PS574G,"What a great DVD!!  I ordered this in early November in hopes of getting before Thanksgiving.  It arrived a little over a week later with a few days left before ths holiday and I had it playing before our guests arrived.  My wife's grandfather came over and asked when we built the fireplace.

Anyways, we have a large wide screen within an entertainment cabinet and this fills up the entire box!!  Just like a large resort would have!!  Very easy to immerse yourself in this video and create some quiet evenings at home.  I was very picky about the quality of the flame.  I previwed several others that used a gas or fuel assisted flame that was always blue.  I wanted a natural orange flame with natural wood and got just what I wanted!!

Thank you for the quick delivery Tony! I am already looking at your other selections in your DVD library for our collection.",1229040000,8,865,4.487179487179487
2827856,5,B000PS574G,"I read lots of reviews and did lots of research before purchasing and I'm glad i did. Love this DVD. It's got 5, i think, fireplaces you can choose from and I have a couple of faves, but they're all good in different ways. It has the natural crackling sounds that a fireplace has. No music, which is good. and no hand coming in to mess with the fire. most of them loop about every 15 minutes. Very pleased.",1423958400,,406,4.151898734177215

2827864,5,B000PS574G,"This was a gift to my parents after seeing it playing at a neighbor's home.  There is a choice of 5 different fires, with different arrangement of wood and flames.  The video is a nice closeup and the microphone picks up the sounds of the flames and the crackling of the wood as it burns.  Nice to enjoy a fire in the fireplace (courtesy of a 27"" monitor) without having to clean up the ashes.",1419638400,,393,4.213333333333333

2827872,5,B000PS574G,I like this dvd and would recommend it. However the different segments are a little to short and the fire is to ragging for what i like.,1393113600,,136,4.074074074074074

8193016,5,B000PS574G,"This is my first fireplace DVD and I think it is awesome. On the DVD there are five different fires and they all look very realistic. You can hear the cracking of logs and you even think to feel the warmth that the fire radiates. Since I cannot install a fireplace in my house, this is a very good alternative, just wonderful. Now I have my fireplace and it can be seen on the TV whenever I want to. The quality of the photography is fantastic, I am very happy for the DVD.",1429056000,,473,4.096774193548387
