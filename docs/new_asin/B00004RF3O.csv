1343426,4,B00004RF3O,"Not a half bad movie, but because of the remarkable quality of movies coming out of China, this does not quite rate 5 stars.

There's a certain amount of irritation in the first sword fight due to an intentional 'strobe' effect.  Fortunately they give up on that very quickly and the balance of the film is good Chinese fantasy and 'wire fu'.  This is not Wuxia, at least not in the strictest sense, since everybody involved is some sort of royal personage (the early part is a brief exception, since one of the primary characters comes from a swordsmith but becomes a royal later).

It should be noted this is based on a Hong Kong comic book series.  I think that initial irritating sword fight is a bow to that.  At the very end there is also a brief nod.

The cast is very good.  The language is Cantonese, but I listen to the Mandarin dub (I understand a very little bit of Mandarin and English subtitles fill in the many blanks).

A special nod to Sonny Chiba.  He was so well made up I needed to stare awhile before I recognized him.  It's a little strange watching him in Cantonese and listening in Mandarin.  It was especially strange because his lips synced well with the Mandarin dub...",1430006400,,1196,4.435779816513762

1343457,3,B00004RF3O,"First off, this can be found for a much lower price at off-shore sites.

This Blu-ray release isn't going to win over any converts to this movie.  The effects don't stand up compared to those of today, and Blu-ray technology only enhances the flaws of the film, BUT for those of you who remember its release 11 years ago, this is probably a disc you will want to purchase.

I recall when ""Stormriders"" came out.  It was the first big digital effects laden movie to come out of Hong Kong, and this movie with the ascendency of director Johnnie To and Milkyway (""The Longest Nite,"" ""A Hero Never Dies,"" and ""The Mission,"" all released within a nine-month period or so) marked a rebirth for HK flicks. Unfortunately, ""Stormriders"" is a bit of a mess.  Those seeking authentic martial arts need not look to this swordplay fantasy epic featuring Sonny Chiba as he manipulates two young men (Ekin Cheng and Aaron Kwok) who are destinted to topple him.  Beside those actors there's a busload of famous HK actors and actresses here doing the best they can.  The action is choppy with jump cuts (and that pretty much describes the movie's plot, too).

The disc features Cantonese (two) and Mandarin (one) audio tracks and optional English subtitles (plus several for various Asian viewers).  The only extras are the trailer and a lousy effects reel.",1243987200,2,1340,4.741379310344827
1343458,5,B00004RF3O,"This film is one of the greatest martial arts ever. It has a outstanding cast (Sonny Chiba, Anthony Wong). Incredible action and drama.

I like it, and it's great fantasy entertainment, but it'd probably be better WITH Takehsi Kaneshiro.  Anyhoo, please correct the info.",1233792000,,402,4.940298507462686

1343462,1,B00004RF3O,I ordered this movie thinking it was the one I watched before and was EXTREMELY disappointed! Was only able to watch 10 minutes of it and turned it off. I was finally able to watch the whole DVD and HATED it! I wasn't able to even GIVE this DVD away!!! Hopefully this time I found the right DVD (the 1998 one),1221264000,3,309,4.081967213114754
1343463,1,B00004RF3O,"I enjoy good Asian movies particularly when Takeshi Kaneshiro is in one but he is not in this movie!  I didn't see Aaron either.  I really wish I'd read the reviews before buying and I will from now on, just to make sure the character's listed are actually in the movie.  Now who would have thought that was necessary?  Of course I could tell from the cover that he wasn't going to be the lead character which was fine with me but I should've realized he's not the caliber of actor that isn't on the cover any more.  Is it possible that when they say the movie is by Takeshi they mean he produced it?  I'm so clueless and annoyed with their misleading information I could almost scream.  If they had't lied about the cast I wouldn't have bought this at all.

It's obviously a television drama edited quite poorly with lots of action, wuxia wire action included, good looking actors and a somewhat confusing plot.  If it's a sequel I suppose that explains some of the problems because people pop in and the main characters know them but we've no idea who they are or if they're bad or good though we assume they must be friends or enemies or both depending upon their actions.  At one point they're all together a la power rangers forming a giant sword and I didn't have a clue who they were or how Wind even got there working to help the bad guy.  I also didn't realize Wave was the brother of Cloud (I think) until much later in the story.  It would have packed much more of an emotional punch if I'd known from the beginning but maybe because I was so bored it got past me somehow!?

When Wind becomes a demon there's no explanation as to how long or when he changes back to normal or even how.  He's with Mung, his wife one minute then not the next, she adopts a boy and then he's never seen again until it's his cue to warn her inadvertently that the master has a cold behind.  It's just a hodge podge of scenes thrown together that leave you wondering how he or she did/got so and so.  I wouldn't recommend this movie at all.

It's filmed more like a soap opera, has that video feel to it and it's simply edited horribly.  I was bored waiting to see when Takeshi would appear thinking perhaps he was the nameless one but I couldn't even figure out who the nameless one was.  Maybe if they'd followed through with that, whoever they wanted as the nameless one, it might have given it more of a punch.  A perfect way to waste one's time.",1220572800,6,2440,4.2745098039215685
1343464,2,B00004RF3O,"I bought this because I thought Takeshi Kaneshiro is the lead actor. When I got the DVD, then I realized he is not in it at all.

1343465,3,B00004RF3O,"The actor list which includes Takeshi was what prompted me to buy this, but he wasn't in the movie at all! The other thing is that although containing some special effects, it pails in comparison to the earlier movie version made in Hong Kong starring Ekin Cheng and Arron Kwok because the storyline ran a little wide. It is supposed to be the sequel to the story, but seemed more like a poorly made drama serial - any avid drama serial watcher usually is able to tell the diff between the hong kong made ones from the inferior ones made else where simply because the hong kong made ones have better execution, direction and script because of their experience.",1210982400,,660,4.554621848739496
1343466,5,B00004RF3O,"There is poetic elegance in most Chinese films and I am happy to state this film is no exception. It is one of the main reasons I love Chinese cinema. This film has a playfulness and creativity with an exaggeration of certain qualities and characteristics that seems to be the hallmark of Chinese films. It is whimsical, funny, and entertaining. The costumes are very colorful and artistically designed. The hair styles of the actors and actresses are true to each character, some are modern and punkish, others are classically beautiful and elegant. The natural scenery is breath-takingly beautiful: jagged mountains, various green oriental foliage, a peaceful lake, gorges with multi-layered soil that looks like a modern art painting, and lovely valleys. Lok City is done in ancient Chinese splendor. The architecture and carvings of various buildings are stunning. There is one scene in which cherry blossom are frozen on the trees which creates an eerily glistening creatively beautiful effect. Feng Shui is clearly evident within the interior sets where minimal furniture, wall hangings and carved structures speak loudly of the artistry and creativity of the designers.

In this film, Wind and Cloud are martial artists who represent the righteous forces of justice and goodness. When they combine their energy and forces against an evil immortal named Dai-Sik-Tien (DTS) and his followers, fireworks erupt. DTS has captured Mung, the beautiful wife of Wind and put her into a state of suspended animation. She looks dead as she lies in her coffin made of ice while floating on a canopied raft in the middle of a lake. Wind tries to revive his wife without success. DTS offers him a capsule, with two options: he swallows it and dies so that his wife may live or she takes it and dies, so that he may live. Of course, Wind is generous and loving so he swallows the capsule. It turns out to be a trick: she remains in a state of suspension, neither alive nor dead. Wind turns into al demonic fighter for three days. He is pitted against the very forces he had defended and to which he had belonged. Eventually, the spell breaks and he returns to his previous personality and revives Mung. But the battle lines have been drawn, the population is suffering as the dark forces descend deeper into their lives. With stunning choreography, Wind, Cloud, Wave and several other righteous fighters do battle against the evil fighters. The sword play is outstanding. This brief scenario describes one of the many subplots within this magnificently done film.

In another scene, Wind helps a lady who had stolen something in the marketplace, he heals her injured arm. Little does he know that she is in disguise and part of the evil empire. He escorts her to her destination but along the way, she falls in love with him, tempting him in every possible manner. He resists and does not fall for her trap. While DTS is disappointed, he is very cunning and develops a devious plot to destroy the righteous fighters. In fact, he has won over at least one of the righteous ones to his side. He devises a scheme to destroy the dragon which lives in a gorge in the realm. He engages seven righteous martial arts warriors to join him in a coalition to kill the beast. The fight scenes are stunningly beautiful and highly creative. In one, the seven fighters on signal use their sword to ride ... like a surf board in the sky. In another magnificently conceived scene: the seven fighters stand on each other's shoulders, DTS joins them at the top. They make what looks like an energized totem pole which becomes a huge sword from their combined energy. Needless to say ... the dragon is slain. However, the biggest fight is yet to come as DTS attempts to gain the dragon's spirit all for himself. At the time, the dragon's spirit had split into small fireballs ... each of the seven warriors and DTS managed to retain one for himself. DTS wants it ALL ... Uncle Tsui Fook, an immortal from the righteous realm, joins the warriors in this fight. From this point forward, there are several treats and surprises in store for the viewer. Be assured that I have only touched the tip of the iceberg in describing scenes from this most highly recommended film. It is playful, entertaining, creative and a joy to watch.

1343469,5,B00004RF3O,"I have to start with some information and answers to questions first here.
This IS the film about wind, cloud, storm, and frost who control an elemental force each with cloud having the water manipulation power, frost having ice powers and storm having a few powers. also in this film is the graveyard of magical swords everyone is always asking about same with the above water fighting. the special effects are truly excellent sadly this is a chinese version (region 0 aka free) and seemed to work fine on all players including the newer model sony ps2's so this is the wind and cloud disc everyone is looking for.

Review:
 This is a story of a japanese warlord seeking to become the supreme ruler of the entire province. however there is a legend of 2 boys that will be born with legendary power and if he finds them they will unite his power throughout the land for the next 10 years.. however this is only the first part of the legend the 2nd part is stuck in an enchanted puzzle box that takes 10 years to solve. when solved it reveals that when wind and cloud join forces they will become a storm to end lord conquerer.
thus the battle begins with again I say superb special effects and a asian style sword and the sorcerer type of film and some of the magical sword effects are truly amazing especally since things like this I have only ever seen done in videogames NOT Movies. it's a masterpiece and while there is an english dubbed version out there I prefer the true format it started out as without any edits and this IS IT!!!

5 star special effects
5 star sound and presentation
the kung fu theater acting you expect 4 stars
overall: a must own title with some blood and gore and a few godlike scenes of violence that may mar this film for a few fans of the film (like me) will be thrilled to get this full unedited version of this rare gem.

1343471,2,B00004RF3O,"A lot of pouting, non-sexually threatening young Asian actors and not a whole lot else. There is basically no martial arts to speak of in this film (don't confuse wiring an actor to zoom around a set or CGI environment with real kung fu). What fighting there is takes the form of magic fire balls, etc., being hurled about by flying, angsty actor. Shu Qi is gorgeous as always, probably the best thing in this otherwise below average movie. If you are a kungfu fan, forget this film. If you just want to look at models posing, then this is something for you.

""Storm Riders"" is utterly mindless, and occassionally silly entertainment.

To do this, they removed a lot of side story and just plopped the viewers into the middle of some stuff with just enough information to sort things out.

This is one of those Television movie/mini-series remakes of a theatrical release.  You will not get cinematic visuals, you will get TV quality visuals.

Too many people are not providing appropriate reviews and this is more a betrayal of your consumer bethren.

The original Storm Riders is an amazing fantasy tale, this is not.  This is more like a standard kung fu action flick that uses the characters.  Storm Riders had that fantasy feel, this does not.  There is good kung fu action, but this thing seems incoherent while you are trying to watch it, and that may be because they have tried to cut and paste the movie together, if my theory is correct in that it was a miniseries adaptation.  The story starts and stops with no flow.

If you just want an action flick with some decent fight scenes get this, it's tolerable, but in no way is it on the caliber of Storm Riders.  I really wish they establish a standard that differentiates the TV adaptations from real theatrical releases, such releases tend to be a bit insulting.

The ONLY thing that is redeeming for this is a really cute female actor, and that's it!  I've never seen Wind and Cloud so unattractive, and this is based off Aaron Kwock and Ekin Cheng.  These 2 are appropriate, but no substitute.",1147564800,13,1304,4.593073593073593

1343490,5,B00004RF3O,"This movie is based on the comic series called Fun Wang (translated to Wind Cloud). We get a dose of real-life ""action animation,"" which is unique and very distinct from Hollywood. These types of supernatural chinese martial arts match perfectly to the advanced special effects and CG of today. Remember that this is an adaption from Chinese comics, so expect guys with marital art prowess, and not guys with bulging muscles and skin-tight costume.

In terms of story, it is nothing new. Two young men, Cloud and Wind, are initially unfriendly toward each other (why? because of a woman, what else). Later they must forget their differences and fight together against a common enemy. Sounds familiar enough? The plot also has elements of destiny, revenge, and rejection.

Probably the reason why you may want to watch it, however, is for the cool fighting special effects. There are very few hand-to-hand combats, and more ""ki"" combat, like throwing fireballs and whatnot. One of the coolest special effect to me is Cloud's Hundred Palm Technique, which looks very flashy. One gripe is that some of the computer graphics are overdone for scenary replacement. Visually, you have a sense of an ancient Chinese era. However, I do not think the costume fit the time frame. There are some questionable taste around.  Acoustically, DTS, with its higher bitrate, is just superb. I can even here the water fizzles.  You need to watch this show to get another world of HK movie-making.

In summary, I think computer special effects fit well with comic-book style kung-fu shows. Hong Kong movies pretty much dominate this type of genre. If that is something that you want to see, then Stormriders is a decent example.",1102982400,15,1707,4.954545454545454

1343492,4,B00004RF3O,"Storm Riders is a nearly perfect chinese fantasy movie! If you are thinking, maybe another Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, you are not even close. I am not at all saying that if you like C.T.H.D. you won't like this, they are just two very different movies. Along with some high-wire acts, Storm Riders combines great visual effects with exciting and original sword play. The sword fighting along with some hand to hand action is purely of the fantasy kind consisting of swords throwing huge waves of energy out from them to whirlwind kicks and manipulating liquid to be used as a weapon. There is also real fighting mixed in there to keep you from saying this is too much.

  Sounds a bit out there, doesn't it. You must know that this film is based on a comic book. The story is of two young boys who are raised and ruled by the man who killed their parents and grow up to become martial arts masters. Filled with a ton of action, this tale is of loyalty, love, and revenge. The movie slows down a few times, but only to add to the depth of the story, then right back into another gravity-defying brawl. The acting is much better than I anticipated and is probably the best I have seen Ekin Cheng perform.

The movie is in widescreen but not anamorphic.  Excellent film quality and sound(DTS/Dolby Digital) help this movie really come to life. You will have to read subtitles but they are done very well. There are no extensive lines that will cause you to have to speed read.

  If you have an open mind when it comes to fantasy you will surely enjoy this one. Overall, I was thoroughly impressed and must recommend checking this out.",1091232000,52,1636,4.484848484848484

The Orginial version of The Storm Riders is 128 mins long. It was a drag to find out that they cut a lot of stuff out on the English DUBB version. I mean look they really skipped alot of scenes that were very crucial to the movie. If you don't want to read the subtitles Then The English DUBB is right for you only you get half of what you see. On the other hand if you get The Orginal Version from HongKong The Subtitles are anoyying sometimes but you'll see the full length movie instead of being drag to what the heck happened.

1343498,5,B00004RF3O,"The wuxia/super martial arts subgenre of HK films is pretty well established. However, the Storm Riders goes somewhat beyond the usual and adds in a set of actors who were clearly chosen not just for their ability to carry off martial arts on screen, but for their prettyboy looks -- a characteristic of a great deal of the ""god-warrior"" anime subgenre. The result is like a cross between Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Saint Seiya, and it works surprisingly well.
Storm Riders has the usual angst-tragedy overtones of wuxia films like CTHD or The Bride With White Hair; the Bad Guy, Lord Conquer, is (as usual) Trying To Take Over the World, and is given a prophecy that his success and failure hinge on two people, ""Wind"" and ""Cloud"", who are mere children at that point. In the great tradition of classics the world round, like Pharoah and Moses in the Old Testament, Conquer's actions subsequent to the prophecy are, of course, going to make it come true. (Just once, I'd like to see a show in which the prophet makes this prophecy and the Evil Dude shortcircuits it by shooting the prophet and ignoring the prediction. Maybe I'll do that for my next book.) Conquer finds all boys who might fit the description and raises them as his own (having, naturally, whacked their parents). Things go along swimmingly for Conquer for a while, but naturally this is all going to come apart once the boys become young men. BOTH sides -- Conquer's AND Our Heroes' -- are rather screwed by the Prophecy, which leads, of course, to the final, inevitable showdown.
Martial arts in this world are REALLY not something to laugh at. Those who master certain techniques (Frost Fist, etc) end up able to take on dozens or hundreds of lesser foes, freezing them solid, electrocuting them, burning, etc. They have power attacks that hit at range and can do damn impressive amounts of damage. Okay, we're not talking Dragonball Z here, but it's up there with Saint Seiya.
Saint Seiya keeps coming to mind when watching, too; personalities and even appearances of certain characters remind Seiya fans almost irresistably of some of the Saint Seiya characters -- there's a Shun equivalent, an Ikki equivalent, and a Shiryu equivalent. The grand finale battle, featuring Conquer (who has, naturally, not QUITE taught all his tricks to his students, and is therefore FAR more powerful than any one of them) taking on Cloud and Wind together, is one of the most impressive I've seen, especially considering this was done on a budget about 1/10 of that which Hollywood would have required to do the same thing.

Lord Conquerer gathers all the boys named Wind and Cloud and singles out the two that are strongest.

(He killed their parents because of a prophecy, etc.)  Wind and Cloud feud over Conquer's daughter and split the clan.  There's more, but I'll stop here.  High energy anime style action throughout.
I loved this movie for its creative special effects and non-stop action.  Sonny Chiba's voice is deep and resonating, he sounds great as the evil villian, a clear derivative of Darth Vader.  A box office record holder in Hong Kong, Storm Riders is a real treat.",1017446400,3,956,4.851851851851852

We watched it last night and we absolutely LOVED IT!! I think it was the BOOOMMMB movie and we love how they worked in the Anime look on some parts of the movie, but more so in the beginning and the end. Just AWESOME fighting scene's and we loved everything about it. A MUST SEE for all you martial art fans out there!!! =)",1012953600,,467,4.032258064516129
1343513,5,B00004RF3O,"Every once in a while, a film comes out of Hong Kong that reminds me of why I like Asian cinema. Storm Riders is such a movie.
While less frenetically paced than many of my earlier favorites (""Swordsman II"", ""Fong Sai Yuk"", etc.), it nonetheless has outstanding action scenes and a creative visual style. The imagery has the mythic quality that I liked in films such as ""Bride with White Hair"" and ""Zu: Warriors of the Magic Mountain"", but it has a much more solid plot, more complex characterizations, and far better special effects than those films.
I was also impressed with the special features on this DVD, which were far superior to the usual Tai Seng release, though not as good as many modern American-made DVDs. Even though I only watched a couple of them, it's refreshing to see that they made the effort to include a good variety of features.
If ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" is the only Chinese martial fantasy film you've seen, this film may not be what you're hoping for. This is not a deep character drama, though the central love triangle is well played, and the characters do have more depth to them than in most action films. Still, though, you'll enjoy the movie best if you expect a deeper-than-normal action film rather than a more-action-packed-than-normal character piece.",1012003200,15,1297,4.794642857142857
1343514,4,B00004RF3O,"This film is pretty good, the action is well done, and the special effects are good. This being said they tended to overuse the special effects. The last fight is really pretty boring with all three guys just shooting light out of thier hands, no real hand to hand combat at the end was kind of disapointing. This movie is very well put togeather, it has a good story, good special effects and the action is good as well. Overall I like this film just wish it had a little more hand to hand fighting and a little less colors shooting out of everyone's hands. People have said that the two main characters are too pretty but I believe they pull off their roles nicely as Wind and Cloud. I recomend this movie, but there are better Hong Kong action movies, like Iron Monkey, Tai Chi Master, and the Once upon a time in China series, also Fire Dragon and Dragon Inn these are all better films.",1010361600,,890,4.335329341317365
1343515,4,B00004RF3O,"This is a very good movie. If you like Anime and Kung-fu flicks, chances are you will like Storm Riders. The story was put together real well, you care about the characters, and the special effects are top notch.",1009411200,,212,4.461538461538462
1343516,3,B00004RF3O,"For a movie with such a great story and acting, I can not get past the absolutly ridiculous special effects during the fight sequences.  Instead of showing the moves of the actors, the directors place swirls of color all over the place, and the blue screen work is hideous.  It appears as if they tried to cram as much special effects as they could.  I love high flying wire work, and all facets of fantasy martial arts fighting, but the fight scenes looked like a jumble of color rather than fight scenes.  This movie is however worth watching for the wonderful storyline.  It is both cool and moving.  The acting is also top notch.  While the fight scenes come close to ruining this great movie, they don't go that far.  I would still recommend this movie to any fan of the genre.",1005782400,,782,4.457746478873239
1343517,1,B00004RF3O,"When I saw The Storm Riders in the local video shop, I thought I was in for a treat.  Well, if I got a treat, it was the kind you hear all about in Hallowe'en urban legends.  I think I got the apple with the razor blade inside.  Some treat....
I was under the decidedly mistaken impression I would be getting a martial arts flick.  Sure, I figured there'd be some augmentation with wires and such, but at no point did I expect the parody of a fantasy flick this ended up as.  However, even if I had gone in expecting a noncombative fantasy movie, I still would have been disappointed.
At no point during this movie was I impressed.  I think even the Dungeons and Dragons movie was better fantasy, and you know just how bad that is!  The effects are silly (the bad guy kills people with magical soap bubbles), the acting is atrocious, and the storyline is the same hackneyed plot that's been sifting down through schlocky fantasy books/anime for decades.  I kept hoping for something terrible to befall the female love interest.  I kept hoping for scenes involving tentacles a la The Legend of the Overfiend.  This would have been the movie's saving grace, a fall into badness so extreme that it would have achieved the ranks of high comedy.
Alas, it was not to be.

If you're looking for a good Chinese fantasy movie, do not watch this abomination.  Blech!  Get Iron Monkey, Once Upon a Time in China, or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon instead.",1003795200,2,1449,4.509578544061303
1343518,5,B00004RF3O,"A quick glance at the reviews shows that people either love or hate this movie.  I found it one of the most entertaining films I've seen in ages -- spectacular special effects, terrific cast, fights quite entertaining and an interesting plot with revenge, moral struggles, good and evil, romance, eye candy both male and female, as well as the sets, the special effects, the utterly historically inaccurate but fun costumes.  (""We come from the Heavy Metal dynasty of Ancient Chinese history."")  Unlike many of the film's detractors, I'm not a kung fu purist.  While the quality of HK fight scenes, whether kung fu, swordplay, or gunfire, has ruined me for action scenes in American films, I'm watching for plot, spectacle and entertainment value too.  If you want entertainment, if you want something fresh and original, if you want a plot that's got lots of action but isn't based solely around action, check it out.  If you loved Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and are willing to give something with less depth a chance, then you should love this film.  (And, okay, Ekin Cheng and Aaron Kwok are just *lovely* to look at, in their Ancient Chinese leather outfits and with their rock-star hair.)  I've found it quite rewatchable, too.",1003795200,,1236,4.908653846153846

1343522,5,B00004RF3O,"Those of you who gave low ratings because the film did not resemble ""traditional"" hong kong kung fu shows obviously are not old enough to remember or have ever seen the original shows in black and white tv. Yes black and white!
Storm Riders really brings back memories of those original shows where mythical heros cast supernatural weapons and creatures from their palms that dueled to the death. Back then some poor guy had to paint on the film negatives!
In Storm Riders the same story themes are intact. Everything has just been updated with wonderfully overdone computer graphics! Yes some of it does look a bit Xena-like. But American movies still don't have the same timing as Hong Kong movies, even in the use of special effects.
I saw this movie originally on VCD and now more recently on DVD and I have to say I enjoyed it even more the second time. I wish that it were in Cantonese so that I can understand it without having to read subtitles.
In some ways this film is like Crouching Tiger. Crouching Tiger also carried the same mythical themes as those old b/w shows but for some reason, whereas Storm Riders feels like the original oldies, Crouching Tiger looks like a yuppified StarBucks coffee version of them.",999216000,,1225,4.649769585253456
1343523,3,B00004RF3O,"Maybe I was expecting too much from Storm Riders.  I expected serious Kung-Fu action, a fast paced story and some killer visual FX.  The film is two plus hours but could be cut down to an hour and a half.  Like most Kung-Fu films, the first hour is mostly unnecessary exposition, but unlike most Kung-Fu films, we are not treated to any decent fights sequences.  When the fights do start to break out they are few and far between, relying more on 'Hercules/Xena' style Special FX than fight choreography. That is not to say that what is there isn't good, it is.  It is the closest I have seen to Tekken style live action fighting. Water attacks, force bubbles, drilling a person into the ground, its all there. Unfortunately, the fights only last about 45 seconds.

If you want good quality HK movies, try A Chinese Ghost Story, Bride With White Hair, Time & Tide, Iron Monkey, Comet Butterfly & Sword, but be warned, stay clear of the Storm Riders....",995932800,,467,4.284090909090909
1343525,5,B00004RF3O,"""The Storm Riders"" (also known as ""Wind Cloud/Fong Wan/Fong Yreen"") is the top-grossing movie in Hong Kong cinematic history. For those who underestimate HK cinema, watch this movie - it WILL prove you wrong.
With Asia's top entertainers giving amazing performances, Aaron Kwok, Ekin Cheng, Xiu Chi, and Cristy please audiences all around the world. The film includes fantasy, dramatic kung-fu closeups (sometimes a bit too much), and emphasizes a lot on a big part of Chinese culture - honor... face... reputation... vengeance. Not to mention creativity and some very touching scenes.
Aaron Kwok (left of cover) plays ""Wan/Yreen/Cloud"" as a very emotional character that many can relate to. Although Ekin Cheng (right of cover), who played ""Fong/Wind"", also gave a wonderful performance, the movie mostly centered itself on Cloud's character. The highlights of the movie were given by Sonny Chiba and Heavenly King Aaron Kwok. (That's a true title, for those who aren't familiar with Hong Kong entertainment.)
If you're sick of a typical kung-fu movie or Hollywood hit and are looking for something new, ""The Storm Riders"" will satisfy you with a mix of fantasy, special effects, impressive directing, great sound, some romance, and a wonderful story.
It is also recommended to watch the sequel of this movie, however Heavenly King Aaron Kwok turned down the offer to play Cloud again. The prequel of ""The Storm Riders"", ""A Man Called Hero"" is NOT WORTH WATCHING. - Priscilla",993686400,,1476,5.179916317991632
1343526,4,B00004RF3O,"With the GOOD & BAD reviews, I would have to agree with both agruments ... but STORM RIDERS is definately worth watching!!!  A fantasic, brilliant story with limited fighting ... STORM RIDERS I believe lives up to it's hype!  Story is easy to follow, good story indeed, compared to others of its kind. The CGI effects were spectacular, but it was confusing in one or two areas only!  It was fun, interesting, and most important ... it kept you glued to the screen.
The VHS edition is a 90 min. film vs. DVDs 128 min.  -- your missing out on many deleted scenes watching the VHS edition.
IMPORTANT : The VHS has ENGLISH DUBBING - if you hate to read.  The DVD does not!!!

Add to that bunch of flying Kung Fu / sword fights, melodrama, a love triangle, magic monkey, posessed arm, winding plot, some beautiful scenery, and you get a movie that works, feels, and as imaginative as comic books can get.  Characters are well-done  and although the plot is a bit convoluted (but hey, it IS from a comic), the movie continues to remain energetic and exciting. As kung fu fantasy movies go, the bigger-budget computerized visual effects are very well-done, one of the most stylish and creative I've seen, as it also opens up newer possibilities in action choreography.  But other than that, it is always more fun to see non-Hollywood films handle computer technology (let's face it, Hollywood films only use it for explosions or morphing nowadays, no flying speed-kicks or multi-fist attacks).  Nevertheless, the visuals and the audio are excellent and of course, a very entertaining (and stylish) flick.  (Plenty action, less serious than ""Crouching Tiger.""
