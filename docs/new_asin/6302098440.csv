421329,4,6302098440,"Robert Wagner stars as a young Scandian prince in exile whose quest to win back his father's throne leads him to King Arthur's court and the arms of beautiful Princess Aleta in this extremely well-made and enchanting 1954 adaptation of the famous comic strip character.  A delightful mix of adventure, comedy, romance, and royal intrigue, Prince Valiant is brought to life by a marvelous cast (Wagner as the titular young knight; Janet Leigh as his lady Aleta; James Mason as the traitorous Black Knight; and Sterling Hayden as Val's mentor, Sir Gawain) from a heady script by Dudley Nichols and the exhuberant direction of Henry Hathaway.  Non-stop fun right up to the amazing trial by combat at the end (one of the best sword fights ever filmed), Prince Valiant is a first class family film that everyone can enjoy.",1023148800,14,817,4.870503597122302
421330,5,6302098440,This movie has the best sword fight ever staged. I saw it years ago on T.V. and I never forgot it. The price of the video is worth it just for the sword fight.,993859200,3,159,3.7058823529411766
421331,4,6302098440,"Absolutely not historically defensible in any sense, but a first class 20th Century Fox foray into the world of King Arthur and his Viking foes.  A youthful Robert Wagner wins the double whammy. He becomes a knight after  killing King Arthur's treacherous enemy in single combat whilst also  regaining the throne of Scandia for his family.  The triumph of good over  evil is personified by the victory of Christianity over paganism.  What  makes this film a ""must"" is the music of Franz Waxman who  captures all the contrasting moods from humor to tragedy and from disaster  to triumph. The attack on Slygon's fortress is unique in movie history as  both sides get drenched with inflammable liquid released from pig skins.  Barricade the gates!",956966400,10,744,4.967479674796748

Half the cast are fine British thespians like James Mason, the other half are Americans who'd be more at home in a film noir, not a classic period piece. They blunder through the film like loggers attempting Shakespeare.
Wagner is as usual about as convincing as a cigar store indian. The formidable Sterling Haden is simply miscast.

421577,4,6302098440,I love this movie. Saw it when I was much younger and had to wait a long time to buy it here. For those of you who want realism this is not for you. This was made for those of us who read the comic strip. Robert Wagner is excellent as the young prince; Janet Leigh lovely as ever and James Mason the perfect villain.

421578,4,6302098440,"This is another American movie not released in America (USA)!!! So sad that FOX won't release these great old movies in the USA.Thanks to Eureka in UK for releasing several old period classics. Prince Valliant has not been restored so there are artifax and the last reels were in better shape than the start of the movie (kind of blurry fades).Overall this is an excellent print and much better than the DVD released by FOX.This version is REGION FREE and will play all over the world. Also this is in Super Cinemascope!!!! Which is 255.1 aspect ratio!!! Cinemascope is usually 235.1. Not many movies were released in this super wide format ( the King and I + Guys & Dolls ) so it's a treat to see it. The colors are beautiful Technicolor and real stereophonic sound. Fox used to put microphones across the stage left to right. When an actor would move from one side to the other his voice would come from wherever he was positioned. Today all dialogue comes from the center speaker. This was better!
If you love old movies from the 50's then you'll love this and it's family friendly,a ""good"" vs. ""evil"" story from the knights of the roundtable! Yay!!!",1462147200,9,1153,4.601941747572815

The movie itself is quite fun and ranks 3 to 4 stars.

421704,3,6302098440,"I had high hopes for this movie.  However the reality is the dialogue, acting and story line are all uninspired.  It does end with quite a stirring Broad Sword fight.  This in itself is worth watching for if you are a fan; as am i, of video sword fighting (my two personal favorites are found in, The Mark of Zorro and Scaramouche).  Even being a noteworthy fight itself it was not worth the hour and forty plus minutes of mush. It is the long periods of silence; while riding a horse, SUP'ing down or up river (this is but a geographic quibble)

The second (and third) items of note are the costumes and sets (settings) are very well effected.  It is easy to tell who is, THE KING and who is the king (with the starter castle complete with lovely gardens for wooing and romancing).  As this act has never aligned with this type of setting personally i find it difficult to relate and as the ""concealed"" romance involved never has the true feel of dangerous-love and therefor feels silly.",1417737600,,988,4.455555555555556

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Prince Valiant is a 1954 adventure film in Technicolor and Cinemascope, based on the comic strip of the same name by Hal Foster. A young man seeks to join the Knights of the Round Table in order to restore his father to his own kingship, and uncovers a plot against King Arthur.

In this adventure and romantic Prince Valiant is the long running popular comic strip of the same name, comes to life in this colourful, lively production mounted by 20th Century Fox. In it, a very young Robert Wagner plays the title character, son of the King of Scandia during the time of King Arthur [Brian Aherne]. With his family living in exile after his father's throne is forcefully taken, Prince Valiant (also known as ""Val"") travels to Camelot to seek help from King Arthur. When he gets wind of plans by the evil Black Knight to overthrow Arthur's kingdom, Val prepares for a to-the-death battle under the tutelage of the famous Knights of the Round Table. Co-starring James Mason as the duplicitous Sir Brack, Sterling Hayden as the virtuous Sir Gawain, and Janet Leigh as Val's beautiful love interest Aleta, Prince Valiant is a colourful trip back to the Middle Ages as only Hollywood can do it.

Based on Hal Foster's comic strip Prince Valiant and is about a young Viking prince who seeks to become one of King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table, after traveling to Camelot from his native Scandia when his father is removed from the throne by a pagan who has no business taking his place. Meanwhile, the illegitimate Viking king is plotting with a mysterious Black Knight to overthrow King Arthur.

Screenwriter Dudley Nichols for Stagecoach [1939] and For Whom the Bell Tolls [1943] wrote the screenplay based on the King in the features syndicate's Prince Valiant comic strip originally created by Harold Foster. First appearing in newspapers in 1937, Harold Foster wrote and illustrated the strip until 1971. Since then Prince Valiant has remained in circulation to this day, having been continued under the hand-picked talents of artists John Cullen Murphy and Gary Gianni.

Henry Hathaway was never really much of a director, let's be honest, he focused mainly on action films that were average at best, sans a few exceptions like the flame-throwing Richard Burton vehicle Raid on Rommel, which I still enjoy to this day as a fun little desert rats movie, but still, he wasn't overly impressive in his career, and with efforts like Prince Valiant you can see why. Though he is not entirely at fault as he had to work with a terrible script somehow penned by an Oscar winner, and direct a couple of actors who give the worst performances of their lives, namely Sterling Hayden.

Although it has the eye candy of Janet Leigh and Debra Paget, the film is a bit of bore. It's slow and nothing particularly exciting happens until after the first hour clocks in. It's book-ended by a pretty impressive battle at a castle and a duel between Prince Valiant and the Black Knight, who is revealed to be someone all too close to Arthur, but other than that it's a flat film. There isn't enough action for it to simply be a fun film and it's all too serious and at least it tries to be, following a mediocre script.

Prince Valiant is truly an old fashioned adventure and romantic film, one full of predictable twists and hilarious clichs. It is well paced, but at times also a bit too focused on details that are of little importance, if any at all. Franz Waxman's symphonic score, however, is terrific. The acting is pleasing. Robert Wagner, Janet Leigh, James Mason and especially Sterling Hayden do an admirable job of keeping the film as fresh as possible. Hayden's witty one-liners, in particular, are terrific. There are also a couple of surprisingly edgy jokes that work quite well and of course makes for a jolly good enjoyable romp through the Knights of the Round Table and made you want to be there enjoying everything you view.

According to Robert Wagner's co-star Janet Leigh, her film star husband at the time, Tony Curtis, had wanted to play Prince Valiant and was disappointed when he lost the role. Janet Leigh, however, was happy to be working with Robert Wagner and described him in her 1984 autobiography There Really Was a Hollywood as ""probably one of the nicest human beings in this, or any, city. Well-mannered, straightforward, humorous, eager, he good-naturedly submitted to the indignity of being with the ladies in the hair department every morning to don his Prince Valiant pageboy wig.""

Janet Leigh remembered director Henry Hathaway as ""an excellent director, a charming host, and a good friend,"" but he was also someone who ""enjoyed being mischievous, goading someone, baiting, to get a reaction."" Hathaway often grumbled about having to wait on hair and makeup people to work their magic on Leigh and co-star Debra Paget, according to Leigh, and he could be particularly hard on Robert Wagner. ""My deduction,"" said Janet Leigh, ""was that Henry Hathawat ragged R.J. [Robert Wagner's nickname to friends] a bit much. But on reflection, I decided he was really helping him, protecting him, tugging on every string, pulling out all stops, making him better than he thought he was. Because R.J. was young, relatively inexperienced, and his was the demanding, pivotal role.""

Prince Valiant was given a grand premiere at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood when it opened in the Spring of 1954. It went on to be a respectable hit with the support of mostly favourable reviews. The New York Times called it a ""lively adventure"", Variety praised the ""imaginative"" action and the ""dazzling"" settings, and Time magazine said, ""Producer Robert L. Jacks and Director Henry Hathaway have not only matched the museum-copied look of the well-known Sunday Viking and his cohorts; they have caught the panel's inner mood of stilted boyhood reverie as well.""

Blu-ray Video Quality  Presented in its original aspect ratio of 2.55:1, and given an awesome 1080p encoded image transfer, Henry Hathaway's Prince Valiant arrives on Blu-ray courtesy of the British distributors Eureka Entertainment. Fine object detail and contrast vary quite a bit. Clarity is also fairly consistent, especially during the indoor scenes. There are a variety of colour pulsations that I noticed throughout the entire film as well. Some of the outdoor scenes tend to look pale, with blacks, greens, blues, reds, and browns being fairly unconvincing. There are also a couple of transition issues. Finally, I detected a few minor flecks and scratches popping up here and there. The good news is that there are no traces of heavy noise filtering. Healthy film grain is easily noticeable during a number of scenes. Many of the outdoor close-ups, for example, look quite good. All in all, there are some issues with the presentation, but I must say that this is definitely the best Prince Valiant has ever looked. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  There is only one audio track on this Blu-ray disc and that is 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio. For the record, Eureka Entertainment has provided an optional English SDH subtitles for the main feature. When turned on, they appear outside of the image frame. This is a competent audio track. The sound is clean and mostly stable. The dynamic amplitude is also pleasing. The dialog is crisp and clean. There are no serious balance issues with Franz Waxman's symphonic score either with the strings and brass are both convincing. But aside from some extremely mild background noise, I did not detect any disturbing pops, cracks, or dropouts to report in this Blu-ray review.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Theatrical Trailer: The only supplemental feature on this Blu-ray disc is the film's Original Theatrical Trailer.

Finally, I hope we see more of these budget releases from Eureka Entertainment in the future, as I believe that it is the only way forgotten gems such as Henry Hathaway's Prince Valiant could see the light of day. I never saw this film when it came out or whether it was released onto the inferior DVD format, but I am so glad I have now have it in the ultimate Blu-ray format, as it was truly an enjoyable film and now it is pride of place in my Blu-ray Collection. The other reason I purchased this Blu-ray disc, is because it was also very attractively priced. Highly Recommended!

421803,5,6302098440,"In the 1930s there was a wonderful comic strip-------Flash Gordon.
It probably wasn't intellectual, but like many things in Pop culture, seemed to have an inner meaning; it was also escapist in an era when guys leaving for Work in the morning had lots to escape from and could briefly do this in the funny papers.
They made it into a movie with Buster Crabbe and music recycled from earlier Universal Sci fi films, composed by Franz Waxman and Karl Hajos et al.
There was another, some think similar comic strip---Prince Valiant. It had a science fiction dimension in that Valiant fought Dragons
( Giant Saltwater Crocodiles?) ,and also had a sweep and Beauty that doesn't seem possible in a comic strip. The Artwork was often one big Frame with elaborately detailed warriors and castles. Boys read it on the living room floor in the 1930s.
In the 50s, when these boys had come back from WWII and the USA was an amazingly powerfull and admired nation, they made
it into a Cinemascope movie, with symphonic music by Franz Waxman. Robert Wagner had a lot of the energy and exhuberence
that Buster Crabbe had had in ""Flash,"" even old Victor Mclaglen had some of the Old Sidekick quality of Frank Shannon as Dr.
Zarkov. In Europe, particularly in Germany ( where the comic strip was called ""Prinz Eisenherz"" ), there was a fascination with the
Americanism and enthusiasm of the story, and with the theme of ""Saxon"" heroes ( i.e. the Anglo-Saxon knights of King Arthur )
fighting the barbarians of the north ( they were ""pagans"", not commies ).
The Big Picture cinematography effectively made sophisticated criticism seem petty. The sparkling Music, the sweep and Beauty
said that complex analysis was irrelevant. And the energy and optimism of the story said that anything was possible for a brave
young warrior with a magic sword.",1395964800,,1827,4.803174603174603

James Mason makes the movie a classic; he should have won an Oscar, just like Steven Boyd should have for Ben-Hur.

The outstanding musical score by Franz Waxman is riveting and inviting.  Janet Leigh, like James Mason, carries each scene she is in.  Robert Wagner gives a great performance, as does everyone in the film.

I make Indie movies (""Sisters Go Ye Trailer 2"" on Youtube), so I really appreciate the high bar the music score carries, and also the framing of the shots from the different scenes; the lighting and use of color is also high caliber.

I was 13 when it was released in theaters. All I saw was the grand spectacle, the pagentry, heroism, valor and romance. Even the sets and costumes seemed magical. It never occurred to me to draw any comparisons to the comic strip. I was just enraptured and entertained. The film was hokey, poorly written and the casting was suspect. Sterling Hayden overacted as Gawain: it was almost like he was shouting most of the time. James Mason was the only member of the cast who turned in a credible performance. Janet Leigh and Debra Paget were good in supporting roles. Victor Mc Loglan as Boltar was simply terrible. Even Robert Wagner as Valiant seemed to be contrived at times.  But with all it's short comings when I was thirteen years old it was quite possiblt the greatest adventure film I had ever seen. This film, unlike any other, was able to transport me back to 1954.

421949,4,6302098440,"The 1954 version of ""Prince Valiant"" is one of my all-time favorite movies.  Of course, it's not historically accurate, Vikings did not wear horns in their helmets and if ""King Arthur"" existed at all he was a 5th century Roman-Celtic chieftain without 14th century armor and elaborate castles.  Arthur was  fighting off Angle, Saxon and Jute invaders from northern Germany and southern Denmark, not Vikings.  The Vikings didn't start raiding England until the late 8th century CE.

That being said, I'm glad there were changes made in the movie that did upset some purist ""Prince Valiant"" comics fans.  I'm glad Prince Valiant's homeland was changed from ""Thule"" to ""Scandia"" which was an actual region in southern Sweden.  Also having his mother still living was a plus.

Victor McLaughlin was magnificent as the Viking friend to Prince Valiant (Boltar).  And the music by Franz Waxman is perhaps the best musical score ever used in a medieval movie.  My favorite part of the epic was the battle of Scandia at the end where the Christian Vikings attack Sligon's pagan stronghold to free Prince Valiant and his family and restore the Christian faith.

The only reason I gave this movie four stars instead of five, was because of the jump the movie makes after Sligon is overthrown, the movie suddenly shifts back to Camelot.  There is no interim to celebrate Aguar's restoration as king of Scandia and Prince Valiant suddenly appears in King Arthur's court clothed in a knight's wardrobe wanting to fight Sir Brack.  I had hoped that maybe the DVD had contained some lost scenes that had never made it to TV, but unfortunately I was wrong.

But still, I recommend this great movie to all ages.  And by all means, please avoid the wretched 1996 version of ""Prince Valiant.""  It's an insult to the original movie.",1344729600,3,1811,4.869281045751634

This is a wonderful movie I remember from childhood. It contrasts with the dark, profane, anti-hero garbage produced today by Hollywierd. This movie is bright, colorful with wonderful costumes and sets. I am struck by how good these old films truly are. Robert Wagner does a fair job of Valiant, Sterling Hayden is excellent as the veteran knight Gawain and James Mason gives a veteran performance in the role of the traitorous Sir Brak.

This is the story of a young prince of Scandia living in exile who journeys to King Arthur's court in Camelot. Prince Valiant wishes to become a knight of the Round Table so he can help his father retake his throne in Scandia. Along the way, he is befriended and mentored by Sir Gawain, foremost knight of the Round Table. He is caught up in the treason of Sir Brak who masquerades as the ""Black Knight"" intent on usurping King Arthur and making common cause with the Vikings who deposed Valiant's father.

There's lots of adventure, swordplay, battles, romance and honor to go around and a good time will be had by all who watch this great old film! I recommend this DVD with five stars!",1339891200,,1314,4.7043478260869565
421984,2,6302098440,"This is right out of the Sunday Comics. The dialogue is so artificial you can almost see the word balloons. If they'd gone just a little further, it would qualify as camp.

Seriously: the plot is so obvious, you know who the mysterious Black Knight is long before anyone in the movie does. The mix-up between which sister loves which knight is projected like a grade school punch line. When Sir Gawain (Sterling Hayden) is in bed with a serious injury and it is announced that the winner of the tournament will win the hand of Princess Aleta (Janet Leigh), it doesn't take rocket science to figure out that it is Prince Valiant (Robert Wagner) in Gawain's armor that challenges Sir Brack (James Mason).

One other element that may be OK for some, but grated on my nerves, is the religious assumptions underlying it all. The villains are Viking pagans, and the heroes are English Christians. The Viking Christians, on the other hand are also heroes. The bigotry is pretty obvious, but in 1954 it was simply taken for granted.

Good movie for children, but children these days have probably never read Prince Valiant cartoons in the Sunday Comics. I was still a child myself in 1954, so I suppose we have to assume this was made for the Baby Boom generation. I never saw it then, though; stories with swords and fighting in them to this extent would have been for boys.",1336780800,2,1367,4.617283950617284

421986,3,6302098440,"Prince Valiant is hokum pure and simple, but it's superior hokum thanks to lavish production values, sterling smooth villainy from James Mason and the odd moment of directorial panache from the undervalued Henry Hathaway. Infamous for Robert Wagner's tragic hairstyle - though if you think his Louis Brooks wig is bad, wait until you see Victor McLaglen's pigtails - the star's athleticism is more impressive than his acting as the exiled Viking prince trying to win his spurs in Camelot, the hand of Janet Leigh's Princess and win back his father's kingdom while he's at it. Sterling Hayden's Sir Gawain may be even more miscast than Wagner but he's clearly enjoying himself far too much for that ever to be a problem, which is pretty much the order of the day here. It may tread a familiar path but it ends up being great fun and exactly what it sets out to be - a colourful comic strip movie in glorious CinemaScope, with all he broad strokes and colourful silliness that implies (the Vikings must have used Texas Longhorns brought back by Leif Ericson for their helmets!), mounted with a big enough budget to enable Hathaway to stage a few big action scenes and throw in a few simple but impressive stunts inbetween while Franz Waxman's vividly exuberant score lifts the picture to another level.

Eureka's UK Masters of Cinema Blu-ray is wildly inconsistent: some shots are wonderfully vivid and pin-sharp, others short on detail and subject to colour fluctuation and pulsing, with the grading inconsistently moving from overcast to clear from shot-to-shot in some scenes (most notably the exteriors). This is down in large part to the limitations of the early CinemaScope lenses, which required more light and often lost detail (the lap-dissolves from scene-to-scene show massive deterioration in quality as was commonplace with optical printer work in the 50s and 60s), and partially down to the film not going through any kind of serious restoration, but it's still a massive improvement on the previous DVD issue from Fox themselves, though it's a shame the only extra is the wonderfully over the top trailer pushing the miracle of CinemaScope - `You see it without special glasses' - almost as much as the film itself. Fox's 2.55:1 NTSC DVD releae does a bit better in the extras department with a Movietone newsreel extract, original theatrical trailer and trailers for The Black Swan, A High Wind in Jamaica, Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World and Pirates of Tortuga, but has inferior picture quality.",1332806400,5,2527,4.931924882629108

421988,5,6302098440,"The movie: I saw this one in its initial release. Our entire grade school walked to our local (single-screen) movie theater to see it on a field trip and loved it! This was back in the golden era of the Sunday comic strips when each installment of Hal Foster's strip was eagerly awaited by the nation at large. Foster is reported to have been disappointed by the film. The film took some liberties but overall remains true to the spirit of the original Foster characters and stories. Modern day audiences are used to a different style of actors and action and may find themselves restless. Director Henry Hathaway keeps things moving. Franz Waxman's score is first rate! -- I wish it was presented on its own isolated track. The entire cast is quite good with James Mason the standout actor here. Whether deliberate or not, there is some overacting in the lead characters and some of the wigs are a bit much but all is forgiven as the story moves forward nicely. This film delivers the goods on its own terms. For what it is, it's quite good -- fun and enjoyable for the whole family.

The disc: This Eureaka Blu-ray release is region free. The Blu-ray video and audio quality varies but mostly very good. *Way far better* than the the previous DVD release and leaves both LaserDisc and VHS releases in the dark ages. Is it perfect? Not by a long shot. I read somewhere, but cannot substantiate, that this is the first CinemaScope (widescreen) film that went into production -- ""The Robe"", a more prestigious production, was released first. Budget and film stock were not the greatest in the early Fox widescreen 1950s. Stereophonic sound was still new in theaters. The sound stage here is all up front with nice directional touches. This film *needs* and *deserves* a full restoration. Fox released a DVD long after that format's inception. I only hope they'll get around to a full restoration and studio Blu-ray release much sooner. Until then, this is the best ""Prince Valiant"" has looked and sounded on home video. A keeper.

The extras: Well, aside from a trailer, nada. Darn.

I purchased the Black Shield of Falworth issed by Eureka and now that I've seen a second example of their product quality, I have to say that they have an excellent offering here and look forward to more titles.

422035,3,6302098440,"Full of colour and pageantry, 1954's PRINCE VALIANT stars Robert Wagner (wearing a dutch-boy wig) in the title role plus lovely Janet Leigh as his lady fair.

Dethroned and exiled to a secret location with his parents, Prince Valiant (Robert Wagner) decides to travel to Camelot in an attempt to become one of the mythical Knights of the Round Table.  There, he becomes squire to Sir Gawain (Sterling Hayden); but soon becomes suspicious of fellow knight Sir Brack (James Mason), who harbours a plan to usurp King Arthur (Brian Aherne), and also holds a powerful position with the despot who stole Valiant's own throne.  Naturally, along the way, there's room for romance with lovely Princess Aleta (Janet Leigh) and her younger sister Ilene (Debra Paget).

Based on the popular King Features comic strip, PRINCE VALIANT is a colourful adventure romp.  Composer Franz Waxman's musical score swells amidst the clash of swords and the clatter of jousting knights.  It's a real Saturday matinee classic.  The performances are fine overall; Robert Wagner's only real drawback is his solid mid-American accent (which he does little to disguise).  One even becomes used to his dutch-cut wig after a while.  Janet Leigh was well-versed in playing medieval damsels in 1954; in the same year she also starred opposite her real-life husband Tony Curtis in ""The Black Shield of Falworth"".

The big problem is with the script. This film has a great cast but only James Mason seems capable of doing anything with his lines - but being the villain he had a huge advantage. The characters are woefully undeveloped. This is particularly striking if one compares the film to its comic strip origins. I'm not one to complain about a film taking liberties with its sources but what purpose is served by transforming Aleta from a complex and capable, but stunningly feminine woman to a one dimensional damsel in distress? A minor but not horribly distracting problem is that Robert Wagner and Janet Leigh were a little old for their parts.

Physically it seems that very little restoration was done with this film and there were places that could have used it. Extras are few. A Movietone news short, a theatrical trailer, and some promos for other Fox DVDs.

The plot is straight forward.  Valiant's father lost his kingdom to the evil pagan Vikings.  He and his family are in hiding in King Arthur's England.  Valiant is sent to court to become a knight.  He befriends and becomes the squire of Sir Gawain.  Through his own pig headed stupidity he screws-up everything he touches (romance, friendship, being a squire, etc.) until he finds out that there is a traitor in Arthur's court and the traitor has delivered Valiant's family to the Vikings.  Valiant saves the day and all is forgiven.

As much as I wanted to love this movie, I couldn't.  The action scenes are well done and the castles and costumes are fine.  Unfortunately, the plot, dialogue, acting, etc, all were sub par.  The quality of the acting is particularly disappointing given the cast, all of whom are fine actors.  The fact that the language and dialogue all sounded more ""1950s malt shop"" than medieval was certainly part of the problem.  (The actors at your local Renaissance Festival all sound better than the one's in this movie . . . and given the quality of ""accents and acting"" at Renaissance Festivals, that's saying something.)

422136,5,6302098440,"As an art student, interested primarily in life drawing and composition and painting, the cartoon art of Illustrator Hal Foster was necessary study. In 1954 amidst the swarming of resurgence of Swashbucklers, and knight's in training films, came PRINCE VALIANT by Director Henry Hathaway.

The film is ablaze with color, adventure, courageous uphill battles by the just against the Imperial evils we know so well these days, and what a cast! James Mason as the well named, evil Sir Brack, and a young Robert Wagner, as Valiant the Scandinavian Super Hero, Sir Gawain, played by Sterling Hayden, the irrepressible Yachtsman back from another trip abroad with his son and eager to make some money for his next foray into the South seas, trying hard to be anything but a cowboy or a gangster, Brian Ahern as King Arthur, Janet Leigh, bursting out of her gowns and as gorgeous as possible in her youthful perfection of face and form, Debra Paget, as her lovely sister Ilene, all supported by Victor Mclaglen, Donald Crisp, Barry Jones, Mary phillips, Nevile Brand, Tom Conway, Sammy Ogg, Howard Wendle and many other character actors give the film a festive sparkle of color, contrast and spectacle worthy of Dean Cornwell or Frank Brangwyn paintings, still popular in that era of the 1950's at least among art students, lik me.

If adventure, without CSI Miami gore, is something you enjoy, this is a primer in good versus evil. Here, though not nearly of Academy Award quality, is good, clean, honest adventure of the sort that helped boys grow into altruistic men, something lacking in today's choices for young people, There is no eye-covering horror here, simply swashbuckling joy for boys, girls and for most parents, who spurn the kind of filth that is marketed now to the young of age or heart.

A lost Kingdom regained, a lost love rescued, a lost family of men at arms bonded and rejoined in hand-to-hand battle. For sheer splashes of costumed elegance, clanging, clashing, swordplay, this ranks close to the Errol Flynn/Raphael Sabatini favorites.

I recall waiting expectantly as a boy for the Singing Sword to hum its tune in full battle and I was not disappointed. The scoring of this film by Franz Waxman is OUTSTANDING and still sells well today on screen.

This is the pattern along with the Saturday morning serials from which Captain Comeback films like STAR WARS were derived.

It still has the action and large-horn helmeted Vikings to enchant the child that remains in a person of those times. But the film also seems to indicate that its intent was also part of a message in favor of the blacklisting and witch hunts of those times, as it repeatedly makes reference to Christians against heathens. At the same time, such battles were going on in Europe around the time of King Arthur, certainly they were a part of the literature of the times of early Arthurian legend.

422142,4,6302098440,"Director, Henry Hathaway's film version of cartoonist, Hal Foster's Scandinavian hero, ""Prince Valiant"" is one of those over-blown, wacky-tacky epics that is impossible to take seriously, but so much fun to watch. Robert Wagner is the rather effeminate looking title character who takes Camelot by storm. Determined to regain his own throne, Valiant uncovers the treachery of the Black Knight (James Mason, in a toss away role) and challenges him. Of course, there's also time for love with bombshell, Princess Aleta (Janet Leigh - who quite often found herself squeezed into a corset during her 1950s film tenure.) The film veers between comic book pulp and self-conscious seriousness, but Hathaway's direction ensures that neither become the vice to sink his epic. Brian Aherne (as a credible King Arthur)and Sterling Hayden (a not so credible, Sir Gawain) costar.
THE TRANSFER: Pretty good. Colors are generally bold, vibrant and well balanced. Flesh tones seem a bit pasty but that's in keeping with early Cinemascope/Eastman color dye transfers. Shadow, contrast and black levels are generally solid. Rear projection photography is more obvious than it should be. Pixelization and edge enhancement are present but do not terribly distract. The audio is 5.1, delivering a nice spread in the music tracks. Dialogue is not natural sounding, but again, this was usually to be expected for the vintage of the film.
EXTRAS: Sorry. Nothing but the film.
BOTTOM LINE: This prince is worth a second glance, but its not quite as glamorous as, say ""Scaramouche"" so much as it belongs as the bottom half of a double bill at your old-time drive in.",1109980800,6,1640,5.146067415730337

422176,4,6302098440,"Before the youthful Luke Skywalker learned to be a Jedi Knight, the youthful Prince Valiant learned to be a knight in King Arthur's court.  Hal Foster's Sunday comic strip was a logical story to bring to the screen, in the wake of MGM's ""Ivanhoe"" and ""Knights of the Round Table"", when ""sword epics"" were getting their second wind.

As a film, ""Prince Valiant"" works rather well on several fronts, although there are a couple of minor drawbacks.  One is the casting of Sterling Hayden as Sir Gawain, a role that should have brought more of a combination of heroic ego and a bit of comic relief.  Another bit of questionable casting is that of Victor McLaglen as the leader of the Christian Vikings.  He's barely recognizable behind that beard, but the moment when he first opens his mouth - and that Irish brogue spills forth - will lift a few eyebrows.  The Vikings are all stereotypes, of course, complete with horned helmets and burly beards.  In fact, when shown as a group, they look like a cattle call for mascot auditions at a Minnesota football game.

But the positive aspects of this movie rule the day.  James Mason makes a fine villain, just the kind everyone would ""love to hate"".  My guess is that 1954 must have been Mason's year.  Besides ""Prince Valiant"", he starred opposite Judy Garland in ""A Star is Born"", and created perhaps his greatest role, that of Captain Nemo in Disney's ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"".  Robert Wagner as Valiant is on shaky ground at the film's start, but he proves himself at the end.  The late Janet Leigh makes a most beautiful ""damsel in distress"", and the almost overlooked Debra Paget matches Leigh's beauty in the role of her sister.  The final, climactic sword duel must rank in excitement with the ones in ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" and the more recent ""Rob Roy"".

Franz Waxman's score is one of his finest in a long career, full of melody and swagger.  If the exhuberant opening main title music doesn't positively lift you out of your seat, I suggest you make an appointment for an MRI.

The print is fine, with lively color to go with the always slightly defocused Cinemascope image (Technirama and Panavision would later prove to be far better in both picture and sound).  Overall, a very good piece of entertainment, guaranteed to send a rush.",1097625600,31,2305,4.67741935483871
422177,4,6302098440,"This film is a pure joy to behold!  The sets, costumes and even the cast have been made to resemble Hal Foster's comic strip as much as was humanly possible! Being an enthusiastic Prince Valiant reader I was stunned one Thanksgiving when I was around 10 or so as the special Hallmark Hall of Fame Movie turned out to be Prince Valiant.  I watched in utter amazement as the vibrantly colorful,action-filled film presented itself as a visually stunning and faithful rendition of Foster's vision. I had had no idea such a movie existed and have treasured it always. This year I am happy to say my VHS Taped copy of the film has been replaced by a fine Quality DVD purchased from amazon! I Highly recommend this film to all those who love a good, light-hearted adventure Tale!",1096761600,9,772,4.586956521739131
422178,4,6302098440,"There is such a sense of childlike wonder and fun in Henry Hathaway's 1954 Camelot tale, PRINCE VALIANT, that it's easy to forgive the obvious incongruities in accents (Robert Wagner's broad American tones...hard to believe he plays Donald Crisp's son...Sterling Hayden, looking and sounding more like Wild Bill Hickok than Sir Gawain...Victor McLaglen as the most Irish Viking you'll ever see!), and concentrate, instead, on the energy, pageantry, and sweep of Hathaway's adaptation of Hal Foster's classic comic strip.

Certainly, one would be hard-pressed to assemble a finer cast; in addition to Wagner, Hayden, McLaglen, and Crisp, you have James Mason as the villain, Sir Brack, dazzling, and far more believable than he had been as Rupert of Hentzau in MGM's remake of THE PRISONER OF ZENDA; Janet Leigh and Debra Paget, both ethereally beautiful as the sisters, Aleta and Ilene; and Brian Aherne, as King Arthur, so perfect in the role that you wish his part had been larger.

In the early 1950s, there was a resurgence of swashbuckling films in Hollywood, and a new sub-category appeared, 'Knights in Training', with Fox's PRINCE VALIANT, and Universal's THE BLACK SHIELD OF FALWORTH (starring Tony Curtis) both devoting ample screen time to the education of squires in the knightly skills of jousting and sword fighting. These scenes are great fun to watch, particularly for children (knights had to go to school, too!), and paint a far more accurate picture of the difficult work involved in mastering the required talents than did the recent film, A KNIGHT's TALE.

As we follow the adventures of the Viking Prince as he restores his kingdom, finds love, and wins a place at the Round Table, special credit must be given to Franz Waxman's spectacular music. One of the most memorable scores ever produced for a film, the theme has become a staple at the Hollywood Bowl, and for the Boston Pops. Once heard, it is not forgotten!

While the magical elements of the story are downplayed (the mystical powers of the 'Singing Sword' are more implied than actually shown), the story itself has such a sense of wonder that it isn't missed. The heroes of Camelot are all present (Arthur, Lancelot, Guinevere, Gawain, and Galahad), and the Round Table scenes are as majestic as any film has ever accomplished.

PRINCE VALIANT may not be in a league with EXCALIBUR, but it certainly holds it's own against KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE, CAMELOT, and FIRST KNIGHT, and as a family film it can't be beat!",1096329600,107,2501,4.959427207637232

422180,4,6302098440,"Released in 1954, ""Prince Valiant"" is as much fun for the whole family now as it was fifty years ago. This colourful, Cinemascope movie is a feast for the eye, and thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. You have a brave young hero to cheer for--a nasty villain to ""hiss""--action--romance--beautiful sets, locations, costumes--and Henry Hathaway's expert direction.

A very young Robert Wagner stars as ""Prince Valiant"", a Viking who wishes to become a knight in the court of King Arthur--he certainly cuts a dashing figure, once you get used to a rather outlandish, but compulsory, Prince Valiant wig ! Valiant soon finds himself involved in a treacherous plan to oust his own father, King Aguar ( laid-back, avuncular Donald Crisp ), and--zounds !--King Arthur himself ( laid-back, avuncular Brian Aherne ). Of course, our hero still finds time to fall in love with Princess Aleta ( gorgeous Janet Leigh )--not enough romance ?--well, Aleta's handmaiden, Ilene ( sultry Debra Paget ) is ""smitten"" with Valiant's mentor, Sir Gawain ( a bluff and hearty Sterling Hayden ). Stirring up the whole pot is the ambitious, unscrupulous Sir Brack ( James Mason, stealing scenes with ease ). We have a very lively jousting scene, plenty of battles, narrow escapes and other feats of ""derring do"". There is, in fact, never a dull moment ! There are more than a few ""camp"" aspects to this movie, not the least of which are those strong American accents of Mr. Wagner and, especially, Mr. Hayden. Remember ""The Black Shield of Falworth"" when Tony Curtis, in heavy Bronx accent, says "" take me to da castle of my fadda "" ? There are a few smiles like that here.

The DVD is beautiful--you will be hard pressed to find many films more colourful than this lovely Cinemascope gem from Fox. Extras are sparse--a few trailers and a brief promotional clip from the fifties. Some comments from Robert Wagner would have been fun--fifty years later, and he still looks great--I wonder what he eats for breakfast ? !

While it may not be in the same class as ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"", ""Prince Valiant"" remains a fine example of Hollywood swashbuckling hokum that will not wear out its welcome with repeated viewings. Recommended.",1093219200,57,2219,4.880636604774536
422181,3,6302098440,"I watched this movie fearing the worst, since it was derived from a comic strip character. Never fear--this is good entertainment. While this is not a film to take seriously, it is a fun excursion into the ""King Arthur"" theme and does avoid being straight slapstick. For those not familiar with it, ""Prince Valiant"" is the story of a Scandanavian prince whose father has been dethroned, who comes to King Arthur's court with the ambition of becoming a knight of the Round Table and restoring his father's kingship.

 This film features an unusually good cast for a production of this type and caliber. Robert Wagner as Val, Sterling Hayden (of ""Dr. Strangelove"" fame) as Sir Gawain, James Mason as the Black Knight, and Janet Leigh as Princess Aleta all turn in very enjoyable performances.

422183,3,6302098440,"20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released this DVD on May 11, 2004. For anyone who's a fan of the Cinemascope era of the studio, this DVD is a must have. The movie itself is a silly contrivence of the time, based on a popular comic strip, as the illustrations during the main titles show, but it's all well-mounted with excellent photography and a Franz Waxman score that's a prime example of how a composer can really elevate the atmosphere and pace of a movie. The depiction of the era of the story is cardboard, with everyone and nearly everything looking too pretty and well-manicured -- no grubby surfs are anywhere to be seen, and even the comicbook Vikings are too clean -- but it's fun at its own level, even if today the movie's pace is a bit slow. My only complaint is that top-billed star James Mason isn't in more of it. The actor and his character are far more interesting to watch than the story's protagonist and the stiff, young Robert Wagner sporting a silly wig!
Fox has done a decent job of restoration on this 1954 Technicolor film. While the look is dated and the film stock is more grainy than we're used to today, the majority of it looks remarkably good. I suspect much of it was newly struck from the black and white color separation masters, but the frequent lap desolves have the second generation look of excessive grain and poorer color fidelity. There's one bad anomaly in the transfer at 24min. 15sec., a 15 second shot that looks to be third generation. It's soft, grainy and blocked-up. Except for a couple rear projection shots elsewhere in the movie, nothing else in the transfer looks this bad. Otherwise this is a fine looking 16X9 anamorphic DVD of a vintage Cinemascope film.
Originally this movie was presented in some theatres in 1954 in 4-track magnetic stereo.  Here, what survives of the stereo tracks is presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 (not 5.1 as stated in another review here). I'd have preferred if Fox had gone to the efforts of doing a proper 4.0 transfer, but the stereo still sounds good, with the directional dialogue of the era intact, though it can be a bit distracting when left and right speakers are too far from the screen (in theatres the speakers would of course be behind the screen).  I found I had to raise the dB level of my rear surrounds to +10 in order to bring out the ambient sound of the film, mostly reserved to the music, but at 1:27min. 21sec., when pig fat is used to light fires during the siege of the castle, the mono surround did come alive with fire noise and that was fun.
I'm only giving this DVD three stars because Fox didn't have enough faith (and they may be right) in this library title's marketability to include a commentary track by star Wagner, or a least some feature on the film's production history, and because the sound wasn't remixed for 4.0, but if you're a fan of such films I highly recommend this DVD.",1085184000,5,2904,4.540076335877862
