1222471,1,B00000IBUN,"The early portion of Katherine Heigl's career seemed to promise a great deal of upcoming success. But after her release of Wish Upon a Star , things have gone terribly downward, it seems. Bugbusters, was the latest,  and prime example. In an age of young actresses succeeding in Hollywood as  if there's no tomorrow, why hasn't Heigl made it? She showed brilliance in  all movies she put out up to 1996, but since then, there's been nothing. I  still maintain she's a fine actress, and seems to be one of Hollywood's  very nice, caring young women. However, in Bugbusters, she had to resort to  images of ""near nudity (The bathtub and shower scenes)."" What's  up Hollywood? Why is it that you're not giving this young, pretty actress  the time of day?",925603200,5,751,4.679389312977099
1222502,5,B00000IBUN,"As the quest to watch every 90's B rolls on we were given the opportunity to view the direct to video film Bug Buster. Well just about everything we view is direct to video, however we still feel it important to mention. Every once in a while it will not just be direct to video but direct to West Coast Video like Wicked Games. Anyway, Bug Buster embodies every quality necessary to deliver a successful 5 star rating. From the acting to the California scenery to the eloquently written script, Bug Buster has it all minus a Swayze or two. The film does however notably star a younger/hotter Katherine Heigl and Randy Quaid, best revered for his timeless role as cousin Eddy. This was and will be Katherine's finest cinematic performance much like Jennifer Anniston's in Leprechaun. These are the defining moments in a young actresses career in which they can never quite live up to again. Forget all the romantic comedies about finding a lover through an hour and a half of minutia and stick with the killer insect B! That's where it's at baby girl.

Bug Buster opens up in the California town of Mountain view, in which there are mountains to view....and lot of B. There is a poorly made news conference taking place where the towns mayor decides he will spray the town with an experimental pesticide to stop the recent influx of bugs. The quality of this news conference was the equivalent of the news report of Matt Collins winning his B grade Iron Man competition. Naturally the choice to use this pesticide has some bizarre effects and turns roaches into super human killing machines. Similar to Denton Vachs but in bug form. Just at this time Katherine Heigl and her parents are moving into town to after purchasing a local lodge. Since her Dad got fired for his actions on the floor of the office file room, he's decided moving away and buying the lodge would be a nice change of pace. Unfortunately the bugs are an unstoppable rebel force and start to eat everyone in sight. The towns only saving grace is bug exterminator extraordinaire General George S. Merlin played by the seasoned acting legend Randy Quaid. He has applied his army tactics to eliminating bugs and winds up going mano-a-mano with the queen roach creature. Yeah they actually first fight each other ultimately leaving the town safe and Randy Quaid champion of the universe.

Among all the wonderfully themed B's of the 90's, the giant/killer insect films were some of the best. Now Bug Buster may not meet absolute perfection to the likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mosquito/dp/B00000JN2O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mosquito</a>, but it is easily a close competitor. One of our favorite situations is when a film has no lulls...which lead you to watch wormholes with your buddy for a half hour until you realize your hungry and go to 7-11 for some snacks. This film had no lulls with non stop B goodness from the opening credits. Anytime a film is smart enough to throw in a heavy dose of Randy Quaid then it's got our seal of approval without question. Especially now that Randy Quaid has reached a new level of B, it's just that much better. Our suggestion is they work up a script for Bug Buster II and help Randy Quaid get his life back on track. This was he could stop getting arrested for squatting his his old foreclosed house. At the very least the brother Sid would each buy a copy which would surely help the budget expenses break even. For any fellow killer bug B fans then we strongly suggest Bug Buster II.",1337990400,,3550,4.780130293159609
1222503,2,B00000IBUN,"A B-movie full of cliches and stupidity, not to mention plot twists that just didn't seem to have been properly thought out in advance. I usually like kitsch, low-budget comedy-horror flicks -- they can be a lot of fun. But this one was just painful to watch, to the point where I found myself counting down the minutes until it was over. The wonderful cast of actors and actresses deserved better writing and directing than this movie offered them. Illogical, inane, and insipid, this movie is one I wish I'd never watched, and one I definitely will never watch again. I would have given it one star, but I felt the cast deserved better, hence my rating of two.

Then again, I have to admit, for all its faults, it was still better than 'Disaster Movie'. As is a colonoscopy without an anaesthetic.",1254182400,4,799,4.5874125874125875
1222504,3,B00000IBUN,"This flick is just plain, old-fashioned fun! Cheap thrills and special effects, but the hilarious Randy Quaid and the ever sexy Meredith Salenger and Katherine Heigl more than make up for it. Good ""Friday Night Popcorn Flick""! Lacking in the Extras department, but worth a look.",1174262400,6,278,5.065217391304348
1222505,3,B00000IBUN,"The movie was good and entertaining but, i found some of the people

just to nice and easygoing for this type of movie. Scotty from Star

Trek is just too nice of a sheriff and cares too much... and some

of the scenes look like they were all shot on the same day and then

edited into their righfull places in the film. So bottom line is

this is a good but not perfect bug/creature movie that is worth at

least one viewing.",1138838400,,426,4.072289156626506
1222506,5,B00000IBUN,"Bug Buster combines goofy humor, great acting, and powerful storytelling. It is a timeless tale about bugs and the intricate world they inhabit. On the surface, the film is about just this, bugs, but upon deeper inspection the film comments on the tenderness of the human heart and the comprehensiveness of human compassion. Don't miss this touching tale about so much more than insects.",1097971200,,387,5.0625
1222507,3,B00000IBUN,"Yes, James Doohan and George Takei, STAR TREK's Scotty and Sulu, are in this movie.  Doohan has more screen time as the sheriff, but Takei as an eccentric scientist, looks like he stepped right out of a Japense scifi flick.
BUG BUSTER, an entertaining little flick, has an identity crisis that works against its overall effectiveness.  Is it a horror movie with comic touches or is it a comedy with horror touches?  It's not out and out satire like the Scary Movie series, and it seems to want to take itself seriously, even with Randy Quaid's over the top General George, the pest eliminator.  At any rate, director Lorenzo Doumani keeps the movie going along pretty well and has some unique things going for it.
First, here we have Bernie Kopell (from LOVE BOAT) and Anne Lockhart (June's daughter) playing the parents of premenopausal Katherine Heigl.  And they get their own love scene..it's nice to see people past the age of 50 having the desire to have sex and show their love for each other.
As for the bugs, the real roaches are quite repulsive, and even the giant one at the climax is effectively disgusting.  Downtown Julie Brown has a ""cute"" cameo as the reporter for FU2 t.v., where she blatantly extols the calamities happening in the little town of Mountainview.
Another unique touch:  Trailer Trash, the band in the lodge's lounge, featuring Melba Toast and ?, is hilarious.
Entertaining, but its identity crisis, keeps it from being better.  Oh, Brenda Doumani who plays the veterinarian is effective, and probably related to the director?  Anyway, she also sings the movies closing credit song, ""Virtue"", which is about as bad as a song can get!",1084924800,6,1663,4.807017543859649
1222508,3,B00000IBUN,"BUG BUSTER is one of those rarest of fright films: it knows when not to take itself too seriously even if it does not know when to frighten and when to amuse.  The Bug of the movie is the Mother Bug, a flying roach that looks exactly like what is it, some guy on wires wearing a bug suit.  It is hard to imagine even small children being fightened, but it is far easier to see that the audience is titillated by overlapping waves of corny dialogue, cheesy special effects, and guest appearances by Star Trek's James Doohan as a corrupt small-town sheriff and George Tokei as a demented entymologist.  The plot is nonsense, of course.  A Mother Bug lays eggs that threaten everyone in town.  This theme of insectoid mother love we have seen before.  ALIENS showed us how it could be presented in a serious vein.  But here, in BUG BUSTER, everything is played for laughs.  Randy Quaid steals the show as exterminator General George, who squares off in a boxing match with the Mother Bug in a scene that pays homage to Charles Dutton, who tried much the same in ALIENS 3.  The result of this slugfest is a microscopic metaphor of the joy that a Big Bug movie can bring if only it refuses to take itself too seriously.",1050710400,,1214,4.408071748878924
1222509,3,B00000IBUN,"Comical supposed ""horror"" movie with the doctor from ""Love Boat"" (Bernie Kopell), Sulu (George Takei) and Scotty (James Doohan) from ""Star Trek"", and Isabel (Katherine Heigl) from  ""Roswell"", as well as co-star of those wonderful  ""Vacation"" movies, Randy Quaid.
The whole thing with the bugs  and the dark and the water was pretty darn far-fetched.  If you are a  horror movie fan, this is NOT the film for you.  Randy Quaid as a twisted  exterminator-general -- that's about the only scary thought in the movie.  But if you want see former Trek dudes die, it's all right.
But let's face  it:  this movie would have been pretty darned unwatchable without Katherine  Heigl in it.  She looked the best I had ever seen her look (at least until  the June 2000 Maxim shots).  She has some acting talent as well, though you  would not be able to discern it from this flick.  More Heigl and less  Scotty in the future works for me...",961718400,,927,4.6234567901234565
1222510,5,B00000IBUN,"Bug Buster was one of the greatest movies I've seen in a long time. I  enjoy sci-fi and fantasy movies, and this one was amazing. It was funny,  serious and even exciting. What more could you ask for in a movie. The  actors were also great, especially Katherine Heigl!",961027200,4,268,4.428571428571429

7910616,5,B00000IBUN,"This is the best of all the big bug movies wrapped into one.

Years ago, a chemical pesticide was needed to save crops. Now we switch to today the Griffin Family (Kathrin Heigl, Bernie Kopell, and Anne Lockhart) is moving in and bought lakefront property.

Something is not right; several of the locals are getting bugged and dispatched in a gory manor. This is being reported by the channel F U 2.
Sworn to protect the town is Sheriff Carlson (James Doohan). The Sheriff reminds everyone about Jaws. They may need to bring in General George S. Merlin (Randy Quaid) the Bug Buster.

The movie makers must have had the goods on most of the actors to coerce them into being in this movie. All the actors did a great job of over acting.

The bugs and the mother bug were so realistic that I had to look at the credits to be sure no bugs were harmed in the production.

Many a time production as this movie try to be too campy and end up being too ridicules to watch. This movie is well balanced and makes you want to watch to the end and them some.

This movie needs to be watched several times to get all the nuances.

The actual location is recognized by world travelers as Big Bear Lake, Big Bear Valley, San Bernardino National Forest, California, USA.",1505779200,,1253,4.375

7910623,5,B00000IBUN,"My repeat viewing of this film and I liked it even better the second time around.  A recognizable cast whether by name or face, with a brunette Katherine Heigl before Affairs of State, it's satiric fun. The plot follows the standard ""Monster on the Loose"" formula, but that's OK because the entire film is more or less tongue-in-cheek so even if the audience knows a mile in advance what's going to happen, it's entertaining to watch. In fact, knowing makes it even better, because there are a couple of little twists thrown in which immediately short-circuit expected events.

George Takei, James Doohan, and Randy Quaid are over-the-top, scenery-chewing hoots which is part of the movie's...dare I say...charm? It took a bit to accept James Doohan without a Scottish accent, however. I kept waiting for it. There are also a couple of verbal digs at monster movies, such at Jaws, when the characters follow the outlikne and do the expected ignoring of danger.

 I wasn't wild about the ending; I could've done WITHOUT that part of the formula but it's just different enough to warrant watching it more than once.",1416960000,,1113,4.873015873015873
