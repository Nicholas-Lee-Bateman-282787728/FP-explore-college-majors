7980465,5,B0000897AR,"I, too, agree that this is an intelligent, well-written series. I have enjoyed every episode. One thing I'm particularly pleased about is the wonderful period costuming and set dressing. It is a pleasure to watch from many perspectives. Can't wait for Season 5!",1189728000,,261,5.093023255813954
7980466,5,B0000897AR,"I usually find murder mystery dramas a hit-or-miss affair but Foyle's War has renewed my faith in a genre that has largely been done to death in recent years.

Foyle's War is superbly written with great acting from all the main characters (as well as supporting cast and guest stars) - in particular, of course, Michael Kitchen as the rather sobering Christopher Foyle.

Foyle is a rather complex detective, with an inner turmoil of morality and upholding the law (though upholding the law is his final prerogative). For exmaple, there is an episode where a warden has been caught looting from a bombed house and a new emergency law means that the thieving warden will be hanged as a looter. The warden cannot believe, in his niavity, that his crime deserves punishment of such gravitus. Through Kitchen's subtle facial expressions, we can sense a conflict between the severity of the warden's inevitable punishment and the duty to uphold the law, especially in the cruel time of war. To me, that makes great acting - not what the character says, or how it is said, but what the character says in silence.

War fever England is recreated realistically with actual historical facts incorporated into the fictional story (such as internment camps for German citizens).

Each episode is approx 100 minutes long (uncut versions) and are complex enough to have ample replay value.

If you like intelligent, well written dramas with great acting I highly recommend Foyle's War.",1133740800,8,1471,4.963414634146342
7980467,5,B0000897AR,This is an excellent episode in a wonderful series. The period is fascinating and sets up all sorts of unusual and thought provoking issues about carrying on in a time of crisis. Outstanding writing directing and acting all around. Michael Kitchen is completely believable as the hard working police detective who is confronted with all sorts of crimes in a time when everyone is on edge. The whole series is a treat.,1061337600,6,417,4.805555555555555
