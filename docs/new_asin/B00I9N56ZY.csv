8640219,4,B00I9N56ZY,"This set of trailers is unique in that it contains many trailers that are not on other sets. About half the disc are the ""adult"" comedies that make Ozploitation so different than other countries. Those trailers do contain a lot of nudity and ""adult things"" that might not be for everyone. The picture quality is better than many other trailer sets, but it still shows some age (which, honestly, is not an issue).
I enjoyed the set, especially since there were a lot of different trailers and not the same old stuff.",1526688000,,515,4.608695652173913

8640221,5,B00I9N56ZY,"A fantastic compilation of trailers - across a variety of genres - from Down Under.

The capture quality of the video isn't as clean as something from 42nd Street Forever but still better than some trailer comps I've purchased in the past.  Plus, there were a ton of trailers on this set that I haven't seen on other sets!

If you're a fan of underground cinema/trailer collections, I would highly recommend purchasing this DVD.",1403308800,,428,4.756756756756757
8640222,4,B00I9N56ZY,"'Ozploitation Trailer Explosion' can be considered as a companion to the documentary from a couple of years ago called 'Not Quite Hollywood'.  As such is it great to see the trailers to these movies - most of which I never heard of, even though I lived through the 1970s and went to my fair share of drive in theaters and grind houses.  There are about 165 minutes of straight trailers divided in genres.  My only real complaint is the total lack of any extras - other trailer compilations add commentaries to give some background - and menus, which were clunky and difficult to get around.  But for pure trailer enjoyment, it fit the bill.",1403222400,,640,4.587719298245614
8640223,5,B00I9N56ZY,"I've been collecting trailer comps. for about 20 years, and this is one of the best. Do yourself a favor, and pick this up asap!",1396224000,,128,4.16
8640224,5,B00I9N56ZY,"As a fan of super low budget 80's trash cinema, I naturally stumbled upon DYI studio Intervision's other releases like The Burning Moon, Things, and Sledgehammer. Intervision caters to the VHS era underground horror scene (a small but dedicated fan base), and their releases have been extremely enjoyable with plenty of extras thrown in, as well as providing the best possible presentation for these forgotten oddball genre films.

Following in the footsteps of their mondo/exploitation documentary release Australia After Dark, comes this immense collection of 65 Australian horror, action, and sex films - all presented uncensored, one right after the other, with a run time of 165 minutes.

If you have seen any of Synapse Film's 42nd Street Forever collections, you will know what to expect here. I was astonished at just how many genre films Australia actually put out - a lot of them I never heard of. These trailers are extended (most of them) and really do package up the films in a manner in which you probably don't need to seek out the full film its self.

Some familiar films are here - Mad Dog Morgan (featuring the late great Dennis Hopper), Road Games (Stacey Keach & Jamie Lee Curtis), Dead End Drive-In Wake In Fright, Patrick, and others. Aussie favorite Bruce Spence (Road Warrior's Gyro Captain) can be found all over these trailers, as well as Donald Pleasence, Steve Railsback, and many more familiar faces.

If you are into cult cinema, horror, exploitation etc and enjoy being blasted with non-stop trailers full of mind-bending genre films then you need this in your collection. Its a lot of fun and a great historical look at what was actually a booming market for Australian films in the 70's & 80's.

At the very least, this is an essential buy for fans who own the 42nd Street Forever collections. Intervision is a great lil' company and deserves the support of genre fans.",1395100800,9,1902,4.876160990712075
