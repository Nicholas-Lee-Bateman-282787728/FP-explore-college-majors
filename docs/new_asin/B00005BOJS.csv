7937835,5,B00005BOJS,"Aha! Brainteaser Classics is a great set. There are eight activities: Wing It, The Missing T, Pack it In, Double Square, All Uphill, Loop Trap, The fifth Chair, and Pyramid Twins. Players try to solve the problem set forth with each activity. The activities are great for elementary and middle school-aged children.  However, once they solve these, the set is pretty much over for players. This would be great for a classroom teacher since he/she has new students each year.  These are great for time fillers, travel, classroom and indoor recess.  We had this game out with others during our son's party. Kids played with these games until all had arrived and the party was to begin.",1388275200,,683,4.82051282051282
