8614272,5,B00FC1ZC3W,"Very well done and the acting is top notch right from the first episode.  This show does season ending cliffhangers that drop your jaw so fast and so far it's practically bouncing off the floor, especially season 2 and 3.  The supporting cast is fabulous, too.  Another thing I liked is it not all gun shots and explosions.  Very little bloodshed, no cussing...just intelligent TV",1397001600,,380,4.8
