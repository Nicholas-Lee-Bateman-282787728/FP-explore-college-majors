8083087,3,B000B7VZG0,"Decent adaptation of the Wodehouse novel. Could have worked harder to create a convincing and consistant 1930s setting. And as good a writer as Julian Fellowes is, his added dialogue paled next to Wiodehouse's original lines.",1476662400,2,225,5.277777777777778

8083089,3,B000B7VZG0,"Mildly entertaining version of the classic PG Wodehouse novel Piccadilly Jim, about a cartoonist who must conceal his identity to woo the girl he's fallen for.  Done period style, set in the 1930s.  Great cast includes Tom Wilkinson.  That said, I prefer the 1930s version MGM did with Robert Montgomery.  Tbis one should have added up to more than it did.",1365206400,3,356,4.786885245901639
