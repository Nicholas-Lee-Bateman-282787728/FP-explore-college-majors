7817096,4,6301950305,On the 10th day of Christmas 2012 I'm going to review...WCW Starrcade 1990. The Bobby Eaton-Z Man match was decent with lots of quick back-and-forth action to boot. The quarter-final matches were all good in their own way. The Michael Wallstreet-Terry Taylor match was short and disappointing. The tag team match between The Skyscrapers against the team of Big Cat & The Motor City Madman was nothing but a one-sided squash. The tag team match between The Fabulous Freebirds against the team of Ricky Morton & Tommy Rich was bland even with the cool after match drama. The semi-finals matches were also good too. The Texas Lariat match for the United States title between Stan Hansen & Lex Luger was a great brawl even with the swerve ending. The Street-fight for the Worlds Tag Team titles between Doom against The Horsemen's Arn Anderson & Barry Windham was a extreme good brawl. The Tournament Finals between the team of The Great Muta & Mr. Saito against The Stenier Brothers was entertaining yet disappointing. The Mask vs title/steel cage match between  Worlds Champion Sting & The Black Scorpion(Ric Flair) was boring but pretty good. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10.,1356220800,,1172,4.830845771144278

Anyhow I was at the show and it was really good, but I am not endorsing some crackdiculous price for a wrestling vid.  out",1170201600,,268,3.925925925925926

Although the main event is not the greatest match in history, it is a fun surprise to see who is the black scorpion.

Sting said He knew who the Black Scorpion was the moment he locked up with him.

Great to see Danny Spivey return with Sid Vicious to reform the skyscrapers for one more night to get some revenge.

The Horsemen vs. Doom was a great street fight brawl.

Very physical, intense, hard hitting and fast paced. (Unlike other slow dragged out boring matches from other federations claiming to be hardcore)

The Steiner Brothers winning the tournament against internatonal tag team competion was excellent.

This is the Steiners at their finest!

Plus Lex Luger, Sid Vicious, Sting, Stan Hanson, The Steiner Bros., 4 Horsemen, The Great Muta, Doom and other top WCW superstars are showcased in wrestling's first and true annual super event of the year. Starrcade!!! An Event of Galactic Proportions",1140134400,2,961,4.9625
