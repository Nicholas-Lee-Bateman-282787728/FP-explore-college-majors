7844819,5,6303358160,"Genesis always was my favorite prog rock band as I got into the genre. Their blend of brilliant lyrics, balanced melodies where the didn't indulge themselves into pompous solos for the sake of virtuosity (a common issue in prog) and mindboggling on-stage theatrical work by Gabriel made them an easy choice. This video shows their evolution as band from their formation, all through their Gabriel years, after Gabriel but before Hackett left and their lives after ""An Then There Were Three"" with Collins at the helm. It doesn't include (not that I miss it) their latest work before dissolving as a band.

Pros: you get exposed to high-quality footage of their early work, which as a fan you probably got a chance to see in some deteriorated shape at some point, so you know there's hope for you to some day see the footage of the band performing in the early seventies and being able to distinguish the audio and the video.

Con: there are just snippets of performances, not entire songs shown. The length of the segments picked is enough to give you a very good feel for the song being played, but leaves you wanting more. Still this is no reason to take away even a single star from this otherwise perfect video about the best prog rock band in history.

Wish they would release it in DVD.",1159920000,5,1291,4.604347826086957

7844821,5,6303358160,"Lots of great quotes here: ""The whole album's kinda mad..."", ""that's a drag""  Great insight to the band. A classic that should be put on DVD. Listen closely for the snorter. I never get tired of watching this. Tony Banks has never been so pompous- absolutely essential.",1113609600,6,269,4.723404255319149
