I bought a Pro Tools video earlier for about the same price from another (better known) company, and it only covered the material you get in the Quick Start section of this course.  The course starts with the basics, but pretty rapidly moves on to mixing and mastering.  It also has very complete sections on midi and loops as well as software synthesizers and rewire.  I was also pleased by the production quality of the videos.  This company apparently uses a professional voiceover person, and she knows how to keep the tutorials interesting.  In the other video course I took, I'm sure the narrator was a great audio engineer, but his deadpan voice got really boring after awhile.  This is a lot of material to absorb, so you have to stay focused.  But if you do, you'll be well rewarded.",1144713600,3,888,4.540880503144654
8105674,3,B000E4AY3A,"I just purchased the Pro Tools 7 ""know-it-all"" DVD from digital music doctor and have watched a number of the modules. The quality of the DVD is okay and the speaker/host is very knowledgeable...although they could have run a de-esser on her voice in the final mix! I am pretty new to the Pro Tools world, but not to recording. I had an Alesis ADAT studio for years and have played in bands most of my life. I'm used to being around pro gear and tape recorder products. This DVD instructional program says that it's interactive. Buyer beware. Interactive simply means that you can stop, start, pause, etc., the DVD while you're viewing it. The instructor goes through the material very fast and there is definitely prior knowledge required (in my opinion) to be able to keep up. The examples of anything reviewed are done quickly so you'd better stay focused or you'll be lost. I was looking forward to having this DVD because I have so much to learn. I'm just saying that if your expectation is to have a newbie-friendly DVD instructional course that really goes in-depth into terminology, concepts, and step-by-step procedures, this may not be the DVD for you. It's a nicely done DVD and the instructor knows her stuff. She just goes way too fast and therefore, it's not very useful to me at my level.",1138665600,9,1303,4.645021645021645
