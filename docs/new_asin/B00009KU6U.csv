Yoga is about centering your body and awareness.  It is NOT a challenge towards your spiritual beliefs, I am a Christian and I find that if I focus my efforts on clearing my mind and handing my problems over to God during my Yoga workout, I have accomplished more than 2 things during my day.

This video IS for people who sit extended periods of time during the day.  Most of the injuries, such as carpel tunel, are a result of poor posture and misuse of our bodies.  If you want to think of it in another aspect, this is the Alexander Technique in working.  The two concepts are not dissimilar, they are merely related.  I highly recommend this video if you are experiencing pain while sitting for extended periods of time at work.  My mother used this video as a guide to help herself at work and her office team has borrowed the video and use it regularly to relieve stress.  Do something positive for yourself and research the products you're interested in...",1102291200,9,1127,4.480392156862745
7991138,2,B00009KU6U,"The title is missing the word YOGA. No where on the Amazon page does it say YOGA yet that is the first word in LARGE type on the DVD. I did a search for ""exercise"", not YOGA. I have not opened the DVD yet so I have not viewed its contents having read the back label. This DVD is for ""neck and shoulder tension, lower back pain, tight hamstrings, headaches, and carpal tunnel problems."" Wish I had known that up front.",1059350400,10,417,4.160493827160494
