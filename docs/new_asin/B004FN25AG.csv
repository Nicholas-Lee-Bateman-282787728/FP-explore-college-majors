Too many of my high school youngsters have heard that heroin ""is fun"". (That's a direct quote). They seem to think they can use it at will and control it - like they can with some other substances.
This DVD gives some historical background on the opium poppy. It shows how farmers in Afghanistan want to grow it because it's the most viable way they have of supporting themselves and their families. It also shows us some hard core addicts. One young woman tells how she loved to party and felt like she'd found what she always needed when she discovered heroin - and then she delineates her growing addiction and its negative consequences. We also visit with some older addicts who tell how this drug took them over and became the focus of their lives. And for me, the most poignant part is when we visit a couple in Noway (I believe) and how they spend their whole day to get money for their next fixes. They look just like the real walking - or should I say - nodding dead when they shoot up. Their lives and their ""love"" for each other are a heart breaking waste to witness.
This DVD is not for the faint of heart, and it has a lot of images of people injecting themselves, but it helps to de-romanticize this  fashionable drug that kids especially think they can play with.",1391817600,2,1399,4.401544401544402
8427966,3,B004FN25AG,"While the cover shows a Middle Eastern user, this doc speaks of heroin from an international perspective.  It says there are 4 regions in the world that produce poppies, but not more than 90% comes from Afghanistan.
Those with strong views on the War on Terror may really want to see this.  The work says as the war continues, more and more heroin arrives from that country to the US.  It also shows the wishy-washyness of organizations.  The Taliban punished heroin production when they were in power, but out of power, they protect farmers and don't care less if more of the drug comes to the West.
When it comes to individual examples, this doc covers a man in Oslo and a white woman in Chicago.  The woman's overcoming heroin is a silver lining in this dark cloud.  I was glad that they spoke to middle-class, white users, so that the work doesn't suggest that this is just something affecting low-income people or people of color.  The last paragraph of the work says that people beyond identity category can become addicted.
HERE'S MY PROBLEM WITH THIS WORK: The work doesn't speak about how heroin helps to spread HIV.  The narrator says there's more heroin use out there because it can be snorted, rather than injected.  However, it also says those who snort will eventually inject.  It's not like this work ever mentions clean needles or said users are dedicated to clean needles.  So I feel like a HUGE chunk of the story was omitted here.  And in a way, that's dangerous.",1336867200,2,1482,4.636015325670498
8427967,5,B004FN25AG,"The name for the Meth DVD was catchy, but I think it would be better suited for this Heroin DVD. If you have ever toyed around with the idea of trying Heroin, please watch this DVD, and maybe you'll change your mind. It is very well filmed, and captures the true essence of what heroin addicts must endure in their day to day struggles to getting the next hit.",1333497600,,360,4.231884057971015
