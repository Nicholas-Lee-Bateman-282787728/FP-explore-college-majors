8352971,4,B0026L7SOC,The image of the Little Red truck brought me back to my sand box when I was racing through sand roads bringing my product to town. It was a load of joy and surprises. This story was more formal than the whimsical title yet the story captured the life of the Tour Guide. Another view would be the story of the children when the Red Truck arrived. It was a dream come to reality and hopes that saw completion. This was an adult presentation about the dreams of a child. This dream to promote theater for children came across as the duty of the adult to compliment the failure of school boards. Where's the whimsical feeling of imaginary characters coming from the heart of a child? This is a good story for one who believes in the project already.,1249257600,,745,4.366906474820144
