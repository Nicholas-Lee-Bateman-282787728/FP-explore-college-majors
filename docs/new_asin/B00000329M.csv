For a power rangers christmas special, I would point fans to ""I'm dreaming of a White Ranger"" before this thing. Here's what's on the tape. An ad for Power Rangers merchandise that you can't get anymore unless you dig around the internet. A cool promo for a karate school taught by the Green Ranger, Tommy. Then the movie starts. The rangers are no where to be seen because they're with santa doing very important work. Alpha and Zordon are all alone. Then Zordon presents Alpha with a christmas tree to get into christmas... Zordon's mouth STILL does not synch up with his words.

Then Alpha gets an idea to make the place more ""christmassy"" so that santa will come and the rangers will come with them. So he invites kids without getting their parents permission (some might call this kidnapping) to decorate the place and sing christmas carols. Then the green ranger, pink ranger, and blue ranger show up and the end the special singing ""we wish you a merry christmas"" and a montage.

All of this happens in a span of 30 minutes. The recordings of the actual carols are definitely third rate compared to other versions of Christmas carols for kids. Basically that's what this tape is, a tape of christmas carols with very little power rangers. It's pretty bad, but a 5 year old kid or younger might like it. However, if you don't want your ear drums to suffer, I point you in the directions of another tape of christmas carols for kids: Kid Songs We wish you a merry Christmas.",1266796800,,1644,4.5286195286195285
7902291,3,B00000329M,Hey! All you power ranger fans.  Here is a review for this video finally.  Even if you love the power rangers this video isn't for you. This video is for young kids and their parents who like listening to christmas carols.  There isn't any of the good power ranger action were all use to with the  cool music and monsters.  But since it is a power ranger video and is hard  to find I give it 3 out of 5.  You still get to see all the classic  charcters.  Hope this helps you in your quest to save the world from the  evil Rita Repulsa.,961718400,6,535,4.0095238095238095
