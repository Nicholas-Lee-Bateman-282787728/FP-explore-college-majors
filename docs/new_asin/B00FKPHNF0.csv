5995077,5,B00FKPHNF0,"I bought this movie after seeing it on Hallmark Channel a number of times. It just speaks to me with the feelings that we all have about not being in control of our Lives, yet if we just let it ride out, there usually is a reason for how things turn out. I Love the cast, so many popular Actors and Singers all adding to the miracle of the story. I Love it so much I bought a second DVD for a friend who I know could use the uplifting ending of this story. If you like feel good endings, with a little mystery, I recommend this DVD highly.",1516924800,,539,3.9541284403669725

5995081,5,B00FKPHNF0,"This movie got panned on Rotten Tomatoes and iMDB, but I love it.  Typical story line, but told in a different way.  Lots of good music by Willie Nelson, who also plays Nick and is really good, and Lyle Lovett - and how can you not love Lyle in an ugly Christmas sweater?

Of course it's manipulative...as critics on Rotten Tomatoes said:  ""shameless holiday movie"" ""sugarcoated"" ""dreadfully obvious and thin"".  Show me any Christmas movie that couldn't be described that way - it's why we like Christmas movies!  You must be able to suspend disbelief, be open to sugary story lines, and the same tired plots over and over.  But this one is better, both in story line, direction and acting - everyone was great.  And sometimes it's nice to think that things like that could happen, do happen, and plus I like the decorations!  Ok, I'm sappy, I admit it...especially this time of year.",1513468800,,884,4.651612903225806

5995178,5,B00FKPHNF0,"I enjoyed this movie BUT I love Christmas movies about families with a dysfunctional issue who eventually come together after learning an important lesson by Divine intervention.

Harry Connick Jr. plays Michael. A generally nice guy, good husband, fun, hands on dad who doesn't like Christmas or visiting his family during the holidays. He finally agrees to take his wife and son to his parents for Thanksgiving AND Christmas but changes his mind during the family Thanksgiving get together. We find out why in a heartfelt talk with his son.  Eventually history starts repeating himself and it is up to him to make sure his son doesn't end up hating the holidays as well.

Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson are just two of the actor/singers appearing in this movie. I love them both before and after this movie.

There are some heartfelt moments, some funny moments, and some sad moments that had me sobbing. I found myself at times being angry with Michael and wondering why he couldn't see all the love he had around him and all the time he wasted running away from his emotions then I was angry with his parents for not forcing him to face things as a child but if all this happened would we have the same movie?

I loved Willie's appearances and all the neighbors who showed up with boxes of lights. I guess you will have to check out the movie to see what I am referring to.",1449014400,,1383,4.582995951417004

5995183,1,B00FKPHNF0,Super boring.  Harry Connick Jr.'s character is a grinch pretty much the whole movie until the last 15 minutes.  And his son becomes a grinch about halfway through!

5995193,5,B00FKPHNF0,"Had a limited release but what an unexpected Christmas treat! We were the only two in a matinee showing and we stood up and applauded. It has good 'word of mouth' rep though.....note the 185 customer reviews!. In 2013, our local library system had 8 copies and 74 people on the waiting list for it!  Too bad it hasn't got traction yet. But take heart. When IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE was released in 1946, it got little attention either. Now it's on TV umpteen times every Christmas!!!

5995217,5,B00FKPHNF0,"This is a great Christmas Movie. It's typical Hallmark. Hallmark Christmas Movies are easy to predict what happens, but it's fun watching how they get there. The actors and actresses for the most part are very likeable. You will find a lot of actors who's best days have passed, but they are still viable in modest movies, and it is a lot of fun to see them again. This movie has good music and includes Willie Nelson, Harry Connick Jr., Connie Britton, Chris Kristofferson and Lyle Lovett. The story centers around the Harry Connick Jr. character, whose younger brother drowns on a Christmas Day when they were young. They received a new pair of ice skates for Christmas and were anxious to try them out. His brother went over to Harry and swung him to the edge of the lake because he saw the ice was too thin. He fell through and drowned. The Harry Connick  Character blamed himself and from that point on refused to celebrate Christmas. After he grew up and had a wife (Connie Britton) and son, something happened during Christmas that was also a tragedy. His son blamed himself as his Father did years before. And withg the help of Willie Nelson, (An Angel), they both searched for what the truth was. As Willie said, Sometimes accidents just happen and it's nobody's fault. Of course their was more to it than just saying it. This movie has heart, a few places that those who are prone to shed a few tears, probably will, some funny scenes, a great ending, and good music through out. This is good family fun.",1422403200,4,1514,4.545787545787546

The story is made believable by the great actors. And I find myself wishing for a soundtrack--loved the music! And who are the many musicians? Please come to my house for Christmas, Lyle, Willie, Kris, etc.!
Back to the plot: it's a bit contrived in Christmas movie fashion. Just go with it. But every Christmas movie has to have a redemption. Harry Connick Jr. was incredible in that redemption as a suffering dad at an emotional crossroads. The actor who played his son was really good. Connie Britton was terrific.
Please watch this one. Not sappy and gooey, just remarkably real (for a Christmas movie).",1422057600,3,748,4.717557251908397

5995254,4,B00FKPHNF0,"I love that moment when I realize I have finished my shopping, the wrapping is done, the work week has ended and Christmas is around the corner.

And this is when I load up on Christmas cheer, with holiday books, music - and movies!

Angels Sing is a new addition to my holiday shelf. The movie is based on the book When Angels Sing by Turk Pipkin. I had read the book - and enjoyed it. As always, with book to film adaptations, I was curious to see how close the movie would stick to the original story.

Harry Connick Jr. stars as Michael Walker, a family man who refuses to celebrate Christmas. His reason is understandable - and heartbreaking. When the family unknowingly moves to a street known for its elaborate Christmas celebrations and tragedy strides, Michael is forced to confront his past as the impact on the present is too great to ignore.

There's a great cast in Angels Sing - most with a musical bent - notably Willie Nelson as an angel, Lyle Lovett as an neighbour and Kris Kristofferson as Grandpa. All of them contribute musical moments to the film.

And this is a feel good film for the family. (Although there is one sad event that parents should be prepared to discuss with younger children) But there are some funny bits as well. (watch for the snowman's smile turning into a frown) The music is great, the decorations on the street lovely and the overall sentiment can't help but put you in a festive mood. The family interactions are positively portrayed and families viewing together will find lots of food for thought. The plot is somewhat obvious, but that's what I'm looking for in my holiday viewing - happy endings.",1419120000,4,1647,4.569491525423729

One thing I've got to say about this movie that it's one of the most postive way of when losing a love one in your family before the the time of the Christmas. And this is one of those movies that give one postive way of saying ""They may not be here, but they are always with us no matter what. Even for Christmas.""

Harry Connick Jr stars as a father who has to come to grips with a sad time in his life and do the same for his son.  Moving to a new neighborhood which is on a world famous street known for its Christmas decorations is tough for Connick, a man who doesn't put up decorations, to deal with.  The whole community goes overboard for the Holidays and after some self revelations and wise advice from a mysterious friend Willie Nelson, he joins in.  It has humor, tears and music for everybody.",1401753600,3,566,4.413461538461538

5995306,5,B00FKPHNF0,"If you like music, laughter, a few tears and a feel-good holiday experience, this is a film for you.  Willie Nelson is funny and inspiring as Nick, a crusty, puzzling character, showing up in the most unlikely places.  Connie Britton and Harry Connick, Jr. are believable as they struggle with house hunting and holiday stresses. Lyle Lovett as the lovable neighbor brings humor and a haunting song to the movie.  Kris Kristofferson and Fionnula Flanigan could be anyone's favorite grandparents.  Chandler Canterbury, as their young grandson shows us an innocent belief in what Christmas is all about.  Add to the story lots of Austin musicians and it can't miss.",1400803200,,663,5.045871559633028

5995310,4,B00FKPHNF0,"This review is for, ""Angels Sing.""
This is a cute, feel good story with a secular Christmas theme which I enjoyed.  One reason that I love to watch stories around Christmas themes is that usually the whole family can watch it and enjoy it.  I hate the soft porn movies that are put out which are labeled as entertainment for the family.

I really liked almost all of this movie.  My only complaint is that this is supposed to be a Christmas movie with nothing about Christ or the true meaning of Christmas even mentioned.  We have become a society that tolerates everything but no tolerance for Christian beliefs.  When did we change?

The storyline, as a whole, is good.  The acting is good.  The singing is great.  A good, comedic movie with a few serious moments.",1393372800,2,766,4.525547445255475

I'm not a prude, by any means, but I just get so tired of having all that negativity.  This movie certainly  won't win any awards--it's too clean and and nice.

Usually, I find Family moves to be a little ""kiddish"", but this one is sure to appeal to all ages. The acting is pretty good, the characters are nicely developed, and we even see Willie himself. But those aren't the most important aspects of a movie: the plot and felling of a film is the most important, and it seems that the producers really maxed that out with this one. There is a rather tragic event that happens, and threatens to make a certain person very bitter. But like any good movie, everything turns out good in the end, even if things almost went completely wrong. I'm pretty sure that most viewers will find this story heartwarming, fun and simply wonderful. Probably can be said to be one of the best Family/Christmas movies around. It just doesn't ""blend in"" with other family-oriented films. It really stands out as a great film. Buy it; I'm very sure you'll enjoy it!",1388102400,,989,4.593220338983051

5995367,4,B00FKPHNF0,"It was nice to see uplifting, clean family entertainment. It deals with a not uncommon theme, struggling with the Christmas season or other special holidays because of serious past events and self blame. I thought they made the point well that often our reaction to what has happened isn't the same as the reaction of other people involved; we can be especially blind to our own 'blindness' because it seems so overwhelmingly right to us.  That is where our community can really help us. Everyone gave of themselves, selflessly.  It doesn't happen as much in real life as we'd like but without visual goals and ideals, such as the way people pulled together to help a few hurting people, we will surely never hit the mark. It isn't a heavy weight drama but it held our attention.",1385164800,15,779,4.678832116788321
