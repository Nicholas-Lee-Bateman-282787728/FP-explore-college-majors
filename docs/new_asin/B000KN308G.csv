8158218,2,B000KN308G,This is a good video for beginners in the field of fusing glass. The teachers take the time to go thru each slowly and explore what you need to know.,1378512000,,149,4.0
8158219,3,B000KN308G,"I am rating this just ""average"" because although it covers many aspects of fusing, it gives very few actual details needed to do a fusing project.  It is a good overview of the process.  I just wish there were more details.

Also, hitting the rewind takes you all the way to the beginning; there is a pause button to use but you cannot rewind if you missed what they are saying.",1359158400,2,378,4.295774647887324
8158220,5,B000KN308G,"This is a great instructional video. They cover just about everything from using the kiln and what temperatures you'll need to use and how much time to use.  The tools you'll need. Protecting your kiln selves. They go over all the steps from what glass to use, cutting the glass, using templates and firing methods. They give a lot of helpful hints.  They even cover some advanced techniques.  And then of course they teach you how to make jewelry from your fused glass pieces.  They teach you how to drill holes into your glass. They cover jewelry findings, adhesives, wires and cording.  I think this video is a great value.",1346198400,4,626,4.654545454545454
8158221,1,B000KN308G,not worth buying. poorly taped and the wemon in this movie will get on your nerves. the movie is like watching two old hens yacking while being filmed in the 1800's.,1192665600,,165,4.354838709677419
8158222,4,B000KN308G,"Vicki Payne is an excellent instructor. She works hard to make stained glass and fusing accessible and affordable to beginners. She keeps things simple, she never goes too fast, and she chooses projects that are basic without being dorky.

In this video, Vicki Payne and Jayne Persico demonstrate the techniques of creating jewelry by fusing glass (primarily dichroic glass) in a small tabletop kiln. They do a very good job of demonstrating the differences in types of fusing (such as a tack fuse and a full fuse), and they clearly show every step in the process. By the end of the video, you know how to make several kinds of jewelry, complete with findings and finish work.

I've been fusing for over a year (though I've mainly been doing small dishes and using a larger kiln) and I learned quite a bit. If you're just getting started with fusing -- no matter what size projects you're considering -- this video will give you an excellent overview of what's involved.",1177200000,24,970,4.733727810650888
