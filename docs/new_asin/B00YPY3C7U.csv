7223769,5,B00YPY3C7U,"When I saw the trailer for this film, I was entranced and I had to see it immediately. Director, Lisandro Alonso's obscure and emotion-based storytelling remains a strong theme throughout the picture. Viggo Mortensen's performance is extremely solid and involving. However, the real gold within this film is the cinematography. Timo Salminen has brought the same classic and saturated imagery as he does in Aki Kaurismaki's productions. Timo has truly made this a modern masterpiece. Popcorn Flick-lovers will possibly despise this film's pacing and story. Then again, it wasn't made for them.",1441756800,5,593,5.456521739130435

7223771,1,B00YPY3C7U,"The landscape cinematography was awesome. But I really don't understand the need to focus on something for so long with the intent of making it look like still life. While some may consider this to be ""artistic"" I think it is a waste of my time to watch a movie that basically stands still. As for standing still... the movie stretches things out and out and out. Then, you reach the end and discover there really is no plot - none that I could see. Seriously, did Viggo really need to do a movie like this? The critics claim this to be one of the best movies of the year. Given the standard nowadays in the cinema world, I can't say I agree because most of the movies being made today are just garbage and this one is at the top of the pile.",1440547200,,742,4.159722222222222
7223772,2,B00YPY3C7U,"I just couldn't get into this film, but may try again.  Nothing connected me to the characters or plot.  Very strange ""art"" film.",1440460800,,129,4.565217391304348
7223773,1,B00YPY3C7U,"I decided to give this movie a try, and did I ever regret it! I couldn't even get interested in any of the characters. Even the scenery was boring.
A Danish man takes his young daughter, leaves their country, and they end up in South America. He is now in the military in Patagonia. They are camped with other men, and at fifteen, the girl is bored and takes a liking to a young soldier. She leaves with him, and her father searches on his own. On and on the scenes drag. As the movie continued I kept looking for some interesting turn of events, but there really wasn't one. The rest of the movie left me hanging, wondering if I missed some symbolism. A real drag. Save your money.",1440028800,3,682,4.253846153846154
7223774,3,B00YPY3C7U,"Set in 1882, in Argentina's Patagonia region during the last days of the military campaign Conquest of the Desert, Jauja chronicles a strange journey of Danish Captain Gunnar Dinesen (Viggo Mortensen), whose 15-year-old daughter Ingeborg (Viilbjrk Malling Agger) goes missing in the middle of the desert. Dinesen sets out to search for Inge on his own, but the journey leads him into the territories he has never dreamed of before.

Like some of David Lynch films, Jauja is kind of a movie that fascinates some viewers because of its unreality and illogicality. Those viewers would like to discuss the content, especially what happens (or seems to happen) to Dinesen in the films last fifteen minutes, while others may find the deliberately paced film whimsical or even pretentious.

Whichever group you fall into, you will admit the beauty of Argentine director Lisandro Alonsos film that captures the hauntingly beautiful nature of Patagonia with the muted colors. The credit goes to Finnish cinematographer Timo Salminen, best known for his work in Aki Kaurismki films. The music is sparse, but quite impressive (from the album Please Tomorrow by Buckethead and Viggo Mortensen).

I attempted to be neutral in describing what you are going to see in Jauja (of which meaning you will find in the film), but frankly, I still do not know how to interpret the journey, let alone what the film is all about. This is a unique film experience, I am sure, but whether you like it or not depends on you.",1439510400,5,1497,4.932539682539683
7223775,4,B00YPY3C7U,"This is a terrific abstract historical drama set in Patagonia in the 1880's involving a Danish man whose daughter has disappeared with a soldier. What ensues is his search for her and then... well, suffice it say, it eventually takes an art film turn that some won't understand or care to understand. But if you do (and I did - and I'm still thinking about it) then it is rewarding in part because it prompts discussion and thought; something that movies all too rarely do. The film definitely is unconventional, and the pace is slow but engaging, and the aspect ratio is square, which means your widescreen TV won't be utilized fully. But who cares? This is a filmmaker's vision and it's worth a look.",1438646400,16,702,4.624
7223776,1,B00YPY3C7U,"God awful.  A waste of money and time.  A waste of two minutes.  Someone making a home movie with friends.  In grammar school.

7223777,1,B00YPY3C7U,"This is an ""art"" film in the worst sense of that term. I urge anyone who finds it interesting to look at the user reviews (overwhelmingly negative) that are accumulating on Netflix.",1438387200,2,181,4.6875
8718741,4,B00YPY3C7U,"After really loving the first Alonso film I saw, Los Muertos, Ive struggled somewhat with all his films Ive seen since.  For some reason Alonsos dedication to vaguely mythic and very enigmatic storytelling worked great for me in Los Muertos -- creating a deeply disturbing portrait of a man who is leaving prison and returning to his family, perhaps to kill them (or perhaps not).

Jauja is also the familial story of a man on a mythic journey, in this case a Danish Captain in the army, stationed in an unspecific south or central American country that is in the midst of being colonized by the Spanish, with the Danish presence seeming to be one of both rivalry and co-operation.

Viggo Mortensen (always excellent) plays the Captain, who has brought his daughter with him (why he would bring her to such a hostile, dangerous and male dominated environment is never made clear).  When she runs off with a young soldier, Mortensens character heads out to find her, and ends up traveling into his own soul, with the lines blurring between real and imagined, reality and surrealism.

The film looks great, and has a lot of striking and memorable moments.  But after two viewings, I wasn't sure quite what it was saying, and  worse  Im not entirely convinced it does either.  That said, there are enough things I admire; the odd photography, the many strange and discomforting images and incidents that stick in my head like memories of a bad dream, that Im willing to forgive its frustrations.  To a point.",1471737600,4,1505,4.753846153846154
8718742,4,B00YPY3C7U,"The format of this film is 4:3 aspect with rounded corners, like an old photograph.  It is one of the most beautifully films I have seen in recent years.
From the first extended shot of the displaced Danish captain with her teenage daughter after fighting against native rebels in Patagonia in the 1880s.
The dialogue between the caring father and the indifferent daughter holds true to this day.  The film's storyline is linear and simple, about the father went searching for his daughter who 'eloped' with a low ranking soldier.  Much of the film has no dialogue, let the viewers to soak in the out worldly
scenery of the region, shorelines, grassland, rocky mountain and the eerie volcanic landscape.  The epilogue back in Denmark may seem bewildering.  Is it the beginning of the journey.  Or, is it the end.  The viewer is recommended to watch the 42min. bonus film narrated by the director Lisandro Alonso, his co-creators and his amazing Finnish cinematographer Timo.  This short film shed some light on the writer/director's ideas and intention on this unique film.",1468108800,,1073,4.955307262569832

8718749,5,B00YPY3C7U,"I went to see director Lisandro Alonso's 'Jauja' especially because his earlier trilogy blew me away. 'La Libertad' (2001), 'Los Muertos' (2004) and 'Fantasma' (2006) each observe a solitary man  a survivor  roaming through the jungle wordlessly, like a wild animal. (The setting of 'Fantasma' is urban, but can also metaphorically be regarded as a jungle.) A decade later, I am still amazed by the power of those films and by how little they rely on plot, dialogue or props. Alonso's 2008 effort, 'Liverpool', is also minimalist and follows a similar theme, but tells a slightly more specific story.

'Jauja' is more elaborate than any of Alonso's previous work. As in 'Liverpool', there is something like a plot and very limited, but significant dialogue (in Spanish, Danish and French, in this case). A gorgeous, more sophisticated cinematography presents landscapes that bring to mind 19th Century oil paintings. This is a period film that involves realistic costumes and the kind of beautifully crafted tools used by explorers and the military in the 1800s. Also, 'Jauja' features a famous actor, Viggo Mortensen of 'The Lord of the Rings', who co-produced it and co-wrote the musical score. I think this was all a great way for Alonso to try something new and fresh, without giving up his very unique style and aesthetics.

Don't expect a linear, mainstream film or you may be disappointed (as some of the other ratings prove). This is an art-house Western  a strange, slow-paced ride through the vast, open space of the Argentine Patagonia. It addresses the exhilarating sense of adventure, but also of violence and dread, that one might experience in the hinterland. The story reminds me of Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness', in that it depicts a struggle between the forces of ""civilization"" and the primitive, while also drawing a parallel between the wilderness of outdoor nature and our subconscious. (Alonso's film 'Los Muertos', which shows a man travelling along a river, may also have a link to Conrad's short novel.) The film's tempo, surreal situations and the use of places as a reference to states of mind are reminiscent of Tarkovsky's 'Stalker' or 'Solaris'.

We are explained that ""Jauja"" is a mythical land of abundance, something akin to paradise, whose search in the old days drove many to ruin. Dinesen (Mortensen) aims to establish order in a distant, foreign land, but keeps running into unruly behavior, left and right. It's as if the indomitable spirit of the desert possessed everyone around him and suggested to him  with its dreamy voice, sometimes forcefully, sometimes playfully  that his stubbornly controlling approach towards life is misguided, a lost cause. Perhaps more than in any other film he's made, the director achieves communicating something magical and ethereal, pointing to the deep, enigmatic wisdom that we each hold inside, but are afraid to listen to. The ending may imply that all these characters are, in fact, interconnected, showing different sides of the same stone (much like the ""animus"" and ""anima"" in Jungian psychology describe the male and female aspects in every person, for example).

Like Alonso's earlier trilogy, 'Jauja' poetically hints at the magnificence and mystery of human life in God's garden. Its images and sounds seem to come from far, far away, yet somehow feel eerily familiar and close.",1445299200,3,3372,5.127504553734062
