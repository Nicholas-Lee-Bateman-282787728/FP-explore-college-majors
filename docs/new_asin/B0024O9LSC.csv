8350837,3,B0024O9LSC,"The narrators are AWFUL: they are cheesy, anticlimatic and annoying.  They present the documentary as a ""letter to the rhinos"", which would be fine if it were brief and introductory, but it goes on and on.  They also don't do a good enough job of getting the facts across, and when I watch a documentary I'm interested in the facts.
However, the facts that are presented are really interesting: I won't give anything away, but the reason why the rhinos are leaving the relocation area is fascinating.",1302048000,,500,4.735632183908046
8350838,4,B0024O9LSC,"Deep into the documentary, the narrator says there are only 4,000 rhinos left.  This work focuses on how Botswana is trying to save rhinos from poachers.  Whereas it seems like pandas will die out for a whole bunch of factors, this seemed like an upbeat work that suggests that rhinos can be saved.  There are sad moments here.  Remember in ""Return of the Jedi"" when an Ewok learned that his fellow Ework soldier died?  This is not a totally happy documentary.
At times, the work is anti-climactic.  The narrator asks, ""Will this lion or these hyenas nearby eat the rhino?!"" Then those predators never do.  The work never says whether rhinos are just too big to be taken down by big cats.
Remember in the late 1990s when many folk said, ""Why does the black Spice Girl have to be named Scary!?!""  I'm a Black American.  I couldn't help but pause when they said, ""White rhinos are docile, but black rhinos are angry.""  It goes on: ""You can differentiate between white and black rhinos by the shape of their lips.""  ""Black rhinos like to watch fights.""  What is this documentary hinting at!?!?!  Hee-hee, just reading into it too much.
This was about African governments moving on their own for positive change.  This did not show environmental groups from other continents telling the locals what to do.  This was about autonomy and self-improvement.
The work never says whether rhinos are related to pigs or hippos.  With their waddling walk and fat butts, they almost reminded me of guinea pigs.  If you are an animal lover, I think you'll really enjoy this work.",1248220800,,1563,4.708487084870849
