283764,5,6300267962,"A great cast, a great script, a great movie. There's a 10- or 15-minute stretch that has one hilarious scene after another, highlighted by Mr. Roberts and the Doc (William Powell) helping Ensign Pulver prepare for a  rendevous with Betsy Palmer.  Ward Bond has a small role in this, and it  always amazed me at how many great movies of all types that he was  in--westerns like the Searchers, plus the Maltese Falcon, Grapes of Wrath,  It Happened One Night, It's A Wonderful Life, Gone With The Wind, Dead End,  etc.",933120000,,516,4.615384615384615
283765,5,6300267962,"This film is a new experience every time I see it.  James Cagny, Henry Fonda and Jack Lemon with the rest of the great supporting cast prove their superb talent in comedy.  An amzazing aspect is that the acting isn't  stilted or forced as are some other films of that era.  It is really a  treat to see real pros do an outstanding job. The story survives the test  of time.",913075200,,373,4.183098591549296

283917,5,6300267962,"I bought the video as a gift, and the recipient was thrilled. It was a movie that has been a favorite of his for years. We watched it together, enjoying a true classic. The film features such stars as Henry Fonda, James Cagney, William Powell, and Jack Lemmon. Toward the end of World War II, a United States Navy cargo ship and her crew are stationed in the Pacific Ocean, seeing little military action, but not being allowed leave by its captain. Lt. Roberts finds a way to  help the men go ashore, and trouble ensues.",1521417600,,520,4.416666666666667

Someone actually gave this one star?  Seriously?  Henry Fonda, Jack Lemmon, and James Cagney at the top of their game.  Even Cagney who was past his gangster days was magnificent as the captain.

284099,5,6300267962,"It's great when a film considered one of the great classics of its decade holds up as well now as it did in the mid 1950's when it was released. It was wildly popular in its day, ending up the second-biggest box office film of 1955. it was nominated for three Academy Awards and won one for newcomer Jack Lemmon's supporting performance as Ensign Pulver. Originally it appeared as a novel of short vignettes by Thomas Heggen that was a best seller (selling over a million copies) in 1946, Heggen was 24 when he signed up after Pearl Harbor and was a Lieutenant on supply ships in the Atlantic and Pacific and knew what he was talking about; he basically was the Henry Fonda character. Heggen and Joshua Logan (w that ho would later co-write and direct south Pacifc) adapted it into a long-running Broadway play that won them tony Award's. Mister Roberts was played by Henry Fonda and it became his signature role.

Though Fonda was a natural choice to play Roberts, Warner Brothers was afraid he had been out of movies too long since Mister Roberts had run for seven years on Broadway. Director John ford insisted on him because he and Fonda had worked on films together in the past. Fonda was the only Broadway carry-over but  group of actors assembled for the film was flawless. James Cagney handled the difficult role of Captain Morton with all the expertise of his long career. The Captain (actually Lieutenant Commander) was a cruel, slave-driving martinet, selfish and ambitious, almost pathologically so yet he couldn't be allowed to become a cartoon villain or a too serious Captain Queeg type. Lemmon played Pulver with just the right mix of laziness, insouciance and fear of even meeting the captain. William Powell was the warm center of the film, a truly wise ship's doctor who gives good advice and is pretty good at mixing up some fake Scotch whiskey. Most of all he tells Roberts he's as valuable on a supply ship with all of its boredom and monotony as he would be if he was on a fighting ship, a lesson that really hits home in the end. This was Powell's final role on film. Frequently this means an actor died soon after but Powell, already 60, lived to be over 90 in comfortable retirement. The rest of the cast were as good in their roles as the principals.

Mister Roberts was the first film about the war that was as much a comedy as it was a drama. This would seem risky, but audiences had warmed to the book in 1946 and the play in '48, so there didn't seem to be a big taboo over this (though funny Nazi's would have to wait until mid-60's TV). What it didn't do was try to mix it with action, the usual subject of war films, which would have made it too serious for the comedy. The film stayed pretty close to the play with almost everything happening on the small set of the ship. The only attempt to open it up was a brief visit to the island hospital and a big scene of Polynesians rowing out to greet the ship when it arrives in a Tahiti-like place. From its appearance you would never suspect this was a troubled production but it vas very troubled indeed. John Ford was a difficult man to get along with and here he was at his worst, getting into fights and arguments with everyone, even Fonda. In interviews, Cagney called him ""A truly nasty old man"". He was fired when he punched Fonda in the jaw and almost simultaneously had a gall bladder attack requiring immediate surgery. The film was finished by Mervin Leroy, who tried to follow ford's intentions (there's still a lot of Ford's traits in the film) and an uncredited Joshua Logan.

Mister Roberts is rewarding to watch today, mostly for its fine acting. Just remember that it is a character driven comedy-drama and not your typical action-packed war film.",1492819200,5,3746,4.528803545051699

284508,5,6300267962,"The times that try men's souls are many, but for Lt. (jg) Doug Roberts they all boil down to one thing: He wants to see combat during World War II but is, instead, stuck on a cargo ship far from the action.
""Mister Roberts"" is an amazing film, a true classic and not just because it has a great cast and is directed by two Hollywood legends.
No, for my money, what makes this film great is its focus on the true unsung heroes of any conflict; the soldiers, sailors, Marines and Air Force personnel who make sure that those doing the fighting have the ammunition and other supplies they need to go into battle. Theirs is thankless duty; they are not taken to the White House and honored for their service when the fighting has ended nor do they come home from the war with a chest full of ribbons. As a former infantryman, however, I can tell you that without them no battles are won and all wars are lost. That's why, when we returned from patrol in Vietnam, we always made sure to pay our respects to the supply sergeants and their men.
That said, this movie has a galaxy of stars starting, of course, with Henry Fonda in one of his best roles. Mister Roberts is the kind of officer we'd all like to serve under; good at his job, compassionate toward the men under his command, and unafraid to challenge bad decisions made by those that outrank him. Fonda plays the part as though he was born to it.
Jack Lemmon as Ensign Frank Pulver is jittery and unsure of himself, although he tries to mask that with bravado. He won an Academy Award for his performance. James Cagney as the ship's overbearing and slightly mad captain brought new meaning to the word ""cantankerous."" In my opinion, however, William Powell as the ship's doctor gave the most memorable performance in the movie. It was understated until near the very end when he gives an impassioned lecture to Fonda about his true value to the crew. This was Powell's last movie, bringing to a close a career that brought him international acclaim and he went out on a very high note.
John Ford directed part of the movie and then was taken ill so Mervyn LeRoy finished it. How fortunate that there was someone of LeRoy's caliber available to step in when needed. Watching the film you would never know two directors helmed it; the transition is seamless.
Excellent cinematography and outstanding writing combined with A-level acting make this movie one of the best ever produced. Highly recommended.",1455667200,13,2455,4.5565610859728505

284921,2,6300267962,"I wish I hadn't re-watched this movie as an adult.  In short, it was all the guys I loved watching from my childhood coming together and acting one of two ways for 130 minutes: uncomfortably pervy and sexist, or very bored and put-upon by their sadistic captain -- who is, like almost everyone in this story, a static character.  No one truly learns from their faults or mistakes in this movie, and I would go so far as to say there are no radically dynamic characters; even though in the end one of the main characters begins to fill the role of his friend, his opinions and character remain very similar, he only decides to stop being such a brown-noser and to start acting on the opinions he had all along (which may or may have even been the correct way to handle things, although it probably was helpful).  There are no real dynamics, or even a good main message to the movie, and so there are precious few changes to suck you in, and most of the plot progressions involve situational changes instead of characters developing.  I think that the writing was really lackluster, because I know all these guys are great actors, yet no real magic really happened throughout.

Again, I think this movie was partially ruined for me by the overt sexism towards women that every single one of the protagonists seemed to wear on his sleeve, which sort of ruined all the scenes that had a chance to be really funny.  This obviously affected me more than anyone else who rated this movie, probably because a lot of these actors were my childhood icons and it's weird for me to see them in that way, and probably because as I mentioned before, no one in this movie really learns anything from their character flaws, so it's not as if it's ever really pointed out that they are being horribly creepy.

 However, I think my statements about this movie are still worth considering: It is riddled with problematic over-sexualization and creepy statements towards/about women (and I feel comfortable saying this is not just because of the time period, given a good 80% of my movies I've seen are Golden Age to 1960s), which ruin otherwise good scenes and are never coalesced into a forward-moving plot; It is kind of boring and its jokes are not great, so that fails to carry it through its other problems; and last (and worst), it relies on primarily situational changes to progress the plot without many internal changes or progression in the characters.

Again, I love all these guys and I wanted so badly to love this movie, but I found it had problems bigger than my will to like it.  I got really bummed out and I wish I hadn't watched it again and ruined my good memories of my two favorite scenes (making scotch and the ending), and I wish I hadn't bought it for my dad and watched it with him because he really didn't enjoy it either (If I could do it again I would have bought Operation Petticoat instead).  I gave this movie 2 stars because I love Powell, Lemmon, and Cagney so much.

I really hope I haven't hurt anyone's sensibilities over this, since I know there is a lot of love for these actors (which I really do share) and for this movie; but if I have, I'm sorry and half of your thoughts about me are probably true, but I'm still standing by this rating, and I'm not telling which half.  Again, sorry for any bruised feelings, I grew up watching all of these guys and I know that they all are legends.",1428537600,,3409,4.4790322580645165

I ordered it last week, came within 48 hours without any special shipping instructions, and when it came I ripped the plastic off of the DVD case, put in my DVD player and sat down in my recliner and chilled. This is a classic with a cast to this day could not be imulated. Powell, Cagney, Fonda and Lemo are perfectly casted and well acted. . All academy award winners!

285304,5,6300267962,"What a great movie this is. Its funny with a lot of great celebs in it, even Patrick Wayne is in it. Its all about a palm tree that is on the ship. The captain (James Cagney) loves this palm tree. The men on board this ship do a lot to this palm tree, so that they don't get to go on leave. Mr. Roberts (Henry Fonda) is very laid back with the men. But he talks back to the captain all the time. He is always writing letters to be put on other ships that are in battle. His letters get turn down by the captain. The men never get to go on leave and Mr. Roberts always disobeys orders and get into trouble himself. One time they docked and the men were already to go on leave and the captain gets on the speaker and tells them they will not be going. So Mr. Roberts goes and argues with the captain. He makes some agreements with the captain and the men get to go aboard.  The men act to bad that the mps bring a lot of them back to the ship. The next day the captain gets called to port and when he gets back, he is mad and tells Mr. Roberts that they are ordered to leave the island. This is because of the men acting so bad. In the end Mr. Roberts gets mad and decides to take that palm tree and throws it over board. The captain goes through all the name to figure out who would do that. Then he gets to Mr. Roberts name and realizes that he is the one that did it. The speaker is on in the captains office and in so many words the men hear what agreements got made. In the end Mr. Roberts gets a letter through and gets on another ship. The men make a metal for him of a palm tree and give it to him. Mr. Roberts writes to the men and tells them that the palm tree metal meant more to him then any metal. Then another letter came letting them know that Mr. Roberts died.

285309,3,6300267962,"It appears that I'm a lone dissenter where ""Mr. Roberts"" is concerned.  I remember seeing it as a child and being impressed by the wide screen but little else.  Revisiting the film today reveals a couple of attributes. William Powell turns in a solid, ""on key"" farewell performance, and Jack Lemmon makes a memorable entrance to the movies in a performance so representative of his vital screen persona that it may be the the film's most redeeming quality, the primary reason for watching it today.  The revelation that, although a natural right-hander, Lemmon deliberately played the role of Ensign Pulver as a left-hander is testimony to the discipline and attention to detail of one of the screen's most explosive, high-energy, charismatic actors.

I can't help but notice that many of the 5-star reviews are from viewers moved more by nostalgia than objective critical evaluation.  Others appear more fixed on the back story of the film's star-studded cast and ""committee"" of all-star film-makers.  The legendary John Ford started filming, but ""jumped ship"" after major disagreements with both James Cagney and Henry Fonda.  At this point the redoubtable and prolific Mervyn LeRoy took control, doing his best to replicate the Ford cinematic style.  Finally, for the more theatrical, dramatic scenes, stage and film director Josh Logan (""Picnic""), a true ""actor's director,"" was brought in to spell LeRoy.

To my eyes none of the above saves the movie from a script as pedestrian as the ""stage bound"" cargo ship on which the ""action"" occurs.  The film was a novel adapted to the stage, then adapted to the screen.  It received nominations from the Academy and turned a handsome profit, in addition to inspiring sequels on the big screen as well as on television.  The reason?  In many respects it's an imitation of modern life, a metaphor for the quiet desperation of the ""average Joe"" who had once dreamt of making meaningful contributions to society and instead finds himself on an insignificant ""cargo ship"" commanded by an oppressive employer. The revelation, at the very end of the film, that Mr. Roberts has finally obtained the promotion he had routinely been denied by an egocentric superior (Cagney) and that he has, moreover, died a hero's death in the battle he had so long and so desperately wanted to fight brings with it less emotion concerning Mr. Roberts than consolation to the average Joe stuck on a cargo ship (""See, look at the fate of heroes at the front"").  Maybe the cargo ship isn't such a bad metaphor for life after all.  But it's still just a cargo ship.

All the good intentions of scriptwriters and Cinemascopic splendor can salvage what is a slow ship, a film without drama or dramatic pacing, lacking in humor and heart, insufficiently focused on any clear conflict or theme. Besides the performances of Powelll and Lemmon, my attention was primarily on Ford's use of the relatively new Cinemascope format, which is striking in its rock-steady, unbroken ""two-shot"" compositions of extended, unedited dialog exchanges (if only modern television drama, with its manipulative, irritatingly busy editing, had learned lasting lessons from Ford).

In sum, the meandering story-line, mundane dialog, and robotic Fonda (as the film's protagonist, or ""Fletcher Christian"") along with a miscast Cagney (as the film's sole antagonist, playing a scrappy but never convincing ""Captain Bligh"") are a recipe for neither drama on the high seas nor diverting humor on the low).  At one time, William Holden and Marlon Brando were candidates for the first role.  Either one would have been an improvement.  If Ford were given his way, and if John Wayne had cooperated, Duke might have played the ship's sole ""villain,"" the draconian Captain--which would have qualified as perhaps the most memorable performance against type in screen history.

But given the enormity of the problems facing this vessel from the outset, even Jack Lemmon's energetic performance--though sufficient to keep this viewer awake--felt like a mere Band-Aid applied to the gaping hole of this sinking ship.",1407628800,,4097,5.121621621621622

My dad had served in the Navy during WWII and could really relate to the story and the characters portrayed in it. After my son was born and became old enough to enjoy movies other than cartoons, my dad introduced him to Mr. Roberts. The movie quickly became a ""go to"" for hilarious quotes and reasons for a grandfather and young grandson to laugh together.  Now that my dad is gone, the movie remains a plethora of fond memories for my now adult son and the all the fun he had watching Mr. Roberts with his grandfather.

285376,4,6300267962,"Completely unrealistic. It was hard to see Cagney play such a stupid role. The guy was a genius. Jack Lemmon was very good in his role, and believeable in spite of the non-realistic events. Henry Fonda was okay in the role, but I would not choose that for him. William Powell seemed to fit right into his role.  Perhaps, because I have always thought of Fonda as a grear actor, and Cagney as a hard to match personality, I was uncomfortable seeing them in these inferior roles. Fonda seemed more bored than boring, so this could be me. Cagney seemed to take his role with a grain of salt, and was good in it. So, I am at a loss; therefore, I am giving it four stars, because none of them were acting poorly, and the movie was what it was given to be. There is nothing disappointing about it.

I bought this, because I liked all these guys. Grapes of Wrath and Yankee Doodle Dandy, remain two of the greatest ever. But we cannot remain the same, nor can they.

A military comprised of the farmer from Omaha, the baker from, Chicago, the schoolteacher from Sacramento.  Truly an all hands effort.

285459,5,6300267962,"It simply doesnt get any better than this.  I was a Mister Roberts type myself (as an Army junior officer), serving under a tyrant (Army major) who treated his soldiers terribly.  I was the guy caught in the middle and doing everything I could to shelter them from a mad man, while looking for every opportunity myself to bail out of that unit.  Ironically when I departed I was heartbroken, and fealt guilty for leaving them behind - just like Mister Roberts in the movie!

Henry Fonda delivers a great performance of a frustrated junior officer, desperate to escape what he believes is a meaningless and fruitless job, as he watches the main battle fleet slide by silently over the horizon one night while on watch.  He wants to be on the shooting end so bad he can taste it, and wrongly believes his service aboard the ""bucket"" is a waste of his time and talent.  Ultimately he gets his way, at the hands of a crew who was more loyal to him than to themselves, and he learns tragically at the end just how important they were to him.

Jack Lemon is just as awesome as he evolves from a bachelor extraordinaire and lazy junior officer into the man who first blows up the ship's laundry, and ultimately takes on the mantle of leadership to confront the captain at the end of the movie - thus stepping up to take Mr. Robert's place as the crew's champion.

Dont expect bombs and strafing runs.  This isn't a war movie in that sense.  It is a movie about a war of values on board a tiny ship with a very dull but important job in the back waters of the WWII Pacific.  There's plenty of humor laced into the movie - mostly surrounding the hapless Ensigne Pulver (Jack Lemon) and the liberty starved crew.  And yes, the good guys eventually win!

You can't help but feel for Mister Roberts, while also realizing at the same time that every soldier, whether he/she is stationed at a supply point or is in the front lines, does his or her part - all parts contribute to the whole.

285578,5,6300267962,"This is a brilliant war-time comedy with some more serious elements included towards the end. Below more of my impressions, with some limited spoilers.

1. Origins

""Mister Roberts"" was first a novel, written in 1946 by Thomas Heggen, a young veteran of Pacific War, just discharged after serving succesively on board of two auxiliary warships, attack cargo ship USS ""Virgo"" and cargo ship USS ""Rotanin"". This brilliantly written and hilariously funny book became instantly a bestseller and in 1948 was adapted into a Broadway play, already with Henry Fonda in the main role. The production run for 1157 performances and finally in 1955 Hollywood produced a film version.

2. The film.

I do not want to reveal too much about the story, so let's just say that everything happens on board of a cargo ship requisitioned for duration of war by US Navy and named USS ""Reluctant"" - quite obviously in reality there never was a US Navy ship carrying such a name... The commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Morton (James Cagney) is a petty tyrant, of limited intellect and ability and as ridiculous as he is vicious, but certainly decided to make the life of everybody on board a living hell, when in the same time obsequiously crawling in front of any superior officer.

Morton relies for most of real work on his very able executive officer, Lieutenant Junior Grade Douglas Roberts (Henry Fonda), whom everybody adresses with the utmost respect as ""Mister Roberts"". Two more characters are important - an annoying, slightly pathetic slacker and self proclaimed Casanova, Ensign Frank Pulver (Jack Lemmon) and an aging medical officer, a Lieutenant we know only as ""Doc"" (William Powell). The role of Ensign Pulver brought to Jack Lemmon his first Oscar (Best Supporting Role) and this character is certainly something you don't see every day...)))

Two more things play an important role in this film: a palm that Morton received as trophy from the Admiral for delivering ""more toothpaste and toilet paper than any other cargo ship in the whole Pacific theater"" and Mister Roberts repeated, daily requests for a transfer to a destroyer, as he simply cannot stand anymore to stay on board of the USS ""Reluctant"" and delivering toilet paper when a real war is fought by others...

3. My impressions

This is a masterpiece of comedy, subtly mixed with some drama. Watching it was a delight and I guarantee that quite soon in the film you will get emotionally involved: you will root for Mister Roberts, the ""Doc"" and the whole crew, you will want to bitchslap a couple of times Ensing Pulver and you will certainly want to STRANGLE Morton - if possible after sticking his infamous palm tree up his bum...)))

The humour shown in this film is very, very superior to most of things we can see nowadays on the screen as it relies mostly on brilliant dialogs, avoids foul language and is especially very humane and much gentler than what we can see in so many modern ""comedies"" - even the abominable Morton is more a moron than a monster and at some moments we are more enclined to feel pity for him than pure hatred...

The best comic moments are those during the liberty granted finally to the crew on a French controlled tropical island - believe me, you WANT to see this part!

Towards the end the film becomes for a moment more serious - and actually that only adds to its charm...

Bottom line, this is a GREAT moment of cinema! Grab some popcorn in one hand and Morton's palm tree in the other and sail with USS ""Reluctant"" to the Pacific to travel ""from apathy to tedium with occasional side trips to monotony and ennui"", when in the same ROARING with laughter.

The movie tells the story of a supply ship that is anchored in the middle of nowhere and, in the minds of the crew, does nothing and goes nowhere. The executive officer, who is in charge of cargo loading, is played by Henry Fonda who had played that part on stage over 1,500 times before making the movie, and the Captain of this unfortunate vessel is played by James Cagney.

Other cast members include Jack Lemmon as Ens. Pulver, a role that won him an Oscar for best supporting actor; William Powell as Doc, and Ward Bond as Chief Petty Office Dowdy.

The ship used in the making of the movie appears to have been the USS Hewell with modification made to create the deck for the palm tree.

285642,4,6300267962,"The second of only two movies the great director John Ford took from plays, this one, written for the Broadway stage by Joshua Logan, won Jack Lemmon his first Oscar as the mischievous Ensign Pulver. Henry Fonda plays the title role, Lieutenant (junior grade) Doug Roberts, a man who longs for a combat assignment but instead must endure the boredom of a supply ship in the backwaters of World War II in the Pacific. Both are foils to James Cagney's Captain Morton - which he played so wonderfully by evoking Ford's personality - who's a stickler for the rules and a royal pain in the butt. So Roberts channels his frustration into standing up to the captain on behalf of the ship's crew. Most of the story is played for laughs - particularly a recurring incident involving Morton's treasured potted palm tree - but there is one heartbreaking moment.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime-2014-edition/dp/B00HU8VK4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)</a>",1378857600,,1101,5.84472049689441

285826,5,6300267962,"Mister Roberts is a different kind of war film. The movie revolves around Lt. JG Doug Roberts (played perfectly by Henry Fonda) who serves on board the USS Reluctant, a supply ship known to the crew as ""the Bucket."" The ship provides the cargo needed by other ships enroute to the combat area of the Pacific during WWII. The Reluctant itself remains far from the action, day after day, with no excitement or anything to look forward to.

Mister Roberts wants to see action. He joined the Navy because he believed in what America was fighting for. However, his assignment is on the Reluctant and the captain of the ship, Lt. Commander Morton (played extremely well by James Cagney), will not release him for combat duty. The movie is very well-paced, has some really funny scenes (Jack Lemmon and William Powell providing many of the laughs) and is a thoroughly enjoyable film. I had not seen this movie since watching it with my Dad maybe 20 years ago and enjoyed it almost as well this time as I did then.

This movie illustrates how war isn't all action, and explosions, and graphic wounds.... a lot of it is tedium and boredom and just being there and getting the job that needs done, done. Not only is it a great war film, it is a NECESSARY war film.",1365984000,,1254,4.5198237885462555

285936,5,6300267962,"This is one of my all-time favorites. It makes you laugh and cry.

LtJG Doug Roberts serves aboard ""the bucket,"" but wants a transfer so he can get ""in the war."" He repeatedly requests a transfer, writing about ""disharmony"" on the ship. Capt Morton forwards his requests disapproved because of the ""stupid regulation"" which allows transfer requests. Roberts also confides in the ship's doctor and the officer, Ensign Frank Pulver. Pulver is hilarious and actually avoids the captain all he can, so much that he doesn't even recognize him. The doc provides the sage advice, much like that of a loving uncle. All characters are enjoyable and understandable in their own ways.

The four leading men all score big in this film. Henry Fonda plays Roberts, James Cagney plays the captain, William Powell (in his last film) plays the ship's doctor, and Jack Lemmon (Oscar winner) plays Ensign Pulver. Other characters also give a great performance.

It seems to be a realistic portrayal of the boring life on a cargo ship. The men all have their own creative ways to keep themselves going.

Mister Roberts is also about the teamwork and loyalty that men in the service develop over time. And the teamwork and loyalty is always convincing.

Movies like Mr. Roberts and Donovan's Reef have inspired me to some day acquire a tropical tan.  In Mr. Roberts an excellent cast does what they are all good at; acting.  Henry Fonda displays that rare ability he had to make you share his feelings and dreams.  In time you want him to be off that boat almost as much as he does.  William Powell closes his career with a fine and touching performance as the ship's doctor.  Newcomer (seems strange to say that!) Jack Lemmon plays the perfect gold brick, totally out of his element on a Navy supply ship.  And veteran James Cagney gets it right as the frustrated Merchant Marine captain trying to make his name in the backwater Navy.  I save some movies for rainy days but this one is good anytime!  Oh, it's also one of the reasons why I like old movies better than the drivel that passes for entertainment today!",1361664000,7,979,4.455056179775281

The spoken rebellion to asinine authority (Namely the Captain played by James Cagney) . The unquestioning loyalty to Mister Roberts. The camaraderie with the usual friction among common sailors who've been at sea too long. The humor that can come from the strangest places provided mostly by Ensign Pulver (e.g. ""making scotch""). The sadness of loss and resultant bravado. I would certainly recommend this movie to anyone who wishes to be part of the crew because while you're watching it you can identify with some character.",1360454400,,662,5.027272727272727

William Powell, in his last film role, is funny, moving and noble as the ship's doctor. James Cagney is controlling and nasty as Captain Morton. Jack Lemmon, in his Oscar winning role as Ensign Pulver is both funny and interesting.

286065,2,6300267962,"Generally I really love these old WWII type movies but this was neither comical or adventurous or poignant or anything.

Henry Fonda is the only good things about this movie - playing a (rank?) serving under James Cagney who is a HORRIBLE actor in my opinion, but I'm not sure anyone else in his role would've made the movie any better.  Cagney is a nobody who was evidently treated as such his whole life and somehow managed to work his way up the ranks to having command of his own vessel.  They basically serve as a supply ship and therefore never really get IN the war - which bothers Fonda to no end. Fonda keeps putting in for a transfer in hopes of getting on a ship that will see some action, so he doesn't feel so useless. Would feel he did his part.

Cagney treats the crew like slaves, morale sucks but the guys appreciate the small things Fonda does for them (like letting them get away without wearing shirts when they're sweating to death - whereas Cagney demands proper dress from them regardless).  The men are sorely in need of some R&R and haven't had it in well over a year.  Fonda finally gets it for them and they cause as much trouble on shore leave as they humanly can.

Lemmon's character is useless and annoying and is supposed to be comic relief but doesn't pull it off.

POOR writing, bad story and Lemmon and Cagney just made it that much worse.  There was perhaps 10 min of interesting footage in this film.  I was sorely disappointed and would NOT recommend.  There are MANY other war movies out there that ARE good - look elsewhere for those.  Pass this stinker up.",1345507200,3,1596,4.409556313993174

With a cast that resembles a list of the top stars in its era (50's), it gives a fairly accurate, and often humorous, depiction of the tedious life on a navy supply ship during war time.

286070,4,6300267962,"As you probably know, Hollywood had a great time making movies about World War II once it was over, including some fine comedy. This was one of the best.

Henry Fonda is Mister Roberts, executive officer aboard a cargo ship in the Pacific that has James Cagney as the worst captain we've ever known. He has this palm tree . . . Jack Lemmon is the junior officer, Ensign Pulver, who has a reputation as the laziest and most girl-crazy member of the Navy. William Powell is the Doc.

The captain hates Mister Roberts, and the feeling is quite mutual. Roberts has been putting in requests for transfer every week since anyone can remember, and the captain routinely disapproves them and sends them on. He wants to keep Roberts because the award that earned him the palm tree was really earned by Roberts and the crew, and he knows it. He wants to get credit for how effective the crew is, but he won't give them shore leave. So Roberts ends by making a ""pact with the devil,"" you might say, to get the crew shore leave on a Pacific Island which has a fictional name and greatly resembles Tahiti.

OK, I'm not going to give you the whole story here, but those who remember this one from Saturday afternoon movies on TV as a child will remember the fate of the palm tree, I am sure.

286134,4,6300267962,"The movie takes place during the waning days of WWII aboard a cargo ship that maneuvers around the ""backwaters"" of the war.  The crew is a bit lazy and cantankerous, but much of this can be attributed to the policy of no liberty call in any port.  The captain of the ship (played by James Cagney) is overly strict, ruthless and self-serving.  He cares nothing for his crew:  his only concern is to someday get a promotion out of his maritime command.

A junior officer (portrayed by Henry Fonda) wants desperately to get transferred to a vessel that is in the ""thick"" of the western Pacific action.  He has also had enough of the ""no fun rule"" imposed by his commanding officer.  Whenever he can, he goes to bat on behalf of the crew by squaring off with the tyrannical captain.

Having been in the Navy myself, I can assure you that sailors (both enlisted & officers alike) can & DO act every bit as sophomoric as they do in the present movie!

By today's standards, this film would be rendered by many to be sexist as it depicts women as being ignorant of the Navy's rank structure ~ even though the women are in the military themselves.  However, that is a rather minor criticism, and it must be remembered that women play a much more significant role in the military today (including combat missions) than they did in the 1950s.

All in all, this is a film that is highly recommended for anyone who has either been in the Navy or enjoys Naval movies.  The former will, like myself, likely find the story rather nostalgic.",1286236800,2,1931,4.904615384615385

Doug Roberts of the USS RELUCTANT, the ship awarded a palm tree in recognition of its exemplary duty in delivering more toothpaste and toilet paper than any other supply ship in the Safe Area of the Pacific. Mr. Roberts is bored to death on the RELUCTANT. In April 1945, his biggest fear is that he'll miss the shooting war, which has worked its way across the Pacific to Okinawa.

The RELUCTANT is captained by Jimmy Cagney, who turns in the best performance of his career as a tyrannical bantam rooster of a man obsessed only with making brownie points with Command. Cagney's acting is so fine and his character is so despicable that I avoided watching any other Cagney movies for years. Cagney is fixated on the potted palm tree, which he ritualistically waters twice a day; he refuses his crew any Liberty; and he hates Mr. Roberts, ""a smart College Boy."" Mr. Roberts responds with a pattern of subtle insubordination. The palm tree occasionally walks the plank in retribution for the Captain's actions.

Mr. Roberts' allies are Ensign Pulver (Jack Lemmon in an Oscar-winning role), and Doc (William Powell in his last role). Pulver is a happy-go-lucky schemer whose schemes never materialize; Doc is the Wise Elder. The rest of the crew play anonymous supporting roles.

Mr. Roberts' only dream is to be transferred. The Captain sadistically denies every request, taking great pleasure in torturing Mr. Roberts. Mr. Roberts finally agrees to stop asking for transfers if only the Captain grants the crew Liberty. The Captain further demands that Mr. Roberts toe his hard line.

After the crew's riotous Liberty call, Mr. Roberts suddenly and seemingly inexplicably becomes a martinet, briefly, until the crew discovers what he has done for them. They repay his favor, much to the Captain's outrage, surreptitiously arranging the long wished-for transfer. Mr. Roberts gets his war. The RELUCTANT crewmen, having checkmated the Captain, begin to assert themselves. The palm tree goes swimming yet again as Pulver breaks out of his shell.

This is a wonderful mature comedy about personal loyalty and virtues such as honor and bravery, a movie that should not be missed.",1282435200,,2413,4.931034482758621

Lemmon is wonderful as the irrepressible junior officer, Ensign Pulver, trying to be a normal young man, prove his ability to stand up for himself, and survive in the oppressive environment created by the ship's Captain.

Henry Fonda and William Powell are priceless as the older, wiser, and more settled officers seeking to both provoke and settle down Pulver.

Cagney is completely believable as the bitter Captain whose idea of having a taut ship is to make sure everyone on board is miserable as often as possible.

This film is a series of amusing vignettes woven around Mr. Roberts desire to get off the cargo ship and ""into the shooting war"", where he feels he can make a difference.

The ending is poignant in the face of war, and at the same time uplifting in its portrayal of the maturing Pulver.

286163,1,6300267962,"Beware, this review contains spoilers, but not for this movie - don't read this review if you haven't yet seen ""The Caine Mutany"".

  I loved Mister Roberts when I first saw it in on TV in High School.  I rewatched this DVD recently, not long after watching that other WWII classic ""The Caine Mutany"".  Suddenly, after thirty years, I realized what ""Mister Roberts"" is - it is Keefer's book.
You remember Keefer? He is the meddling, college-educated passive-aggressive sit-down artist whose disloyalty to everybody and everything is real cause of the Caine Mutany.

Keefer is amazing.  He is simultaneously offended that everyone does not defer to his superior judgment and intellect but unwilling to take and initiative or the slightest responsibility for anything, even for his own opinions.  Of course, keefer feels snubbed that he is assigned to a mere minesweeper like the Caine, which gives him an excuse to shirk his duties.  The ship isn't important enough to merit his effort. Keefer tears down everyone else's efforts, opposes the way everything is done, harps on everyone else's mistakes, but also opposes every reform, and is a master at stirring up conflicts among the other officers and between the men and the officers.

  Naturally, Keefer is writing a book about his experiences in the war, a book in which a wise sensitive officer, beloved by everybody, is persecuted by ignorant and heartless authority.

  My friend, this is how you should watch this DVD.  First watch the Canine Mutany.  It is a great movie.  If you haven't seen it in while, it is worth another look.  Then watch ""Mr. Roberts"", keeping in mind  Keefer's self-image.  You might notice some things.  Notice how everybody loves and respects Mr. Roberts, even though Mr. Roberts never does anything to earn anybody's respect. I guess they just sense his wisdom, superiority,  manly good looks, and admire him for the eloquence he exhibits in his constant complaining, or the saintly purity of his good intentions.  Notice Mister Roberts wants desperately to transfer to a battleship, but just to be near the ""action"", not to actually do any work on the battleship that will help the war effort, since his training is as a cargo officer.

  Then, at the end of ""Mister Roberts"", when the credits are over and after you have dried your tears, go back and rewatch the climax of ""The Caine Mutany"".  I don't mean the court scene, when Humphrey Bogart cracks on the stand and starts rolling his steel balls and muttering about strawberries.  That is not the climax.  The climax is later when the crippled Jewish lawyer offers a toast to Keefer, the best toast in the history of cinema, and that is despite it being a watered down, censored version of the even better toast which is in Wouk's novel.

  The lawyer lays out Keefers character, attitudes and accomplishments, and finishes by tossing his drink right smack in Keefer's eye.

  Take that, Mister Roberts!",1275091200,13,2944,4.900608519269777

While the Japanese and French filmmakers devoted themselves to explore the dreadful effects of the war on the human soul, UK and USA made about this issue a formidable device to carve in relief the fine irony and subtle humor.

Two outstanding movies were remarkable in this sense: Stalag 17 and ;Mister Roberts. Such films focused around the meaning of the antihero as driving force by action or omission before the well known rules of game.

Lt. Roberts (Henry Fonda) is an eager officer who really wants to be transferred to the fighting zone rather than serve on a cargo ship bearing the caprices of a bitter captain (James Cagney)  who ardently wishes to be promoted to Commandant before the war ends, who enjoys with a potted palm tree that reminds him own piece of paradisiacal island. This frustration is more than compensated when he works out as a charismatic leader with the crew, permitting them certain non formal liberties, against the established rules.

Supported by the vessel's medic (William Powell in his last appearance on screen)and the young and irreverent officer Pulver (Jack Lemmon) who eventually will become his alter ego.

Somehow this movie is the opposite side of the coin respect ""The Bounty Monty"" . There are clever and laughable situations that deals with the indomitable thirst of power.

The twist of fate confers the film of a sudden and unexpected dramatic finale that makes us to rethink the fatality making its entry as uninvited protagonist.

286187,3,6300267962,"Okay, I know all you purists will jump up and down when I say this movie could benefit from a remake, especially considering the ensemble cast of the original version.  The movie shows one man's struggle against arbitrarily exercised power (Fonda standing up to the less-educated and self-absorbed commanding officer, played by Cagney), but some aspects of the movie, stemming no doubt from social conventions when it was made, just don't fly today.  Antics of the crew during their overnight liberty ashore were portrayed as just good-natured fun that got a little out of hand - today, some of those antics would have easily resulted in felony prosecutions.  Also, lots of niggling little details detract from the movie -- for example, in one scene, the ship is moving quickly through the water, but it's obvious there's no one on the brightly lit bridge (which would be lit with red-lensed lights to preserve night vision) in control of the ship's movements -- also, waves being thrown up alongside the boat are a) much too high for the sea state and size of the ship, and b) going BACKWARDS from the way they should be splashing - unless the ship was going at high speeds backwards.  And Jack Lemmon's plan to put a high explosives ""firecracker"" under the CO's bunk - in addition to sounding too much like fragging during the VietNam conflict (junior soldiers throwing live hand grenades in the tents of sleeping officers they disliked), and is clearly disproportionate.  Powell is great, as are Fonda, Cagney and Lemmon.",1255564800,2,1524,4.891472868217054
286188,4,6300267962,"Based on the /46 novel and a /48 Broadway play of the same name,Mister Roberts came to the screen in July of/55. A good movie and a TV staple since the 60s(actually remade into a short lived TV series then),you would think Warner Brothers would have had the chutzpah to release it to DVD in a little better condition than they have here;but more on that later.
The movie stars James Cagney as Capt. Morton,Henry Fonda as Mister Roberts,Jack Lemmon as Ensign Pulver,William Powell as Doc and a wonderful cast of supporting players.
The story takes place in WW2 aboard a supply ship which plies the back waters of the Pacific. Mister Roberts desperately wants into the war having had it with being a bridesmaid but never a bride,so to speak. Every week he hands in a transfer request to the irrascable Capt. Morton and every week it's rejected. This goes on throughout the whole movie and at one point Roberts makes a bargain with the Captain to stop writing transfers so the crew would finally get their first shore leave in over a year. Pulver is a general no show around the ship,preferring to stick in his cabin and planning to do things he never carries out. By total accident he bumps into the Captain who doesn't even know he's been aboard the ship for 14 months! As the film winds along we see and easily sympathize with the crew and Roberts'frustration at the actions and taciturn nature and demeanour of the Captain. In the end Roberts finally gets a transfer off the ship,but suffers a cruel twist of fate.
The movie moves at a good clip generally and the personnels' various frustrations with their superiors and /or themselves builds nicely throughout. All the stars were in good form here with Lemmon getting a best supporting actor Oscar and it was unfortunately to be screen veteran William Powell's last role.
Now onto the worst part of this DVD release and that is the print itself. Generally speaking I would say most of the print is quite clear and the colours and contrast are in pretty good shape throughout. However Warners does need to go back to the original film elements,work on them and remaster this film;as it should have been done here. Two major spots are of concern to me:
There is a scene where Pulver accompanies Roberts over to the island the ship has been anchored in front of,at the beginning of the movie. In a shot of about 10-12 seconds in length,Pulver is seen in the middle of the shot with nurses flanking him on either side. The film goes quite out of focus for the entire length of the shot then goes back to normal afterwards. The focus seems to waver as if the film has been slightly warped in that particular spot.
There is another spot where Roberts and Doc are sitting in the cabin talking,not that far past the former scene,when the film quickly jumps,as a bad spot shoots by. Either dirt,blemish or film defect of some kind.
There are a few other spots where the focus goes only slightly in and out but Cinemascope is notorious for this kind of thing(especially at the extreme edges),so overall I found them to be of an acceptable level. Had the film consisted of just these kinds of things I would have given the film a complete passing grade.
It looks to me like those in charge of this release at Warner's thought the two spots I brought up(and they just HAVE to know about them)was good enough,not worth the effort to fix and sent it out. Well this type of thinking and its' resultant product,if you know me from any of my reviews,is totally unacceptable. If you're going to release anything,release it in the best possible condition you can. Considering the price of this release,which is above average in cost,it is even more puzzling why they would allow this to pass.
Furthermore beware that this is a dreaded double-sided disc,so much more prone to scratching and scuffing. They apparently couldn't get all the extras on one side. Those extras include production notes,the trailer,commentary by Lemmon,a clip from ""Toast of the Town"" with some of the cast and a an excerpt from ""Fonda on Fonda"" where he discusses his role in the movie.
Oh yes,the only thing that WAS apparently remastered here was the sound,which was done so into Dolby 5.1.
In conclusion a good and quite enjoyable movie in most respects that all will enjoy but the DVD print used here is less than satisfactory. Although most of the print looks quite good there are trouble spots that in my oppinion go beyond the pale and are unacceptable for a release of this stature and cost to the consumer.

286216,5,6300267962,"ESSENTIAL MOVIE!!! Henry Fonda finally returned to the silver screen after an eight year absence to star in Mister Roberts. The movie is an adaption of the Broadway play in which he portrayed the same role. Mister Roberts takes place in the closing months of WWII but it's as much a comedy as it is a drama. John Ford directed some of the film & was replaced by Mervyn LeRoy who finished it.

Lt. Doug Roberts (Henry Fonda) is the chief cargo officer of the Reluctant, a supply ship in the U.S. navy, a true derelict of a ship if there ever was one. He's anxious to get transferred to another ship so that he can get combat duty. All of his requests for transfer are denied by the Captain (James Cagney) because he views it as an insult to his less than illustrious record. Cagney is absolutely superb in his role. The entire crew despises the Captain while they adore Mr. Roberts. Mr. Roberts is constantly looking out for the crew which causes the Captain to countermand every order or allowance given by Mr. Roberts.

Ensign Frank Pulver (Jack Lemmon in an Oscar winning role for Best Supporting Actor) almost steals the movie. He's served on the Reluctant for over a year & has never come face to face with the Captain. He's the laundary officer & he's done his best to avoid any & all duties & especially not ever being seen by the Captain. When they finally meet the Captain asks him who he is & what he does. Pulver tells him & the Captain can only tell him to use a little less starch.

William Powell, in his final role (best known for his Thin Man movies), is Doc, an older naval officer just trying to get to retirement. Doc is the father-figure for Mr. Roberts, the one he turns to for advice, much as thecrew does to Mr. Roberts. In one of the film's classic scenes we see Doc, Mr. Roberts & Pulver ""mix"" up some Scotch. After they sample is Roberts says it doesn't taste right & adds that Scotch tastes a lot like iodine. So Doc adds a dash of real iodine & the concoction is complete.

Finally, after much scheming, Mr. Roberts gets his transfer to combat duty & we never see him again. Before he leaves, the crew makes up an award, the Honor of the Palm Leaf (referring to the Captain's beloved palm tree), & bestows it on Mr. Robeets. There's an occasional letter from him which the whole crew wants to hear. Then , in one of Hollywood's greatest heart-touching scenes, comes a letter telling them of Mr. Roberts death in combat. The entire crew, except for the Captain, mourn his passing away. In a moment of sheer inspiration, Ensign Pulver deigns to be the Captain's new nemesis. He throws the palm tree overboard & the Captain now knows he has another ""Mr. Roberts"".

The cast is star-studded including Ward Bond, Nick Adams, Ken Curtis, Philip Carey, Patrick Wayne, Tige Andrews, Harry Carey, Jr. & Martin Milner. Mister Roberts had three Academy Award nominations: Best Movie, Best Sound & Best Supporting Actor (the only win).

Released in '55 it was in many ways a tribute to the WW II generation, thanking them not only for their bravery and self-sacrifice, but for their continued humor and ability to laugh at themselves even in times of tremendous hardship.

`Mr. Roberts' has it all; expert direction and cinematography, sharp, incisive script with numerous unforgettable, quotable lines and a cast of Hollywood's finest. How could you go wrong with the likes of Henry Fonda, James Cagney, William Powell and Jack Lemmon complimented by a magnificent supporting cast which includes the Ward Bond.

""Mr. Roberts"" began as a stage play, but was beautifully expanded to wide-screen, perfectly cast, and excellently directed. From boredom to tedium and back, this crew moves cargo around the Pacific, but has no chance at heroism. Henry Fonda's title character engages in combat with his captain when he sticks up for the rights of his men, and James Cagney fights back but fights dirty. The tone of this long film is mostly comic, until the end, but it is a tribute to all those who served their country in the war without medals, or glamor, or even much danger. Their enemies were military bureaucracies...our own. Yet their service deserves respect, and ""Mr. Roberts"" gives that to them.

286283,5,6300267962,"War is 99% boredom and 1% sheer panic. This movie tells a wonderful story of a 'college boy' Navy Officer who can't get out from under the thumb of an up from the ranks - hardscrabble poor boy Commander who makes life a living hell - trying to bend this officer to his will AND make Captain before the war is over. One needs to remember that when this was filmed - college educations were not as common as they are now - and from the depths of the depression going into WWII even less so. Cagney utters his classic lines - I join in - riotious laughter throughout our household. Classic!!!!!!!!

Filmed in a way to resemble a stage play (from which it was derived), close quarters all, the crew of a ""tub"" of a Navy supply ship exists amidst the boredom humidity and heat of rear area logistics bases in the South Pacific. Henry Fonda gives a career performance in his role of a patriot yearning for combat - Jimmy Cagney, the commander - threatened by the presence of a popular officer who sacrifices for his men. A very young Jack Lemmon - 'Ensign Pulver' who stayed invisable on a 300 foot ship for 14 months as a ""morale and laundry"" officer. All done very nicely indeed!

As we all said in the military - be careful what you wish for - an anti-climatic ending to a wonderful portrayal of the WWII United States Citizen/Sailor who gets his wish for combat transfer.

A sub-title for this movie might be '4 officers and a Palm Tree!'

286284,5,6300267962,"I was fortunate to have seen the AFI Lifetime Achievement Award bestowed to Henry Fonda for his career full of memorable films given to him in the late 70's. In that particular ceremony, Mister Roberts was featured prominently and rightfully so as it was one of his most memorable roles. At the end of the show, getting inspiration to one of the classic scenes of the movie, those who attended and paid tribute to Mister Fonda that ranges from Bette Davis to Barbra Stanwyck, to Jimmy Stewart and to Ensign Pulver himself Jack Lemmon, one by one stood up and did the ""Goodnight, Mister Roberts"" from the movie but it was adapted in the ceremony by changing it to ""Goodnight, Mister Fonda"". That was one beautiful moment.

Mister Roberts (Fonda) was the cargo officer of a battle ship that does not happen to participate in actual battles. He is considered a hero by the crew and one of the reasons was that he was the only one who can fight back the cruel captain played by James Cagney. Mister Robert's kindness and camaraderie to the crew was exploited by the captain to control Mister Robert's subordination at the expense of Mister Robert's goal to be transferred in the battlefield. But of course the crew made sure that won't happen.

Henry Fonda was perfect. I can't think of anyone who could play the title character with the dignity and quiet heroism that he showed in the movie. Jack Lemmon stole some scenes and I was truly delighted to see his unique comic timing that became so distinctively associated with him. James Cagney, played the captain with such ""barking"" intensity you'll hate his guts.

This is one of my all time favorite movies and I highly recommend it.

Jack Lemmon is very funny playing one of the laziest people you could ever hope to meet.

286321,5,6300267962,"If there was ever a perfect film adaptation of a stage play, with a perfect cast and perfect direction, then MISTER ROBERTS is it.  Very popular in its original 1948 Broadway production, Thomas Heggen and Joshua Logan's play MISTER ROBERTS tells the funny, touching, painful, and ultimately tragic story of Doug Roberts, cargo officer of the RELUCTANT, a supply ship floating through the South Pacific during WWII.  Roberts, feeling frustrated in what he sees as a useless job, yearns to be in the middle of battle, making his young life mean something.  While diligently writing letters in an effort to get himself transferred off of the RELUCTANT, Roberts spars with the ship's selfish Captain and finally makes a weighty personal sacrifice for the sake of the ""guys"" in the crew, by whom he is respected and always referred to as ""Mister.""  But with V-E Day fast approaching, will Mister Roberts stand a chance at making an even greater sacrifice for the sake of his country?  The answer, coming as it does in the last moments of the movie, will shock you.
Henry Fonda, star of the original Broadway production, unforgettably recreates his role here.  He is advised by the wise ""Doc"" of William Powell and amused by his roommate and friend Ensign Frank Pulver (Jack Lemmon), who is cowardly in everything but love and who would rather lie about in his cabin than fight.  The direction of John Ford and Mervyn Le Roy  strikes an ideal balance between scenes set in such close quarters as Pulver and Robert's cabin and that of the Captain (James Cagney) and expansive views of the dazzling Pacific, making the restlessness of Roberts and most of the rest of the crew (only Pulver has fun on the RELUCTANT) palpable.  Franz Waxman's (SUNSET BOULEVARD) musical score, with its memorable main theme, adds just the right light-hearted touch and, in the movie's later scenes, sense of gravity and foreboding.  I cannot repeat enough times that MISTER ROBERTS is a great film, flawlessly cast.",1111363200,8,1988,4.8898809523809526
286322,5,6300267962,"This excellent war comedy/movie will always be one of my personal favorites. Based on the WWII guideline, the basic premise is a rather anal boat captain trying to make ""ship shape"" a merchant/transport type ship. (in the Pacific).

From an original play of Broadway, starring Hendy Fonda to the big screen. (My parents saw this Play on Broadway on their honeymoon and I still have the Playbill) So naturally I am biased.

Start with an assembled cast second to none.

Henry Fonda (Wry humor..this movie IS him.)

William Powell (The thin man returns...his sarcasm is perfect here)

James Cagney (Does his talent ever end? One of his best roles)

Lemmon (Ensign Pulver), shows his talent  for the site gag and, lets say, driftiness, early. This perfomance spawned a few sequels on Pulver alone.

If you were ever in the Navy, you will see Cagney's Performance as uncanny, and see a little bit of each actor in your own experience.

First, I commend them for the inclusion of the excerpt of an Ed Sullivan ""Toast of the Town"" (1948) tribute episode featuring the movie's stars. This was really interesting viewing.
However, for the movie itself....this is the worst Warner release I have seen since ""National Velvet"". The picture frequently becomes out of focus, and the picture is often very undefined throughout the whole movie. There are a couple of places in the movie where the picture jumps, as if the film from which the transfer was taken ""skipped a sprocket"".
Overall, this is an embarassing release of a classic movie....despite the great extras which are included. Warner needs to go back to the drawing board on this one.",1090108800,30,876,4.925675675675675

You see aircraft carriers, battleships and destroyers but they are off in the distance.  This movie is set on a cargo ship (of all places).  It deals with the efforts of one man trying to get into the war and his battles with his tyrannical commanding officer who was played brilliantly by James Cagney.
I'd have to say the best scene in the movie is when the SP guy is telling about the things the crew did on the island during liberty.  But the coolest scene is the look on James Cagney's face at the end of the movie.
This one is one that I can watch over and over again.",1054339200,2,732,4.2
286347,5,6300267962,"Watching this again many years after I first saw it, I expected to be disappointed.  After all, the great films of our youth sometimes turn out to be something less than we had imagined.  But Mister Roberts does not disappoint.  This is one of the gems of the American cinema, a poignant comedy featuring a multitudinously clever and delightful script by Frank Nugent and Joshua Logan from a novel by Thomas Heggen made into a play by Logan and Heggen that ran for many years on Broadway.  The movie features sterling performances from Henry Fonda, James Cagney, William Powell and Jack Lemmon.  Fonda is particularly brilliant in the kind of role from which legends are made.  (He also played the part on Broadway.) You can take all your John Wayne classics and toss them overboard with the Captain's palm tree.  Henry Fonda as Lt (j.g.) Doug Roberts, cargo officer of the USS Reluctant, shines forth as the noblest hero of them all.  He is a quiet, strong, fair, courageous man in a story sure to mist up your eyes even if you're watching it for the twentieth time.

Jack Lemmon won a supporting Oscar for his performance as Ensign Pulver, a kind of lazy, but slyly resourceful Walter Mitty type who talks a great game but never follows through...  James Cagney is the Captain, a sour, resentful man who mercilessly badgers Mister Roberts and grossly neglects the morale of his crew.  He is just perfect.  The way he bellows ""Mister Roberts!"" or way he trembles out the line, ""Mister...Mister...this time you've gone too far"" delights the audience.  William Powell, in his last film, plays the ship's wise and ever diplomatic doc with graceful precision.

Marty (1955) starring Ernest Borgnine, a kind of politically correct (for its time) love story about ordinary folk, won the Academy's honor for best picture in 1956, the year Mister Roberts was nominated.  Henry Fonda, in perhaps his most beloved and certainly one of his finest performances, was not even nominated.  Incidentally, Hollywood legend John Ford directed, but fell ill and Mervyn LeRoy--no slouch himself (e.g., The Bad Seed, 1956; No Time for Sergeants, 1958, etc.)--finished up.

There are a number of memorable scenes in the film, the kind recalled with delight.  My favorite involves the crew, their binoculars and the nurses.  I also loved the careful concocting of the ""scotch whiskey"" by Doc.  The weekly letters requesting a transfer, the Hoot Gibson films we (thankfully) never see, the ever worshipful palm tree, Pulver's marbles in a tobacco tin that he shakes in Roberts's face, vowing to prove his manhood by putting them in the captain's overbin, his ""firecracker,"" his ""If I could be with you/One hour tonight/To do the things I might/I'm telling you true/I'd be anything but blue,"" the giddy nurses, and the infamous liberty are other unforgettable bits.  But more than anything, what makes this a great movie, are the indelible characters so very true to our experience, and how nicely they meld and contrast.

This is, along with From Here to Eternity, Das Boot, The Bridge on the River Kwai, The Caine Mutiny, Stalag 17, and Twelve O'Clock High, among my favorite movies to come out of World War II.  What sets Mister Roberts apart is the humor born of the boredom, frustration, and tedium that most truly characterizes life in the service.  In this regard I recall a saying that goes something like this: ""War is filled with long stretches of boredom punctuated by moments of absolute terror.""  The crew of the Reluctant got only the boredom.

It's a tale that spins a number of universal stories, all at the same time. Primarily, it's the story of Mr. Roberts (Henry Fonda) stuck on a supply ship and bemoaning his missing the war. It's also the story of Cagney's character, an aging Captain, who's seen tons of ""college boys"" pass him over during his career. In Roberts, he sees the chance to even out the scales by keeping the college educated Roberts stuck on the USS Liberty. Moreover it's the story of Jack Lemmon's character, Ensign Pulver, who is forced to mature when he's thrust into the vacuum left after Mr. Roberts finally gets his transfer.
The backdrop for all this is the story of men under the stress of war...in the case of supply ships like the Liberty, that stress is set in the boredom, monotony and incessant hard labor with only rare and fleeting opportunities to blow off steam.

The end of the film, as Lemmon reads to the crew of Mr. Roberts' fate, never fails to raise a lump in the ol' throat.

I'd sit down and watch Henry Fonda battling wits with James Cagney, Jack Lemmon playing the young Ensign Pulver, and William Powell as the less-than-conservative Doctor. It is a NON-WAR, war movie, if you can believe that. I suppose that by the mid-Fifties, audiences wanted more comedies and less serious war dramas. As this was an adaptation of a stage play, it was perfect for the times. It has a wonderful mix of humor, antics, and drama, and it is a thrill to see these high-caliber actors in a quality film.

Far behind the front lines of the war, Reluctant was charged with delivering ""more toilet paper and toothpaste"" than any other ship in the Navy to island outposts in the Pacific.

The dim-witted, hateful captain was acted by James Cagney--a different type of role than he usually played.  He was superb!  Jack Lemmon was Ensign Pulver, a lazy youngster with a juvenile attitude who was afraid of the captain.  William Powell played the ship's doctor.

All of the parts were played magnificently, and the story was beautifully filmed.  Pure entertainment.

The only criticism I have of the film is the moral behind the story.  It makes Fonda a hero because he was a lousy officer who was chummy with the crew and hostile to his captain.  Granted, the captain was supposed to be a vicious, nasty, small-minded tyrant, like the captain in ""The Caine Mutiny,"" or Bligh in ""Mutiny on the Bounty.""  But whatever the captain's temperament, a good naval officer would have tried to support him, or at the very least kept silent.  To undercut his authority and incite disrespect for him is destructive to discipline, and on a naval vessel--in fact, throughout the navy--discipline is what makes the service an effective fighting force.  The story must have been written by a civilian.

But, it was good entertainment, nonetheless.

286354,4,6300267962,"Henry Fonda stars in one of his most famous roles as Mr. Roberts, an officer on board a cargo ship, a man who underestimates his importance and the respect he is shown by an appreciative crew.  The reason they admire him so much is because he stands up to their dictatorial captain, played ferociously by James Cagney.  Fonda brings a lot of dignity and quiet strength to his character.  The great William Powell is Fonda's confidant and ship's doctor, and Powell plays him with wisdom and class.  Jack Lemmon, as Ensign Pulver, gets many of the film's best laughs, as he broadly plays the officer who is a lot of talk, but not much action.  Mister Roberts combines humour, honesty, and drama very well, giving the viewer a real sense of the camaraderie onboard the ship.  We also see how the human spirit can triumph under difficult conditions.  And it's also a great chance to see four of Hollywood's greatest actors in one film, each one showing what they did so well.

286355,5,6300267962,"The U.S.S. Reluctant has set sail on her final voyage. The U.S.S. Hewell was the actual 250-ton cargo ship at the naval base at Midway, which doubled for the U.S.S. Reluctant used to film MISTER ROBERTS. Henry Fonda was Lieutenant (jg) Doug Roberts or just known as beloved Mister Roberts to his crew. Mister Roberts was a man of dignity and honor who just wanted to do his part in the war. Instead Mister Roberts is rendered impotent on the U.S.S. Reluctant commanded by a hot-tempered, eccentric basically uneducated Captain brilliantly played by James Cagney. The script under the tenure of director John Ford mixed his usual comic military camaraderie with the despair of the sailors stuck in remote out of action sea-lanes and ports during World War II in the South Pacific. In effect the Captain represents the enemy to the crew and the dregs of the naval officer corps to Mister Roberts.  The ever stoic Roberts finds solace in the crew (Ward Bond, Nick Adams, Harry Carey Jr., Ken Curtis, Perry Lopez, Tige Andrews and many others), a fatherly William Powell as Doc and Jack Lemmon as Ensign Pulver. Jack Lemmon won an Oscar for his role as the knee-jerk compulsive and glib wheeler-dealer Ensign Pulver. The Captain shows no compassion for the crew and it seems that his only real feelings are for a palm tree he keeps on deck. As events unfold and personalities clash into a final confrontation and the realities of war hit home it is the unlikely Ensign Pulver who does a 180-degree turn at the film's closing shot. Henry Fonda, William Powell, Ward Bond, Nick Adams, Ken Curtis and even the Captain James Cagney among many other members of the crew of the U.S.S. Reluctant have now left us. Today I read of Jack Lemmon. I suppose the `Order of the Palm Leaf' has now been passed from the hand of its final owner and now rests below the calm blue waters of the South Pacific. As the U.S.S. Reluctant turns its final bend into the sunset we say, ""Goodnight Mister Roberts, Goodnight Ensign Pulver. Godspeed.""",994204800,2,2018,4.700564971751413

286378,4,6300267962,"A previous reviewer who cited ""The Greatest Generation"" in his title line--but didn't really have too much else to say--received two ""not helpful"" votes and zero ""helpfuls"".  Too bad he didn't have a little more to add on the subject: his insight is actually a good one.  With the Brokaw book(s) and recent films like _Saving Private Ryan_ capturing huge reading and viewing audiences, the time seems ripe for renewed interest in WWII-themed films from the 40s and 50s.
Made in 1955--almost midway between the close of what Studs Terkel termed our ""Good War"" and the escalation of Viet Nam into a real war (for the U.S. anyway)-- _Mr. Roberts_ captures the spirit of the WWII era and its aftermath in a way few other films , especially those in the post-Viet Nam era, can.  The theme of the non-combatant soldier or sailor, yearning to see action, is one that has become a topus in literature and film.  Such a simple spirit of patriotism, however, would probably be viewed with suspicion in a more contemporary work.
Of course, even the fifties saw grimmer portraits of war (e.g._From Here to Eternity_).  _Mr. Roberts_ does not totally skirt the horrors of war, either, as the ending attests.  It is, in the main, however, still a comedy.  The heavier issues--the source of the Captain's spitefulness, for instance--are glossed over.  In fact, we really don't get to know much about any of the crew's previous lives--except that the captain was a resentful busboy once and that Mr. Roberts is from Nebraska.
That's quibbling, to be sure.  Certainly,  _Mr. Roberts_ deserves its classic status.  Despite having undergone a shift in directors midway through production, it retains a unity of vision that is remarkable. Unlike many films based on plays, this film doesn't need to be ""opened up"" extensively--it's primarily limited to the confines of the ship, but that is only appropriate.  And, of course, it's great to see veterans like Jimmy Cagney and William Powell get plum roles so late in their careers.  Henry Fonda is as steady as a rock.  Jack Lemmon is, well, Jack Lemmon, a little hammy, but exuberant.  He won the Academy Award, but all the cast turn in solid performances.",982454400,4,2186,4.870270270270271
286379,5,6300267962,"As a current active member of the US Navy, few Navy-related subjects appeal to us servicemembers.  Alot of them are poking fun of how wrong alot of the things we do in the movies.  For example, ""Crimson Tide"".  What submarine allows pets?  In fact, the interior is much too big for a compacted submarine that's already roomy enough for the missiles it carries but not for the crew.  Anyway, ""Mr. Roberts"" clearly displays an enjoyable and humorous outlook of Navy life.  Even if I've been in uniform for a little over five years, and this movie clearly took place in WWII, there are still Naval gestures and behaviors carried on today.  LT(jg) Roberts is a well-respected officer among his men.  We have those in real-life!  What appeals to me about this movie is the similar camaraderie the fictional crew has to us.  The best part of the movie is the lively liberty they had.  Of course, today it's not a welcomed sight, but it simply reminded me of the good times during port visits with friends.  The laughter, the jokes, the overall good fun and experience of a foreign port is all I saw with these guys.  When I watch this movie with Navy friends, we all have a good time watching.

His opposite number is played by James Cagney, the captain who is an ill  educated and ambitious former merchant marine who hates ""smart college  boys.""
All Fonda wants to do is to get a transfer to a combat  vessel before the war passes him by.  Cagney, on the other hand, is  committed to keeping Fonda on board, running the ship, so that the captain  can earn the rank of full commander.  Even so, Fonda is the only man on  board who is willing to stand up to him.
Push comes to shove in the movie  whenever Fonda submits his requests for transfer.
Sound serious and  dramatic?  Parts of it are, but there are also extremely humorous segments  -- e.g., when the crew discovers that there is a new hospital with nurses  within easy view of binoculars.  That's when Ensign Pulver (played to a tee  by a young Jack Lemmon) swings into womanizing action.  Powell also makes a  great contribution as the ship's doctor.
There is not a poor performance  by any member of the cast.  Wonderful stuff.  You'll love the antics that  take place when the crew actually gets a liberty -- thanks to Fonda!
5  stars all the way.  This film is in the same class as other period dramatic  comedies (is there such a genre?) such as ""Operation Petticoat,""  ""Stalag 17,"" and ""Kelly's Heroes.""

286384,5,6300267962,"When Henry Fonda received the Kennedy Center honors in the late 70's, as part of his tribute, the Naval Academy glee club sang.  Red River Valley saluted Grapes of Wrath, but the highlight was Anchors Away, when the  Midshipman director of the glee club turned about face, saluted and said  ""Thank you, Mr. Roberts.""  As each Middie left the stage, he  saluted and former Lt (jg) Fonda returned each one.  Mr. Fonda was reported  to have said that that was the greatest honor he received in a truly  distinguished career.
This movie has that impact--it is a salute to  ""all those brave men who sailed from Apathy to Tedium, with an  occasional side trip to Monotony"" (I hope I have this right).  When he  died, the network news tribute was a dark screen and the sound track as  Dolan and the others, having learned just what Mr. Roberts had done for  them, each repeated those magic words  ""Good night, Mr.  Roberts.""
