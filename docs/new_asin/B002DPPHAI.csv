8365704,4,B002DPPHAI,"This is an excellent pictorial account of the ""Book of Gates"", one of the ancient Egyptian books that offered a ""map"" into the afterlife. I cannot speak for the expert, but the DVD offers a clear understanding for the beginner. However,  forms such as the ""Pyramid Texts"" the ""Book of the Dead"", the ""Book of Breathings"", & the ""Coffin Texts"" are not dealt with in the movie. Perhaps The title of the DVD should have been restricted to something clearer, like ""Secrets of the Book of Gates"". I give it 4 stars because the title, and hence the presentation, is somewhat misleading. The ""Book of Gates"" fits within the evolution of resurrection texts, but does not, by any means, exhaust them.",1386633600,2,691,4.710743801652892
8365705,3,B002DPPHAI,"This hazwai whatever his face/name guy is annoying he is always hogging the camera in almost Every if not every Ancient Egypt Matter. Despite this setback of such an annoying person it is very informative although it looks like a cheesy Tv-Movie. It sheds light on some of the Wacky ideas these Once-Great Ancient people held but interesting nonetheless. A lot of their ideas in some ways besides the Pagan ideas are close to Christianity and almost every other Religion concerning The Underworld but the buck stops at where someone who can actually escape because he was a great King,Then again these were their beliefs.",1329004800,,621,4.923809523809524
8365706,2,B002DPPHAI,I thought because it was a National Geographic documentary it would be interesting but I was given a hypothesis narrated as a story with not a lot of supporting evidence and some really bad graphics. Very disappointing.,1325203200,4,219,4.945945945945946
8365707,4,B002DPPHAI,"You'll get a bit of what you're expecting out of this documentary, and a little of what you're not - but in mostly a good way. One pleasant surprise was the inclusion of a related active excavation by Dr. Zahi Hawass (Egypt's Minister of State for Antiquities Affairs - see Chasing Mummies on History), who I have always found to be a solid and interesting source on the subject matter of anything ancient Egyptian. Other archaeological work is also discussed, so to detail the evolution of Egypt's concept of the afterlife.
The biggest drawback of this documentary is that it's exceedingly short for the subject matter discussed within it, for much of what seemed to have been some of the more interesting aspects of the Pharaoh's journey through the underworld were mentioned only in passing, with, at best, a cute representative visual. Toward the end the sequences seemed particularly rushed.
Overall, the documentary is enjoyable and informative. Recommended.",1298678400,4,964,5.1075949367088604
8365708,5,B002DPPHAI,"The DVD is the best I have ever bought so far related to Egyptian History. The despiction of the book of gates/book of the dead is awesome, all related to Seti I enterrament.
Highly recommended.",1289088000,3,194,4.571428571428571
