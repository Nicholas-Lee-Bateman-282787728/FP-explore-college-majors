8264211,5,B0016WLI34,"This is a very well done hand drawn cartoon movie with the story line being composed of shorts revolving around a central theme.  A nice addition to any Retro Laserdisc collection.
For those of you who don't know this movie is rated R for a reason.",1366070400,,248,4.391304347826087
