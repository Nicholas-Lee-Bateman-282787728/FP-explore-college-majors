8373408,3,B002M15IR0,"Let me start with an anecdote.  When I was in grad school, I spoke to a Kenyan undergrad and asked about his major.  When he said computer science, I quickly responded, ""You go, Boy!""  He looked back and said, ""In Africa, students major in all kinds of subjects.  That idea that 'Blacks don't do science!' is an American thing.""  Even though most of my family majored in biology, I do shamefully carry that stereotype too that my African-American community doesn't like or get science.  However, I love when individuals prove that wrong and I hope that science-loving Blacks (the opposite of a severe science-hater like myself) will be inspired by Doctors Hale Williams and Drew.
This disc consists of two documentaries totally separate from each other.  In fact, I was having so much deja vu with the Hale Williams segment that I'm almost sure it was made years ago and just glued onto this disc.  Both programs are about 45 minutes so a teacher could show both in the course of one class period.
While the work said that Dr. Hale Williams could have passed for white but chose not to, the work says nothing about Dr. Drew's complexion which was also incredibly light.  Perhaps biracial African Americans will especially love seeing and learning about these men.
Since the age of six at least, I was told that Dr. Drew died when a hospital refused to let a Black man in, even though he invented the procedure that he required.  This documentary says nothing of that.
Since a certain election, talking heads have thrown around the stupid term ""post-racial.""  One may use that term to describe this century, but this documentary spells out how both of these Black pioneers faced racism again and again and again.  Poor Dr. Hale Williams was often backstabbed by those in his ethnic community as well.
You can tell that the documentary makers did not have large budgets here.  This disc may be dull to some viewers.  However, the acomplishments of both doctors were so impressive that I hope viewing the work will inspire the young and please all other viewers.",1252022400,,2059,4.747191011235955
