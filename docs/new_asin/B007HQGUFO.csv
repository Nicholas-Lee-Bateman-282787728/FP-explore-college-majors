5087191,5,B007HQGUFO,"""Awesome Science: Explore Yellowstone with Noah Justice""
DVD

I was recently given the awesome opportunity to review a very cool DVD with my son, ""Awesome Science: Explore Yellowstone with Noah Justice"", from New Leaf Publishers. This DVD is in a series with some others, that are just as educational and entertaining! My son is 14 and really enjoyed watching it. It was very refreshing to have a Biblical worldview perspective on how the creation of Yellowstone took place.

In this episode, you will learn some cool things such as how the ""Geologic Column"" is explained by the ""global Flood"", how ""super volcanoes"" were used to shape the Earth after the flood, and even the cool fact that ""Yellowstone"" was formed in a very short time span.

This DVD and the others in the series would be perfect for homeschoolers, or just plain entertaining to learn some things you may not of already knew!

5087192,4,B007HQGUFO,"I recently had the opportunity to review two of Master Books newest science DVDs - Awesome Science: Explore the Grand Canyon with Noah Justice and Explore Yellowstone with Noah Justice.

The star and commentator of each DVD is a boy named Noah Justice. The viewers travel to the various science wonders with Noah and listen as he commentates and explains why these areas are indeed wonders of science and provides scientific support for the Biblical viewpoint of each wonder.

In the Grand Canyon DVD, Noah discusses how the canyon was carved out in just days rather than millions of years as evolutionary scientists claim. He provides scientific evidence for how the layers upon layers of rock and sediment had been laid down in less than a year. All of the information provided supports the Bible's Genesis account as a literal seven-day creation process and also supports the Bible's account of a world-wide flood.

In the Yellowstone DVD, viewers travel with Noah to Wyoming to explore the national wonder of America's first national park. In this episode, Noah provides information that explains how the Geologic Column supports the world-wide flood. He talks about super-volcanoes and their part in shaping the world in post-flood days and also gives scientific support for how Yellowstone's petrified forests were formed in just a few years rather than millions of years.

I love that these videos are definitely a young-earth perspective and present a Biblical worldview. And the evidence that is presented actually makes sense and is impressive. I found the videos to be very interesting, very educational.

My six-year old did find the videos a little boring and it was a bit beyond her age, but my eight-year-old enjoyed them and learned from them.

Each video is 3o minutes long, and the videos come with a small study guide booklet. The study guide booklets contain fill-in-the-blank questions, discussion questions, and some ""digging deeper"" questions.

In addition to the two DVD titles I reviewed, there are currently four others in the series including: Explore Meteor Crater and Petrified Forest, Explore Yosemite and Zion National Parks, Explore Mt. St. Helens, and Explore John Day Fossil Beds.

This was a nice way to change up our science studies a bit. A nice change from our normal approach to our science studies.

5087193,4,B007HQGUFO,"Awesome Science: Explore Yellowstone with Noah Justice begins with an introduction to Yellowstone National Park and some of the features explained in the film.  Each attraction is looked at from the viewpoint of evolution and then refuted with the creationist point of view.  In your walk through Yellowstone you will learn about geysers, Yellow River, Hayden Valley, Yellowstone Falls, The Mud Volcano, Yellowstone Lake, Old Faithful, Mammoth Hot Springs, and the Petrified Forest.

My children and I found this DVD an interesting way to learn more about Yellowstone from a Biblical perspective.  I think it's important to give our children not only the Biblical viewpoint on creation and the world around us but to teach them about what the world believes so they can better defend their faith.  This DVD is a great way to do just that and is full of beautiful images which will make you want to visit the park yourself.

I learned something new in the section about petrification.  Did you know scientists have petrified wood in the lab and in a mineral-rich pool in Yellowstone?  Neither did I.  Fascinating!

5087194,4,B007HQGUFO,"This series features a fourteen-year-old boy narrating fascinating facts and explanations for the beautiful and varied features of Yellowstone National Park with the Biblical genealogical timeline as the basis for all that he presents. Noah is young and engaging; this definitely attracted my children to the video. The scenery captured on this video was like streaming a visual feast. I don't think I will ever get tired of exploring and observing God's creation. I could watch the video repeatedly to just to see those beautiful views again! My thirteen-year-old stated that the movie was interesting and cool. My six-year-old was having a bit of trouble understanding the information as it was presented but he loved looking at the hot mud pits and listening to Noah talk. A ton of factual information was presented in this material. I didn't even realize how many facts and definitions were presented until I read through the accompanying workbook that students can fill out during or after the video.  The workbook is a series of fill in the blanks that correspond with each section of the video.

We did have a few observations about the video series that were less positive. Sometimes the narration sounded sarcastic and defensive. This weakens the credibility of the creation view of Science. If you are correct, you do not need sarcasm to make your point. I realize this is probably attractive to our tweens and teens, but as parents we were a bit put off. All of us agreed that the video was a bit monotonous in its presentation. The video was a steady stream of narrated visual feasting - I mentioned that before. At some point this feast just became overwhelming. The Amazing Science logo would sweep onto the scene every few minutes to provide a transition between areas of the park and a new topic of discussion, but even this became monotonous and was especially frustrating to our eight-year-old daughter.

My Bottom Line: Overall, I am pleased to add this video to our collection of Science videos, and I am sure my children will enjoy watching Noah Justice again. I love the Christian worldview presented and the facts presented to back up a young earth perspective. Anything that will reinforce these views for my children is definitely worth owning. I present the negatives even though they are minor -- mostly in the hopes that these comments might have a positive effect on future productions by the Justice family. I want more videos in this series!  The 30 minute video costs $14.99 and the study guide/workbook is an additional $3.99.",1331856000,,2559,4.916666666666667
5087195,5,B007HQGUFO,"Take a trip through Yellowstone National Park, with Noah Justice!

Awesome Science is the new DVD Creation series from Master Books, that takes you on a tour through some of the most famous natural attractions in the United States.

This DVD was 30 minutes long and packed with fun facts about Yellowstone all without the theory of evolution! Filled with beautiful cinematography, and straightforward explanations  for the formation of some of God's most amazing natural wonders.

Awesome Science is a creation video targeted for a younger audience, but would make a great family time pastime. Everyone will learn something new along the way!

I enjoyed how well this video was put together, the graphics and effects were well executed. Every time I watch a Creation video or read a book, I can't help but be in awe of God's glorious creation! What I found most fascinating was learning about the formation of the petrified ridge in Yellowstone--I don't even remember seeing it when I was there! But it was so cool learning about how even things that you wouldn't even think about that much all point to a Biblical flood and Creation.

Overall, it was a fun video, a bit short for my taste, but I can see where lots of kids have short attention spans ;) This is a DVD series that you can feel great about letting your kids watch, because there are no millions of years! A well put together series, that I would recommend highly to families with children aged 6-13!

Final Rating: 5 out of 5

5087196,4,B007HQGUFO,"Second in the Noah Justice series of DVD's. . .this review may sound a lot like my previous review of Explore the Grand Canyon with Noah Justice.  They are very similar in format.  This Noah Justice episode finds him exploring and explaining geological features of Yellowstone.

My children enjoyed seeing the sights of Yellowstone, especially with a Young-earth Biblical Creation interpretation.  So many documentaries and books about wonderful geologic formations are told from a ""millions of years"" interpretation; it was nice to hear the young-earth explanation for these occurrances.  I also liked the Mt. St. Helens parallels--very interesting and helpful with some of Yellowstone's features.

As with the first Noah Justice DVD, I felt that the young man spoke too quickly and a little mumble-y, making it easy to miss details.  There is a study guide to go along with the DVD--with little quizzes/activity pages.  I wish there had been more printed information to accompany the DVD to highlight some of the main points which were a bit blurred in the fast-talking.

I would recommend this DVD to those who follow the young-earth interpretation of geologic events or those who are interested in learning about this viewpoint.  The child narrator is an enjoyable host--my children really enjoyed it, and want to watch it again to pick up some of what they may have missed in their first viewing.

I received a free copy of this DVD/study guide from New Leaf Publishing Group for the purpose of this review.  I was not required to write a positive review.",1331769600,,1560,5.027237354085603

8516823,5,B007HQGUFO,"My family recently watched Awesome Science DVD: Explore John Day Fossil Beds with Noah Justice. We were shocked when we realized the vast amount of information that is covered in the 30-minute program. I don't know why I was surprised. I should have realized how much was packed into that half-hour when I received the 30+ page study guide to go with the DVD!

It wasn't planned, but we watched the DVD the same night we read the account of the Flood in Genesis (as part of reading through the One Year Bible as a family this year). In John Day Fossil Beds, Noah Justice spends a lot of time explaining the science of this national monument, and that includes a lot of references to the Flood because the explanations that make the most sense involve the colossal Flood event described in Genesis and the resulting runoff and erosion as all that water moved back out to sea.

In this DVD, extraordinary teen Noah analyzes what secular scientists have to say about the amazing formations in eastern Oregon and going into great detail about why their theories don't hold water. (Pardon the pun. I couldn't resist!) We were able to easily follow the reasoning, and I appreciated the Scripture references that appeared periodically to help me follow Noah's train of thought.

It took us much longer than a half-hour to watch this Awesome Science DVD because we stopped it repeatedly to discuss and process what we were learning. We will have to watch it many more times to fully absorb all the information presented. My 9-year-old said, ""You can watch four or five minutes of this and have enough science to study for a week or more!"" She's right. We will be using this DVD in our science curriculum for a long time to come, and we can't wait to add more Awesome Science DVDs to our media library!

If you're looking for solid science with a biblical worldview, and you look forward to learning together with your children, Awesome Science is for you! This is definitely science for all ages.

Great video of Yellowstone!  Nice length, not too long for short attention spans, but still enough information.  We are going to have to watch it 2 or 3 times to fully absorb everything.  We also bought the study guide . . . I would say it's a very nice addition to the DVD, especially for homeschoolers, but isn't absolutely necessary, nice to have though.  Enjoy some truthful science for a change!  Can't wait to see more!",1357689600,,597,4.5754716981132075
8516825,5,B007HQGUFO,"Awesome Science Explore Yellowstone (episode 2) with Noah Justice. r  This was the 2nd video that we watched of this series (so far there are 6 all together), immediately after watching the 1st episode. The information given continued to hold my 9 yr old son's interest through out the whole video. The young man who hosts the DVD is very knowledgeable about Creation Science and the location that he is exploring. He gives information from a Creation point of view while helping children to understand the evolutionist point of view and then debunking it by Biblically backing up the Creation point of view. There are lots of wonderful scenic views of the area, maps, facts, and a combination of History and Science provided. I have noticed that not all sites provide the Study Guide we received with these DVDs and those that do require that you  order them separately for an additional cost. In my opinion this it's well worth it to by the Study Guide to accompany the DVD. The Study Guides are put out by Master Books. The Study Guide breaks down to the various points of interest of the location and scientific, including vocabulary, discussion questions and bonus activities to do. We will be purchasing the rest of the series and will be looking forward to more being added in the future. It'll well be worth the investment to add them to our home library. The DVD's are also put out by Master Books.

8516826,5,B007HQGUFO,"I had the pleasure of reviewing Volume I in this series about the Grand Canyon and I enjoyed that one and this one is no different.  Unlike the Grand Canyon I haven't visited Yellowstone yet, but I enjoy learning about it and this DVD is sort of like a field trip on DVD.  Using the Bible as the historical backdrop for understanding the age of the earth according to the genealogies as listed.

As in Volume I this is a great DVD if you are wanting to stay away from evolutionary view points and learn the whole truth regarding the breath taking views that our Creator gave to us through Yellowstone and it's geysers.  In this volume you and your child(ren) will learn about:

  The Geologic Column is best explained by the Global Flood
  Super volcanoes were used to shape the earth after the Flood
  The petrified forests in Yellowstone were formed in just a few years.

For $14.99 you can take yourself and your children on a field trip to Yellowstone.  I think one of the things that I enjoyed most were seeing the herds of bison feeding in an area that used to be lake during the Ice Age and the treeline was the lake edge.  It's awe inspiring and thought provoking - learning how the true science behind the formation of these wonders aligns with the Biblical accounts of how God created the world and the global flood.

The accompanying study guide will add to the study of Yellowstone and obtaining a copy for each child is easy since the study guide themselves are only $3.99.  The 34 page study guide has plenty of areas for the child to write in their answers either while they watch the corresponding chapter on the DVD or as review.  Discussion questions can be answered aloud or an older child could record their answers on a sheet of paper.  There are also bonus activities that will allow for deeper study.

The study guide/workbook will cover:

  About Yellowstone National Park
  The Geysers
  Mud Volcano
  Old Faithful
  Petrified Forest
  Awesome facts about the Petrified Forest
  and more

This is a wonderful resource that will help the family in becoming more knowledgeable in our young earth and the beautiful sites that we've been given through God's Creation.  For those who believe the Bible is an accurate historical text and also provides some science in regards to the origin of the earth then this will be a must have resource to add to your home's collection.

8516827,5,B007HQGUFO,"This is the second DVD in the ""Awesome Science"" series and it is just as wonderful as the first.  The Awesome Science DVDs are a family production beginning with Noah (your guide) and his father (whose video talents have been displayed on National Geographic, ESPN, and the Outdoor Channel).  This homeschooling family has brought a much-needed Creation-based science series into our living room.

Whether your children are in Christian school, homeschooled, or in a public school, this is one of those resources you don't want to pass by.  Give your children (yourself!) the knowledge you need to defend your faith and the Biblical account of Creation.  Learn how and why features in Yellowstone didn't take tens of thousands of years of erosion to be created.

It's important to understand the significance of why your faith cannot be based on millions of years.  Death couldn't have existed before sin, but that is what evolution teaches.  Immerse yourself and your family in the Bible and Creation-based science resources and you will treasure that what God says is the absolute truth.  This is a wonderfully put together family-friendly video that you will be watching again and again.

Secular and biblical geologists both agree on the evidence found in Yellowstone, but disagree on how to interpret that evidence.""

Explore Yellowstone with Noah Justice is the second DVD in the Awesome Science series that ties physical evidence with a global flood using Empirical science as recently seen during the Missoula flood in Eastern Washington state.

Join 14 year old, homeschooled, Noah Justice as he takes you through the evidence  supporting and defending a Biblical worldview of a worldwide, catastrophic flood.  Some of these evidences include:  the rate of growth of terraces in the Mammoth Hot Springs area, complex structured microbes in hot pool's, the absence of glaciation and much more!

Also a part of this DVD is a very well done section on the Petrified Forrest with 7 Awesome Facts that support a young Earth theory.

In addition to the video is a study guide to help tie information together.  (This can be purchased separately.)  Within these pages are:  General information about Yellowstone, the Geologic Column, Geysers, Yellow River and Hayden Valley, Yellowstone Falls and Lake, Hot Springs, Petrified Forrest and much, much more!  As with Explore the Grand Canyon, throughout this study guide are great discussion questions.  For example:  ""Why do secular scientists have to combine locations to get their full view of the geologic column?""

The Awesome Science Series is one that should be in every home library.  All age groups will benefit from the explanations, illustrations and spectacular scenery contained within this 30 minute DVD.

8516829,4,B007HQGUFO,"I was recently given the chance to watch and review Awesome Science: Explore Yellowstone and Awesome Science: Explore the Grand Canyon. These DVDs approach science from a Biblical worldview and share how these natural wonders align with an accurate reading of the Bible.

Modern science would have you to believe that natural wonders like the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone needed millions to form, but the Bible tells a different story.  Noah Justice, the narrator of these DVDs explains how an event like the great flood of Genesis 7 would be able to cause such disturbance as to form these amazing sights.

I love how the DVDs are completely set on the accuracy of Scripture.  They state that they use the Bible as their history guideline, which is rare to find and perfect for teaching your children science from a Creationist viewpoint.  I also appreciate the amount of information contained in these DVDs.  I can honestly (and somewhat shamefully) say that I knew very little about the Grand Canyon, and absolutely nothing about Yellowstone before watching these DVDs and now I know much more =)  There is so much information that I think anyone would have to watch them more than once to digest all of it.

The only thing I do not like about these DVDs is that they sound pretty much like a textbook (but with decent narration) put to pictures.  It is info and data galore, jam packed into 30 minutes.  I appreciate that it is short and to the point, but it would be nice to be able to sit an absorb the info before moving onto the next point.

I definitely would recommend these resources to any family wanting to learn more about the Grand Canyon or Yellowstone, I just probably would want to also use a medium other than DVD as well, so that your child would be able to slow down and absorb the great info that is presented here!  If you plan on studying these subjects with your children this coming year, definitely check the Awesome Science series out as an addition to your curriculum!",1338249600,,1997,4.642045454545454

One of the may reason we have chosen to homeschool our children is to provide them with an education that doesn't go against the biblical view.  I love it when I can enrich their learning with such a wonder resources like Awesome Science.
Noah Justice is your tour guide in the videos. He will talk about how the Grand Canyon was carved out in just days rather than millions of years as evolutionary scientists claim. In Exploring Yellowstone you will see how the scientific evidence points toward the Geologic Column being created by Global Flood of Noah's days and much more
You will see the scientific evidence for how the layers upon layers of rock and sediment had been laid down in less than a year. All of the information provided supports the Bible's Genesis account as a literal seven-day creation process and also supports the Bible's account of a world-wide flood.
Noah shows how the fossil layers were created rapidly during the global flood of Noah's time and not over millions and millions of years as evolutionists believe.

Noah will show you the super-volcanoes of Yellowstone and their part in shaping the world in post-flood days and also gives scientific support for how Yellowstone's petrified forests were formed in just a few years rather than millions of years.

Each video is 30 minutes long. Noah is fun,energetic and his enthusiastic is contagious. Noah makes the learning fun. The scenery makes you want to pack up your bags and head out to the parks. Your kids will absolutely love it.

Come and join Noah as he tours many of the world's most famous geological sites and shows how their origins line up perfectly with the biblical account of the flood and also with a young earth creationist worldview.

 I was given the study guide to look through and review. I would say this is more suited for older kids/teens. I also feel that you can adjust it easily enough for younger kids without to much hassle. The study guide that accompanies the DVD includes word lists, key concepts, Fill in the blank section, true and false section, and a Biblical study guide and much more. The questions are centered around the movie and the guide is well thought out and a good companion for the DVD series.

My only complaint is the size of the book. As a homeschooler with many books I would of loved to see a larger book so it doesn't get lost in my books. If not a full size then some way to fit inside the video DVD case. The DVD is $14.99 and the Study Guide $3.99.

In addition to the two DVD titles I reviewed, there are currently four others in the series including: Explore Meteor Crater and Petrified Forest, Explore Yosemite and Zion National Parks, Explore Mt. St. Helen's, and Explore John Day Fossil Beds.

Produced by Kyle Justice who has worked for the likes of National Geographic, ESPN, and The Outdoors Channel, this series, Noah tours many of the world's most famous geological sites and shows how their origins line up perfectly well with a young earth creationist worldview.

Each thirty minute video contains information weaving biblical account with scientific observations to show that so many of the things that secular scientists would have you believe couldn't possibly happen within a 6,000 year earth age time frame, actually fit in quite well with Scripture.

They are not at all dry and are packed with tons of educational information in a light and informative way!  Noah, the young host, is personable and articulate but has a personality that children will find easy to watch.  He lays out information comparing secular scientists views against biblical account and shows how even the fossil layers were created rapidly during the global flood of Noah's time rather than over millions and millions of years as evolutionists believe.

In the second episode, Explore Yellowstone you will learn how the park's natural attractions can all be explained by using your Bible!  Among other things Noah explains:

-how  the Yellowstone lake is a remnant from the glaciers melting during the Ice Age following the flood

-how the petrified forests  were not a product of many forests that were laid on top of the other over 30,000 years but how trees were buried in accumulating silt with the movement of all the water that covered the earth during the flood

-how the Yellowstone super volcano will most likely erupt again according to scriptures that speak about such things in 2 Peter.

-large deposits of lime mud were deposited during the flood and how that leads to the formation of the terraces in the park

The scenery in the video is breathtaking and there are scripture references posted across the screen when applicable so that you can take notes and go search your Bible after viewing. Study guides are available if you would like to expand the use of them from supplements to actual curriculum or to just further discussion with your family about how we can confirm the biblical historical record by closely examining the world around us.",1337817600,,2391,4.98992443324937
