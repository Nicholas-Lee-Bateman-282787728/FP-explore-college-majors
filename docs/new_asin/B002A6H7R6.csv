8359019,5,B002A6H7R6,"This is a very well done series on the English Civil War. It covers the major events of the Civil War through its effect on one extended family divided by the conflict. Its strength is in the story and the acting. There are no immense battle scenes and the actual fighting of the war takes a back seat to the personal dramas of the war. But it captures a sense of the war very well. It also captures historical detail well without dragging down the story with too much detail.

The story can generally be followed with a minimum knowledge of the war on the part of the viewer. The more the viewer knows, the more they will appreciate the details of the story. The story is also reasonably fair to both sides though it tilts toward supporting the King. It does a good job in showing the foolishness and unwillingness to compromise on both sides. It further shows the difficulties in establishing a pure republican form of government along with the dangers a large standing army and religious fanaticism can present. What makes it so good is that its a (rare) drama about big ideas presenting no easy answers.

While there are no big battles in the series, there is a siege on a small castle. The authors have invented a plausable battle at a scale that worked for their story and their budget. The weapons and the tactics show a good attention to historical detail.

Its a very well done historical series of the sort that nobody really does much of anymore (including the BBC).",1296950400,2,1477,4.52434456928839

As a kid I thought it was a little slow, without many battles scenes!  But as an adult I appreciate its historical detail, character development and overall plot.  I guess we do mature in our tastes even though the big Hollywood movies don't seem to give much credit toward that process today.

Many Americans might not be familier with the events of the English Civil War.  Once delving into it one quickly finds there is much comparison here between our War of Independence and Civil War.  Families were divided in this earlier period between King Charles I and Parliament.  Hard choices had to be made, and armies were created from bare scratch materials.  The end result was a bitter conflict which sought to address the issues of absolute rule versus Oligarchlic-Republic.  Monarchy could have ended in Britain during this period, and the fact that such a struggle was waged in the 17th Century at all was truly remarkable.  Americans should have no problem identifying with these familier issues in an earlier time and place.

While not a big budget production the series has accurate costumes and equipment.  Acting and speech patterns attempt to convery the times without being too excessive.  Major issues of the time are discussed via the characters so that the viewer will get an appreciation of the history without having extensive background.  Hopefully this will lead to a desire to learn more about a fascinating and compelling period in English history.  For those interested in the warfare of the period we do get a decent little seige portrayed when Parliamentry forces assault the Anscot Csatle.  Some nice scenes show how Pikemen and Musketeers fought in this period.  Details of early artillery and how an assault was conducted against a castle are fascinating, even if small scale in production.

It is worth pointing out that this series was supported by the late Brigadier Peter Young.  He was a Commando in WW2 and went on to publish many books as well as found the Sealed Knot English Civil War re-enactment Society.  His names is listed as a military adviser for the series in the credits.  This group is uesd for the battle scene in the series.  The Brigadier was very fond of the ECW period.

All in all an inspiring production on a lesser known period of English history.  This older BBC work proves once again that you don't need a big production to convery a great story and show how life was in another time.",1277251200,3,2598,4.771300448430493
