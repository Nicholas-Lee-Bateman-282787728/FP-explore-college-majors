4065485,5,B0033QVNCM,"It's been a while since I laughed this had but beware. These DVD's will not work in any blu-ray players.
They worked fine in my Apple computer or in a regular DVD player but if you only own a blu-ray, better forget it!",1267142400,15,218,4.093023255813954
4065486,4,B0033QVNCM,"Depending on your sence of humour you will love it or hate. I have grown up with a British Dry Wit, and also allowed in some of the straight German style of humour as well as a small amount of American.  Not the American copies of UK comedy, for me they do not work, but Rosanne and Two and a Half Men strike me as funny.
Well Mrs Brown has simularities but hard edged in British Dry Wit with adult overtones. If you can understand it and them, you will not be disapointed and if not, give them another viewing later and pick up on what you might have missed out on first time round.
Acting and production is a little amature like, but can be overlooked for a good laugh. Not as good as Father Ted, but a simular vain.",1311292800,,718,4.092198581560283
4065487,1,B0033QVNCM,I have not received my order yet.  While I ordered it on April 24th - I received a notice saying it would not be delivered until May 19-June 2nd.  I have not received any tracking information on the item - and hope that I will receive it soon.,1306454400,,243,4.041666666666667
4065488,1,B0033QVNCM,do not buy this if you are expecting the same shows that are on youtube...i bought this and tried a dvd put it in the case and asked to return item they do not take returns...,1306368000,,175,3.888888888888889
4065489,2,B0033QVNCM,"Be careful. It's a great boxed set and the shows are very funny, but if you live in North America it won't play on your DVD machine or TV unless you have a DVD player that handles both PAL (European) and NTSC (North America) formats. It does run on my Mac computer. Ripping it with iSkysoft and reburning it only reproduces the video and not the soundtrack. I emailed Bridge Stores in Ireland 3 days ago to see if there is an NTSC version but they have not replied. The only mention of format on the box or in the advertising I found was a small subtitle saying ""All regions"" but not that it was PAL format. My Blue Ray DVD player is quite new. I couldn't find any setting that would translate PAL into NTSC. Supposedly Phillips makes a DVD player that will play both formats. I haven't found one. Be warned before purchasing.",1306368000,,826,4.335483870967742
4065490,5,B0033QVNCM,Excellent comedy series offered by the BBC. Very funny with an interesting storyline. Agnes Brown and Co. will have you laughing at the edge of your seats.,1305763200,,155,4.777777777777778
4065491,5,B0033QVNCM,"Very funny and heartwarming sitcom. Unfortunately, if you do not have a regional DVD player you can't play these DVDs on your TV. At least I was able to watch them on my computer.",1304899200,3,179,4.294117647058823
4065492,5,B0033QVNCM,"Now I'd seen some of the clips on YouTube and they were hilarious. This set is so much more. There's serious moments that are just outstanding along with dry and outlandish humor that is just great. Mrs. Brown is a female version of Archie Bunker with improvements that bring it into this new century.

1st I'd recommend having a sense of humor that appreciates depth and poking fun at stereotypes in families. There are actually endearing moments in this show. You also need to appreciate coarse humor and some mild profanity. It's a nice mix of the serious, the sublime and stitch busting humor. It also is real enough at times to remind some of their own family members both those by blood and those by marriage. The larger the family you come from, the more enjoyable it is.

The writer and director of this show is a genius. The first one was a little slow, but then it gains momentum like a freight train. We're in our 50's and we absolutely love it. My wife said, worth every penny and glad we've got it. Truth is stranger than fiction and the incorporated familial reality is rich which gives moments of light drama to offset those hilarious scenes. Imo, it's rich like a fine wine and if you drink enough you're still going to get drunk and have a wild good time and be baudy.

The cast is made of very real looking people and it sucks you right in if you're looking to enjoy it. This series is so much more than some great comedy, it's a feast. We love it. For the price, this was absolutely worth the $50 or so bucks.
Enjoy!

p.s.
If American Idol and the banter there is your idea of a great time, this probably won't appeal to you. If you like good British comedy and drama and rousing good times of occasional baudy snarky humor, you're going to love this. This is the best one I've seen in a while.",1304726400,15,1813,4.355029585798817
4065493,2,B0033QVNCM,Bought this DVD Box Set under the impression that I would be receiving what I viewed on Youtube. When I received the DVDs it was a slow moving and somewhat boring TV show. Then to add insult to injury it doesn't play on my DVD player. Seems it's formatted for overseas  DVD players. I was able to view it on my MAC pc after playing around for a while. To potential buyers this is not what you see on YOUTUBE.It is funny at times but no where near funny as on the web,1304121600,9,466,4.010752688172043
4065494,1,B0033QVNCM,I would have been happy if DVD had ever arrived. They sent the wrong item and offered no recourse to remedy the problem.,1282694400,3,120,4.260869565217392
4065495,2,B0033QVNCM,"I'm only in the middle of the second disc, but I'm not sure if I'll even finish that one or not.  I thought from seeing the live show on the internet that this would be as funny as the show, but it's very slow moving and doesn't generate as many laughs.  Maybe my expectations were too high.  These are mildly entertaining, but don't really keep my attention.",1280620800,6,359,4.3283582089552235

8388041,5,B0033QVNCM,"If there's another season I will buy it too. It is ROFLMAO funny, but, if you get offended by 4-letter language, then this is not for you. I had to watch it a couple of times to understand the Irish slang (me, being german) , but I GET it now and I love it.",1367107200,,257,3.7777777777777777
8388042,5,B0033QVNCM,"This DVD package was not the one I thought I was getting, but I love it just as well. This package arrived way ahead of the schedule. I just love this show...I would buy from this seller anytime.",1364774400,,195,4.157894736842105
8388043,1,B0033QVNCM,"We were very disappointed with this product.  We were very anxious to receive it, but soon found it to be unusable.  The video is made for European TVs and does not work in our country.  There was no explanation of this when we ordered it.  WIsh we4 could do something to get the correct one.",1359676800,,292,4.254545454545455
8388044,2,B0033QVNCM,"The dvd was packaged okay. But I think I was expecting the later shows, that we are seeing in Australia now. So I didn't like it all that much.",1356220800,2,143,3.9655172413793105
8388045,3,B0033QVNCM,Disappointed that it won't work on any of our DVD players.  But we were to watch on our computer.  We knew this might happen before we ordered it.  The shows are very funny.,1353024000,,173,4.181818181818182

8388047,5,B0033QVNCM,"I bought this on the Mrs. Brown site. I am in the United States and wanted to make sure
it would play on my DVD player. I emailed the Mrs Brown site to make sure and the person emailed me the same day.
It took me about 4 days to receive it from Ireland. Total cost for the set was around $45.00 with free shipping.
  It did work on my dvd player. It also works on my computer.
This has to be
the funniest show I have ever seen.  I have watched it on both You tube and the set
that I have  and they are both hilarious.  I heard the are filming more episodes right now and
cannot wait for the new ones to come out. I love the whole cast.",1316822400,12,635,3.7803030303030303

8388049,1,B0033QVNCM,This will NOT work on blu ray.  It is NOT what was seen on utube.  Utube was much funnier,1313539200,,89,3.6315789473684212
