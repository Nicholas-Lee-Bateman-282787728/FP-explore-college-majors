219741,4,6300159159,"Chuck Connors gives an intense performance, in Bert I. Gordon's The Mad Bomber (1973), a film that features some edgy scenes of violence, and mild sleaze, as the Los Angeles police attempt to track down a serial bomber.

Smoldering with rage William Dorn (Connors) walks the streets of LA carrying a brown paper bag.  He enters a building at a school, and after quickly exiting minus the bag, a bomb explodes, leaving teenage survivors scattering in shock.  Driven by a personal tragedy, Dorn has a number of targets on his hit list, striking next at a mental hospital.

Discovering that a rape had taken place in the facility near the time of the bombing, police detective Geronimo Minelli (Vince Edwards) concludes that two criminals are involved.  Believing that the rapist has seen the bomber, Minelli organizes a series of undercover operations, leading to the arrest of a number of sex offenders.  George Fromley (Neville Brand), a serial rapist and killer, is eventually arrested, and forced to cooperate in the investigation.  Dorn continues on his mission of destruction, growing more angry and frustrated, as his attempts to ""communicate"" via the media, are not quite successful.  As the police close in, the pressure builds towards an explosive resolution.

Whenever the mentally unbalanced Dorn is on screen, it's hard to look away, as Chuck Connors excels at playing a man twisted by anger and guilt.  The performance is a little clichd, but it's still quite riveting.  Vince Edwards (Ben Casey) as Minelli, is a cop cut out of the Dirty Harry mold, angry, cynical, totally focused on the job, and willing to break the law, to solve the case.  Neville Brand gives an interesting performance, as the sex addicted Fromley.

Director and producer Bert I. Gordon (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Attack-of-the-Puppet-People/dp/B0000558NJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Attack of the Puppet People</a>) also incorporates a little sleaze, with Fromley's wife participating in homemade porn movies, and the police using young women as bait, in vice squad stings, to the tune of a funky soundtrack.  Flashbacks, intercut images, and music, are used to explain Dorn's motivations.  The overdriven Minelli, seems almost as angry as the bomber.  The film features a number of explosions, and most are executed fairly well, although the last, falls a little short of total destruction.

If you only know him for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rifleman/dp/B00005UM3X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rifleman</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Branded/dp/B002XY5EAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Branded</a>, you'll see a whole new side of Chuck Connors in this interesting piece of exploitation cinema, that is one of Bert I. Gordon's better efforts.  Unfortunately the DVD release by Geneon, appears to be an edited version.  Rating: 3.5 stars.",1365206400,,2975,5.876744186046512
219742,5,6300159159,This is 100% un-edited. The DVD Is Cut and the Cheap 1cent VHS is butchered to death as well.. The only legit release has the same cover as listed here (bomb w/alarm clock),1224460800,,172,4.242424242424242
219743,1,6300159159,"This is not the Un-Edited Version. Amazon's own Editorial Review states this is not the Un-Edited version, and Amazon's Editorial Review states  exactly what has been edited out.",1217116800,,178,5.357142857142857
219744,1,6300159159,"Are you one of the few who remember seeing this movie at a theater in '73 and have anxiously awaited its release on DVD? If you are, pick your three or four favorite scenes and then watch this Geneon (Pioneer) release. Guess what, they're not there. Where did they go, why they've been cut - cut - cut. So much for enjoying a rather obscure and perverse piece of cinematic history.

Positives: 'The Mad Bomber' boasts a suprisingly strong cast for a low budget exploitation film which includes; Chuck Connors, Vince Edwards and Neville Brand. More importantly, it only costs $5.99 so you haven't lost much.",1137024000,14,606,4.716981132075472
219745,2,6300159159,"To tell you the truth this DVD is a rip off this is the r-rated version not the uncut version.  The uncut version shows more gore and blood then this version and the seen where chuck connors gets blown up at the end is awful.  In the uncut version you actually see the body after it is blown up for a good 15 to 20 secounds not a quick flash like in this version.  Also the seen where Neville Brand is watching his wife on the wall with his projector showing images of here nude in diffrent attire is really hacked up.  It was cut and edited so fast you might as well have left it out of the DVD version all togather. even the rape scences have been edited.  I shoued know I have the uncut version on VHS tape and made a copy of it on DVD incase the tape becomes destroyed for my self.  lets find out when they are going to put out the uncut version instead.  I bought this version any way for picture quality, but if your not a big fan of this movie buyer beware.",1136073600,6,964,3.9895833333333335
219746,3,6300159159,"The Mad Bomber, which incidentally had a musical score which was noted, was a true work of art. I'm just not sure how to categorize it. I think, upon hearing the music in the movie, I could tell what kind of film this would turn out to be. Chuck Connors, with his long 70's sideburns and his granny glasses was by far the highlight. Although I must say, he has come a long way since he played Lucas McCain on ""The Rifleman"", he was very convincing. Neville Brand, who served in WWII and received numerous medals for his heroism during the war, did not receive any awards for this film.  He played the rapist and he did quite well at what he had to do. Vince Edwards, who played the psycho policema, was always mad and violent, even worse than the mad bomber or the rapist. He should have been locked up. I'm sorry but he did not add to this eloquent and poignant story of tragedy. The other assortment of actors were simply horrible. But what made this movie, if I may call it a movie, was the development of the two main characters. I was truly convinced that Connors was a psycho bomber and Brand was a sick, sadistic rapist, as repulsive as he was. In any event, I would reccommend this movie for people to have a good laugh but not to take it too seriously. By the way, Tina Louise, who played Ginger on Gilligan's Island, is in the movie, playing a woman activist who gets blown up by Connors. Just like her career went after Gilligan's Island.",1123459200,2,1449,4.327205882352941
219747,3,6300159159,"Indeed, this is not a great flick, but worth it for its sheer bizarre quality. Chuck Connors freaks out following his daughter's heroine overdose death. He demands complete attention from his aloof waitress and when he  doesn't get it, he really goes off.

7804378,2,6300159159,"The movie stinks. It is not the theatrical version I had hoped for. On the site it is labled as rated R. Bull. It should be rated PG for edited for tv. I feel I and others are being missled as to the version that is being advertised. It is not the uncut Rated ""R"" version that I thought I would be getting. Shame on Amazon and the people the are marketing this video as what is advertised. It is not. Don't buy it as it is not the original version that was shown in the theaters. If I thought Amazon would take action and send me the correct version I would reconsider. But I do not think that is going to happen. What a dud.",1426550400,3,625,3.9682539682539684

Though edited from its theatrical version, still  worth having and at a reasonable price!
Pick it up!!!!!!",1368576000,,384,4.787878787878788
