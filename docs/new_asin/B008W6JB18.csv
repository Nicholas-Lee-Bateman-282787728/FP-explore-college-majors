8531332,5,B008W6JB18,"I was a small kid when I had first seen this movie in the TV. It was very attention-sucking story. The idea of a group of special people being able to rule over time, is great! When you watch it, you will never guess of the outcome. I actually watched is over and over and had the booklet as well, made of screenshots of the film.
I recommend it for your ones and also adults who love great sience fiction. Very inspiring and a TV series could be easily made out of it.
Anyway, see it for yourself. I liked it, as I was a kid. But you know, after 32 years, I still talk about it to people. So... it is awesome.
Thanks to those who created it. Well done!
