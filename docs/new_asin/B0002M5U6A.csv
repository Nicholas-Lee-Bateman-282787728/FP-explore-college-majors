2103336,3,B0002M5U6A,"I am certain that someone thought this was a great idea. Let's take two classic holiday cartoons and make a long, tedious, poorly written musical cartoon out of them. There are more plot twists than a soap opera, and they are written about as convincingly. The only high point here is the appearance of Ethel Merman, doing a take-off of her famous Annie Oakley characterization. It is obvious that this project had been re-tooled over many years, as Merman's voice sounds younger, stronger and in complete control through most of the film. In the last part, you hear the age and wobble evidenced in Ethel's voice in her later years. Merman fans will love this; everyone else will snooze.",995932800,4,687,4.781512605042017
2103337,2,B0002M5U6A,"There must be some movie making law that sequels HAVE to murder their proceders. Maybe that's why I was afraid to watch ""Rudolph & Frosty's Christmas In July"", one of the most confusing and overly-written sequels on the planet. It's also too long, (almost two hours) meaning that the film makers have to find places to kill time. As a result, we have a countless number of  songs and an overblown vilian. Darn!
As sequels are one to do, ""Rudolph And Frosty's Christmas In July"" answers all the questions that have been keeping you awake at night. One of them of course being, ""How The Heck Did Rudolph Get That Nose?"" Turns out Rudolph's nose was actully given to him by a goddess. She gave it to him as a gift to Santa, the kindest guy in the world. Rudolph can use his nose whenever he wants, unless he uses it for an evil deed. If Rudolph shines it for a bad thing, his blinker goes out. Forever.
This thrils Winterbolt, a big, bad, scary vilian who's responible for that big snow storm that almost canceled Christmas. He figures that if he can get rid of the nose, then there will be nothing that can save Santa from his next snow storm, and then he can take over the world.
Well, as it turns out, Milton, a man who delivers ice cream to the North Pole, has fallen in love with a tightrope walker at a circus far away. But the circus is losing money, and if it doesn't show better profits soon, it will be taken over by a con man. Milton tells Rudolph that the only way to save the circus would be to send Rudolph and over seas to perform. People would pay anything to see a world famous reindeer like him.
Winterbolt takes advantage of all this, and gives Frosty and his Family special crystals, so that they can go too. These crystals will keep Frosty and his family safe from all melting harm. That is, until the last firework goes off at the Forth of July celebration. Once Rudolph and company are there, Winterbolt gets himslef a sneaky reindeer called Scratcher. Scratcher somehow tricks Rudolph into stealing money from the circus. That's evil. Oops.
If all this sounds confusing to you, it's even more confusing in the film. The film fails to capture the same charm that made the originals so appealing, although it does have some nice elements. It's nice to see Frosty in the married life, and the references to ""Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town"" are also nice. But there too many things happening to notice such things. It seems that the filmmakers were determend to make this their longest film yet, and they kill time whenever possible. Their are too many songs and Winterbolt keeps getting more & more ideas on all to kill Rudolph and his snowball freinds.
Speaking of Winterbolt, this film may not be good for little kids. Winterbolt lives in a mean looking ice cave, and his two ice dragons and evil genie may also make the young ones scream! And Winterbolt's mode of tranportation is riding on a sleigh pulled by flying snakes! And this comes from the people who gave us the perfectly safe & wonderful ""Rudolph"" and ""Frosty"" specials? And with all the time they have, you think they could find room to reuntite us with our some of our old freinds, like Yukon and Hermie. Even Sam The Snowman's missing.
With too many plot elements, ""Rudolph And Frosty's Christmas In July"" won't ruin it's preceedors for you, but it will answer all the questions you didn't need to know the answers too.",978220800,10,3403,4.497576736672052

2103686,1,B0002M5U6A,"Short review: 1) the tone of constant deception (especially deceiving Rudolph & Frosty each to do bad things to help save each other like some Stephen King sadistic villain), peril, victimization, and tragedy does not fit well with either a Christmas movie or a kids' movie, and 2) the villain & Ethel Merman are each on screen more than Rudolph and Frosty combined. The other Rankin & Bass productions are world class. This one's story is a huge blemish on their filmography.

Long review: Rudolph is in less than 25% of the movie and when he is, he is victimized by the villain's deceiving & coercing Rudolph into doing bad things in order to save his friends and causes Rudolph eventually to lose his red nose magic and be outcast. Frosty is in less than 25% of the movie and when he is, he and his wife & 2 kids are deceived by the villain and put in danger of melting by the villain for most of the movie (including actually melting--i.e. dying--at one point). Before the family-melting episode, the villain deceives Frosty into taking off his magic hat under the guise of helping his friends and removing his hat causes the magic/life to leave him and his wife & kids to grieve Frosty's death. Again, this is in addition to the later melting of the entire Frosty family and in addition to the movie-long villain deception & victimization of Rudolph. Bonus misery comes from a reindeer named Scratchy who is from a dungeon-like skid row, acts like an addict, and becomes an accomplice to the villain.",1480809600,,1505,4.6367041198501875

I first watched this on ABC Family with my mom one night while we were waiting up for my sister's train to get in. At first we weren't paying much attention, but as each bizarre situation was introduced into the plot line we just couldn't stop watching. It kept going and going and going. I honestly can't remember all the characters that were reused from other Rankin and Bass films but it had to cover at least 80-90% of the main characters and a good chunk of the sub characters. The little drummer boy didn't come around though, which is good. Have you ever seen that movie? It's terrifying!  Go watch about 8 minutes of it and you'll see what I mean.  Oh lord, nightmares... expect nightmares.

So yes, absolutely watch this. Don't expect to be entertained really but more be prepared to feel awkward and confused. Kind of like watching Punch Drunk Love. Great movie, but man, it hurts to see the characters going through such absolutely strange situations.",1450396800,,1281,4.8136363636363635

2103903,3,B0002M5U6A,"Id heard for years about the made for TV movie Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July, but Id never gone out of my way to watch it.  Since I do like the original specials with these two characters, I decided it was time to change that.  It wasn't bad, but I think once every forty years is quite adequate.

The story opens in June at the North Pole where Rudolph (voiced by Billie Mae Richards) and Frosty (Jackie Vernon) as well as Frostys family, wife Crystal (Shelley Winters) introduced in Frostys Winter Wonderland and their two kids, are enjoying a balmy summer day (10 below).  However, what they don't know is that the ancient master of the North Pole, Winterbolt (Paul Frees), has just awakened from a cursed sleep hes been in and is determined to retake the land.

He sees his chance when Rudolph and Frostys friend Milton the ice cream man (Red Buttons) stops by to pick up more of his merchandise.  He tells the tale of his friend who works for a circus that is about to go bankrupt.  Maybe Rudolph and Frosty appearing will draw in the crowds needed to save it.  Will the plan work?  And how does that fall into Winterboltss plans to take over the North Pole?

This movie is stop motion animation, and it is actually quite interesting seeing the hand drawn Frosty become stop motion.  Even a couple of the scenes from his specials are recreated briefly in this new media.  Im not the biggest stop motion animation fan, and this isn't going to change any minds.  Its okay, but nothing else.

The story starts pretty slowly, actually, giving us back story on characters we don't much care about yet.  We need the background, but surely it could have been worked in better later into the story.

Likewise, the songs slow things down.  Yes, we get the classic songs with these characters, which are fun.  However, the rest of the songs do nothing for the story.  Fortunately, there aren't too many of them.  Since this is a two hour (minus commercials) special, its something that could easily have been cut to lower the running time.

And yet, as the movie kept going, I found myself drawn into the story and wanting to know how exactly our heroes would prevail.  It helped that the pacing picked up as the store progressed even if the overall cheese remained.  It wasn't enough to make this into an annual tradition, but it was enough to make me glad I watched it once.

The voice cast is back to voice the parts theyd done in past specials.  Whether well-known or not, they all do a great job as do new comers who take on new characters here.

Maybe Id feel differently about this if Id watched it as a kid.  I know nostalgia helps with some of the other specials I love to watch each year at Christmas.  But since this special doesnt have that on its side, I won't go out of my way to watch Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July again.

So I went into this one with low expectations, and the highlight for me was to see Frosty done in animagic stop motion rather than as a cartoon.  I was totally unprepared for how dark this story was.  Yes, there were some scary moments in the original Rudolf, but there threats in other stories to the characters always seem to be no greater than Christmas being canceled.  This special features Santa and Mrs. Claus saying their final goodbyes to each other while trapped in the eye of a hurricane, Rudolf having to take blame for a theft he didn't commit to save Frosty and his family from being melted down, and later he is being booed out of the circus by children because his nose doesn't glow anymore, A chilling scene where Mrs/ Frosty tells her children to be brave as they face death by melting (and yes the worst does happen) Frosty committing what amounts to snowman suicide by surrendering his magic hat to the villain to save his friend Rudolf's nose-and his family crying over his lifeless body while their mother begs the kids to ""remember him as he was""....This just isn't fun.  It's bleak.  Yes everything comes out OK in the end, but that doesn't excuse our having to suffer through it.  Am I being too sensitive?  Perhaps, but I know the emotions of a child will feel all of this even more strongly.  I want to forget that this one was ever made.",1261699200,6,1720,4.594771241830065
2103983,4,B0002M5U6A,"There is only one reason to get this particular edition of Rudolph's adventure in winter wonderland, and that's Ethel Merman's cowgirl character of master of ceremonies for a way out circus featuring a special Christmas In July show. This production itself is watchable, although the ice villain can become irritating with his overlong conference of a magic mirror type inside a crystal cavern. The circus is fun with alot of characters, and I liked that outcast reindeer in cahoots with the ice villain to ensure Rudolph's nose does not glow for long.
I actually like the songs in this feature regarding the circus and parade, and I especially enjoy Ethel's take on her character, it so endearing and rather humorous. Ethel is actually the only credit for this animation fiasco, and I did like the ice villain's demise sequence, but I won't say how. Frosty and his family are a bit in the way here, because it is still Rudolph's calamity adventure and I sympathized with his goof in being tricked by the bad reindeer's set up to frame him. The ice villain's evil creatures are curious, and the cavern magic mirror gives the whole scenario the typical edge we'd might expect from this kind of production. Still, Ethel Merman steals the show with character and songs, and I love her everytime she's on the screen. It's Ethel and Rudolph all the way, in this version of a wintery wonderland saga.",1258761600,3,1394,4.788381742738589

I was and am still shocked at how the Rudolph and Frosty storylines were allowed to be butchered in such a way.  With Winterbolt, the origin of Rudolph's nose, and all the other sci-fi characters, you'd think the writers were on acid while putting this abominable script together.  There is zero holiday spirit here.  It's just terrible.  Unwatchable.  And once and for all, as with all of the Rudolph sequels...can we establish the fact that Rudolph was GROWN UP by the time he was pulling Santa's sleigh??  Yet all of the sequels star a BABY Rudolph.  I hate to get fired up about a kids special, but there is just so much wrong with this thing.  Thank God its not on network TV, or there'd be way more outrage than what I'm expressing.  I can't believe ABC Family even bothers themselves.  It is really that bad.  Trust me!",1230163200,4,914,4.5
2103986,4,B0002M5U6A,"Many used to recall ABC originally aired most of the Rankin/Bass Ani-Magic stop-motion specials while CBS aired Rudolph and the animated Frosty (of course, the Frosty spin-off, Frosty's Winter Wonderland was aired on ABC).

So witnessing the original special on ABC was definitely a treat and the fact both were actually put into Ani-Magic rather than just animation.  The clever thing I loved about Rankin/Bass was how they could take something and give it a unique spin.

'Christmas in July,' was originally a name of a film, and later used by retailers as sort of a connotation of Summer Sales.  But here, Rankin/Bass put a whole new unique origin behind Rudolph's red nose.  Apparently before St. Nick wound up at the North Pole (with great allusions to the other Rankin/Bass specials, by the way), there was a wicked wizard known as Winterbolt.

After centuries of observing his ruthless, and apathetic ways, the Lady Borealis decided on taking action and sealing the wizard into a deep sleep with her magic.  Regrettably, as Time marched on, Lady Borealis realized she could no longer contain the vile wizard.  So with the remaining bit of her magic, she placed a spell upon a young reindeer, and as a result, he inherited a glowing red nose.

Ironically, Winterbolt discovers things have changed at the North Pole, and decides to spoil Santa's reputation with the children of the world. Inspired by his infamous genie of the staff (which obviously the Genie was getting his schemes from the Brain), Winterbolt uses his Ice Dragons to whip up a horrible winter storm on Christmas Eve.  But as the story goes, Rudolph saved the day (note, no mention of Yukon, Hermie or the Snow Beast is mentioned here, which makes one wonder if the Snow Beast was once in the employ of Winterbolt, but let's not start analyzing here).

Naturally, Winterbolt isn't thrilled with this outcome, until he discovers if Rudolph dares use his nose for a selfish and wicked purpose, the reindeer's nose will be extinguished.  After a brief futile attempt in doing so with the direct approach, Winterbolt retreats to his castle and learns about Milton, the Ice Cream man.

Every July, Milton comes and picks up a batch of ice cream for the Sea Side Circus at the Beach from the storehouse Santa lets him use.  Except this time, Milton has his own problems.  Milton's in love with the circus' tightrope walker, and naturally proposed to her.  But on the day of their wedding, an evil carney has come to foreclose on the circus. (Here Ethyl Merman plays not only as the tightrope walker's mother, but owner and ringmaster of the circus.)  And unless the circus can raise the money in time, there will be no more circus.

Mind you, this show was done in the Eighties, so you have to suspend some disbelief, since Winterbolt jumps at the chance for a scheme.  Here, Milton suggests if Rudolph and Frosty come back with him, people from miles around would pay to see them.  Though Frosty's kids and Crystal would love to go to the circus, Frosty reminds them if they went to the beach in July, they'd instantly melt.

Enter Winterbolt, who kindly pretends to help the Snow Family with special amulets to protect them from the heat.  The catch, the amulets' powers cease when the final firework on the Fourth fades away.  Naturally, it doesn't take Columbo to see what ol' Winterbolt has in store.

Anyway, rather than spoil the rest of the plot for you.  This was one of Rankin/Bass' better holiday excursions because it was the first one to use several past Rudolph and Santa Claus specials to tie-in some of the backstories as well as provide a means for moving the plot along.

Now the interesting thing I note about 'Christmas In July,' was the writers currently were using specials which were aired more frequently on the networks.  Because you'll notice a lot of cameos from characters from the current past specials, but at the same time, you wonder what happened to certain characters from the original specials of both Rudolph and Frosty.  But the good thing here is, the story is rather well-conceived, you don't really care too much about continuity here.

And the real funny thing most people don't remember, before ABC Family started airing this special in July. I can recall when local cable channels started doing 'Christmas in July,' gimmicks for Summers sweeps, and the first thing they'd air was this special.  However unlike this DVD version, the syndicated version had been edited for time constraints, so sometimes the altered one made no sense in several spots.

Overall, 'Christmas in July,' was one of those great specials you'd see in a blue moon, and was one of the rare ones which wasn't marred by commericalism you now see in most Holiday specials, or contain preachy morals as well. It was just fun to watch.  Whether you're watching this during the Holidays, or on the Fourth, 'Christmas in July,' is definitely a purchase worth getting.",1183248000,2,4943,4.806146572104019

2103999,2,B0002M5U6A,"I guess the highlight of this feature film is that we finally get to see Frosty the Snowman in Rankin/Bass's trademark stop-motion puppet-animation process, Animagic! Now, don't get me wrong, the original TV specials ""Frosty the Snowman"" and the sequel ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"" were great but I think we all wish that they were done in puppet-animation like Rudolph, Jack Frost and Santa Claus. Unfortunately, that may be one of the only highlights of this film.

At a running time of over 95 minutes, there is very little to keep the story rolling. There is also an over abundance of non-sensical plot twists and flashbacks that even I found confusing, let alone the children this movie was targeted for. And unless your child is a fan of showtunes (and c'mon what child isn't?), then the songs which appear every few minutes will most likely bore them.

The plot concerns the evil King Winterbolt who was put into a long deep sleep by the magical Lady Boreal. Upon awakening, he finds there is a new king of the North Pole named Santa Claus, and decides to make him get lost in a blizzard courtesy of his snow-breathing dragons so that he may once again rule the North Pole with his evil ways. The only problem is Rudolph's nose, which he decides must be extinguished for his plans to be carried out. In one of the many flashback sequences we learn that Rudolph's shiny red nose which came from the magic of Lady Boreal, will go out if it is ever used for bad purposes, even once.

King Winterbolt decides to offer Frosty and his family magic emulets that will allow them to visit the great 4th of July Circus by the Sea without melting, but only until the ""Final Fireworks Fade on the Fourth"". Santa Claus agrees to pick them all up when the fireworks end and whisk them back to the North Pole before Frosty and his wife and two children are turned into puddles of water.

But, Winterbolt's snow breathing dragons whisk up a storm to keep Santa and Mrs. Claus from reaching the circus in time. Meanwhile, Winterbolt gets some help from a mean-spirited reindeer named Scratcher, and the two decide to use their sneaky ways to blackmail Rudolph into using his nose for bad.

If this seems confusing, imagine actually watching this film or better yet, imagine a child watching this film! Like many of R/B's later efforts, this one is rooted more in the magic and mystical style of ""Life and Adventures of Santa Claus"" than the fairytale-ish style of ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"".

There are some crazy songs which I found very amusing, like ""Don't Let The Parade Pass You By"" which is sung by Ethel Merman in her crazy style. There are also some special guest stars including Jack Frost from ""Jack Frost"" and Big Ben the whale from ""Rudolph's Shiny New Year"". In fact, there are a lot of nice touches and this film with the three biggest stars of Christmas could have been really good, if only the writing were better, some of the songs were scrapped and the running time was shortened.

If you are a fan of Rankin/Bass's work, you will not want to miss this one although you most likely will have trouble getting your kids to sit through the whole thing with you.

**Warning!!** The DVD release of this film has the sound very badly out-of-sync which annoys one throughout the movie! Because of this I lowered my rating for this film to 2 stars. I'm surprised that Warner Bros would allow a DVD to be released like this, and what's worse is that the former VHS release did not have this problem!!

In the spirit of Christmas, this film is well worth it.  In July? Absolutely, especially when the winter temperatures seem to be gone forever and you begin to reminisce about winter and such.

Anyone who thinks this movie is too confusing could not have been paying much attention, and I also would not say it's scary--- my 3-year old loved it (of course, it will depend on your own child's ""scare threshhold"").  Personally, I enjoyed the ""origin"" of Rudolph, found the new mythology of the characters charming, and thought Winterbolt to be a great villain.  The movie gets a 7/10 from me, although the video quality could have been a little better on the disc.  The lack of extras was disappointing too.",1103328000,14,722,4.530769230769231
2104003,2,B0002M5U6A,"Originally released to theaters in July 1979, this 97-minute children's film was trimmed to 75 minutes for broadcast on ABC around Thanksgiving 1979. The DVD uses the longer version, which may not be preferable. Rankin and Bass brought back the original voice talents from the previous fifteen years of holiday specials to reprise their roles, which may provide some interest for older viewers.

In this film, the evil wizard Winterbolt learns the secret of how Rudolph got his red nose, and devises a plan to dethrone Santa by setting off a complex chain of events (complex by Rankin-Bass standards, anyway). By the end of the film, children will have to endure the following disturbing images: Santa and his sleigh trapped in a black tornado; Rudolph being blackmailed into giving up his red nose forever; and Frosty being reduced to a puddle of melted snow.

Unlike previous Rankin-Bass villains, Winterbolt is a scheming loner with no human henchmen to interact with. He spends most of the film sitting patiently in his icy lair monitoring the characters and manipulating their thoughts like an evil puppetmaster. He obviously enjoys watching the events slowly unfold before him; most younger children will not be so patient.

The Animagic version of Frosty wears a constant smile on his face, making it easier for him to hold that corn-cob pipe in his mouth. Unfortunately, this leaves him unable to express any feelings of sadness or danger. All the members of his snow family suffer from the same disorder. Santa narrates the film, but only up to the point where he becomes part of the plot. It's a shame that the film didn't use a friendly, charismatic narrator like Sam the Snowman or S.D. the Mailman in the tradition of the original holiday specials.

Technical note: the budget-priced DVD is mastered from a theatrical print, and the sound is out of sync with the picture. For that reason, along with the reasons listed above, I can recommend this only to Rankin-Bass completists. In other words, not for kids.",1102204800,7,2022,4.938235294117647

Where the original is cute, friendly, kind-hearted and straightforward, this one is dark, mean-spirited, convoluted, confusing and pointless.  To make matters worse, there are continuity problems that will make children question all that they know about the story of Rudolph and Santa Claus.
