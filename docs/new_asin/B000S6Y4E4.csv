8204612,5,B000S6Y4E4,And when I feel a little frustrated I watch the video over and  find new ways to explore my older camera. When I get my next camera I will buy their companion DVD.,1357603200,,163,3.9393939393939394
8204613,4,B000S6Y4E4,"This is a good book to have, but the narrator talks so fast I  have a hard time keeping up.
Maybe it's  because I am 87 years old.  I will keep looking at this DVD until I do understand.
Thank you for the great service.  It arrived in good order.",1355788800,,246,3.86
8204614,5,B000S6Y4E4,"I got this particular DVD for my Mom as a gift and she loves it.

You can NEVER go wrong with a Blue Crane Digital DVD! You will take more away from this presentation the first time you watch it than if you read your manual cover-to-cover 10 times.",1215648000,,248,4.061224489795919
8204615,5,B000S6Y4E4,"This DVD was just what I needed to fully understand the capabilities of my digital camera. As they say right in the video, the user's guides that come with the camera are comparable to the owner's manual for your car; they give a lot of information about the car, but don't teach you how to drive. This video picks up where the user's guides leave off.
Not only do they explain all of the settings, how to adjust them & what they're used for, but they also give good general photography tips (i.e.; composition & the ""law of thirds."") They also get into photo & movie editing (I'd recently given up on the latter, but now I ""get it."") Although I had a vague notion that my camera was probably capable of a lot, now I fully understand those capabilities & have the knowledge required to use them to the fullest.
I highly recommend this video to anyone ""new"" to these types of Canon cameras.
Kudos & thanks to Blue Crane Digital for putting the power of my camera fully in my hands!",1206748800,,980,4.360655737704918
8204616,5,B000S6Y4E4,"If you have one of these Canon A series Power Shot cameras, you will definitely want to get this DVD. I can't say enough good things about this DVD. Buy it, you won't be dissapointed. It goes into very much detail about using these camera's.",1204070400,,241,4.377777777777778
8204617,4,B000S6Y4E4,"I bought this after buying a Canon a570is camera and I'm glad I did. Some cameras and owner's manuals are more intuitive than others.  This is a great tool to teach you ""how to use the camera"" as well as some pointers on how to take good pictures.  It goes step by step through each function and every button and combinations of buttons as well as creative alternatives. More importantly it tells how they work.  Taking pictures with the camera set on ""auto"" is fine, but this DVD also tells you how to use the manual controls to your best advantage.  I highly recommend this DVD to the casual user as well as those who want to expand there photographic horizons.",1197417600,4,663,4.454545454545454
8204618,5,B000S6Y4E4,Wouldn't it be nice if all products ordered came just as advertised?  This was one of those good experiences on all counts!!,1196726400,,124,4.636363636363637
8204619,4,B000S6Y4E4,"The DVD effectively explains how to use the camera. The narrator's analogy to the manual found in the glove compartment of a car is true. You can't learn how to drive from that car manual -- and you can't learn how to use the camera from the manual that comes with it. The DVD explains how, why, when, and where to use the difernet features of the camera.",1194480000,5,355,4.235294117647059
