7995480,5,B0000A1HT0,"I love finding indie films that are downright funny, with hilarious situational comedy, witty dialog, and engaging, charming acting. So many first-run films are just plain boring, and too many indie films are unapproachable and self-important (like an earlier post about this film: phew!). This film hit on all cylinders, from start to finish. I've recommended it to many others, and they've all agreed.

I see from other comments that this is Carl Kozak's first film. That explains why it relies on story, dialog, and acting, rather than eye candy and elaborate effects. It delivers the same feeling of satisfaction as watching a classic romantic comedy. I can't remember the last first-run movie that i liked as much.

And besides, you'll score points with your friends for finding such a obscure winner.

A great way to spend an evening. Best if viewed with people who like to laugh :-).",1111190400,4,890,4.959731543624161
