1254002,2,B00002JWZI,"Any comparison to ACO is a hollow one when it comes to this movie, which I'm giving a generous 2 stars to.  It has potential, but is hampered by a low budget and awkward dialogue.  Neil Patrick Harris and Matthew Lillard make good adversaries, but the script simply isn't up to snuff.  The events that conspire aren't very shocking or surprising; nor is the overly conventional ending.  Some of the psychology between characters is interesting, but other than that this is a lost cause.",971740800,,486,4.75
1254003,4,B00002JWZI,"Beside being a surprising disturbing movie with some really creepy shot of Asbury Park NJ, Animal Room contains a great scene by the legendary horror punk band the Misfits.  The song played is actually the Kryst the Conqueror recording of Dr. Phibes Rises Again (the vocals are lip synched by Michale Graves). The band is a wonderful addition to an already great movie that should be loved by anyone lucky enough to have come across it.",970790400,3,436,4.7368421052631575
1254004,4,B00002JWZI,"A very dark, sad story about a misunderstood genius becoming the victim of the anti-drug witch-hunt taking shape in America today. Spectacular job by  the writer(s) showing the absurdity of classifying ALL drug users into one  group. Enjoyable cameo by my favorite fiends. Will definitely be a purchase  once the price goes down or I switch to DVD. (side note)- If you're looking  for Malcolm McDowell in a jock-strap, you won't find it here.",967334400,2,442,4.9324324324324325
1254005,4,B00002JWZI,"I rented this video because I'm a big Matt Lillard fan. I thought he was great, as usual, but the real surprise was the supporting cast and the overall quality of the acting. The story line wasn't pretty and the  language was strong; but the whole thing came together in a good way...head  and shoulders above a lot of the mediocre films cranked out today. Also,  the photography was very good. I heard this was a real low budget movie,  but it certainly doesn't look like it. It has an offbeat ending that I  didn't expect. Definitely worth seeing.",955324800,,549,4.505050505050505
1254006,4,B00002JWZI,"Neil Patrick Harris, Matt Lillard have never been better. And check out Amanda Peet! Awesome! Dark, edgy, intense shades of Clockwork Orange. Not for the faint of heart, but well worth checking out.",955324800,,198,5.03030303030303
1254007,3,B00002JWZI,"Neil Patrick Harris? Matthew Lillard? How come I've never heard of this one? Hmmmm. Well, I don't think either of them will be putting this on their resumes, as if they really needed to fill them up anyway! But Gabriel  Olds wasn't too bad, reminds me of Jared Leto. The movie is crammed with  social commentary, something the director wants to expand upon, but can't  decide whether it be on the disfunctional school system, family and teen  angst, or satan. But he does give you a lot to think about. At least he  didn't sell out and wrap it all up with a happy face. Not bad, but a little  sloppy. Lillard need to quit playing the psycotic teenager, we've seen it  before, and better in SCREAM. But he's great at spitting while acting.  Harris, well, he's Harris, can't stretch it that much. I actually liked it,  even though most wont. Its a harsh movie, but bareable.",949881600,3,872,4.503184713375796

7915801,1,B00002JWZI,"Attempting to be one of those trendy coming of age movies, but alot of ridiculous scenarios and stupid subject matter that focuses more on how cool it is to do drugs and be violent without real consequences, then it didthe quality of the character..Embarrassed to say I sat through the whole tbing.  so stupid you have to watch",1419552000,,327,4.637931034482759
7915802,1,B00002JWZI,This was a crappy movie. The kind of movie you want to turn off to avoid the waste of an hour and a half.,1379116800,,105,3.4166666666666665
7915803,5,B00002JWZI,"I personally love this movie. From the bullying stand point, the friends drifting away etc. The only thing I wasn't fond of was the use of LSD, but that can be easily overlooked.",1350000000,,178,4.424242424242424
7915804,2,B00002JWZI,"This movies seems like it was meant to shock the audience and not much else,its attempt at the social commentary of our school sytems is quite laughable and mathew lillard is really easy to hate as the leader of the gang that torments neil patrick harris character. The films young cast are now big stars but when they starred in this cheap expolitation film they were all hungry young actors desperate for work. I was happy when the movie ended cuz near the end it got a bit overdramatic and needed to be shutdown. The director of this movie could have really made a great film if he would not focused so much on whats wrong with societies children. The director is to blame for the letdown of a movie this was. Im going to sell this dvd immediately cuz it doesnt deserve to be in my dvd collection.",1297382400,,800,4.375838926174497
7915805,3,B00002JWZI,"What an amazing piece of junk cinema this is.  This is a classic example of someone not knowing quite what to do with the material.  A judicious editor could have turned this into a classic harrowing story of teen angst and social responsibility.  Instead it's a schlockfest of horror and some of moments which, in better hands, may have provoked unease and shocked audiences into contemplation of the situations at hand, instead provoke hilarious laughter.  This, in and of itself, is not a bad thing, but I don't think it was an intentional choice.

Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Animal Room"" for all the wrong reasons.

Matthew Lillard gives what is quite probably his best performance, and it's wasted here.  But it's still worth watching. As another review stated, ""we all know young men like him"" but Lillard pulls it off with a sincere creepiness and unrelenting

Neil Patrick Harris' as Arnie breaks out of Dougie Houser mode, and although he professes resistance to being part of this group experiment of social misfits, he otherwise acquiesces to his plight and it's difficult to feel any empathy towards to a character who constantly reminds everyone who much more brilliant, witty and crafty he is than everyone around him.  Of course, were this to be remotely true, there wouldn't have been a movie.

As Arnie's old best friend, Gary, Gabriel Olds turns in a shiny, performance as the golden boy who wants to help Arnie get back on track.  His performance, even as good and genuine as it is, can't help but provoke more laughter so out of place is it here.

It's also fun to see Catherine Hicks relieved of ""7th Heaven"" goodness as a creepy, alcoholic Mom who can't seem to keep her hands off an uncomfortable young Gary.

Again, there was a good idea here, but it wasn't developed.  To start with the premise is completely unbelievable - not farfetched or impossible, which is acceptable in the right hands, but simply unbelievable.  It's difficult to move beyond that.  Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Animal Room"" - but then again, I'm a misfit!",1120694400,3,2069,4.851851851851852
7915806,1,B00002JWZI,"this movie stands out in my mind only because of how bad it was.  the front said ""alarming echoes of a clockwork orange"".  note that this did not come from a critic but the makers of the film themselves.  it was amusing to watch doogie howser roll a joint and drop out, but his performance as the painfully introverted nerd does not generate any sympathy.  neil patrick harris is not all that bad an actor, and his mediocre acting in this film proves just how little heart he had in it.  matthew lillard as the ultimate ""droog"" doug van housen was just corny.  he's like the terminal ""spookykid"" from high school who likes to dress strangely, beat people up, and compare himself to satan.  who hasn't met someone like this?  the violence and ""sexual content"" are nothing to worry about, since at no point are they realistic.  the futuristic element of the film is nothing but a dr. strangelove looking screen talking to the troubled youths as they sit in what seems permanent detention.  i'm guessing this one went straight to video.

7915808,2,B00002JWZI,"This movie could have been better, if they'd only have focused on every aspect of the Matthew Lillard's character. The audience is fed too many useless visuals. The dialogue is very weak and at times awkward. Through all of it, Matthew Lillard still manages to pull off a brilliant performance. The other actors outside of his clique seem confused, static and incomplete. They should have just shaved it down to one aspect, the one aspect people were interested in. Neil Patrick Harris' character was not one that most people are interested in. However it has beautiful cinematography, that just doesn't make up for the weak plot. It's less clockwork orange and more 90's wanna be pop culture cinema art.",972518400,2,704,4.92436974789916
