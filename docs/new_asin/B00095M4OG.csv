2266218,4,B00095M4OG,this dvd was very helpful in the skinning and fleshing of many different types of furbearers. The only thing that was missing was the finer point of really cleaning the fur up for marketing and the proper way of sewing up damaged fur. Other than these points the dvd was very good,1187913600,10,280,4.403846153846154

8057312,5,B00095M4OG,"i found this video very informative and extremely useful. it is totally hands on and detailed enough to get the job done.

i have watched this video numerous times in preparation for my first trapping season. my first catches were 4 raccoons and a red fox. i was able to skin them out in good time and the pelts came out better as i moved along.

i haven't got the chance to trap any coyotes yet but i have confidence in the skinning process due to this video.

the video segments are layed out very well and easy to navigate to each animal you are attempting to skin out. after skinning, stretcher sizes are suggested for each.

if you are a beginner, i feel this video is a must have. highly recommend",1290211200,5,703,4.303030303030303
