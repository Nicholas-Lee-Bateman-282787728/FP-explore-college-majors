2455549,5,B000CC2GVW,"**This Review Is For The Whole Series In General**
I was surprised to see this on amazon, it was previously available only at his website which is where I bought it. This is the TOUGHEST yoga I had ever done and I have a big collection of yoga videos from Bryan Kest to Shiva Rea to Baron Baptiste and more. Each one of the dvd's has more than 90 minutes yoga practice which is thorough and tough , it's starts with about 60 minute of intense standing poses with vinyasas in between and some arm balances thrown in and then a 30 minutes of seated potures and some ab work ,inversions, headstand and savasana. Each DVD is similar in structure but each one offers some different poses from the other to prevent boredom in the practice as they suggest in the advertisement , so this series does not offer different level practices that progresses gradually although you may find one easier than the other .They suggest it's for all people and all levels (probably to increase sales) but I think it will be too much for beginners and people who are not in good shape and even for intermediates because this is a real hardcore practice , the pace in most of the workouts is pretty moderate except some push ups & jump bursts that creates heat and strength in the upper body ,but some of the poses are held long, like the half moon series, which really makes your leg and rear muscles scream. Each dvd also has a 30 minute instructional segment in which he gives some pointers and modifications for some of the poses (this segment is identical in all of the dvds).The set is simple and even a little cheap looking (not very important) ,there's a few studetns of all genders and ages including Mark's mom and a kid and from time to time he'll be checking they're doing the poses correctly ,most of the time he'll be doing the practice with them, also ther'es no music in the background. So if you want a long and challenging yoga practices you'll probbably like this series.",1136678400,23,1967,4.481894150417827
8096871,2,B000CC2GVW,"I am totally looking for challenging yoga DVDs. While I must admit that I found some sections to be difficult (the mega push-ups), I didn't find it challenging in an overall way: no innovative poses or new territory chartered in the area of stretching, and of course, no spiritual or inner challenges.

There was no music, and Mark does more walking around and touching the women than doing the poses himself. His style seems to me that of a Football coach - he kind of stands there barking out the poses.

What can I say, I did this disc once, and haven't reached for it again. Too bad. I love a physical yoga challenge!",1329091200,,621,4.43859649122807
8096872,5,B000CC2GVW,"This Yoga DVD is HARD, but inspiring.  Shiva Rhea's DVD's are also good and HARD, but this DVD is different because it's a man teaching in a group class.  If you like fancy class settings with a man teaching or just need a cheap Yoga DVD to push you to the next level and want to miss cinematic ambiance then this DVD is for you!  This DVD seriously makes the P90X yoga dvd (Intermediate),  look like childs play.  Thank for reading!!",1318464000,,434,4.308641975308642
8096873,3,B000CC2GVW,"No music? Just the somewhat arrognt instructor talking.... While I do think these DVD's could be a great workout, it is hard to get through without any music. These DVDs are definitely challenging, I just wish they were more exciting.",1303689600,,234,4.875
8096874,5,B000CC2GVW,"I have worked out my whole life.  Pretty much 7 days a week, running, weights, cycling, boot camp, hiking, you name it.  I added yoga to the mix (once or twice a week) 15 years ago to get something different, but can't always find a challenging/convenient class in my area, so I have purchased many yoga dvds and this is one of my favorites.  If you want a challenging workout and lots of upper body strengthening, you will love this!  Yes, Mark can be annoying and braggy, but it doesn't bother me because his workouts are amazing and he can do every pose perfectly!  I also like that there isn't music playing in the background.  He'll have wind chimes or something here and there, but no outdated or new-agey music.  He likes to do more advanced poses which I love because it's challenging and works those muscles that don't always get attention.  The first disc in this series is probably my favorite.  Being a former gymnast, he likes to do handstands and many arm balancing moves, but don't let that scare you.  I bought his other series and that is good too (his wife teaches a hip opening class and she's great), but this remains my favorite.  If you want a great overall workout try Turbo Flow by Sonic yoga.  It was used in a university study and burns 5 to 9 cals a minute, but that doesn't count the post work out increase in metabolism.  I always feel really good after that one and it only takes an hour.",1302307200,,1418,4.407692307692308
8096875,5,B000CC2GVW,"I have LOVED and used Mark B's yoga videos for years and am extremely happy with the results! This set is probably my favorite, if not one of my top two picks of his. This recent purchase was a gift for my mother-I loved it so much and its great for all ages/skill levels so when she said she wanted to try yoga but didn't know where to start I was very excited to be able to buy this for her-and she loves it! What is awesome about Mark's videos is that they are a great 'kick you butt' workout IF you want them to be and a great laid-back, chill attitude for the times you don't want the drama. Mark has a great 'do what you can, and don't stress about what you can't do' disposition that makes yoga so much fun. Don't get me wrong-this workout is one that will be able to meet your needs and skill level for YEARS to come. I don't think anyone will ever get to the point where they say that this video has become too easy and that they need the 'next level'-it just doesn't happen, you will always be able to push harder, hold longer, stretch deeper for a more intense workout!",1276300800,,1080,4.099056603773585
8096876,5,B000CC2GVW,"Excellent workout. Had been using it through Netflix - am very happy to own it. New DVDs, received in a reasonable time.",1258070400,,120,4.5
8096877,3,B000CC2GVW,"These DVDs were recommended to me because they were challenging and since there are 3 of them the idea is that you rotate so that you won't get bored. Both of these are true but there are many more reasons not to recommend this series.
One, there is little to no instruction. You have to constantly look up at the TV to see what pose you're supposed to be in. This is annoying and disruptive to many of the postures that require balance and concentration.
Two, he doesn't tell you where you should feel the stretch or how to align your feet. He is constantly making adjustments in his students (I agree, rather inappropriately at times), but he doesn't tell the viewers what he is adjusting for so that we can self-adjust.
Third, he holds very challenging poses for a looong time it makes it difficult to feel successful in this practice and I have been practicing for 3 years.
Fourth, plain and simple the guy is annoying. He is condesending and contradicts himself. He criticizes helpful yoga techniques like using straps and blocks. He tells you not to worry about doing things perfectly and then says things to his wife like, ""not only did she give me a beautiful daughter but she can also do a perfect handstand"" Ugh!
I would not recommend this product.",1247184000,4,1258,4.570796460176991
8096878,2,B000CC2GVW,"I read the other review in Amazon about this being the best video.  The teacher is just annoying, and there is no music, so you hear everyone slobbering and breathing.  Not relaxing.  And, the workout seems a bit not centered ... I like the poses, but there doesn't seem to be a link between one pose and the next.  Bryan Kests power yoga is MUCH better at getting a full, invigorating yet calming workout in.  This guy was so annoying I couldn't even calm down and do the poses.  Good ideas and poses, hard stuff, but not handled well.",1226966400,4,536,4.363636363636363
8096879,3,B000CC2GVW,"Vol 1
Workout - 93 min
Set in an inside stage w/flowing white drapes & colored lights. Mark & 4 women & 2 men in a V behind him all dressed in white. He speaks while he does the poses & then also just assists the students. There is no music. It is an honest, intermediate/advanced class. There are towels for people to wipe the sweat off & some falter on harder poses & have to take rests in child's pose which is refreshing to see imperfection & true human struggle.
Many poses including the advanced ones are held for a long time such as 3 legged dowward dog with leg pulled to the side towards teh hand, there are many warrior 3 & half mood, several hand stands, shoulder stands, crow, etc. He says to them struggling, ""Don't be afraid to try, you'll land on your feet. Unless you land on your head, then you have something to fear. But you're safe here..."" That makes no sense. You must be VERY physically strong to do this & since there is a huge lack of teaching of foot placement, you should know many poses by heart & do them correctly w/o verbal help. He at times doesn't even say the name of the poses. Yes, I noticed him showing off doing the more advanced poses or a subliminal, ""Hey, I can do it easy, you should to, or you're a wimp. Oh wait, you can? Oh... well, I'm still better..."" Yeah, it's easier for him because 60% of the time he's walking around touching everyone.
As other reviewer's said about his inappropriateness, it's true. Many times I saw him touching the female students very close to between their thighs & I had to rewind when he was stroking one girls' chest & practically rubbing her breasts & even stroked between her breasts. Yes, he did get distracted by his wife's tattoo which isn't as bad, but since he does live w/her you'd think he wouldn't be distracted by it with 6 students & many camera crew all watching/listening to his every word as he teaches. And yes, in comparison, I watched closely, he wouldn't touch the men as long & also would touch them correctly at the shoulder nowhere near the chest, etc. During a standing split, he was right along two women at different times & had them bend their knee to grab their foot with their hand, but their leg would be WRAPPED around his body & he would pull their hand so it's wrapped around his waist. I agree, again, there is no flow, therefore, no body awareness in the way he constructed the series of asanas.
No, I could not finish this, but I watched most of it to see if I liked the style to bother to keep it for when I am stronger.

Extras:
All set on a stage with a mic directly over the person doing the poses.
Practice Vinyasa - 10 min - Mark instructing his wife doing part of a vinyasa with half moon, warrior 3, crescent, standing split, side bends & seated spinal twist & more & one side only. Great cuing & energy, she breathes well with good body awareness. Wish he would put out workouts like that with him & wife alone. Or maybe I'd would just love to see yoga videos of her alone.
Instructional Poses - 10 min - Mark guiding different women who are doing a couple of random asanas each & at first helping verbally & physically moving their body, then just silently adjusts which is of little help. Several times, especially when the always female students are doing pyramid pose, he's behind them, his chest along their entire back, if they were nude.. forget it... He does NOT need to get that close.
Pushing the Envelope - 20 min - Mark doing a series of different asanas that fade in/out from being filmed different days. In a voice over, he says the poses, some helpful hints on poses & mostly critiques himself on how he compressed different body parts incorrectly so you can learn how not to do it.

Pros: honest in filming of struggle/sweat, good production values, great energy by his Wife, Elizabeth, he does seem playful & cares for her which is palpable & good to see, great advanced poses that I'd never seen before & refreshing, the verbal clues he does give are spiritual
Cons: he's constantly distracted by thoughts of sex w/the students, he's verbal teaching could be much more detailed, he's idea of encouragement at times makes no sense or is subliminally discouraging, there is no rhyme or reason to course of poses, therefore I doubt his body awareness which is essential to any true yoga instructor who teaches mind/body connection

I love Elizabeth's energy in this, when is she making a dvd of her own?

8096880,4,B000CC2GVW,"This dvd is for you if...
*you are looking for a tough ""workout"" that you will never master
*you have practiced with an instructor
*you have the ability to tolerate an annoying and insincere mans voice for 90 minutes or longer
*you have strong shoulders & a strong core

This dvd is not for you if...
*you are looking for a peaceful practice
*you have less than 6 consistent months of practice under your belt

Why the 4 star rating?
This dvd is different from most others because it does offer you the chance to explore inversions such as headstand and handstand, along with some other balancing postures.  Again, please do not attempt these poses without having practiced in a class setting where an instructor can help correct your posture.",1196985600,13,743,4.7
