8566686,5,B00BDKXQ9S,Mr. Harris is an awesome instructor and his detailed deliver is top notch. Thanks again for sharing it with us. (If I had one minor critic it would be to ask where's volumes 100 - 102 and 104 on? I assume it was planned for the future and they just never came to fruition.),1399593600,,273,4.074074074074074
8566687,5,B00BDKXQ9S,"I have purchased other DVD's for training in jiu jitsu and this one is a great addition. The video and instruction is top quality, easy to understand and follow.",1389744000,,161,4.586206896551724
8566688,5,B00BDKXQ9S,"Professor Harris always has a clear and concise presentation. They rich with detail and have a great amount of material. The DVD gives you types of grips, location to grip and which grip to use in the different locations. 5 star all the way.",1380758400,,241,4.5
8566689,5,B00BDKXQ9S,"Roy Harris, a man I am proud to call Sifu and friend produces the highest quality instructional materials... this grip fighting DVD is no different. This DVD is full of gems. If you watch the material and practice the material, it will improve your game.

How you gonna tap 'em out if you can't control 'em?

How you gonna control 'em if you can't even hang on?

Now what you need to do is get a frigging grip on your own self, pull your head out of the sand (or wherever else you may have it buried), and buy this DVD. The answers are there if you want them.

Good training to you
