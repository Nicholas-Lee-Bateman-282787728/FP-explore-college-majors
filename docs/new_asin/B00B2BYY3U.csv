5552960,3,B00B2BYY3U,"This review does contain spoilers.  I was fortunate enough to receive a copy of ""The Wicked"" to review.

Legend has it, The Wicked, eats children to stay young.  Is there truth to this story or is it just a myth to frighten little children?

""The Wicked"" starts out with a child named, Amanda, being abducted from her room by the witch.  Her mother didn't believe in the story of The Wicked, but she found out the hard way.  As the opening credits roll, we see newspaper clippings with stories of people missing in the past, which possibly leads to some truth to the urban legend of The Wicked.  We find out that the story goes that the witch and her coven were burned about 100 years ago, but there was one survivor.  The witch eats young kids to stay young, older kids to stay strong, and beautiful kids to get beautiful.

Some teens decide to camp in the woods near a place called, Open Harth, which is supposedly the house where the witch resides.  There is a Senior dare where they go into the woods and get close enough to the house to throw rocks at it.  If a window breaks, the witch will go after the person who broke the window.  The teens walk up to the house, which is buried in the woods with an ominous feel to it, and they all simultaneously throw rocks at it.  One of the rocks breaks a window, but they don't know whose rock it was.

Later that night, where they are camping, the teens hear some strange noises, but don't see anything.  After looking around a bit, one of them finds Amanda's teddy bear on the ground.  They decide to investigate further and find other clues that Amanda is close, so they decide to look for her in the house, or at Open Harth.  Once inside the house, they hear sounds of a little child and eventually find her in a hidden, what looks like a ritual room, in the basement.  The teens grab Amanda and make their way out; however, on their way out, The Wicked notices Amanda is gone and starts to go after the teens.  They make it outside with Amanda and start to run away.  The witch eventually catches up with some of them and manages to get all the teens except for one, which is the one who is keeping Amanda safe.

It turns out that the legend of The Wicked is real.  The witch has the teens she's captured in a room where she prepares them to eat.  They all have an apple in their mouth and she also puts salt on their bodies as well.  There is one teen on the table and she starts to run them through a grinder that is run by a hand crank.  This is by far the best and bloodiest part of the movie as we see blood splattering everywhere while the teen is being ground up and we see on the other end of the grinder what the end result is, which is what the witch eats.  The more she eats, we can see the witch changing in looks a bit.  It appears that she is getting younger and more beautiful the more she eats.

Toward the end, the surviving teens realize that witches burn, so they ""defeat"" her by using a lighter and a flammable canister of some sort of chemical to make a makeshift flame-thrower.  The witch catches on fire and disappears and the surviving teens get away safely.  At the end of the movie, we see some kids playing at a playground and the witch, who is young and beautiful now, starting at one of the kids.  It appears that the witch has not been killed after all and the legend continues.

Overall, I was a bit disappointed with ""The Wicked"".  I think it could have been so much better in the long run, but it was lacking some elements and really wasn't scary at all.  Yes, it did have its moments, but I was craving a bit more with a story like this.  The story line was okay, the acting wasn't too bad, but, at times, the actors didn't seem believable and it was comedic at times.  As I am a horror film fanatic, I can still respect the artistic value of ""The Wicked"" and give this an overall rating of 3/5 stars.  Other true horror fans will be able to appreciate this film as well.

The special features on this DVD include:  No Soul is Safe:  The Making of ""The Wicked""

Overall Rating:  3/5 Stars",1367884800,,4075,4.21862871927555
5552961,2,B00B2BYY3U,"Obviously, I've missed something here.  I watched this little independent film the other evening and all I can say is ""what a mess.""  Seems a town's urban legend is more truth than fiction when all sorts of people start disappearing once they visit--ne'er to be seen or heard from again.  The town of Summerset is cursed by a witch (who lives in some sort of run-down house on the outskirts of town).  Now, why the townspeople simply couldn't tear this house down and be done with it escapes me, but I digress.  The legend continues that if you throw a stone at the house and not break a window, you are safe; break a window, that's your tough luck.  If the witch catches you, you become her dinner; this is how she survives.

So....off to the old house goes some teenagers (how refreshing)to cast their stones.  This is when the film completely fell apart.  You have a witch that picks and chooses who she'll go after, a house that ""heals"" itself, and one little girl everybody is trying to rescue.  Everything becomes such a hodgepodge of stupid choices, bad special effects, and just about every other cliched scene you'd want to stick in this genre, I completely lost interest.  The acting really is not that bad; it's just the script (as usual) that does this film in.

""The Wicked"" is unrated for some language and some violence.  Again, I think these films are going more for an unrated version because horror buffs will think if it's unrated, it has to be full of something.  Well, this film is ""full of something,"" but I won't say what.",1367884800,,1545,4.550724637681159
5552962,4,B00B2BYY3U,"This is another Hansel and Gretel type of film with a legendary wicked witch who lives in the forest and devours children. In the opening scene young Amanda (Caitlin Carmichael) is in tears, afraid that ""The Wicked"" is going to get her. It was a very convincing scene, A+ for Miss Carmichael. Once she goes missing, our 4 teenage heroes plus 2 go in the woods and camp out near the witches house who they arouse during the very deadly spring equinox.

The film did an effective job of building character of our main players with some brief moments and conversations. I thought the witch scenes could have been done better as they were an inconsistent hit and miss going from the overly supernatural to just a plain gore slasher. It really doesn't effectively work both ways. A decent Redbox rental, might make it to my collection when the price drops. Takes place in Orono, Michigan.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, brief sex and skinny dipping scene and brief nudity.",1367625600,3,961,4.714285714285714
5552963,4,B00B2BYY3U,"The Wicked, is a great little indie horror film. I have watched a lot of these low budget horror films, usually to my disappointment. The Wicked however, surprised me; with a really great story executed properly. Where's I admit some of the dialog was not great. The visual effects and acting were above par for this kind of film. It also has some great gory moments and fun kills. Over all a very solid indie film.",1367452800,2,415,4.473684210526316

The witch is not a spell casting hag---this babe eats children for eternal youth; she devours teenagers for their strength; and feasts on nubile beauties for eternal beauty.  A Walt Disney rejecy for sure!
THE WICKED has some effectively spooky moments and the usual teen stereotypes.  It would be a great popcorn rental as you and your significant other nestle on the couch until the first scream propels one of you into the other's arms.
So if you're sick of zombie dreck, THE WICKED may be a change of pace.",1367452800,2,639,4.628318584070796
5552965,5,B00B2BYY3U,"The Wicked was a pretty fun horror flick. It was scary but not overly so, which was good for me.  Definitely will keep my eye out for the sequel.",1367193600,2,145,4.0
5552966,3,B00B2BYY3U,"Every town in America has their version of ""The Wicked."" They're the weird person, house, or other location kids whisper about amongst themselves in fear and parents use to threaten their children with. It's the old house on the hill everyone walks faster by on the way home from school or the old man or woman we're told not to talk to.

Director Peter Winther and writer Michael Vickerman put together a fun little indie film that is only hindered by shoddy CGI and a wavering sense of who it was made for. ""The Wicked"" is an extended episode of R.L. Stine's ""The Haunting Hour"" until we get one or two sequences of sexuality and dialogue littered with bad language. Movies like this always leave me shaking my head in wonder. If they tone down those elements or omit them, they would have a PG-13 film that more people could enjoy.

The title character (Cassie Keller) would make any person feel anxious or frightened. She's a witch who maintains her beauty through devouring children. The legend goes that if you visit her house in the woods and break one of its windows, she will come for you.

""The Wicked"" is both a coming-of-age tale like ""The Goonies"" or ""The Monster Squad"" and a slasher flick like ""Urban Legend"" or ""I Know What You Did Last Summer."" There are two sets of main characters. First, we have two life-long teenage friends, Devon Werkheiser (""Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide"") and Diana Hopper, in that awkward state where they start to have feelings for each other. Secondly, we have the hip sex-crazed high schoolers who are always looking for a new thrill.

The CGI is at best on the same level as any number of fantasy shows from the late 1990s and early 2000s. They definitely don't blend seamlessly with their surroundings. I do want to give props to the practical effects supervisors. The Wicked's makeup and the gore effects look great and made me cringe a few times.

The packaging for the DVD promises a featurette entitled ""No Soul is Safe: The Making of 'The Wicked."" I've searched the main menu and looked for it under the scene selections tab. It's nowhere to be found. A little background on how the movie came about would be interesting.

Although it has its flaws, ""The Wicked"" is still an entertaining horror tale that many viewers will nostalgically identify with. If you can just get past the weak CGI and delve into the story, you'll enjoy yourself. They should do a PG-13 and an R-rated version of the movie to reach both age ranges. I could see this playing on Teen Nick and the Chiller Channel simultaneously.",1367193600,16,2565,4.663716814159292
5552967,4,B00B2BYY3U,"* I was sent an advance screener of this film per my request; I am in no way being compensated for my review.

Last year (prior to the Great Blog Crash of 2012), I reviewed an excellent fantasy movie directed by Peter Winther titled DRAGON AGE:  REDEMPTION.  This year, Winther shifted gears and decided to take us on a trip into horror territory with THE WICKED.  Yes, this is a story about a witch, but there are no green-faced Wizard of Oz tropes here; this witch eats children LITERALLY to stay alive.  The result is an effective and chilling jaunt into terror.

This film is not perfect, but it will scare the hell out of you.  From the opening scene to the rolling of the credits, I squirmed in my seat as the events unfolded onscreen.  The premise of an entity needing children to survive strikes me at the core because I'm a dad, but I think it touches everyone on a primal level.  This is part of the reason the movie is so effective as a horror film.

THE WICKED is shot well and the premise is well executed.  I would have loved to have seen this on Blu-ray, as some of the shots were grainy but they get the job done well enough.  The acting is very good, with the main cast doing a great job, however nine-year old Caitlin Carmichael steals the show with a bone-chilling performance as kidnapped youngster Amanda.  I have to tell you:  the opening scenes with her abduction by the witch gave me chills.  She is a beautiful young actress with a lot of talent, and I expect she will have an amazing career in Hollywood.

The film is not perfect, though, with a couple of major sticking points for me.  First off, there is potential for an amazing amount of gore, although we only get to see a little bit.  The witch likes to grind her victims up in a human-sized meat grinder but all we get to see is some computer-animated blood (which doesn't look very good) and a few handfuls of the resulting carnage coming out of the other end.  Not much to clap about.

Also, I don't like how the witch is shown on the DVD cover of THE WICKED.  For me, that dampens the suspense.  The creature/witch/entity/bad guy should never be revealed until a key time in the film itself.  This doesn't ruin the movie by any means, but it would have been much more effective to wait.

Still, THE WICKED is a heck of a horror film and it's one to definitely check out.  The film hits store shelves next week, so make a note to give it a look.",1366848000,4,2430,4.311258278145695

5552986,4,B00B2BYY3U,"The Wicked keeps with a very clean and tight story that is brought to life by believable actors who, at times, make you want to see them die on film-well a few of them anyway. I also found the evil supernatural entity of the witch very dark, and horrible, so I didn't really want her to prevail in the end. She was pretty vicious. The directing for the film manages to keep your attention with some pretty creepy concepts, and point of view moments, that allows the movie  to be dark without being too dark. There are some clich moments within the movie that takes away from the suspenseful action scenes, the snag that befalls a lot of movies like this. However The Wicked did make me jump quite a few times, and even though the CGI was a bit distracting when used, the kill sequences where still very well done and entertaining. Overall I really enjoyed this film and found the witch to be a true classical interpretation of an evil supernatural witch. If you enjoyed movies like Darkness Falls (as I did) then this film is perfect. I do have to say that the film is not some modern expressionists attempt to get real, and gritty with a raw horror story, that feels more like grindhouse experimental filming. It is a traditional horror film that keeps with a true, classic concept of ghost story/urban legend. I liked this film more than I liked Darkness Falls.",1432598400,,1363,4.518218623481781

It is an old story with a typical set of characters in a typical situation, but there are little tweaks of originality all along the way.

I bought this movie because it featured a witch, and she delivers the goods. Her last scene is great fun.

5553019,4,B00B2BYY3U,"While not the scariest horror movie, it wasn't the worst. So, let's take a page from Goldilocks - it was right in the middle with a nod towards good. What was surprising about the film was the sibling back story between big brother Justin Deeley (DROP DEAD DIVA; 90210) and kid brother Devon Werkheiser. The special effects were about par for a movie of this type which certainly tried to go the extra mile when it came to dealing with ""throat slitting"", ""grinding machine gore"" and a ""dematerializing witch"".

An old legend about a witch and an abandoned house becomes the focal point of this film when a young child is spirited away (literally) from her bedroom and drawn into the void. While looking for the missing child, a foursome of 20 somethings go to a supposed witch's house and cast stones at it. But, you DON'T WANT TO BREAK ANY WINDOWS! They are unknowingly followed by the younger teen brother of one and his ""girl friend"". A very courageous young lady who was a recent newcomer to the group insists upon entering the house to find the child even though there is no evidence that she is actually there. Her ""date"" gallantly accompanies her and, before long, they encounter...

From then on, it becomes a question of who survives - if anybody does (though one could probably guess a good part of the outcome). Running through the house and its basement is like going through a ""Fun House"". The witch proves to be a formidable opponent and her carnivorous ways to which we become privy are fully explained earlier in the movie. This is the most squeamish part of the film which makes it worthy to be called ""horror"".

How our intrepid rescuers manage to contend with the witch and how they interact with each other certainly gives this film a bit of three dimensionality.  The actors are not just cardboard cyphers. And the crying of the little girl who was abducted at the beginning of the film appears to be quite real and genuine (perhaps she was really frightened).

Unfortunately, the ""Epilogue"" (there's always one in a horror movie) which is meant to unnerve us comes off as being trite and somewhat inexplicable given some prior recent events. But you're not supposed to give a horror movie too much scrutiny.",1372982400,,2229,4.676020408163265

Always like the old horror films where there are cute ""damsels in distress"" in very scary circumstances while staying in old abandoned haunted houses. add in a touch of fooling around with horny couples making out while barely dressed and you have the perfect horror film. the scene of the couple getting ready to go skinny dipping was very entertaining, just wish there would have been a tad bit more skin. the couples running around in the haunted house basement was a little monotonous, and the special effects of the with appearing and disappearing were well made. Am thinking of waited awhile to see if this film is released later as a un-cut or uncensored version with all the the provocative scenes remaining intact.

It combines many elements of horror movies that we have already seen: young white kids in the woods, stupid decisions, scary killer, dumb cops, obnoxious friend waiting to get killed, etc. The acting was adequate, but the script was pretty weak. They especially went overboard with the dumb cop routine. The worst part about the film, however, is the length. It is way too long for what it accomplishes. Having said that, it is still moderately entertaining. The young blonde actress is fun and makes the best of a bad script. The special effects in the haunted house are absolutely hilarious (i.e., cheap and tacky). PS: There's a completely unnecessary and borderline offensive theme used early in the film.

5553031,3,B00B2BYY3U,"THE WICKED

I love movies about witches but for some reason there are very few of them that actually are out there compared to the other creatures and monsters of legend. From the movies that have been made some are good, most are ok, few are classics. This movie falls short of that classic status but it is a good flick. Sure it kinda falls into that teen scream kinda thing but it really is creepy at times. Kids in particular would be truly scared of this.

""The Wicked"" is a local legend that kids pass amongst each other and parents tell to make them go to bed. Well in this town it may be a little more than legend.  Young girl goes missing apparently taken straight out of her bedroom in the middle of the night. The town officials are on the hunt for a kidnapper but there are some who believe that something more sinister is at work here. Enter your typical teenagers who are planning a nice ""wholesome"" night out in the woods. Once there they may stumble upon something dark out in a house. A house that if you throw a rock and break a window something ""Wicked"" this way comes.

This is one of those movies that would have been really great with a bigger budget. I say that because this movie actually is not that bad, in fact I liked it. I have always been about the legend movies plus like I mentioned witch films. Speaking of the witch I really liked what they did with her. He looked very creepy and may be the absolute best part of the film. Also for a low budget flick this movie looked good and had some decent acting in it as well.

Of course this is not a perfect flick as some of the characters can be annoying at times. I guess that makes sense since it is a bunch of teens. I have to say that I did like the two younger teens who were childhood friends becoming something more than that. I felt they both did a good job here, the girl in particular. As far as the older teens they were good as well but the characters were like I said kind of annoying. Also the little girl who was taken was very very good in this; I really believed that she was terrified.

This film was directed by Peter Winther who you may know as a producer on films like ""Stargate"", ""Independence Day"", ""Godzilla"", ""The Patriot"", and ""Eight Legged Freaks"". I can tell that this guy has some true potential as a director. The opening scene in particular was excellent. I also liked the writer here as he wrote the film ""Warriors of Virtue"" and directed the second one. Of course both guys could have done a better job here but overall it was an enjoyable movie. Actually a group of us went over to my grandmother's house a few weeks ago and watched this; she is very much into horror films.
pretty good horror",1369267200,,2704,4.261208576998051
5553032,4,B00B2BYY3U,"Technically, Wicked is not a good movie. The acting is weak, the plot predictable and the story is derivative. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it. There are a few enjoyable twists with how a couple of the characters play out - still predictable but cathartic.

I watched this movie alone due to my wife not being a fan of horror, but I expect this would be more fun to watch with friends with copious amounts of popcorn. It's creepy but most probably won't lose sleep over it.

One review mentioned that the movie took awhile to really get started. I have to agree. If the writer had done a better job of tying some of the back story elements with the main thread it would have been a better movie. In this case, most of what occurs in the first half could have been compressed into dialogue between the characters.

We have to be a bit forgiving when it comes to horror movies because there is not much to choose from unless you are a fan of torture movies like Saw or Hostel. Until movie studios start taking horror seriously again, true horror fans have to accept movies like The Wicked.",1369180800,4,1082,4.42713567839196

It is slow in the beginning, and drug out quite a bit, there were some things that had really nothing to do with the movie I feel, but if there's nothing else to watch, it does pick up a little bit more after the middle of it. Some of the decisions they made were made only to try to make other parts of the movie work, since some of those would not really work. After halfway through, I started to wake up a little more.
