841683,5,630432894X,"Ok, it's a little silly and outdated, but you can't see comedy this good anymore. Jack Lemon has a field day! He is that good!! I was just wondering how it is possible for him to lay in the bushes all night before exiting. But then we wouldn't have gotten the laughs when the gardener discovers him in the morning. Boy did Hogan hate that cat! The little fury devil kept getting in the way of his peeping tom activities, like walking across his back, and attacking that mirror he was using to see inside the window. The mechanical violins are one of the many nice touches. And I like the clever way his hand and leg reaches out of the doorway to get the newspaper and milk bottle, and remove the booze: all you see are his hand and leg. They were very clever in those days! Too bad there is so little Lemon material on DVD, like this one.",1181347200,3,838,4.211180124223603

841685,5,630432894X,"This movie takes me back to the college days of the 1960s in Southern California area...although I believe it was set a bit north of Los Angeles in the San Luis Obispo vicinity.  The architecture, surrounding trees, and clothing are very authentic of that time period.  It was very typical to see younger women working through their relationships just as the main heroine Robin did with her boyfriend David.  The landlord Hogan, played by the talented Jack Lemmon, could be plausible for that period also.  It is a relaxing, charming, movie that gives me back a bit of my youth in small town college life.  Paul Lynde and Imogene Coca are the icing on the cake of this funny romance comedy.  Ah, the innocence of that time....pure and simple delight and fun!!!  AND it was very true of that innocence.",1116720000,18,801,4.678571428571429
841686,5,630432894X,"I have watched this movie many times through the years and it is still just as funny as the first time.  Jack Lemmon plays the part of a irritating, yet hilarious, landlord of an apartment complex, who is constantly getting into other people's business and usually getting himself into some pretty unusual predicaments.  I would highly recommend watching this movie, if you have never seen it before.",1115510400,9,400,4.955223880597015
841687,4,630432894X,"Perfectly capturing the fact that the more times change, the more they stay the same, this successful sex farce hasn't enjoyed the same staying power as the Doris Day/Rock Hudson flicks.  Yet, all the same elements are there: brightly colored cinematography, swinging sixties music, gorgeous cast (Dean Jones & Carol Lynley look exquisite), hilarious character players (Imogene Coca & Paul Lynde), big names (Jack Lemmon & Edie Adams) and slapstick sexual situations.  It's also an interesting time capsule of early 60's sexual hypocrisy.",1058572800,14,538,5.469879518072289
841688,2,630432894X,"Continuing along the path of weird early '60s films that skirt the collision between the pre- and post-sexual revolution cultures, comes this truly nauseating sex comedy.  Jack Lemmon plays Hogan, a nightmarish, leering peeping tom of a landlord who stalks and sexually harasses a young couple that have moved into his apartment complex.  His ""comedic"" personification of Hefneresque wolf-whistle culture is grotesque in the extreme.  It's hard to imagine that people really found this funny as opposed to offensive.  Leonard Maltin describes Lemmon's character as ""love-hungry,"" I'd call him in need of a permanent restraining order.  A weird social time capsule, yes, but also a deeply disturbing, yucky film.",1039478400,5,711,5.486238532110092
841689,3,630432894X,"Jack Lemmon is Mr. Hogan, a swinging bachelor who has got the perfect set up. He is landlord to an apartment complex that occupies women and only women. It seems Mr. Hogan has had a lot of luck dating his tenants; after all, it's hard to resist his charm and womanizing ways. That is, until the faithful Robin moves in. Robin, played by Carol Linley, is engaged to be married. Now this doesn't appear to be a problem until she tells Mr. Hogan that her boyfriend, David, will be moving in with her(Did they do this sort of thing in 1963?). Now this poses a problem! How is Mr. Hogan going to romance Robin when her boyfriend is constantly getting in the way? And so the love triangle begins... Mr. Hogan, trying to get in good with Robin, while trying to keep fianc David out. Sounds predictable, right? Well it may be but there are a few surprises that will make you laugh so hard you might even shed a few tears. Anyone who has ever seen a Jack Lemmon movie knows that he can be a riot on the screen. I've seen this one a couple of times and laughed out loud each time. As a matter of fact, last time I watched it with Quon I had to convince him that the all-woman apartment complex wouldn't fly these days. Poor guy. . . almost spent a large sum of his inheritance on an old run-down apartment building.",969926400,20,1305,4.244979919678715
841690,5,630432894X,"Carol Linley and Dean Jones are what young lovers in love and want to live together before they get married to see if they are going to be compatible.  The best part of the show is when Paul Lynde(plays the gardener at the  apartment complex that Jack Lemmon owns and runs with tenants that are ONLY  unmarried women!!)  Anyways, Paul Lynde is a scream when he discovers while  he is watering the flowers, he is really watering Jack Lemmon that got so  drunk the night before, he fell off a ladder while trying to get a peek at  Carol Linley while she was showering!  Imogene Cocoa plays Paul's wife and  Jack's cleaning lady!  You can watch this movie again and again and laugh  as hard as you did the first time you saw it!",912729600,15,725,4.335820895522388

842168,4,630432894X,"So much of the time The Yum Yum Tree was corny, censored to death, irritating to Right-Wingers and unreal. But Lemmon as a nefarious seducer in humor and silly scenes made made people think while being royally entertained. See what the thoughts behind this funny film have morphed into our here and now.

Whew, I really got going there. See the movie and see what I mean by comparing Lemmon's work to all the others of then. in the proprieties of his time. It'll be a smartening yet funny time for you.",1371168000,,1547,6.83756345177665

842262,5,630432894X,"This movie takes the viewer back in time to the free and easy lifestyle of the 60's. Characters like Jack Lemon's definately existed back then and still do today, though in hiding. It was an age of free and harmless flirtations between the sexes. We all did the flirting at work, school, and at public gatherings. No one was ever harmed by it that I know of; and no lawsuits ever prevailed against it. I am positive that women enjoyed the attention as much as men did; and what better way to open up a conversation with a woman than to kid her a little and pay her the respectful attention she might just enjoy without any harm being done. Of course, Lemon's character was not respectful of the woman because he had only one intention on his mind. In a sense, he used entrapment in that he tricked unsuspecting young women into renting one of his apartments just so he could have a chance at seducing them. But I think he got his due from more than one of the girls, so the moral of the story is fixed in place rather well. Good and innocence prevail; evil and coniving people do not. Doesn't always work that way in real life of course. For light entertainment and ageless humor, this movie is a good bet. If nothing else, it projects a nice example of life in the 60's and reminds those, like me, of what it was like back then. Lighten up, buy the movie, and just enjoy the tour of far more simple times when political correctness was just a bad dream.",1313193600,4,1454,4.310218978102189
842263,2,630432894X,"Jack Lemmon, appearing on ""Inside the Actor's Studio"" said that this was one of his least favorite of his own films, and I would have to agree with him.  I have watched it 3 times now, each viewing separated by a number of years, thinking maybe my opinion of it would change.  I like 60's bedroom farces,  and I like the actors in this film,  so why it didn't work for me wasn't clear until this most recent viewing.  I think the reasons are 3:  1, Lemmon's character really is a sleazeball, and doesn't change; he starts out as one and finishes the same way.  2, Dean Jones a pleasant actor, but his personality isn't strong enough to allow me to feel any sense of victory for him over Lemmon's lecherous landlord character. I feel Jones won because the script said so, not because he earned it or deserved it in any way.  3, Carol Lynley is beautiful but too worldly; I certainly don't believe her character would not be willing to indulge in pre-marital sex for one thing,  and that she wouldn't be sophisticated enough to see through Lemmon's character in the second. Therefore her ""will she or won't she give in to Lemmon's character"" conflict becomes  unbelievable on both counts; her character would be sleeping with Jones' character and would see through Lemmon's almost from the get-go. It leaves me with way too much I have to just accept because the script says so.  Too bad because this film certainly has good players trying hard.",1302825600,3,1443,4.575875486381323
842264,5,630432894X,"The time is the early 60's. Robin Austin (Carol Lynley) and her fianc&eacute; Dave Manning (Dean Jones) plan to setup house together in a local apartment to see if they can be compatible with out any yum yum. Little did they know that the apartment they chose was part of a planned community. The landlord of this particular apartment, Hogan (Jack Lemmon) only rents to young ladies preferably willing young ladies. Hogan thinks that he leased his apartment to two women. After realizing his mistake, will he be able to overcome the obstacles and achieve his objective? If so how?

Toss in the 60's attitudes a protective aunt a nosy cleaning lady a curious gardener and various a sundry women and you have the makings of a very good comedy.

Many of the jokes in this film are slapstick others have double entendre.
