3722754,3,B001NQG9FK,"Well, this is a nice idea for collectors who haven't bought these specials yet, and want them all together, but at the same time, it's a lot of money for 6 discs of half-hour specials. Here's the special listings:

BE MY VALENTINE, CHARLIE BROWN;
IT'S THE EASTER BEAGLE, CHARLIE BROWN;
IT'S THE GREAT PUMPKIN, CHARLIE BROWN;
YOU'RE NOT ELECTED, CHARLIE BROWN;
A CHARLIE BROWN THANKSGIVING;
and A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS.

Any one of these you can easily find separately online for a more reasonable price than buying them in this set. So, overall, you could probably save money doing it that way. This is quite a bit of money to ask for this set. I feel that, with there being so many different compilations of the same titles out there, it seems to me that Warner should release a compilation of specials that haven't been out yet. And, $30 should be the maximum charged for these, not $80. Not for 30-minute or less specials. I mean, they're already charging $15 or more for each special. Give the consumer a break, Warner! Times are hard right now. People are trying to save money, not dish out more. I myself am a huge Peanuts fan. Have been for over 30 years. But I wouldn't even pay that much. I'll find them separately, thank you. Even remastered, it's still not worth the price.",1243987200,119,1286,4.586956521739131

This set is so great to have, as you don't have to wait one time per calendar year for the networks to televise them with commercials:(  All children love Charlie Brown, and they bring back fond memories to adults from childhood.  The sarcasm in these sets is something that only adults can really understand, making them just as entertaining.  We throw parties and have them right on hand during any holiday, and everyone loves them.  It's really a great investment.",1258502400,3,564,4.833333333333333
8327792,2,B001NQG9FK,"I have been a Peanuts fan for as long as I can remember. While watching these special during their respective season every year is something I enjoy even as an adult, I have to grouse about the price for this set. You can buy individual copies of these same exact discs for between $9.99 and $13.99, and Warner has done a fantastic job of re mastering them. So for this set, you are basically paying $16 to $30 for a pretty box to slide them into. Really???
