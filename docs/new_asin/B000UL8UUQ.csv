8213602,4,B000UL8UUQ,This film has some great moments and nearly as good as the book.,1474934400,,64,4.0
8213603,5,B000UL8UUQ,"I just watched it, an excellent movie about how Murphy's Law played out in this ill fated mission.  I recommend reading the book by the same title, as well as the following books about this same Mission:  'Soldier Five', 'The Real Bravo Two Zero'.  I highly recommend all of these.",1421798400,,281,4.58
8213604,1,B000UL8UUQ,"The subject of this movie certainly promised to make for an exciting experience.  However the promise of the title did not come out in the movie.
The movie purports to chronicle the experience of SAS soldier Chris Ryan who wa the only member of the ill-fated SAS Bravo 2-0 patrol into Iraq during Desert Storm that was not killed or captured.
The movie first is suspect in that it portrays the soldiers as scared, reluctant warriors which seems to conflict with most accounts of the attitudes and motivation of those who attempt SAS selection and pass.  While some individuals may slip into the Regiment even though they are unsuited, it strains the credulity to imply that a whole 8 memeber patrol consists of those who are scared to the point of being unable to function or completely incompent to carry out their missions.  Since this movie strongly suggests that incompetence and fear were the primary traits of the patrol members, excepting Ryan himself, the movie lacks credibility in my eyes.
The movie's other weakness is the director's attempts to be ""arty"".  The movie has odd camera work and choppy erratic editing that seem to be done for effect, but the effect is merely annoying.
I cannot recommend the movie.  For those who are interested in Ryan's story, the book of the same name that the movie is loosely based on is far better.  It has a straight-forward narrative style that tells the story without a need to be affected in style.
For a movie on the subect, I recommed ""Bravo Two Zero.""  This is based on the book of the same name by Andy McNab, the patrol commander.  The story is presented in chronological order, the characters are much more clearly drawn and multi-dimensional, the action scenes are more realistic and easy to follow and the production clearly had a better budget.  I would just warn those unfamiliar with the subject that Bravo Two Zero, book and movie, have attracted controversy over thei accuracy.  However, such controversies are normal in the recounting of any famous event and the book and movie will give the audience a pretty good picture of what occurred, even though the details will be argued as long as the subject remains of interest.
In conclusion, avoid the movie ""The One that Got Away"", read the book and read and see ""Bravo Two Zero.""",1412985600,,2294,4.755667506297229
8213605,2,B000UL8UUQ,"I don't know if this was a bad copy or a bad video overall, but the quality was weak:  audio OK, but video was often soft, hazy and grainy (and not just during the green night vision scenes, either).

I haven't read the book to compare, but I know the broadest strokes of the Bravo 20 story.  Watching the film as a stand-alone, though, I have to agree with others who are underwhelmed at the portrayal of SAS soldiers.  I know they're not humans capable of leaping tall buildings in a single bound (unassisted, anyway), but were they really as unsure of the mission?  And I'd be hugely surprised (and I stand to be corrected) if SAS soldiers, by the time they'd been through selection and into a squadron, had never been in contact.

Worth adding to my DVD collection, if only as a foil to ""Bravo Two Zero"".",1378166400,,808,4.389261744966443
8213606,5,B000UL8UUQ,This is another fine retelling of a controversial SAS mission in the first coalition war against Saddam. Another version is shown in Bravo Two Zero with Sean Bean. Both are good films. It is instructive to view them in contrast with one another.,1326844800,,245,4.72093023255814
8213607,1,B000UL8UUQ,I totally agree with the guy above who was disappointed with this.  I saw an interview with Chris Ryan where he said that he was really angry about the makers of this movie not adhering to the true events of the story.  The movie suggests that Chris Ryan was the only serious guy in the patrol and the rest were a bunch of glory hungry morons that were constantly annoyed with Ryan. Ryan himself said that this movie is rubbish.  don't waste your time.,1247443200,14,452,4.357142857142857
8213608,4,B000UL8UUQ,"Raw, straight up! Gives you an insight into what stamina, physical ability and mental strength you would need when everything goes wrong. A good film for anyone interested in real life war.",1228262400,,189,4.9375
8213609,2,B000UL8UUQ,"This other version of ""Bravo Two Zero"" tells essentially the same story as the more well known movie starring Sean Bean which I liked very much. The difference here is this DVD has no subtitles so unless your English you'll miss some of what they say (like I did). Also a bigger portion of this film takes place at night so their is less to see on screen and it's harder to follow what's going on. But my biggest problem was in this version the SAS soldiers are portrated as confused, fearful, not very motivated, not very confident right from the time they're told of the mission. I have the greatest respect for professional soldiers so it suprised me SAS troops who are among the best special forces in the world,(professional, highly motivated & brave) would be portrayed as if they were naive, angry, draftee's who had no clue what they were getting into. I just don't think SAS men would behave this way and that's not how they are portrayed in Bravo Two Zero. In both films the heroism and service to ones country these men demonstrate comes thru on the screen and cannnot be appriciated enough.",1203984000,13,1102,4.570707070707071
8213610,5,B000UL8UUQ,"This is a TV movie (based on actual events and a book of the same name and written by Chris Ryan who was one of the SAS team members)  that can be considered a companion movie to ""Bravo Two-Zero"". This is the story of a group of British SAS commandos who are dropped behind the lines during the Gulf War to seek out and destroy the SCUD missles that were hitting Israel. The team is discovered and is forced to run for their lives. Several team members are killed and the rest capture. Chris Ryan is the only one to escape by walking hundreds of miles through the desert to safety. The real Chris Ryan stars in a current TV series called ""Special Forces Manhunt"" where he tries to avoid being caught by other commandos who are tracking him in various locations. Good story. Don't miss this one.",1196985600,24,794,4.364864864864865
