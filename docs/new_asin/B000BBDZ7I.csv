8324036,3,B000BBDZ7I,"This movie falls into a catagory of story which I absolutely adore:  Frame stories, such as the 1,001 Nights or the Canterberry Tales, in which a story begins and then a story within the story beins, concludes, then another story within a story begins and concludes, all before the main story concludes.

Compared to other independent movies, Grimm Reality is a technical masterpiece.  There is 3D animation, high quality sound, and minimal amounts of camera shaking.  The costumes and environment are quite authentic looking, aside from a pair panties that look completely out of place in the movie.

However, the dialogue attempts to capture the dialect of Shakespeare's day.  Perhaps it looked better on the page, but actors and actresses didn't quite know how to make the dialect work.  High quality nudity seemed to be a higher priority than interesting dialogue.  Personally, I'd have preferred the actors not even try to mimic ancient dialects and give a fuller a performance speaking naturally.

I feel that this movie is not really a horror movie, which it is advertised as.  The tales aren't scary in any sense of the word, which is not to say that they aren't entertaining.  Quite the opposite, I found many segments to be quite humorous, which I cannot believe that the producers accidentally caused.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Brothers-Grimm/dp/B000BKVQTS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Brothers Grimm</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complete-Brothers-Grimm-Fairy-Tales-Deluxe-Edition-Literary-Classics-Gramercy-Books/dp/0517229250/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Complete Brothers Grimm Fairy Tales, Deluxe Edition (Literary Classics (Gramercy Books))</a>",1177372800,6,1759,6.411016949152542
