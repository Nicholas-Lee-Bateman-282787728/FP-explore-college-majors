It begins in the ocean, killer whales swim and play together. One the shore a tape recorder runs. A scuba diver is in the water while a shark swims near. A fishing boat sails by and sees the shark, its target. The orca attacks the shark! The killer whale is a predator found in all oceans, and has a big brain. They can talk and have sonar. That fisherman hopes to catch an orca and sell it. That woman scientist objects to this plan. The captain harpoons a female orca and lifts it out of the water. Her mate swims near the ship and attacks it. They release the orca back to the sea, but it dies. A native warns the captain about the habits of killer whales. The local people don't like to have an orca hanging around, it scares the fish away. An orca attacks boats along the dock and sinks them!

The lady scientist, challenges the captain to seek the orca at sea. Nolan tells her what happened years ago to his pregnant wife. Another attack by an orca creates a fire and explosion! The people want to send Nolan to sea to fight the monster that haunts them. At night the orca attacks a house by the sea, knocking down the pilings! Will Annie fall into the sea? The next day Nolans ship sails out of the port. Nolan plans to throw an explosive into the sea. The orca leaps up to grab Ken! The ship sails north, there are icebergs in the water. Nolan throws a harpoon into the orca, an iceberg hits the ship! Before it sinks the jump onto the iceberg. The orca tips the ice sheet so Nolan slips into the water. The orca lifts Nolan and throws him against the iceberg, he slips into the sea. And so it ends.

Does this movie copy from Jaws? Is it similar to the story of Moby Dick? Is it like a horror movie where the monster triumphs in the end? Is it a story about animal life? This is at best an average story.",1517616000,,1830,4.163841807909605
