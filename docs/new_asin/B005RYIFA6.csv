8484435,5,B005RYIFA6,"This video brings to light an aspect of the Lincoln Presidency and the Civil War I had not considered.  To say I could have cared less about American history and the civil war would have been an understatement, until about a year ago, would haye been an understatement to say the least.  By that I mean. I chose a desk in the back of the room where no one would notice the thud when my head hit my desk out of complete boredom.  My priorities changed, however, when after around fifteen years in the medical field I had a stroke and had to look for a new direction.  I started doing some half-hearted genealogy and found out that my great grandfather was an officer in the civil war.  Hummmmmm, a new genre?  Maybe?  After reading around 80 books on the topic and watching a ton of videos, I became involved.  It wasn't boring any longer.  Now, it had faces, faces that had meaning, faces that had my name.  I started writing, researching, digging, and decided to write a book. In other words, I found myself completely absorbed in this time period. What did they eat?  What did they wear?  Where did they live and how.  How did they make enough money tp support their typically large families.  etc  it got to the point that my children would come to see me, ask how I was and if I needed anything, then quickly depart.  I might not have thought anything about it except one day I overheard my daughter say, ""Hurry up, we have to get iout of here before mom starts talking about the civil war.  Hurry, now, come on or we'll be stuck here listening to Sherman conquer the South. Of all the books and videos I read or watched, one stood out, it was this one, ""Lost River,""  I'm not promoting my book, it isn't even published yet. I have no  I'm not a teacher, I really have no idea why I'm writing this except to say, if you want to watch a video that brings a whole new connection to the publishers of any ot the books I have read, so I'm not plugging their books or publishing companies.  I've no connection viewpoint to Lincoln or those benefitting from the sales of his  his  memoirs, viewpoints, political papers,  his liberal viewpoint towards women during a time when women were usually a side line, and usually dismissed to the kitchen or nursery and who were never allowed to have their own valued opinion.  Those who were educated (be still my heart).  PLEASE, PLEASE, RENT, BORROW, ORDER, BEG YOUR LIBRARY TO OBTAIN IT OR, AS i DID GET IT FROM AMAZON  It will change your viewpoint on the man, the war and the way we think today.  PLEASE, PLEASE READ THIS BOOK, THEN ORDER IT FOR A FRIEND OR ENCOURAGE THEM TO GET THEIR OWN COPY.  Especially, if you are in a place where you are in a position to influence young lives in a way other than by standing at the front of the room and reading from the textbook.  (Boring).  You will be so glad you did not deprive yourself, as well as those you have the honor to teach the chance to see what REALLY HAPPENED",1522627200,,2961,4.330909090909091
8484436,1,B005RYIFA6,"Two word: Low Rent!  This is undoubtedly the worst Civil War movie I have ever seen, so bad I stopped watching after less than half an hour. the cinematography was stilted; it seemed to have been shot with a camcorder. The lighting was atrocious in any indoor scene, with the characters having an almost red coloring. The costumes were period, though the bowler hats many of the actor wore seemed like they had been purchased from a party store. Likewise, the mustache on the actor playing John Breckenridge not only made him look like Joseph Stalin, but was pasted on at angle! The casting was also very suspect. William Seward, a painfully thin man, was played by an actor who looked like Uncle Festus on the Adams family. Lincoln was better, but spoke his lines with what sounded like a lisp.
The dialogue was equally wretched, with the main character (Anna Ella Carroll) spouting things like ""I must go see the President"", and giving advice (You must suspend Habeas Corpus. The Constitution gives you that power) like a 19th Century Lisa-Simpson busybody. The William Safire Novel 'Freedom"" gives Anna Ella Carroll a large role. I recommend it for anyone interested in the fascinating woman, NOT this movie.",1499904000,,1211,4.85024154589372
8484437,4,B005RYIFA6,"The story is an interesting one and the Lincoln portrayal was first rate, but the overall video had all the professionalism of a home movie.",1379721600,,140,4.64
8484438,5,B005RYIFA6,So the opening scene was great but the film quickly showed its casting deficiencies. This was a unique woman in history with a gripping actual story handled by acting and storytelling amateurs. I give it five stars because I liked the music and think this independent cast deserves respect for trying.,1379635200,,301,4.921568627450981
8484439,5,B005RYIFA6,My hubby is a Civil War Reenactor and has a very small part; he is part of a group marching in a scene and I have honestly not viewed the entire movie. I will do that soon.,1370822400,,172,3.675675675675676
8484440,3,B005RYIFA6,"This story tells how a young Southern Belle was able to help President Lincoln plan a battle by deciding where to place the Yankee soldiers along the Lost River for an ambush. Although this was a low budget movie, it appeared many of the actors were volunteers who had practiced playing 'Civil War' before. It is an above-average movie. Enjoyable for what it is.",1361491200,,362,4.671875
8484441,4,B005RYIFA6,"This movie will not win any major awards, but it was very educational. It tends to be wordy with almost no action, but it's a part of history I had never heard of and that alone makes it worth the watch.",1343174400,,203,3.975609756097561
8484442,1,B005RYIFA6,"characters in this movie looked anime like, strange stiled movements, not horribly acted but very cheaply made. Watch on UTube for Free.",1328918400,,136,5.2272727272727275
