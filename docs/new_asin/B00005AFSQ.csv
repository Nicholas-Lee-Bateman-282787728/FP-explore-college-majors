7935328,5,B00005AFSQ,"Now fellows, don't go all serious on us. Offenbach meant this to be all in fun....as did Harnoncourt and the Company which performed it. No doubt it is true that the stage is rather more constricted than we are accustomed to at the Great Opera Houses, true, also, is the fact that more than a few of the gag-lines fall flat. Yes, the costumes are occasionally rather offbeat and, well, I guess, one can find a number of other failings if one really tries........but, despite these clinkers, most viewers will get their money worth of joy for two hours...a bargain at these prices. Singing by the principals
is first rate with the chorus joining in every now and then to add a measure of pleasure. The action is in keeping with the spirit of a farce and the orchestra does its job well. Beyond that, Offenbach has given us a lively score deserving of performance much more often than has been the case in the United States. Nothing dated, as lively as if written yesterday.
Oh, yes, vitally important, there are English subtitles which add immeasurably to the gratification to be found in the production..",1452556800,,1104,4.666666666666667
7935329,4,B00005AFSQ,"In the event you would wish to watch something very light, fresh, cheerful and relaxing in dvd form available operetes, then this may be your choice which you can enjoy until the end.

The music has a unique nuance of sound, which charcterized Offenbach's difference in music with other Italian based operas. It has the similarity to French music and liveliness. The fresh and cheerful comedy also add to the beauty of this operete.

The singers, Vesselina Kasarova as Helene and Deon Van de Walt as Paris, although rather unknown to opera lovers in dvds, are performing excellently and their voices, clear and rich, match with each other, adding the joyful nuance while their acting are very realistic and funny, as the comedy required.

The only bothering element is the doubtful attire or costumes in the operette, which looked rather silly and  which we are quite unsure whether it really represented the ancient Greek costume or made contemporary as addition to the funny situations.

We also enjoy listening to the magnificent and harmonious choir, making the whole performance very grand and superb.

Last but not least, the quality of recording is very good and therefore we can enjoy listening to this operete as I find that such fresh comedy and cheerful music  are not so many in choices.",1115683200,3,1299,4.931192660550459
7935330,2,B00005AFSQ,"This production is tres epatant for all the bankers and industrialists and moribund widows of Zurich on a Saturday night but is overblown, silly and distracts from the music. E Schmarre as the Swiss would say. Like all the productions - yes I mean ALL - at the world's most expensive but most bland Opera House the combination of must-be-Swiss chorus, players and above all audience reduces even the music to occasional jolliness but no thrills and even less magic.  The best thing to do with this is to turn it on for the music and don't look. Also don't listen too hard to the Francais Federal. Ugly! For real opera go to the cheapest seats in Vienna, New York, London, Berlin or Milan. Never be tempted into the horrid Zurich opera house. Not even to the front row.",1066262400,5,768,4.525179856115108
7935331,5,B00005AFSQ,"It is so rare to see an Offenbach operetta performed today that, if nothing else, this is worth the price for the sake of curiosity. It happens to be a delightful work (much of it used in Rosenthal's ballet arrangement ""Gait Parisienne""). The text is insouciant and witty, and the music sparkles. The beautiful Zurich Opera cast from strength: Vasselina Kassarova as Hlne is a delight. She also happens to be one of the pre-eminent artists of our time, a mezzo of radiant voice, temperament, splendid technique, with rare coloratura skills. Mr. van der Walt whose name looks Dutch sounds like a French tenor of old, a light but carrying sound, full of color, with heady top notes and truly elegant musical artistry. The supporting cast is all superb, with exact singing and plenty of joie. Nikolaus Harnoncourt, so long associated with Zurich in Monteverdi and Mozart does wonders for Offenbach. It is my understanding that 19th century instruments were used. The clarity, color, inflections he gets from his orchestra are astonishing. His inner drive, rubato, his sheer joy of music making comes through in every bar of the score. It is indeed a pleasure to see this conductor whom I first encountered in ascerbic albeit moving, austere performances of Bach Cantatas and Passions, making such successful excursions into the romantic theatre repertoire. I hope he has more up his sleeve. Get this DVD..... you'll go back to it. By the way, the production is nothing special but the acting is invariably good, with excellent rapport within the ensemble. It looks well directed.",1004140800,21,1576,4.996197718631179
7935332,5,B00005AFSQ,"Harnoncourt really captures the spirit of this light opera, and the entire cast seem to enjoy themselves, which makes it a thoroughly enjoyable experience. This is Offenbach the way it should be done.",1003536000,6,200,5.090909090909091
7935333,5,B00005AFSQ,"What a pleasure to see such an enchanting musical. Opera haters could even take a liking to it. It is simply fun to see such a wonderful, happy production. Titles are perfect and do not intrude and the entire cast seems to be having an absolute ball. The Met can continue to do snorers like Tristan but I will take Offenbach over Wagner any day. It has been nearly a half century since the Met has done any Offenbach except for Tales. A shame. In the climate the world is in today we can do much worse than see and hear Offenbach. This Helen is a sure cure for whatever is bothering you.",994377600,18,587,4.20353982300885
7935334,5,B00005AFSQ,"Adrian Edwards, the Amazon reviewer from England, is only half-right in his critique of this disc. The production, in fact, is every bit as enticing as the beautiful music-making that Harnoncourt elicits from the orchestra of the Zurich Opera house. In fact, it perfectly complements Offenbach's zany, endlessly melodious score and Meilhac and Halevy's surprisingly sophisticated libretto (which parodies the myths surrounding the origins of the Trojan War as well as the 'changing' morals of the Second Empire's elite). The costumes of the chorus are wonderfully inventive: ancient Greco-Roman togas filtered through a 20th-century post-impressionist artistic prism (Matisse and Picasso are especially invoked). The costumes of the leads are less 'beautiful' but even more pointedly comical/satirical: the two Ajaxes joined by their military uniforms as 'siamese twins'; Achilles' shield emblazoned with a cartoonish chicken (contrast Homer's account in Iliad 18); Paris' lederhosen is a particularly nice local touch (I think that everyone in the Swiss audience would have gotten the obvious allusion that somehow eluded Mr. Edwards).
Concerning some of Edward's really off-target comments: (1) The backdrop is not an 'awning,' but an exact replica (except for the color!) of the interior dome of the Pantheon--the greatest building to survive from ancient Rome. (2) To criticize Kasarova as not possessing the physical beauty of Helen is really inexcusable. In addition to being physically more attractive than 90% of most sopranos, Kasarova is, from a vocal and theatrical  perspective, 100% Helen: sultry, alluring, and flirtatious--the perfect coquette. In short, a disc to treasure.",993772800,30,1689,5.7023809523809526
