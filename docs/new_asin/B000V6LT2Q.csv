8216844,3,B000V6LT2Q,Pretty good low budget tongue-in-cheek horror flick. Not a lot of special effects and most of the gore was implied. Fun to,1366588800,,122,4.590909090909091
8216845,5,B000V6LT2Q,"The Bullions are a backwoods, inbred family of cannibalistic killers.  Don't stop reading now and tell yourself that you know this story, it's been done before in many films such as Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Motel Hell, and even the House of 1000 Corpses, as this film delivers a new story in this well-done sub-genre.

Alan Rowe Kelly wrote and directed ""The Blood Shed.""  Yes, many of the familiar elements of the sub-genre are found here.  Grandma's wheelchair bound, says very little, and is reminiscent of the Grandpa played by Ken Everett (RIP) in TCM2.  The inbreeding is evident in the children.  Alan Rowe Kelly plays the daughter, Beeftina, and pulls this role off to the ""T"".  And yes, there's a dinner scene or two that will surely make the weak stomached viewer wretch in disgust as the Bullion family eats some of the most disgusting food I've ever seen.

So, what makes this film different?  It's a well written and directed independent film with actors that deliver a product well worth watching.  It's a bit of a parody with homages paid to its predecessors.  These inbred cannibals live in New Jersey.  It seems almost like something you'd get if you crossed ""Hairspray"" with ""TCM"" and as bad as that may seem, it really worked quite well.

The cinematography, kills and gore f/x, costumes, and score all play into making this a great film.

Buy this film.  I'm quite sure you'll enjoy it.",1220572800,5,1406,4.75206611570248
8216846,1,B000V6LT2Q,"The fact that the central characters in THE BLOOD SHED are inbred denizens of the rural south who have a predilection for dining on the  skin and entrails of their neighbors is a clear indication that the filmmakers were inspired by Tobe Hooper's watershed classic, but the makers of this TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE wannabe clearly did not understand what made Hooper's classic so successful as a horror film.  Instead of emulating Hooper's dark satire of the lifestyle and mores of the southern US, THE BLOOD SHED is a merely a farcical travesty.  Most of the actors in THE BLOOD SHED are not first-timers or amateurs--unlike those in Hooper's film--but they try to pretend to be and, as a result, they actually fail to pull off the gritty realism of the performances in Hooper's classic.  Consequently, rather than creating characters that are both disturbing and memorable, the actors in THE BLOOD SHED merely take stereotyping to an all new level of atrociousness.

THE BLOOD SHED is yet another cheap direct-to-video attempt to exploit the resurgence of interest in the grindhouse-type horror of the 1970s, and any serious fan of those classic films will want to avoid this sub-par cardboard copy.",1216512000,,1200,4.98
8216847,4,B000V6LT2Q,"This is one fun, sick little movie that doesn't take it self too seriously. You may ask yourself what the devil is going on, but stick with it - and you'll find yourself in the middle of one messed up experience. Less plot driven and more a 'slice of life', it's gross, funny and at times very disturbing . What I liked best is that it starts out not too seriously and slowly gets less-funny and darker as it goes on. Very different than anything you've  seen before and beautifully filmed for a film with such a low budget.",1197158400,4,524,4.292929292929293
8216848,5,B000V6LT2Q,WTF did I just watch....this was a really weird and interesting movie ....I just loved it...kinds reminds 1 of 'Pink Flamingo'...if you love Texas Chain Masscre ..and Spider Baby...then this is the movie for you...this is now my fav movie ...excellent is all I can say,1195171200,10,268,4.8478260869565215
8216849,5,B000V6LT2Q,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I didn't know what to expect when I first saw it.

It was hilariously funny with all the gore I love. Alan Rowe Kelly certainly  knows the horror genre and how to make a movie that will appeal to horror fans.

Its much different from his wonderful I'll Bury You Tomorrow. That was pure terror, whereas Blood Shed mixes in some humor.

From beginning to end, I was glued to the screen. I was actually disappointed when it ended. I wanted it to be longer!!!!!

This is one fan hoping to see the Bullion clan emerge again!",1194480000,6,552,4.372549019607843

Each character's personna is rich and believable in a dememted way.
Beeftina's passion for her career, her father and brothers' passion for her just about made me jump up and squirm!
Coming from the advertising industy, it is good to see the pretensious and arrogant get what is coming to them in the true Boullion family fashion!
THE BLOOD SHED is a true horror treasure!

 ..."" Kind of reminds one of Sid Haig's SPIDER BABY !""
 Parts of `Addams Family, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Little Lulu', Really not too meshable.
 One seriously has to wonder what this cast thought at auditions,first day of filming...This is painful to watch...NOT because it has no artistic merit,It REEKS Artistic Merit...It questions what you can handle on a minimum pain threshold.
One  thing to really rub the wrong way of this critic, Micheal Gingold  (Of FANGORIA column fame) WTF ???",1193356800,,606,5.01
