8257327,3,B00153ZQXW,"I own the Strange Days box set that has all 6 episodes included. I love it and use it all the time in my lessons as a teacher. My ONLY issue with this DVD is the title ""Strange Days 2"" which implies a separate season. It isn't. It's just episodes 5 and 6 that I already have from the box set. I am sure it is accidental trickery and I will give it to another teacher to spread the word, but I would have bought something else I could have used in my classroom.",1396310400,4,460,3.904255319148936
8257328,5,B00153ZQXW,"I bought this DVD separately and was so impressed I decided to buy the whole 3-disc set a month later.  This second DVD is particularly well-done and is very helpful for those who want to focus their understanding on Earth's oceans and water.  It is sophisticated on an adult level but easy for kid's to follow, as well.  Ed Norton does a great job, too.",1285372800,2,354,4.415384615384616
8257329,3,B00153ZQXW,Documentary raised important problems of the Earth well beeing. But I don't like directing of the movie. It look like ecology is separate and Edward Norton's great shoes are important part of the movie. Really strange !!!,1244851200,,221,5.0
8257330,5,B00153ZQXW,"The short vignettes walk the viewer through a given scenario along with one or more scientists working on a specific issue.  The videos show good science, that is, science being done properly from the initial question or questions, to conclusions drawn from the available data.  This often leads to additional questions, but that is the nature of science.  Older kids love these videos!  The videos make science more real to them and they get to see the scientific process occurring on topics that are in the news and impacting their lives.  I love the way the stories often tie together seemingly unrelated topics, showing how the world is connected and that what's happening in other places can impact us in our little area of earth.  I highly recommend both the first and second season of Strange Days and am hoping for more seasons in the future.",1239926400,3,850,4.787671232876712
8257331,5,B00153ZQXW,"I bought this DVD for my father in law for Christmas. He is one of those scientific-guru mixed with physics guys. He absolutely loved this dvd, and the original one. He watched them immediately after receiving them, and every day after. Not my personal choice.",1231286400,,260,4.8
8257332,3,B00153ZQXW,"Informative and insightful, but my application was for middle school science ecology use.  As the problems increase in span and complexity more time is needed for the presentation and explanation.
The first program was easier to break up for classroom use.  NG provided lesson plans to facilitate classroom use, for the first set of programs.  Apparently the second set doesn't have the classroom support the first did.
  I enjoyed previewing the disk at home.  Easy to understand for high school or college students with prior knowledge of chemistry and ecological concepts.  I am not sure how to break it up into bite size chunks for science7 classroom discussion...yet",1229040000,6,671,5.157407407407407
