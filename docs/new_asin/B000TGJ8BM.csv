2899452,5,B000TGJ8BM,"This is an eclectic and emotionally charged series that, while not an entirely new idea for television, has something that most of the other shows on television are sorely lacking: a storyline that is still enticing after four seasons.  While the obvious appeal to those wanting to watch shows with taboo subject matter, this series focuses more on the challenging lifestyles of its characters and approaches the select few special circumstances that they face without overly glorifying them.  In fact, it's hard not to identify with them and easy to forget the somewhat trivial issue of their sexual identity.  It's a great series that crosses some social boundaries and colorfully illustrates the notion that they are still people, and when it comes to its challenges, life doesn't differentiate between any groups of people.  Definetly a must-watch.",1202428800,5,852,5.242647058823529

2899455,5,B000TGJ8BM,"'The L Word' itself is great however the DVD interface, navigation and extra material, still need some work.
I miss the option of subtitles in the main international languages; even in English is useful for some people.
Nevertheless congratulations to everyone behind 'The L Word'; an important piece for peace.",1195084800,13,311,5.24
2899474,5,B000TGJ8BM,"I bought these seasons of the L Word only by reading reviews. I am so glad that I did. It is a very addictive and seductive show. I love everything about it. I can't wait until they make more seasons. I will continue to purchase these, and I recieved them very fast in the mail and they were in excellent shape. I TOTALLY recommend buying them!!!
One hot and steamy show that makes you want to be part of it.",1211241600,,408,4.1125

2899477,4,B000TGJ8BM,I liked the first three seasons of the L word. The fast shipping was great. But had major problem the last two dis. It would stop in the middle and couldn't continue.  I never did see the season final.,1207785600,,201,4.153846153846154
2899478,5,B000TGJ8BM,"Obviously well exceptd series and some time cliche and unrealistic hower the L Worl explores a microcom of Lesbian love, value and life issues. The word is groundbreaking, exciting and hot. Stereotypes and cliches abound, along with  some truth. Fantactic, fund and addictive.",1207440000,,276,5.4186046511627906
2899479,5,B000TGJ8BM,"The L Word is an addictive show.  You have to get all four seasons together, because having to wait between seasons given the amazing cliff hangers will drive you crazy.  The show is a great mix of tragedy and comedy, loss and eroticism.  Mia Kirschner as Jenny is a spectacular actress with tremendous range.",1207267200,,309,4.685185185185185
2899480,5,B000TGJ8BM,"Can't handle the long months between seasons, so I purchased this set and now whenever I want, I can have gorgeous, exciting and amazing lesbians and their drama in my living room.",1206921600,,180,4.65625
2899481,5,B000TGJ8BM,This is a great gathering of history making video. There are deleted scenes included within the set. It's well boxed so it will last a LONG time.,1206230400,,145,4.407407407407407
2899482,5,B000TGJ8BM,"Every season so far has topped itself. The writing, acting, directing are superb! If you love drama, love a good love story, and just plain want a great story than this show is for you. It has a little bit of everything for everyone. The cast is one of the most dynamic on television today. You won't regret giving this a shot. We love it and can't wait for the next new episode. We love it so much that while we are waiting we watch the seasons over again. You'll love it!",1205107200,,473,4.1521739130434785
2899483,5,B000TGJ8BM,"I accidentally bumped into The L Word while flipping through the movie channels late last year while looking for some unboring to watch. I don't know quite what it is about this series... exceptional writing, great acting, the relationships, the need to discover who we are, the need for a sense of belonging, or some combination. Whatever the case, this is the most addictive series I have watched in years. The characters seem to be real people living real lives facing real issues without the typical superficial Hollywierd fluff.",1204502400,5,533,5.0

8209323,1,B000TGJ8BM,"I am not very happy with the product I bought from you, I think you must let the people know the specific information about ecah item, when selling a dvd you should write down the info about this product, as if it can be read by any dvd player or if it has several languages spoken or subtitles. We are spanish speakers.
Actually we hoped we could watch the movie in spanish, at least read the subtitles in spanish.
I won't ever buy movies at amazon. This is the second time that happens to me.

( I sent this comment to the seller some days ago and they even haven't answered...)",1261094400,,580,4.225225225225225
8209324,4,B000TGJ8BM,"I love the l word, I think it is an amazing show. Shipping was fast problem is on some of season 4 the episodes skip and won't play which is really weird. I don't know if anyone else is having this problem but there aren't even scratches on the disc and it won't play. Everything else is great.",1234137600,,294,4.086206896551724
8209325,5,B000TGJ8BM,"my friend and I have been enjoying these shows. This is our ""me time"". I am very glad I purchased these.",1226361600,,104,4.0
8209326,5,B000TGJ8BM,"I had previously watched bits and pieces of the l word from limewire, of course that sucked that i could only get random episodes so i had no idea what was going on. so i decided to buy the 4 season pack, and i have got to say that this is an amazing show! The characters are very intriguing and are very well portrayed with the actors. Once you start watching, you won't want to stop, so if you are just going for one season, i would highly reccomend just getting all seasons while your at it, because you will come back to get the rest and it will only be more expensive if you buy them separately, so just go for it and get them right now!",1225152000,,642,4.0234375
8209327,5,B000TGJ8BM,"The L Word is a groundbreaking hit series on Showtime which got me hooked!
It's one of the greatest show on television.  The L Word to me, represents the different lifestyles in the LGBT community. The love, friendship. affairs, arguments, sex, lust, family, all 'real life' issues are laid out in this show. This show changed the way I think and it changed my life. It's a sexy, hip, it's a phenomenal series. Don't let others fool you, this show is the best show ever and it has one of the best actresses ever. Ilene Chaiken is remarkable what she does! If you are a hardcore fan of The L Word, get this package. It's worth it! I love it! We need more shows like this, keep breaking that class ceiling. More glasses needs to be swept.",1222473600,,736,4.372262773722627
8209328,5,B000TGJ8BM,This show depicts the life of lesbians in a different world and yet they are also showing situations that are really met by lesbians. It is good to see this kind of shows especially since the place I am in is so restricted and most lesbians are closeted cause we have so many homophobics here. THIS SHOW ROCKS!!!,1222041600,,312,4.396551724137931

8209330,5,B000TGJ8BM,"I loved the L word after seeing season 1. I'm so glad I waited to get the majority of them together! I couldn't stop watching! This show is one of my favorite shows of all time. This 4 pack really is a great savings off of retail price for the individual seasons. My only complaint would be that seasons 1 and 2 have regular sized DVD cases and seasons 3 and 4 have the slimmer cases which makes seasons 1 and 2 noticeably bigger. It's not really a complaint just something I noticed.

I am so happy with this purchase, I would definitely recommend it to any L word fan. Thank you Mr. Bush for my economic stimulus check... It certainly stimulated this gal...",1212969600,,659,4.314516129032258
