8132452,5,B000GHZZJS,Highly recommended feel-good movie for any person with sense of humor. Warm and original. Amazing acting. Cole Porter's songs adds charm. It's a shame that it's not available on DVD in R1 format.,1213315200,,195,4.9393939393939394

Yet another tale of gay doom and gloom, of another sad old closet case and his rosy cheeked ruffian of a love object, of unrequited lust with the inevitable gay-bashing episode thrown in...this time set in Dublin in 1960 - not that you'd tell from the inappropriate haircuts or Finney's dreadful accent!

What was the point...really? The film tells us nothing new. It neither illuminates or entertains. Why cast English actors faking the ""Orish""? Why bother casting Brenda Fricker in such a nothing role? And as for referencing Oscar Wilde yet again? *YAWN* Change the record, why don't you?!!

Despite its ""Fairytale"" ending, this film is simply a rehash of worn out old clich&eacute;s. (Would his passengers really have publicly stood up for a ""sodomite"" in Catholic Ireland in the 60s? - Dream on!)

Inauthentic, boring and clich&eacute;d. Not recommended.",1154736000,,902,5.115646258503402
