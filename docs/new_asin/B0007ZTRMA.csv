Similar in style to Straw Dogs, but I liked this film better! Highly recommend this to thriller fans!",1499731200,,325,4.719298245614035

8054859,4,B0007ZTRMA,"There are apparently two versions of this film, though to the very best of my knowledge only this one - ""Wolf Lake"" - has ever been released on home video in any form. It runs just under 88 minutes (including credits) and includes flash-forward sequences at the beginning of the film that seem to have been crudely integrated into the opening reels in some kind of poorly thought-out attempt to 'raise the stakes' or unnecessarily add tension to a scenario that's already rife with it.

The alternate version, called ""Honor Guard,"" I suspect (I've not actually seen it) has a pretty similar running time, has no flash-forwards and its ending is even grimmer than that of ""Wolf Lake."" My guess, too, is that this was writer-director Burt Kennedy's original version of the film. I base this on nothing more than supposition and fairly close familiarity with his oeuvre. But I could be totally wrong about that and am open to anyone who knows better telling me otherwise.

This film comes at the tail end of the 'backwoods revenge' cycle that started with ""Deliverance"" and bears some resemblance to other movies in this sub-genre, like ""Death Weekend"" (1976) and ""Open Season"" (1974). The cast, as well as the skill of Burt Kennedy behind the camera, elevate what could have otherwise merely been a rote exercise in hippies-vs-old guard rape-&-mayhem flick. It does, perrhaps, aim a little higher than it should in terms of attempts at relevance and depth. But at least it does try and occasionally, even, succeeds, which is more than other films of this ilk do.

Plus, you get to see Robin Mattson's boobs.",1439510400,3,1605,4.829090909090909
