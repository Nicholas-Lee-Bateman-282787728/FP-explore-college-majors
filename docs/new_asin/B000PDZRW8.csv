2816724,2,B000PDZRW8,"This is without a doubt one of the best TV movies ever. The acting by Powers Boothe alone is worth seeing. However, this version is not remastered & quite frankly looked much better on TV in 1978!
Buy another version. The clarity & the sound are awful!",1202428800,7,252,4.382978723404255
2816725,5,B000PDZRW8,The movie is recorded on a DVD-R. This info should be included with ad. Quality is very poor as if it is a bootleg.,1185062400,12,115,3.8333333333333335
2816726,1,B000PDZRW8,"The quality of this DVD is horrible. In the bottom right of the picture throughout the film there is a logo that says ""RE"", which stands for Reel Enterprises. Hopefully a ""real"" company will release this film with a decent transfer, not one that's been transferred from a VHS tape.",1181520000,21,281,4.64
2816727,3,B000PDZRW8,"The Film: What we have here is a star-studded, made-for-tv docudrama centered around the life & death of Jim Jones and his People's Temple. Powers Boothe, while he doesn't necessarily look or sound like the real deal, captures the darkness of Jim Jones' persona. The film begins in Jonestown with a mock ""loyalty test"" after which Jones, tormented, takes a trip down memory lane. We see his childhood, during which he frequented church services, conducted pet funeral services with childhood friends, witnessed the abusive nature of his parents' relationship(his murder and torture of small animals was left untouched). We witness his becoming a pastor, the first pastor to conduct integrated services in Indianapolis,IN,his marriage, and ultimately, after the success of the People's Temple as a congregation and humanitarian effort, we see his moral and mental decline:drug usage, bisexual affairs, pro-claiming himself divine, physical/verbal abuse of members, all culminating in Jonestown,Guyana with the murder/suicide of nearly 1,000 People's Temple members, Congressman Leo J. Ryan and others. As with many other docudramas, there are a few changes of identity & fact to protect the innocent(and to captivate the audience via dramitization. As a film, Guyana Tragedy is a masterpiece...as gripping as it is chilling. As a film I give it 5 stars.

DVD Quality: Having waited nearly 2 decades for this movie to make it to dvd, I placed my order immediately upon learning that the film had finally come out in dvd format. However, upon it's arrival in the mail, and having just watched it from start to finish...what one can expect from the quality of this product is what happens when major distributors decline the marketing of movies such as Guyana Tragedy, when the VHS tapes are old enough to decay, and when an indpendent ompany picks up a film and makes a last minute, amateur,desperation effort to transfer the movie from VHS to dvd. There are no menus, no special features/extras, no interviews...just a poor transfer from VHS to dvd, and you can tell because the film skips, is obviously NOT remastered(cloudy, grainy, discolored, the sound tends to rise and fall when it's not skipping out,etc), particularly toward the end of disc 1 & 2(at one point the movie scrambles a bit, blacks out, and repeats a scene during the climax). Awesome portrayal of one of the most tragic mass suicides in history...poor dvd. So while I give the movie a 5...the quality gets a 0.

Therefore, the best I can give this product is a 3...the other 2 stars will be added when they remaster/re-release the film. In the meantime, may the Lord bless & keep the families/survivors forver impacted by the tragedy.",1180396800,33,2703,5.071910112359551

2816743,5,B000PDZRW8,I seen this movie when I was a little girl. I read the reviews here about this disk set being poor quality. Well I am watching it as I am writing this review. If you are my age and remember watching tv back in my day this movies quality is no different. Its still a good movie and powers booths is still handsome and done a great job. quality good reminds me of when I watched it as a little girl. You people have to remember this movie was  made back in a day when we did not have HD TV. I am glad I added this to my collection.,1429660800,4,529,3.809090909090909

2816746,3,B000PDZRW8,"The Guyana tragedy, one of the largest mass suicides in history.  I have read and watched just about everything I can read or watch on this subject.  I am obsessed with how people can brain wash other people so easily. You have to remember Jim Jones was able to take a group of people and have them move from Indiana to California and then on to South America.  He made them give up everything from their families, their homes, their money and their lives.  Everything to be given to him.  It's just unbelievable that so many people can be so weak minded.  The movie itself is actually pretty good.  The events are pretty accurate but I swear they have changed the names of some of the people involved because some of the people in the movie I have never heard of or read about.  They did forget many things but all in all the movie itself is pretty good.  The quality of the movie is horrible.  It's like watching a documentary.  I will say though that the movie is so engrossing that you do forget about the quality after awhile.  I liked it but I do wish they had covered some things that I feel would have made the movie much better:  I think they did need more of Jim's childhood and how controlling he was even as a child.  I was really suprised that there was nothing about his and wife Marcelline's ""rainbow family.""  They only had one child that was there's and most of the other's they had were adopted.  They had a few white children, a black child, an Asian child.  It was very taboo for that and therefore they were called a ""rainbow family.""  I wanted to know where some key people were like Archie Ijames, Jack Beam, Grace Stoen, Tim Stoen, Sharon Amos, the Houston family and Maria Katsaris.  Like I said before, they may have been in it and had their names changed but I don't think so.  Adding these people would have greatly improved the story.  While they did show Father Divine (James Earl Jones), they never showed how Jones did attempt to take over his people once Divine died.  No mention that he may have fathered John Victor Stoen.  This was a huge story because he may have been the father of this little child when he had an affair with Grace Stoen.  He even took him to Jonestown where he died.  There was nothing about the eight defectors and the trouble they caused Jones.  I would have loved for them to show how Jones claimed he was a sexual being and would have others admit that they loved being a homosexual or a lesbian.  He said he was the only true heterosexual and everyone else was not.  I also wish they would have focused on some of the other people who went with Leo Ryan to Jonestown like Tim Reiterman, Jackie Speier and news anchor Don Harris.  There was nothing about Leo Ryan getting attacked within Jonestown.  The Jonestown massacre was done very well but the action at Port Kaituma was not.  They made it appear that no one made it out, but there were some that survived.  There was also nothing about the massacre at Lamaha Gardens which was Temple Headquarters.  Sharon Amos was ordered to kill everyone.  She actually kills son Martin-8, daughter Christina-11 and then she asks her other daughter Liane to kill her which she does and then Liane kills herself.  Chuck Beikman, Sharon's husband and another girl Stephanie Jones-9 I believed survived.  It would have been good to show that as well.  Now, I did like at the end of the movie that we never actually who kills Jones.  Some say loyalist Maria Katsaris did the deed, but most believe extremist Annie Moore, who also by gunshot, did the deed.  Again, the movie is very good and does show a lot of what happened but I would have liked to have seen the other things I mentioned as well.  I would say check it out but be warned:  The quality is terrible.",1347580800,,3763,4.427113702623907
2816747,5,B000PDZRW8,"I simply love this film.  It makes you feel like you're actually there in Guyana.  The acting is marvelous and what more can be said about Powers Booth's performance?

If you have any interest in the Guyana tragedy, or you remember when it happened, be sure to see this.",1279584000,2,270,4.469387755102041
2816748,1,B000PDZRW8,"I am a serial-killer buff (maybe I should more accurately say a serial-killer-STORY buff!) and I LOVED this movie when it first came out on TV. When I saw that I could get it on DVD I was thrilled. I shouldn't have been. Both the picture and the sound seem to be a copy (excuse me, a POOR copy) of a poor copy (excuse me again, a BAD copy) of a really AWFUL TV copy somebody made on their VHS hooked up to their TV with rabbit ears . . .

8190787,5,B000PDZRW8,"RELEASED TO TV IN 1980 and directed by William A. Graham, ""Guyana Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones "" chronicles the life of Jim Jones (Powers Boothe) from his childhood in racist rural Indiana to the launching of his church, The Peoples Temple in Indianapolis, to their move to northern California and, eventually, The Peoples Temple Agricultural Project, better known as ""Jonestown"" in northwestern Guyana.  The last act, of course, involves the cults infamous mass suicide and murders, which left 918 people dead.

The movie (a two-part mini-series) shows that Jones started out with good intentions, but his obsession with the social gospel and its inherent socialism (i.e. communism with a smile), as well as his deviation from sound Scriptural hermeneutics, his many adulteries and his increasing drug problem destroyed him and any positive impact his ministry had in the early years. While the movie starts out with some contrived scenes (the black boy in the barber shop), it soon picks up steam and becomes gripping to the dismal, shocking climax. Remember: THIS REALLY HAPPENED.

The picture scores high marks on the female front with Meg Foster and her mind-blowing eyes, curvy blonde Linda Haynes and winsome cutie Diana Scarwid. Veronica Cartwright is also on hand as Jones wife.

ADDITIONAL CAST: Randy Quaid plays Jones accountant, Brad Dourif his drug supplier (physician), Michael C. Gwynne his bodyguard, Colleen Dewhurst his spiritual mentor grandmother and LeVar Burton an increasingly suspicious disciple. James Earl Jones has a glorified cameo as Father Divine. There are numerous others.

THE FILM RUNS 3 hours and 12 minutes and was shot in Atlanta, Georgia, and Dorado & San Juan, Puerto Rico. WRITERS: Ernest Tidyman wrote the script based on Charles A. Krauses eyewitness account of the events; he was a reporter who was traveling with Congressman Leo Ryan (Ned Beatty), who visits Jonestown in the last act.

GRADE: B+/A-

Unfortunately, this is a weak DVD rendition of the movie, a poor transfer from VHS with the corresponding cloudy, grainy, discolored picture quality, not to mention the sound tends to rise & fall or skip out. Still the movie itself makes it worth having even thought the DVD is poor.",1511654400,,2232,5.132231404958677

8190791,5,B000PDZRW8,"The movie is great, but I wanted to help narrow down which DVD to buy.

I have the Reel Enterprises version with three separate pictures on the over and I can confirm that it's horrible. The audio features a constant high pitched whistle throughout the entire movie. It's almost unbearable. The DVD company's logo is in the corner throughout the entire movie too. How appalling. I've never seen a DVD manufacturer do that!

I can't personally speak for the Alpha Home Entertainment one with the green cover, but judging by the reviews, I doubt this one is much better. At least I don't see anybody complaining about whistling or a production logo.

The VCI Entertainment release with the white cover and a close-up of Jim's face seems like the best release of the three that are currently available on Amazon. It is a dirty film print that was probably taken from a VHS, but the audio is better the Reel Enterprises one and there are no company logos on it. It seems to be the most watchable of the three.",1453852800,3,1005,4.572222222222222
