8502341,4,B006OT0T84,"This film is a hoot - completely irreverent and silly. A fun watch if you're a fan of dopey humor and purposefully cheesy acting. This film knows exactly what it's doing, and it does it well. Also, the clown characters in the movie, for once in modern film, are not ""scary"" clowns - just dopey goons.",1459382400,,300,4.375
8502342,2,B006OT0T84,"I have to say, I think there's actually an argument that could be made for some kind of serious study of this film as a commentary on modern society. However, as horror or comedy, or horror-comedy, it's just a schlocky weekend-shoot video. Some folks enjoy these kinds of films, so there are people out there who may enjoy it. I couldn't watch it all the way through. But, it was a novel concept with some clever one-liners.",1418256000,2,424,4.51948051948052

8502344,5,B006OT0T84,This movie is nothing but B movie madness at it's finest. While it does lack some integral parts such as a backstory or a discernible plot line it makes up for it with scenes so ridiculous that it's easily worth whatever the going price of the DVD is.,1388880000,,251,4.25
