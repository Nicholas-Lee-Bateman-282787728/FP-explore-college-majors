8695800,2,B00RRSHNXU,"The Curse of the Werewolf, 1961 film

It begins in 18th century Spain. A beggar arrived in the town square on a public holiday. Some complain of their taxes. The beggar goes to the Marquis castle and asks for charity. The nobles mock him and give him wine; then put him in a dungeon. Years pass. A servant girl displeases the Marquis and is put in the dungeon. She cant call for help. Later she is given to the Marquis, but defends herself. She fled to the forest. She is rescued and given shelter. Afterwards she has a baby boy, then dies. A dead goat is found with its throat torn out, it must be a wolf. The hunter is ordered to kill the wolves. At night Leon went outside and was hurt; he has bad dreams. A priest explains how an evil spirit can enter a human body, such as a werewolf. Is there a cure?

People talk about a full moon attracting a werewolf. The hunter creates a silver bullet to shoot a werewolf. Young Leon is grown up and leaves home to find work. He loves the daughter of his employer but she is promised to another. Leon visits a sporting house on a Saturday night, but he feels ill (the full moon). What will happen now? Leon does not remember what happened that night. Must he be chained night and day? He runs off, the police question him. Leon wants to leave with Cristina. But the police arrest him for murder! Cristina arrives, does she know about his affliction? Will a silver bullet save Leon? The full moon causes a change in Leon! He tears down the bars and escapes jail. A crowd pursues him, he climbs a roof of the church. The bells ring, a man fires his gun and kills Leon.

Is this the worst werewolf movie youve ever seen? It was based on The Werewolf of Paris by Guy Endore, which few have read. I read that the movie legends of werewolves was created by Curt Siodmak, a screenwriter for many horror films of the 1930s-1940s. The opening scenes of the nobility remind me of The Hound of the Baskervilles.",1492387200,,1944,4.291553133514986

8695802,4,B00RRSHNXU,"The movie is amazing, and the quality is very good.  One major thing that should be noted however... this is a BURNED disc.  It is a burned BluRay disc, but not an original factory replicated disc.  Some players won't play them.  The packaging is nice and it was received on time.  I just feel that the price is pretty darn steep for a burned disc.  Most bootleg discs sell for 10 bucks at conventions.  Almost 28 bucks for a dub seems like quite an overblown price.",1471651200,,466,4.348837209302325

8695805,5,B00RRSHNXU,"The most impressive Blu ray release of any Hammer Horror movie I've purchased so far is the Spanish Blu ray of CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF. Its extremely sharp, the colors are lush and the sound quality is very good. Despite it being a Spanish release with the title LA MALDICION DEL HOMBRE LOBO it is region free and plays great on my NTSC USA Blu ray player.  In close-up face shots of the actors you can distinguish hair detail, skin pores, mistakes in make-up etc - all very impressive on - my 50 inch TV. Some of the Sellers on the Amazon page for this Spanish release, based on their descriptions, are not selling this version and even suggest that they aren't even selling a Blu ray copy! When region B locked DVD versions are listed under this region free Blu ray ad, you really can't buy from those sellers because you don't know what you are really ordering. My copy of this Spanish Blu ray region free I purchased from DaaVeeDee and it was the right one. About the Spanish release - it has no extras other than the Trailer. Who cares? You are buying a Blu ray of CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF to get the highest quality image you can get and in my experince this delivers that. Highly Recommended.",1448928000,3,1194,4.378378378378378

The BD plays perfectly on region ""A"" players, the Blu Ray disc it's a region ""B"" and PAL system. Spoken in castillian. Spanish latin american NOT available.
