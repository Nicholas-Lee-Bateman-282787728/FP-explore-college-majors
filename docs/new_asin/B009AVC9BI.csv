5311136,5,B009AVC9BI,"This series is very addictive, and it is worth buying. Most animes lately seemed like a JOB to get through, but after each episode of Qwaser of Stigmata, I was left wanting to watch the next episode, so this series is truly a guilty pleasure.",1358899200,4,242,4.4
5311137,3,B009AVC9BI,"Right off I will let you know, IN MY OPINION, this is a fetish anime for those who love breast and for those who have a fetish about breast feeding. I can't argue that this anime is gorgeous, that the action scenes are very good and Sasha is one of the coolest anime characters. I would have to say he is even one of my favorites. But the one flaw, and its an important one in my opinion, is that in order to gain power, or stamina, those who fight must breast feed. It's a ridiculous plot twist and ruins an otherwise very good anime.
So if you have a nursing fetish,or don't mind lots of breast feeding, and like lots of big boobs, then this anime is for you. I didn't mind the boobs as much as the nursing part, it's just tooooo way out there for me. It is definitely an alternative concept on how to become more powerful or gain strength. I don't watch hentai so maybe it's a common theme. This could have been a 5 star anime, but I give it 3 stars because there is a lot of good action, it looks good (sans the nursing parts, although that is a matter of opinion) and the story is not too bad either.",1358380800,7,1105,4.073394495412844
5311138,2,B009AVC9BI,"The action sequences in this anime were cool, but this was one weird series. I probably got to episode 2 before tossing it.",1358121600,,123,4.391304347826087
5311139,5,B009AVC9BI,"I Really liked this anime. My son and I have watch it more than a few times.

But, it is way over-priced for me to buy here.

I bought this direct from Japan(not bootleg)for $18.00 and got way more for my money. It is the same subbed product anyway, I got the complete
collection, not just half like this offering. I just had to wait two weeks to receive it, but it was worth it because I saved over $60 in the long run.",1357344000,3,420,3.988095238095238
5311140,5,B009AVC9BI,"This story involves the conflict between two pseudo-religious organizations,one of mostly good guys,Althos, and the Adepts,one of people less inclinded towards ""holiness"",both sides populated with people complete with human emotionalities,desires and goals. Some,on both sides,are utterly souless,evil,if you will. Through a series of torture,cruelity beyond belief in the real world,murder of children by the score,human experimentation in dark and evil-looking institutes,children are ""created"" and raised as Qwasars,people with the special skill of being able to manipulate an element and the training/conditioning to use this skill towards the desired ends of the organaization. Enter Sasha the Martyr,a Russian 13(?)year-old and a Qwasar,the manipulator and user of iron.
The setting for this story is a private ""Christian-centric"" school,the St. Mikhaillov Academy in Japan. The two principle stars are Tomo,the overly developed daughter of the previous headmaster who suddenly and mysteriously disappeared,and her adopted sister and ""prince in shining armor"" and the star of the series,Mufuyu. On their way back to the dorm after school,Tomo trips over a person,laying unconscious on the walk. After taking the body to their room they deciede to see if it is a boy or girl,only to have the person suddenly disappear out the windon. Mufuyu gives chase only to discove flames comming from the church. In it she is taken prisoner by a qwasar. Now the story begins. And,you may be well taken aback when you see what transpires.
If boobs were puppies this series would look like a jail break from the Gotham City dog pound. A ""serious"" storyline is wrapped nicely around the very well drawn and played characters but,it is all about boobs,""oppie"" as the girls like to call them as they bounce them,squeeze them and suck on them. There is an endless parade of boobs,so much that even a ""knockerholic"" will be left with a hangover.
There are 36 episodes already ""on the street"" with a storyline that sets up for more. Nudity is plentiful. There are no Nazies,no Germany in the Middle ages,but there is a ""czarina-in-wanting"" that looks like and is built like a 6th grader that is a serious lesbian sadist.
No sex except an scene of Katja,the sadist,forcing her new sex ""slave"" to apparently sodemizing her. This series can be a bit nast as is not for anyone under 17. Very well draw and played  but it is up to the customer if the price is affordable.",1350345600,21,2451,5.158291457286432
5311141,4,B009AVC9BI,"I've waited along time for this Anime to come to the states. I'm a little upset to know that Sentai got ahold of this in knowing they would not DUB this Anime but still knowing it's going on my shelf is Awesome. Can't wait for the rest of the to come out. I will say that the animation is great and the action is even better.

When Mafuyu Oribe and her adopted sister Tomo rescue a strange wounded man, they have no idea what they're getting involved with - or what the consequences will be. Alexander Nikolaevith Hell is an Iron Qwaser, one of many opposing factions of super-warriors who can each draw upon the power of an element and wield it as an almost unstoppable array of weapons. Unfortunately for Mafuyu, Alexander's faction is there to gather the mystical relics known collectively as the High Circuit, which puts her friends, family, and school at ground zero in a battle for the fate of all mankind!

But there's an even more disturbing twist, as Qwasers require a special liquid diet to manifest their powers, one provided by the women who serve as Qwaser partners. The nursing Mafuyu's already given Alexander isn't the only kind of nursing he needs!",1350259200,9,1165,4.596153846153846
5311142,1,B009AVC9BI,"Here is my review for the manga which is identical: This series is the worst garbage i have read/watched in the last 10 years and i have experienced all sorts of ""line crossing"" garbage MD Geist/Urotsukidoji, Cannibal Holocaust and whatnot else but these are nothing when compared to this franchise which gets even worse as it goes along. An example would be a later villain Eva Braun (Hitlers wife) who is a immortal lesbian who rapes younger clones of herself to death to stay alive. I don't get it eater and no research went into making this manga as the religious and historical facts are all wrong and Germany is presented as a country that looks like it is visually stuck in the middle ages. I am from Germany by the way and am part russian so this burns double for me and the low average rating at for example animenewsnetwork supports my own rating here so read/buy something of actual quality as Berserk, Vagabond or Blade of the Immortal. These series are also ""mature"" but in a good way and don't celebrate the rape of underage schoolgirls like this piece of trash. Seriously this series is rape play the comic [anime in this case] and it is even a a shonen manga in japan so it is suited for all ages. Very classy Champion Red and shame on you for translating this filth Sentai Filmworks but they suck so i don't care.",1350172800,13,1330,4.477366255144033
5311163,5,B009AVC9BI,"I would advise that if you find breastfeeding disturbing, you shouldn't watch this anime. Sasha gets his powers from soma, which is another word for breast milk.",1390435200,,161,5.0
5311164,5,B009AVC9BI,"Just a heads up: this anime is for 16 year olds and up. It has panties, naked breasts, and things that I mentioned in the first review I tried to post on this got me in trouble for the content. This anime almost crosses the line in a different territory if you know what I'm saying. I love it though. This is one of my favorites. I collected all of it.",1375401600,2,352,3.971830985915493
5311165,5,B009AVC9BI,"I first heard of this anime around the forums that it was almost like a hentai due to it having a huge boob fetish. So far I'm enjoying it a lot, I personally am not into to loli's but man.... Katja is a sadist loli that makes me laugh too much that I enjoy her crazy things and makes the show quite more enjoyable.",1373932800,2,315,3.9375
5311166,5,B009AVC9BI,"The only thing bad to say about this dvd is that I wish it was Dubbed so I could pay more attention to the action. This one is on the Hentai side, nug nug wink wink say no more.",1371686400,3,177,3.5641025641025643
5311167,5,B009AVC9BI,Its a great Dvd and deserve a twenty on the rating scale. I recommend  to anyone who want to watch it,1366243200,2,101,3.8095238095238093
5311168,5,B009AVC9BI,now this was a bit of alrightit came in good time and was everything you said it was I just thought it was kick ass,1364947200,2,115,3.64
5311169,4,B009AVC9BI,"First this anime is not for children. Yes most people find the breast fetish evident in the series a turn off, but I think it gives the story a nice twist. There is a good bit of romance throughout the story and a couple of twists you may not expect. It is a very sexually suggestive anime aside from the constant breast exposure without actually being in the porn category. For those of you who want to know a little about the story line, the story is about a group of people known as qwasers. They are able to manipulate the elements. There are two sects the Adepts (the bad guys) and Sasha's group (I'm sorry the name eludes me right now). Qwasers use breast milk to fuel their powers. Hence the reference to the breast fetish. Each qwaser has a Maria that provides the breast milk and helps him or her fight. Sasha was groomed from childhood to be the ultimate sacrifice to bring about the end of the world. The story focuses on his struggle to stop the Adepts with the help of his friends. My favorite episodes are 9, 11, and 12.",1363392000,5,1034,4.3076923076923075
5311170,5,B009AVC9BI,"I'm surprised I'm giving this anime a higher score than Queen's Blade (that has a plot and developed characters despite the fanservice). But before I talk about the fanservice, I want to talk about everything else.

When I saw this anime, it looked like a horror/action that revolved around churches. I wasn't wrong but I wasn't expecting the fanservice...and the breast sucking caught me off guard...it really did...

The story is very complicated in retrospect but the main plot is this. Two girls from a Japanese Christian school Mayufu and Tomo are first scene being bullied by the entire class. They are outcasts despite the fact that Tomo's father is the one that kind of owns the school (or irony). As they're trying to survive, one day Mayufu comes across a mysterious boy named Sasha. He is a hunter of the the Adepts. He's out for revenge of the Adepts killing his sister and scarring his eye and he'll use any means necessary. When Sasha shows up, the villain gang known as the 12 Adepts start showing up at the school attacking (and molesting) the girls there trying to find the Blade of Maria.

What I find ironic is how DARK this series start out as and then it gets light hearted as it goes on...and that's really a turn off. The series opens up with a serial killer killing someone and the blood splatters all over the place similar to Higurashi. Plus, the bullying scene at the beginning hits home because its portrayed realistically in my eyes (some people took the scene out of context and said that the scene looked like a three girl lesbian threesome...which is actually annoying given the topic was very serious in the first episode). Note the bullying does stop when Sasha comes into the lives and stands up to them (in a rather humorous/fanservice way). Also, Katja's introduction is also very dark as she's shown in the opening killing three (?) men after they tried to take her ""mother"" away. There is also another episode on the nun Teresa and the talks about the Yugoslav war and shows really dark scenes. This series isn't afraid to show rape in a horrifying manner (the flashback was not fanservice at all because you couldn't even see any private parts and it's shown from young Teresa's eyes so it adds to to the horror). Alas the anime took out the mention that she's claustrophobic because of what she witnessed.

Also, the series isn't afraid to shy away from the yuri/shotacon/lolicon (WHERE'S MY YAOI?!) pairings. Katja is apparently older than what she looks like (12) but I find that hard to believe even with her BDSM streak. Despite the really bad fetish that comes with her, she's one of the more interesting characters not elaborated on in the series given how you rarely hear her thoughts.

Which is another thing, the characters are well developed despite the fanservice. I might even add that Mafuyu is a great character that she should be in a series like Durarara because her strong personality doesn't deserve to be in a fanservice anime like this. Sasha might be the Allen Walker of D Gray Man by appearance but his personality is what makes him different. His crush on Mayufu is adorable given its brought up how he won't suck her breasts because he finds her unattractive (AKA her boobs are too small).

The artwork and the music (especially the music) are AMAZING. Never have there been so much detail in little things (like boobs).

Another thing I think this anime does well is how all the characters (heroes and villains) fight. They all are assigned an element on the periodic table and you really have to know chemistry to understand how the objects work. This is a very amazing concept since I don't know any other anime that uses the periodic table as a weapon list. Like the cool guy Ootori uses sodium as a weapon but if you didn't know that it looks like he's using fire powers (he's based on Roy Mustang BTW).

Alas, this anime is not for everyone. Many people are turned off because this anime is infamous for the breast sucking. If you get past that and all the perverted moments...which are a lot...but half of it is fanservice and the other half is very serious you'll be surprised that the plot is very good. I enjoyed the first part of season 1 better given the dark themes.",1362355200,5,4244,4.634308510638298

5311172,5,B009AVC9BI,"Interesting story and nice, fluid animation.  A bit strange and quirky, considering the main character gets his power from suckling on the breasts of various females.  Fans of things big and bouncy will not be disappointed!",1360281600,5,223,5.166666666666667

8538845,4,B009AVC9BI,I liked this series a lot the animation was very good I liked the main characters the premise was something that only anime would come up with and actually make and that is what makes me an Anime fan I would have given this series four and a Half stars if they would have let me. Sure it's got a lot of nudity and sexual situations some of which was gratuitous and I would agree with that but that's the nature of this series so it didn't really bother me. I would  very much recommend it to the adult fans out there and others who aren't so sensitive to this type of anime. Give it chance.,1393718400,,590,4.086206896551724
