3619612,5,B001GT9DQG,"I must say this anime was quite a surprise to me. I usually pick out the dark fantasy type stuff, you know like Hellsing or Blood: The Last Vampire (anime NOT the movie) or Vampire Hunter D, etc. So when I bought this I was... hesitant. But I really am glad that I did. The characters were very likable, the drawing was good, but I liked it because it was fun. It made me smile and laugh, while still giving some action, drama, and a little dark stuff here and there too. I am very glad I bought this. Without giving anything away however I must say that the last episode or two were... um... lol... special. Very good, I would recommend it for anyone looking for something fun, quite entertaining.",1277596800,3,698,4.33587786259542
3619613,5,B001GT9DQG,With Vampires being so hot now it should sell well. It is very well done.,1273622400,,73,3.933333333333333
3619614,5,B001GT9DQG,"I really enjoyed this series. The music and artwork are very well done. The plot has its highs and lows, but it was never dull.
The slight variations in the ending scenes/songs/riddles spice things up - I wish other anime series would take note.
Very creative work going on beyond the actual story itself.

Enough quirky stuff to keep all ages entertained.
Highly recommended!",1273276800,3,376,4.875
3619615,4,B001GT9DQG,"The shipping was fast and the product arrived in perfect condition. I have not watched the entire season yet, but so far it is interesting. It helped that it was on sale or I probably would not have purchased it without watching it first.",1273190400,,238,4.431818181818182
3619616,4,B001GT9DQG,"I will agree with most of the other reviewers that this is a very good series. (I will not go into an in-depth review, as other reviewers have already done so.) The only thing that I really disliked about it was the fact that I found the opening credits, music for the opening credits, and the teaser for the following episode especially annoying. I thought they were too childish cutsey and it almost made me not want to finish watching the rest of the series. Fortunately, the quick fix to that was just bumping thru all that to get to the series itself, which, as I stated before, is a very good series. I really did enjoy watching Moon Phase.  Hazuki's voice is also a bit irritating and childish, but it suits her. This is not your typical vampire anime and you may not like it because of that, but give it a try. The price is more than fair, you get an entire series for about or less than what you would pay for a new release DVD at Wal Mart (I purchased mine here on Amazon from Amazon for about $20 including tax and shipping).",1271462400,,1036,4.258883248730965
3619617,5,B001GT9DQG,"If you're a fan of cute anime girls, paranormal activities, or pre-teens with vampiric tendencies, then you will love this series.

5/5

And, just as a side note, the package arrived exactly as described, so you won't be disappointed by ordering from Amazon as opposed to other sites.",1270598400,,284,4.895833333333333
3619618,4,B001GT9DQG,"-Box Artwork-
The box is slim and thin. Can be easily disformed if improperly stored.

-CD Cases-
Contains only two very slim cases with two characters on the backside. The frontside features the phases (aka series) that are grouped by episodes. Opening these contain two disc with picture artwork inside the disc.

-Extra Features-
Comes with advertisement of upcoming titles and a postcard to fill out to Funanimation. There are no special features on the disc except the 4th disc which are textless endings and openings, however it doesn't contain all the endings/openings. Boo.

-Languages-
Contains both English and Japanese versions along with the option of subtitles.

---Music---
The music fits the scenes and mood of the show. There's a very nice soft-spoken song at the end credits that I would recommend listening to.

-Plot-
A supernatural photographer comes across a mansion in which he sees a mysterious girl ontop of the roof. Her name is Hazuki and she has been imprisoned in the castle for many years, waiting for the day that her freedom would come. Now that ""he's"" here she'll be set free from the castle. But this seemingly 'innocent'-like girl has an spoiled attitude of her own and is determined that he will become her servant, whether he wants to or not. However, the Master and his servants are searching for Hazuki, to bring her back to the castle and convert her back to her 'proper' form permanently.

Good:
-Humor, laughs, and frying pans?
-Artwork is gorgeous and interesting at times
-Vampire girl dresses as a cute kitty?
-Fights are interesting/cool. The Count's ability to ""change"" from bending light is a interesting battle to see.

Bad:
-May be turned off that the main character age difference.
-Hazuki can appear to be 'seductive' at times. Again, may be turned off by this.
-We never get to see the ""Master"" in this series. Maybe he'll be in the future?
-Hazuki's voice is annoying in the dub.
-*Spoiler* is Elfried's relative?!

A cute,eye-candy rewarding series to watch. Like vampire stories but don't like the intense overly-dark plots? (Vampire Hunter D, Hellsing? then moonphase is for you. Although moonphase does has humor it never looses sight of it's true objective and can be serious at times. A definite and recommended buy with a love factor thrown in the mist.",1245456000,8,2313,4.943298969072165
3619619,5,B001GT9DQG,"Excellent blend of suspense with a lot of humor. Not one boring, or filler, episode! Great storyline and a hilarious last episode to wrap up the show!! Ann Z.",1234396800,2,158,4.482758620689655
3619620,4,B001GT9DQG,"The description's plot is a tad inaccurate, as the story revolves around Luna and ""The Master"" (not seen in the episodes*).

Hazuki, aka Luna (only when wearing the pendant on a full moon), is trapped in a castle. Kouhei is enlisted to help Hazuki break free of the castle's barrier, and ""adopts"" Hazuki into his family.

There are actually two stories within this series: Hazuki adapting to a world where people care about here after being left alone and ""The Master""'s attempts at restoring Luna. The two stories intertwine nicely and the overall plot is well written.

Hazuki's character can be a bit annoying at times (especially whining about Kouhei being her slave). Monica Rial, who voiced Hazuki, does a good job but at the cost of a high-pitched whining little vampire. I wish she would have used Luna's voice instead, but such is life.

The additional characters, such as Grandfather, are a welcome addition to the story and actually offer substantial meaning to the plot. There are times when the show seems a bit dark, but is quickly brought back with the family style bickering between Kouhei and Kazuki.

It won't take long to feel for Kazuki despite her difficult transition into the real world, especially near the end of the series (no spoilers, sorry). In short, take advantage of the low cost of this collection and enjoy it.

This collection is tastefully done. While there are a few bathtub scenes, nudity isn't present, nor does it contain over-the-top sexual innuendos. However, some elements of darkness may not make this series suitable for those under the age of 13.

*Since we don't see ""The Master"" in this series, I would certainly hope a sequel is coming. I would love to see one.",1233532800,14,1710,4.815699658703072
3619631,5,B001GT9DQG,"I was a little skeptical when I purchased this anime series, but it does have my favorite voice actor in it. Like my title says, this is a really cute anime where a photographer enters a cursed castle and releases a young girl from imprisonment. I love the caharcter Hasuke, and the others a great as well. Monica Rial did a really good job as Hasuke's english voice actor. This anime reminds me a bit of Negima!? because her character looks and sounds just like one the characters from there. I recommend buying this!!",1317081600,,519,4.531914893617022
3619632,5,B001GT9DQG,"This is 1 of the best anime's ive seen in along time. The story's pretty well been covered by others so i won't go into that. Let me just  say this is a great show for anyone who likes magic,vampires, comedy, a bit of action, good char development, good story line, and just a touch of romance.
Only thing i disliked was that it ended way to soon for me, i really got into all the chars, story and found myself wanting another season by the time it ended. Dont do what i did and pass this 1 by, i hafta admit i had been passing it up mainly becase when i 1st seen the cover it look like something for little kids or young girls i as wrong in a big way.
This is well worth the 17$ thats with shipping, for this gem of a animie.
Great animation, voice acting is top notch.
I really would like to see a 2nd season and the master come in or at least a QVA.
Hope it becomes avilble on blu-ry soon to, so if your looking for  good anime i would definatley recomend this 1.",1312502400,,966,3.948717948717949
3619633,4,B001GT9DQG,"This is a good anime series, which I enjoyed.

Had to clear something up though.  Some people are under the misconception that Hazuki is 100 years old or something.  Not sure where this idea came from, because the show does not convey this at all.  She's 12.  The series hints heavily at her young age, and one of the earlier shows tells how her mother left 2 years ago.  It also shows her at a younger age, and growing up (she was born a vampire, and is still growing up, so her physical appearance IS her age!)  However, the Manga pegs down her age exactly.  So yes, some of these scenes can be a little icky with that in mind.  The one thing that annoyed me throughout the series was when she sucks blood, she calls it a kiss.  It's a bite!  Kisses don't draw blood!

That aside (and at times, it IS hard to put it aside), it's a very light, fun, series.  She's a child learning about things, but learns fast.  And she really can be adorable.  The inclusion of the dozen other characters makes the series worth watching, though.  Elfriede (a German vampire lady), Ryuuhei (Kouhei's grandfather), and Seiji are my favorite characters, although they all were likeable in some way.

I'd think this is a good show for teens or above.  Depending on the parents, though, because it does have vampires in it, violence, and romance.  Overall, the show is very 'cute', which is inline with the current Japanese cuteness rage. ([...])

If you read the wiki on this series, there are serious plot spoilers in it, even in the character summaries, so if you have not watched this yet, please be warned.  Yes, there is a plot in the story and it's pretty decent, especially for Anime.",1312502400,,1673,4.473509933774834

I have to say that I did buy the soundtrack casue I loved the score for this anime alot. The story-line is good,but did leave some unanwswered questions; characters are great. I had mixed emotions watching this anime, it had a lot of drama and comedy which is great^^ I do recommend this anime to buy, good to have in your collection:)",1311552000,,508,4.141414141414141
3619635,5,B001GT9DQG,"This is a very ecconomical set that contains all the eppisodes of this series.

""Moonphase"" is a great anime that is full of comedy/drama and one that, in my opinion, any anime fan should own.

Anime is getting much cheaper than it once was, and hopefully the new cheaper price will ensure that anime continues to be popular and be licensed in the U.S.A.

I didn't think it had the annoying filler episodes that some other anime's have. As some other reviewer mentioned at first there seems to be an age difference between the two main characters, but you do have to remember that she is a vampire so she could be 100 years old. I don't think that should be a deterrent. Even if your not that into anime you are sure to like this one. I give it an +A.",1298419200,,523,4.137254901960785

3619639,5,B001GT9DQG,"From the previews you'd think Moonphase is a serious vampire series. Well you'd be wrong. Moonphase is a well balanced mixture of comedy and serious storyline.
  Moonphase is about the adorable but bratty vampire Hazuki wanting freedom from the evil Count Kinkell so she can find her mother. This is just a basic description of the plot but there are more storylines involved.
  The cast of characters is great , but the real standout gem is Grandfather whose blend of seriousness and off the wall humor make the series a worthwhile purchase just for him alone.
 I don't want to give too much away and spoil the story, but if you're a fan of vampires , great characters and humor , then you should get Moonphase you won't be disappointed.",1288396800,2,738,4.6461538461538465

8306913,3,B001GT9DQG,"The dark, creepy vampire lure scenes are very interesting. I enjoy their take on turned vampires serving their sire without consent and special humans (called ""vampire lovers"") being able to give blood without the risk of becoming enamored by the vampires. The ""cute"" filler scenes, however, are extremely irritating. There is a conclusive ending, which not all animes have. Overall, the show is average and deserves 3 out of 5 stars.

Hazuki and Kohei go to great lengths to get stronger and protect the happy life they have together.

This anime was a lot fun to watch. There are a lot of great gags and fun comedy. The silliness isn't too much, too mask the seriousness of the strong feelings they share. The animation is good and the voice acting is too. One of the unique things about this anime is the soundtrack. It has a lighthearted and playful vibe that suits the show perfectly.
