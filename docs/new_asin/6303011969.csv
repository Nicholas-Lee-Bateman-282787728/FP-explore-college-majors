  Kudos to the writers for putting together a  script that works so well and pooh on Leonard Matlin for being so huffy  about this film!",914716800,2,307,4.224137931034483
533590,5,6303011969,"I have watched this movie over and over again. Armand Assante, usually a serious actor, looks like he is really having fun in this crazy comedy.

533648,2,6303011969,"This review is for ""Fatal Instinct"" I am reading other reviews highlighting actors that are not in this film such as Armand Asante & Ned Ravine; and story lines indicating this is a spoof or comedy. None of this is true. This film is predictable and silly, not funny and certainly not a spoof. Just a not very entertaining who dunnit film with a lot of cliches.",1494633600,2,361,4.402985074626866
533649,1,6303011969,"This particular film is not the spoof by the same name. It's a thriller about a pair of detectives looking for a serial killer. It's well acted with lots of action and suspense with lots of false leads and twists. However, I have given it only one star because this ended up being a pilot. And a pilot that obviously did not get picked up, so you won't ever be able to view the conclusion.
You do find out who the real killer is at the end... but it doesn't matter, because the story stops there and you will be left with a feeling of having wasted an hour and a half - never to find out what happens afterward.
Too bad, because the ending that leaves you hanging has the makings of a continuing thriller.",1494288000,5,705,4.1911764705882355

533695,3,6303011969,"I would have given this 5 stars (I love the silly comedies), but they've re edited this movie (slightly) and changed some of the music in it.
If you've never seen this movie, you probably won't buy it anyway. But if you have... You'll be scratching your head about the changes.
Van Morrison's ""Brown Eyed Girl"" is no longer in the hat/dance scene, and the circus music (that's probably old enough to be public domain) that plays while Sean Young spins the plates has also been changed.
Couple that with the ""In-a-gadda-da-vita"" scene in the bathtub having the song that they are discussing removed and replaced with an unknown substitute, and you get dissapointment.
Anyone who hasn't seen this movie won't be too terribly affected by these changes, but I was. I used to watch this movie fairly regularly until VHS went the way of the dinosaur.
It's still funny, seeing it in letterbox is great, the cast is quite good. If you like the campy spoof movies of today, you will probably appreciate the film (if you can pick up the references).",1471737600,15,1039,4.683060109289618

533725,5,6303011969,"Fatal Instinct is a super under rated film
I think runs circles around a films like Airplane, and the Scary Movie Films, along with all the ""cheap"" and lazy parody films as of late

It's complex but, overly silly film that parodies maybe too many films?
In many ways it's to ambitious for it's own good
but, if you seen it during it's first home video run on VHS you probably love it or hate it
I personally love it for what it is

The Cast is really good
Armand Assante  as  Ned Ravine (cop/attorney)  He is so dead pan and plays everything so perfectly straight you can't help but, appreciate his performance!
Sherilyn Fenn  as  Laura Lincolnberry Ned's secretary who is in love with Ned but, has some secrets of her own!
This is early 90's Sherilyn Fenn looking stunning a real under-rated actress
 Kate Nelligan  as  Lana Ravine Ned's wife who is a cheating  wannabe murderer  (The first time i seen this i never liked Kate's performance but, over the years after countless viewings of this film she does a great job she's channeling a female from Casablanca or the Maltese Falcon it's easy to miss or just not catch with all the silly sight gags but, Kate Nelligan does lots of heavy lifting in this film
Sean Young  as  Lola Cain  (Great performance all around she's mimicking  Sharon Stone from Basic Instinct but, with a few twist) Every time i see this film I can't help but, wonder what if she got the role as Catwoman in Batman Returns.... Over the years Young has been over-looked or just thrown to the waste side which is such a shame! she always had this massive star quality you see less more and more as of late
Christopher McDonald  as  Frank Kelbo the  mechanic banging Ned's wife somewhat in front of him But, Ned is so wrapped-up in his duel jobs to see it! Ned is not the best detective......  McDonald is such a great actor he can do anything
James Remar  as  Max Shady  (most people will know Mr. Remar from The Warriors or  Dexter) He's just fun in this film plus the
 name Max Shady is such a great name!
John Witherspoon as Ned's detective partner  Arch you don't get nearly enough Witherspoon (he too is usually great in everything he does!)
you also have odd cameos by the likes of
Blake Clark, Tony Randall and Clarence Clemons

I've had almost every home video version of this film
The VHS cassette was average at best (for the time it was gold)
The Laserdisc is until now the only way to see this film in it's original Widescreen format Original aspect ratio: 1.85:1
the MGM DVD was average it was full screen and the PQ was so/so (I think the LD version looks better then the dvd) it was MGM catalog title so they put very little money into a home video release
This new blu ray by Olive Films  is the closest thing we'll ever get to a Special Edition/Collector's edition
The film is presented in widescreen  Original aspect ratio: 1.85:1
It looks the best we'll ever see it imo  (It's not Ultra HD but, for a film from 1993 they did a good job and tried to transfer HD and it's very good
The audio is A+  next to all the previous home video versions
DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0

Extras include:
 the original commentary track with Director Carl Reiner and writer David O'Malley (ported over from the MGM dvd)
Deleted Scenes  feature optional commentary by Reiner and O'Malley  (these deleted scenes are more like workprint footage)
Original Theatrical Trailer in HD 1080p

It's without a doubt worth the $13.99 price break you also get cool extras if you have the MGM dvd upgrade

Everyone except 1 or 2 in this film are complete and utter idiots which makes the movie even more hilarious.

The main character is truly one of the most clueless and stupidest characters in a spoof.

This is just one of many hilarious facets of Armand Assantes character: In a few scenes he is wondering what clothes to wear....the clothes are all the SAME as what he is wearing  lol.

534000,1,6303011969,"Fatal Instinct, 1993 film

This movie is a parody of many other murder mysteries from the past. It starts out similar to Double Indemnity (the book is better than the movie). It has elements of Fatal Attraction as well. There are many sight gags that occur faster than I can write them down. Few made me laugh, they are often incredible. Watch the smoke coming from Lola Cains mouth! Many of these skits are silly or inane rather than funny. We see Mac Shady released from Sam Quentin prison. Ned Ravine is warned about this by his secretary. Ned buys an unusual pet for his wife! The story is loosely based on the plot of Double Indemnity [a fictionalized version of the Snyder-Gray murder case]. Shady is out to get Ravine because of his conviction.

Neds wife Lola wants to get rid of him and collect Triple Indemnity due to an unusual combination of events. Yet this would make her the #1 person of interest in the real world, especially with her friendship with that auto mechanic. [A copy of The Postman Always Rings Twice.] Only one of the pair could have an alibi. Did Lana kill Frank Calbo? Lola saw it, but said nothing, even tho she hated Lana (prior relationship)? Upstairs there is a scene in the bathroom. [A copy from another movie?] This movie could have been funnier if it was more restrained. Using so many movie references dilutes the quality as few viewers have seen them all and understand the scenes.

I think this movie is a deserved failure. Maybe more writers could have made it better? Committees aren't always wrong, especially if they are united in purpose. For a much better and funnier movie see Wrongfully Accused, a parody of The Fugitive movie.",1402876800,,1677,4.620805369127517

Surprisingly, Armand Assante who is not known for doing comedy, plays the lead and  his role is that of a cop who is also a lawyer.

The basis of the plot is thin, but it is ample enough to give the actors an avenue to  spoof on film noir: the thriller and crime classics of the movies.

Assante is in the role that typically Leslie Nielsen would play.

  I wasn't sure if he could  pull it off- but surprisingly, he manages to do it.

However, no one will ever compare to the goofy and loveable Nielsen.

 So don't expect the same degree of belly laughs- he is no Nielsen.

In fact, this movie would have been better if Nielsen had been in it and there had been more work  done on the jokes and more depth to the plot.",1395446400,2,926,4.146892655367232

534193,4,6303011969,"A wild spoof of suspense and film noirs, I appreciated this silly film a little more than most being a big fan of ""noir."" As with any comedy, the movie is a combination of genuinely laugh-out-loud gags and sight scenes and genuinely stupid lines. It depends on what makes you laugh.

One thing it has for sure: lots of sexual innuendos and just plain overt sexuality. It's yet another one of these PG-13 ratings that is a joke. This is not for kids.

Also, this film won't be much for those without a knowledge of classic crime films of the past, from the '40s to the '80s. Many parts of this movie parrot scenes from Fatal Attraction, Body Double, etc. It takes several viewings to catch most of the inside jokes.

Armand Assante is the smooth private detective and Sherilyn Fenn is his attractive and loyal secretary. Kate Nelligan, Sean Young and Christopher McDonald add to the fun.

To be frank, I enjoyed this more on the first viewing than I did on the second. After watching it twice, I thought the film would have been better had it been cut 10-15 minutes, and it's only 90 minutes. However, I am not knocking it: it's a fun movie.",1234396800,,1140,4.466346153846154
534224,4,6303011969,"Fatal Attraction may well be Sean Young's revenge on Michael Douglas. Sean played his wife in Wall Street, but she clashed with Mr. Douglas and director Oliver Stone, and her part was whittled down to a splinter. There are so many stories about Ms. Young, about her uncanny knack for bad luck (was cast in Batman as Vicki Vale, but due to a horse riding accident the night before shooting she wound up in a cast, not in the cast), and her erratic behavior (left a disfigured voodoo doll on James Woods' doorstep, dressed as Catwoman to confront Michael Keaton and Tim Burton in an attempt to get the part). I wondered why she was a magnet for misfortune, but after she heckled Julian Schnabel at the Directors Guild Award, then went into rehab, announcing that she was an alcoholic the next day, the wondering stopped. Still, I really admire her acting, in spite of--or even because of her bad behavior. I loved her in Blade Runner, and she was fabulous in The Boost. I heard that No Way Out may be her best role yet, but was unable to locate that title. I liked her a lot in Fatal Instinct. She was a blonde, which allowed her to have more fun with the role. Because, it is true that blondes have more fun. She is funny, sexy, and did I mention beautiful? Pretty good for an alcoholic.

Sherilyn Fenn is another favorite of mine. From the time I saw her tie a cherry stem in a knot with her tongue as Audrey Horne in David Lynch's Twin Peaks; I have been fascinated by Fenn. Fenn is quite fetching as April Delongpre in Two Moon Junction, one of those trashy, stylized, but somehow smokin' hot pieces of confection they were cooking up in the year of 1988. I must make mention of what I would assume is one of the biggest flops of all time. Boxing Helena is about a surgeon who amputates his love's limbs so he can keep her in a box. How that project ever got the green light, I'll never fathom.

In Fatal Instinct Sherilyn plays Laura Lincolnberry, a love sick secretary who pines for her boss, and will do anything for him. It is not the best use of her talent. She is too steadfast and forthright, I like her better when there is a hint of subversion, if not downright perversion. She seems like she would be a very nice girl in real life, but on the screen I want her to be a little more dangerous. She did a competent job, but this movie wasn't really her cup of absinthe.

Armand Assante plays Detective/Cop Ned Ravine. He arrests them, and then defends them, in an amalgamation of the two roles Michael Douglas played in Fatal Attraction and Basic Instinct. Though he is not quite a Leslie Nielsen, or a Michael Douglas for that matter, he is very funny and perfect for a spoof of this nature. A scene where he dances to Brown Eyed Girl by Van Morrison in red high heels shows his commitment to the part, and that he will do anything for a laugh. Assante was superb in The Mambo Kings with Antonio Banderas, by the way. He is very good in Fatal Instinct, as well.

Carl Reiner directed this movie, and he did an excellent job of it. Usually spoofs are much dumber, but this one was much more sophisticated than I expected. Besides the usual slap stick and sight gags, there is some more subtle humor that skewers Film Noire conventions, such as the hard boiled detective doing voice over narration, seemingly followed everywhere by his own personal saxophone player (in this case portrayed by Clarence Clemmons). There is a running gag involving the atmospheric sound track scores of classic Film Noire, and another one that I don't want to spoil for you involving subtitles. That is all I will say about it, as to go any further down that path might spoil your enjoyment should you find yourself watching this film some day.  Carl played Alan Brady, the fictional comedian that Rob Petrie wrote for on The Dick Van Dyke Show. His son Rob was Meathead on All in the Family, before going on to direct his own films as well. There is a point to this tangent, and it is that there is an aspect of Nigel Tufnel's amp with a knob that goes up to 11 from This Is Spinal Tap that is parodied in Fatal Instinct. Rob Reiner directed Spinal Tap, so it is an instance of father spoofing son, and the catharsis is complete.

One last bit of trivia, there was a film made in 1991, two years prior to this one, also called Fatal Instinct, but incredibly, it is NOT a spoof. Maybe that is where Carl Reiner got the idea, when he realized it was a perfect title to spoof both Basic Instinct and Fatal Attractions, two hit movies starring Michael Douglas. Reiner realized he could spoof them both, and much of the film noire oeuvre as well.

Smell the glove.

Well, they call that irony where I hail from--and just how does one typecast anyone when the film is meant to be a parody? The lead not known for his comedic chops? Seems Leslie Nielsen wasn't known for his comedic chops which made him (and a bunch of other old hams) ten times funnier when he turned up in ""Airplane."" Again, something about irony. Irony. Hmmm. What is that? Someone respectable from the UK I believe recently said that Americans lack a sense of it. It's our national failing, our fatal flaw. It's the real reason the world hates us, we don't get anybody's jokes (I heard that exact complaint from a German no less).

To get straight to the meaty core here, this movie is great fun if you like Airplane, Kung Pow, Hot Shots II, or any of the other wacky and wise parodies and satires that came out during the last decade or two (Now then, aren't I being helpful?). If you're a ""Scary Movie 1 through 20"" fan this may not be your cup of hemlock (I'm helpful here too, trying to save you a few bucks). There's zaniness for its own sake (which really seems to confuse some people) and the courser stuff isn't driving the bus (Yet even more helpfulness on my part, I'd say).

So, basically, if you're a highly intelligent person, likable, talented, with a great sense of humor and irony, an achiever, a born leader, a scholar and a lady or gentleman, then you should own this DVD. If you're a scabrous lurching Neanderthal look elsewhere for entertainment.

534233,3,6303011969,"I saw this movie when it first came out and wasn't too impressed, but after catching it on cable the other night I might have to rethink my opinion.  Coming out in the early 90s, Fatal Instinct had to go up against Naked Gun and Hot Shots and then the poorly made Loaded Weapon I.  But, a decade later, the spoofs have fallen in quality.  The most recent, Scary Movie 3, was made by David Zucker, a man who should no what he's doing.  Yet, Scary Movie 3 felt forced and tried to hard to be funny.

Fatal Instict, starring Armande Assante as a cop/lawyer is a throwback to the way spoof movies used to be made.  I'm not saying its great, but the think I noticed is how serious all the actors are.  They have no idea they're in a comedy.  There is one scene where Assante eats the filling out of an Oreo cookie.  The scene cuts away then cuts back and Assante has eaten the filling out of an entire box and the torn apart cookies are littered throughout the kitchen.  Assante and Sherilynn Fenn carry on their conversation like this is normal.

Fatal Instict also stars Christopher McDonald, the actor I first noticed in Happy Gilmore playing Shooter McGavin.

Fatal Instict isn't a classic, but it is a solid spoof movie that knows to be a good spoof movie, the actors must believe they are in a drama.",1114646400,2,1301,4.330578512396694

I was wrong. It started off ok, but the more it went along, the less funnier it got. It didn't have anything I would consider to be lasting quality either.

I give it 2 stars because it had a couple of bits I did laugh at, but this film could have been so much better.

534257,5,6303011969,"This movie was on tv about a week ago. I could not stop laughing. The comedy is top notch in much the same lines of The Naked Gun/Leslie Nielson movies. On DVD, the experience must be as hilarious as its original release in 1993. Armand Assante (yes a serious actor in a comic role really works although they could have easily used Leslie Nielson for the part) stars as the victim of the scheming Lola (Sean Young) who will stop at nothing to see his marriage ruined. Like the title suggests, the movie is a cross between Fatal Attraction and Basic Instinct. Those were the two most standard thrillers during the early 90's period. Both films starred Michael Douglas as the target of a scheming and obscessed woman. The laughs keep on coming as the obvious parodies are executed. I.E. the famous Interrogation Scene in Basic Instict, the murder in the bath tub and the cooked rabbit in Fatal Attraction. Also on here are parodies of Sleeping With The Enemy starring Julia Roberts and Patrick Bergin, a 1991 thriller about a husband who is obscessed with his own wife and who likes to have his own things in the house arranged his way. This movie is really great comedy and really will take you to the 90's. The 90's is long gone and many were too little to remember everything in detail. But it was a time in which movies were full of thrillers. I wish they had made a spoof of ""The Hand That Rocks The Cradle"" on this film too. It was a time of laughing at criminals and their schocking crimes. Remember the Melendez Brothers ? Remember Lorena Bobbit ? And let's not forget the secret plotting of Tonya Harding against Nancy Carrigan. All this happened in the 90's. This was the time of the O.J. Simpson trial after all. I really recommend this movie. Many can easily dismiss it as cheap comedy but there are some genuinely comic moments, such as Armand Assante and Sean Young's lovemaking scene, the final part of the movie is funny too. A must have for fans of comedies of the 90's.",1087516800,2,1985,4.501385041551247
534258,4,6303011969,"Yes,this film is a combination of BASIC INSTINCT and FATAL ATTRACTION. Michael Douglas who starred in both those films should have starred in this one. I believe he would have been naturally perfect for Armand Assante's starring role. This is a spoof like the three Naked Gun movies and National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1. One of the characters in this film is Max Shady,which is a spoof of Max Cady,a character in CAPE FEAR played by the late Robert Mitchum in the original and Robert DeNiro in the remake. There are cameos by Whoopi Goldberg and Rosie O'Donnell. This film was dircted by Carl Reiner,the comic actor famous for The Dick Van Dyke Show. Reiner directed quite a few films like his son Rob. The elder Reiner directed films long before his son.",1084233600,,757,4.6992481203007515
534259,4,6303011969,"I first caught this movie on cable a few years ago and laughed so much my side started hurting!  After that, I would watch it whenever I caught it on, sometimes missing half the movie but enjoying it just the same.  If you like ""Body Heat"" ""Fatal Attraction"" and other movies of that ilk (which I do) you don't want to miss this spoof.  It's all of those movies, rolled into one; the actors play it straight, which is more funny than if they had winked at the camera in each scene.  The drama keeps rising with every scene, until it gets so ridiculous TWO people have to die in the end, simultaneously, and by the same hand.",1057881600,2,624,4.262711864406779
534260,4,6303011969,"I loved this movie. It was hilarious.  It is a spoof tha twas a response to the rash of, I don't how else to put it, ""troubled marriage"" movies that came out around this time.  It makes fun of Fatal Attraction as well as Sleeping with the Enemy.  Absolutly hilarious. HOWEVER, is only comes in STANDARD.  I do not understand why a wide screen version is not available.  The direector originally intended the movie to be widescreen. Keep it that way. If you must have  one side of the DVD Standard and the other side widescreen.  Grrr....",1051747200,17,537,4.474226804123711
534261,4,6303011969,"This movie was slammed by critics.  The most common review of this said that there was 'just too many jokes' in it.  I watched it with a critical eye, and thought it was a really fun movie.
I didn't laugh out loud with tears running down my face, but did spend the entire run time giggling at the antics of all the characters.  The cast consists of several Serious Actors (Kate Nelligan, Armand Assante) who play their parts as though they were in a drama.  To me, those are excellent comedic acting skills.  It's when actors play for laughs that they are not funny.
You might not be tickled by this one if you aren't familiar with the 'film noir' and detective film genre.  If you are a fan of those, you will laugh as you recognize all the devices in those films over-used to good effect in this one.
I had a good time watching it...give it a try!",1006560000,7,849,4.275

7834209,1,6303011969,I'm shocked that so many people gave this 5 starts.  The story was slow and the direction and acting were both not very good.  I think the story could have been OK had I had the will to see this movie to the end.  I would not suggest this movie.  But than again what do you expect being a Prime movie.  Most of the good movies r not on Prime....Why do I continue to pay for this????  must be the 2 day shipping that arrives 4 days later,1516752000,,436,3.897727272727273

7834215,5,6303011969,"Finally a movie that has a good plot that follows through to the end. Many films starting with ""Airplane"" became over the top parodies. Yet most of them were vehicles for one-liners. This Movie actually has a structure and ability for running gags. We learn many legal concepts like triple indemnity, and visuals on how to buff buns. You barley have time to catch your breath. At other moments you know what is has to happen and at the last minute find that you are being set up from the beginning.

All the actors fit the characters they play. I have to say I have always been fascinated by Sean Young so it took a little time to see her as Lola Cain. Her relation ship to the other characters helps you understand motive and her risqu messing around taught me many new terms.
Laura Lincolnberry (Sherilyn Fenn) plays an exaggerated perfect secretary with a past, adding to the layer of complexity and her encounter with Lola Cain has to be seen.",1502668800,,947,4.505813953488372
7834216,3,6303011969,"The DVD version is MUCH better.  For some reason, the Blu-Ray version has different music.  For instance, the DVD version has ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"" by Iron Butterfly playing when the actors are in a bath tub, AND, they are talking about the song.  The Blu-Ray version has a REALLY lame song playing, and they are still talking about ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.""  The scene where Sherrilyn is trying on hats is another example.  Get the DVD version.",1502582400,,440,5.055555555555555
