It's the second point that's the problem. This was an All Regions (All Code) DVD when I ordered it from Ez-Shop Online, which should play on my computer because other All Regions DVDs play just fine for me. With Tiramisu, however, I got about 2/3 of the way through the movie and the DVD locked up my DVD-viewing program which, in turn, locked up the rest of my computer. I couldn't even remove the DVD until I hard-booted!
This page says that the version for sale is Region 1. I would be VERY CAREFUL when ordering from the only seller listed for a new copy at this time (02 October 2016) because they are in Thailand (and the used ones are in Thailand and Britain). It would be wise to contact them and confirm that their DVD is, in fact, Region 1. I suspect it is not.",1475366400,,860,4.186746987951807

8068351,4,B0009WIEHA,"I was hunting for every Nicholas Tse movie I could find.  This is not one of his best, but it's good, quaint, romantic, etc.  Unlike the other reviewer, I got English subtitles. I might have had to futz with my machine in order to find them, however.  It's been a while since I've watched it.  I just couldn't let this charming movie go with just one review.

Nick's character is a postal carrier who is deaf.  In one day he runs into the same young woman several times.  It turns out that they are thinking of each other when she is hit by a bus and dies.  She as a ghost then calls him on his cell phone and asks him a favor - could she become him (take over his body) in order to finish what she started.  Of course they fall in love.  And of course, there are complications.  He doesn't sing (which he does very well), but he does dance and not badly.",1249516800,3,855,4.090361445783133
8068352,4,B0009WIEHA,"THERE IS NO ENGLISH ON THIS DVD.
If you go into the audio set up it lists English as an option, but selecting it is a waste of time.

Once you realize that you can only watch this masterpiece, you'll see that language is not a barrier for love or life. The story is compasionate and meaningful, and above all; simple. They could be speaking chinese, sort of speak, and you'll still get the message. Its funny, its sad, and it has a great ending.

For $15 , its worth a stab in the dark.",1191024000,5,486,4.105263157894737
