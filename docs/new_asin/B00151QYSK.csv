3136882,5,B00151QYSK,"Throughout the film I found myself glued to the screen watching this film unfold until its dramatic close.  I wish Samuel chose his roles more carefully but he has been on a roll so far and this performance doesn't let you down.  And the casting is truly solid and the performances are very thorough.  The writing really shines and just flows like a rich and robust champagne.  It was brilliant how they fed you the clues but it was obvious.  The movie has scenes were he just scoops out blood, brain matter, bacteria...ugh.  Looked very real.  This is a thrilling film that is very well written.  So if you are in the mood to see a real thriller and be entertained this movie is a must see.",1213660800,,691,4.3858267716535435
3136883,3,B00151QYSK,"CLEANER is somewhat of an enigmatic movie: it starts out as though it is going to be a sassy comedy about a retired cop whose job it is to 'clean up' after homicides (a distinctly messy and repulsive job), turns into a rather grisly crime investigation story, adds a dollop of 'ain't life grand', and finishes as an expos&eacute;  of police corruption. The story line by Matthew Aldrich is further fragmented by being so full of holes that the audience has to toss credibility overboard in order to make it through, and the method of direction by Renny Harlin can't seem to settle on which style to take.  It is all kind of a mess and justifies the straight to DVD move. The saving grace of the film is a cast of stalwart actors who can make even a shaky script palatable.

Tom Cutler (Samuel L. Jackson) is a 'retired' cop who makes his living cleaning up the gory remainders of criminal acts of homicide and other grisly crimes.  We learn his wife was murdered some years ago, leaving him as a single father of the bright and charming teenager Rose (Keke Palmer). Cutler happens on an assignment to clean a particularly gruesome homicide scene in the home of one Ann Northcut (Eva Mendes in a nicely understated role) and as the convoluted story develops, Cutler realizes that the crime scene represents a culmination of forces that threaten to uncork a long history of police corruption - a history that involves him and his best friend Eddie Lorenzo (Ed Harris) and the tough Detective Jim Vargas (a terrific  Luis Guzm&aacute;n).  How the story ties together and ends is too loose to convey and would ruin the minimal drama present.

Each of the actors, even the minor roles played very well by such artists as Jose Pablo Cantillo and Robert Forster, give it the full court press.  But the see-through script and the jumbled camera work and direction prevent this from being a significant film. Grady Harp, June 08",1212883200,10,1919,4.65680473372781
3136884,3,B00151QYSK,"Director Renny Harlin has not scored a single hit since 1999 Deep Blue Sea. Lately all he can get is straight to video material. I think he annoyed one of Hollywood top man and you don't want to do that in this business unless of course you are Steven Spielberg kind of material.

This movie is no exception but it does have decent casts: Sam Jackson, Ed Harris, and the main reason for me to buy this DVD: EVA MENDES. The story itself is not bad, Sam Jackson is the cleaner who cleans crime scene. One day he was set up to clean a crime scene under fake order. And he becomes the no 1 suspect. There is some plot twists here and there but frankly most audience will see it coming so not much surprise there. Eva Mendes acting is getting better but she clouds my judgment anyway so don't take my words for it.

The DVD is decent, the picture quality is sharp. The 5.1 sound is OK (not much action anyway). Extra wise is the commentary by Renny Harlin which I only listened half way through.

If you are a fan of Eva Mendes than this is a no brainer as she shines in every single scene she is in. If you are not her fan probably this is just a rental as this movie is just an average thriller.",1212883200,,1192,4.1072961373390555
3136885,4,B00151QYSK,One of the more interesting movies I've seen lately. It is cross between a suspense/drama movie & thriller movie with a solid storyline and nice twist and turns throughout this movie. One is left guessing until the very end of this movie who the killer's identity is in this movie... I highly recommend watching this movie.,1212796800,,323,4.785714285714286
3136886,3,B00151QYSK,"Jackson is a former cop who apparently resigned from the force for reasons related to the general standard of morality there (I lost my stomach for it, he says), and started a business that cleans up the most unspeakable mess, often crime scenes, but also pet infestations and other stuff. The movie starts badly, like a black comedy that is not funny.
Then it turns into an interesting story. We learn that Jackson's character is a widower with a teenage daughter. The wife got killed by a burgler and then the burgler got killed by somebody while in prison. His best pal in the force was Ed Harris, who was somehow involved in everything. Jackson doesn't handle his single parenthood too well.
One day he gets a job order, seemingly from the police, to clean up a murder scene. He does, and then finds out he was trapped: he has helped hide an actual murder case and now is on the police's suspect list.
Mendes is the not-yet-confirmed widow. We think the police are the bad guys, with a big case of an IA investigation causing panic all over.
I will not tell here what happens next, though it is so unlikely that it makes me withdraw a star for incredibility.
I drop one more star because the centre of the plot doesn't hold water. If one could accept the trap in a technical sense, it would be a good idea, but with some CSI training one spots the holes in the trap with eyes wide shut.",1212364800,12,1390,4.412451361867705

When he is called to sterilize a wealthy suburban residence after a brutal shooting, carver realizes he is in the weak string because unknowingly he has erased crucial evidence that eventually may incriminate him entangling himself in a dirty criminal cover up.

Of course, there are other actors and actresses involved in this very serious type of film.

For instance, my husband has read a significant amount of science fiction stories and he accurately made a guess early in the film who he thought was responsible for the cover-up.

3137064,4,B00151QYSK,"Cleaner was a great film that would have gotten a much higher rating, if not for predictability. There are certain actors, when you see their names in the credits, you know, even before the film starts, that they are the bad guy, and that's exactly what happened here. Samuel L. Jackson stars as a former police officer, who was part of a dirty department. He knew that it would only be a matter of time before he was caught up in the corruption, so he decides to get out. Jackson decides to take on the unique, but very real profession of being a crime scene cleaner. One day, he's given a key and a job to do in an upscale neighborhood. Nothing is out of the ordinary, until the next day when he goes to get paid and discovers that the woman there has no idea what he's talking about. Now Jackson must discover who used him to cover up their crime, who was the victim, and why were they murdered? While I prefer Samuel L. Jackson in a more comedic role, he's just as good in a dramatic one. His strength has always been the ability to carry a film, no matter if it's dramatic or ridiculous. Despite being direct-to-video, Cleaner has a large supporting cast of stars that really help the film. A lot of these films tend to have newcomers backing the veteran star, and their weak performances bring down the quality of even the best written films. Here, Jackson is supported by the likes of Eva Mendes, Luis Guzman, and Ed Harris, all of whom are very believable, and all of whom help move the story along. Cleaner is intense, unique, and interesting, if you haven't seen a lot of film, you may not realize who the bad guy is, five minutes into the film, and you may be really surprised.

3137165,3,B00151QYSK,"<strong>Cleaner</strong> (Renny Harlin, 2007)

The fact that Renny Harlin has made some of the worst movies in recent memory (<em>Exorcist: The Beginning</em>, <em>Cliffhanger</em>, <em>Deep Blue Sea</em>, and <em>A Nightmare on Elm St. 4</em> were all Harlin projects) tends to obscure the fact that sometimes he puts out a serviceable, if forgettable, thriller. <em>Cleaner</em> is one of those, and if it's muddled, overly complex, and kind of silly, at least it's not <em>The Adventures of Ford Fairlane</em>. Yes, Harlin was responsible for that, as well.

Tom Cutler (Samuel L. Jackson) is a police detective who got out of the life and started a crime-scene cleanup business. Everything is going along just fine. Well, okay, ""fine"" is not the word. His employees are having problems dealing with the messes they're being asked to clean up, he's a single parent with a rebellious teenager, and his hot secretary hits him with two jobs that need done while he's the only guy in the office: an old woman with forty-five cats who died of natural causes and a run-of-the-mill homicide. He takes the latter. (That the former is never mentioned again is the movie's single biggest failing.) Everything goes as scheduled until the next day, when he realizes he's forgotten to leave the keys, so he goes back to the house to return them... and Ann Norcut (Eva Mendes), the homeowner, knows nothing about a cleaning company being retained to sanitize a crime scene. Cue web of deceit.

The biggest draw here is that you've got four actors with proven track records (along with Jackson and Mendes are Ed Harris as Tom's ex-partner and Luis Guzm&aacute;n as a detective investigating departmental corruption), and all four of them deliver good performances. A number of other solid actors turn up in smaller roles; the Robert Forster cameo is worth the price of admission by itself.

Balancing that out is, well, Harlin's direction, which is about as lackluster as it usually is when he's not in stuff-blows-up mode, and Matthew Aldrich's script, which doesn't do quite enough in the way of jacking up the suspense or hiding the predictability. It's got some really nice touches (the movie's opening scene is fantastic; if Aldrich and Harlin had been able to keep up that level of humor/gore mix, they'd have had a hit on their hands), but the longer we go, the more the movie fails at keeping the viewer guessing, despite the actors doing the best they can with the material given.

Short answer: Harlin's best movie since <em>Die Hard 2</em> seventeen years previous... but not as good as <em>Die Hard 2</em>, which wasn't great in the first place. ** ",1325116800,,2649,4.981900452488688
3137166,3,B00151QYSK,"Reviews are like the cleaner of the title in that they try and clean up the ""mess"" that a movie has made with audiences and, in some respects, present it in a nice, tidy presentation that is supposed to help audiences decide if they should see the movie.

Samuel L. Jackson plays former police officer Tom Cutler who now runs a crime scene cleaning business. He cleans up other people's worst possible messes and makes the recent past disappear at least on the surface but, like the death of his wife and his ""forced"" retirement from the police force, there are some things that surface cleaning can never make go away. When Cutler is called out to clean up a crime scene that has never been reported and the person who lives there is reported as a missing person by his wife (Eve Mendes), Jackson suspects he's being set up. He saves the photos and work order and approaches his old, estranged partner (Ed Harris) to help him find out if this is related to a police corruption probe that Cutler has ties to. Cutler must figure out a way to clean up this mess without endangering his daughter (the marvelous Keke Palmer).

With a spectacular cast, great premise strong execution (except for the last act and some predictable plot twists)""Cleaner"" is a worthwhile movie to watch. Is it a great movie? No but it strives for it and even if it can't quite reach its goal, the actors and the unusually restrained direction of Renny Harlan still go for the gold even if they are hobbled by a script that becomes predictable.

The script by novice writer Matthew Aldrich does quite a bit right but misses a chance to clean things up and leaves some threads dangling as it becomes a more conventional thriller by the end.

Samuel L. Jackson carries the film with a brilliant, strong performance and is ably assisted by Ed Harris. The other actors do a good job with characters that are sketched out when they could be more fully drawn and give them more material to work with.

The DVD looks quite nice--it's not what I would refer to as a reference quality DVD but the colors do pop and detail is quite nice throughout. Like the film itself it's a good transfer that aspires to greatness but doesn't achieve it.

The special features include deleted scenes. Why some of these scenes were deleted is beyond me; they add to the complexity of the characters and would have helped nudge this film from good to very good. Director Harlan (""Die Hard 2"", ""Exorcist: The Beginning"" and ""Deep Blue Sea"") provides an engaging and honest assessment of the directorial choices he made for the film although it's just shy of being critical of why the film didn't turn out better.

While ""Cleaner"" doesn't live up to it's potential and squanders a promising premise, it's still a worthwhile movie and Harlan eschews his characteristic over-the-top action scenes in favor more quieter character moments.

Clean is worth a rental if nothing else I just wish it was the movie it WISHED to be.",1324339200,,2968,4.629277566539924
3137167,3,B00151QYSK,"This film is somewhat different than the run of the mill police crime stories. It introduces viewers to an unusual profession. Its principal character is a retired cop who is compulsive about cleanliness and order. He starts a company to clean and sanitize houses where people died, including houses overrun with blood, where there has been a murder. He left the police department because he disliked the corruption that was taking place in it, a corruption in which he was apparently involved in a minor way. His wife was murdered just before his retirement and he sought revenge against the murderer. His daughter was profoundly affected by the murder and he tries to help her cope.

His office receives a call to clean a house where he is told a murder was committed, and he cleans the house.

3137228,2,B00151QYSK,"Certainly ""Cleaner"" looks interesting on paper; A-list actors including Samuel L. Jackson and Ed Harris and the film's story involves a job ""crime scene cleaner."" But if you are looking for something original, this is not the place. Renny Harlin's follow-up to critically-panned ""The Covenant"" is a lackluster crime thriller with a weak storyline, but at least there is one interesting thing it has.

Samuel L. Jackson plays Tom Cutler, a former police detective who runs a small cleaning company specializing in cleaning the crime scenes. After cleaning up the bloodstained room of an expensive home (alone, a dead body apparently removed), he realizes that no one, including the police and Ann (Eva Mendes) the wife living in the mansion, ever heard of the ""crime scene"" for which Tom was hired.

You know there are stories of ""murder without a body""; the premise of ""Cleaner"" is more elaborated and ambitious, but after the mildly interesting introduction the film just goes downhill, having nothing original to offer. Besides its uninteresting story, some of the supporting characters are poorly-written, especially Eva Mendes's terribly bland Ann, who should be much more mysterious.

Back in 90s, Renny Harlin is mostly known for his Hollywood-made over-the-top action films like ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" (with Samuel L. Jackson), ""Cliffhanger,"" and ""Die Hard 2."" But I believe he really wants to be known for something else. In ""Cleaner"" he spends considerable time depicting the relations between Tom Cutler and his daughter Rose (Keke Palmer) who wants to know more about her dead mother in spite of her father's obvious unwillingness.

Also, our hero's everyday habits such as his almost ritualistic way of working are repeatedly shown. There are snappy editing and smart camerawork (showing the careful way he locks the door every night, for instance) that suggests his desires to get away from the world outside and protect his beloved daughter. The script also tries not to make Cutler's character too good or heroic, which I think is a good thing.

Despite all these efforts, however, the clich-ridden story is too weak to hold our attention. ""Cleaner"" doesn't offer much beyond the familiar crime-thriller elements with a convoluted story and incredible climax where mystery, if any, will evaporate quickly, not in the most intriguing way. By the time you reach there, I think you will have lost your interest, not even in the profession of crime scene cleaner itself, which deserves a better treatment.",1237680000,,2519,5.179361179361179

3137232,4,B00151QYSK,"Tom Cutler (Samuel L. Jackson) is a ""retired"" cop - and sufferer of extreme OCD - who opens a morbid business cleaning up the remains of grisly murders and deaths.  He starts out in a class reunion where he informs his former classmates that he didn't have the stomach for police work, but also goes into gory details of sweeping ears and mopping up various forms of human juice.

When tasked with yet another job from the local police department, he goes about his monotonous, yet disturbing profession.  Like many similar cases, he's cleaning up a post-crime police scene.  He walks through police tape, observes broken seals on doorways, implicates OJ Simpson, and sees the bloody handprints of evidence.  Something about the most recent job, however, seems a bit odd.

Returning a key he forgot a day later, he meets Ann Northcut (Eva Mendes) and a house full of kids at a surprise birthday party.  Confused about the mix-up, and the fact that he just cleaned up at least a gallon of blood (the death of Mr. Northcut) at the same location the day before, he soon realizes he may have inadvertently tampered with an active crime scene...or a really awesome childrens' party.  The situation is something he'd normally divulge immediately, but the local police are going through internal affairs corruption, and he doesn't trust anyone.

What follows is a convoluted series of events between Cutler, Northcut, Det. Jim Vargas (Luis Guzmn), his ex-partner Eddie Lorenzo (Ed Harris), and OJ Simpson.  Anyway, Cutler attempts to determine who authorized the job, who is implicated in the murder and cover-up, and why his character doesn't get to scream ""mother f#*ker"" at least three times during the movie.

All the major players are good in their roles.  Jackson is stoic and believable, and Guzmn is as good as ever.

The novelty of the film which is never fully capitalized is its CSI turned inside out treatment.  Where CSI's characters just nail their cases - this world is filled with morally ambiguous people that are troubled by their decisions.

As the film unfolded, I was surprised to learn that it was helmed by Renny Harlin (admittedly not one of my favourite directors)  who, unlike his Die Hard days, exercises some artistic restraint in his treatment.  The cinematography and crisp images captivate you as you almost recall Angel Heart and Mickey Rourke losing his mind - but then the film descends into a beat-by-beat whodunit rather than a psychological thriller.  Instead of feeling in danger as we should, we become less intrigued as Renny connects the dots.

Cleaner starts magnificently but like so many Hollywood films, never escalates the potential and emotions of the characters or the plot.  There's a layer missing here, making Cleaner one of those could-have-beens.  Samuel Jackson remains peerless and the real reason to watch this.

3137277,4,B00151QYSK,"The Cleaner, like some other Samuel Jackson movies, comes packed with his powerful depiction, this time of an ex-police office (seems like picking up where the ""The Negotiator"" left off).

The premise is really nice, though not surprising. The moment I found out what job Jackson does, it was easy to guess how the plot could go. There are some dead give-aways, but then you probably already know that. In which case, you might also know that the movie does have some really enjoyable plot twists, and tight screenplay. The plot is simple (I could guess the whodunit aspect quite early in the movie - though not the motive!), but the performance of two great actors - Jackson and Harris make the movie a treat to watch.

I especially liked the background score of the movie, as IMO, it accentuated the mood of some of the shots depicting the Cleaner at work, as well as when he realizes he has a lot at stake to risk loosing it all.

What's missing (?), you might ask. Well, for starters, a plot that in addition to being so taught and well scripted, an actual original idea for a murder mystery would have been nice. Secondly, I concede that Jackson is capable of a lot more than what the movie has extracted out of him as an actor. He has done a wonderful job, but there are spots in the storyline where one could have imagined his character behave differently. I like him not just for his acting but also his dialogue (delivery), and I was left wanting more in that department. But then, that's just my opinion.

Did she or didn't she know of the murder at the time it occurred?  Was she truly surprised when Carver showed up at her house?  Was she ""playing"" him right along with the murderer?  She seemed so innocent, even at the end that we were left a bit mystified.

Tom is a widowed, single dad to a teenage daughter Rose [Keke Palmer] who is intelligent and spirited. Tom finds it harder each day to deal with his daughter's questions regarding her deceased mom and the circumstances surrounding her death. His job as a 'cleaner of crime scenes' seems to go along well until a fateful day when he gets called in to clean-up a homicide scene and finds that he was set-up - the crime he cleans up after was never reported to the police, and he in fact inadvertently acted as an accessory to cover it up. Soon, Tom finds himself the prime suspect in the case- and there are a bunch of crooked cops after him.

He turns in desperation to his ex-partner, Eddie Lorenzo [Ed Harris in a wasted role] who seems helpful enough yet resentful of Tom's cutting him out of Tom's and Rose's [Eddie is Rose's godfather] lives. Then there is Mrs Norcut [Eva Mendes in a subtle yet effective performance] whose house was the one Tom 'cleaned' and whose husband is missing. Is Mr Norcut the victim of foul play and if so, who is the party responsible? Things get messy and confusing and Tom finds himself being besieged by all sides, whilst he tries to figure everything out.

The movie certainly has an interesting idea yet suffers from poor execution.

Ed Harris offers a lacklustre performance here - and his role is wasted. Also, the movie suffers from an incredulous plotline halfway through, and we can see some of the twists from miles away.

The story line by Matthew Aldrich is further fragmented by being so full of holes that the audience has to toss credibility overboard in order to make it through, and the method of direction by Renny Harlin can't seem to settle on which style to take.  It is all kind of a mess and justifies the straight to DVD move. The saving grace of the film is a cast of stalwart actors who can make even a shaky script palatable.

Tom Cutler (Samuel L. Jackson) is a 'retired' cop who makes his living cleaning up the gory remainders of criminal acts of homicide and other grisly crimes.  We learn his wife was murdered some years ago, leaving him as a single father of the bright and charming teenager Rose (Keke Palmer). Cutler happens on an assignment to clean a particularly gruesome homicide scene in the home of one Ann Northcut (Eva Mendes in a nicely understated role) and as the convoluted story develops, Cutler realizes that the crime scene represents a culmination of forces that threaten to uncork a long history of police corruption - a history that involves him and his best friend Eddie Lorenzo (Ed Harris) and the tough Detective Jim Vargas (a terrific  Luis Guzm&aacute;n).  How the story ties together and ends is too loose to convey and would ruin the minimal drama present.

Each of the actors, even the minor roles played very well by such artists as Jose Pablo Cantillo and Robert Forster, give it the full court press.  But the see-through script and the jumbled camera work and direction prevent this from being a significant film. Grady Harp, June 08",1212883200,10,1919,4.65680473372781

This movie is no exception but it does have decent casts: Sam Jackson, Ed Harris, and the main reason for me to buy this DVD: EVA MENDES. The story itself is not bad, Sam Jackson is the cleaner who cleans crime scene. One day he was set up to clean a crime scene under fake order. And he becomes the no 1 suspect.

Then it turns into an interesting story. We learn that Jackson's character is a widower with a teenage daughter.

3371561,4,B00151QYSK,"Cleaner was a great film that would have gotten a much higher rating, if not for predictability. There are certain actors, when you see their names in the credits, you know, even before the film starts, that they are the bad guy, and that's exactly what happened here. Samuel L. Jackson stars as a former police officer, who was part of a dirty department. He knew that it would only be a matter of time before he was caught up in the corruption, so he decides to get out. Jackson decides to take on the unique, but very real profession of being a crime scene cleaner. One day, he's given a key and a job to do in an upscale neighborhood. Nothing is out of the ordinary, until the next day when he goes to get paid and discovers that the woman there has no idea what he's talking about. Now Jackson must discover who used him to cover up their crime, who was the victim, and why were they murdered? While I prefer Samuel L. Jackson in a more comedic role, he's just as good in a dramatic one. His strength has always been the ability to carry a film, no matter if it's dramatic or ridiculous. Despite being direct-to-video, Cleaner has a large supporting cast of stars that really help the film. A lot of these films tend to have newcomers backing the veteran star, and their weak performances bring down the quality of even the best written films. Here, Jackson is supported by the likes of Eva Mendes, Luis Guzman, and Ed Harris, all of whom are very believable, and all of whom help move the story along. Cleaner is intense, unique, and interesting, if you haven't seen a lot of film, you may not realize who the bad guy is, five minutes into the film, and you may be really surprised.

3371662,3,B00151QYSK,"<strong>Cleaner</strong> (Renny Harlin, 2007)

The fact that Renny Harlin has made some of the worst movies in recent memory (<em>Exorcist: The Beginning</em>, <em>Cliffhanger</em>, <em>Deep Blue Sea</em>, and <em>A Nightmare on Elm St. 4</em> were all Harlin projects) tends to obscure the fact that sometimes he puts out a serviceable, if forgettable, thriller. <em>Cleaner</em> is one of those, and if it's muddled, overly complex, and kind of silly, at least it's not <em>The Adventures of Ford Fairlane</em>. Yes, Harlin was responsible for that, as well.

Tom Cutler (Samuel L. Jackson) is a police detective who got out of the life and started a crime-scene cleanup business. Everything is going along just fine. Well, okay, ""fine"" is not the word. His employees are having problems dealing with the messes they're being asked to clean up, he's a single parent with a rebellious teenager, and his hot secretary hits him with two jobs that need done while he's the only guy in the office: an old woman with forty-five cats who died of natural causes and a run-of-the-mill homicide. He takes the latter. (That the former is never mentioned again is the movie's single biggest failing.) Everything goes as scheduled until the next day, when he realizes he's forgotten to leave the keys, so he goes back to the house to return them... and Ann Norcut (Eva Mendes), the homeowner, knows nothing about a cleaning company being retained to sanitize a crime scene. Cue web of deceit.

The biggest draw here is that you've got four actors with proven track records (along with Jackson and Mendes are Ed Harris as Tom's ex-partner and Luis Guzm&aacute;n as a detective investigating departmental corruption), and all four of them deliver good performances. A number of other solid actors turn up in smaller roles; the Robert Forster cameo is worth the price of admission by itself.

Balancing that out is, well, Harlin's direction, which is about as lackluster as it usually is when he's not in stuff-blows-up mode, and Matthew Aldrich's script, which doesn't do quite enough in the way of jacking up the suspense or hiding the predictability. It's got some really nice touches (the movie's opening scene is fantastic; if Aldrich and Harlin had been able to keep up that level of humor/gore mix, they'd have had a hit on their hands), but the longer we go, the more the movie fails at keeping the viewer guessing, despite the actors doing the best they can with the material given.

Short answer: Harlin's best movie since <em>Die Hard 2</em> seventeen years previous... but not as good as <em>Die Hard 2</em>, which wasn't great in the first place. ** ",1325116800,,2649,4.981900452488688
3371663,3,B00151QYSK,"Reviews are like the cleaner of the title in that they try and clean up the ""mess"" that a movie has made with audiences and, in some respects, present it in a nice, tidy presentation that is supposed to help audiences decide if they should see the movie.

Samuel L. Jackson plays former police officer Tom Cutler who now runs a crime scene cleaning business. He cleans up other people's worst possible messes and makes the recent past disappear at least on the surface but, like the death of his wife and his ""forced"" retirement from the police force, there are some things that surface cleaning can never make go away. When Cutler is called out to clean up a crime scene that has never been reported and the person who lives there is reported as a missing person by his wife (Eve Mendes), Jackson suspects he's being set up. He saves the photos and work order and approaches his old, estranged partner (Ed Harris) to help him find out if this is related to a police corruption probe that Cutler has ties to. Cutler must figure out a way to clean up this mess without endangering his daughter (the marvelous Keke Palmer).

With a spectacular cast, great premise strong execution (except for the last act and some predictable plot twists)""Cleaner"" is a worthwhile movie to watch. Is it a great movie? No but it strives for it and even if it can't quite reach its goal, the actors and the unusually restrained direction of Renny Harlan still go for the gold even if they are hobbled by a script that becomes predictable.

The script by novice writer Matthew Aldrich does quite a bit right but misses a chance to clean things up and leaves some threads dangling as it becomes a more conventional thriller by the end.

Samuel L. Jackson carries the film with a brilliant, strong performance and is ably assisted by Ed Harris. The other actors do a good job with characters that are sketched out when they could be more fully drawn and give them more material to work with.

The DVD looks quite nice--it's not what I would refer to as a reference quality DVD but the colors do pop and detail is quite nice throughout. Like the film itself it's a good transfer that aspires to greatness but doesn't achieve it.

The special features include deleted scenes. Why some of these scenes were deleted is beyond me; they add to the complexity of the characters and would have helped nudge this film from good to very good. Director Harlan (""Die Hard 2"", ""Exorcist: The Beginning"" and ""Deep Blue Sea"") provides an engaging and honest assessment of the directorial choices he made for the film although it's just shy of being critical of why the film didn't turn out better.

While ""Cleaner"" doesn't live up to it's potential and squanders a promising premise, it's still a worthwhile movie and Harlan eschews his characteristic over-the-top action scenes in favor more quieter character moments.

3371664,3,B00151QYSK,"This film is somewhat different than the run of the mill police crime stories. It introduces viewers to an unusual profession. Its principal character is a retired cop who is compulsive about cleanliness and order. He starts a company to clean and sanitize houses where people died, including houses overrun with blood, where there has been a murder. He left the police department because he disliked the corruption that was taking place in it, a corruption in which he was apparently involved in a minor way. His wife was murdered just before his retirement and he sought revenge against the murderer. His daughter was profoundly affected by the murder and he tries to help her cope.

His office receives a call to clean a house where he is told a murder was committed, and he cleans the house. But he discovers that the police officer who ostensibly made the telephone call hiring him does not exist and the police know nothing about a murder of the man, in the house or anywhere. They only know that the man is missing. It seems that he, the ex cop, was hired to hide a murder. The movie explores who hired him, why the man was murdered, who did the murder, was he set up to be tried for the murder, is corruption in the police department behind the murder, and who can he trust.",1323302400,,1282,4.525862068965517

3371725,2,B00151QYSK,"Certainly ""Cleaner"" looks interesting on paper; A-list actors including Samuel L. Jackson and Ed Harris and the film's story involves a job ""crime scene cleaner."" But if you are looking for something original, this is not the place. Renny Harlin's follow-up to critically-panned ""The Covenant"" is a lackluster crime thriller with a weak storyline, but at least there is one interesting thing it has.

Samuel L. Jackson plays Tom Cutler, a former police detective who runs a small cleaning company specializing in cleaning the crime scenes. After cleaning up the bloodstained room of an expensive home (alone, a dead body apparently removed), he realizes that no one, including the police and Ann (Eva Mendes) the wife living in the mansion, ever heard of the ""crime scene"" for which Tom was hired.

You know there are stories of ""murder without a body""; the premise of ""Cleaner"" is more elaborated and ambitious, but after the mildly interesting introduction the film just goes downhill, having nothing original to offer. Besides its uninteresting story, some of the supporting characters are poorly-written, especially Eva Mendes's terribly bland Ann, who should be much more mysterious.

Back in 90s, Renny Harlin is mostly known for his Hollywood-made over-the-top action films like ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" (with Samuel L. Jackson), ""Cliffhanger,"" and ""Die Hard 2."" But I believe he really wants to be known for something else. In ""Cleaner"" he spends considerable time depicting the relations between Tom Cutler and his daughter Rose (Keke Palmer) who wants to know more about her dead mother in spite of her father's obvious unwillingness.

Also, our hero's everyday habits such as his almost ritualistic way of working are repeatedly shown. There are snappy editing and smart camerawork (showing the careful way he locks the door every night, for instance) that suggests his desires to get away from the world outside and protect his beloved daughter. The script also tries not to make Cutler's character too good or heroic, which I think is a good thing.

Despite all these efforts, however, the clich-ridden story is too weak to hold our attention. ""Cleaner"" doesn't offer much beyond the familiar crime-thriller elements with a convoluted story and incredible climax where mystery, if any, will evaporate quickly, not in the most intriguing way. By the time you reach there, I think you will have lost your interest, not even in the profession of crime scene cleaner itself, which deserves a better treatment.",1237680000,,2519,5.179361179361179

3371729,4,B00151QYSK,"Tom Cutler (Samuel L. Jackson) is a ""retired"" cop - and sufferer of extreme OCD - who opens a morbid business cleaning up the remains of grisly murders and deaths.  He starts out in a class reunion where he informs his former classmates that he didn't have the stomach for police work, but also goes into gory details of sweeping ears and mopping up various forms of human juice.

When tasked with yet another job from the local police department, he goes about his monotonous, yet disturbing profession.  Like many similar cases, he's cleaning up a post-crime police scene.  He walks through police tape, observes broken seals on doorways, implicates OJ Simpson, and sees the bloody handprints of evidence.  Something about the most recent job, however, seems a bit odd.

Returning a key he forgot a day later, he meets Ann Northcut (Eva Mendes) and a house full of kids at a surprise birthday party.  Confused about the mix-up, and the fact that he just cleaned up at least a gallon of blood (the death of Mr. Northcut) at the same location the day before, he soon realizes he may have inadvertently tampered with an active crime scene...or a really awesome childrens' party.  The situation is something he'd normally divulge immediately, but the local police are going through internal affairs corruption, and he doesn't trust anyone.

What follows is a convoluted series of events between Cutler, Northcut, Det. Jim Vargas (Luis Guzmn), his ex-partner Eddie Lorenzo (Ed Harris), and OJ Simpson.  Anyway, Cutler attempts to determine who authorized the job, who is implicated in the murder and cover-up, and why his character doesn't get to scream ""mother f#*ker"" at least three times during the movie.

All the major players are good in their roles.  Jackson is stoic and believable, and Guzmn is as good as ever.

If this movie isn't a book I feel the need to announce it'd make for a much better book than film. Genuinly haunted from his past, the future brings many painful flash backs. Pressured and not sure where to turn, the movie easily picks up (but not cohesively).

So many opportunities for intrigue and tension were circumvented for no apparent reason. All the problems faced by the characters were solved way too easily. What a bore! What's the point?",1221436800,,388,4.893939393939394
3371770,5,B00151QYSK,"Great actors and acting, excellent direction, fascinating cinematography, haunting sound track, and an engrossing plot make me wonder why this film went straight to dvd and didn't open in theaters. Characters you can really care about, involved in thought-provoking, moving situations, make this film emotionally touching in addition to all the suspense. Gorgeous cinematography, with scenes shot in a stark way, from unusual angles, added to the tension. The main character's occupation is one you would never think about, but once he explains it, it seems obvious that someone would have to clean up murder scenes. The job even seems mundane, until one leads him into a complicated cover-up with surprising twists and danger at every turn. I took a chance buying this film, because I usually don't like thrillers, and I enjoyed it much more than I had thought I would because of its psychological and emotional depth in addition to the plot that just grabs you.",1219968000,,963,5.10126582278481

3371773,3,B00151QYSK,"The Cleaner looked intriguing - this film noir meets thriller piece with Samuel Jackson as the ex-cop cleaner turned gumshoe is exquisitely shot and grabbed me from the first frame.  The novelty of the film which is never fully capitalized is its CSI turned inside out treatment.  Where CSI's characters just nail their cases - this world is filled with morally ambiguous people that are troubled by their decisions.

As the film unfolded, I was surprised to learn that it was helmed by Renny Harlin (admittedly not one of my favourite directors)  who, unlike his Die Hard days, exercises some artistic restraint in his treatment.  The cinematography and crisp images captivate you as you almost recall Angel Heart and Mickey Rourke losing his mind - but then the film descends into a beat-by-beat whodunit rather than a psychological thriller.  Instead of feeling in danger as we should, we become less intrigued as Renny connects the dots.

Cleaner starts magnificently but like so many Hollywood films, never escalates the potential and emotions of the characters or the plot.  There's a layer missing here, making Cleaner one of those could-have-beens.  Samuel Jackson remains peerless and the real reason to watch this. The overall cast is pretty good, but Renny, if you're going to do Noir, make it darker!

PS - Samuel's relationship with Keke Palmer - his screen daughter in the film is great and worth watching...",1215820800,,1422,5.012765957446809
3371774,4,B00151QYSK,"The Cleaner, like some other Samuel Jackson movies, comes packed with his powerful depiction, this time of an ex-police office (seems like picking up where the ""The Negotiator"" left off).

The premise is really nice, though not surprising. The moment I found out what job Jackson does, it was easy to guess how the plot could go. There are some dead give-aways, but then you probably already know that. In which case, you might also know that the movie does have some really enjoyable plot twists, and tight screenplay. The plot is simple (I could guess the whodunit aspect quite early in the movie - though not the motive!), but the performance of two great actors - Jackson and Harris make the movie a treat to watch.

I especially liked the background score of the movie, as IMO, it accentuated the mood of some of the shots depicting the Cleaner at work, as well as when he realizes he has a lot at stake to risk loosing it all.

What's missing (?), you might ask. Well, for starters, a plot that in addition to being so taught and well scripted, an actual original idea for a murder mystery would have been nice. Secondly, I concede that Jackson is capable of a lot more than what the movie has extracted out of him as an actor. He has done a wonderful job, but there are spots in the storyline where one could have imagined his character behave differently. I like him not just for his acting but also his dialogue (delivery), and I was left wanting more in that department. But then, that's just my opinion.

All in all, I would give this movie a 3.5 out of 5.
Definitely above average, and probably worth an Academy nomination.",1214438400,2,1635,4.494949494949495
3371775,4,B00151QYSK,"This was a really good movie! I'd never heard of it before. But it kept us riveted to the tv for its entirety. The suspense was good, the story played out well, the acting was top-notch. My only complaint is the plotline of the mystery itself was a little fragmented and a tiny bit confusing. The ending was a nice twist, a bit predictable in part, but still good. However, there was also confusion about Ann Norcut's involvement, was she or wasn't she manipulating the murderer? Did she or didn't she know of the murder at the time it occurred?  Was she truly surprised when Carver showed up at her house?  Was she ""playing"" him right along with the murderer?  She seemed so innocent, even at the end that we were left a bit mystified.  But Jackson was excellent as Carver, Ed Harris gritty & emotional as his ex-partner, the actors who played Vargas & Carver's ex-con worker were SUPER, everybody was really good in this.  I really liked the movie, but can't rate it up there with a ""mystic river"" type film due to the shaky plot/direction not making the story clear.",1214352000,,1069,4.518134715025907
3371776,3,B00151QYSK,"The premise of Cleaner centers around an ex police officer, Tom Carver [ Samuel L Jackson] who quit the profession due to some messy business having to do with a criminal dying in prison under suspicious circumstances. Tom is a widowed, single dad to a teenage daughter Rose [Keke Palmer] who is intelligent and spirited. Tom finds it harder each day to deal with his daughter's questions regarding her deceased mom and the circumstances surrounding her death. His job as a 'cleaner of crime scenes' seems to go along well until a fateful day when he gets called in to clean-up a homicide scene and finds that he was set-up - the crime he cleans up after was never reported to the police, and he in fact inadvertently acted as an accessory to cover it up. Soon, Tom finds himself the prime suspect in the case- and there are a bunch of crooked cops after him.

He turns in desperation to his ex-partner, Eddie Lorenzo [Ed Harris in a wasted role] who seems helpful enough yet resentful of Tom's cutting him out of Tom's and Rose's [Eddie is Rose's godfather] lives. Then there is Mrs Norcut [Eva Mendes in a subtle yet effective performance] whose house was the one Tom 'cleaned' and whose husband is missing. Is Mr Norcut the victim of foul play and if so, who is the party responsible? Things get messy and confusing and Tom finds himself being besieged by all sides, whilst he tries to figure everything out.

The movie certainly has an interesting idea yet suffers from poor execution. It is only saved by the performances of a good cast - from Samuel L Jackson's Tom Carver, to Eva Mendes's Mrs Norcut, and even credible acting by those performing in the minor roles such as Rose [Keke Palmer], Det Vargas [Luis Guzman] and Tom's assistant. Ed Harris offers a lacklustre performance here - and his role is wasted. Also, the movie suffers from an incredulous plotline halfway through, and we can see some of the twists from miles away.

It's not a bad movie, just lacking some spiciness. Final verdict: an average crime thriller.",1214179200,8,2033,4.641666666666667

8256979,4,B00151QYSK,"This is the story of a single dad who is running from himself. He works as a forensic ""cleaner"". He cleans up the messes that dead bodies leave when they have been killed violently.

Samuel L. Jackson finds himself in the middle of a mystery when it looks as if a job he was contracted for was actually a job meant to cover up a crime that was committed. Later he finds himself under investigation when the dead man's husband and homicide detectives think that he was the one responsible for the huband's death!

A very good movie that I give Four Stars as a Rate. The ending was a bit abrupt but I still liked this film and recommend it to people. I had no idea where this film was going and I liked the originality cleaners that clean up after crimes. The sadness of it also comes thru to us as viewers when we see and hear the wife of one of the victims crying in the background as Jackson goes to work. Apparently an armed robbery that went bad.

Eva Mendes (As Always) is great in this film and I highly recommend the film because of her and Ed Harris and Luis Guzman too.

Buy this DVD and you won't be disappointed. I'm the 92nd person to review this film.
