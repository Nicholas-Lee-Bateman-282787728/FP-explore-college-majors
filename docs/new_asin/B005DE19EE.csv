I'm writing this review primarily to warn potential buyers of the blu ray version that this disc is truly a region B disc, unlike many blu ray discs which are labeled region B but are identical to region A discs. If you do not have a region-free blu ray player, you will not be able to play this disc.",1451433600,,327,4.046153846153846
