7872740,5,6304462700,"I watched this amazing Nova documentary in awe. In part because 'yes' it finally puts to rest the controversy/legend of Princess Anastasia somehow surviving her execution along with the rest of the Romanov royal family. But awe because viewers are given an insight to the fanatical belief systems of people who are so heavily invested in a myth that, even when given irrefutable proof, they *choose* their myth instead. Shades and premonitions of OJ's jury abound.

It goes beyond stunning when you compare the video interviews of the proponents at the start of the documentary stating that if the DNA proves that Anna Anderson is not Anastasia - they would relent with no more argument. They're seem like solid, logical, even-tempered citizens. Then, when the results are finally revealed, their ""true"" face is revealed - that of the zealot.

They REFUSE to believe the results! Like some bizzare cult  they all start to recite their collected evidence like a mantra to push away the demons of reality. Scary and funny at the same time.

[Edited 5.11.13] - A year after I wrote this brief review, the remains of the last two children of Czar Nicholas II were discovered. I'm adding an edited version of my response to a post of this review...

This is not meant to hurt, but folks like yourselves have set-up the conditions so it becomes an unavoidable social pitfall. Just know that I take no pleasure in my response.

At this juncture the Anastasia question has, in essence, now become an article of faith for believers.

Science, and the then recent discovery (2007) of the remaining two missing Romanov children, has done all it can to expose and reveal the fallacy.

There exists no argument that will convince believers that they are espousing a fantasy concocted by a mentally ill woman. Therefore, outside of creating fiction, any further speculation arising out of that mistaken belief is pointless.

I've provided three well-recognized references. Firstly, the Los Angeles Times article providing general public dissemination. Secondly, the site specifically created by the co-discoverers of the missing Romanov children and subsequent DNA exploration of the same. And finally the published peer-reviewed results via The National Academy Of Sciences.

Notably, Dr. Michael Coble is a division director of the U.S. Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory, whose work is used to determine the identities of soldiers/sailors missing in action since the Civil War.

7872741,4,6304462700,Interesting--a nice little thing about how Grand Duchess Anastsasia Nikolaevna did NOT survive and Anna Anderson was indeed Franciska Shanzkovska.,1015286400,3,146,6.35
7872742,1,6304462700,"Much of the ""discoveries"" discussed in this video are either false (not intentional, they just didn't really do their homework) or very much outdated. The relative of the Polish factory worker was related to Fransziska through her father, not her mother. This video also does not discuss the fact that Anderson's tissue went missing for some months, then suddenly was ""found"". There is much more to this story, and if you want to learn the truth,this is not a good place to start. Some of the early, original books, such as the one by Gleb Botkin, or anything by Peter Kurth are far more enlightening.",972172800,13,601,4.733333333333333
7872743,5,6304462700,"As a Romanov enthusiast, I was very interested to see this special.  It did answer the question as to whether or not Anna Anderson Manahan was Anastasia; she wasn't.  The DNA evidence showed her to be Franziska  Schanzkowska, the Polish factory worker she had been purported to be.  This  lead to the question: since she was a factory worker, how did she know all  those private and very specific details about the Romanov's?  This question  the video couldn't answer.  It just goes to show that the Anastasia mystery  will probably never really be solved.  All in all, this was an excellent  video.  It was informative and very interesting.  While it was somewhat  disappointing to find out that Anna Anderson wasn't Anastasia, it finally  gave closure to that chapter of the Romanov mystery.  The next chapter is  still incomplete; in this video it shows the forensic and DNA evidence that  Alexei and Anastasia weren't in the mass grave along with the rest of their  family.  No one knows where they are and it seems that no one ever will.  A  must see for Romanov enthusiasts, Russian history buffs or anyone who likes  a good mystery.",912470400,7,1139,4.752577319587629
