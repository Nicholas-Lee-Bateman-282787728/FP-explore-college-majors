1045243,2,6305502560,"Bit of a letdown. There seem to be a few versions of the Trinity movies going around, many poorly transferred to DVD. Picture quality here was poor (even some ghosting in parts) and yes, the brilliant blue eyes are really not well seen! Sound is analog too, if you can believe it. Sadly, the movies have dated too: innovative then, it's all been done so many times now..",1105574400,3,370,4.455882352941177
1045244,5,6305502560,"This is a great pair of movies. Trinity is the right hand and his brother is the left hand of the devil. They can eat some pretty mean bread and beans. This would have been a blast to make. Pretty good shooting stunts, more moves than Clint Eastwood. This is in the strain of spaghetti western big time, but it's pretty funny too.",1092528000,4,330,4.253968253968254
1045245,5,6305502560,"Terence Hill plays Trinity (aka the left hand of the devil), a lightning fast gunfighter beyond comparison. We first meet him when he is on a travois being dragged into town by his horse. He's barefoot, and has to put his boots on. Fishing out a scorpion, he then puts his boots on and goes in a canteena where his starvation raises some eyebrows. After shooting three men in the blink of an eye, he finishes his meal. If you think this is gruesome, it's actually comedy. Trinity outshoots everyone in this movie. Watch for the running gag of three men supporting a roof whose supports have been shot out. As it turns out, Trinity has come to town to see his brother-the sheriff (aka bambino-the right hand of the devil). This is a comedic spaghetti western without all of the heaviness of a Clint Eastwood western. Enjoy this movie.",1013558400,5,833,4.56
1045246,5,6305502560,"I saw this movie over 25 years ago in San Antonio, Texas, at the now-closed Aztec Three Theatres downtown; a friend of mine asked if I could find this title, and here it is! I can't wait to buy it! Fantastic!",951523200,4,208,4.097560975609756
1045247,5,6305502560,Trinity would shoot up the good the bad and the ugly... he is by far the toughest cowboy never to be filmed in the US.,947721600,4,118,3.76
1045248,5,6305502560,"This is a truly classic pair of movies.  I enjoyed them in the 70's and now my 6 year old and I can enjoy them together.  It is good, clean fun.  True the quality is not that great, but, look at the credits.  My credit  card has a higher limit than the budget for this film.  BTW, the few  non-Italian names in the credits (like Terence Hill & Bud Spencer) are  not real.  Even the blonde haired blue eyed star (Hill) was born Mario  Girotti.",940377600,5,442,4.094117647058823
1045249,5,6305502560,"Although the picture quality is low, the editing is poor and the acting is horrendous, the whole idea of a couple of half-brothers that are the fastest-draw gunslingers in the West is remarkable.  Trinity is the cute  guy who doesn't like to work.  Bambino hates Trinity cause he always gets  both of them into trouble.  These 2 are known as the left and right hand of  the devil, and when they work together they get a job done right, though  not the way you might expect.",939427200,,473,4.430232558139535

1045850,4,6305502560,This item arrived early and in great condition. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is due to the movie's age . It's an older movie and the dubbing is bad. I know they cant help this. It was the same way when I watched it 20+ years ago.,1404691200,,241,3.7450980392156863

1045943,1,6305502560,BARELY BEARABLE TO WATCH.....NOT NECESSARILY PROVIDERS FAULT BUT SHOULD HAVE BEEN NOTIVIED OF THE POOR QUALITY OF THIS RECORDING.  TERRIBLE,1363651200,2,139,5.95
1045944,5,6305502560,"They Call Me Trinity and Trinity Is Still My Name are among the many movies I saw on military bases years ago when they were new. I ordered and received the double sided DVD version. The first Trinity movie is my favorite. I see some negative reviews regarding poor quality and cropping in these full screen versions. The quality seems fine to me. Both movies are like I remembered seeing them on the large screen. To me the quality is just fine and looks good whether viewing them on my old large full screen analog TV or on my latest multiple screen choice digital jumbo screen. I switch from normal (full screen) to wide screen and the picture fills my wide screen. The only screen choice I do not prefer is panoramic (black bars) on top and below the picture (like letter box) which I hate. My choice of ways to view this DVD on my newest flat screen TV gives me just that, choice in how I want to view it. So that fuss made by some about quality holds no water with me. I consider having these movies on DVD as added Gems in my personal collection of favorites. I rate the doubled sided DVD 5 stars because I'm 100% satisfied and glad I own it now.

1045945,1,6305502560,The DVD had a chip in the center hole so that I had to position it away from the chip when using a snap-in dvd player such as on a laptop.  If I did not then it would wobble in the player.  The video quality was horrible as well and I had to switch players because the dvd would keep getting stuck on a scene.,1168300800,,309,3.7384615384615385

1045947,3,6305502560,"The first two Trinity movies are great fun.  Trinity and his brother Bambino are true spaghetti western anti-heros, but not in a serious Eastwood way.  This is a dirty stinky west that most likely is true but not a place where you would want to be.  Some of the flaws attributed to the disc is actually in the films... bad dubbing et al. The plots is loose so you have to hang on and just enjoy the fun.

These are public domain so there are not any great transfers and this is similar to the two others that I have seen. Just enjoy the movies.

How many Trinity movies are there? How many people played Trinity?

Maybe someday we will get a good version on DVD.",1149206400,,662,4.214285714285714
1045948,1,6305502560,"The movie is a very good movie, Yet I lost track of the CD due the failure of placing a noticable lable on the Disk.  It is very important to have a visiual label on the product inorder that one whould be able to varify what Disc they are about to watch.  I hope that your organization would start to label the Disc which you send to your consumers.

Be aware that the first movie comes from a badly damaged original, but I did not subtract more stars for the video quality because I am fairly sure that this is the best transfer possible given the film's age and obscurity. The second movie looks significantly better and as a package, I think this set represents the best copies available for these two films. I would be happy to be proven wrong, but I doubt we will see another, improved version of these movies on bluray, much less 4k.",1513296000,,532,4.494845360824742
