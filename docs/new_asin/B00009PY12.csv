1887762,5,B00009PY12,"This is an outstanding hour of comedy. I disagree with one of the other reviewers about its production values because, with stand-up comics, production values are totally irrelevant. All that really matters with comedians is the quality of their material. If the material's great then it doesn't matter if there are any frills or whistles. This hour is better than the average Jackie Mason and it's distilled. There are few pauses and the DVD accelerates his delivery by breaking his performance into acts which takes out a lot of dead air time. This performance is probably about twenty years old, and I'm not sure he'd have the same things to say today about Ronald Reagan that he did back then. Regardless of a changed perspective, he puts forth some absolutely hysterical stuff here.",1176854400,7,787,4.924812030075188

1887764,5,B00009PY12,"I saw this show on HBO shortly after its Broadway debut. I recalled Mason from my youth but preferred other ""more cool"" comedians back then. But this show converted me to Mason's brand of humor. In fact, he became my wife's and my favorite comedian, dislodging George Carlin from that position (quite a change, I realize that!). Because, arguably, this show boosted Mason to the superstar comedian rank, I give it 5 stars.",1171065600,,422,4.794520547945205

1887771,5,B00009PY12,"Jackie Mason is my favorite comedian.  His routines are based on incisive observations of human behavior and are hilariously accurate (albeit sometimes a bit repetitive/exaggerated) portrayals of cultural differences.  His humorous routines juxtapose the way in which people of  different cultural underpinnings deal with like situations. His roasting characterizations of famous personalities are equally entertaining.  Patience with overstatement, redundancy, and usual issues with generalizations may be necessary to free oneself to fully savor the joys of experiencing (most of) his standup performances. He must be the funniest rabbi on the planet.  (OTOH, my wife, who was not raised with NY schtick, doesn't agree with me at all.)",1341532800,,737,5.850467289719626

I'd invest in it.  Which are words, I'll tell you the truth, I never should said to my goyische cup brother-in-law.

Hey, but let me tell you something, I kinow who I am.  This guy over here in the second row -- doesn't know who he is.  Sends himself an e-mail, never gets it.

You understand what I'm saying? ... Mister?

But seriously, I have the utmost respect for people from all walks of life.  Because it's not in my nature, not in my character, not in my being, to abuse or mistreat or talk dirty or disrespectfully about any people, of any race, color or creed. ... Except you.  And the hooker sitting next to you.

Oh, is that your wife?  Lovely woman.  Jewish?  And she knows where the kitchen is?
Mazel tov!

(Runs his fingers over his ear.)  No but I'll tell you though, everything nowadays is sex.  Sex, sex, sex.  So it's a nice department store, personally I can live without it, I shop at Macy's.

People tell me, Jackie get married.  But why should I?  Last week, every night of the week, I went out with a beautiful curly-headed woman.  A different one every night. ... No hair, just seven women all with curly heads.

I have to go now but before I do I want to thank each and everyone of you for making me a hit.  But I'm such a big hit now why should I spend time with a lowlife crowd like you?

And remember, whether you're a Gentile or a Jew, white or black, rich or poor, we're all brothers. ... Except you, mister.  Get out!  You I don't like altogether!",1262736000,,1647,4.19551282051282

1887774,5,B00009PY12,"PROLOGUE...........

For My Friends and Relatives:

A few years ago, my mom and I were discussing various other members of our family.  I guess I said a few uncomplimentary things, because my mother said: ""You don't like your family!""  I replied with some of the most serious, truest words I had ever said to anyone:  ""I LOVE my family.  I just wish they weren't Jewish.""

To some, these words may sound funny -- almost Woody Allen-ish, (or Jackie Masonic).  But to me, they are not funny.  They are deadly serious words that scream ""truth"" from my subconscious.  Being Jewish, to me, makes all the sense of being a ""canary in a coal mine,"" -- one of ""God's Chosen Victims"", as it were.  Call me weird -- but I don't want to be a canary!  I want to be a swan!  Prejudice aside, there is also the little matter of the strictures and limitations Judaism ""obligates"" one to have and do.  I have never seen the sense, for instance, in missing my favourite TV shows because it's Yom Kippur....or Passover...or the Sabbath, etc.  Eating pork doesn't harm people who aren't Jewish!  And does it not say in the US Constitution that ""All Men, (and presumably, all women as well), Are Created Equal""?  Judaism would have Jews to be holy, and Gentiles to be righteous.  Cannot both BE both?  Also, I have read about the dictum that ""every Jewish man is a king, and every Jewish woman is a Queen.""  Balony!  I myself like to write fantasy -- but I know the difference between fantasy and reality!  Kings and queens of what, may I ask?  And if this is true....the world sure has had a very strange way of respecting these ""kings"" and ""queens"" -- throughout history!  ""Assination""---of body, and of character, has long been the tragedy of too many of these Jewish ""Kings"" and ""Queens"".  This religious dictum is naught but poppycock!  And I really hate for the people in my family -- people I truly respect and truly, truly love, to be subjected to even the possibilty of ""assassination""....character or otherwise.  Of course, their lives are their own...and they can obviusly lead them their own way.  I just want to be able to live MY own life, MY own way. Also -- up till this year -- when I learnt that someone else who is Jewish, is fullfilling MY lifelong heart's desire -- by marrying an English Lord this coming September -- I always thought my being Jewish, would TOTALLY preclude my achieving this life-long, (and very strong), desire.  Not even converting would help -- would it?  I am happy to say that the young lady who is to marry the English Lord this September has a father who, though Jewish, does not ""practice"" the religion into which he was born.  I surmise his daughter does likewise......  Hooray!

No -- Judaism does NOT agree with me.  And I do not agree with it! I have great respect for those who WANT to be Jewish -- just as I have respect for those who want to follow ANY other religion.  But for myself, I am an Agnostic -- believing in God, but in no particular religion -- for me, anyway.  (Of course, if a Protestant, Catholic, or Moslem HRH were to ask me to marry them, I'd change my religion very fast.  Even if a Jewish desendant of King David -- who would restore Israel to a Monarchy, would ask me to marry him, I might, indeed, (THEN), become Jewish.  But right now, Judaism seems to be denying me my life-long dream...as well as many other things, like peace of mind.  I continue to love and respect ALL of my relatives, but Judaism, for so many reasons, continues to turn me off.  I hope they may understand this, and, as well, understand the review, below.......

THE REVIEW.......

My mom wanted to watch this show, when it was first shown on TV,
and I felt I had to join her -- not because she was forcing me,
but because I have always DETESTED Jewish culture, and wanted to
""go into the lion's den"" and find out WHY.

I've done this before, with other Jewishly-themed programs -- to
no success.  Here, however, I stuck GOLD!  Mr. Mason delineates
the differences between Gentile and Jewish culture, giving a list
of what Gentile culture admires.  (I believe he gives a list of
the hallmarks of Jewish culture, too -- but as I am totally
uninterested in this, I didn't write it down.)  However, I DID
write down all the things that connote Gentile culture -- including
physical perfection, loving the ballet, looking like a statue, never
getting sick, getting out of a chair easily, laughing easily,
looking like you have worked on a farm, eating at croweded restaurants without asking what the price of the
food is, choosing food from a menu without being concerned as to
what it is, making decorations out of food, and being agressive.  I have kept this list of traits
carefully in a notebook, and have tried to emulate and assimilate
them.

Yes, assimilation IS MY salvation!  And -- although I know Mr.
Mason's intention in this performance was NOT to teach wannabee-
WASPS how to act and, perhaps, think the way real WASPS do, he
has, willy-nilly, succeeded in this, by listing so many (wonderful!)
Gentile characteristics!

Thank you, Mr. Mason.  For me, you have succeeded in giving me what
I wnat, beyond my fondest dreams, (and, I daresay, your own worst
nightmares!)  But thanks!  I am SO grateful!  And I DO mean it!

1887775,5,B00009PY12,This is a great show - the amazing come-back for Jackie Mason that relaunched his career. His real-life perceptions of Jewish and Gentile cultures are simply hilarious!! A real delight. You will be in stitches. Keep an eye out for the Ed Sullivan impersonation. This is definitely worth the price for a masterpiece of a classic comedian to add to your DVD collection.,1231286400,,367,4.841269841269841
1887776,5,B00009PY12,"This show was recorded twenty years ago, but as I watched it, the material, delivery, and humor seemed fresh and cogent and not dated at all.  Seems a throw back might appear out of date and unfunny given the new comics and their dirty and blue material.  But Mr. Mason reminds us how timeless and funny he can be with a clean show.  I have watched it three times already so that I would not miss any of his comments.  His accent and delivery are too regional and fast for my adopted southern home.  But I finally got it all.",1215820800,,525,4.21

7992370,3,B00009PY12,"How many comedians do you know who can make you laugh without using foul language?  (Supposedly giving the finger to a famous MC doesn't count). If Lewis Black gets close to the 40 F-word limit, he could buy the rights for another 40 from Mason at bargain prices. Jackie Mason is one of very few comedians who can make me laugh on a regular basis--even with politically incorrect jokes about Puerto Ricans, Italians,and Irish. (As long as he stays clear of Greeks, it's OK by me.) He would have been my comic hero had he not supported Meir Kahane and every other known hate-filled Jewish extremist. To accommodate such tastes better, he turned from Democrat to Republican. Thankfully, his 1988 The World According to Me predates his public love affair with extremism. Still, since politics can't be surgically removed from comedy without serious complications, I withhold 2 stars as my special anti-hate fee.",1475971200,,908,4.934640522875817
