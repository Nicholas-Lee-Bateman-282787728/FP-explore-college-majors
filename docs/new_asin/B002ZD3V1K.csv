not up to the quality story lines as the first two.",1274227200,4,114,4.0
4015122,3,B002ZD3V1K,"It's great to have these episodes available on DVD, but the first disc is obviously unbalanced and vibrates so violently it sounds like it's going to shake my DVD player apart. Also, it would have been a small matter to include an enclosure listing the episode titles, but there was nothing. Still, I'm happy to have it.",1267833600,11,320,4.631578947368421
4015123,5,B002ZD3V1K,I had no problem playing any of the discs in this set (which I purchased from amazon). The player I used was a panasonic standard dvd player. I would be interested to know how well these play in blu-ray players.,1266710400,8,211,4.3
4015124,5,B002ZD3V1K,"Roxbury/Infinty have had a rocky time releasing Route 66 on DVD. The first half of season one used poor quality prints, including one edited episode. The second half of season one was originally released with the aspect ratio altered. The aspect ratio was corrected with the complete first season release, but the poor quality prints remained. Season two came off without a hitch, but the ""Best Buy exclusive"" release of season three was marred by disc authorship problems. I am happy to report that the corrected release (packaged in a yellow-hued plastic as another commenter has noted) has played well, though with the disc rattle that has plagued several Infinty releases. The A/V quality on this release is good, if not up to Image Entertainment standards. Solid blacks and little debris present. Also, there is no episode list contained in this set. The show itself is, of course, one of the best in US TV history, so it's worth overlooking the minor quibbles (disc rattle and no booklet).",1266364800,33,995,4.928571428571429
4015125,5,B002ZD3V1K,"I have obtained the complete First, Second and Third Seasons of Route 66 through amazon.com and have been overjoyed with the quality of the digital remastering done by Infinity Entertainment.  This seminal '60s period piece is a must for anyone who can identify with the Kerouac ""On the Road"" era.  I personally cannot wait for the final (fourth) season to be released in its entirety.",1265587200,8,385,4.907692307692308
4015126,5,B002ZD3V1K,"Fabulous!!! Takes you right back to a more uncluttered time in American life.
Arrived within the time promised by the seller. Totally pleased with this purchase.",1265328000,4,161,5.230769230769231
4015127,3,B002ZD3V1K,"This is a review of this specific DVD package combining Season 3 Parts 1 and 2. Disc 2 has unreadable sections on it. I've tried a DVD player, Blu-Ray player, and several PC drives, and all freeze at certain times on Disc 2 (previously issued as Disc 2 of Season 1, Part 1). I received two replacement copies from Amazon with exactly the same defect. Whether it's a manufacturer's problem or simply a defect in a certain batch, I don't know. This was taken off the Amazon market for a short time, but since it's available again I assume this problem has been resolved. I'll wait awhile before purchasing the set again, however.",1264982400,22,627,4.557522123893805
4015238,1,B002ZD3V1K,"I have season 1 & 2 of Route 66 and they are fine.  Unfortunately season 3 seems to have a problem.  Discs 1, 2 and 4 make a terrible pounding sound and won't play.  I've tried this on 2 different DVD players and no luck.  I ordered season 3 twice and both were bad.  Not sure why some reviewers received good discs.",1332374400,4,316,4.032258064516129
4015239,1,B002ZD3V1K,Disk 2 of this set has a known defect that causes the disk to stop playing in all DVD players.  This item should not be offered for sale at any price without disclaimer.  Was very disappointed as the episode I wanted was on disk 2!,1329091200,5,231,4.111111111111111
4015240,5,B002ZD3V1K,"I really enjoyed this collection of episodes. Route 66 was probably one of the more classier shows that CBS put on the air during the early 1960's, and this collection is outstanding. The images are clear and the links to the episodes are easy for most DVD players to pick up and display.",1327622400,,288,4.452830188679245
4015241,1,B002ZD3V1K,The actual product quality was very disappointing - half of the DVD's in the 8 DVD set would not play on any of my DVD players. (playback error codes) After doing some research on line I found a number complaints with others having similar problems... It seems that there's something wrong with the batch of Route 66 season 3 DVD's made for Best Buy. And with Amazon's 50% return policy on DVD's it's not worth my time or money to return the DVD's.,1326326400,5,448,4.409638554216867
4015242,1,B002ZD3V1K,Got the COMPLETE THIRD SEASON for Christmas and was dissapointed. The volume 2 dvd discs refused to play or be read. All they do is vibrate and rattle so hard which says poor quality. Total waste. Will never order a DVD from Roxbury/Infinity again.,1325894400,5,248,4.659090909090909
4015243,2,B002ZD3V1K,"Sorry to report quality problems appear to persist.  I just received Season 3 (marked as ""Best Buy exclusive"")from Amazon, and Volume 1 Disc 1 freezes every 5-10 seconds in my DVD player.  I didn't experiment with any of the other discs in my DVD player, but I did try a couple of discs from the set in my Blu-Ray player, and they don't get past the opening ""Warning"" and ""Infinity Entertainment"" screens.  This is really too bad, because the quality of the image is quite good, but pretty unwatchable in 7-second chunks.",1324857600,3,521,4.641304347826087
4015244,5,B002ZD3V1K,"Great show and location filming.
Hopefully they will produce a DVD on the last season with commentary from a few directors and Martin Milner and George Maharis(even though he was not in  season 4).",1290124800,3,197,4.794117647058823
4015245,5,B002ZD3V1K,"The third season of Route 66 saw the replacement of ""Buz"" with ""Linc"" as Todd's travel companion on the road. Although I liked George Maharis better than Glen Corbett, he still does a great job with his character. There are some really great episodes in this season if you able to watch them. My set came with 3 defective discs, and I returned it to Amazon. Getting a good set is kind of like playing Russian Roulette from the manufacturer Infinity / Roxbury Entertainment. When you are able to play the discs, the quality of the picture and sound are quite good, it's a shame that the problem is with the production of the physical discs. I just got a new Panasonic Blu-Ray player and I kept getting ""Unsupported Disc"" but the thing was making so much noise in the player you could tell it was not a disc formatting issue. I put it in 2 other players with the same results - the discs were not readable. You would think that they would just re-manufacture this product with GOOD discs instead of having to play the return game. Anyway I hope Season 4 is being released soon, on better quality discs that is!",1290038400,10,1108,4.436274509803922
4015246,1,B002ZD3V1K,"After returning two sets of the Complete Third Season, I will bide my time until the manufacturing process creating defective discs is examined and resolved.  The first set had a bad Vol 1 Disc 4 and the replacement set had a bad Vol 1 Disc 4 and Vol 2 Disc 1.  I have the Complete Seasons One and Two and would like to add the Third and Fourth Seasons.  On a personal note, I feel there are several excellent episodes that warrant the purchase of Season Three.  This would have been a 5 star review if not for the defective discs.",1275523200,11,531,4.227722772277228
4015247,4,B002ZD3V1K,"I put off my purchase of Route 66 The complete Third Season after reading about the callbacks.

It was worth the wait.

My first purchase of anything Route 66 was the complete collection and I was very dissapointed in the product.

It looked like it was made in someone's basement and was missing ten episodes which were replaced.

This is where I learned the people replacing the missing and garbled episodes did not understand English.

The product was so cheap in so many ways it was not worth me spending money to ship it back which they should have paid.

There are so few episode left in the fourth season why didn't they just ad them to the Third Season?",1274918400,4,661,4.466666666666667
8384614,5,B002ZD3V1K,"One of the best TV shows ever produced, from the writing to the acting, to the cinematography. A real American gem. Season 3 has a couple of my favorite episodes, though all seasons are terrific. And while one does miss Buz, Linc is an excellent character as well, even better in my book.",1435968000,,288,4.452830188679245
8384615,3,B002ZD3V1K,"I experienced problems on several of the discs.  They arrived with scratches on some of the discs and some the episodes would partially play, then start over at the beginning.  I was not satisfied with the condition of the discs.",1424649600,,229,4.7
8384616,5,B002ZD3V1K,Great shows...........they stand the test of time.,1423526400,,50,6.285714285714286

8384618,5,B002ZD3V1K,Loved the series,1421193600,,16,4.666666666666667
8384619,5,B002ZD3V1K,Route 66 Season 3 id as good quality as the other DVD's. very exciting episodes. Brings back a lot of memories.,1396828800,,111,4.333333333333333
8384620,4,B002ZD3V1K,"What can you say about Route 66 except that it's one of the greatest TV series ever made.  The episodes with George Maharis are stellar.  The ones with Martin Milner alone are very good.  I do have trouble enjoying the episodes with Lincoln Case (Glenn Corbett).  Case/Corbett is such a brooding, depressed character who doesn't seem to get along with Todd Styles/Martin Milner very well.  I find that I just don't have the patience for these episodes and I'll likely skip season 4 for this reason.  Maharis was truly the star of this series, although without Milner, it wouldn't have worked  at all.

Picture quality is great on some episodes, and only OK on others.  All are watchable.  Sound is good on every episode.  Some of the disks vibrate in my player (and they vibrate in every player I tried them in).  Still, they play without error.  If you love Route 66 don't skip this set.",1395532800,,888,4.615384615384615
8384621,4,B002ZD3V1K,"Season Three starts becoming predictable - especially with its psycho women - except for the fact that Buz is missing in a lot of the episodes. George Maharis, who plays Buz, was having health problems, and he is replaced a little more than half-way in the season by Glenn Corbett. Glenn is a nice-looking, likable actor, but he just doesn't have the fire of Maharis. Martin Milner continues to be the glue that holds the show together, and always delivers a great performance.

One interesting aspect is how the Corvette changes. In the episodes where Buz is missing, they use a Stingray. In the rest, it's the pre-Stingray style. They mix the episodes up somewhat, so that, one episode, Tod (Milner) is driving the Stingray, the next episode Buz will be back and he's driving the previous model. Then the Stingray will come back the next time Buz has to go into the hospital, which is exactly what was happening with Maharis in real life.

As in the previous seasons, there are plenty of stars, and that is one of the interesting aspects of Route 66: you get to see some big-name stars getting their start, as well as some famous old-timers. You also get to see a lot of different locations around the country and how they looked back in the early 60s. Things have really changed. But what hasn't changed is human nature, and Route 66 is known for its cutting-edge drama that brings out the best and worst in human nature, and always has a great Christ-based message to deliver at the end.",1394668800,,1491,4.601503759398496
8384622,5,B002ZD3V1K,My husband is an old car enthusiast and he really loves the Route 66 series. It arrived on time and is exactly what he wanted.,1392940800,,126,4.08
8384623,4,B002ZD3V1K,"I previously purchased parts of the 3rd season, so for me, some discs are duplicates.  However, the product is very good and I enjoy watching this old program.",1351728000,,159,4.678571428571429
