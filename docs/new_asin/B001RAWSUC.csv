8337651,4,B001RAWSUC,"I just absolutely love Gael Garcia, so when I saw this 3 pack, I freaked ;).... it contains the ever so popular Y Tu Mama Tambien, the Almodovar masterpiece La Mala Educacion, and the less known El Pasado. For a true fan of all of Gaels work this is a very good pack with good variety. This pack came at a great deal.... and I received in a timely matter. Only negative is that there is a scene missing from Bad Education which makes me wonder hmmm.",1360368000,,449,4.172413793103448
