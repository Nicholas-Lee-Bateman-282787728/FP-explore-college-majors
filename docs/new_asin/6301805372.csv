373509,5,6301805372,!!!!!!!! Did not know this was available on dvd. My family would watch the vhs so many times. And we used so many quotes from it in our daily vocabulary. Now I can share this with my three grandaughters!!,1341014400,,204,4.256410256410256
373510,5,6301805372,"I haven't seen this movie in a coon's age, so imagine my jubilation when I see it available on DVD!  Both the video and audio are excellent digital transfers from the original master.  This movie is letterboxed in 16:9.  The only drawbacks I find is that there are no special features, not even the movie trailer.  And, the chapter breaks are every 10 minutes, rather than being based on key turning points in the movie.  Nonetheless, I am very pleased that this movie made it to DVD, at long last.  Thank you MGM!!",1331424000,3,515,4.483870967741935

373512,5,6301805372,"This movie is probably not for kids.  It's for people who like bad movies and Vietnam veterans.

The acting is god-awful, the script is a joke, the (actual) jokes are unintentionally painful, and the plot is silly.  But it has an absolutely incredible ending that 100% does not belong in a children's movie.  I cannot recommend enough people sit through the terrible first 90 minutes, because it's so worth it.",1277683200,,410,4.814285714285714
373513,5,6301805372,"This is a sometimes slow, sometimes plain silly movie, but it has a lot of suspense, a good bit of humor, and a decent amount of action.  It is one of my favorite movies.  The boy leaves the big city and his mother to visit his outdoors type father near a factory that makes secret stuff.  He is kidnapped by two hicks from the sticks.  The scenery is great and the action is fun but serious.  This movie isn't for everyone, but I love it.",1215734400,2,439,4.117647058823529
373514,2,6301805372,"I watched this movie again for the first time in years.  I was curious to see if I would judge it as harshly as I did when it was first released back in 1984.  It broke my heart back then (and does again) because with the exquisite setting/scenery I WANT to like this movie.  I really do.

*The lead character is played by Jeremy Shamos, but not well.  The performance is wooden and mechanical.

*The movie itself is schizoid.  It begins as a movie about an overscheduled, spoiled kid from the city going to the mountains to reunite with his dad for a while and then about 30-40 minutes in shifts gears very abruptly and becomes a story about the boy escaping from two kidnappers who want to get their hands on a roll of film that the boy is unwittingly carrying on him thanks to a panicked spy.  At this point it gets even mroe formulaic and trite.  Boy discovers his own courage, finds rescue, gets away from bad guys.

I find that the years have not really mellowed my opinion.  I wanted very much to like this movie, but aside from two high points (character ""Ansel Flint Highlander Ford"" who makes only a very brief appearance and the song that Jeremy's dad plays for him in the early part of the movie) it is a sad wasted opportunity.",1214179200,,1240,4.3478260869565215

7816293,3,6301805372,"I remember watching this movie when I was about five or maybe six. I was sick; coughing profusely and drinking cup-after-cup of horehound tea. I thought it tasted awful, but I just pretended it was skunk berry tea just to get it down to help with my coughing. This film might seem stupid now but what do you want it's a low budget kids film made in the mid 80's. The script, the plot is a little hodgepodge and not well written, but it kept you entertained and capture that child  hood imagination... from what I can remember.",1515024000,,526,4.36734693877551
