4693558,5,B005GSHWXE,"What Steven Raichlen does not know about BBQ probably isn't worth knowing.
This is a superb set and gives you a comprehensive insight on what to look for in a BBQ, techniques using different BBQ's, and of course how to BBQ anything from a minute steak through to a whole hog. There is even some vegetarian BBQ recipes and techniques.

We found Mr Raichlen a wealth of knowldege and is compelling to watch as he steps you through every technique and senario you could possibly imagine. The set are set up into a logical order of episodes and as you watch them, they become quite addictive to watch and learn.

This is a must for anyone who wants to not only learn the basics of BBQing, but also for those who want to expand their confidence in BBQing things other than sausages and steaks.",1364774400,2,788,4.465277777777778

8472264,5,B005GSHWXE,I watch these videos whenever there isn't something substantive on TV (which is too frequently). I've learned more from Steven in a short time this year without screwing up food ruining it practicing. I've also learned about many new meals and techniques I'd never though of on my own. I'll give him three thumbs up on this one.,1401840000,,328,4.672413793103448

8472266,5,B005GSHWXE,I ordered his 2 season DVD based on the reviews.  Then I watched him on his site on the web and thought oh boy I think I made a mistake BUT not so.  He is so much better and the side notes are great.  My only complaint - forget about trying to write down the recipes for the DVD just go to his web site and you can copy paste.  I plan on purchasing his book (s).,1389398400,,362,3.6623376623376624
