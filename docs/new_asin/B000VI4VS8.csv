8218695,2,B000VI4VS8,"This is not the best RATA BLANCA DVD! and is good only if you want the collection DVD'S, on the back cover have a message the quality is not the best! but not affect the material content,, this DVD is like when you ask a friend to take care of the camera by first time! The songs are great but the sound quality is pretty bad, the image quality is worse! only if your a real FAN of this band I will recommend.",1353888000,,409,3.9397590361445785
