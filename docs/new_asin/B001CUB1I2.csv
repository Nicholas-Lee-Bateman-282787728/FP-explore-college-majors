8290026,5,B001CUB1I2,"Not one F-15 has been lost to combat since its introduction thirty+ years ago; meanwhile, 104 opponent aircraft have been lost.  Prior to this, the Korean War 10:1 win ratio (Sabre jets vs. current MIGs) had been considered outstanding.

However, the Vietnam War brought a 1:1 win ratio of F-4s vs. the latest MIG.  Its missiles had only a 14% success rate at the war's beginning (designed to shoot down large bombers, not fighters), and over 3,000 Phantoms were lost.  Worse yet, the 1967 Moscow Air Show introduced a newer MIG-25 Foxbat.

The USAF made the design and production of an improved jet its top priority.  However, none of the proposals were acceptable.  In desperation Maj. John Boyd (aka ""Mad Major"") was asked for his input.  ""Stealing"" over $1 million in Pentagon computer time and aided by a mathematician friend, he developed new specifications.

The result was the ""Heads Up Display,"" 0-30,000 feet in 60 seconds capability, and powerful air-to-air radar for  guiding missiles.

Israel as the first nation to employ the F-15 in combat, shooting down Foxbats in the Israeli-Syria War.  U.S. combat experience came later in Gulf I, Gulf II, and Afghanistan.",1221868800,,1175,5.0
