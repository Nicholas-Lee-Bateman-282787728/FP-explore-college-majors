5731261,2,B00CNIDI5Q,"because this was a PureFlix production I bought the CD. Acting in it was not good at all, story went on too long and just boring. A good concept of an idea for forgiveness but I wouldn't wast money and purchase Pureflix again.

5731273,2,B00CNIDI5Q,"I can't understand the top ratings on this movie. Its home style camera, it done in someone's car and in someone's house (real low budget). The message was not clear, not sure if it is supposed to be a christian movie. Directing was average and the acting was almost absent. it had occasional moments hence the 2 star else I would give it one star.",1401926400,3,348,4.369230769230769
5731274,5,B00CNIDI5Q,"I know the director, Roger Lindley, personally.  He is the real deal. As long as I have known him, he has said he wanted to make Christian movies.  He believed for this to happen for a long time, when there was no way.  He kept saying I think this is something God wants me to do.  I felt it was one of the better acted Christian movies and that Roger did a good job of directing..",1398384000,,381,3.973684210526316
5731275,4,B00CNIDI5Q,"I love the message in this movie! We often try to go back and try to make things right! But, that is not our job! We are to move forward from where we are standing. Christ is the one who makes all things right! He forgives us!",1396483200,,226,3.8297872340425534
5731276,5,B00CNIDI5Q,"This movie was awesome. It kept you on the edge of your seat and challenged your faith. Also, made you think about how you would do in that situation. Good movie for teens and adults! Loved it!",1395705600,2,193,4.243243243243243
5731277,5,B00CNIDI5Q,"when I first started watching this it was okay, then it got a little confusing on what was happening,then the next 5 minutes explained it all,and the ending was not what I was expecting,it really throws you off,your like not expecting this great ending,this movie was great,i would recommend it to everyone, I think I might go watch it again.good mind blower,bye going to amazon prime.",1394582400,,385,4.848484848484849
5731278,3,B00CNIDI5Q,"On the night that he is released from prison, Lucas Blackstone (Angus Mac Fadyen) sets out for the town of Trinity to seek revenge on the man who murdered his son.

Armed with a pistol and a past full of mistakes, Lucas kidnaps Shawn Everett (Bradley Dorsey) and his wife, Carrie (Haylie Duff) and holds them hostage. As the trio travels to Trinity, Lucas learns of Shawn and Carrie s troubled marriage and questions their ability to reconcile their love through their faith in God.  But Lucas has no interest in their faith, that is until he discovers the horrible truth about his son s killer.",1393372800,2,595,4.60377358490566
5731279,5,B00CNIDI5Q,"The movie tells the story of a man trying to cope with the tragic death of his son and his run-in with a troubled couple.  The ending is not quite what you expect.  It's one of the saddest movies I have seen, and it had most of my family in tears.  It is a very well done movie.",1393113600,,278,3.7586206896551726
5731280,1,B00CNIDI5Q,Very poorly put together has some know actors but they forgot how to act. Good message but what else can I say,1391472000,,110,4.045454545454546
5731281,4,B00CNIDI5Q,Great movie. Great story. A little twist at the end. Well-worth watching. It's even comical too at times. I recommend.,1391472000,,118,4.95
5731282,4,B00CNIDI5Q,"Beyond the expected Christian values, the acting & production values were very good along with a good plot twist. Very enjoyable and heart felt",1391385600,5,143,5.0
5731283,5,B00CNIDI5Q,Love this movie it was a great one. I watched it twice already and going to watch it some more,1390348800,,94,3.75
5731284,4,B00CNIDI5Q,"Great movie!!!! The plot was great and so was the acting. Lucas and his wife were soooo great together.

Now for the more refined review:

The movie itself was a bit slow in terms of there was no intense/high action moments which is actually good because it made it feel more realistic. (Meant To Be had a similar pace for the most part).
The message itself was 'OK' but it struck a personal chord at the end with the verse, ""therefore there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.."" which still amazes me because of no matter what we have done (Paul persecuted the Church!) we are fully and freely forgiven through the grace of Christ, and that His goodness towers over all that we have done. ""Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?""
The above was a personal thing but objectively the 'OK' Christian message takes off a star. What could have been more prominent was the whole story of God's grace through salvation and atonement of Christ to strengthen it a bit more.
The character's being Christian (at least Lucas' wife) didn't stand out that much either.
And last of all the credits at the end wrapped up the story nicely but it made it seem as if it were a true story (that and the slow pace).
Overall, nice movie!",1389312000,,1339,4.528925619834711
5731285,5,B00CNIDI5Q,"Angus Macfadyen (Lucas Blackstone-the kidnapper) and Haylie Duff (Carrie-the wife) did a great job on thier acting. I don't know if this is a true story or not-at the end it did feel like it might have been. I did not watch ""behind the scenes or Actor interviews) to find out more about this movie.
It is hard for a wife or husband to forgive infidelity. I truly only believe that it would be ALMOST impossiable to do that without the Lord's help. I am speaking from being a wife myself and married for over 10 years.
This movie does show how HARD that forgiveness can be...even to forgive yourself of something you did can be ROUGH. This is a movie of forgiveness and Love. I wish the movie would have went a little more into the ""forgive yourself"" aspect but over all-we enjoyed watching it.
This movie does not ""capture"" you to the point where you cant get up and walk away but it does hold your interest and makes you think. I don't believe that any kids(under 12) would find this movie enjoyable-due to the fact it is kind of slow moving at points and the subject of infidality. It is a clean movie . Final thoughts--it is a good movie and does cover a good subject.",1386547200,14,1171,4.351598173515982
5731286,5,B00CNIDI5Q,YES!  Taken by grace is a very good movie with a different story line. It gets the message across in a way that the viewer will listen.,1386547200,,135,4.0
5731287,5,B00CNIDI5Q,"One of several from Pureflix that we have enjoyed without sex, nudity or foul language.  We continue to seek movies like this.",1386201600,,126,4.7272727272727275
5731288,4,B00CNIDI5Q,"The movie was well acted with an important theme.  Although it seemed to lag a bit in places, the movie overall was wonderfully put together.  While you know since it is brought to us by PureFlix that it is a Christian based movie, it is not one whose theme is in your face.  It is more thought provoking and a good one to watch with family and friends.  The discussion potential is great - making mistakes, forgiveness of others, forgiveness of oneself, marriage.  A solid movie and worth watching...",1384128000,13,501,4.584269662921348
5731289,3,B00CNIDI5Q,"This ""Christian"" movie fell into much of the secular movie stuff.  The wife wore clothing that exposed cleavage and gave a worldly appeal to the movie.  The message was good in that the man that was kidnapping the couple came to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, but the message was weak.  He was drinking throughout the movie and even at the end when the husband told the man that God had forgiven him.  This is not the gospel message in that one must repent and turn from sin to be forgiven.  The message at the end did say that the man became born again while serving another prison sentence.  So, it was made more clear, but could be easily missed if you didn't read the very last written message.  All in all, it was an okay movie.",1382140800,15,740,4.318840579710145
5731290,5,B00CNIDI5Q,Good movie.  Would recommend as a way to share you faith. A great movie on forgiveness. Could be shown for a youth group event.,1380672000,,127,4.291666666666667
5731291,4,B00CNIDI5Q,Good suspenseful Christian movie.  The acting was realistic and the topics addressed by their Christian faith were argued well from both a Christian and non-Christian perspective.,1380499200,,179,5.884615384615385
5731292,5,B00CNIDI5Q,A must see for any one that is struggling with there marriage and forgiveness. this movie shows you that you can work through any problem and learn to love and forgive.,1379980800,,168,4.451612903225806

5731295,5,B00CNIDI5Q,"This movie was well done with great actors...well, the 2 police officers were a lil' on the ""over acting"" side lol but all in all it was awesome.  I watched it with my family to review for something I was doing with the young women we serve in our ministry at Saving Grace in Rogers, AR [...] It's a wonderful story of forgiveness...but lots of action! wow!",1377993600,7,357,4.3283582089552235
5731296,4,B00CNIDI5Q,"Other than a couple of areas that had errors, the message is awesome. And I would recommend it to others to watch just for the message.",1377561600,,135,4.230769230769231

8583792,3,B00CNIDI5Q,The movies is pretty goo a little dragged out in some parts but is worth watching. Haylie duff did a spectacular job and if you are a fan definitely one to watch.
