8628002,5,B00GWRRYPY,"This is a very emotional film about a man that experience a brain stem stroke and ""locked-in"" syndrome.  I bought it because my husband faced the same scenario.  Thankfully my husband has recovered and is getting some of his speech and movement back.  The neurologists suggested I watch this movie to anticipate my husbands worst case scenario.  I'm so thankful we are not experiencing the worst case!",1523318400,,401,4.940298507462686
8628003,5,B00GWRRYPY,"The DVD I received is in French with English subtitles.  I understand some French, but that is hardly relevant to this movie, which was recommended to me my a friend in Ukraine.  The main figure in the films, whose POV (Point of View) persists throughout most of the movie,
has had some kind of stroke allowing him to think but not speak, he can blink yes or no.  I don't think that is a spoiler.  We don't find out when he had the CVA until the very end of the film.  We learn he was a high level editor of a fashion magazine, so he has very erotic thoughts when he finds out that his main therapists are female and pretty. He is some remote rehab center in Calais (once considered by the Germans as the main point of attack for Eisenhower's Armada).  It is peaceful there, few patients, and his two female therapists express enthusiasm about working with him. His wife basically dispenses with him on the phone after seeing his condition.  The film is about the process he goes through to adjust to a new kind of life, very different from what he has known.  Now he is middle aged and crippled, although his mind works as it did before the incident.

What we do discover is that any day something could happen to change our lives dramatically, and must ponder how we would deal with such a thing--as our main character must. How do you find meaning in life experienced mainly inside your head?  This is a good question--not answered here, but posited in a way that any Westerner can relate to.",1512000000,2,1495,4.403636363636363

8628009,5,B00GWRRYPY,"I'm showing this film in a college course I'm teaching this semester, ""Re-imagining Disability through Literature, Film and Media."" The brilliant way it was filmed puts us, the viewers, in the shoes of Bauby, that claustrophobic prison. We experience his world through his eyes and perspective. Terrific acting and cinematography. Stunning, riveting, poetic, heartbreaking, and ultimately inspiring portrayal of the human spirit.",1423353600,,429,5.935483870967742
