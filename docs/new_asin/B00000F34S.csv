7907776,4,B00000F34S,"For what it is (a no budget, B-movie), this is very well done. Death Driver tells the story of World Champion stunt driver Rex Randolph attempting to make a comeback 10 years after nearly losing his life. The production, stunts, and effects are all very good, but the acting...well, sometimes it is really bad. This isn't one of the better known Earl Owensby movies, but it is an easy and fun way way to kill 93 minutes.",1138233600,,420,4.467532467532467
