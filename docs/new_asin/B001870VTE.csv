3412027,5,B001870VTE,"I grew up on this cartoon back in Europe It's released by the same company that released Benny Hill so if you like one you're bound to love the other. There's no other cartoon like this in ANY SENSE, WAY, SHAPE OR FORM !!! Every episode starts out with a dark-voiced narrator telling you about the next creepy episode that is about to unfold while rain and thunder accompany the view of Dracula's [ or Duckula's ] Castle in the Transylvanian mountains. After that the story inside the castle unfolds which revolves around Igor and Nanny who after servicing many Counts of the Dracula bloodline made a mistake trying to resurrect their former master, accidentally adding Ketchup instead of Vampire's Blood, out comes Count Duckula - a good-hearted, vegetarian vampire lord with artistic ambitions and dreams of world-travel adventures. Igor keeps trying to sway his new Master to the dark-side, while the humongous and absent-minded Nanny keeps walking through walls and smashing up the castle which is constantly under repair while there are no funds to get it done for. Van Helsing [ or Van Goosewing, since this is a duck cartoon ] keeps trying his best to break into the castle and put an end to the vampire reign, completely oblivious and ignorant of the fact that his target is more scared of blood and killings than he is himself! Add more casualties into every 22 minutes long episode that always ends in ""blood-curtling screams"" [ for the most hilarious reasons ] while the narrator always says at the end: ""Good night out there WHATEVER YOU ARE, AAAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!"" - You will never see anything like this ever again but being tolerant of 1980's - 1990's British humor is a must Like I said, if you liked Benny Hill then this is a cartoon for you, unlike anything you've ever seen - I promise!!!",1386288000,,1805,4.751592356687898
3412028,5,B001870VTE,Having watched original series many years ago on T.V it is well worth the enjoyment of see this series again. the stories are funny with great wording. it is a great entertainer for all ages.,1370044800,,191,4.485714285714286
3412029,5,B001870VTE,"The complete series of Count Duckula.  It was worth the money, but I can only play it on my laptop, which I knew I knew ahead of time.  The discs that I got are region 0, but my DVD player is still unable to play them.  Thanks to the seller for the quick delivery.",1363392000,,264,3.8518518518518516

by the accolades of the masses
to repudiate the lack luster
fortunes of todays mediocrity and
to add to the plethora of applause
reuired to extend a glad hand.",1359158400,,189,4.757575757575758
3412031,5,B001870VTE,"This was the most underrated series.  The pros, it wasn't a 80's toy commerical.  Take a vampire Duck who is brought back to life through a spell, however instead of a blood transfusion he gets a Ketchup transfusion and becomes a Vegatarian.  Daffy was his own duck, Donald was his own duck, and so is Duckula.  Sadly this was a forgotten cartoon, but thanks to the internet and DVD it's back.  The cons is that only Season one was released in the US.  Now it's discontinued, the pros/cons is that you can buy this UK Region 2 version...but it'll only play on a computer DVD player.  So on a Laptop DVD, you can take the show anywhere.  And if you have your computer DVD hooked into your TV it'll play.  If you have an multi region DVD player it'll play.  If you have none of these than you're SOL.  Still great stories a Point A to B plot, awesome voice acting, great characters, no real DVD extra frills...unless you count a 10 minute interview about the show...but no real documentary.  All and All I'm happy, just wish I could play this on my US DVD.  In the meantime on my laptop.  And please be careful on taking the DVD's in and out they're tricky to say the last.",1358467200,5,1171,4.3119266055045875
3412032,5,B001870VTE,"Meant for intelligent children, this series should be enjoyed by intelligent adults looking for sharp humor without the dark edges.  As part of an exploration of the silly side of human nature, the characters are unforgettable.  The plots are more complex than is usual for cartoons of this kind and are always relentlessly funny.",1319328000,6,330,5.092592592592593
3412033,5,B001870VTE,This series is hilarious and also educational! KIDS AS WELL AS ADULTS WILL LOVE IT!!!!! Too bad it isn't available in US format! Guess I will have to make an investment!,1318118400,2,169,4.483870967741935

8268669,5,B001870VTE,"How does one describe DUCKULA? I'm guessing that either one must love this kind of humor, or find it a complete waste of time -- no in-between. Being among those who totally love it, I'm tickled hemoglobiny to have this on my shelf.

Luckily, I already had a player that handles either NTSC or PAL. I needed it for my Halas & Batchelor RUDDIGORE. Oddly, one thing that grabs me about DUCKULA is how the relationship between harmlessly wacky Count Duckula and his eager-for-villainy steward Igor seems almost to echo that between Sir Ruthven Murgatroyd and his steward Old Adam.

But there seems little sense in trying to describe or synopsize Count Duckula's surreally hilarious adventures with Igor, Nanny, and their globe-trotting castle. Try them -- especially if you like THE GOODIES, you may like these. If not, you can almost certainly find someone else who will.",1463356800,,869,4.904761904761905
8268670,5,B001870VTE,"I purchased this version the [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 0 Import - United Kingdom ] and it worked perfect on my Xbox One in America. Great show!!",1460678400,,146,4.25

8268676,5,B001870VTE,"Superb series! Hilarious and classic! I never got to watch all the episodes when they aired on Nickelodeon here in the states, now I own them all! I can't stop watching an episode once I start it's too funny. If you have a high IQ and a good sense of humor or if you just like British comedy then this would be for you. If you are a cartoon collector of any kind this is like a must have. I don't mind the price being a little steep because I understand it was an import and it's not available in a full collection like this any other way (As of writing October 2014). I like this series and Duckman , unrelated but just as funny to me. A series that has a tie in to this series is Danger Mouse, so any Danger Mouse fans might want to pick this up. Danger Mouse has an episode with Duckula in it, I forgot which one. Oh and the playback didn't prove to be a problem for me, I don't have a region 2 DVD player per se but I have a Pc that I watch all my DVD's on and it hooks up to my HD flat screen (HDMI port) and I just use VLC player to watch it. Works great I even downloaded an app on my phone that let's me kick back and use my phone as a remote control for VLC so it's just like watching it on any other home entertainment set up to me. I haven't looked at the special features yet , I didn't see any but I wasn't looking for them. Some people with ADD might find this series slow or boring due to a lot of dialogue carrying the show more than action but to that I say phooey I love it.",1412812800,2,1492,3.831715210355987
