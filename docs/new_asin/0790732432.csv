94466,5,0790732432,"I remember loving this movie when i was younger. i had a huge crush on Jennifer Love Hewitt at the time and so i saw it back in the day. still find it entertaining and a fun adventure. it's an older, milder version of american pie and other teen movies of current times",1358294400,,269,4.09433962264151

There are no extras, not even a preview. I don't care though. If this is something you have wanted, don't hesitate to purchase this nostalgic film.",1357257600,,297,4.4

94471,5,0790732432,"I'm so glad that WB have finally released this DVD of Trojan War, I remember seeing this on video in the 90s and it's still just as funny as it was the first time I saw it, I hope Warner keeps finding and releasing many more titles in the future.",1330992000,2,246,3.94
94472,5,0790732432,"This has been one of my favorite movies for many, many years. Although it is a predictable plot, everything seems right about it to capture that time. I was the same age of these characters in 1997, and it felt like a strange absurd version of life. Now, so many years later, it is a time capsule that I enjoy going back to ever so often. Back then Hewitt was my it girl, and this movie was one where she was a regular girl not some glam queen. The soundtrack became part of the soundtrack to my writing career. I owe a lot to this movie, maybe more than any other.",1322956800,,565,4.099099099099099
94473,4,0790732432,"Trojan War is a good flic.  It is definitely about the games people go thru to find their true love.  In the film, Brad played by Will Freidle is in love with an airheady/shallow girl played by Marley Shelton.  He can not see love right in front of his face with Leah played by J. Love Hewitt.  You have to be about 30 years old to truly understand what this movie is getting at.  It is not a great film but definitely worth seeing and very good.  It is not quite as good as Can't Hardly Wait (1998, also with Hewitt), American Pie (1999), or Take Me Home Tonight (2010) but it is up there with them in the late teen/early 20's genre of romantic comedies from the late 1990's.  The crux of the film in my opinion is that real love is about compatibility and moral values not just sex and the physical end of romance.  The cameo by Lee Majors as the town sherrif is also worth seeing for its comedic qualities.  One of Jennifer Love Hewitt's best films.",1313625600,,952,4.2154696132596685
94474,4,0790732432,"This is a simple feel good teen romantic comedy. Enjoyable. Just do not expect high drama. I own it on VHS, was so disappointed when it disappeared off Netflix some time back. So glad to see it on DVD, just ordered it! Great ending scene between the two protagonists.",1295136000,,267,4.469387755102041
94485,5,0790732432,Oh gosh!  We really loved this!  Took us back to when we were teenagers.  Really one of the funniest movies I've ever seen ;-),1258675200,,126,4.166666666666667
94486,5,0790732432,"This movie was brilliant, and marked by appearances by classic actors such as Lee Majors, as well as the lovely and endearing Jennifer Love Hewitt and the hysterical Will Friedel best known as Eric Matthews from boy meets world, compliments an average script, and along with slapstick comedy and brilliant directing, brings this cult classic masterpiece which has gone relatively unknown to a solid hit teenage film which would put most of the cliche teen drama/comedys of our generation to shame. Other reviews write this movie off as being cliche, what they fail to realize is that it was never cliche when this movie was made... great movies like this are what made it cliche.

Bring us a DVD soon, as I desperately need a new copy, and one brough up to the most recent technologies.",1183075200,2,786,4.779411764705882
94487,2,0790732432,"The Trojan War (1997) starts with a pretty good premise, even if it was stolen wholesale from 1987's ""Some Kind of Wonderful"". Semi-geek virgin, desperately in love with the schools unattainable beauty who has become disillusioned with popular guy she has been dating. Protagonist's gorgeous (anywhere but in this school) tomboyish best friend is secretly in love with him? Cut to climatic party scene at which all this is sorted out.

Unfortunately they stole only the premise and not the actual script (or the cast who would have been too old anyway), so the production falls far short of its predecessor. It also falls far short of its 1998 successor ""Can't Hardly Wait"", also featuring Jennifer Love Hewitt-this time as the unattainable beauty. In fact the writers of that film appear to have taken the script from ""The Trojan War"" and re- written it for an audience with IQ's about 30 points higher. So my advice (unless you are a mega JLH fan) would be to stick with the predecessor and the successor and leave ""The Trojan War"" for its intended audience of wiggers and drones. The soundtrack is much better in those two films as well.

""The Trojan War"" was pulled from its scheduled 1997 theatrical release because of poor projected audience numbers and filed away in the hope that Jennifer Love Hewitt's skyrocketing popularity (insert ""Can't Hardly Wait"", ""Party of Five"", and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" here) would change the equation and justify the promotional expense of releasing the movie. Even that was not enough for distributors to take a chance on the film and after a year of deliberation it went direct to video. And even with Hewitt's continued success in ""Ghost Whisperer"", the sales projections for a DVD release of ""The Trojan War"" has not excited anyone in the industry.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1179100800,2,1849,4.826498422712934
94488,4,0790732432,"I have seen it before on regular tv, one of those sunday afternoon things.  I thought it was pretty good, but I also like JLH as well, and feel she wasn't in the movie enough.  Thats my opinion though.  Still, it was a good, goofy movie about teens and love.  Pretty typical story line and was predictable, but how can one assume its not with the actors/actresses that are in it.",1177545600,,379,4.295774647887324

94490,3,0790732432,"Trojan war is an average teenage movie, and has a pretty positive message to it aboout safe sex. Even though it seems like a giant ad for Trojan condoms, it still has some charm.",1115078400,2,178,4.264705882352941
94491,5,0790732432,"This is the story of too many boys in the world... everybody wants to be whit the most beautifull girl in the universe (or in the school), but we don't know that she is next to us... well this movie teach that in a very fun way, and however, it's a great comedy movie. It makes my laugh and cry. It's the best movie in the history!",1090627200,12,331,3.955223880597015
94492,1,0790732432,"This movie is awful. Possibly one of the worst I've endured in quite a while.
Terrible plot, clich acting and quite possibly the lamest script ever. It's like the directors decided to purposefully go about rendering the viewer an official retard by killing off all remaining brain cells.
One step up from Americas Unfunniest Home Videos, the part where this 'story' was (un)successfully made into a released movie fit for human consumption is beyond me. This movie puts the art of directing, script writing, acting and comedy to uttermost shame. The script reads like it was written by a three year old. On crack.
To conclude this little tirade, don't watch/buy/steal this movie. It might kill you.",1073088000,,698,4.9743589743589745
94493,4,0790732432,"I originally saw it as a trailer that to a movie I can't remember, but it left me thinking if it was a good movie.  When I finally got a chance to watch it for the first time, it turns out that it is.  And here's why:  I was laughing throughout the whole film where Will Friedle's character fall in love with a beautiful high school studymate Brooke (Marley Shelton).  And when it come down to the moment:  he has to get a condom, where it turn into a nightmare for him.  Not to mention he doesn't know that his best friend Leah (Jennifer Love Hewitt) has a crush on him.
It's amazing to watch this film because it hard to believe that Hewitt was so young doing this movie, and she did a great job with her role.  And it's neat to see Wendie Malick (""Just Shoot Me"") as Freidle's mom, Danny Masterson (""That's 70's Show"") as Friedle's best friend and Kathy Griffin (who plays a convience store clerk) in it too.",1044576000,,911,4.23121387283237
94494,4,0790732432,"I got to tell you, it was funny seeing that guy get banged around everywhere, what a ...! He was a terrible actor, can't act worth beans. Again, the movie savour is JLH again! How many movies can she save? She's just awesome! Especially the part where she immatates the other girl! Anyways, if you like to see that guy being banged around alot, this is a good movie, if you actually like this guy, well, I feel sorry for you, the only thing that saved this movie was JLH and the funny bad guys. Who were one of the most different bad guys I've ever seen! This is a good movie, rent it or if you can find it anywhere but here, buy it!!",1030406400,,634,4.08
94505,5,0790732432,"Every rather formulaic adolescent comedic love story has the potential to fall into the mire of tastelessness and brash humor, but Trojan War rises to the top of the movies in this genre.  Of course, the fact that Jennifer Love Hewitt, the most gorgeous woman on the planet, is in the movie also helps it a great deal.  Were it not for JLH, I would never have bought this movie (I had never even heard of it until I started searching for JLH films).  The fact is, though, that this movie is pretty good on its own merits.  Brad is just a regular guy head over heels over a fairly stereotypical blonde, and he finds himself one item short of making his fantasies come true.  So begins an unbelievably wild series of events in the pursuit of ""protection.""  A quick trip to the convenience store results in the theft of his father's jaguar (and his wallet), a trip to the police station to report the theft, a wild ride with a bus driver who has encountered one too many folks without exact change, a trip to a Spanish bar where a large Spanish woman puts the moves on him, a wild ride with the guys who stole his car, etc.  Much more happens, but you get the idea.  Meanwhile, his best friend Leah (JLH) is agonizing over the fact that Brad is lusting after a shallow blonde and is quite unaware of her own interest in him.  While the ending is fairly predictable, it still manages to be satisfying and uplifting.
The acting in this movie is quite good all around.  Of course, the action centers on Brad and his seemingly endless quest; that quest changes dramatically before the night is through, when he finally figures out what he should have been looking for all along.  Hewitt doesn't have enough scenes to satisfy me, but she is terrific.  There are also some interesting cameos in the movie--e.g., I knew the bus driver looked familiar, but it was not until the ending credits that I discovered it was Anthony Michael Hall of 1980s fame.  I would also note the fact that there is one tiny scene after the ending credits roll, so don't hit stop and rewind too quickly if you want to see the entire movie.  I guess the PG-13 rating is explained by the presence of some cursing in the movie (as well as the whole ""protection"" issue), but I think this is a movie parents will have no qualms about letting their younger teenagers watch.",1022889600,5,2336,4.4402810304449645
94506,4,0790732432,"I am a avid movie-aholic.  I have seen nearly any movie you can name, but this is one of the wittiest, sharpest, and most original coming of age comedies I've ever had the pleasure of sitting through.  Will Freidle is hilarious as the boy  (Brad) whos just looking for one night with the girl of his dreams.  Everything that could possibly go wrong, does.  Also, Jennifer Love Hewitt is witty and very easy to sympathize with as the girl who wishes she was the girl of Brads dreams.  Her character is both tough and vulnerable and very well portrayed.  If you look closely you will also see Hyde from that 70's show and Nina from NBC's hit series JUST SHOOT ME.",1000684800,,661,4.413223140495868
94507,3,0790732432,"""Trojan War"" isn't the worst teenie film ever made, but the characters are one dimensional, except for Jennifer Love Hewitt's Leah! Her one stupid line she punishes herself for. Will Friedle should go back to ""Boy Meets World"" because he  has no presence in this film. None at all! It takes his character Brad the whole film to realize he should dump the sexpot Brooke, whom he is obsessed about, for Leah, who has all the qualities he is looking for. He actually registers shock and disappointment when all Brooke wants from him is SEX! Duh! Which makes Leah's continued pining for him really hard to take. There are two teenaged bozos who are constantly getting slapped in the face as a running gag. The other gag is that Sheriff Austin is played by Lee Majors (Steve Austin, get it....never mind.) The only ""guy"" with a brain in his head is the actor who played Jerry Horne on ""Twin Peaks"".He plays a street person who slaps Brad across the face, and says ""Stop dreaming... Open your eyes, you doofus! I can only say that it should have happened earlier in the movie! Jennifer Love Hewitt looks great in a white mini dress and black ankle boots, but she should have dressed like that earlier in the movie to get Brad's attention. She should have realized that Brad was a teenaged boy who will drool over any other mini dress clad babe if Leah isn't willing to do that. Leah's credo is: ""I don't need to impress high school boys!"" (Right Leah, but then you won't get noticed either!)",992736000,,1485,4.541044776119403

94509,2,0790732432,"HIGHLY overrated movie. The presence of Will Freidle is what kills this  movie. He's bad in Boy Meets World and he's even worse as the star of this  film. The only redeeming factor is Jennifer Love Hewitt, who as always  stands out amongst crowds. Maybe it's because I watched Overnight Delivery  right before checking this movie out but the two are very very similar,  complete with matching humvees by the lead females. Oy.",968803200,,425,4.767123287671233
94510,3,0790732432,"Will Friedle has wondeful potential as both a comedic and serious actor. Though this movie is predictible, corny, and a bit unrealistic, it is carried well by it's writing (I love the crayola crayon speech) and cast of  cool side characters (including Jason Marsden and Danny Masterson who are  among my long time favorites). Definately good for a laugh, and some sappy  romance, if not much more than that.",957744000,,407,4.869565217391305

94512,5,0790732432,"This movie is a hilarious, non-stop laugh and cry teenage movie that 13-17 year olds will love!
It all starts with Brad (Will Friedle) who has the hots for the girl of his dreams, Brooke, the girl who will 'rock his world'  and who is  also unfortunately the girl who'll he'll never have a chance  with and he knows it. But as he strains for success while 'studying' with  her that one dreamful night he finds that he hasn't got the one thing that  he needs at that moment in his life . . . . A CONDOM, what ensues is a  great search and eventual pilgramage for one so he can FINALLY score with  the girl of dreams, this leads Brad to being chased by the same cop three  times, being caught in a robbery and taken hostage, being stalked by a  determined and psychopathic Mexican woman, having his Dad's legendary 1967  Jaguar GT being completely wrecked in a car chase shown on National  American Television and a  trojan war between Brad (Friedle) and Scott,  Brooke's boyfriend!
This movie is a roller coaster ride which will  bring you tears of laughter and tears of sadness towards the end as Leah  (the always GEORGOUS Jennifer Love Hewitt) has her heart secretly broken by  her best friend Brad (Friedle).  The movie is the story in where Brad  searches for a condom, and eventually, TRUE LOVE. It also has good acting,  a funny, witty script and a GREAT soundtrack.
