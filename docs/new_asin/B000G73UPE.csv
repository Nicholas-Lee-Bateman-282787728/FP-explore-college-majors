2601874,2,B000G73UPE,"I want to begin by saying the video itself is very good!  My son loves it and watches it often.  However, as a consumer I was disappointed because when I purchased it I was under the assumption that it would have at least one cartoon on it related to the picture displayed on your website. The cover is shown with zoo animals.  The dvd I received says volume one but has a completely different cover on it and no cartoons related to zoo animals. I think this should be looked into and corrected.  I would not have purchased this particular dvd if I had known it would be different than what is displayed on the amazon website. This borders on false advertisement!!!",1203724800,3,665,4.426229508196721
2601875,4,B000G73UPE,My review is from only seeing the first cartoon Ho Ho Horrors. I haven't played the full disc yet and will soon as I really love T&J. For somebody that grew up with the original version this is a bit different from what I expected but still good. All the fun is still there although it seems they took the mild violence out and made the cartoons more PC for young kids of today. For example in the first cartoon they brought back Mammy Two Shoes as a white woman (instead of black) & call her Mrs Two Shoes. That was a bit of a shock but understandable for todays generation. I'll agree with the other reviwers that young kids (and older cartoon loving folks like me) will like this new version of T&J. It's good...,1202169600,5,715,4.264705882352941

2601889,5,B000G73UPE,"A couple months ago I picked up ""Tom and Jerry's Greatest Chases,"" a DVD collection of movie cartoons from the 40s through 60s. They were fun to watch and brought back good memories from my childhood. One of the reasons I bought them was not for me, but for my little boy (3 1/2). Well, at first I thought the humor might be too advanced, but he watched them intensely and now and then you'd hear a good chortle. I supposed that if I put them away for a few years and then brought them back, they might be even funnier. These cartoon were made, after all, for older children and adults and to be viewed in movie theaters,

Well, I was later going over the $5 DVD rack at a nearby Wal-Mart, and found ""Tom and Jerry Tales, Vol. 1,"" a much later set of 10 cartoons made especially  for a children's TV program. That might be more suitable, or so I thought. Well, they're quite good cartoons and my little boy gets a big kick out of them, no doubt. They're really very much like the original stories but  supposedly much more on the children's level of humor and understanding. Well, you couldn't prove it by me, but I don't view cartoons closely enough to notice much of any difference. The newer ones look much brighter and the colors are much more vivid. The drawings and characters are very similar, but there's a little difference in the way that motions are depicted. The new cartoons are much more even in their production values, as opposed to wide differences in the old set which was filmed over several decades. They're very fine cartoons and, I'm sure, anyone who enjoyed the original T & J cartoons would enjoy these. They're all new stories but share the typical characters, chases, very visual humor and, yes, violence. It strikes me that there's more dialog in these newer cartoons and I'd approve. It may aid the little guy in gaining language skills. It's a good set of cartoons. I'm very pleased.

2601890,5,B000G73UPE,"This collection of the new Tom and Jerry is entertaining. It may not be like the original Tom and Jerry series, but it has it's own comedic qualities. I purchased this DVD for my 3 yr. old son and he loves it. He can watch it over and over. However, we enjoy watching it with him too! I think you will enjoy it and be pleasantly surprised as long as you don't go into it comparing it to the original series.",1324425600,2,407,4.037037037037037
2601891,1,B000G73UPE,"Anyone who has anything good to say about the Tom & Jerry ""Tales"" series (all volumes) is great has not watched the original Tom and Jerry anmiations!
This new animation is horrible. It has an odd jerky motion as compared to the smooth natural anmiation of the old cartoons.
And to add insult to injury the screenplay and script is terrible. There is nothing to laugh about or funny about it.

See the Tom and Jerry ""Spotlight Collection"" instead. That is what the real Tom and Jerry is.",1271548800,2,487,4.534090909090909

Not as good as the classic Tom and Jerry but since only a limited number of classics are shown on TV and we've seen them all many times the novelty of the cartoons on this DVD made it worthwhile.  But if you are looking for good old Tom and Jerry, this is not it.",1231286400,13,409,3.891566265060241
2601899,4,B000G73UPE,"There's plenty of reviews here happily reporting ""my kids/grandkids love these.""  So here's an opinion from an adult who grew up on the classic Tom & Jerry shorts of the 1940's and 50's.  I was really concerned that these new cartoons would bear no resemblance to the older ones.  After all, modern-day incarnations of Looney Tunes, Scooby Doo, Popeye, and many others are hard for us classic animation fans to watch.  But I'm happy to report that Tom & Jerry Tales actually retains the spirit of the original Hannah-Barbera shorts.  Sure, the animation has a slightly more contemporary look, with regard to shading of the characters.  But it's not nearly as grating as the three-dimensional effects most hand-drawn animation goes for these days.  Most importantly, the action and sense of fun are still there.  I wasn't surprised to find the violence toned down a bit (unlike the original theatrical shorts, these cartoons ARE aimed at children), but poor ol' Tom still gets pounded with regularity.

We adults who still enjoy cartoons are fortunate that so many Golden Age shorts are now available.  But if you're itching to try something new that honors the cartoons you grew up with, give this one a try.  I know I'll be buying the rest of the volumes in this series.  No, they'll never replace the Tom & Jerry of the Good Ol' Days. . .but these well-made cartoons are the closest we'll ever come to seeing animation like that again.",1206230400,39,1437,4.796747967479675
