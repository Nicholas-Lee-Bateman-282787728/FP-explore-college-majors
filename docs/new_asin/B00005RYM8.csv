7953102,5,B00005RYM8,"I found this dvd title by sheer chance when I was mistakenly looking for a film starring Jennifer Hammon, who isn't in this, but it was highly recommended, and even though I do not tend to take much notice of other reviews, (how do they know what I'm going to like?, and maybe anyone reading this should ignore this!), I was instantly intrigued by firstly, the cover, secondly, the plot sounded reasonable and the actresses in it appeared nude a lot and my instincts responded very favourably.
The only down side was the price I would have to pay, but I am no stranger to buying rare or out of print dvd titles, I have about half a dozen already, and one was very expensive, but worth it.  This had a $50 + (about 30) price tag, but I was willing to give it a chance.
I am glad I did.
This is for me one of the better so called adult films out there and I am not surprised it is one of those rarities, since films like this usually are, but that can only be good for them.  It magnifies their reputation in a way, much like films which bomb at the box office for example, but enjoy a life on dvd or now blu ray of course much later on when they are finally appreciated for the great works they are.
Firstly, the actresses involved were all delicious, two designed to be the more antagonistic and scheming types and one a nicer one, who is herself not short of sex appeal and capable of seduction herself, she's the blonde, played by Tracy Smith.  There is a lot of deception and scheming and secrets going on in the mix and between plot moments, (there has to be some), there are some really sexy scenes of seduction and game playing.  Some of the angles and shots were pretty decent too, dare I say, original, like one under the pool with the maid, played by ravishing and scrumptious brunette, Nancy O'Brien, who is the primary schemer, you will know what I mean when and if you see it.
I bought this a couple of days ago and I have already seen it twice and will again.
One other thing that I noticed on the other reviews, which also had me intrigued and in fact, almost put me off, but only almost!  They talked about the ending, which many said was silly and anticlimactic, and then I saw it for myself.  I couldn't help but be quite amused by it actually.  Obviously, I will not say what it is, but in all honesty, I like it when they do things like that; it does leave it open, granted, it may feel a bit anticlimactic to some, granted, but being a writer myself, (published, but lacking a massive hit as yet), I can fully understand and appreciate what they were doing.  It reminded me of endings like with The Thing, when the possibilities are left open and it's up to the audience to decide.  Hey, not that I am comparing The Thing to Web of Seduction, or maybe with the similar ending, I am, but only in terms of leaving things open, the writer must have thought, well, no matter what I do here, it's not going to be satisfying or something else needs to happen here, but to hell with it, what does it matter?  Just let it end where it is and let it be a kind of cliff hanger.  I appreciated that, and it certainly didn't ruin the film, if anything, it made me laugh and it was kind of appropriate to all that had gone before.
All I am saying is, three gorgeous young women, a brunette, a blonde and a redhead as well with a great pair of legs, some provocative, sexy scenes of seduction, striptease, delightful dollops of sexy nudity with all three, and a lot of scheming and deception and possible murder and women even getting it on with each other, what do I care if the ending decides to be a bit of an attempt at a cliff hanger?  I basically got what I paid for, and with other films that dare to leave things open, I think that takes a lot of courage, to be frank, even though you know you might get criticized and busted for it.  I say well done to writer/director Blain Brown.  Of course, there are your endings which do leave things where they shouldn't and do feel like total anti-climaxes, but I don't think this is one of them.  I for one recommend this highly.
If you want a sexy adult film and you want some beautiful women to entertain you for an evening, this is your movie, even if it does cost the price of three cinema tickets!",1381708800,,4258,4.2330456226880395
7953103,4,B00005RYM8,"You watch enough of these unrated softcore erotic movies and they seem to run together. This particular film, while not exceptional, was above average, mostly because of the quality of the lead female participants. That seems to be one of the advantages of picking out Playboy/Image productions. They do know how to find the good looking shapely babes.

Cast:

Lauren Hays .... Simone

Eric Acsell .... Damon

Tracy Smith .... Jenni

Stephan Camus Gerard

Michael George Stan

Nancy O'Brien .... Brandy

The Plot

Simone's husband, Gerard, is a wealthy philanthropist with a heart condition. Gerard is worried what Simone would do with the family art collection, if something should happen to him, so he tasks his attorney Damon, to prepare a Power of Attorney, with Damon as the executor. When Simone finds out she is furious and plots with Jenni, the philandering Damon's wife to murder each others husband.

The Story

Jenni is a frustrated wife. Try as she might, she cannot get Damon interested in sex anymore, (In their only sex scene together, he sat in a dining room chair wearing his suitcoat.) while Damon is suspiciously working nights at his law office on a big case.

Damon and Jenni are temporarily living in Gerard's guest house, while their new home is under construction. Simone is a hot number who craves action, which doesn't really interest Gerard. She is not above cheating on her husband and does so with Stan, her personal trainer and friend of Brandy. Brandy was hired by Damon to help Jenni with the housework but her main purpose seems to stir up trouble. It is in fact, Brandy that makes sure that Simone sees the Power of Attorney and nudges Simone and Jenni towards plotting their husband's demise.

Conclusion

The story was a bit cheesy and the acting was little better than average but those are the only things I can complain about. Tracy Smith was probably the hottest number but Lauren Hays and Nancy O'Brien were also worthy of praise. Though none were slouches, the red headed, Hays seemed to have the best pure body. These were the only girls that took it off but they took it all off and showed everything they had, so who needs more.

Oh there is one more thing to complain about. In half or more of the sex scenes, the men left all or most of their clothes on. If both parties had clothes on it wouldn't have seemed so strange but they didn't. The guys had clothes while the girls were naked. For those interested, the sex scenes were primarily straight with no S&M or bondage. There was one lesbian scene, if I remember right and two wild female masturbation scenes.

7953105,5,B00005RYM8,"Other's reviews have really helped me make better selections. I want to thank those who have spent the time sharing their thoughts, a MAJOR Amazon advantage over their competition.

----------------------------------------------------------------

In most movies you want the credits (studio/actor names) to pass by, and get on with the movie. Best opening scene ever!? She will absorb your total attention. A pretty good storyline, but you keep seeing some really nice bodies and wish they would disrobe more frequently for longer periods. This is what will keep you glued to the TV until the end. Unfortunately I forgot the review that said Unrated not the heavily edited R.",1110153600,,676,5.367924528301887
7953106,3,B00005RYM8,"The three lead actresses in this bland Hitchcockian soft-core, flesh extravaganza are Tracy Ryan(blonde), Nancy O'Brien (brunette), and Lauren Hays(redhead).  Now then, they each show quite a lot of skin in this movie, but only Tracy Ryan seems interested in sustaining the interest of the audience when the lenses are not fogged over from all the steamy sequences.  The idea that any man would cheat on Tracy Ryan, a bona-fide knockout with a gorgeous smile and a killer figure, borders on the realm of impossibility.  However, Nancy O'Brien is certainly provocative enough for second thoughts, so this is not entirely unforgivable.  But to cheat on Tracy with a noise-making female like Nancy O'Brien, while Tracy is downstairs having a glass of champagne, is just asking to be caught.  Of course, the guy then lingers in the bedroom until his wife (Tracy) finds him alone and somehow assumes he just had a woman there(how intuitive). Still, this guy's pretty stupid for a high-priced lawyer.  He doesn't deny anything.  Then there was that other brunette at the party who had zero dialogue but was absolutely beautiful.  She looked like a busty Phoebe Cates with long dark curls.  Youch!  She could have shown up on the doorstep selling Amway or something; then some more gratuitous hanky-panky could have ensued. Alas. The hot scenes that are here are memorable and the women look and act amazing!  However, these same scenes would have been more believable if the guys had taken off their pants.  There are three different scenes that leap to mind where the guys leave them on.  Maybe they were getting lap-dances from the actresses?  Not that I wanted to see the guys, mind you, but if everybody is naked it is much easier to suspend disbelief.  Whenever there is a dull moment (i.e. there is no skin-on-skin-happening) the movie is incredibly boring.  I was laughing out loud at the final, climactic scene, which ended up being rather anti-climactic and abrupt.  It was filled with film noir melodrama and I couldn't help thinking aloud, ""Who cares?!""  If all you want from a soft core film are yummy females showing off their fantastic birthday suits, then this film is for you.  If you want a story in addition to the latter suggestion check out ""The Key to Sex (unrated)"" for a scorcher of a film with acting, humor, and all the delicious females any man could want to see.  Even ""Night Calls: the movie 2"" had both lovely females and a decent, often hilarious storyline.  I spent too much money to get ""Web of Seduction"" after reading all the positive reviews here, and I was disappointed overall.  There are better soft core films available.  Not Recommended.",1105747200,21,2671,4.860619469026549
7953107,5,B00005RYM8,"In this softcore offering from Playboy/Image, the main story borrows a bit from Hitchcock's ""Strangers on a Train"". Two women (Tracy Ryan and Lauren Hays) who are fed up with their husbands decide (with the help a recently hired maid, Nancy O'Brien) to kill each other's significant other. That way the cops will never be able to connect either of them to the murders. Of course this will never work, because there are lots of very obvious things that would connect them to the murders. Like, maybe the fact that Tracy and her husband are living in the other couple's guest house at the time? Also, I don't think the writer thought out the story too much, because it has the lamest, most anticlimactic ending ever.

But what this movie lacks in originality and logic, it more than makes up for with some scorching hot sex scenes. There are ten scenes spread evenly from start to finish in the movie's ninety minute running time. Five are boy/girl, three are girl solo, one is girl/girl, and one is boy/girl/girl. Only the three women mentioned above participate in the sex scenes, but that's just fine, because all three are super hot and give great performances. Tracy and Lauren's masturbation scenes are incredibly good and very explicit. And I have to make special mention of the lesbian scene between Tracy and Nancy. It was basically just Tracy having a two minute orgasm.

The only criticism I have is the scene where Lauren has sex with Tracy's husband. He leaves his pants on through the whole thing. I'm sure we were supposed to assume that he had them unzipped in the front, but it looked like they were just on. It was probably supposed to make the scene ""sexier"", but it was kind of lame.

But overall, I strongly recommend this one.",1095552000,7,1746,4.662337662337662
7953108,5,B00005RYM8,"It is not as explicit as some of the penthouse stuff, but it shows very full frontal nudity with some amazingly beautiful women.

The story is surprisingly good, too, and so is the acting.  The story is paced very well so that the sex scenes are built up very well (one thing nice about when soft core porn is done RIGHT), and the sex scense are very hot, and don't use the same shot spliced together over and over or closeups on the guy's face.

The women are perfect, the scense are perfect, and the story does not get in the way; I only wish they had shown softcore porn this good on skinemax when I was thirteen.",1092355200,4,616,4.203389830508475
