8344236,2,B001ULDK2I,"I watched this movie last night 3/10/10 First, their is the suggestion of nudity, from the cover art, their is NO nudity in this movie. Second, you are lead to believe this is a bondage movie, well they do tie up the two victims, although how that is done is a mystery, the women victims both over 50 yrs old, one a black woman must be 200lbs, at least 3 times the size of the perpetrator but she just appears in different tied positions, and you have to use your imagination as to what happens because they cut away from any abuse.  It's a politically corrected versions of a murder-revenge movie.  It's not the lack of nudity, that makes this such a bad movie, hell the victims being nude might have caused viewers to go blind.  What makes me mad is this movies cover is designed to sucker buyers in and the story description sound like it has potential, I enjoy a good revenge story and I like independent films because you can never know what turn they might take, they can kill off the main actor half way through the movie and you never see it coming. This piece of trash is nothing but a rip-off.  And the acting? ""we don't need no sticking actors"", we have wanabees.  The twelve dollars I paid for this video has probably given the studio a One hundred percent profit already, luckily, I haven't sighted in my new shotgun yet, so this disk will still get some use from my skeet thrower.",1268265600,,1394,4.366795366795367
