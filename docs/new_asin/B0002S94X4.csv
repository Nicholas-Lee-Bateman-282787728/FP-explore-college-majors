2116687,5,B0002S94X4,"That amazing cast that we saw in Cycle 1 are all back, but now the writing staff has their act together as a unit and the show is cranking out good, solid, structured satire to go with the wonderful impressions and the ever-present surrealism.  These were the most even, most laugh-packed shows and also the most incredible ones, pound for pound.

When this hits a peak, the highest points are unlike anyone else's comedy, and really incredible - Floyd the Barber asking Godfather Cabellero for a favor, Bill Needle trashing Libby Wolfson's play on-air, the Russian television parodies ... the level of imagination is so high.  It's a peak in modern comedy, for sure.  The show was always great in places, but at this point it was at its greatest and most consistently funny.",1099353600,7,775,4.7611940298507465

2116690,5,B0002S94X4,"I remember hoisting beers and watching SCTV late at night with a good friend of mine.

Although we were also fans of SNL, SCTV was just more....intelligent.  The show was riddled with subtleties that illustrated how well-crafted the program was.

This is the second set of DVD's released for the show and so far, this set is just as good, if not better, than the first.  Rather then repeat what earlier reviews have already stated there is a lot of good stuff here and many of the most famous sketches.  However, I'm still waiting for the episode where Guy tumbles down hundreds of staircases trying to escape (if I recall correctly) a restaurant located at the top of a nuclear reactor that is about to go critical.  After tumbling to the bottom, he stands up and says something like ""that was quite a tumble"".  It has to be seen to be appreciated.  (I don't think this episode is in this collection).

There are some good extras on the DVD's but again, oddly, Rick Moranis did not seem to take part in any of the commentaries.  I found this very noticeable.

At some point I hope they release the 30 minutes episodes that ran prior to the 90 minute episodes currently being released.  The 30 minute episodes were, in some ways, better especially the skits with Harold Ramis; but they also lacked some of the continuity of the 90 minutes shows.

SCTV was intelligent, well-crafted comedy and it continues to be a joy to see these episodes again after all of these years.",1098230400,8,1471,4.568702290076335

The original SCTV 90 minute broadcasts are responsible for shaping my sense of humor and thank God because it could have been a great many other, less-intelligent things!

2116694,5,B0002S94X4,"""SCTV Cycle 2"" features some of the most inspired episodes in the SCTV canon. As much as you'll hear the actors and writers complain about how hard it was to fill out the 90-minute format, the work here shows how rewarding and timeless and flat-out hilarious those long-form shows could be.

 When a mammoth Soviet satellite infringes on the tiny SCTV orbiter (complete with hot dog rotisserie), the network is taken over by CCCP1, or ""3CP1 on your dial, Russian Television."" The Russian TV parodies that follow are savagely funny. Watch especially for ""What Fits into Russia,"" ""Hey, Giorgi,"" and Russia's favorite game show ""Uposcrabblenyk.""

 Self-absorbed host of the ironically titled ""You!"" show, Libby Wolfson makes her stage debut in ... deep breath ... ""I'm Taking My Own Head, Screwing It On Right And No Guy's Gonna Tell Me That It Ain't.""

 The classic Godfather parody show is here, with Guy Caballero as the Don. How many bullets can that guy take anyway? And never tell anyone outside the family that your favorite sport is soccer.

2116706,5,B0002S94X4,"I had originally become hooked with SCTV when its early Toronto years were in Rhodes Syndication, broadcast in the late 70's, usually around Midnight. Followed it to NBC, which never really knew what to do with it. This tremendous ensemble group is just about the best satirical comedy group I have ever seen. SNL groupies may argue their team, but, gang, give credit where it's due. SCTV had more energy, imagination, and just plain funnier characters that truly made us watch and hold our sides with laughter. I won't delve into more details about the characters, as it has been discussed in other reviews here, but, suffice to say, that, on Disc 4 of this set, ""The SCTV Staff Christmas Party"" has one of the best imitations of Liberace (Dave Thomas) and Elton John (Rick Moranis) in dueling pianos I have ever seen in my life. Side-splittingly funny. Also John Candy as Orson Welles, Andrea Martin as Ethel Merman. Imitations aside, the characters established, such as Guy Caballero, station owner sleazebag in a wheelchair for ""respect"", the hoser idiot MacKenzie Brothers (""take off eh""), Sammy Maudlin, loser stand up wannabe whose act is as tarnished as the multitude of gold chains around his neck; Dr, Tongue and Bruno (Woody Tobias Jr.). I could go on and on. I have all the sets of this wonderful show,  but wanted to review this set, especially recommending the ""Staff Christmas Party"".

2116711,5,B0002S94X4,"Having just received my copy of season 4 the previous month, and this set today, I immediately set out to write this review.  I speak as a hardcore fan but also as a severe critic of comedy when I say that this is as close to perfection as comedy has ever got.

The skits are nothing if not genius pulled out of thin air--""The Godfather"" (also starring John Marley who reprises his roll as 'Woltz' [albeit re-named]}, ""Money Talks"", ""The Fishin' Musician w/ The Plasmatics"", ""The Christmas Show"", ""3D House Of Beef"".... this is really the tip of the iceberg.

Perhaps the most brilliant of the wraparounds is here in the second NBC set--""The Russian Show""--an amazingly tight parody of low-rent Soviet production values on what's already a cheap network (dig the new 'Soviet Minicam').

The extras aren't bad; 'SCTV Remembers' with Joe and Eugene includes portions of a sketch from the earlier Canadian shows with Harold Ramis (""Madame Blitzman""), but is mostly a bit of fluff.

The commentary done by Andrea and Catherine on the ""Christmas Show"" is a lot of fun--note to Shout (or whoever will be taking care of the remaining seasons); more of these talented ladies, please.

SNL, Fawlty Towers, or SCTV; whatever your personal preference, this is a must-own set.  Make your own Christmas a hell of a lot brighter and chuck this in your shopping cart.",1133913600,7,1352,4.801724137931035
2116712,4,B0002S94X4,"This set features some great moments from SCTV history. Of the shows presented here, I am particularly fond of ""Zontar,"" ""CCCP 1,"" and ""The Godfather."" Catherine O'Hara and Andrea Martin steal the show, with any appearance by Perini Scleroso, Mrs. Falbo, or Edith Prickley being comedy gold. ""The Great White North"" and Guy Caballero's rants are particularly entertaining here as are Count Floyd and Dr. Tongue (especially in ""Dr. Tongue's Evil House of Pancakes."") As brilliant as I think Eugene Levy is, I still don't enjoy the Sammy Maudlin bits, which are formulaic and un-funny compared to the rest of the show.

Although some of the humor is a bit dated now (as many there are numerous references to then-current events that younger viewers may not grasp), this is still a wonderful and very funny set of DVDs, which I recommend.",1116547200,12,835,4.921985815602837
2116713,5,B0002S94X4,"SCTV Volume 2 offers some of the very best sketches from one of TV's funniest shows.

I'm not an expert on SCTV. I don't quite understand the show's on-again off-again history. All I know is that I started watching it as a kid on NBC and got hooked. For the last 15 years I've tried to record the show as much as possible but sadly the opportunities have been few. I only could get the 30 minute trimmed down versions on late night NBC.

Now, the dvd sets offer the original and complete (except for some music) NBC shows. Watching both Volumes 1 & 2, I've already seen hours of additional material that was not included in the 30 minute shows.

Volume 2 also includes my favorite episode, ""CCCP 1"" which provides a hilarious scenario of the Soviets pirating SCTV's signal and supplying it's own special programming, such as ""Tibor's Tractor"" (a Soviet version of ""Mr. Ed""), ""Today is Moscow"" (a Soviet style coffee talk show), and a public service announcement deriding Uzbeks (""they are the weak link in the great chain of socialism"").

Other great sketches in Volume 2 include: ""The Godfather"" spoof with SCTV President Guy Caballero declaring network war on the heads of the 4 networks; Bobby Bittman and his brother Skip on the Sammy Maudlin Show; the Plasmatics on the ""Fishin' Musician""; the Plastics on ""Midnight Video Special"" and the SCTV staff Christmas party featuring many of SCTV's best characters such as Gerry Todd, the Boils, Johnny La Rue, and Mayor Tommy Shanks. The X-Mas show also includes the deeply disturbing ""Dusty Towne's Sexy Holiday Special.""

If you are even a casual fan of SCTV, I highly recommend SCTV Volume 2.",1108339200,10,1643,4.750877192982456
2116714,5,B0002S94X4,"If you own the first SCTV box, you'll be glad to know of some navigation improvements found in the second. Specifically, each show has a title (instead of an episode number), and the chapters are labeled by skit, song, or wraparound piece (unlike the first box, which just says ""Chapter 1, Chapter 2"" etc).

The shows offered on Volume 2 are more consistant, with less filler from the old syndicated shows, and you can tell that the writers were really getting a handle on the 90-minute format. Classic wraparounds found in Vol. 2 include  ""CCCP1,"" ""The Godfather,"" and ""The SCTV Staff Christmas Party.""

My personal favorite sketches from these boxes: ""Peppi Longsocks"", ""Ricardo Montalban's School of Acting,"" and ""Gerry Todd's Midnight Video Special."" The latter being the first time I had ever seen the Talking Heads' classic  ""Once in a Lifetime"" video (years before MTV), and it took me a year or so to realize that the video wasn't a skit.

The three shows with commentary tracks are okay. Dave Thomas spends much of the time on the show he comments on explaining the jokes in a fairly annoying way (explaining humor is rarely funny).

The two shows that Andrea Martin and Catherine O'Hara comment on are more insightful and amusing (like when Andrea's cell phone starts ringing, or when Andrea starts talking about how the movie ""Brother Bear"" ripped off Bob & Doug McKenzie, unaware that Moranis and Thomas supplied the voices for the movie.)

The extras are good, although, sadly, Rick Moranis is missing from all new-for-DVD material.",1106870400,7,1545,4.9192307692307695

2116726,5,B0002S94X4,"Early Saturday Night Live seemed to rely on drug addled humor and the force of the personalities (Belushi, etc.) rather than the writing. I found most of it obvious and only mildly amusing. SCTV had great scripts, was not limited to live sketches, and drew on a wealth of knowledge about pop culture - both good and bad. SCTV had a far better group of actors - these guys and gals could do takes on almost any celebrity. Years later, the early Saturday Night Live shows seem juvenile and forced. SCTV has some dated material (because it was topical at times) but the sketches are loony enough and the characterizations are wild enough to still provoke laughs. Excellent set.",1103932800,7,674,4.6722689075630255
2116727,4,B0002S94X4,"Okay, the holidays are here and you've decided to spend a few extra dollars on an SCTV box set as a present for that special someone - but which one should you buy? Maybe I can help you decide.

When SCTV moved into an expanded timeslot in 1981, the first batch of episodes featured a great deal of older material from the late seventies, such as their full-length ""Fantasy Island"" parody. Although some of these earlier sketches had dated badly, it was simply the most effective way of introducing the cast of characters to the new viewers who hadn't seen the syndicated episodes.

The second cycle of episodes had a higher amount of newly-written material, although the quality of the shows became less consistent from week to week as the writers struggled to meet the demand for fresh new comedy. There was also the challenge of having to write sketches for guest musicians who just couldn't act. The show desperately needed a new energetic, creative writer-performer; unfortunately, Martin Short would not arrive until the start of the third series.

It should be pointed out that each sketch on the second box set is indexed for easy access. This is not the case with the first box set, which can lead to some frustrating moments as you impatiently scan through five identical-looking discs trying to find your favorite moments. You can look for clues by checking the episode summaries in the accompanying booklet, but it's no substitute for index stops. In addition, disc 5 from the first set suffers from audio dropouts.

Both box sets are excellent overall with a high percentage of laugh-out loud moments (Sammy Maudlin's ill-timed coughing fit during his rendition of ""Here Comes Santa Claus"" is a riot), but I'm recommending the second one slightly over the first - not just for the technical reasons listed above, but also for the bonus commentary tracks from Catherine O'Hara and Andrea Martin, which are gossipy and hilarious. Fans of Martin Short are advised to hold out for Volume 3.",1102809600,13,1999,4.870588235294117

I am still waiting for two episodes to be released:

One in which John Candy portrays Divine as the guest star in the Mellonville summer theater's production of Peter Pan.  I still wonder how he did it.

The other is the classic parody of ""The Towering Inferno"", the Charlton Heston disaster film in which a lot of very important rich people are trapped in posh restaurant atop a burning office tower in San Francisco.  They are there to attend the grand opening of the building, designed by architect Heston, who runs around with with blueprints trying to find an escape route.  In the SCTV version, a fire breaks out in the cocktail lounge atop the new SCTV mile-high television antennae, filled with the elite of Mellonville, which is already swaying quite a bit in the wind when the fire breaks out. When the little Mellonville fire truck arrives down below, the fire chief (John Candy) stands scratching his head as dummies start plopping around him.  Plop. ""Ooooh! Plop. ""Oooooh!""

Seeing Eugene Levy's ""Perry Como: Still Alive"" promo is worth the price of the set alone. I thought it was hysterical when I saw it originally in the 1980s, and it still makes me laugh today.

There's also the brilliant switch on ""The Jazz Singer"" in which soul/jazz singer Al Jarreau wants to be a Jewish cantor instead of an R&B star, much to the distress of his father, played by Eugene Levy's hysterical short Jewish character, Sid Dithers, who sports cornrows for the duration of the sketch.

Then there's Catherine O'Hara's Lola Heatherton interviewing Andrea Martin's Mother Theresa. If Ms. O'Hara's  constantly calling Mother Theresa ""Mommy"" doesn't make you laugh, then Ms. O'Hara's singing Steve Miller's song ""The Joker"" to her will.

I have to mention another sketch that's on these disks. It's a promo for a 1970s-like action TV show entitled ""Fish Police"" that's so dumb and silly, it's unforgettable. The ironic thing about the sketch is that 11 years later, there was actually an animated series entitled ""Fish Police""--and it too was dumb and silly.",1100044800,18,1152,4.948186528497409

They present a distinctly boomer view in opposition to the previous WWII generation, as is evidenced by their prime targets: Bob Hope, Ricardo Montalbon, Joey Heatherton, talk show hosts a la Johnny Carson, and especially Merv Griffin, who gets thoroughly lambasted. Their impersonations are spot on, and SCTV takes great delight in weird juxtapositions, such as Annie Hall from Don Rickle's perspective, or Ben Hur with the title role being played by Curly of the Three Stooges. When they do a parody of Fantasy Island, the rather large John Candy is wonderfully miscast as the diminutive Tattoo. My favorite moment: Mel Torme scat singing the ""Star Spangled Banner."" If you like Monty Python, this is must see TV, and I would encourage you to buy ALL the DVD's. Amazingly, this bunch is based in Edmonton, Alberta.",1487030400,,987,5.061349693251533

8031052,4,B0002S94X4,"The sketch comedy show SCTV was initially well-received in its native Canada, and after it became established NBC picked up the show for broadcast in the United States for its fourth season.  The series' theme was that of being a fictitious television network, with each episode being a broadcast day.  The nine episodes in this DVD collection were broadcast on both NBC and the CBC from October 1981 to February 1982.

The most memorable performances for those who watched the series in the early Eighties likely include Joe Flaherty playing SCTV president Guy Caballero and Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas playing the McKenzie brothers in the ""Great White North"" sketch.  There were many other well-written and creative sketch ideas, including spoofs of many then-current TV shows.  Not surprising is that, given when these episodes aired, there is both Cold War humor and material that would not be considered politically correct by the standards of 2015.

Musical guests in these episodes included Al Jarreau, Natalie Cole, James Ingram, the Boomtown Rats, Talking Heads, and the Plastics.  Bonus features on this set include an interview with the writers and the appearance of some of the cast members at the Emmys.

John Candy and Rick Moranis eventually went on to long careers in the movies, and the other SCTV cast members had considerable talent.  I remember discovering this show in sixth grade when I could finally stay up as late as I wanted on Friday and Saturday nights, and even remembered the theme song and a little bit of the material.  There are enough laughs here to make watching the series worthwhile, even if the laugh ratio falls short of, say, the Mike Myers-Dana Carvey era of ""Saturday Night Live"" of the early Nineties.",1446768000,,1745,4.965635738831615
