4046220,4,B0030IIYXO,"Fans of HANNAH MONTANA have been waiting for this DVD, and it's finally here. HANNAH MONTANA: MILEY SAYS GOODBYE? includes the two-part Season 3 finale, as well as four other episodes. The cast is as good as ever, and Miley Cyrus and Emily Osment keep cracking me up. But, really, the series is anchored by the wonderful father-daughter relationship. There's just enough poignancy beneath it all to ground things. Billy Ray Cyrus years ago got famous for half a moment when ""Achy Breaky Heart"" topped the country charts. And now here's his daughter having become much more famous, and on a global scale.

Some people say that Miley Cyrus isn't so talented, and I disagree. She does have presence. But what I like best about her is that she's pretty fearless with the comedy bits. She doesn't mind looking less than glamorous in her scenes if she can get a laugh out of it. I think she'll do well post-HANNAH MONTANA, especially if Disney's got her back. In the meantime, I say enjoy this series because it won't be around for much longer, and then we're all gonna be short one really good and wholesome show. The goofy humor is about what you'd expect and adults will probably roll their eyes, especially with Jason Earles and Moises Arias unashamedly hamming it up. The pre-teens, though, will eat it up. Me, the comedy I really enjoy comes from the sharp interactions between Miley and Emily Osment. These two demonstrate really terrific timing and chemistry, and can you say Lucy and Ethel?

This bunch of episodes are all pulled from Season 3 and features guest appearances by David Archuleta and Brooke Shields.

- ""You Never Give Me My Money"" - Miley suspects her dad's giving her her own checking account just may be a test. Jackson can't find his cell phone, which sort of puts a black eye on his claim of being more responsible.

- ""Papa's Got A Brand New Friend"" - When Miley accidentally pushes her choreographer out the window, her replacement instantly bonds with Robby Ray. Except that this new choreographer, behind Miley's dad's back, is a bit of a tool. And Oliver wants to break up with Joanie.

- ""Promma Mia"" - Miley doesn't have a date for the prom, and the guy she likes isn't taking the hints. And, being a nice kid, how can she turn down the nerd who does ask her?

- ""He Could Be The One"" - Miley and her ex-beau Jake Ryan are secretly dating, but Miley is trying to soften Robby Ray up for when she tells him. But then Jesse - the cute, brooding guitar player in her band - enters the picture. Watch for Jackson and Rico's hilarious turn as the singing Chorus.

- ""Miley Says Goodbye?"" (Parts 1 & 2) - A homesick Miley decides to go back to Tennessee. Oliver gets offered a gig opening for a rock band but it's a tour that'll take him away from Lilly for six months. Jackson moves out on his own, but he picks a pretty shabby apartment.

The DVD bonus stuff includes: an alternate ending for ""He Could Be The One""; An option to have fun fact pop-ups in the ""You Never Give Me My Money"" episode; and ""Sister Secrets,"" in which Miley's real-life sister Brandi interviews the cast and takes us on a tour of the sets. And, yes, the DVD also comes with a glittery photo of Miley and Blue Jeans and there's an inset place for your own photo.",1268611200,,3261,4.487352445193929
4046221,4,B0030IIYXO,Don't know what the other user is talking about but this dvd does contain the 2 part finale of season 4.  That's all they have been advertising.  See it before it airs on disney.  I can verify this as I just got it from target on tuesday.  12.99 plus tax 15 total.  14.96 or soemthing like that.  And no waiting for days from amazon.  Brand new.  Still cheaper than amazon and brand new.  The only thing I hate is too many previews in the beginning of the dvd.  And my dvd player won't let me move up and down the menu.  But it is old so might be the issue.  Otherwise great dvd.,1268179200,,579,4.0265486725663715
4046222,4,B0030IIYXO,"In the latest volume of the popular Disney television series, a total of five hilarious and fun ""Hannah Montana"" episodes to satisfy the Miley fans and the entire family!

Having a child that is a big fan of various Disney series, ""HANNAH MONTANA"" has been part of our household family viewing for years. So, suffice to say that I have watched a good share of the episodes of ""HANNAH MONTANA"" to get a good feel of what the series is about.  As for the DVD releases tend to revolve around a certain theme than episodic episodes in order. Thus here comes a new ""HANNAH MONTANA"" DVD titled ""Miley Says Goodbye"" and features Miley, Jackson and friends who are older and now having to make important life decisions.

Also, with each of the talent of the show going to do their own thing in their personal careers, especially Miley Cyrus, it was not known if the third season would be her last and thus the season ended with what could be seen as a fitting series finale.  But a fourth and final season has been ordered by the Disney Channel and thus, the final conclusion to the series will be in 2011.

For those not familiar with the television show that launched the career of pop star, Miley Cyrus, ""HANNAH MONTANA"" is a popular Disney Channel television series which started back in 2006 and revolves around a family of three.

Miley Stewart (Miley Cyrus) is a normal teenage girl but when she goes on stage and records an album, she dons a blond wig and is known as the popular pop idol Hannah Montana.

Her father/manager Robbie (real life father, Billie Ray Cyrus) has given her the dual identity so she can live a normal teenage life. She lives with her brother Jackson (played by Jason Earles) who is a bit of goof off who tends to get himself into some sort of predicament at home or at work at the hot dog stand owned by young entrepreneur Rico (played by Moises Arias).  For Miley/Hannah, she is fortunate to have her best friend Lilly Truscott (played by Emily Osment) and Oliver Oken (played by Mitchel Musso) around at times to be her voice of reason and to help bail her out of trouble.

But in this third season, the six episodes featured on this DVD feature the kids who are now older.  Miley having made a successful movie, her career is doing well but getting a taste of her old life in Tennessee, she questions if California or Tennessee should be her true home. Jackson is dealing with decisions about college (and not going to college) and living on his own.  Oliver has done well in a music talent show and sees his music career starting to blossom while Lilly is now living with Miley and figuring out where she fits in with the success of her best friends.

The ""Hannah Montana - Miley Says Goodbye?"" DVD features a total of six episodes. Included are (note: spoilerless summaries):

  1. EPISODE 59: You Never Give Me My Money - With Miley's father managing her money, Miley wants to show that she is financial responsible (after her credit card debacle many episodes ago).  So, her father is allowing her to have a checking account with $5,000 and to see if she can be responsible and not spend it all.
  2. EPISODE 64: Papa's Got a New Friend - With Miley accidentally injuring her choreographer (played by ""Dancing with the Stars"" Carrie Inaba), she hires a new choreographer who instantly becomes her father's best friend.  But her new choreographer is all about him and very strict to Miley and her dancers.
  3. EPISODE 69: Promma Mia - With Oliver and Lilly going to the prom, Miley doesn't have a date.  (special guest star: ""American Idol"" star David Archuleta)
  4. EPISODE 73: He Could Be the One - An old boyfriend tries to come back to Miley but with her father still sore from how the boyfriend treated Miley back then, Miley tries to hide the fact that she is dating him again from her father.
  5. EPISODE 84: Miley Says Goodbye? Part 1 - Miley reunites with her horse Blue Jeans by bringing him to California.  So, now she is considering moving back to Tennessee.  Meanwhile, Jackson deals with living in his own apartment.
  6. EPISODE 85: Miley Says Goodbye? Part 2 - Miley wants to move back to Tennessee, Oliver is offered to open and tour with a band for six months but both are worried about how Lilly will deal with their departure.

JUDGMENT CALL:

For ""Hannah Montana - Miley Says Goodbye?"", the episodes focus on the kids growing up and now having to make decisions about life, love and career.  It was not known if this would be the final season of ""Hannah Montana"", so it was quite interesting to see this one hour episode season finale and for the most part, it would have been a fitting ending if Disney chose not to renew the series.  Personally, it's quite interesting to see how much has changed with the characters and to see them grow from these young kids to now young adults within the last four years but with one final season to go, it will be interesting to see how the series concludes.

But for the most part, for ""Hannah Montana"" fans, you get a total of six fun episodes instead of the usual 4-5 and more special features included on the DVD, especially to see how backstage, the set of ""Hannah Montana"" is a family affair with older sister Brandi Cyrus working in props and Miley's grandmother going through the fan mail.

Overall, as a father of a child who enjoys the series, the show definitely has its share of hilarious moments and for six episodes for a low price, you really can't go wrong with it. Fans of Miley Cyrus and ""Hannah Montana"" won't be disappointed.",1268179200,19,6449,4.560382276281494
