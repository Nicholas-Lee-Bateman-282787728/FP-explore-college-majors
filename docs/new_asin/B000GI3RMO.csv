8132763,1,B000GI3RMO,"A horrid, poorly researched ""student-like"" production showcasing some major, but mostly, relatively minor fender-bender wrecks, including a mind numbing large number of early NASCAR, business as usual spins, etc. Most of racing's truly notable racing crashes are not included. Save your money.",1409961600,,293,6.0
8132764,5,B000GI3RMO,This is a real great video filled with thrills and spills.  It was well done.  I have watched it half a dozen times and never get tired of the action.,1239321600,,150,3.966666666666667
8132765,2,B000GI3RMO,Caution!  Don't be fooled into purchasing this DVD based on the image shown on the case's front cover.  The DVD has no footage of Formula One racing.  Very deceptive packaging.,1198627200,2,176,4.8
