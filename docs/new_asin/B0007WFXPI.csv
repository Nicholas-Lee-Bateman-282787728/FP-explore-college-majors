It was certainly a guilty pleasure of its day, with varied well-written stories about murder and vice among the rich and famous - topics included stepmothers fooling around with their adult stepsons, stalkers, kinky sex, S&M, college coed murders, you name it - total sensationalism filmed in the bright tropical colors of a vacation paradise full of intrigue.  There were a wide array of attractive TV actors as guest stars over the years, in Season 1 there was Jamie Lee Curtis' sister Kelly and the beautiful singer Vanity among others.  Ben Vereen did a nice job playing the captain in the first two seasons, later replaced by comedian Charlie Brill.  The clothes were Miami Vice pastels plus neons, and though there were some exterior shots filmed in Florida this series was primarily shot in California as I recall.  This is a good starter selection of first season shows and introduction to the two main stars, the detectives Chris (Rob Estes) and Rita (Mitzi Kapture).  If you just want to watch pure entertainment without the grittiness of CSI or SVU, kick back and relax with this DVD.",1335225600,,1359,4.8111587982832615

If you want just a sample, this DVD is great.  But be warned, you'll probably want to order all of Season One next!",1252713600,2,262,4.18
