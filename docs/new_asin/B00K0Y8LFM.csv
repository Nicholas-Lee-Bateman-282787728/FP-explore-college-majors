8655002,5,B00K0Y8LFM,"I stumbled upon Vaala's films through a reference to his work in an Aki Kaurismaki interview. And, miraculously, 11 of them are now available in excellent, English subtitled region 2 (?) transfers.  They all have charming special features - short travel-tour visits to Finnish cities (not subtitled) and production stills of Vaala at work with his team on the film in question.
Having worked my way through about half of them, my joy is unbounded.  Of course some are better than others but I have yet to see one that isn't really fine.  The best ones are about as good as it gets and this one is among the very best.
I teach film studies at the University of Connecticut and took a chance on showing this late 1930s Finnish period comedy to one of my classes - a group of sophisticated production students.  They are a tough audience, shell shocked as they are by a lifetime of Hollywood action (Michael Bay, etc.) and deep-dish (Martin Scorsese, etc.) merde, desensitized by erectile dysfunction commercials, by the piffle of television in general and by the daily body count provided by their popular 'culture,' in all of which no shot lasts longer than one quarter of a second.  Much to my joy, they unanimously loved this movie.
Do yourself a big favor and buy a copy (get yourself a multi-region player.  If you love movies it's the best investment you'll ever make).
A gender bender comedy, told seemingly without effort, sharply observant of the ways of men and women, brim full of intelligence and with wondrous, affectionate humor, The Man from Sysma tells the story of a man and women who were wedded in childhood.  Growing up (he was 8, she 6) the fierce, not very bright but utterly delightful groom has long departed for a life of swashbuckling adventure, always in search of a good fight and a good time.  On returning to Finland, and through a series of drolly worked out farcical coincidences worthy of  Heinz Ruhmann's best efforts, our blockhead unknowingly falls for his own wife not realizing that she...is she.  Through the aid of a lovable rogue picked up on the way, Arvid (our boy) attempts to engineer a divorce from the wife he hasn't seen for 15 years so he can pursue...the same woman.  This level headed, lovely lady (played exquisitely by the tragic Sirkka Sarri) knows the score (more effortless story telling), and, entirely without malice, is determined to win and yoke him to her sensible and loving sway.  This only begins to tell the story and leaves off entire the leading lady's frequent morphing from female to male and back again (all in the service of the irresistible plot) to the hilarious bewilderment of Arvid.  Vaala presents all of this and more with an elegance and grace comparable with the best films of Reinhold Schunzel and Alessandro Blasetti!  His work with the actors is remarkable - these performances could not be better, nor more charming or more lovable.
Vaala's depiction of rampant masculinity is unique in my experience.  Unambiguously virile, goofy in the extreme, boyishly playful, neither self-conscious nor narcissistic, given to hilarious tantrums and delirious transports of high spirited physicality (at one point Arvid demolishes a wood pile in a way and for reasons eerily similar to Charles Farrell's attack on a forest in Borzage's The River), Vaala's men are far removed from the whipped, guilt ridden eunuchs of our corrected modern cinema.  I had the great misfortune to watch Scorsese's Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore just the night before seeing this, and the contrast between the honestly observed and benign delights of Olavi Reimas under Vaala show up the show-trial garbage of Keitel under Scorsese to withering effect.
Get a copy while you can - this seems too good to be true.  The two later Vaala pictures with the equally male-run-amok Martti Kuningas are almost as good, and the color photography of the Finnish countryside is ravishing.  If you can afford it, buy them all.  Valentin Vaala is a great artist.

Though the DVD and Amazon list this as a bit over one hour, the transfer times out to around 80 minutes.  I've read of an original timing of 95, and an existing print at 85 minutes.",1424908800,,4181,4.8277310924369745
