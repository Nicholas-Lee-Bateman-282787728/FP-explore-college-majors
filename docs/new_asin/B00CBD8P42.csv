8579769,4,B00CBD8P42,"Very good early 50's Rock Hudson adventure, set in the Canadian frozen wilds of the 19th century.  Rock plays a schooner captain who, with his wife, transports cargo back and forth from his northern port where he's based.  They run afoul of a ruthless, amoral businessman who develops a yen for the captain's wife and will not be denied.  Some of the scenery is not bad, but some of the film is obviously filmed on a set.  The DVD-R picture and quality is pretty good but is somewhat grainy.  The film needs re-mastering.  Otherwise, this DVD-R is highly recommended.",1451174400,,567,4.6767676767676765
8579770,5,B00CBD8P42,"A great movie from 1953. Back then in the waning days of the studio system the studios would put up and coming actors on a salary and truing them in acting, singing and dancing. They would take their most promising ""stars"" and feature or star them in B movies. Hopefully audiences would respond to particular actors and their stars would rise. Rock Hudson was one of these actors. Even though this movie is a B picture it plays like an A picture. Great story, great cast and a great adventure. If you love movies as I do then this one is for you and your library. I love the fact that Universal, Fox and Warners has opened up their vast libraries for public consumption.",1430611200,,670,4.411290322580645

8579775,4,B00CBD8P42,"Short and unremarkable but enjoyable action film set in the frozen wastelands of North America, mixing some good on-location footage with studio sets. The film elements on this DVD have not been restored however they are in excellent shape with only the occasional white speck and blemish in evidence. The picture is sharp and clear, contrast is well balanced and colour rich and strong. Sound is clear although recorded at rather a low volume. You'll need to crank up your speakers a bit. There are no special features, subtitles or menu - the movie starts as soon as the disc is loaded. Picture ratio is 1.33:1 (black bars at sides) and English language the only soundtrack. The disc is encoded for Region 1 only. Picture quality 8.5/10, Sound 8/10, Movie 7/10.",1378857600,12,763,4.8320610687022905
8579776,4,B00CBD8P42,"This is a very good adventure film set in the frozen wasteland. Plenty of snow, beautiful husky dogs and good fun. Rick Hudson handles his role as a true hero. This isn't exactly a western. More like an adventure film in gold rush territory. Good movie of the 1950's.",1370217600,7,267,4.469387755102041
