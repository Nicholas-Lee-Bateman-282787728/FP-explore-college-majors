1038101,4,6305495556,"This is all funny stuff from some of the old-time SNL crew, but a word of caution; I bought this DVD specifically because I wanted a copy of the skit where Woody Harrelson incites other cast members to take their shirts off at the beach.  This is one of the funniest SNL skits EVER, and is on the VHS version, but for some reason it didn't make it onto the DVD.  I won't be sending my DVD back, but I was very disappointed at the inexplicable cutting of this skit from the DVD version.",1109721600,12,485,4.148936170212766
1038102,5,6305495556,"When one sees the opening sketch, ""Total Bastard Airlines"", one is suddenly reminded of the wit and humor that ""SNL"" skits once possessed...This is the first ""Best Of"" dvd to be devoted to more than one cast member. Here, 5 cast members get their due: Adam Sandler, David Spade, Rob Schneider, Chris Rock and Chris Farley. And it stays true to the title, showing each cast member at their raunchiest.
Sandler seems to get the most coverage, appearing in about half the sketches. His are probably my favorite. I enjoyed every minute of his sketches, from ""Operaman"" to ""Canteen Boy"" to ""The Hanukkah Song"", I laughed my pants off. I only wish they'd included ""Cajun Man"" and ""The Present Song"".
Spade gets some coverage as well. In addition to a well - thawed ""Hollywood Minute Montage"", he captures the audience with his witty sarcasm in ""Total Bastard Airlines"" and the one in which he plays Dick Clark's snotty receptionist who is able to absorb catchy comebacks from Roseanne Barr.
Scheider does not appear that often, but when he does, you can't help but laugh. He seems to be at his best when he is doing his famed Richmeister (makin' copies) sketch with Sting. But he's even funnier in ""The Gap Girls"" and ""Orgasm Guy"".
Unfortunately, Rock and Farley do not get as much coverage, but when they appear, they steal the show. Rock's ""Nat X"" and editorials are some of the freshest and rawest humor ""Saturday Night Live""'s writers ever came up with. Farley outshines the rest with his interview wuith Jeff Daniles and his chubby Gap Girl.
It's especially funny when more than one cast member works together in the same sketch. Schneider and Sandler have a ball playing sex - crazed Italian waiters pining for Kirstie Alley at ""Il Cantore"" alongside a showstoppingly funny Dana Carvey. And Sandler and Farley are just to funny for this world in the uproarious ""Zagat's"".
I recommend this dvd to just about every ""SNL"" fan in the world. It features some extremely funny stuff, some of which is all too underrated. I hope to see a dvd in the future devoted to women of ""Saturday Night live"", like Jan Hooks, Molly Shannon, and Tina Fey.",1080864000,32,2135,4.726541554959786
1038103,3,6305495556,"This compilation of material from Saturday Night Live features skits with Chris Farley, David Spade, Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, and Chris Rock, as well as appearances by Helen Hunt, Kirstie Alley, Sara Gilbert, Phil Hartman, Mike Myers, Sting, Roseanne, Jeff Daniels, Alec Baldwin, Christina Applegate, Sean Penn, Steve Martin, Shannon Doherty, Glenn Close, and David Duchovny.
The problem with skits is that they usually are an extended one joke; there is no structural arc or payoff, which is true of what is presented here. However, as most of the skits are short, there is generally more hit than miss.
The studio audiences howls of homophobic derision at Alec Baldwin with Adam Sandler in Canteen Boy Goes Camping is pretty hard to take, though the parody of heterosexual behaviour in beer commercials in Schmitts Gay is less offensive. I liked Spade, Sandler and Farley in drag as Gap mall girls; how Roseanne steals from Spade as Dick Clark Productions obstructive receptionist; Farleys self-conscious interviewing of Jeff Daniels; Spades parody of Michael J Fox to Sean Penn; Rocks editorial comments which are edited into a montage; Spades montage of Hollywood Minutes; Sandlers Operaman; and 5 reasons not to see Whoopi Goldbergs new movie in Rocks Nat X.
Regrettably we cut away from Steve Martin before he does anything to Spade giving a bad review of Martins Leap of Faith, and Doherty makes her reading her lines from cue cards strangely obvious.
Its interesting to observe this group of comedians in their early years, before they graduated into TV sitcoms and film careers.",1002585600,8,1591,5.123076923076923

7890385,5,6305495556,"This video is very funny. It shows some of the tremendous talent of some of Saturday Night Lives alumni who went on to become big movie and tv stars such as Rob Schneider who my son and I had the pleasure of meeting after one of his live comedy shows right before Christmas 2009 and talking to for almost two hours and taking photos with him. In person Rob is a very nice, down to earth and funny guy just like I thought he would be and he puts on one heck of a hysterical live comedy show to. My favorite sketch of Robs is where he plays Rich the guy who sits next to the office copy machine. To this day I laugh everytime I see that sketch. On this video you also see some funny sketches from Robs buddy Adam Sandler such as his great character of Opera Man and you will also see Chris Rock, David Spade and the late Chris Farley as well as many more. This is a must see video for all who love Saturday Night Live and these wonderful comediennes. I give this video a five star rating.

7890387,5,6305495556,"I'd purchased the VHS version a few years ago, and still decided to get the DVD version because this is a keeper!  VHS doesn't keep well in 95% humidity all year round so the DVD was a welcome.

There's a little bit more on the DVD not seen on the VHS - wonderful surprises.  I believe there are many reviews of this title from its VHS days, so I'll refrain from commenting along those lines.

Still, great to see the Bad Boy again and again and again... this time around - in a more efficient interactive way!",1163030400,,510,4.22680412371134
7890388,5,6305495556,"As one revwer already pointed out, this is the first dvd to focus on more than one cast member from ""Saturday Night Live"". Here, Adam Sandler, David Spade, Rob Schneider, Chris Rock and Chris Farley get some of their best roles represented. (Farley, Sandler and Rock also have their own individual best of's as well).

Since this dvd does not represnt the single best moments of one cast member, my review will be structured like my one for the ""Halloween"" dvd. Here it goes:

Total Bastard Airlines - Spade and host Helen Hunt play ride flight attendants who swiftly shun off their cast members with the phrase ""ba - bye"". It's a one joke premise, but it's still very funny and a great way to get the ball rolling. 10/10

Il Cantore- even as an Italian, I found this sketch to be uproarious. Spade, Sandler, Farley, Mike Myers and Dana Carvey play sex - crazed waiters at an Italian restaurant who get it on with Kirstie Alley, much to her delight but to the dismay of husband Kevin Nealon. This sketch proves that the old ""SNL"" theory ""stereotypes are funny"" works, and this is no exception. 10/10

The Gap Girls - out of these recurring characters' seven appearances, this one is probably my favorite. While Christy (Spade), Lucy (Sandler) and Cindy (Chris Farley) are having lunch at Tater Junction, their invaded by Tammy (Schneider) and Misty (Sarah Gilbert), who poke fun at the girls. This sketch was so funny the whole way through, and even the court tv jokes still seem funny today (and so do the Michael Jsckson jokes, which is agiven). 10/10

Def ER Jam - in this 1996 parody of Russell Simmons' ""Def Comedy Jam"", Rock plays a foul mouthed nurse who shouts out politically incorrect words at will. How sweet. 10/10

The Richmeister - my favorite ""Saturday Night Live"" character may well be Schneider's lovable office pest Richard Laymer. Here, he makes his first appearance, annoying coworkers Tom (Mike Myers), Randy (Kevin Nealon), Sandy (Julia Sweeney), Steve (Phil Hartman) and Sting (played by, well, Sting). My favorite sketch. 10/10

Schmit's Gay - a classic ad spoof with Sandler and Farley as housesitters who with one sip turn an old rundown home into a homosexual paradise. The shots of tight bulges andall male conga lines may be a little much, but it's still a 10/10 sketch.

Dick Clark's Receptionist - Spade's breakthrough role was as Dick Clark's snooty receptionist, who made every guest wait and shut them up with his condescending ""and you are...""? Here, he shoots ut catty one liners to Roseanne, who proves to be an excellent foil. It got really funny when Phil Hartman came in as Jesus. 10/10

The Chris Farley Show - Chris stumbles through an interview with Jeff Daniels. It was this childilike attitude that made Farley so lovable, and why we miss him so much. 10/10

Canteen Boy - Sandler's recurring character, the 27 year old boy scout, is featured in the controversial scoutmaster sketch with Alec Baldwin. In it, Baldwin spills water on Sandler's sleeping bag, forcing him to share one with him. Baldwin tries to cajole Sandler into having sex with him. Bsldwin goes too far, and Sandler manages to escape by having Baldwin attacked by snakes. This sketch is so wrong on so many levels (the scen where Baldwin sodomizes Sandler may be a little much fro some people)< yet it's so funny. 10/10

Big Toe Song - a tounge in cheek Boys II Men knock - off, Rock and Tim Meadows play lead singers of G - Spot, who perform their hit ""Big Toe Song"". The video for this song is raunchy as hell and it's hilarious. 10/10

Chris Rock On Update Highlights - bits and pieces of Rock's ""Weekend Update"" commentaries, all of which are raw and witty. 10/10

Spade In America - from Spade's last episode, he presents a clipshow of his ""Hollywood Minute"" bits. Hysterical, especially the MC Hamer joke, though I ish they had the Rick Ocasek joke (Hey Rick why the long face?) 10/10

Opera Man Highlights - more clips, this time Sandler as his popular ""Update"" characterwho sings about the news story. This is possibly the dvd's best sketch, other than the Richmeister. 10/10

Hanukkah Song - Sandler's three part holiday classic made its debut on Decmeber 10th, 1994 on ""Weekend Update"". This edition is my favorite, especially the line about Ebineezer Scrooge. 10/10

Nikey Turkey Commercial - a parody of those Nike pump sneaker with Rockas a rapping spokesman. Very good. 10/10

The Denise Show - Sandler plays Brian, a man obsessed with his ex - girlfriend and hists a tv show about itt. This sketch even in a rather disturbing sort of way. 10/10

Orgasm Guy - finally, Schneider appears again. Here he plays a man named Ron, a guy who's turned on by everything, from Jonathan Demme films to Setchuan foods. 10/10

Def Jam Magic Show - another Def Jam spoof, with foul mouth from Rock. The dialogue between Tim Meadows and Ellen Cleghorne is especially intersting. 10/10

Zagat's - this at one pint was my favorite ""SNL"" sketch. Sandler and Farley play the Gelfands, an old Jewish couple. Farley annoyingly reads restaurant choices for their 35th anniversary in the Zagat's guide, much to Sandler's annoyance. David Duchovny was really funny as Farley's sister. 10/10

The Dark Side With Nat X -Rock's most popular recurring character, militant Nat X, appears in a 1996 hosting stint, hassling Jesse Jackson (Darrell Hammond), Tori Spelling (Cheri Oteri) and Mike Tyson (Tracy Morgan). Great way to end it all. 10/10

The bonus sketches are really funny, especially ""Sapde In America"" with Jennifer Anniston.

There are some sketches that I wish were one here. For example, I wish they included the sketch where Schneider is the owner of the African artifacts shop who sells artifacts used to stash marijuana. Also, a Matt Foley sketch with Farley would have been nice. Also, the majority of these sketches are featured on other dvds, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it.

Overall, this is such a great dvd. Now here's the next dvd collection of ""SNL"" dvds I would like to see:

""Saturday Night Live: The Women"". It would have:

""The Best Of Cheri Oteri"" (this aired on tv in Spetember yet hasn't been released yet)
""The Best Of Jan Hooks""
""The Best Of Ana Gasteyer""
""The Best Of Gilda Radner""
""The Best Of Jane Curtain""
""The Best Of Victoria Jackson""
""The Best Of Laraine Newman""
""The Best Of Molly Shannon"" (which I already have)

and

""Saturday Night Live: The Hosts"":

""The Best Of Tom Hanks"" (this aired on tv as well but hasn't seen the light of day on dvd)
""The Best Of John Goodman""
""The Best Of Alec Baldwin""
""The Best Of Christopher Walken"" (which I have)
""The Best Of Steve Martin"" (which I also have)
""The Best Of Buck Henry"" (this should really please the old fans of the show)

""Saturday Night Live: The First Five Years"":

""The Best Of Dan Akroyd""
""The Best Of John Belushi""
""The Best Of Garret Morris""
""The Best Of Chevy Chase""
""The Best Of Bill Murray""
""The Best Of Laraine Newman""
""The Best Of Gilda Radner""
""The Best Of Jane Curtain""

And here are just a few random best - of's:

""The Best Of Kevin Nealon""
""The Best Of Jon Lovitz"" (this again aired on tv but is not on dvd)
""The Best Of Phil Hartman, Volume 2""
""The Best Of Will Ferrell, Volume 3"" (volume 2 really blew)
""The Best Of David Spade"" (which is coming out this fall)

Bottom line: pick up ""Bad Boys"".",1113264000,56,7315,4.684621389539422
