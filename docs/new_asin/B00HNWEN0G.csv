8633930,1,B00HNWEN0G,"maybe I didn't see the same movie as the other reviewers but I paid $1.99 to see this movie and even that was too much.  Boring self indulgent stupid. My cat walked over the remote 10 minutes before the end and I didn't even care enough to find my spot to finish watching.  There is no ending real, imagined or otherwise that would make this a good movie and worth the preceding 100+ minutes.",1451865600,,392,4.283783783783784
8633931,5,B00HNWEN0G,"If No Budget is the equivalent of starting with lead, this is a piece of pure alchemical gold. Leann Darling, the key actress and in most shots the only one, carries just about all the weight in this one and it's good because some of the other actresses, particularly the mother, aren't up to her standard. She plays Dawn, and several of Dawn's bewigged alter ego. Dawn is a woman diagnosed so long ago with mental and emotional trauma that she can't visualize her life without being sick. Several possibilities, suicidal and homicidal, crop up during this movie and in the end it isn't, nor should it be, apparent what actually happened and was just a trick of the mind. Fine stuff. I'd love for there to be a high-budget remake with Ms Darling still in the lead role.",1405296000,,769,4.539568345323741
8633932,4,B00HNWEN0G,"My impression of this very interesting film has two parts:  first, the acting of the main character was superb and loaded with fascinating nuances - she truly has uncharted depths to her and dug deep into them to pull off this performance.

Secondly, however, the film had a strange overall quality of ""amateur-ness"" and I couldn't figure out if this was intentional or not.  the acting was rather crude and forced and lacking in depth - a typical sign of an amateur production - even when the very gifted star would let out a ripping scream she somehow looked like she was laughing at the director's instructions to 'exaggerate'.

Way, way, way too much repetition of scenes which led me to think that the makers of this film had found a unique method of saving money.

I gave it 4 stars because i couldn't take my eyes off it and had to stay up til 3 a.m. in order to watch to the end.",1393027200,,887,4.384146341463414
8633933,4,B00HNWEN0G,"I saw Lighthouse Lane in June 2012 at a premiere screening in Tempe, AZ. In attendence was the film's star, Leeanne Dearing. It was a pleasure to meet her in person after seeing her multi-faceted and nuanced performance in the film, which was probably designed to give Laura Dern's acclaimed performance in ""INLAND EMPIRE"" a run for its money. It is very much in that's style of a one-woman show designed to be the glue that holds its fragmented narrative together. Visually, this indie feature is quite a delight since it is not afraid to dive into the murky shadows of the subconscious with regards to budget limitations. The film was obviously designed with many welcome homages to David Lynch's more surrealistic work and is all the more better for it. This low-budgeted feature succeeds in spite of the said limitations due to the commitment of its leading lady, impressive sound design, and its creators to show that the art of in-coherency has not been completely taken over in American cinema by Marvel and ilk.",1389657600,4,1019,4.828571428571428
8633934,5,B00HNWEN0G,"Among the numerous independent films produced over the years, Lighthouse Lane was a compelling and thought provoking story. The photography and acting were above what my expectations were. The artfully shot film expolred interpersonal relationships and insight into the depths of human psyche. Among the cast interplay was a great soundtrack. Personally, i enjoyed the piano solo near the end of the film. If you are deciding on weather or not to purchase this film, i would say take the chance and support the indie film movement. You will not be dissappointed.",1389571200,3,562,5.119565217391305
