8081087,5,B000AYWNW4,This video tells about the many scenic and interesting stops along the various roads included in the loop drive.  It is a most interesting area.  The video covers the area well and is a great planning tool.  Beware that it is recorded on a DVD-R instead of a regular DVD.,1475884800,,271,4.38
8081088,4,B000AYWNW4,"Three weeks ago, my family and I toured the Cascade Loop.  I purchased this video as a souvenir record of the delightful trip.  While the video production date is not current, it is beautiful and meets my needs as a record -- it is definitely worth the purchase cost.",1414540800,,267,4.428571428571429
8081089,3,B000AYWNW4,"Quality was fine. I was disappointed in the fact that it was only 30 minutes long, especially for the price.",1406764800,,108,4.45
8081090,1,B000AYWNW4,"The video had to have been made 30 - 40 years ago.  After viewing the video we have changed our mind & we are not going to take the Cascade Loop. I know the state of WA is beautiful, but that wasn't depicted. Don't waste your money.",1278633600,2,232,3.9361702127659575
