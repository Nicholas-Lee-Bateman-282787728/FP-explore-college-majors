The Last of the Fast Guns (1958) isn't a bad Western and the location is gorgeous, I think that's what pulls it through. At the start, two gunfighters shoot it out in town and the winner is invited to speak with an old man. He offers the winning gunfighter a job, to go look for his lost brother, who disappeared in Mexico. Jock Mahoney plays the gunfighter, he isn't very magnetic or interesting, but nonetheless he possesses the gunfighter creed.

Mexican actor Gilbert Roland is here as well, the same as usual, being suave and smoking a lot. He works for Lorne Greene, who is gone for most of the picture. the gunfighter looks for the supposed-dead brother and finds a bit of a mystery. The ending was rather contrived, but it isn't a horrible picture.",1467676800,,798,4.573426573426573

8535459,4,B0093SS9WG,"A gunfighter (Jock Mahoney) accepts $25,000 to track down the brother of a wealthy but dying man (Carl Benton Reid). The only clue to his whereabouts is a letter from Mexico. Eventually, the gunfighter finds what he's looking for but he also finds something more important ... his salvation. As a westerns buff, there's nothing more I love than to find some obscure western that has merit and this one is different enough to stand out from the large pack of 1950s westerns. There's enough gunplay to keep the westerns fan satisfied but the film also works quite nicely as a detective story. Neatly shot in CinemaScope by Alex Phillips Jr. (BRING ME THE HEAD OF ALFREDO GARCIA) on location in Cuernavaca, Mexico. Directed by George Sherman. With Gilbert Roland, Lorne Greene, Linda Cristal, Eduard Franz and Edward Platt.

The Llamentol DVD from Spain is a very good wide screen (2.35) anamorphic transfer with English and Spanish soundtracks and optional Spanish and French subtitles.",1368316800,3,984,5.0
