8605831,5,B00EISTUAQ,"The movie is about Jessica, the new girl in school who meets Andrew, a shy 12 year old. Love blooms until the Falklands War intervenes.

I love the film, and itfs a great trip back to the 1980s and great memories for this '80s kid.

The costuming evokes memories of the period and the music helps set the mood greatly.

Well worth a purchaseif you like love stories, the 80s or just plain great movies.  Also supporting Indie filmmakers is also a great cause.
