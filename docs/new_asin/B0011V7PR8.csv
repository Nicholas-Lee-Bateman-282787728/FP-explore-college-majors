8242601,5,B0011V7PR8,"Being a Jason Wiles fan, I was really looking forward to seeing this movie he wrote and directed. I wasn't disappointed. This film tells a great story about true friendship, loyalty, and the hardships of life.
The cast is amazing and the friendship portrayed in the movie feels real and genuine. As a bonus, the music throughout it all is great!

Jason Wiles is fantastic at everything he does (acting, writing, directing...), and I can't wait for his future projects.",1410825600,,468,4.85
8242602,5,B0011V7PR8,This movie is really good. I ordered it mainly for Paul Wesley and Austin Nichols. I was surprised by how good it was actually. It reminded me of a Varsity Blues type movie and I love them both.,1401235200,,194,4.131578947368421

8242604,4,B0011V7PR8,"I came across this movie on Showtime,but I've yet to see it from beginning to end. But I plan on catching it on demand. But what I'm writing in hopes that someone may be able to help me me in obtaining the song that's sung during the closing credits. I do know that the artist's name is Gary Clarke jr.and the song from the movie is called""I'll be just fine"".I've searched high and low for this song. Mr. Clarke does not even have this song on any of his 3 existing cd's that I found on cdbaby.com If there is anyone out there who is familiar with this song or with Gary Clarke jr's work who can help me I would really appreciate it. I just want to say that it's so sad when you hear all of this great music from these movies 9 times out of ten there is no existing soundtrack or any info as to how we can obtain the song or music. So many movies I've come across and the muscial artist get NO recognition. I know Mr. Clarke is based out of Texas as far as perfoming. Thankyou in advance for any help you may bring.",1264550400,,1015,4.02970297029703
8242605,3,B0011V7PR8,"First of all, this is NOT your typical sports movie where the team consisting of the good guys start off playing poorly, quickly meet up with the bad guys, bad guys motivate them to play better, and by the end of the movie they teach the bad guys a lesson by defeating them in a close game.

No, this is more about a bunch of young men who start up a baseball team, play against a team that consists of the towns crooked cops, and fight for a change in the small town they live in.

The one cop who plays the main role is a REAL mean son of a gun, and he's the reason the young boys were feeling so much anger and hostility towards the cop for the entire movie.

This movie had a few problems- for one, it wasn't the most entertaining story you can imagine. Honestly the story felt like it wasn't developed all the way, though I guess I could be confusing that with a small town and quiet storyline which is not supposed to be sophisticated or anything.

Also, the young men were taking a basketball game in the beginning of the movie very seriously which seemed to indicate it would be basketball -not baseball- that would lead to a competition with the cops later on. Not a big deal of course, but kind of confusing.

Despite giving the film only 3 stars, I did like it. I just wish there was more to it than what we got.",1248307200,,1323,4.15234375
8242606,5,B0011V7PR8,"Knowing Jason Wiles's work I expected a good movie, but he still managed to surprise me with how excellent it really is. The movie has a strong plot, amazing cast, authentic eighties feel and good music. I really enjoyed it and can't wait for Wiles's next project.

I highly recommend this movie.",1211760000,,296,4.6923076923076925
8242607,5,B0011V7PR8,"As a sports fan the title and cover art were enough to peak my interest. But it's the all-star cast that did it for me...Austin Nichols, Jason Ritter, Paul Wesley, Michael Rooker and though I've never been a fan of Billy Baldwin he was a hoot! Oh yeah, and it's a Third Watch fan's dream: written/directed by Jason Wiles, starring Michael Beach and Josh Stewart with voice over work by Chris Bauer. The only way to improve that would be to have had Wiles star in it himself.

It's about high school friends, but don't expect a typical high school movie. There's no teeny bopper heart throb singing about breakups and makeups. It's a great coming of age story with real characters who have real issues. A little bit of sports action. Good guys and bad guys. Friendship prevails.

There's some really great stuff in this movie, and it definitely deserves a look. If you're too cheap to buy it at least go rent it!",1206403200,,911,4.515151515151516
8242608,5,B0011V7PR8,"Rented this movie based on a pretty cool cast (Jason Ritter, Billy Baldwin, Chris Klein, Michael Rooker...) thinking it might be kind of interesting and I was really, really impressed with what I saw!  The filmmakers obviously had a lot of money to make a really cool drama-thriller about a bunch of teenagers who go up agains a corrupt small town sheriff.  Reminded me a bit of some of the great classics like THE OUTSIDERS and STAND BY ME.

If you are looking for a really pleasant and fresh change from the rest of the junk out there, check out FULL COUNT - you will have a great time!",1206057600,4,588,4.376146788990826
