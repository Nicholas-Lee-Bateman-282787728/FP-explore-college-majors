I initially saw this film when I was very young and kind of slept on it.  However, after doing extensive research on The Panthers, their coming together, their downfall, and the devilish conspiracies of one J. Edgar Hoover, not only contributing to the Panthers downfall, but the killing of MLK, Malcolm X, and even indirect in the assassination of JFK, I found this movie to be enlightening and a constant reminder of where my people have come from, and how much further we still have to go even today.  The one part of the movie that is haunting for me and stands out so much is Hoover's direct or indirect involvement in drugs and heroin being brought into our inner cities to directly make our people commit geonocide on one another (though some may say this was ficticious, but we really know better).  Our Black leaders have cried this argument for the past 30 years and doesn't it seem rather ironic that the drug epedemic happened to boom just as the Panthers were being broken up, The Vietnam War ending, and racial tensions between blacks and law enforcement was at an all time high?  Coincidence, I think not.  The only thing is that those persons responsible for flying that stuff into our urban cities and ghetto's never counted on the fact that it would explode as a nationwide epedemic by the time the mid 80's rolled around and a drug called crack came into existence.  I think the movie should have gone a little deeper into the Panthers as a whole but knowing the Hollywood establishment, I'm sure the Van Peebles didn't have the luxurious studio budget afforded their white counterparts to make the movie they probably intended on making.  Still a keeper and a collector's item and indeed true American history.",1076457600,19,1875,4.765432098765432

This movie places great emphasis of how our cultural world exploits, degrades, and humiliates the AFRICAN-AMERICAN people, through the eyes of the government.

When the movie came out, I never knew half of things about the BPP from what I was taught in school, in our history books.  I felt Mario Van Peebles did an excellent job on the movie, he obviously could not capture all the events.  But, he did capture the main turnkey events.

Sure, it takes some liberties in simplifying things but people don't seem to make that criticism when it supports their political views ... such are the realities of the narrative form necessary to movies, novels, etc.  This isn't a dry, academic account.  It asks you to identify with the Black characters in this film, and not with the FBI oreo or the white pigs.  There are some elements here of the blaxploitation genre, of which Melvin Van Peebles (with his ""Sweet Sweetback's Baaadaaassss Song"") was an, or should I say THE, originator.  No one would accuse ""Sweetback"" of being an ""objective"" account but it does grasp something real in the experience of Blacks in Amerikkka.  The soundtrack CD to this movie, and the CD ""Pump Ya Fist"" (co-produced by Mario Van Peebles) are also essential!!!",984096000,11,873,4.786666666666667

From the first minute brother Hughie called a pig  ""a pig"" the movie put chills through my body.  Let me keep it  real for all those reviews that are sleeping on Panther... you see, Panther  wasn't about shooting cop's, no no, it was about getting a mans attention.  That's what Mario Van Pebbles does, he grabs you and leads you into a  story, a place where people have no choice but to put aside their fears and  do what they feel in their heart is right.  You do not have to wear a  dasheeky to be proud of what those young brothers in Panther accomplish.  The Panthers set the stage for some control on authorities who are out of  control.  Police brutality has not ceased, nor will it ever cease, however  the more people stand up for themselves as a communinity the more humanity  we will all have. Hats off to Mario Van Pebbles who is not afraid to  portray to the masses what most other medians of communication are afraid  to say.  That the government tried to contain the Black Panthers by pumping  cheap dope into the gettos.  Little did the government know that the dope  was gonna spread like wild fire right into the arms of some of their own  children.  From start to finish Panther beautifully spins a story of people  who overcome the overseers and rise as one to accomplish justice.  A must  buy to watch over and over again.

695719,4,6303620264,"Panther, 1995 film

It begins with news films from the 1960s about civil rights demonstrators. How did the Panthers start? For self-defense in Oakland California in 1967. They show scenes in the Black Ghetto. A boy on a bicycle is hit by a car and dies. They want a stoplight at this street corner. People hold a protest march in the street; police cars arrive and order them to disperse. The police use their batons to arrest marchers. Will prayer work? Or organize to protect themselves with guns? People act at a stoplight. The FBI will help local authorities. They meet men from San Francisco. They sell Little Red Books. They want the Government to serve the people. Armed men use their Constitutional Right to Bear Arms and witness police brutality. The police leave. Member of the Black Panther Party must remain clean and sober. LBJ invades Cambodia. The BPP visit a magazine office.

In 1967 Richmond California the police shoot a man. Can they do something? All power to the people. This man was crippled, his hands were up (says the coroner). Under California law people could carry firearms anywhere (as long as they were unloaded). Will this law be changed? Huey asks the Judge to be a double agent supplying the police with controlled information. The BPP demonstrates at the State Capital against a law that would disarm them. [Is this counter-productive?] This got world-wide attention. The FBI will investigate (COINTELPRO). The informer is convinced to set up the BPP for a conviction. New chapters are formed on the East Coast. They are urged to avoid drugs. A suspected informer is roughly handled. A man robs a filling station, the police cars arrive on time. But there is a problem with identification, they are released. There is a protest at the Oakland Induction Center. They oppose the War in Vietnam and want better economic conditions. The FBI has a Special Agent who will take action against the BPP nation-wide. Huey P. Newton is stopped and then shot! Their power base continued to grow.

Martin L. King was assassinated in Memphis. There were demonstrations and riots in many cities. Can they stay cool against superior forces? Some members shoot up police cars! A provocation? Two shooters are shot when they surrender. Mr. Hoover wants the BPP neutralized. Will selling heroin in the Black Ghetto do this? There is a protest to free Huey P. Newton at the Alameda County Court House. There is a surprise witness at the trial. Will cheap dope pacify the Ghetto? [Who really supplies and controls the dope trade?] Can it be stopped? Will the FBI betray Judge? Will they create dissension in the BPP? They learn about a warehouse and go to destroy the heroin there. There is a lot of shooting. The BPP continued their good work until they were suppressed. There were 300,000 addicts in 1970, in 1995 there were 3 million! [Was the war in Afghanistan fought to get control of the opium trade?]

This is an interesting movie about events from fifty years ago. Its a good drama, but its not a history book. I wonder how accurate all the scenes were? The ending credits say this is a dramatization of certain scenes. What has changed since then? Income Inequality since 1969 has increased, factories have been shut down and jobs sent offshore. A 30% tariff on imported goods and services would recover lost taxes and allow a higher Standard Deduction for most people. Bringing back jobs would reduce poverty. Democracy required more Income Equality.",1457222400,2,3475,4.8352941176470585

Black boys have been killing each other and have been the victim of police brutality. Neither situation is good, but sadly it's true. Young Black/African-Americans need to see pictures like this! This was based on truth. It's a history that the industry despised. I remember this movie from my childhood. I also remember that it was taking out of all the movie theaters around Detroit, MI shortly after it's release. This movie should be shown just as much any other historical based movies the U.S. Other movies should be shown also like Ben Carson story, Malcolm X, And any other movie that shows how discrimination looked and still looks today. Our society has tried to numb itself to these type of issues. But the minorities all experience these situations in places and even white men and women may face the same discrimination.

695808,4,6303620264,"What an unbelievably harsh and unfair Amazon.com ""official"" review up there.  Recent events have demonstrated why this is an important film that depicts a serious problem that has not gone away in this country, the problem of police violence toward minority communities and how ""trial by cop"" has replaced true justice for many citizens of color.  In the 1960s, black militancy in the form of the Black Panther Party of Self Defense and their manifesto of community policing and community responsibility was an understandable and in many ways laudatory reaction to the historical oppression of black neighborhoods. This movie shows how and why  the Black Panther movement came to be (based in large measure on real events and real people such as Huey Newton and Bobby Seale)  and the parallels to the situation today are striking. Black men (and not only black men, but hispanics as well) are still more likely to be shot down by  trigger-happy cops who seldom answer for their actions. As America lurches toward a plutocratic police state, democracy all but dead,  the poor  increasingly isolated, demoralized, distracted,  and disenfranchised, we can learn valuable lessons from this not-so-distant period. No one can turn the other cheek forever, nor should anyone be asked to.  Imagine if men and women of color today were to exercise THEIR Second Amendment rights and ""open carry"" laws in the way the right-wing militia movement has, only in defense of their civil rights, their communities, and their dignity.  The one percent would have nightmares.  May the spirit of the original, true Black Panther Party rise again!

It's unfathomable why this movie is not available on DVD. I suspect there are copyright issues involved, squabbles over royalties and percentages -- but its current lack of ready availability only fuels conspiracy theories about ""who"" is keeping this movie that celebrates black resistance to injustice off the market.",1407888000,10,1945,5.178913738019169

Some individuals like to feel superior to others and they will do everything in their power to keep you down forever.  The issue of slavery and the negative effects of it on both the slaves and the perpetrators of slavery has never ever been dealt with to this day.  Consequently, both races of people suffer.  One group suffer from having a false superiority complex and the other group suffers from having a negative self destructive complex because he views himself as not being equal and not being good, something ingrained in him from the first day he set foot on the American shores.

As a teacher, I found this film useful in conjunction with Eyes on the Prize footage, Black Panther documents/readings and the book, The Rock & The River by Kekla Magoon (talks mostly about the BPP in Chicago).

It's not a documentary and it never professed to be, but it coincides with the Eyes on the Prize interview clips with FBI Informant William O'Neal. The Kadeem Hardison character in this movie was an informant.

It presents a good overview of the ways in which the Black community united on some issues and were divided in other ways - which happened in real life. I think if you are watching it looking to be fully educated in an hour and a half then you are going about it all wrong.  This is a good supplement at the end of a thorough...or somewhat thorough investigation into Panther history - in Oakland, Chicago or whatever office you choose to focus on.

696048,4,6303620264,"This movie came and went during its run in theaters due to its nature. But I feel that it was an honest attempt to tell the story of the most controversial party in America: the Black Panthers.

The story is based on the Panthers and how they came to be. The party gets frustrated with the police brutality in America and decide to defend themselves with weaponry.

The acting is pretty good all around: Marcus Chong is great as Huey P Newton, Judge is Kadeem Hardison's best performance on screen point blank period. The same goes for Bokeem Woodbine's character in this movie. The only flaw is that they leave out a few key elements that lead to their downfall but other than that I have no real gripe with this film. I thought that Mario Van Peebles did the best he could with the material he was given but we have to understand that movies are edited just like books are edited so certain information that might have made a difference in the story. You can always read about the Black Panthers if you want to know more about them. This movie is worthy of being in your collection despite the little flaws. If you can find it at a reasonable price, you can definitely check it out.

PS: to the sellers who are selling it for 164 and up are you high? Is the DVD made out of solid gold? Does it come with a Rolex watch? Thats grimy as hell man. No wonder people hate to buy films that are hard to find on here!",1228003200,13,1411,4.257462686567164

It's based more on Mario's book than on what really happened.  The real Panthers were a lot more organized and a lot more diciplined than they are portrayed in this movie.  The movie it self is a good vehicle for giving some indication about where the Panthers were coming from, but in final analysis it only scratched the surface and never got to the nitty or the gritty.  Too Holywood.  I highly recommend ""Public Enemy"".  It's a documentary which is fully endorsed by Bobby Seale and made available on his website.  Real Deal, sho nuff.

Its a shame, because some of the performances are quite good.  Peebles really missed his chance here to make a definitive, grand statement about the Black Panthers.
