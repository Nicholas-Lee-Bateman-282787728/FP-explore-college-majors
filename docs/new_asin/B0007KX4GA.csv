8047816,4,B0007KX4GA,"A wonderful look into some of the most revered distilleries on Islay. The personalities of the individual distillers is revealed through the interviews, and that is pleasant indeed. There is none of the snobbery that seems to be associated with Scotch whisky in general, and yet the excellent craftsmanship shines through. Highly recommended to anyone who loves an Islay malt, and who is curious about its origins.",1167350400,4,414,5.1940298507462686
