8373898,4,B002MHQWH4,"This is a Grapevine DVD-R release, and an entertaining Richard Barthlemass feature.  The quality is good for an unrestored silent film.  The intertitles are sometimes a bit dark, but otherwise I'm pleased with the overall film.  All titles look original(I would rather have the original intertitles than re-done ones by some moron who makes changes to the words like some do).  But, it's an entertaining film about a cavalryman Lt., a bandit, and a girl.",1379894400,2,454,5.013333333333334
