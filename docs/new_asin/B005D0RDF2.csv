4655183,5,B005D0RDF2,I am as always very impressed by Jacobovici's amazing and fresh take on history. He is fearless in pursuit of the real facts.,1368316800,,125,4.478260869565218
4655184,5,B005D0RDF2,"There are others' whom have gone in depth with these DVDs.  So, I'm only going to share that it's beautiful how it's shown than Christians are actually Pagans yet most Christians have NO IDEA of how the Bible has come to Be.  I was born remembering a lot of this stuff from Past Lives and it's really nice to see Great Research being done and the Truth about History being shown.

 It's truly Awesome that info about Mithra is also becoming better known.",1365033600,,454,4.433734939759036
4655185,5,B005D0RDF2,"As a Believer in Yeshua/Jesus, this was very helpful in understanding how Constantine turned the Christianity at that time in an anti-Jewish, church-state pagan filled atrocity to the Christianity of Yeshua and the Apostles.  He gives good challenges and interesting thoughts on it. Great for anyone who would not be against someone challenging Constantine.",1355961600,,357,5.611111111111111
4655186,5,B005D0RDF2,Enjoyed these dvd's very much. Very thought provoking. Learned a good deal. Made some things from the Bible make sense.,1354579200,,119,5.0
4655187,5,B005D0RDF2,"While certainly no Michael Wood, the presenter outlined theories that seem plausible and interesting.  I look forward to more from him.",1350691200,,135,5.428571428571429
4655188,5,B005D0RDF2,"the approach on this DVD is eye-opening. anyone who knows scripture will be given reason to pause and take a long look at what we have been taught all these years. it may not change hearts and minds, but the way he breaks down these subjects will give us new insight into a lot of things that we have taken for granted. this is a very neat series.",1346976000,,347,4.117647058823529
4655189,3,B005D0RDF2,"The 411:

Did Jesus travel by boat to the Land of Gadarene? In the first part of the DVD, we head to Gadarene where investigators inspect a boat located and believed to be the boat that Jesus and the Disciples traveled in.  This is where it gets good. We see a replica boat, people aboard as the journalists asks if it is possible for Jesus to have slept while on this trip. The story obviously has holes as the archeologist explains what a moment aboard the ship would have been like. There would be no sleeping during a ""tempest"". This sets the mood for the rest of the DVD that goes on to
debunking various moments of the bible.  Real experiments done using real locations in the bible.

We all want to believe in the words of the bible. What the segment does is try establish truth in the historical words that millions believe in. As someone with limited knowledge of the details in the bible I believe that the world was different then. They kept talking about the sea being very far from the location of Gadara but I believe as one of the Archaeologists says, it is a miracle and we can't pinpoint and scrutinize every single word.

While I appreciate the well made documentary, I refuse to believe that everything CAN be explained.  What annoyed me the most about this documentary was the smug face Simcha Jacobovici uses when he feels he has established inconsistencies.

The DVD for me was very controversial. It felt very bias and as if I was being spoon fed theories of  Simcha.",1321228800,12,1490,4.492592592592593
8466061,4,B005D0RDF2,"This is a 2 DVD set, about 5-1/2  hours long.  I really liked the first DVD.  It covered ""The Lost Voyage of Jesus"", whereby he puts out a plausible  theory that Jesus travelled to Spain.  I liked that he was looking for oral traditions to augment his theories...a lot of people totally discount these, but I think it points in a direction.  ""Vesuvius & The Fear of God"" & shows how this event may have helped to spread Christianity.  Finally ""The Nails of the Cross"".  This covers the tomb of High Priest Caiaphas.  There were 2 different boxes of bones in the tomb.  I thought this segment was a bit cheesy as he kept talking about that the nails found ""might be"" the nails of Jesus....yeah & the Vatican might be waiting for the return of an alien Christ  (they are obviously looking for something but that??)  OK so the nails are from that time period.  I did enjoy following how he tracked down the missing nails & his discussion about which box was that of THE biblical High Priest Caiaphas & points out that the fancy box was like that mentioned by Josephus but the plainer box more closely matches the Bible.  Scholars automatically decide, ""well Josephus said"", when in fact Josephus was only reporting oral tradition.  I know of one instance where he got it slightly wrong (He places Esther as being the wife of the son of Xerxes as opposed to being the wife of Xerxes himself)

OK Second disc I really liked ""The Roman Army's Secret Christians"".  He shows how very early on there is evidence of this.  It makes common sense that there MAY have been believers among the Roman soldiers right from the beginning.  They would have heard and/or witnessed the miracles, been around to hear the talk of the Resurrection & very well could have been in the crowd at Pentecost.  While modern Christians look at Peter & Paul, a large contingent, namely Jesus' family stayed behind in Palestine where the soldiers would have come into contact with them.  I found ""Selling Christianity"" to be eh.  I  wasn't that interested in the subject matter, combined with the fact that I broke my tailbone 2 months ago ... & after 5 hours of watching these DVD's my backside was ""talking"" to me.  Having gone to a Catholic school that prided themselves on their scholastic integrity, the nuns had not painted Constantine in a good light, so a lot of this information was not news to me but it might be really interesting to others.

The one show I disliked was ""The Messiah Before Jesus"".  Simcha Jacobovici's Jewishness comes through loud & clear.  The fact that there were 3 messianic people prior to Jesus.  He states that a particular person was Jesus' model for himself.  Never mind that the 3 previous messianic men were looking to be overthrow Rome & not a spiritual king.  Let's not discuss miracles & the Resurrection.  This is not the place to discuss such things, just a heads up as to how ""The Messiah Before Jesus: leans.",1432684800,,2921,4.591876208897485
8466062,3,B005D0RDF2,It seemed lacking but definitely a good start in the field of religious history for an amateur such as I it seems.,1428537600,,114,4.2272727272727275
8466063,5,B005D0RDF2,This is one of the best documentary films I've ever watched.,1426377600,,60,4.545454545454546
8466064,5,B005D0RDF2,This show is worth your time and is informative. I recommend the naked archaeologist if you liked this show it is by the same award winning documentary film director Simcha. He Has interesting view of biblical archaeology.,1425168000,,222,5.027027027027027
8466065,5,B005D0RDF2,thank you for the dvd. love it,1419033600,,30,3.4285714285714284
8466066,3,B005D0RDF2,"Sorry, I don't recall getting it yet. But then I often put new books in the drawer and will read it later.",1407196800,,106,3.8636363636363638
8466067,5,B005D0RDF2,One of he best DVD for a short history of Christianity.  I rally enjoyed watching these and have passed them on for others to watch..,1402099200,,133,4.32
8466068,4,B005D0RDF2,I gave this as a gift. They called me several times to thank me. They really enjoyed it. Thank you,1393632000,,98,3.95
8466069,5,B005D0RDF2,I've studied the Bible for a long time I bought this for selling Christianity Constantine store with most Christians would understand what Constantine did to Christianity they would look deeper into the Bible to find out what true Christianity's I recommend this DVD set,1379635200,,270,5.159090909090909
8466070,1,B005D0RDF2,"It seems to me the author knows more about the Greek god ""Helios"" and the Roman god ""Sol"" (the personification of the physical earthly sun. These mythological beliefs were evident in Jesus' day. To be a ""christian"" means nothing more than inviting the living Christ Jesus into a person's heart as Lord,having fellowship with him,loving him and living according to His will and teachings. If a person doesn't receive this, then I question this DVD on saying it has ""the secret of christianity."" The physical sun will one day die, but the everlasting God who created the sun will never die. There were great influential scholars and religious leaders in Jesus time who were eye witnesses of the miracles that were performed through this man and they could not deny their existence. People kept the bible from being printed because they did not want the people to learn how to think for themselves and be free.",1378080000,9,907,4.82051282051282
