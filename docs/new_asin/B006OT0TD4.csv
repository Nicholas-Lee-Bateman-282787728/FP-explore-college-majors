5011086,1,B006OT0TD4,"As others have stated here, this laughably bad movie is also known as ""The Blood Waters of Dr. Z"" - It was featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000 in it's final season and it was in my opinion one of the funniest episodes of MST3K. Now I'm trying to imagine what it would be like to sit through this movie without the riffing of Mike Nelson, Crow and Servo. Should I pull the trigger and purchase it? The thing I like most about the movie is, in spite of the cheesy story, bad acting and amateurish FX, the Florida locations and the cinematography aren't half bad. At least they make the movie more watchable. But still, this a an awful movie. Time to go sashaying through the sargassum. ATTACK!!",1335916800,6,697,4.410852713178294
5011087,5,B006OT0TD4,"When I saw this was coming to Blu I just had to buy it.  This is a movie also known as The Blood Waters of Dr. Z.  A mad scientist, mad as in crazy not angry, though I suppose he may be angry that he only has on spray bottle to spray his poison all over the world.  It is a wildly insane movie and this Blu is a great copy.  Recommended.",1335484800,3,337,3.638888888888889
5011088,5,B006OT0TD4,"I was excited that Zaat finally made it to DVD... but I was totally blown away with the fact that it was a Blu-Ray DVD Combo.... Zaat in 1080p... Fans of cheesy low budget flicks will love Zaat... It is a throwback to the days of 1950's drive-in monster movies... Filmed in Jacksonville Florida, this movie has it all... Fans of MST3K will also know this as ""Blood Waters of Doctor Z""... Great Blu-ray features and excellent picture. The only complain is the commentary... It sounds like they recorded it in a windstorm on a cassette tape. Otherwise this Blu-ray/DVD combo is awesome for any cheese lover...",1334880000,5,607,4.682242990654205

5011090,5,B006OT0TD4,"ZAAT fans everywhere can finally breath a sigh of relief, everyone's favorite mutant human / giant catfish movie is finally available on home video and in a great new set that any fan will be proud to own.  The good people at CULTRA have teamed up with the movie's creators, Barton Films, and some dedicated ZAAT fans to bring you an eye popping new transfer of the film that looks even better today than it did in the theaters in the 70's (hey I was there, I saw it!).  Extras include the original theatrical and television trailers, a feature length commentary with Director Don Barton, Writer / Special Effects Coordinator Ron Kivett, Actor Paul Galloway, and Film Historian ED Tucker, an exhaustive stills gallery of publicty materials and behind the scens photos, and a 2001 radio interview with the actor who played the monster, Wade Popwell.  This 100% authorized release of the film is the one fans have been waiting on for years.  Unlike many of the reviews on Amazon, this one actually pretains to THIS edition of the film and I have reviewed screener copies of both the DVD and Blu-Ray versions of the disc courtesy of CULTRA.  This DVD / Blu-Ray Combo Pack is nothing at all like the catfish, but .......it's beautiful!

Check out [...] and ZAAT MOVIE on Facebook for more details and pictures of the product.  We have the DVDs in stock in our web store in a limited edition that includes an autographed photo.

Apparently you WWW can't mention ZAATMOVIE a website .COM in your review even if it is the official one for that movie!",1326931200,13,1543,4.647058823529412
5011091,5,B006OT0TD4,"In one wide shot of the creature returning to the lab, he's wearing tennis shoes. Woops!
But it doesn't stop there my friends. Nooooooo.
In the morgue scene the corpse breathes. Boom mics appear in various scenes. Apparently the production had a film editor, but nobody knows why. Pointless and downright silly narrative monologue at the beginning with bad folk music in the background. Crew shadows everywhere. Monster standing around waiting for cue. Hanna Barbara cartoon like sound effects. A monster that wears a Phillis Diller feather boa. NOBODY in the film can act. Miles of ""stock footage"" that sticks out like a goiter on a prom queen. One of the best scenes in the movie is when the monster is in the lab freaking out and tearing the place apart. He ""acts"" like a 3 year old birthday boy after somebody flicks a booger on his cake.

This movie has been described as;
* Deplorable
* Horrible
* Crap

And, it's HILARIOUS! An all time classic!

If you're a fan of bad (and I mean really bad) movies, you're going to love this! The HD 1080p transfer isn't like James Cameron going back with his touch as he did to Titanic. This transfer shows a little wear...and it actually enhances the retro experience. There's a restoration featurette on the Blu-ray that shows the sharpening, color correction and digital noise reduction they used and it's pretty impressive. This Blu-Ray version is guaranteed to be the best treatment you'll ever see given to this film and it looks pretty darn good, even on a projector screen.

Everybody knows the phrase ""B Movie"". Well, this is a Z Movie. And the Z is for, ZAAT!",1402358400,,1612,4.6855123674911665
5011092,3,B006OT0TD4,"If you really want to see this tripe?get Blood waters of Dr. Z.its the same movie. Zaat is the name of the formula he uses. This was one of those bad movies I saw in Theatre as a kid,where it was advertised no one allow in for last 15 mins. The last 15 mins.sucked too.",1392854400,,269,3.909090909090909
5011093,4,B006OT0TD4,"BOTTOM LINE: The fact that this abysmal, sub-Z clunker actually made it onto home video (and in Blu-ray, no less!) pretty much makes it a ""must-own"" for fans of cult classic trash. 5 STARS for the awesomely awful movie, minus 1 STAR for the over-scrubbed print quality.

THE STORY: A disgraced scientist working in the everglades dreams of turning himself & the tasty female of his choice into hybrid catfish people so that they can rule the world. He also plans to turn everyone else into catfish mutants so that we can all live together in aquatic harmony. (No word on whether Catfish Hunter thought this was a good idea or not.) A scientific investigation agency sends in a trio of good guy scientist types, (picture a mix of X-files, the Scooby-Doo gang, and the G.I. Joe Adventure Team), to get to the bottom of the dastardly goings-on before it's *GASP!* too late!

THOUGHTS: ZAAT (aka ""The Bloodwaters of Dr. Z"") is a dreadfully bad movie, make no mistake about it. Luckily, it's one of those that's so bad it's good. You have to wonder just what these folks were thinking (or smoking) when they dreamed this mess up. It's also available as a release as one of the 'experiments' on Mystery Science Theater 3000, and it's even funnier when it's getting torn a new one. Either way, ZAAT is a helluva weird viewing experience.

THE BLU-RAY: The release of this oddball clunker on Blu-ray is cause for both great joy & great sadness. On one hand it's cause for euphoric celebration because bad movie lovers like myself would never have believed in our wildest dreams that we'd EVER see this misfit motion picture receive a legit release. There are some nice bonus features as well. One the other hand, this Blu-ray is cause for heart-breaking misery because Cultra, the company that produced this release, utilized DNR (digital noise reduction) to make the transfer look cleaner, which isn't unusual. The problem is that they went waaay overboard when they selected the amount of reduction to use. The video portion has been digitally over-processed to the point where a lot of detail has been lost. The end result gives everyone & everything the strange appearance of being coated in a thin layer of Vaseline. I still have my old VHS tape of ZAAT that I made decades ago from a late-night TV broadcast and I can say for certain that ZAAT has the typical amount of  graininess & imperfections you'd expect from a 40+ year old independent no-budget monster movie. It's a huge bummer that smarter heads didn't prevail during the remastering process. Regardless, this is probably the only shot ZAAT will have as a legitimate release, so you'll have to man up and take your lumps if you want to own it.",1390089600,10,2701,4.716101694915254
5011094,5,B006OT0TD4,"Excellent picture and sound quality.  Loved this movie.  Very glad it came out on video.  If you like those cheaply made monster movies of long ago, add this one to your list.",1375574400,,175,4.40625
5011095,5,B006OT0TD4,"The eeevil Dr. Leopold turns himself into a walking-catfish-man(!!), and goes on a murderous rampage. In his quest for world domination, he captures a hippie chick, tries to turn her into his mate, and kills her instead. More murders ensue, as Leopold is hell-bent on wiping out humanity and creating a race of his own kind. Meanwhile, a hick sheriff and his assistant are on the doctor's trail. ZAAT (aka: BLOOD WATERS OF DR. Z) is about as brain-cell-obliterating as a movie can get. If you value your IQ level, then you might want to hold off on subjecting your grey matter to this baby! Start out w/ something harmless, like ATTACK OF THE GIANT LEECHES or HUMANOIDS FROM THE DEEP. Then, move on to TRACK OF THE MOONBEAST or OCTAMAN. After this preparation, ZAAT should only cause minor brain cancer. Please, proceed w/ extreme caution!...",1364774400,4,842,4.773972602739726

5011097,5,B006OT0TD4,"Is this movie silly??? Yes it is. But that's the whole point. People that run this movie down,just don't get,that this is not supposed to be taken seriously. It's a cheesy,cheap,crumby horror flick...and that's why we(the fans of Zaat) like it so much. A far fetched story about a mad scientist turning himself into some kind of ""fish monster"" is enough to crack ANYBODY up. Unfortunatly,alot of viewers watch Zaat,with hopes of this being some kind of big budget horror masterpiece or something. If you're looking for a movie like that,then look elsewhere. Zaat is not for you. Overall,this is a great movie to own,if you love the so bad it's good kinds of movies,and for those of you that wanna hate on this cult gem....don't put down what you don't understand.",1360454400,,763,4.787878787878788
5011098,1,B006OT0TD4,"What horrifying creature will be unleashed when Nazi scientist Dr. Kurt Leopold injects himself with his own sinister serum, ZAAT? Half man, half catfish, ALL TERROR! The mad mutant monster sets off into the Everglades to spread his pollution with the intent of taking over not just all of Southern Florida, but the entire universe!! What is ZAAT, exactly? A mind-blowingly absurd and absolutely horrendous creature-feature that throws back to the ""Do It Yourself"" Horror films of Roger Corman. After seeing ZAAT, one would welcome the CREATURE FROM THE HAUNTED SEA any day, as Dr. Leopold's mutant form look more like a cross-breed between a baboon and a mossy green turd than a catfish. The film is a failure on all fronts, and it would be completely unwatchable were it not for the fact that the audience becomes glued to the screen, wondering where the hell the plot could possibly go next? At one point, the monster attempts to take a mate (with deadly results), and later, the town sheriff punishes us by making us listen to a full fifteen-minutes of terrible folk singing before locking the group up for their own protection. Despite the film's recent rediscovery and remastering, ZAAT is sure to fall right back into obscurity where it belongs, far away from the young, impressionable minds that might mistake this for Horror.

8502208,4,B006OT0TD4,"Zaat is one of those horrible ""B"" movies that are fun because they're so bad.  The quality of the print is a little disappointing for a Blu-Ray, but that doesn't distract from the movie too much since it is also of very poor quality.  I've been told the studio involved primarily made industrial films, and decided to try their hand at a ""horror"" flick.  I'm thinking they were told not to quit their day job, because as far as I know this was a one shot deal.  Zaat is so bad it's funny, featuring a 'Sleepless in Florida' fish monster that trips over objects, is seen wearing tennis shoes in one shot, and can barely swim.  You'll want to have a group of friends and plenty of adult beverages over for ""Bad Movie Night"" to fully appreciate the cheezy sets, lame dialog, amateurish acting, and continuity issues such as different women being featured from one scene to another.

Talon: I went into Zaat with some-what high expectations. It already had a fascinating title, with the tag line:

""Is the monster man...fish...Or devil?""

Spoiler alert:

Zaat's a man in a costume.

Looking at the Blu-ray cover I figured, what the hell, maybe this so called ""bad movie"" doesn't need to be on my blog. Maybe this movie was a classic, and everyone who saw it was a mad jealous hater, hating on its awesomeness and perfection.

Turns out, it's not awesome nor perfection. But I guess you could call it a classic because it was made in 1971.

Joe: ZAAT might be the worst film I've ever seen. And it wasn't a ""so bad it's good"" kind of bad. It was a ""so bad I'd rather get a colonoscopy without anesthesia than watch another minute"" bad.

Talon: Here's some of the dialog my dad and I had while viewing. Try to imagine some of our phrases as catchy slogans:

""No! Oh, no! Don't attack me monster man...fish...or devil!""

""I like the part when he's walking.""
""That's half the movie!""

""What are ocean fish doing in a pond?""

""The seventy thousand all went to paying for stock footage.""

""Okay, this is the worst movie of all time.""
""Agreed.""

""I can't. I just can't.""",1484611200,2,1579,5.721030042918455
8502211,5,B006OT0TD4,"F*** you, Pulp Fiction. Eat a bucket of di***, Shawshank Redemption. The Sixth what?  Did Andy have to fight walking catfish that he ran into, while crawling through that sewer, in order to achieve his freedom? God, I only wish. Did Frodo turn into a murderous fish-man thing who pollutes the rivers, in order to create a mutant fish-man army in order to achieve world domination against those f*****g Orcs, fighting for Sauroni? If it did, I think we would have seen more sequels. Did Bruce Willis turn out to be a fish-man in the end? Of course not. That would have been the best ending ever.

""One of the most incredible stories of modern time.""  That's what the guy narrating the trailer says, and oh my god, does he speak truth!.There is only Zaat. All other movies can burn in an eternal lake of fire and damnation. THIS MOVIE IS MY ONLY REASON FOR LIVING! It's pure perfection in every possible way. If I could be intimate with this movie, do you think I'd be taking the time to write this review? Buy this movie, now. Put it in your life. Let it BECOME your life.
