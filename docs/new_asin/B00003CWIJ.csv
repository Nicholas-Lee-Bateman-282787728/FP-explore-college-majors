Okay I admit, I enjoy watching toons in general.  But this was probably one of the worst!  It has too much adult story for it to be a child's movie, and yet not enough production quality for it to be a decent movie.  The animation is so bad I have seen 1950's cartoons with better animation.  It reminds of me of those Christian cartoons designed to teach the bible.  But at least those have a purpose.  This dvd doesn't.

I recommend you select an alternative dvd to this one!",1113782400,2,691,4.12781954887218
