3050437,4,B0010V4VKS,This film had some great footage and information. The only thing I was slightly disappointed in was that almost half of the movie was about humans climbing to the summit. I was expecting the film to just be about Alaska and it's wildlife. Still great since I viewed it for free with Prime,1302048000,6,288,4.452830188679245
3050438,5,B0010V4VKS,"Nature is always in control. Nowhere is this more evident than in Denali. NatGeo takes you on a guided tour of the three distinct regions of Denali National Park, from the forest, through the tundra, culminating at the summit of Mt. McKinley, the highest place in North America. Beautifully filmed and narrated, ""Extreme Alaska"" is both educational and entertaining.

There were no technical issues viewing this film via streaming. The quality of the film is what we've come to expect from the fine folks at National Geographic. Beautiful photography paired with soothing, educational narration, capturing our attention from beginning to end.

""Extreme Alaska"" is a wonderful film. Enough said.",1298505600,3,694,5.3577981651376145

3050442,4,B0010V4VKS,"This video includes excellent scenery and computer-generated videos that provide nice visual aid. These visual aides and the facts given by the narrator deliver on the National Geographic credibility you have come to expect. It includes wildlife in the Denali area, including two moose battling for a mate, as well as a brown bear cub taking out a caribou. The wildlife portion takes up about half of the video, about 25 minutes or so. The second half of this DVD shows a group of eight individuals who are climbing Mt. Mckinley. This gives an additional viewpoint of the Denali area for those who seek challenging ventures.

The cons about this video are that I would have liked to see a longer wildlife portion, and it is not a very long video altogether (50 minutes), so the $18 price tag seems a bit much. If you are interested in Alaska, the arctic, national parks, mountain trekking, and wildlife, this is a good movie for you.",1212883200,17,933,4.689024390243903
3050443,3,B0010V4VKS,"This work offers something for multiple audiences.  Animal lovers and younger people may like seeing baby mountain goats and arctic squirrels.  For guys, climbing Denali Mountain is presented like it was an extreme sport.  Technically, this mountain is not the only place to see aurora borealis, but like The Simpsons' Superintendent Chalmers, seeing that phenomenon really excited me.  The Jungian in me didn't like seeing all those artic worms, to be honest.
I've see many discs in the NG series where they have an additional smaller documentary available on the larger one.  This did not.  I strongly believe that all DVDs should have foreign language subtitles and this disc is lacking that helpful feature.",1210809600,7,711,5.192982456140351

8238607,3,B0010V4VKS,"""Extreme Alaska"" takes a look at the Alaskan outdoors, more specifically Denali National Park.  Within this documentary, there are various history lessons that help for you to understand how Denali became a National Park. Also, there are various scenes that show the beautiful animals that inhabit this territory some of which include: grizzly bears, moose, wolves and ice worms.  Honestly the most interesting part of the documentary was a beetle that allows itself to be frozen for the winter and then thaws out for the spring.

Included in the DVD is a segment where eight individuals attempt to climb Mt. McKinley.  This gives a deeper understanding of the differences between how an animal views Denali and how a human views it.

My only qualm with the DVD is the length.  I would have liked to see more focus on the animals themselves as well as the landscape around Alaska, rather than the eight individuals, but overall this documentary was pretty well made.

I give this documentary 3 out of 5 stars.",1351555200,,1009,4.8654970760233915
8238608,3,B0010V4VKS,The views are breathtaking. The animal abundance and variety interesting. The difference between the lower praries and the highest peaks was like nowhere else on the planet. It did drag a little too long.,1341446400,,204,5.029411764705882
8238609,1,B0010V4VKS,"Good God this documentary is terrible.  What wrecks it for me?  Instead of a well thought out narrative about the history, animals, features and other qualities of Denali National Park in Alaska; we get this constant bombardment of movie-preview danger narrative with creepy horror film music.  What do I mean?  Well the whole time you will hear 45 minutes straight of a low, raspy, action movie voice narrator saying stuff ""extreme"" like: (Just say these things to yourself in the voice I described)

- In this dangerous wilderness, only the most extreme creatures endure
- Surrounded by danger, it is no place for a faint heart
- So hostile, no being can barely survive, and so extreme, the temperature will freeze you
- Open space so dangerous, you will be prey to extreme predators
- The mountain, so dangerous, it determines what it takes to survive!
- The alpine region, survival here is so bad, it feels like the end of the world
- The tundra, the open country....you can run, but you can't hide from your predators!
- The moose, so dangerous, backpackers have near-death experiences with them.  (I'm not making this up, they go out of their way to talk about near-death experiences with moose, instead of something more educational, rather than Hollywood style)
- The ice worm, humans would DIE in the same extreme conditions that these ice worms endure. (Seriously)

I mean seriously, this is the entirety of the documentary. It is a garbage ""extreme"" narrative like this, in low raspy voice.  Absolute garbage.  Ditch this crap documentary.  I wish Nat Geo would avoid the whole style, movie preview, try to grab your attention with extreme narrative with something more well thought out more and meaningful....but...

""But my hope, so extreme, that the very walls of my imagination crumble at the mere sign of it, that most humans can't possibly endure.""  Wow, I should write for National Geographic.",1326067200,10,1911,4.900621118012422
