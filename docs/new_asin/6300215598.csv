244123,5,6300215598,"This was an impulse buy. The name Audrey Hepburn sold it to me, and Fred Astaire was an extra bonus. I went home and popped it in the VCR, not knowing what to expect. Would be be a great movie or just another dust  collector?
I'll take the first one.
This movie was phenomonal. I can't  see why it wasn't produced on stage, as it was originally intended to,  because it is just one of those amazing feel good musicals with great music  by those uncanny Gershwins. Audrey Hepburn played the part of Jo perfectly,  but a lot of people complained about her singing. Sure, she didn't do too  great, but she has always been noted to have been extremely insecure of  that voice. You could tell she had it in her, just because you could hear  it underneath that gentle coating she put on for her first solo. Fred  Astaire doesn't need to be commented on, being that he gave the same kind  of performance that every actor/singer would want to be remembered for.  Together, the two were an sensational duo, and the ending only leaves you  with a warm fuzzy feeling. Supporting the two leads is the great Kay  Thompson. As the unsinkable and head strong editor of `Quality', she gives  a performance that shows she belongs with the big-shots like Hepburn and  Astaire. As a trio, especially in their sight-seeing number in Paris, they  make the pieces fit together so well that it seems no one else should ever  be allowed to touch the parts.
The script was great. Taking the three  heros from busy New York to beautiful Paris for an adventure in modeling  and philosophy, it develpps each of them - Hepburn and Astaire moreso than  Thompson - to make them more human. When combined with the toe-tapping,  finger-snapping music by George and Ira, this movie can only be called  S'Wonderful.",961027200,2,1780,4.5664556962025316

Hepburn plays an intelligent, but  un-fashionable girl who is spotted by fashion magazine photographer  Astaire. Despite her first rejections she is taken away to Paris where she  and Astaire fall in love. Sure, the story has been done before, but Astaire  and Hepburn make it so absolutely charming that you can't help but smile. I  loved how Hepburn's character was not only elegant and beautiful, but  intelligent and artsy as well. My favorite part is when Hepburn starts  dancing in the Paris club, she was an amazing dancer. The Gerswhin music  was another great touch. I have to agree with the reviewer below mine, I'm  14 and I would prefer a classic like this to any of that teen-flick junk we  get.

Just watch Audrey Hepburn express herself or, ""release herself"" as she said in the film, in a Bohemian modern ballet solo, called ""Basal Metabolism"".  It is so  cool and lively that would surprise any teenager today.  It is timeless  because it so stylish and chic.  It reminds me of Michael Jackson's black  tights with white socks; maybe he was inspired by Ms. Hepburn.  And the  beat of the music to which she performs is so good that it perfectly  describes the ""existentialist"" atmosphere of the  sourroundings.
Ms. Hepburn shows that she can sing and dance with the  same charming appeal as when she is acting. There is something special,  ethereal in her limpid dancing and low note singing.
Funny Face, really  stands out from the typical musical of the 40's and 50's because of the  superb performance of the three leading stars, the legendary and modern  music and lyrics, and the stylish choreography, all under the skillful  direction of Stanley Donen.",935971200,3,997,4.880239520958084

244207,5,6300215598,"Funny Face has gotten rather mixed reviews over the years, with many feeling that with this cast and production team it should have been one of the greatest musical films of all time. Well, maybe it's not quite all that, but what it is , is a wonderfully entertaining musical with an exceptional cast, mostly Gershwin tunes and Paris as its primary setting (and being the Fifties, it actually went there). It lightly spoofs High Fashion and the world of bohemia and existentialism, and some critics took exception to the latter, but the platitudes and lifestyle of  that subculture were open targets for satire. Finally, some object to the romance between Audrey and Fred. even I find this a bt odd, but it was a convention of the musical and I accept it as just that. In her early years Audrey would also find film romance with Humphrey Bogart and Gary Cooper, both of whom were also thirty years older than Audrey. It was really a case of Paramount announcing their new star by putting her in films with the top A-list actors. Audrey, in fact, asked for Fred Astaire for Funny face.

Paramount was very possessive of Audrey and wouldn't lend her out to other studios, but wasn't known for making musicals at all. Funny Face was made mostly by a production team from MGM's famous Freed unit, including producer roger Edens, director Stanley Donen and vocal director and coach Kay Thompson in a rare screen appearance. The film was adapted from the original Funny Face, a 1927 Broadway show by the Gershwin's. As those shows were, Funny Face was practically a revue with the flimsiest plot about a stolen necklace. So everything ws reimagined into this colorful ode to Paris and Audrey.

Highlights include the wonderfully funny opening number, Think Pink, a bravura performance by Kay Thompson that spoofs the fashion world with a clever opening, freeze frames and a cameo by 50's top model Suzy Parker.  Everyone gets going in Bonjour Paris, with Audrey, Fred and Kay each exploring their fantasy of the city. Fred does a great solo dance number in a courtyard, and Audrey does a modern dance number in a coffeehouse. Audrey gets many special moments in a montage of her photo shoot in many Parisian locales, most famously running down the steps of the Louvre with the winged Victory of Samothrace behind and above her.

There's a lot to like in Funny Face.",1470441600,3,2359,4.7439024390243905

244307,5,6300215598,"This rather cryptic exchange occurs between top fashion photographer Dick Avery (Fred Astaire) and fledgling young model Jo Stockton (Audrey Hepburn) on a platform at the Gare du Nord train station in Paris.  Shes poised besides a locomotive in a couture suit and hat preparing to be photographed while he gives her guidance for the proper mood he wants to capture.  This is from Funny Face, a beguiling musical starring the incomparable Audrey Hepburn and the debonair Fred Astaire.

Heres a brief synopsis to pique your interest:  Celebrated photographer Dick Avery (Fred Astaire) on a location shoot for Quality fashion magazine in a Greenwich Village bookstore meets intellectual clerk Jo Stockton (Audrey Hepburn).  Despite Jos abhorrence of what she perceives as the frivolous world of fashion, Avery is intrigued by her spirit and intelligence, and Jo finds herself strangely drawn to Dick.  When the editor of Quality the irrepressible whirling dervish Maggie Prescott (Kay Thompson) comes up with a brainstorm to create the Quality Woman, Avery nominates Jo, recognizing the incipient swan under the black turtleneck, stockings and jumper.  Jo at first disbelieving & resistant, has a change of heart when Avery tells her she will get a free trip to Paris, where she may get to meet her idol, Professor Flostre (Michel Auclair), philosopher and Father of Empathicalism.  Maggie is skeptical, the Quality Woman is to represent everything the magazine stands for, and an exclusive wardrobe is to be designed for her by the greatest Parisian designer, Paul Duval (Robert Flemyng), but reluctantly agrees to use Jo.  Dick will of course photograph Jo in the collection in and around Paris, and so off the three go to Paris!

Interestingly, this film was originally intended to be an MGM musical, Fred Astaire, Kay Thompson, producer - composer Roger Edens, and director Stanley Donen were all either current or former MGM employees.  However, Paramount which had Audrey Hepburn under contract refused to loan her, but fortunately the entire creative team was able to move to Paramount en masse.  So, even though it was released through Paramount, it has the unmistakable stamp of MGM in the last golden years of the movie musical.  This is one of the most colorful of musicals, a vivid rainbow palette splashing across the screen.  A lot of the credit must go to superb photographer Richard Avedon, upon whom the character of Dick Avery is loosely based, who not only served as creative consultant, but actually staged and photographed the fashion sequence of Hepburn in her haute couture wardrobe.  This is the centerpiece of the film, and is very inspired, with locations in and around Paris at the Tuileries, the Palais Garnier (the Paris Opera House), the Louvre, and humbler but no less effective settings as a flower stall, and a barge on the Seine.

The musical score is a mixture of the old and new with such George and Ira Gershwin classics as Funny Face How Long Has This Been Going On?, He Loves and She Loves  and SWonderful, SMarvelous, mingled successfully with new songs by Roger Edens and Leonard Gershe such as Think Pink!, Bonjour, Paris! and On How to Be Lovely.  The Gershwin songbook is of course classic, no surprises there, but the new songs though not quite in that league are tuneful and snappy, and expertly staged by director Stanley Donen.  Mr. Donen, by the way does superb work pulling all the disparate elements into a cohesive exciting whole.  The script by Leonard Gershe, originally entitled ""Wedding Day"" is amusing and diverting, good naturedly poking fun at the fashion world,  ""Beatniks"" and the then current vogue for the ""existentialist"" movement.

I think this is my favorite of the Audrey Hepburn Cinderella films. Nobody did it better than Ms. Hepburn playing Cinderella; although it always is debatable whether she is more enchanting and delectable before or after her transformation.  The revelation here is her skill and talent in the singing and dancing departments.  She warbles in a throaty charming manner How Long Has This Been Going On? is gleefully joyous with Fred Astaire and Kay Thompson discovering the wonders of the City of Light in Bonjour, Paris! and brimming with bubbly self confidence  in her duet with Kay Thompson  as they explain On How to Be Lovely.  I think she surpasses the master Fred Astaire in her inspired dancing in this film.  Audrey Hepburn's original ambition was to be a ballerina, and although she had training and lessons as a dancer, World War ll interfered.  After it was over she was considered too tall and too old to be a classical dancer, so she had to jettison that dream and choose another path, lucky us!  She could be justly proud of her dancing here in Funny Face, her standout turn is Basal Metabolism, a number she does with two male dancers at a smoky, cavernous Parisian caf.  The choreography by Eugene Loring is incisive, deft and witty, and Hepburn delivers and then some.  She partners Astaire beautifully in the three numbers Funny Face, He Loves and She Loves, and SWonderful, SMarvelous.  In He Loves and She Loves with its  idyllic, pastoral setting in the French countryside clad in a gossamer, full skirted tulle three quarter length wedding gown with her swan neck and graceful extension of her slender arms she looks like she should be preforming in the second act of the classic ballet Giselle.

 Although in reality too old for Ms. Hepburns Jo, as Dick Avery,  Fred Astaire overcomes this with his usual savoir faire and panache and emerges a winner, but for me I would have been interested to see what Gene Kelly could have done with the role.  The real discovery is Kay Thompson as the over the top fashion Editor Maggie Prescott, who seems to be fueled on atomic energy.  Shes sharp, scintillating and hilarious; her character was loosely based on fashion doyenne Diana Vreeland who at that time was working at Harpers Bazaar, and allegedly not happy with Thompsons portrayal of her.  She's puts over her numbers with style and verve, particularly in  her ""Think Pink!' solo and her mock revival meeting duet with Astaire ""Clap Yo Hands!"".  Lesser roles are adequately done by Michel Auclair as Professor Emile Flostre and Robert Flemyng as designer Paul Duval.

I want to acknowledge two creative professionals who made immeasurable contributions to the film.  The first is the renowned designer Hubert de Givenchy who designs Audrey Hepburns Parisian haute couture wardrobe.  This film cemented the celebrated Hepburn-Givenchy collaboration in films which was to reach its apotheosis in the little black dress in Breakfast at Tiffanys.  The clothes he designs as Paul Duval for Jo Stockton are timeless and gorgeous and Hepburn is exquisite in them.  My two favorites are the gown she wears in the transformation scene, a slim  white satin evening  dress with a rose colored mantle draped  around her shoulders that flows into a cape which flares out in a perfect semi-circle behind her as she glides down a fashion runway.  The second  is a spectacular scarlet strapless chiffon  evening gown with matching stole that is worn in a memorably innovative sequence at the Louvre Museum.

The creativity of the Richard Avedon who was one of the most expert fashion photographers of this era is evident right from the beginning with the opening credits which use his photographs.  In the Think Pink number three of his favorite models Dovima, Suzy Parker and Sunny Harnett figure prominently.  In the fashion photography sequences, besides staging the photos and taking them, he shares a lot of clever, ingenious touches that are used to achieve an outstanding photograph.

Lets talk about the extras on the second disc.  The best is the feature Kay Thompson: Think Pink which tells more about this intriguing lady who besides this film is best known as the author of the marvelous Eloise series of books.  This is VistaVision the Paramount process of cinema photography developed in the 1950s to combat the threat of television, is interesting from a technical point of view.  I think The Fashion Designer and His Muse about the Hepburn/Givenchy collaboration is somewhat incomplete touching on their initial meeting for Sabrina and the work on Funny Face, later collaborations such as Breakfast at Tiffanys, Charade and How to Steal a Million aren't really discussed.  Parisian Dreams is about the role of Paris as almost a character in the film,  and I especially liked the ending of the trailer, which featured two different versions of two of the fashion sequences, the last of which I thought was better than the version used in the film.

 ""Funny Face' opened as the Easter attraction at  New York City's  Radio City Music Hall, a perfect choice, its sings of spring, sunny, fresh, airy and as colorful as an Easter egg!

244332,4,6300215598,"A very good musical with Fred Astaire and Audrey Hepburn romancing each other. It's excellent until about the mid-way mark. Then, with ""He Loves and She Loves,"" it becomes obvious that Astaire is way too old for this. In that number, he looks like Hepburn's grandfather! (The traveling shot where he walks her over to the tree while singing should have been retaken with Hepburn in front of him.) The movie sort of disintegrates into bits and pieces after that number. (Their spat is routine. ""Clap Yo' Hands"" doesn't really work on a plot level. Etc.) Things start to recover with the humorous Astaire-Flostre confrontation, and the film ends strong with ""'S Wonderful.""

What makes the movie is Hepburn's performance. Her singing is terrible, but her sincerity and emotion supercharge every scene she's in. Her acting lifts the movie up high. It must be said that Astaire's acting (in the first half) in unusually good. He is completely convincing as a super-confident cynical fashion photographer. But the romance story is the weakest part of his performance. He's more relaxed and has more chemistry with Kay Thompson than he has with Hepburn!",1437955200,,1147,5.005235602094241

Watching it, I could only think that we need more movies that entertain us. There are only a few I can think of but won't mention them here.

Audreys elegant but funny face gets her into a situation she wasn't anticipating, becoming a model. She agrees after listening to Freds characters telling her she can reach her goal of going to Paris.

If you didn't know, this is a love story with all the conflicts or the learning one goes through in a courtship. The movie ends as all musical love stories of that era  40s and 50s.

Hepburn an intellectual librarian and 2. a librarian who can switch to being a natural model with virtually no preparation.  I also found it silly that they said Hepburn had a 'funny face' when her face is obviously stunning.  Last there just wasn't a great message in this movie.

**Some spoilers below**

There was some room for turning this into a meaningful movie if they made more of a statement about a pretty woman not being taken seriously.  Instead her 'love' said about another man she asserted was interested in her intellect ""He's about as interested in your intellect as I am.""  And she ends up sticking with him without much concern.

What also could have helped is choosing different leads and tweaking the storyline at the end with the romantic drama.  A bit of jealousy didn't seem too great a threat to this relationship and wasn't too exciting.  I would have liked it more if the professor ended up being the guy who took her seriously for her intellect while the photographer was only concerned about her beauty, and she ended up choosing the professor.",1413417600,,1236,4.706976744186046

244530,4,6300215598,"Funny Face is a wonderful old movie to savor on a lazy Saturday (or whenever you happen to have a little down time).
Kay Thompson as the sophisticated, imperious editor-in-chief of an haute couture mag a la Vogue and Audrey Hepburn as the earnest wannabe intellectual who catches the mags photographers eye were both fabulous.  Audrey got to show off her marvelous dancing skills in a catchy jazz number at a tres intellectuel Paris coffeehouse, and I remembered, oh yeah, she dreamed of being a ballerina for many years but had lost too many years of precious prep during WWII.  Well Im here to say that her training paid off!
I also loved the parodies of the 50s Paris intellectual scene and even the crazy Clap Yo Hands number that Thompson and Fred Astaire pull off as they try to rescue Audrey from the French lothario she idolizes.  Sadly, the one fly in this delicious ointment is Fred Astaire.  Though he was one of the greatest dancers in cinema, at 58, he had a good 30 years on Audrey.  Even discounting the age difference, his American boy-next-store persona so did not really mesh with Audreys brand of mid-century international sophistication.  I did not buy for a minute that this beautiful young girl who breathlessly studied philosophy and dreamed of gay Paree would find love with this unassuming milquetoast, fashion photographer or not.

244770,5,6300215598,"Music by the Gershwins, costumes by Edith Head and Hubert de Givenchy, choreography by Fred Astaire, direction by Stanley Donen, luminescence by Audrey Hepburn- what's not to love about ""Funny Face""? This Blu-ray import from the UK is truly wonderful and its content from the last great decade of American studio musicals is truly marvelous.
When this film's star Audrey Hepburn began her film career, she had serious daddy issues on screen as a result of the choices made by her handlers. Fresh from her Oscar triumph in ""Roman Holiday"" (1953), Audrey was cast in ""Sabrina"" (1954), opposite two fellow Oscar winners, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden, one considerably older than she, the other not so much. In ""Funny Face"" (1957), Fred Astaire is definitely in the daddy category as was her co-star Gary Cooper in ""Love in the Afternoon"", made the same year. The pattern of putting the screen's eternal gamine opposite aging male superstars reached its apotheosis in ""Charade"" (1963), returning Audrey to Paris and her favorite designer Givenchy in the company of Cary Grant. In that film, the May-November romance is both mocked and fulfilled.
The formulae of classic American romantic comedy decreed the union of the above the title stars by film's end and so it is with ""Funny Face"". Audrey is afforded the opportunity to learn from America's foremost male film dancer, Astaire, in this eye-poppingly colorful rendition of classic Gershwin songs, grounded in an Oscar nominated, flimsy but serviceable script by Leonard Gershe. Hepburn and Astaire (""He Loves and She Loves"") must end up together, but the Astaire character's true soul mate is editor-in-chief Maggie Prescott, played with razor sharp wit and panache by Kay Thompson in a rare film performance.
Talk about strong women : the real life Anna Wintour and the fictional Miranda Priestly of ""The Devil Wears Prada""(2006) would be docile and conciliatory in comparison to the Kay Thompson character. No wonder she's shocked when Astaire announces his love for Hepburn. While many in the audience would share such a sentiment, lethal ambition, the desire to dominate (""Think Pink""), and impeccable taste have combined to make both editor and photographer the apogee of American fashion in the film's stylistic universe.
The film itself has been beautifully transferred to Blu-ray, using British spellings for the English subtitles (there are loads of aural options) and a tin ear for American slang (""bozazz"" for ""pizzazz""). While the quality of the flesh tones varies, none is particularly disturbing. The color palette (black was and still is the hipster color) and sound mixing are very true to the 1950's, with Donen's ""Singin' in the Rain"" (1952) being the template and Minnelli's ""Gigi"" (1958), the last hurrah.
The Parisian locations and the gorgeous costumes are worth are the purchase price by themselves. Those who have plowed through Jean Paul Sartre's ""Being and Nothingness"", either in the original French or in English translation, will hopefully have the sense of humor requisite to appreciate existentialist thought simplified into empathicalist feeling and its philosopher priest into a classic French roue.
""Bonjour Paris"" says it all- bonjour tous les artistes in the making of this exquisite film.",1403654400,,3281,5.239543726235741

I was disappointed by the film: Having read the synopsis on the Instant Video site, I expected a lot more.  The pluses: my favorite actress, Audrey Hepburn; the ultra urbane Fred Astaire; and the gorgeous clothes of the world of high fashion in the '50s.  The minuses: long, long songs (way too long, even though they were Gershwin tunes), interminable dance sequences and a poor excuse for a plot.  Audrey was a classically lovely woman; hers was anything but a funny face.  Furthermore, it strains credulity to have her fall in love with Astaire (who was the one with the funny face, if you think about it), especially when you realize that in 1957, when ""Funny Face"" came out, she was 28 and he was 58, and looked it.",1403568000,,810,4.52054794520548

Fred Astaire, who deserved top billing not second string, shows personality and charm that is sadly lacking in today's movie idols.

While not the best musical made in the 1950s, it has good songs, and a funny look at the ""beatnik generation"" that had its roots in Europe.",1401062400,,435,4.551282051282051

This was one of those...and it was a delight to see Audrey Hepburn seriously dancing (I didn't realize how many years of classical ballet training she had in her youth until I googled her -- and it really showed in this film).  That being said, this was not the biggest & brightest musical offering I've ever watched -- definitely not on par with say My Fair Lady.  But it was fun nonetheless -- even though Astaire didn't seem to be at the top of his game either. The clothes/costumes were great, and you can't beat those lovely Gershwin tunes.

244926,4,6300215598,"The greatest obstacle to get past in this movie is the alarming number of times in which they refer to Audrey Hepburn's face as ""funny.""  It never works to hire a beautiful woman to play someone who's not.  As though giving her a bad hairdo and shoving her into a dowdy dress is somehow going to mask her incredible bone structure!  That said this is an odd musical on many levels.  It's also a little creepy considering the vast age difference between Astaire and Hepburn (at a time when that wasn't considered chic).  No surprise, when the film was initially released it was a box-office disappointment, failing to break even.  On its rerelease, almost a decade later, it finally made a profit.  The fact that it isn't a conventional musical is the very reason I like this film (my favorite number is ""Clap Yo' Hands"").  I bought this movie primarily for Kay Thompson's performance.  I think she's hilarious and had the best lines in the film and knew exactly how to make the most of them (""I haven't seen a woman in two weeks in anything but pink.""  ""What about you?""  ""Me!  I wouldn't be caught dead!"").

The wonderful Kay Thompson, author of the ""Eloise"" books and also a delightful performer, leads us into this fun and colorful musical romp about opposites and attraction. The fashion world versus beatnik philosophy, old versus young, Paris versus NYC. Audrey Hepburn, a drab and very serious bookseller, is ""kidnapped"" in the name of fashion for her ""funny face"" after a chance discovery in the formerly safe refines of the bookstore she works in. As she struggles with this infringement on her identity, she becomes the new face of fashion and also finds herself falling in love with the color it adds to her life, mainly in the person of Fred Astaire, the free-wheeling professional magazine photographer who discovers her. She is whisked off to Paris and photographed in every famous venue and all manner of beautiful gowns you can think of. If you love Gershwin, if you love dancing, if you love silly romantic stories, this is the musical for you. Let's not judge the age difference, just go with the flow - it's Audrey and Fred!

245146,5,6300215598,"Funny Face may be the most unusual musical ever created.  It brings together 3 stars of wildly different temperaments.  Fred Astaire is the old veteran; he starred in the original Funny Face in the 1920s. (Apart from a few songs, the movie has nothing to do with the original Broadway musical, but is instead an original work of art.) And over the years his singing improved and his dancing is if anything smoother.  Audrey Hepburn is not known for her musical work, but actually she was a trained ballerina.  Her singing is adequate, but the Gershwin songs are wonderful, charter members of the great American Songbook.  And  the ever versatile Kay Thompson, described by Wikipedia as an American author, composer, musician, actress and singer, makes you wish she had more movies.  She is probably best known as the author of the Eloise books for children.  But for me, the best part is the visuals.  Fred Astaire plays a fashion photographer, loosely based on the idea of Richard Avedon.  So the film hired Richard Avedon as a consultant and right from the opening credits, the movie is done in bright bubble gum colors.  In addition, most of the movie is set in Paris, the ideal fantasy of the nineteen fifties.  The result is a rom com with some great Gershwin songs, a travel fantasy and some great visuals.

WOW, WOW, WOW, WOW, WOW!  This is an amazing work of art!  Joyous, cheerful, happy, lively, beautiful.  From the opening credits/main title backgrounds by Richard Avedon to the last note of music, truly scrumptious!

  What I really like about this movie and all movies from the 1940's and 1950's is the use of super fantastic Technicolor!  I have found it truly inspirational and joyous to watch Technicolor films of this time period.  I have found this particular Technicolor film to be truly inspirational and joyous to watch.  Technicolor makes these films look heightened,  more than full of life, ""Hyper-Real"".  This film is no exception.  There are some films of this time period that are exceptions, that do not inspire, that do not induce joy, however, this film is not one of those.  As I have already written, this Technicolor film is truly inspirational and joyous!  And I don't mind writing it again for emphasisthis Technicolor film is truly inspirational and joyous!

The Set Decoration by Sam Comer and Ray Moyer...EXCELLENT!  As an author, designer, and illustrator, I find inspiration from many elements.  Two of those elements are Technicolor films from the 1940's and 1950's, like this one, and music of the same time period.  There are inspirational gems in the films and in the music that I fill my mind with and draw from when creating.  It's more about what I'm ""SEEING"" as a designer/creator than what I'm seeing or hearing regarding the actual movie or music.  If you would like to see the creative result of being inspired, energized, enkindled,  quickened by Technicolor films of the 1940's and 1950's, as well as jazz, swing, and big band music of the same time period, then view the illustrations and design in my Art & Design/How-To book, ""Cartoon Design Revealed"", by visiting this Amazon.com page:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cartoon-Design-Revealed-Kristian-Andrew-Sather/dp/1478710217/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cartoon Design Revealed Kristian Andrew Sather</a>&nbsp;One never knows where inspiration will come from, when a joyous event will enter ones life, however, it's pretty near a guarantee that when the first Technicolor image from this movie is seen on your TV screen or device, you will understand, you will know.

Astaire's character is largely unlikable, but he gets the girl anyway. The songwriting was something less than musical. Hepburn's long solo near the beginning was particularly interminable.

245288,3,6300215598,"I love good fluffy musicals (5 stars for ""Singin' in the Rain""), I love Audrey Hepburn, I love Paris, and I love fashion and fashion photography, especially the classic designs of the 1950s. 1957's ""Funny Face"" takes drab intellectual Greenwich Village bookstore clerk Jo Stockton (Hepburn) into the world of high fashion and to gorgeous locations in and around Paris as a model for ""Quality"" magazine. So I should have loved ""Funny Face,"" right? Sadly, no.

""Funny Face"" gets  three stars because it's beautifully photographed (Richard Avedon consulted on the film) mostly on location in Paris, the women's costumes are stunning, Audrey Hepburn is winsome as ever, dances well and does fine with the songs that suit her voice, and Kay Thompson--yes, the Kay Thompson who gave the world ""Eloise"" who lives at The Plaza--is a hoot as ""Quality"" editor Maggie Prescott. But . . .

A musical does not need to make perfect sense or pose complex moral questions for me to enjoy it, but I do ask it to be fun and hang together somehow. For me, in spite of enjoyable individual elements, ""Funny Face"" does not work as a movie.

The great dancer Fred Astaire, playing fashion photographer Dick Avery and Hepburn's love interest, pretty much makes a fool of himself here. Much as I admire his dancing, I have never found his singing or acting to be more than barely adequate. His one big dance solo, although dry and with a folded umbrella, is a phoned-in knock-off of the title number in ""Singin' in the Rain."" Astaire is far too old for Hepburn, not just chronologically, but in his blandly pleasant grandfatherly demeanor and grandpa-sweater costumes. Unlike some onscreen May-December couples (Bacall-Bogart for instance), no sizzling chemistry fills the 30-year age gap. When he kisses Hepburn in the bookshop where he meets her, he looks about as delighted as a nine-year-old boy being forced to kiss an unfamiliar old lady relative who is wearing too much perfume. If the romance in a musical romantic comedy falls flat, it sucks the air out of the whole movie.

It would be fine--and easy enough--to make light of New York and Paris intellectuals and their pretensions, but ""Funny Face"" throws hot coals at them. Dick persuades Jo to model for ""Quality"" by telling her she'll get the chance to meet her intellectual idol, Professor Flostre, when she goes to Paris for the job. Jo does meet Flostre, but he acts more interested in trying to seduce/rape Jo than in discussing philosophy. Intellectualism = bad; commerce = good.

Worth seeing once for the costumes, location photography and enjoyable work from Hepburn and Kay Thompson, but cross ""Funny Face"" off my list of Audrey Hepburn movies to watch repeatedly.",1372032000,,2712,4.9104803493449785

Roger Edens should have known better, at this point, but he had never been tried as a producer and this is what he came up with.

Hepburn is a plain, bookish girl, who by chance discovery becomes a modeling sensation, falling in love along the way.  If things weren't cheesy enough, she and Astaire break into song and dance at the right moments, in between acting to advance the plot.  What is most appealing about this is the way it pokes fun - not only at the advertising world and women's fashion in the 1950s, but also about French philosophers.

OK, everyone else in my family didn't like it - the exaggeration, the way it is minutely choreographed, the standard plot.  But me?  I couldn't stop laughing in delight, all the while fascinated by Hepburn's uniquely charismatic beauty.

245523,4,6300215598,"A delightful musical featuring the music of George and Ira Gershwin. Four of the songs in the 1957 film were in the original Broadway show of 1927. Fred Astaire, who starred in the film, was also in the stage production, then with his sister Adele. The leading female role in the film was played by Audrey Hepburn, ably supported by Kay Thompson. Hepburn plays a Greenwich Village bookseller, one of whose customers is Astaire, in the role of a fashion photographer who takes her away from her books to become a fashion model. The evergreens `He loves and she loves', `S'wonderful', `How long has this been going on' and the title song are all featured: all that music and 100 minutes in full colour.

Sleek, bold and brash, she is bursting commanding singing and dancing, and with truly enviable comic timing. She is a master class for every character actor. I wish she made more films. Astaire is too old for Hepburn in this, but he is still a great presence at the top of his form. The cinematography is INCREDIBLE and impressionistic at times. The score is superb, and the orchestrations are some of the best I have ever heard. This is an underrated film, and I am so happy to have it in my collection.",1342396800,3,618,4.576576576576577
245525,2,6300215598,"There is no denying that Audrey Hepburn is a charming and endearing actress. Her singing on the other hand is less than phenomenal, so casting her in a musical (which was the big thing to do for a spell) was not the smartest decision to make. Casting her alongside the vocal talents of Fred Astaire and Kay Thompson only further embellished the fact that Hepburn was out of her league so-to-speak. The other problem with `Funny Face' is that even when you strip away the singing segments the story itself is average at best. This is your simple ugly duckling is made pretty and falls in love with the man responsible only to resent him and then fall back in love with him. This is the same formula we see in just about every film in this genre and its Oscar nomination in the writing department is almost as pointless as handing a film like `She's All That' a script nomination.

In all honesty there is no imagination or originality to be found in `Funny Face'.

The story follows bookworm Jo as she meets photographer Avery who thinks that she has the perfect face (albeit funny) for a new line of clothing for the everywoman. After some convincing is done Jo is shipped off to Paris where she is more interested in meeting Professor Emile Flostre than posing for pictures. Before long she falls head over heels for Avery, but his jealousy over the Flostre causes some issues to rise between he and Jo.

Fred Astaire is, in my opinion, a little too old for the part. He looks uninterested most of the time, that is unless he is parading across the screen in full on sing and dance mode. Kay Thompson is delightful as Maggie Prescott. She is truly the greatest thing about the film and should have been up for Oscar since she is the only one in the cast who gets everything right. When she's singing, dancing or just plain acting she is spot on perfection. Astaire is only perfect when he's got a tune to whistle, and Audrey is stunning when she's merely reading lines, but once the music starts she comes off out of place. Her voice is not terrible, but it is not up to par with her co-stars.

I can't really say that I would ever watch `Funny Face' again. Aside from Thompson I was let down for the overall experience was less that it could have been. The plot was simple at best and the dialog didn't help the matter too much either. Hepburn is charming and Astaire can sing and Thompson was splendid but the mediocre outweighs the positive and brings this film down a few notches for me.

245612,4,6300215598,"For me this was a decent musical, but was lacking in any kind of energy that I normally get from a Fred Astaire romantic comedy.  That's because it was a Hepburn film, not an Astaire film.

The Beatnik music, the dens of philosophy in a back street Paris cafe, all was made fun of, oddly in a smooth, professional way.  The music was ""OK"" but except for the final tune was not all that entertaining.

The film itself is gaudy with lots of color saturation (VistaVision) which in the beginning of the film really works.  The head of a fashion magazine goes ""Pink"" and everything is pink, including the doors, the walls, the fashion and so on.

What about her?  ""I wouldn't be caught dead in pink!""

Photography:

The gaudy cinematography at the start is quite amazing.  Too bad they dropped the stylized look at the half-way point.

Comedy:

The comedy for me was not really there.  The songs were fine and the dancing, though lacking the energy of a Rita Hayworth or a Ginger Rogers, was technically fine.  It was just lacking that something that I'm used to in most Astaire pictures.

Most of the story is a thin outline meant to showcase the songs and dances of the Gershwin brothers.  None of their songs really did it for me except for ""S'Wonderful"" which was well done.

On occasion the lip synch songs did not quite match the mouths but that was fairly rare.

Story:

Astaire is the photographer in this story (advisor was the famous photographer Richard Avedon) and he acts well with his Rolliflex and dark-room magic.

Hepburn is the shy, bookish bookstore girl who has her bookstore taken over by the pushy fashion magazine as they use it for a backdrop to their latest photo shoot.  But she is discovered by the magazine.

""She has what the fashion models are lacking -- intelligence!""

The sarcasm and irony in the story is evident - the fashion world with its designers, the way the magazine is run, how they'll fawn and do anything to be accepted.  Hepburn's character Jo does some great singing, but her dancing is technically fine but she is certainly no Ginger Rogers!

Bottom Line:  Really enjoyed the sets, the color and the sarcasm in this film -- how people are sometimes let down by what they thought was grand or beautiful but still come away from an experience with some kind of happiness despite being let down.

The film would be great for the Audrey Hepburn completist.

245615,5,6300215598,"""Funny Face"" (1957) is the great MGM musical that was not made at MGM. Director-choreographer Stanley Donen, producer Roger Edens, writer Leonard Gershe, and stars Fred Astaire and Kay Thompson were under contract to MGM. Everyone, especially Astaire, was anxious to have Audrey Hepburn as the leading lady. Audrey was under contract to Paramount pictures, which refused to loan her out to another studio. Astaire also had a two movie deal with Paramount, so the project was happily and quite successfully moved there. The resulting movie is a completely charming and entertaining Cinderella story that takes place in, and pokes delightful fun at, the world of high fashion.
  Dynamic and versatile entertainer and musical arranger Kay Thompson makes a rare movie appearance here as Maggie Prescott, editor of the chic ""Quality"" fashion magazine. Both Maggie and her photographer Dick Avery (Fred Astaire) are looking for the perfect woman to represent the ""Quality"" woman. They accidentally find her when they ambush a ""sinister little"" bookshop in Greenwich Villiage, where Jo Stockton (Audrey Hepburn) works as an assistant. The casting is perfect, since Audrey Hepburn is definitly one of the most enchanting,  ""quality"" ladies in the history of cinema. Hepburn's Jo is at first reluctant to accept a modeling assignment in Paris. She hates the world of fashion and models (""it's chee-chee and an unrealistic approach to economics"",) but she accepts because she sees the job as a means to an end. She wants to meet  Professor Emile Flouster (Michael Auclair), an intellectual philosopher. One of the many jokes in the film is that Audrey is considered to be the ideal ""quality"" woman because she is both beautiful and intellectual. Once in Paris, however, it doesn't take long for the photographer and his reluctant model to fall madly in love.
  ""Funny Face"" overflows with memorable musical numbers. The songs are a mix of classic songs by George and Ira Gershwin (""Funny Face"", ""He Loves And She Loves"", ""S Wonderful"") and vibrant original songs by Roger Edens and Leonard Gershe (""Think Pink!"", ""Bonjoor, Paree""). ""Bonjoor, Paree,"" with Thompson, Astaire, and Hepburn cavorting all over Paris, is an absolute delight. But my favorite number is a duet by Thompson and Hepburn titled ""How To Be Lovely."" Audrey's fans will be delighted to know she does her own singing here. Audrey's moody rendition of the Gershwin's classic ""How Long Has This Been Going On?"" is divine. Audrey sings, in her whispery, gentle voice,  with a feeling and expression that is completely missing when Marni Nixon, a trained, lovely soprano, dubbed Audrey's songs in the film version of ""My Fair Lady"" (1964). We all know that Audrey looks fabulous dressed by Hubert de Givency, but I like Audrey best in the simple black outfit she wears when she dances to a jazz version of ""How Long Has This Been Going On?"" in the beatnik cafe. The beatnik/philosophical world that Audrey loves is parodied as being just as artificial as the fashion world is here. Fred Astaire is right on the money when he tells Audrey that Professor Flouster ""is about as interested in your intellect as I am.""
  The May-December romance works well because Fred Astaire is an ageless entertainer and Audrey Hepburn is, well, Audrey Hepburn. ""Funny Face"", to quote one of the Gershwins' classic songs, is ""S Wonderful.""",1302393600,12,3375,5.077617328519856
245616,5,6300215598,"FUNNY FACE is one of the most enjoyable and delightful of Hollywood musicals. Featuring an immortal George & Ira Gershwin score (""He Loves and She Loves"", ""S'Wonderful"", ""Let's Kiss and Make Up"", ""How Long Has This Been Going On?""); the smartly-written screenplay by Leonard Gershe also marks this film with a strong storyline. I've yet to meet anyone who doesn't absolutely adore this movie.

When Quality Magazine invades a pokey Greenwich Village bookstore for a photo shoot featuring out-of-this-world fashion model Dovima, it's the ""dowdy intellectual shopgirl"" Jo Stockton (Audrey Hepburn) who unwittingly gets discovered. Photographer Dick Avery (Fred Astaire) finds something special in this ""funny face"" and jets her off to Paris as the new model for Quality's beauty campaign. Of course love comes knocking for Jo and Dick, but not before some marvelous songs have been sung, and showstopping dances have been performed.

Kay Thompson steals the entire movie as the deadpan magazine editor Maggie Prescott. She gets things off to a cracking start with ""Think Pink"", traipses all over the streets of Paris with ""Bonjour Paree""; and also gets a kooky 11 o'clock beatnik routine, ""Clap Yo' Hands"" (with Astaire). The character of Prescott is a thinly-veiled caricature of noted fashion editor Diana Vreeland; whilst Astaire's role was modelled after photographer Richard Avedon. Fans of ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"" should keep an eye out for former brides Virginia Gibson and Ruta Lee, reunited here as two of Prescott's assistants.

Audrey Hepburn's early ballet and dance training came in handy with making FUNNY FACE; her ""Basal Metabolism"" routine is spectacular (and she sings quite well too). Filmed on location in Paris, the entire movie definitely has the proper European Travelogue feel to it.

Extra features for this latest edition of FUNNY FACE will most probably repeat those from previous releases (""The Fashion Designer & His Muse"" and ""Parisian Dreams"" featurettes), plus the old ""Paramount in the '50s"" clip show, photo gallery and the trailer.",1297296000,3,2074,5.333333333333333
245617,4,6300215598,"Audrey Hepburn as a dowdy, shy little bookworm obsessed with philosophy to the point of excluding all else? Say it's not so.

But such is the legendary actress' role at the start of ""Funny Face,"" an endearingly frothy little musical that spends equal time exploring the nightlife of 1950s Paris and a sparkly, sunny version of the fashion industry. Hepburn and Fred Astaire are the ones who really make the story shine, with plenty of song-and-dance numbers and a quirky, slightly sardonic little romance.

Dissatisfied with the latest edition of Quality fashion magazine, publisher/editor Maggie Prescott (Kay Thompson) decides to splash the world with the Next Big Trend: think pink. Cue musical number.

She also decides to add an intellectual bent to the fashion world, and temporarily takes over a boho bookstore for a suitable backdrop, much to the dismay of the owner, Jo (Hepburn). Photographer Dick Avery (Fred Astaire) is struck by Jo's earnestness and unique ""funny face,"" and convinces Maggie to make her their new star model -- a woman who embodies intellect as well as fashion.

Jo doesn't like fashion, but agrees because she wants to immerse herself into the bohemian nightlife. But she's slowly growing to love her modeling career -- and Dick as well. But when Jo encounters the eminent Professor Flostre, her budding relationship with Dick is disrupted -- can fashion and philosophy find true love, or are their differences too much?

""Funny Face"" is loosely based on an old stage musical -- and by ""loosely based,"" I mean they borrowed a few songs from it and crafted a whole new plot. It's a big frothy creampuff of a musical, where you can guess the ending and all the plot twists far in advance, but somehow it just doesn't matter because it's such fun.

Part of the movie's charm is the glamourized views of Paris -- it's all romantic hotels, dramatic photo shoots (""Take the picture, TAKE THE PICTURE!"") and quirky little nightclubs. It has a lot of dry humour (""Now what's wrong with bringing out a girl who has character, spirit, and intelligence?"" ""That certainly would be novel in a fashion magazine"") and not-so-subtle spoofery of both bohemians and of the fashion elite. And boy is that fun.

It's also graced with a bunch of delightful musical numbers -- the over-the-top ""Think Pink,"" the sweet ""'s Wonderful,"" the adorably quirky titular song, and the exuberant ""Bonjour Paris!"" Hepburn in particular shines in two of these numbers -- she sings a fragile little ballad called ""How Long Has This Been Going On?"" in the ruined bookshop, and does a wildly kooky ""Basal Metabolism"" dance number in a bohemian bistro -- it's incredibly different from everything else in the movie.

In fact, Hepburn shines in pretty much every part of this movie, and while playing a character that could have easily been annoying -- earnest, naive, rather snobbish, and idealiastically devoted to any and all ""isms"" -- while Astaire serves as a counterbalance, playing a photographer who is just jaded enough to see the absurdity all around him. And Thompson is a real scene-stealer as the fashion queen who seems to think that Quality Magazine keeps the whole modern world afloat.

""Funny Face"" is indeed funny. It's also sweet, charming, romantic, and ""'s wonderful"" -- a cute little musical filled with stunningly gorgeous clothes and a bit of wicked satire.",1294790400,6,3373,4.95575221238938

It dissolves, leaving nothing more than a memory of having spent a couple of hours watching it, a sweet memory on the tongue, and a couple of amusing crumbs of dance, 50ies haute couture and Paris in the springtime.  It was amusing to compare and contrast the created ""Quality"" fashion magazine in this movie to the equally created ""Mode"" of ""Ugly Betty, each of them having the imperious editor laying down the fashion law to the lesser orders.  Was there once a time - is there still a time - when women could be ordered to ""Think Pink?"" as does Maggie Prescott (Thompson) and anyone but her office minions and a handful of desperately fashion conscious women would obey? Oh, well - it is amusing to think there is, and even more amusing - for the plot of this movie to think that a shy and uncertain bookstore clerk (Hepburn) could be picked out of dusty obscurity among the stacks and whisked off to Paris to become the very picture of fashion and glamor. For so she is, aided by the fashion photographer (Astaire) who sees the lovely butterfly in her bookstore chrysalis - of course they fall for each other. Who wouldn't, given that they are in Paris? Even though he actually appears to be better than twice her age, much can be overlooked in man who could dance like Astaire. And he partnered beautifully with both Hepburn and Thompson in very different dance numbers; as my daughter remarked, ""he showed them both off"".

Of the special features on this DVD edition, the most outstanding is the one focusing on Kay Thompson, who ought to be better known than just as the creator of the mischievous little girl Eloise, who lived in the Plaza Hotel.

Ms Thompson was a truly multi-talented personality, a skilled musician and performer, immensely popular, whose best and most winning performances seem to have been on stage, or in nightclubs more than forty years ago.

245677,5,6300215598,"Think Pink! S'wonderful!  Songs that are among the many wonderful memories from the classic love story and popular 1957 musical ""Funny Face"" starring Audrey Hepburn, Fred Astaire and Kay Thompson featuring memorable Gershwin songs, exciting choreography, beautiful fashion and beautiful scenes shot in Paris.  ""Funny Face"" was not just a regular musical of that time, it was a special film that highlights the style of an era and of course, another stunning fashion collaboration between Audrey Hepburn and her designer Hubert de Givenchy.  And also bringing together two top tier music talents such as Astaire and Thomas, all three in one film is just fantastic!

The film starts off with publisher and editor of Quality Magazine, Maggie Prescott (Thompson), looking for a new fashion trend.  A woman that exhibits beauty and intellect and both Prescott and fashion photographer, Dick Avery (Astaire) decide to look for this woman who can ""think as well as they look"".  So, the two along with the magazine staff visit a bookstore (Embryo Concepts) in Greenwich Village in Manhattan, they meet Jo Stockton, a shy bookstore clerk who also has a passion for philosophy.

Prescott tries to convince Stockton to consider becoming a model for the magazine but she does not want any part of it.  But Prescott, quite persistent in having Stockton become this new face, tricks her to bringing books to the offices of Quality Magazine.  As Stockton tries to hide from staff, she hides in the film developing room where Dick Avery is working.  Having known that Stockton's dream is to go to Paris and attend a lecture of renown philosopher, Professor Emil Flostre, Avery convinces her that by becoming a model for Quality Magazine will eventually bring her to Paris and attending the lecture of her favorite philosopher.

So, off to Paris they go and as Dick and Jo spend time together, they eventually start to fall in love.  As Jo is being prepared for the Gala to introduce her as the new fashion trend for Quality Magazine, she gets caught up in a lecture for her favorite philosopher, Emil Flostre that she forgets to attend the Gala.  Thus Dick goes to look for her and causing a scene that embarrasses her in front of Flostre.  But it seems that all is lost.  Quality Magazine may not have their model.  Dick may have lost the special woman in his life and as for Jo, she may have lost the one person that she truly loves.

""Funny Face"" is a classic from it's first song sung with Kay Thompson belting out ""Think Pink"" to the three talents singing in Paris, Audrey Hepburn's dance at a bar (which many have seen through a recent GAP commercial), to Astaire's talents as a vocalist and dancer and Gershwin songs such as ""S'Wonderful"", ""How Long Has This Been Going On"" and ""He Loves and She Loves"" but for film-goers at the time, it was a film that utilized the VistaVision technology (a higher resolution and widescreen technology developed by Paramount in 1954 and an older technology that continues to be used today) and a film that featured the beauty of Paris.  Talented actors, beautiful outfits, beautiful music taking place in a beautiful city, there's nothing funny about ""Funny Face"", the film is just overall... Beautiful!

VIDEO & AUDIO:

The film is presented in widescreen format, enhanced for 16:9 TV's. A lot of the Centennial Collection releases have been remastered for high definition and having the previous DVD's, I can tell you that the DVD looks great.  The shots of Paris from yesteryear to the dreamlike scenes between Astaire and Hepburn as they dance to Thompson's ""Think Pink"" and white and pink just stands out.  There are just many of these classic scenes that the remastered video make the film come alive.  But I can only imagine how this film would look in 1080P if released in Blu-ray.

Audio is featured in Dolby Digital English 5.1 Surround/English, Restored Mono, French Mono and Spanish Mono. The film of course is dialogue-driven but for those who love those Gershwin classics, they do come alive for this film courtesy of the Dolby Digital 5.1 track.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Similar to the three previous ""Centennial Collections"" from Paramount, the special features are all on disc 2.  Because ""Funny Face"" was released in 2007 as a DVD, some of the special features from that disc can be found on this Centennial Collection but there are a few new features included as well.

  * Kay Thompson: ""Think Pink"" - Kaye Thompson who played Maggie Prescott was a woman who was known for her quick wit, her sharp tongue and multi-talented.  Her friends and people she worked with take part in this near-27 minute featurette in which they talk about her past, her work in ""Funny Face"", the memories they had working with her but also her contributions as an author with her popular books series ""Eloise"".  It was a great featurette to have included on this DVD.
  * This is VistaVision - A 25-minute featurette about the history of the VistaVision technology, the films that used it and the films that continue to use it today.  A very interesting featurette especially for those who are interested in learning more about another technology outside of Anamorphic CinemaScope and the beginning of hi-res Widescreen film.
  * Fashion Photographers Exposed - A 18-minute featurette about fashion photographers and how ""Funny Face"" inspired many of them but also giving us an idea of the life of a fashion photographer and how the work of a fashion photographer in reality differs from Dick Avery's character from the film and all the staff involved with working with a fashion photographer.
  * The Fashion Designer & His Muse - An eight minute featurette (that was included in the original 2007 DVD release) about Audrey Hepburn and her designer Hubert de Givenchy.
  * Parisian Dreams - An eight minute featurette about ""Funny Face"", a love story set in Paris and how Paris enhances a love story. Originally included in the original 2007 DVD release.
  * Paramount in the 50's - Retrospective Featurette - A near ten minute featurette on Paramount and it's popular films in the 1950's, featured in various Paramount releases.
  * Galleries - Featuring production stills, movie stills and publicity shots for the film.

The Centennial Collection also comes with a booklet that features information of facts of the film which include how the film differs from the 1927 Broadway musical that starred Fred Astaire and sister Adele.  Also, the collaboration of screenplay writer Leonard Gershe and collaborating with real-life fashion photographer Richard Avedon and much more!

And the DVD is just classy with it's black and gold packaging (which most of the Centennial Collection are packaged) and ditching the pink and white packaging.

If there is one thing about ""Funny Face"", I could imagine how the film captured the attention of viewers with its stylish presentation of the fashion but also using the city of Paris and it's iconic monuments and the beauty of the city portrayed in color in this film.

Also, to have talent such as Audrey Hepburn (singing and dancing) and how she would only do the film if Fred Astaire and of course, having Kay Thompson in a rare film appearance all together is just amazing.  From the classic opening scene of ""Think Pink"", to the moment when each person arrives in Paris and you get a beautiful look at the architecture and scenery and the choreography of Audrey Hepburn as she unwinds and starts to dance in the red-dimmed bar and many more scenes that are just enjoyable to watch.

There are just so many of these classic moments on ""Funny Face"" and it's not just the music scenes,  there are just beautiful scenes such as Audrey Hepburn in a wedding dress, and the multiple modeling photo shoots featuring Avery and Stockton such as the scene where Stockton wears an elegant red dress and walks down the steps asking Avery to take a picture while he tells her to stop and she keeps saying ""I can't Stop, take the picture"" and saying it with a smile.  And then with each photo shoot, the photography stills are showcased in various versions.  May it be in full color, grayscale and then a combination of both. These things may seem common place today especially in color correction years of PhotoShop  but back then,  a lot of these visual images back in 1957 were new, fresh and unique.

And of course, the age difference between Astaire and Hepburn really doesn't matter in this film.  Astaire is just full of life and he can move and dance much fluidly than many youngsters, so to have these two talents come together, it's no surprise that Hepburn feeds of his energy.  Their chemistry work in each musical number and also when their characters are together.  And as much as I love ""Roman Holiday"", ""Sabrina"" and ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", ""Funny Face"" is one of those films that shows you the pure charm and the versatility of Hepburn as an actress.

Now, you may be a person who owns a prior DVD release of ""Funny Face"" (and other Audrey Hepburn films on DVD) and wonder if this DVD is worth upgrading to.  I can tell you right now that these Centennial Collections are the  definitive versions to buy on DVD.  Remastered, in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and even more special features than their previous DVD incarnations, these Centennial Collection releases are just beautiful to watch, to hear and enjoy.

This DVD is highly recommended!",1231113600,50,9415,4.840099937539038
245678,4,6300215598,"Audrey Hepburn as a dowdy, shy little bookworm obsessed with philosophy to the point of excluding all else? Say it's not so.

But such is the legendary actress' role at the start of ""Funny Face,"" an endearingly frothy little musical that spends equal time exploring the nightlife of 1950s Paris and a sparkly, sunny version of the fashion industry. Hepburn and Fred Astaire are the ones who really make the story shine, with plenty of song-and-dance numbers and a quirky, slightly sardonic little romance. It's never a deep story, but it's always a charming one.

Dissatisfied with the latest edition of Quality fashion magazine, publisher/editor Maggie Prescott (Kay Thompson) decides to splash the world with the Next Big Trend: think pink. Cue musical number.

She also decides to add an intellectual bent to the fashion world (""Marion, dear, what are you reading?"" ""Minute Men from Mars!""), and temporarily takes over a boho bookstore for a suitable backdrop, much to the dismay of the owner Jo (Hepburn). Photographer Dick Avery (Fred Astaire) is struck by Jo's earnestness and unique ""funny face,"" and convinces Maggie to make her their new star model -- supposedly a woman who embodies intellect as well as chic fashion.

Jo doesn't like fashion (""It is chichi, and an unrealistic approach to self-impressions as well as economics!"") agrees because she wants to meet her favorite philosopher in Paris, and immerse herself into the bohemian nightlife. But she's slowly growing to love her modeling career -- and Dick as well. But when Jo encounters the eminent Professor Flostre, her budding relationship with Dick is disrupted -- can fashion and philosophy find true love, or are their differences too much?

""Funny Face"" is loosely based on an old stage musical -- and by ""loosely based,"" I mean they borrowed a few songs from it and crafted a whole new plot. Fortunately this doesn't keep the movie from being vastly entertaining -- it's a big frothy creampuff of a musical, where you can guess the ending and all the plot twists far in advance, but somehow it just doesn't matter because it's such fun, and the romance is so sweet despite Astaire and Hepburn's chasmic age gap.

Part of the movie's charm is the glamourized views of Paris -- it's all romantic hotels, dramatic photo shoots (""Take the picture, TAKE THE PICTURE!""), idyllic wedding chapels and quirky little nightclubs. And it has a lot of dry humour (""Every girl on every page of Quality has grace, elegance, and pizzazz. Now what's wrong with bringing out a girl who has character, spirit, and intelligence?"" ""That certainly would be novel in a fashion magazine"") and not-so-subtle spoofery of the pretentions both of bohemians and of the fashion elite. And boy is that fun.

It's also graced with a bunch of delightful musical numbers -- the over-the-top ""Think Pink,"" the sweet ""'s Wonderful,"" the adorably quirky titular song, and the exuberant ""Bonjour Paris!"" Hepburn in particular shines in two of these numbers -- she sings a fragile little ballad called ""How Long Has This Been Going On?"" in the ruined bookshop, and does a wildly kooky ""Basal Metabolism"" dance number in a bohemian bistro -- it's incredibly different from everything else in the movie.

In fact, Hepburn shines in pretty much every part of this movie, and while playing a character that could have easily been annoying -- earnest, naive, rather snobbish, and idealiastically devoted to any and all ""isms"" -- while Astaire serves as a counterbalance, playing a photographer who is just jaded enough to see the absurdity all around him. And Thompson is a real scene-stealer as the fashion queen who seems to think that Quality Magazine keeps the whole modern world afloat.

The Centennial edition of this movie is going to have an extra disk included, only some of which is entirely relevant to the movie. Aside from the usual content -- galleries, a theatrical trailer -- the extras include some featurettes on fashion photographers, Cecil B. DeMille, Paramount in the 1950s, something about VistaVision, and one about Kay Thompson entitled (what else?) ""Think Pink."" And of course ""The Fashion Designer and His Muse,"" which is presumably about Hepburn and her lifelong devotion to Givenchy.

""Funny Face"" is indeed funny. It's also sweet, charming, romantic, and ""'s wonderful"" -- a cute little musical filled with stunningly gorgeous clothes and a bit of wicked satire. Definitely worth checking out.",1223510400,2,4454,5.031207598371777
245728,3,6300215598,"Another fun and cheerful musical, but with a most unusual starring character. Audrey Hepburn is charming and delightful as a philosophical bookworm. I don't buy the romantic relationship between her and Fred Astaire's characters, but Astaire's dancing seems to gloss over that little flaw in the casting. The songs aren't great, but the music helps to keep the story moving. You really have to like the actors in this to enjoy it, because it's not a great story. It's rather sweet and tries to be interesting, but falls short of great. The costumes by Givenchy are incredibly beautiful and Hepburn looks fabulous in them.",1223078400,2,621,4.980769230769231
245729,5,6300215598,"I enjoyed this movie very much, most entertaining, what more could you ask from the everlasting Audrey Hepburn and Fred Astair.",1222214400,,127,5.095238095238095
245730,5,6300215598,I love this movie. The box came promptly and was factory sealed. The coloring is great not overdone or garish. A must have for any collection.,1220832000,,142,4.5
245731,2,6300215598,"There is no denying that Audrey Hepburn is a charming and endearing actress.  Her singing on the other hand is less than phenomenal, so casting her in a musical (which was the big thing to do for a spell) was not the smartest decision to make.  Casting her alongside the vocal talents of Fred Astaire and Kay Thompson only further embellished the fact that Hepburn was out of her league so-to-speak.  The other problem with `Funny Face' is that even when you strip away the singing segments the story itself is average at best.  This is your simple ugly duckling is made pretty and falls in love with the man responsible only to resent him and then fall back in love with him.  This is the same formula we see in just about every film in this genre and its Oscar nomination in the writing department is almost as pointless as handing a film like `She's All That' a script nomination.

In all honesty there is no imagination or originality to be found in `Funny Face'.

The story follows bookworm Jo as she meets photographer Avery who thinks that she has the perfect face (albeit funny) for a new line of clothing for the everywoman.  After some convincing is done Jo is shipped off to Paris where she is more interested in meeting Professor Emile Flostre than posing for pictures.  Before long she falls head over heels for Avery, but his jealousy over the Flostre causes some issues to rise between he and Jo.

Fred Astaire is, in my opinion, a little too old for the part.  He looks uninterested most of the time, that is unless he is parading across the screen in full on sing and dance mode.  Kay Thompson is delightful as Maggie Prescott.  She is truly the greatest thing about the film and should have been up for Oscar since she is the only one in the cast who gets everything right.  When she's singing, dancing or just plain acting she is spot on perfection.  Astaire is only perfect when he's got a tune to whistle, and Audrey is stunning when she's merely reading lines, but once the music starts she comes off out of place.  Her voice is not terrible, but it is not up to par with her co-stars.

I can't really say that I would ever watch `Funny Face' again.  Aside from Thompson I was let down for the overall experience was less that it could have been.  The plot was simple at best and the dialog didn't help the matter too much either.  Hepburn is charming and Astaire can sing and Thompson was splendid but the mediocre outweighs the positive and brings this film down a few notches for me.

Not everything can be a classic.",1218499200,3,2542,4.435344827586207
245732,4,6300215598,"I have to say that as a once-proud bookstore owner, I was absolutely appalled at the absolute disrespect for private property and the handling of the books and the young Audrey in the film's opening. I cringed for those few moments when she was brushed outside and made to choke on the smoggy air of New York City. The real kick in the pants was when the old dodger Astaire planted a fatty right on the very tame Hepburn kisser. You could be arrested for no less these days, haha.

So, Funny Face is really Ira Gershwin's most impressionable and lasting film? I guess that's not a bad thing. The songs are quaint and a bit cutesy when sung or `spoken' by Audrey, but it's not to their detriment or the song's. The music is what gives the movie some real charm.

""You're not exotic ... but oh, so hypnotic.""

Truer words could not have been spoken about Audrey Hepburn as that was honestly her most endearing quality and the reason why we all love her. She, thankfully, wasn't Elizabeth Taylor in Cleopatra and she wasn't ever Lauren Bacall in the Big Sleep, but closer to that bon vivant feeling that was so evident in the early years of Ingrid Bergman. Notice how I make no modern references when discussing Audrey. I don't think anyone comes close these days, or probably ever will. It's all in shambles now.

Thank god that the French were drinking Absinthe during the Caf Scene where she gives her legendary `kitty cat on the prowl dance routine' that always makes a person grin from ear to ear.

The film does disappear into a strange level of mediocre film making in between the period from the frolicking on the meadow at the church, to the beatnik booze-down where a fake beard is sported and I'm not speaking about Kay Thompson, but Monsieur Astaire, from Tallahassee. I guess trying to pass themselves off as trailer-bait, white trash must've been humorous and entertaining back then, but I honestly couldn't wait for the number to end as Audrey disappears for the length of a bible.

In the end, your brain doesn't want to translate the real message of the film as it's about a girl who gets caught up in the New York Fashion Industry, looses her moral center, gives up on the idolized love of her life, and then violently beats her lover over the head with a vase to pursue her May-December relationship. I think Audrey was 27 during filming, and Fred was 58. I guess. Sigh ... I guess it aint all that bad. Maybe that was why they gave her the last name of `Stockton'.",1214956800,3,2481,4.502222222222223
245733,2,6300215598,"I wish I'd rented this movie instead of buying it. I was looking forward to watching a beautiful love story unfold between Audrey Hepburn and Fred Astaire. Yes, there's a huge age difference between the two in this film but the romance between them was not totally unbelievable. It just wasn't very inspiring. And the entire movie wasn't very interesting or fun to watch.",1214352000,2,371,4.8125
245734,4,6300215598,"I'd be lying if I suggested that I liked musicals.  I've always found them a little embarrassing.  Two people start making a connection or the tension heightens in a scene and the payoff?  Someone breaks into song.  Generally, that's not my idea of entertainment.

But, Audrey Hepburn was so interesting to watch.  She truly was a captivating person and really took over a role.  In Funny Face, it was impossible to take my eyes off of her.  I'm not talking about her beauty, though she was a beautiful woman.  I'm talking about her entire persona, that charm, grace and fun she oozed on-screen.  Anything with Audrey in it is worth seeing, musical or not.

Fred Astaire, a very capable actor, was an amazing dancer.  It is a joy to watch him dance -- and I'm no huge fan of dancing, either -- in Funny Face.  It's almost mind boggling that he was so athletic and graceful and skilled at almost 60 years old.  Yes, he was 58 when Funny Face was made, but he really tore it up, dancing like a man 20 years his junior.

Overall, the movie's cute and fun.  Check it out if you're in the mood for Audrey, Fred or a good musical.",1211068800,,1124,4.357487922705314

245736,5,6300215598,"I think some reviewers missed that this film is a playful and satirical take on 50's high fashion, American tourists, Parisian clichs, folk singers, beatniks and (pseudo)intellectuals. There are a lot of clues early on but the biggest one is when Kay Thompson's character is told everyone is wearing pink (as she has instructed) - why isn't she? Her reply: ""I wouldn't be caught dead!"" And then there's Dovima as Marion, playing up her Queens accent against her exotic model persona - she is funny and perfect! Every time I watch this film, I catch something I previously missed: the twelve little girls in two straight lines at the church, how the final scene becomes nothing less than an impressionist painting, Richard Avedon's hand and eye throughout (the opening titles turn out to be the Quality Magazine covers on the walls.)  Quirky things about Kay Thompson's jewelry and shoes throughout. The clothes! The music! It is so correct in its details and yet so over the top as a whole - fun!

I agree that Astaire was nearly too old for the part but he's Fred Astaire - who cares?  Audrey Hepburn was one of the last great Hollywood glamour-pusses and was paired with a number of aging stars, for instance Bogart in Sabrina and Cary Grant in Charade. Rex Harrison? Gary Cooper? Gregory Peck in Roman Holiday was a pretty close match, but she seldom had an age appropriate leading man. Maybe part of the problem is that she was just so lovely, she never really seemed to age at all.

Bottom line: this is a film to lift the spirits.",1205193600,2,1536,4.636029411764706

245792,4,6300215598,"A charming yet relatively generic musical, Funny Face was a huge success upon its release in 1957, and is now a celebrated classic. Starring the captivating Audrey Hepburn and the debonair Fred Astaire, this bright and picturesque film features many unforgettable songs and amazingly choreographed dance sequences with the incredibly talented cast.

The Quality Magazine is looking for a fresh new idea to enlighten the pages of the publication. Inimitable photographer Dick Avery (Fred Astaire) stumbles upon the unique intelligence and beauty of Jo Stockton (Audrey Hepburn) a clerk at Embryo Concepts Book Shop. Reluctant at first, she is swept away by his promise to take her to Paris, where she hopes to meet empathacalist philosopher Flostre (Michael Auclair). Getting the ultimate makeover for a new fashion line she's supposed to model, Jo is overcome by her love for Avery and her short-sighted crush on Professor Flostre.

Funny Face features timeless songs from Ira and George Gershwin, including ""I Love Your Funny Face"", ""'S Wonderful"" and many more. The film serves as a vehicle for showcasing these unforgettable tunes, as well as for the stunning agility and talents of Fred Astaire and Audrey Hepburn as dancers. From the ""Let's Kiss and Make Up"" matador dance in a moonlit courtyard to the long caf dance by Hepburn, Funny Face doesn't slack on showing exceptionally choreographed routines.

Breaking into spontaneous song and dance is not something many people nowadays are familiar with, nor could they find themselves believing in. Even recent attempts at musicals, including Hairspray and Across the Universe are unable to re-create the aura of classic musicals. In Funny Face, music aids in telling the story and is often a replacement for direct narration. Above all else, it tells a story that could hold up even without the songs and dance. While more present-day audiences can fall for children-oriented musicals such as Mary Poppins, films like Funny Face are notably intended for adult audiences. Not an R-rated maturity, but more for a crowd knowledgeable about the generally adult themes of love and romance that permeate these films.

Funny Face doesn't have quite the caliber of storyline as My Fair Lady or Gigi, but it performs well on its own level with sublime music and outstanding dancing. Just as memorable but not nearly as developed or heartfelt, this Stanley Donen film (Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Singin' in the Rain) is an excellent sampling of 50s musicals, but by no means the best. As prevalent as musicals were in the 1950's, it's no wonder that so many great ones were created. With beautiful sets and locations that appear snatched right out of a painting, Funny Face is a luscious example of the grace, talent and sweeping romance that often escapes current musical fare.

245794,4,6300215598,"Last fall, the Gap re-launched their skinny black pant line with a major advertising blitz spotlighting Audrey Hepburn performing her beatnik dance from this well-remembered 1957 musical.

The source movie - now celebrated in a 50th Anniversary Edition DVD - is a Hollywood confection teaming Hepburn with an effortlessly debonair Fred Astaire set to George and Ira Gershwin's memorable music. The elegantly mounted numbers provide the ideal complement to the souffl&eacute;-light plot centered on Dick Avery, a world-renowned, Richard Avedon-like fashion photographer who discovers his next superstar model in Jo Stockton, a bookshop clerk and aspiring philosopher, in time for a major runway event in Paris.

Jo's interest in going to Paris is heightened by an opportunity to meet Professor Flostre, a philosopher who specializes in ""empatheticalism"", a suspect philosophy that stresses the importance of empathy. But romance intrudes, and the rest becomes inevitable. Starting with the photography provided by Avedon himself, the film is stylish to the nth degree with a bold color palette that director Stanley Donen and cinematographer Ray June bring to vibrant life. Donen already had&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-the-Town/dp/B00004RF9J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On the Town</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Singin-in-the-Rain/dp/B00006DEF9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Singin' in the Rain</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven-Brides-for-Seven-Brothers/dp/B0002OXVCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven Brides for Seven Brothers</a>&nbsp;under his belt by this time, so he proves again how to make a movie move with fluidity and flair. He also adheres to the formula of studio-manufactured musical comedies with characters going through lightning-quick personality transformations to move the story along and allow them to break into song and dance at a moment's notice.

This level of contrivance will not sit well with some contemporary film viewers, and the opposites-attract storyline seems particularly forced here by the thirty years that separate the co-stars' ages. Regardless, several individual elements work well beginning with Astaire who epitomizes class and artistic drive as Avery, and his dancing and singing remain undiminished by the years. Hepburn is certainly picture-perfect as Jo, looking particularly spectacular in the fashion shoot sequence. With a throaty voice, she sings the classic ""How Long Has This Been Going On?"" with an aching vulnerability and duets passably on three other numbers. With her ballet training, Hepburn moves well in the dance numbers, though she is not a natural and seems oddly flat-footed when paired with the lithe Astaire, especially on the pastoral ""He Loves and She Loves"" duet. As seen in the Gap commercial, her frantic dance solo is enjoyable mostly for her sheer exuberance.

As Avery's dictatorial magazine editor Maggie Prescott, the redoubtable Kay Thompson portrays a most irritating character, but her natural wit and good spirits manage to compensate. The film's most energetic number is ""Bonjour Paris"", a split-screen exploration of the city by Avery, Maggie and Jo. Donen generally does a superb job guiding his movies, but this one ultimately feels a bit lackluster given the participants. For a 50th Anniversary package, the extras are fairly skimpy. While it does offer a fairly pristine print transfer, there is surprisingly no commentary track. A couple of shorts are offered - ""The Fashion Designer and his Muse"", an eight-minute look at the bonding relationship between Hepburn and her most compatible designer, Hubert de Givenchy, and ""Parisian Dreams"" in which writer Drew Casper and writer/director Olivier-Rene Veillon give a cinematic tour of the City of Lights.

245795,5,6300215598,"FUNNY FACE is one of the most enjoyable and delightful of Hollywood musicals.  Featuring an immortal George & Ira Gershwin score (""He Loves and She Loves"", ""S'Wonderful"", ""Let's Kiss and Make Up"", ""How Long Has This Been Going On?""); the smartly-written screenplay by Leonard Gershe also marks this film with a strong storyline.  I've yet to meet anyone who doesn't like this movie.

When Quality Magazine invades a pokey Greenwich Village bookstore for a photo shoot, it's the ""dowdy intellectual shopgirl"" Jo Stockton (Audrey Hepburn) who gets unwittingly discovered.  Photographer Dick Avery (Fred Astaire) finds something special in this ""funny face"" and jets her off to Paris as the new model for Quality's beauty campaign.  Of course love comes knocking for Jo and Dick, but not before some marvelous songs have been sung, and showstopping dances have been performed.

Kay Thompson steals the entire movie as the deadpan magazine editor Maggie Prescott.  She gets things off to a cracking start with ""Think Pink"", traipses all over the streets of Paris with ""Bonjour Paree""; and also gets a kooky 11 o'clock beatnik routine, ""Clap Yo' Hands"" (with Astaire).  The character of Prescott is a thinly-veiled caricature of noted fashion editor Diana Vreeland; whilst Astaire's role is modelled after photographer Richard Avedon.  Fans of ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"" should keep an eye out for former brides' Virginia Gibson and Ruta Lee, reunited here as two of Prescott's assistants.

Audrey Hepburn's early ballet and dance training came in handy with making FUNNY FACE, her ""Basal Metabolism"" routine is spectacular (and she sings quite well too).  Filmed on location in Paris, the entire movie definitely has the proper European Travelogue feel to it.

This 50th Anniversary Edition of FUNNY FACE will feature a brand-new High Definition transfer of the movie, some great new featurettes (""The Fashion Designer & His Muse"", ""Parisian Dreams""), plus the material from the previous DVD release (""Paramount in the '50s"" featurette, a photo gallery and the trailer).",1185840000,44,2073,5.286585365853658
245796,3,6300215598,"Odd combination of characters with divergent interests pair for romance. Fred Astaire is an old photographer and Hepburn is a youthful book salesperson turned model. When they arrive in Paris she looks for a good time with the hip poetry-reading and avant garde dance society -- he looks to perfect her career as a polished model. Before long he is crooning songs and dancing in the street, eventually attracting the heart of the unlikely bride.

I genuinely dislike offering ratings inconsistent with the majority. Heburn is usually a delight to watch but obviously FUNNY FACE is not one of my favorites. Diehard Astaire or Hepburn fans will be curious but I give it only three out of five stars. Even Audrey in stunning Givenchy outfits, showing off her talents as an energetic dancer couldn't elevate this ridiculous plot above mediocrity.

Movie quote: ""She put herself in your place -- all you have to do is put yourself in her place, and you're bound to bump into each other in somebody's place.""",1146528000,10,1002,4.853801169590644
245797,5,6300215598,"Audrey Hepburn does indeed fill the air with smiles in Stanley Donen's exquisite and happy film about a shy book clerk in New York who is transformed into the toast of the Paris fashion world. George and Ira Gershwin wrote some of their best songs for the film and a few additional numbers were contributed by Roger Edens and Leonard Gershe, who also wrote the delightful story. The premise is quite frivilous but the execution glorious and joyful and it is easy to see why this was Audrey's favorite among all her films.

Fred Astaire is winning as fashion photographer Dick Avery and Kay Thompson is marvelous as Miss Prescott, the one-track mind owner of Quality Magazine he works for. Hepburn is adorable as the shy New York bookstore clerk, Jo Stockton. They bully her into letting them do a photo shoot, making a mess off things for her to clean up. From the moment Donen's camera catches her sliding on the ladder in panic we are in love and we know it won't be long before Jo and Dick are also.

Jo is a shy intellectual, mad about empathicalism, a screwy philosophy endorsed by Professor Emile Flustre (Michel Auclair) who, of course, lives in Paris. Once Dick displays his own brand of empathy by kissing Jo while they are cleaning up, he gets an idea for a new layout and the seed of love is planted in Jo's heart. Donen captures Hepburn's child-like yet feminine grace like no one else ever has and her wistful and waif-like beauty has never been seen to better advantage than in Funny Face.

Making Jo the face for Quality magazine may not be such an easy task, however, as it goes against everything she believes. Being chased by Miss Prescott's minions, Jo ducks into Dick's darkroom, where she and Dick share a lovely song and dance moment to the title-tune, Funny Face. Once Jo discovers it will all lead to Paris, where she can meet the great empathicalist, Emile, she gives the green light and the fun really begins.

Stanley Donen staged every song himself, and it shows. That moment that nearly always exists in every musical, even the great ones, when we are tempted to fast-forward and get on with the story, simply does not exist here. Every number is lively and imaginative, easily holding our interest. None of the numbers is more joyful or fun than the one when they first arrive in Paris and become typical tourists. Ray June's photography shows off the beautiful City of Lights and the funny and happy face of Audrey Hepburn in wonderful fashion.

It is like watching a great chef make the sweetest and most delicious of pastries as Dick takes Jo through one great shoot after another all over Paris, transforming the cocoon into a butterfly. The two share a lovely song sequence in a garden with a brook outside a church, when Jo finally tells Dick she is in love with him. Hepburn in a white wedding gown is as elegant and graceful as the doves and swans surrounding them.

There are some fun complications involving Jo's idol Emile, of course, who Dick knows is more man than philosopher. A fun and frantic ending caps a film that is a sheer delight from beginning to end. Astaire was somewhat older than Hepburn and it seems to work in the film's favor, as you could see where the innocent Jo would need a more worldly man to appreciate her charms rather than take advantage of them.

This is a wonderful confection from Stanley Donen, who would work with Audrey once again in another classic, Charade. The little girl from Holland who aided the Dutch resistence during WWII grew into one of the most lovely and luminous stars ever to grace a movie screen. She is gone now and Funny Face is a wonderful way to remember her......",1123977600,33,3661,4.58868501529052
245818,4,6300215598,"Well, funny isn't how I'd describe Audrey Hepburn's face.  Dazzling, luminescent, one-of-a-kind...  but funny?  I'm not laughing.  I more side with Fred Astaire's character Dick Avery, who says ""What you call funny, I call interesting.""
Seriously though, how does a shy, introverted, intellectual bluestocking who is a firm believer in empathicalism became a fashion model for Quality magazine?  Part of it has to do with photographer Dick Avery blowing up some snaps of her after an uninvited photo session in her Greenwich Village bookstore, and selling her to Maggie Prescott, editor of Quality.  Another has to do with a photo shoot in Paris for the new layout of Quality, in exchange for which she'll get to meet Professor Flostre, the philosophical founder of empathicalism and her hero.
The best scenes in the movie are the photo shoots, which shows Jo doing poses in the rain, holding balloons, and tearfully standing at a departing railway station.  But the standout has to be her running down the steps of the Louvre in a sleeveless red Givenchy gown, the statue of the Winged Victory behind her, emulating the famed statute.  Another is Jo's dance in the nightclub, expressing herself after Avery pokes fun at her empathicalist beliefs.  It's a spontaneous number set to a upbeat jazz rhythms, with Jo wearing a black body stocking, and it would be the last time Audrey would use her dancing talents in a movie.
The movie's attitude to the French beatnik and intellectual culture that began in the 1950's is clearly and unfortunately contemptuous, not surprising, considering that America in the 50's was in the growth-oriented prosperity, which had no room for intellectual thought.  The concept of empathicalism, the philosophy of putting one in another person's shoes via emotion and manner of speech.  That is kind of sabotaged by Avery, who speaks in a charming manner to two Frenchman while using insulting words.
The only sympathetic and likeable character here is Jo Stockton, played by Audrey, of course, but the motivations of her character selling out by working for a fashion magazine, which is so phony, materialistic, and shallow, is questionable.  Still, Audrey is a breathe of fresh air, whatever she wears.
As for the characters played by Fred Astaire and nightclub performer Kay Thompson (Maggie), they're not exactly laudable.  Fred Astaire's Avery is nice but shallow, and the chemistry between him and Audrey isn't credible. At least he could still dance.  His character is based on famed fashion photographer Richard Avedon, as indeed is some of the story, where Avedon trained and married one of his models.  As for Thompson, her brusque, bossy, brash, and downright aggressive attitude does not endear her well.  Not content with having her crew make a mess of the Embryo Bookstore in the beginning, she then has the nerve to push her outside until the photo shoot is finished!  Her character is a cariacature of either Diana Vreeland of Vogue or Carmel Snow of Harper's Bazaar.
The costumes by Givenchy are great, as are the musical numbers by Gershwin, especially the ""He Loves and She Loves"" and ""S'wonderful"" numbers, both of which feature Fred and Audrey dancing together.  BTW, Astaire and his sister Adele had already danced to this in the Broadway show of the same name back in 1927.  And this is the first of three movies with director Stanley Donen for Audrey, the others being Charade and Two For The Road.  Donen of course made Fred Astaire dance on the ceiling in Royal Wedding years before Lionel Richie did for MTV.
So, ""what's wrong with bringing out a girl who has character, spirit, and intelligence?""  Well, nothing if she's allowed to stay true to her beliefs.  Dated by today's standards, due to its endorsement of shallow materialistic values as opposed to something more genuine and intellectual, redeemed by Audrey and some of the songs.",1083888000,7,3896,5.007751937984496
245820,5,6300215598,"Whenever I think of Paris, I want to see Funny Face again.
Being in Paris is like being in an Audrey Hepburn movie, and nothing makes you feel like this more than the delightful ""Bonjour Paris"" number done when Astaire, Hepburn and the extraordinary Kaye Thompson (Liza Minnelli's godmother, BTW, who steals the picture) arrive in the City of Lights.  This is the ultimate Paris moment.
Using the score from Gershwin's stage version of Funny Face and a new script by Leonard Gershe, under the sure hand of Stanley Donen, everything is beautiful.  Thompson plays a character based on Diana Vreeland, the head of Vogue, who, under the advice of the photographer played by Astaire (and based on Richard Avedon) takes a young intellectual wallflower from Greenwich Village and passes
her off as ""the Quality Woman.""  The entire thing is enchanting, and after 46 years, Funny Face still holds up beautifully.  The highlights include the opening ""Think Pink""
number; Astaire's bullfight dance during ""Let's Kiss and Make Up,"" ""Clap Yo' Hands,"" done as only Astaire and Thompson could, and one of the most gorgeous, lasting images of the great Audrey Hepburn: dressed beautifully by Givenchy in red, she walks down the grand staircase at the Louvre, a flowing sheer red shawl held aloft.  She has never looked so beautiful, and we are so lucky to have had her in our lives.

What is important here is not the story but it's treatment full of ingenious fresh ideas by director DONEN.For example,the use of color is often amazing;you can actually feel the makers had a field day playing with it. The wedding sequences are fun to watch. We all know that AUDREY HEPBURN could have been FRED's daughter.

Add Fred Astaire, for all his years, still dapper and charming, and you have a highly unusual screen romance that is still enjoyable.

245825,5,6300215598,"I knew I was going to love this film when I saw it at first. Kay Thompson  strutting through that ridiculous-looking lobby and then bursting into song  (""Think pink!"") was enough to hook me.
The plotline is simply:  Astaire plays a photographer who, after taking pictures of a model in a  girl named Jo's bookstore, decides that Hepburn is the ""new  look."" He convinces fashion empress Maggie Prescott to make Jo a  model, and she quickly is whisked off to Paris. But Hepburn's character is  no brainless fluff piece--more seriously than anything, Jo loves  philosophy. There is a tangle of fashion, worldliness and philosophy before  things are straightened out.
Never seen Fred Astaire before, but let me  put this quickly: He's almost as good an actor as he is a dancer.
Hepburn  is even better than usual in this movie. Not only does she shine alongside  Astaire, but she also does a funky dance number in a cafe with a pair of  great-looking French guys. Her musical numbers are great--who says she  can't sing?
Kay Thompson is wonnnnnddeerful as the charmingly obnoxious  Ms. Prescott--her entire brain is taken over with fashion and modeling  (""Think pink!"") She has the funniest lines in the entire  movie.
There's also good-natured poking at the fashion industry, which I  won't spoil for you. Needless to say that when you watch Marion the model  for more than a minute, you'll be guffawing!

245826,3,6300215598,"I feel that I should have really enjoyed this movie.  After all, it is a musical and a love story, it takes place in Paris, and it has Audrey Hepburn as the star.  Normally, only two of those need to apply and I am  hooked.
Not to be misunderstood, there are some very good things about  this movie.  Audrey Hepburn is lovely, as always, and having to believe she  is a model is not a stretch at all.  The clothes she wears are gorgeous,  and she is especially stunning in a white bridal gown.  It is refreshing to  hear her do her own singing and to see her perform a wacky dance  number.
Besides Ms. Hepburn's presence, there are the beautiful scenes of  Paris, Fred Astaire's dancing, and some lovely and some comical musical  numbers.  Add to that a nice little story about a nobody bookstore clerk  becoming the belle of the modeling world, and this movie should be one of  my hotpicks.  I ask myself why did I come away disappointed after watching  Funny Face.
Two aspects lacked in this movie.  First, the love story  lacked some writing.  Yes, it makes sense that Audrey Hepburn's character  would fall in love with her photographer, but why would the photographer  fall in love with her?  Second, Fred Astaire's character is not developed  well at all.  The most we learn about him is that he is a photographer.  I  lay this more at the writer's feet than Mr. Astaire's.
If you are  looking for a really good Audrey Hepburn movie, I would pass on this one  and watch My Fair Lady or Roman Holiday.  If all you want is a good Stanley  Donen musical, go for Singin' in the Rain.",963792000,4,1585,4.395833333333333
