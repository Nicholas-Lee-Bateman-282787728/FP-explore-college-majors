8324796,5,B0001Z4PJG,"This file was introduced by CUNY as part of a film exposition in Chinese film history. Very important film for those who want to know China in the cultural period before 1950. To know this women as portrayed by Gong Li is to understand China and their women in a more realistic repressive form. A must see especially for the younger Chinese generation of Chinese men and women who probably know little or nothing about Pan Yuliang. Truly a profile in courage. I have recommended this film to many of my Chinese students and friends. All were very impressed by what they
learned and felt a very strong attachment to the artist and her struggles.

I have seen this movie several times to fully grasp the conditions and frustration of this great artist and this period in Chinese culture. BTW ...some of these conditions still are an issue in China today.",1376697600,2,852,4.642384105960265
8324797,3,B0001Z4PJG,"""A Soul Haunted by Painting"" starring the incomparable Gong Li is one of her lesser publicized efforts, but no less commendable performances as the chinese painter, Pan Yuliang, whose work was largely rejected in China due to its nude content, but adored in Paris, where she ultimately studies and resides. The film follows the arc of her tortured existence, from being sold into prostitution as a teen, to her life as a minor wife of a Chinese Diplomat, to ultimately being posthumously regarded as one of the greatest painters of Chinese descent.

The detractions however, are not with this film, but with the quality of this DVD's release, which almost seems to be a copy, of a copy, of a print. Perhaps in some ways not even Gong Li's wonderful career and performance can save Pan Yuliang from what appears to be a continuos disregard, and minimalizing of her abilities and significance. The puzzling quality of this release in this day and age, is most assuredly no mistake.",1122249600,28,979,4.8273809523809526
