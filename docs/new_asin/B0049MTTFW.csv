4290563,4,B0049MTTFW,"Having been born in 1961, my memories of The Andy Williams Show are a bit fuzzy (although I remember his Christmas specials clearly).  My mother listened to his records all the time, and as a young child I would borrow them to play on my little portable phonograph.  What appealed to me about this collection was the variety of artists with whom Andy performed--Ray Charles, for example, my all-time favorite vocalist, is in fine form with his own orchestra as he and Andy simply have fun with the r'n'b classic ""What I'd Say"".  ""Scarborough Fair"" with Simon & Garfunkel (another favorite) is exquisite, with Andy, Art, and Paul trading parts as if they'd been singing together for a long time.  Andy even lends a little comic flair to his duets with Phil Harris (and the gospel quartet who, unfortunately, are uncredited on this disc), and with Pearl Bailey. Lena Horne, Judy Garland, Tony Bennett...how can you go wrong with a guest line-up like that. But my personal favorite performances are the two which feature performers with the closest personal ties to Andy Williams:  ""Hello Dolly"" with his protegees, the young (Donny-less) Osmond Brothers, who here, a couple years after having debuted as a cute barbershop quartet, have evolved into seasoned stage performers with undeniable charm and surprising stage presence; and ""Dream (When You're Feeling Blue)"" with his own brothers, The Williams Brothers, in a poignant reunion performance that set the stage for their annual appearances on Andy's Christmas specials.  Overall, this collection is a delight from start to finish. Andy Williams and musical director Dave Grusin, as well as Johnny Mathis, contribute personal insight to each performance.",1322697600,3,1706,5.140794223826715
4290564,5,B0049MTTFW,My son was stuck in the chair while us 50s generation folks watched this and he first ignored it and then was drawn into the immense talent and it's simple clean beauty. Wish this art form continued to this day alas.,1308960000,3,216,4.2926829268292686
4290565,5,B0049MTTFW,"I thoroughly enjoyed this composite of many Andy Williams shows.  I watched those programs originally and it was great to see Andy and all those great artists.  I especially liked seeing the Williams Brothers reunion, but the real highlight for me was Andy's duet with Simon & Garfunkel on ""Scarborough Fair"".  It was the most beautiful sound I have ever heard, and well worth purchasing the DVD just for that. But the entire DVD is a delight.",1304208000,5,443,4.7272727272727275
4290566,2,B0049MTTFW,IT'S SURPRISING TO ME THAT THIS DVD ONLY SHOWCASES A TINY MUSICAL CLIP OF MISS JUDY GARLAND ... IT'S ACTUALLY PATHETIC TO PUT A HOLLYWOOD LEGEND IN THE SAME CATEGORY OF SIMON & GARFUNKEL !,1301616000,,188,4.4
4290567,5,B0049MTTFW,"This DVD is for the musical listener and TV viewer with discernible good taste. Andy Williams'show was one of those great '60s song variety programmes,nowhere to be seen around today. The various performances by the elite of American music are priceless and timeless. Fabulous acts and classic songs that bring back the fond acoustic memories of yesteryear. His show had class,and still shines today.",1295740800,11,400,5.265625
8419128,4,B0049MTTFW,I recommend not buying this from Warehouse Deals LLC. It came crushed and I'm pretty sure it was a bootleg - cover was blurry and pixelated. Had to return.,1483660800,,155,4.379310344827586

8419130,5,B0049MTTFW,"Great retrospective by Andy of some of his favorites with stars like Tony Bennett, Pearl Bailey, Ray Charles, Judy Garland, Simon & Garfunkel, Peter Paul and Mary, the Osmond Brothers and his own Williams Brothers, and my beloved Julie Andrews.  The images are crisp and clear, the sound is great, and we are reminded of what a true variety show was like.  Andy was a great and easy host for so many years.  It made me really miss him and this type of entertainment.",1425945600,,466,4.523809523809524

8419133,5,B0049MTTFW,"I watched the Andy Williams Show growing up and couldn't wait to see it each week because of the excellent musical guests. Andy really knew how to sing with each person, coping their style. He'd blend in like he had always sung with them. I think singing with his brothers helped him sing with others.",1389225600,,301,4.490909090909091
8419134,5,B0049MTTFW,"This DVD is wonderful!  Andy himself introduces the performances.  And performances there are!  Some are unforgettable...all are memorable.  My favorite is the gentle swinger ""Give Me the Simple Life"" with Andy welcoming Pearl Bailey on his show.  Her musical timing along with Andy's make this worth the price of the DVD alone!  You will want to watch it over and over again..I have!  Enjoy!",1388016000,,392,5.03125
8419135,5,B0049MTTFW,"I forgot how effortless Andy Williams use to make his variety show.  This really showcases all the great ones that came on his show and joined in the fun and mutual respect for one another.  Great video I never get tired of popping in and listening to some of my favorite songs.  (Probably dates me, but I still love the ""classics""). From Julie Andrews to Ray Charles it can't be beat.  I especaily enjoyed watching Sammy Davis Jr., performing with Andy.  It's a keeper.",1376092800,,470,4.5476190476190474
8419136,3,B0049MTTFW,"Andy Williams performed ""Do Re Mi"" from 'The Sound of Music"" with Eddie fisher and Bobby Darin, it was great!
Why was not included here? And what about Andy singing ""Our Language of Love"" with Julie Andrews?
These two are available in BRAZIL, where I live....and I think only as natural to be available in the USA...",1364083200,,316,4.56140350877193
