7905181,5,B000007P8Y,"Farts, blow-up dolls , dean doyle, Chief Latrine, Splash, Gross-Out, and oh yes the fart contest. What else does a hit cult Frat comedy classic need. This movie is like watching a special sanitarium version of Animal  House. Some things in the movie almost seem to mirror Animal House, but  King Fart is much more appealing to the real raunchy Frat fellow inside.  The opening theme song kicks off this windy cinematic tale of a group of  vagrant struggling Frat guys who just happen to be the grossest characters  to ever grace the big screen. John Belushi clone John Disanti(later  starring in Batteries not included)stars as Gross-out Gumbroski (notice the  similarity to Belushi's Bluto Blutarsky). Gross-out is a fat vile guy who  is in love with an inflatable doll, and he also has an amazing knack for  releasing tremendous barking spiders throughout the film. chief Latrine is  the Frat's eldest member ; he is thirty years old and still in college. He  came from the KissaWong Indian tribe. The dramatic zenith in this movie  comes when the pressure is on Gross-Out to let a perfect fart in the final  round of the Daily Crock's first annual Fart contest. Gross-Out poses for  the perfect poot, but then a haunting scowl consumes Gross-Out's face and  the crowd sees and smells defeat. For Gross-Out has drawn mud. Anyway to  sum this movie up the Good Guys Pi- Kapps whom I have been speaking, are  being terrorized by the classic Jock Fraternity (The Alphas). In the end  The Pi-Kapps defeat the Alphas in a brawl(this scene includes hilarious  cuts of Gross-Out shooting tremedous flames out of his rear end by way of  his natural butt gas and a lighter). The Pi-Kapps prevail and Gross-Out  ends up being the Dean of Yellowstream College. God Bless unforgettagble  films like this!",961113600,7,1794,4.832236842105263
