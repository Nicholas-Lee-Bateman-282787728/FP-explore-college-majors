8257909,5,B00158QKDM,"This is a great short documentary...an inspiring woman journalist reading letters she wrote to the world during Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 2006, telling about what she saw and the people she spoke to, it's a poem and a scream about the cost of war...it's heart breaking of course, and the footage is beautifully done and equally heartbreaking, but infinitely worth watching. Those who remained in Lebanon after Israel invaded were those with nowhere else to go, their stories rarely make it into film, into books, onto the news...the most amazing were the family of women making coffee in their bombed out kitchen, laughing on the rubble of their home; they said that laughter was the only form of resistence they had left.  One of them pointed to a column and said that as long as a column stood she would be standing next to it, because this was their home.  Stories like that should be told more often. The cost of war should always be made more real. It is too easy for those far away to sanction or support what they do not understand.",1205798400,5,1045,4.612903225806452
