4836679,5,B005MRN3L4,"This was the beginnings of video broadcasting  back when TV was not the 24 hour a day business it is now.  One of the very first  medical dramas to air in prime time was MEDIC.  I saw the title MEDIC and I immediately was thinking hey a primative version of M*A*S*H and I was so wrong.  MEDIC takes place in a large medical center hospital complex where doctors not only cure disease but come face to face with the issues of the day.  This is 1950's TV so you can expect that many of the issues were sanitized by network censors so content is never offensive but is also not politically correct by todays standards.

Some of the medical treatments and procedures shown were state of the art at the time but would get todays doctors a malpractice suit were they tried in 2014.  MEDIC is an interesting look at in time.  Black folk have stereotypical lacky roles for the most part but there are some instances of black folk shown with realistic human dignity.  The backdrop for the series is often LA Medical Center Hospital Building one of the most beautiful hospital buildings ever designed.  Sadly the LA General Hospital was badly damaged in an earthquake and was replaced by a tiny ugly little mess of uninspired glass buildings that lack the stature of the old original.

I enjoyed MEDIC with its voice of God narration in the beginning sharing with you the subject of each episode.  There were more than 44 episodes of Medic so I must assume the others are lost at least for now.  The sound quality of the medic episodes is fair to good and the video is just barely fair at least on a 50 inch LED screen with 240 Mhz screen.  It's not the prettiest picture or the best sound for MEDIC but I found it worth its price so it earns my 5 star rating.",1398211200,5,1750,4.374613003095975
4836680,4,B005MRN3L4,"I remember this program from when I was a child.  I was impressed then and I still am now.  This may not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you are looking for a good old time you may enjoy this one.",1391817600,,197,3.6666666666666665
4836681,5,B005MRN3L4,"The quality is iffy with some episodes, but that's ok, we're lucky to have what we have. My only wish is that the rest of the episodes were made available so I can have the full two seasons of this ground-breaking show.",1376697600,,219,4.238095238095238
4836682,5,B005MRN3L4,"We loved watching this historic Series which was very informative and helpful in understanding the verious aspects of the pratice of medicne also, the verious afflictions facing our human nature.  What was most helpful was how people reacted and delt with the given situations people face.  A great series well worth the investment.  Happy Amazon made this available that I thought was lost in time.",1376611200,,399,5.107692307692307
4836683,5,B005MRN3L4,"I had several episodes of this show released by Alpha which were nearly unwatchable. This set from Timeless Is 100 times better. While the picture is scratchy, the audio is very good and haven't seen any ""cuts"" in the video on any of the episodes. I highly recommend this set to anyone who likes this show. Step back into a time when doctors really cared about their patients and not their pocketbooks.",1350604800,3,402,4.597222222222222
4836684,5,B005MRN3L4,"Medic is an example of a golden age of TV that was primitive, yet packed with powerful drama and characters. No tricks, just classic drama, and all in a living, faded, black and white picture. Medic's gripping stories sometimes leave you with a heavy heart because the world of medicine does not always lead to a happy ending. These are real stories about real people suffering the real ""slings and arrows of outrageous fortune"" one moment and the miracles of gut-wrenching medical procedures the next. Richard Boone shows the great talent that was to develop in later years. He died too soon at sixty-three. For me, Victor Young's ""Medic Theme"" will always be one of my favorite screen melodies. Powerful stuff and worthy of the drama it underscores with soaring beauty. Add Medic to your library to learn how much  sincere artists achieved with so little. As Shakespeare said: ""The play's the thing...."" With Medic you don't need or miss ""special effects."" Even today's sophisticated viewers, escept for the truly jaded, will enjoy most of these episodes. Recommended highly!",1343520000,9,1077,5.016759776536313
4836685,5,B005MRN3L4,The product is exactly what I expected and maybe even a little better. Realistic stories based on factual cases and accurate medical information. I recommend it for anyone interested in the medical field in the 1950s.,1342915200,2,217,5.055555555555555
4836686,5,B005MRN3L4,I am so happy they put this on DVD. I only wish they would put all the seasons on DVD.....maybe soon. It won't play on my computer. You have to watch it from a DVD player....weird!,1331424000,2,180,4.027777777777778
4836687,5,B005MRN3L4,"Medic. This series I bought sight unseen because of Richard Boone. I then found out it was created by James E Moser who would later go on to create ""Ben Casey"".I really liked that show. It was my favourite medical show of all. There was 59 episodes made but Timeless Media Group have managed to get their hands on only 44 episodes. This is a great series,gripping ,harrowing,enlightning,entertaining and realistic as most of the shows are taken from actual files. What this series does is go into detail about the patients and the ailments and procedures. It plays almost like a documentary. It may feel a bit static as this was early TV and there were limited camera movements and sets. But actual operations on camera as well making us think about how our organs work so hard inside us to keep us living is amazing. There are a few young actors in it that would go onto greater things and become household names like John Saxon,Dennis Hopper to name two. This series shows how things have changed as in one episode that starred Lee J Cobb which deals with electric-shock treatment which we now know has been banned from practice. There are some flecks and specs on the film but that did not upset my viewing pleasure. A great series in my opinion. Thanks Timeless Media Group for releasing this DVD.",1328400000,19,1301,4.612068965517241

8479695,5,B005MRN3L4,"I just wish to say that I wished that the later doctor shows were like this one. Real stories with real doctors and real nurses rather than scriptwriten fictional stories with actors playing doctors. Not all the ""doctors"" in Medic were real doctors, but several of them were. This is by far the best medical series I've seen.",1468800000,,325,4.620689655172414
8479696,3,B005MRN3L4,"As was reported by others, picture and sound quality was not the greatest, but remember that this was a mid-fifties TV series and the technology of today has raised our expectations.  I enjoyed many of the episodes, especially those where you actually got to see a major surgical procedure.  Some of the shows were a little soapy, but still OK.  You may be surprised to see a number of future stars in what must have been very early appearances.  My only big disappointment was that the one episode that I really wanted to see was not included in the collection.  It was called, ""A room, a boy and Mr. Bodine"".  It was powerful and spoke to me as a youngster, since it was about a youngster that died as a result of his parents indifference and neglect.",1442534400,,753,4.45985401459854

8479698,5,B005MRN3L4,"Excellent show! Given only 30 minutes, the show presents a plot designed to show how different medical cases were handled at the time the show was made. While the plot may be a bit thin, the medical details are supported by numerous medical consultants on each show that played a large part in making THAT part of the show almost documtentary in nature. I understand filming often took place at actual Hospitals (Consultants possibly all too available to HELP the crew toe the mark for keeping details correct?)",1433980800,,511,4.818181818181818

8479701,5,B005MRN3L4,"Although very dated in terms of today's medical advancements, this groundbreaking early medical series is still worth watching.  All stories were closely supervised by actual doctors/surgeons who also starred in each show along with various actors who were stars in their own right at the time.  Medic was the first medical drama series of its kind on 1950's T.V. and led to many other successful spin-off medical series such as Ben Casey, Dr. Kildare, Medical Center, Trapper John and others.  Richard Boone, probably best known for his Have Gun, Will Travel  Western series,  is awesome as Dr. Konrad Steiner and attests to his other than Western character diverse acting abilities.  Great old T.V.  Give it a watch.",1419379200,3,718,5.085470085470085
