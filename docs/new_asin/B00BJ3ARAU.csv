8569350,5,B00BJ3ARAU,"This movie had a lot of shortcoming for sure, but ultimately it made me laugh on more that one occasion. The cast is made up of a lot of familiar faces, and while they may not all be A listers, but its clear that all the actors in this movie had a good time making it. It's funny, original, and very worth a late night viewing with friends and alcohol. Check it out.",1375142400,,366,4.027397260273973

8569352,2,B00BJ3ARAU,"Henry and Herbert (Jamal and Jerod Mixon) have entered an LA rap concert. Meanwhile a tee-shirt company is having a contest with a winning tee-shirt that has a gold tag. The contest was rigged and rapper Kevin (Robbie Kaller) was supposed to get the shirt, but our crew got there first.

This film is star studded with seasoned actors and Eric Roberts playing a gay Ricardo. Neon Deion, Tone Loc, Chyna, Faizon Love, Tommy 'Tiny' Lister, and Tony Cox all have roles. The film consisted of a lot of fat jokes, fat guys like to eat, and some booty humor...all of which was juvenile in nature and execution. None of which was funny. The xenophobic bell hop was a real down point and some of the jokes were in bad taste such as when the detective said ""go home and have fun with the wife and r******* kid.""

These brothers have been on the big-screen in some of the BIGGEST>no pun intended recent comedy classics in recent memory.

I have to say I really enjoyed the film, it was well shot, the casting director did a wonderful job at mixing variety with well-advertised talent.

THEY BUILT A SOUNDTRACK ALONGSIDE THE FILM AS WELL!!

8569354,4,B00BJ3ARAU,"I once was at the grocery store with my six children & decided on making it a movie night. Of course when looking through the various titles, what grabs my kids attention the most was WHITE T. (the box cover with two over-weight males and a goat hiding behind a shirt).

The film is rated R, and I for one am usually not keen to letting my children watch what is in the wild marketplace that is sometimes. But,the kids and myself, we ended up making this selection the driving force to our family movie night. I was pleasantly surprised at the content & found the chemistry between Jamal & Jerod Mixon very enlightening. The plot thickens tremendously once they wake-up with their garment missing.

I'd say it's worthy of a rental...... heck, it's only $1.00 anymore anyways.

4 out 5

I reccommend.",1367366400,2,799,4.566433566433567
8569355,4,B00BJ3ARAU,"WHITE T **** The journey of two brothers desperately in need of some fresh new gear for an upcoming rap-battle.
Typically independent movies are missing several links from the chain, whether that be recognizable talent, lavish story-telling locations, high-quality principle photography, or just an overall good well-written story concept. Generally these sorts of films miss on several of those elements just cause of the shear fact their trying to make a mountain out a of a molehill.

1. The cast in this movie was funny. Not hilarious........ but definitely funny.
2. The locations were plenty. They had clubs, concert venues, interior car-mounts, time-piece cinematography, narration by a celebrity voice, and several high-budget crane shots.

This movie is WORTHY of a late-night rental. Will you watch this thing one-hundred times over? no probably not........ but I assure you, laughing out loud on several scenes will not be a problem.

I was pleasantly surprised at this film, very-well executed........ for a black film no less. (not to disrespect our race, but let's be honest....... we're not executing well done films regularly).

4 out of 5",1367366400,3,1155,5.295081967213115
8569356,4,B00BJ3ARAU,"So far 2013 has not brought out any urban films except for Haunted House...... which if I remember correctly this film played in the trailer section for H.H.
I found the story a little-bit crazy........ but the cinema of the movie itself was definately good quality.
Lamorne Morris, from New Girl had a small cameo.
Deion Sanders had a role in the film.

4 out of 5...... worth renting. The production is GOOD.",1367280000,3,410,4.616438356164384
