8081817,3,B000B5XP9W,"This is falsely advertised. ""The Return of the Androids"" is not in this Volume.  The episode is a classic, and I was disappointed to find it replaced by an episode from another Volume.",1388707200,,184,4.575757575757576
8081818,5,B000B5XP9W,"All of the episodes from this 1950's series are great!  Don't so much lower your standards -- just broaden them a little.  If you can summon up a little of what it was to be a wide-eyed, awe-inspired youngster in the 50's, and NOT compare this series to all of the technological advances of the last 30 years, you just might find yourself having a lot of fun.  Back when they had a $1,000 budget per episode (or whatever it was), and we were still years from even launching our first satellite in to space, much less flying to the Moon, they had to use a lot of guesswork as to what space/space travel was like.  They used their imaginations, and were so off-base sometimes that it is laughable now, but it wasn't then for the simple fact that we didn't know any better.  This is just one of the things that gives this series, and others like it, their charm.  Tom Corbett, Space Cadet, is another fine example.  Oh for those simpler, naive, gullible days when we didn't have a clue whether any of this stuff was possible, and we didn't give a hoot!  We just wanted to be entertained, and to dream, and this show did a fantastic job to those ends!",1251158400,8,1147,4.327102803738318
