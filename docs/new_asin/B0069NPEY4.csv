I hope they come out with a show or reality show about this they will get great high ratings they should keep the Marriage counselors. BRAVO!!!,1342742400,,272,4.6875
4980541,5,B0069NPEY4,"This movie was on point and to the point. This is a much needed movie in our current times of the status of marriages in all cultures, but especially in the African American culture.. you can and will learn a whole lot from this movie

Each marriage in this movie goes through challenges that are reality. This shows the solutions to those issues as well. The characters are great and do an excellent job. I want to see more movies like this on the same subject matter with the solutions because this is needed to save the marriages of today.. Too many give up and too many stand for nothing and as the movie says don't prepare for the marriage.

The movie is so deep and needs to be seen by couples who are thinking about marriage and ones who are married. This has great music, scenery, you name it this has it.. The movie is quality.

We are already watching this for a second time and will continue to watch this over and over again. This is clean truth that family and friends can watch together.. Start a save marriage campaign in your community.

As the movie said the number one reason marriages fail is because we do not prepare.. And also we as women do need to ask our mates how can we help them. We may just think that they can handle things on their own. even if they tell us they can, we still need to ask how we can help.

We all change, but we should not let those changes tear our marriages apart. Remember as the movie stated one person's trash is someone else's treasure!

Please make more movies like this.. They are needed.

Keep praying for all marriages to be restored to better than what they were.. The divorce rate in the African American community is too high. Lets change this.. we can do it if we try and stand for something..

Buy one for yourself and buy more as gifts! From a married mother of more than four children.. stay prayed up.

Enjoy!",1340755200,,1875,4.319088319088319
4980542,5,B0069NPEY4,"I saw this movie on cable, BET, and I was very surprised.  Thought I might not like it but I did.

It was funny, had good teaching lesson for couples and should have opened mens eyes to what women
want, need and like. Men are always into themselves and being served by a woman, and not about
what a woman needs to keep their marriage or relationship going on the good track.

When you keep a woman happy and feeling good about the two of you, she gives you loads of love,
and loving situations that will keep a man happy.  It works both ways, but the woman is often
the first to feel neglected and empty because men are always into themselves.

Into the games on TV, sports, the boys, work, playing BB, etc.  They love to do guy things and
forget to include their partner into their lives.  But you must learn to do both and balance
both.  A woman is always trying to keep it all going and, it is impossible without the help and love
of the male partner.

Give not 50/50 to the relationship, but give 100/100 to the relationship.  Above all, LISTEN,
HEAR WHAT YOUR PARTNER IS SAYING, because they will tell you how they are feeling and doing.
If they are happy, or unhappy, they will let you know. YOU've GOT TO LISTEN, RESPOND, FIX,
AND ALL WILL BE WELL. If need be, get help from pastor, couple therapist, marriage counselor.
If your marriage or relationship mean anything to you, you will do all you can to save it and
keep it happy and loving.

HAPPY ROMANCE & LOVE TO ALL:",1335916800,12,1477,4.276978417266187
