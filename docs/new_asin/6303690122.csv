704722,4,6303690122,"This is an old video (1995) that some might dismiss as irrelevant, given the recent ""confession"" by Ray Santilli that the alien autopsy was actually a REENACTMENT of what was captured on the original footage (1947).  I, for one, do not buy the ""confession.""  If one reads Michael Hesemann's book Beyond Roswell, one comes away with a firm conviction that the original footage is genuine and that there is no ""reenactment"" involved in the film footage that Santilli released to the public.
What Hesemann related in his book is the strong likelihood of a UFO crash near Magdalena, NM, on May 31, 1947, and the capture of several humanoids--such as the one seen in the autopsy.  This was NOT the famous Roswell crash of July, 1947, and Hesemann makes this perfectly clear in his book.  The fact that so many people made the FALSE connection between this autopsy film and the crash near Roswell is one of the reasons why this film has been rejected as a hoax.  UFO researchers have also rejected the Santilli film because the ""alien"" does not resemble the typical ""Zeta Reticuli gray"" and because the ""alien"" is simply too human looking.  However, the UFO phenomenon includes the existence of several types of aliens, including ""humanoids"" such as those reported by Paul Bennewitz at Dulce.  I feel that the Santilli ""humanoid"" is just one of the several types of aliens/humanoids that UFO researchers need to learn about if they ever hope to solve the UFO ""mystery.""
I am giving this video FOUR stars, rather than five, because of the insipid dialog interjected by the narrator, Jonathan Frakes.",1229385600,4,1592,4.85239852398524

Living Colour  would go on to change my mind.  I remember thinking while watching this, that anyone in Government wouldn't have let a moron hold the camera- because of all the out of focus shots, shakey angles, etc.  I remember also thinking that if this was in fact a real Alien Autopsy, there would have been real scientists present, not some bozo who clearly didn't use the right medical equipment in their procedure-  I'm no expert at manual instrumental operations but I'm a factory worker and even I know a scapel from a fork.  But here's the good news:  the people who made this hoax came forward and admitted it was all a joke. So buy this if you want to watch one of the greatest hoaxes ever televised on national television-  another great american hoax would be Bush's rally speech following 9-11.

***UPDATE: April 17th, 2013 -

In case anyone is interested in this Alien Autopsy business anymore....  This hoax all started when a film released around 1994?, by a London based entrepreneur named Ray Santilli and film producer Gary Shoefield claimed to be an authentic alien autopsy that was performed on an alien found at the infamous 1947 Roswell UFO crash. Ray Santilli claimed the film was given to him by an unidentified military camerman.  In 2006 a british comedy called ALIEN AUTOPSY came out and it was a humorous version of the story- however, before the comedy was released, a documentary about the film came out also in 2006 called Eamonn Investigates: Alien Autopsy (presented by Eamonn Holmes) in which Ray Santilli stated that the alien autopsy film he has, is in fact a reconstruction of a film he supposedly saw back in 1992- he claimed what he saw was a film that was so deteriorated that he decided to reconstruct what he saw and use what little bits of surviving footage from that film he viewed, and add it into the reconstructed version. Now of course all of this sounds absolutely ridiculous.  Because then he went on to say that he and Gary Shoefield had went out and found a homeless man and paid him to be filmed in a hotel room pretending to be the original cameraman who filmed the original alien autopsy footage. So in the end it certainly is one of the greatest hoaxes ever-  Because to this day, even after Ray Santilli has admitted it was a hoax, there are thousands upon thousands who refuse to believe it is a hoax.  And THAT in itself is what makes it one of the greatest hoaxes of all time.",1170633600,2,2572,4.5630434782608695
704726,2,6303690122,"Twenty years ago I was a Motion Picture Specialist in the US Marine Corps. There are rules for documenting high profile and secret events and situations. Specifically you lock your camera down on a tripod with the best angle of view to the subject as possible. You hold the shot and always work toward clarity.

Had this been a visual documentation of such an event the protocol would have been to cover everything as steadily, clearly and in focus at all times. Handheld or on tripod. There would have been no shaky or out of focus camera work and each ""organ part"" would have been carefully and clearly presented to the camera (multiple cameras would have been likely had this been a real event) for documentation and future study. Camera guys back then we far better at hand held filming than any non-feature film operator today. There was a lot of discipline involved when shooting handheld back then. The camera work in the Autopsy video was clearly shot to make it hard to see what was happening on the operating table. The exact opposite of what would have happened had such an event taken place.

I'm a civilian now and I do a lot of operating theater video work with surgeons. They have always been more than helpful in providing the camera with a clean clear shot of whatever procedure I'm filming. Military officers doubly so as they understand the importance of proper documentation.

BTW, during the visual documentation of something as important as the discovery of an alien life form there would assuredly be not only multiple film cameras but still photographers using large format film as well. Lastly, the motion picture camera and film would have been color 35mm not black and white 16mm.

I'm a Jonathan Frakes fan so I say buy it so he gets his royalty check besides it's a hoot to watch but please don't try to pretend it's real.",1167868800,14,1851,4.668711656441718
704727,5,6303690122,"I think we can assume that this video is real.  The video speaks for itself.  The burden of proof is on those who say it's a hoax.

However we are left with the dilemna that a race of beings that are advanced enough to travel through outer space would not crash their space ships on the earth.

So how can we account for this apparent discrepancy of logic ?

The answer is that these creatures are evil.

I read an interview given by the camera man.  He said the sheep in the area around the crash site were very agitated.  This is probably because the animals could sense the horrible occult energy.

(He calls the alien creatures ""the freaks"".)

Still this is a great video and very thought provoking.  Somehow fate allowed us to find out the truth about the Roswell incident.

Interestingly the creatures have 6 fingers and 6 toes.  The number 6 of course has implications in the bible as being associated with evil.

Who knows what the government knows or what types of technology they have.

I heard a rumor recently that a plane never struck the pentagon on 9/11 but rather it was a conventional missile.

Maybe they put the real plane back with the dinosaurs or something like this.

A lot of people interested in the Roswell crash would probably be interested in the following book:

Ufo...Contact from Planet Iarga
by Stefen Denaerde, Wendelle C. Stevens (Hardcover - June 1982)

This book is not about alien abductions, UFOs crashing, etc..

It's a serious account of information supposedly provided by beings from another planet called Iarga which is 14 light years from earth.

This is incorrect. Although the PACKAGING makes no reference to the bonus footage and lists the program running time as approximately 46 minutes, the ""autopsy footage"" is indeed featured after the end credits. My original review has been deleted with apologies to those who were misinformed.

(Speaking of misinformed - aliens may well exist, but THIS is fake. Santilli admitted so a few years back. Still an entertaining little piece of fluff, though.)",1137024000,2,634,4.81651376146789
704729,5,6303690122,"In the mid-1990s, the release of the purported 1947 alien autopsy film footage divided the UFO community (which was probably the whole point) and generated a lot of attention nationwide, attention which Fox quickly made us of in the production of this documentary concerning the film. A majority of interested parties viewed the film with great suspicion early on and rather quickly came to the conclusion that it was a hoax, but the great believability of the film's nature allowed many to look upon it as authentic. Combine this with the similar debate over the alleged MJ-12 documents, for both seem to be interconnected in my mind, and you have the makings of one of two things: definite smoking guns or else dangerous sources of disinformation. Whatever you believe, the alien autopsy footage itself is still fascinating to watch, and this video does an excellent job of presenting the evidence in a fair and balanced manner.

The video, hosted by Jonathan Frakes, begins by touching upon the history of the Roswell incident in 1947, featuring interviews with such well-known witnesses as Walter Haut, the public relations officer at Roswell Army Air Base, Dr. Jesse Marcel, the son of the man who first examined the wreckage and brought some of the evidence home to show his wife and son before returning with it to the base, and other Roswell eyewitnesses. It then features Ray Santilli giving his story on the finding of this alien autopsy footage - this includes much of the information that makes the story such a dubious one. Then it shows a number of scenes from the alien autopsy itself - you will not find the complete autopsy film itself here in its entirety, however.

Then you get the opinions of assorted experts. Film specialists are asked if the film could have been made in 1947 (although the fact that Kodak was given film samples outside of what you find in the autopsy film is not mentioned), a World War II cameraman is asked to comment on the troublesome habit of the film going in and out of focus a great deal, medical experts including Dr. Cyril Wecht are asked to give their opinion on the medical aspects of what they are seeing in the film, and special effects experts such as Stan Winston are asked for their impressions of authenticity. This FOX TV special did not go hip deep into the evidence, unfortunately, but it did indeed leave the final answer to the film's authenticity up to the viewer. It gave equal time to those who think the footage is authentic and those who brand it a hoax for a number of different reasons.

Finally, the video features new film reportedly taken of some of the UFO wreckage from Roswell; this, to me, is even more dubious than the autopsy film. Personally, I think this film and the MJ-12 documents that a few ufologists continue to defend in such a personal manner are deliberate sources of disinformation intended to divert and weaken the UFO community. In any event, though, this particular documentary represents an excellent presentation of the autopsy film evidence and the debate over its authenticity back in 1995.",1127692800,3,3090,4.793621013133208

704803,3,6303690122,"Well you are pretty much left to make up your own mind.

The footage is archived very well and all the instruments seem to be within the 1947 period. But the camera mans inability to get the best shot when the surgeon is sawing open the head starts to give the footage away as being a hoax.

But why put together such good footage then do something like unprofessional camera work.

A navy camera man backs up the conclusion as to why the camera man doesnt get the best shot. But i'm still skeptical because the camera man could have stood on the other side of the surgery table and recorded the cutting of the head or the cutting open of the body. Instead he moves in to close and the picture goes fuzzy as they are hiding something. Why doesnt he stand back the image would then not be distorted. It seems strange to put together some really good footage and then when it comes to the best shots the image becomes blurry.",1109376000,2,923,4.293103448275862

Aliens? No, of course not. The gullible. Anyone who took this irresponsible garbage at face value should never buy a used car. Aside from the numerous problems mentioned by other reviewers (most especially the fact that the ""autopsy"" of totally unknown beings from another planet, unquestionably the single most important scientific event in history, consisted of pulling out ""innards"" and plopping them unceremoniously in buckets), the ""Alien"" and its ""anatomy"" were as obviously fake as any two-bit carny half-snake half-woman. {In fact, I was reminded of a sideshow exhibit I saw as a child--the Amazing Amazon Mummy! Supposedly the mummified body of a 7 foot tall female amazon warrior, when you looked closely you could see the whole thing was made on a wooden frame, and you could see the nails holding it together!} The Hollywood special effects artists who claimed not to be able to create something so ""realistic"" obviously meant that if they did, they'd never work in show business again. Anyone with a half-decent imagination, a hundred bucks for costume rental, and a bucket or two of chicken guts could do as well. Shame on everyone involved in this!

I do have one bit of praise for the video: It is the greatest hoax ever put together on film. The alien can actually be convincing sometimes and looks well-made before the ""doctors"" begin cutting it open. And the documentary as a whole is well-produced, letting both sides have their say on the issue. Put I judge this on the Alien Autopsy itself, and it is fake. First, Ray Santilli who claims to have obtained the footage for this ""secret cameraman,"" has already been proven a liar. It has been discovered that he also tried to fake a previous, less high-quality alien autopsy video.  Even the guy who played the dead alien was found and pointed the finger at naughty old Ray as the guy behind the fake. The explanation for how he got the footage is bogus. According to Santilli, the cameraman said that he filmed this and other footage of the Roswell crash and sent the film to Washington, but the canister containing the autopsy we see, needed special treatment and when he finally developed it, Washington didn't want it. I don't know, but if I were behind a big conspiracy covering up the truth about UFOs, I would make sure to pick-up ALL of the visual evidence pertaining to the alien bodies. So how is it that they just let this guy keep it? The autopsy itself looks corny. Instead of really examining this alien, they're just tearing it apart, bit by bit. And the insides look like bad soup. And the stomach looks a bit too large, as if it was made specifically to put so much gooey junk into it to pass it off as ""organs"" or whatever. The documentary also shows footage of the wreckage of the supposed space vehicle, yet no explanation is given to how THAT film was obtained. The alien is simply slabbed on a table, instead of using the instruments usually used to raise the body to do a formal autopsy. They never seem to actually be examining anything at all, and who spends only 2 hours on an alien corpse? If there is footage of aliens recovered at Roswell, this ain't it. Whoever made it should go work at Hollywood instead of wasting good talent on a cheap fake. In the end, this is a great fake.",981158400,6,2206,4.446913580246914

There's two parts to this DVD, the documentary and the autopsy.

The Documentary: Very interesting and very well done. It's actually really convincing, had I not looked up the legitimacy of the film prior to watching I probably would've taken it as authentic. There may be some portions that viewers could find ways to be skeptical of, but overall it's very convincing. Interviews come from those ""involved"" with the actual crash landing of the aliens to people that were asked to comment on the footage. It's really nice because you see people that both agree and disagree with the authenticity of the footage, it constantly argues with itself. The story of the crash landing and the way it involves quite a vast network of people is interesting. Really just a very cool documentary that makes a great preservation of this historic piece of cinema. It's a great conversation piece too.

But many of you are probably looking at this DVD for the second part: The Autopsy. While the documentary was neat it is definitely not for everyone and (knowing it's fake) isn't worth too many re-watches. The autopsy though is just fantastic! The special fx are top notch, the environment has such a secretive feel to it. The whole thing just plays out really spooky. There isn't too much to say about it, it's just the full (20mins or so) documentary of the alien in black and white. Really cool shots and great effects. This part alone makes the purchase worth it and definitely deserves multiple watches.

THE SHORT REVIEW:
Although confirmed by the creator to be fake this DVD has a neat documentary and an excellent 20min full autopsy of the alien that makes for a fun watch in a horror movie marathon or a halloween night.",1446768000,,1923,4.6973293768546
