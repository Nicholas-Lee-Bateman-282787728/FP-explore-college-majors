8374465,2,B002MZZU4W,"[SURBURBAN ROULETTE -(1967)- Directed by Herschell Gordon Lewis]  Early pioneer of the infamous 60's ""nudie cuties"" and no-budget horror flicks (though some had their moments regardless) H.G.Lewis again strikes out in what's probably the first American film involving suburban wife-swapping. Yessiree folks: Infidelity! Booze parties! Drugs! Orgies! And of course, backyard barbecues! Well, before you say ""Sign me up"", let me advise all potential viewers that this flick's tame, even by 1967's standards, and there's nary a sign of nudity, profanity or sleaze to be had anywhere. It's a cheesy soap opera morality play that teases and never delivers - it's like trying to get a lap dance at a christian singles get together, so pass on this one. There may only be one bullet in the chamber when playing Russian Roulette, but I can assure you that you'll be the one biting the bullet after this purchase.",1312416000,3,904,5.108108108108108

Some great sexy swim suits and lingerie though.  I wish the blond in this flick woulda got topless!!",1296518400,2,242,4.5813953488372094
8374467,3,B002MZZU4W,"I enjoyed ""Suburban Roulette"" more than I thought I would. I'm not sure about the swinging lifestyle and didn't think this movie was for me. However, Herschell Gordon Lewis, who doesn't shy away from the exploitation of the subject, manages to probe the complexities of such arrangements. A single relationship is complex enough without adding more relationships. Yes, you will multiply the fun, but you multiply the hang-ups too.
Characters are one-dimensional, but I guess that's what you expect when you have to keep track of a number of interacting characters. A moral film despite the subject matter.
I am disappointed in the packaging of Sinister Video DVD-Rs. The film's title is misspelt on the side of the cover and there is no info about the film and its credits on the back. I think I should have bought the Something Weird DVD instead.",1281225600,2,847,4.888888888888889
