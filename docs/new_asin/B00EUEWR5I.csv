5944168,5,B00EUEWR5I,"I may not have been able to attend these concerts but this is definitely the next best thing.  The wife and I both enjoy them. Freddie Mercury May be dead but he was incredibly talented and was great to watch on stage. This was an excellent deal, and we thought well worth the money",1392854400,2,282,4.222222222222222
5944169,4,B00EUEWR5I,"This is a nice package if you are on a budget and you don't have any of them ( I just had to have Rio, what can I say).  If you are not on a budget and you can still find them I would reccommend getting the Rock Montreal +Live Aid Blu Ray, the live at Wembley 2 cd / 2 dvd import and the Hungarian Rhapsody Blu Ray. Then if you want another one get the Live at The Bowl.  Montreal and Wembley are my two favorites, and if you can only get two those would be my picks.

(5-2014 update.  I see where the price went up since I bought.  I would reccommend price shopping the concerts.  Rio is not a must unless you are compulsive like me. )

On to this box set.  It is packaged nicely.  Each concert is in it's own case and housed in a box. I was pleased with that , I hate the new trend toward paper sleeves. I docked a star because in my opinion  they really should have included the Montreal blu ray, + Live Aid along with the dvd version and the Hungarian Rhapsody blu ray and dvd. They did not include Live Aid or Hungarian Rhapsody at all. The Live in Rio is the weakest of these releases and possibly should have just been considered as an ""extra"" The distance shots are somewhat grainey although the close in shots are very clear.  The set list is shorter than Montreal and Wembley.  Two songs I was looking forward to were Liar (one of my favorites) and It's A Hard Life.  Liar was a shortened version Hard Life was complete.  I was surprised that I enjoyed Love of my Life, Freddie hardly sang any of it, the crowd sang almost the whole song.  I usually don't like that, but his interaction with the crowd on the song was enjoyable.  I can't speak to the sound really, I just use my TV speakers not a sound system.  The sound was fine thru the TV.",1388275200,4,1753,4.0641399416909625
5944170,1,B00EUEWR5I,"Brian May, and to a lesser extent, Roger Taylor, couldn't milk more blood from a stone if they tried! And boy are they trying! I think, if memory serves, there's three versions (on DVD) of Wembley, and two versions of Montreal, and now a second of Queen On Fire. Sad. Sad. Sad. I saw Queen seven times (Hartford and New Haven CT; Syracuse NY) from 1977 1980 and I have everything, and then some, they recorded, as well as Freddie's solo efforts, including the hard-to-find 12-disc box set. I have collectibles, programs, banners, and all the rest. And now I'm hearing Queen on many television commercials, or on news shows when they are cutting to sports (We Will Rock You?). But really. THIS HAS GOT TO STOP!!! How many Fn times can Brian ""remaster"" a ""remaster"" to make it more ""Bohemian-esque"" in its presentation. Queen didn't start in the mid-80s, but that's all we are being fed. There's a treasure trove of 70s Queen, which is what the consumer wants on DVD. And I know, because some of it is on laserdisc, and I own them. But to keep milking the Queen cow which included Freddie is an abomination, and just makes them seem like the greediest and saddest people in rock music today. Mention Queen and you'll get someone to roll their eyes because they have become a joke. I'm with John Deacon all the way. And no matter how many MORE times you release this garbage, I won't be buying it, and neither will my friends. It's sad. Just sad. They've got the ""new"" Queen with Adam Lambert, the WE WILL ROCK YOU theatre show, the QUEEN EXTRAVAGANZA with four (or eight) people selected by BM and RT, touring. C'mon. Isn't this enough? How about the Rainbow concert? The legendary Houston 1977 concert? We all know you have the stuff, because we must resort to ""other measures"" to obtain what we know already exists. Sure, it's damn tragic Freddie died at the age of 45 in 1991 to AIDS, but WHERE IS ALL THIS MONEY GOING? Not to the Phoenix Trust, I'm sure.",1386028800,7,1956,4.512676056338028
5944171,1,B00EUEWR5I,"I absolutely love Queen.  I am a huge fan and consider them the most important, creative and innovative rock band of the past 40 years.  BUT...  Making people buy three concert DVDs that they've likely already purchased more than once in various forms....  to get the new Live In Rio release....  is shameless and disgusting.  Put out Live in Rio on it's own.  They'll likely wait until they sap as many fans as possible on buying the entire set of 4 concerts... and then release Rio on it's own.  I will hope and wait.  Look, if you don't have all the concerts, it's a great deal with alot of great performances.  I had the Rio set on VHS back in the day and loved the show.  But if this is what I have to do to get it.... I'll do without.",1385683200,8,740,4.177304964539007
5944172,4,B00EUEWR5I,"Great set of shows previously released and boxed together. They show their age but that's to be expected for the time period they were shot in. Most Queen fans are going to already own Wembley, Montreal and On Fire so the question here is the Rio show and my recommendation (and this is coming from a huge Queen fan) is to pass on buying the box just to get that show. It's the least professional looking of the bunch, the songs are pretty much duplicated on the other shows and if you really want a copy of it, it's readily available elsewhere online if you do some searching. However, if you don't have copies of the other shows, it's a solid purchase.",1384992000,13,654,4.368852459016393

8609523,5,B00EUEWR5I,"Not much to say here. . . have personally seen them nine times from 1976 thru 1982. They were one of a kind on tour. If you are a Queen fan, this is a must have! Period! Enough said!",1408233600,,182,3.6923076923076925
8609524,5,B00EUEWR5I,"For me, this was an incredible deal:  I get to maximize my Queen experience all in one box.  But I've only just begun this journey:  so many facets to the legendary Queen and especially Freddie, none of which I knew anything about while going through  high school and college in the 70's.  My loss back then, but better late than never:  pure unadulterated talent and versatility is the real test of great artistry; Freddie and Queen have surpassed all tests of time by having the ability to turn this former disco queen  into a fan of Queen!!",1405728000,2,543,4.536082474226804
