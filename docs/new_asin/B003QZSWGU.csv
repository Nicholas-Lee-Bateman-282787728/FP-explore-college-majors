8402719,5,B003QZSWGU,Great to be close to the action!,1456963200,,32,3.7142857142857144
8402720,5,B003QZSWGU,"Arrived promptly and in good condition.  Of course anything by Michel Legrand if wonderful.  He sings in this CD, I love it.  His piano chording is better than all.",1352160000,,164,4.586206896551724
8402721,3,B003QZSWGU,Obscure collection that just didn't quite convince us the artistry of Michell Legrand. Melissa Manchester and Sting are the most noteworthy of interprerting Michell's songs The Summer Of 42 & What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life.,1295136000,,233,5.0
8402722,1,B003QZSWGU,"I had read reviews at the time from people who had attended this concert at the MGM Grand, and thought at the time, surely they must be exaggerating about how bad it was, but boy, were they right, and then some. This is the worst live tribute show I have ever seen, and it is astonishing they allowed it to be released. Every performance bar none is worse than amateur, grossly unrehearsed, from the hosts to the stars....avoid at all costs",1286582400,,440,4.444444444444445
8402723,5,B003QZSWGU,"Michel Legrand really knows how to keep the music playing. His excellence of mind and musical achievements during the past fifty years as a singer, pianist and composer have been grandiose. The music he has written for over 200 movies and over 100 sound recordings, as well as his contributions to music in general and Jazz, are extraordinary. Michel Legrand is unique and his 50th. Anniversary Concert is simply a tour de force.",1286150400,,429,4.890410958904109
8402724,2,B003QZSWGU,"Michel Legrand is a wonderful composer,pianist & arranger-but this DVD is terrible. Singers on it-especially Sinatra Jr.,Patti Page & Andy Williams sound horrible. George Benson seems like he forgot the lyrics to Watch What Happens. Why was Jerry Lewis involved with this? The 2 hosts acted like this was the first time they ever did a show. All in all--a poor experience. Buy a Legrand CD--and listen to his music!!",1284681600,6,416,4.957142857142857
8402725,1,B003QZSWGU,"I should have listened to one of the reviewer's advise that this issue of DVD is a waste of money.  It is true, the songs picked are horrible and the performers all are senior citizens, they do not have the lovely voices as before, almost lost their voices. I have nothing against senior citizen, in fact, I myself is a senor citizen. The recording is pitiful, in nowadays techlonogy this sound recording push us back to the 50's. I bought this DVD and called up few of my friends to watch it on my big TV and top of the line home theater system but what a disappointment. Picture is fuzzy, even I used a blu-ray player and 1080p TV but nothing can help. Quality is totally disaster. I am so angry with it I threw it in the garbage right after we finished watching it.
I love Michel Legrand's music, I have all his sound tracks and a collector treasure ""Poor people of Paris"" album which I still keep in good condition. But this DVD should not be bought but may be rent. I hope someone will reproduce it with higher quality medium, may be blu-ray, clean the sound, the picture, then I may reconsider to purchase it. But as it is now, through it away, if you have one.
It is a waste.",1283385600,5,1182,4.253333333333333
8402726,5,B003QZSWGU,"Remember when going to the movies was still an exciting, romantic thrill? The smell of the popcorn, the roar of the air conditioning, the bottom lit red velvet curtains, and so on? For me Michel Legrand's film scores and movies represent the last of that priceless atmosphere. Yes, I do like my flat screen and Blu-rays. But the older days of going to the big movie houses, where I saw Thomas Crown Affair, Umbrellas of Cherbourg, Yentl with my date, preserve a priceless nostalgia. Legrand is a classic example of the suave, polished, creative Frenchman; the essence of sophistication and glamor. Much enjoyed the stars who came out to this gala to pay their respects! Just lay back and reminisce.",1282780800,7,698,4.825
8402727,5,B003QZSWGU,"I love Michel Legrand, and I loved this show. Michel Legrand is an unsung genius if there ever was one; despite his many Oscars and Grammys he's not exactly a household word. But if you are a film and music lover you probably appreciate his many talents; and it was great to see the panoply of (mostly older) stars who came out to pay tribute to him. Beautiful songs by a recently-out-of-hospital Andy Williams, and super performances especially by George Benson and Steve Lawrence.",1282780800,6,482,4.75
8402728,2,B003QZSWGU,"I caught this on PBS and I was amazed how terrible it was. All the name artist were so off key it was painful to listen to. Unfortunately age has caught up to them and it showed. Even Michel Legrand's attempt at singing his pieces were embarrassing. The introductions were done by Jennifer O'Neal and Jon Voight and they both were extremely amateurish. Voight was bouncing around the stage and acting very unprofessional like he was at a ho-down. It was a shame because Mr. Legrand is the composer of some of film's best loved themes and music. I've always loved the theme to ""Summer of '42"" as well as the music for ""Yentl"". But for a program that was suppose to be a tribute of 50 years of work, it was very poorly produced and performed. Watch it on PBS if you must but save your money.",1282780800,2,789,4.337837837837838
