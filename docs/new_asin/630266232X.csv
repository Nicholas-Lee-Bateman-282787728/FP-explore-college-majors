489328,5,630266232X,"Based upon the popular novel by Vera Caspary, LAURA is a masterpiece of the murder-mystery genre. As Laura Hunt, Gene Tierney is visually exquisite and her performance is very convincing (in the original novel, the title character was quite different, she being rather amoral). Dana Andrews is most effective as Mark McPherson, the detective who ""falls in love with a phantom..."" Vincent Price is unlikeably weak as Shelby whose close friend Anderson explains about their mutual admiration of each-other ""We're weak and can't seem to help it"" Lastly, as Waldo Lydecker, Clifton Webb is simply excellent. A classic film noir with the inevitable twist, LAURA is a classy, ingenious film from the heart of the 40's.",958435200,6,712,5.146551724137931

TITLE:  Laura (1944)  NR  1:22:10
  Dana Andrews, Gene Tierney, Clifton Webb, Vincent Price, Judith Anderson
  Otto Preminger (Director)

  First off, let me apologize for the incomplete RELEASE DATE above  though the cover of my DVD looks the same as the cover that is displayed above (which was supposedly released March 1, 2009  and, could quite possibly contain a higher bit-rate version of the movie than the disc that I have), I purchased my DVD sometime between 2003 and 2004 (which, again, is why I include UPC and RELEASE DATE information in ALL of my DVD and Blu-Ray reviews). On a related note: the Blu-Ray version of this movie (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/available-here/dp/B00AF4OTM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">available here</a>) was released Febrary 5, 2013, and has garnered rave reviews for its picture quality  so those seeking the best possible variant of this movie may want to purchase that version (which, as of this writing, is cheaper than the DVD, besides).

  Second, my review is of the ""Extended"" version of the movie (which can be viewed from the second ""Special Features"" menu [which is accessed by selecting ""More"" from the first ""Special Features"" menu])  the ""Extended"" version seamlessly incorporates the ""Deleted Scene"" (which is also available from that same second ""Special Features"" menu).

  Lastly, this movie is one of those rare cases where the sum of its parts (i.e.the screenplay, the casting, the direction, the acting, the music [oh, man  the MUSIC] and the sets) GREATLY exceeds the whole. I think it is an excellent whodunit, with superb acting (particularly Clifton Webb [though, EVERYONE is, at least, GOOD]) and a fine musical score  and, the fact that it has many film noir trappings (e.g.most (but, not ALL) of the noir visual style, the brooding detective, the beautiful damsel-in-distress, the collection of shady (but, colorful) characters, etc.), is a VERY welcome bonus. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

  NOTE: This movie is one of the films from Fox Home Video's exemplary ""Fox Film Noir"" series of DVDs (and, in some cases, blu-rays). Every one of the DVDs from this series that I have purchased (e.g.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Wake-Up-Screaming-1941/dp/B000EXDSBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Wake Up Screaming (1941)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fallen-Angel-1945/dp/B000CNE088/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fallen Angel (1945)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boomerang-1947/dp/B000LN6UHI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boomerang (1947)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Where-the-Sidewalk-Ends-1950/dp/B000B8384Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Where the Sidewalk Ends (1950)</a>, etc.) has featured a VERY high average bit-rate, along with an EXCELLENT picture (for a DVD) and, at a minimum, good to better-than-good sound (except for this one).

  See the other reviews for more detail and/or other opinions regarding the plot of the movie.

VIDEO:  1.33:1  B&W  480p  MPEG-2 (5.8 Mbps)

  First, the bit-rate for this movie isn't nearly as high as it is in the other movies from Fox's Film Noir series. Second, this movie doesn't look as though it has received quite the level of care and restoration as have the other movies from the series. Third, the picture quality of this disc, while still pretty good, is a DEFINITE step down in quality from the other movies from the series that I have purchased. Now for the particulars: Within the confines of the DVD format, this film exhibits good, to  on some occasions  very good, picture quality. Also, sharpness and detail (for a DVD) are usually good (with the textures and patterns of most hair-styles, clothing and furnishings being mostly discernible)  but, the movie did (though not frequently) present an image that was slightly soft. In addition, artifacts such as black specks and white dots (while not excessive) are visible far more frequently than in the other movies from the series; plus, I saw, what appeared to be a few dropped frames in some scenes. Lastly, contrast, gray scale and shadow-detail (while pretty good overall [for a DVD]) were a little ""murky"" in some scenes. While my litany of complaints may lead one to believe that this DVD looks horrible: that, most assuredly, is NOT the case  in fact, this DVD looks pretty good (it's just that I've been so spoiled by the extremely high bit-rates and fabulous images of the other movies from the series, that this movie comes up rather short by comparison).

AUDIO:  Dolby Digital 2.0 (Dual-Mono, 192 Kbps)

  The sound quality for this film's transfer fairs better than its picture quality, because there are no loud bumps nor objectionably high levels of hiss. Also, dialog is very clear and all voices are easily understood. However, dynamic range is very limited, and there is not much bottom-end nor any top-end to speak of (which makes the musical score and the Foley work all sound a little 'thin', and somewhat less than realistic). Otherwise, considering the age of the source elements and the fact that this is a monophonic, dialog-driven movie from the mid 1940s, its audio presentation has more than acceptable sound quality.

489548,4,630266232X,"I decided to purchase this film after hearing the late Robert Osborne (rest in peace) gushing about this beautiful woman, Gene Tierney.
While Laura is a fine film noir, I just wasn't captivated by it. The plot is engaging, Tierney is stunning, but I just can't put my finger on the reasoning behind this. After two viewings in a week, I have no desire to pause the film for a beverage run, nor a bathroom break. Maybe it's the actors, or lack of believability in some scenes. Maybe the director wasn't sure how to pull this off and knit it all together. Then again, maybe it's just me or maybe in six months I'll watch it again and have a different opinion.",1496016000,,657,4.39344262295082

489553,5,630266232X,"Laura (1944) is an excellent murder mystery/film noir. With the classic elements of film noir cinematography (darkness, shadows of blinds, etc.), it manages to engage the viewer from the get-go. The script is well-written, and contains all of the suspense dialogue and plot twists typical of the genre. Gene Tierney was perfectly cast in this film, as were all of the supporting actors. Laura is a classic in the film noir genre so popular in the 1940's and 1950's, and easily in my top 10 film noirs of all time. The suspense slowly builds in this film, and the pacing is just right, while the plot isn't convoluted. Give Laura your undivided attention, and you'll be rewarded. Overall, Laura is 88 minutes of entertaining film noir that gets to the point.

489599,5,630266232X,"In 1943, Vera Caspary published her novel ""Laura"" which was included as the first book in a two-volume collection of women's crime fiction from the 1940s and 1950s published in 2015 by the Library of America in an outstanding anthology edited by Sarah Weinman..&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Women-Crime-Writers-Eight-Suspense-Novels-of-the-1940s-50s-A-Library-of-America-Boxed-Set/dp/1598534513/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Women Crime Writers: Eight Suspense Novels of the 1940s & 50s: A Library of America Boxed Set</a>&nbsp;The LOA anthology gave me my first opportunity to get to know Laura and inspired me to look further,

In 1944, Otto Preminger directed this famous film based on Caspary's novel.  The film included  music composed by David Raksin, including a melody called ""Laura's theme"" played when the heroine was at the center of attention . Johnny Mercer wrote lyrics for the music after the film's success and the resulting song ""Laura"" became even more famous than Caspary's book or Preminger's film. Laura and her story in their three-fold interpretations have become part of American culture.

""Laura"" is a detective story and who-done-it, but it is also much more. It quickly becomes transformed into a romance and a character study. Laura is a beautiful, ambitious young career woman in New York City who has attained hard-won success in advertising but who is lonely and searching for love. The hard-boiled detective assigned to investigate her apparent murder falls in love with what her learns of Laura during the course of his investigation. If is difficult not to do the same. Laura's independence, beauty, and need for love all remain part of many Americans' vision of themselves.

In Preminger's movie, Gene Tierney plays the title character while Dana Andrews plays the detective, Mark McPherson. Suspects for the crime include Waldo Lydecker played by Clifton Webb, an older, crusty columnist and Shelby Carpenter, played by Vincent Price, a playboy to whom the lonely Laura has become engaged.  Laura's maid Bessie (Dorothy Adams) and Ann Treadwell (Judith Anderson) another love interest of Carpenter. also play important roles in the film.

The film follows the course of McPherson's investigation and gradually builds in intensity. In a famous moment in the film, McPherson who has taken to coming to Laura's apartment in the evenings, sits beneath her radiant portrait painted by a former suitor when the taken for dead Laura walks in.  The task of identifying the killer and the dead woman become more pressing as does the budding love between Laura and McPherson.

The film has become an American classic in its own right through its acting, music, and portrayal of Laura and McPherson. The film is a romance which shows love in a tarnished, materialistic world.  Vera Caspary, the author of the book, was politically a radical but her story captures something that spoke to many people and became an ideal.. Each interpretation of Laura, novel, film, and song captures something of her and of American art.  I was moved by Preminger's film both for itself, and in thinking about Laura in the related contexts of  Caspary's novel and the Raskin/Mercer popular song.

489730,5,630266232X,"LAURA [1944 / 2013] [Limited Edition Collector DigiBook] [Blu-ray + DVD] [French Release] The Story of a Love That Became The Most Fearful Thing That Ever Happened To A Woman! LAURA Merits a Place in the Panthon of Cinphiles!

LAURA [1944] is one of the most stylish, elegant, moody, and witty classic film noirs ever made with an ensemble cast of characters. Producer Otto Preminger ultimately ended up directing the film, after filming was begun by Rouben Mamoulian and his cinematographer Lucien Ballard. Preminger's film falls under the category of romantic, melodramatic mystery/detective film noir thriller. It might also be called a psychological study of deviant, kinky obsession, because almost everyone in the cast loves the title character Laura. One cinema lobby poster dramatically declared: ""The story of a love that became the most fearful thing that ever happened to a woman.""

LAURA is characterized by shadowy, dream-like, high-contrast black and white cinematography, and taut and smart dialogue in a quick succession of scenes. It presents the recognizably-poignant and haunting Laura signature theme music, and a decadent and morally-corrupt group of upper-class society types. Almost all of the main protagonists in the entertaining who-dun-it are treated as suspects for a down-to-earth detective.

FILM FACT: Awards and Nominations: Academy Awards: Win: Best Black-and-White Cinematography for Joseph LaShelle. Nominated: Best Director for Otto Preminger. Nominated: Best Supporting Actor for Clifton Webb. Nominated: Best Adapted Screenplay for Betty Reinhardt. Nominated: Best Black-and-White Art Direction and Interior Decoration for Lyle R. Wheeler, Leland Fuller and Thomas Little. Once principal photography was completed, Otto Preminger hired David Raksin to do the score for the film. The director wanted to use ""Sophisticated Lady"" by Duke Ellington for the main theme, but David Raksin objected to the choice. Alfred Newman, music director for 20th Century Fox, convinced Otto Preminger to give David Raksin a weekend to compose an original tune. Otto Preminger was so pleased with David Raksin's score the two collaborated on four additional films.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Otto Preminger's whodunit LAURA film classic that still grips us even today and analyses love, police-work and love, and especially with its superb halfway-point coup de cinma and is definitely one of the greatest film noir mysteries ever made, and Otto Premingers LAURA is even more celebrated today than it was when it first premiered. Offering a brilliant sound debut in films for one of its principal cast members while firmly establishing its director as a tour de force to be reckoned with in Hollywood. LAURA has allure, romance and secrets to spare and is one of those films where repeat visits are rewarded with ever deeper forays into the nature of obsession and deception.

Set in New York, LAURA, from the outside, seems prepped as a traditional locked-room mystery. Aside from the investigator, everyone carries himself or herself fabulously, a conceit that Otto Preminger peels away by the films finish. Columnist Waldo Lydecker [Clifton Webb] presents a privileged air that could spell trouble for others, or even for Columnist Waldo Lydecker. Otto Preminger fought to cast the diminutive actor in the role, for reasons that soon become obvious. Meanwhile, Vincent Prices priggish; excessively cultured Shelby Carpenter seems to shield an underlying philistinism and perversion. But Otto Preminger deals in facades, with how perception cheats us, right down to the ideal image of Laura as a portrait. The ageing aristocrat/journalist shamelessly types his newspaper column from his bathtub as he answers Detective Lt. Mark McPherson's questions about his murdered protg and close companion Laura Hunt [Gene Tierney].

Detective Lt. Mark McPherson [Dana Andrews] is told that before Laura Hunt was brutally shot she used to be a famous advertising executive who was adored by everybody she met. Every person he speaks to during the course of the investigation is emphatic about her beauty, intelligence, success, and charm. Yet each suspect remains reluctant to speak entirely candidly to Detective Lt. Mark McPherson. Laura's maid Bessie Clary [Dorothy Adams] describes her mistress as sweet-natured and hard-working but clearly resents this breach of Laura Hunt's privacy. Laura Hunt's fianc and colleague, the suave and handsome young Shelby Carpenter [Vincent Price], is courteous to the point of insincerity, and the initial concern demonstrated by Laura Hunt's wealthy aunt Ann Treadwell [Judith Anderson] is soon questioned when Detective Lt. Mark McPherson digs deeper.

As the smooth-voiced, sharp suited Detective Lt. Mark McPherson examines Laura Hunt's violent and mysterious demise he is lead into a glamorous but dangerous world of obsession, jealousy, and betrayal, where secrets are revealed and nothing is as it appears. Detective Lt. Mark McPherson gradually becomes consumed by a damaging, all-consuming infatuation for the murdered woman; he falls in love with an idea of her that is represented by a portrait of her likeness hanging above the fireplace.

Based on Vera Caspary's novel Laura, Otto Preminger's sparkling, suspenseful adaptation has more than stood the test of time. The film is well served by a sharp script and fine performances by the main cast. Gene Tierney in particular shines in the glimpses we see of Laura Hunt, and it is a sensitive and intelligent interpretation that helps prevent the character from becoming just a one-dimensional object of desire. Another highlight is the battle of wits between the flamboyant, egotistical Waldo Lydecker and the moody, introspective Detective Lt. Mark McPherson. Their conflict manifests as a clash of verbal styles, Waldo Lydecker's elaborate quips and scathing commentary contrasting humorously with Detective Lt. Mark McPherson's bluntness and wry put-downs.

Otto Preminger's 1944 LAURA marks an important transition in film history. Visually it harks back to Hollywood's Golden Era, flooding with light elaborate sets and the glamorous stars they hold, but at crucial moments a film noir vision bubbles up to artfully blemish this smooth faade. It is a classic love story, except that it hinges on forbidden fantasy and murder, and it may be eternally debated whether its double vision signals an end or a beginning.

Lovers of 1940s Hollywood and of course film noir movie-lovers in general, should savour every last drop of this rerelease, directed by Otto Preminger, made in 1944 and coming complete with an ad for US war bonds in the closing credits. Dana Andrews is the rugged Detective Lt. Mark McPherson; on account of heroic gunshot wounds in the leg, the press have dubbed him ""Detective with the silver shinbone."" Something, perhaps, to set aside Otto Preminger's 1955 film The Man With the Golden Arm. Detective Lt. Mark McPherson is investigating the gruesome murder of Laura Hunt, played by the exquisitely beautiful Gene Tierney. In flashbacks, we see how she was swept up into fashionable cafe society by her infatuated but platonic bachelor admirer, the waspish newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker [Clifton Webb] the equal, surely, of George Sanders's elegant Addison DeWitt in All About Eve. Which of Laura Hunt's wide circle of acquaintance holds the key to the mystery? And how will Detective Lt. Mark McPherson's growing obsession with Laura's memory affect his handling of the case? LAURA is still every bit as gripping to modern audiences.

Blu-ray Video Quality  20th Century Fox brings you this stunning film LAURA with its 1.33:1 original theatrical aspect ratio that is faithfully rendered in this stunning Black-and-White 1080p encoded image, that is really at its best, and the image is wonderfully sharp with a snappy greyscale which offers clean whites, rich blacks, and superb contrast, especially with the help of Cinematographer Joseph LaShelle won an Oscar for his work on film and salutes his achievement and a vast improvement over the inferior DVD release. Here we see with this stunning Blu-ray release, is a nice step up from the 2005 inferior DVD, this fine effort maintains the film's unobtrusive grain structure, presenting an image of totally exceptional clarity and beautiful lovely texture which gives it a stark contrast of the film noir style, and the grey scale variance is still very pleasing and the shadow effects are superb. Joseph LaShelle reportedly took hours to light each scene and with his painstaking efforts paid big dividends. Whether manipulating natural or artificial light, Joseph LaShelle created beautiful stunning shots that maximize contrast and depth. Blacks are solid and rich, whites are vivid but never overexposed, and the greys in between display enough variation to lend the film to a polished sheen. In short, 'LAURA' has never looked more lush and beautiful. With the previous release, here with this Blu-ray there is no grit or marks of any kind to mar the pristine source material you view, and subtle details pop out like never before. The knickknacks and grandfather clock in Columnist Waldo Lydecker's apartment are stunningly sharp, and close-ups really show off the Golden Age glamour. Noise is never an issue, even during nocturnal scenes, and no digital anomalies seamlessly are anywhere to be seen. This is a truly superior effort from 20th Century Fox, and exactly what this classic romantic mystery film noir deserves and you will be astonished by what you viewe.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  20th Century Fox brings you this brilliant film noir LAURA film with a choice of three audio experiences, that includes English: 1.0 DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish: 1.0 Dolby Digital Audio and French: 1.0 Dolby Digital Audio. The soundtrack is clear, clean sound that's been noticeably cleaned up since the 2005 inferior DVD release. Gone is the faint hiss that plagued the DVD, and the errant pops have been erased as well. The audio track beautifully showcases David Raksin's iconic hypnotic music film score, thanks to the wide dynamic scale that handles the swelling strings really well, while the marvellous fidelity features a sound mix thats likely to be the best the film noir has ever sounded on this Blu-ray disc, and the fidelity is generally strong and never allows to overpower the scintillating dialogue spoken by the actors. Subtle accents, such as footsteps, the turning of doorknobs, and the closing of a purse clasp, are crisp and pronounced. Atmospherics are generally well integrated into the sound mix, but as Laura Hunt [Gene Tierney] and Detective Lt. Mark McPherson [Dana Andrews] talk quietly in her apartment as the driving rain falls outside, and achieves the desired audio effect. The cleanliness and purity of the audio track outshines any previous releases. All in all, 'Laura' sounds great on Blu-ray, making it hard for us to believe it was recorded well over seven decades ago.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary Jeanine Basinger [Wesleyan University] and by David Raksin [Music composer for LAURA] [Theatrical Version only]: With this audio commentary from Jeanine Basinger and David Raksin, they were recorded separately, but are seamlessly edited well together. Also make sure you view the film LAURA before you listen to this audio commentary, as many clues are given away with the final outcome of the film. Here we are introduced to Jeanine Basinger who is a film historian, and was for many years the Corwin-Fuller Professor of Film Studies and Founder and Curator of The Cinema Archives at Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut, which is a leading private liberal arts college in Middletown, Connecticut, founded in 1831. Jeanine Basinger gives great praise for this famous film noir black-and-white film that was released in 1944 and gives out general information what you see while the film has started and also informs us that you are experiencing two things that made the film LAURA famous. Jeanine Basinger talks about the famous and beautiful painting of Laura Hunt [Gene Tierney] and the luscious perfectly beautiful haunting music score written by David Raksin. Now in comes David Raksin and informs us that he is desperately trying to remember specific things about the film LAURA, which unfortunately he has serious doubts about, as his memory is not what it used to be like when he was involved with the film. Jeanine Basinger comments on the famous opening words spoken by the character Columnist Waldo Lydecker [Clifton Webb], which starts as I shall never forget the weekend Laura died . . . and we are also informed that Clifton Webb was making his film debut in a sound film and also makes comments about the famous clock that will be relevant towards the main plot at the end of the film. David Raksin talks about Dana Andrews with his first appearance in the film and mentions that Dana Andrews is one of his favourite leading male actor. We are informed that Clifton Webb was originally a truly brilliant famous Broadway singer/dancer, which is suspected that a majority of people knew about this information, and the fact that no one has ever witnessed seeing this actor perform his singing/dancing prowess in any other film. Jeanine Basinger feels that the actor Dana Andrews is the most underrated leading male actor of the 1940s and 1950s and feels that people should look Dana Andrewss eyes in this film that has haunting and enigmatic quality, as well as intense and offhand attitude in the film and gives the persona of something of a very mysterious quality. When we first see the actress Judith Anderson, we are reminded that this actress played the main lead in the famous Alfred Hitchcock film REBECCA as the very frightening character of Mrs. Danvers and was awarded the Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1960 Queen's New Year's Honours List for her services to the performing arts. David Raksin mentions a lot about his composed theme music and mentions that throughout the whole of the film only actually lasts for 35 minutes in total and decided to do this deliberately. Judith Anderson also informs us of a very interesting and unknown fact about the Laura Hunt portrait, which is in fact a photograph done over with oil paint and now resides in the Gene Tierney Archives at the Cinema in the Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut. We are also informed some other facts about the oil painting that was commissioned, but when Otto Preminger viewed it was not at all happy with its result, and did not feel it reflected the mysterious quality of the film, but instead sent Gene Tierney to the famous 20th Century Fox in-house photographer. We also find out that when we see Laura Hunt at the party, Otto Preminger wanted to use the song Summertime from the film Porgy & Bess, especially for the theme music, but then decided he wanted to use Sophisticated lady by Duke Ellington, but thankfully was all turned down and thankfully David Raksin was called in to produce the now famous theme music for the film LAURA and David Raksin informs us that the composed film score and has been developed into more than 400 known recordings. Some of the best-known versions are by Woody Herman, Dave Brubeck, Johnny Johnston, Emil Newman, and David Rose. Then eventually lyrics were written by Johnny Mercer after the film had made the tune popular and eventually the song became a jazz standard that has been performed by Billy Eckstine, Charlie Parker, J. J. Johnson, Carly Simon, Frank Sinatra and Julie London (included on her 1955 debut album Julie Is Her Name, Vol. 1). The first 10 notes of the song are sometimes ""quoted"" during jazz solos, especially since Dizzy Gillespie did it during his ""Perdido"" solo at the famous Massey Hall concert in 1953.  According to Johnny Mercer, he had not yet seen the movie when he wrote the lyrics, but was aware that it was a romantic, somewhat haunting story. We are also informed that originally the film music score was offered to Alfred Newman, but turned it down, then Composer Bernard Herrmann was approached, who also turned the job down and as they say the rest is now history. As we come to the end of this particular audio commentary, Jeanine Basinger says, and goodbye my audience, thank you very much for watching the movie with me, thank you. Strangely, David Raksin never bids us farewell to us the audience.

Audio Commentary By Rudy Behlmer [Film Historian] [Theatrical Version only]: With this audio commentary from Film Historian Rudy Behlmer, make sure you view the film LAURA before you listen to this audio commentary, as many clues are given away with the final outcome of the film. Here we are introduced to Rudy Behlmer, where he informs us, accompanying the recognised 20th Century Fox logo, is the equally recognisable orchestral fanfare that was composed by Alfred Newman in 1933 for 20th Century Pictures, and two years before the merger with Fox Films and then we are informed that the Fox Orchestra is playing the Laura theme music that was composed by David Ranksin. Rudy Behlmer also informs us that for the next hour and a half [well just slightly short of that time] and here Rudy Behlmer delves into the evolution and mythology of the stylish film LAURA, from its inception, through to the play, the novel, the film and beyond, and most of the information you hear is based on various drafts of the script story conference notes, correspondence, autobiographical books and several interviews that Rudy Behlmer was fortunate to be involved with way back in the late 1970s, especially with people who were very much involved with the film LAURA, both in front of and behind the camera and also in addition to the author and novelist Vera Caspary who was heavenly involved with the direction the film should proceed. But at this point Rudy Behlmer was us viewers that before he can proceed with this audio commentary, warns people who have not viewed the film LAURA, to do so, because Rudy gives out lots of clues to the final ending of the film, which he feels it will spoil peoples enjoyment of the film, especially in finding out who the murdered was, because the film LAURA is partly a tour de force mystery ensemble genre film and should stay that way for people listening to this audio commentary. In 1939 novelist, playwright and screenwriter Vera Caspary had been struggling with an idea about a story of a detective who falls in love with a presumably dead idealised woman, whose life he is investigating, but Vera Caspary didn't know how to solve the mystery, until Vera read an article in a newspaper about a young woman whose face was destroyed by an explosion, and now the mystery has been solved and Vera Caspary was able to finish her novel, and the rest of the story is what you see in the film. With the character Waldo Lydecker, who was based on a real person in the name of Alexander Woollcott who was an American critic and commentator for The New Yorker magazine and a member of the Algonquin Round Table, who occasionally di some acting who also achieved a strong influence of a literature taste at the beginning of the 1920s, thanks to his strong willed iconoclastic and witty observations, that were revealed when Vera Caspary read some of Alexander Woollcotts novels. Unfortunately most of the Hollywood Studios turned down Vera Casparys screenplay, but her Agent gave her screenplay to a Broadway producer and Director who really liked her synopsis and wanted to not only produce the play, but to collaborate with Vera Caspary, who felt very flattered by this mysterious person, who had a lot of Broadway influence and style, which surprisingly turned out to be none other than Otto Preminger himself, now that is what I call fate. When unfortunately a Broadway try out was turned down, Vera Caspary wanted it to be turned into a film and two film studios were interested, one was M-G-M and the other one was 20th Century Fox, and because Otto Preminger was under contract to 20th Century Fox, felt that LAURA would be a good vehicle for a murder mystery genre film and in 1943 20th Century Fox brought the rights for the film for $30,000, but Vera Caspri was allowed to retain the dramatic play rights. After several drafts of the screenplay Darryl F. Zanuck gave the go ahead to allow the film to be shot, but because of a falling out with Otto Preminger was still bared from directing the film LAURA, so they asked Lewis Milestone, but decided to turn the job down, then the director John Brum was asked, but he also turned the job down, also Walter Lang was also offered the job, who was really only known for directing Musicals, who also turned the offer to direct down, after a fruitful round of contacting other directors, but all were not interested in the job, so reluctantly Darryl F. Zanuck gave the job the Otto Preminger out of desperation. Loads of female actresses were asked to appear in the film, but we learn Jennifer Jones was originally slated for the title role, but eventually Gene Tierney was chosen, but was not happy to be the second choice. Otto Preminger happen to go and see Clifton Webb in the play Blithe Spirit and was very impressed by his performance, and offered him the script and of course was keen to be in the film, as Otto Preminger thought he would be perfect as the character of Waldo Lydecker. Through a twist of fate, Dana Andrews was also given the script of LAURA and as they say, the stars shone down on Dana Andrews and of course the film made him a box office sensation, and Dana Andrews asked Hedda Hopper to give a write up in her column hinting he had secured the part in the film, that eventually Darryl F. Zanuck approved his role in the film after seeing him in a test screening. When the public viewed the film LAURA and heard its beautiful film music score by David Raksin that was among the finest productions to come from the 20th Century Fox studios during that decade people were clamouring to know where they could purchase the sheet music and especially the 78 rpm record, and after the film's 1944 release, the main title theme, which is heard several times during the film, was given a fresh set of Johnny Mercer lyrics and became a major song hit in the spring of 1945. Johnnie Johnston's was one of four recorded versions to reach the national Billboard top-ten singles sales chart and Woody Herman, Dick Haymes and Freddy Martin were the others. And so ends another fascinating audio commentary that is well worth a listen.

Special Feature: Biography Gene Tierney: A Shattered Portrait [1999] [480i] [1.33:1] [44:09] This absorbing and beautifully produced profile of the star of the film 'LAURA,' which originally aired on television as an instalment in the popular Biography TV series, uses a wealth of film clips, home movies, newsreel footage, and rare photos to illustrate Gene Tierney's exciting yet incredibly troubled life. Narrator Peter Graves calls the actress ""the embodiment of unattainable beauty, the image of perfection,"" yet a series of tragedies and failed romances caused her to become so mentally unbalanced she was forced to leave the screen in the mid-1950s and enter a sanatorium, where she would undergo a series of wrenching electroshock treatments. The TV programme details her volatile marriage to designer Oleg Cassini, who terms her ""the unluckiest lucky girl in the world,"" and relationships with such legendary figures as Howard Hughes, a young John F. Kennedy, and Prince Aly Khan. In addition, actor Richard Widmark, composer David Raksin, Gene Tierney's sister Pat Byrne, and daughter Christina Cassini offer vital insights into Gene Tierney's character and actions.

Special Feature: Biography Vincent Price: The Versatile Villain [1997] [480i] [1.33:1] [44:03] Compared to Gene Tierney, Vincent Price led a sedate and traditional life, but The Versatile Villain, another Biography profile TV Series, examines it with style. Narrated by Richard Kiley calls Vincent Price ""a modern Renaissance man,"" who complemented his passion for drama with an equally avid interest in art. We learn that Vincent Price, at the tender age of 12 years of age purchased an original Rembrandt etching, and would later lend his name to a line of affordable fine art marketed by Sears. Reminiscences and testimonials from Jane Russell, Roddy McDowell, Dennis Hopper, director Roger Corman, and Vincent Price's daughter Victoria enhance the documentary, which charts Vincent Price's rise from a member of Orson Welles' fledgling Mercury Theater Company to dashing Hollywood character actor to star in some of the campiest and most gruesome horror films of the 1950s and 1960s. The film also chronicles Vincent Price's memorable appearances on the Batman Television show as Egghead and appearing in the Michael Jackson's Thriller video.

Special Feature: The Obsession [2005] [480i] [1.33:1] [12:36] Here we have some historians and the filmmaker Carl Franklin express their feelings about the film LAURA and the fascinating look into the characters of the film. This video essay on the film featuring analysis from film historians James Ursini, Alain Silver, and Dr. Drew Casper, film director Carl Franklin, and music historian John Morgan. Though obviously produced for the 2005 inferior DVD, this slick, interesting piece was not included on the DVD, so it's a pleasure to see it here at long last.

Special Feature: Deleted Scene [1944] [1080p] [1.33:1] [2:36] The deleted scene which is included in the extended edition of the film is also offered as a bonus feature. It can be viewed with or without Rudy Behlmer's commentary. Apparently, the 20th Century Fox executives believed the public would resent a woman who pursued such frivolity during wartime, and severely truncated the sequence.

Theatrical Trailer [1944] [480i] [1.33:1] [3:00] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film LAURA. The films trailer presented here is in an absolutely atrocious condition, makes us appreciate all the more the fine restoration of ' LAURA' on this Blu-ray.

Special Feature: EXTENDED VERSION: When you click on the longer version of the film, you get a notice appear informing that you have selected the EXTENDED VERSION of LAURA which contains a montage dealing with remaking Laura into a society woman. According to Film Historian Rudy Behlmer, the scene was cut because of the war atmosphere in America. The sequence was judged as too off-putting in its decadence.

PLEASE NOTE: On the back of the Limited Edition Collector DigiBook it informs you that the Theatrical Version is 1 Hour and 27 Minutes and the Extended Version is 1 Hour and 37 Minutes. Well this information is wrong and so for the exact running times please check out the above general information at the top of this review for the exact times of the different versions of the film LAURA.

BONUS: Beautiful designed printed 11 page booklet and includes lots of interesting information. There are some errors on the back cover: Rudy Behlmer is a Film Historian and not a Historian. Sadly all what you read is in French.

Finally, one of the best supreme film noir mysteries of the 1940s and LAURA is must-see viewing for all film buffs interested in great films of this high quality. Anyone who loves a good mystery film should not hesitate to take 'LAURA' home, and this Golden Age of Classic film genre earns a definite high praise and a hearty must have Blu-ray disc for your collection. Very Highly Recommended!

489792,5,630266232X,"Otto Preminger's classic film noir paints such a cynical portrait of mid-Forties New York that it's difficult to identify any redemptive points.

Living in a bubble-like world of parties, social rituals and other high-society occasions, the protagonists have little or no understanding either of themselves or their fellow human-beings. The tone is set in the initial encounter between Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), and Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) that takes place in New York's Algonquin Hotel, the site of the famed Round Table that flourished two decades prior to the film's release. The allusion is a suggestive one: Waldo displays all the cutting wit, narcissism and sheer cruelty associated with his illustrious contemporary Alexander Wollcott (who had passed away a year before the film's release). Both men reveled in their celebrity and made extensive use of it to manipulate others.

Walso treats Laura as a Pygmalion-like figure to be molded according to his whims. However things start to get rough when Laura displays a penchant for branching out on her own, most notably by planning to marry feckless socialite Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price). The rivalry produced thereby provides the mainspring of the story. Add to that a vicious cameo by Judith Anderson as Ann Treadwell, Laura's supposed ""confidante"" who would drop her like a stone if necessary, and we have the ingredients for a murder mystery that twists and turns towards its unexpected denouement.

What perhaps renders this film so memorable is its use of symbolism. Waldo has a penchant for writing his articles in the bath; totally unfazed about his nakedness, he seems completely confident in himself. In public, however, he makes sure that every item of clothing is in place; the tie matters as much as anything else. Through such rituals Preminger suggests the importance of outward show; what matters is not what people think, but what they appear to think. All of the four protagonists - including Laura - resemble empty vessels, devoid of moral scruples and totally committed to maintaining their sophisticated facade in high society. If one of them should be accused of the murder, it doesn't really matter, as they would simply hire the best attorney to exonerate them.

Yet Preminger simultaneously suggests that their days are numbered, through the repeated use of ticking clocks on the soundtrack. A clock plays an important part in the denouement; but on other occasions we hear it as an accompaniment to the dialogue, suggesting some kind of impending doom. However badly the characters might behave, they have to face the day of reckoning at the end, and none of them are prepared to acknowledge this.

As the eponymous heroine, Tierney might be considered an innocent victim of male machination, but as the action unfolds, we see that she is as manipulative as anyone else. She ends up falling in love with investigating officer Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews), but we have little faith in the relationship's future. She is as willing to sacrifice her loved ones as anyone else.

LAURA is a highly uncomfortable film in spite of its memorable theme (by David Raksin). We feel as if we have been unwillingly thrust into a nest of vipers and are mighty relieved to escape.",1475625600,2,3260,5.08411214953271

She said that it was a suspensful film with wonderful twists and turns in it which is probably why I got it for her, since I too like those kinds of stories.  If I had to describe it I would have to say that it is a love story wrapped in a mystery of murder.  Gene Tierney, probably one of the most beautiful actresses of all time, is the victim of a horrible murder and the dashing Dana Andrews is the cop trying to solve her murder and in trying to do so he falls in love with her just from the portrait above Miss Tierney's mantle in her apartment.  It also stars Clifton Webb the jealous friend who also loves Miss Tierney's character as well as an early apperance of Vincent Price, before the macabre performances, as her boyfriend.  It is a one of a kind mystery thriller and if you love classic films I would definately reccomend this one!

490049,5,630266232X,"For a film buff, this is a classic which is on the 'must be seen' list. For members of the younger audience, it still a remarkably compact film (compared to those made today) with some fine acting and a dependence on words rather than slam bang action. To those of us who saw it when it was on its original run, it holds up remarkably well. Two foci of attention are still worth the price of admission, as the saying goes. Clifton Webb in an early outing of his  patented masterfully verbal cynicism and Gene Tierney, beautiful, sensitive, yet somehow remote. Dana Andrews, as the detective who falls love with the image of a dead woman, shows why he became, for a few years, a top male star, before alcoholism damaged his ability to stay  at the top but not a long career as an able feature player in major films and star of minor ones (as well as a  reliable television player when that medium  came along later in the decade. Judith Anderson, a great star on stage, does well in a supporting role as does Vincent Price as the heroine's weak willed fiance. (Later in his career, I saw him on stage in Charles Laughton's Shavian production when Laughton replaced himself with Price in the Don Juan in Hell production which had involved four masters in the art of acting, Agnes Moorehead, Cedric Hardwicke, Charles Boyer, and Laughton, himself. Seeing it two evenings in a row made an indelible impression....with Price holding his own as the four sat on stools throughout the  play, doing nothing but shifting their bodies slightly, and 'acting' only with their voices as they 'read', their scripts....obviously a gesture since every word and move was part of the staging).
For anyone for whom violent action, overt sexuality and tough language is not a prerequisite for enjoyment of a mystery, this should provide an
entertaining hour and a half (nearly).",1457049600,12,1857,4.701538461538462

490155,3,630266232X,"This is not so much a movie, but a series of classic film noir scenes strung together with mixed success.  A young woman--a paragon of intelligence, hard work, and goodness--is murdered.  The two main suspects are a handsome boyfriend and a withered old man/mentor who is an acid-tongue dandy.  A handsome, virile, wise-cracking detective investigates and . . . .
  Almost every individual scene is  worth remembering for its dialogue and atmosphere.  The supporting characters are played by accomplished actors and actresses.  Gene Tierney as the murdered woman is only okay, but she can't live up to the role--no one could.  Its mishmash of idiocy about love & men and perfection in everything else is impossible to play, at least it seems so for me.
  The bigger problem is that, while a coherent narrative is not necessary for a great film noir, this movie piles one absurdity on top of another to meet the conventions of the genre.  Furthermore, there are no surprises in this movie--perhaps not at the time but certainly not now after so many movies have used similar devices.
  Nonetheless, if you like film noir, then you would be doing yourself a disfavor not to see this movie.  It has great style, always critical to a successful film noir. I also had the distinct feeling that Preminger was playing with the censors--which he was know to do--with several characters and felt that if he had been able to make the movie he wanted, it would have been better.  But this may be only because I admire  almost everything Preminger does.

490175,5,630266232X,"FABULOUS! This 1944 classic is very deservedly considered a master piece of cinema. It didn't age one bit and it still shines gloriously today. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

New York City police detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) investigates the murder of beautiful and highly successful advertising executive, Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney), killed by a shotgun blast to the face, just inside the doorway of her apartment, before the start of the film. She died just before marrying a handsome young man of bad reputation, Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price). McPherson first interviews charismatic newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), an aging dandy, who was Laura's mentor - and with this the film really begins.

There are so many treasures in this film that it is hard to decide where to begin. Gene Tierney is of course the main attraction of this film. She was 24 at this time and also a young mother (she gave birth to her first child one year before) and the conjunction of age and this first maternity made her into a luminous appearance. Clifton Webb is simply PERFECT in a role which shows - amongst others - that there is no fool like an old fool. Vincent Price is also great as the hunky but shady ladies man. Finally, Dana Andrews portrays very well a man who slowly but surely falls in love with a very, very dead woman...

Passion, jealousy, love, hatred, longing for the impossible, shockers and surprises, wit and humour, cynicism and madness - all is here, in the dominating shadow of Laura, a young, amazingly beautiful woman who took the world by storm and had it all. For a moment...

I saw this film three times, at various stages of my life and every time I liked it more. This is indeed a great, great classic, a MUST for all amateurs of good cinema. I will absolutely keep my DVD for another viewing. ENJOY!",1448409600,,1876,4.72782874617737

490207,5,630266232X,"Described as a ""film noir,"" Laura is indeed dark with adult themes such as lust, jealousy, murder, and revenge. Gene Tierney plays the beautiful and mysterious Laura with whom all the male characters are in love. Clifton Webb plays Laura's older mentor, Waldo Lydecker, who is responsible for Laura's successful career, and Laura owes him much. Although he eliminates a suitor of Laura's by using his newspaper column to discredit him, Laura soon finds another, Shelby Carpenter, a mealy mouthed weakling to whom she becomes engaged, played by Vincent Price. Enter hard boiled Detective Mark McPherson, Dana Andrews, who is investigating a murder. I hesitate to spoil the plot line, as it is so enjoyable to watch the twists and turns, but I will say that Detective Mark falls for Laura, too, but before he has ever met her! The New York apartment scenes are interesting glimpses into how the other half lived in Manhattan in the 1940's. The theme, the haunting song, Laura, was written for the movie by David Raskin and is heard throughout the film. Watching these pros perform in this dark themed film is a real treat, all these decades after it was released in 1944.",1446508800,,1169,4.85

Great plot and acting overall.  I am not a Vincent Price fan, but I think this part was made for him.  So different than what you are used to with him. Judith Anderson in a role that is so different than the one she played in another favorite of mine, REBECCA, is among the cast as is Clifton Webb in a role that I think is a stand out for him.  Oh, and did I mention Dana Andrews?  Stand out also.  As far as film noir, to me this is at the top of my list and one that I like to go back to and watch again.
The only sketchy things is how the detective finds the weapon.  Without giving anything away, let's just say that to me it was more than pure dumb luck, it was a bit of a stretch.  Only fault I can find, however, and it does not take away from the remarkable performance of the cast.  Grab a hot chocolate, or some pop corn, and enjoy.",1446076800,2,1055,3.8425925925925926

This film immediately draws you into the intriguing life of Laura (Gene Tierney).

She is enticed and seduced by the men who meet and fall in love with her.  Each man (Clifton Web, Vincent Price) portraying their own unique manipulating character traits or lack of, to possess her. It ultimately leads to murder.  Will the Homicide Detective ( Dana Andrews) investigating the case be blinded by his hidden love for Laura to uncover the ""unpredictable""  truth of who murdered who?

490271,5,630266232X,"This is a lovely film in so many ways. It is playfully noir-ish (it tilts a little too much toward Nick-and-Nora to ever achieve true ""Double Indemnity"" darkness, however); it shares an insider perspective on New York celebrity with ""The Sweet Smell of Success"" (and, on stage, Budd Shulberg's ""What Makes Sammy Run?""); and it is a perfect collaboration between three of my favorite mid-20th century artists: Gene Tierney, Dana Andrews, and Otto Preminger.

It's arguable that these three are middling, or middle-brow, or marginal practitioners. But I return yearly to ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" (Andrews), ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" (Tierney), and ""In Harm's Way"" (Preminger). I just can't get enough, respectively,  of Dana Andrews's angst, anxiety, and anguish post-WWII; of Gene Tierney's palpably sexual (and Victorian) yearnings for a drowned sea captain; and of Preminger's crazy-ass take on the Second World War -- literally from Pearl Harbor to Hiroshima.

But ""Laura""? Wait for Dana Andrews's surreptitious smiles. Therein lie the payoffs.",1444521600,,1051,5.357575757575757
490312,5,630266232X,"Wonderful love story/mystery, perfectly acted.  I have seen it over the years a number of times and it never fails to be completely absorbing, even though I know how it ends.  Part of the magic is sensing the presence of Laura -- through the theme song, the portrait, and the reminiscences of a besotted older lover -- for a good portion of the movie before she makes an appearance.  This presence enables us to believe that Dana Andrews, the hard-boiled detective, would also be pulled into an infatuation with someone he had never met and had no hope of meeting.  Laura herself is complex: beautiful, spirited, successful in a career but never edgy or shrill [as career women were often drawn in that era].  Emotionally, you can grasp the uncertainty her relationship with Clifton Webb has cost her, without finding her weak or silly.  She is a victim but not in the least pathetic.  Her stunning appearance combines with a sweetness of character that is somewhat rare to see on the screen -- a notable lack of vanity for someone who out-glams just about every other woman in her vicinity.",1444435200,,1091,4.7105263157894735

I believe Otto Preminger was at his finest as the director and who could believe the haunting melody scored by David Raskin which has become one of film noir's finest all-time melodies that lead the audience into the feeling of just how an investigating detective Dana Andrews could fall in love with a portrait of Laura, played by Gene Tierney.

When all this is wrapped around one of the best collection of possible suspected killers... mainly in Clifton Web and Vincent Price...well it just doesn't get any better. My only wish is that every lover of great films in today's younger generation would see how some of the older black and white films out shine what is passed on today as modern film making. Ha, The Maltese Falcon, Casablanca, Laura, Sunset Boulevard and Double Indemnity just to name 5 should be at the top of everyone's repeated viewing list.

490438,5,630266232X,"The movie ""Laura"" and the song ""Laura"" are wonderful parts of Americana.  The actors and actresses who contributed so much to tell this story were the best. The very best.

Certainly both resilience and poetic temperament are needed to act a story in a director's medieum like this. Certainly acting for many different directors in many films can take its toll.  It is a sad thing that exhaustion from so much work before the cameras was treated with shock treatments, a method of choice at the time.

  Where there is little understanding, violent means are used.

  In one of her rare interviews (Mike Douglas was the interviewer) Miss Tierney said the script of Laura was beautifully written, and that Clifton Webb (as Waldo  Lydecker) read his lines so beautifully. Everybody in the movie read beautifully, in my opinion.  I would suggest this movie is a treasure that cost a lot to make.

  I would also hope that someone will be able to figure out a better way than shock treatments.

If you read Miss Tierney's biography, you will know why I bring this up. I think it was one of her ""causes"" about which she spoke.

I would also just raise a question, if the studio felt Miss Tierney needed ""coaching"" in the dramatic arts, why Barbara Stanwyck, very active at the time in helping fledgling actors, was not asked to help.
 Instead, for some reason ""brainwashing"" imitation of others via viewing film was used.  Not the best choice.

 We need a better way  to help someone with exhaustion, total exhaustion, after so many poetic efforts in so many (36?) fine films.

It cost to make the film Laura. It is a masterpiece.",1436227200,,1625,4.667844522968198

With the assistance of an older man who is a successful newspaper columnist, Laura makes a niche for herself in her field, but at the height of her career is brutally murdered--or so it appears. Dana Andrews offers the perfect contrast to Laura's glamour and refinement as the vital young detective assigned to the case who cannot help falling in love with her while investigating her murder. Clifton Webb plays the established, cynical columnist whose age and sophistication draw him to the youth, energy and sincerity of Laura. He carries the film, ultimately, with his urbane wit and upbeat one liners, both of which prevent the drama from becoming sentimental.

490736,2,630266232X,"I had read so much about this movie and was happy to finally get a chance to view it recently. I thought it was disappointing for a number of reasons.

The story lacks credibility right from the start.

SPOILER ALERT!

As my husband and I noted, no apartment would look that way, after a person had been murdered in such a gruesome way. It was supposedly a crime scene still being investigated, but it was pristine clean. No worries about people coming and going either, taking things out of drawers,  smudging prints, etc..

Then you have the detective on the case sitting around drinking in this apartment day after day with no one to answer to or other cases to work on... while taking the occasional glance at the portrait of a woman he is supposedly in love with, in spite of her not even being alive (or so it seems at that point).

When Laura does show up alive and well, there is the conversation about her whereabouts. Why was this not investigated thoroughly before that point? If she was just out of town, would someone not have seen her, somewhere along the way? Again, this did not ring true.

I also thought Dana Andrews lacked appeal in this role. He seemed one dimensional and not emotional enough for the part he was portraying as a love-struck albeit hard-boiled gumshoe.

I enjoyed ""Whirlpool"" much more than this and thought that Gene Tierney had a better part to play in that film and for the most part, a lot more believable plot throughout. Laura, in spite of rave reviews, did not appeal to me, nearly as much, given all the unlikely twists in this story.",1423094400,,1579,4.515789473684211

The music is excellent and the painting over the mantle of Tierney, often shown, is more than memorable.  The twist comes early in the movie but the pace does not let up.  The police grilling scene from that era shows how much has changed.  Elegance predominates throughout making today's viewer wonder if life today has the same extent of style at its very best.

490820,5,630266232X,"Laura is one of the must-see films of the 40's, a noirish mystery set in the lavish world of New York caf society that made careers for its director, most of its actors and the composer of the score whose theme became one of the biggest love songs of its era. The odd thing is that the film was not expected to be very much and the studio, Twentieth Century Fox, threw a bunch of their minor people together on the project almost as if it were a B-picture. But that's the way magic works; always when you least expect it.

The author, Vera Caspary originally sought to make a stage play from her 1942 novel, but no producer would back it.  At Fox, Daryl Zanuck only optioned the book after his least favorite director, Otto Preminger, pushed him into it by promising it would be made inexpensively. Zanuck so hated Preminger over the failure of the Zanuck-adapted ""Kidnapped"" in 1938 that the director was only hired back by the studio when Zanuck was away in the Army. And to spite Preminger, who was very enthusiastic about Laura's film potential, he refused to let him direct it and instead, only produce it with Rouben Mamoulian as the film's director.

After great script and casting difficulties with Mamoulian, Preminger was finally given the director's chair and kept the film within its budget partly by using actors that Fox didn't know what to do with. The beautiful Gene Tierney was being groomed as a lead actress but so far hadn't clicked in movies like Tobacco Road and Belle Starr. Dana Andrews had been appearing in a number of Fox Westerns and action pictures but also to little effect. The young Vincent Price had not yet established himself and was not typical romantic material and Judith Anderson was equally hard to cast despite her acclaimed sinister performance in Rebecca. Finally there was Clifton Webb, a Broadway actor and dancer who Preminger had to force Zanuck to hire for the role despite Zanuck's disapproval of Webb's overtly gay character. The music, an important mood creating element in most mysteries, was given to David Raksin, who had never composed for a film before.  Here seemed to be a recipe for disaster, or at least a minor and forgettable misfire.

Instead they created one of the biggest hits and masterful suspense films of the decade, and all involved went on to long and fruitful careers well into the 50's and beyond. Clifton Webb received an Academy Award nomination for his remarkable portrayal of the caustically witty Waldo Lydecker, and Gene Tierney became one of the most glamorous and famous actresses of her day. Preminger, Andrews and Price all enjoyed very long careers. And Zanuck made a ton of money from it despite the fact that he almost seemed to want it to fail.

To say any more about the film itself would give too much away. The dialogue is memorable, the black and white sets are beautiful and opulent and the cast works wonders together. There is some disagreement over whether it is a true film-noir, but that's more like some kind of obscure theological argument that misses the point that this is a remarkable film regardless of what you call it. It's a must for any lover of Forties films, mysteries and great ensemble acting.",1418515200,9,3205,4.714285714285714

Out of all the movies that get made in this industry each year over the decades, there are only a few that just come out with everything working perfectly in each. LAURA was one of them.

Every detail of this film was handled well...from the rye and initially emotionally introverted police detective played by Dana Andrews, to the witty, snobbish, control freak critic played by Cliffton Webb, to Gene Tierney's graceful and strong-willed Laura Hunt. And honorable mention to Vincent Price's work as the weaseling spoiled playboy.

The banter in this film was crisp, the suspense was well paced out, and the camera work, musical score, and art direction were all fitting for the script.  It is rare that I can find a movie where I can say to myself that I wouldn't change a thing about it, but LAURA was one of those films.",1417305600,2,925,4.554216867469879

If you love classic mysteries as much as I do, then this is a must-have item for your collection. One wonders what it would have been like without that wonderful theme music which, although never sung in the picture, creates so much of the atmosphere, permeating every scene to the point when you actually think you can smell the subtle perfume that Laura must have worn.

Performances by Clifton Webb as a columnist and a not-yet-typecast Vincent Price as a kept man stand out. As does the beauty of Gene Tierney as Laura.

The story is full of surprises and always seems to be over too soon.
The name Otto Preminger , Producer/Director says it but not before this film.

And the cast performs the story very well. Clifton Webb is iconic - but again, not before this film.
 And Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney enjoyed a career boost as well from their work in this production.

For many reasons this film was important to film history and evolution - Google any of the names above for fascinating behind the scenes stories .

It entertains and that's what it's about.  As a young girl, the ""Mystery Beauty"" story fascinated me and added excitement and romance to every  moment.

It is still a fine film and a modern colorized digitally optimized version should be made , but only to add to the purist Black and White original for its importance.

When a police detective falls in love with a portrait of the fabulous Gene Tierney, one can only think ""Who wouldn't?"" and then wonder, where can this story go from here? You'll see. The interesting thing about Laura is that it's a film you can enjoy rewatching even when you know what's going to happen! It's that entertaining. The atmosphere draws you in; you want to live with these characters. Gene Tierney has never been more beautiful, Dana Andrews has never had a role that fit him better, and Clifton Webb was born to play acerbic Waldo Lydecker.

If I were to compile a top ten list of my favorite films, Laura would be on that list.  The film is a graphic reason why black and white films are so good.  The sets, the costumes and the acting are all so well done, the film, to me, ranks up there with Casablanca and Citizen Kane.
A fabulous film

491644,5,630266232X,"A very stylish film noir which takes a big risk by having the ""reveal"" occur in the middle of the picture. The lovely and talented Laura (Gene Tierney) has been the victim of a shotgun blast to the face -- or has she? But who wanted her dead? Laura is very successful, an art director with a large circle of friends, and without an enemy in the world. It's up to the proverbially hard-boiled, cynical detective, Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) to solve the case, and an odd assortment of characters presents itself for him to rule in or rule out.

Waldo Lydecker, (Clifton Webb) a famed influential newspaper columnist, is the potential suspect McPherson can't shake. In a lengthy flashback (which had been cut in half for years before being restored in 1990) Waldo describes to McPherson his taking Laura under his wing, developing her into a socialite and grooming her for success in business. I have never seen this relationship as a romance. Waldo is a Svengali. He isn't in love with her; he's obsessed with her. Waldo uses his column to mock and insult Laura's potential suitors. She defers to his judgment, and moves on to the next unsuitable man, following this unhealthy pattern because she feels she owes Waldo everything. Laura is the only character in the movie about whom Waldo expresses no cynicism. He writes ""with a goose quill dipped in venom,"" and speaks that way too, of everybody except Laura. Webb was robbed of an Oscar for this performance. He was handed a beautifully written part, and he dove into it with obvious relish. Any writer would have been thrilled to see a character realized in this way. Director Otto Preminger probably had to cough into his handkerchief at some of Waldo's perfectly delivered barbs.

Vincent Price really did do more that horror movies; he plays Shelby, one of Laura's unworthy suitors here. Judith Anderson had many more sides to her than Mrs. Danvers, the spooky housekeeper in ""Rebecca."" She plays Laura's aunt, Ann Treadwell, a society wannabe whose looks are fading, social connections dwindling, and who is not above luring Shelby away from Laura. It's the byplay between all the characters, and the way that Waldo moves them around like chess pieces that make ""Laura"" so entertaining.

""When you were unattainable, that's when he wanted you most,"" Waldo tells Laura about McPherson. That observation applies more to Waldo's feelings for Laura; it sums up his obsession with her, although he wouldn't describe it that way. For his part, Det. McPherson is caught up in Laura's spell for a time when the investigation is at a standstill. Dead or alive, Laura sprinkles fairy dust over everyone she meets.

David Raksin's famous, haunting theme sets the mood and stays with you. Joseph LeShelle's cinematography won the movie's only Oscar. He played with shades of gray in a pleasing way; there aren't any of the stark black and white compositions we're used to seeing in film noir.

I am a firm believer that opinions are not right or wrong, and that everyone is entitled to their feelings about any subject. Opinions carry more weight, however, whether positive or negative, when they are informed opinions. Informed and considered opinions can be supported and substantiated. A dismissive phrase or two, e.g.; (""Laura"" is) ""just horrible;"" ""trite, overacted trash. Avoid at all costs,"" is, quite frankly, meaningless. It's one pan out of over 450 positive reviews. The movie's fans and admirers can't all be idiots. Movies with a 100% consensus of favorable ratings are rare, but with ""Laura"" this has been happening for 70 years. As long as new audiences discover it and new critics, whose opinions are valuable enough that they are paid for them, recognize the numerous rewards ""Laura"" offers, I can't see that needle moving,",1399680000,,3786,4.927899686520377

In my opinion, this is when movies were worth watching; because of the storyline and the actors were really talented. Gene Tierney, Dana Andrews and Clifton Webb certainly played their roles.  This movie even though from the 40's is not dated, nor boring.  It's very entertaining and keeps you watching the screen, so that you don't miss anything.  It's a murder mystery that didn't need all the blood and gore that is shown in today's world.  It just shows you don't have to be overly explicit to have a great movie.  Again, a great movie.

Clifton Webb exudes elegant menace, while Dana Andrews does an excellent tough guy getting in way above his head.  Vincent Price's love sponge rendition is on point and an example of the wasted talent in his later career of horror pastiches.

491782,4,630266232X,"There is really nothing to recommend about this movie based on the screenplay alone.  Some of the writing was witty, the photography beautiful, and Otto Preminger's direction superb, but it's really an average movie, boring in too many places, and not too believable in the places where it was interesting.  So why did I give it four stars instead of three?  Had it been in less capable hands, it would have been much worse, even less than average.  The casting was perfect, and the acting capable and interesting.  More than that, it starred the 1943-style, drop-dead gorgeous Gene Tierney.  All of that made an average movie fun to watch.  I do have to admit that I'm a Gene Tierney fan.
I realize that her acting is just competent, not great; she's not on the level of, say, Ingrid Bergman, with her emotive power and expressive eyes (but who is?).  It's Tierney's acting style I like, and it's a style that, along with her beauty, makes her endearing, at least to me.  Vincent Price was good, too, being much younger than I was used to, after seeing him associated with horror movies and becoming something between creepy and kinda scary.

491935,4,630266232X,"I suppose, in the better examples of film noir, we are left wondering what motivated the central characters.  We are puzzled about the risks taken, the decisions made, when the words spoken, the background conveyed, do not explain those risky decisions. In the best examples of the form - not exemplified by Laura - we actually care about the main characters while questioning their behavior.  Laura is crisply written, directed with appropriately upbeat tempo, and photographed and lighted with care, but the ultimately shallow screenplay and some mediocre acting from the two leads keeps Laura from reaching the cinematic excellence that so many have accorded it.

The acting exception is Clifton Webb, who portrays critic, social commentator, vacuous old lecher, impertinent snob Waldo Lydecker.  Lydecker is provided the barbed lines, delivered one after another, to which the rest of the cast reacts mostly with expectation.  Webb makes the most of these opportunities, preening in his upscale garb and smarter than anyone persona, but it it is obvious from near the start that Lydecker's soul is empty, his conceit hollow.  The problem is that we are never provided any scrap of insight regarding why this older man came to be so empty, even as we understand his pomposity.  More significantly, we never fully understand his infatuation with Laura.

There are two reasons why Lydecker's infatuation - as indeed, the attraction of the rakish bon vivant, Shelby Carpenter ( an almost sprightly Vincent Price), and the mystical gravitation of the hard-boiled police detective Mark McPherson (a sluggish Dana
Andrews) - to Laura are inexplicable and are the greatest failings of the film:  The script never illuminates what the hell it is that Laura possesses that would captivate the masses as she apparently does - even wooing the listless McPherson with her portrait and her correspondence when she is supposedly dead) and Gene Tierney does not attempt to add much luster to this basically homespun but apparently clueless beauty.  Laura, though not profiled as a woman who gets around, seemingly has difficulty distinguishing any person of much character, hanging around in turn with the insufferable old snob Lydecker, and the woolly-headed climber Carpenter, and finally, falling for the opaque and barely intelligible McPherson, a man who reveals so little about his progress in solving the crime and about how he fell for a supposedly dead woman, that we find ourselves finally hoping for a quick ending.  As McPherson notes near the end of the film, and unfortunately his statement unwittingly describes him as well: ""I must say, for a charming, intelligent girl, you certainly surrounded yourself with a remarkable collection of dopes."" So it is, and the witty and sometimes interesting script never probes that question, and coupling this mystery with the college-girl portrayal that director Preminger and leading lady Tierney offer help us lose interest in the relationships and focus only on the whodunit.  .

A final script failing: There is little sympathy shown for,or exposition regarding the character of the real woman murdered in Laura's apartment while she was away at her country cottage (does anyone note or care that her apartment is spotless and completely undisturbed after a woman was shot there the night prior?). It is disingenuous to question the decision of the writer and director to focus on the lives and motivations of the primary characters (though, as noted, it does not yield much regarding their deeper motivations either), but I cannot let them off the hook for not evoking much from any of the characters regarding sympathy for a poor woman killed by mistake.  Use of the dead as merely a mistaken identity plot device with little respect for what that life might have become (Laura briefly and unconvincingly expresses some regrets, and McPherson tells her to forget it and get some rest) is an inauthentic depiction of the emotional content of real people.  I know this is noir, but someone needs to show some respect for a life taken without reason.  Or is this the weakness of film noir, at its essence?

This is a film worth watching and contemplating but, despite its superficial wit and nicely appointed and lit parlor scenes, not able to deliver on its potential, whatever the allowances of the form.",1390435200,2,4352,5.115655853314528

From the close of World War II to the end of their lives, Gene Tierney, Clifton Webb, Dana Andrews, and Vincent Price kept their date and brought with them news of many kinds; their personal lives were shared, their continued dreams and aspirations remained in abundance and always they preserved the memory of Laura.  When asked, often times, Vincent Price would admit that this was his favorite film - favorite in the sense that he was closest to its cast, their friendships and memories.

There have been many great films, and for the Grace of a quickly assembled cast of elegant and eloquent actors, this single film achieves a most welcomed degree of simple greatness.

492278,2,630266232X,"In a word: overrated. I've become a fan of older films in recent years, and came into this one with high expectations, with descriptions like ""best film noir"" and even ""best movie of all time"" being thrown around. I just don't see it. I almost turned it off several times before it got slighly more interesting in the second half.

This movie is at best a marginally interesting second tier film noir that can't hold a candle to the likes of true noir classics like The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity, Out of the Past, The Big Heat, The Lady From Shanghai, The Postman Always Rings Twice, etc. Not to mention many of the Hitchcock films of the era. Even a supposedly second-tier Bogey/Bacall vehicle like Dark Passage is miles better and more compelling than this one.

The mystery element and direction were fine but the main problems I had with the film was that I felt like I was watching it at a remove, since none of the characters jumped out as being real people, but were more one-dimensional cardboard cutouts. Also, the dialogue was very contrived and was just a little too slick for its own good, and the actors seemed at times to struggle to convey the lines convincingly and seemed to be merely reciting the dialogue in places. The unrealistic dialogue and lack of character development didn't do the actors any favors. Only Clifton Webb stood out in any way. Lastly, the love triangle involving Vincent Price's playboy character and that of Tierney and Anderson was a bit unrealistic, in my opinion.

Laura is by no means a bad film, but it's far from a great one, and as I said, my thumb almost went for that stop button a few times in the first half of the film.",1371168000,,1679,4.552980132450331

492323,5,630266232X,"""Laura"" is one of my favorite films of all time, so beloved that I went through the rigors of waiting for its release, always long delayed for some reason, first on videotape, then laser disc, at long last DVD, and now, finally Blu-ray, and it was worth the struggle.  The Blu-ray is beautiful, and has all the bells and whistles, including a retro ""making of"" featurette, plus ""Biography"" episodes for Gene Tierney and Vincent Price.  If you are already a fan of this film, all you need to know is that the Blu-ray is worth getting, because, like the ""Casablanca"" BR, it will feel like you are seeing the film for the first time.

If you don't know the film but are investigating it, definitely jump in!  ""Laura"" is a sophisticated story about romantic obsession that was far ahead of its time and still fascinates today.  Classified as ""Film Noir,"" it is actually closer to the spirit of ""Citizen Kane,"" where the investigation of a particular event, told mainly in flashback and from different viewpoints, reveals the complex weave of triumph and tragedy that make up a life story.  With a strong literary base for the script (from a novel by Vera Caspary, who wrote several popular psychological thrillers in the 1940s), sharp dialogue, great production design, camerawork that was quite innovative at the time, and an incredible cast, producer-director Otto Preminger fashioned a lush yet subtle tale that examines sexual obsession, gender roles, the class system, societal norms--actually, the only thing it isn't about is murder, which is what it is supposed to be about.  The ethereal Gene Tierney is Laura, whose gruesome murder is being investigated by detective Dana Andrews.  He interviews her friends, starting with Clifton Webb, an outrageous and nasty media personality (he writes a newspaper column that mixes critical reviews with gossip, and has a radio show, a fictional version of then popular Alexander Woollcott and Walter Winchell; then referred to as ""columnists,"" they were the predecessors of Piers Morgan and Howard Stern), who sets the tone for the film's flashbacks.  As he continues to interview Laura's fianc Vincent Price (before he became synonymous with horror films), and rich cousin Judith Anderson, he finds himself despising them and falling in love with the murdered woman, a development not missed by the caustic columnist (Webb), who casts himself as Pygmalion and jealously guards his Galatea, Laura, even in death.  Although ""who dunnit"" is a question that must be answered, the murder mystery is not the center of the story, and the focus on ""why"" rather than ""who"" gives the film its classic stature, and keeps it feeling fresh almost seventy years later.",1364256000,3,2700,5.033632286995516
492324,5,630266232X,I enjoyed watching Laura just as much this time as I did when it was first shown in theaters. I was also delighted to find subtitles were available.  A great nostalgia trip !,1363737600,,174,4.2727272727272725
492325,5,630266232X,"Great concept - so many of the good ones will get a resurgence.  No flashy explosions, no cheap cartoon animation, just people, acting.  As if it was really their passion in life.  I guess big noises, and bight color flashes are more important now....  the story doesn't work to hold their interest.",1363651200,2,299,4.6923076923076925
492326,5,630266232X,"It's hard to create an absent character, then feature them front-and-center without destroying all that mystery and power. Just look at ""Rebecca.""

But one exception to this rule is ""Laura,"" a spellbinding film noir about a rough, clever detective and a society girl suspected of being first the victim, then the murderer. Dark atmosphere, red herrings, and a hefty dose of psychology are all part of the mix in one of Hollywood's strangest love triangles.

A young socialite, Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) has been shot in the face with buckshot. Det. Lt. Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) is sent on the case, investigating Laura's aunt, her gigolo fiancee Shelby (Vincent Price), and her best friend, an acid-tongued gay columnist Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb). No one seems to have a motive for killing Laura -- everyone loved her.

And soon McPherson starts to fall in love with Laura too, with a painting as his guide. Then Laura walks into her apartment, alive and well. Now MacPherson must find out who the dead girl was, and struggles with his jealousy when Laura reunites with her cheating fiancee. But who was the real target -- and what twisted motives do they have?

Few murder mysteries of any kind are as tight and perfectly plotted as ""Laura"" is, and few noirs have as deep an insight into the human mind -- and just how strange and/or twisted love can become. Not many movies can have a guy who falls in love with a girl through a painting, without making it corny.

The movie is taut, intense and slightly overwhelming, with a twist in the middle that throws out all the previous suspicions. It unwinds slowly throughout the film, with the occasional burst of action (MacPherson punching Shelby), right up to an action-packed finale, full with symbolism... and some seriously twisted motives.

But atmosphere alone isn't enough, and there's also some incredibly haunting cinematography and brilliant dialogue (""I don't use a pen. I write with a goose quill dipped in venom""). When MacPherson interviews Laura's maid, she announces, ""I ain't afraid of cops. I was brought up to spit whenever I saw one."" His reply? ""Okay, go ahead and spit if that'll make you feel better.""

Laura's a powerful presence in the first half, and a less talented actress would have wrecked the atmosphere, but Tierney handles it well. Andrews has a crackling Bogart-esque presence here, which makes us like the only honest guy in the movie, and Webb is brilliant as the tart-tongued, frustrated Waldo, who sees Laura as his personal Galatea. And Price has a small but juicy role as a smooth gigolo.

""Laura"" is one of the greatest films noir, full of wonderful acting, dark atmosphere and twisted passion. It's nothing short of brilliant.",1363132800,,2726,4.898047722342733

One review that caught my attention was the person who criticized this DVD because of its occasional washed out scenes. So when viewing it recently I made sure I watched out for this issue. There was one scene in particular where I thought the contrast was defiantly washed out. This scene was when McPherson was interviewing Bessie, Lauras housekeeeper, it was daytime and light from the window was flooding Lauras apartment. This defiantly should have been addressed before released. However, otherwise, most of the scenes I thought had enough contrast. Also what made it so pleasurable for me was the beautiful clear picture with no lines or bleeps in it, and I could see all objects clearly. Also, the sound was great! So overall, when comparing this Blue Ray DVD to my old VHS tape, yes we still have a VCR, its a huge improvement!",1362873600,,905,4.770700636942675
492381,5,630266232X,"Though almost 70 years old, ""Laura"" wears her age lightly. A classic murder mystery, the story is more interested in the characters and their relationships than who actually pulled the trigger. (The script reveals it -- in a indirect and offhand way -- then procedes to obfuscate the revelation with contradictory details. But if you're paying attention, you'll catch it.)

Tierney is her usual beautiful self, while Clifton Webb steals his scenes as an acid-tongued journalist (""I write with a goose quill, dipped in venom.""). I've always liked Dana Andrews, but there was a blandness about his performances that perhaps explains why he gradually slid off the A-actors' list.

Other than Disney, no studio is so consistent in the quality of its video transfers as Fox. ""Laura"" is as gorgeous as its title character. The sound is especially good -- clean, crisp, and vibrant. There are plenty of extras -- running commentaries with David Raksin, Jeanine Basinger, and Rudy Behlmer, A&E biographies of Jean Tierney and Vincent Price, and a featurette on the film itself. Two minutes of the film -- removed during WWII for their depiction of the decadent lifestyles of the rich -- have been restored. These add significantly to our understanding of the relationship of Laura and Lydecker.

HD transfers sometimes reveal things not so noticeable in standard definition. For example, when Clifton Webb comes in out of the rain, his coat is splattered with raindrops -- and they remain throughout the scene. More-significantly, Dana Andrews -- befitting a policeman -- is dressed in a wrinkled, poorly-tailored off-the-rack suit.

Now, Fox... How about a Blu-ray of ""The Ghost and Mrs Muir""?",1362873600,,1686,5.142335766423358

492473,3,630266232X,"""Laura"" on blu-ray is a huge disappointment for me. While this blu-ray transfer does, indeed, offer better image detail than the previous DVD and VHS releases, it lacks the image depth and brilliance one expects from 35mm film. Low contrast in certain scenes makes them badly ""washed out"" and uncomfortable to view. The image is so bad in one exterior daylight scene outside of Laura's apartment building that one might think it was photographed by an amateur cameraman. Otto Preminger (the director of ""Laura,"" for those who don't know) would go ballistic if he were alive to see this. Having met him, I'm convinced he would! I note that Fox has substituted its original logo at the beginning of the picture with a more modern version. That fact gives me a clue as to what happened, and also leads me to believe that this blu-ray is the best ""Laura"" will ever look because Fox could not come up with any better elements. Here's why. Back in the 1950s, Fox sold a package of features to a company called National Telefilm Associates, which distributed the Fox pictures to t-v stations. ""Laura"" was one of the films in the NTA package. On each feature, NTA replaced the original Fox opening logo with its own version. The replacement was cut it into the negative or fine grain positive used by NTA to create its 16mm reduction negative and prints for the t-v stations. Their opening had the 20th Century-Fox animation dissolve into an NTA title card about midway through the Fox fanfare. The NTA card either faded out or dissolved into the main title of the feature. I believe Fox was forced to cut in the new logo at the beginning of ""Laura"" in order to get rid of the NTA credit because all that remains of ""Laura"" is the NTA material. Back in the 50's, film prints for t-v were made low contrast because of the nature of the telecine cameras. So, as disappointing as is this version of ""Laura,"" it's probably as good as we'll ever see, the only chance for something better being a frame by frame digital resortation or Fox finding pre-NTA materials.",1360540800,36,2051,4.637362637362638
492474,5,630266232X,"Regarded as one of the finest film noirs ever made, Otto Preminger's LAURA (20th Century Fox, 1944) is certainly that, and more. While it contains familiar noir aspects - the hard edged detective and the shadowy, urban setting - it lacks a femme fatale in the traditional sense since the title character isn't manipulative and is more preyed upon than predatory. The film is an even mixture of noir, whodunit and psychological romance.

The entire cast is picture perfect: Gorgeous Gene Tierney is the elusive Laura, a role she was born to play, Dana Andrews is the detective smitten with her painted portrait, Clifton Webb plays Laura's possessive benefactor, Vincent Price is her suspicious suitor, and Judith Anderson is Laura's jealous aunt. Everyone delivers a performance that counts among their best work, aided by the bitingly witty screenplay by Jay Dratler, Samuel Hoffenstein and Betty Reinhardt, all under the precise guidance of director Preminger. The haunting score by composer David Raksin is in total harmony with the tone of the film, and adds considerably to our emotional involvement. LAURA is a superb, well crafted film that satisfies on any level.

20th Century Fox has done an exceptional job with its new Blu-ray of this classic film, which does full justice to Joseph LaShelle's crisp, black and white cinematography. The audio fidelity is crystal clear mono, and quite impressive. All the great extra features from Fox's previous DVD have been transferred over.

Several reviewers are complaining about the cover photo; it IS Gene Tierney - the flat lighting and angle are just  giving off a different look.

My highest recommendation.",1360454400,,1662,5.163568773234201
492475,5,630266232X,"At last Fox has released to us, newly bright and polished, without crude splices, jumps, grit and noise, this most perfect of cinematic marvels, the divine Laura (1944).  Nominally a Manhattan murder mystery, it is set amongst a crowd so elite it is free of any wartime references, save an invitation to buy bonds in the end-title.  The wars in Laura are private, conducted by spoiled narcissists, living in vast East Side apartments replete with servants, balconies and objets d'art.  The film's unusual plot is a scaffold for Vera Caspary's social commentary on the character-corrupting effects of beauty, wealth and genius.  We remember the eponymous Laura, the venal suspects in her ""murder,"" and the crackling dialog, still fresh after nearly seventy years, far better than her story.
Laura is a showcase for the ingenue Fox chief Darryl F. Zanuck called ""the most beautiful woman in movie history.""  If Marilyn Monroe photographed as flesh, Gene Tierney, equally beloved by the camera, is living porcelain.  Unlike Monroe, whom everyone felt they could know, Tierney is maddeningly unknowable, unpossessable, like the prize statuette in Zanuck's earlier Warners' production, The Maltese Falcon (1941).  Laura's sphinx-like beauty drives the film relentlessly forward as she fascinates us and everyone else on the screen, never leaving our minds after the picture ends, inviting us to view this film again and again, not to solve its mystery, which we learn in first viewing, but its mysterious power over us that makes it the singular and unique Noir classic it remains today.
Haunting as Tierney's beauty is the movie's theme, now also known as Laura.  Written by David Raksin over a weekend and inspired by a Dear John letter, it is the only song Cole Porter regretted he had not written.  Lovingly recorded no less than four times by Frank Sinatra, also by Ella Fitzgerald, Charlie Parker and countless others it is now a jazz standard.  You hear it here first, long before Johnny Mercer gave it lyrics.  Even a hilarious Spike Jones parody has not diminished its emotional power.
Laura owes an undeniable debt to the equally imperishable Casablanca (1942); they share key devices and elements: romantic triangles, even quadrangles, deft and mesmerizing flashbacks, lost or unrequited love, idealized femininity and American macho, but most importantly the unforgettable characterizations supported by brilliant screenwriting.
Nearly as riveting as Gene Tierney's beauty is Clifton Webb's voice.  He portrays the effete columnist and critic, Waldo Lydecker, modelled, it is said, on Alexander Woollcott.  The movie's narrator and Laura's mentor and promoter, his unmistakable and inimitable voice never before sounded so crisp, eloquent and irresistible as in DTS-HD.  Amazingly, this was Webb's sound film debut at age 54; he was a Broadway celebrity in song and dance for decades.  A very fey presence on screen and gay in his private life, the credibility of his passion for Laura has been questioned in print; in fact it is irrelevant.  Lydecker is a collector of beautiful things and Laura is, to quote him in another context, ""the gem of my collection and I intend to have it back.""
Supporting Tierney and Webb are Vincent Price, as Shelby Carpenter, Laura's sociopathic fiance, the ""six foot baby"" of Caspary's book, and Dame Judith Anderson, the fiendish Mrs. Danvers of Rebecca (1940), no less wicked but far more powerful as Laura's wealthy cougar-aunt.  Piecing the mystery together is the street-smart but socially outclassed detective, Mark McPherson, investigating what he plainly calls Laura's ""collection of dopes.""  Portrayed by Dana Andrews (in substantial lifts, made more obvious in HD; as were Bogart's lifts and wig in Casablanca), he plays fast and loose with our Constitution, invading homes, bank accounts and the physical integrity of suspects, but with a likable credibility and unerring eye for visual detail the cinema always loves.
Finally, in a bow to ethnic diversity and the working class, there is the brief but memorable appearance of Dorothy Adams, a Hollywood stalwart, as Bessie Cleary, Laura's hysterical but devoted Irish-American maid.
So welcome to Laura's apartment, now in HD and as clear and vibrant as Rick's Cafe, and enter a world of entitlement where, though it is 1944, the War has never happened, cigarettes are omnipresent and harmless, drinks are served before noon, we leave work to go dancing at lunchtime and everybody already has a maid, who may care about our murder more than anyone else.",1360368000,3,4556,5.217808219178083

The reason - music rights. When I first saw the film as a kid on TV even I could see that the film contained a horrendous edit, expecially since Lydecker is describing their week and suddenly, and quite crudely, skips several days. So don't even bother to play what FOX calls the ""theatrical version"" - it's the hacked TV version. Hopefully the branching on the Blu-ray is not noticable as it is on the DVD.

492530,5,630266232X,"Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) was enchanting, talented and beautiful--even in death.  Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews), shackled with a deeply romantic nature, was determined to find the killer.  Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price) was a smarmy charlatan--how could anyone love or believe this gigolo?  Ann Treadwell (Judith Anderson) was detached and menacing--without feelings for anyone but herself.  But Clifton Webb as the urbane, prickly  columnist Waldo Lydecker stole the movie--dominating every scene in which he appeared.  His one line interjections framed the humor and his self righteous reminisces drove the mystery.  Perhaps one of  the best performances ever, he certainly deserved an Oscar for which he was nominated but failed to win.  Something to do with being gay in the 1940s.  The haunting theme by David Raskin provides the background mood for the entire film while the portrait (actually a photo retouched to appear as a painting by her former lover Jacobi) haunts McPherson and drives him to discover who was this woman?  Laura is the story of obsession, worship and love.  Fine acting, crisp direction (Preminger won accolades--but the story of that is more complex), shadowy black and white cinematography, sophisticated dialogue, sharply crafted scenes, and fascinating characters make Laura a timeless classic.  In the final scene, a shotgun blast followed by the words ""Goodbye, Laura. Goodbye, my love""--the mood, the mystery, and the romance all merge...  The Blu-ray edition provides both the theatrical edition shown in its initial release and the extended edition which includes scenes deemed too decadent for World War II audiences. There was a war on...and ""we all need to sacrifice"".  Watch the extended edition.  It shows the evolution of Laura from copy girl to executive and style setter.

492594,4,630266232X,"Some might question whether Laura belongs in the film noir category; certainly, several elements that are usually associated with that genre are missing -- a true femme fatale, gritty and often rain swept settings, supporting characters whose souls have been ground down by the pavement or were missing at birth, and so on. But I'm not going to get into a theoretical discussion of necessary versus sufficient. Instead, let me just state my overall view that this is a compelling film with intriguing aspects, but also a work that is unconvincing and ultimately fails to realize all of its potential. The device of starting with a murder that has already occurred and proceeding to flashbacks to draw a portrait of the victim and potential suspects is a good one, but McPherson's growing infatuation with the memory of Laura appears to already be present as the film opens. Presented almost as a given, that fascination -- which evolves into romantic longing -- is improbable and contrived. The murder investigation itself seems rather amateurish at times, with the detective often being sloppy with physical evidence. The film does do a good job, however, in casting genuine suspicion on everyone, including the detective himself, and then comes the moment when the entire plot turns on a dime. That twist is itself rather unconvincing in its evolution, as are subsequent events which in turn make one suspicious of the various possible murderers in turn. Once again there is dull-witted sloppiness on the part of the police, leading to a hairbreadth escape from a second murder. The wavering May-December involvement of Laura and Lydecker is an interesting element, as is the corresponding relationship between Shelby Carpenter and Laura's aunt Ann Treadwell. In the end, however, the fiilm just doesn't have a clean and clever plotline. Clocking in at under 90 minutes, it doesn't have the time for sufficient exposition and wastes what time it does have largely on throwaway episodes that perhaps illuminate the characters but do not advance the evolution of the central mysteryi. The cinematogaphy is excellent and shown off well in this nice print, however, and I can't fault the acting. Though considered a classic by most and certainly worth watching more than once, Laura still remains rather imperfect, and one can't sometimes help not imagining what a true masterpiece it could have been.",1356739200,,2399,5.122448979591836

He takes her under his wing and grooms her for corporate greatness. Later it looks like someone has bumped off Laura. Detective Lt. Mark McPherson is assigned to the case. Somewhere in the process of investigation he seems to have fallen in love with the dead Laura and wants to buy her portrait.

Can we figure out who did it before Mark?

This movie is all that they say it in and then some. Naturally it is not the book ""Laura"" by Vera Caspary. And due to media constraints some things are implied. The characters do not match the book description.

They could not get a good portrait of Gene Tierney for the picture of Laura so they used a photograph and made it look like a portrait. I wonder where that photograph is today.

First time viewing gives you the impression that Waldo Lydecker, is the manipulative person. Yes I know most of the characters are manipulative in nature. But second time viewing, low and behold; who manipulates Waldo from the very beginning and uses his connections to clime the corporate latter? Then pretty much snubs him.

It was interesting to see Vincent price play a character (Shelby Carpenter) that is not in a spook movie.

Look how confident Dana Andrews as Detective Lieutenant Mark McPherson, is in this movie. Also notice his high heal shoes. See him as a completely different character in ""In Harm's Way"" (1965), as Admiral 'Blackjack' Broderick. Also directed by Otto Preminger.

Rarely will you find so many beautiful people in such beautiful settings, with Oscar-winning black-and-white cinematography and a haunting musical score. Gene Tierney, in the title role, is the most beautiful element, and she's matched by co-stars Dana Andrews, Vincent Price, Judith Anderson, and Clifton Webb. Preminger's approach to film noir was unlike that of other directors: this is one of the most straightforward, ""naturalistic"" melodramas of the period. Moody lighting and odd camera angles and deep shadows are not in evidence here; Preminger lets the gripping story itself do all the work of creating an atmosphere of suspense and dread.

The plot is unusual, even by the standards of the genre. A lovely young advertising designer named Laura Hunt (Tierney) has been murdered in her Upper East Side NYC apartment, her face destroyed by a shotgun blast. A tough, disillusioned police detective (Andrews) must determine which of her friends and colleagues might have wanted her dead. Was it the opportunistic gigolo she jilted (Price)? Her jealous aunt (Anderson), who wanted the gigolo for herself? The acerbic critic/mentor (Webb) who secretly desired her? What makes this otherwise routine story unusual (and memorable) is the growing relationship between the cop and the dead woman, who is seen in plenty of flashbacks as each suspect describes her to him. He sits in her empty apartment, staring at a portrait of her and listening to her favorite music (composer David Raksin's famous theme song), and he gradually falls in love with her, obsessed with a ghost. Then, halfway through the story, there's a big surprise (which I won't spoil), leading to a tense solution of the mystery.

Gene Tierney, the then most beautiful screen star, played LAURA, Dana Andrews played the detective, and they were supported by Vincent Price and Judith Anderson.  This movie marked the film debut of Clifton Webb, a broadway song-and-dance man, who would later become very famous indeed.  LAURA reached, and still remains, in the top ranks of FILM NOIR.  That means it is filmed with a lot of dark shadows and a lot of ""mood"".  FILM NOIR had to have rainy night scenes, and LAURA comes up trumps.  AMAZON has this film at a very good price, and I keep it in my collection for those cold Canadian winter evenings when I need to cozy up.  You'll find that LAURA will be one of your ""keepers"", too.

However, there is something special about the film that takes some explaining that only a professional critic could manage. However, I will try. First of all, I liked all the actors, some of whom are particular favorites. Its unusual for me to view a film that doesn't have one actor with whom I have a problem. Even Vincent Price, whom I associate with his later gore films, plays a quite different role. On the other hand, I have never seen a Gene Tierney or Dana Andrews film I did not like.  I know that Andrews is not a favorite with most critics. They seem to find him ""wooden"".  In this film, that fault is perfect for this role as the detective who starts out as the quintesential dective, whose falling in love with Tierney, as potential victim and murderess, a perfect match to the pace of this film.  Clifton Webb plays his customary character.  This time as the jealous lover. Judith Anderson plays a victim of her love for Price.  She doesn't seem to mind how Price's character walks all over  her.  I loved the line where she tells Price that they are both terrible people and deserve each other.

And there is suspence.  When the alledged dead victim, Tierney, walks into her apartment where Andrews, without knowing that by reading her diary and looking at her picture, is falling in love.

A great classic, for lovers of  1940's flics that can be watched with the whole family.  No swearing, sex, violence or gore.  Oh, there is a shot out at the end, but no blood or gore.",1345680000,3,1665,4.488372093023256

This beats all of them, not least because of the superb video quality, which is nearly as good as you will see on TCM.

The sound is loud, crisp and clear, the contrast and focus of the black and white nearly as good as you would have seen in the cinema in 1944. And Hollywood really did to it best then: the beautiful black and white film was one of the major attractions for directors like Hitchcock who emigrated there from other countries. There is the beauty and fine acting of Gene Tierney and the wonderful tune with which the movie begins that is now a standard. You also get a full-length biography of Gene Tierney put together in 1999 on this DVD. The poignant bio alone is worth the price of the complete DVD. Talking of price, there is also a bio of Vincent Price which I haven't seen yet but expect to be also excellent. I won't comment on the plot of ""Laura"", as it's difficult to do so without including spoilers, since there surprises galore. Like all the best films of the 1940s, it has a superb script, with wit, irony and levels of meaning, unlike the trash produced today that relies on special effects and egregious violence.

He's investigating the death of Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney). There are two primary suspects, her old friend Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb) and her fiance Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price).

So Waldo and Shelby tag along behind Lieutenant McPherson as he carries out his investigation. There's a lovely big portrait of Laura in her apartment, and it soon becomes clear to Waldo that Mark McPherson is falling in love with her. That would be tragic, except that she is not dead. She spent a long week-end in her cabin in the mountains, trying to decide whether she really wanted to marry Shelby or not. She creates quite a stir when she shows up alive while Mark is reading her letters and her journal.

Things get complicated in a big hurry when it turns out the woman blasted with a shotgun was not Laura but a model by the name of Diane Redfern that worked in her advertising agency. She was in love with Shelby. And so was Ann Treadwell, Laura's wealthy aunt. In fact, Shelby was her boy toy.

In ""Laura"" she plays a Park Avenue advertising executive and becomes introduced to Waldo Lydecker as a potential source to endorse customer products. The film is set in New York City among the most elegant and sophisticated office, apartment and restaurant scenes.

Albeit, the opening scenes reveal that Laura is dead, and a police detective, played by Dana Andrews, investigates the crime. The single most important clue is that all the men in Laura's life were in love with her, and that includes Waldo (Clifton Webb), a powerful radio commentator that eventually tried to lure Laura with his influence and charm her with worldly possessions. Vincent Price was in love with Laura too, but we learn that he quite regularly falls in love, since he is broke, unable to stoop to a job, so requires the company of at least a working girl.

This movie is a well made romantic drama, a film noir in its day and even until now has the strength to entertain well. Shock scenes build the suspense as the conclusion comes with a surprise. And I will  not spoil it!

The theme music ""Laura"" was very popular and remains so to this day.

However, on viewing it, I was quite dismayed by how disappointing it was. For example, the whole episode of the return of the title character, Laura, was especially amateurish, awkward, and unimaginative in execution. I felt like, ""That's it?? I must have skipped a section!"" However, I reviewed it, and I had not missed any part of the film...unfortunately.

The film begins with great potential, a potential which fizzles dismally by the middle of the story. I was disappointed to the point of anger near the end of the story.

To end with the positives, it shows Gene Tierney at her most beautiful and alluring, and the handsome Dana Andrews at his very best. The problem is not the actors, but the plot construction, which is primitive, adolescent, and ultimately very disappointing. The attractive, talented actors could not have saved the script writing.

The ""perfect film noir"" it is NOT. It is worth a viewing just to see Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews, but don't expect a great execution of the story.",1327104000,3,1153,4.86734693877551

Dana Andrews gives a slightly glum performance as he begins to fall in love with Laura's portrait, and Gene Tierney is the worldly innocent who can't see what's happening around her.  Vincent Price and Judith Anderson are equally good, but no one is going to top Clifton Webb (in his best performance) as Machiavellian Waldo Lydecker.  A lizard in a tailored suit if ever there was one!  Preminger's direction is great and the score and screenplay are first class.  There are enough twists and turns in the plot to keep you guessing right up to the climax.  Two other points to mention, and one I've made before.  Dana Andrews was one of the most under-appreciated actors of his generation.  Whether cast as hero or villian, he was always rock solid in his performance.

I was riveted. To say I was not expecting this triumph is putting it mildly. As a matter-of-fact I had other plans: I would watch a few minutes of this movie and then go on with my previous plans. Not so fast! - ""Laura"" changed all that. I was not going anywhere until I saw this stunner to the end. I was not prepared for this classic. They had shown great movies before - but all the while I kept thinking: ""Am I really seeing something this spectacular for free?"" Yes, ""Laura"" is just that fascinating, riveting and marvelously acted and written.
I did not recognize the young Dana Andrews as the detective at first. Yet was delighted to find out it was him. I recall he later played on a soap opera. Clifton Webb is splendid as the sour and dour journalist - I recently saw him in ""Cheaper by the Dozen."" Vincent Price is superb in his role; this surpases any of the monsters he later became famous for playing in his career. The lovely Gene Tierney; what accolades can be bestowed upon her? I like her in all the roles I have seen her in so far. There always seem to be something smouldering beneath the surface in the characters she plays. She has been accused by some of just being beautiful. I do not agree with that-she has a great quality to her persona that she brings to her acting - a sort of arcanum quality - maybe it's in her eyes. Whatever it is - I'm hooked. I plan on seeing all or her movies! I recently saw her in ""Toys in the Attic.""

492816,5,630266232X,"Laura is a film noir in the same vain as Maltese Flacon. That is to say, it is not so much dark and atmospheric as it is a detective story. Also like Maltese Falcon, most of the enjoyment of the film is not it's plot, but it's memorable and fun characters. They are all great, from the gorgeous title character Laura (who goes against the femme fatal character type) to the charismatic Shelby (played wonderfully by a young Vincent price!), but my personal favorite is the super egotistical and weak intellectual Waldo, played by Clifton Webb. Webb steals each and every scene he's in, which is partially credited to his well written dialogue that's still funny to this day. Actually, that's one of the things that makes this film so great: it's timeless.

There are a few problems with this film, though. The allusion towards a dream sequence never really comes into play, and the conclusion feels like it was rushed in there and the film ends abruptly. Both of these things are due to the scripts ending needing to be re-written.

Still, Laura is a classic I'd suggest everyone watch.",1323907200,,1086,4.680628272251309

The story is a murder mystery that takes a 90 degree turn in the middle of the movie...which takes the air out of the whole ""mystery"" aura. It's really not a mystery amyway since the perpetrator can be narrowed down to only 4 suspects.

This movie consists of a murder victim, her trustfund-baby lover (Vincent Price in a very different role for what he would be later known for) , her obviously gay, svengali-like mentor, a devoted housekeeper and an extremely instrusive detective. Each charactor is horribly annoying and spewing out dialogue that is not only unbelievable but also completely intolerable to a normal person. I know in a ""film noir"", the viewer should accept the quirks for what they are but the dialogue and mannerisms are so utterly ridiculous.

The most appealing aspect of the film is the actress who plays ""Laura"", Gene Tierney. Holy Smokes was she gorgeous and elegant looking. What is fascinating is that she is the voice of reason within the film but, I believe, she suffered from mental illness and led a tragic life after this film.

But, when Director Mamoulian's daily rushes turned out to be disappointing, Preminger convinced Zanuck to let him direct the film as well. The result is astoundingly good. Of all of the  great films I have seen, this is my personal favorite and always  has been.

Gene Tierney is absolutely wonderful as the enchanting Laura, who captivates hard-boiled detective Dana Andrews from the grave. The more he learns about her life and character, and the more he gazes at her beauty in the painting above her fireplace, the more smitten he becomes. Assisting in creating the sopisticated and noirish mood  of the film is the set design of Laura's ladylike and inviting NYC apartment, and her fabulously becoming Bonnie Cashin wardrobe. Any  girl would want the matching hat and raincoat sported by Gene Tierney in her entrance to the film. The other set design which is amazing is Waldo Lydecker's (Clifton Webb) penthouse apartment. Two fabulous antique clocks play key roles in the plot, as well as some glimpses of extraordinary Chinese vases.  One can only imagine the refined tastes of the characters who own these items. Adding to the haunting and ethereal mood of the film is the original score by David Raksin. Although Preminger wanted to use a Duke Ellington tune for the theme, he was convinced of the suitability of Raksin's ""Laura"" melody. (Preminger did later use Ellington's music to create a blue mood in ""Anatomy of a Murder"" to great effect). The rest of the literally five star cast is unbelievable as well.

Clifton Webb embodies the fussy, ascerbic, dandified Lydecker, whom author Caspary based upon forties radio personality Alexander Woolcott, a famous wit (who called his home ""Wit's End""). After initially not even wanting Webb on the Fox lot, Zanuck put him in many  Fox films on which he also left indelible  marks (""Sitting Pretty,"" ""Cheaper by the Dozen""). Vincent Price makes a very attractive gigolo before he became a famous ghoul in later films, and Judith Anderson gives a contolled performance as Laura's attractive aunt, quietly  seething with jealousy of her beautiful niece.

The plot has some nice twists, and the story is absorbing. This dvd also comes with a biography of the tragic Tierney, as well as one of Vincent Price. Too bad we don't find out more about Dana Andrews who was one of Preminger's favorite actors and appears in many of his films (he is like De Niro to Preminger's Scorcese of the period).

It's a classic movie detective story of the film noir genre with its haunting iconic theme music of the title song. Gene Tierney is the murder victim, and Dana Andrews is the detective, Detective Lieutenant Mark McPherson, who falls in love with the deceased. Webb plays Waldo Lydecker, a snide, nasty columnist and radio broadcaster who can make or break careers.
Price is a gigolo named Shelby, a Southern smoothie, who is beloved by Ann Treadwell played by the noted actress Judith Anderson who became famous for her portrayal of Euripides's Medea.
The movie in black and white holds up very well, and has a solid plot although some of the alibis get convoluted at times--especially Vincent Price's. It's Hitchcockian which is all to the good. It's based on a Vera Caspary novel.
It's rather strange that Dana Andrews does all his investigating without a partner, travels in cabs, and that he lets Webb tag along while interviewing suspects. To Andrews women are dames or dolls which makes him crude in Lydecker's eyes. Laura's successful career in advertising was the result of Lydecker's sponsorship.

492884,5,630266232X,"Laura is the film which made me fall in love with the movies. When Otto Preminger was told to take over this project from wunderkind Rouben Mamoulian, it was reportedly a mess. How much was already in the can has always been in dispute, some still maintaining that the famous opening shots are director Mamoulian's work. David Raksin's famous score, however, so beautiful and haunting that it set the tone for the entire film, had not yet been written. Preminger told Raksin to take the weekend and come up with something or he would use Duke Ellington's Sophisticated Lady instead.

Raksin's marriage was falling apart at the time, and over the weekend he wrote the theme from Laura as much for his wife as for the film. Sadly, it did not save his marriage. It did, however, change forever this film. Raksin's score was so haunting and beautiful that Preminger framed the entire picture around it. Decades later, both this film and Raksin's lovely score are regarded as two of the best to ever come out of Hollywood.

Dana Andrews had his greatest role as Detective Mark McPherson, assigned the murder of society girl Laura Hunt due to office politics. Wlado Lydecker is also the role for which Clifton Webb will best be remembered. He gives an outstanding performance as the deceased Laura's vain and famous benefactor. Using his wit and intellect to destroy all of Laura's suitors in his weekly column, we see everything played out in flashbacks told to McPherson during the investigation.

Vincent Price had his best non-horror role as Shelby Carpenter, the one man Waldo could not drive away. Laura was to have been married to Carpenter, a heel with perfect manners. The more McPherson learns about Laura the more he wonders why such a sweet and down to earth girl ended up a society page murder mystery. She liked baseball and shares a favorite book with McPherson. Her portrait, painted by one of the suitors Lydecker destroyed in his column, hangs ominously above the chair where Mark McPherson reads her diary, searching for clues that will help him unravel the mystery of both her life, and her violent death.

Laura's fiercely loyal maid, Bessie, protects Laura's reputation at every turn. McPherson is sympathetic and wants to protect her reputation also, as he has fallen for a ghost. David Raksin's haunting score sets the atmosphere to every film buff's favorite mystery romance. Halfway through this film, on a rainy night in Laura's apartment, the entire case will be turned upside down in one of the most famous twists in screen history.

This film was adapted from the terrific Vera Caspary novel of 1943 and is a mystery classic as well. Both the novel and the film are timeless treasures to be cherished. This is one of the finest films ever made and one you simply have to see. You will never feel the same about the movies after buying and watching this film.

The owner was a professor and he gave lectures about the movies preceding them which were wonderful.  We spent at least ten years there catching up on cinema.  One of our earliest film fanatic discoveries was LAURA. He told us our film ouvre was sadly deficient lacking this film.

Otto Preminger was a first rate film director.  There isn't a wasted second on his picture.  There is the absolutely gorgeous Gene Tierney who plays Laura.  She was also a very good actress. Not too far into the movie, Laura is murdered .  The detective assigned to the case is the handsome, magnetic Dana Andrews. He begins by sifting through Laura's apartment.  There is a big portrait of her looking down at him almost everywhere he turns. He starts mourning the loss of such a woman as he tries to find clues to the suspect. Then the movie takes a 180 degree twist.

Anyone who loves classic films or film noir should see it.  I am surprised that no on has reviewed the film before this, because it really is good.  Otto Preminger directed this stylish film.  In true film noir style, it uses light and shadows to good effect.  The set design and costumes are sumptuous, and the theme song is a lush, beautiful piece that suites the film well, and has since become something of a jazz standard.

In the story, Laura is loved by three men, but each of them have their own distinct reasons for loving her, and for each of them that love is self-serving.  To them, Laura isn't just a woman, but is a symbol of something each of them wants.  This movie is a mystery with romance, but the romance is less than pure.  Just as film noir uses light and darkness to convey an atmosphere, the movie shows the light and the dark sides of love to show human nature.  But mainly it is good entertainment, and fun to watch Clifton Webb's being catty, and Vincent Price in something that is not a horror film.",1249171200,13,1317,4.472803347280335

She's competent, but I wouldn't call her brilliant. I'm told that she is all these things but I really can't see it for myself. I can't, in my own imagination, see her walking into a room and turning everyone's head around, making men ""desirous"" or women ""envious"".

493028,4,630266232X,"The presence of Vincent Price alone is enough to make this film worth watching. The man had one of the most memorable theatrical personalities that ever graced the screen. His voice rang like a haunting tones cutting through fog. His smallest gestures expressed volumes of expression and emotion. Even when he overacted (which was much of the time) he did it with a singular type of flair that made it engaging rather than laughable. He had style. He had flair. And he had panache. That's a star. That's what makes an icon. His role in ""Laura"" shows yet another facet of his abilities. His characterization of Shelby Carpenter is of a man who's weak yet charming and fickle yet strangely loyal. It's a complex role and he managed it with the aplomb typical of his bearing. It's no surprise that his presence is dominant most of the times he's on the screen.

This isn't meant to downplay the contribution from others in the cast. Gene Tierney, one of the al-time great beauties of the silver screen is radiant in the title role. She manages a combination of aloofness and down home appeal that's nothing short of remarkable. The woman was as talented as she was lovely. Dana Andrews was cast perfectly as the detective who falls for the mysterious beauty as he unearths the details of her life. His portrayal of a man whose dedication becomes love and, ultimately, dangerous obsession is a gripping one. Judith Anderson gives a strong performance as the Aunt of the title character. Her turn as the slightly snobbish woman who may or may not be a rival is engaging and could have stood more screen time than it was given.

Then there's Clifton Webb. Few actors have been so adept at playing characters so loathsome there's nothing to do but hate them. His character is loathsome the moment he opens his mouth. After that he's easy to hate simply for being there. There's no redeeming the nature of the man he plays. He is vile. He is arrogant. He holds his fellow beings in contempt. The few he likes he sees as possessions. He's patronizing and/ or annoyingly condescending towards everyone. And yet it's impossible not watch him. Clifton Webb was a master of this. His personality was nearly as theatrical as Price's. Watching the two of them together is a treat that's not to be missed.

The film itself is a pleasure to watch. The story by Vera Gaspary (novel) and Jay Dratler (screenplay) is tightly written and filled with rich characterizations. The Direction, by Otto Preminger, is terse and moves the story at a brisk pace. Emotions are kept veiled but always feel close to the surface. The cinematography by Joseph LaShelle is excellent. As is the case in many of the better films from the 'Noir' genre the construction of the individual scenes allows the eye to 'read' the picture almost from one frame to the next. The lighting and photography compliment the shots perfectly. The sets are full and rich but also uncluttered. On the downside some of the costumes are fashion disasters (perfect for those ""What Were They Thinking"" montages) and there's one enormous gaffe near the end of the picture. That's what cost it one star here incidentally. That gaffe should have been caught before the film was ever released. More attention to the final edit could have fixed the second faux pas but some of those clothes (especially the hats that belong in a story about a white whale and a deranged captain) are beyond hope.

But those are small complaints. 'Laura' is a film that stands the test of time, and with good reason. The story it tells is a good one. The passions it deals with are timeless. And it's done well. That counts as much as anything else. The restoration and transfer to DVD is excellent. This disc comes with some strong extras as well. There are biographical features on both Price and Tierney. Both are informative, absorbing and well worth watching. There's also a deleted scene that's shown separately and an extended version of the original release.

This is a good package. Fans of older films will love it. For people who aren't familiar with older films it may be a good place to start.

493033,5,630266232X,"""Laura"" is a murder mystery which contains one of the best and most surprising plot twists ever. I don't want to go into any more detail about the plot, as it might spoil it for you. I saw this film for the first time, on late night television, about 20 years ago and have seen it numerous times since. I consider it to be among my favourite films of all time. It is not just the plot twists that makes it a great film, but also the characters and the actors who play them: the arrogant and sarcastic Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), who is one of my family's favourite fictitious characters; and the enigmatic Laura (Gene Tierney) who might not be as nice as she initially appears.

""Laura"" is based on a book by Vera Caspary, which I also highly recommend. The movie follows the book reasonably closely, but in a number of ways improves on the book. I see the movie as being a darker version of its source material.

This is one of the lesser known film noir films, but is by no means lesser in quality or entertainment value. I highly recommend this film to any fans of the noir genre or to fans of mysteries in general.",1214092800,,1121,4.308056872037914
493034,5,630266232X,"What is there not to love about this film? From the stark, stylized chiaroscuro cinematography, which won it an Academy Award in 1944, to its stellar performances, deft direction, and intelligent screenplay, it is simply a marvelous film. It was adapted from the novel of the same name by Vera Caspary. To add icing to the cake, there is a haunting musical score that will stay with the viewer long after the final credits have scrolled away.

This classic, old-fashioned murder mystery features a stunning Gene Tierney in the title role and old time favorite Dana Andrews as Detective Lt. Mark McPherson, the hardboiled, virile gumshoe who finds himself smitten the minute he sees the portrait of Laura Hunt at the scene of the crime. He is determined to bring the murderer of this lovely young woman to justice. As have all the men in Laura's life, McPherson, too, becomes obsessed with her.

When a major, mind-boggling twist in the plot casts a new light on the evidence, McPherson goes full speed ahead, as new developments point the finger of suspicion from the least likely to the most likely suspect. Could it be Laura's jealous aunt, Ann Treadwell (Dame Judith Anderson), who seems to be hot to trot with Laura's fiance, Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), despite the differences in their respective ages? Could it be Laura's playboy fiance? After all, he has a shady past and a penchant for money and other women, especially those who could keep him in the style to which he would like to become accustomed. Could it even be Laura's long time friend, mentor, and spurned would be suitor, the acerbic writer and self-styled cynic, Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb)?

Gene Tierney gives a luminous performance as Laura Hunt, the beautiful, intelligent, independent businesswoman who is somewhat of a cipher. She is someone to whom men are drawn, often obsessively so. Dana Andrews is perfect in the role of Detective McPherson. His no nonsense, street smart, hunky detective is a great counterpoint and foil to the more effete and prissy Waldo Lydecker. Clifton Webb is positively brilliant in the role of Waldo Lydecker and steals the show from under the noses of his co-stars. This is no mean feat given the enormous talent of the film's stellar cast. Webb's droll, spot on delivery of the wonderful lines that he was given are memorable.

Vincent Price is excellent in the role of Shelby Carpenter, Laura's Callow fiance and erstwhile gigolo. At first, however, he took a little getting used to, as I was used to seeing Vincent Price in roles associated with gothic horror. Still, he acquits himself admirably. Dame Judith Anderson is memorable in the small role of Laura's desperate aunt, Ann Treadwell, who knows what she wants and will pay whatever price is necessary to get it. Of course, Otto Preminger deserves kudos for his deft direction, as does Samuel Hoffenstein for writing a screenplay infused with such great dialogue. Kudos also go to David Raskin, as his memorable score will forever be loved and remembered by those who enjoy this film. It is certainly one that is worthy of a place in one's personal film collection.",1212883200,,3140,4.896616541353383

493036,3,630266232X,"The picture nobody wanted, Laura was one of Fox's most notorious bad-luck pictures, and some of the bad luck stuck. After all the studio's A-list directors had turned it down (one of whom, John Brahm, ironically went on to remake it as Portrait For Murder in TV's 20th Century Fox Hour), Rouben Mamoulian began the picture until producer Preminger took over, reshooting much of his footage. Even David Raksin's famous theme only came about when Alfred Newman, Bernard Herrmann et al had turned down the picture. The result may well be an acknowledged classic, but while it's good, it's not THAT good.

Something is missing. That we are unaware of working-class detective Andrews' infatuation with the dead murder victim Laura until until the venal Waldo Lydecker tells him, despite Andrews fine performance, is indicative of the problems of the film. That we have to be told so much instead of sensing it for ourselves is one of the film's greatest weaknesses. Some of this can be attributed to Darryl F. Zanuck's penchant for over-editing - it takes a while for it to become clear that the victim's face has been shot off - some to rewrites, but regardless of their cause, all play against the film. Structurally, too, it is scarred. The decision to reduce the original three narrators to one either goes too far or not far enough: as it stands, Waldo's opening narration is soon ignored and later lacks logic.

Despite her awe-inspiringly bad taste in hats (she favors the S'Wester look), Gene Tierney is all about the look, not the performance here. While the painting of Laura (in reality a touched up photograph) holds a magical allure, she cannot live up to the eulogies of the supporting cast in the flesh. The real stars of the show are Vincent Price's Southern gigolo and Clifton Webb, great fun in an overwritten part as the patron saint of purple prose Waldo Lydecker that makes the film feel like a Joe Mankiewicz drawing room thriller rather than a noir.

Yet for all its weaknesses, Laura is full of good things. There is some brilliant camerawork from Joseph LaShelle, who took over from Mamoulian's choice of Lucien Ballard after filming Webb's screen test (refusing to read for the role, Webb chose to do his Blithe Spirit monologue for the cameras instead!), while David Raksin's theme effectively haunts the detective in its various guises wherever he goes. When the two combine, as in a superb tracking shot that keeps Laura's portrait present in the frame with Andrews as he wanders through her apartment, they become the veritable blood in her veins, creating an impression that no actress could ever live up to. At times the picture even adds up to more than the sum of its parts and it's still a good wallow, but it's one best approached with few expectations if you want to get the most out of it.",1210550400,6,2822,4.766871165644171

493077,5,630266232X,"It's hard to create an absent character, then feature them front-and-center without destroying all that mystery and power. Just look at ""Rebecca.""

But one exception to this rule is ""Laura,"" a spellbinding film noir about a rough, clever detective and a society girl suspected of being first the victim, then the murderer. Dark atmosphere, red herrings, and a hefty dose of psychology are all part of the mix in one of Hollywood's strangest love triangles.

A young socialite, Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) has been shot in the face with buckshot. Det. Lt. Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) is sent on the case, investigating Laura's aunt, her gigolo fiancee Shelby (Vincent Price), and her best friend, an acid-tongued gay columnist Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb). No one seems to have a motive for killing Laura -- everyone loved her.

And soon McPherson starts to fall in love with Laura too, with a painting as his guide. Then Laura walks into her apartment, alive and well. Now MacPherson must find out who the dead girl was, and struggles with his jealousy when Laura reunites with her cheating fiancee. But who was the real target -- and what twisted motives do they have?

Few murder mysteries of any kind are as tight and perfectly plotted as ""Laura"" is, and few noirs have as deep an insight into the human mind -- and just how strange and/or twisted love can become. Not many movies can have a guy who falls in love with a girl through a painting, without making it corny.

The movie is taut, intense and slightly overwhelming, with a twist in the middle that throws out all the previous suspicions. It unwinds slowly throughout the film, with the occasional burst of action (MacPherson punching Shelby), right up to an action-packed finale, full with symbolism... and some seriously twisted motives.

But atmosphere alone isn't enough, and there's also some incredibly haunting cinematography and brilliant dialogue (""I don't use a pen. I write with a goose quill dipped in venom""). When MacPherson interviews Laura's maid, she announces, ""I ain't afraid of cops. I was brought up to spit whenever I saw one."" His reply? ""Okay, go ahead and spit if that'll make you feel better.""

Laura's a powerful presence in the first half, and a less talented actress would have wrecked the atmosphere, but Tierney handles it well. Andrews has a crackling Bogart-esque presence here, which makes us like the only honest guy in the movie, and Webb is brilliant as the tart-tongued, frustrated Waldo, who sees Laura as his personal Galatea. And Price has a small but juicy role as a smooth gigolo.

""Laura"" is one of the greatest films noir, full of wonderful acting, dark atmosphere and twisted passion. It's nothing short of brilliant.",1208044800,,2726,4.898047722342733

493079,4,630266232X,"Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) is a beautiful and intelligent woman with a successful career in advertising; by all accounts she's admired and well-liked and possesses many fine qualities.  At the start of the film we learn that she's been murdered in her own home and that the detective on the case, Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews), has already found a few suspects to investigate.  One suspect is writer and critic Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), Laura's mentor and close friend who helped her launch her career and refine her style and taste.  Another is Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), Laura's fiance; he's got some charm and an easygoing manner, but is also shiftless and morally weak.  Then there's Laura's aunt, Mrs. Treadwell (Judith Anderson), who is in love with Shelby and not very discreet about her affection and their affair.

McPherson is a level-headed detective who finds an interesting way to keep calm as he deals with these people and the intricate stories they craft; he has a knack for asking the right questions and cutting through people's airs and posturing.  As his investigation deepens though, he finds it increasingly difficult to remain cool and detached.  He's been visiting Laura's home, looking through her clothes and belongings, reading her letters and private diary, and finding himself bewitched by her enchanting portrait.  He's obsessed with her and likely falling in love with her too, even as he believes her to be a dead woman.  Imagine his shock then when he sees her stepping into her home one night, nonchalant and clearly unharmed.

The film is a treat in many ways.  The script is clean, sharp and delivered well by all the actors.  The actors are extremely well-suited for their roles.  Price conveys both the shambling charm and fundamental cowardice of the fiance.  Webb is terrific as the poisonous critic and Laura's possessive older friend.  Tierney is stunning as Laura, bringing beauty to the screen and giving her character a kindness, gentleness and elegant restraint.  Andrews plays out his character's emotions in an understated way, with subtle gestures and slight shifts of facial expression.  In one brilliant scene, where Laura herself has become a suspect to the murder and his character is interrogating her at the police station, he conveys really well the shifts between the impersonal questions about her alibi and the more urgent, personal questions about her relationship with another suspect, who has essentially become the detective's romantic rival.  My one main quibble with the film was a desire to better understand Laura herself, and why she seeks out the company of the men in her life; the beginnings and ends of certain relationships seemed much more like plot contrivances than anything truly character-driven.  Tierney and Andrews, while working well together, don't generate that crackle of tension and mutual attraction.

Still, Laura is wonderfully well-crafted and atmospheric.  The film doesn't need to show us a dead body or blood stains in order to create a chilling mood.  The way in which the murder victim dies is brutal - a shotgun blast to the face - but the deed itself remains offscreen.  The film creates its moods and builds tension through atmosphere and music, intense and involving exchanges of dialogue, and well-placed details.",1205539200,,3324,5.126159554730983

Recently I reviewed a film noir , Where The Sidewalk Ends, that no way, no way in hell,  when I started out this jail break-out reviewing process of the old time films from the mid-1940s to the mid-1950s did I figure to be reviewing. Except that film with its line-up, as here, of Dana Andrews, Gene Tierney and director Otto Preminger got me thinking about Laura. From the plot line it appears that I was not alone in thinking of her and I will just have to stand in line until she tires of  whoever is next in line to get tired of.

 Additionally, there  is no way, no way in hell,  I would  have believed that I would be, seemingly endlessly now, on a Dana Andrews run. Bogie, no question, Robert Mitchum sure, even Dick Powell in a pinch but Dana Andrews? Oh well, at least he has classic good girl (no femme fatale here she is hard-working  career women in advertising) Gene Tierney to keep his eyes on once he gets control of his emotions (and lays off the bottle).

But enough of that. This is a  story with great arch dialogue ( if somewhat dated for today's audiences) although I am sure some would argue that it is not really a noir but more a little Thin Man series mystery comedy fluff whatever.  In any case every guy in New York, every guy with eyes anyway and maybe even guys who don't see so well, has a bee-line straight for Laura (played of course by Gene Tierney). Even a guy, a police detective (played by seemingly perennial cop Dana Andrews)  who has never met her and is only ""interested"" in her because she has been murdered ( a little anyway, if there is such a thing) and as a good methodical, if somewhat blas, cop he has to put the pieces together and see if they fit. In short, who done it.

Wait in line, brothers and sisters. It could have been half the women in NewYork, well, upper-side New York anyway jealous of Laura' charms (and tired of their companions' head-turns). It could have been half the guys in New York who never had a chance at her. But let's narrow the field a little. Narrow it to her cash-strapped gigalo fianc Shelby (played by a very young Vincent Price) and Laura's older gentleman friend (I am being polite as they were then) Waldo (played by Clifton Webb), the great society newspaper writer , who introduced Laura to upper-crust New York society. Of course Waldo has this little problem, this little homicidal  problem about his affections for Laura and that's what drives the twist and turns of the film. As for our good guy detective well for his efforts, in the end, he gets the girl. Natch.",1195430400,,2765,4.385518590998043

Gene Tierney is lovely, angelic & a mystery. She's perfect in this role, but she's only in the later half of it! Which is 1 reason why she didn't want the role. The detective falls in love with a dead woman, only to find out he's 1 of 3 men so possessed. The murder victim becomes a murder suspect.

It was a very hot day when Laura Hunt was murdered by a shotgun blast. Mr. Waldo Lydecker was questioned by another detective, Mark MacPherson. Lydecker writes a newspaper column on crime and murders. Laura's aunt is questioned about her payments to Mr. Shelby Carpenter. Lt. MacPherson goes to Laura's apartment, where her murder occurred. Laura came to New York to work in advertising, and tries to get a paid endorsement from Lydecker (how things work). Lydecker changed his mind, and became a promoter of Laura. She now moved in High Society circles. The story tells about the lives of Laura, Waldo, and Shelby. Laura helped Shelby, and Waldo is now jealous. The film shows the attitudes of the people in those days, according to Hollywood. Who bought a bottle of ""Black Pony"" scotch to Laura's place?

The film is slow-paced and talky, like a stage play. There is a shocking surprise while Lt. MacPherson is in Laura's apartment. We learn more about Laura's past activities. The question now is who made a mistake in killing the woman? Shelby tells Lt. MacPherson about what happened Friday night. So all of Laura's friends are invited over for the grand finale, where the detective will interview all the people and solve the crime in a dramatic ending. There is another complication with Laura's behavior. But Lt. MacPherson figures out the likely suspect at the end.

493178,5,630266232X,"It's hard to create an absent character, then feature them front-and-center without destroying all that mystery and power. Just look at ""Rebecca.""

But one exception to this rule is ""Laura,"" a spellbinding film noir about a rough, clever detective and a society girl suspected of being first the victim, then the murderer. Dark atmosphere, red herrings, and a hefty dose of psychology are all part of the mix in one of Hollywood's strangest love triangles.

A young socialite, Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) has been shot in the face with buckshot. Det. Lt. Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) is sent on the case, investigating Laura's aunt, her gigolo fiancee Shelby (Vincent Price), and her best friend, an acid-tongued gay columnist Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb). No one seems to have a motive for killing Laura -- everyone loved her.

And soon McPherson starts to fall in love with Laura too, with a painting as his guide. Then Laura walks into her apartment, alive and well. Now MacPherson must find out who the dead girl was, and struggles with his jealousy when Laura reunites with her cheating fiancee. But who was the real target -- and what twisted motives do they have?

Few murder mysteries of any kind are as tight and perfectly plotted as ""Laura"" is, and few noirs have as deep an insight into the human mind -- and just how strange and/or twisted love can become. Not many movies can have a guy who falls in love with a girl through a painting, without making it corny.

The movie is taut, intense and slightly overwhelming, with a twist in the middle that throws out all the previous suspicions. It unwinds slowly throughout the film, with the occasional burst of action (MacPherson punching Shelby), right up to an action-packed finale, full with symbolism... and some seriously twisted motives.

But atmosphere alone isn't enough, and there's also some incredibly haunting cinematography and brilliant dialogue (""I don't use a pen. I write with a goose quill dipped in venom""). When MacPherson interviews Laura's maid, she announces, ""I ain't afraid of cops. I was brought up to spit whenever I saw one."" His reply? ""Okay, go ahead and spit if that'll make you feel better.""

Laura's a powerful presence in the first half, and a less talented actress would have wrecked the atmosphere, but Tierney handles it well. Andrews has a crackling Bogart-esque presence here, which makes us like the only honest guy in the movie, and Webb is brilliant as the tart-tongued, frustrated Waldo, who sees Laura as his personal Galatea. And Price has a small but juicy role as a smooth gigolo.

Dana Andrews plays McPherson, the hard-boiled detective investigating the shocking murder of a society woman, Laura, in New York.

The filming of this story is gorgeous black and white with cunningly utlized shadow that threatens the characters--or reveals their underlying motivation.

Clifton Webb does a nice job as the poisonous, dried-out sophisticate.  Gene Tierney as Laura is gorgeous, charming and elegant.  Unfortunately her character weakens rather than strengthens throughout the film.  Laura starts out as an assertive individualist who challenges the values of sophisticated society.

Investigating the murder of a beautiful young woman, Andrews questions the various users, liars and suspects of 1940's New York--including the acidic Clifton Webb, the fatuous Vincent Price, and the no-nonsense Judith Anderson--and his face looks like its been chipped out of granite.  It is only back in Laura's apartment, staring at her portrait over the fireplace as the rain beats on the windows and David Rashkin's haunting theme plays, that we see the loss and pain flicker in his eyes.  The shadows grow, Andrews falls asleep...and one of filmdom's greatest twists kicks in.  As the mystery woman of the title, Gene Tierny is a mixture of gossamer and iron; her beautiful face and seductive eyes promise romance for the ages, but her flat, hard voice when confronted shows the hard reality behind such sweet illusions.  ""Laura"" twists and stings like a citrus rind in a glass of gin, and if the dialogue were any sharper, you could serve shishkabobs on it.  It's a romance for cynics, velvet gloves wrapped around brass knuckles.  Marvel at the nancy-boy smirkiness of Price and Webb, contrasted with the smooth cool of Anderson (she steals one scene while putting on lipstick, as though she didn't even notice she's committing grand theft).  Sigh as you try to imagine Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer standing in for Andrews and Tierney--and failing.

He's the detective investigatng the murder of a young woman believed to be Laura Hunt, shot in the face with both barrels of a shotgun. That's an important fact to remember even though the body is never shown. We have the start of the much acclaimed, & rightly so, noir murder mystery, Laura. We have a rogues' gallery of prominent suspects. They are a rather disagreeable lot. Casting could not have been better. Clifton Webb is the insufferable radio columnist, Waldo Lydecker. He is the narraror of much of the movie & the cultural mentor to the younger Laura, (Couldn't you just slap him?). He is love with Laura almost as much as he's in love with himself. He is violently against her marriage to: Shelby Carpentor, played
by Vincent Price the once wealthly but now broke fiance' of Laura. He's a playboy, cheats on Laura & has never worked a day in his life. Then there is Judith Anderson as the rich widow, Ann Treadwell. She is desperately in love with Shelby & will do anything to have him. Finally, a mysterious young model that works for Laura & is Shelby's lover. That leaves poor Lt. McPherson to fall in love with the hauntingly, beautiful portrait of Laura, (Gene Tierney) above the mantle. Lt. McPherson likes to drink. So he does, at Laura's home using Laura's booze while on the job questioning the suspects. He dines with the suspects & they pick up the tab. Things have changed in the police dept. This novel transfered very well to the screen in the hands of director Otto Preminger. It is early in his career but it is some of his best work. You may figure out who did it before the climax. I won't tell here but the process & the acting excellence is what's important. On your dvd there may be a scene deleted from the theatrical release. It is the story of Laura's rise to prominence with the help of Waldo. This movie was played to many servicemen overseas & it was felt that scene might have been offensive. You decide, I didn't think so. There were some questions raised that in this war time movie there was not a hint of a war going on. Maybe why an able bodied guy like Lt.

A relatively simple mystery, the story moves along at an seeming incredible rate, and to actually slow it down would have detracted from its quality.  In fact, I shudder to think what a ""modern remake"" would do to an altogether wonderful movie!  The restoration of the film is magnificent, and especially for a classic black-and-white movie!

Gene Tierney never looked better than in her performance as the sophisticated and beautiful Laura, and Dana Andrews was at his best.  In fact, there is not an improvement I could recommend in the casting.  The story?  Elegant!  Who would have believed that the film's narrator was actually the murderer?

493270,5,630266232X,"I have to admit, I had never heard of ""Laura"" until finding it on the shelf at Virgin Megastore on sale for a mere $10.  Being one of those blindbuyers who'll pick up a movie if the back of the box sounds interesting, I picked it up.  After all, it was a film noir, and I had just started getting into the genre.  When I got home, I put the movie on my shelf and promptly forgot about it for a month.  After which, I picked it up, remembered why I bought it, and finally gave the disc a spin.

I was floored.

As a film noir, the movie is definitely a classic.  It's on the short side, clocking in at less than 90 minutes, but the movie packs such a punch that making it longer would only slow it down.  All the basic elements of film noir are utilized here, and are done in such a way that it makes the film relatable for any viewer.  Film noir, IMO, is an acquired taste, and some people may be turned off from its stylistic lighting and gritty moods.  ""Laura"" may not be the *best* film noir (that honor goes to Double Indemnity), but it's definitely the best one to start on if you're new to the genre.

Gene Tierney, with those EYES, is a gem and there's no questioning why Dana Andrews fell in love with her (in the movie, of course).  She's got such a subdued style of acting in here, and you almost wish the film was longer, if only to have more of Gene.  Her best role was her Oscar-nominated turn as Ellen Harland in Leave Her to Heaven (she lost to Joan Crawford as Mildred Pierce).  But of course, she'll be best remembered as Laura Hunt.

The DVD is wonderful, though there are a few minor gripes, which I'll get to in the end.

First, the video is perhaps better than it's ever been.  It's such a crisp and clear transfer, you'd hardly believe it came from 1944.

The audio, available in English Stereo, English Mono, and Spanish Mono.  There's also English closed-captions, and English and Spanish subtitles.  I'm not a big audio geek, so I can't tell if the audio's supposed to be good or bad, but it's pretty good here.  The score comes out very powerfully, as does the dialogue.

There are two commentaries.  The first, by Rudy Behlmer, is chock-ful of information on the production of the film.  But, like he warns, don't listen to it unless you've already seen the movie.  He talks about plot points that would spoil the story for first time viewers.

The second commentary is by Jeanine Basinger and the late David Raksin.  I found it harder to get into, but still is wonderful in relaying anecdotes and behind the scenes production tidbits.

A slightly-softer-in-video-quality deleted scene is available on its own (with or without Behlmer commentary, which starts rather abruptly) or can be integrated into the film as the ""Extended Version"".  Stick with the regular theatrical version, as the deleted scene was cut for a reason.  Just a note, though, that if you watch the ""Extended Version"", you can switch the audio tracks on the fly and access the commentaries, despite being told on the disc that they're only available on the theatrical version.

The theatrical trailer is as always a wonderful piece of marketing, and also shows just how bad the shape of the film was in before its restoration.  Oddly, despite other Fox Film Noir titles containing a trailer gallery of other movies in the line, Laura doesn't have the gallery.

Two episodes of A&E's Biography are given, one for Gene Tierney and one for Vincent Price.  Both are around the 44-minute mark, and are prety good bios, with film clips, interviews, and rare photos.  The Gene Tierney episode is worth more than one viewing, though I found the Vincent Price one to be rather...slow.

Now, what would have made this single-disc release better?  Just a few recommendations from me as to what they could have put on this disc:

-An audio track with the isolated music score.  Just a tidbit from the DVD, but the theme for Laura almost would have been Louis Armstrong's ""Sophisticated Lady""!

-A making-of featurette, it doesn't have to be long, just around the 20 or 30 minute mark.

-Movietone footage.  It's common on the Studio Classics release and some of the Film Noir titles.

-Stills Gallery.  Would have loved to seen more poster art beyond the DVD cover, along with production stills, and the ORIGINAL portrait of Laura (the one in the film is the second version, of an actual picture of Gene Tierney made to look like a painting)

-Restoration Comparison.  Like Movietone footage, this is common on Studio Classics, and seeing the shape the trailer was in, would have been interesting to see how well Fox did restoring this classic.

All in all, the film and disc are A+ efforts and HIGHLY recommended.",1146355200,18,4700,4.5669856459330145
493271,5,630266232X,"LAURA is perhaps Gene Tierney's most famous role -- though she is outstanding in all the noirs I've seen. This is a murder mystery told in the narrative of diminutive Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb). Flashbacks smoothly transition to responses from lead detective Lt. Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) finally blending into unnarrated current events.

Laura's rise to riches is attributed to the much older Lydecker's charm and influence which makes her indebted to him. Her beauty spurns jealousy as she becomes a focus of younger men's affections -- which promptly earns denigration in Lydecker's newspaper column. Laura's marriage engagement to Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price) is thwarted when a tryst with Mrs. Ann Treadwell (Judith Anderson) and a model named Diane Redfern is uncovered. As more details emerge, the list of suspects grows. Like prior men who have come to know her, McPherson is drawn to Laura's beauty -- well captured in a portrait hanging above her mantle. In this classic tale full of plot twists, detective McPherson must resolve both the murder and his cloaked desire for the object of men's affection that sparked the initial investigation.

DVD extras include lengthy biographies of Vincent Price and the true-life rise to riches of Gene Tierney. Unaware how prolific Tierney was, I was surprised to learn that aspects of some of her most popular noirs imitated her life.

5-STAR ENTERTAINMENT: #220 ON THE INTERNET MOVIE DATABASE'S BEST FILM LIST!

""Laura"" is the story of a beautiful young woman [Gene Tierney] whose story is told after her death. In showing us her life, through flashbacks, the gruff New York detective investigating her murder [Dana Andrews as Lt. Mark McPherson] falls in love with her portrait which is conspicuously mounted on the wall of the dead girl's apartment.

THERE'S MORE - MUCH MORE: [contains plot spoilers]

Detective Mark McPherson, [Dana Andrews] investigates the brutal murder, systematically interrogating the chief suspects: Dandy, waspish columnist, Waldo Lydecker [Clifton Webb]; roguish, socialite wannabe, Shelby Carpenter [Vincent Price]; and Carpenter's well-to-do sugar mama, Ann Treadwell [Judith Anderson]. But there is something not quite right about the whole case and it is starting to irritate McPherson.

FOR STARTERS ---

Everywhere McPherson goes on his investigation, Lydecker, Carpenter and sometimes even Ms. Treadwell are in tow! Boy, does this seem strange! Why do you suppose they are following McPherson around? And, boy, does everyone love Laura. How could anyone have possibly wanted to murder such a lovely creature?

THE COMMENTARY: THE BEST I KNOW OF!

There are 2 commentary tracks. Jeanine Basinger's covers the film and an in depth analysis of all the major plot elements and the scenes. David Raskin who's biggest claim to fame is writing the theme to ""Laura"" and the accompanying variations also has his comments spliced in-between Ms. Basinger's for a complimentary mix between the two contributors.

Rudy Behlmer's commentary covers the production, news, facts and figures, and some significant documented artifacts from Director Otto Preminger and the studio. Both commentary tracks were wonderfully interesting and worthwhile, unlike most.

IS IT A DREAM? --- THE PLOT THICKENS: [big plot spoiler below]

While McPherson is studying Laura's apartment, the crime scene, he dozes off in her easy chair. Then, as if he were having a dream about all those letters and diaries he'd been snooping through, the front door opened and in walked a woman. McPherson awakened to find, you guessed it, Laura standing in front of him, demanding an explaination for his presence. Is it a dream?

OK --- SO WHO'S THE DEAD LADY THAT HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED AS LAURA?

Why was she killed? Did the murderer who shot when the door opened think it was Laura, or did the killer know who answered the door? Where has Laura been for the past 3 days? Did Laura have anything to do with the murder?

---*- IN CLOSING

Laura features a wonderful plot, terrific acting by all (especially Clifton Webb), and crisp, literate dialogue to match the visually rich settings. This film's pace is uncharacteristically fast for this type of film, so hold on and pay close attention to the dialogue and details. Ok, NO more spoilers, you'll just have to see the film, and it is the best of its type that I have ever seen. What type? Film Noir, I am told. While I am not including any more plot spoilers, there is still plenty more plot and many surprises waiting for you when you see ""Laura"".

The original and mature script around a voluptuous and sidereal beauty of Laura will make that three men ( his initial mentor, cynical and hyper rational - Clifton Webb in a towering performance - the trivial and handsome pimp featured by Vincent Price and finally the detective Dana Andrews) established a film of such artistic level many times imitated and never equaled.

This historic film is not only one of the top ten films of the Forties but one of my eternal favorite films in any age as well one of the twenty best American films and one of the top ten Noir ever filmed.

493278,5,630266232X,"This is a classic example of perfect film noir, which, no doubt, helped the 40s and early 50s establish other movies in the same category. ""Laura"" ranks right up there with ""The Maltese Falcon"", ""Double Indemnity"" and ""The Woman In The Window"". The casting could not have be more impeccable, the sets, cinematography, and costumes more exquisite, and the music and direction more superb.

The story begins with the viciously cutting and sarcastic Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb, making his sound debut), recounting and recalling the late Laura Hunt (the enigmatically lovely Gene Tierney), and his relationship with her, as told to Lt. Mark McPherson (the darkly handsome Dana Andrews, perfect casting) the detective investigating what appears to be Laura's tragic murder. We see the heroine through Waldo's eyes at first, presenting her as he wants her to be seen. Her fianc'e, the weak but charming gigolo Shelby Carpenter (a young and very tall Vincent Price) and his benefactress, Laura's aunt, Ann Treadwell (Judith Anderson), are also interviewed and questioned by the increasingly infatuated policeman, who finds himself becoming obsessed with the victim, all the while trying to find the culprit. He all but moves into her beautifully decorated apartment, goes through her belongings and stares longingly at the painted portrait of her that hangs over the mantle. The scene where he rifles through the top drawer of her dresser leaves so much to the imagination. You can feel his loving desire for her in every expression that crosses his hardened but sensitive face. But, as true noir form, things are not always what they seem. Laura is in fact, alive, and the woman killed in her apartment is one of the models who worked for her advertising agency. The circumstances surrounding the crime and the vast array of possible suspects make it a perplexing puzzle for McPherson, who now has to deal with his growing love for the seemingly unobtainable ""dame"". He has to stop at nothing to discover the truth, while danger lurks in the shadows once again.

This movie is just a masterpiece of film-making, no questions asked. The score, by composer David Raksin, is as famous and haunting now as it was then. The ""Laura Theme"" can still be found on CD today. Otto Preminger, originally the film's producer, replaced director Rouben Mamoulian, in one of those wonderful circumstances that has often made entertainment. Supposedly, there are original sequences that were cut and unused, giving the film almost legendary status.

The sad fact that so many of these older movies have never been released on video or DVD, has underscored that Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney made a wonderful screen team - they appeared in ""Tobacco Road"", ""Belle Star"" (both 1941), were teamed as husband in wife in ""The Iron Curtain"" (1948), and were reunited with Preminger in the stylish film noir, ""Where The Sidewalk Ends"" (1950), which was finally released on DVD in December 2005. The three other films, sadly have never seen video release, as for DVD, that remains in question. Andrews, a shamefully underrated actor, is best remembered for this role, but he also gave memorable performances in ""The Ox-Bow Incident"" opposite Henry Fonda, ""Boomerang"", ""Beyond A Reasonable Doubt"", ""The Curse of the Demon"", ""The Purple Heart"", and the classic, ""The Best Years Of Our Lives"".

This film has recently been released on DVD, with a deleted scene, an extended version of the film, the theatrical trailer and two different commentaries. Enjoy the romantic suspense all over again! See if you can get the theme song out of your head!",1141171200,8,3612,5.055369127516778

The detective assigned to investigate the murder manages to fall in love with her just through her portrait. Even so, he does his best to investigate a really convoluted murder. He must contend with her fianc, played by Vincent Price in a non-horror role, and her professional mentor, a self important snob who wanted to be her fianc. It's a complicated investigation that becomes even more complicated when she turns up alive.

Somebody else has been murdered and the socialite becomes a suspect when she is less that forthcoming in the investigation. That puts the detective in a hard position because he still loves her but is committed to getting things right.

The primary suspect is changed more often than Elizabeth Taylor changes husbands but, in both cases, that helps to maintain interest. It's a nice, if old fashioned, murder mystery.

The story is excellent and very tight, but that's not what makes this film noir so special. Great dialogue, wonderful atmosphere, and the constant use of the haunting theme music do.

There were production problems galore with this movie, but none of them shows in the final product. A great, sophisticated murder mystery.",1136332800,3,1095,4.951086956521739
493305,4,630266232X,"Laura is a film about a girl named Laura (Gene Tierney) who was murdered in her home. There are several suspects that the police (Dana Andrews) need to investigate, most notably her close friend (Clifton Webb) and her fianc' (Vincent Price). Soon, it is discovered that she was not murdered at all and the search is on to find who was killed and by whom.

Laura is a film noir classic, loved by many fans of the genre. It features many elements of noir like narration, shady characters, and realistic locations and costumes. However, the femme fatal is quite different in this film than in any other. Laura is highly interesting, so much so that the audience seems to care more about her than about the murder mystery.

Gene Tierney could be the reason for this. She has a classic beauty, a beautiful face that is both exotic and welcoming. Even though she could have benefited from braces, she is absolutely gorgeous. She plays the role of Laura very well, naturally but memorably.

This DVD is filled with extra features including two commentaries, an alternate opening, a deleted scene, a trailer, and two documentaries, one for Tierney and one for Price. The documentaries along are worth the price of the disk; each are insightful looks into very different actors.",1136073600,4,1269,4.7853881278538815
493306,3,630266232X,"Laura can't compare as a film noir classic with Double Indemnity, Sunset Boulevard, The Maltese Falcon and others. The plot, the dialogue, the acting, the mystery are too artificial and contrived. Not a single scene, from the start in the bathtub to the kiss in the doorway, is in any way believable: the same might be said of the others I've mentioned, but they succeed in drawing the viewer into their stories, and make him care about the outcome. This does not happen here: it is impossible to identify emotionally with anything that happens, and the murder puzzle is routine, in the style of Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers and countless other detective mystery authors in the 30s and 40s. Nevertheless, Laura does have a certain fascination. Although none of the actors convince as living in their parts, they still seem interesting as highly contrasted personalities, with widely differentiated careers and backgrounds. What struck me throughout was that I was being presented with a life-style and a set of values which seem totally to have vanished. A recognizably real world of constant cigarettes and cocktails, over-furnished apartments, social free-loaders and polished snubs --- perhaps this still exists somewhere, it's just that I left it behind 5 decades ago. 1944 was well before the days of method, minimalism, psychedelia, kitchen-sink and trailer-trash. Class ruled, and manners held a meaning they no longer do. This brittle house of cards was bound for collapse.

The best thing about this disc is the section featuring the sympathetic biographies of Gene Tierney and Vincent Price. Both seemed to be, in very different yet oddly similar ways, rather fine and good people. One fortunate, the other unfortunate. These insights make the whole package well worth seeing, but the film on its own is, regretfully, not worth more than three stars.",1135987200,6,1863,5.148514851485149
493307,5,630266232X,"I picked up ""Laura"" for two reasons.  The first was because I'm a huge fan of ""Twin Peaks"", and I've heard that the film inspired it.  (After watching it, I can see that it did, in some ways)  The second was because the premise sounded very interesting to me.

Dana Andrews is terrific as Detective Mark McPherson, the calm policeman who is investigating the death of Laura Hunt (the wonderful Gene Tierney).  Laura was loved by everybody.  But in McPherson's book, everybody is a suspect - including Laura's fiance, Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price!); Laura's aunt (Judith Anderson), who may be involved with Shelby; and the cynical, bitter Waldo Lydecker (a great performance by Clifton Webb), who introduced Laura to the world.

Otto Preminger decided not to use any special camera angles or cinematic tricks like that, and it helps make the film seem all the more realistic.  The performances are top-notch and the script is well-written (the second draft was written by an uncredited Ring Lardner, Jr.), the latter of which features some fine twists.  There's also a now-classic score, which includes a magnificent theme song, by David Raksin.

If you're looking for an intriguing, well-made film noir, this may be the one for you.  ""Laura"" is a masterpiece of the film noir genre, and it may very likely be one of the best movies ever made.",1135641600,2,1345,4.881057268722467

Most of the scenes take place in apartment sets that look more appropriate to an Astaire film.  While Gene Tierney is truly beautiful to watch, she fails to convey much of a sense of a femme fatale. When you first see her acting in a Clifton Webb flashback, she is way too ""goody two shoes"" to support a noir film. Speaking of Webb, neither he nor Vincent Price is at all convincing as a man who might successfully compete for a beautiful woman's attention.  Frankly, both of them act more like caricatures of gay New Yorkers than as romantic leads. You might as well write a movie script that has Felix Unger as the prime suspect.",1135036800,11,785,4.553191489361702
493329,5,630266232X,"Wonderful story of a hard-boiled detective who falls in love with a painting, a dead woman who comes back to life and is immediately placed under suspicion of murder, and a haughty newspaper columnist slinging sarcastic from the sidelines.

 Otto Preminger's 1944 crime-thriller LAURA holds up remarkably well.  Gene Tierney is luminous as the title character (and she CAN act), Dana Andrews convincingly falls for a dead woman, and Clifton Webb threatens to steal the show as the brittle and acerbic newspaperman Waldo Lydecker.  Rounding out the major players are Vincent Price and Judith Anderson.  Oh, and the music includes the haunting `Laura,' by David Raksin, one of the most famous themes in film history.

 LAURA stands up well under repeated viewings.  In the course of a month or so I watched it three times.  First al dente, second with the Rudy Behlmer commentary, third with the David Raksin and Jeanine Basinger commentary.  I haven't watched LAURA for years, and my memory, helpfully enough, failed to retain any of the major plot points, so the big surprises were surprises again, although I have to admit the `falling in love with the painting' stuff was lost on me until pointed out in the commentaries.  The Behlmer track was filled with the historical back story behind the making of this picture, valuable and welcome, although not always pertinent to what was happening on screen at the time.  David Raskin wrote the score for LAURA, Jeanine Basinger is a film professor at Wesleyen University.  Raskin died recently, in 2004, at the age of 92.  Raskin's contributions on the track are pretty slight, perhaps he was in declining health when it was recorded, and it seems likely Basinger is on the same track to fill in the long silences.  They don't sound like they're conversing, and Basinger doesn't add a lot of information that we don't already get from Behlmer's track.

 Anyway, it's another feature on a feature packed dvd.  Two episodes of A&E's Biography series are included.  The first is titled `Gene Tierney - A Shattered Portrait.'  If you don't know much about Tierney's life, and I didn't, this is a bit of an eye-opener.  The strong impression is of a graced life beset by tragedy and tragedy-induced mental instability.  Among the talking heads in this 1999 production are Richard Widmark and first husband Oleg Cassini.  A much happier life is the subject of the second feature, the 2000 `Vincent Price - The Versatile Villain.'  Roger Corman, Dennis Hopper and others fondly remember the actor who bore the `irresistible air of wickedness.'  On its own LAURA is first-rate.  The extras don't add anything to its luster, but they make for a bountiful feast.",1133049600,12,2699,4.942222222222222

Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) is put in charge of the murder of Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney). He interviews the two men who knew her best: smarmy critic Waldo Lydecker (a perfectly creepy Clifton Webb) and her mysterious fiance Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price). As the case takes on many twists and turns, Mcpherson has become obsessed with Laura. He can't get her off his mind. But the biggest twist is yet to come - Laura is alive. As Laura and Mark attempt to get to the bottom of the case, a shocking climax draws closer to them.

This film is perfect. Gene Tierney is stunning as Laura. Her icy sexuality and acting skills are perfect for this role. Dana Andrews is splendid as McPherson. Clifton Webb and Vincent Price offer ample support as well.

The interaction between the characters, the dialog, the mind games, the plot twists, the costumes, the sets - I found this movie held my attention just about every minute.

493336,4,630266232X,"Otto Preminger's film noir ""Laura"" is a taut, stylish murder mystery featuring a talented and well directed cast.

Hard boiled police detective Lt. Mark McPherson played by a tough talking Dana Andrews is investigating the brutal shotgun murder of Laura Hunt.  Hunt, a socialite and high powered advertising executive is played by a glamorous and confident Gene Tierney.  The film commences with Andrews interviewing the unquestioned star of the show, Clifton Webb, playing the celebrated yet cantakerous and acerbic critic Waldo Lydecker. Lydecker through his influence and contacts has elevated Laura from the stenography pool up the ranks in both her industry and society.  He was deeply in love with her and insanely jealous.

Lydecker felt threatened when playboy Shelby Carpenter played by an oily Vincent Price moved in on Laura using his smooth Southern charm.  They soon announced their engagement to marry which was short circuited by her death.

Andrews spending time in the murdered girl's apartment looking for clues finds himself becoming enamored with Tierney's portrait.  The plot takes an unexpected twist when Laura returns home after being away in the country to contemplate her potential betrothal and confronts Andrews.  Evidently someone else had been murdered but who and by whom?

The major flaw in this otherwise memorable flick was the very obvious identity of the murderer.  The musical score was an excellent enhancement to the haunting mood of the movie.  Judith Anderson playing Ann Treadwell, a middle aged society woman in love with and bankrolling the seamy Price also was very good in her supporting role.",1127260800,3,1639,5.285714285714286
493337,5,630266232X,"There are greater film noirs than ""Laura""--""Double Indemnity"" and ""Out of the Past"" immediately come to mind--but its sheer, silky elegance and insinuating malevolence, backed by David Raksin's hauntng theme music, cast a spell over viewers that is rare in any film genre. Otto Preminger never again matched his achievement here, as he tells Vera Caspary's tale of wealthy, decadent New Yorkers suspected of murdering a beautiful young socialite. There are so many glorious things about this movie that it's hard to enumerate them all in a capsule review, but surely one must start with the actors. Gene Tierney, her heartbreaking beauty matched by her air of innocent, straightforward gentility, achieved screen immortality with this one role, and deserved to. Dana Andrews, as the tough, wily police detective who falls for her, finds just the right blend of cynicism and moral clarity, all the better to outfox the hothouse egoism of the suspects. As Tierney's aunt and fiance, Judith Anderson and Vincent Price are a match made in Hell--charming, weak, and utterly treacherous. But the standout is Clifton Webb, lean and sharp as a rapier, making his film debut at 55 after a lifetime on the Broadway stage. As the acidulous radio personality Waldo Lydecker (think Alexander Woollcott meets Captain Hook), Webb pours venom into every scene he's in and makes us lap it up. (A sample line: ""I should be sincerely sorry if my neighbors' children were devoured by wolves."") The wolves in ""Laura"" are not in sheep's clothing, but in evening dress, and to watch Andrews outsmart them is cinematic pleasure of a very high order indeed. The print on the current DVD release is quite good, and the extras include two interesting ""A&E Biography"" episodes: one about the sad life of Gene Tierney, blighted by mental illness and family tragedy, and one about the considerably happier, healthier life of Vincent Price, a bon vivant in the best sense of the term.",1126828800,5,1953,5.030864197530864

493358,5,630266232X,"""Laura"" is a very famous production from 1944 and the first film directed by Otto Preminger at 20th Century Fox in the forties. Preminger was originally the producer of the film but when director Rouben Mamoulian was sacked, he took over.

The plot investigates the murder of Laura Hunt, a successful young advertising executive played by the stunning Gene Tierney. Dana Andrews plays the moody cop who investigates the murder. He plays in taciturn style which is quite convincing. He falls in love with the image of Laura as depicted in a painting of her in her apartment and the scene in which he awakes to her return is justly famous. Clifton Webb plays Laura's possessive ""sponsor"", Judith Anderson plays her aunt and Vincent Price plays her fiance. All of them are venal. Neither Webb nor Price are very convincing suitors of Laura because their manners and dialogue are bitchy and camp. The contrast to the masculine Andrews is obvious.

As a ""whodunnit"", the film is not entirely successful because it is not very hard to guess the murderer, particularly if you view the Preview available on the DVD. However, you keep going back to savour the witty dialogue, the haunting score, Gene Tierney's beauty and the acting of Judith Anderson and Clifton Webb in particular. Each viewing reveals more undercurrents of decadence. The script is tight and the photography and sets emphasise the claustrophobic world you enter. Otto Preminger never did as well again. To classify the film as Film Noir, though, is misleading. This is a classy thriller about a group of self indulgent, self absorbed and unlikeable characters.

Clifton Webb made his film debut here and the film catapulted him to stardom, although he became typecast as the effeminate dilettante. The film also shot Tierney to superstardom not so much because of any originality in performance but because her beauty perfectly captured the mysterious dreamlike quality of the character. David Raskin's haunting theme song, with lyrics added later, perpetuated the aura.

The DVD contains a perfect print. The 2 episodes of Biography included about Tierney and Price are excellent and the addition of a deleted scene is worth viewing simply because Tierney's beauty is breathtaking. Also included are 2 commentaries which manage not to overlap and provide enormous detail about every aspect of the film and its evolution. Rudy Behlmer's information, in particular, is beautifully paced and delivered. Janine Basinger often states the obvious concerning the characters' reactions and motivation. Certainly, though, the listener could not ask for my information about how the film evolved.

Gene Tierney is not only alluringly beautiful as Laura but captivatingly mysterious.  Clifton Webb gives one of the all-time great supporting turns as the acerbic gossip columnist Waldo Lydecker.  Vincent Price is effectively sleazy as Shelby Carpenter, Laura's layabout fiancee.  Judith Anderson is excellent as a society matron who Carpenter sponges off of.

493361,5,630266232X,"What can I say that the other 96 reviewers haven't already said?  This is truly one of my favorite movies - and I am not exaggerating.  It's a film that still manages to engage me despite repeated viewings and some fairly obvious narrative flaws.  Its primary strength lies in how well the actors work together.  This holds true even though Laura is first seen only in flashback.

The more we learn about Laura, the more we want to know.  Was she really only focused on her career?  What happened to the young, idealistic girl who shyly approached Waldo Lydecker to ask for an endorsement?  Why was she going to marry Shelby, given all she had learned?  Did she have a heart or was she purely an ice queen?

Clifton Webb gets the clever lines and starts the story off with his voice over and extended flashback.  The net effect is a dreamland where Webb spins a rhapsodic vision of murdered socialite.  Yet it is Dana Andrews who brings Webb, and the viewers, back to earth.  His character is not so much cynical as business-like, reminding us graphically of how the woman was murdered and how unglamorous such murders are.  Andrews convincingly displays the internal conflict gnawing at McPherson as the investigation progresses.

Gene Tierney, Vincent Price, and Judith Anderson also deliver strong performances.  Tierney portrays Laura as an independent and aloof woman who betrays emotion only when she's cornered.  Price slides easily into the role of the charmed Shelby Carpenter, while Anderson evokes a desparation only thinly cloaked in poise and venom.

Those fans of the TV series ""Twin Peaks"" will recognize several elements from ""Laura"" incorporated into the that series' original story line.  This is no accident; apparently David Lynch admires ""Laura"" that much.",1125100800,4,1777,4.96271186440678
493362,4,630266232X,"This review is for the 2005 Twentieth Century Fox DVD.

The movie opens in a major urban city, presumably New York, where a young and beautiful socialite named Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) has been murdered.  The investigating police officer, Lt. Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews), has to interview and interrogate all of Laura's close friends including her fianc Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price) and a possessive and controlling, rich, old snob named Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb) to find out who committed this egregious act.  From there we find out a lot about Laura with a major twist along the way.

The film comes off more as a theater drama set for the stage rather than a movie since it is saturated with sophisticated and witty dialogue.  Almost all of the scenes take place in ornately decorated indoor settings. The music score enhances the movie greatly, as different arrangements of the ""Laura"" theme play throughout the entire picture. If you enjoy quality acting, you should greatly appreciate this film, but if you are hoping for lots of action and thrills, you will probably be disappointed.  My only problem with the film are the Waldo Lydecker and Shelby Carpenter characters.  Both came across as emasculated sissies, therefore making them annoying and unsympathetic characters lacking masculine credibility as men pursuing a beautiful woman.

Although the most framiliar of themes that crop up in Laura crop up in most film noir's (murder, homicide detective, wanting a girl who's untouchable and so on) Laura seems to handle them with more class and elegence.

Laura is a great whodunit from start to finish, leaving the audience guessing right up to the very end.

Gene Tierny is radiant, as always, Dana Andrews, is perfect as a hardheaded gumshoe detective, really the only brutish character in the film and Vincent Price actually plays a halfway decent, normal character for once. Which is nice.

Laura, like many film noirs of the time, is a very 'talky' movie. With nearly every scene entangled in conversation.

Fox Film Noir has done a magnificent job of transferring the film to DVD with the picture looking beautiful. If you're interested in comparing the original print with the new transfer, watch the trailer included in the special features on the disc and compare the picture quality to the actual film. The difference is not hard to see.

Another great thing about this DVD is the inclusion of a deleted scene, which you can choose to watch in the actual film by selecting the extended version in the features menu.

The scene was considered too controversal at the time of the movie's release (1944), and was cut to avoid a backlash. Although today the scene holds nothing that would offend anyone.

Finally, two A&E Biography's are included on the disc, one on Gene Tierny and one on Vincent Price, which, like all A&E Biography's are great for anyone interested in either actor.

Although not as good as the Criterion Collection releases, Fox Film has done an amazing job with this and their five other Noir releases, with transfers and features. However, the Fox Film Noir releases are only ten bucks, give or take and Criterion releases go for at least 40-50 bucks a pop.

From the stark, stylized  chiaroscuro cinematography, which won it an Academy Award in 1944,  to its stellar performances, deft direction, and  intelligent screenplay, it is simply a marvelous film. It was adapted from the novel of the same name by Vera Caspary. To add icing to the cake, there is a haunting musical score that will stay with the viewer long after the final credits have scrolled away.

This classic, old-fashioned  murder mystery features a stunning Gene Tierney in the title role and old time favorite Dana Andrews as Detective Lt. Mark McPherson, the hardboiled, virile gumshoe who finds himself smitten the minute he sees the portrait of Laura Hunt at the scene of the crime. He is determined to bring the murderer of this lovely young woman to justice. As have all the men in Laura's life, McPherson, too, becomes obsessed with her.

When a major, mind-boggling twist in the plot casts a new light on the evidence,  McPherson goes full speed ahead, as new developments point the finger of suspicion from the least likely to the most likely suspect. Could it be Laura's jealous aunt, Ann Treadwell (Dame Judith Anderson), who seems to be hot to trot with Laura's fiance, Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), despite the differences in their respective ages? Could it be Laura's playboy fiance? After all, he has a shady past and a penchant for money and other women, especially those who could keep him in the style to which he would like to become accustomed. Could it even be Laura's long time friend, mentor,  and spurned would be suitor, the acerbic writer and self-styled cynic,  Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb)?

Gene Tierney gives a luminous performance as Laura Hunt, the beautiful, intelligent, independent businesswoman who is somewhat of a cipher. She is someone to whom men are drawn, often obsessively so. Dana Andrews is perfect in the role of Detective McPherson. His no nonsense, street smart, hunky detective is a great counterpoint and foil to the more effete and prissy Waldo Lydecker. Clifton Webb is positively brilliant in the role of Waldo Lydecker and steals the show from under the noses of his co-stars. This is no mean feat given the enormous talent of the film's stellar cast. Webb's droll, spot on delivery of the wonderful lines that he was given are memorable.

Vincent Price is excellent in the role of Shelby Carpenter, Laura's Callow fiance and erstwhile gigolo. At first, however, he took a little getting used to, as I was used to seeing Vincent Price in roles associated with gothic horror. Still, he acquits himself admirably. Dame Judith Anderson is memorable in the small role of Laura's desperate aunt, Ann Treadwell,  who knows what she wants and will pay whatever price is necessary to get it. Of course, Otto Preminger deserves kudos for his deft direction, as does Samuel Hoffenstein for writing a screenplay infused with such great dialogue. Kudos also go to David Raskin, as his memorable score will forever be loved and remembered by those who enjoy this film.

As for the DVD, since I paid what seemed to be a rock bottom price for it, I assumed that it would be problematic in terms of quality. Instead, I got a wonderful DVD with an excellent print transfer, as both the visuals and the audio were clear and of good quality. The DVD is also loaded with extras that are unheard of in a DVD of this price. There are two worthwhile commentaries provided. There are also two versions of  the film to view. One is an extended version that contains an alternate opening scene. The DVD also contains two great A & E  biographies. One is of Gene Tierney, and  that other is of Vincent Price. Both will be of interest to all film buffs. This DVD has got to be one of the best values to be found on Amazon, and the film is certainly one that is worthy of a place in one's personal film collection.",1123286400,4,3897,4.734121122599705

493414,5,630266232X,"They don't make them like this any more, the old saying goes, and, in fact, they don't: a truly adult film without any overt sex (though with lots of intimations of it) and just a tiny tad of onscreen violence (but lots offstage-- and violent emotions throughout).  What makes it adult is that it deals with adult situations directly, without being coy or juvenile or sentimental. It is blessed with an utterly intelligent screenplay, from Vera Caspary's bestselling novel; and truly inspired casting: for example, the director had to fight with the studio and threatened to quit if he couldn't cast Clifton Webb as the narcissistic columnist Waldo Lydecker-- and Webb's bravura and perfectly modulated performance fully justified his faith in him.  Dana Andrews as Detective Mark McPherson brings complexity, wryness, and decided shadows to what is usually a pasteboard Noir role.  Gene Tierney is wonderful as the title character, whose beauty as evidenced in her portrait, and whose intelligence, and poise, as communicated in Waldo's rhapsodic description of her, have McPherson falling in love with her, even though he knows she's dead (the long, dialogless scene where he rummages through her boudoir drawers, and closet, fondling her clothes, smelling her perfume, is just one example among many why some critics have called this one of the kinkiest movies to come out of Hollywood in its heyday).  Equally inspired is the casting of the other two major roles, the great Judith Anderson as Laura's aunt, Ann Treadwell, who is not-so-secretly in love with Laura's fiance, impecunious Southern playboy Shelby Carpenter, played wonderfully by Vincent Price.  The five leads are all perfect,  with Webb shining perhaps brightest of all: he delivers his lines with an acid relish that cuts like a jigsaw.  ""I'm not kind, I'm vicious: it's the secret of my charm."" -- ""I don't write with a pen-- I write with a goosequill dipped in venom."" ""If you stand a little closer, my boy, I can just crack your skull with my stick""-- Early in the film, he tells McPherson that Laura thought him to be the kindest, gentlest, most sympathetic man in the world. ""You won't understand this, McPherson, but for her, I tried to BECOME the kindest, gentlest, most sympathetic man in the world."" ""Have any luck?"" McPherson asks with equal acidity. Waldo pauses reflectively. ""Let me put it to you this way: I should be sincerely sorry to see my neighbor's children devoured by wolves,"" he replies in the driest of tones. Yet another great exchange occurs between Laura & Ann.  At her ""welcome home"" party, Laura is profoundly shaken to learn Shelby (as well as some others of her friends) thinks she herself is guilty (since the actual victim was a model with whom Laura knew Shelby was having an affair), and flees to the powder room, where she meets her aunt.  Ann is still smarting from Shelby's callous rejection of her, and tells Laura that McPherson is ""better for you than Shelby.  Anybody is. Shelby's better for me."" ""Why?"" asks Laura. ""Because... he's not a nice person, and neither am I.... No, I don't think he did it, but he's capable of it. I know. He's like me."" Laura, shocked, looks at her aunt, still imperturbably fixing her hat, who then delivers an amazing final comment: ""No, my dear, I didn't-- "" she looks straight at Laura-- ""but I've thought of it."" And she exits without another word, leaving a stunned Laura: since the murderer was really aiming for Laura, her aunt just admitted to thinking of killing HER! Whoa! You don't get scenes of that caliber nowadays!  The film is filled with many of such great moments.  A must for any collector of mysteries, films noir, or just plain Classics-- one that bears repeated viewings.  Get it!",1118966400,3,3744,4.886435331230284
493426,5,630266232X,"All film buffs should see Otto Preminger's ""Laura"" at least once. This complex, moody drama features the absolutely gorgeous Gene Tierney in the title role. The epitome of noir, many of the movie's scenes actually do take place on the proverbial dark and rainy night. ""Laura"" is much more than a murder mystery, however. It is also a psychological study of a controlled, analytical man who becomes obsessed with a dead woman. The superb acting, especially Clifton Webb's brilliant performance, fascinating characters, witty dialogue, Joseph LaShelle's Oscar-winning high contrast black and white cinematography, creative direction and taut storyline, make this an all time classic.

Wealthy, beautiful New York socialite Laura Hunt is brutally murdered, killed in her own apartment by a shotgun blast aimed directly at her head. Hard boiled, street savvy Police Lieutenant Mark McPherson, (Dana Andrews), investigates the crime. (cool trench coat, too!). The more he learns about the deceased woman, and the longer he stares at her portrait, the more obsessed with her he becomes. Laura's story is told through flashbacks.

The lovely lady had two main men in her life, whose effete, mean-spirited characters have always made me wonder about her lack of good taste. Waldo Lydecker (played masterfully by Clifton Webb), is a shallow, conceited, hypocritical intellectual snob, whose acid wit is a film highlight. He had a dinner date with Laura on the night she died, but she canceled. Lydecker, the young woman's mentor, had helped further her career tremendously and acted as her advisor on many occasions. He believes he was indispensable to Laura, who, unfortunately for him, fell in love with Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price). Carpenter is a real philanderer, who is adverse to work of any kind, and readily admits it. The young woman's aunt, Ann Treadwell, (Judith Anderson), is yet another nasty neurotic, in love with Carpenter, and riddled with jealousy of her niece. The three are all suspects, but as McPherson says, in the line parodied by Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau, ""I suspect everybody and nobody."" When the no nonsense detective first spoke these words, however, there was no cause for laughter.

I don't want to go into too much detail and spoil this great film for those who have yet to see it. Let it suffice to say that there are many surprising plot twists and turns, passion, blackmail, lots of suspense and superior performances here. And of course, the haunting song ""Laura,"" a memorable piece by David Raksin is the theme.

DVD extras include excellent biographies of Tierney and Price, two audio commentaries featuring film scholars, and a deleted scene. My highest recommendations!

493427,4,630266232X,"Laura (1944) is an example of film noir at its most ambivalent. The movie tracks the progress of Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) as he investigates the brutal shooting of a beautiful young woman named Laura. Like the earlier 1940 film Rebecca, the plot hinges on the force of an absent presence, but in this example Laura actually appears on screen in flashbacks.

The first tale is narrated by her friend and probable lover Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), a writer and columnist who embodies everything good and true in his print, but everything petty, selfish, and witty in his personal life. McPherson also runs into Laura's fianc, Shelby Carpenter (played by a disconcertingly young and hulking Vincent Price), a velvet-tongued layabout whose attentions to Laura are teasing and shallow. In a typical noir twist, Shelby is involved with Laura's aunt, Ann Treadwell (Judith Anderson).

The film plays off a number of recurrent motifs - the ticking clock, a toy baseball game that McPherson fiddles with incessantly, a painting of Laura above the mantelpiece, men in trilby hats who flit in and out of the darkness. McPherson makes a point of never looking his suspects in the eye until a dramatic encounter in the police station with a bright white light, a desperate accusation, and a cold reply. Stylistically, however, the film's shadows are not quite as sharp as those in noir movies like Mildred Pierce.

Its real strength comes in the shifting sands of character analysis. Those who knew Laura build her up to be a saint, and McPherson falls hopelessly in love with her story. But Laura can have a harsh, bleached profile. Gene Tierney's nuanced (or brilliantly blank) performance makes Laura a cipher for those around her, taking on personalities as quickly as she dons a hat. The suspects may be shiftless, but so too is the victim. Refreshingly, many of the proposed murderers make no bones of hiding their true natures - as the aging aunt Anderson has a particularly strong moment when she explains to Laura why she should get Shelby. ""I'm not a nice person,"" she states bluntly, ""and neither is he.""

Although Andrews is too soft to play a tough guy to equal Humphrey Bogart (Andrews was more persuasive as the low-level Lothario in State Fair), the film works well, warping generic features of film noir to create an unfamiliar face. It succeeds in imprinting an image of a horrific murder, even as it constantly keeps the beauty of Laura before us. The surprising events that occur in the middle of the film, when the narrative suddenly veers into new noir territory, I will leave for viewers to experience.",1117497600,7,2630,4.903370786516854
493428,5,630266232X,"Master film director Otto Preminger directed this tale of murder, intrigue and passion.

Police Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) investigates the murder of a  beautiful woman and becomes obsessed with her portrait. The woman, Laura Hunt, is played superbly the actress Gene Tierney. The story unfolds through a series of  voice-overs and replays of her past with the men and women in her life. Her career as a high fashion artist begins with a snub from the very uptight and snobbish Waldo Lydecker, a society newspaper columnist. The Lydecker character is played to the hilt by Clifton Webb. Webb brings his comedic nose-in-the-air Mr. Belvedere character to Waldo Lydecker, except here he is not just a witty snob, he is obnoxious and controlling. His wit is mean spirited.

After a faulty start, Lydecker becomes Laura's mentor and eventually falls in love with her. Under Lydecker's wing Laura Hunt goes to the right parties and meets the right people. Along the way she meets Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price) who is involved with wealthy Ann Treadwell (Judith Anderson) but also has his eye on Laura. Laura now tired of being under the watchful eye of Waldo Lydecker befriends Carpenter. She is aware that he is a has no money of his own and is gigolo but he is elegant and charming. She enjoys his company.

So who killed Laura?  Was it Ann Treadwell in a fit of jealousy? Was it Waldo Lydecker, the man who brought her to where she is now or was it Shelby Carpenter because she spurned his advances? It's up to Lt. Mark McPherson to find out. This may be one of Dana Andrews finest performances as the love stricken cop trying to get to the truth, while trying also to get past Laura's lovely face in the portrait hanging on her living room wall.

This is top notch Preminger and noir at its best. This is a lighter noir the only darkness here is the obsessive behaviors of the characters. Much of the mood of this film comes from its music that flows through the film. Johnny Mercer was brought in to write the words to David Raskin's haunting melody. It was his job to write the words that would fit the music and the theme of the movie. The result is a perfect match of music, lyrics and film. Lt. Mcpherson stares at the portrait of Laura, a woman he has never met - [lyrics] Laura is the face in the misty light, Footsteps that you hear down the hall, The laugh that floats on a summer night That you can never quite recall. And you see Laura on the train that is passing through, Those eyes, how familiar they seem; She gave your very first kiss to you, that was Laura but she's only a dream. [end lyrics].

493431,5,630266232X,"Released in 1944 to great popular and critical success, ""Laura"" was nominated for 4 Academy Awards, won for Best Cinematography, and solidified Gene Tierney's status as one of Hollywood's great stars of the 1940s. Based on the novel by Vera Caspary, ""Laura"" is a murder mystery revolving around the love of several men for its title character, the beautiful, enigmatic Laura. The film is often, though debatably, considered film noir due to its cynical characterizations and narrative structure, although it is not especially pessimistic and lacks the distinctive visual style of many classic film noirs.

We are introduced to the mystery by Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), a wealthy middle-aged columnist known for his acerbic wit. Laura was his protg and, in his view, his creation to whom he was devoted and from whom he expected the same. Waldo has just learned of Laura's murder, and police Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) has come to interview him. Det. McPherson and Lydecker then visit Laura's Aunt, Mrs. Anne Treadwell (Judith Anderson), who happens to be very close to Laura's dandyish fianc, Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price). All of these people had motive to murder Laura, and all seem very capable of it. McPherson appears stoic and disinterested in anything but business, often to the consternation of his suspects. But as he reads Laura's private diary and correspondence and stares at the portrait in her apartment, McPherson becomes enchanted with her memory, perhaps in love with it. And then his investigation takes an unexpected twist.

Much of the credit for elevating ""Laura"" from a clever murder mystery to a great and memorable film goes to the sharp, evocative dialogue. The three murder suspects  -Lydecker, Shelby, and Ann- are shamelessly selfish, but remarkably conscious of their own characters. Lydecker says, ""I'm not kind; I'm vicious. It's the secret of my charm"" and declares, ""In my case, self-absorption is completely justified."" Shelby describes himself: ""I don't know a lot about anything, but I know a little about practically everything."" ""I can afford a blemish on my character, but not on my clothes."" Lines like those could sound campy, but these great actors deliver them flawlessly. They entertain the audience with clever banter while providing complex motivations behind each man's relationship with Laura. Dana Andrews impresses as a man who seems incapable of loving a real person, but who is infatuated with a ghost. Like the others, he evokes a intriguing mixture of sympathy and revulsion. In an interesting role reversal, Laura has concentrated her energies on her career, while her suitors are preoccupied with their lifestyles. Between Gene Tierney's star power, Otto Preminger's direction, Samuel Hoffenstein's script, fabulous supporting performances, and David Raskin's score -which produced a hit song, ""Laura"" is as captivating today as it was in 1944.

The DVD (20th Century Fox 2005 release): This is a quality print of the film, and the disc is loaded with features: 2 biographical documentaries, 2 audio commentaries, 1 deleted scene, a theatrical trailer, and the option to watch the film with a deleted sequence of Laura's transformation into a stylish society woman in tact. The 2 documentaries are ""A&E Biographies"". ""Gene Tierney: A Shattered Portrait"" (45 minutes) includes interviews with Tierney's ex-husband Oleg Cassini, sister Pat Byrne, and daughter Christina Cassini, among others. It follows Tierney's life from her birth in Brooklyn in 1920, to her success as one of the most popular actresses of the 1940s, through her marriage to designer Oleg Cassini and her struggles with mental illness in the 1950s, her retirement from acting and remarriage in the 1960s, until the end of her life in 1991 at the age of 70. ""Vincent Price: The Versatile Villain"" (45 minutes) discusses Price's nearly 60-year acting career, which included 100 films and nearly 2000 television appearances, and his avocation as a collector and promoter of fine arts. It traces his life from his birth in St. Louis in 1911, through his varied Hollywood career before turning to horror films, his final films and plays in the 1980s, to his death in 1993 at the age of 82. Includes interviews with Price's biographer Lucy Chase Williams, daughter Victoria Price, actress Jane Russell, among others.

The two audio commentaries are both good. The first is by film professor Jeanine Basinger and composer David Raskin, who composed ""Laura""'s score. These were apparently recorded separately, but on the same track. Basinger provides scene-by-scene analysis and commentary on the actors, characters, dialogue, directing decisions, and technique. Raskin comments on the score, but  unfortunately we rarely hear the music on the commentary track. The second commentary is by film historian and author Rudy Behlmer. He discusses the evolution of Vera Caspary's novel, would-be play, and this film in detail, based on information from drafts of the script, interviews he conducted with the principle creative persons, personal correspondence, and studio memos. He starts with Vera Caspari's idea for a story in 1939 and goes from there, eventually discussing the details of the film project. This commentary doesn't correspond to the scene we are looking at, but it is packed with interesting and probably hard-won information. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish. Dubbing is available in French.",1113177600,32,5469,5.2949308755760365
493432,5,630266232X,"The opening credits of Laura are superimposed over a painting of Laura, which displays her alluring beauty--beauty many men desire, but never conquer.  It also offers a more ominous thought of jealousy, as many could do something very stupid during a moment of intense jealousy.  This is followed by a statement by infamous writer Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), ""I should never forget the weekend Laura died...and I, Waldo Lydecker, was the only one who really knew her and I had just begun to write her story when...""  This statement is accompanied a low lonely flute and string music that augments the foreboding atmosphere in the film, and it carries a promise of further threats and suspense.

Death has come to a young successful woman who has climbed the social ladder of success in a rapid manner.  This young woman was Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) who someone shot in the face with a shotgun.  The murder brings the audience into a dark and sinister atmosphere, much in the spirit of true film noir, as all the main characters are also suspects to the grisly murder of this once stunning woman.  Even the police cannot evade the audience's suspicions as the investigation unfolds.  However, only one thing is certain, someone pulled the trigger of the shotgun that departed the late Laura Hunt from this world.

Briefly after Mr. Lydecker's initial statement to the audience the investigation begins and he is interviewed again by the police, as Mr. Lydecker volunteers to follow Detective Lieutenant Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews).  The film quickly moves to introduce the audience to other suspects, Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price) and Mrs. Ann Treadwell (Judith Anderson).  Mr. Carpenter was suppose to marry Laura the following week while Mrs. Treadwell used be Mr. Carpenter's personal benefactor and much likely more, which is revealed through the information that is provided.  Despite the introduction of these suspects the audience cannot eliminate the possibility of someone else being the murderer.

In the true spirit of film noir Laura continues to haunt the audience, as the murder turns into a study of the upper-class.  These characters display the bad side of humanity, where greed, jealousy, vanity and more begin to create strong undercurrents that pull the story in different directions.  This diverging effect keeps the audience focused on the story, as it helps generate more suspense through the viewer's oblivious notion of who the murderer could be.  All characters have skeletons in their closet, which furthers the confusion of the identity of the killer.  To top the whole thing off the director Otto Preminger throws an unexpected curveball that will make the audience more intrigued by the story.

Laura brings the audience an excellent film noir, which keeps the audience guessing until the identity of the killer is obvious.  A great deal of the film's success could be added to the cast's wonderful performance that enhances the apprehensive atmosphere, but it also rests within the mise-en-scene, music, and direction of the film.  The atmosphere is crucial for the film, and Preminger generates this cinematic milieu from the beginning, and it does not let go until the audience has left the darkness of cinematic experience, which leaves the audience with some thoughts to ponder.",1113091200,13,3321,5.137546468401487

When Otto Preminger was told to take over this project from  wunderkind Rouben Mamoulian, it was reportedly a mess. How much was already in the can has always been in dispute, some still maintaining to this day that the famous opening shots are director Mamoulian's work. David Raksin's famous score, however, so beautiful and haunting that it set the tone for the entire film, had not yet been written. Preminger told Raksin to take the weekend and come up with something or he would use Duke Ellington's ""Sophisticated Lady"" instead.

Raksin's marriage was falling apart at the time, and over the weekend he wrote the theme from Laura as much for his wife as for the film. Sadly, it did not save his marriage. It did, however, change forever this film. Raksin's score was so haunting and beautiful that Preminger hung the entire picture on it. Decades later, both this film and Raksin's lovely score are regarded as two of the best to ever come out of Hollywood.

Dana Andrews had his greatest role as Detective Mark McPherson, assigned the murder of society girl Laura Hunt due to office politics. Wlado Lydecker is also the role Clifton Webb will be remembered for. He is perfect as the deceased Laura's vain and famous benefactor. He uses his wit and intellect to destroy all of Laura's suitors in his weekly column, as we see in flashbacks told to McPherson by Lydecker himself during the investigation.

Vincent Price had his best non-horror role as Shelby Carpenter, the one man Waldo could not drive away. Laura was to have been married to Carpenter, a heel with perfect manners. The more McPherson learns about Laura the more he wonders why such a sweet and down to earth girl ended up a society page murder mystery. She liked baseball and shares a favorite book with McPherson. Her portrait, painted by one of the suitors Lydecker destroyed in his column, hangs ominously above the chair where Mark McPherson reads her diary, searching for clues that will help him unravel the mystery of both her life, and her violent death.

Laura's fiercely loyal maid, Bessie, protects Laura's reputation at every turn. McPherson is sympathetic and wants to protect her reputation also, as he has fallen for a ghost. David Raksin's haunting score sets the atmosphere to every film buff's favorite mystery romance. Halfway through this film, on a rainy night in Laura's apartment, the entire case will be turned upside down in one of the most famous twists in screen history.

This film was adapted from the terrific Vera Caspary novel of 1943 and is a literary classic as well. Both the novel and the film are timeless treasures to be cherished.

An impeccable cast - Gene Tierney at her loveliest and Clifton Webb at his urbane best (never mind the notion that his character Waldo Lydecker couldn't possibly be romantically interested in a woman - the film is so good that most viewers will overlook it) and Dana Andrews perfect as your typical film noir detective.

In addition to the cast, ""Laura"" is so wonderful to look at. The set decoration and cinematography were both deservedly nominated for Academy Awards (cinematographer Joseph LaShelle was the film's only Oscar winner). The ""look"" of the film expertly conveys a mood of coziness, despite the subject matter, even in the exterior scenes with rain and snow. The interior decoration is sumptuous (both Laura and Waldo's apartments provide glorious eye candy). Ditto for the costumes with the exception of Tierney's bizarre head-gear.

Two commentaries are provided. The first, by film archivist Jeanine Basinger (of Wesleyan University, which houses the Gene Tierney papers) and composer David Raskin, is generally informative although it is apparent that both commentators were not in the same room when the recording was made. Basinger covers basic details about the film as well as brief biographies of the actors. Raskin's comments concern his famous score for the film. The second commentary is by film historian Rudy Behlmer. Although a bit dry, he is very thorough on the film's history, beginning with the novel that the film was based on (he interviewed Vera Caspary in the 70s) and provides interesting details about the film's production history.

Two A&E Biographies are included and both are excellent. The first, ""Gene Tierney: A Shattered Portrait,"" covers her tumultuous life with interviews with her ex-husband Oleg Cassini, her daughter Christina Cassini, Richard Widmark and others. The second, ""Vincent Price: The Versatile Villain"" showcases Price's brilliant career and his varied interests (art, writing, collecting). Commentators include his daughter, Victoria Price, actors Hazel Court, Jane Russell and director Roger Corman.

Other features include the trailer and a brief deleted scene in which Lydecker expands on his conversation with McPherson about how he molded Laura.",1111968000,7,2551,5.273399014778325

493462,5,630266232X,This was my late father's absolute favorite film.  It is most definitely Gene Tierney's best role.  The use of flashback was new at the time and tells the story well.  I recommend it highly.,1110844800,4,190,4.529411764705882
493463,4,630266232X,"Director Otto Preminger's slick and polished film noir, ""Laura"" (1944) has since become a cornerstone in American cinema. Yet, under its elegant facade of debutantes and high-society fashion is a world of ravenous jealousy, deceptive passions, intriguing blackmail, and faux murder. The film pits gruff police detective, Mark McPhereson (Dana Andrews) against smug and cultured columnist, Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb).  McPherson has been assigned to investigate the murder of Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney in her best role), a handsome woman who seemingly had no enemies in life. Through a series of interviews conducted with potential suspects, McPherson builds his profile of the dead girl - all the while falling under the spell of her striking portrait. But the puzzle unravels when the murder victim materializes in a bizarre twist of fate that forces McPhereson to re-think his entire case.

Preminger's direction is flawless - effortlessly moving from near humorous moments in the dynamic clash of wills between McPherson and Lydecker, to haunting segments of full bodied thrills involving the strangely surreal heroine of the piece. Dame Judith Anderson turns in a stellar performance as the diabolical socialite with an agenda; Ann Treadwell, while Vincent Price's oily performance as gigolo, Shelby Carpenter is nothing short of sublime. David Raksin's lush theme has since entered our collective consciousness and movie going heritage.

Fox's DVD exhibits a superb transfer. The gray scale has been impeccably rendered with exceptional tonality and attention to fine detail. The picture is generally sharp and pleasing on the eyes. Blacks are very rich, deep and solid. Whites are on the whole clean. Occasionally one will detect a note of edge enhancement and the odd age related artifact, but these are bare quibbling on an otherwise flawless presentation. The audio is mono and very nicely balanced. A hint of background hiss is detected in quiescent scenes, but again, for a film element that is pushing 70 years, there's really nothing to complain about. This DVD comes with well deserved extras; including two Biography specials - one on Gene Tierney, the other on Vincent Price; deleted scenes, a superlative audio commentary by David Raskin, Rudy Behlmer and Jeanine Basinger, and the film's original theatrical trailer. Very nicely put together, indeed.",1110672000,11,2370,5.4
493464,3,630266232X,"LAURA is a very popular and enjoyable drama. I've always considered it somewhat overrated, but it has achieved cult status, I think, mostly due to David Raksin's haunting theme that became a hit song afterward.

Fox's transfer leaves much to be desired, but is certainly decent for a 61 year old movie, although not up to Warner or Criterion standards.

Interestingly, after years of U G L Y packaging, Fox decides to copy the exceptional WB packaging by using original key art. Is this rocket science? If it worked then, it will work now. Good iconographic art lasts forever...glad Fox is taking this route now, but it won't make up for their U G L Y studio classics packaging.

The saddest thing about this release is that it deserved some excellent special features. Aside from the commentary, we get none. Instead we get these AWFUL recycled A&E Biography specials from Fox's paint-by-numbers documentary department. I often watched A&E Biography in its heyday, and if I saw a really bad (poorly written and filled with cliches) one, I'd say, ""Oh, that must be from Fox"", and indeed, it almost always was.

Too bad Fox didn't believe enough in this tentpole title to give it a four-star treatment. Don't get me wrong. It looks ""nice"" and its better than a Sony/Paramount/Universal/MGM bare bones classic...but Fox could have, and should have...done better!",1110067200,10,1360,4.925764192139738
493465,5,630266232X,"A film noir classic comes to DVD for the first time packed full of more extras than expected, ""Laura"" tells the story of a society beauty (Gene Tierney in a career defining performance) murdered for no apparent reason. Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews in a hardboiled strong performance) investigates her murder questioning the men in her life beginning with a witty critic Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb in a deliciously droll performance and in a major come back) and playboy Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price). Seen in flashback, we discover Laura's background and how she rises from the middle class to world class society beauty with the assistance of those men in her life. Things take a surprising twist when McPherson meets the very woman who was murdered as the audience must figure out what's really going on.  A marvelous suspense thriller with elements of film noir, ""Laura"" continues to be haunting sixty years on.

 A nicely detailed transfer with rich blacks and a nicely detailed picture, Fox has done a very good of job transferring this  classic to DVD. The DVD has some minor analog blemishes in the form of dirt and there's noticeable grain due to the stock of the film used to shoot the movie and how far removed the film is from the original nitrate negative (like most films from the era, the negative probably doesn't exist any longer although there's no information on the restoration here). The mono sound has nice presence with slight problems with hiss and other analog imperfections but, on the whole, it sounds superior to the previous releases on VHS and laserdisc.

We get the A&E Biography programs on Price featuring interviews with Price biographer Lucy Price Williams, Price's daughter, friends and film co-workers. Price initially joined Orson Welles' Mercury Theater in New York. The droll comments by actor/writer Norman Lloyd about their experience together in the Mercury Theater alone makes this biography worth watching. Price had an easy going and natural style that still seems contemporary and when seeing his performance with other more affected performers of the time. His debut in a 1933 Constance Bennet comedy more demonstrated his flair and versatility. Over the course of seven years Price played everything from Brigham Young to the King of France. One of the cinema's most underrated performers, Price's performances particularly here continue to sparkle with wit and power.

Gene Tierney's A&E Biography is a marvelous biography every bit the equal of the Price biography. Tierney began smoking to lower the pitch of her voice (at the advice of a studio executive) because she didn't like her voice thinking that she sounded like Minnie Mouse in her first film (she died of emphysema as a result of her life long addiction). Tierney's life had its tragic turns comparable to that of other beautiful stars of the day. She tumbled into depression after a failed marriage to costume designer Oleg Cassini and the birth of her mentally handicapped daughter resulting in her absence from the screen for nearly seven years. Tierney discovered that all the money she earned as an actress during the 40's was squandered by her father to support his failing business without her consent.

We also get a deleted scene (a rarity for films from this time) consisting of a montage sequence detailing how Lydecker taught her about the finer things in life. It was feared that the ""decadence"" on display would offend troops fighting overseas. We also get a theatrical trailer which demonstrates how bad this fine film might have looked like without the fine restoration seen here. This alternate opening deleted after the first screening has been integrated back into the movie so you may watch either the original version or the edited version that's been seen by millions over the years.

Historian Rudy Behlmer's commentary track tends to be the drier of the two tracks. He provides extensive background on the performers, the novel, director Otto Preminger. His comments on how Preminger had to fight for actor Clifton Webb to play Lydecker because of his well known homosexuality are particularly enlightening. Behlmer reads excerpts from Preminger's autobiography giving us insights from the director and writers of the project. Initially the writers wanted ""Laura"" to be a Broadway play before a film. Derailed; by politics and other issues, the script became a film instead despite lukewarm interest from MGM. MGM wanted to do the film as a ""B"" movie mystery while Fox had higher aspirations for the project. Preminger convinced the studio to buy the book. Initially working only as a producer on the project (his film failures had damaged his aspirations as a film director), Preminger took over direction from Rueben Mamoulian (""Dr. Jekell and Mr. Hyde"") early on during the shooting of the film replacing the director after he butted heads with Preminger.

Film composer David Raskin's commentary track is absolutely charming, involving and although his memories of the film have been colored by time, it's also a lot more inviting. Raskin's haunting, wistful romantic score acts as a perfect counterpoint to the action and, at other times, underlining the emotional core of the moment.

A classic finally comes to DVD with plenty of bells and whistles. With an extremely good transfer, great commentary tracks featuring original film composer David Raskin and two excellent A&E Biography episodes on stars Gene Tierney and Vincent Price, ""Laura"" was worth the wait. The inclusion of a deleted scene and a version of the movie with and without the scene will delight long time fans of this terrific movie.",1109721600,112,5659,5.088362068965517

As far as film noirs go, I'm not sure this really counts but why quibble? Really, though, Dana Andrews stands out as the insular policeman who discovers something a little more refined within himself when he falls for Laura.

493494,5,630266232X,"Although toned down from Vera Caspary's novel, ""Laura"" is a classic example of sexual obssession in 40's film noir. Otto Preminger (with help from Rouben Mamoulian) created a masterpiece of a mystery film loaded with decadence and sexual tension. Tough streetwise police detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) investigates the violent society murder of beautiful, enigmatic ad exec Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) and enters the cold, calculating world of high society where everyone has dark secrets. He encounters a list of suspects including ascerbic Waldo Lydecker (superb Clifton Webb) as Laura's ""benefactor"" and companion who introduced her to the high end of advertising and her gigolo fiance' Shelby (Vincent Price) who is more or less kept by Laura's aunt (Judith Anderson). It is Lydecker who matches wits with Mark every step of the way. Mark has become obssessed with Laura's portrait, her perfume and letters and has obviously fallen in love with the ""dead"" Laura. The sexual obssession theme lies underneath the complicated relationships including Mark's fascination with Laura's relationships and her personal things and in the flashback sequences, it is clear that Lydecker fancied himself more than just Laura's ""companion"". He sought to possess her. But it gets stickier as it goes along when Laura turns up very much alive. There is so much to savor in this film along with the performances (especially Webb's) like the beautiful b&w photography that gives the film a dream like quality and the lovely ""Laura"" them by David Raskin that haunts the film and emphasizes the romantic longing Mark has for Laura and Laura's mysterious, paradoxical personality.

When I grew up this was always one of my favorite movies, and then when I re-discovered this movie as an adult, I was always mesmerized by her and by the entire cast, the score and the story, all prime examples of how great film noir can be when it's done with this amount of style and class.
SIDENOTE:
***I was not aware until recently of her tragic encounter with a female Marine at a Hollywood Canteen, during WW2. Apparently this Marine was hospitalized for German Measles, and she sneaked out of the hospital to meet her favorite movie star. She had her picture taken with GT, who was pregnant at the time, and also KISSED her, which resulted in her baby daughter being born with severe mental retardation. When Daria (the daughter) was four years old she was insititutionalized. GT met the woman one year later and found out how she had contracted German Measles, but did not mention the tragic consequences of the woman's actions for reasons unknown.***
What sets this particular movie apart from the rest of the genre, is it's cast and it's tasteful telling of the story, which includes the creme de la creme of New York society, played to the hilt by the cast. One of my chief joys in watching this movie, is the scene of Clifton Webb (as the acerbic critic, Waldo Lydecker) sitting in his enormous black bathtub(!) typing furiously, and relishing the power he has by virtue of his position as a critic. He takes savage pleasure in denigrating anyone who displeases him, either by their lack of talent or because of his own personal dislike.
There is not one moment of slack; all is interesting, relevant and suspenseful; you will NOT be able to figure it out until the end. On DVD, especially, this movie guarantees suspense and a fascinating glimpse into what the ""Golden Age of Hollywood"" was capable of...Excellent performances also by Vincent Price as the ne'er do well playboy, man about town, and Judith Anderson, a far cry from her portrayal of the redoubtable Mrs. Danvers in ""Rebecca."" If you have never seen this, get it; you will not be sorry, and if you have seen it, you should get it for the quality of the DVD...",1061856000,210,2394,4.635294117647059

So much merdre gets released each week--it is truly astonishing that a film such as Laura has to take a number and wait. Well, that gripe aside--this is a taut thriller that is psychologically deep, witty, romantic,sexy, and suspenseful. How much more could one ask of a movie--that it solve the budget crisis? For an earlier reviewer who thought it ... that the Clifton Webb character leads the detective along, this device is part of the personality of Lydecker (""Lie"", get it?), who is so narcissistic that he has to confess his perfection in both love and murder in order to appease his vanity, to be admired, to be known for the genius he believes himself to be--even be it for crime and a date with Ol' Sparky. He is constantly proving his superiority by insulting McPherson and Shelby and showing them up in Laura's eyes--so he thinks. He is a master manipulator, perfectionist, and control freak--even if it means implicating himself! So this bit of character development is completely in keeping with Lydecker's temperament and is what drives the story. Gene Tierney is incredibly gorgeous in this part, and Dana Andres is both muscular and tender--when he needs to be.

493501,5,630266232X,"My personal all-time favorite and widely considered to be one of the best film noirs ever made, I envy anyone who has yet to see this film. Complete with story and plot, mood and atmosphere, twists and turns, this film picks up the audience, completely surrounding it so that nothing else matters, and takes control of the collective mind from beginning to end.
Laura's beauty and character touched everyone who knew her. The acerbic columnist, in love with her and willing to do anything to keep her; the good-for-nothing heir, keeping up the pretense of living of another's fortune; the aunt who hated her for her beauty and wished her dead; the maid who worshiped her for her kindness; the hard-boiled detective in love with the portrait of a dead woman.
And then there is Laura herself. Beautifully played by Gene Tierney at the height of her career, we are at once drawn to her and once we have seen her, nothing else matters. The shy advertising artist, the blossoming career woman, and finally, the self-assured beauty that is worshipped by those around her--and we are there to witness the transformation. But it is not really a transformation; we are just beginning to really understand her.
In film noir, the opening scene is critical and often plays with the mind of the audience, where nothing is as it seems. And this film is a classic example. It opens up with a haunting scene in the outer foyer of Waldo Lydecker's home with his voice-over ""I shall never forget the weekend that Laura died...""

493516,5,630266232X,"While LAURA is delightful to watch upon a reviewing, this has to be one of the most delightfully shocking films to see on a first viewing ever made.  What a wonderful plot!  And what an astonishing collection of characters!  The hero of the film is solid and reliable Detective Mark McPherson is ably played by Dana Andrews, but while the ostensible lead, he is usually upstaged by the marvelous assortment of character actors and actresses.  Gene Tierney's Laura is one of the most intriguing female characters in the movies, and completely justifies in her performance the fascination that McPherson feels for her.  Most modern film goers are usually mildly shocked when they see Vincent Price for the first time, not realizing what a remarkably handsome man he was before turning to horror films.  Juliet Anderson is great as the keeper of a much younger man.
But despite the other fine performances, this film belongs to Clifton Webb, transparently imitating Alexander Woollcott, a columnist, radio commentator, and famous wit.  Woollcott was the dominating figure around the famous Algonquin Round Table.  Although Webb did not resemble Woollcott in the least--Woollcott was quite rotund--he unquestionably caught his playful arrogance and somewhat sadistic tone.  The film role was a triumph for Webb, who had been more or less blackballed from the movies since the advent of sound films for his out-in-the-open homosexuality.  He managed an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor (he was beaten out by Barry Fitzgerald's portrayal as a priest in GOING MY WAY), and he remained active in film for the next decade, most notably in THE RAZOR'S EDGE and the Belvedere pictures.  In this film, any scene in which he appears is memorable, and he provides nearly all the finest lines.  Examples:  ""I don't use a pen. I write with a goose quill dipped in venom"" (upon being asked to endorse a pen for an advertisement). ""I should be sincerely sorry to see my neighbor's children devoured by wolves.""  ""It's lavish, but I call it home.""  ""In my case, self-absorption is completely justified. I have never discovered any other subject quite so worthy of my attention.""
I have to add some astonishment at the widespread and indiscriminant use of the term ""film noir.""  There are specific elements that make a film noir, and most of them are missing from this film.  LAURA is an old-fashioned murder mystery with a couple of twists, and has more in common with an Agatha Christie parlor mystery than a film noir.  Not all murder mysteries filmed in black and white are film noir.  The biggest problem with attempting to label LAURA a film noir is the way this designation causes the description to lose much meaning.  Film noir usually is characterized by a stark contrast in lighting with lots of shadow and stark, harsh whites.  Also by a morally ambiguous hero or anti-hero.  Dana Andrews is quite definitely a good guy, with none of the world-weariness found in most film noir heroes.  Nor is the devious female found in most film noirs present in LAURA.  Gene Tierney's character is mysterious, but she is pretty clearly not the least sinister. Compare all these to THE MALTESE FALCON or DOUBLE INDEMNITY to see how very, very different it is from a genuine film noir.",1054425600,5,3272,4.928832116788321

493518,5,630266232X,"""Laura"" is one of those movies, like ""Psycho"" and ""The Crying Game,"" where hopefully you get to see it before the cat is out of the bag. The problem with this classic 1944 film from director Otto Preminger is that if you have not then the cover of the videotape/DVD gives the game away (a visual spoiler if ever you have seen one). Detective Lt. Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) is investigating the murder of beautiful Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney), who answered her door and had her pretty face destroyed by a double-barreled shotgun blast. The chief suspects are the men who loved Laura, the haughty Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), acerbic critic of all things human (think Alexander Wolcott), and the dapper Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), who is just a gigolo. What makes this one special is that McPherson also falls under Laura's spell. He is used to dames and dolls in his world, but the gorgeous portrait of Laura over the mantle of her fireplace sparks something different within him.
This compelling twist works to make the viewing forgive a lot of the holes in this film noir, mostly notably the idea that if a detective finds what he believes to be the murder weapon that he returns it to its hiding spot so he can come back and pick it up in the morning. Dana Andrews is not exactly a romantic figure, but in this film he gets that role mostly by default since Webb's Lydecker is too smarmy and Price's Carpenter is too slimy. Lydecker overwhelms every scene in which he is in, from his over the top opening narration, to his first appearance on scene sitting imperiously in his bathtub, on to his cutting wit during his first meeting with Laura. Still, as hard as the three men try to make the film and the world about themselves, this is all about the beautiful Laura, magnified by not only the haunting portrait but also David Raskin's lovely musical theme. No wonder McPherson has a crush on her so extreme that he goes to her apartment at night to look through her letters, fondle her dresses, enjoy her perfume, and sit beneath her portrait drinking her booze.
Everybody has a secret in this film, usually more, and in due course McPherson finds them all out. Of course Laura in person cannot compete with the idealized image that is created by the living room shrine in her apartment, but by then the mystery of ""whodunit"" comes into play and we go along with the image of her that is in McPherson's eyes because that is what the plot demands. Tierney has the look to be Laura, the siren from beyond the grave, but she does not give the character the sort of life that would justify all this attention. The legacy of the film ends up being Clifton Webb, who parlayed his performance in this film into a career of note, although he was 55 when ""Laura"" was filmed. Still, Preminger proves how far you can go with a film when you have a great idea and a definite sense of style.",1046476800,10,2890,4.527724665391969
493519,5,630266232X,"""Laura"" is one of those rare creative exercises that come along only once per generation. Script, performances, photography and sets blend into an artistic masterpiece. Director Otto Preminger probably helped some, although not as much as he liked to think.",1043366400,2,257,5.45
493520,5,630266232X,"This is film noir played in part as a comedy of manners.  (Incidentally, a comedy of manners gets its name from the satirical possibilities in the differing class views on proper behavior--manners--exploited by playwrights to the delight of an audience placed in a superior position--they think--of social discernment.  Here we can see the differentials, but they are not played for comedic effect.)
Gene Tierney (at twenty-four) stars as Laura Hunt, a beautiful career girl who, as the picture opens, has been murdered.  (Shot in face with a double barreled shotgun, a point of information not dwelled on by director Otto Preminger.  Today's directors, of course, would have begun with a full facial shot of the corpse.)  Dana Andrews is the leading man, playing Mark McPherson, a hard-boiled police detective with a soft heart.  Vincent Price, who before he became a maven of horror, was actually a soft-spoken, hunkish ladies man, plays Shelby Carpenter, who could afford to have his reputation blemished, but not his clothes.  He is a man about town who would fit nicely into a British comedy of manners at the turn of the nineteenth century.
But the surprising star is Clifton Webb who plays Waldo Lydecker, venomous columnist and radio personality, who against his first impressions, falls madly (and of course hopelessly) in love with Laura and becomes her mentor.  This was before the genteel and very precise veteran of the musical stage was Mr. Belvedere, and before his triumph in Cheaper by the Dozen (1950), that is to say, before he was typecast as an irascible but lovable middle aged man--but not before his fiftieth birthday; strange how the fortunes of actors may go.  By the way, George Sanders's Oscar-winning performance as the cynical critic in All About Eve (1950), owes something to Webb's work here.
The strength of the movie is in the intriguing storyline featuring surprising but agreeable plot twists, and especially in the fine acting by Webb, Andrews, Tierney and Price.  Webb in particular is brilliant.  I think this is another example of Otto Preminger getting a lot more out of his actors than he is usually given credit for.  See Anatomy of a Murder 1959, starring James Stewart and Lee Remick, for another example.  Known for turning commercial novels into commercial movies (e.g., The Man with the Golden Arm (1955); Exodus (1960); Advise and Consent (1962)) Preminger is at his best when he lets the material have its way.  I call that the invisible style of directing and he follows it here.  Add the beautiful score by David Raksin and this movie is a special treat.
As a mystery however it is a little predictable.  We know from the beginning not only who will get the girl, but with a very high probability who pulled the trigger.  What we don't know in the first case is how, since she is presumably dead, and in the second case, why.  The lack of motive hides the killer's identity from us.  But rest assured, all is unraveled in the final reel.
See this for Clifton Webb whose improbable Hollywood success, beginning with this movie, started when he was in his fifties and ended when he was in his sixties.  If I were a thirty-year-old actor running to auditions, I would call that inspiration.",1030060800,7,3239,4.875912408759124
493521,4,630266232X,"A class act in film noir! ""Laura"" gloriously shot in black & white is a veritable showcase of long shadows, booze, and clouds of cigarette smoke. Gene Tierney was acceptably cast as Laura though her performance was hardly inspired. This Otto Preminger directed murder mystery largely succeeded on the strengths of an inspired supporting cast including a suprisingly likable Vincent Price as a vulnerable gigolo with Judith Anderson as the frustrated society matron who would crave his attention.  But it was the physically slight persona and acerbic wit of would-be Svengali, Waldo Lydecker brillantly defined by Clifton Webb and his relationship with the hard-bitten, hard drinking police detective Mark McPherson portrayed in a career defining role by Dana Andrews that elevated this film to classic status. I am constantly amazed by the craft Webb displayed, notably as his character of Lydecker arose naked from his ritual bath in front of a perfect stranger in McPherson, dressing himself immaculately, and finally adorning his carefully tailored look with a fresh carnation all the while delivering clever lines of dialog perfectly timed to the moment. Obviously, the times and customs were far different in an urban America in the 1940's. With a world war raging but never mentioned in the film, who would nit-pick McPherson the worldly cop assigned to the murder case of Laura Hunt, a police detective who unabashedly consumed considerable amounts of alcohol on the job, in front of suspects and if the opportunity arose, before noon yet? Can you imagine the outrage today? Hollywood, of times long past also had a way of showcasing cigarette consumption and elevated its questionable use to high visual art. ""Laura"" certainly made full use of this handy device in scene after scene. The romantic ""Laura"" theme has been noted many times and with good reason. Its subtle variations lilting through out the film serve as a subtle point of focus. In these times of political correctness run amok, this film serves as a refreshing diversion to review and compare our contemporary behavior and mores to a generation past. ""Laura"" is a wonderfully crafted example of stylized film making to be enjoyed again and again. Pour yourself a scotch and soda, sit back and enjoy.",1026777600,8,2273,5.126684636118599
493522,5,630266232X,"Once again, PBS shows another great film. ""Laura"" was on, and I had been wanting to see it for awhile as I had loved Gene Tierney in ""Leave her to Heaven"".
Gene Tierney, who I think is the most beautiful woman to ever grace the movie screen, plays Laura Hunt.  Laura works for an advertising agency, and she works her way up to the top of the corporate ladder just barely hitting the glass ceiling.
While working on a new sponsor for a new product, she meets Waldo Lydecker(what a great character name!), played by Clifton Webb.  Who, by the way, is outstanding in this movie!  What a performance!  Her relationship with Mr. Lydecker is strictly platonic, at least she thinks it is. Waldo has other plans.
He falls for her hard and stalks her.  He goes so far as to kill her!  or does he?
The whole film is told in narration by Waldo, and after the supposed death of Laura.  He tells the story of how they met and about their relationship to us and to Lt. Mark Macpherson(and we see it all unfold on screen), played by Dana Andrews, who also turns in a great performance.
Macpherson gets into Laura's apartment and starts snooping around to find information.  There is a portrait of her hanging over the fireplace, and it is so engaging that he falls in love with her just from glaring at it for so long.
Vincent Price played lead romantic male roles before turning to the ""House of Wax"" and other old horror movie.  He plays Shelby Carpenter, one of the other men who become entranced by Laura's beauty.
The movie is classic film noir.  Filmed in black and white, it still makes Gene Tierney look so amazingly and utterly stunning to look at. She had a true classic look, and she was a great actress.  She seemed to be in a class all her own.  Webb delivers some of the wittiest yet devilish lines in the film, and he is just pure brilliance in the role of Walter Lydecker. I don't know who beat him to Oscar that year, but he was extremely deservant of it himself.
This is a great classic old movie.  Worth watching!!!
I highly recommend this one!!!

493525,5,630266232X,"I originally came to this film without any knowledge of it beyond having read that it was an exceptional film--and given that LAURA is at heart a noir mystery, that was perhaps for the best.  So, if you prefer to skip the commentary and approach the film untainted, I give my recommendation now: buy it immediately.
Based on the popular novel by Vera Caspery, LAURA begins as a mystery pure and simple: Laura Hunt, a beautiful and successful young woman, has been found dead in her elegant New York apartment, murdered by a shotgun blast to the head.  Tough and rough Detective Mark McPherson is assigned to investigate--and slowly, as he delves into her world of high society, gossip columns, business success, and personal glamour he becomes romantically obsessed with the victim.  Much of the story is told via flashback as McPherson interviews Laura's friends and acquaintances: the waspish Waldo Lyedecker, an acid-tongued columnist who ""discovered"" Laura; her aunt Ann Treadwell, who envied Laura; her fiance Shelby Carpenter, who depended upon Laura.  The device is extremely effective, and lures the viewer into the same fascination with Laura that Detective McPherson experiences.
The cast is extraordinary.  Although generally admired more for beauty than acting ability, Gene Tierney delivers a first-rate performance as as Laura, seen early in the film in flashback; she is a remarkably attractive woman, and she plays with a perfect mix of coolness and innocence.  While I have never much admired Dana Andrews, he is perfectly cast as the street-common detective who is gradually consumed by obsession with Laura.  But the real standouts here are Clifton Webb as the posionously witty Waldo Lydecker, the powerful Judith Anderson (best remembered as Mrs. Danvers in REBECCA) as Laura's aunt, and Vincent Price as Laura's weakling fiance.  The script is a pearl beyond price, running at a rapid pace and shot through with some of the most memorable dialogue (most going to Clifton Webb) in Hollywood history.  Everything about the film strikes precisely the right chord: the cinematography that shifts between hard and soft, the subtle camera movements, the mysterious and memorable theme song, and the cast itself.  A truly fascinating film that can be enjoyed again and again; dead or alive, LAURA remains as captivating today as she was a half-century ago.  Strongly, strongly recommended.",1020902400,6,2404,5.218181818181818

It just struck a chord in me and when the handsome Dana Andrews seems to be having a date with the dead woman also intrigued me, a different storyline than other films. I think the best thing was the acting, of course everybody loved Clifton Webb and Vincent Price. And I to liked the way Price acted in the film with his ever so slight Kentucky accent and smooth manners! It was more Gene Tierney who caught my imagination. Why, I am not sure except I liked the slow way she moved and talked. I am not even sure it that is what I want to say, she just had a charisma about her. The way she acted like a little child that needed protecting and than like a nurturing mother, it really made alot of the movie for me. I can't really place it bit I definately felt like she fit the part for Laura. I never saw her in any other movies but I think I will check out some more that she acted in. A note of interest, she suffered from emotional problems in her thirties and underwent shock therapy for depression. How sad! This is a must see for anyone interested in film noir.

493527,5,630266232X,"With a well-rounded cast, Oscar winning cinematography and a beautiful but haunting music score, Laura is one of the best  film noirs ever made, a definite classic (Possible plot spoilers ahead).
Laura Hunt (A beautiful Gene Tierney) is a manager at an advertisement agency. Famous, talented and of course attractive, she is adored and respected by everyone. But when she is murdered, everyone who was close to her is suspected. Detective Lieutenant Mark McPherson (A dull but effective Dana Andrews) is put on the case. Throughout the film, we are given the impression that McPherson doesn't think too well of women, referring to them as `Dames' or `Dolls'. As he delves further, he finds he falling in love with Laura's portrait. As it turns out, Laura is very much alive. The problem now is for McPherson to find out who was murdered and, more importantly, who was the murderer.
Clifton Webb gave the film's best performance as columnist/ writer Waldo Lydecker  (Murder is his favorite subject). He never admits it, but seems to be in love with Laura. He has given her many gifts and gave her the boost to become the success that she was. He also believes that only he is right for her, though considerably beyond her age. But maybe Laura just was using and manipulating him to rise to the top. Waldo never seems to believe this and prevents Laura from having other relationships with men. He also is a smart alec, claiming that he writes not with a pen, but ""...with a Goose Quill, dipped in venom"". He is definitely the most colorful character in the movie and got an Oscar nomination for his work.
What ever you do, don't give away the ending. It is revealed who the murderer was. It is both the most likely and the least likely suspect. But it doesn't matter who it is, really. For this is still a must see movie. It's also, for the MTV generation people, rather short (88 Minutes).

493528,5,630266232X,"""Laura"" was to Twentieth Century Fox what ""Casablanca"" was to Warner Brothers.  Both forties' films started out as jinxed B movie projects where seemingly everything that could go wrong did, as in the basic principle of Murphy's Law.  For awhile it appeared that neither film would ever be cast, much less filmed, but when all the smoke cleared Hollywood had two of its most enduring classics and the B labels were long forgotten.
Even though it was filmed entirely on Twentieth sound stages in Beverly Hills, ""Laura"" has the definite ring and feel of a Park Avenue New York City drama, as faithfully adapted from the novel by New Yorker Vera Caspery.  Twentieth Century Fox boss Darryl F. Zanuck had to be talked into hiring former career stage actor Clifton Webb for the part of egomaniacal New York columnist and commentator Waldo Lydecker by director Otto Preminger.  Zanuck can be thankful he listened to Preminger as Webb delivers a priceless performance, his cutting one-liners resonating throughout.  When he is told at a party that Shelby Carpenter, played by Vincent Price, comes from an old Kentucky family, Webb replies, ""Sharecroppers, no doubt.""  When reminded of the blatant manner in which he heaps self-praise, the unruffled Webb assures, ""It is completely justified.""
""Laura"" has been cited as one of filmdom's most voyeuristic films along with Hitchcock's masterpiece ""Vertigo"".  At a time when detective McPherson, played by Dana Andrews, believes that the beautiful young Park Avenue advertising executive Laura Hunt, played by hauntingly lovely Gene Tierney, has been murdered, he becomes haunted by her memory.  He isolates himself in her apartment, paces the floor as he nervously chain smokes, and stares at her painting on the wall.  The wily Webb sees what is happening, declaring tartly, ""This is the only time I have seen a detective fall in love with a corpse.""  Andrews also enjoys taunting the egomaniacal Webb.  Knowing that he expects total attention at all times, Andrews rankles Webb by playing with a hand held baseball pinball game.  Finally Webb takes the bait, erupting with the admonition, ""Can't you ever stop playing with that infernal game?""
When it turns out that another girl, model Diane Redfern, was the actual victim of the fatal shooting in Laura's apartment, Andrews turns in every direction of Laura's inner circle to find the killer.  In the process he falls head over heels in love with Laura.
The brilliant dialogue retains its clever Upper East Side Manhattan ring throughout.  The film has a mystical quality recognized by viewers, especially Andrews' fixation with a presumably dead woman.

493535,5,630266232X,"I saw this movie at least ten times.  First time was in my early teens, when it was shown on local TV.  I never heard of Gene Tierney before, but after seeing this film, I knew I would never forget her.  She was the most beautiful actress I ever saw and her mannerisms reveal a classy keen intelligence.  Everything about this movie will haunt you--Tierney's beauty, the musical score by David Raksin, the portrait, and the ending.
The film is about a woman who seemed to have everything--a successful career, beauty, brains, wealth--who is discovered murdered in her apartment.  A detective, Mark McPherson, played by Dana Andrews investigates the case and starts questioning possible suspects.  One is the Svengali-like Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), a syndicated columnist and radio personality.  Another is Shelby Carpenter, a smooth Southern gigolo played by Vincent Price (yes Vincent Price!).  And there's Laura's middle-aged socialite aunt, Ann Treadwell, who was using Carpenter as her boy-toy until Carpenter meets Laura.  Other possible suspect is Laura's maid, a feisty loyal Irishwoman.
The film shows narrated flashbacks by Lydecker.  He idolizes her and intercepts Laura's suitors, all of whom he considers beneath her.  He couldn't intercept Carpenter who attracts Laura, and who Laura was supposed to marry the week she was found murdered.  The first twist of the film is when McPherson falls in love with Laura, who's presumed dead.  From reading her diary and letters and continuously seeing her portrait, he discovers she's the woman of his dreams, an unattainable goddess whose physical presence he can only imagine.  So when twist number two happens, the murder investigation understandably becomes secondary to this gumshoe detective.
This is the best film directed by Otto Preminger.  I believe it's the first American film he directed, and his following films pale by comparison.  Ironically, this is a film full of second choices.  The lead was written with Jennifer Jones in mind, but she turned it down.  It was then offered to Heddy Lamarr who also turned it down.  Tierney claimed in her autobiography that she didn't want the role either and thought the film was going to bomb, due to the fact that many aspects of it were not prepared (the final script, the music) and that Dana Andrews (also a second choice) prior to this film never had a role as a leading man.  The portrait that was originally intended for the film was painted by the wife of director Rouben Mamoulian, who was initially hired for the film but was fired by Preminger who was producing it.  Paintings don't transcribe well to film so a touched-up photograph of Tierney was used as the portrait.  Preminger took the directing himself.  He wanted to use the song ""Sophisticated Lady"" by Duke Ellington as the musical score, but David Raksin made a deal with him, in which he would write a score Preminger would approve of in one weekend.  Raksin claimed he kept looking at a photo of Tierney during the composition of the score and that she was his inspiration.  Thus second choices made this movie a classic.
The dialogue is witty and biting, particularly that of Lydecker.  The film was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Supporting Actor (Webb), Best Black and White Cinematography and Best Musical Score.  It only won for Best Cinematography, and I'd like to learn what films aced it in the other categories.  Although awards are not considered important by many film connoisserus, the winners are the ones recognized by the next generation.  Thus ""Laura"" remains one of the most underrated films of all time.",992476800,24,3622,5.010033444816053
493551,3,630266232X,"It's a classic tale of love, murder and obsession, when a homicide detective becomes enamored of the victim of a brutal murder he's investigating, in ""Laura,"" directed by Otto Preminger and starring Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews.  The story begins with the discovery of the murder of Laura Hunt (Tierney), a young advertising executive in New York City, and as detective Mark McPherson (Andrews) makes his investigation and begins to fit together the pieces of the puzzle of Laura's life and death, the essence of who she was begins to emerge.  And it gives the story an interesting twist; for after seeing a portrait of Laura, and getting to know her by reading her most intimate personal letters and diary (routine for a murder investigation), McPherson becomes obsessed with her, and soon discovers he's not alone; there was another man obsessed with her as well.  Subsequently, he must determine if that obsession played any part in Laura's death.  The suspects include the men in her life, Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), a radio personality/columnist who helped her begin her career, and Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), her fiance, a man of seemingly dubious character who had recently been involved with a model who worked for Laura's agency.  The list doesn't end with them, however; also in the running is a man named Jacoby (John Dexter), the artist who painted the portrait of Laura that so mesmerized McPherson, and then there's some question as to the relationship between a certain Ann Treadwell (Judith Anderson) and Carpenter that is yet to be resolved.
 Preminger delivers a solid mystery that will keep you in suspense until the very end, but with only enough tension to keep it interesting rather than engrossing.  And though the story is believable, there are elements of the plot that develop so quickly it stretches credibility a bit.  An additional two or three scenes relating to certain aspects of the characters lives (especially Laura's) would have had a significant impact of this film-- good as it is-- and with a running time of 85 minutes (on most prints) it wouldn't have been out of the question to expand it somewhat.
 As far as the characters, McPherson, Lydecker and Carpenter emerge fully sketched and need little development; you know exactly who they are and where they've been.  This is not the case with Laura, however; Tierney's character suffers somewhat from lack of development, and as the story unfolds, she seems to get from here to there with little discernible change.  What the character needed was a bit more depth and some real definition.
 Which is exactly what Andrews and Webb give to their characters; Webb as the flamboyant and self-assured Lydecker, Andrews as the stoic and deliberating McPherson.  Price gives a notable performance, as well, but has a tendency to lapse into melodrama occasionally, which can be distracting at times.  And Tierney gives a passable performance, though her acting is not on a par with her exquisite beauty.  In her initial encounter with Lydecker, for instance, her pronounced coyness is somewhat diverting.  Still, her presence on the screen is radiant, which makes it easy to overlook the slight flaws in her acting.
 The supporting cast includes Dorothy Adams (Bessie), Cy Kendall (Inspector), Grant Mitchell (Lancaster Corey), Buster Miles (Office Boy) and Frank La Rue (Hairdresser).  A good mystery, but with few surprises, ""Laura"" nevertheless remains a classic in it's own right.  It's not a perfect film (the final words spoken, in fact, are decidedly melodramatic), but it's good storytelling, and is ultimately satisfying.  Saying that there was room for improvement would be nit-picking; suffice to say that it is what it is, which is a pretty good movie.",989107200,16,3759,5.071428571428571
493552,5,630266232X,"About 30 years ago, my parents , who sadly are both gone now, recommended Otto Preminger's ""Laura"" to me. At that time, I had only seen the notoriously bad made-for-TV version starring Lee Radziwill(!) and George Sanders. When I saw the 1944 version, I was hooked. ""Laura"" is one of those perfect films that draws you in every time. Now when I mean ""perfect"", that doesn't necessarily mean believable. ""Laura"" is an elegant, film noir fairy tale. I'm not really sure that Laura would end up with a rough-edged detective, but who cares? That's the magic of movies! The fact that you believe it while you're watching it is what counts. If you DON'T believe it WHILE you're watching it, that's when the trouble starts! But back to ""Laura"". The film is elegantly photographed, with sets that I wish I could live in. Then take a top-notch cast that features a drop-dead beautiful Gene Tierney, the acidic Clifton Webb (in an incredible screen debut), the tough/sexy Dana Andrews, and the elegant and deadly duo of Vincent Price and Judith Anderson, give them a sharp-as-a-poisoned stiletto script, and watch what happens! ""Laura"" is a tight, smart murder/mystery with some VERY dark undertones-the effects of beauty and desire on a frustrated and twisted psyche, the destructive and venal thoughts hidden behind a veneer of sophistication and wit, and a man's growing obsession with a (presumably) dead woman are just some of the dark forces at work here. The cherry on the sundae of this toxic dessert is David Raksin's score which, of course, introduced the world to the bittersweet theme song for ""Laura."" I was never a fan of the Johnny Mercer lyrics for this song-it was, to me, like tacking an instruction booklet onto the Mona Lisa. Some things are better left unspoken! I don't know how many times I've seen ""Laura"". I've lost count. My dear friend Susan and I could act it out in front of an audience like ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show,"" we've seen it that often. If you've seen ""Laura"", see it again. If you haven't, rent it, or better still, buy it. It gets better the 50th viewing around.",978048000,418,2096,4.760989010989011
493553,5,630266232X,"This film is a what Film Noir is all about! Perfect in every area. Gene Tierney was never better in a pinnacle performance and Dana Andrews is wonderful. The greatly under rated Vincent Price and the brilliant Judith Anderson soar but Clifton Webb walks away with the film! How did this great actor loose the Oscar? His Waldo Lydecker is nothing short of brilliant! When he is on the screen I defy anyone to take their eyes from him. If you love a good mystery or film noir you can't miss this one.
They don't get any better!!!",974332800,3,527,4.387755102040816
493554,5,630266232X,"Waldo Lydecker, who can forget that name or that character, portrayed by Clifton Webb. If you have not seen the film I do not want to give the plot away. This is an intelligent mystery distinguished by witty dialogue, stylistic photography and production design and excellent acting. Gene Tierney, Dana Andrews and Vincent Price are perfectly cast. Preminger being more of the technician and perfectionist assembled all these talents to produce this genuine classic. David Raksin's theme is one of Hollywood's standards. Joseph LaShelle won an Oscar for his Black & White Cinematography.",973814400,2,587,5.32258064516129
493555,5,630266232X,"Laura is a classic example of film noir at its best. But it's also an outstanding film from the Golden Age of movies without regard to genre. The plot is full of unexpected twists and turns, and the cast -- including, Gene Tierney as Laura, Dana Andrews as the detective assigned to investigate her alleged murder, and Clifton Webb as her arrogant admirer -- play their parts well. I can't imagine how any true movie fan could not like this classic film -- even if you generally don't like film noir. And, once heard, can the song ""Laura"" ever be forgotten? Please don't miss this one.",970099200,,585,4.528301886792453
493556,5,630266232X,"Laura is possibly the most entertaining and engrossing crime drama ever to come out of Hollywood.  Gene Tierney established herself as a first-rate  actress with this film, and will forever be remembered as the enigmatic  beauty who inspired David Raksin's romantic musical score.  As detective  Mark McPherson, Dana Andrews gives one of the great (and one of the most  underrated) performances of his long film career.  It's hard to imagine  another actor coming close to his subtle characterization.  The supporting  cast is equally superb, with Cliffton Webb, Vincent Price, and Judith  Anderson all turning in brilliant performances.  Laura has some of the best  dialogue in American film, rivaling the best of Joseph L. Mankiewicz,  including All About Eve, already pointed out by another reviewer.  Among  the most memorable lines from this film, ""I hope you'll never regret what  promises to be a disgustingly earthy relationship,"" uttered with complete  guile by Waldo Lydecker (Webb).  And my favorite movie line of all time:  ""For a charming intelligent girl you've certainly surrounded yourself with  a remarkable collection of dopes,"" delivered in a perfect deadpan manner by  Andrews to Tierney toward the end of the film.  The set direction and  wardrobe are chic and stylish, similar in look to some of the best Alfred  Hitchcock films.  Laura is as original and contemporary today as it was  when first released in 1944.  An absolute gem; you will not be  disappointed.",966211200,16,1485,5.2
493557,5,630266232X,"When I first saw this film, it totally blew me away.  I never expected it to be so magnificent!  A beautifully made picture with outstanding performances by the absolutely gorgeous Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews.  The  wonderful acting, compelling story, and a truly haunting theme song, are  what make this film great.
When I first started watching this film, I  thought I would end up leaving.  Fifteen minutes into the fim, I was  hooked.  I couldn't stop watching it.  It was so mysterious and haunting,  you just have to see the end.  The movie just gets better and better.  I  was shocked by the end of the movie.  It was fantastic!
If you like  classic films, you should defenitely see this movie.  Laura is truly a  MASTERPIECE!",962236800,3,735,4.653543307086614
493558,5,630266232X,"Otto Preminger's 1940 black-and-white classic LAURA is one of the most  elegant expressions of the film noir style.  It's also, hands-down, one of  the kinkiest detective dramas ever to come out of Hollywood.  There really  isn't a single innocent or pure-hearted character on the screen--not Anne  Treadwell, the lonely, desperate matron who falls hopelessly in love with a  suave playboy.  Not Waldo Lydecker (wonderfully played by Clifton Webb, who  earned an Oscar for his performance), the sharp-tongued, wickedly cynical  journalist who nurtures his own obsession with the title character.  Not  even the detective, Mark McPherson (eerily foreshadowing Jimmy Stewart's  character in VERTIGO), who develops a perversely necrophilic attraction to  Laura while investigating her murder.  Perhaps least innocent of all is  Laura herself, who is possibly the most dangerous woman of all time--a  goddess whose beauty has the power to stir men's darkest passions.
This  is the sort of film people refer to when they say, ""They don't make `em  like they used to.""  LAURA is so richly entertaining on so many different  levels it's hard to know where to start.  It's a top-notch murder mystery  that literally crackles with tension (particularly the chilling finale),  and there's a particularly audacious twist halfway through.  The  razor-sharp dialogue is a joy to listen to--every word is infused with dry,  caustic wit, especially when delivered by Webb.  The acting is, of course,  first-rate, the cinematography is lush, and the musical score itself is a  star.  Oh, and one more thing--there has never been, and never will be, a  woman more beautiful than Gene Tierney.  NEVER.",960076800,5,1683,5.325670498084291
493559,5,630266232X,"There's something about Laura, that once you see it, you want to add it to your collection of classic films.  There's murder, jealousy, obsession, and love, all wrapped up in 85 minutes of classic movie magic.  Dana Andrews  stars as a tough as nails detective who finds himself falling in love and  obsessing about a murder victim that he knows only through the memories of  others and from a portrait hanging in her apartment.  Clifton Webb, as the  unforgettable Waldo Lydecker, is the man who shares the memories of Laura.  Webb is perfect in the role, and expertly delivers the best lines in the  movie.  Vincent Price and Judith Anderson are both very good as Laura's  fiance and aunt, and as suspects in her murder.  And a painfully beautiful  Gene Tierney is Laura, the woman that men can't help but want.  There's a  haunted quality to the film in the way it is shot, using shadows and  darkness to excellent effect, plus an unforgettable score that is used  repeatedly to great effect.  The screenplay is full of great lines and the  characters may not be people you'd like to meet in real life, but they are  fascinating to watch.  This is a must-see for film fans.",959385600,13,1176,4.611650485436893
