6130314,1,B009OI51ZS,"I love dance movies, and this isn't one. There was two main dance sequences and neither was good. There are hundreds of serious, talented, and out of work dancers that would have been better in this roll. The story line needed work as well, I can forgive a story line if the dancing is out of this world but this movie was below par on everything.",1357257600,2,347,4.2727272727272725
6130315,5,B009OI51ZS,"If you love musicals this a must see movie for you. Very well done, the movie is one of those feel good movies that makes you happy after you watch it. The music is great the dancing was fun to watch. A must for musical movie lovers.",1350518400,3,233,3.978723404255319

8629623,1,B009OI51ZS,"Bless their hearts, this just doesn't make the grade. Was this a student film? I like most every dance flick and I didn't like anything about this one. The dancing was mostly repeated hand gestures, choreography sucked. I've seen productions far better than this at my kid's recitals.",1490054400,,284,4.9375

8629625,1,B009OI51ZS,"How this ever got a 6.1/10 rating on IMDB is defies any rational thought. Thankfully short, this comes off as an attempt to capture the trials and tribulations of becoming a dance star, but it looks like it was shot with an old VHS camcorder, with no decent lighting, poor sound quality, and then slapped together as a long, non-linear MTV disco music video. I thought disco died in 1979, but that's the garbage they play throughout and it jumps directly from an audition to a synchronized dance in the parking lot, which was bad enough, to a premier at looks like it is in a small school gym. Nothing is clear enough to even see. The quality is incredibly poor. There are no spoilers here. Very little makes sense.",1479945600,,715,4.507692307692308
8629626,1,B009OI51ZS,"I've seen better movie quality from some at home cameras. The majority of the film is done while the dancers are on a stage that washes them out. There's no plot line. You can't always hear the characters because the sound wasn't captured correctly.
Overall, a very amateur video and I don't recommend it at all.",1400889600,2,312,4.589285714285714

8629628,1,B009OI51ZS,"No plot.  No talent.  Acting, Direction, Choreography were all terrible.  I watched it all of the way through hoping for something for my money...didn't exist.  Waste of time and money.",1363824000,4,185,5.066666666666666
8629629,1,B009OI51ZS,"It seemed like a home video rather than a professionally done film.  Only 30 minutes long, simplistic plot and dancing was not very good.",1360368000,4,137,4.708333333333333
8629630,1,B009OI51ZS,"The description of this thing is so off base.  Poorly filmed, poorly edited, poorly acted, poorly written.  The ""poster"" doesn't ever show up in the movie.  The filming is so bad you often cannot hear the ""dialogue"" and the picture breaks up constantly.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!",1359763200,4,290,4.74
8629631,1,B009OI51ZS,"Obviously shot very low budget.  Guessing Digital SLR was used because film is really choppy. Editing was more of a show reel style of editing than movie editing. There was some inconsistancies in the film scences like she had her coat than then didn't. Lighting was decent but could have been better.  Script developement really needed some work, they didn't build the story enough to really forfill viewer need for aniticipation and forfillment when climax was reached.  It jumped to quickly to Resolution at climax without really telling us how she felt, showing us the moment she knew she had the part and her emotions reguarding that.  Also completely left out mothers reaction which was part of the story line, verses fathers reaction and the conflict associated with that. Actors might have had talent but were not directed well and were working with subpar script.  All and all potential was there for great story, but needed better vision in telling the story.",1359504000,2,969,4.95679012345679
