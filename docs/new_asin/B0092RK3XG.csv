8534824,5,B0092RK3XG,Mr. Wilhelm gives you a check system to use before riding your horse each day.  He also gives you clear exercises to get your horse listening to you.  He tells you how to move each body part to get your horse responsive and paying attention to you.  I like his simple instructions and easy manner of explaining things.,1385251200,2,318,4.448275862068965
