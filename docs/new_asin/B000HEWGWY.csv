8139395,5,B000HEWGWY,"The English Inspector Linley TV series is a delight, filled with interesting character actors and unusual crimes. In this episode, a woman is killed, shot in the back with a shotgun in her kitchen as she is looking out of a window at a man who is watching her house. The murderer curiously lugs her body out to the field where it is discovered by a poacher. Why did he remove the body? The poacher calls the local policeman, a somewhat elderly, seemingly incompetent man, who walks all over the site and tramples it with his foot print before summoning Linley and his sergeant Havers. Both Linley and Havers have personal problems. Linley's pregnant wife was in a car accident and lost her child. Havers is recovering psychologically from a gunshot wound.

 Beside the question of the removal of the body, Linley needs to discover answers to other questions before he can solve the murder. The murdered victim was having sex moments before her murder. Someone sends Linley a picture of the murdered woman and a man in the middle of a field. The sister of the victim committed suicide some years back and the coroner's report indicates that while she clearly committed suicide, she has marks on her body indicating she struggled with someone. A man disappeared within a very short time after the suicide and everyone tells Lindley that he moved to somewhere in the north of England. Someone breaks into the victim's house after the murder and writes a strange word on the wall. What is the relevance of these facts?",1308009600,,1514,4.731060606060606
8139396,4,B000HEWGWY,I have seen better Lynley episodes but this one is above average.  This is the standard British 'who dunnit' with lots of great English scenery and many twists and turns in the plot.  The ending struck me as a bit silly and somewhat unbelievable but these are made for TV and entertainment.  I am a car nut so footage  ofthe old Bristol is usually enough to entertain me.,1307232000,,371,4.411764705882353
8139397,4,B000HEWGWY,It's eh. I only got it for Richard Armitage so I don't really recommend this as a must see unless you're obsessed with Richard Armitage. then I say go for it.,1266883200,2,158,4.129032258064516
8139398,5,B000HEWGWY,"This review was actually written by my wife Melanie:  Havers returns to work after having recovered from gunshot wound to investigate with Lynley the shooting of a beautiful woman involved in more than just an adultrous affair in the rural Suffolk village where she was raised.  Samantha and husband had recently purchased and begun renovation of an old priory with plans to run an elegant country inn for tourists when murder intervened. When Havers and Lynley begin their investigation, dark secrets emerge about more than the murder victim--there are other secrets in the village that Havers and Lynley must uncover to find Samantha's killer.

The pastoral shots of Suffolk or wherever it was shot are great; I would  watch the episode just for those!  This episode probes deeper into Haver's soul; you can almost ""smell the fear"" as it emanates from her in the hostage scene. The hostage scene builds effectively in intensity; I was on the edge of my seat. The relationship between Havers and Lynley matures and deepens as a result of Haver's hostage experience:  Lynley expresses real concern not only for Haver's physical safety, but for her emotional recovery after the shooting and hostage experiences.  He is not so entirely and narrowly focused on his problems with estranged wife Helen.  Lynley and Havers emerge from this episode with a stronger, closer partnership and a better appreciation and respect for one another.

Richard Armitage fans will enjoy a very good performance by him as Phillip Turner, the victim's lover.  If you don't know Richard Armitage, he is the very fine actor who was John Thorton in BBC's ""North and South"" (Amazon sells the DVD, and if you liked RA in this, you'll love him in N&S).  By the way, Amazon should have this DVD ""In Divine Proportion"" listed under ""The Works of Richard Armitage"" also!",1163203200,13,1839,4.957654723127036
