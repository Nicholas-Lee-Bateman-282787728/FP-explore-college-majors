7912774,1,B00000JN22,"There are dozens of tapes/dvds out there that teach more than 2-3 moves!

Not worth the money.",1162252800,,94,4.529411764705882
7912775,5,B00000JN22,Being a wrestler since 1967 and coach since 1995 this tape gives to the novice wrestler and parent the best understanding of wrestling that I have found.  The tapes succintly provides the basic wrestling rules for the wrestling parent so that they can have a grasp of the rules and immediately enjoy the sport.  The tapes go on to develop winning wrestling strategies that are universal to all winning students of the sport.  I highly recommend these tapes to all wrestling programs who want to start a winning path from the beginning.,1063584000,2,535,4.793478260869565

7912777,5,B00000JN22,"This is a wonderful video series and I would recommend it to everyone that is serious about wrestling.  I mean the real wrestling, not this fake stuff most kids see on TV.  If you want your kid to learn a characture building sport, get these tapes!",1063238400,,248,4.369565217391305
7912778,4,B00000JN22,"If you have wrestled before, you'll likely not find anything new here. I had NO wrestling experience when I bought these vids, so I enjoyed watching them AND could learn from them (it can be easy to fill a total VOID of knowledge) but I do believe not citing their duration (15' each) on the item description borders on unjust advertising.  The series should be sold as a unit for about 1/2 the price of the collected titles; and probably all be put on 1 tape (or better yet, DVD).",1049587200,5,481,4.344444444444444
7912779,1,B00000JN22,"Unless you have never seen a wrestling match before, this video series is a waste of time and money.  I ordered these after reading the other posted reviews (which said they were great) and was extremely dissatisfied with the teachings and explanations.  They are only 15 minutes in length and cover only the most basic moves, moves learned in the first week of any quality wrestling program.  They do not explain the rules in full and lack the explicit detail needed to execute any move to it's fullest advantage.  I give it a 1 star rating only because I could not give it a zero.",1041552000,6,582,4.514285714285714
7912780,5,B00000JN22,Four years ago I started the first wrestling program at any age level in northeast Louisiana.  The nearest high school program was 90 miles due west and the nearest kids' program 300 miles due south.  Needless to say I went  through a lot of books and videos trying to find the easiest and most  effective techniques and the best winning strategies and philosophies.  I  could have saved a lot of time and effort and been producing state  champions a lot sooner if Win The Winning Edge had been around then.,952819200,8,507,4.566666666666666
