8441722,4,B004ULEF8S,"I first saw this in the theater, lo, those many decades ago. Being the same age as the protagonist, I thought it better than I do now, but it still retains a great deal of charm. It is primarily a ""slice of life"" drama of coming of age in the early 50s, with a boyish early-20s small-town midWest protagonist (well played by Hulce in his pre-Amadeus port-Animal House period) who is the first in his family to go to college, and who is aiming for Med School. The problem is, he's bored with it, and he takes on a summer job as  the ""prop man"" for a small actor's troop in his smallish town. (remember, this is early 50s, so not a lot on TV, if anything, so entertainment options are limited -- ""Summer Stock"" plays were a popular way to get out of the house on a warm summer night). While there, his starry eyes get him enamored of both the play and a young starlet. Meanwhile, he is also taken under the wing of an experienced showman and lead actor played to perfection by Frank Langella, whose prime goal is to make it ""to the big time"" and graduate from Summer Stock to a more mainstream gig on or at least a bit off Broadway.

The result is a good ""coming of age"" film. Not spectacular but pleasant, and an eye towards what life was like, in some ways, in the pleasanter parts of post WWII America.",1443744000,,1303,4.228915662650603
8441723,5,B004ULEF8S,"One of the best movies about the theater. For anyone who has ever done summer stock or community theater, there will be a great number of scenes that seem very familiar to them. Frank Langella gets to chew the scenery, Glynnis O'Connor is at her most beautiful, and Tom Hulce was just off of ""Animal House"" and a couple of years away from ""Amadeus"" (this was the only film he did in the interim).
""Those Lips, Those Eyes"" was overlooked at the time and pretty much forgotten since. But it is a very good movie, and should be a ""must see"" for theater folk.",1424995200,2,555,4.346153846153846
8441724,5,B004ULEF8S,saw this film in the theatre and adored frank langella .  better on the big screen as are most movies.,1393027200,,102,4.1
8441725,5,B004ULEF8S,"When you refer to buried treasure this film comes to mind.  I don't even think this was wide released when it came out in 1980.  Regardless it's a charmer.  Director Michael Pressman definitely evokes time, place, and a communal feeling which in this case is an outdoor ampatheater in suburban Cleveland in 1951 where mostly neophytes or hasbeens ply their trade.  Scurrying about are the various performers, mostly young, waiting for their big break which could be Broadway or a touring company through the Great Plains states.  The crafts people are to the side some contemptuous of the artists.  The spotlight shines brightest on the show's star Harry Crystal(Frank Langella).  Prior to the Great War Harry was an up-and-comer on the Great White Way but losing five years to the Army cost him dearly and he's trying to get back to the big leagues.  Harry's not a prima donna and is very supportive of his less seasoned colleagues but he is at wits end waiting for the call from his agent to say New York beckons.  Langella is the glue that holds the film together demonstrating pluckishness, resignation, but mainly desperation.  With this multi-hued performance Langella elevates the film.  There is a side romance between a prop man, Artie(Thomas Hulce), and a lead dancer, Ramona(Glynnis O'Connor) that is of mild interest but more distracting of the big picture but doesn't scuttle the film.  This sleeper is definitely worth the while.",1379203200,3,1443,4.966666666666667
8441726,3,B004ULEF8S,"It was a purchase based on sentiment more so than anything else, and it was ok.. I'm glad I have it.",1372464000,,100,3.8095238095238093
8441727,5,B004ULEF8S,"Why this delightful film seems to be forgotten today is a mystery to me. It is wonderful from first to last. Glynnis O'Connor and Frank Langella head up a spot-on cast with a bittersweet look at both the spell the theater casts over those who practice its arts as well as the less glamorous reality behind the ""tinsel and glitter."" I had seen this film multiple times both in its original theatrical run and when it ran on the premium cable cables (HBO & Cinemax) in the 1980's. Then it seemed to vanish.

I'm so glad the Warners Archives has finally released it on DVD. Well worth a watch from anyone who loves the theater and who wants to remember when you were young and all things seemed possible.",1361059200,12,701,4.434108527131783
8441728,5,B004ULEF8S,"Without demeaning or bad-mouthing other celebrities, Frank Lagella impressed with his insider's view of fellow personalities from politics and show business, and did it in a highly impressive and literate prose. One of those hard-to-put-down books that can be read in one sitting or kept in the john for snippets catching.",1357084800,,322,5.333333333333333
