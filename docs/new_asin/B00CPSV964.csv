Three worlds (2012) is an intriguing, challenging and chillling drama that involves three people, whose lives experience a painful crossway. A terrible car acccident, an unexpected witness and a wealthy man whose career was ascending.

Since that sinister event, you will be in the middle of a very solid plot. Dazzling cast and amazing stress will leave you breathless.

Go for it!!!",1472342400,,471,5.184210526315789
