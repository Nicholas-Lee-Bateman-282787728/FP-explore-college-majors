2659599,5,B000ION2BW,"Although it has been almost a year since ""Full Metal Panic! - The Second Raid"" premiered in Japan, US fans can finally rejoice over the release of the long-awaited sequel to one of the most unlikely hits in recent Anime history. With the same cast of delightful characters, wonderfully original story, and fabulous art and character design, the ""Full Metal Panic"" franchise comes to a thrilling and unexpected ending that will not leave a single fan unsatisfied.

Although peace seemed to return to the life of our young hero, Sousuke Sagara at the end of Season 1, it's certainly not easy being a teenage mercenary-soldier-elite being called to battles all over the world AND trying to protect his lovely high-school friend Kaname Chidori at the same time. Things don't get any easier for Mithril either, when on a routine mission in a remote third-world country, it is discovered that rogue governments have acquired anti-ECS (Electronic Cloaking System) technology, as well as other high-tech weaponry which poses a threat unlike any Mithril has faced before. Tasked with hunting down the organization responsible for distributing such technology is the famous Uruz Team, consisting of our old friends Mao, Kurz, and Sousuke. In the process of hunting down this mysterious organization - known only as ""Amalgam"" - Sousuke struggles with both his own troubled emotions as well as new enemies - including two merciless, young female assassins. And just when it seems things are at their worst, Sousuke receives the unthinkable order - to return to base - permanently. Nothing is certain in this thrilling conclusion - not even Death.

Without a doubt, ""Full Metal Panic! - The Second Raid"" is perhaps one of the best Anime SEQUELS ever made - I stress the word ""Sequel"" to avoid any misinterpretations. Brought back once more is the fantastic original cast and crew, including the English Dub (Funimation purchased the rights for ""The Second Raid"", but the cast is the same as the ADV Original dubs of the first two). Also returning is Music Composer Toshihiko Sahashi, whose capable hands craft another great soundtrack. And once again, Shoji Gatoh's writing creates a fantastic story, even-further-developed characters, and an unforgettable experience overall. This Anime is still one of my absolute favorites, and will most likely be so for a very long time to come.

Note - There is no word yet on whether this DVD set (released by Funimation Entertainment) will contain the 2006-released OAV, starring Teletha Testarossa. However, as with most OAVs, one can hope that it will be released as a special feature/additional episode in the final disc. But again, it is not certain yet.",1161993600,20,2686,5.086167800453515
2659600,5,B000ION2BW,"I personally have not seen the second season of full metal panic.  But I own the first season and have seen all of the third season.  First off you don't need to see the 2nd season (fumoffu or whatever its called) to understand the 3rd.  Story pretty much continues where the first season leaves off with Sagara being the only one who can pilot arbalist.  I won't spoil anything for you so Ill comment on the content and give a minor synapse of the story.  This season is only 13 episodes long.

Plot - is very good, has a few holes where you could potentially get confused but eh doesnt everything.  Other then those few plot holes it is a very solid story and very entertaining.  I found myself routing for Sousuke Sagara throughout the story wanting him to win fights, and of course get the girl.

Animation - I Prefer high quality animation that is animophoric and widescreen with DTS or atleast 5.1 sound.  This season is widescreen (not sure if its animophoric as details are not up on the site yet and I saw sub version from japan)  Nor am I sure about it being 2.0 or 5.1 sound hopefully its the later if not it still sounded good.  The CGI is beatiful needless to say.

Action - My personal favorite part, this season has about twice as much action compared to the first season.  Sousuke Sagara most master the Arbalist to survive and cant relay solely on luck anymore.

Character design - 95% of the charaters in this anime are well designed and given a good amount of detail considering theres only 13 episodes to do this.  The main villian is a little weak as far as villians go.  And some characters have brief apperance that makes you wonder why bother even put them in the story (hopefully that just means theres another season after this one).

Conclusion:

This was one of the best anime's Ive seen.  Great animation, lots of action, good story that sucks you into the plot and makes you want to know whats going to happen next.  I would certainly reccomend checking this series out if you liked full metal panic season 1 or 2.

So those reading this can understand my taste Ill post a few other animes that I enjoyed and would also recommend so you can see if you have similar taste to mine or not.

8146717,5,B000ION2BW,"FMP TSR is the 3rd season of FMP. It follows FMP, and FMP Fumoffu. The animation quality is way better in this season than in the previous 2. All of the characters return and so do the Arm Slaves. The AS's are even more awesome in TSR. The voice actors are all the same and the music is still great. My only complaint is that the ending leaves you hanging really bad. It pretty much ends with all sorts of bad guys ready to pounce and the team of the TDD ready to take them on. I loved this series but was very disappointed by the ending. Ive been waiting for them to end it for years, but no luck. I still have hope though. Even though it's not resolved this anime is incredible. You should definitely give it a look see.",1353888000,,722,4.091549295774648

8146719,5,B000ION2BW,Full Metal Panic the second raid captures the creativity of the the first series and brind all the action back that was M.I.A. in FMP:F. This is definatly the best action anime on the current scene.,1168905600,,198,4.527777777777778
8146720,5,B000ION2BW,"After a slight comedic detour with Fumoffu, Full Metal Panic has returned to the roots of its first anime version, which focused more on the action and drama with interludes of humor. Like the first season, The Second Raid alternates between the the dangerous missions of Mithril and the almost as dangerous interactions between Sousuke and Chidori at school. As this excellent first volume begins, Sousuke and his team, the beautiful Mao and the perverted pretty boy Kurz are sent in to take out a despotic dictator who's managed to get his hands on some highly advanced weapons technology. We are also introduced to the main villain of the piece, a insane psychotic named Gates who is a cross between the charming personalities of the Joker and Darth Vader. The thing that makes him more of a threat is that he operates a Venom AS equipped with the Lambda Driver similar to the one Gauron used to almost kill Sousuke in the first show. But unlike Sousuke, he can activate the Driver at will. Sagara is beginning to lose hope that he will ever be able to control its power. But he might not have to worry too much longer, because Gates's plan is to seize Sagara's AS for himself. And he's got two deadly assassins and spies in Mithril to help him out.

This first volume started out a little rough at the edges because the transitions from Fumoffu style school hijinks to two killer sisters touching each other inappropriately in the shower just didn't gel. When the show focuses on one aspect, either the comedy, or the action/drama, it works incredibly well. But when it mixes the two in the same episode, it seems unnatural. Thankfully most of the dvd does the former. Even though this is rated for ages 14 and up, there is some full on nudity, and some extremely graphic violence. For example, a Mithril agent gets his throat cut with a knife in extreme closeup with nothing left to the imagination. The animation overall is incredible for a TV show and the writing is also pretty good, especially in the episodes where the Mithril team walks into a trap in a tunnel labyrinth, which really ratchets up the suspense. Excellent start to the series.

DVD EXTRAS:

There is short bonus episode that is really a teaser trailer for the series. There are also three extremely interesting documentaries: The first is a Japanese Self-Defense Tour exhibition that the show's staff attended to get reference for the vehicles and weapons used in FMP. The second is location shooting in Hong Kong by the director and author of the novels which is a nice tour of the city. Finally, there is a brief history of the Light Novel in Japan, with a focus on the publisher of the FMP books. Also includes clean opening/closing.",1166659200,10,2712,4.681341719077568
8146721,5,B000ION2BW,"This is one original anime series, the story from the beginning has been taken from a Novel, instead of a Manga. I love the smart characters and even smarter plot line for the series. In a genre saturated with clone mecha anime, Full Metal Panic was a breath of fresh air, having the elements of well-written cohesive dialogue, stunning visuals, great music, and fabulous storylines primarily thanks to the genius of Japanese author Shouji Gatou. This third series, delivers the same elements found in the 1st and 2nd series.

This first volume of ""The 2nd Raid"" (TSR) series starts with a new enemy for Mithril and hidden dangers for Kaname Chidori; Sousuke Sagara in the meantime is faced with doubts about how he can handle Mithril's foremost Arm Slave(AS), the Arbalest. The new enemy is even more insane than Gauron and with him are two young female assassins that have a hidden agenda. The plot so far makes for a promising start to a series filled with conspiracies.",1164412800,5,973,4.791666666666667
8146722,5,B000ION2BW,"Based off the short Novel ""End of Day by Day"" by Shoji Gatoh, The Second Raid certainly lives up to its name. It truly is a second raid on the show. While not entirely revolutionary in the world of Mecha anime, Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid retains the same over-the-top marriage of Giants Robots and school comedy, with an emphasis on the robots this time around.

All the characters are back from season one, and have gotten a graphical overhaul. Kyoto Animation, perhaps most well known for producing the show Inu Yasha, has given the characters new life. The animation is smooth and rounder, and most often much darker and gritty than when Gonzo animated the first season. Kyoto was the same animation company who did ""Fumoffu?"" so many fans are already familiar with their work. The Mechas are back and look better than ever as well, with plenty of action and battle scenes for those who don't quite dig the romantic comedy aspect of the show.

I can't say enough about the story without giving it away, but all I can say is it flows much better than the first season did. The Second Raid is half the length of the first season and packs all the action from the novel into the story, with a few extra episodes added on as well. The shows flows nicely from episode to episode, making you want to watch them all in one sitting. With few lags in the plot you will most likely be left wanting more at the end, but don't worry. As long as Shoji Gatoh hasn't stopped writing novels and short stories (which he hasn't), there will always be more Panic!",1162857600,6,1554,4.46830985915493
8146723,5,B000ION2BW,"If you have seen the first season and were put off by the comedy emphasis of the second season, take heart. FMP is back better than ever, with a gripping story, compelling art, and some intense action. If you liked Evangellion, Madlax, Gost in the Shell, Noir or R.O.D. you will be thrilled with this series, despite the strange divergence into parody during the prior season. Second Raid is top-notch.",1162684800,5,402,4.757142857142857
8146724,5,B000ION2BW,"To begin with, I will try to give a detailed and overall plot summary of the entire series -as much as it is possible- without giving to many spoilers away but SPOILERS WILL BE INCLUDED! Therefore, if you don't want to be given anything away to you, than do not read further.

First of all, as I described the first season this series have something for everyone and I do recommend them to anyone!

To the story:

First of all, the story starts where the first season ended (with a few `modifications' made). The anime begins with Mithril being involved in military attacks in the Baltic region while its leader has acquired advanced weaponry technology anti-ECS missile (missile able to detect systems with ECS invisibility). In order to protect hellicopters filled with refuges Sousuke must use the the Arbalest's Lambda Driver, which he still tries to learn how to control. Later on, the viewer will be introduced to the main villain of the series, Gates, who is a member of an organization called Amalgam and basically opposes Mithril and was the one which provided the leader of the Baltic nation with the advanced weaponry. We are also introduced to Xia Yu Fan and Xia Yu Lan, twin sisters who we later learn were raised by Gauron.

After a school side-story, the next mission takes us to Nanjiing, so that Mithri can safe hostages. There, Mao wil hide between the hostages by pretending she is one of them, will have to fight against Xia Yu Lan; Kurz Weber (who is piloting the only Zy-98 Shadow-type Arm Slave in the battle) will have to fight against Xia Yu Fan and Sousuke (who asked to take a M9 instead of Arbalest was denied because he is the only one who can operate the Arbalest and the Lambda Driver) will be left alone with the unreliable Lambda driver to deal with Gates, who is operating a Venom-type Arm Slave. During this battles we will also witness some betray going on (sorry guys, if I say more I will take the suspense away).

Yet, we should also not forget that a love-story between the two main protagonists is going on which will become apparent during Sousuke's constant absences from school and that Kaname becomes worried about him in many aspects; while Mao will start to worry about him as well. Sousuke, starts to reflect upon his own feelings about Kaname and would prefer to remain a student by her side instead of being a soldier etc. Furthermore, and going through various `misinterpretations'  that Sousuke Sagara usually does, Kaname and him get closer and he realizes how much Kaname is depending on him. The specific episode ends when Sousuke (who is beginning to realize his feelings for Kaname) is ordered to withdraw from guarding Kaname immediately, with all guard duties being entrusted to another agent, codenamed ""Wraith.""

 After being called back, Sousuke falls into a slight depression, not wanting to pilot the Arbalest and wishing he were back at Jindai High. We are introduced to the new Uruz-1, Lieutenant Belfangan Groseaux. He tests Sousuke's ability with the Arbalest, a test Sousuke fails miserably. Meanwhile Kaname is becoming increasingly suspicious that someone is following her. She discovers that Sousuke has left for good and realizes she is now completely alone. She decides to find out who is following her, and through a series of events discovers Wraith, who informs her that aside from himself, someone else seems to be following her. We discover this person is Xia Yu Lan, the younger twin. She shoots Wraith and then attacks Kaname. Kaname escapes, but is pursued and manages to surprise Yu Lan and shoot her with a Taser. After this she is met by Leonard Testarossa, Tessa's brother and a fellow Whispered. He is an agent of Amalgam and has orders to kill Yu Lan. He orders one of his bodyguards (a miniature AS unit) to kill her. When this is done he expresses that he seems to have fallen in love with Kaname and steals her first kiss, which infuriates her. In exchange for her forgiveness, Leonard allows her to take back Wraith who seems to still be alive.

To make the long story short the viewer will follow the Mithril team to another mission, this time in Hong Kong, in which power games and betrays will go on and someone is piloting an AS unit eqiuped with a Lamda Driver as well. In terms of `performance' Sousuke will hit rock bottom and fails completely because he cannot concentrate due to reoccurring thoughts of Kaname. These distraction eventually cause him to crash the vehicle he is driving. Mao tells him she won't work with him unless he can focus. Sousuke realizes he can't and abandons the mission. Meanwhile tensions between North and South China force Mithril to order an assault on the enemy AS before it is found. While they battle the AS, Sousuke wanders through Hong Kong, eventually meeting a Chinese Woman who resembles Chidori. He goes with her to her apartment, most likely to have sex, but due to her appearance thoughts of Chidori constantly fill his mind; (don't worry, He decides to leave) ending up wandering in the streets and meets an old enemy who amongst other things tells him that Kaname died. Sousuke kills him, this time for good. Meanwhile, Mithril is in great need of Sousuke and Tessa orders that Sousuke is been send the Arbalest so that he can rejoin the team and defeat the enemy; but, his will to fight is gone. Without Kaname he is lost.

As Sousuke tries to leave he is confronted with Kaname, who used Wraith to find Sousuke. After beating him up she tells him he needs to pilot the Arbalest and save everyone. Feeling renewed confidence at seeing Kaname alive Souske finally realizes that he is the only one who can pilot the Arbalest and works together with the Al to fully make use of the Lambda Driver.

The final episode, is basically the climax of the show and when the main villain is about to kill everyone Sousuke arrives just in time, makes full use of the Lamda Drive and saves everyone.

The Second Raid ends with Sousuke finally understanding what he wants to do with his life: Pilot the Arbalest for Mithril and attend school with Kaname. He works out a deal with Mithril that allows him to do just that. We are left with both Kaname and Sousuke having realized their feelings for each other, but neither of them being able to admit it.

Now, a few details about the series besides the story:

- It is 13 episodes long but fully pacted with action, the viewer will go through an emotional rolercoaster, has many twists, solid story and is by far the strongest season of all three.

- The animation is even upgraded when comparing it with the first season

- Music and dub are perfectly orchestrated

- As for the price, a logical concern to everyone, well, it is the typical as the usuall price of anime (the price spectrum usually varies between 23 - 29 dollars.)

To sum up, if you liked the first and second season, than this one is defenitely highly recommended for you.

I hope that I could help ^_^",1162598400,6,6950,4.663398692810458
