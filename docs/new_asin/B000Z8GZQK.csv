A lot of the moves she did in this dvd, she did in her Dance Off The Inches Sizzling Salsa dvd workout. I tend to catch on to dances quick. I like that she repeats the dances. Repetition is always good in a dance workout. It helps the person learn the steps and before they know it, they will know it like the back of their hands.

I'm glad for my Core Rhythms workouts as well. They have helped me with this workout as well.

Stellla has another dvd that's out already or coming out. I hope to get that one soon.

I recommend this workout to anyone that loves doing latin dance workouts.

The workout goes so fast. To me, it didn't feel like I have done a 50 minute workout.",1290038400,,826,4.14375
8235097,3,B000Z8GZQK,"The footwork is tricky, you definitely have to be intermediately experienced with latin dances.  Not for a cardio beginner or lazy exerciser, or someone looking to learn about latin dance.  Great to adding to a workout schedule because you will definitely lose inches as you work your legs the ENTIRE time.",1245715200,,306,4.980392156862745
