3703081,5,B001MYIPXW,"This film ran on Bill Moyers Journal on 26 Dec. 2008...a remarkable film that focuses upon the idea that religion(s) and mankind should make an effort to realize that all religions and peoples have much in common, and good reason to explore the positive likes and ignore the negative dislikes that cause wars and so very much suffering.  The world would certainly be a much better, more positive place if this could be put into practice.",1230249600,32,437,4.75

3703113,5,B001MYIPXW,"...the beauty of Truth. It's so simple, its complexity is at the level of a child's understanding. It's right before our eyes and yet many can't see it. We saw it as kids, then we forgot as adults. Were you an evil child? Is any child evil? Of course not. You want to make Love a complex, intellectual message? You can't. This documentary is not saying ""any religion will do"". It makes no commentary or judgement on any specific religion at all. In the film, Deepak said ""Buddha wasn't Buddhist. Jesus wasn't Christian."" It speaks to the core spiritual foundation of all religions. That is why it is titled ""Beyond Our Differences"".

You wanted to watch a movie that debated the differences between religions and postured one against the other.....you picked the wrong film. Sam Harris is an author who makes a valid argument about ""Coexist"". If there is ever to be peace on earth, yet the seeds of conflict remain between religions, then how can ""Coexist"" be worth the ink used to print the bumper sticker? He says all religions should end and I don't agree or disagree, but I know that isn't going to happen anytime soon. If religions really and truly could coexist, and there is no reason they cannot other than their own bigotry, then Coexist would work just fine. That is what this film is saying, without actually saying it.

I do not criticize the ""Coexist"" idea simply because we do not have a better solution at the moment. The Bible and the Qur'an and The Dhammapada have cultural significance to the people who read them. It is their heritage, their anchor to the past and their ancestors. Tech loving, modern Americans like myself don't understand the need to be tied to words written 5000 years ago....but I have to respect it. And any of the books I mentioned are actually fairly positive, with the exception that in a few places they immortalize ancient laws like women are not equal. As a woman, I'd like those parts removed please.

Thousands of years ago, they didn't have DNA testing. They didn't have banks and lawyers. The economic structure was based on the first born son inheriting the father's wealth. If the mother slept around, there would be no knowing who the real dad was. So women were limited in freedom. It was written into the religious text and unfortunately people today can't make the distinction between what Jesus was talking about and what someone who didn't understand his message wrote down in a book about it. They worship the words written down on pages and fail to fully understand the Truth of what Jesus meant. Jesus would never hate a gay person, yet some Christians do. Any sane person realizes the hypocrisy of that.

So yes, I have a problem with Coexist but I don't have a problem with this film. I thought it was beautiful and well done. Another topic that could be dragged into this is science vs religion, but that's another area that will require an enduring commitment to peaceful coexistence.

The real problem is that people can't respect differences. And power, money hungry governments are able to easily exploit that weakness and manipulate the masses. How is it that the Christian majority supported George W Bush while he supported war that killed and maimed and orphaned thousands of innocent children? Because the Christian majority lacks critical thinking skills. Jesus said ""turn the other cheek"". He didn't say seek blood thirsty revenge within hours of a 9/11 terrorist attack. A trillion dollars later, the US is in huge debt. Thank you Christian majority. Why should I support your church? I love Jesus but I have no respect for the mindless pastors of mega churches in Texas who told millions of followers to support Bush and the war and helped him get re-elected.

So yes....Coexist is an issue. But the problem is not with the content in this film. I'm a spiritual person who thinks critically and also believes in higher power and have had spiritual experiences of my own similar to those Jesus and Buddha were trying to share. This film is correct. Perhaps they will make a sequel that can discuss what I said here. People like myself need not defend my spiritual beliefs in this world, but pastors of mega churches who support war under the guise of Christianity certainly do. Christian means ""Christ-like"". To be like Jesus Christ. I have said these exact things to Christians and what do they say in reply? ""Jesus would have wanted us to retaliate in war."" Oh really? Did you read your own Bible?",1420416000,,4476,4.732051282051282
3703114,5,B001MYIPXW,Great story making...placing two unlikely people from two different cultures together in extraordinary circumstances in a far off land where they find true love.

3703118,3,B001MYIPXW,"A decent movie. The main premise can be boiled down to a few sentences. For religious or new age folks, more may likely be derived from the movie, but for a humanist and skeptic like myself, my time would have been better spent elsewhere. It would've been nice to see a humanist interviewed with all of the religious and new age people too.",1416182400,2,340,4.412698412698413
3703119,2,B001MYIPXW,"PBS doesn't disappoint in this film with anti-Christian undertones written by a Muslim Imam.  Not once was the name of Jesus Christ ever mentioned.  Yes, ""Christ"" was mentioned with 7:11 left in the film by a priest.  Not one single evangelical Christian was interviewed.  God was mentioned several times by all those interviewed, but as a god for that specific religion.  Muslims interviewed represented Islam as peaceful. Van Jones never mentions Jesus Christ (or God) that I can recall, but mentions ""faith"" numerous times as a force within the person that has faith.  Hindus, Buddhists, Catholics, Anglican Bishops and Jewish Rabbis are center stage. Fundamentalists such as the Taliban and Christian Crusaders were mentioned as oppressive and violent.

Those interviewed include Karon Armstrong, Paulo Coelho, Desmond Tutu, Dali Lama, Mohammed Khatani (President of Iran for some time); Daniel Shapiro, Lily Habash, Noah Salameh, Sadhguru, Peter Gabriel, Depak Chopra, Gilbert Bond, Lord Carey of Clifton and many others (some names may be misspelled).

The thesis of the film is religious peace and reconciliation and how each religion must get along - Christianity was left out.  A lop-sided film.  The Bible New Testament (Matthew) was quoted on screen a few of times as Christian and the Bible Old Testament (Deuteronomy was quoted as Jewish).

Martin Luther King was said to be a follower of Gandhi.  Not once was his movement associated with Christianity or the Bible.  MLK did promote non-violence which leads me to think about those people in Ferguson, MO who have been nothing but violent (shame).

I suppose if the film was just focused on world religions then the author is very accurate since Christianity is NOT a religion in a sense that it is not like the other religions.  Other world religions are man-made; Christianity is God-made.  If you are considering buying this film - save your money.",1415836800,2,1915,5.148867313915858

3703153,2,B001MYIPXW,"A few minutes in I see Van Jones a self proclaimed communist labeled at the bottom of the screen as ""Human Rights Champion""........ if you say so. The last time I checked communism had a very bad humanitarian record. The film made some good points about peace and tolerants but came off as kind of random, boring and lacked philosophical depth which depth is ripe for the picking when it comes to talking about God. The film leaving  me  asking......... ""Whats your point? or.... was that it?"". It seemed to me that the film tried to project that all faiths are created equil which is adsurd. Some faiths spawn freedom and the acknowledgment of natural individual rights and others tyranny and contentment with inequality. I don't have a problem with most of the individuals in this film just primarily the ill composed message. The generic ""any religion will do"" feeling I got from this film gave it a godless aftertaste and made me realize it's a social acceptance film not a religios one. Like standing at a religion buffet and someone with no taste buds telling you just pick one it doesn't make much difference they're all about the same pretending that the item on the buffet that will put you in cardiac arrest isn't much different then the item that will give you a long healthy life. This film is a composition of short soundbites and short scripture quotes which is red flag when I see that because it allows context to be easily manipulated. While tring to maintain the image of being positive it cherry picks various quotes to pretend all religion is equal. If someone told me that this film was made for children it would make more sense due to simplicity of the message which is ""can't we all just get along"" but I would still not have kids watch this film because of certain overly simplistic aspects and not to mention flat out ignoring the existence of evil.",1364428800,12,1875,4.627627627627628

It follows the lives of people practicing faith and explore meanings of peace and how to achieve it.
It gives great insight into each religion, its views and some real people who practice it.
I fell in love what professors and diplomats had to say about religion. It was profound and inspiring.

Bottom line is, what I got from this was that religion comes in all forms, that however doesn't mean there is no God, just that we all worship our creator in a different way. All religions are based on the same premis of loving each other and lifting each other up through the hard places. Our main goal should be to bring peace to the world and follow the common morals of life.",1360540800,,725,4.451127819548872

3703160,3,B001MYIPXW,"This movie did what it explained in the description, it told us why and how all religions of the world are essentially alike, most by terms of preaching non-violence. First for the positives- this movie did a nice job connecting modern-day topic to old teachings and seeing how we disobey the original religious laws given to us. Some of the people that talked on screen had some quite interesting ideas, and some stuck in my head such as ""religion was the perfect idea, humans made it a bad idea."" or ""The whole fun of religion is not being sure about most of life's big questions, but still believing in God."" However, these people were not really connected, so rather than having it all in one movie, it seemed very disjointed, and each person had a new, individual point, which gave the movie a lacking sense of unity. That being said, it could have done much better. The ominous music in the background, the toneless cutscenes inside various holy structures, or the random religious people throwing disjoined ideas into the pot, it all did not seem to make sense to have in one movie. Repeating ideas over and over just made me want to skip scenes to points to see whether it would get any more interesting, which disappointed me, because even without skipping, there was not one part that left me wanting more. After 20 minutes of watching, you sit around wondering if you have already heard this person say that before, or if the background video is the same from 15 minutes ago. Out of all the things that bothered me the most, the one that stood out to me was the lack of a story line. The transitions into new ideas were not apparent enough, so skipping around was a common trend. Yes, documentaries are not supposed to have a story line, because there is also no plot, but if you take a look at various different documentaries, such as Michael Moore's, they all have individual stories in them that transition into new ideas. This movie just lacked overall structure, but if you are looking for some insightful quotes or inspiration, this is a marvelous place to begin. If you are looking for a movie that you want to watch entirely, I suggest to stay away, because this movie is best watched in fragments.",1354924800,3,2217,4.601010101010101
3703161,5,B001MYIPXW,"If you are seeking to learn more about the world religions, this will be inspirational for you. You'll see how the seed of spirituality is planted around the Earth. How that seed blooms in different ways. But at the core - we are all the same seed. And if we stop looking for ways in which to be certain we know the Truth, or that we are the intended bloom, we can appreciate the different colors, the different beauty, and yet the samenesss that we all share as people on this Earth. A lovely film.",1354838400,,499,4.2631578947368425
8322521,3,B001MYIPXW,"Purchased from another source.  Good topic, but the program adds little insight.  Just short stories of people from various religions who try to respect other religions, and do good acts in the name of God.

From the title I thought it would be about the religious/political conflicts of today, but it left out reporting on the Christian-Muslim divide and the conflicts between Christian denominations- fundamentalists, middle of the road, and liberal churches.  I thought it would be about how religions can stop fighting and work together.  I guess that is the age-old question, but it seemed the documentary didn't attempt to address it.",1488240000,,640,5.174757281553398
8322522,2,B001MYIPXW,"Well made documentary, but somewhat dated, and repetitious in its message.
I was hoping its 2008 focus on 'love' and 'forgiveness' as key to peaceful co-existence can address today's insanity.
It did not.",1482537600,,204,5.212121212121212

8322525,5,B001MYIPXW,"There are a lot of ways to be different in this world. This video looks primarily at religious differences and gives some excellent insights into how many religions are the same or similar, and continues beyond that to offer reasons and insights into why differences of thought and practice should not lead us to be killing each other, or even hating and misunderstanding. If you aren't familiar with other religions, their practices, and people from other lands, this film is a great introduction, or a good step in continuing your journey toward enlightenment.",1453420800,,562,5.053763440860215
8322526,5,B001MYIPXW,"Great video espoising the notion that all religions contain glimpses of God and are equal in many ways. Favorite quote from a Muslim cleric: A man went to look for God; First, he went to the church and did not find him there. Then, he went to the synagogue and didnot find him there. Then, he went to the mosque and did not find him there. Then, he went home and found God in his own heart.",1445212800,,390,4.077922077922078
