6141970,5,B00H9BFV98,"...the circle finally closes and we will have the answers. The Gold Box DVD set the standard pretty high for the time. A new 4K transfer of FWWM and new transfers of the pilot and series will be amazing.

Man, I need to buy a new TV!",1400198400,3,233,3.9574468085106385
6141971,5,B00H9BFV98,This is great!  The entire series plus a movie!  I ordered this yesterday on Blu-ray for $94.49 from Amazon.  the IMDB rating for this series is 9.0.,1400198400,5,149,4.444444444444445
6141972,5,B00H9BFV98,"Die-hard Twin Peaks fans have been waiting over 20 years to see the deleted and extended scenes from FWWM. Those of us who read the shooting script way back in the day know that much more was shot than ended up in the theatrical cut, with entire characters winding up on the cutting room floor.

The HD transfer of the show (presumably in 4:3 ratio as originally aired), both versions of the pilot, the Log Lady intros, hours of extras....all of that is just ridiculously awesome bonus to the main draw. FWWM junkies would probably pay $100 for a disc of just the deleted scenes alone. That's the real cream of the crop here.

Can't wait to re-up on my Twin Peaks collections and get this truly definitive version this summer.

However, this isn't even the same product, the box is completely different and there are all sorts of symbols on the Blu-ray discs. Turns out it is not a Region 1 US that is listed, this was a Britain released product. My 2 day prime shipping turned into 6 day shipping. Also, I bought this broken version for $39.99, down from the New price of $200+ that was listed at the time, come to find out, there are brand new boxes sold for a cents more than $30 here on Amazon of the EXACT SAME THING. I have to test all the discs and features to make sure its all even compatible and functioning properly.

6141986,3,B00H9BFV98,"Nothing wrong with the disc's or anything like that from what I can tell. My issue is simply with the packaging aka the case. What I received was a giant blu-ray case (it looks ridiculous), with 10 disc's inside, it isn't in a box with imaged off sections, or disc explanations, it's simply a giant blu-ray with 10 disc's inside it. Just a big blu-ray case, had I known it was going to be like this, then I wouldn't have even ordered it. I would advise that the page should be updated to show those whom are buying it, what it actually looks like, because now I have to track down the box set that I wanted in the first place, and pay more money for it.",1519084800,2,653,4.149606299212598

6141988,1,B00H9BFV98,"The series itself gets 5 stars, and is one of my all time favorites, so content is not the issue!

My issue is disc load problems!  I ordered the Blu Ray set, and all was fine until my machine would not load disc 5.  Because the return window had expired by the time I found the issue, I went ahead and paid for a second set, and the new disc 5 was perfect, but now disc 7 will not load!  Tried disc 7 from my spare set and it won't load ether!  Returned one set and just received replacement set number 3, again disc 7 will not load.  I checked around the web, and found a post on a TP website where somebody was seeking a replacement disc 7 for the same problem.  He noted a tiny crack on the edge which prevents play.  Just examined both disc 7 copies currently in my possession with a 10x loupe, and sure enough, there is a tiny radiating crack on the very edge.  Obviously the issue is with the pressing currently on hand at Amazon in Lexington KY, and unless a copy can be found from a different batch lot, I fear that should I return this copy for set number 4 I will run into the same problem.  I've just confirmed that disc 8-10 all load normally, but won't know if there are any other play issues with those until I watch them.  Will definitely return the latest set, and I guess I will try to buy from a different vendor, or perhaps just try to find episodes 23-26 online someplace and watch on my computer!",1518134400,4,1418,4.12
6141989,5,B00H9BFV98,"If your a fan this is the package for you. You get the pilot in both versions, two complete seasons, Fire Walk with Me , and extras. Everything Twin Peaks the original series has to offer in one package. I had never seen the Pilot before and it was a nice treat. The two regular seasons speak for themselves. The movie Fire Walk with Me was almost too much. Violent and sexual perversions set it apart from the series where everything was implied but nothing was explicit. Definitely not for the kids or even young teens. The extras seemed a little light to have it's own disc, there's a lot  of room for a lot more. What there is of extras was great, just not enough. Personally for the price it was a great deal and a nice diversion during our long binge-worthy winter.",1517270400,3,771,4.354166666666667

6141993,3,B00H9BFV98,"I was very excited to go through the beautiful box art another reviewer had added so many great photos of, but what I received was a generic blue plastic case in a cardboard sleeve. I haven't had a chance yet to play a disc to confirm the Beautiful, Remastered HD Picture and Sound, so I cant speak to that, but Im very disappointed in the packaging. That said, its still a good deal for the entire original run, film, missing pieces, extras, etc.",1516233600,2,447,4.397590361445783
6141994,3,B00H9BFV98,"While I like the show and its characters overall, the last half of the show and fire walk with me were weak, lame and stupid. The now directionless characters are just bouncing around mindlessly in lesser quality ill fitting clothing. The writing and dialogue went from crisp and relevant to flabby and trite. Amazing how bad the show became after it's initial burst of creativity.",1516060800,3,381,4.876923076923077

6142005,5,B00H9BFV98,"For those that have the ""Definitive Gold Box Edition,"" you may not want to worry about this edition. I'd say the main difference is that this edition includes the movie, ""Fire Walk With Me,"" as well as all the cut scenes from the movie--which nearly make an entire movie in itself. I really enjoyed watching the cut scenes, though they aren't necessary for understanding the narrative. There are also deleted scenes from the series and interviews--different than the ones from the gold edition.

And, to be clear--this is not the ""entire mystery"" because--lucky for us!--they brought back the series AFTER this was released. again: Twin Peaks the Return is NOT on this edition!",1513728000,3,677,4.991150442477876

6142019,5,B00H9BFV98,"If you are a true PEAKS fan, this is the set.  This covers so many bases - both seasons with a full upgrade.  These don't look like the Netflix or Showtime versions - they are in a sound and vision quality all their own.  Same with film, first time in HD and looks magnificent.  MISSING PIECES amazing - too bad there's not a version on here that mixes them in with the film.  The box and blu-ray holder are excellent examples of how to put together a set and also - they didn't cheap out - just a few eps per disc so everything looks brilliant.  Too bad they couldn't port over some other previous stuff from previous sets, but that stuff is cheap and completists can find used copies on amazon to own.  That said - doesn't get much better than this set for all things Peaks except for new 3rd season.  That said - this feels incomplete without THE DIARY OF LAURA PALMER which is on amazon for about 10 bucks, an amazing read and basically the basis for the PEAKS LAST DAYS OF PALMER storyline in FIRE WALK WITH ME.

The show always looked a bit sepia-toned to me, and of course it was always NTSC standard definition video. For this edition, the color has been breathtakingly corrected, and the detail is amazing (since it was shot on 35mm film originally).

This is the third time I've bought this stuff (first laserdisc, then DVD), but this is the first time I've enjoyed it wholeheartedly. If you were thinking about it, get it. It looks much, much better than what they recently made available on Netflix.",1506470400,3,631,4.684684684684685

So you get the full set, but not the collector's edition with art.

6142032,5,B00H9BFV98,"There is increased interest in David Lynch movies and Twin Peaks with Showtime running the Limited Event Season 3 of Twin Peaks. Now is the ideal time to re-watch Twin Peaks before the inevitable Season 3 blu ray comes along. It is a perfect set, given the fact that the source material is over 25 years old. Note that the episodes are ""full screen"" (the old CRT TV screen size). The producers wisely did not do a widescreen conversion. This way, it is more authentic and the picture quality is nothing short of superb. The extras run for several hours and everything has English SDH if that floats your boat. Sound too is exceptionally good. Do not wait for a 4K UHD, I do not think they will make one. The HD blu ray is that good. The music too is simply mesmerizing. I know it is getting harder to get a copy of the Entire Mystery, which is well on its way to becoming a rare collector's item. So get your copy while you still can.

6142036,5,B00H9BFV98,"This review is for the Blu-ray Edition - Twin Peaks: The Entire Mystery. I'm not sure why Amazon has all kinds of different reviews under the heading but anyway. I actually did a huge review on my blog. I added 20 videos of the boxed set and I will try to do that here but I'm not sure how many you can add. I did get this from another retailer even though I have Amazon Prime, I get a lot of stuff that I have to return due to damage so major things I buy somewhere else.

I never even watched Twin Peaks until May 2017! I just thought back in the day it wasn't something I would like. I thought it was just some kind of soap opera. I had no idea it was crazy train! I love it so much =) The box set is phenomenal! The only problem with the packaging is they put the blu rays in the card board sleeves. I really wish they would add some foam to those, but I digress.

When your watching each disc, it gives you the option of play all like most do, but when you hit play all on this set it will say play episodes and under it play episodes with extras <-- not worded like that but you get my drift. If you choose this one then the log lady does an intro to each episode! How cool is that. Okay, I'm going to see if I can upload the 20 pictures. If I can then you will see the sturdy box, how it holds itself open, some little grooves in the cardboard so you can easily turn the page, some see through pages that turn over and there is a picture underneath, you will see my pen in the pictures so my hands won't be in the way. Also, I put a rock in a couple of pictures to hold the page down so that does not come with the set =) There is also a sweet compartment at the very end that has a little message inside.

Thank you for looking at my review and hopefully all of the pictures! =)",1496448000,16,1786,3.861035422343324

The camera work and acting were fine, very professional, but it had been re-done with some of the cast changed. Some of the young girls had been
replaced, the plots altered somewhat. The ""Fire Walk With Me"" disc was one of the worst attempts at acting I have ever seen. The original was
excellent making you wonder what the hell were they thinking and who was the idiot director. I would pay top dollar to view the original ""Twin Peaks""
but the person I use to borrow it from has moved out of state. This re-do did use some of the original MAIN characters but there were some very attractive high school girls missing and some memorable scenes left out.

I saved up money ($90) to buy the entire series on VHS back in the 90's. I watched it over and over again. There were friends that had never even heard of the show that would borrow it and be amazed by the show. They would tell me ""I couldn't stop watching. After one episode I couldn't wait to see what happens next."" They would binge watch Twin Peaks; and that was before the term ""binge watch"" existed. However VHS tapes do get worn out when watched frequently. I haven't watched them in years because I was afraid to ruin the tapes. Someone told me that they were not only on DVD but blu-ray too. I went to amazon.com and to my delight I found the entire series. The 2 hour premiere, season 1 & 2 and Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me. Oh and the cherry on top, all the extra footage.",1483833600,,923,4.104972375690608
6142047,5,B00H9BFV98,"'TWIN PEAKS' was originally conceived as a crime-drama-mystery, but became so much more, including an instant cultural phenomena after it's debut on the ABC Network on April 8, 1990. Created by cult director David Lynch (THE ELEPHANT MAN,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BLUE-VELVET/dp/B005HT400A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BLUE VELVET</a>, MULHOLLAND DRIVE) and writer/producer Mark Frost (HILL STREET BLUES, FANTASTIC FOUR), the series started off strong, due to a successful publicity campaign and people's curiosity to see how David Lynch's aesthetic would translate to network TV.  The two-hour pilot, which aired on a Sunday, was seen by a third of the TV viewing audience and the following seven episodes of the first season benefited greatly from ""the water cooler effect,"" people discussing it at work the next day. Unfortunately ABC began to broadcast the following episodes on Thursday nights, in competition  with NBC's strong ""must-see TV"" line-up. Viewership began to drop, but when the last episode of the first series was broadcast on a Wednesday at 10pm, the ratings improved. The second season originally did OK, but the domino-effect of ABC constantly shuffling it's time-slot, numerous preemptions caused by the Gulf War and viewership disinterest after the main plot, the murder of Laura Palmer, was solved halfway through, resulted in the series' cancellation. The show however lived on in reruns (Bravo), home video (VHS, LaserDisc, DVD & Blu-ray) and various homages (THE SIMPSONS, SNL, PSYCH), eventually becoming a pop-culture touchstone. It's influence on the look, writing, casting and music of the many shows that followed (WILD PALMS, PICKET FENCES, THE X-FILES, LOST) and television in general is immeasurable and continues to this day...

Although the initial plot was the investigation into the murder of Laura Palmer, the show was much, much more than a routine crime drama. The combination of gruesome murders and violence mixed with off-kilter humor and satire, liberally sprinkled with elements of the supernatural and science fiction was fresh and new, like nothing ever seen before on television. The music was also a strong component, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/haunting-soundtrack-by-Angelo-Badalamenti/dp/B000002LMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">haunting soundtrack by Angelo Badalamenti</a>, song lyrics by Lynch himself, and the other-worldly vocal&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/performances-by-Julee-Cruise/dp/B000002LH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">performances by Julee Cruise</a>&nbsp;and the late Jimmy Scott were like a breath of cool, clean mountain air. Watching the show again, one of it's strengths is it's timeless look. Except for some anachronistic corded telephones and 1990's computer equipment, it doesn't seem dated at all. Part of this could be attributed to the show's use of classic cars and fashions throughout the series, never bowing to any fads that would tie it to a specific era. Another factor was the numerous homages to classic movies and TV shows. This was especially true with the casting and character's names, here are some examples:

Many of the actors appeared or worked in Lynch's films, Jack Nance (ERASERHEAD, DUNE, BLUE VELVET), Charlotte Stewart and Catherine Coulson (ERASERHEAD), Kyle MacLachlan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DUNE/dp/B00371QQ0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DUNE</a>, BLUE VELVET), Grace Zabriskie (WILD AT HEART) and Everett McGill & Alicia Witt (DUNE)

Richard Beymer (Ben Horne) and Russ Tamblyn (Dr. Jacoby) co-starred in the film version of the famous musical WEST SIDE STORY

Peggy Lipton (Norma Jennings) and Clarence Williams III (FBI Agent Hardy) co-starred in the classic TV show THE MOD SQUAD

THE FUGITIVE, the famous TV series about an innocent man on the run searching for his wife's killer featured a one-armed man and an inspector named Philip Gerrard. Lynch and Frost borrowed the former for a character and named him after the later

The show was a last hurrah for Hank Worden (The Waiter) and Royal Dano (Judge Sternwood), both well-known character actors, especially in westerns, including JOHNNY GUITAR (Dano) and THE SEARCHERS (Worden). The show was actually Worden's last acting credit, he died two years later at the age of 91. Dano was only active for another two years, passing away at 71 in 1994. Between them they appeared in over 400 films and TV shows!

Billy Wilder's film SUNSET BLVD., about the denizens of Hollywood, featured characters named Norma and Gordon Cole

Michael Parks (Jean Renault) starred in the cult TV show THEN CAME BRONSON and had a Top 40 hit with ""Long Lonesome Highway"" in 1970. He recently starred in both films within the Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarantino film homage GRINDHOUSE

Jane Greer (Vivian Smythe Niles) was the femme-fatale in the famous film-noir OUT OF THE PAST starring Robert Mitchum and Kirk Douglas. She also starred with Mitchum in the lesser know noir ""The Big Steal.""

The character of Judge Sternwood (Royal Dano) shares the same surname as the Sternwood clan from the great John Huston film THE BIG SLEEP starring Humphrey Bogart

Fans of the classic film-noir LAURA got a chuckle when it was discovered that the mynah bird WALDO was a patient of Dr. LYDECKER. And of course there's that Palmer girl...

Laura's lookalike cousin Madeleine shares the same moniker as the object of James Stewart's obsession (played by Kim Novak) in Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece of identity, obsession and murder, VERTIGO

The insurance agent that tries to get Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie) to sign the DOUBLE INDEMNITY insurance policy is named WALTER NEFF

There are many cameos from artists such as Molly Shannon (SNL), David L. Lander (Laverne & Shirley), musician Van Dyke Parks, singer Jimmy Scott and actors Alicia Witt, David Warner and Frances Bay

TWIN PEAKS was also a proving ground for a few little-known actors that became well-known stars, including Laura Flynn Boyle (Donna Hayward), a young cute Heather Graham (Annie Blackburn) still with a little ""baby fat"" (NOT a dig), Miguel Ferrer (FBI Agent Albert Rosenfield), David Duchovny (DEA Agent Bryson), Billy Zane (John Justice Wheeler) and Carel Struycken (The Giant)...

THE BLU-RAY SET:
First of all, I couldn't imagine the visuals looking any finer. The HD transfer is reference quality, just beautiful, it blows-away every previous home-video version, and I've owned quite a few of them! EVERYTHING is closed-captioned. The dts-HD lossless audio is a big improvement on the previous releases as well. I don't know if it's me, but when this was originally broadcast I had an early 5.1 surround system and remember the sound mix to be uniquely off-kilter, as if they were ""painting with sound."" None of the home video releases seemed true to this mix, which I actually preferred and felt was more complimentary to the visuals, but whatever, no one will complain about the sound here. There've been scattered audio sync complaints about FWWM, but I haven't had any with newer SONY multi-region player. The set comes in a 7""x6""x2"" textured box with a die-cut lid and raised lettering with a cloth stay to keep the lid open. Very handsome, but clumsy. There have been many complaints about the quality of the box itself and the lack of a booklet or detailed information. Inside there are attached hinged cardboard pages that have alternating notches in the bottom corners to lift them. There are three sections delineated with attached parchment-type paper, The First Season: Discs 1 & 2, The Second Season: Discs 3-8 , Disc 9: the film ""Twin Peaks: Fire, Walk With Me"" and Disc 10: Special Features. This is the ONLY information about the set's contents in the box, and as I mentioned, there is NO booklet. Every disc is listed as having ""Special Features"" but except for the last disc, none are explained. That's one of the main reasons I'm writing this review, so it can be used or printed out as a reference for those interested. The discs are stored in slots within the back of the pages. At least one of mine was not properly glued together, causing the disc to slide out of the side of the ""page."" The bottom of the box has a ""hidden compartment"" with a special message. Each disc begins with the usual logos and warnings, then there's a choice of fourteen languages. Each disc has a ""Set Up"" option which include nine audio options (7.1 dts-HD, English stereo and seven dubs of other languages), and a choice of thirteen subtitles. None of the discs have an option for ""Chapters"" although all the Episodes HAVE them. I will list the number of Chapters on each Episode as I go along. My player's remote has an ""Options"" button that lets you choose a ""Chapter Search"" option, check your player's manual for it's location on yours. So on with the devil in the details...

DISC ONE: THE PILOT & EPISODES 1 & 2
Original Air Dates: Sunday, April 8, Thursday, April 12 and 19, 1990
Each disc has a different theme featuring scenes from the series playing in a loop, on Disc One it's ""Trees/Woods."" You then have a choice of ""Play All,"" ""Pilot,"" Episodes,"" ""Set Up"" and ""Special Features.""
When you choose ""Pilot"" you have 3 options, ""Log Lady Intro,"" ""Play Together"" and ""International Version."" The Log Lady Intros were filmed especially for the show's second run on the Bravo Channel. The ""International Version"" is the Pilot with added material at the end, some that appeared on later episodes and some that did not, that was released outside the U.S. as a stand-alone film. The Pilot has 10 chapters, the International Version has 11. If you just want to watch the material added to the International Version, go to Chapter 8 and then fast-forward to the 1:32:27 mark. From there on is the 21+ minutes of material added to the Pilot so they could release it overseas as a film with an ending.
Episodes 1 & 2 both have 6 chapters. They also have the options ""Play Episode,"" ""Log Lady Intro,"" ""Recap"" and "" ""Play All Together with Episode."" Episode 1 also has a ""Preview"" option...

From DISC TWO to DISC EIGHT every disc's Menu gives you the choice of ""Play All,"" ""Episodes,"" ""Set Up"" and ""Special Features."" If you choose ""Play All"" you're given the choice of ""Episode Only"" and ""With Episodic Extras."" All Episodes have 6 chapters unless noted. If you choose an Episode by itself you have the options ""Play Episode,"" ""Log Lady Intro,"" ""Recap,"" ""Preview"" and "" ""Play All Together with Episode,"" unless noted...

The ""Special Features"" are an ""Image Gallery,"" ""Twin Peeks Sneak Previews"" and ""Promos.""
The ""Image Gallery"" has three choices of photos, ""Season 1,"" ""Picnic"" and ""Ski Trip"" which is the most interesting since the segment that they represent never aired. You navigate through them with the < and > buttons on your remote.
The ""Twin Peaks Sneak Previews"" (2:51 total) are five ""Tonight On Twin Peaks"" commercials narrated by Kimmy Robertson in character.
The ""Promos"" have a ""Play All"" option and included ""See Twin Peaks From The Beginning,"" scenes from the first season with a voice-over by ""Agent Cooper"" (2:14) and ""Where Am I"" a short (0:35) promo where ""Agent Cooper"" lets viewers know that Episode 7 was going to be on Wednesday instead of Thursday...

""A Slice Of Lynch"" was originally a half-hour long conversation with David Lynch, Kyle MacLachlan, Mdchen Amick and the series' associate producer John Wentworth that was included in the Gold Box edition. Here it runs 0:55:33. They discuss various aspects about the production and it's genesis.
The ""Promos"" have a ""Play All"" option and include: ""There's No Place Like Home"" (0:35) made to remind viewers that the show had been moved from Saturday to Thursday, featuring MacLachlan, Catherine Coulson, Piper Laurie and Michael J. Anderson, ""T-Shirt Ad"" (0:34) hawks (sorry) the Official Twin Peaks Sheriff's Department T-Shirt, and features Al Strobel & Kimmy Robertson, ""Holiday Greeting"" (0:13) has no actors, ""Patriot Greeting"" (0:39) gives a shout out to the troops in the Gulf War with MacLachlan, Amick and Dana Ashbrook, and ""Big Game Promo"" (2:43), which has multiple takes of MacLachlan and Michael Ontkean in character preparing to watch the Cincinatti Bengals vs. the Seattle Seahawks which must've aired before Monday Night Football on October 1, 1990. The Image Gallery has photos from ""Season 2"" and ""Albert's Slides,"" photos of 'evidence on microscope slides' props...

Original Air Dates: Saturday, October 20 & 27, November 3 & 10, 1990

Their are twelve ""Series Deleted Scenes"" (many ported over from the 'Gold Box Edition') with the option to ""Play All."" All the Special Features material has NOT been remastered. I'm listing the titles as shown but not revealing details, that's for you to discover and enjoy! The deleted scenes are ""Cooper and Donna Talk About Picnic"" (0:25), ""Picnic"" (0:55), ""Cooper and Truman Gazebo"" (0:35), ""Mayor's Speech"" (1:35), ""Lucy and Racoons"" (0:25), ""16MM Period Piece"" (:48), ""Bobby Coaches Shelly"" (1:13), ""Lucy and Deputy Andy"" (1:24), ""Jerry's Wandering Eye"" (0:53*), ""27 Going On 6"" (1:33*), ""Lucy, Andy, and Donuts"" (0:53*) and ""Something About Johnny"" (0:48*). Some of these reveal further background information, especially about Johnny Horne. Those marked (*) were also on the GOLD BOX SET.
The ""Outtakes"" are basically just over two-minutes of Cooper and Truman on stakeout plus them standing in a sort of haze. These really don't add anything at all...

DISC FIVE: EPISODES 15-16-17-18
Original Air Dates: Saturday, November 17, December 1, 8 & 15, 1990
The Menu theme is ""Notes""
The ""Special Features"" are ""Return To Twin Peaks,"" ""Location Guide,"" and ""The Glastonbury Archive.""

DISC EIGHT: EPISODES 27-28-29
Original Air Dates: Thursday, April 18 and Monday, June 10, 1991 (June 10th was the double-episode finale)
The Menu theme is ""Owls""
There are no ""Previews"" on this disc except for ""Lucy's Special Announcement"" on Episode 27. Episodes 28 and 29 were originally broadcast back-to-back. Obviously, the last episode has no ""Recap.""
The ""Special Feature"" is the ""making of"" documentary: ""Secrets from Another Place: Creating Twin Peaks."" You can choose a ""Play All"" option (1:46:13) or choose any of four different sections, ""Northwest Passage: Creating The Pilot"" (30:42), ""Freshly Squeezed: Creating Season One"" (30:46), ""Where We're From: Creating The Music"" (17:54) and ""Into The Night: Creating Season Two.""

DISC NINE: ""TWIN PEAKS: Fire Walk With Me"" and ""The Missing Pieces: Deleted/Alternate Scenes""

The Special Feature is ""Archival Interviews."" The Menu has the usual ""Play All"" and ""Set Up"" options.

The Feature Film ""TWIN PEAKS: Fire Walk With Me"" (2:14:33) has 41 chapters. This HD transfer is beautiful and won't be topped until they invent home 3-D holograms (and I don't know if I'd want Bob in my living room). People who complain about the missing cast members from the TV version have to understand that they weren't necessary to the story until after the murder. The only other thing I can say is, after watching this now for the upteenth time, is that I still find it as valid and compelling as when I first saw it in the theater. Powerful stuff...

""The Missing Pieces: Deleted/Alternate Scenes"" (1:31:25)
Since this extra is long-awaited and the big news about this set, There are 35 (!) in all. The ""Special Feature"" is ""Archival Interviews"" (5:25) with a ""Play All"" option. The interviews are with Ray Wise (0:39), Sheryl Lee (1:56), Moira Kelly (1:00) and Mdchen Amick (1:50). In my opinion they are lousy and add not one wit of new info....

DISC TEN: SPECIAL FEATURES
The Menu theme is ""The Red Room."" The disc includes:
Between Two Worlds: Palmer Family Interview and Actor's Discussion (with Sheryl Lee, Ray Wise, Grace Zabriskie and David Lynch)(38:20 total): Palmer Family Interview (10:00), Actor's Discussion (28:27).

Credits: 14 pages using the < and  > buttons....

FEATURES COMPARISON:
I never owned the VHS set because I taped the whole shebang and any specials or interviews I could find. I never bought the LaserDiscs because the price point was too high. I had the Artisan First Season set and the CBS Second Season set. Could it really be thirteen years since the release of the Artisan set?! From what I can remember, since I only watched the extras once, all of that set's extras are here except for the director's commentaries and the ""Script Notes: Optional Guide to the 'Unseen Twin Peaks' feature. These were never ported over to the GOLD BOX SET as well. As soon as the GOLD BOX SET was announced I sold the previous sets and purchased it. Again, everything on that set is here but a few exceptions, mainly the postcards, the Saturday Night Live clips when Kyle MacLachlan hosted, and the ""Falling"" music video. I never cared for the SNL material, too broad and stupid, if you really want to watch it, it's on YouTube along with the music video. ""Reflections On The Phenomenon Of Twin Peaks"" was on the New Line ""TWIN PEAKS: Fire Walk With Me"" DVD....

IN SUMMATION (!There ARE Spoilers ahead!):
It should be obvious by now that I'm a TWIN PEAKS fan. My first David Lynch movie was ERASERHEAD. Now there's an off-the-wall film. Next I saw THE ELEPHANT MAN and was impressed how he implemented his style in a mainstream movie. The next was the premier showing (in my area) of BLUE VELVET, which I took a blind date to. Needless to say, it didn't work out so well, but hey, if she didn't like David Lynch...so, anyhow, when TWIN PEAKS was hyped I told my then more hip girlfriend that we had to catch David Lynch's vision of prime-time TV! We became instant fans and advocates, I even had a letter printed in TV Guide defending it from critics! So what went wrong? Well, as many point out, ABC didn't know what to do with it. The First Season did great because the Sunday pilot had everyone talking about it the next day at work, which was quickly followed by the initial seven regular episodes, all on consecutive Thursdays. It was the Second Season when they really screwed it up. Although it premiered again on a Sunday, they buried the next sixteen episodes in the Saturday TV graveyard. Even worse, it had three hiatuses, for one week, then three, then two. It ran another three consecutive weeks, and then disappeared for another FIVE weeks. During that time, ABC was going to just cancel it and not show the last six contracted episodes, but enough fans made them change their minds. It resurfaced on a Thursday, where it played for four consecutive weeks, then disappeared again for seven weeks and four days, when they finally showed the two remaining episodes back-to-back on Monday, June 10, 1991. Whew! even Rodney Dangerfield got more respect. The other deciding factor in it's demise has to ride on the shoulders of producers David Lynch and Mark Frost. They just lost interest until the end, when cancellation loomed they made an attempt at a Hail! Mary pass, but it was too late. The Second Season came out strong at the gate, but after they solved the mystery, resulting in the end of actor Ray Wise's tenure, the show began floundering. In my opinion, Ray Wise's emotional performance as Leland Palmer was a tour-de-force. His ability to play a good man, a loving man, haunted and tortured by demons from the dark side, changing personalities in a nanosecond, was unparalleled. The fact that he was never even nominated for an Emmy is a sin. The direction the show went was also a sin. TWIN PEAKS' blend of mystery, drama and comedy was laced with just the perfect amount of the supernatural and science-fiction, where it went wrong was adding fantasy. The plot line of Nadine's super-strength was just plain dumb, an amnesia plot maybe, but the former was just plain ridiculous. With all the SUPER original cast, did the have to bring in Ian Buchanan and David L. Lander's comic relief? Was I the only one who thought the whole James and Evelyn arc stunk to high heaven? Windom Earle wasn't a bad idea, but instead of it being foreboding they had him play dress-up so many times it was unbelievable. Don't you think that after finding out the first time that he was in the area that there would be posters, and news reports, and searches, and at least some heightened vigilance? There was so much they could've done with the characters everyone knew and loved and tuned in to see. Did Audrey have to have an affair with the quickly in-and-out (literally) John Justice Wheeler? She and Bobby were working together, couldn't they get together? They'd been showing Donna trying to act as tough and jaded as Laura, why didn't they develop that? A main character going into a downward spiral, then possibly targeted by another BOB possessed character, say Dr. Jacoby would've been better than her pining for James. And why not build up Jerry Horne? or Hawk? or have Mike and Nadine have a serious affair? Why not bring back Ray Wise as his brother? Well, by now I'm sure you get my drift. The show began to pull together at the end, but again, it was too little too late. At least we eventually got the prequel, FIRE WALK WITH ME. The bottom line is this, even after watching it so many times over so many years, when I started to watch this set I couldn't wait for the next episode. TWIN PEAKS holds up as a phenomena that earned it's title, and will surely be watched, and discussed for generations to come, or the next cup 'o' joe and slice of cherry pie is on me......",1483142400,3,28287,5.1335214937038645

6142049,1,B00H9BFV98,"Just FYI: This low rating/review has nothing to do with Twin Peaks as a series. It is actually my favorite TV show, so if this review were for the show itself, it'd be 5 starts hands down.

The product packaging is reason I am writing this poor review. I ordered this boxed set, paying about $35 more than a similar collection also sold on Amazon (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twin-Peaks-The-Original-Series-Fire-Walk-With-Me-The-Missing-Pieces-Blu-ray/dp/B01IKH6O3Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twin Peaks: The Original Series, Fire Walk With Me & The Missing Pieces [Blu-ray</a>], because of this sets collectors edition design and quality. When I received the product, I gently opened up the casing, and saw about an inch-long tear on the inner lid of the set, right on top of some of the interior artwork (See picture). I at first thought it was my fault from when I initially opened it, but the tear location was nowhere near the opening. I then observed that a piece of black ribbon with paper and glue residue on it was laying inside the box, clearly supposed to be attached in the torn spot to keep the box open when flipping through disks. I looked up videos/images of others opening this set, and saw that the ribbon was supposed to be attached at that point.

Having purchased and paid more specifically for the packaging of this set, I immediately returned and exchanged the set for another one. The replacement arrived, and this set had exactly the same damage as the original order! I contacted Amazon Customer Service (The product was sold by Amazon.com LLC), and they were very unhelpful, stating there was nothing they could do to specifically remedy the situation.

Ive since opted to order the product from another retailer, and this product was perfectly fine. Id strongly suggest ordering from another place, especially if the packaging is important to you.",1481846400,14,1917,5.237785016286645

6142052,5,B00H9BFV98,"Its hard to believe its been 25 years since Special FBI agent Dale Cooper said goodbye to his secretary Diane while talking into his hand held recorder having solved the problems found in Twin Peaks. Its hard to believe that the series was only on TV for two years. And even more incredible is to think that when it was on it became such a phenomena that people gathered together for viewing parties in each others homes drinking coffee and eating cherry pie with a log sitting in a chair in the same room.

Yes people actually did that when the show took over the airwaves for a young generation trying something new. Director and creator David Lynch had taken a story he had to tell and turned it into must see TV. And then suddenly it was over. The murder solved. The mysteries around it figured out. Interest died and the show did as well. And yet a hard core audience remained longing for more.

Over the years various box sets have been put together for the show offering as complete a set as they could. First they had the series itself. Then the original pilot was included as well. Then extras were found and added. Finally Lynchs film FIRE WALK WITH ME, a prequel to events in the movie was released and later added. Now all of these things have come together and been put on blu-ray for fans to enjoy. Just in time too as the series has been given new life on Showtime with a new series in the works.

So lets pretend that you have no clue what TWIN PEAKS was all about. Odds are pretty good that could be since anyone 30 years old and younger wasn't around to watch it when it aired. The series opened with the discovery of a body, that of the much loved and adored Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee), found wrapped in plastic by the banks of a river in Twin Peaks, Washington. The entire town is shaken to the core, some more than others, as who is responsible for her killing as well as numerous town secrets are slowly unraveled as the series progresses.

Investigating the murder is not only the town sheriff Harry S. Truman (Michael Ontkean) but Special Agent Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) as well. Cooper is not your normal everyday FBI agent either. His methods are truly different than most and his mannerisms are the stuff of legend. So much so that many felt the character of Fox Mulder on THE X-FILES was a take on a similar character. Cooper became as much the focal point of the series as the tons of other characters in the town, and when I say tons trust me, there were a number of characters involved in all sorts of chicanery in this town. Secret societies, crime families, cheating spouses, one eyed women, log carrying ladies and more inhabited Twin Peaks and we loved them all.

So why would anyone consider investing in this new collection? Whats new? Well to being with you now have the chance to watch the series in high definition, something that hadnt been available before. There is both the American and international versions of the pilot that were made. The blu-ray debut of Lynchs FIRE WALK WITH ME is included. Theres a new featurette with series creator Lynch and the actors who portrayed the Palmer family. Plenty of never before seen extra footage is on hand as well. And if that wasn't enough there are newly transferred introductions to each episode by the log lady. Watch and youll find out who she is.

These days people talk about binge watching series, tuning into Netflix or Hulu and watching a series from start to finish. Those who are accustomed to this as if its the way things have always been will have a hard time understanding the dedication fans had to a series such as TWIN PEAKS and how they would tune in weekly, waiting in anticipation, recording the show on VHS to watch over again for clues and how they would avoid friends at the water cooler if for some reason they didn't get to watch the episode as it aired. Those same people can now binge watch the series in the best format possible and find out what all the excitement was about. With the shows we watch today it might not seem all that strange but at the time it was unlike anything ever shown on TV. With this box set, now is the time to rediscover the town of Twin Peaks and share with others.",1477008000,,4208,4.437257438551099

6142058,5,B00H9BFV98,"When the package came I was beyond excited to finally see this set for myself and finally have everything from the series in my grasp.

I'd heard a lot of great things about all the special features and how great the series looked on blu-ray, but not much about the packaging itself. The boxset comes in a sturdy, heavy cardboard casing and each disc holder and ""card"" in between is printed with beautiful images from the series. The front of the box has the picture of Laura Palmer we all know and the torn away pieces are actually rigid and give the effect it represents in the picture, exposing what's beneath, much like we see in the series as we see the lives of the residents of Twin Peaks exposed for what they truly are. The back of the box shows a blue rose which is important in ""Fire Walk With Me.""

The series itself has been cleaned up and looks wonderful. This is definitely what fans have been waiting for. Being able to have all the bonus features included (interviews, deleted scenes, Log Lady intros) makes me so happy. I hadn't watched the series in so long and as cliche as this sounds, it was like seeing it for the first time. I'd forgotten all the twists this series had. Finally having ""Fire Walk With Me"" on blu-ray is exciting. I find the movie to be great and I don't understand why people didn't like it when it was originally released. It's rather frightening. I hadn't seen it prior to getting this set.

Hopefully more people pick this up before season three starts next year!",1469491200,,1507,4.452898550724638

6142066,5,B00H9BFV98,"'TWIN PEAKS' was originally conceived as a crime-drama-mystery, but became so much more, including an instant cultural phenomena after it's debut on the ABC Network on April 8, 1990. Created by cult director David Lynch (THE ELEPHANT MAN,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BLUE-VELVET/dp/B005HT400A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BLUE VELVET</a>, MULHOLLAND DRIVE) and writer/producer Mark Frost (HILL STREET BLUES, FANTASTIC FOUR), the series started off strong, due to a successful publicity campaign and people's curiosity to see how David Lynch's aesthetic would translate to network TV.  The two-hour pilot, which aired on a Sunday, was seen by a third of the TV viewing audience and the following seven episodes of the first season benefited greatly from ""the water cooler effect,"" people discussing it at work the next day. Unfortunately ABC began to broadcast the following episodes on Thursday nights, in competition  with NBC's strong ""must-see TV"" line-up. Viewership began to drop, but when the last episode of the first series was broadcast on a Wednesday at 10pm, the ratings improved. The second season originally did OK, but the domino-effect of ABC constantly shuffling it's time-slot, numerous preemptions caused by the Gulf War and viewership disinterest after the main plot, the murder of Laura Palmer, was solved halfway through, resulted in the series' cancellation. The show however lived on in reruns (Bravo), home video (VHS, LaserDisc, DVD & Blu-ray) and various homages (THE SIMPSONS, SNL, PSYCH), eventually becoming a pop-culture touchstone. It's influence on the look, writing, casting and music of the many shows that followed (WILD PALMS, PICKET FENCES, THE X-FILES, LOST) and television in general is immeasurable and continues to this day...

Although the initial plot was the investigation into the murder of Laura Palmer, the show was much, much more than a routine crime drama. The combination of gruesome murders and violence mixed with off-kilter humor and satire, liberally sprinkled with elements of the supernatural and science fiction was fresh and new, like nothing ever seen before on television. The music was also a strong component, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/haunting-soundtrack-by-Angelo-Badalamenti/dp/B000002LMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">haunting soundtrack by Angelo Badalamenti</a>, song lyrics by Lynch himself, and the other-worldly vocal&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/performances-by-Julee-Cruise/dp/B000002LH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">performances by Julee Cruise</a>&nbsp;and the late Jimmy Scott were like a breath of cool, clean mountain air. Watching the show again, one of it's strengths is it's timeless look. Except for some anachronistic corded telephones and 1990's computer equipment, it doesn't seem dated at all. Part of this could be attributed to the show's use of classic cars and fashions throughout the series, never bowing to any fads that would tie it to a specific era. Another factor was the numerous homages to classic movies and TV shows. This was especially true with the casting and character's names, here are some examples:

Many of the actors appeared or worked in Lynch's films, Jack Nance (ERASERHEAD, DUNE, BLUE VELVET), Charlotte Stewart and Catherine Coulson (ERASERHEAD), Kyle MacLachlan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DUNE/dp/B00371QQ0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DUNE</a>, BLUE VELVET), Grace Zabriskie (WILD AT HEART) and Everett McGill & Alicia Witt (DUNE)

Richard Beymer (Ben Horne) and Russ Tamblyn (Dr. Jacoby) co-starred in the film version of the famous musical WEST SIDE STORY

Peggy Lipton (Norma Jennings) and Clarence Williams III (FBI Agent Hardy) co-starred in the classic TV show THE MOD SQUAD

THE FUGITIVE, the famous TV series about an innocent man on the run searching for his wife's killer featured a one-armed man and an inspector named Philip Gerrard. Lynch and Frost borrowed the former for a character and named him after the later

The show was a last hurrah for Hank Worden (The Waiter) and Royal Dano (Judge Sternwood), both well-known character actors, especially in westerns, including JOHNNY GUITAR (Dano) and THE SEARCHERS (Worden). The show was actually Worden's last acting credit, he died two years later at the age of 91. Dano was only active for another two years, passing away at 71 in 1994. Between them they appeared in over 400 films and TV shows!

Billy Wilder's film SUNSET BLVD., about the denizens of Hollywood, featured characters named Norma and Gordon Cole

Michael Parks (Jean Renault) starred in the cult TV show THEN CAME BRONSON and had a Top 40 hit with ""Long Lonesome Highway"" in 1970. He recently starred in both films within the Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarantino film homage GRINDHOUSE

Jane Greer (Vivian Smythe Niles) was the femme-fatale in the famous film-noir OUT OF THE PAST starring Robert Mitchum and Kirk Douglas. She also starred with Mitchum in the lesser know noir ""The Big Steal.""

The character of Judge Sternwood (Royal Dano) shares the same surname as the Sternwood clan from the great John Huston film THE BIG SLEEP starring Humphrey Bogart

Fans of the classic film-noir LAURA got a chuckle when it was discovered that the mynah bird WALDO was a patient of Dr. LYDECKER. And of course there's that Palmer girl...

Laura's lookalike cousin Madeleine shares the same moniker as the object of James Stewart's obsession (played by Kim Novak) in Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece of identity, obsession and murder, VERTIGO

The insurance agent that tries to get Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie) to sign the DOUBLE INDEMNITY insurance policy is named WALTER NEFF

There are many cameos from artists such as Molly Shannon (SNL), David L. Lander (Laverne & Shirley), musician Van Dyke Parks, singer Jimmy Scott and actors Alicia Witt, David Warner and Frances Bay

TWIN PEAKS was also a proving ground for a few little-known actors that became well-known stars, including Laura Flynn Boyle (Donna Hayward), a young cute Heather Graham (Annie Blackburn) still with a little ""baby fat"" (NOT a dig), Miguel Ferrer (FBI Agent Albert Rosenfield), David Duchovny (DEA Agent Bryson), Billy Zane (John Justice Wheeler) and Carel Struycken (The Giant)...

THE BLU-RAY SET:
First of all, I couldn't imagine the visuals looking any finer. The HD transfer is reference quality, just beautiful, it blows-away every previous home-video version, and I've owned quite a few of them! EVERYTHING is closed-captioned. The dts-HD lossless audio is a big improvement on the previous releases as well. I don't know if it's me, but when this was originally broadcast I had an early 5.1 surround system and remember the sound mix to be uniquely off-kilter, as if they were ""painting with sound."" None of the home video releases seemed true to this mix, which I actually preferred and felt was more complimentary to the visuals, but whatever, no one will complain about the sound here. There've been scattered audio sync complaints about FWWM, but I haven't had any with newer SONY multi-region player. The set comes in a 7""x6""x2"" textured box with a die-cut lid and raised lettering with a cloth stay to keep the lid open. Very handsome, but clumsy. There have been many complaints about the quality of the box itself and the lack of a booklet or detailed information. Inside there are attached hinged cardboard pages that have alternating notches in the bottom corners to lift them. There are three sections delineated with attached parchment-type paper, The First Season: Discs 1 & 2, The Second Season: Discs 3-8 , Disc 9: the film ""Twin Peaks: Fire, Walk With Me"" and Disc 10: Special Features. This is the ONLY information about the set's contents in the box, and as I mentioned, there is NO booklet. Every disc is listed as having ""Special Features"" but except for the last disc, none are explained. That's one of the main reasons I'm writing this review, so it can be used or printed out as a reference for those interested. The discs are stored in slots within the back of the pages. At least one of mine was not properly glued together, causing the disc to slide out of the side of the ""page."" The bottom of the box has a ""hidden compartment"" with a special message. Each disc begins with the usual logos and warnings, then there's a choice of fourteen languages. Each disc has a ""Set Up"" option which include nine audio options (7.1 dts-HD, English stereo and seven dubs of other languages), and a choice of thirteen subtitles. None of the discs have an option for ""Chapters"" although all the Episodes HAVE them. I will list the number of Chapters on each Episode as I go along. My player's remote has an ""Options"" button that lets you choose a ""Chapter Search"" option, check your player's manual for it's location on yours. So on with the devil in the details...

DISC ONE: THE PILOT & EPISODES 1 & 2
Original Air Dates: Sunday, April 8, Thursday, April 12 and 19, 1990
Each disc has a different theme featuring scenes from the series playing in a loop, on Disc One it's ""Trees/Woods."" You then have a choice of ""Play All,"" ""Pilot,"" Episodes,"" ""Set Up"" and ""Special Features.""
When you choose ""Pilot"" you have 3 options, ""Log Lady Intro,"" ""Play Together"" and ""International Version."" The Log Lady Intros were filmed especially for the show's second run on the Bravo Channel. The ""International Version"" is the Pilot with added material at the end, some that appeared on later episodes and some that did not, that was released outside the U.S. as a stand-alone film. The Pilot has 10 chapters, the International Version has 11. If you just want to watch the material added to the International Version, go to Chapter 8 and then fast-forward to the 1:32:27 mark. From there on is the 21+ minutes of material added to the Pilot so they could release it overseas as a film with an ending.
Episodes 1 & 2 both have 6 chapters. They also have the options ""Play Episode,"" ""Log Lady Intro,"" ""Recap"" and "" ""Play All Together with Episode."" Episode 1 also has a ""Preview"" option...

From DISC TWO to DISC EIGHT every disc's Menu gives you the choice of ""Play All,"" ""Episodes,"" ""Set Up"" and ""Special Features."" If you choose ""Play All"" you're given the choice of ""Episode Only"" and ""With Episodic Extras."" All Episodes have 6 chapters unless noted. If you choose an Episode by itself you have the options ""Play Episode,"" ""Log Lady Intro,"" ""Recap,"" ""Preview"" and "" ""Play All Together with Episode,"" unless noted...

The ""Special Features"" are an ""Image Gallery,"" ""Twin Peeks Sneak Previews"" and ""Promos.""
The ""Image Gallery"" has three choices of photos, ""Season 1,"" ""Picnic"" and ""Ski Trip"" which is the most interesting since the segment that they represent never aired. You navigate through them with the < and > buttons on your remote.
The ""Twin Peaks Sneak Previews"" (2:51 total) are five ""Tonight On Twin Peaks"" commercials narrated by Kimmy Robertson in character.
The ""Promos"" have a ""Play All"" option and included ""See Twin Peaks From The Beginning,"" scenes from the first season with a voice-over by ""Agent Cooper"" (2:14) and ""Where Am I"" a short (0:35) promo where ""Agent Cooper"" lets viewers know that Episode 7 was going to be on Wednesday instead of Thursday...

Episode 8 was the second season opener, and has 9 chapters. It also doesn't have a ""Recap.""
The ""Special Features"" are ""A Slice Of Lynch: Uncut,"" ""Promos"" and ""Season 2 Image Gallery.""
""A Slice Of Lynch"" was originally a half-hour long conversation with David Lynch, Kyle MacLachlan, Mdchen Amick and the series' associate producer John Wentworth that was included in the Gold Box edition. Here it runs 0:55:33. They discuss various aspects about the production and it's genesis.
The ""Promos"" have a ""Play All"" option and include: ""There's No Place Like Home"" (0:35) made to remind viewers that the show had been moved from Saturday to Thursday, featuring MacLachlan, Catherine Coulson, Piper Laurie and Michael J. Anderson, ""T-Shirt Ad"" (0:34) hawks (sorry) the Official Twin Peaks Sheriff's Department T-Shirt, and features Al Strobel & Kimmy Robertson, ""Holiday Greeting"" (0:13) has no actors, ""Patriot Greeting"" (0:39) gives a shout out to the troops in the Gulf War with MacLachlan, Amick and Dana Ashbrook, and ""Big Game Promo"" (2:43), which has multiple takes of MacLachlan and Michael Ontkean in character preparing to watch the Cincinatti Bengals vs. the Seattle Seahawks which must've aired before Monday Night Football on October 1, 1990. The Image Gallery has photos from ""Season 2"" and ""Albert's Slides,"" photos of 'evidence on microscope slides' props...

DISC FOUR: EPISODES 11-12-13-14
Original Air Dates: Saturday, October 20 & 27, November 3 & 10, 1990
The Menu theme is ""Coffee""
The ""Special Features"" are ""Series Deleted Scenes"" (14:07 total) and ""Outtakes"" (2:14).
Their are twelve ""Series Deleted Scenes"" (many ported over from the 'Gold Box Edition') with the option to ""Play All."" All the Special Features material has NOT been remastered. I'm listing the titles as shown but not revealing details, that's for you to discover and enjoy! The deleted scenes are ""Cooper and Donna Talk About Picnic"" (0:25), ""Picnic"" (0:55), ""Cooper and Truman Gazebo"" (0:35), ""Mayor's Speech"" (1:35), ""Lucy and Racoons"" (0:25), ""16MM Period Piece"" (:48), ""Bobby Coaches Shelly"" (1:13), ""Lucy and Deputy Andy"" (1:24), ""Jerry's Wandering Eye"" (0:53*), ""27 Going On 6"" (1:33*), ""Lucy, Andy, and Donuts"" (0:53*) and ""Something About Johnny"" (0:48*). Some of these reveal further background information, especially about Johnny Horne. Those marked (*) were also on the GOLD BOX SET.
The ""Outtakes"" are basically just over two-minutes of Cooper and Truman on stakeout plus them standing in a sort of haze. These really don't add anything at all...

Episode 23 doesn't have a ""Preview"" option, but Episode 24 has a longer than usual preview, probably because the show hadn't be on for five weeks.

The Menu theme is ""Owls""
There are no ""Previews"" on this disc except for ""Lucy's Special Announcement"" on Episode 27. Episodes 28 and 29 were originally broadcast back-to-back. Obviously, the last episode has no ""Recap.""
The ""Special Feature"" is the ""making of"" documentary: ""Secrets from Another Place: Creating Twin Peaks.""

The Special Feature is ""Archival Interviews."" The Menu has the usual ""Play All"" and ""Set Up"" options.

The Feature Film ""TWIN PEAKS: Fire Walk With Me"" (2:14:33) has 41 chapters. This HD transfer is beautiful and won't be topped until they invent home 3-D holograms (and I don't know if I'd want Bob in my living room). People who complain about the missing cast members from the TV version have to understand that they weren't necessary to the story until after the murder. The only other thing I can say is, after watching this now for the upteenth time, is that I still find it as valid and compelling as when I first saw it in the theater. Powerful stuff...

""The Missing Pieces: Deleted/Alternate Scenes"" (1:31:25)
Since this extra is long-awaited and the big news about this set, There are 35 (!) in all. The ""Special Feature"" is ""Archival Interviews"" (5:25) with a ""Play All"" option. The interviews are with Ray Wise (0:39), Sheryl Lee (1:56), Moira Kelly (1:00) and Mdchen Amick (1:50). In my opinion they are lousy and add not one wit of new info....

Credits: 14 pages using the < and  > buttons....

FEATURES COMPARISON:
I never owned the VHS set because I taped the whole shebang and any specials or interviews I could find. I never bought the LaserDiscs because the price point was too high. I had the Artisan First Season set and the CBS Second Season set. Could it really be thirteen years since the release of the Artisan set?! From what I can remember, since I only watched the extras once, all of that set's extras are here except for the director's commentaries and the ""Script Notes: Optional Guide to the 'Unseen Twin Peaks' feature. These were never ported over to the GOLD BOX SET as well. As soon as the GOLD BOX SET was announced I sold the previous sets and purchased it. Again, everything on that set is here but a few exceptions, mainly the postcards, the Saturday Night Live clips when Kyle MacLachlan hosted, and the ""Falling"" music video. I never cared for the SNL material, too broad and stupid, if you really want to watch it, it's on YouTube along with the music video. ""Reflections On The Phenomenon Of Twin Peaks"" was on the New Line ""TWIN PEAKS: Fire Walk With Me"" DVD....

IN SUMMATION (!There ARE Spoilers ahead!):
It should be obvious by now that I'm a TWIN PEAKS fan. My first David Lynch movie was ERASERHEAD. Now there's an off-the-wall film. Next I saw THE ELEPHANT MAN and was impressed how he implemented his style in a mainstream movie. The next was the premier showing (in my area) of BLUE VELVET, which I took a blind date to. Needless to say, it didn't work out so well, but hey, if she didn't like David Lynch...so, anyhow, when TWIN PEAKS was hyped I told my then more hip girlfriend that we had to catch David Lynch's vision of prime-time TV! We became instant fans and advocates, I even had a letter printed in TV Guide defending it from critics! So what went wrong? Well, as many point out, ABC didn't know what to do with it. The First Season did great because the Sunday pilot had everyone talking about it the next day at work, which was quickly followed by the initial seven regular episodes, all on consecutive Thursdays. It was the Second Season when they really screwed it up. Although it premiered again on a Sunday, they buried the next sixteen episodes in the Saturday TV graveyard. Even worse, it had three hiatuses, for one week, then three, then two. It ran another three consecutive weeks, and then disappeared for another FIVE weeks. During that time, ABC was going to just cancel it and not show the last six contracted episodes, but enough fans made them change their minds. It resurfaced on a Thursday, where it played for four consecutive weeks, then disappeared again for seven weeks and four days, when they finally showed the two remaining episodes back-to-back on Monday, June 10, 1991. Whew! even Rodney Dangerfield got more respect. The other deciding factor in it's demise has to ride on the shoulders of producers David Lynch and Mark Frost. They just lost interest until the end, when cancellation loomed they made an attempt at a Hail! Mary pass, but it was too late. The Second Season came out strong at the gate, but after they solved the mystery, resulting in the end of actor Ray Wise's tenure, the show began floundering. In my opinion, Ray Wise's emotional performance as Leland Palmer was a tour-de-force. His ability to play a good man, a loving man, haunted and tortured by demons from the dark side, changing personalities in a nanosecond, was unparalleled. The fact that he was never even nominated for an Emmy is a sin. The direction the show went was also a sin. TWIN PEAKS' blend of mystery, drama and comedy was laced with just the perfect amount of the supernatural and science-fiction, where it went wrong was adding fantasy. The plot line of Nadine's super-strength was just plain dumb, an amnesia plot maybe, but the former was just plain ridiculous. With all the SUPER original cast, did the have to bring in Ian Buchanan and David L. Lander's comic relief? Was I the only one who thought the whole James and Evelyn arc stunk to high heaven? Windom Earle wasn't a bad idea, but instead of it being foreboding they had him play dress-up so many times it was unbelievable. Don't you think that after finding out the first time that he was in the area that there would be posters, and news reports, and searches, and at least some heightened vigilance? There was so much they could've done with the characters everyone knew and loved and tuned in to see. Did Audrey have to have an affair with the quickly in-and-out (literally) John Justice Wheeler? She and Bobby were working together, couldn't they get together? They'd been showing Donna trying to act as tough and jaded as Laura, why didn't they develop that? A main character going into a downward spiral, then possibly targeted by another BOB possessed character, say Dr. Jacoby would've been better than her pining for James. And why not build up Jerry Horne? or Hawk? or have Mike and Nadine have a serious affair? Why not bring back Ray Wise as his brother? Well, by now I'm sure you get my drift. The show began to pull together at the end, but again, it was too little too late. At least we eventually got the prequel, FIRE WALK WITH ME. The bottom line is this, even after watching it so many times over so many years, when I started to watch this set I couldn't wait for the next episode. TWIN PEAKS holds up as a phenomena that earned it's title, and will surely be watched, and discussed for generations to come, or the next cup 'o' joe and slice of cherry pie is on me......",1459900800,7,28287,5.1335214937038645
6142067,5,B00H9BFV98,"The picture quality is phenomenal and the special features are fantastic.  Especially on the Fire Walk With Me discs.  The missing pieces are all there and you get to see the complete version of the movie.

My only minor issue with this set is there's no episode guide booklet to give information for each episode, and it doesn't include the SNL Sketch with Kyle Maclachlan in the special features.  But luckily, I can always watch the gold collection set to watch that.

But despite those minor things, it's still a must have for any Twin Peaks fan.",1459468800,3,550,4.628865979381444

6142069,2,B00H9BFV98,"I recently got  round to replacing my DVD player with a Blu Ray and the first thing I wanted to do was order this box set which I've wanted ever since it came out as I'm a bit obsessed by TP. I read the reviews and so knew that I should check certain dics and episodes for sync issues. When it arrived I was completely giddy, the packaging was gorgeous and I grabbed out the 'Missing Pieces' disc and stuck it in. Everything was fine at first , the picture quality was fantastic and the sound even better but then the sync issues hit. I checked other discs (eg disc 3 which I'd also been warned about) and in random places the same issues occurred, sometimes subtle sometimes appallingly bad. I was totally gutted and with great reluctance have sent the boxset back for a refund. If it had been just the odd scene I would've ignored it but the issue appears in many places. This came over 18 months ago so I thought by now these known issues would have been sorted - clearly not (despite what some have said here).

It's such a shame, especially as Lynch is known for being a perfectionist, especially about audio stuff. So much for modern technology, hope this is not a regular issue with Blu Rays.",1458000000,9,1199,4.348214285714286

6142073,5,B00H9BFV98,"Picture and sound quality is perfect, just be aware that this show is pre widescreen so you will have pillar boxing (black bars on the sides of the picture) a little annoying but the show is 4x3 not 16x9 so it is what it is.

Would rate it 5, but the sets design is flimsy. One of the info sheets to season 2 have tore off just by flipping it up and the bottom cardboard piece was not glued to the bottom of the box.

6142077,5,B00H9BFV98,"When I wrote my first review I was so excited to possess this box set, but unfortunately there was a factory defect on the seventh disc.
I called Amazon customer service and the nice man on the line offered me Amazon credit to purchase a new one and sent an email with free postage to return the defective set. He gave me Amazon credit for $91.99 although I originally paid $20 less.
I'm happy to report that every Blu-ray Disc in this set is pristine :D
Since I'm very sick and therefore greatly appreciate the little things in life, I thank Amazon for their understanding in my wanting to have a perfect blu-ray set of one of the greatest shows to ever grace prime-time television and one of the most grossly underrated films in history including deleted scenes!

Fire Walk With Me is a prequel so I didn't bother (I read that viewers of it at the premiere could not even think of dinner after watching it, so the film makers had to tone it down). No redeeming social value, except for the sheriff and Hawk (for me, Hawk and the Log Lady were the most interesting of the bunch and probably the sanest).

It is a setting issues either on people's TV or Blu-Ray player. But I repeat, as of June 22, 2015, there is not one issue with the audio on the Blu-Ray version of this series.

I had hoped there would be a 'fixed version' of this release (as I am sure many people would agree), but after it didn't happen, I decided I still wanted to enjoy this thing I had waited so long for!  And it is awesome!  I still haven't watched all of the special features...there are many extras!  Since I purchase this, I have read many comments and tried some of the fixes.  One person gave a suggestion that seems to have worked for me.  I have watched most of, but not all of the scenes I noticed the synch issues in...so I can't be sure it's all better, but many scenes I know were troublesome were definitely working for me.  My Blu-ray player is a Sony BDP-S570 (5-6 years old).  Go into 'Screen Settings' (on the Blu-ray machine, not the TV), and change the 'BD/DVD 1080/24P output' from 'Auto' to 'Off'.  The same person said to set audio to 'Bitstream Unprocessed', but my audio settings did not have that choice.  I only add it because this fix may work on other Blu-ray players as well...you just have to experiment.  Either way, even though I am buying this Twin Peaks collection for the 3rd time, the HD quality and the' never-before-included' extras are very worth it...",1433808000,9,1383,4.46215139442231

Excellent Blu-Ray transfer and great extras (it's so wonderful to finally have everything, and I do mean *everything*, in one place). This is an amazing compilation, and well worth every penny. The care, detail to attention, and painstaking love with which it was converted and assembled is palpable. I hope everyone who worked on this project gets a cup of damn fine coffee and a slice of cherry pie.

I'm using this compilation to show the series to my wife for the first time -- we were both in our mid-teens when it originally aired, and I watched it contemporaneously while her parents objected to the contents. Watching her face as we go through it is *hysterical*. (She is completely unspoiled, and keeps bursting out with ""WAIT WHAT JUST HAPPENED THIS SHOW IS MESSING WITH MY BRAIN"", at which point I reassure her that no, it's not supposed to make sense yet, just roll with it. It's great.)

If you've never seen Twin Peaks, you owe it to yourself to buy this compilation and see the show that defined so much of serial television that came after it. If you have seen Twin Peaks, you owe it to yourself to buy this compilation and revel in the quality of the remaster.

It will answer many of the questions posed by the finale. If you want to see Sheryl Lee & Ray Wise talking about the 1990 show in 2014, go to YouTube. But back to the DVDs. What are some of the highlights?  David Duchovny appears in woman's clothes & makeup, which likely got him the part for the X-Files.

6142115,5,B00H9BFV98,"'It is happening again.' I was (and still am) a huge Twin Peaks fan when the show was originally on the air and was there for all of the craziness of how this show captured the world's attention. When this bluray set was announced I was so excited! Not just because of the fact that Lynch and co. had finally agreed to release the deleted scenes from Fire Walk With Me but because if you truly want to 'experience' something that is on film the only way to go is with bluray. I'm seeing things in the background that I never saw before while watching this show and I can admit that I taped the series when it was originally aired and watched each episode again and again to pick up clues to who the killer was. The colors are so vibrant they almost leap off the screen! The sound is excellant, which one expects from a David Lynch production. The 'bonus' of this set is of course the deleted scenes from Fire Walk With Me, which Twin Peaks fans have waited years to see. They are well worth the price of admission! At 1 1/2 hours of new material, it's like experiencing a brand new Lynch film! Lynch didn't cheat us here- the visuals and sound of the same quality as the rest of set! Exquisite! There are fascinating interviews with cast and crew members and an especially cool one where Lynch 'interviews' the Palmer Family actors (Sheryl Lee, Ray Wise and Grace Zabrinski) first as themselves and then again as the Palmer family. The only negative thing I can say about this set is that it has an end. I just didn't want to leave the town or the people of Twin Peaks behind.",1429228800,,1576,4.327702702702703

Throw all those blurry VHS copies/Japanese DVD bootlegs away, bc this is a thing of beauty, from the box design (including rice paper) to the BluRay menus (supercuts of coffee, messages, scenery, and more, it's a beautiful loop). The BluRay, sourced from the film negatives, occasionally shows what the TV used to hide like obvious make-up, and very rarely the quality drops when source material was for some reason not available (like in some double exposure shots). For the most part, the image is beautiful--you've never seen it this way, I guarantee.
However it does not make the James-bikes-to-another-town, winds-up-in-a-Cinemax-erotic-thriller subplot any less painful. Sorry! :P",1426982400,3,717,5.468468468468468
6142122,5,B00H9BFV98,"All I can say is this: Through the darkness of future past, CBS, Paramount and the purgatory that is European financing acted like grown up magicians and gave us what we all longed to see: a beautiful, complete blu ray box set of the series and Fire Walk With Me!

So finally it's here. I waited for at least six months as I normally do with box sets and got a huge reduction in the price. You should be able to get this for around 80 dollars. I got mine at the hight of Sync-gate wen numerous copies were purported to have faulty sound synchronization in many parts of the updated soundtrack. Mine and many others are completely unaffected by this, so it would seem Amazon fixed the problem with the distributer.

All in all this is any Twin Peaks fan's dream. Especially ""The Missing Pieces."" If you are someone who, like me, would go hungry for a week just to get my hands on any piece of information providing insight into the world Lynch and Frost created, than this is pretty much the holy grail and you need not go hungry.

The biggest complaint I've heard, other than the sound issue, which in my opinion is a manufacturing defect and should not be held against the creators, is the sleeves the discs come in. I personally find it completely stupid to complain about it. They look so much better than the gold box DVD holders, which may have protected the discs better and that's a strong ""may."" Any cinephile should know how to handle a disc in such a way that it won't get damaged, no matter what it is cases in.

The other complaint I hear is the only con I somewhat agree with, and that is th fact that there is no itemized list of what special features are on what disc. This may have been an oversight. In my opinion this does not take away from the actual viewing experience so I don't really care that much.
The picture and sound are amazing. I often find that shows and movies shot on film do not not translate well to the high-def format, but twin peaks is not one of those.
Overall this is a must have for diehard fans, as well as a great set for new fans who do not own the gold box set. It is certainly worth it to own both, namely due to the inclusion of Fire Walk With Me (prequel film by Lynch) and The missing Pieces.",1426896000,3,2242,4.255868544600939

Set in the pacific northwest, this brooding series is vintage David Lynch: offbeat, dark, surreal, and oftentimes left to ones own interpretation. Of course, the icing is Angelo Badalamenti's signature soundtrack that is mood-setting for sure. I highly recommend this set for old and new fans alike.",1426550400,,739,5.166666666666667

The Blu-ray set is just phenomenally done. Every episode, uncut, plus the movie and 90 minutes of deleted scenes. The A/V quality is probably as good as it's ever going to get and the packaging is gorgeous. Since streaming appears to be the future of media, this will likely be the definitive final word on Twin Peaks as far as tangibility goes. If you're having audio problems, it's probably your Blu-ray player since I bought this the week it came out and never had any issues with it.

Long live Agent Cooper and long live fixing myself a snack during James scenes. Can't wait for 2016. Maybe Coop and Audrey will finally hook up since Lara Flynn Boyle is fug now.

The show looks great, the special features are not a waste of time, and finally, I was impressed with how well the Fire Walk With Me film has aged.  I was one of the many who didn't find it all that great when it first came, but time has proved it to be a haunting, weird, horrific, sad, and brilliant piece of work.  Now the show does have it's ups and downs (James Hurley's story line in the middle of season 2 is just a train wreck that doesn't belong), but the pluses have always outweighed the minuses to me.  I even liked the ending.  It wasn't the intended end, but it works as a dark, poetic statement on good and evil.  If you are fan, you'll love it.  Otherwise this may not be for you.
ABOUT THE AUDIO SYNC ISSUES:  I hate to say this, but this may very well be an issue with your Blu Ray player.  Maybe the problem was fixed though, I don't know.  But I can tell you that I had problems like this all the time until I bought a Sony Player.  The unfortunately reality of Blu Ray is, if you want the format done right, you have to go along with ones who invented it.  I had 2 players before I bought a Sony, and both had audio sync issues.

Most of the sound is centered on the front soundstage, the center channel specifically.  You'll need a subwoofer as well as there's a lot of information there.

Video: B-

I wish they put more effort in cleaning this set up. While the video looks decent on my 50"" TV, the digital video noise, grain and inconsistency from scene to scene are glaringly apparent on my front projector. I compared stills from my dvd set, there's only a minor improvement in detail.

Und nun also diese BD-Box. Schon die Gestaltung ist absolut fabelhaft und die opulenten Extras zur TV-Serie lassen keine Wnsche offen. Fr (unfreiwillige) Komik sorgen die UT bei den Vorschauen, wenn beispielsweise Shelley nach einer Bewegung des komatsen Leo erschreckt ""He moved!"" ruft und dies mit ""Er ist umgezogen"" bersetzt wird.

Zur Bild- und besonders Tonqualitt mchte ich mich nicht nher auslassen, dafr gibt es wesentlich kompetentere Rezensenten, daher nur soviel: Ich bin damit mehr als zufrieden, man darf ja nicht vergessen, dass das Material 25 Jahre auf dem Buckel hat.

Zum (in meinen Augen viel zu schlecht bewerteten) Kinofilm ""Fire walk with me"" gibt es 90 Minuten bisher unverffentlichte oder gekrzte Szenen und allein schon deswegen lohnt sich die Anschaffung der Box. Man sieht etwa einen Boxkampf von Agent Desmond mit dem rtlichen Sheriff oder Lelands Erpressung durch Teresa Banks; auch die Rolle von Agent Jeffries (David Bowie) wird nun viel deutlicher. Dazu kommen Auftritte von Pete Martell, Josie, Doc Jacoby, den Haywards, Nadine, Big Ed und des Sheriff-Teams von Twin Peaks, die allesamt in der Kinofassung fehlten. Hier kehrt auch der (vielfach schwarze) Humor der TV-Serie wieder, der dem Film vllig abging. Ein weiterer Hhepunkt auf Disc 10 ist ein gespenstisch groartiges Interview von David Lynch mit der Palmer-Family, absolut sehenswert.

Man muss allen Beteiligten, besonders aber David Lynch und Mark Frost dankbar sein, dass sie nach all den jahrelangen Querelen um Serie und Film einen riesigen Beitrag geleistet haben, damit Fans wie wir jetzt endlich das ultimative Twin Peaks-Erlebnis genieen drfen. Nur eine (etwas unrealistische) Bitte htte ich noch: Der Gute Dale ist jetzt seit 25 Jahren in der Schwarzen Htte, dreht eine Fortsetzung und holt ihn endlich da raus!

Midway through the second season uninteresting subplots seem to get the upper hand (David Lynch seemed to have been working on other projects during that time) but in the last 5 episodes Twin Peaks returns to its original high quality to end with what's probably the most disturbing finale of any television series. I have not gone through all the extras yet, but there is a lot of stuff in the box and especially looking forward to the 1 1/2 hours of extra scenes from the movie.

6142192,5,B00H9BFV98,"""TWIN PEAKS: THE ENTIRE MYSTERY"" Review

The transfers are superb. The audio is excellent. This set is chock full of worthwhile special features. The most exciting of these special features is of course many of the deleted scenes from ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me"". They were very nice to see.

There are numerous interviews with cast and crew, along with ""Between Two Worlds"", a wonderful new featurette of David Lynch interviewing Ray Wise, Grace Zabrisikie, and Sheryl Lee as the characters they portrayed.

I was delightfully surprised to find that the entire Twin Peak trading-card set had been included on disk 5.

Everything is here from both versions of the pilot to the prequel film, along with the intervening 29 complete episodes. The set also includes Log Lady introductions to each episode, recaps, and previews (standard NTSC definition rather than HD), which can be set to run with the episodes. Additionally, lots of things like commercial bumpers, advertisements, and messages from the old 1-900 number have been preserved here as well.

My complaints are slight. In episode 9 (I think), Maddy sees the carpet in the living room disturbed. In the Asian version (Japanese), she sees Bob's face in the carpet. The Asian alteration was not included anywhere in the set.

While it is great to see so many missing scenes of ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me"", they must be watched separately from the film. Fortunately, they are included on the same disk as the full feature film. It still behooves David Lynch to render a final cut of ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me"". The entire film needs to be stitched together in its full four or more hours of glory in the way that David Lynch originally intended.

Having read the script years ago, I am aware that as envisioned, the bulk of the film was mean to give a day-by-day account of the last week of Laura Palmer's life, including screen titles for transitions to each day. That narrative was interrupted in the process of editing the film down to 1990s maximum theater-length tolerance of two hours and fifteen minutes. Here we are, just a hair over Cooper's vision of twenty-five years later, and there is just a little more work left to be done in order to fully set the matter straight in the form of a truly final and proper version of the prequel film. I would gladly drop another thirty bucks for that.

The set appears to contain Easter Eggs only on disks 1 and 10. Disk 1 contains hidden snippets of cast interviews, most of which are not very interesting. Disk 10 contains only two Easter Eggs, both of which are quite interesting. ""The Bet"" is most especially memorable.

The sound has been remixed, allowing the listener to hear in original stereo English or 7.1 DTS surround. Surround effects are very mild. Additional soundtracks in various languages are available. Even more languages are available as subtitles.

Egregiously missing for me are Korean subtitles, which is especially sad because the subtitles do exist, being that ""Twin Peaks"" was broadcast in Korea, and I have the Korean DVD edition of ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me"". One of the most ridiculous and profoundly stupid oversights of the entire Blu-ray endeavor was in failing to enable Blu-ray players with web capacity to expand available subtitles. Aside from basic and profound stupidity, there is no actual reason that Blu-rays could not have simply added additional subtitle options long after the fact of publishing. Subtitle files are TINY!

These disks are region free. Hence, a set purchased in any region should operate perfectly in any other region, occasionally prompting fans to purchase from Europe, being that European prices for this set seem to be considerably cheaper than US prices, though I personally got burned in attempting to do this and wound up ordering from amazon.com at a price of $120 plus international shipping.

No running commentaries are included in the set.

A rather irritating feature comes with loading each disk. First, one must suffer through a brief CBS animated logo. Then, one is given a language menu. This is followed by an utterly hideous and nearly intolerable DTS demonstration, which plays MUCH, MUCH more loudly than ANYTHING contained on the rest of the disks. This cannot be skipped. Finally, before getting to the menu, one must suffer through the standard ridiculous corporate disclaimer regarding opinions expressed. Only after all of the above ordeals have been endured is the consumer free to peruse the contents of each disk. I used to have a DVD player which would crack all of the DVD coding and shoot directly into playing the main feature when a disk was inserted, skipping all of the preliminary junk, regardless of format or encoding (playing PAL as easily as NTSC). I wish that I could find such a Blu-ray player.

Add to that the inclusion of FIRE WALK WITH ME along with an entire disc of content for that film makes owning this set a no-brainer for me.

The only knock I can give this release is that the DVD commentaries are sadly missing which is something that can only be attributed to either laziness or some lame back-end deal that made the commentaries exclusive to the releases they were recorded for.

The whole thing will probably fall apart over time if you are not careful, it's not made for efficiency, but I don't think the discs are likely to get scratched. They should have made it with a plastic slip case to protect the cover.

I have not had a chance to watch through the entire series, but seems more than acceptable so far. As for the audio sync problems reported with disc 9, I do not have any major problems. Maybe a few scenes are a fraction out of sync if you pay attention, but hardly a deal breaker, wouldn't bother even mentioning them if there wasn't the controversy. Lots of typical odd Lynch in the missing pieces, including a particularly deranged eccentric performance by David Bowie that seems like he is channeling Matthew McConaughey, and Bowie may have wished stayed missing.",1407801600,3,998,4.638418079096045
6142209,5,B00H9BFV98,"I was eleven years old when this television show made its debut.  My mother was instantly hooked, and even though it was a bit much for a child my age, so I.  I saw an article on a popular news & nonsense site about the ""Missing Pieces"" being released and thought to myself, ""Hey, that show was rad, I wonder if I can stream it.""  It was ten o'clock at night and I was in bed, but I promptly got up and went to see if I could find the series.  Find it I did and watched both seasons as quickly as I could.  I couldn't wait to receive this boxed set.  I forgot how crazy and weird this show and movie were.  I am from Seattle, so I am instantly drawn to just about anything that is filmed in the PNW (yes, I am now 35 years old and still miss home although I haven't lived there in ten years, no judging).  Also I love 80's & 90's television.  Most of it is better than what we have today.  There might be some feeling of nostalgia involved too.

Okay let's get on with it.  The box itself is pretty nifty, although the merged images of Prom Queen Laura and wrapped in plastic Laura are a bit freaky... I had it on my nightstand to watch in the bedroom and she had to go into a drawer.  The box isn't thin and flimsy, it's well crafted, and unlike any other box set I own (all of them are the thin, individual plastic dvd cases in a box), each DVD is in it's own sleeve with a picture from the series on it, as well as a description (season number, episode numbers) of what is on the disc.

Now I haven't watched the Blu-Rays of the actual television show, just ""Fire Walk with Me"" and ""The Missing Pieces"" since i just watched the full two seasons (although I admit that I am going to re-watch the series again in Blu-Ray because I can, also, two season and a movie just aren't enough for me) and they are of good quality.  The sound with the movie is a touch off occasionally, but I wasn't too shocked by it since it is now around a 25 year old show.  It didn't bother me much or take away from the movie as if you got a bad copy.

""The Missing Pieces"" was pretty interesting.  The title is suiting, and my description will be vague as I do not want to ruin it for anyone.  A lot of little holes in the movie and the series were plugged, which is the intent.  Any fan of the ""Twin Peaks"" saga will want to watch it.

Check out the comments on the CBS Home Entertainment page on Facebook. This is a widespread problem.

Don't believe people who say they don't have audio issues, or that there is a fix for audio sync. They are most likely shills for CBS.

The audio can't be adjusted by delaying the audio because the audio shifts from being ahead of video to being behind. There is no consistency to the audio - it goes in and out of sync.

Some discs don't have the problem, others do. The deleted scenes on the Fire Walk With Me disc are among the worst of all.

What idiot designed this? An accordion-type of cardboard file glued (supposedly!) into a simple cheap cardboard box.

And there were loose cardboard and paper pieces scattered about of which I couldn't make head or tail. (I thought for a second it was a Lynch 'puzzle'!)  What I saw horrified me -- especially when I considered the price I paid which wasn't cheap!  And even if this set had arrived correctly, the design is quintessentially AWFUL -- you can't even keep it open at a certain disc without holding it open with your hands -- otherwise, it closes!

To make matters worse... not only does the set provide NO details as to what the special features are on any disc (it just says 'Special Features'), there is NO BOOKLET! Even a crappy CD you buy at a thrift store usually has a few pages of a booklet with the songs, pics of the singer, info, SOMETHING! This has NOTHING! NOTHING about this CLASSIC SHOW!!!!

A TOTALLY CHEAPO JOB, and worthy of total distain as a set! It should get the Worst Box Set of the Year for 2014!

(HOWEVER, I love the show, and the quality is superb as to the Blu-rays. And the special features are excellent for the most part.)

The one good thing, twice I returned the set for a refund, and twice Amazon gave me a full refund.  KUDOS TO AMAZON!  THUMBS DOWN TO PARAMOUNT!

PS: I just wanted to add that Paramount has redesigned their ""Ten Commandments"" box set, and justifiably deep-sixed their lousy yellow plastic disc container.  Now you can buy the deluxe DeMille set and it's top-notch.  (I wish the same could be said for this lousy ""Twin Peaks"" box!!!!  They really need to redo this!!!)",1407542400,14,2267,4.618453865336658

David Lynch to me is in retirement he's not releasing anything anymore. So this is his latest new/old release. He looks tired old and out of ideas. And I don't own a blu ray player.

...except for the packaging.

While the box itself is magnificent--a true work of art--the disc cases are shoddy as hell. My set arrived with a giant scratch on the first disc, which is a fairly common problem from what I've been hearing from other people. Why exactly David Lynch, or whoever it was who designed this thing, would want to use these horrific cardboard slip-in cases in such a beautiful box is beyond me. These things have been proven to be scratch-creating pieces of fecal matter over and over again.

It's a classic example of the designer placing a higher priority on aesthetic beauty over functionality and disc safety.

For a hundred dollar product, it's unacceptable for the discs to arrive in anything other than mint condition and these slip-in cases are a potential disaster waiting to happen for anyone who orders this thing.

Other than that, the set is awesome. Great picture quality for one of, if not THEE best television shows of all time.",1407283200,8,1173,4.758620689655173
6142221,5,B00H9BFV98,"A QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE SHOW ITSELF (see THE BLU-RAY SET section below for information on complaints about the set's quality)...

'TWIN PEAKS' was originally conceived as a crime-drama-mystery, but became so much more, including an instant cultural phenomena after it's debut on the ABC Network on April 8, 1990. Created by cult director David Lynch (THE ELEPHANT MAN,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BLUE-VELVET/dp/B005HT400A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BLUE VELVET</a>, MULHOLLAND DRIVE) and writer/producer Mark Frost (HILL STREET BLUES, FANTASTIC FOUR), the series started off strong, due to a successful publicity campaign and people's curiosity to see how David Lynch's aesthetic would translate to network TV.  The two-hour pilot, which aired on a Sunday, was seen by a third of the TV viewing audience and the following seven episodes of the first season benefited greatly from ""the water cooler effect,"" people discussing it at work the next day. Unfortunately ABC began to broadcast the following episodes on Thursday nights, in competition  with NBC's strong ""must-see TV"" line-up. Viewership began to drop, but when the last episode of the first series was broadcast on a Wednesday at 10pm, the ratings improved. The second season originally did OK, but the domino-effect of ABC constantly shuffling it's time-slot, numerous preemptions caused by the Gulf War and viewership disinterest after the main plot, the murder of Laura Palmer, was solved halfway through, resulted in the series' cancellation. The show however lived on in reruns (Bravo), home video (VHS, LaserDisc, DVD & Blu-ray) and various homages (THE SIMPSONS, SNL, PSYCH), eventually becoming a pop-culture touchstone. It's influence on the look, writing, casting and music of the many shows that followed (WILD PALMS, PICKET FENCES, THE X-FILES, LOST) and television in general is immeasurable and continues to this day...

Although the initial plot was the investigation into the murder of Laura Palmer, the show was much, much more than a routine crime drama. The combination of gruesome murders and violence mixed with off-kilter humor and satire, liberally sprinkled with elements of the supernatural and science fiction was fresh and new, like nothing ever seen before on television. The music was also a strong component, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/haunting-soundtrack-by-Angelo-Badalamenti/dp/B000002LMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">haunting soundtrack by Angelo Badalamenti</a>, song lyrics by Lynch himself, and the other-worldly vocal&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/performances-by-Julee-Cruise/dp/B000002LH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">performances by Julee Cruise</a>&nbsp;and the late Jimmy Scott were like a breath of cool, clean mountain air. Watching the show again, one of it's strengths is it's timeless look. Except for some anachronistic corded telephones and 1990's computer equipment, it doesn't seem dated at all. Part of this could be attributed to the show's use of classic cars and fashions throughout the series, never bowing to any fads that would tie it to a specific era. Another factor was the numerous homages to classic movies and TV shows. This was especially true with the casting and character's names, here are some examples:

Many of the actors appeared or worked in Lynch's films, Jack Nance (ERASERHEAD, DUNE, BLUE VELVET), Charlotte Stewart and Catherine Coulson (ERASERHEAD), Kyle MacLachlan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DUNE/dp/B00371QQ0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DUNE</a>, BLUE VELVET), Grace Zabriskie (WILD AT HEART) and Everett McGill & Alicia Witt (DUNE)

Richard Beymer (Ben Horne) and Russ Tamblyn (Dr. Jacoby) co-starred in the film version of the famous musical WEST SIDE STORY

Peggy Lipton (Norma Jennings) and Clarence Williams III (FBI Agent Hardy) co-starred in the classic TV show THE MOD SQUAD

THE FUGITIVE, the famous TV series about an innocent man on the run searching for his wife's killer featured a one-armed man and an inspector named Philip Gerrard. Lynch and Frost borrowed the former for a character and named him after the later

The show was a last hurrah for Hank Worden (The Waiter) and Royal Dano (Judge Sternwood), both well-known character actors, especially in westerns, including JOHNNY GUITAR (Dano) and THE SEARCHERS (Worden). The show was actually Worden's last acting credit, he died two years later at the age of 91. Dano was only active for another two years, passing away at 71 in 1994. Between them they appeared in over 400 films and TV shows!

Billy Wilder's film SUNSET BLVD., about the denizens of Hollywood, featured characters named Norma and Gordon Cole

Michael Parks (Jean Renault) starred in the cult TV show THEN CAME BRONSON and had a Top 40 hit with ""Long Lonesome Highway"" in 1970. He recently starred in both films within the Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarantino film homage GRINDHOUSE

Jane Greer (Vivian Smythe Niles) was the femme-fatale in the famous film-noir OUT OF THE PAST starring Robert Mitchum and Kirk Douglas. She also starred with Mitchum in the lesser know noir ""The Big Steal.""

The character of Judge Sternwood (Royal Dano) shares the same surname as the Sternwood clan from the great John Huston film THE BIG SLEEP starring Humphrey Bogart

Fans of the classic film-noir LAURA got a chuckle when it was discovered that the mynah bird WALDO was a patient of Dr. LYDECKER. And of course there's that Palmer girl...

Laura's lookalike cousin Madeleine shares the same moniker as the object of James Stewart's obsession (played by Kim Novak) in Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece of identity, obsession and murder, VERTIGO

The insurance agent that tries to get Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie) to sign the DOUBLE INDEMNITY insurance policy is named WALTER NEFF

There are many cameos from artists such as Molly Shannon (SNL), David L. Lander (Laverne & Shirley), musician Van Dyke Parks, singer Jimmy Scott and actors Alicia Witt, David Warner and Frances Bay

TWIN PEAKS was also a proving ground for a few little-known actors that became well-known stars, including Laura Flynn Boyle (Donna Hayward), a young cute Heather Graham (Annie Blackburn) still with a little ""baby fat"" (NOT a dig), Miguel Ferrer (FBI Agent Albert Rosenfield), David Duchovny (DEA Agent Bryson), Billy Zane (John Justice Wheeler) and Carel Struycken (The Giant)...

THE BLU-RAY SET:
First of all, I couldn't imagine the visuals looking any finer. The HD transfer is reference quality, just beautiful, it blows-away every previous home-video version, and I've owned quite a few of them! EVERYTHING is closed-captioned. The dts-HD lossless audio is a big improvement on the previous releases as well. I don't know if it's me, but when this was originally broadcast I had an early 5.1 surround system and remember the sound mix to be uniquely off-kilter, as if they were ""painting with sound."" None of the home video releases seemed true to this mix, which I actually preferred and felt was more complimentary to the visuals, but whatever, no one will complain about the sound here. There've been scattered audio sync complaints about FWWM, but I haven't had any with newer SONY multi-region player. The set comes in a 7""x6""x2"" textured box with a die-cut lid and raised lettering with a cloth stay to keep the lid open. Very handsome, but clumsy. There have been many complaints about the quality of the box itself and the lack of a booklet or detailed information. Inside there are attached hinged cardboard pages that have alternating notches in the bottom corners to lift them. There are three sections delineated with attached parchment-type paper, The First Season: Discs 1 & 2, The Second Season: Discs 3-8 , Disc 9: the film ""Twin Peaks: Fire, Walk With Me"" and Disc 10: Special Features. This is the ONLY information about the set's contents in the box, and as I mentioned, there is NO booklet. Every disc is listed as having ""Special Features"" but except for the last disc, none are explained. That's one of the main reasons I'm writing this review, so it can be used or printed out as a reference for those interested. The discs are stored in slots within the back of the pages. At least one of mine was not properly glued together, causing the disc to slide out of the side of the ""page."" The bottom of the box has a ""hidden compartment"" with a special message. Each disc begins with the usual logos and warnings, then there's a choice of fourteen languages. Each disc has a ""Set Up"" option which include nine audio options (7.1 dts-HD, English stereo and seven dubs of other languages), and a choice of thirteen subtitles. None of the discs have an option for ""Chapters"" although all the Episodes HAVE them. I will list the number of Chapters on each Episode as I go along. My player's remote has an ""Options"" button that lets you choose a ""Chapter Search"" option, check your player's manual for it's location on yours. So on with the devil in the details...

DISC ONE: THE PILOT & EPISODES 1 & 2
Original Air Dates: Sunday, April 8, Thursday, April 12 and 19, 1990
Each disc has a different theme featuring scenes from the series playing in a loop, on Disc One it's ""Trees/Woods."" You then have a choice of ""Play All,"" ""Pilot,"" Episodes,"" ""Set Up"" and ""Special Features.""
When you choose ""Pilot"" you have 3 options, ""Log Lady Intro,"" ""Play Together"" and ""International Version."" The Log Lady Intros were filmed especially for the show's second run on the Bravo Channel. The ""International Version"" is the Pilot with added material at the end, some that appeared on later episodes and some that did not, that was released outside the U.S. as a stand-alone film. The Pilot has 10 chapters, the International Version has 11. If you just want to watch the material added to the International Version, go to Chapter 8 and then fast-forward to the 1:32:27 mark. From there on is the 21+ minutes of material added to the Pilot so they could release it overseas as a film with an ending.
Episodes 1 & 2 both have 6 chapters. They also have the options ""Play Episode,"" ""Log Lady Intro,"" ""Recap"" and "" ""Play All Together with Episode."" Episode 1 also has a ""Preview"" option...

From DISC TWO to DISC EIGHT every disc's Menu gives you the choice of ""Play All,"" ""Episodes,"" ""Set Up"" and ""Special Features."" If you choose ""Play All"" you're given the choice of ""Episode Only"" and ""With Episodic Extras."" All Episodes have 6 chapters unless noted. If you choose an Episode by itself you have the options ""Play Episode,"" ""Log Lady Intro,"" ""Recap,"" ""Preview"" and "" ""Play All Together with Episode,"" unless noted...

DISC TWO: EPISODES 3-4-5-6-7
Original Air Dates: Thursday, April 26, May 3, 10 & 17, Wednesday, May 23, 1990
The Menu theme is ""Pie""

The ""Special Features"" are an ""Image Gallery,"" ""Twin Peeks Sneak Previews"" and ""Promos.""
The ""Image Gallery"" has three choices of photos, ""Season 1,"" ""Picnic"" and ""Ski Trip"" which is the most interesting since the segment that they represent never aired. You navigate through them with the < and > buttons on your remote.
The ""Twin Peaks Sneak Previews"" (2:51 total) are five ""Tonight On Twin Peaks"" commercials narrated by Kimmy Robertson in character.
The ""Promos"" have a ""Play All"" option and included ""See Twin Peaks From The Beginning,"" scenes from the first season with a voice-over by ""Agent Cooper"" (2:14) and ""Where Am I"" a short (0:35) promo where ""Agent Cooper"" lets viewers know that Episode 7 was going to be on Wednesday instead of Thursday...

DISC THREE: EPISODES 8-9-10
Original Air Dates: Sunday, September 30, Saturday, October 6 & 13, 1990

Episode 8 was the second season opener, and has 9 chapters. It also doesn't have a ""Recap.""
The ""Special Features"" are ""A Slice Of Lynch: Uncut,"" ""Promos"" and ""Season 2 Image Gallery.""
""A Slice Of Lynch"" was originally a half-hour long conversation with David Lynch, Kyle MacLachlan, Mdchen Amick and the series' associate producer John Wentworth that was included in the Gold Box edition. Here it runs 0:55:33. They discuss various aspects about the production and it's genesis.
The ""Promos"" have a ""Play All"" option and include: ""There's No Place Like Home"" (0:35) made to remind viewers that the show had been moved from Saturday to Thursday, featuring MacLachlan, Catherine Coulson, Piper Laurie and Michael J. Anderson, ""T-Shirt Ad"" (0:34) hawks (sorry) the Official Twin Peaks Sheriff's Department T-Shirt, and features Al Strobel & Kimmy Robertson, ""Holiday Greeting"" (0:13) has no actors, ""Patriot Greeting"" (0:39) gives a shout out to the troops in the Gulf War with MacLachlan, Amick and Dana Ashbrook, and ""Big Game Promo"" (2:43), which has multiple takes of MacLachlan and Michael Ontkean in character preparing to watch the Cincinatti Bengals vs. the Seattle Seahawks which must've aired before Monday Night Football on October 1, 1990. The Image Gallery has photos from ""Season 2"" and ""Albert's Slides,"" photos of 'evidence on microscope slides' props...

DISC FOUR: EPISODES 11-12-13-14
Original Air Dates: Saturday, October 20 & 27, November 3 & 10, 1990
The Menu theme is ""Coffee""
The ""Special Features"" are ""Series Deleted Scenes"" (14:07 total) and ""Outtakes"" (2:14).
Their are twelve ""Series Deleted Scenes"" (many ported over from the 'Gold Box Edition') with the option to ""Play All."" All the Special Features material has NOT been remastered. I'm listing the titles as shown but not revealing details, that's for you to discover and enjoy! The deleted scenes are ""Cooper and Donna Talk About Picnic"" (0:25), ""Picnic"" (0:55), ""Cooper and Truman Gazebo"" (0:35), ""Mayor's Speech"" (1:35), ""Lucy and Racoons"" (0:25), ""16MM Period Piece"" (:48), ""Bobby Coaches Shelly"" (1:13), ""Lucy and Deputy Andy"" (1:24), ""Jerry's Wandering Eye"" (0:53*), ""27 Going On 6"" (1:33*), ""Lucy, Andy, and Donuts"" (0:53*) and ""Something About Johnny"" (0:48*). Some of these reveal further background information, especially about Johnny Horne. Those marked (*) were also on the GOLD BOX SET.
The ""Outtakes"" are basically just over two-minutes of Cooper and Truman on stakeout plus them standing in a sort of haze. These really don't add anything at all...

DISC FIVE: EPISODES 15-16-17-18
Original Air Dates: Saturday, November 17, December 1, 8 & 15, 1990
The Menu theme is ""Notes""
The ""Special Features"" are ""Return To Twin Peaks,"" ""Location Guide,"" and ""The Glastonbury Archive.""

The Menu theme is ""Owls""
There are no ""Previews"" on this disc except for ""Lucy's Special Announcement"" on Episode 27. Episodes 28 and 29 were originally broadcast back-to-back. Obviously, the last episode has no ""Recap.""
The ""Special Feature"" is the ""making of"" documentary: ""Secrets from Another Place: Creating Twin Peaks."" You can choose a ""Play All"" option (1:46:13) or choose any of four different sections, ""Northwest Passage: Creating The Pilot"" (30:42), ""Freshly Squeezed: Creating Season One"" (30:46), ""Where We're From: Creating The Music"" (17:54) and ""Into The Night: Creating Season Two.""

DISC NINE: ""TWIN PEAKS: Fire Walk With Me"" and ""The Missing Pieces: Deleted/Alternate Scenes""

The Special Feature is ""Archival Interviews."" The Menu has the usual ""Play All"" and ""Set Up"" options.

The Feature Film ""TWIN PEAKS: Fire Walk With Me"" (2:14:33) has 41 chapters. This HD transfer is beautiful and won't be topped until they invent home 3-D holograms (and I don't know if I'd want Bob in my living room). People who complain about the missing cast members from the TV version have to understand that they weren't necessary to the story until after the murder. The only other thing I can say is, after watching this now for the upteenth time, is that I still find it as valid and compelling as when I first saw it in the theater. Powerful stuff...

""The Missing Pieces: Deleted/Alternate Scenes"" (1:31:25)
Since this extra is long-awaited and the big news about this set I'm going to list the scenes in the following way: Option#/Chapter#/Name Of Scene/Characters In The Scene/Length Of Scene. The scenes marked (*) are the extended scenes. If I have already listed the actor with their character above, I'm only going to use the name of the character. If the character and actor have not been previously listed, I will add the actor's name. Below I list the chapters of the film interspersed with the chapters of the extended/deleted scenes where I feel they would fit (or not)...

35/34 Credits
In comparison to the list on imdb.com, the only major characters with scenes filmed who are not represented are Sylvia Horne
(Jan D'Arcy) and Jerry Horne (David Patrick Kelly). Any further DOCUMENTED input would be welcomed....

The ""Special Feature"" is ""Archival Interviews"" (5:25) with a ""Play All"" option. The interviews are with Ray Wise (0:39), Sheryl Lee (1:56), Moira Kelly (1:00) and Mdchen Amick (1:50). In my opinion they are lousy and add not one wit of new info....

This is probably useless, but here's my try at deciding where the Deleted/Alternate Scenes would go. The problem is, some of the Deleted/Alternate Scenes would have to be edited within some chapters, and some of both may need trims here and there. Not every extra scene is used, some just don't seem to fit anywhere within the narrative. Remember, this is just an amateur guess and not for the faint-hearted, I'm sure someone much more brilliant than I, who has the right equipment, will make a seamless edit of this one day and post it on YouTube. Please let me know if and when this occurs. The Chapter numbers for the film will have an ""F"" prefix, the Deleted/Alternate Scenes Chapters will have a ""M"" prefix. The "">"" symbol will mean ""to be edited within the scene""....

FEATURES COMPARISON:
I never owned the VHS set because I taped the whole shebang and any specials or interviews I could find. I never bought the LaserDiscs because the price point was too high. I had the Artisan First Season set and the CBS Second Season set. Could it really be thirteen years since the release of the Artisan set?! From what I can remember, since I only watched the extras once, all of that set's extras are here except for the director's commentaries and the ""Script Notes: Optional Guide to the 'Unseen Twin Peaks' feature. These were never ported over to the GOLD BOX SET as well. As soon as the GOLD BOX SET was announced I sold the previous sets and purchased it. Again, everything on that set is here but a few exceptions, mainly the postcards, the Saturday Night Live clips when Kyle MacLachlan hosted, and the ""Falling"" music video. I never cared for the SNL material, too broad and stupid, if you really want to watch it, it's on YouTube along with the music video. ""Reflections On The Phenomenon Of Twin Peaks"" was on the New Line ""TWIN PEAKS: Fire Walk With Me"" DVD....

IN SUMMATION (!There ARE Spoilers ahead!):
It should be obvious by now that I'm a TWIN PEAKS fan. My first David Lynch movie was ERASERHEAD. Now there's an off-the-wall film. Next I saw THE ELEPHANT MAN and was impressed how he implemented his style in a mainstream movie. The next was the premier showing (in my area) of BLUE VELVET, which I took a blind date to. Needless to say, it didn't work out so well, but hey, if she didn't like David Lynch...so, anyhow, when TWIN PEAKS was hyped I told my then more hip girlfriend that we had to catch David Lynch's vision of prime-time TV! We became instant fans and advocates, I even had a letter printed in TV Guide defending it from critics! So what went wrong? Well, as many point out, ABC didn't know what to do with it. The First Season did great because the Sunday pilot had everyone talking about it the next day at work, which was quickly followed by the initial seven regular episodes, all on consecutive Thursdays. It was the Second Season when they really screwed it up. Although it premiered again on a Sunday, they buried the next sixteen episodes in the Saturday TV graveyard. Even worse, it had three hiatuses, for one week, then three, then two. It ran another three consecutive weeks, and then disappeared for another FIVE weeks. During that time, ABC was going to just cancel it and not show the last six contracted episodes, but enough fans made them change their minds. It resurfaced on a Thursday, where it played for four consecutive weeks, then disappeared again for seven weeks and four days, when they finally showed the two remaining episodes back-to-back on Monday, June 10, 1991. Whew! even Rodney Dangerfield got more respect. The other deciding factor in it's demise has to ride on the shoulders of producers David Lynch and Mark Frost. They just lost interest until the end, when cancellation loomed they made an attempt at a Hail! Mary pass, but it was too late. The Second Season came out strong at the gate, but after they solved the mystery, resulting in the end of actor Ray Wise's tenure, the show began floundering. In my opinion, Ray Wise's emotional performance as Leland Palmer was a tour-de-force. His ability to play a good man, a loving man, haunted and tortured by demons from the dark side, changing personalities in a nanosecond, was unparalleled. The fact that he was never even nominated for an Emmy is a sin. The direction the show went was also a sin. TWIN PEAKS' blend of mystery, drama and comedy was laced with just the perfect amount of the supernatural and science-fiction, where it went wrong was adding fantasy. The plot line of Nadine's super-strength was just plain dumb, an amnesia plot maybe, but the former was just plain ridiculous. With all the SUPER original cast, did the have to bring in Ian Buchanan and David L. Lander's comic relief? Was I the only one who thought the whole James and Evelyn arc stunk to high heaven? Windom Earle wasn't a bad idea, but instead of it being foreboding they had him play dress-up so many times it was unbelievable. Don't you think that after finding out the first time that he was in the area that there would be posters, and news reports, and searches, and at least some heightened vigilance? There was so much they could've done with the characters everyone knew and loved and tuned in to see. Did Audrey have to have an affair with the quickly in-and-out (literally) John Justice Wheeler? She and Bobby were working together, couldn't they get together? They'd been showing Donna trying to act as tough and jaded as Laura, why didn't they develop that? A main character going into a downward spiral, then possibly targeted by another BOB possessed character, say Dr. Jacoby would've been better than her pining for James. And why not build up Jerry Horne? or Hawk? or have Mike and Nadine have a serious affair? Why not bring back Ray Wise as his brother? Well, by now I'm sure you get my drift. The show began to pull together at the end, but again, it was too little too late. At least we eventually got the prequel, FIRE WALK WITH ME. The bottom line is this, even after watching it so many times over so many years, when I started to watch this set I couldn't wait for the next episode. TWIN PEAKS holds up as a phenomena that earned it's title, and will surely be watched, and discussed for generations to come, or the next cup 'o' joe and slice of cherry pie is on me......",1407283200,106,33051,5.162030987493

6142223,1,B00H9BFV98,"I would be quick to give this set a 4 or 5 star review - the picture quality is beautiful, the extras are nice, and the packaging is superb. I jumped to pre-order this as soon as it was available.

Unfortunately, I am among the many people who are experiencing serious audio syncing problems. The ""Missing Pieces"" are wayyy out of whack, and many people are also reporting audio issues with some episodes and with Fire Walk With Me. People with all sorts of BluRay players are reporting major problems in these areas. For an item that is so expensive and is priced so because of its top-quality sound and images, this is completely unacceptable.

Many of us are trying to reach out to CBS Home Entertainment through social media, but we've yet to hear about an exchange where we'll be given working disks. I would imagine we will hear something about this, but if not, I'll be returning this for a full refund. That would be a bummer considering how much I was looking forward to owning this, but to pay so much for such a flawed product would be insane.",1407110400,160,1054,4.484375

So far disc 9 seems to be the one most are complaining about. Yep, it happens during the deleted scenes to FWWM. My OPPO BDP-103 has the latest firmware.

As for the content itself? Brilliant on just about every level. This is the one fans have been waiting for. There are Easter Eggs on this set so don't forget those. Picture quality of the episodes themselves are even better than the iTunes 1080 versions (of course)

Just be prepared for potential technical issues.",1407024000,4,595,4.823529411764706
6142226,5,B00H9BFV98,"I was a huge fan of this creation from the moment I saw the pilot when it originally aired in 1990.  I was such a fan of the show that when the film ""Fire walk With Me"" was released I saw it twice and bought the poster and had it framed!  It was sad to me that the film was so discredited by fans!. ""Fire Walk with Me"" It was different from the show but it had to be.  Where the show dealt with the mystery of ""Laura's Murder"" the film deals with the events that led to it.  The show dealt with the underbelly of suburban life.  The film showed us that all is not perfect in the world of Laura. Her world was a terrible place,

For years I wanted to see those deleted scenes and after 22 years hear they are.  (FYI  I also  waited 25 years for those Marlon Brando scenes in Superman II)  Now you may ask  ""Do these scenes add anything to the story""?  well ""No , but they are great to watch on their own"".

If has been a long time since you have seen ""Fire walk With Me"" a suggest a refresher! You really do need to know that film to really enjoy the deleted footage!  When you do that you can see why scenes were deleted.  Had they of been kept the film would of been almost 4 hours long.  Also even now if all of these scenes were added back in, the film would believe it or not be too long too sit through.

In general the deleted scenes work great as a stand alone feature.

Now what I think would of been great if David Lynch gave us an audio commentary on everything he directed in ""Twin Peaks"".  From the pilot to the film but he doesn't do them.  If you watch the set  the interviews from cast members say ""David doesn't Analyze  things too much"".  To me David Lynch he doesn't need to analyze. What I like in audio commentary's is when any director talks about

""This scene took us all day to do because""
"" I wanted to cut this but it was needed""
""This was re-shot months after we completed principle photography""
""This scene was meant to come earlier""
 ""My editor & I worked on this scene and had many versions of it""
""This scene was important to the actors""
""So & So Improvised here and it worked""

In the first ever DVD release there were audio commentary's for many episodes from the first season.  They  however did not make it over to this release or even the  DVD GOLD BOX EDITION.  Maybe David Lynch refused to have them included.  In fact in the original  (Artisan release) the commentary's they are not even mentioned on the packaging. They are almost a hidden bonus feature""

I also would of loved a little booklet saying what is on each blu-ray.

If your a general fan you will like this.  If your a true fan this will be your favorite blu-ray set of all time!

JUST AN FYI the deleted scenes alone are worth the price of this release.",1407024000,18,2755,4.132075471698113
6142227,4,B00H9BFV98,"I have only watched a small portion of the disks so far, but I am posting this early review to alert others of an audio synch issue that I have experienced and many others are also reporting.  The issue is very noticeable in portions of the Fire Walk With Me deleted and expanded scenes.  The scenes are still watchable, but it is pretty annoying.  I have also watched the FWWM movie itself and I never noticed any problem there and the video transfer is fantastic.

Other then the audio issues, the show and the extra content make this set well worth picking up.  The set is obviously a labor of love and is very much appreciated. If you are a big fan of the show as I am, it is even worth double dipping on.  I do miss the audio commentaries I remember an earlier DVD set having, but the superior picture quality and the new extras easily makes up for it.  5 stars if CBS addresses the audio problems.",1407024000,7,903,4.276470588235294

6142230,5,B00H9BFV98,"I've been a big fan of Twin Peaks for years and have held out on the Gold Box DVD set, long awaiting a Blu-ray release (I still cling to my old Artisan/CBS DVD releases), so I was beyond excited for this. It's really a fan's dream come true all the additional footage that fans have been waiting years for, a good deal of extras, and killer picture quality (they even restored the Log Lady intros!). The amount of painstaking restoration and work that went into this release is admirable, and it really is the most complete and definitive release of the Twin Peaks saga to date.

My only gripe? The PACKAGING. While it's an aesthetically beautiful set, it is not that practical, nor is it very sturdy. The packaging consists of an inner book made up of sleek cardboard that holds all the discs, which is itself housed in a hard flip top box. You flip through the book, which has some lovely artwork accompanying the disc slots, and at the bottom, there's a neat little bonus slip of paper with a cryptic message. The only problem? The inner book that is housed in the box is supposed to be adhered to the bottom of the box itself, but mine was detached fresh out of the packaging! In fact, it was so loose that the slip of paper that is supposed to be hidden in a kind of trap door at the bottom was sticking out at the top of the box when I opened it. So much for the element of surprise!

I assume the issue with the glue coming undone occurred during the shipment process, perhaps due to heat or something, but that's not really an excuse. There should have been a little bit more thought put into the housing of the discs, as the weight of the interior book itself is far too heavy to be held down to the bottom of the box with just a couple strips of glue. I have no doubt that the glue would have come undone over a brief amount of time had it not already been unglued when I opened it. The box should have been designed a bit more carefully the book should have been a part of the box itself rather than a glued-in component.

Another issue I encountered with the packaging has to do with the thin vellum-type sheets of paper inside that work as kind of chapter markers for each section (Season 1, 2, and Fire Walk with Me) these are also surprisingly fragile. I noticed the sheet marking ""Fire Walk with Me"" is almost completely detached from the binding, and I've only looked through the book two or three times if I were to even pull on it slightly, it'd completely tear off like a sheet of perforated notebook paper. The exterior box itself is great though; it's made of a thick, sturdy, almost wooden-like material that looks and feels durable and lovely. That's a definite plus.

Despite the major design flaws, I still cannot bring myself to rate this set anything other than 5 stars, because it's truly a dream come true, at least content wise, but I will say that the packaging is a big letdown. It's stylish and aesthetically pleasing, but it's a bit impractical, at least in regard to the binding of the interior book portion. If it can't withstand making it to store shelves and into the hands of the buyer, then the design really should be reevaluated!

Much love regardless. I'm just happy this set exists. Some people may be a bit less forgiving about the packaging issues though, so do keep this in mind. Hopefully Paramount/CBS will address the design flaw, but it's doubtful.",1406937600,6,3400,4.424920127795527
6142231,5,B00H9BFV98,"What can I say that hasn't already been said about this definitive ""Twin Peaks"" collection? I've only watched the original Pilot with the Log Lady intro and just going off of that I'm already blown away. The HD transfer looks amazing, you couldn't ask for better. In fact, as the opening titles played on the Pilot, I felt a thrill throughout my body, my eyes got some dust in them, and I was overwhelmed with joy at how beautiful everything looked. The sound is amazing.

There are many more reviews on here that go right into the specifics of the HD quality, so read those if you're looking for that. If you're a fan not interested in the specificity on the technical end, this may be the review for you. (But my God does it looks gorgeous). ALL of ""Twin Peaks"" is on this set. The entire series, remastered, along with remastered Log Lady intros. 90 minutes of deleted scenes from FWWM, a new restoration of FWWM (which I can't wait to see, it being my 4th favorite film of all time).

Let me put it to you like this. I never once owned a Blu-Ray until this was announced. I pre-ordered it, and on the very same day I went out and bought a Blu-Ray player. This was over two months ago. I just got this in the mail a day ago and I'm amazed with it.

I was eagerly awaiting the FWWM deleted scenes - what a dissappointment! Over hyped for a decade. I should have known better.

6142237,4,B00H9BFV98,"This is my fourth time around with Twin Peaks on home video. In 1991, while living in Tokyo, I bought the full series on laserdisc (even though the box set set me back the equivalent of 500 bucks). When the first- and second-season sets came out here on DVD, I got those. When the ""Definitive Gold Box Edition"", I replaced the earlier sets. Now, I have replaced that last box with this new blu-ray edition.

Since most folks looking at this are going to be familiar with the show, I'm going to focus on the extras.

The extras are by and large very good. I especially like being able to see all the various promo spots; since I was not in the US when the show originally aired, I missed all of that stuff (even though I had friends who sent me videos of most of the episodes).

Some of the segments come from the earlier sets (they still bear the Artisan Entertainment logo), and haven't been upgraded. The segment consisting of interviews done in 2000 inexplicably has sped up footage of everyone but Sheryl Lee (who is shown at regular speed) while Sheryl Lee is talking. Very odd--but not an a ""Lynchian"" sense.

The ""interactive grid"" of more recent interviews stands out as an example of overkill--not to mention that that menu's main navigation operates differently from the rest of the menus. I'm not sure there's a real advantage to being able to mix and match the various segments and actors; it probably would have been better to simplify the choices to actors and segments, as I suspect most folks will either watch each actor's interview in its entirety, or each segment in its entirety.

The ""atmospherics"" mostly appear to be the loops from the menus in the set. With snippets of dialogue included, however, I'm not sure how ""atmospheric"" some of them are.

The interview segments hosted by David Lynch are pretty interesting, for the most part. I actually don't remember ""A Slice of Lynch"" from the last DVD set, but it is presented here uncut. I enjoyed it most for the obvious affection Lynch, ""Madgkin"", and ""Kale"" have for one another. As for the newer segment (which appears to have been filmed in the same setting as ""A Slice of Lynch""), the interviews with Ray Wise, Grace Zabriske, and Sheryl Lee in character seemed pretty pointless; at least, they didn't add anything to my understanding of the characters.

Of course, this set's big draw is the deleted scenes from Fire Walk With Me. These are something of a mixed bag. As is often the case with deleted scenes, it's obvious why most of them were cut. For me, there were really only two or three scenes where I though including them would have made sense: Theresa Banks calling Leland Palmer, Annie's nurse taking the ring (which partly duplicates a scene already in the movie), and the scene with Cooper from where the series left off. I liked seeing the extra Bowie scenes, but they wouldn't have made much more sense than what was included in the film without a lot more context. In the end, as entertaining as some of the deleted scenes were (especially Agent Desmond's fistfight with Sheriff Cable), none of the deleted footage really adds anything to my understanding of the characters. Now, had the set included a version of the movie with the deleted scenes cut in to where they would have originally appeared...

The image quality of the HD segments is excellent; this will be obvious from whichever menu you see first. This bodes well for the episodes themselves, as well as Fire Walk With Me. The rest of the segments vary in quality, depending on where they came from. Segments from the earlier DVD sets have mostly not been upgraded, with the extended/uncut ""A Slice of Lynch"" being the notable exception.

One thing I am curious about is the disclaimer (on the transparent tab attached to the back of the box, in tiny, tiny print on the bottom panel) that ""[s]ome episodes may be edited from their original network versions."" For now, I'm assuming that this refers to the last couple of episodes that were originally aired as a 2-hour special, which mainly affected the on-screen placement of the credits.

Another reviewer lamented the absence of any kind of booklet. I agree. Perhaps CBS wanted to keep production costs down, or maybe Lynch didn't want a bunch of analytical essays to distract viewers, but there was such interest in Twin Peaks while it was on that even a simple scrapbook of some sort would have been a nice addition to the package.

Personally, I would love to have heard somebody talk about the gratuitous James Hurley subplot. To this day, I have yet to figure out exactly how it ties into any of the other storylines...

Anyway, the set is here at last, and it mostly looks pretty good. If ever you needed an excuse to get a blu-ray player (or drive), this would be it.

Small update, 8-5-2014:

I have noticed a couple of things while watching the first few discs.

First, if you watch the episodes ""with episodic extras"" (i.e., the Log Lady intros, ""Previously on Twin Peaks"", and ""Next on Twin Peaks...""), be prepared to make frequent volume adjustments, as the ""episodic extras"" tend to have slightly louder average volume levels than the episodes themselves.

Second, if you use the subtitles at all, you'll probably notice that the ""chance out between two worlds"" mistake remains in the scene where Cooper and the One-Armed Man start reciting the verse together. There are also a couple of spelling errors here and there (I noticed one incidence of ""principle"" where it should have been ""principal""). On the other hand, the Japanese subtitles appear to have been approved. For example, on the 1991 Japanese laserdisc, after Cooper finds Audrey in his hotel room, when he says he's going to go get them a couple of malts, ""malts"" is translated as ""beers"" (""Malt's"" was the name of a beer sold by Suntory at the time); on the blu-ray, this has been corrected to ""snacks"". (I also noticed that ""Tajimura"" is misspelled as ""Tojimura"", but soon realized that this is how it  was rendered in the credits.)

Third: As much as I hate the practice, I found that there are easter eggs on the first disc, accessible from the main menu.

As long as I'm updating this, I see that some folks are reporting audio sync problems. Except perhaps for a few seconds in one episode being ever-so-slightly off (which may or may not have always been the case), I haven't noticed any problems in that area with my copy.",1406678400,10,6426,4.6648983200707335

6142240,5,B00H9BFV98,"I am thrilled to have this set!  I remember watching Twin Peaks when it originally aired and feeling cheated when the third season was cancelled.  It had a quirky yet dark quality that drew me in instantly, and even thought it seemed to lose its way during the second season, there was always something in each episode that resonated with me and kept me coming back for more. The music was achingly beautiful, the characters unique, and the story line intriguing. I fell in love with Cooper and the entire Sheriff's team, not to mention Big Ed and Norma.  I laughed, cried, sighed, and pondered my way happily through the pilot, both seasons,and the FWWM movie.  I am truly giddy over a chance to re-watch it all!

While I do wish it had been offered on DVD (for those fans who do not have a Blue Ray player) and  I am sincerely sympathetic to everyone who already bought the Gold Box Set (thinking the collection was as complete as it ever would be), I am basing my five star review solely on the beauty and content of this set.  Both movies and all the episodes have exquisite picture and sound, and I am thrilled to have 90 minutes of extra FWWM footage.  Plus, each disk has its own mix of special features, including Log Lady Introductions.  My one complaint is that there was no content booklet added.  Below I have copy pasted a detailed list of what is on each disk (this list was originally posted by another reviewer; I do not remember their name). I am reprinting it because it is such a great way to show you what you get with this set.

6142241,4,B00H9BFV98,"""Twin Peaks"" has never looked this great before. Featuring a brand new 4K transfer supervised by David Lynch himself, ""Twin Peaks: The Entire Mystery"" will make it feel like that gum you liked is back in style.

The story (as most fans are aware) focuses on the mysterious and brutal murder of Laura Palmer a popular high school kid. It appears that Laura was murdered by a serial killer and FBI Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle McLaughlan)is called into the odd town of Twin Peaks to solve the murder (where intrigue is around every corner).

The audio has been upgraded for the series as well and we get some new special features including an ""interview"" with the residents most impacted by the murder of Palmer. The only bad part about this set is that the original commentary tracks from the Artisan release are not included (due to licensing issues and Lynch disliking commentary tracks--they were never on the Gold box which preceded this on DVD) and the Saturday Night Live spots featuring McLaughlan (and the coffee ads) are not included (those were on the Gold box DVD).

Update: Please note that  folks are having audio being out of synch for the extras for FWWM. Not sure what CBS is doing to address this issue but, I assume, they will do a replacement disc as they did for Star Trek: The Next Generation for the first season which also had it audio issues.

We do get the new extras as well as the bulk of the original special features (most in HD) along with ""Fire Walk With Me"" (it's U.S. debut in Blu-ray) and scenes that were cut from the film (extensive material). I don't want to spoil it for anyone but there are some really cool features on the last disc of the set that will surprise you.

The packaging is, in theory, cool but the execution is lacking. Disc scratching is an issue for many folks and some packages have already fallen apart for some folks. i personally would have preferred a traditional Blu-ray case. Each disc is contained in a cardboard ""page"" and preceeded by a list of its contents. Buried under a tab after the last page is a message that will resonate with viewers on a torn piece of paper. It's a nice touch.

David Lynch and Mark Frost's ""Twin Peaks"" was influential in its mixture of neo-noir, elements of the procedural thriller and absurdity. While it strayed off course during the second season (there was promise though with the new bad guy Windom Earle), by the conclusion Lynch and Frost had found, for the most part, what made ""Twin Peaks"" so bizarre and special all along. While ""Fire Walk With Me"" isn't quite as good as the series as a whole, it is a remarkably well put together prequel. Viewers can still see the influence of ""Twin Peaks"" shows that followed like ""The X-Files"", ""Veronica Mars"" and the more recent ""Pretty Little Liars"" and it holds together remarkably well over twenty years later.

Image quality: 4.5 stars, audio 3, special features 4.5 stars (it would rate 5 if we could have gotten the commentary tracks from Artisan)for an average of 4.5 stars for the set. I've also docked this a star for the audio synch issue and will update this once CBS fixes the problem.

6142243,5,B00H9BFV98,"There have been so many people treating this section as a message board instead of reviews it's absurd. I have the set and have been watching it, so this is an actual REVIEW.

PACKAGING
The packaging is nicely done and good quality. However I prefer practical packaging and it takes a little effort to flip through and access  the discs. There isn't a booklet listing all of the disc contents, which is a bit frustrating as you have to insert a disc to see which special features it contains. This is nitpicking because it looks very good and there is a neat little surprise after you flip through all of the discs.

HD UPGRADE QUALITY
All episodes of the TV show, including both versions of the pilot, have been meticulously scanned and remastered from the original negatives. People seem to forget that this show was finished in 1990 TV resolution. Thankfully it was shot on film and those film negatives could be used to create HD masters.  It took considerable work and expense to upgrade these episodes to HD quality and DTS sound. While the Gold Box versions looked great, these transfers are much better, with 3 times the sharpness and more accurate and striking color. I am watching on a 100"" screen and seeing textures and details I never noticed on the DVD. There is a much greater depth which pulls you even deeper into the world of Twin Peaks. Twin Peaks was the first show to be shot in a cinematic style, and it pays off big time on blu-ray. The shows are presented in their original 4x3 aspect ratio.

I have noticed some shots in the first few episodes which were clearly not upgraded to HD, probably because they were part of a special effect. For example, when Laura's mom imagines Donna's face turning into Laura. They were brief moments and didn't detract much from the overall amazing presentation. However in the first episode of season two there is a long montage of superimposed shots while Cooper describes the details of Laura's murder. The whole sequence is noticeably not in HD and it stands out. It is quite distracting and a shame because it is such a crucial and visual scene. I can only guess the producers were unable to locate the original negative for those scenes.

The sound is remixed and remastered in DTS-MA and is amazingly full ranged and detailed considering it was originally created for a 24 year old TV show. The music in particular sounds fantastic.

Fire Walk With Me has not been previously available in HD in the US. The new transfer was scanned from the camera negative in 4k resolution and looks great. It has a very organic, natural film look with great depth and color. Sound is also DTS-MA and is excellent. I have a much greater appreciation for the film after watching it again in HD. There are still moments I don't like, but overall it is brilliant.

The extras have all been upgraded to HD where possible and look great. Even the murky old Log Lady introductions (which is how the entire show looked back then) show a big improvement.

I was thrilled to see that the recaps and previews for each episode have been included in HD. There are also some ABC promos. That really takes me back to watching it on ABC so many years ago.

THE MISSING PIECES
This is the biggest selling point of the set and for good reason. When Fire Walk with Me was released in 1992, many fans (myself included) were sorely disappointed when many favorite characters were not seen in the film. This frustration only increased when it was discovered that many of them were in fact filmed, but cut from the movie. Over the years these deleted scenes have become legendary, with entire websites devoted to drafts of scripts and rare photos from these scenes.

In the era of DVD extra features, fans petitioned to get the deleted scenes released. However, there was a tangle of legal rights which prevented this from happening. Complicating matters was the fact that David Lynch refused to include the scenes in their rough, unfinished state. It would take considerable funding to complete them to Lynch's specifications. After years of trying, it was finally announced that negotiations were at a standstill and the scenes would not be released. That is why they have never been included before.

I don't know exactly how it happened, but somehow the parties involved finally came to an agreement and funding was provided to allow Lynch to finally finish the scenes. Fans who have followed this saga for 22 years know how amazingly lucky we are to finally have 90 minutes of this legendary footage in full HD quality and DTS sound.

Lynch presents the Missing Pieces as it's own movie type experience and they play as a series of vaguely connected vignettes.  It doesn't make much sense if you haven't seen FWWM recently, so a fresh viewing first might be a good idea.

And how are the scenes after all of these years? Do they live up to the hype? The answer is a definite YES. There is some amazing stuff here which Twin Peaks fans will love. There are both small character moments and big mind blowing moments. And about 5 minutes which take place AFTER the Season Two finale. You will find out what happens to Annie and get a further glimpse into what might have been with the evil Cooper if there was a season three. It's great stuff and I am still kind of amazed we are finally getting to see it. And in such great quality. I have not encountered audio sync issues as some have reported.

EXTRAS
In addition to the Missing Pieces, there are several new extras created for this set. I haven't watched them all yet, but I did watch Between Two Worlds, which has 2 parts. The first is a haunting and surreal conversation with the Palmer family and David Lynch. This is followed by a more casual conversation with the actors who portrayed them. Very entertaining and very Lynchian.

The Atmospherics are trippy short music videos, each with a Twin Peaks theme and footage from the episodes and movie.

There are several previously unreleased deleted scenes and outtakes from the show on Disc Four.

There are 2 features on the making of FWWM, which I haven't watched yet.

Most of the other extras from the Gold Box are included, some in extended form. They are scattered throughout the discs. There are a few extras included from the Artisan season one set.

As for the extras not on this set, Artisan owns the season one commentaries and didn't license them, so blame Aristan. And the SNL skits and coffee commercials are owned by someone else who also didn't want to license them. I would love to have them all on one set, but that's the way it goes. At least we still have them on the DVD sets.

CONCLUSION
It is hard to emphasize just how much impact Twin Peaks had on television. It had a short run but its influence is felt to this day. Shows from X-Files to Lost and beyond simply would not have existed without Twin Peaks blazing the trail. The show today still seems fresh and innovative, even though it has spawned 24 years of imitators. If any show deserves the deluxe blu-ray treatment, it is Twin Peaks.

So is the set worth the high price tag so many people have been complaining about? Absolutely. The set includes 2 versions of the pilot, 29 hour long episodes and FWWM all newly remastered in HD. Plus you get the 90 minute Missing Pieces newly directed and edited by David Lynch himself in HD, hours of newly produced behind the scenes content and most of the previous extras remastered in HD (some in extended versions).

This is far more content than similarly priced HD single season sets (Star Trek and I Love Lucy come to mind). And Twin Peaks is a cult show with a much smaller audience. So the price is more than fair and completely in line with other releases. They could easily have released Season One, Two and FWWM as separate releases which would have cost far more to purchase individually.

This set is a dream release for Twin Peaks fans. We never thought we would see the deleted scenes from FWWM, much less finished in beautiful HD quality by Lynch himself. After all those years of watching low quality VHS tapes in the 90s, who would have thought we would get the entire show remastered in HD? If price is a concern, I am sure Amazon will drop the price sometime in the near future. But it is well worth every penny they are charging now.",1406592000,673,8310,4.583557951482479
6142244,5,B00H9BFV98,"Just arrived today and all I can say is WOW!

The packaging is among the best I've ever seen and surprising easy to access. It is QUALITY packaging, and definitely conveys this item as collector's grade. The easter egg at the bottom raised the hair on my arms, GREAT addition! The attention to detail is noteworthy, right down to the dream-carpet pattern on each disc.

I've seen a lot of whiners complaining about price, wanting DVDs, etc. To them I say stick with your old DVD sets if you don't want to pay for this, despite it being one of the best packaged media sets I've ever purchased. I too own all the DVD sets, as well as iTunes releases of both seasons (I really wanted to see TP in HD). We should consider ourselves LUCKY that Lynch convinced the studio to even release this, let alone remaster it considering 90% of the TV viewing public has no clue what Twin Peaks is, or how great the show still is. There's over 27 hours of material here, or roughly 14 full length movies. That's less than $10 per movie if one considers the total run time of this set!

Can't wait to watch again, will likely start this weekend to enjoy it without distractions. For those still on the fence, I'd have paid as much as $200 for this set now that I've seen it and held it in my hands.

Users have every right to review unreleased products based on the available blurb and item descriptions. You don't require the item in your possession to offer criticisms on the product concept, fairness of pricing, value for money etc. especially when you've bought or viewed the item previously on several formats and are very familiar with it. You don't need to have worked in a Slaughterhouse to grasp Humanitarianism or to oppose Animal abuse.

Perhaps over 70% of all Amazon reviews are by users without ""Verified Purchase"" status and if that is valid and holds true for older products which are in circulation then it MUST also be feasible for upcoming and unreleased items.
Sometimes I will review such unreleased items with either a low or high rating based on many other factors.

Big business are predatory and would love us all to be as gullible and wallet-happy as possible - to be too blind, sheep-like or greedy to notice we're being fleeced, so they label some of us as ""uncool"" and whiney for pointing out the stupidity and exploitation that's being normalized.

This Box set, like the Gold Box, shamefully excludes the great, unique extras from the Season 1 & 2 DVDs (released in 2002 & 2007). This causes fans to needlessly and wastefully buy every new release just to have the full range of extras from ALL releases. I also understand Artisan could be at fault regarding this.

Just try getting your head around this: one of the very best Julee Cruise songs (THE WORLD SPINS) in the entire Twin Peaks legacy has been repeatedly excluded from every TP Soundtrack to-date! Must licensing and corporate shenanigans outdo the fans every-time? Will these latest extras ever make it to DVD? And will Agent Desmond punch Sheriff Cable?

I'm against unauthorized downloads on moral principal. On the other hand I don't find it fair business tactics to push inflated prices on all the public just because of a tiny handful of pirates. Inflated costs just legitimize and make piracy more widespread. I hate the trend of downloading dodgy stuff but who can blame folks?

I don't consider it respectful or fair to buyers to sell them the same stuff again and again every 10 years with a few technical upgrades and dubious promises that ""this is the ultimate edition!"" (as Lynch claimed about the Gold Box DVDs just 5 years ago!) or ""you will never need another box set!""
Admittedly I both acknowledge, and am wary of, the plain fact that both the DVDs and Blu-rays of this show are now so audio-visually superior to the original aired Twin Peaks episodes as to be almost a new, distinct entity. Clearly there's good and bad in this.

Like many of us I came from a generation who went out and watched Lynch's films on the Grand screen 5+ times during release, then forked out for the VHS, then the Super VHS Widescreen version, then the DVD, then the Collector's/Special Edition DVD. Decades rolled and now the Blu-ray & before long, the UHD disc versions will be the ""must have"". Who'd like to re-purchase this whole series yet again by 2020?

In the name of profiteering and slavishly promoting the latest, hot format (Blu-ray), those who have bought the entire series 3 times before (on VHS, DVD & the ""Gold"" box) are being excluded and denied as non-entities.

Long standing DVD collectors have been completely neglected from having access to the added 90 minutes of Fire Walk With Me extras, Series deleted scenes and the new features.

Just to be clear I own & regularly use several Blu-ray playing devices.
It's a great format and I have no issues against it. I'm not short of funds or stingy, but since I'm not a big fan of Blu-ray I passed on my small collection of around 60 titles about 3 years back and decided to stick with DVD and VHS. I've no regrets on this choice.

I believe Criterion or Masters of Cinema produce excellent restorations of classic Films and release them in one box with Dual Format (1 DVD disc + 1 Blu ray disc) therefore respecting and nurturing both format collectors in one noble gesture. For this I feel they deserve huge credit. Now I agree this approach is not practical with a 10+ disc TV show like Twin Peaks, but I genuinely hope that Lynch sees fit to do the fair thing by releasing this newly restored edition of FIRE WALK WITH ME along with the 90 minute FWWM Extended cut as well as some of these brand-new features/featurettes on a new stand-alone DVD release or a Dual-format Blu-ray/DVD release in 2014 or 2015.
If he doesn't do this or hasn't even considered it then I feel fully justified in my low 3 star rating and in reiterating that, Artist and Genius aside, both Lynch and the Bank are laughing at you.

Personally I don't find the pricing of this too high. However I know of quite a few loyal Film/TV fans out there who have spent much money over the years and may not have the cash or desire to keep renewing their TVs, formats and Film collections.
For their sake, I'm suggesting it would be a ""damn fine"" gesture to provide them
with DVD versions so they can have the latest stuff at affordable costs AND in a format they can use. Lynch or the industry in general should cater to and support both the wealthy and poor among their fans, both the DVD and HD audiences - that would be fairer all around while still generating income.

For those raving about FWWM and the added scenes, please remember that many Lynch fans dropped him after Fire walk with me came out. Tarantino thought it was crap and that Lynch was ""too far up his own a*s"" even though Tarantino loves Lynch. Perhaps Tarantino has changed his mind since.

Even lots of Twin Peaks nuts didn't like FWWM. So let's take a failed film and see which diehards will go out and buy it for a 2nd or 3rd time! To be clear, although FWMM and the ""Missing Pieces"" are presented here as two separate features, if you consider they are both scenes from the same Film and you logically add their running times you get over 4 hours despite the original being a travesty even in its 2hr 15 min version.
Then again, I'm still unsure if FWWM (and parts of Season 2) are worthy to be part of the glorious Twin peaks canon, and I only really viewed it so as not to feel ""lost in those woods"". Now some of us will be doomed to feel likewise about the Missing Pieces even if they turn out to be garbage.

A restored FWWM BD was only just re-released in 2012 minus these 90 minutes of extras. Whether you are a fan of Lynch or TP, or not, I don't think that's reasonable. Whatever your view - whether you're for this release and a FWWM fan or not, you're still being ripped off, and I'm not purely referring to money here either.

This appears to be the same restored print used on the Gold Box presented in 1080p for the first time. Go to the DVDBeaver review and check out the screenshot comparisons of the Goldbox restoration with this ""new"" Blu-ray restoration - identical colour schemes (dissimilar to the unrestored Artisan DVD sets with their over-saturated image and inaccurate orange skin tones and color schemes).
Perhaps paying for exactly the same print twice isn't such a bad thing?

Just to be clear I am actually a Lynch Fan. My favourite works of his are Mulholland Drive, Eraserhead, Inland Empire and Season 1 of Twin Peaks. My top TP characters are: Leland/Ray Wise, Jacques Renault, Ben Horne/Richard Beymer, Hank Jennings and Sheriff Cable. As you can see my preferences are unconventional and a little darker than most.

I rated this 3 stars because despite all the obvious hype over the positive aspects of this new release (some of which I applaud and agree with), we still shouldn't overlook some of the negative and unpleasant elements involved in this latest release. In one sense this 3 star review of mine is also partly a protest against corporate exploitation of the public and the public's blissful indifference to it.

I am certainly not anti-progress, and of course I'm pleased this is getting the HD treatment, but at least give the Fans ALL the back catalog of Extras every time on each new release PLUS the new Extras in formats that EVERYONE can use!

On the other hand, if folks like to burn their hard-earned cash and make the same mistakes over and over, it's their business. You may be thinking ""who gives a damn what you think - who the hell are you"", and I guess you're right.

Even if we all aim to be spiritual and happy people and practice positive-thinking, there are still times where critical thinking is needed and, dare I say it, a touch of ""rage"" against the machine!
I may be a nobody in this dog-eat-dog world, but I try to speak out for truth & justice, not that anyone really cares ... PEACE!",1405987200,14,8703,4.586872586872587

The set continues with a divider that separates it from the second, and the second from the movie. At the bottom of the set includes a cool little easter egg/collectible that I won't spoil. It looks fantastic on screen and, in my opinion, better than the i-tunes restoration. Some people have said that the quality looks too clear and rids of the blurrish filter of the original nostalgic version, but this is the blu ray version for a reason. It makes things more noticeable and, like the many TV's that continue to evolve, makes the view closer to what we would see if our eyes were able to see what we're viewing in real life.

A show that ran for 2 seasons until it was cancelled, it has maintained a legendary status among viewers of that era as well contemporary ones, making this release the most highly anticipated event in recent years. Whereas previous VHS/DVD releases offered the episodes which aired back in 1990-1992, along with extra features and various commentary, this new blu-ray box set is the most comprehensive yet, featuring all 29 full episodes, 2 versions of the pilot episode, and most of the extras from previous releases.

More importantly, it includes the feature film which served as both a prequel and an epilogue to the series, ""Fire walk with me"", plus 90 minutes of deleted or never-seen-before scenes, all fully scanned and remastered from the original negatives. The diligence exhibited in pretty much all aspects of the box is impressive. It surely helped the fact that the show was shot on film, and so these films were used in order to create HD masters. Still, it must have taken incredible effort and expense in order to upgrade the material to HD quality and DTS sound. The sharpness is striking, and the amount of details that can be noticed is tremendous, even on the deleted scenes which are fully finished with flawless picture and crystal sound. This greater depth is impressive, almost giving the feeling of watching the show anew.

On initial copies of the box set, on some occasions the sound appeared to be slightly out of sync (most notably on some deleted scenes), which was admittedly distracting. Although at first it was not clear whether this was a matter of a faulty batch, buyers of the set complained heavily, and so a new pressing put this issue to rest. This niggle stopped many from giving this a full-star rating, along with the absence of extras from the first 2 seasons previously available on DVD (apparently, Artisan Entertainment did not want to license them for this new box set). The packaging is impressive but, although the set is magnificent to look at, placing the discs in horrible cardboard slip-in cases is a letdown - they may be practical and easy to access, but for a box set as highly anticipated as this, come as a disappointment.

On the plus side, there are some surprises inside the box, which I am not going to spoil, just a quick mention! Finally, no booklet listing the features is included. One has to actually play the discs in order to read their contents; frustrating. Except for these couple of missteps, it is still a special occasion indeed for anyone to feast. Not often do we have the opportunity of enjoying 27 hours of a favourite show, trailers, numerous interviews and discussions, insightful commentary, making-ofs, image galleries, all nicely packaged in an elegant box. A truly exemplary effort, and a must-have for any devotee, TWIN PEAKS: The entire mystery and the missing pieces is the definitive TP collection of one of the most innovative, engrossing and groundbreaking series in the history of international television.

6142257,5,B00H9BFV98,"I find it odd that there are over 20 reviews, now including mine, of a product that isn't even released - that is, the Blu-Ray edition. This review is technically just a review of the Twin Peaks pilot (both versions), the series, and the prequel - Fire Walk With Me.

From the very first episode I was hooked like thousands of other viewers. Captivated by the incredible beauty of show that for it's time was a game changer for prime time television drama. Each week was a countdown to see more and discover ""Who killed Laura Palmer.""

Be advised that one version of the pilot gives away the killer! If you want to stay in suspense, don't watch that version until after watching the entire series.

Sadly, the network screwed the show by shifting nights and time slots that confused the public. Recall that in that era there was no Tivo - but some folks were able to record on VHS for viewing and re-viewing.

The second season of the show degraded slightly into extreme oddness, but was still watchable. As a piece of TV history, this is a good example of HIGH QUALITY. It was released first on VHS around 1996 - but only as the first season! It seems two different entities owned the separate seasons and wouldn't come together for a boxed set.

""Fire Walk With Me"" was released as a theatrical movie which really only appealed to the most serious of Twin Peaks fans. Offputting about FWWM was that some major characters of the series were played by different actors.

When Twin Peaks became available on DVD there was finally a full set available called the Gold Box Edition. It seemed rather comprehensive and comparable to what is offered here in Blu-Ray. I can only guess that the Blu-Ray will be a higher definition.

The cinematography, sets, direction, music, and amazing cast of actors - young and older - make this worth watching. The characters are very well developed. Nothing superficial about this story.

Is it worth over $100? That would be an individual choice, and as much as I loved the show, it's too much for my taste.

Nevertheless, if you enjoy a mystery/suspense/thriller that IS NOT solved in 45 minutes, then Twin Peaks will appeal to you and you should find a format for viewing that fits your budget and quality desires.",1403568000,6,2249,4.630653266331659
6142258,2,B00H9BFV98,"My title says it all really. Interesting (occut driven) show but far too old to expect discerning buyers to fork out this exorbitant price; no matter how clear the picture might be. Now if they released Homicde: Life on the Street, (122 episodes) or Northern Exposure, (111 episodes) on Blu Ray, then a price like this would be warranted. But a show with only 29 Episodes??? Pul-ease!
If one compares the price of this show with the complete series of Farscape, for instance, although both are Blu ray releases, and Farscape boasts 88 episodes, Farscape cost only $66 AUD, compared to the $100 plus expected from Twin Peaks.
And although I know that once again many will hit the unhelpful button, the question is: is this review truthful or not? Should a fan base be hit for over $100 for a show decades old, with only 29 episodes? Does that seem like a fair price in today's market?
Really?
Truthfully?
I think I have come to the conclusion, like a lot of people who are afraid to admit to not understanding abstract paintings in case they come across to others as lacking intelligence or sophistication or whatnot as they sip their flutes with an upturned pinkie, many, many people make much ado about not much of anything, when it comes to David Lynch and Twin Peaks.
I vaguely recall it when it first aired on television back in the days of Duran Duran, padded shoulders, big gelled hair, and dinner jackets with rolled up sleeves, and like most, I thought it was a bit weird, especially compared to what was considered `normal' in the 80s. But me thinks the words `classic' or `the ultimate cult TV"" are somewhat overused when it comes to this show.
Interesting?
Yeah; to a point.
Different?
Slightly.
Art?
That may be pushing it a tad.
It seemed to me then, and now, like pretty much what one should expect from someone under the influence of illegal medications or Transcendental Medication, oops, sorry, I meant Meditation, (which all in all pretty much amounts to the same thing really if you meditate upon it long enough after a few cones).
The murder story in the first season was okay; the second season lost its way, (which is quite a difficult thing to do given the drugs obviously used to create it in the first place already requiring that the viewer drop some bread crumbs to follow the topsy-turvy narrative to simply keep up), and it pretty much died a slow, painful, half death up until the last episode, which was quite good, freaky and strange, but good.
It is an oddity when it comes to American TV, it has some very good, trippy music, some cheesy acting along with some quite good acting, the dialogue ranges from interesting to down right dull and unconvincing, and the overall story, minus the many filler episodes, is not too bad.
But brilliant?
A Classic?
Something that leaves everything else then or since in its shadow?
Once again, I think many people are embarrassed to stand before an abstract painting and simply admit that they either don't understand what the artist is saying, or that it is really nothing more nor less than what is produced when someone shoves a paintbrush between his butt-cheeks and swings naked upside-down past a canvas wearing a blindfold in the dark.
It's television, people!
And if just one more unoriginal reviewer quotes another line about `damn fine coffee' and `cherry pie', I think I will vomit so much damn fine coffee and cherry pie I will perhaps produce a classic work of nonrepresentational art on a level with Jackson Pollock mid way through a drunken binge.

Users have every right to review unreleased products based on the available blurb and item descriptions. You don't require the item in your possession to offer criticisms on the product concept, fairness of pricing, value for money etc. especially when you've bought or viewed the item previously on several formats and are very familiar with it. You don't need to have worked in a Slaughterhouse to grasp Humanitarianism or to oppose Animal abuse.

Perhaps over 70% of all Amazon reviews are by users without ""Verified Purchase"" status and if that is valid and holds true for older products which are in circulation then it MUST also be feasible for upcoming and unreleased items.
Sometimes I will review such unreleased items with either a low or high rating based on many other factors.

Big business are predatory and would love us all to be as gullible and wallet-happy as possible - to be too blind, sheep-like or greedy to notice we're being fleeced, so they label some of us as ""uncool"" and whiney for pointing out the stupidity and exploitation that's being normalized.

This Box set, like the Gold Box, shamefully excludes the great, unique extras from the Season 1 & 2 DVDs (released in 2002 & 2007). This causes fans to needlessly and wastefully buy every new release just to have the full range of extras from ALL releases. I also understand Artisan could be at fault regarding this.

Just try getting your head around this: one of the very best Julee Cruise songs (THE WORLD SPINS) in the entire Twin Peaks legacy has been repeatedly excluded from every TP Soundtrack to-date! Must licensing and corporate shenanigans outdo the fans every-time? Will these latest extras ever make it to DVD? And will Agent Desmond punch Sheriff Cable?

I'm against unauthorized downloads on moral principal. On the other hand I don't find it fair business tactics to push inflated prices on all the public just because of a tiny handful of pirates. Inflated costs just legitimize and make piracy more widespread. I hate the trend of downloading dodgy stuff but who can blame folks?

I don't consider it respectful or fair to buyers to sell them the same stuff again and again every 10 years with a few technical upgrades and dubious promises that ""this is the ultimate edition!"" (as Lynch claimed about the Gold Box DVDs just 5 years ago!) or ""you will never need another box set!""
Admittedly I both acknowledge, and am wary of, the plain fact that both the DVDs and Blu-rays of this show are now so audio-visually superior to the original aired Twin Peaks episodes as to be almost a new, distinct entity. Clearly there's good and bad in this.

Like many of us I came from a generation who went out and watched Lynch's films on the Grand screen 5+ times during release, then forked out for the VHS, then the Super VHS Widescreen version, then the DVD, then the Collector's/Special Edition DVD. Decades rolled and now the Blu-ray & before long, the UHD disc versions will be the ""must have"". Who'd like to re-purchase this whole series yet again by 2020?

In the name of profiteering and slavishly promoting the latest, hot format (Blu-ray), those who have bought the entire series 3 times before (on VHS, DVD & the ""Gold"" box) are being excluded and denied as non-entities.

Long standing DVD collectors have been completely neglected from having access to the added 90 minutes of Fire Walk With Me extras, Series deleted scenes and the new features.

Just to be clear I own & regularly use several Blu-ray playing devices.
It's a great format and I have no issues against it. I'm not short of funds or stingy, but since I'm not a big fan of Blu-ray I passed on my small collection of around 60 titles about 3 years back and decided to stick with DVD and VHS. I've no regrets on this choice.

I believe Criterion or Masters of Cinema produce excellent restorations of classic Films and release them in one box with Dual Format (1 DVD disc + 1 Blu ray disc) therefore respecting and nurturing both format collectors in one noble gesture. For this I feel they deserve huge credit. Now I agree this approach is not practical with a 10+ disc TV show like Twin Peaks, but I genuinely hope that Lynch sees fit to do the fair thing by releasing this newly restored edition of FIRE WALK WITH ME along with the 90 minute FWWM Extended cut as well as some of these brand-new features/featurettes on a new stand-alone DVD release or a Dual-format Blu-ray/DVD release in 2014 or 2015.
If he doesn't do this or hasn't even considered it then I feel fully justified in my low 3 star rating and in reiterating that, Artist and Genius aside, both Lynch and the Bank are laughing at you.

Personally I don't find the pricing of this too high. However I know of quite a few loyal Film/TV fans out there who have spent much money over the years and may not have the cash or desire to keep renewing their TVs, formats and Film collections.
For their sake, I'm suggesting it would be a ""damn fine"" gesture to provide them
with DVD versions so they can have the latest stuff at affordable costs AND in a format they can use. Lynch or the industry in general should cater to and support both the wealthy and poor among their fans, both the DVD and HD audiences - that would be fairer all around while still generating income.

For those raving about FWWM and the added scenes, please remember that many Lynch fans dropped him after Fire walk with me came out. Tarantino thought it was crap and that Lynch was ""too far up his own a*s"" even though Tarantino loves Lynch. Perhaps Tarantino has changed his mind since.

Even lots of Twin Peaks nuts didn't like FWWM. So let's take a failed film and see which diehards will go out and buy it for a 2nd or 3rd time! To be clear, although FWMM and the ""Missing Pieces"" are presented here as two separate features, if you consider they are both scenes from the same Film and you logically add their running times you get over 4 hours despite the original being a travesty even in its 2hr 15 min version.
Then again, I'm still unsure if FWWM (and parts of Season 2) are worthy to be part of the glorious Twin peaks canon, and I only really viewed it so as not to feel ""lost in those woods"". Now some of us will be doomed to feel likewise about the Missing Pieces even if they turn out to be garbage.

A restored FWWM BD was only just re-released in 2012 minus these 90 minutes of extras. Whether you are a fan of Lynch or TP, or not, I don't think that's reasonable. Whatever your view - whether you're for this release and a FWWM fan or not, you're still being ripped off, and I'm not purely referring to money here either.

This appears to be the same restored print used on the Gold Box presented in 1080p for the first time. Go to the DVDBeaver review and check out the screenshot comparisons of the Goldbox restoration with this ""new"" Blu-ray restoration - identical colour schemes (dissimilar to the unrestored Artisan DVD sets with their over-saturated image and inaccurate orange skin tones and color schemes).
Perhaps paying for exactly the same print twice isn't such a bad thing?

Just to be clear I am actually a Lynch Fan. My favourite works of his are Mulholland Drive, Eraserhead, Inland Empire and Season 1 of Twin Peaks. My top TP characters are: Leland/Ray Wise, Jacques Renault, Ben Horne/Richard Beymer, Hank Jennings and Sheriff Cable. As you can see my preferences are unconventional and a little darker than most.

I rated this 3 stars because despite all the obvious hype over the positive aspects of this new release (some of which I applaud and agree with), we still shouldn't overlook some of the negative and unpleasant elements involved in this latest release. In one sense this 3 star review of mine is also partly a protest against corporate exploitation of the public and the public's blissful indifference to it.

I am certainly not anti-progress, and of course I'm pleased this is getting the HD treatment, but at least give the Fans ALL the back catalog of Extras every time on each new release PLUS the new Extras in formats that EVERYONE can use!

On the other hand, if folks like to burn their hard-earned cash and make the same mistakes over and over, it's their business. You may be thinking ""who gives a damn what you think - who the hell are you"", and I guess you're right.

Even if we all aim to be spiritual and happy people and practice positive-thinking, there are still times where critical thinking is needed and, dare I say it, a touch of ""rage"" against the machine!

I'm interested to see the previously unreleased material, but I can't fathom how the price point for this set was developed.  Even relatively hardcore fans are not likely gonna shell out over $100 for material that has already been released on DVD.

It goes without saying that we'll finally see the missing pieces that have been hinted at for years in from the show's feature length film, Fire Walk With Me.

As for my 1-star review, other series have 30 some episodes and they don't cost $100.00, plus the second season of TP is mostly a hot mess, including the laughably boring storyline with James Hurley and his cougar.

6142269,5,B00H9BFV98,"""Twin Peaks"" was the ultimate cult TV show -- suspenseful, complex, hilariously written and with hidden layers that casual channel-flippers might not catch.

And though it lasted only two seasons, David Lynch and Mark Frost's classic series is a brilliant piece of television, with dozens of intertwined subplots and a mystery death that goes a lot deeper than just murder. ""Twin Peaks: The Entire Mystery"" is probably the most complete collection that will ever exist -- the whole TV show, the pilot, the movie, and huge piles of extras, including some stuff never seen before.

The body of a beautiful young woman, Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee), washes up on shore, ""wrapped in plastic."" It seems everyone in the town of Twin Peaks adored her, so her death is a blow. FBI Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) is assigned to the case -- which seems connected to his past work -- so he settles down at the comfy Twin Peaks hotel and continues investigating.

And Twin Peaks' secrets start surfacing -- love affairs, madness, wackos, corporate devilry, and drugrunning. And clues about Laura are cropping up: a bloody shirt, a drug deal, a secret affair and a heart necklace. People catch glimpses of a one-armed man and a grey-haired killer -- and Cooper has a prophetic dream with both men, as well as a red room, a double of Laura Palmer, and a tiny man who dances to jazz music.

The second season introduces more unrest for the inhabitants of Twin Peaks -- and an injured Cooper (Kyle McLachlan) has a vision that may have something to do with Laura Palmer's death. Midway through the season he finds who it was (or rather, who it SEEMS to be). But that's not the only plotline in the second season -- we also get a psychopathic ex-Fed, parasitic demons, a disastrous beauty pageant, strange caves, and a twin pair of ""Lodges"" that seem to exist outside space and time... which Cooper's murderous ex-partner is searching for.

And the movie ""Fire Walk With Me"" serves as a prequel to the series, showing what happened to Laura Palmer in the final week of her life. In addition to a new documentary on this movie, this is the blu-ray debut of the movie from a new scan of the original negative.

""Twin Peaks"" starts off as a basic murder mystery, but rapidly becomes something a lot stranger and more frightening. It becomes weaker during the second season -- especially when Laura's killer is revealed prematurely -- but it's still strange and darkly humorous right up to the flawed cliffhanger end. In other words, it's David Lynch tempered by the need to have things make sense.

And Lynch and Frost knew how to spin a great TV show -- they took the usual murder mysteries, and loaded it down with eerie symbolism, creepy visions and inscrutable (but important) lines (""Through the darkness of future past, the magician longs to see....""). And there are arcs that stretch through the series, slowly unfolding their secrets like dark roses blooming where no one can see them.

But it's not just strange-weird, but strange-funny too. And the dialogue has that brilliant quirkiness that most series cannot keep going for long (""Fellas, don't drink that coffee! You'd never guess... there was a fish in the percolator""). Considering how likably strange the characters are -- including Cooper -- it's not too surprising that it's crammed with quotables (""Black as midnight on a moonless night...."" ""Pretty black"").

And the characters are VERY odd too. Cooper himself is played with quirky brilliance by McLachlan -- he's a bright, lovable, friendly kind of guy who loves Tibetan mysticism, tape recorders and a ""damn fine cup of coffee."" He becomes even more likable as the series goes on, and we get to see some of his more tragic dimensions.

And Cooper flanked by a number of talented actors playing two basic varieties of characters: the relatively normal ones with a slight quirk, such as abusive truckers, the sheriff, teen lovers, and obnoxious FBI agents who offend the residents of Twin Peaks. And the REALLY strange ones, like the weird Log Lady, the one-armed man, the spacey Lolita, and the eerie spirits that haunt Twin Peaks.

This is the very first time that the entire series and movie have been presented together, showing the whole series from the beginning (?) to the end (?). Even better: extras. It has the feauturettes, documentaries and interviews from before, plus a plethora of new stuff -- mostly it's deleted/alternate scenes for the series AND ""Fire Walk With Me,"" about a TV movie's worth. Plus some really new material like ""Between Two Worlds"" (which has some in-character interviews) and ""Atmospherics"" (atmospheric vignettes).

The entirety of ""Twin Peaks"" is hard to even describe, because the plots were a perfect balance of the surreal and mundane -- and the entire series is a dark cult gem from beginning to imperfect end.",1400803200,24,4857,4.8597339782345825

I'm a new fan of twinpeaks so this will be my first time purchasing the series , but boy am I glad I waited",1400630400,3,258,3.625
6142271,5,B00H9BFV98,"There's no denying it; David Lynch and Mark Frost's TWIN PEAKS is one of the greatest television shows of all time, and set a new standard for serialized mystery-drama on TV, not only because of how vividly they created the world these characters inhabit, nor just how each character has a three-dimensional quality, and not just because it was so ground-breaking. So many shows post-TP are very directly influenced by this show (the most incredibly obvious example of this currently on TV is BATES MOTEL), because if you're going to steal from something, might as well steal from the best. And this Blu-Ray set is coming with tons of extras that weren't even in the initial DVD release (which Peaks Freaks had been waiting for for years, since the only way to see the original unadulterated pilot was if you could find the Warner Bros. VHS copy), along with North America's first taste of the film prequel FIRE WALK WITH ME on Blu with more extras and apparently something close to 3 hours of deleted scenes, if the rumors about the film's production are to be believed.

While all of this is damn good news, it's still just another example of the double-dip that has become so common with DVD to Blu in recent years. Obviously the home video industry is going further faster, but some of these just feel like a slap in the face. ""Oh, you paid $79 for the DVD's a few years ago? Well, that was cool and all, but for a mere extra $10-$20-$30-$40-$50-etc., now you get EVERYTHING that ever wound up on the cutting room floor mastered in even higher definition!""

Of course, the saddest thing about this is that I, like most of you, will be suckered into this purchase eventually (or immediately), because fans of this show tend to be completists.

But even the biggest fans of this show have to admit that this show also does become almost uncomfortable to watch at many points past the resolution of the murder of Laura Palmer. With the dozens of subplots Lynch and Frost are juggling, a few balls hit the ground with a resounding thud (I'm looking at you, James), but once the show hits its final stride, it seems like all that came before was totally worth it once we get to Windom Earle's endgame and The Black Lodge.

FIRE WALK WITH ME is similar to the show in the sense that most of it is quite good, but sometimes there's too much going on. Learning about the town, however, as well as its people and what led to the murders of Teresa Banks and Laura Palmer is worth it. And I would have loved to see more of Chester Desmond and Sam Stanley together.

Yes, I'll get it, but I will wait for a sale price. I can wait.",1400457600,20,2622,4.476987447698745
6142272,5,B00H9BFV98,"Television tends to always be the same - and most of it is highly predictable.  That was NEVER the case with Twin Peaks!  Fascinating and intriguing from right out of the gate!  And then very odd and unexpected the entire journey.  I consider it the
Breaking Bad of it's day.  If you are not familiar with Twin Peaks you owe it to yourself to watch it!

All the other discs were fine, but it's still not doable. Maybe would have been ok if it was just a disc of extras, but I can't really accept this when 3 episodes are now missing. It's a dealbreaker and I am returning it.",1532131200,,371,4.391304347826087

Disc 7 still defective. I already have the gold collection so it doesn't bother me but it does contain the last 4 or so episodes of season 2.

I bought this primarily for the missing pieces of Fire walk with Me but the series looks wonderful compared to the gold collection. The new interviews are nice as well.
