4082027,2,B0037TVOFG,The entire family ranging from 7 months to 64 years old watched this. The four year old totally enjoyed it and cheered the trains on. We were all entertained and enjoyed our time together.,1269993600,,188,4.5588235294117645
4082028,3,B0037TVOFG,"A little disappointed--not the attention grabber that ""Hiro"" was.  Our grandson loves anything Thomas, but this video didn't keep his attention.  Most of the stories are a little bit boring.",1269820800,,190,5.3
4082029,5,B0037TVOFG,"My 5 year old grandson loves everything Thomas. I love them because they are great teaching tools for teaching valuable life lessons. Friendship, honesty, faithfulness, dependability, caring, sharing, and punctuality are taught in these stories and isn't that what we all need to get along better in life. These later edition Thomas DVD's are fully animated and that just makes them all the more appealling to children. Hope they keep up the wonderful work.",1268870400,8,457,5.1891891891891895
4082030,5,B0037TVOFG,"As usual this Thomas DVD was a hit in our house.  The DVD was short but it had four short fun-filled episodes.  I think it is a perfect DVD to get us in the mood for spring time and kite flying!  I also love the lessons that kids can learn from it such as working together and problem solving.  I also love the CG animation so it seems like a regular animated DVD.  Aidan was super excited to see Hiro from Hero of the Rails and that the trains talked, instead of just a narrator.

I received this DVD to review but it is 100% my opinion.",1268006400,3,538,3.9813084112149535
4082031,4,B0037TVOFG,"I got this the day of the launch through my prime account, as I have a two-year-old obsessed with all things Thomas.  My son enjoyed seeing the return of Hiro for two of the episodes, especially the one with Thomas carting a load of bees. The DVD contains four episodes with live action Mr Perkins in-between, similar to ""Splish, Splash, Splosh.""  Seems like with each new season the content gets shorter and shorter.  My son always asks that we fast forward through the live sections between the episodes, and I have to agree that they're tedious, and lack the educational component of past releases.  The extra content is short and pointless.  While Thomas has lost a little of the ""cheekiness"" that made the show stand out in the original episodes, it's still one of the better options on the market for parents looking to keep their children away from the ADD-inducing fare most commonly offered.",1267660800,6,900,4.780645161290322
4082032,5,B0037TVOFG,"Ordered this pre-release through Amazon. Release date was Tues Mar 2 and I got it delivered free on Mar 2 with my Prime membership. This Thomas is CGI animated and features Mr. Perkins in the middle of each episode, like Splish Splash Splosh. The first episode features Charlie and all of the other Sodor engines, while the next episode and those following have Hiro in them (he has returned for the summer from his homeland).

When we got the package I told my 2 yr old that he got mail and he was so excited to open it up even though he had no idea what was inside. He was soooo happy to see a new Thomas movie that he made me take it to the sitters that day. I love Amazon!!!!",1267660800,,679,4.143939393939394

8390758,5,B0037TVOFG,Very nice,1437264000,,9,4.0
8390759,5,B0037TVOFG,My great grandson watches one of Thomas' movies every day and Runaway Kite is one of them.  It is nice to see him and Great Grandpa laugh and watch along as the kite flies from one place to another and Thomas runs out of fuel and Percy comes to help.,1430956800,,250,4.0
8390760,5,B0037TVOFG,I Like It,1425513600,,9,2.3333333333333335
8390761,5,B0037TVOFG,My grandson is a Thomas the train fanatic.  Of all his Thomas movies he likes this one the most so far.,1378080000,,103,3.9047619047619047
8390762,3,B0037TVOFG,"My three-year-old and I both prefer the fully animated trains (rather than the creepy moving eyes only), and we both dislike the live action Mr. Perkins. This dvd has the first, but it also has Mr. Perkins. I'm having a hard time meeting both criteria.",1371600000,,252,4.622222222222222
8390763,5,B0037TVOFG,Our 2 year old loves this movie set. Good quality and consistent play. Fun Thomas video that he asks for often. The character Perkins is funny and makes the video.,1368835200,,163,4.466666666666667
8390764,5,B0037TVOFG,Grandson enjoys watching and playing with Thomas the train toys.  This is of good quality and fits in well with other Thomas the Train items.,1362700800,,141,4.64
8390765,3,B0037TVOFG,"This is a typical ""marking-time"" Thomas DVD.

The title story is about a kite that gets away from Sir Topham Hatt's grandkids and Thomas chases it a little too far.  The episode could have ended earlier than it did.  Watching the kite go on...and on...and on...got a bit old.  But, my 2.5-year old son liked it, so that's all that mattered.  (I did wonder why the drivers didn't just get out of the trains and grab the darned thing!)

Hiro makes an appearance in 2 episodes.  He comes back to Sodor to help out during the summer.  My son really likes Hiro.  When he saw Hiro at the docks, he yelled, ""HIRO!!!!""  Ohhhkay.  I guess so!

Toby's 3-chime steam whistle...3-chime steam whistle...3-chime steam whistle...3-chime steam whistle.  Getting on your nerves, yet?  What until you hear it mentioned in the episode about 200 times.  You'll be reaching for the MUTE button!

Lastly, Mr Perkins.  He is a bit more lively than in Splish, Splash, Splosh!  Someone must have told him to smile.  Maybe there's hope for him yet.

On the whole, it fills a good 45-minutes.  That's quiet time when it counts.",1273363200,2,1100,4.654450261780105
