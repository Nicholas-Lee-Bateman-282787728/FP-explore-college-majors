2383773,5,B000AABL12,"This story is historically accurate - no punches pulled.  It's not a ""Hollywood"" fairy tale entertainment as the 1957 movie turned out to be - this is real and worth adding to your library. Not only is it a great historical epic, but it also pays tribute to the hundreds/thousands of men who died building not one, but two bridges over the River Kwai.  I'd recommend this to anyone interested in history of WWII in the Pacific Theater.",1172016000,43,435,4.564102564102564

8077146,5,B000AABL12,"The Bridge on the River Kwai is a favorite movie of mine which inspired me to go visit the actual bridge in Thailand, just 2 hours out of Bangkok.  What a shock to see the real bridge and find out the true story when I was there.  When I found this Documentary on the bridge I had to have it.  The only thing true about the Hollywood movie is that prisoners of war HELPED build the death railway and the bridge and that's all.  It wasn't even on the river Kwai!  I love knowing the true story and having walked on the bridge and taken a train on the death railway, it really came alive for me.  If you are a history buff, this is a must have.  I still love the movie for its entertainment value, but it's not factually correct in any way.",1358985600,3,738,4.048275862068966
8077147,5,B000AABL12,"A Review of the History Channel's
The True Story of the Bridge on the River Kwai
by Gerald T. Westbrook

 When I watched this on TV last night, I had the same feeling as I had when I first viewed ""The Pianist."" It is hard to believe that there is so much brutality wrapped up in the human body and soul, whether of Nazi or Japanese origin.

 When I viewed the Hollywood version, my recollection was a story of repeated beatings and very little and very miserable food. There was also the story of the senior British officer and his struggle with the Japanese camp commander. I recall they came to an agreement if they would let him lead ""his"" troops, he would get their bridge built. He did, but he essentially became insane as the movie ended. However, the true story was far different, and focused primarily on disease.

 First there was dysentry. Almost everyone in the camp had it at some time. Few had the complete control of their bowels so the ""barracks"" must have had a terrible stench, even though they were essentially wide open. And the opportunity to spread infections must have been huge.

 Then there was Malaria. The only treatment for this disease is Quinine, and while the Japanese controlled a major source, it was reserved for their own troops. And there were no mosquito nets and DDT had yet to be invented so the ""anglos"" were ripe for attack.

 The third problem was Cholera, a bqacterial infection of the small intestine. This caused ""a profuse watery diarrhea and vomiting."" It is caused ""primarily by drinking water, or eating food that has been contaminated by feces of an infected person."" The conditions at these camps could not have been stronger for the transmission of this bug.

 The final problems were infections, usually caused by scratches, pricks or cuts. In sane conditions, with very simple antiseptics, even soap and water, there would be no problem. But in these camps, the conditions were far from sane, and these tiny infections would grow to become major sores, then violent, bone exposed wounds, that frequently resulted in the loss of a leg.

 I may return to this review in the future and add to it via editing it. I may buy the DVD for ""The Bridge Over the River Kwai."" And I may also buy the novel ""The Bridge Over the River Kwai"" by Pierre Boule. One of the reviewers on The History Channel story suggested that these two will provide a useful perspective. ""All three works reveal horrid truths about human nature and the nature of man in their own particular ways.""",1332115200,4,2516,4.637387387387387
8077148,4,B000AABL12,"This History Channel product not only rides on the fame of the great Lean movie, ""The Bridge on the River Kwai,"" but it is also its severest critic. Roger Mudd, who introduces and concludes the narrative, is especially harsh, saying that it was William Hendrson, the Texan pilot who bombed the actual bride built by the prisoners, not William Holden. This, to me, reveals the irony of the merits of the film, which, such as it is, is so powerful that it provoked the justified responses of those surviving actual prisoners who suffered unbelievable atrocities as prisoners of war building the Bangkok-Rangoon railway for the Japanese during the early years (1942-1943) of the war in Asia. The DVD offers invaluable material, actual pictures of emaciated and sick prisoners working under the most inhuman conditions, and atrocities committed that are hardly imaginable. I would like to recommend to those that still love Lean's movie to read Pierre Boulle's novel, on which the picture was based. Boulle, himself a war prisoner in those days, describes the atrocities quite vividly. Try the novel, the movie (still useful even as fiction) and the DVD. All three works reveal horrid truths about human nature--and the nature of war--in their own particular ways.",1286755200,10,1260,5.091787439613527

8077150,4,B000AABL12,"This tells a story about the Pacific theater of WWII that needs to be told.  It is an interesting history, although it suffers some from it's constant references to the fictionalized Hollywood movie.  If you have not seen the Hollywood movie recently you might want to watch it first.  After seeing that you will want to know the real story anyway, and this DVD will mean more to you that way.",1273708800,6,393,4.507042253521127
8077151,5,B000AABL12,After seeing this on the actual history channel I had to get a copy for myself and my WWII history buff brother in law.  It tells the REAL story of the Bridge over the river Kwai which was so misrepresented by the movie that came out of Hollywood.  It was no bunch of whistling soldiers---it was a death camp.  A must for anyone who collects WWII movies and information.,1261526400,14,370,4.333333333333333
8077152,5,B000AABL12,"This was a good review of the ""True"" story. I visited the Bridge last year and was very touched at the site and the suffering that took place at this place. This film is well presented.",1258588800,7,185,4.166666666666667
8077153,4,B000AABL12,"Very well done.  Totally different from the movie we are all use to seeing.
This should be watched by anyone going to visit that area of the world.",1242777600,5,147,4.25
