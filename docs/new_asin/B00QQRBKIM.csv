6877452,5,B00QQRBKIM,"In this workout, you will do 2 to 3 sets of exercises, then do a finishing exercise (read:  really burn your muscles!)  You first work your chest, then move on to shoulders and then on to triceps.

I had to learn to put my ego aside with this workout.  I had to use much lighter weights than Cathe was using, but I still felt the burn and felt I got a fantastic workout.  Most of the exercises are traditional ones like chest presses, but the finisher exercises put a new twist on how your muscles feel.

I am slowly becoming a big fan of shorter workouts, especially workouts like this one where there isn't a minute wasted.  You really get it all done in about 40 minutes.

Time: 39:30 minutes.

Equipment needed:
Barbell - Cathe uses 35 pounds
Dumbbells - Cathe uses 30, 25, 10 and 5 pounds
Step with 4 risers
Mat
Exercise gloves.

Workout crew: Al, Amanda, Brenda and Jai.

Outfits: Ocean blue and royal blue tops with black and grey bottoms.

Premixes:  The premixes range in time from 17 minutes to 50 minutes.

The chest exercises include:

Chest press.  Finisher is pushups.
Incline chest press.  Finisher is triceps pushup.
Incline chest flies.  Finisher is incline pushup.

If you are looking for an efficient, fun and effective workout for your chest, shoulders and triceps you will enjoy this one.",1426982400,9,1647,4.83453237410072
8692316,5,B00QQRBKIM,"I LOVE this dvd.  I now have several of Cathe's workout dvds and this series is the one I most prefer (in addition to her spin dvds).  These are typical gym type moves with isolated exercises that really allow you to target specific muscles.  This is the kind of workout that tones far better for me than any circuit type training has.  I have rotator cuff issues due to RA and yet I can do all of these exercises with ease since they are controlled, slow movements.  I highly recommended this if you are looking for a good upper body workout that will tone and sculpt.",1529280000,,569,4.330188679245283

8692321,4,B00QQRBKIM,A very thorough upper body workout.  I have pain from posture and computer work.  I found it helpful in reliving pain.  I use light weights so I don't cause stress.,1470096000,,164,4.4

8692323,5,B00QQRBKIM,"You will definitely feel this one the next day!  I love all of Cathe's strength training workouts and while I'm particularly fond of those included in her XTrain series variety is the key!  This DVD makes you work - I've been doing Cathe's other weight oriented DVDs and thought I was in decent shape until I woke up very sore after my first attempt at this one.  I used mostly 15 and 20 pound dumbbells as I don't own a barbell and the dumbbells didn't detract from anything.

The workout itself is basic: for each body part you do three sets of two to three different exercises and each set is followed by a ""finisher"" (code word for ""fried muscles!"").

The chest portion includes regular chest presses (the finisher is push ups), incline chest presses (the finisher is tricep push ups) and incline chest flies (the finisher is decline push ups).  I couldn't do all the push ups, especially after exhausting the chest with the presses but I thought was a good thing because there's room to progress.

The triceps section focused on standing extensions (the finisher is tricep dips) and lying tricep extensions (the finisher is tricep kickbacks).  This was the easiest part of the DVD for me but those dips did get to me.

Shoulders included a superset of overhead presses and upright rows (the finisher is scarecrows) and another superset of lateral and front raises (the finisher is external rotation lateral raises).  The finisher really cooked my shoulders!  Cathe's ""Lift it Hiit it: Back, Biceps and Shoulders"" includes a different set of shoulder moves so if you have both DVDs your shoulders get a great workout.

Cathe does move at a pretty quick pace so have your weights handy!  My only gripe is that the cool down wasn't very long but that can be fixed by adding on your own stretches.  Other than that this is a solid DVD that goes by fast and is a definite challenge if you lift heavy enough.  Highly recommend for those who love strength training!",1463788800,2,1963,4.665697674418604
