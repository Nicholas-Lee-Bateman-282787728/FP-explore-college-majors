8200538,4,B000RGQ7XG,"UP IN CENTRAL PARK (1948):

Deanna Durbin's charm saves this otherwise paint-by-the-numbers operetta, based on the Broadway musical. One of the last major works of famed composer Sigmund Romberg, UP IN CENTRAL PARK showcases Deanna in a lush period setting.

Irish immigrants Rosie Moore (Deanna Durbin) and her Papa (Albert Sharpe) arrive in New York City with promises of wealth and prosperity. New York is under the corrupt hand of Boss Tweed (Vincent Price), who holds powerful sway with the Mayor and all the public officials. Accidentally stumbling in on one of Tweed's business meetings, Rosie helps her father get the position of the Central Park superintendent. With promises of kick-starting her career in opera, Rosie becomes another pawn in Tweed's web of corruption...can she be saved by crusading reporter John Matthews (Dick Haymes)?

Deanna's second-last movie appearance (""For the Love of Mary"" would be released several months later in the year), UP IN CENTRAL PARK is a cute diversion but hardly stands among Durbin's all-time best movies. The 1870's period setting suits her to a tee, and while she doesn't try to attempt an Irish accent, the role of Rosie completely becomes her in every other way. Vincent Price oozes urbane charm and guile as the corrupt Tweed; Albert Sharpe (""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"") is perfection as Rosie's Papa. Suave crooner Dick Haymes (1945's ""State Fair"") makes beautiful music with Ms Durbin.

NICE GIRL? (1941):

Deanna Durbin's first movie following America's entry into World War II was the delightful romantic comedy NICE GIRL?. In the film, Deanna plays a young woman who has lots of fun when her neighbours wrongly suspect her of having a ""loose"" reputation.

Co-starring Robert Stack (Deanna's leading man in ""First Love""), NICE GIRL? paints a sweet portrait of small-town America at a time when the effects of World War II were starting to infiltrate everyday activities. Deanna plays Jane Dana, the middle daughter of a highschool professor (Robert Benchley). Jane gets into untold strife when she drives her father's colleague Richard Calvert (Franchot Tone) back to his New York address and is forced to stay the night because of heavy rain. Of course Jane's totally innocent, but the townsfolk have other ideas when Jane is seen driving back in the wee hours of the morning, dressed in a chic ensemble belonging to Richard's sister!

Deanna must have had fun playing with her wholesome screen image in NICE GIRL?, one of the first movies which displayed the songbird with a more mature subject matter. Deanna gets to sing ""Love at Last"", ""Perhaps"", and ""Beneath the Lights of Home"". She closes the film with a stirring medley of ""Thank You America"" and ""There'll Always Be an England"".",1307750400,2,2759,5.077262693156733
