8151498,3,B000JK8O7M,"This was taken from the VHS 2 tape series which was out before.

Problem is that they cut over 20 minutes of it out to create a

single DVD lesson. Some of what they cut was the best parts, like

showing how Steve Cropper played When a man loves a woman.

You're much better off finding the VHS tapes. Why Homespun did

this is beyond me. The VHS tapes were 5 star rhythmn guitar tapes.

This one only gets 3 for cutting out a lot of the material.",1167868800,6,447,4.0227272727272725
