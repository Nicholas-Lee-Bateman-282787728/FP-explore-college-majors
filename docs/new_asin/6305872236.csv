But  with the 2040 series, it's the plot that's outstanding, and the music  that's okay.  Of course you only really get to hear the opening and ending  themes, so its hard to judge.
The voice actors for the English dubbed  volumes do a wonderful job.  It's one of the best dubs I've heard.  Right  up there with Shinesman, and Neon Genesis.
2040 features a wonderful  amount of character development, and some very exciting plot developments  that will keep you hooked.",963705600,,682,4.834782608695652
