8468732,4,B005EMNLN2,"Very enjoyable, and a splendid overview of Paganini's life.  Gidon Kremer has never been one of my favorite violinists but
I suppose he was a good choice to play the accompaniments.  Perhaps it would've been good if Salvatore Accardo and a couple others who
specialize in Paganini had been included in it as well.  Several segments of the film are VERY effective and I could almost
feel just how mythical and superhuman Paganini was.",1344988800,,433,4.824324324324325
8468733,3,B005EMNLN2,"Generally it is a good DVD with extensive materials.
However, the way to organize those materials is not interesting enough--most of the materials are quatations by prominent people, drawings, paintings, plus the narration. Though there are scenes of violin playing (almost only by Kremer, and only the violin or part of the violin is shown), the scenes are not exciting and celebrating. As a result, watching this DVD is like reading a book.
I think the author might have used more intersting ways to present the history, such as scenes of actors' imitating the historical activities, scenes of violin playing by more different violinists, as used in some successful documentary DVDs,",1343088000,2,685,5.18018018018018

In a very well written and carefully researched documentary/bio, Christopher Nupen explores the legendary life of Niccolo Paganini, arguably the first international musical superstar. Included with the gossip and commentary of his contemporaries are reviews (good and bad) from a variety of sources and a generous sampling of Paganini's music, ably performed by Gidon Kremer, John Williams and a Swiss/Italian orchestra and chorus.
Alternately dishy and academic, this program was part of a series of composer documentaries (others include Schubert and Tchaikovsky) undertaken by Mr. Nupen; if the others are anywhere nearly as well done as ""Paganini's Daemon"", then they likewise belong on a `must see' list. While we're at it, someone might send a copy to the people at the Biography Channel, just to give them an idea of how it should be done.
