5463298,3,B00AOCMSLI,If you liked Descent you'll definitely like this one.,1438992000,2,53,5.0
5463299,3,B00AOCMSLI,"After reading the reviews, I expected something tedious, poorly-acted, absurd. The film was a pleasant surprise. The acting wasn't bad and the story was imaginative and engaging. In fact, it's better than many horror movies.",1373068800,5,224,5.428571428571429
5463300,2,B00AOCMSLI,"Yes this is one of those forgetful movies that has perhaps one or two moments you might recall after seeing it but for the most part is pretty forgettable. There are many movies like this released each year and its sad to think someone worked hard to get a movie made that falls into this category but it happens. I will say that there was enough creativity on display in this film that maybe down the road those behind it will come up with something better.

The story moves back and forth in time but essentially boils down to this. We have a young newlywed couple, Mark and Lesley, happy and in love but with a terrible set of neighbors. The neighbors constantly fight and the guy seems to enjoy beating his wife which causes Mark to step in between the two of them and break up a battle. Never a good thing.

The result of Mark's interference is that the neighbor shows up to his house one day and while threatening Lesley accidentally kills her. Mark finds her body and mourns her loss but her father has other plans. He shows with Lesley's brother and along with Mark, they take her to a strange trailer located out in the middle of the desert. Here a fast talking mysterious stranger named Gus who takes the trio and corpse into his home. He warns them that they can't come back ever again and that whatever happens happens. No take backs. That should make people pause but then again this is a movie.

Of course he brings Lesley back from the dead but at what costs? When things begin to get a little strange they eventually head back to the desert and confront Gus and have him fix whatever is wrong. Hey wait; didn't he say no take backs?

As with most movies where the dead are brought back to life by those who love them they never quite come back the same way. Nothing new here. But there are some nice touches to the film that just never quite makes its way into making it one worth watching. Low budget film making that shows it but as I said, the potential in those involved can be glimpsed but never to the point of making the film entertaining.",1372118400,3,2062,4.33419689119171
5463301,1,B00AOCMSLI,"So I read about 6 good reviews on IMDB about this mess... Err ..... Movie. I was jazzed at how good it sounded. Just like restaurant and hotel reviews, movie reviews are now stacked by the producers. I saw no obvious directing or attempt at directing. It was almost as if there was just the actors and the cameraman. The high point was where the lead actress took off her shirt. Mostly because she stopped talking while her shirt was off. She was nicely endowed but had the allure of a NyQuil commercial in bed. So few FX, so little character development and no action, save about 15 minutes worth if you compiled it from all scenes. No, I can't say I liked any of this. If I could get my money back I would ask for it. But since I have already been robbed of my $3.99 I thought I would save you yours.",1369353600,9,802,4.180645161290323
5463302,2,B00AOCMSLI,"Much of this story line was used from other monster, horror, or thrillers movies in the past.  After the first half, the plot starts getting predictable.  There is some uniqueness as it does not follow all the common vampire rules, though.",1367625600,4,239,4.804878048780488
5463303,4,B00AOCMSLI,Movie was slow to begin but once you get into the story it keeps you intrigued. I would recommend it to friends and family.,1366761600,6,123,4.166666666666667
5463304,4,B00AOCMSLI,This is a horror movie that left me with a warm fuzzy feeling. It's well told with interesting characters. Some may say the first few minutes are slow but it gets real interesting real fast. I watched it 3 times already.,1366761600,2,220,4.390243902439025
5463305,2,B00AOCMSLI,"KISS THE ABYSS is a bizarre movie to say the least.  A young wife dies after an assault from a loutish neighbor.  Her grieving husband, father and brother take her to a man in the desert who has some kind of serum that brings her back to life but with the requisite unpleasant consequences.  Think The Monkey's Paw.
KISS THE ABYSS tries hard to be original but it suffers from an incoherent plot and mediocre acting.  Its enigmatic finale is also disappointing.",1362960000,8,461,4.585365853658536
5463306,3,B00AOCMSLI,was ok worth watching if bored,1484352000,,30,4.166666666666667
5463307,3,B00AOCMSLI,"I liked this movie.  It's wasn't great, but it was okay.  It's not the typical slasher horror movie that's out there.  The acting wasn't great, but the story line was.  If you feel like something different in horror I'd give it a shot.",1483315200,,235,4.395348837209302
5463308,1,B00AOCMSLI,Never finished the movie!,1482278400,,25,5.5
5463309,1,B00AOCMSLI,Bad acting and the story is stereotypical.,1481846400,,42,5.142857142857143
5463310,4,B00AOCMSLI,"Very, Very different from any zombie or vampire movie I've seen.  Acting was a little rough, but these are unknowns.  I honestly thought they made it more believable with the stunned or shocked behavior.
The trailer park wife bit with the brother was over the top...  I think seeing her would motivate anyone to run like ****..",1481155200,,327,4.701754385964913
5463311,3,B00AOCMSLI,"I really liked it..I went into it thinking it would be your basic ""B"" movie, but it has a uniqueness to it. So many of the B movies you don't give a hoot about the characters, but in this one you do...A different type of vampire. I hope to see a sequel!",1481068800,3,253,3.8846153846153846
5463312,5,B00AOCMSLI,very goof,1479254400,,9,4.0
5463313,4,B00AOCMSLI,Doesn't follow same old paths. Interesting characters. Fairly good.,1479081600,,67,6.555555555555555
5463314,3,B00AOCMSLI,Movie was entertaining enough.,1475539200,,30,6.75
5463315,3,B00AOCMSLI,Pretty interesting movie fairly well put together,1475452800,,49,6.142857142857143
5463316,2,B00AOCMSLI,Mildly entertaining but I only managed to watch half of it with no desire to know the ending.,1474761600,,93,4.222222222222222
5463317,4,B00AOCMSLI,"This was better than your typical zombie or vampire movie.  You actually cared about the two main characters and could feel how much they loved each other.  It was a little sad and tragic yet had some scenes where some of the bad characters got their ""just desserts"" and even a little humor as in the scene where her brother is trapped with a crazed ""undead"" woman.  This was an entertaining little flick, better than most and while it may be predictable in some ways, the story is a little different than most of this type.",1461801600,,524,4.4375
5463318,3,B00AOCMSLI,"I do not remember much about this movie, so im guessing I didn't find entertaining, forgettable more like it",1461283200,,108,4.7368421052631575
5463319,1,B00AOCMSLI,"I think I put this on because the cover art looked cool. The first 20 minutes are basically worthless, a collage of flashbacks inter-cut with car scenes, so it's a relief when the plot finally gets off the ground-- or so you'd think: what initially seemed like a low-budget hipster take on ""Let The Right One In,"" with shoddier acting but at least some good chemistry between the two leads, soon veers off in a completely different direction, a mess I can only describe as, ""Deadgirl meets Kalifornia w/ naked dungeon mutants."" The low-key vibe of the middle part or interlude, a relatively straightforward plot hinge not unlike in ""Come Back to Me"" or ""Pet Sematary"" where the characters are deciding how to deal with the central dilemma and there's still some interest to be had in what happens next, is eventually sacrificed for a cheesy gore-fest without a discernable or even possible dramatic resolution, just hokey actors beating on each other for violence's sake. Honestly I was already lost by the time a supporting character who I thought had died earlier showed up near the end for second helpings.",1459641600,,1109,4.842105263157895
5463320,4,B00AOCMSLI,The only thing that kept it from being a five star movie was it's low budget.  Really really enjoyed this film.,1457740800,,111,4.285714285714286

5463324,1,B00AOCMSLI,1 star for a bad movie that earned it...,1454284800,,40,3.5555555555555554
5463325,1,B00AOCMSLI,And the media wonders why all the wild and murderous rampages!  With all of this gorefest smut for widespread dissemination and consumption who could possibly wonder why murder is becoming a major staple in the Amerikan Diet!,1444348800,,225,5.081081081081081

5463333,2,B00AOCMSLI,I did not care for this movie at all.  It is like a bad zombie movie but the zombies are made and are not contagious.,1439683200,,117,3.68
5463334,1,B00AOCMSLI,"This one serves up the worst of what the low-budget world of horror has to offer. With the exception of the two leads, the acting isdare I say it?abysmal. And not in a good way. Exemplifying the contemporary trend of keeping the viewer in the dark about the why's and wherefores, the script reveals nothing about the origin of the creatures, their needs or motivations. Like good devotees of J.J. Abrams, the writers leave a butt-load of legitimate questions unanswered, a trick that may pass muster if the actors and production team turn out decent character studies and action scenes. Alas, this team does neither. The best one can say about ""Kiss the Abyss"" is the makeup is great.",1439596800,,684,4.756302521008403

8555362,4,B00AOCMSLI,"**** 3-1/2 Stars ****  Among the ""B"" indie horror flicks on Amazon or Netflix, ""Kiss The Abyss"" is a bit above the norm - it's very imaginative and generally well-paced, acted and filmed.  But let's be clear - this is only a cut or two above a talented amateur project .. its only real strength is in the somewhat unique plot, and the way it unfolds.  With nods to H.P. Lovecraft (""Herbert West: Re-animator"") and numerous horror flicks from the past, ""Kiss The Abyss"" is a fun watch - you will figure out where this is going early on, but you'll want to see 'what happens next' anyway.  I liked it, your mileage will vary.  Thanks for reading.",1522022400,,644,4.423728813559322
8555363,4,B00AOCMSLI,"While the first half of this film drags a bit, it makes up for some great work at the end. I FF'd through most of the first half and I don't think I suffered for it. The ending isn't you simple, down-pat wrap up. The second half is a little strong, but not over-the-top. Think House of 1000 Corpses meets Hill Have Eye, and you won't be disappointed",1498262400,,349,4.147058823529412

8555366,1,B00AOCMSLI,Too bad. I had some hope for this one base on the concept. Ending is a disaster of mish mush.,1495756800,,93,3.7
8555367,3,B00AOCMSLI,"It was what I would consider a B+ movie because it was more original than most.  The junkyard guy and the female lead are good actors;  the rest are awful.  With better acting and more emphasis on the plot, it might have fooled me into believing it was a major production.",1495584000,,272,4.294117647058823
8555368,5,B00AOCMSLI,"I found this to be a really unique movie....kind of an B+ movie in places, but it definitely keeps your interest. By B movie, it wasn't the acting...that was pretty good..I think it was the sound in the film. A man and his wife have terrible neighbors and a terrible tragedy unfolds...I don't want to give the plot away, but this is definitely worth your attention!! I absolutely loved how this ended! A sequel needs to be made!!",1494892800,,429,4.512820512820513
