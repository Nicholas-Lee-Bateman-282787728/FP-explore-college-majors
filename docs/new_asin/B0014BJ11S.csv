8254938,2,B0014BJ11S,"Yeah this may be historically significant, but for learning purposes the limitations of an old vhs-to-dvd production are obvious. Stu Hamm is a great artist, but check out other material first if you're looking for study material instead of a ""film"" that you just wish to watch from start to finish. It does contain practice sessions with notation on screen, but image quality is poor, and there is no notation or other material that you could print.",1262044800,5,450,4.857142857142857
8254939,4,B0014BJ11S,"Yes it's the 1990 VHS production of Stuart's instructional DVD, with a few add on intros to position it as such.  However, getting around a DVD like these reissues is so much easier than the old tapes that even if you already had one you might want one again.  Stuart was the really first guy to popularise finger tapping, slapping, popping, flamenco rasque's, and general 'off-the-map' playing in that late 80's 90's period.  As such this is a time capsule of what was leading edge at that time - and has not often been advanced since.  99% of bass players can't do this stuff (me included - and I teach) and there's a whole load of material here to extend what you can do with the bass in a band support role and in soloing.  For the cost of one lesson these have a huge amount of content.",1211846400,7,791,4.3175675675675675
