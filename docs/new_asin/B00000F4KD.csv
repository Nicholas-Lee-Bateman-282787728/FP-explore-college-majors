1203001,4,B00000F4KD,"Nice guy Gary (Lawrence Monoson) is having trouble getting the attention of the pretty new girl in school (Diane Franklin).  Trouble is, she likes his studly friend Rick (Steve Antin), who basically treats her like dirt.  Story basically follows Gary and Rick and tubby friend David (Joe Rubbo) on their sexual misadventures, which basically gets them nowhere quick.  Despite all the sexual innuendo and cruelty in the story, Gary's teenage angst will surely bring back memories for many male viewers.  Great early '80's soundtrack.  In light of ""Porky's"" and ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" and all the other teen genre films of the early '80's this is an overlooked item, but a good one.  Good cast and believeable acting increase the appeal here.",982540800,5,748,5.040650406504065

The transfer looks great, as great as can be expected (you will see film grain but the detail is very good).  Much better than DVD, for sure - the clarity of skin looks great (and don't tell me you didn't buy this to see some skin...)

Even better, I'm very happy to say that all the playback functions are enabled, so ZOOM and LOOP A-B both work!

1203130,3,B00000F4KD,"This movie is really, really jarring. It starts out as a fairly typical teen sex comedy of the early 1980's and then, about two-thirds of the way through, morphs into something totally different. After all the hijinks we see with three teenage boys trying to get ""experienced"" (the production team even brought in legendary softcore/hardcore erotic star Kitten Natividad as a prostitute who ends up giving the boys VD), the film switches over completely to a very serious story about a love triangle between the fundamentally nice-guy lead, the love 'em and leave 'em Romeo, and the girl in the middle who's loved by the hero but only has eyes for the Romeo - and who ends up getting in real trouble. No spoilers, but the movie gets very emotionally heavy and difficult to watch, and the ending - as a lot of other reviewers have noted - hits you like a punch in the mouth. It's VERY different from the stereotypical ""happy Hollywood ending"", if perhaps rather more realistic. I'm personally giving it 3 stars only because when I watched the movie (over 30 years ago, in the theater) it was so different from what I had expected going in (I don't really like surprises when it comes to movies unless I know in advance there's going to be some kind of twist), and I personally have never liked that kind of ending so I always tend to take a star or two off for that.  That being said, however, I do recommend this movie as being a lot more mature - in the best sense of the word - than your average 1980's teen sex comedy. Just be prepared to have a strong emotional reaction to the last third of the movie and the ending, and to maybe have some very serious discussions about relationships and sex afterward if you're watching it with anyone else.",1459209600,,1747,4.511041009463723

1203375,5,B00000F4KD,"I recently found this movie under the free section and thought I'd give it a watch because I'm a huge 80s mark. After viewing it, I was actually pissed off but at the same time, I understood that sometimes it's the reality of life. Nowadays, teen films don't really teach any lessons or try to relate to teens but this one did, which is why I now love it so much.

This is about 3 high school guys: main protagonist Gary, your average and somewhat lonely high school student, lascivious ladies man, Rick, and husky comic relief, David. The 3 guys are compulsive sex pigs, looking to get laid at every turn. Rick and David usually succeed while Gary seems to fail at every turn.

Along the way, Gary meets Karen, a beautiful, recent student who transferred to their school. Gary instantly falls in love with her and plans on trying to get together with her. Unfortunately for him, Rick gets to her first, whom she instantly falls for and plans on popping her cherry. The 3 try to take their game to the next level by having sex with a hooker. This turns out to be a bad idea as they end up with a bad case of.....crabs.

Not too long after, Rick has sex with Karen and kicks her to the curb days later after discovering she's pregnant. Gary witnesses the break-up and comforts a heart broken Karen, seeing this as his chance to finally obtain the love he's been looking so long for. Gary goes to extreme lengths, sacrificing his saved money and belongings to get Karen an abortion before anyone finds out. The end of the film is an emotional shocker yet a sad reality of how life is sometimes. I won't give away the ending but as I said at the beginning, it pissed me off. Nonetheless, The Last American Virgin is one for the ages!",1398643200,,1730,4.383177570093458

Sure, it has a lot of the same stuff we've seen before: horny guys trying to get girls and the funny things that happen in the process.  Sure some of the scenes are far fetched and would never happen in real life.

Yet, despite the far fetched scenes, what is unique about the movie is how realistic it is.  Some of the making out and sex scenes are not what you see nowadays.  It would be hard to imagine a current movie portraying teenagers in this way. And man oh man what an ending.  This is NOT just a silly teenager movie.  This film will school you.  Don't believe me?

1203379,4,B00000F4KD,"Virginity is up against some stiff competition in this uproariously ""entertaining"" comedy about 3 sex-starved high school buddies with only one thing left to lose. With a ""bittersweet style"" (The Hollywood Reporter) and pulsing with music by U2, The Cars, Devo and more, The Last American Virgin is a devastatingly funny ""teen romp that's a notch above""!

This semester, Gary, Rick and David aredetermined to get laid even if it means going toe to toe with a hilarious array of high-strung hookers, naughty nymphomaniacs and naive high school girls, but when Gary(Lawrence Monson) falls for the girl of his dreams(Diane Franklin)only to learn that she's about to become Rick's latest conquesthe soon discovers that having sex doesn't just mean losing his virginity, it may mean losing his innocence forever.

This comedy/drama flick also takes me back to memory lane to when I was 10 years old in the 4th grade when it was theatrically released in the Fall of 1982 and when Ronald Reagan was president and we had all those fiscal budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982.",1391040000,,1095,4.945652173913044

I can definitely see why so many love this movie. i mean, how many times do we really get to hear the other side of the story when it comes to ""love"" stories?

Not that high up, but, you know, still on the list. I'd never heard of this film before one of my friends, finding out that I was a LAV virgin, got the movie and showed it to me, declaring it a classic and one of his favorite films of all time. Reading the reviews on this site, it appears he's not alone.

The movie has two basic plots: a group of three guys -- Gary (our ""hero""), Rick (the hot ladies' man), and David (the fat comic relief) -- spend every free moment trying to have sex; meanwhile, Gary ""falls in love"" with a beautiful transfer student named Karen, but she does not return his affections.

The writer/director tries to mingle a romantic drama with the gross-out, slapsticky humor of a throwaway sex comedy, and the results are mixed, at best. The only thing that is a real success is the ending of the film, which has a lot more potency than you get in either genre, especially for flicks that came out of the gaudiest years of the 80s. Some have complained about the ending -- because it is definitely an example of rug yanking -- but many more have praised it, because it doesn't just have strength, but it has truthfulness to it, and that's what makes it so bitter and lasting and memorable.

I mean, kinda.

The ending only really works if you care for the characters, and although Gary is presented as our protagonist, he's only slightly less despicable than the rest of this friends. He tries to dip his wick as much as the others, but we're supposed to root for him because, every once in a while, he shows reluctance. In a movie where every other character is given only one personality trait, Gary is given one and a half and we are supposed to identify with that, but I didn't buy it. He was as sleazy as his friends, he just had the added drawback of being kind of wishy-washy and whiny about it.

To make the situation even less dramatic, Karen never really demonstrates that she's even worthy of love. Apparently Gary falls in love with her just because he's supposed to (or -- more likely -- because she's the prettiest girl in the film). And until the last third of the movie, his affection for her is indistinguishable from his constantly demonstrated horniness. When Gary finally starts behaving in a redeemable way, it is really hard to believe it's for any suddenly pure reasons. Minus the weak tricks the film uses to get empathy (count how many times the tears are obviously glued onto faces), there's no one here to care about. And although that can sometimes fly in a roly-poly nyuck-em-up comedy, this film is trying to be a lot more than that.

Even the goofy parts feel rehearsed and half-hearted. The best example of this is a scene where all the boys in a locker room decide to measure themselves to see who is the most endowed. This takes place over a nutty eighties montage, where all the boys appear to have ... uh ... let's say tumescence, while they're lined up to be measured. I thought maybe the film was leading to a twist ending -- turns out the boys were gay! -- that I would've appreciated a lot more, and that would even have made more sense given how weirdly obsessed they were not just with sex but with having sex TOGETHER. On one occasion, promised sex, Gary stops and gets his buddies before proceeding.

Overall, the film has a unique approach, a killer (if not repetitive) soundtrack, and enough T&A to satisfy any sympathetic horndogs in the audience, but its lack of character development as well as a really unclear timeline (do the events take place over two weeks or a year?) as well as its plastic approach to comedy make this film funny mainly on accident and powerfully done in the cheapest way possible.",1385424000,,4394,5.002735978112175

When he arrives he finds her in the kitchen making out with Rick and as he stares heartbroken and they both look at him without any remorse or care towards him which follows with Gary driving away from the party sad and fades into the end credits. In my opinion that is one of the worst endings I have seen a movie have. Most drama's I've seen even have better endings than this show and this is a comedy romance which by the way has almost no romance in the show accept for when Gary almost gets Karen. The show is mainly about three sex crazed teenagers doing who and whatever it takes to get laid.

1203554,5,B00000F4KD,"A friend of mine always kept talking about The Last American Virgin and how good the movie was. I finally checked it out and i've got to say that it not only is a funny movie and 1980s classic, but it's also more realistic than you think.

Unlike over the top films where the hot-beautiful girl ends up with the average joe, Last American Virgin hits you with a hard core truth....that the average joes don't end up with the pretty girls.

The film revolves around Gary, David and Rick. Gary is the hopeless romantic and a Virgin. Rick is the Romeo and stud of the group, and David is the funny chubby kid.

All three are on a mission to get laid as much as possible. They have some pretty funny moments throughout the movie, like their encounter with Carmela.

But during the film, Gary falls for Karen, and even sabotages her bike so he can give her a ride. Karen meanwhile, has fallen for Rick and the two begin dating. Eventually, Rick does it with Karen, who ends up pregant, and Rick breaks up with her. Gary steps in and helps Karen get an abortion and reveals that he's fallen for her, which she doesn't deny.

Thinking that they are about to become an official couple, he goes out and spends quite a bit of money on jewlery for her, which he plans to give her at a party, but once there, he opens the kitchen door and his heart falls into his stomach. Karen has reunited with Rick.

Some people were kinda upset, I wasn't, because this is pretty much true to life as it can get. Life isn't a Disney movie, it can be a kick in between the legs.

Some pretty cool notes to take are that Rick (Steve Antin) played Troy from Goonies and Karen (Diane Franklin) played Monique from Better off Dead (Cusak's love interest).

My only beef, and what really made the film funny was watching Antin try and place a straight kid. He cannot pull it off. The clothes, his body language, everything. But overall, the movie is good. Well worth a watch.",1271203200,,1944,4.350828729281768
1203555,5,B00000F4KD,"Very realistic.  Many girls I know nowadays are like Karen in the movie.

** spoiler warning **

Women don't like nice guys but like the bad guys, or the guys that don't treat them too well, the guys that they have ""feelings"" for.  Divorce rate is up to 50% nowadays, go figure.  I see example of nice guys being taken advantage of, and bullied, while these same girls die and cry for the guys that abuse them.

One thing that happened too fast in the movie might be that Karen already kissed with Rick so soon near the end of the movie.  Usually it would be Karen hating Rick at first, but can't control herself after some time, but I think the movie made it sooner just for the continuation of the movie.",1265760000,,706,4.2631578947368425

1203558,3,B00000F4KD,"The first time I saw this movie man i was pissed at the ending. This movie truly tells the real life story of why nice guys finish last. Most american girls don't want a regular guy that bends to their every need, they want a goodlookin stud who only comes around to drill their brains out & then take off. So this kid Gary & his buddies are virgins. Gary meets this new girl at school and immediately developes a crush on her, the new girl has a crush on the school stud who is one of Gary's friends. Here's the reality, even though the girl knows the guys a stud & will do her wrong, she still feels compelled to give herself to him so that he'll like her. Man i've seen this happen in real life a thousand times. So anyway, the stud knocks the precious new girl up & leaves her in the corner crying & alone. Then here comes superidiot to the rescue. Gary skips a class trip he was going to attend & then damn near sells everything in his bedroom to raise money for Karen's (the precious new girl Diane Franklin) abortion, he then nurses her back to health while everyone else including the stud are off having a blast on the class trip. And oh yeah, the stud has different girls the whole time as well. I figured at this point, Karen would've felt obligated to at least give Gary a HandJ or sumfin. So you figure after basically cutting off one of his arms, Gary has done the life altering deed required for a regular joe-blow to claim the heart of a beautiful girl such as Diane Franklin but no, there will be no happy ending. He comes to the class trip after party & catches a muddy boot to the face with no reacharound by Karen who is once again in the arms of Mr. Wonderful who I think then thanks Gary for paying for the abortion because now he can get back to drilling. Gary meanwhile gets in his car and drives to the city convention center in tears where the town Mayor & other residents are waiting to present him with the loser of the century award, THE END!",1249948800,10,1971,4.189473684210526

1203635,5,B00000F4KD,"I saw this rare gem in a local video store discount bin but passed on it because the DVD case looked too dated and I doubted the condition. When I did an about face and went back to buy it, it was gone. After finding it here at Amazon and reading all the glowing reviews, now I know why.

This tale of a trio of youth blessed age comers on the make, two of which fatefully vy for the attentions of the same girl, sets you up for school lays scoring and lets you down with gilted reality all in the name of that old fashioned anti-heroic movie staple called real life.

Lead virginal victim Lawrence Monoson is a dead ringer for Jon Cryer. This was his first film and you almost wonder why he didn't follow it up and his star didn't rise to similar heights in the Hollywood teen angst genre. Be that as it may, its a keeper performance that stole the film.

For trivia buffs, James Ingram's immortal ""Just Once"" serves as the anti-climactic finale theme song. As indeed, it reminds us of a time in Hollywood when scripts, casting and soundtrack still all gelled to make even campy B kids movies appeal to and win over serious adult audiences.

A lot of armchair critics who dismiss this heart-wrenching old school jewel as just another 80s teen flick don't understand the context of the decade it precipitated, the window of media truth it represented and just how far our social mores and pop culture have gone downhill since.

A naive young love morality play of a mensch who becomes a lapdog for a pretty face and gets his heart broken, this was a filmic metaphor for 80s generation bliss which started with innocent moviefare like this and culminated in the greed-is-good ""Wall Street"" age of excess that followed.

If there were a best of the 80s time capsule, this would be the token throw-in for the perpetual teen set. Sadly, innocence like this wouldn't play in today's evil-is-hip media jungle. If there were a remake, the nice guy would still lose the girl and it would end in gang violence.

To wit, every cinema epoch has its rite of passage picture that defines coming of age. The 70s had ""Summer of '42"" and the 80s had this teen tearjerk matinee plot twister. Whoever rediscovers it finds out why the best moviemaking escapism will suspend your belief in happy endings.",1190505600,4,2284,4.5157384987893465

Although Kev comes off as a less conceptualized, more coherant and perhaps authentic character. This film also features hort, but unique appearances from legendary Minneapolis punk rock bands Onward To Mayhem and The Subversives, who also appear opn the soundtrack and throughout the film.

1203702,1,B00000F4KD,"""The Last American Virgin"" was literally one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and that's saying a lot. It's not a surprise no one from this film went on to any sort of stardom. The writing was terrible, the acting was terrible, the direction was terrible, the pacing was terrible, the jokes were god-awful, etc. Even the girls weren't really that attractive (with the huge '80s hair and bad fashion)! I mean, what the hell was that fat, ugly, dorky girl with the glasses doing in this movie, and, even more perplexing, why was our ""hero"" trying to lay her?? And why was our ""hero"" best friends with that jerk who kept screwing him over with the girl he was in love with? They would be at each other's throats in one scene and then best friends in the next! I would say that the only redeeming quality of this movie was the soundtrack, but then they started repeating the same songs over and over again. I guess the producers ran out of money to fund the rights to extra songs. They played ""Whip It"" twice, ""Shake It Up"" at least three times, and, at last count, ""Just Once"" like five times, when ""Once"" was certainly enough. Songs that I didn't know at the beginning of the movie I  knew by heart word for word by the end. To top it all off, this movie had one of the worst, most disastrous endings I've ever seen. I can maybe understand if this was a heartfelt, coming-of-age drama, but when you're doing a mindless, teen-sex comedy, you don't end on a downer and depress the audience! After all the hell our ""hero"" goes through, he ends up driving home alone without the girl and still a virgin, and then, without any follow-up or warning, the credits start rolling! I was like, ""What the hell?""

The only great thing about the movie is that I had a ball paying ""MST3K,"" only no one was around to appreciate my witty, sardonic remarks, so I'll have to reproduce them here for your pleasure:

On Arguing with Your ""Best Friend"" Over the ""Love of Your Life"":

""Hey, I stalked her first!""

On Sparking Up a Romance with Said Girl:

""Remember our awkward conversation in my pizza mobile? Didn't that mean anything to you??""

On Declaring Your Love for Said Girl:

""I've loved you ever since I destroyed your bike just so you'd talk to me!""

On Major Operations, ""Not that Big a Deal"":

Real line (referring to the girl's upcoming abortion): ""Hey, it happens all the time. It's not that big a deal.""

My line: ""Yeah, it's a simple coat hanger procedure!""

(and later)

Real line: ""I know dozens of girls who've done it!""

My line: ""I've helped all the gals in the neighborhood. They call me Dr. Abortion!""

On Nerds at Parties:

""Man, there's nothing cooler than sucking from a juice box with a straw! Aww, yeah!!""

On Fat Girls, Inconsistent Characterizations of:

Real line: ""You know I have to be home by a quarter to 12!""

(a minute later)

""You said you had drugs! Where are they?""

My line: ""I have to be home by midnight or my parents will kill me! So fu*k me in the a$$ and let's do some blow before they come home!""

On Choose Your Mate Carefully:

(as our ""heroes"" scratch their balls after having sex with a promiscuous, older woman) ""Nothing's funnier than getting gonorrhea, eh folks?!""

1203704,5,B00000F4KD,"Lawrence Monoson (Gary), Steve Antin (Rick), and Diane Franklin (Karen) star in this poignant yet funny movie about two guys who fall in love with the same girl.  Karen has just moved to town a short time ago, and almost immediately, Gary falls for her.  However, Gary's best friend Rick has also fallen for her.  However, life still goes on for Rick, Gary, and David (Joe Rubbo).  As typical teenage boys, they are concerned with only one thing; getting laid.

They try their luck with three gils they met at a local restaurant, only to have Gary's parents come home just when things were starting to get interesting. Next, they discover an older woman (Louisa Martinez), who really enjoys sex, but her boyfriend arrives home unexpectedly.  Finally, they end up going to a local hooker, but they all catch crabs from her, and are forced to spend hours in the local pool trying to drown them.

Despite all of the different escapades, the story still revolves around Rick, Gary, and Karen.  Karen and Rick finally have sex, much to Gary's surprise and anguish.  Karen learns that she's pregnant and once she tells Rick, he immediately dumps her, saying he no longer loves her.  Gary comes to her rescue, offering to pay for her abortion by selling his stereo and using his own money.  The two become close and Gary seems to think that they're a couple now.  But what will happen in the end?  Will Gary and Karen stay together or will Rick come back?

This is one of my favorite movies.  I've seen it many times on late-night television, and I was glad to find it on DVD.  The story is excellent and the soundtrack, which includes such great 80's groups as Journey, REO Speedwagon, and Devo, makes the movie that much better.  I give this movie my highest recommendation.

1203706,3,B00000F4KD,"If you were not one of us from the generation of ""The Last American Virgin"", you should remember that most of the positive comments are from viewers who saw this when it was originally released and cherish it for its nostalgia value. It is not on the classic level of ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"" even though Diane Franklin was almost as big an early 80's teen goddess as Phoebe Cates. Although in some respects ""The Last American Virgin"" could be considered a ""Porky-ized"" ""Fast Times"", that comparison only works for the first two thirds of the movie.

The final third takes an unexpected and rather painful detour down Reality Sreet. Although this was not as painful for those of us who got off more on Rose (Kimmy Robertson of Twin Peaks fame) than on Karen (Franklin). Karen was very dangerous, both for Gary and for most viewers because Franklin was so sweet looking at that age. Movie conventions pointed with absolute certainty toward Karen having a heart of gold and toward a happy Gary-Karen resolution.

But writer/director Boaz Davidson was not particularly concerned with convention, nor with logic, story foundation, or good film-making structure. He mostly just wanted to mix the two main male film genres and more by accident than design ended up with a unique and original product. It is not so much a movie as an interesting mismatch of touching drama and side-show gross-out. Because Davidson ignores foundation and structure, ""The Last American Virgin"" is able to bounce from vignette to vignette and take the audience for a fun ride. But there are reasons for foundation and structure which becomes apparent as the movie eventually implodes.

Still it is fun while it lasts and Davidson does manage a nice examination of the hypocrisy and hollowness or the sex-idolization process; worshiping the girl-next-door while banging prostitutes-etc. Note the contradictions in the sequence of the shamefaced girl at the abortion clinic as Davidson directs the camera to tilt down from her face to her naked breasts.

The recently released DVD is the way to go as it is an excellent transfer and provides both standard and widescreen formats. The Dolby Soundtrack is clean, serving up a host of '80s hits.

I'd always kind of secretly hoped there would be some kind of a sequel, maybe a Last American Virgin 2: Revenge of the Nerd?  It seemed so depressing and unfair to leave this great guy stuck for all eternity driving off into the rain.  But then it's that raw kick-in-the-gut irony that made this film memorable.

Oh, and the music is still awesome, especially Journey.  Every time I hear 'Open Arms' now, I remember not so much the movie itself, but the feel of it.

1203710,5,B00000F4KD,"Boaz Davidson's The Last American Virgin is more than a teen sex comedy. In actuality it's a far more intelligent and complex film than people give it credit for.

TLAV is actually the tragic character study of ""Nice Guy"" Gary (Lawrence Monsoon) and his road to ruin in romance. There's a reason why ""Nice Guys finish last"" and this movie shows us why. In the first few scenes of the film we see where Gary makes his biggest mistake. At the restaurant where Karen and Rose buy the ice cream, Gary blows the opportunity to make his move. It was then that he should have introduced himself and started a conversation with Karen.

Gary's ""Nice Guy"" approach costs him other opportunities as well. Later on his friends David and Rick hook up with some ladies and party at Gary's house. While the confident David and Rick score easy, Gary's insecurity and passivity leave him with the ugly fat girl. Davidson smartly uses the ugly fat girl as a metaphor for the types of women ""Nice Guys"" wind up with, ugly on the inside, difficult on the outside and the lowest forms of life overall. More tragic romantic turns will come for Gary because he's so insecure.

Gary continues to blow it with Karen. At the cafeteria, He sees Karen, but instead of making a move, he blows it again by asking David to get the information on her. WRONG! That was another opportunity for HIM to make a move. Insecure about his feelings, Gary then decides to use passive aggressive tactics to approach Karen, deflating her moped and offering her a ride. In the car he makes fun of her name instead of talking to her. MISTAKE! When Gary asks Karen timidly if she has a girlfriend, Karen says no, even though she admits to seeing Rick at David's party. To a normal guy that would have been a RED FLAG! At the Party Gary runs into Rose, another ugly woman attracted to him.

Delivering Pizzas Gary a customer makes a move on him, but instead of scoring, he invites David and Rick over. The customer is also ugly and old, another metaphor for lowlife women being attracted to Nice guys. Gary's passive insecurity costs him another opportunity while confident David and Rick score easily. While it's funny that David gets beat up by the husband, the main point is that Gary missed another opportunity at sex.

When Rick and Karen's relationship intensifies, Gary plays passive aggressive again refusing to give Rick the key to his grandmother's house. When Rick calls Gary on his insecurity Gary tells his friends he's been seeing a Redhead. This prostitute is ugly, old, and nasty, the lowest of the lowlife women Gary experiences. This is one of the best scenes in the movie as the prostitute verbally brutalizes him and his friends. The boys get a venereal disease from the hooker as a result of trusting Gary.

After curing the VD, Rick and Karen get intimate. Gary finds out and can't take it. Soon after Rick dumps Karen finding out she's pregnant. Gary goes into full ""Nice Guy"" mode promising to take care of her. Over Christmas vacation he takes her up to his grandmother's house, spends all his money getting her an abortion and taking care of her even though she didn't ask him to. Passive-aggressive Gary assumes Karen will be his girl because of what HE did, but doesn't hear Karen when she clearly uses the word FRIEND regarding him. Gary goes off in his own dream world buying her a pendant to give her at the birthday party. When he sees her at the party kissing Rick, the brokenhearted Gary is devastated driving off with tears in his eyes and we realize why nice guys finish last.

Looking past the pitiful attempts at comedy, Davidson's film brilliantly shows us why nice guys finish last. Lawrence Monsoon gives a powerful performance capturing Gary's insecurity and passive aggressiveness perfectly. Steve Antin and Diane Franklin are compelling. The soundtrack of 80's classics makes a good movie even better. Highly recommended.",1096502400,17,3917,4.701166180758017

But womanizer popular Rick gets a hold of her first and of course David the fat kid who gets Rick's left over girls. Basically Gary does everything to try and win the affections of her and helps her out but she ends up going back to the sleezy Rick in the end. It's such a frustrating film to watch towards the end in a way because Gary is so blinded to the fact that Karen will only view him as a friend that will never change she will always go for the guy thats does not care about her truly. Gary fails to realize she's not worth the effort he is putting forth for her.  I remeber watching this movie as a kid loving the music great soundtrack.

Unlike every other teen movie from the 80's- this drama/comedy deals with situations that are far more realistic, and in some ways more shocking than your average ""Let's Get Laid"" movie.
The ending is what earns the movie its 5th Star. Somehow, this raunchy screwball teen-flick manages to make the Gary character believable. You suddenly begin to feel for him, and when the story finally builds up to such an unexpected, negative and heartbreaking ending...it reminds you of just how unfair love can be.
A very good movie!",1076284800,4,819,4.899280575539568

1203787,5,B00000F4KD,"The Last American Virgin (1982). Rated ""R"".  Fine soundtrack.  Three young high school boys are trying to make it with girls.  Gary (Lawrence Monoson) is still a virgin.  Just hasn't fell in love yet.  He has a heart.  David (Joe Rubbo) is a virgin and overweight.  Rick (Steve Antin) is the stud.  Rick gets to score, but not Gary and Steve yet.  This film is really about Gary.  It's like love at first sight for him.  Gary falls for Karen (Diane Franklin).  Does things to help her like drive her to school, so she won't be late.  However, at a party later, Karen is Rick's date.  Everyone knows how aggressive Rick is.  It bothers Gary to see Rick making the moves on Karen, the girl he likes.  Gary drinking Jack Daniel's doesn't help the situation either.  Still friends, Gary, David and Rick still pal around together through Gary's quest to finally do it just once.  Many funny hi-jinxes happen along the way (similar to ""Porky's "" films).  Then the movie takes a dark turn and becomes serious.  I was young when I saw this film and the ending tore me up.  I was crying.  Something got to me and the message of this film was point well taken.  This film is a comedy but, boy, it tells real-life.  Some teenage boys are like the character ""Rick"", but some teenage boys are like ""Gary"".  Yes, Gary is sensitive and has a heart but most ""Rick's"" don't.  Gary is a man.  My opinion: Losing one's virginity is something that should not be forced.  To wait until your wedding day or the age of 18 would be something more special and more private that way.  ""Gary"" had the right feelings.  He did the right thing as a friend.  But his feelings went overboard a bit.  However, Karen and Rick were definatly in the wrong.  Not grown up at all.

Note: If you would like to see Steve Antin, in character, get his up-comings, they get him good in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Goonies-25th-Anniversary-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B003XM70B4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Goonies (25th Anniversary Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;(1985).

1203788,3,B00000F4KD,"The best I can say about this movie is that it is wildly uneven.  On one hand, ""The Last American Virgin"" gets so many things right about the (male) teenage experience.  Obviously the preoccupation with sex and virginity take center stage, but also the lame attempts at looking cool in front of girls and the hopelessly misguided pining/brooding when someone else gets the girl are right on the mark.
By way of example, compare this to films like John Hughes' ""Pretty in Pink"", where the character Duckie engages in pretty much the same futile behaviors.  In that film, Duckie's actions are romanticized, glorified, and heck, he's practically canonized by Hughes.  In this film however, these actions are portrayed with brutal honesty and they appear just as they do in real life--awkward and lame.  And just as in real life, Gary doesn't end up with the girl because of them. The much-discussed ending is painfully honest.  Unlike Hollywood, guys like Gary generally do not end up with the beautiful girl.
On the other hand, the movie's negatives are almost to numerous to list, but here's a few:  The many ""Porky's"" type antics are simply not very funny (rather problematic considering it is a comedy).  The acting is at times horrible (making puppy dog eyes and jutting out your lower lip every other scene is not typically considered acting).  Many of the situations are ridiculously contrived (the pizza delivery to a nymphomaniac, the late grandmother's vacant house conveniently available as a love shack / post-abortion care facility).
But the worst thing about the movie is the abuse of the otherwise excellent soundtrack in lieu of a script.  We've all seen the hackneyed music montage scene where a great song plays over a whirlwind of events to show bonding, passsage of time, etc.  It's always a cheap and easy trick to avoid writing an otherwise difficult bit of dialogue.  Well here, it's not so much the music montage scene, but an outright substitution of script writing with song lyrics.  How many times do we really need to see Gary driving around doe-eyed, lower-lip trembling while in the background Quincy Jones (or is it James Ingram) blares ""I did my best, but i guess my best wasn't good enough..."" ?
All in all, the movie is worth seeing.  There are quite a few shortcomings, but it does feel more like real life than anything of the ""Breakfast Club"" variety of teenage films.",1072137600,9,2402,4.855392156862745
1203789,5,B00000F4KD,"I'm so thrilled to see that The Last American Virgin is FINALLY released on DVD. I ordered it immediately and am very pleased. The picture quality on the DVD is nothing short of outstanding and the sound quality equally great. I'm so used to seeing my grainy VHS version of this movie it is almost like seeing an entirely different movie!
The movie centers around Gary who is in love with Karen. Gary's character is so genuine- it is easy to relate to him and his feelings toward Karen. Last American Virgin does not have the typical happy ending that most teen flicks of the 80s had. The ending is realistic and very heart wrenching. This is in no way your average 80s teen movie. The issues covered in Last American Virgin can be applied to any time frame - yes, even today!
The Last American Virgin also has a great soundtrack with such artists as the Cars, Commodores, Devo, Journey, REO Speedwagon and Oingo Boingo!
It was definately worth the wait to finally see this movie get it's deserved treatment by being released on DVD. My only gripe is maybe a few more extras would have been nice. Maybe an interview with some of the cast members or some cut scenes.
Overall this movie is a great buy! 5 stars",1071619200,5,1208,4.470588235294118
1203875,5,B00000F4KD,"For most of this movie, it is a basic 80's teeny-bopper skin flick (for which the 1980s were so famous!).  As I went to high school during the 80s I saw plenty of these types of movies, which made it rather nostalgic.
To be sure, the film has a healthy dose of beautiful women.  And, as is the case with so many 80s movies of this genre, most of them remove their clothes.  Nothing surprising so far, except that the girl on the cover appears nowhere in the movie.
That said, this one had an unexpected twist.  For the last 20 minutes or so, the film crosses over to the dark side and is anything like so many other 80s movies such as HARDBODIES, LOOSE SCREWS, REVENGE OF THE NERDS, etc.  I had a faint feeling that the story was going to have an unhappy ending, but was rather surprised when I found that my premonition was correct.
In short, this is one of the most realistic pseudo-romantic comedies I've ever seen in my life.  I could relate so well to the main character that I actually felt physically wounded, seeing what he had to endure.
The old adage that ""Nice guys finish last"" is something that almost no women believe, but every guy knows is true.  The nice guys know it, just like the narcissistic fellows.  While women traditionally deny the veracity of the tenet, selfish guys instead encourage nice guys to be more self-centered and egotistical.  To we guys, no matter who or what we are, there is no mystery that the adage is dead-on.
All of these factors make this a worthwhile movie to watch.  To my fellow nice-guys out there, this one is for US!  Watch it, feel it & remember the times in your life when you felt just like the persona in the film.",1066521600,4,1670,4.354838709677419
1203876,4,B00000F4KD,"This is the film that no one saw in theaters when it first came out, but everyone loved when they caught it on cable years later. It's the ultimate cult classic. The film was marketed like a Porky's type flick, but what we got was a lot more than we imagined for a low-budget film, starring a bunch of unknowns: a heartfelt, meaningful, and brutally honest look at teen angst and heartbreak.
This is the film that should've made Lawrence Monoson a major star. He plays the lead, Gary, who is the most vulnerable, likable, and sweetest male character of the '80's teen genre. His two best friends, Rick and David always want to get laid, but Gary would rather wait to lose his virginity to someone he loves.
He falls in love with the new girl in school, Karen, who rejects him for his chiseled, misogynistic best friend, Rick. No matter how hard Gary tries to win over Karen, he cannot get her to budge. He takes this personally as if there's some awful character flaw he possesses, and tries harder. He is so figuratively and literally blinded by love and her beauty that he cannot see her for what she is: a totally superficial, ungrateful, and manipulative ice princess. He never stops to consider, even once, that Karen is the one with the problem, not him.
The film shows plenty of sex, but not just for the hell of it. It shows the consequences that arose from sexual irresponsibility in the early '80's, such as crabs (scenes surrounding this that could've been tasteless, but were downright hilarious) and abortion.
When Rick finds out Karen's pregnant, he no longer wants anything to do with her and abandons her to deal with the problem by herself while he goes on a ski trip with his friends and already, on the way to the slopes, is shacking up with some other girl.
Gary gets up the money for Karen's abortion, allows her to recover at his grandmother's house, and waits on her hand and foot. This could've been the perfect opportunity for Gary to take advantage of Karen (It's just the two of them), but he's not like that. He even pulls her shirt down over her midriff when she's sleeping (It had been hiked up when she was reading a magazine). Gary professes his love to her, they kiss, all is good & then...
BAM! It's the infamous ending that everyone whines about. It's also the most realistic, shocking, and original ending you'll ever see in an '80's teen flick. She's back in the arms of Rick, the guy who cheated on her with a prostitute, a nympho, and the girl on the ski trip. He never really loved her or cared about her and just pretended to in order to take her virginity. Then he tells her to ""Get the f@#$ out"" and ""You're embarassing the s@#% out of me. Split!"" when she tells him she's pregnant.
What's so disturbing and stomach-churning about this ending is that after how awful he treated her, she still goes back to him. This also brings up the age-old question ""Why do women always fall for the a@#holes?"" Karen's self-esteem and psychological stability are seriously lacking if she's willing to put up with Rick. This film should be shown not only in every film class, but every women's studies class, as well.
We've been conditioned to expect the happy Hollywood ending at the end of every film and when we don't get it, we're outraged. But I personally get outraged by the happy endings that are fake, unrealistic, and suddenly make the mean people nice. LAV is uncompromising in its characters. Karen's callous and the film sees to it that she's callous to the bitter end. Besides, did you really want Gary ending up with her? He could do so much better.
Like I said, Lawrence Monoson does a great job in the film. He's a master at facial expressions (e.g. his slack-jawed gaze when he sees Karen for the very first time and his desperate, teary-eyed look from the burning of the crabs). He's completely at ease in front of the camera. He can transform a bright smile to a look of horror or a hearfelt look into tears and then crying at the drop of a hat. It's amazing to watch and extremely impressive for a young person in their very first film.
I'm very surprised that some of the most well-known film critics like Leonard Maltin and Roger Ebert didn't find this film important enough to even review.
What's refreshing about LAV is that Gary and David don't praise Rick for getting so much action with the women. David looks bored by it and Gary looks overwhelmed and disturbed by his behavior in such scenes.
The film, of course, is not perfect. The acting is bad in a couple of scenes and in a few scenes it magically  and inexplicably turns from day to night and vice-versa.
The soundtrack is great and extremely hard to find. Sometimes you can find a burned copy of it on ebay for around $20 or more and DON'T, I repeat, DON'T purchase the film on VHS. The cameraman overexposed the film and in too many of the scenes, the light reflects off the characters, giving them a halo effect, and thus makes the picture quality look blurry.
The trailer is kind of odd at the end of the DVD. It contains a lot of scenes that weren't even in the film. Strange.",1065657600,12,5095,4.490301724137931

How did I miss it? I guess it had something to do with the fact that I was 7 years old when the film came out, But on the other hand ""FAST TIMES"" came out at the same time and it was all over the place. Perhaps this film was ignored due to ""FAST TIMES"" advertising tactics. When in fact this film is better.

1203878,4,B00000F4KD,"I remember seeing this on cable back in the mid eighties, and decided to pick it up.  This movie is pretty reminiscence of 80's teen sex comedies, except it has a little more substance, and a lot more heart.
The movie follows three high school friends, the good looking yet morally vacant girl magnet, the average guy, and the fat guy and their various exploits in trying to get laid.  That's how the movie starts, but goes off in a different direction later on.  Gary, the average guy, falls for the pretty new girl in school, but she only has eyes for Rick, the good-looking guy of the group.  Rick, being who he is, takes advantage of this affection to get what he wants.  The serious subject matter at the end of the movie conflicted with the lighthearted nature presented at the beginning, but it worked for me.  I liked how David, the fat kid, wasn't portrayed as a doofus but as one of the guys who just happened to be fat.  He seemed to get as much action as the others, despite the fact that he was not as appealing as his friends.
The characters felt realistic, as I knew people like these three guys in high school, and I think everyone could relate to what Gary was going through, having such affections for someone and not having those affections reciprocated.  I really liked how the movie ended, as it was really touching.  The music also fit really well in with some of the scenes, although some of it seemed a little too obvious for the scene.  I noticed some of the songs got used more than once, but I let that slide.
A lot of comparisons between this movie and Fast Times at Ridgemont High can be made.  I think the pacing of the story was a little better in Fast Times giving the edge for better movie, but this one certainly holds its' own.
The one scene that made me squirm was when the boys went to that sleazy hooker.  Each of the boys taking their turns, the hooker deriding them and being all nasty as she was and the end results is really a good deterrent for not engaging in that type of practice.
Copious amounts of nudity, a good amount of humor, and engaging characters make this one of the better types of movies within the genre.",1062547200,6,2163,4.353233830845771
1203879,4,B00000F4KD,"The Last American Virgin stands out as one of the better teen movies of the 80's. Or, possibly, two of the better teen movies of the 80's. On one hand, it's a fun, goofy, T&A teen movie, typical of the early 80's. On the other hand, it's a poignant teen drama, with one of the best, most realistic and heart-rending endings of any teen movie out there. While I enjoy both aspects of the movie, the switch from comedy to drama is rather harsh. It leaves you wishing they'd blended the two elements a little better, and had maybe focused in on the dramatic side of the movie a little more. I picked this up for nostalgia's sake, but was pleased to find that it still held up after so many years.
One thing that has to be mentioned when talking about The Last American Virgin is the soundtrack. This has one of the greatest 80's soundtracks of all time, featuring songs by U2, the Police, Journey, Devo, the Commodores and plenty of others.

So let me get to the point. THE SOUNDTRACK HAS BEEN ALTERED!
They deleated ""Love Action"" by The Human League and put in for the second time in the soundtrack ""whip it"", why would they do such a thing to an otherwise great soundtrack i'll never know,I guess i'm just a freak. I know my wife won't notice it.

1203881,3,B00000F4KD,"I bought this movie on VHS as teenager in the late 80's.  My attitude towards the plethora of raunchy teen comedies has changed quite a bit since then.  I'm tending to like some of the more recent adaptations of the genre like American Pie, which unlike many of their early 80'counterparts have genuinely likeabe and well drawn young characters, particularly female characters, and real heart. A few favorites like Fast Times' and even to some degree the Porky's films share those characteristics, but many of the knockoffs come off in retrospect as pure exploitation and shlock.  Last American Virgin straddles the line between the two extremes for much of its first hour or so, skirting between banal and often tasteless scenarios as the boys desperately scheme to ""lose IT"", and low key teen romance story.  Serious turns of events occur, the characters deal with them in ways that feel honest emotionally and believable, and the film becomes remarkably poignent for what it is.  At the time of course I was one of those boys who could relate instantly to the Nice Guy character, seemingly always losing the girl to the arrogant jock, or at least the more confident male.  As an adult looing back on the attitudes of the film, there is a detectable undercurrent of self pity in the writing, not to mention a whiff of misogyny in it's point of view - if this film were to be remade I'm sure the female characters would be treated a little kinder by the filmmakers, at least be better drawn.  Diane Franklin's (the adorable Monique from ""Better Off Dead"" - yes, I was in love with her too) character could be more sympathetic, that is she could be viewed more sympathetically than she comes off here a callow heartbreaker.  All in all, ""The Last American Virgin"" remains a memorable, better than average entry in the pre-John Hughes teen sex genre, and should appeal to the current teen generation on its DVD rerelease.
Which brings me to the issue of the package.  The girl lounging poolside in a red bikini on the cover appears nowhere in this movie as far as I can recall. She must be plucked right out of the current crop of Buffy - WB types, slapped onto the cover so that the younger ""American Pie"" crowd will not know they are holding a twenty year old film.",1059696000,4,2266,4.645

MGM/UA has finally come to their senses and The Last American Virgin on DVD is now here. The Last American Virgin is the story of three high school friends who come of age and learn about life while trying to live the life of every other teenage kid. Filmed in 1982 the main character Gary, played by Lawrence Monoson, is still a virgin and tries to keep that little known secret from his two friends Rick and David. He soon falls in love with the new girl in school but is broken-hearted when his womanizing friend Rick begins dating her first. In the midst of this storyline the trio of friends fall into all sorts of mischief trying to 'get laid'. Though the storyline is interesting and keeps your attention, it's the movie soundtrack that really puts you over the edge. Groups such as Devo, The Waitresses, Tommy Tutone, U2, The Police, and The Cars give the movie the perfect 80s soundtrack. Audiences are able to see the movie trailer as a bonus feature to the DVD also. One good suggestion to give MGM though would have been to follow the same-day release of 'Valley Girl' DVD example of putting a few of the great song artist videos on the DVD as well or an audio commentary.

1203940,5,B00000F4KD,"You may have thought that ""The Last American Virgin"" would be just another movie about randy kids hoping to grow up too fast. If you saw this film in the theaters or on HBO, your opinion was surely changed. Browse these heartfelt positive reviews, then note the price that this hard-to-find video is fetching. People are pining to have this movie released on DVD. It's because ""The Last American Virgin"" is the rare Hollywood release that made a deep impact on anyone who watched it. It starts with with the hijinks of three guys in high school who want to get laid: The Nice Guy, The Selfish Romeo, and The Chubby Clown. And there are some big laughs in store. I especially liked the gag where they convince some naive girls that they have cocaine, and try to fool them with Sugar Twin! Some of their antics are downright silly, but it only makes things more interesting, once the serious storyline begins to play out. This happens when a new girl (played by Diane Franklin, who became imbedded in the psyche of the young male of the 80s) moves to town. The Nice Guy falls for her, even as she falls for The Romeo. Even back in 1982, Hollywood endings were all that any moviegoer could expect. What we got in this picture, was nothing but a shock!
In the theater where I first saw the movie, the ending got an audible gasp of horror out of the audience. And nothing happened that would gross anyone out... The filmmaker simply let the truth be shown, and after all the frivolity of the film's first hour, it hit with the impact of an 80-pound anchor dropped from a ten-story window! As The Nice Guy drove off into the night with tears rolling down his face, and as the credits rolled, I remember hearing one girl in the theater call out, ""That's messed up!"" What was it about this movie, that made it so troubling, and yet so loved? One reviewer said this movie was the ultimate Guy movie; another said it's the last movie on Earth to see with a date. But this movie touched gals and guys. Its sudden and stunning dose of reality was a real wake-up call. For me, it was the whole Nice Guy syndrome: I've cried those same tears. But this movie has something for anyone who has felt the pain of going about Love all wrong. And I think some people (who had forgotten some of what it was like, to be the Nice One who was made a fool; or the Selfish One who hurt someone innocent; or the Shallow One who threw away a good chance at love) were made to remember, and I think it hurt them and made them uncomfortable in a big way. ""The Last American Virgin"" was unique for its times: deliriously funny, brutally honest, and, ultimately, very sobering. This well-acted story deserves to be showcased on DVD. And, yes, it has a ""killer"" soundtrack!",1052784000,115,2739,4.41501976284585
1203941,4,B00000F4KD,"In the first film class I ever taught I screened ""The Last American Virgin"" and learned the valuable lesson that showing a movie that inflames viewers is always going to be productive to class discussion. What my students found so offensive was the idea that there were boys in this country that were taking girls to see this film. That was probably a bit far fetched simply because this 1982 film would be one of the worst date movies ever made; watch this film and imagine that you are a sixteen year old girl on a date seeing this film and think about what thoughts about boys in general it inspires.
That is not to say that this film written and directed by Boaz Davidson is not without value. The story starts off as another one of those films where three friends, nice guy Gary (Lawrence Monoson), study Rick (Steve Antin), and fat guy David (Joe Rubbo) are interesting in having sex. Towards this end they pick up some girls with promises of cocaine (it is really Sweet 'n' Low), visit an overly amorous woman whose boyfriend comes home early, and finally go to a prostitute who gives them venereal disease. What I found fascinating about this film was what ""lessons"" it taught its viewers; for example, did you know that ""crabs"" can be cured by the chlorine in a swimming pool?
But then the film turns out to be about a love triangle. Gary loves Karen (Diane Franklin), pure and chaste from afar. Of course, Karen only has eyes for Rick. That is until she discovers she is pregnant and Rick dumps her. That is when ""The Last American Virgin"" becomes an unforgettable adolescent horror story and offers one of the most brutal endings you have ever seen in a teenager sex flick. This particular plot line will remind you of one of the plots in ""Fast Time at Ridgemont High,"" but Davidson is not going for anything remotely like a happy ending, even short term.
My only serious complaint with this film is that the comic excesses of the first two-thirds of the film make the ending seem like a radical shift (although in terms of qualitative form it certainly sets up the ending for ultimate shock value). The ends may well justify the means, but as much as I admire the brutal honesty of the film's conclusion I still find the transition a bit jarring. ""The Last American Virgin"" is an unforgettable film in an often forgettable genre of American cinema.",1049241600,41,2360,4.568396226415095

The effect pulls the rug out from under the viewer leaving he/she with much to contemplate.

And then it happens.  The new girl comes riding into town on her moped and one of our heroes falls for her immediately.  Let the zany games begin.

1204193,4,B00000F4KD,"Okay, you see the title -- The Last American Virgin.  Then you see the stars -- names not known for doing quality work (with the exception, perhaps of Steve Antin).  The topper -- this is a Cannon film!  Though no longer active, Cannon was perhaps the leading schlock studio of the '80s.  The Cannon imprint can usually be relied on as an imprint of subpar quality.  Therefore, this can't be one of those most honest and revealing portraits of adolescence ever made, can it?  Somehow, it is.
The plot is familiar.  Lawrence Monoson (a talented actor who unfortunately, looks like an actual human being as opposed to a magazine cover and has never had the career he deserves) is an awkward teenager who spends most of his film, along with the standard fat friend and the standard slick friend, trying to find someone -- anyone! -- to deflower him.  And while he finds himself confronted with a motely crew of comical possibilities (a nympho with a crazed husband, a disturbingly vulgar hooker that is quite a depature from the usual Hollywood presentation of streetwalkers), he develops a painfully unrequited crush on Diane Franklin (one of my favorite actresses from the '80s who seems to have disappeared) while Franklin has eyes only for Antin.  Eventually, all friendships are tested, Monoson proves himself to be a good human being if not a stud, and the film wraps up with a bittersweet, unexpected, but all too logical conclusion that will leave more than one viewer with tears in his eyes.  Its that type of movie, despite all appearances to the contrary.
The film works because the script, while playing up the stereotypes associated with teen movies, is also filled with perceptive, true-to-life details that brings an edge of reality to the hi-jinks on screen.  Sometimes, the film admits, things don't work out the way they should.  Its a heartbreaking realization but it will also bring a strange sort of comfort to anyone watching.  We've all been through the emotions shown in this film and there's something comforting in the realization.
Which shouldn't make you think this film is some sort of low budget therapy session.  Its also a very funny comedy.  Most importantly, its one of the best acted teen ensemble films I've ever seen.  You believed all of these characters and, even with a vainly shallow character like Antin, you don't dislike them.  They're all human.
As well, this movie has one of the best soundtracks of the early '80s -- something that even people who dislike the film seem to agree on.  My personal favorite musical moment is U2 singing ""I will follow..."" while Monoson desperately tries to raise some money.  Its a powerful, poignant moment.  (I've also read that this was the first use of U2's music on a film soundtrack though I can't guarantee that truth of that statement.)
In the end, a film that everyone should take a chance on.",1001376000,7,2877,4.808943089430894

7906990,5,B00000F4KD,"One of my all time favorites....dare I say in some ways better than Fast Times at Ridgemont High albeit lesser known. I think the sensitivity of the characters (some) and the diversion from standard teenage sex romp type movies make this a unique characterization of the early 80's - and more real. Also, IMO, a much better soundtrack and use of music than Fast Times. Not that those were the only two that I could compare, but having been in released around the same time and with Fast Times being so well known, I thought if someone were reading this they would've most likely have seen Fast Times and may wonder how they compare.

I won't bother with direct plot and character points here, as others have. I will say the theme in LAV is just a bit deeper than Fast Times and some others that came after. Or rather I think it flows nicely between hilarious and poignant. There are some typical funny and even horribly uncomfortable but funny scenes, but also an exploration of young love and heartbreak. Some reviewers seemed to be confused by this whereas I was not. I don't think a movie has to stick to one line, funny or sad....because after all, that is not real life. Real life can be (and often is) light and fun one moment, and sad or depressing the next. And I personally thought LAV realistic and enjoyable for this reason.

I purchased this import version specifically because there are extras not offered on either the American Region 1 DVD or Blu Ray versions. The extras are interviews with Lawrence Monoson, Diane Franklin, the director and the DP. They are rather lengthy and insightful interviews and being a long time fan of the movie I was interested in their point of view and memories.

***Again, this is a Region 2 or B. It requires a region free DVD or Blu Ray player. I purchased mine, a Sony here on Amazon not long ago and it is great. From my understanding, region free players are very difficult to find in actual stores in the U.S., and none in my area in stores such as Best Buy so I'm thankful for Amazon carrying them and foreign DVD and Blu Ray titles as well.

If you were a teenager then and want a trip back to the early 80's for the fashion, music, and teenage state of mind then I highly recommend LAV. For me, it puts me back in that frame of mind really more than any of the other movies from that time I can think of. Maybe because I had a friend who also delivered pizzas...maybe because I have been the Gary character and lost a crush to another....maybe because I've also been Karen and had to choose between the bad boy and the sweet guy...or maybe because I remember blissfully fun evenings out driving around and house parties as depicted in the movie. Regardless, I've been involved in (or known of) most every single scenario and can relate to the ups and downs.  And after all....isn't being able to feel for and relate to characters what pulls us in and makes a great movie? I believe it is.

No teenagers here on Facebook or cell phones ... just kids dealing with growing up and finding their way all wrapped in a time capsule of hair, great music, and the ignorant bliss of youth with a dash of reality. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this movie.",1496448000,,3206,4.4438775510204085
