On the good side, the transfers of audio and sound are good. The aspect ratios are the same as the theatrical release ratios and the run times are close to the original. Also, for around $20-30 Aus the price was not too bad. There are no extras but I'm not a huge fan of extras so didn't deduct points for that.

On the bad side - the box description said French and English audio plus subtitles so was expecting to get the option of the original French audio or dubbed English for each feature film. Not so! ""The Gypsy"" only has the dubbed English soundtrack and no subtitles for deaf or hearing impaired (The lack of subtitles for hearing impaired is a Studio Canal specialty!). This was disappointing as I wanted this movie with the original French audio. The remaining 2 movies only had the French audio available (not too bad) with the option of English subtitles. ""Choice of Arms"" had subtitles in horrible yellow but the subs in ""The Professional""  are in the more agreeable white. Go figure!

So some disappointment with this release that, with a few changes, could have been 5 stars. As it is, it gets 4.",1372550400,,1705,5.422641509433962
