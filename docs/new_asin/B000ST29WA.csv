8206800,5,B000ST29WA,"If you want to understand the Russian character, you must watch this cinematographic masterpiece! This film on the hero of the Civil War is action-filled, human and profound.",1389225600,,174,5.25
8206801,5,B000ST29WA,"Supposedly Stalin's favorite film. A leader of the 1917 Revolution fights the Monarchists. Well made for the time. Total commie propaganda, do not expect balance, but useful from the standpoint of seeing it to understand what kind of image the Stalinists were putting on the 1917 Revolution and its 'heroes' ... for the consumption of the masses who had no source of media outside the grips of the communist party in the USSR.",1359936000,3,426,4.8493150684931505
8206802,5,B000ST29WA,"what you are going to warch. Regard this movie as a collectible, otherwise, you'll be disappointed. There is not much truth from the point of view of a historian, but it's a masterpiece.",1359158400,2,186,4.666666666666667
8206803,5,B000ST29WA,"Chapayev is very well produced, considering being made in 1934. I would argue that it is not very ""political"" in nature; it really contains the bare minimum of propaganda for being made in the run-up to Stalin's great purge. Example: Chapayev reveals the idiocy of the system when he's asked ""are you for the communists, or the bolsheviks?""; he stumbles and looks confusingly at the commissar, then answers in the BS-style of George W. Bush to a cheering home-crowd.

One roots for Chapayev and his band just as would be the case in a Hollywood wild-west movie of some outnumbered US cavalry troops fighting  against indians. The movie appeals to a sense of chivalry; the red army soldiers are reprimanded for stealing from the peasants, the white POW is released to aid his wounded brother, etc. Despite harsher methods used behind the scenes in the USSR, the aspects of this movie leading to its popularity are those that transcend politics and history. Highly recommended.",1318464000,4,975,4.939024390243903
