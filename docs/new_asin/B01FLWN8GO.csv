8761086,3,B01FLWN8GO,"I did not realize when I bought this that it was not in English so had to buy another version in its original language.  It's an odd, and oddly mesmerizing film with some very fine acting.  You're left with more questions than not.  But the storyline is so odd that no answers seems to be the right way for the film to be.  Peter O'Toole is always good and can dominate a scene like no other.  And a very young Colin Firth was OK.  He hadn't yet acquired the screen persona we have become used to.",1481328000,,497,4.125
