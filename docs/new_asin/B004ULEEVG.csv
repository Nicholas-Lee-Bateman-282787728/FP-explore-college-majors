8441715,3,B004ULEEVG,"Union busting was a popular topic in the 1950s, and no film did that better that On the Waterfront (1954). This is a much less stellar version.

Dick Foran (1910-79) stars as an honest Union President framed for murder. Foran has the face that everyone remembers. He was a popular singing cowboy in the 30s who went on to play in more than 100 films, usually as the second male lead. He worked with Bogart in The Petrified Forest (1936), with Cagney in The Fighting 69th (1940) but more often with good friend John Wayne in films like Fort Apache (1948) and Donovans Reef (1963). In the 60s he transitioned to TV.

Brian Keith (1921-97) has the lead but he doesnt appear until well into the film, playing an ambitious District Attorney. Keith was busy on TV and as a second male lead in films like  Arrowhead (1953) and The Violent Men (1955) - this was his first film starring role. He went on to star in the best damn TV western ever  - The Westerner(1960), which lasted a mere 13 episodes and was directed by Sam Peckinpah  When The Westerner was cancelled,  Keith  was offered the starring role in The Deadly Companions (Peckinpah directed).

The same year Keith would go on to co-star with Maureen OHara in The Parent Trap and their chemistry in The Deadly Companions is probably a result of this collaboration. Keith would make dozens of films, including Nevada Smith (1966), The McKenzie Break (1970), and my personal favorite as Teddy Roosevelt in The Wind and the Lion (1975). He would continue making films throughout his career, but he moved back and forth to TV where he landed the role as Uncle Bill in Family Affair (1966-71) where he earned 3 Emmy nominations.

Sexy Beverly Garland (1926-2008) is best known as Fred McMurrays wife from My 3 Sons (1969-72) and Kate Jacksons mother from Scarecrow and Mrs. King (1983-7), but she got a lot of work in the early 50s in Roger Corman films. She was one of the first actors to move seamlessly from TV to films and the very first actress to portray a woman detective on TV. Garland plays Forans girlfriend.

The film has dozens of well-known character actors, including Elisha Cook Jr. (the gunsill from Maltese Falcon), John Hamilton (Perry White from TVs Superman) and big Douglas Kennedy (Steve Donovan, Western Marshall).

Director Sidney Salkow (1909-2000) made dozens of films in the 30s and 40s and then transitioned to TV in the 50s. This film shows a lot of the TV influence, including the voice-over.

The top grossing films in 1957 were Bridge on the River Kwai, Peyton Place, Sayonara, Old Yeller, and Raintree County. The big Oscar winners were Kwai (Picture, Director, Actor) and Sayonara (Actor, Supporting Actress). Other notable films released that year include Three Faces of Eve, Pal Joey,  Funny Face, and Witness for the Prosecution

Its not a bad film, and it moves pretty quickly. Theres a subplot about B-girls and some forensic work with a tape recorder, but there is nothing special here.",1488672000,,2973,4.736434108527132
