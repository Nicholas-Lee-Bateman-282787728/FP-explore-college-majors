8665826,5,B00LH2T2K4,"This NEVER WANTING IT TO END beautiful drama portrays all sorts of different forms of greed, jealousy, humor, cuteness and oodles of heart felt love - stolen kisses of a beautiful smitten prince, (sigh) warm stunning chemistry and profound love the couple have for each other - all so easy on the heart.
The deaf mute has a smile to light up the universe and the dimpled little cutie pie child actor embraces you with all sorts of cute and cuddly. Truly one of the BEST dramas I have ever watched.  The acting is superb and I salute the writers and directors - WELL DONE.  Please produce more dramas like this!  It really is a truly beautiful drama that will caress your soul leaving you filled with a warm fuzzy tenderness that you never want it to leave you - a real JOY to watch.  Such a pity it was not longer.",1466553600,,814,4.3355263157894735
8665827,5,B00LH2T2K4,"I watch A LOT of Korean dramas, mostly on Drama Fever, but this one was not available on their site, so I bought it on Amazon.  So glad I did.  It is an excellent drama with a beautiful story and plenty of palace intrigue and plot twists.  The acting is sincere and elegant, and the costumes and set designs are gorgeous.  There are 108 episodes, but they are short, so the drama runs about 54 hours total.  It is in my top five favorite historical Korean dramas.

I see as I am writing this that it is no longer available on Amazon which is a shame.  It is good enough to hunt down and buy it if you can.  Or, check with Drama Fever - they may be able to tell you if or when they plan to make it available to stream.",1456099200,,717,3.965034965034965
8665828,5,B00LH2T2K4,Excellent Korean Drama. Always love the historic period dramas and this is one of the best. Good subtitles that do not have to be set for every episode or disc. High quality DVD and good story line. This is one of those that is over before you want it to be. My only problem was that the episodes were only 30 minutes long and go by way too fast. Guess that's because the story keeps you on the edge of your seat. You won't be disappointed at all with this Drama.,1426377600,6,463,4.0989010989010985
