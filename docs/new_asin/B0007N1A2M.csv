8528222,1,B0007N1A2M,"This item indicated that it included 3 discs, Wiggle Time/Dance Party/Hoop dee doo, but it really only included 1 disc, dance party.  I paid $21.99 plus shipping for 1 very old dvd!  Not happy!",1204156800,,193,4.647058823529412
8528223,1,B0007N1A2M,I ordered this product and recieved only The Wiggles Dance Party DVD.  I called up customer service and told them that I recieved only one of the videos.  They were very nice and said that they would send me a replacement order at no charge.  When I recieved the second package in the mail it too was just the Wiggles Dance Party DVD.  I noticed that the label on the back was incorrect which is why I kept recieving the wrong DVD.  I told this to customer service hoping that we could get this issue resolved.  On my third shipment I again recieved only The Wiggles Dance Party DVD. I give up!  My sons love the Wiggles and it's just disappointing that they couldn't take the time to fix this for me.,1203292800,,701,4.265151515151516

8528225,5,B0007N1A2M,"We bought the Wiggly Party Pack to tide our daughter over until our first Wiggles DVD purchase arrived from Amazon.  And are we ever glad that we did!  Hoop-De-Doo has become a standard in our house, with even my usually less-than-enthusiastic husband joining in some of the dances.  People who prefer the Lights, Camera, Action! series will probably be most drawn to this disc.

Wiggle Time heralds from the Wiggly World era, and we actually routinely see bits from this DVD when watching that series on Playhouse Disney.  The chapters include not just studio productions, but also live footage---""Five Little Ducks"" is not to be missed! :)  There are also a few extras on the disc, including two shortened episodes of the Lights, Camera, Action! series.

The jewel of the collection, in my opinion, is Dance Party.  This is, from what I understand, the first Wiggles video---and it shows.  But that's what makes it so fun!  The guys are so young in it, and are just brimming with energy; and they haven't become accustomed to television productions yet, which makes it seem more like they're performing for a class of preschoolers than for millions of children around the world.  I'm disappointed that much of this music has fallen out of their repetoire; ""Di Dicky Do Dum"" has become one of my daughter's favourite songs (and mine, as well!)  My only complaints about this disc have nothing to do with the content, and more to do with the fact that its manufacture needs to be updated.  The chapters are quite irregular---meaning, you can't skip back one chapter to replay a song.  This is exascerbated by the fact that there is no disc menu.

Overall, we watch these three discs more than any of the other six we've since accumulated.  This is an especially good starter set for families just beginning to get into the Wiggles!!",1121212800,6,1832,4.786624203821656
