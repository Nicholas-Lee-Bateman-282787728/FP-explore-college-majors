8270999,5,B0018SO3AG,"This is probably one of the best studies about the Bible that I have heard. Most thorough and most in depth. The only other study that would compare is one by Chuck Missler on How We Got The Bible...  and I have to agree with other reviewers.. the title or description is a mistake. It is not a DVD.. it is a CD ~ MP3 and a booklet on how to choose a bible

This Mp3 explores the origin, history, and relevance of the Bible. Pastor Chuck Smith, Dr. Henry Morris, and Dave Hunt discuss the most reliable Bible translations, the basis for our Bible, as well as the inerrancy, sufficiency, and authority of the Scriptures. These subjects are both timely and pertinent for anyone with a serious desire to know more about the validity of the Bible.
 Messages Include:
 Chuck Smith: The Basis for our Bible
 Henry Morris: Defense of the Bible
 Dave Hunt: The Inerrancy of the Word
 Dave Hunt: Sufficiency and Authority of the Word

Also Included: Choosing the Right Bible a compact guide by Dave Rolph and Brian Nixon aiding in selecting the finest Bible translation from a Calvary Chapel perspective.",1440720000,2,1095,4.579487179487179

Title needs to be changed. Don't purchase this if you are expecting to receive video files.",1348617600,,143,4.142857142857143
8271001,4,B0018SO3AG,"This set is made up of MP3 audio files, this is not a video DVD.  Pastor Chuck's message is really good on here.  He gives a lot of great info that not many pastors get into.  Spot on!",1238025600,3,184,3.789473684210526

What great about this CD is it not only includes messages from such smarts as Dr. Henry Morris, Dave Hunt and Chuck Smith, but there's an insert, a little booklet titled, ""Choosing the Right Bible.""  It helps you do just that--choose the right Bible for you!",1237248000,5,310,4.618181818181818
