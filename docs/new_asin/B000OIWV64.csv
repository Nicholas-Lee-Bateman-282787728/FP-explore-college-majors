8185315,5,B000OIWV64,"This is the perfect instruction for a beginning piano student or classically trained student to learn how to play basic blues,rock and pop type of music. No music reading or theory is involved at all. If you can find middle ""C"" and name the white and black keys on the keyboard,you have all the prerequisites necessary to learn from this tape. If you can't find middle""C"" or don't know the notes,you can easily find a diagram on the web and figure it all out in about ten minutes.
 Robert gets you to the level of playing bass patterns and improvising on the blues scale very quickly. If you already know a little about music or play guitar you will pick up this information a lot faster. The tape is about an hour long and has a lot of information packed into it. Highly recommended.",1254960000,,784,4.444444444444445
