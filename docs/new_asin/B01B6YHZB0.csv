8749497,1,B01B6YHZB0,"Overalll, this is a lousy movie full of film from the original King Solomon's Mines, a very outstanding movie.  I definitely WOULD NOT recommend this movie too anyone.. It was a waster of money, especially when there are so many good ones out there",1506470400,,248,4.636363636363637

8749499,4,B01B6YHZB0,"I was very thankful to finally be able to purchase a digital copy of this film.  It has special significance for me, as my father took me and my brother to see it at the local drive-in theatre to see it when it first played the drive-in circuit, and it was the only time that my father took us to expressly to ""see a movie with Dad"".  He was a fine father, but worked hard and had to deal with complications and bills from surgery for a work-related accident years before, so these kinds of opportunities were rare as we were growing up.  It brought back a flood of memories, and I am sure that there were (positive) influences from this movie on me in my formative years that I did not even realize until recently.

Actually a very nice transfer for a DVD, though the print from which the transfer was made does have a few brief lower-quality sections, and some of those may be due to the use of 16mm stock clips, and some from enlargement/ cropping of the camera negative or print which can happen in the case of limited film budgets or unplanned cutting to make it flow.

My only quibble is that it's a ""manufactured on demand"" disc, which means that it's burned on (presumably) dye-based media, rather than the mass produced stamped/ evaporated metal film disc like the normal commercially-produced discs are.  It is possible that a phase-change substrate is used (such as M-Disc), but I doubt it.

Perhaps someday they will issue this in high definition on standard Blu-ray, as recently happened with ""The Wheeler Dealers"" (I had bought the on-demand DVD version of Wheeler Dealers a few years back, then recently noticed that a Blu-ray version was available, which I just ordered).

I am a collector, so I prefer good high definition copies, on normally manufactured discs which are expected to last a lot longer than most burn-on-demand discs.",1497830400,3,1850,4.636085626911315

8749502,2,B01B6YHZB0,It was just another King Solomon's mine and a poor version. Even used segments from the King Solomon's mines with Deborah Kerr and Stewart Granger.,1466035200,5,147,4.92
8749503,3,B01B6YHZB0,"Somewhat of an adventure flick, I thought it was average.  George Montgomery is Harry Quartermain, son of Allan Quatermain, H. Rider Haggard's hero from his 1885 novel ""King Solomon's Mines"".

Rex Ingram and David Farrar are familiar Hollywood actors in this as well.",1460764800,3,267,5.186046511627907
