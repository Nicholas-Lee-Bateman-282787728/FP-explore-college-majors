I had to have it! My grandchildern will love it. It had childern who were loving and brave! and it had bad kids who get their's! And a Spooky guy with a big cat, who helps the kids WIN with the help of a magicical Spooky House. And a great ending.... a little sappy, but sometimes sappy is good!",1218672000,2,460,4.179775280898877
1902764,3,B0000A5A1K,"Although this movie is generally for kids, my five-year-old grandson was a bit frightened by some of this movie.  He was fine when I had him sit on my lap, and told him the boy in the movie was brave just like he was.  His seven-year-old sister was fine with it.  That said, this is a movie the family can enjoy together.  I am not sure any lessons are very clear; maybe that life is more than being a hermit that doesn't like kids.  Of course the little boy in the movie won over the heart of the cold-hearted, bitter magician.  So the magician got his wife back and took in the orphaned boy, typical of all movies like this one.  It isn't a great movie, but fun to watch with the kids.",1203120000,2,687,4.120300751879699
1902765,5,B0000A5A1K,"Our family rented this movie over a year ago. We were disappointed that we could not find it for sale any where. After a year of searching, someone recommended  your website. My 6 year old son was so excited when it came in the mail!!! He never thought he'd be able to watch it whenever he wanted too!!! What a great, wholesome, family movie that everyone can enjoy! Thank You so much.  The Wattenburger Family, Pasco,WA",1201564800,,420,4.5131578947368425
1902766,5,B0000A5A1K,"I found this one while searching for GooseBumps shows for my daughters loved those, I was pleasantly surprised how I got wrapped up in this show, it is not a 'glitzy' as GooseBumps and definatly not a ""spooky"" show like GooseBumps but rather a pleasant alternative. Its low buget (like GooseBumps) but I'd say more closely resembling SandLot or Never Ending Story (of which I only liked the first one). I found myself wanting to stop but couldn't, I just had to see what happened next, but then having a professional magician as a father most likely helped too.

I deffiantly recommend this for anyone looking for 'nicer' story of a different type, not high budget, not real flashy, not an 'on the edge of your seat' type of movie but just a good alround family show, with a few funny parts here and there.

But if your looking for 'Spooky', 'Scary', 'High Budget', something you would pay at a theator to see, then keep looking (but be sure to bookmark it for a later date!)",1152057600,5,975,4.534090909090909
1902767,5,B0000A5A1K,"Produder/Director,William Sachs has crafted a simple storyline and turned it into very charming, funny, and touching tale that is perfect for the whole family.
Ben Kingsley, as Zamboni, ""The Spooky Man"", turns in a masterful performance in concert with the new, natural, and talented Matt Weinberg as Kingsley's young counterpart and eventual cohort.
Encountering the ""bad kids"", ably headed by Mercedes Ruehl,
our young group of heroes, lead by Kingsley and Weinberg, send us on a merry chase with magic illusions and a surprise, touching conclusion which wraps up the adventure in a delightful way.
This is a little classic with a big heart that belongs in everyone's video library. And, for once, the price is quite reasonable (for the DVD).",1069113600,8,744,5.1570247933884295
1902768,5,B0000A5A1K,Spooky House is magical fun for the entire family.  Award winning Ben Kingsley as the 'Great Zamboni' is true to form as is award winning Mercedes Ruehl as the campy 'Boss'.  The kids are adorable.  The music will keep your toes tapping and your kids dancing.  A winner!,1067990400,5,270,4.5625
1902769,5,B0000A5A1K,I thought this was a great family film. Ben Kingsly does a fantastic acting job. The story is very moving and a great view for the children. I would recommend this film to any parent with young kids.,1067558400,5,199,4.2631578947368425

7995917,1,B0000A5A1K,"First off, I am not one to post negative reviews but in this case, I felt the need in hopes of preventing others from making the same mistake I did in buying and watching this mainly based on the many positive reviews posted here (which I really don't understand). This is flat out one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I have watched (and collected) hundreds over the years of all genres. The storyline is haphazzard jumping all over the place for the first half of the movie not even making sense at times, the script/dialogue is awful, the character portrayals (I won't even call it acting) is horrendous, the cinematography and editing is terrible, the ""special effects"" are a joke and even the few bits of music sprinkled in would rather have you sticking needles in your ears. I understand this was made for children and not meant to be Oscar-worthy material but you still have to draw the line somewhere.

Additionally, there are aspects of the film that some parents may not want to subject their children to. Bullying is one of the central themes and is rampant throughout along with the violence that comes with it; the evil ""coughing lady"" when shown, is almost always smoking not one but multiple cigarettes at once (hence her nickname); guns are used threateningly during a standoff in the final scene (though one turns out to be fake) and there are several scenes that may be frightening for younger viewers (it is about a ""spooky house"" after all) but I would expect that due to the afforementioned lack of quality filmmaking, will have most adults laughing.

Though the intentions for this film may have been honorable, the execution is terrible. I watched this with my 9-year old daughter who enjoyed being able to predict what would happen next which made her happy. Of course this is just my personal opinion but I like to think I have a pretty open mind, and don't say you haven't been warned.",1356912000,2,1920,4.644117647058824
7995918,5,B0000A5A1K,"My son loves this movie.  We rented it from the video store and after renting it a half a dozen times, I checked Amazon to buy our own copy.  This is a favorite and is often showed to his friends at sleep overs. It may have a few sceens that some children wouldn't like, but they are so funny that the humor out weighs anything else. My son is now 10 and we have been watching this movie since he was 6.",1224979200,,403,3.902439024390244
