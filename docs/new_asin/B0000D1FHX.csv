1920523,2,B0000D1FHX,Amazon has a bunch of reviews here from a DVD set that contains this film.  I hope this review does not get linked into that set.  I looked this up in the IMDB.  It was made in 1964 and should have been 80 or 81 minutes long.  Amazon says 2006.  And their copy was just over an hour.  The Sci Fi takes a back seat here.  It is really more of a police drama.  The acting was rather good.  But there are some jarring cuts where I suppose some of the film is missing.  I saw it on Prime for free and I got my money's worth.  I don't regret spending the hour watching it.  But once was enough.  I won't be watching it again.,1356739200,12,620,3.864
1920524,4,B0000D1FHX,"The biggest problem this movie has going for it is that it doesn't really fit within any genre particularly comfortably. As all the other reviews have pointed out; it's not really scary at all. So to approach it as a horror or sci-fi movie is to be disappointed. And it's not a mystery since we know what really happens. But as a drama that happens to be about scientists though I think it works quite well. Maybe it's because I do biological research myself but I found this movie quite fascinating. It certainly is more truthful to how science is actually carried out than most movies; either in the 50s or today. Not only is there a blessed absence of bubbling dry ice, there's not even a bubbling flask in site. The idea of injecting glycerol into veins before freezing though, is definitely not recommended! Anyway, and most importantly, for a grade B movie, the acting is actually quite good. And the scenes of what I assume are post-war Germany are fascinating. So while ""Frozen Alive"" isn't by any means a classic, it is quite well worth watching.",1280016000,2,1055,4.617021276595745
1920525,5,B0000D1FHX,A Very Old Movie. The plot was good. The movie good. And the quality was great. This seller has some good quality movies.,1272499200,,121,4.304347826086956
1920526,3,B0000D1FHX,"By today's standards, as far as technical aspects and narrative pace are considered, Frozen Alive is quite mediocre and definitely very much a B movie. However, it has its merits, namely: the basic idea of the story - which I will not give up here - works pretty well. The main actors handle their roles OK. For anyone interested in spaghetti westerns it's nice to see Marianne Koch of The Fistful of Dollars fame in another movie made in the same year as Leone's groundbreaking first western film. Koch is quite good here, in a speaking role - with Leone's film she only had her good looks, as there were hardly any lines to speak for her as Marisol. Veteran actor Mark Stevens does his job very professionally, too. The story would have worked OK as a 30 or 45 minute episode in Alfred Hitchcock Presents TV series. For a feature film it's somewhat too  long,  even though one does see it through without getting bored.",1237075200,2,921,4.542168674698795
1920527,3,B0000D1FHX,"I can't help but think Frozen Alive was a bit disappointing to me.

Basically, the entire plot in the second half of the film builds around one man being froze for a scientific experiment.

What's the first half of the movie about?  Well, not about anything really interesting or scary, that's for sure.  It's about one mans wife who apparently has a severe drinking problem, acting psychotic and extremely jealous of the woman her husband works with.  Eventually this all results in her bringing a gun to the workplace and almost threatening to use it.

The gun eventually gets used, but the thing is- why should I care about that?  I didn't watch this movie to see some kind of detective story.  I watched Frozen Alive to get creepy feelings about a man who freezes himself as part of an experiment, and I was totally disappointed the first half of the movie did nothing to build up to that.  Really, when I say nothing, I mean NOTHING at all.  It was just about a man's crazy wife staggering around with her drinking problem and her cheating ways (she wasn't sure which man she wanted to be with).

Very disappointed in all that stuff.  However, I can't deny the story DID keep me interested, even though it wasn't what I was expecting it to be.  As an older film, it's fun to watch, but wasn't scary by any stretch of the imagination.  Not even the slightest bit creepy for that matter.",1202515200,,1390,4.508
1920528,3,B0000D1FHX,"FROZEN ALIVE is a sci-fi yarn about experiments in cryogenics. The set up is decent, w/ scientists doing their work in the lab while, unbeknownst to them, a drunken / jealous wife gets closer and closer to doing something disastrously stupid. Unfortunately, this movie suffers from it's own long-winded telling of this tale. If it had been about 30 min. shorter, it would have made a great Twilight Zone episode! As it is, it's not a total waste, but seems padded out...",1158278400,3,470,4.7439024390243905
1920529,3,B0000D1FHX,"This isn't what I would call a riveting science fiction thriller.  Sometimes it seems that the film itself is in suspended animation, as it takes forever to get to the real science fiction part of the whole story - namely, the freezing and unfreezing of a human being.

Dr. Frank Overton (Mark Stevens) and Dr. Helen Wieland (Marianne Koch) are pioneers in the art of cryogenic freezing.  They've already managed to put monkeys in suspended animation and bring them back with no ill effects.  The natural next step for them is the freezing of a human being - but, as you can imagine, not everyone is thrilled with that proposition, including the guy holding the money strings.  Dr. Overton ultimately decides that the experiment must be done before the request is officially denied - and he offers up himself as the guinea pig.  The backdrop to all of this is a sort of love triangle involving Helen, Frank, and Joan, Frank's complete lush of a wife.  Actually, let's make it a square because Joan has something going on with another guy, too.  Now, Frank and Helen are just colleagues (although Helen is a little sweet on the guy), but Joan is jealous.  She gets drunk, gets her hands on a gun, and - well, she dies.  It looks like murder, so the police are anxious to talk to her husband - but by then he's snoozing at about 80 degrees below freezing.  There's a nice little moral dilemma for Helen at the very end, which makes the ending a little more interesting than I expected.  Notice I said interesting, not exciting or particularly entertaining.

The main problem with this science fiction film is the fact that it really doesn't look or feel like a science fiction film until the very end.  There's just way too much of Joan's philandering and drunken antics and not enough of machines that go ping.",1132099200,5,1809,4.6125
1920539,4,B0000D1FHX,A decent movie. Not sure of the title though.,1435708800,,45,4.111111111111111
1920540,3,B0000D1FHX,"Almost but not quite sci-fi, definitely not much of a mystery, no horror, just some cut-rate melodrama.........I actually don't know how to classify this oddity.  It begins with an exceedingly boring lecture on low temperature and freezing chimps.  What anyone would want with a frozen chimp  is beyond me.  But apparently it was big business back in 1966 because the scientists who figured out how to do this were given $25,000 each.  Did PETA know about this?  Makes no never mind as they showed nary a frozen chimp.  But they did freeze the star of this effort, Mark Stevens as Dr. Overton (not that you could tell one way or another).  He's saddled with a tart wife who refused to give up her former boyfriend just because she got married.  She gets a little miffed when her husband dares to suggest they have children.  She sulks, pouts, swings with her ex-boyfriend, plays with his gun, and accidentally shoots herself to no ones dismay.  The dopey police think the husband froze himself to evade prosecution.  (So much smarter than jumping bail and running for the hills.)

This movie was just plain weird.",1430092800,,1113,4.7643979057591626

1920542,2,B0000D1FHX,melodramatic piffle paffle which illustrates how soap opera was translated to the silver screen or provide low budget romantic fare for the entertainment starved passion pit 3rd feature.  A good movie for someone having an extra-marital affair!,1423353600,,244,5.594594594594595
1920543,4,B0000D1FHX,I expected to watch a typical 60's movie that would be okay to watch but the plot was actually different in FROZEN ALIVE. It was well-acted and had an interesting ending.,1419724800,,170,4.516129032258065

1920545,3,B0000D1FHX,"Dr. Frank Overton (Mark Stevens) and Dr. Helen Wieland (Marianne Koch) have been experimenting w/ cryogenics. They've been busy freezing chimpanzees and reviving them, unharmed. Obviously, the next step should be a human trial, but this is short-circuited by a meddling superior. Since Overton and Wieland are about to be split up, Overton takes it upon himself to volunteer for the experiment. Unbeknownst to him, the hyper-jealous Mrs. Overton has accidentally shot herself! Now, Frank is frozen, unaware that the police are interested in his possible role in his wife's demise. FROZEN ALIVE is a sci-fi story w/ a heavy subplot concerning Overton's rocky marriage. The tension level is about medium, and the story certainly takes its sweet time developing, but overall, I found it enjoyable enough. This is an early 1960s sci-fi drama, so don't expect any explosions or laser battles...",1412380800,2,889,5.267605633802817

Well maybe not all times as Dr. Overtons drunk and distraught wife occupies a good percentage of the movie.

The doctor goes comatose. His wife is found dispatched and Inspector Prenton (Wolfgang Lukschy) suspects foul play on the part of her husband.

Did he or did he not? Only he and we know the truth.
