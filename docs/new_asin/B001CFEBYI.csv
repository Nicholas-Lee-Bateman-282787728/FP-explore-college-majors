8287418,5,B001CFEBYI,This DVD gives clear instructions and older people as well as children enjoy the results. The presenter is such a good teacher and the origami projects are fun. The first one is simple but others more advanced.  The fortune cookie container may be very useful. This is light hearted and an excellent introduction to the pleasures of origami.  Thoroughly recommended.  The price certainly right.,1340755200,,394,5.125
8287419,5,B001CFEBYI,"I watched this DVD with my 8-year-old son and we did the paper folding right along with the instructor. The designs (for the most part) were straightforward, and the instructor was clear and upbeat and great at explaining directions  clearly, often even creating a story and memory tricks to go with a lot of the examples.

The DVD is broken up into 9 separate segments, most no more than 10 minutes long. You need square paper of just about any size to do the origami.

I highly recommend this DVD.",1231200000,2,499,4.522222222222222
