8735299,5,B0160SUGHC,"I first saw this documentary on Public Television.  It's extremely interesting and very touching even if you don't know anything about judo which I don't.

Keiko Fukuda gave up a normal life for judo.  She understood that if she married in Japan that her husband would not be happy about her having to go out most nights to practice and teach judo.  I don't think she had any regrets until maybe in her much later years when she felt a little lonely.

Fukuda san was given the opportunity to come to America in the 1950's for two years and then later came back to the United States to teach Judo at Mills College.  She eventually became a U.S. citizen.  There was much controversy over Japan's refusal to promote any woman above 5th dan, but eventually Japan relented and she was awarded higher dans.  However, the men who were in that highest dan were promoted one dan higher so that Miss Fukuda was never in the highest Japanese dan with the men.

This documentary is short, but huge in content.",1487808000,,997,4.5251396648044695
8735300,5,B0160SUGHC,What a great documentary on an amazing woman.  This documentary on Shihan Fukuda was so needed.  Women in Judo including Rhonda Rousey can trace their roots to Shihan Fukuda.  The use of interviews sith Shihan and of her performances were very enlightening and informative.  A MUST HAVE FOR ALL JUDOKA.,1475020800,,302,4.98
8735301,5,B0160SUGHC,"Such a wonderful and inspiring movie. The documentary reveals an artistic component of Jun-Ke-Ta, or judo for women which is both culturally fascinating and beautiful in its choreography.",1467763200,2,187,5.714285714285714
8735302,5,B0160SUGHC,"I've seen several viewings of this fascinating documentary. It's story is ever tireless as it shows how cemented some outdated views still are about women. As a martial artist myself, I was enthralled with it all and even shed some tears along the way.",1463184000,,252,4.75
