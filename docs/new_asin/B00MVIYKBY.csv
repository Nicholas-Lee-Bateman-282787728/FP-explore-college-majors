8674892,1,B00MVIYKBY,This movie is the worst. Terrible acting. Couldn't get into it. Also after I rented it it told me that it couldn't play in HD it would play in regular D to prevent buffering.,1468108800,,174,4.147058823529412

8674896,5,B00MVIYKBY,"This movie was so B grade it was ridiculous, action was way over the top and the main star of the movie couldn't kill a fly in real life. As the movie continues it get's depleted and loses track completely, the ending is just pure nonsense. I gave it five stars because it's funny as hell and good for a laugh.",1419638400,3,310,4.098360655737705

8674898,1,B00MVIYKBY,"A horribly acted, poorly written, badly lit waste of someone's time and money. How do these awful things get made?

Originally pawned off as ""Borderlands"" in the UK. Please, stuff cotton candy in your 4 years mouth and have him do his Power Rangers moves for you while imitating Arnold Schwarzenegger lines. Get your Asian neighbor to run around the yard screaming like Amos and Andy after they 'seed a ghost'. Better acting, more realistic fight scenes will be yours.",1415491200,2,468,4.85
