1331195,5,B00003JRAJ,"How can I not enjoy this DVD? It's full of hilarious slapstick. Tom and Jerry has always been known for its really funny slapstick comedy and.....slapstick comedy.

But that's not a bad thing. That led the series to being adored by critics, fans, comedy stars, and directors. Yes, the craze of Tom and Jerry still lives on.

Anyways, this DVD contains tons of the humorous cartoons. No matter what setting the famous duo are in, whether the cartoon is about playing golf, having fun at the beach, or celebrating the Fourth of July, you must be sure to expect the famous slapstick comedy. If you can't enjoy the slapstick, then I have no idea how you will like this collection.

Things that build up upon the slapstick make things even more interesting and very clever. Don't you love it when you hear Tom's screams? That's a major gut-buster, no matter how many times you hear them. I also love it when you suddenly hear Tom or Jerry speak an anonymous voice. For example, in this one episode where Tom tries to impress a female cat, he ends up being chased by the dog, but then he whistles and says ""Come on, boy! Go get it! Come on!"" and then throws the stick that he had in his hands! I immediately cracked up that time.

Overall, you just got to have this DVD.",1302134400,,1264,4.435344827586207

1331202,5,B00003JRAJ,"Tom and Jerry's greatest chases are without a doubt, some of the funnest, funniest, and beloved cartoons that have ever been put out.  And this is a critical observation:  the Fred Quimby productions, I believe all of which are from this time period, are vastly superior in quality, animation, and writing to the Chuck Jones versions of later years.  I can not even watch them, given the incredibly high bar that was set by Mr. Quimby and his colleagues.  Furthermore, it is absolutely wonderful that political correctness was thrown on its head in these 40's animations -- those of you who have seen them will know exactly what I mean by that statement.

A few years ago, I found a 7-DVD set from China (with removable Chinese subtitles) of every Tom & Jerry that was ever released.  There were many, many additional Fred Quimby productions not found on the ""Greatest Chases"" DVD - it would be nice to see a U.S. release of the whole shootin' match one of these days...",1276646400,,970,4.643274853801169

As a 'brown' girl watching Tom & Jerry, I always hated the way the brown lady was portrayed in the cartoons, almost ape like with huge round fingers, a huge body, and very unflattering clothes, while the white lady was small and dainty, and very lady like. I didn't care for the black face themes either. Can you blame me?! When my kids started watching Tom & Jerry, I cringed inside when they first saw those same images. HOWEVER, as my parents did with me, I took the opportunity to explain to my 8 year old what times were like back then and how some people viewed, mocked and humiliated people who look like us on stage, in movies and in cartoons. Right or wrong, politically incorrect or not, it's a part of our (American) history and worth discussing with our children. Just my humble opinion!

It contains older Tom and Jerry videos so that is both good and bad.  It is good because it preserves what I and even my parents remember watching as kids, but isn't the normal for today and is quite violent as Tom and Jerry often is.  There is one episode where Tom is using a gun to try and shoot Jerry and one where he trys to poison him.

1331231,5,B00003JRAJ,"If you're a fan of MGM theatrical cartoons,this item is for you. Tom and Jerry has audiences,young and old,cracking up with their hilarious hijinks. Tom meets a pretty girl cat on the beach in SALT WATER TABBY. Jerry takes interest in the girl cat. The same girl cat is seen in SOLID SERENADE. Tom musically woos her via bass fiddle,disturbing Jerry's sleep. Jerry is automatically bounced out of bed on his face and stomach and the rhythm of the bass keeps bouncing Jerry. Tom impresses another female cat(not a glamourous one,though) wearing a ""zoot suit"" in THE ZOOT CAT. The usually totally silent Jerry speaks one line in the cartoon,""What's cooking,toots?"". Tom spoke in the cartoon also,a little more than Jerry. Tom's suit shrinks to the point where it now fits Jerry! Jerry is off to Manhattan in MOUSE IN MANHATTAN,only to be met with disappointment. Jerry was used to apply shoe polish(he ends up in blackface,a scene never seen on some TV stations including Cartoon Network). He even felt light friction of the heavy New York City traffic. So,he's back home with Tom and again in his hole in the wall. TEE FOR TWO features a lawnmower-shorn Tom and his bee-stung mouth(courtesy of angry,intimidated bees). THE YANKEE DOODLE MOUSE was excellent. If I'm not mistaking,it was at least an Academy Award nominee. Tom is a concert pianist in the Oscar-winning THE CAT CONCERTO. Jerry is asleep inside the grand piano Tom is playing on stage and the striking hammers inside awake Jerry. Jerry,angry with Tom,finishes the performance himself and dons a tuxedo in the final scene with the spotlight shining on him. THE LITTLE ORPHAN,another Academy Award nominee,features Tom,Jerry and Jerry's visiting nephew Nibbles playing Thanksgiving scenes and in the final scene,praying before consuming the Thanksgiving dinner. Nibbles eats all of the turkey like a termite! He appears rotund in the final scene. In KITTY FOILED,there's Tom,Jerry and an unnamed canary riding a train set on the living room floor. In the final scene,Jerry and the canary are happily whistling away in the canary's cage. An excerpt of this cartoon became stock footage for LIFE WITH TOM(not seen on this DVD). JERRY'S DIARY contains stock footage from previous cartoons(released before that one). Tom was so furious about many of the statements Jerry wrote about him in his diary. Jerry comes along only to meet Tom who splatters a pie all over Jerry and his hole in the wall. The other cartoons are awesome. I loved them as a kid over two decades ago.",1173830400,2,2528,4.964622641509434
1331232,5,B00003JRAJ,"Overall the DVD was good and very much appropriate for young children. There are a few concepts (it's the classic T&J cartoons) that may not be appropriate for children, but my son still (3 yrs later) loves to watch Tom & Jerry. This old DVD (old cartoons) seems to catch and keep his attention moreso than some newer ones. I personally love T&J so this is a no brainer to recommend this to anyone but note: it does have a few concepts that are not appropriate, but are presented in a way that is way over the heads of children adn does have a few scenes that very concervative parents may term violent.",1173657600,,603,4.345132743362832

This DVD is just plain, old fashioned 1.33:1 (pan and scan) with half the picture hacked of the sides of each short. If Cartoon Network pay money to redub sound effects on present airings (some of which are in their OAR) then I would have assumed that Warner would also produced an anamorphic widescreen DVD with a 5.1 track.

The Cat Concerto (Tom and Jerry duel it out in the middle of a piano concert)
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Mouse (a nice little twist on the classic tale)
and
The Little Orphan (Jerry teams up with Tuffy, at least that's the name I know him by in a hilarious plot to sneak past Tom to the refrigerator)
Any fan of cartoons will know that Tom and Jerry cartoons are some of the best and here is an affordable collection of some of the famous cartoon pair's work.  A definite must have for fans of classic cartooning.
Note:  this review reflects the vhs version, apparently there is also a dvd with one more cartoon as well as expected features, which is even more reason to go out and buy a dvd player(:=",974332800,6,1075,4.333333333333333
1331258,4,B00003JRAJ,"Being firstborn brainchildren to the great kartoonie-makin' duo, Hanna and Barbera, Tom The Cat very merrily chased Jerry The Mouse through a long line of many successful animated shorts and into The History of Golden-Age  Cartoons.
Meet Tom, a very mean-spirited but gullibly innocent kitty  with his such endearing birthmark: a white blaze so tenderly drawn onto his  forehead (though it doesn't always appear). And here comes poor Tom's  archrival, Jerry the achingly cute and irritatingly heroic little brown  rodent. Now just watch the unfortunate old cat get squashed, burned,  slashed into two, mangled, roasted, frozen, blown up, and even beheaded at  one time at the hands of the pesky little Jerry who fiercely struggled to  save the lives of his innocent critter friends and his diapered infant  cousin, Tuffy The Mouse (once named Nibbles). Ironically, it makes you feel  sorry for the poor long-suffering old Tom, who after all is only responding  to his hunger pangs and pedatory instincts. In fact, though Tom is usually  placed in the villain role, he really has a very good heart right  underneath his very savage white breast, thus you do eventually grow to  love him ... and uh, hate Jerry for shoving him into such painful  situations in the first place. But sometimes, Tom gets to turn the tables,  thus Jerry is the one who winds up getting just the desserts! Sorry, but  fair's fair for the famous cat-and-mouse team!
In the later years, when  the television overtook the visual entertainment of the old-time films in  the theater, the reowned Chuck Jones overtook the Tom & Jerry studio.  As a result, he produced very charming new cartoons with his very own  personal touch, though they weren't met with very resounding success due to  artistic differences. Another director to guide the cat and mouse through  the Sixties is the notorious Gene Detrich who made many UPS-style cartoons  - most of them just plain awful. Poor Tom gets victimized even more  brutally by a very unfunny and very abusive owner and the increasingly  annoying Jerry, who may make you hate him even more than ever. And along  comes even more cartoons about The Cat-And-Mouse Duo through the '70s, the  '80s, and even the '90s, including a feature-length movie produced in the  remarkable vein of Don Bluth but completely forgotten and the cute kiddie  stuff, Tom and Jerry The Kids. Though they may not have come up so  successful as the original and more acclaimed cartoons of the Golden Age,  this nevertheless accounts for the continuing popularity of Tom The Grey  Cat and Jerry The Brown Mouse possibly into the new millennium for the  future children and the diehard cartoon fans.",958521600,2,2687,4.95067264573991
1331259,5,B00003JRAJ,"This is the very first DVD of Tom and Jerry cartoons. It has a total of 14 shorts, plus a clip from the movie ANCHOR'S AWAY featuring Jerry doing a dance with Gene Kelly. The 14 cartoons that they included are all excellent. A few Oscar winners are included. All 14 are from the early  period when Tom and Jerry were directed by Hanna and Barbera. Most of these  are cartoons that I have never seen before. There is quite a bit of  violence in these cartoons, and that's good, because that's how cartoons  are supposed to be! Several of the cartoons have blackface gags, so if you  are offended by that kind of thing, then I am letting you know in advance.  For example, there's a scene where Jerry's face is dipped in shoe polish,  and afterwords he has a blackface.
Unfortunatley, one of the cartoons  has been edited! This really ticks me off! In the original version of  ""The Little Orphan,"" a lit candle lands on Tom's tail. His whole  body is burned and turns black. Then the black Tom gets pushed into a  cabinet of dishes. But on this DVD, the entire part where Tom is black has  been deleted. This really Ticks me off! It's bad enough that they edit the  cartoons when they play them on TV, but to edit them on a DVD is beyond  ridiculous. Actually, I knew that the DVD was edited even before I bought  it, but I bought it anyway because I love these cartoons! But still I don't  understand why they edited it. I own plenty of R-rated movies with content  that some people might view as being ""offensive,"" but none of  those are edited. So I guess some people think that a cartoon is somehow  more offensive than an R-rated movie.
Well, despite this one flaw, this  is an excellent DVD. The other 13 cartoons are all complete and uncut. The  picture and sound quality is absolutely amazing. There's this one cartoon  where Jerry is on top of a skyscaper in New York City, and he's hanging  over the edge and when they show the moving traffic down below I almost got  dizzy looking at it. All those itty bitty cars show up so clear on my TV  screen. They really did a good job with the picture and sound here. Also  it's nice to be able to watch these cartoons without any of those stupid  network TV logos on the screen.",956361600,133,2229,4.321256038647343
1331260,4,B00003JRAJ,"An excellent DVD for Tom and Jerry fans.  Of the 14 shorts, only one was left butched.  ""The Little Orphan"" was tampered with: the scene where Tom gets burned up when the candle lands in his tail towards the end.  Other ""offensive"" shorts, like ""Mouse In Manhattan,""  are left intact, including the scene when Jerry is in black-face after  being dipped in shoe polish.  The reproduction of the DVD is, as you would  expect, sensational.  Aside from ""Little Orphan,"" a great DVD.",954720000,3,478,4.7439024390243905
