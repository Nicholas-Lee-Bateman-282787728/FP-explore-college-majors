3437893,5,B0019L0ACM,"This movie is funny on one viewing and funnier the more times you watch it. If it had a higher budget some of the laughs could have been more traditionally timed for a mainstream audience but the odd awkward timing actually makes a lot of the material funnier for it in my opinion. It has some of the best trash talk I've ever heard. The main character is a strangely likable, entertainingly disgusting, half-moron with indomitable spirit who tries to get his martial arts star hero to come to the midwestern dojo he runs. Obviously, things don't go well. It's got a slow patch in the first few minutes but it's all laughs from there. Check it out.",1231372800,,648,4.5

3437896,1,B0019L0ACM,"They could call this, ""The Laughless Way"" because I don't think so I laughed a single time in the entire hour and a half movie.  I don't know how a movie like this got funding or financing.  I have heard some positive reviews of the movie but found it utterly stupid and uninteresting.

3437898,1,B0019L0ACM,"This movie is listed as a ""comedy"" but I found absolutely nothing funny about it.  I'm a serious martial artist and can appreciate a joke with the best of them; but this movie almost made me ill.  I watched it all--still can't figure out why--thinking that I was missing something.  From the McDojo street displays, the lack of honor and respect in the main character to the vicious violence in the training (any student who beat the s*** out of another student on purpose would be immediately dismissed from our dojo!) to the soft porn scenes gives all martials arts a black eye.  No one is perfect in this life, least of all me, but this was just ridiculous.",1227225600,3,660,4.5210084033613445
3437899,1,B0019L0ACM,"This must have been some high school guy's very low budget video production, probably a class project, given the level of non-acting, dialogue and 6th grade boys' sexual fantasy.

Danny McBride plays a Tae Kwon Do instructor going through somewhat of a midlife crisis.  Sounds simple, but it was three times funnier than Napoleon Dynamite and all the no name actors were awesome!  You will laugh literally every one to two minutes.

3437902,5,B0019L0ACM,"I don't know why it's not listed here yet, but the DVD of ""The Foot Fist Way"" will be out September 23, 2008. This is a very funny no-budget film shot in North Carolina and it started the careers of actor Danny McBride (""Pineapple Express"") and director Jody Hill (the upcoming ""Observe and Report,"" starring Seth Rogen).",1221350400,3,321,4.649122807017544
3437928,1,B0019L0ACM,"Cringe humor can be torture and this movie is full of it.

It's not funny, it's sad. McBride plays the character very well.  Out of touch, ego driven, short sighted, complete lack of self awareness...  getting creepy with ladies.  I could not finish it. Its rare that need to stop a movie but I had to find something else to watch.

There is not even anything of value in the Tae Kwon Do aspect as this movie tends to mock it and the community.  I am sure people in martial arts communities can see people they actually know in this character but I made it 75% through the movie hoping for some redemption and there had been nothing of value shown or anyone with any likable qualities other than peripheral characters with not much screen time.

This is not a typical ""Will Ferrell"" style movie which I was hoping for. Usually the movies associated with Will Ferrell have obnoxious but likable characters. They make you cringe but you can laugh.  I found none of that in this movie.

Having said that about the characters/script/acting, I can say that even if I do not like a movie I can find some aspect of production that I do like. Sets, camerawork, stunts, effects...  This movie is shot terribly.  Everything about this movie seemed cheap and thrown together. Perhaps they spent the bulk of their budget on the 308 rental. Had they given it more screen time I may have kept watching.",1520553600,,1388,4.534136546184739

That crap about will Ferrell watching it may be true. This movie reminds me of one of those movies based on a SNL skit that they took a somewhat funny 2 min skit and made it into a 2 to 3 hr movie. I have no idea how long this movie was but i skipped parts of it an it still felt like 3 hrs. This is a big no.,1519257600,,461,3.8125
3437959,5,B0019L0ACM,"I love McBride's humor.  He's funny in everything he does.  I've mostly seen him in tiny to small parts and he made me laugh in those. In The Foot Fist Way he's the main character.  I had a younger brother who did karate and had to have numb chucks in his room, etc. so this is very nostalgic and authentic.  The movie is not just funny, it has a deceivingly simple structure that is actually emotionally efficient.

3437966,4,B0019L0ACM,"This is the kind of movie that has a limited audience.  The first would be anybody who has ever stepped foot into a strip mall martial arts place with a typical out of shape instructor.  I guess discipline stops at the dinner table, but I digress.  I think anyone who grew up in the late 80's early 90's will find this movie to be nostalgic as well.  It's not laugh out funny but it is funny.  A well written parody.

(If you plan on writing your own review, please use the word karate instead of martial arts if you wish to receive lots of comments from strip mall martial art instructors correcting you about the difference.  And you might be able to even insult him enough to get challenged to defend your own honor just like in the movie.)",1513296000,9,743,4.302158273381295

3438075,5,B0019L0ACM,This is one of the best martial arts movies of all time.  Fight scenes are raw and convincing.  The actors clearly were long time students of Chung Moo Quan.  I studied Chung Moo Quan for years then Chung Moo Doe once master Kim went to prison and had to change the name of the schools.  This movie totally brought back memories of my days training at the Chung Moo Quan school on University avenue.  People might think this movie is a comedy but I assure this as real as it gets.

He has some major character flaws that manifest in his teaching as well as his marriage.  As a martial arts hobbyist for many years, I found the martial arts aspect of this movie the most interesting.  There is an unstated tension between martial arts as taught in their native cultural framework and martial arts as a white, middle-class American activity.  This appears mainly in the occasional title frames that advertise a virtue when the adjacent scenes seem to embody its opposite.  While I found the movie very entertaining, the crude handling of the sexual sub-plots makes me hesitate in recommending it broadly.  Consider who will be watching!

I watched this movie with a friend who never studied martial arts and he thought this movie was ""pretty funny"" only because some of the jokes weren't relatable to him.  With all the stupid bickering and the egos...Danny McBride played this character perfectly.  If he would have hit on the female students more aggressively he would have been the spitting image of my old instructor.

Plus there are long stretches without any real laughs, just major discomfort and squirmy moments. Those are nice as spice, but not as the main course.

And McBride's huge debt to Ricky Gervais' David Brent is all too obvious (as is the director's). The (original and by far the best) Office did that, and much better. FFW gets a little too mean and unfunny at various times as well.

I wouldn't recommend this. Just watch Eastbound again!",1259539200,7,698,4.612903225806452
3438517,4,B0019L0ACM,"Danny McBride did this movie before he did Eastbound & Down.  Both involve a character on the trashy, obnoxious, athletically employed side. Eastbound & Down's variation is that the guy once hit it big.  This character will never hit it big.  There is another variation. The marital problem here is dead serious.  He is married to a woman who looks and acts like a two bit hooker. I thought he did a marvelous, very credible job of playing a guy who keeps deluding himself about the woman he married until he no longer can. That was the best part of the movie for me.  It showed another side to McBride's talent.  Yes, he does play some aspects of it for laughs but he really shows his acting chops here as the cuckold. All this said, one viewing was enough.  Danny McBride is a terrific talent and I am looking forward to seeing a lot more of him.

3438520,3,B0019L0ACM,"I love Danny McBride, but found this flick a little hard to get into. It's not so much that the jokes fell flat, it's that they had a good joke that just kept repeating over and over. The basic joke is that the incompetent taekwondo instructor turns child-bully as he struggles through the parts of his life that really aren't solveable by violence. As the main character just became more and more of a bully and less and less of a warm, comical, likeable character, I basically stopped caring about him and what happens to him in this movie. By the half way point I couldn't help but think the character just deserved to have bad things happen to him, or that it didn't really matter what happened to him. After about an hour you've heard all the jokes this movie has to offer. I will still root for Danny to have a good career because he is just hilarious in other stuff.",1245369600,2,873,4.361963190184049

3438522,3,B0019L0ACM,"You can easily see where Danny McBride started creating the Kenny Powers character. Fred Simmons is a little cleaner, little more subdued version of Powers. I had several laughs at this movie however unfortunately I would probably have enjoyed it more if I had seen it before East Bound and Down. I viewed it with a few friends and although we all loved it, the ones who hadn't seen East Bound seemed to like it more. One thing is clear; this group: McBride, Ben Best & Jody Hill are gonna be big stars.",1240531200,4,503,4.419354838709677
3438523,4,B0019L0ACM,If you have ever spent much time in a martial arts program you will certainly find some humorous moments in this. It is a pretty decent spoof done in a sort of documentary style. Not the greatest martial arts flick ever but alot of inside joke moments from the dojo.,1239753600,2,266,4.34
3438524,1,B0019L0ACM,"I think the level of enjoyment one takes away from this low budget indie comedy is directly related to just how funny you find Danny McBride.  Personally, I don't get his brand of humor.  I didn't find him particularly funny in Tropic Thunder and the same holds true for his current HBO series, East Bound and Down.  McBride has one type of character that he can play:  narcassistic, self deluded, arrogant white trash.  I guess it's fair to say that he plays it well, it's just not funny.

So I decided to give McBride another chance and check out the movie that gave him his start.  The Foot Fist Way finds McBride playing his patented character type yet again (think of him as a white trash version of The Office's David Brent, only with no redeeming qualities).  He runs a tae kwan do dojo where he insturcts and belittles students of all ages.  When his wife cheats on him, his entire world is shaken up so he sets off on a road trip to see his martial arts hero, Chuck ""The Truck"" Wallace.

As you can probably imagine, nothing goes the way McBride's character intends in this movie.  Chuck Wallace turns out to be even more of a self absorbed jerk than McBride and his marriage ends up falling into more dissaray than before.

I wish I had more to say about this movie.  Despite its 82 minute running time, it feels glacier paced.  It is painfully unfunny in just about every aspect.  McBride certainly has a gift for creating an all too believable version of whte trash, but that really doesn't matter when you're not laughing.",1237766400,4,1535,4.490974729241877
3438525,4,B0019L0ACM,"This relatively new martial arts movie is not just for martial arts aficionados.
It is done with a sense of humor, partly biting, partly compassionate, giving those of
us who don't live in the world of kicks and strikes but who are concerned with
the real human dilemma of how we manage our lives a thoughtful film. We may talk integrity, sincerity,
and restraint -- but all too often we live to an altogether code.  The acting
is gently real, the editing is sometimes a bit choppy, and there is a powerful
and moving storyline.
  Whether you have ever wanted to break boards with the edge of your hand, I
still can recommend this movie to anyone who cares about real people living
real lives.",1236902400,2,693,4.528
8274313,1,B0019L0ACM,"I tried to like it. I tried to get into it. I quit watching after about 40 minutes. It's just stupid. There was only one funny scene. Almost entirely all Danny McBride's character does is berate everyone around him.  It took all of three seconds into the first time seeing his on screen wife to know she would be cheating on him. In real life no one would pay this guy to teach you self defense classes. I grew up during the late 70's and 80's so I get that it is some kind of knockoff tot he famed karate, kung fu, etc movies of that time but this doesn't even come close to funny in my opinion. When they said Will Ferrell watched this movie 17 times at the beginning I think that says it all. If you are a big fan of Will Ferrell you might really enjoy this movie. It wasn't for me.",1525651200,,785,4.032051282051282
