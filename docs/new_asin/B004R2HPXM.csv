8438651,3,B004R2HPXM,"Rajkumar Kohli's 'Saazish' is best fare from the 80's.
'Saazish' has too many twists & turns, one after one. However, the final twist is good, but again this film remains as a strictly one-time-watch.
Mithun is good. Late actors Raaj Kumar, Vinod Mehra & Amrish Puri are okay. Raj Babbar does well in a well-written role.
Watch this film...",1304380800,,340,4.779661016949152
