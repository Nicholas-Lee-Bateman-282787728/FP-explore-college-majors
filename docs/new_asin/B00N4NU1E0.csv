6609526,3,B00N4NU1E0,"By looking at the cover, I was expecting something with a little more steam.  Beautiful leading actress, but not enough chemistry and emotion between the two leading characters.  The plot was slow and predictable.  The movie falls in the category of a boring day time soap opera.",1448668800,3,279,4.8936170212765955
6609527,5,B00N4NU1E0,Great movie with a few twists and turns. John Lloyd and Bea are a power couple. Thanks Amazon for providing this movie on prime. We need more like it.,1448582400,,150,4.206896551724138

6609530,5,B00N4NU1E0,The best part was the ending. It left viewers wondering what could have happened.  Each viewer will have their on conclusion.  Not a typical Filipino love story ending.,1488672000,,168,4.964285714285714

6609537,4,B00N4NU1E0,"THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE MISTRESS WITH THE MARRIED HUSBAND WAS GIVEN A PATRONIZING POSITIVE TWIST AND MORAL RATIONALIZATIONS IN THIS MOVIE, BUT STILL, IT IS BIBLICALLY WRONG AND REPREHENSIBLE TO MESS WITH THE EMOTIONS OF THE RELATIVES AND FAMILY MEMBERS OF SOMEONE WHO IS ALREADY MARRIED.  THE MISTRESS IS STILL AN EVIL WOMAN, NO MATTER, HOW SAINTLY SHE IS DEPICTED IN MOVIES, LIKE THIS.",1483401600,,386,5.03125
6609538,5,B00N4NU1E0,"To me the purpose of a movie is to entertain.  Did it entertain me?  Yes it did.  I wasn't only entertained but I was also drawn in by the characters.  I am Filipino and don't really care much about Tagalog movies, but this is an exception.  John Lloyd and Bea Alonzo's acting were a surprise to me, I didn't know they were that good.  And whoever translated the subtitles, they were spot on.",1481328000,,392,4.301369863013699

6609547,2,B00N4NU1E0,"Sappy, shallow, predictable story. It plays like a cheesy TV drama, complete with swelling dramatic music. Ew. I guess very young women and teenaged girls will like it.  The female lead is very lovely and fun to watch - her acting is over the top but I think that's the cultural norm. The male lead is soft and pudgy and I had trouble seeing him as attractive as her lover or taking him all that seriously. Again, maybe cultural norms are in the way... perhaps a little soft and overweight is sexy in other cultures.",1474588800,,516,4.431578947368421

6609554,3,B00N4NU1E0,"Another Amazon shill film--a joke this is listed at 4 1/2 stars.  Hardly 3 star, its a poorly acted B movie, a drawn out soap opera melodrama that only delivers sappy sentiment.  This must sell in the Pacific.",1466035200,,209,4.473684210526316

6609557,1,B00N4NU1E0,"I watch Filipino movies to maintain my language skills.  The only ""good"" part in this movie is the beautiful leading lady.  This movie must have been written by some teenager during their lunch break.  The dialogue is less than poor, it is sprinkled with Taglish (Tagalog and English mixed together).  Taglish is what TexMex is to Spanish, it sounds pretentious.  The leading lady is a beautiful woman with great hair, every scene with her in it looks like a shampoo commercial.  The rest of the cast needs to return to acting school. I've seen high school drama club performers have more expression in their eyes that make you see and believe the character.",1463270400,,658,4.778761061946903

6609560,5,B00N4NU1E0,"This movie held my attention right to the very end. It takes a very good movie to do that, so many movies I start watching only to stop mid way because I lose interest. Definitely not the case with this one, I can truly relate with Sari, torn between two lovers. This movie had me laughing and crying, I have to keep this is my library so I can watch it over and over again!!",1459987200,,375,4.013333333333334

6609574,4,B00N4NU1E0,l have watched only a few subtitled films because it's difficult to watch and read at the same time.  This movie was nice because half of the time they were talking in English and I was able to really watch the movie.  This movie brings out into view of true life scenario in any culture where an older man with money is able to get a young mistress and imprison her in the sense that it makes it difficult for her to fall in love with a younger man her age.  You must watch this film to see if the young mistress is able to break free from the older man!,1451433600,,555,3.981981981981982
6609575,4,B00N4NU1E0,"Enjoyable movie but realistic story that will not win ""feel good movie of the year."" Hard to cast any stones here. You really feel for the leads here and especially the female lead who is in a tight spot. .

The leads are superbly acted/directed and the female lead is perfectly cast. Why did the male lead ditch his Porsche for a POS Nissan Titan pick-up that even Consumer Reports hates? Junk!

The female ""friends"" who work at the tailor shop where the female lead works are conniving b**ches who need ropes around their necks. FAST. I smell jealousy and conspiracy!

Ending is a wee bit murky and ambiguous for me but rewind and watch the last 10 minutes again.

You really feel for the leads by the end. Both are in difficult positions. Damn...",1449878400,,749,4.525925925925926

Watch it!  :-)  Watching him court, pursue and fall in love with her... Totally gave me Life. What almost every girl wants.~
