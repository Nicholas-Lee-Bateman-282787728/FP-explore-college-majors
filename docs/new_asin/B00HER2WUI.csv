8632019,5,B00HER2WUI,"THE CAINE MUTINY (1954) is a really fine Technicolor adaptation of Herman Wouk's novel. Directed by Edward Dmytryk, it stars Humphrey Bogart, Van Johnson and Fred MacMurray. Jos Ferrer is prominently credited. Even though he appears late in the film, his role as defense attorney to the accused mutineers is vital.

Also in the cast, newcomers Robert Francis and May Wynn (love interest for the ladies), E,G, Marshall, Tom Tully, Arthur Franz, Lee Marvin, Claude Akins, Warner Anderson, Jerry Paris and Steve Brodie. Prominent uncrediteds: Herbert Anderson, James Best and the ubiquitous Whit Bissell. Film score is by Max Steiner.

Synopsis (contains spoilers):
After a difficult stretch in the Atlantic war, Lt. Cmdr. Philip Francis Queeg takes over the USS Caine, a sloppily-run minesweeper. It's not apparent at first but Capt. Queeg's nerves are rubbed raw, and having a crew and ship that aren't spit polish perfect have quickly turned him into an unbearable martinet.

When it becomes obvious to his junior officers that Queeg is suffering a case of extreme paranoia and may not be fit for service they illegally relieve him of duty. This action culminates in a court martial trial where Queeg, under pressure of pointed questioning by defense counsel Lt. Barney Greenwald (Ferrer), practically has a nervous breakdown. The men are found not guilty, and at their post-trial champagne celebration, Lt. Greenwald, who elsewhere has had a few himself, lashes out at the men he successfully defended.

This final scene, which is not in Wouk's book, came under criticism, for it was perceived as in the end turning the movie into a rah rah celebration of US Navy tradition and history.",1406332800,,1687,5.123636363636364
8632020,5,B00HER2WUI,"Since so many Amazon reviews of ""The Caine Mutiny"" (many of them excellent assessments of this great motion picture) exist already (as of May 2014, when I am writing this), I here would like mostly to praise this film as a very fine, cunningly wrought adaptation to the screen of Herman Wouk's enthralling novel. I read the book a few years ago, long before seeing the movie only recently. Having served for a few years of active duty as an enlisted man in the U.S. Navy, novels and films of this kind are of intense interest to me. The DVD edition which I viewed is one of the four discs, in slim containers, held together as a boxed set of three great war films (plus a bonus disc), ""W.W. II, 60th Anniversary Collection"" (Sony Films Home Entertainment 11527).

The film very wisely limits its adaptation to the core of the novel, from the graduation of Ensign Willie Keith (played by Robert Charles Francis) from training at a reserve officer training programme to the conclusion of the military tribunal that results in the U.S. Navy's reluctant condemnation of the skipper of the Caine (a destroyer/mine sweeper), Lt. Cdr. Philip Francis Queeg (played by Humphrey Bogart) and the consequent vindication of the ship's executive officer, Lt. Steve Maryk (acted by Van Johson), who during the severe duress of a typhoon at sea, relieves Queeg of his command of the Caine, which Queeg's appallingly bad seamanship and lack of sound judgment put into danger.

Anyone who has never been through such dangerous weather at sea on such a small vessel can only imagine how arduous it is for a ship and its crew to survive it. While serving on a destroyer in the Navy (in the Atlantic Fleet, not the Pacific), I experienced on two different occasions the full fury of an hurricane at sea, so I greatly admire how well the film so vividly depicts the Caine struggling to stay afloat and not to capsize in such frightening conditions.

At film's conclusion, one sees Keith's return (now as a Lt. j.g.) to the Caine. One particularly interesting event from Wouk's novel that takes place after Keefer's and Keith's further time on the Caine is a viciously damaging Japanese kamikaze attack on the ship, which it very nearly sinks, a fate which the Caine avoids due to Keith's leadership and bravery. Keefer has been the skipper at first (following Queeg's hearing), faring poorly in that function, then Keith rises to command. Truth to tell, there is so much good material just in the early and later parts of Wouk's novel that a full movie, entertaining and gripping, could be made mostly from the portions earlier and later in Wouk's book which the movie, ""The Caine Mutiny"", albeit wisely, passes over.

Limiting the film to this central concern of Wouk's novel, however, makes it possible to do some really artistic justice to Wouk's novel, which, short of resulting in a film of monumental length, could not treat the entire work so satisfactorily without that self-imposed limitation. The novel itself, in its earlier pages, traces Keith's civilian life, university studies, and Naval training, as well as the beginning of his romance with his lady love, and, after the time of the action which the film depicts, the book also portrays his further naval career right through to the end of W.W. II.

There are many incidents aboard the Caine, in Wouk's novel, that one so would like to see treated on screen, but which had to be omitted or truncated to make of ""The Caine Mutiny"" a film of reasonable length. One that I particularly miss is the depiction of the full extent of Queeg's cowardice, and Keith's contrasting courage, in the ""Yellow Stain incident"", when Queeg deliberately avoids the fire from a shore battery as he abandons an invading landing party to its fate without the Caine's protective cover of it; during it, Queeg's movements on the bridge do not occur according to best military advantage, but rather to his own personal safety.

On the other hand, the movie's treatment of the tribunal's hearings is brilliant, better paced and motivated, in fact, than in the novel itself! The cinematic portrayal of the Naval lawyer's, Lt. Barry Greenwald's, handling Maryk's defense (which Jos&eacute; Ferrer acts out) is more effective, less indulgent, and more convincing than Wouk's handling of Greenwald, nearly eliminating the lawyer's Jewish priggishness, to welcome effect. As for Lt. Tom Keefer's treacherous betrayal of Maryk and Keith, Fred McMurray's acting and the screenplay's deft portrayal of Keefer's moral turpitude and false bravado do full justice to what readers of Wouk's novel itself experience of this man's despicably weak and manipulative character.

There is so much more that one could say, and that has been said in other Amazon reviews, about this great film, but I limit myself to what I describe here, hopeful that readers of this review will go on to read yet other Amazon comments on the motion picture in order to form a more fully rounded idea of what this great work of the screen is all about and how stunning are the acting, filmography, and all the rest of it!",1400112000,,5104,4.853042479908152
