1783156,4,B00006JU84,This is an enjoyable series the majority of the time but sadly imo it falls apart during the last few episodes and the lack of a real conclusion to the Miyu/Rheiha story was irritating.,1093132800,2,185,4.470588235294118
1783157,3,B00006JU84,"This is an average anime in terms of plot, animation and character development.  It does have an excellent character design for Miyu.  If you get a chance to rent it, do so.  If you have to buy it in order to watch it, don't.  Save your money for something more worthwhile.
Many of the episodes have a monster-of-the-week favor.  The story usually revolves around the theme of obsession, but it is usually not too inspired.  The animation quality is that which you can expect from made-for-TV animations.  In other words, they are nothing to write home about.  The only thing good about the series is a very alluring character design for Miyu, which is quiet, enigmatic, seductive and dangerous.  In a word - vampiric!",1082073600,11,718,4.725806451612903
1783158,4,B00006JU84,"In this series, unlike the original, Miyu is more of a schoolgirl than a menace, but the series overall is still engaging. Just when the plot started to become predictable (mysterious happening leads Miyu to the Shinma, then a battle), the episodes started to focus on the victims of the demons. The two-part Light of the Sea was also a winner.
Great attention was paid to the details of costumes and creatures, and the DVD inserts about the monster designs are a welcome extra. The music CD is heaven itself - what a great combination of moods and styles! I've listened to it dozens of times and still enjoy it.
The addition of pretty-boy Larva was disconcerting at first, since it removed a great deal of his menace. But the character works overall. The only clunkers are Reiha and Matzukaze. Their constant taunts and threats became repetitious and their actions were predictable, and it was not helped that Miyu did not have a complete victory over her rival(s).",1045440000,7,966,4.755952380952381
1783159,5,B00006JU84,"The Vampire Princess Miyu TV Series is definitely one of the best anime series ever.  The original 1980s Vampire Princess Miyu OAV Series is also great, but at only four episodes leaves the viewer wanting for more.  The 26-episode TV Series allows for far more character development, and additional characters, while somewhat changing the background story for Miyu and her servant Larva (and also giving Larva a voice and a personality).  In addition, the TV Series' music by Kenji Kawai (of Ghost in the Shell fame) is simultaneously absolutely haunting and exquisitely beautiful.
That the Vampire Princess Miyu TV Series has finally been released as a DVD Box Set is one of the greatest triumphs for commercial releases of Japanese animation in North America.  The DVD Box Set includes six DVDs (each with an insert detailing the shinma from that DVD's episodes), an official North American release of the soundtrack for the TV Series (no more need to import the soundtrack from Japan!!!), and a ""Mystery Friendship Charm"" like the one shared by Miyu and Chisato throughout the series.  The box itself is sturdy and distinctive, and nicely encloses the contents of the DVDs, charm, and CD.
Unfortunately, the first DVD in the set (""Initiation"") is not chaptered very well.  Also, the first few DVDs have inserts with episode synopses, but this is missing from the final few DVDs in the set.  Also, it would have been nice to have volume numbers printed on the spine of each DVD, to quickly identify each volume should they ever be placed out of order in the box.  Finally, the charm does not include a keyring (as in the series) or a chain to be worn as a necklace, meaning that the viewer must instead pay even MORE money to be able to actually use the charm as anything but a small paperweight.
Overall, the Vampire Princess Miyu TV Series should be seen by EVERY fan of Japanese animation, and will also make an excellent part of any fan's collection.  Plus, the charm makes for an interesting conversation piece :-)",1039046400,9,2021,4.801152737752162
1783160,4,B00006JU84,"I love this series and I can't wait to give it to my friend for her birthday.  This is the perfect thing for a person that love dark, mysterious women or their equally dark and mysterious guardians! ^^",1036540800,3,201,4.2894736842105265

7970868,5,B00006JU84,I first discovered Miyu a long time back. Back when vhs ruled the video stores. I spent many years looking for other volumes of the series to no avail. I was happy when I finally found the complete series at a reasonable price on dvd.,1359590400,,234,4.222222222222222
7970869,1,B00006JU84,I hated these dvds and could hardly sit through them. The art is lazy and sloppy. I truly regret that this company and their animators got their hands on it. The original story in the mangas/OAV is SO much better. Do yourself a favor and skip this one if you liked the original macabre story. This dvd series is just awful awful awful.,1317081600,,335,4.333333333333333
7970870,2,B00006JU84,"Tokyopop did a pretty lousy job on these DVDs if you prefer watching them in Japanese.
Their translation quality is worse than most of the other american companys these days. They also completely change scenes with Japanese text, often replacing them with poor English translations, so the original meaning is lost.  I won't be buying another Tokyopop DVD.",1284854400,2,356,5.137931034482759

7970873,4,B00006JU84,"I love the whole little-vampire-girl-protects-the-planet kinda thing going on
here. I was expecting a simple retelling of the OVA, but it's not the same.

Also.. to people having problems playing these DVD's, or low-quality-looking
discs... You bought the BOOTLEG version.
 Here's a tip people. If it says IMPORT and ENGLISH DUBBED in the same
sentence, then it's a bootleg. The US licensing companies don't dub it here
and then send it back to japan....
 You got ripped off.",1181520000,,475,5.064102564102564
7970874,2,B00006JU84,"It's hideous, it has no on-DVD printing (it looks blank),it has no quality whatsoever (except the quality of the playing/viewing); I would've prefer to throw my money into the toilet and see it flush!!",1127433600,,201,4.9411764705882355
7970875,3,B00006JU84,"I just managed to get my hands on the Ultimate boxed set and I can say I am far from being impressed after watching the first volume.  Although it is one of my favorite anime series, the DVDs were poorly done.  Half the DVD players I tried wouldnt even play them properly, the bitrate seems to be quite low, and the Ops and Eds were cut to only be displayed during the first and last episodes on the DVD.  Hell, Id almost think I had gotten a bootleg by mistake.  Even more disappointing is that it appears noone even bothered to translate the ed lyrics.  Overall, I would say I paid alot more then I should have for the boxed set.",1123718400,,631,4.181818181818182
7970876,5,B00006JU84,"The Vampire Princess is 26 twisted episodes.  Disturbing and twisted, with suggested relationships and unhappy endings.  I loved it.  This is what vampires are all about.  Oh, there is violence and some nudity, but you can find that ANYWHERE.  And while the voices of Wendee Lee, Lex Lang, Sandy Fox and Steve Blum are always a delight you could also find them ANYWHERE.

But what made it for me was the stories.  The endings were rarely happy ones and most never even came close to being fair ones.  Even for the Japanese these stories were sad, in which good guys, bad guys, victims and even bystanders, were either hurt, killed or had their lives destroyed.  Bird-demons, giant spiders and flesh eating mermaids turn dreams into nightmares.  Nobody ends up happy or untouched and it really makes me think how much BETTER horror movies could be if it was more like this.

Miyu has some feelings for close friends, but also she is a vampire and seems to feel no strong feelings for those outside her inner circle.  She allows dozens of people, if not more, to die before taking action against the Shinma.  Is she slow to stop the Shinma because she needs proof or because she just doesn't care?

A must for vampire or anime lovers.",1097971200,23,1232,4.617511520737327
