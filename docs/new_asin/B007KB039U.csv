Cheap production values (think Junior High AV), the Tea Partier is an unbelievably smug, uptight middle-aged woman, and the alleged Occupier is an inarticulate, seemingly brain-damaged moron who can be led by the other into questioning environmental regulations and upholding the sanctity of the ""free market"" and is absolutely uncritical towards the vile Koch Brothers, purveyors of all that is wrong with our corrupted system.  It seems this ""Nimrod"" (that is his name, right?) is so eager to find consensus with the Tea Partier that he's suspended his judgment (if he had any to begin with).  That, plus he's really not all that up on the issues or quick on his feet.  In his subservient role, he does no service at all to the Occupy movement (if he's even affiliated with it; and, if he was, it's no wonder that movement disintegrated) and contributes nothing meaningful to the ""dialogue"", such as it is.

The points of agreement between the two are so minimal as to be meaningless,  putting into question the worth of the whole endeavor.  I honestly can't  believe the producers, viewing the finished product, thought this debacle worthy of being put into the public realm.  This mess wouldn't be worth $1.99, much less $19.99.  It wouldn't even recommend it as a hipster's ironic coaster.",1411689600,,1318,4.9771689497716896
