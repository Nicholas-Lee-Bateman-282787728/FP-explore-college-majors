8367598,5,B002EDEZZC,"This a great video on elk hunting. The Petersen's staff are very professional, and the video contains some very exciting hunts which are presented in a very informative manner. It is a very informative, but enjoyable video. The reason which it is different from many other video is the lack of immature behavior you find in other videos. All in all, a great video to watch.",1509753600,,373,4.666666666666667
