8566916,5,B00BE1XKE2,I adore old radio soap operas and have been trying to get this one for a long time. The story lines are quite silly for our time but that's what I love about them. The sound quality is wonderful. I listen to them as I am driving and I can get through one story for each trip to town. I'd love to have dvds of the old Guiding Light tv shows.,1490140800,,340,3.8028169014084505
