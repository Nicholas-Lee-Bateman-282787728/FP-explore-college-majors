2451477,4,B000C0GV5Q,"Everyone who's been to Venice should see this film. It was not filmed there. But Fellini clearly knows Venice very well, and this movie is a kind of expressionistic homage to a failing 18th-century empire. Not 5 stars, because despite the fascinating sets, costumes, actors, set pieces etc., the brilliant Fellini is terribly cold -- as always.",1160524800,,344,5.052631578947368
2451478,5,B000C0GV5Q,"Casanova's script, music and acting is just nifty. Donald Sutherland personifies Casanova, the famous scholar seducer and lover.
The film depicts Casanova as a sexually insatiable scholar/vagrant  even among the Italian and European aristocracy.
The music adaptation fits every single scene in the film.
Casanova is the most contemporary Masterpiece directed by Fellini after ""Amarcord"" and ""Satyricon"" and ""La Strada"" all of them
outstanding Masterpieces.
Just DO NOT BUY The Vault Series.",1150588800,7,490,5.805555555555555
2451479,5,B000C0GV5Q,"I must admit to being an inveterate Fellini fan - I don't know what the sixties would have been without the string of great flicks which followed the seminal La Dolce Vita.  That being said, Casanova was made in the mid-seventies - toward the end of the master's career - and is the work of a mature artist.  Is Casanova an old man's film?  In some ways, one has to have lived a bit to fully appreciate its humor, pathos, and greatness.  I  say, in my limited viewing of thousands of films (most before 1990), relative to the hundreds of thousands others have watched, Casanova ranks as one of the great historical re-creations, a sort of cinematic counterweight to Max Ophul's Lola Montez - and one of Fellini's most coherent, serious, and profound statements.

But none of these accolades could apply without the surprising, tour de force performance of Donald Sutherland (Keifer's daddy), who plays the legendary courtier.  For those who are unaware of Sutherland Sr's career , he was `discovered' by Jane Fonda while he was gigging as a DJ in British Columbia, became a noted hunk on the Hollywood party scene, and started making films alongside his thoroughbred and talented girlfriend.  O.K.  Women loved him - but an acting talent?  After many a mediocre performance, exactly how or why I do not know, he was cast by Fellini, of all folks, as Casanova.  His date with destiny had arrived.  And, somehow, like the proverbial understudy called on to star on opening night, or the bench player called on to start the biggest game of the season, he more than rises to the occasion.  He gives the performance of a lifetime.

I have not seen the most recent film version of Casanova.  However, there are scenes in Fellini's Casanova, such as the dance with the homonoculus, which are transcendent in their existential weight.  Not a film for a keg-bash, an orgy, or a light laugh.  Rather, an extended meditation on the emptiness to which the romantic impulse often leads, and how pearls before swine often end up trampled by them.  A must see for the serious at heart, and about the heart.",1141948800,32,2091,4.7134986225895315

2451484,5,B000C0GV5Q,"A passionate fan of Fellini, I managed, with some difficulty, to view Fellini's Casanova around 1977, never to watch it again until I bought this DVD. From the fragments I could remember and from what I read about Casanova, I was expecting a Fellini film of greater self-indulgence and less seriousness than many of his other films. I was pleasantly surprised to find this Fellini project is very nearly as delicious as my favorite Fellini film, Fellini's Satyricon. The two have much in common including the exploration of dream imagery and broken significance, dislocation in alien worlds of half-understood signs and mysterious threats, the pathos of loneliness, aging and mortality -- not to mention Il Maestro's lavish use of color and visual distortion to communicate the ironies of artifice. I quite loved it!",1355097600,,816,5.142857142857143
2451485,1,B000C0GV5Q,"Universal has done it again.  For some inexplicable reason they have released ""Fellini Casanova"" in its U.S./North American debut on DVD in Italian with irremovable subtitles as a MOD Vault Series title.  Anyone familiar with the film knows that Fellini chose Donald Sutherland to portray the infamous for no exceptional reason except his sexual prowess Casanova.  The Reg. 2 release, double disc Umbrella Films edition I purchased some time ago was in English, the language Sutherland spoke during production, but Universal has the whole thing dubbed in Italian with the subtitles.  I am so glad I've kept my Reg. 2 release in order to clearly picture Sutherland's brilliant performance.  It is an insult to re-imagine it any other way.  Fellini has again created an immense, stunning portrait, but look for the Umbrella Film release with its many extras and in English.  If Fellini were alive, I would berate him if he allowed the practice of dubbing his film in any other language than what was necessary.  What an idiotic decision.  Why do this to us?",1349568000,11,1055,4.982857142857143
2451486,5,B000C0GV5Q,"At 15, I ""discovered"" foreign films.  I felt so cool!  Ingmar Bergman's obliquely sinister THE MAGICIAN piqued
my interest.  Two years later I sank into the Swedish legend of THE VIRGIN SPRING.  1960
and LA DOLCE VITA also introduced me to a quirky Italian whose work I've followed ever since.

Federico Fellini's CASANOVA, perhaps his strangest film, languished in limbo since blue-ray came in and film companies abandoned catalog DVD.  However, since they also
loved additional revenue sources, just about every company instituted ""made on demand"" releases:
quality releases, just with no frills.

FELLINI'S CASANOVA has recently shown up; and if you're a Fellini fan I recommend adding
it to your film shelf.  It wasn't one of his top releases, but it certainly is his
strangest.  Donald Sutherland (Donald Sutherland???) plays the randy wanderer who considers his body his brush and the women of the world his canvas.  Seductions abound,
there is a rather sad sexual coupling contest; in the end Casanova is left to dance,
alone, with one of his automata.

Quality production values, enhanced by Nino Rota's haunting score.
WARNING: this is a voyage into a strange, curious and sad world.  It is also a macabre
essay on fame, and how we mindlessly screw our lives up.

Be sure to watch Casanova perilously sailing a sea of wind-toss'd plastic trash bags.
Only Fellini could get away with this.",1346198400,,1397,5.021739130434782
2451487,2,B000C0GV5Q,"""Fellini's Casanova"" is one of my favorite films, and I've long hoped for a  US DVD release. Universal Vault Series' on-demand release does deliver the best looking version on standard definition DVD, but be warned that the version you will receive - after displaying a speckle-free old-school Universal logo and English titles sequence - is in Italian with burned-in subtitles to the image. There is no English language option, which means you will not hear Donald Sutherland's voice on the soundtrack, and you cannot get rid of the text on the screen. Whoever made the decision to present the movie this way probably thought they were doing right by the film, but losing Sutherland's own voice performance was a serious letdown (it's a Fellini film, so technically all versions of it are dubbed). The DVD is single layer as well, so it's a 2 1/2 hour film on a 4GB dvd-r. This may not look that great on some systems. The UK inD release will remain my go-to DVD version unfortunately, despite looking inferior.",1334966400,38,1012,4.816091954022989
2451488,4,B000C0GV5Q,"Casanova is my favorite Fellini film. Much of what I'd say about it is said in cvairag's review. Indeed, Sutherland is excellent, as he is in Bertolucci's 1900 and Altman's Nashville. I've never seen him in anything else, including Klute. The supporting roles are all played excellently, too, including Giulietta Masina as a German humpback ""handle-eater"".

Anyway, as to the technical aspects, they are excellent. The image and sound are superb. You'll want to view this on the largest and highest resolution screen possible. Even then, it's not clear to me it's less than movie-screenable. I mean, I saw this movie in a good theatre with a big screen. That's its intended home. Nevertheless, I buy most DVDs and blu-rays as momentos of movies I've seen. It'd be a shame to see Casanova first on DVD.

As an example, in the opening sequence, a submerged statue is brought to the surface of a pool and hoisted up. Somehow, the support posts break and the statue sinks back into the pool. A very powerful image is the statue on the bottom of the pool. On first viewing I thought that had been cut, but I think it is there, just briefly at the end of the sequence. But it just doesn't have the same effect, so it's almost not there.

Update: please see Alfred Viola's review and the comments after it. My enthusiasm for the technical aspects of the DVD is now tempered by his observations.",1330905600,,1387,4.653061224489796
2451489,2,B000C0GV5Q,"This is one of the worst professional DVD's I've ever received.  The compression is so poor that chunks of color information are clearly visible even during the opening credits.  Also, it comes with a warning that it may not even be playable in computer drives.  What's most frustrating is that the print is obviously a pretty good one.  The levels are all good.  All Universal needed was to take some care with the compression of this dvd.  I can excuse the fact that there's no booklet or further information about the film aside from the unimaginatively designed front and back of box.  This would be fine if the dvd looked better.  But it just looks completely cheap and unprofessional.  Worse than Netflix quality.  For this they have the nerve to charge nearly 20 dollars!  What a shame!!!!  I wish Universal would just let Criterion license the film and do a proper release.  The film, which is very curious and great, deserves a whole lot better!",1330905600,33,954,4.709090909090909
2451490,5,B000C0GV5Q,"It's Fellini, so of course it's very good.  But I couldn't tell when I ordered this made-on-demand release whether the DVD transfer was 'letterboxed' or true widescreen.  It is true widescreen, and a nice transfer with very good image quality.  I think now only Fellini's 'La voce della luna' remains unavailable on DVD.  I hope someone is able to remedy that absence soon.",1325721600,4,373,4.873015873015873
2451491,4,B000C0GV5Q,"After reading about this film for years but having it never been widely or easily available, I finally caught up with it.  I had seen most of Fellini's other more ""popular"" works and Casanova seemed to be considered a failure, too expensive, compromised in its production and editing (shot in English learned phonetically, ran out of money).  It is also later in his career, and a meditation on age, waning fame and sexual prowess, a kind of self-reflexive film Fellini had been doing since ""8 1/2"" and through the '70s (""Roma"" and ""Intervista"" seem clearly about being Fellini as much as the places they take as subjects, also ""Director's Notebook"").

Viewed, finally, in context ""Casanova"" is a nice mid-point between the stylish alter-realities of ""Satyricon"" and ""Juliet of the Spirits"" and the smaller yearnings about age, love and mortality such as ""City of Women"" and ""Ginger and Fred.""  This expensive and surprisingly dour epic, beautiful as always but deeply melancholy, is the glue holding Fellini's loose fantasies and unbridled power to the later anxiety over television, memory, and yearning for a prior age that may never have been (his Venice is not near to the real one, except as a dream-state replication).  Sutherland's sweaty neediness, silent and smoldering glares and sore back suggest a defeated glamour that is strangely sexless, reduced to mechanical (literally) reenactment of the basest human activity, sexual union, performed for unsure, dishonest or forgotten reasons.

This subtext, considering Fellini's subsequent engagements with orchestra rehearsals on ships, dancing partners on television shows, and dreamers who fly away to the moon, inform ""Casanova"" as an important late-career highlight, with an autobiographical element of an artist whose out of favor, going through the motions, able to please others if not himself. That this film seems to foreground the character Casanova's self-loathing (unlike most of Fellini's others - he ""loves the sinner, hates the sin"") makes this feel too cynical, baroque, no fun, not as effervescent as many others.  Still, essential.",1323993600,2,2107,5.347432024169184
2451492,4,B000C0GV5Q,"This is one of the darkest, if not the darkest, of Fellini's films, and also one of the most beautiful.  With ""Casanova"", Fellini transplanted ""Satyricon"" into 18th century Europe.  The sets, sumptuous and stunning, are peopled with visually flambuoyant characters in whichever court or city Casanova happens to be stationed in.  The stormy sea made of black plastic sheets, which Casanova rows across, is genius!  Owls are featured as set pieces; the ""owl music box"" in particular, functions as a voyeur of Casanova's various sex scenes.  The over-the-top eroticism is completely appropriate for the Swinging Seventies, although I imagine there would have been ""censorship issues"" connected with this picture's release in the USA.  Donald Sutherland is an androgynous Casanova, whose bemused expression reminds me of Tim Curry in ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show""; ""Casanova"" is a great showcase for Sutherland, especially when one sees the contrast between the young, confident Casanova, and the old, embittered one.  As Casanova proceeds further into Northern Europe, aging in the process, the atmosphere of the film turns colder, grayer, and snowier.  He encounters his cruel, disabled mother in Dresden, who complains that he has neglected her, and that he lives in a fool's paradise.  His mother is as ghostly as Dicken's Miss Havisham, in this scene that could be seen as a hallucination, or as a daytime nightmare.

After the cursed encounter with his mother, the last 27 minutes of the picture become increasingly depressing.  Casanova takes up residence in several wild, dysfunctional Northern European courts in Germany, Norway and Sweden.  In the process, he becomes a man who is mocked, derided, and disrespected.  Despite his many amorous encounters and occasional romantic relationships, he ends up old and alone, with only his fantasies; in particular the fantasy of Rosalba, the anatomically-correct real-life size female doll.  Rosalba represents the return of the repressed, elucidating Casanova's obsession with sex as sport; he pays the price for choosing the sensual life over the intellectual life.  The connection between Casanova's cruel, unloving mother, and the mechanical doll, is obvious: Rosalba is Casanova's mother (the two of actually them resemble each other).  The end of this film is both sad and creepy; the lesson here, in Casanova's case, is ""be careful what you wish for"".  The strange and haunting score was composed by Fellini's longtime collaborator, maestro Nino Rota; it features an abundance of minor keys and mournful, melancholy melodies with a generous garnish of whimsy.

2451493,5,B000C0GV5Q,"From this hilarious movie you get this impression that during Casanova's time well-documented sexual prowess played the same role as an MBA in today's world in getting your foot in the door.  Indeed Sutherland's Casanova does not seem so much a libertine or great lover as a career-minded opportunist.  In one of the first scenes the title character engages in a tryst for the amusement of a voyeuristic patron--whose prying eye can be seen peering through a partition.  After completing this particular dalliance, Casanova turns to the watching eye and delivers the hardest of sells to his patron--doing his best to trumpet his expertise in such things as engineering and military strategy--as if this command performance served as a sort of resume.

In another scene Casanova takes the opportunity to exhibit his abilities at an elegant gathering of the cream of society.  In response to someone's ignorant claim that sexual endurance is principally the province of the young and the athletic, Casanova elects to prove this statement to be utter nonsense.  He chooses to compete against a strong young man servant--with the young man paired with a worldly aristocratic woman of consummate skill.  Casanova chooses as his partner an unsophisticated servant girl.  In the end, it is no contest at all--with Casanova still going at it after the boy has collapsed from exhaustion on top on the rather frustrated fine lady.  After winning this contest Casanova makes the best of yet another opportunity, explaining that abilities such as his are only accessible to polymaths such as himself who include disciplines such as the physics of fluids among the fields that they have mastered.",1302566400,2,1683,5.135531135531136
