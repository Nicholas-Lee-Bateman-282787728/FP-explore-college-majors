8059235,3,B0009E27SA,"The title is certainly misleading, but it should not dissuade one from giving it a try, as it is not a bad film for its genre. The film effectively avoids over-the-top anti-Nazi propganda in favor of a more low-keyed appoach. Like other films of its kind, it is particularly interesting to see how the anti-Nazi propaganda subject matter is handled in light of the year it was made, 1944, i.e., before the war was over. Some of the production values, especially the outstanding balck-and-white cinematography, are suprisingly good for a low budget film.",1352937600,,553,4.956989247311828
8059236,4,B0009E27SA,"Interesting little Monogram film loosely based of the life of Dr. Paul Joseph Goebbels.  The film attempts to look at
Dr. Goebbels with a psychological twist.  The Roan DVD is of perfectly acceptable quality.  The print, however, uses a title card from the Film Classics re-issue.",1259712000,,280,5.043478260869565
