5722159,5,B00CH6KVZE,Thanks to my almost 2 yr old son I know all the engines by name and the Thomas theme song by heart.  I enjoy all Thomas episodes .... Choo choo,1398556800,,143,3.7666666666666666
5722160,5,B00CH6KVZE,"One thing remains true for Thomas and Friends...they never disappoint. Thomas and Friends have been around for a long time, but they never seem to grow old. My three-year-old is a big Thomas fan, and I've been wondering when he will outgrow it. However, he never seems to lose interest. We love connecting train tracks and using the different character trains to make stories and create adventures on the railway. My six-year-old thinks he is too old to watch Thomas and build and play with the tracks, but I catch him playing with Thomas and pausing his playtime to watch Thomas often. There are always new stories being created on DVD, and as a parent, I love the lessons that each story brings.

The ""Railway Mischief"" is a great lesson for kids. It proves that listening is a key component in making life easy! The friends join together and Gordon and Cranky refuse to listen to the advice of their friends. This often happens, not just in kids, but in adults as well. We think as individuals, that we know how to do things best and that our way is always the right way. This DVD is great for kids because as a young child, they want things to be done their way.

My oldest son is very focused on making sure he does the right thing. He asks advice and seeks direction in almost everything he does. He is by the book and wants to always follow the rules. My youngest son couldn't be more opposite. He is like Gordon or Cranky, and wants to do things his way. He doesn't want to listen to others advice. It doesn't make him wrong, they are just different in their personalities. The lesson in this DVD teaches that sometimes, it's best to work together and listen to the advice of others. It was fun to discuss the lesson being shown in this DVD with my youngest. He agreed that things would have gone better if they trains would would listened to the advice of others.

The fun of this Thomas and Friends doesn't end with just the stories. There's Bonus Features that include ""Sodor Hide and Seek, Guess Who Puzzles?, Fun and Activities with Driver Perkins, and All You Need Are Friends Music Video."" My boys loved the Music Video. We watched it numerous times and I often find myself singing the song to myself around the house. :)

If you have a Thomas fan in your house, you'll want to pick up, ""Railway Mischief."" It's a fun video to watch for all ages.",1397433600,,2361,4.445727482678984

5722186,4,B00CH6KVZE,"My nearly-two year old loves the Thomas episodes. We watch them independently on PBS, but also stream them via Netflix and Amazon Instant. This is a great collection of newer episodes, and introduces two new characters (Stafford and Winston).

This collection includes:
Gordon Runs Dry - Diesel and Gordon avoid a serious accident, but Gordon is struck by some slate that flies out of the car Diesel is pulling behind him. Gordon thinks he's invincible, and ignores the fact that his boiler keeps running dry. He learns that big, strong engines can need help.

Kevin's Cranky Friend - Cranky is having an unusually busy day at the docks, and Sir Topham Hatt sends an enthusiastic Kevin to the docks to help. Cranky is rude, condescending and downright hateful to Kevin when all Kevin does is try to help. Cranky later relents, but never actually apologizes for his behavior. I think that's a huge misstep by the writers of this episode, so I'm docking a star for that. Bad behavior, especially unwarranted bad behavior, should never be condoned, not when the audience is primarily impressionable, young children who idolize these characters. It is a great teaching point for parents to point out that Cranky doesn't apologize, and walk their children through what he should have said to Kevin.

Scruff's Makeover - Scruff is rusting so Sir Topham Hatt orders him repainted. Scruff is, at first, reluctant to be cleaned and repainted but when the other engines compliment him, he decides he can't work at the waste dump with Whiff anymore because he doesn't want to get dirty again. He spends the remainder of the episode trying to find where he fits in on the island. A good lesson to kids about how ""the clothes don't make the man"" or ""it's what's inside that really matters.""

Wayward Winston - Sir Topham Hatt and his new car, Winston, are having trouble working together to drive smoothly along the tracks. Winston gets teased by the other engines for his bumpy driving, and Winston decides he wants to see what it's like to be without a driver. When Sir Topham Hatt gets out and forget to put on the brake, Winston takes off on his own around the island. After nearly causing a couple of serious accidents, he realizes the drivers and cars/engines need each other.

Steamie Stafford - Stafford notices the children seem to enjoy the puffs, chugs, whistles and wheeshes the engines make all over the island. He decides he wants to be like the other engines, and he has them teach him their signature sounds. Later, he is sent on a special to Farmer McColl's, making quite a racket along the way. When he frightens the sheep, he learns that he is valuable and appreciated just the way he is.

Mr. Perkins' Clips- In the scenes with Mr. Perkins in the Engine Driver's Common Room, Mr. Perkins is preparing to stand in for Mr. Arkwright as referee for the annual Engine Driver's soccer match. He spends the time between episodes gathering his gear and searching for a whistle, finally asking Thomas if he'll use his train whistle because Mr. Perkins can't find a traditional referee whistle.",1404086400,3,3092,4.780898876404494
