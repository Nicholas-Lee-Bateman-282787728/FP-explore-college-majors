2470454,3,B000CR8QRU,"The comedy is nice, but after some time it is bit of the same thing- picking on different nationalities. Even Outsourced is the same thing. More than watching it on DVD, I think having it on CD and listening to it in the car, after a long day at office, would be a better idea.",1175644800,,277,4.054545454545455
2470455,1,B000CR8QRU,As the previous reviewer mentioned:  this is *unlicensed* material and RP gets NO money from it.  Please don't purchase this if you wish to support the artist!,1162598400,52,159,4.851851851851852
2470456,1,B000CR8QRU,"Russell Peters is without a doubt one of the funniest mainstream comedians around; if you agree with this statement at all do not buy this DVD. Not only is this an unlicensed DVD (that's right, Peters' permission was never given, if you ever go to one of his stand up shows he makes sure to mention it) but it looks like some 11 year child manufactured it using a dot matrix printer. The CD looks like something that was labeled using a ""CD Stomper"" and the cover for the case is such poor quality that you can almost see the pixels in the Amazon pictures. The DVD itself is shoddily done, and overall looks like a two dollar production (or less).

If you are fan at all of Russell Peters, show support and buy the licensed DVD, not this rip off piece of garbage. I am disgusted that I didn't know sooner and actually purchased one of these DVDs.",1158624000,66,846,4.320754716981132
2470457,5,B000CR8QRU,"You may have seen the Comedy Now routine on the Net. The Comedy Now segment is better than the first segment in the DVD. I can't get enough of the Comedy Now segment, so the DVD was a good purchase for me. I'm Indian, born and raised in western culture, so I can completely relate to all of the material. Even if you're not indian, the material is totally funny and makes fund of a lot of cultures, so he is fair to all :)

Another DVD is scheduled to come out in September, RUSSELL PETERS: OUTSOURCED, looking forward to it. Check out: [...]",1148601600,6,542,4.211538461538462
2470458,4,B000CR8QRU,"The bulk of his act is about race jokes so if you're a little sensitive to that subject, consider this a warning. But personally I think he knows his boundaries and I don't think he crossed any lines. In fact I think he is one of the ""tamer"" stand up comics. I don't remember any unnecessary swearing and the sex jokes were minimal and discreet. And he has such an innocent and childlike ""everyman"" quality about him that I find appealing, just like Ray Romano and Jerry Seinfeld.

Grade: B+",1146441600,8,491,4.455555555555556
2470459,5,B000CR8QRU,"The first time I saw Russell Peters on Comedy Now I couldn't stop laughing -- actually, I don't even think I've laughed harder.  This DVD is fantastic for fans of his work and believe me, it just gets better everytime you watch it!  I always say that a good comedian (scratch that, a great comedian!) who makes jokes of his own culture (including other cultures) is one that stands out above others.  Russell is definitely one of those comedians!

Noooooooooooooo...Indiano!",1143072000,8,474,4.8875
2470460,1,B000CR8QRU,"This DVD has been produced WITHOUT RP's permission or knowledge. I am disgusted that Amazon, which I thought was a credible source that only sold legitimate products, is selling this. I bought the DVD without knowing any of this, and immediately called Amazon and asked for a FULL refund (not a partial refund like they tried to give me initially).",1267833600,,348,4.816666666666666
2470461,4,B000CR8QRU,"If you are Indian, you have to watch this comic. His observations are dead on and he will hit home...The Chinese and the Indian bit is the most funny but the entire show is funny and watchable.",1259971200,,193,4.243243243243243
2470462,1,B000CR8QRU,"I absolutely LOVE Russell Peters and that is why I would never buy this dvd.  This is an unlicensed DVD and Peters never gave permission for it to be manufactured.  If you want to support him, buy his other DVDs like ""Red, White, and Brown""--it is hilarious.",1227484800,,258,4.468085106382978
2470463,5,B000CR8QRU,"I first heard of Russell Peters when he performed in Singapore and quickly found snippets of his performance on YouTube. I fell in love with his comedy from the first time I saw it. This DVD is no different. He is amazing in his style and candid in his remarks - hallmarks of a great stand-up comedian.

Unlike Outsourced which is his most recent DVD, this title contains 2 of his performances (which is great - more bang for the buck). Both performances are fantastic though you will find that some of his jokes are recycled and repackaged in different forms, which is not uncommon for stand-up comedy.

That said, Russell Peters is hilarious, enchanting and totally engaging. I really enjoyed watching this DVD and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a hearty laugh and an overall good time (in the comfort of your living room). Well done, Russell!!

NOTE: From what I understand, this DVD isn't an ""official"" release by Russell Peters (unlike Outsourced). This has obviously caused problems, and I would recommend that people get Outsourced. Aside from that, this DVD is still a great watch if you're a fan of Russell Peters. It's a pity that he doesn't reap the rewards of this DVD since the performances are to-die-for!",1221350400,2,1236,4.73953488372093
2470464,5,B000CR8QRU,Definitely on my SHORT list of best comedies.  Having worked and become friends with various ethnic groups Russel Peters really nailed the impressions.  We need to find joy in our differences.  Thank you so much!,1218412800,,212,5.0
2470465,3,B000CR8QRU,"I have both this dvd and Outsourced. As with most comics, Russell Peters gets better with age. Outsourced has stronger material so if you're only planning to buy one dvd, get Outsourced. However, with 90 minutes of Russell Peters on this dvd, it is a good value and worth buying if you're enjoying Outsourced and want more.

As far as the royalties issue goes, I am personally disgusted with Russell Peters for using his fans to get revenge against the company that put out this dvd. Leave the fans out of your legal battles. It's not our fault.",1209945600,,545,4.561224489795919
2470466,5,B000CR8QRU,"Being of Indian origin and growing up in Canada, Russell Peters' comedy is even more funny to me.  As Russell says, Indian's like to hang on to their money so this is a great value two DVD's for the price of one.  This DVD is loaded with great ethnic humor tastefully done.  I would highly recommend this product.  So ""Be A Man"" and order it today ""or somebody gonna get hurt.""  This DVD contains two of his concerts on one DVD.  This is good original humor.",1207872000,,458,4.267441860465116
2470467,5,B000CR8QRU,"In not too many words and I don't need to convince anyone to purchase this, but Russel Peters is too good! Very good sense of humor, there are no dull moments, this dvd reminded me more or less of Eddie Murphy's Raw back in the days, with a touch of Indian flavor! ;)",1195776000,,267,4.056603773584905
2470468,2,B000CR8QRU,"i am a huge russell peters fan, ive seen him in both canada and washington d.c., and i must say i was really disappointed with these older shows, they just didn't measure up to the level ive come to expect from him...if you're a fan stick with the outsourced dvd and his newer material, this just isn't worth the money",1179705600,15,318,4.316666666666666
2470469,5,B000CR8QRU,"This guy is funnier than anyone one Ive ever seen, only problem I had was I had to keep inviting all my friends over to watch the DVD.",1175817600,,134,3.8214285714285716

8100945,5,B000CR8QRU,Russel peter is by far the funniest comeidans that have come from canada. this is the first dvd i have bought and he is really funny. if u ever get a chance u should check him out.,1344038400,,180,3.891891891891892
8100946,5,B000CR8QRU,I never get tired of this show. highly recommended. Truly the best Russel Peters video out there. Extremely funny! you will not be disappointed.,1333670400,,144,5.041666666666667
8100947,4,B000CR8QRU,"This is Russell Peter's older comedy routine. It's not as funny as Outsourced. If you're a fan, then you probably wouldn't mind spending extra money to see this too.",1286323200,,165,4.724137931034483
8100948,4,B000CR8QRU,I haven't laughed this hard since Eddie Murphy!  Russell Peters does a perfect Chinese and African accent.  lmao.  Russell and Ali G have to be my favorite modern comedians.,1285632000,,173,4.896551724137931
8100949,4,B000CR8QRU,"If you're an Indian then you'll truly get the full humour behind his comedy.  If you're familiar with Indians, then you'll definitely get good laughs.  If you don't know anything about Indians, then you better get to know one -- otherwise you won't understand why his humour is totally on the mark!

This DVD captures his earlier material where he talks about his parents.  This material is just totally hysterical.  He's still a bit vulgar but only here and there.  His newer DVDs contain far more vulgarity.

The fact that he can so accurately capture various ethnic accents is just amazing.  Definitely worth your time and money.",1279670400,,632,4.841121495327103
