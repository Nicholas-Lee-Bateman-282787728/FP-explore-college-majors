8175395,1,B000N6UF3I,Actually the CD is quite humorous. It doesn't prepare you for anything and lacks structure. You could go on YouTube and find more useful material and more comical stuff.

8175396,5,B000N6UF3I,"This is a detailed video that is helpful for any person who will be a witness in a deposition, or a witness in court. Clear and even with a little bit of humor. Great for putting witnesses at ease. I regularly offer this to my clients and witnesses to help them with deposition prep.",1271894400,3,283,4.2592592592592595
