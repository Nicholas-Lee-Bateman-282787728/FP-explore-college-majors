2711400,4,B000LP5D4C,"****Note: This review is for the LEGEND release&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Little-Rascals-Best-of-Our-Gang/dp/B000LP5D4C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Little Rascals: Best of Our Gang</a>, not the 3-D release that Amazon has grouped it under****
I give this only **** four stars because most of these films have already been released on DVD restored from 35mm.  There is little new here.

The thought is that kids won't watch B&W films, so lets COLORIZE The Litle Rascals.  Purists can watch this in B&W also, which is good since the colorization looks cartoony & unnatural.

I just could not pass up the extras that are included on these DVDs.

BEST OF OUR GANG has
Alfalfa short soundie ""The Singing Lesson"",
Broadway Highlights short clip of Pete the Pup becoming a member of a entertainment night club,
""You Asked For It"" clip of the segment with the OUR GANG REUNION showing the silent stars (Jackie Condon, Joe Cobb, Farina & others) as they are in 1955.
Our Gang clip from ""The Stolen Jewels"" ( o.k. this is the only clip un necessary as the complete short is widely available ).

Oh, yes.. there are the comedy shorts.  These are all from 35mm 1950's RE-ISSUE PRINTS, not the same MGM transfers as the Cabin Fever / Hallmark DVDs.  But they are 35mm prints and they look very good.  There is a variety of title sections representing almost every company that re-issued these shorts in 35mm, including Official Films which I never knew made 35mm prints.

BEST OF OUR GANG
""FLY MY KITE"" - Official 'Famous Kids' titles - The rascals help Grandma save her property from the evil banker.

""A LAD IN A LAMP"" - ERKO 'Kids 'n Pets' titles  (1st time on DVD?)- Spanky & the gang find a 'magic lamp'. Spanky whishes Buckwheat was a monkey and thinks his wish came true when a real monkey comes in (there is always one around in a Little Rascals comedy).

""KID FROM BORNEO"" - Monogram titles - a short that has been long banned from television due to racial jokes & the main character being a wild man from borneo who goes around saying ""Yum , Yum , Eat'em Up"" while chasing Spanky & the gang.  It is unlikely that Hallmark will do an official release of this on their DVD sets, so you might want to consider this if you don't have the old Cabin Fever videos.

""HI! NEIGHBOR"" - Allied Artists titles - The gang gets a new neighbor, who owns a shiny new kiddie firetruck.

""HIDE & SHRIEK"" - Official 'Famous Kids' titles - another classic featured on this disc starring Alfalfa, Buckweat & Porky.  Alfalfa plays a sherlock holmes type of detective and hires Buckweat & Porky to investigate some missing candy.

The shorts are offered in both Colorized & original B&W restored versions, but switching back & forth while playing the short is not possible.  The bonus material is B&W only.",1170979200,17,2836,4.822314049586777

it a great trip down early early California (1930's)  Already 80 years old,
the stories are contrived but amusing and still fun to watch.",1427328000,4,205,4.666666666666667

2711464,5,B000LP5D4C,"I'm a baby-boomer who grew up on the Little Rascals.  I already had a DVD album with all the stories this one provides.  But this was a delight to watch.  It has a great selection of stories, some all-time favorites.

I ordered it for the 3-D effect, and was not disappointed!  The conversion is virtually flawless, done by the same folks who translated Cameron's original Titanic movie into an impeccable 3-D version.  This is the kind of 3-D that just makes the subject matter seem real, not exaggerated and gimmicky, as seen on some cheap post-production conversions.

I was surprised that these films had also been colorized.  In the 1990s, I was not enthusiastic about the blurry colorizing of classic B/W films.  But, again, this time it was done in a terrifically crisp yet understated manner that let the film images retain their ""antique"" look, but still added life to the experience.

With 3-D and color, these stories that I had seen dozens of times before again seemed new and almost current. People seemed ""alive,"" rather than iconic, really. I know my grandchildren found them much more interesting that my old B/W 2-D versions!

Great addition to my 3-D library!  Lots of fun to reconnect with those Little Rascals.",1425254400,8,1230,4.832535885167464
2711465,4,B000LP5D4C,3D was OK but fun to see in color.  Should do more,1424476800,2,50,3.1666666666666665

2711490,5,B000LP5D4C,Not a fan of colorization but this looks great in color and 3d. The only one I didn't like was the one with Alfalfa...never cared for him...read that he was a prima Donna on the set. My favorites are the earlier shorts with Stymie and a very young Spanky.,1418428800,2,255,4.224489795918367

2711494,5,B000LP5D4C,"I am so tired in reading misleading outdated reviews which are usually filled with unfortunate experiences.  Most of the time their equipment is not performing, mismatched and out of sync.
Once you have all the proper matched equipment your 3D visual experience will be awesome and exciting. This means ALL stereoscopic 3D Blu-ray movies will be perfectly presented as this Little Rascals is!!!!

NOTE:  The following suggestions are;  Having a matching FULL HD 3D Blu-ray system to include; TV, Player, Glasses, HDMI and Optical Cables.  For perfect syncing a direct connection is preferred.  Glasses are the most important component since this syncs the entire 3D system experience. ( my personal choice is SainSonic SSZ-200DLB 144hz 3D Active Shutter Glasses. These have a right/left dominant eye switch. A most important option for the 3D effect)

So once you have the handle on your 3D matched system you will always get this outstanding visual stereoscopic experience.

The Little Rascals are awesome believe me!!!!  I love the 3D effect and colorization too!!!!",1401148800,6,1068,5.272189349112426

2711496,5,B000LP5D4C,The Little Rascals are part of my childhood memories as we ate dinner and watched them every chance we got.

2711498,2,B000LP5D4C,the one thing I liked was that it was in color . it gives you an idea of how the comedy was like in the 1940s and what they used,1387929600,,128,3.3
2711499,5,B000LP5D4C,I used to watch these shorts on TV as a youngster. To see them presented in such lifelike colour and 3D is an extraordinary experience. Recommended.,1368144000,4,148,4.730769230769231
2711510,5,B000LP5D4C,"I bought this even though I don't have a 3-D player or TV.  It still plays and looks excellent.  They've been colorized, but Legend Films does an excellent job.  They use the best transfers.  They look very clean and sharp.  It seems they've done extensive cleaning.  You get 5 shorts:  Kid From Borneo, Hide and Shriek, Hi, Neighbor, Aladdin's Lamp, and Fly My Kite.  They're all 20 minutes, except for Hide and Shriek which is 10 minutes.  I hope they release more on Bluray.  This is a bare-bones release, but at about 3 bucks a short, it's worth it.",1360022400,2,553,4.494949494949495
2711511,3,B000LP5D4C,"Much 3D effect had to be looked for to be seen.  Once I'd relax and get into just watching the movie I didn't care because the old footage looked so good ... much better than another ""Little Rascals"" set in my collection.  But then a scene would pop in 3D and it was, ""Oh hey look there's 3D!""  so it became more of a distraction than enhancement.

This is one I'd not recommend for it's 3D, but of the episodes I've looked at so far have been very good for overall picture quality and I enjoyed seeing ""Our Gang"" yet again.",1358121600,3,524,4.158415841584159

2711514,3,B000LP5D4C,I bought this (even though I already owned it in 2D) because of the 3D release. I am somewhat disappointed in the 3D release. The effect is very mundane. No real depth to speak of. I would stay way from this unless your a 3D fanatic.,1356566400,3,233,4.086956521739131

2711516,4,B000LP5D4C,"Viewing this disc returned me to my childhood. I felt ten again, watching the TV on a lazy Summer afternoon. But, in CoLoR & 3D. WOW! They did a great job of creating a realistic depth of field. It felt natural. I had not seen any of the 5 episodes featured. Yes, the Little Rascals were corney and a bit predictable. I love the silly accidental way that they have of getting out of a jamb. It wasn't intended to be serious. After all it was during the depression Era. The kids were dirt poor but didn't let that get them down. They were the Kings of recycling and innovation. This disc is great fun for kids and parents alike. Don't foget to throw some popcorn around the room.",1355356800,4,678,4.263565891472868
