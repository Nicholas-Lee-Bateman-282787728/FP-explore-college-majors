Like all features and cartoons released during the lengthy ASCAP strike, ""In Old Chicago"" relies for music on such public domain chestnuts as ""Oh Genevieve,"" ""The Irish Washerwoman"" and ""Rally 'Round the Flag, Boys.""

Set in 1871, a fictional drama of the O'Leary family unfolds while we wait for the family's skittish cow to kick over that lantern. This small barn fire culminates in the destruction of a major portion of the city from an all-engulfing inferno. Really spectacular fire sequences still boggle the mind fully 70 years later. IMO, Tyrone Power's best and a most enjoyable FOX motion picture.

Note: it's surprising that ""In Old Chicago"" has yet to be remade!",1267142400,,1276,5.881081081081081
8337639,4,B001RAWG1I,"With more than a passing nod to M-G-M's blockbuster smash of 1936 ""San Francisco"", IN OLD CHICAGO details the events leading up to the famous fire of 1871. Twentieth Century-Fox assembled three of their most bankable stars of 1939 (following their roles in ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" the previous year) for this historical romp, and the production values were lavish (highlighted by the climactic and harrowing 20-minute sequence of the fire itself, which required it's very own film and production unit).

The O'Leary boys, Dion (Tyrone Power) and Jack (Don Ameche) make and break their fortunes in the bustling city of Chicago. Good boy Jack plays fair and settles for whatever he can get; while Dion fights, cajoles and charms his way to the top. Alice Faye plays Dion's beautiful wife, saloon singer Belle Fawcett. Alice Brady turns in an Oscar-winning performance as Mrs O'Leary, whose cow unwittingly sets the fire in motion.

Alice Faye dazzles in her sparkling costumes and gowns (designed by Royer), and sings a selection of period numbers. Tyrone Power is as handsome as always; and the supporting cast includes Phyllis Brooks, Brian Donlevy, Tom Brown, and Sidney Blackmer. Based on the novel ""We the O'Learys'"" by Niven Busch.",1242172800,2,1238,5.123762376237623
