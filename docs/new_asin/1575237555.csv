195797,1,1575237555,The only problems with the movie is where is the mummy ?  also for fans of Richard Karn you can see him shirtless ! this movie is wannabe that is seemed to go more the erotic than actually have a mummy in it! It's Ok for  a rental in either DVD or VHS!,955929600,2,252,3.7358490566037736
195798,1,1575237555,"This was one of the wrose movies I have ever seen. The acting was terrible, script worse and the effects terrible. Do yourself a favour do not buy this DVD, the picture quality and sound are also below par. A very  bad film on a very bad disk. Amazon are generous with a 1 star limit.",949881600,3,284,4.071428571428571
195799,1,1575237555,"Spurred on by previous experience with 'Bram Stoker's Dracula', we elected to rent this title (thankfully, we didn't purchase it).
The most artful aspect of this movie is the cover illustration. The plot was painfully  predictable, the acting was soap opera quality (shallow, transparent  characters), the special effects were sadly lacking. The complaints that my  family continually uttered were the only thing that kept me awake.
If you  expect a movie similar to the quality of 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' - don't  waste your time here. By comparison, 'Army of Darkness' was a true classic.",942105600,11,590,5.23404255319149
195800,1,1575237555,This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  The plot makes no sense and the actors seem to have never rehearsed any scene.  I'm amazed tripe like this can even get released.,930528000,,180,4.114285714285714

7798786,2,1575237555,"Everyone seems to have trouble translating the book to film. They tried first with Blood from the Mummy's Tomb and The Awakening. Each has its shortfalls. However this was the worst rendition. I suspect the producers never read the book and through in everything but the kitchen sink. I even saw pieces of Cat Creature.

The film was so busy trying to cram so many goofy effects in to each minute that they forgot there is a plotline.

It was fun watching the different actors trying to keep a straight face.

I am going to say something I hate to see in reviews. Read the book first then the film will make more sense.

7798788,1,1575237555,"I don't expect a cinematic masterpiece from a movie like ""Legend of the Mummy"", but I do expect to be entertained. This movie failed to deliver. Marketed as a horror movie, it's mostly a mystery with horror elements, and its main problem is the script. The plot is a barely coherent mess and there's absolutely no suspense or anything even remotely interesting going on in the movie. It's just boring. Not recommended.",1320451200,,418,4.819444444444445
7798789,1,1575237555,"Rather poorly done flick about a mummy's resurrection and the curse that was on anyone finding or disturbing it. Sound familiar?  Boring with little action and a rather disjointed plot line. Louis Gossett, Jr. is the only member of the cast you may have heard off and he was not the lead.  Suspect he regretted making this flick.  Save your money.",1297555200,,347,4.655737704918033
7798790,1,1575237555,"Okay, folks, please indulge me....if I provide the right context, you might thoroughly understand why the title of this review is oh, so apropos!!

...okay, so it was a crisp, foggy, rainy, windy San Francisco Sunday morning....one of those mornings where you awoke, looked outa the window and immediately knew you would deservedly luxuriate in bed after a loooooooong week....this was the perfect time to catch up on some old movies I had been meaning to watch/may have missed....I had passed by Bram Stoker's The Mummy on guide listings, each time wondering, ""why haven't I heard of this before?"" all because the natural assumption was that it was somehow remotely connected to Bram Stoker's Dracula...at least in terms of production values.....nothing could be further from the truth...

....I should have paid attention to the sinking feeling in the pit of my gut when in the beginning of the film we are set in Marin, California.....MARIN?!??!!!...what on EARTH does Northern California have to do with Bram Stoker??!!?.....folks, it was all downhill from there....

....okay, so I relaxed and thought, hmmm, set in San Francisco...this oughta be fun...(well, for lack of a better word/phrase....)

The movie is absolutely horrible....so horrible in fact, that I could not even turn away from it...AND I HAD THE REMOTE RIGHT THERE IN BED WITH ME!!!....I suppose I kept thinking, well, Lou Gossett is in it...how bad can it be?.....

Lou, a dubiously celebrated archaeologist (with an ever-present flask), carried off the role with aplomb and MUCH overacting, and was probably actually drinking during the production...I dearly love Lou, but I could NOT stop laughing at his performance here...and the guy who was the sidekick on ""Home Improvement"" and the face of Orchard Supply there for a while, (yeah, the cute bear) was humorous enough...however, the most interesting part of his performance, HANDS DOWN, is that the very last time the audience sees him, he is having a ""spasm' or ""seizure"" of sorts, presumably from a curse and his last words were ""I gotta get some fresh air!!!"" and he RUNS OFF!!....NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN....I tell ya, I lost it!!!...

The leading man and woman were absolutely horrible.  The script was absolutely horrible.  The acting was absolutely horrible.  The plot was absolutely horrible.  I googled Bram Stoker to find out if indeed there even WAS a Bram Stoker's ""Mummy"" and haven't found anything he's written with that title...yet...

But for some ungodly reason I watched it until the end...at least some of the shots of the city, i.e. the Chronicle truck, the obligatory cable cars, (wow, no Golden Gate Bridge shot) were somewhat accurate...

This movie was so bad, I might add it to my collection...it was hysterical in its absurdity and if I can include the Toxic Avenger (I. II AND III!!!) I can certainly have an over-the-top Lou Gossett warding off the curse of whatshisname!!!

I laughed until I cried...perhaps it was because of the glass(es) of white zinfandel I sipped while watching...(..hey, lay off..I'm a Raider fan, whaddaya want!!)",1203897600,,3090,5.08300395256917
7798791,3,1575237555,"Lou Gossett, Jr.----didn't he win an Academy award for OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN?  Hmmm...think of F. Murray Abraham, Ben Kingsley, and others who after winning their awards ended up second bananas in rather trifling movies.  Lou joins the lot, and overacts so badly, he should really be ashamed of himself.  But, he's not the only bad thing in this movie.  Based on a Bram Stoker story, this version is handsomely mounted, but at times is so confusing, one never really knows what's going on.  Eric Lutes is an engaging hero, but sometimes he looks like he doesn't know what he's supposed to be doing; Amy Locane is luscious, but doesn't possess the range to go from the darling daughter to the vindictive mummy; Mark Lindsay Chapman who used to claim ""Dallas"" as his home, is laughably agreeable as the private investigator who gets bugged to death.  Lloyd Bochner is wasted in his small role, and the whole movie seems thrown together, rather than orchestrated.  Not a truly bad movie, but not a truly good one, either.",1080777600,2,1020,4.761363636363637
7798792,3,1575237555,"Faithful third film adaptation of Bram Stoker's The Jewel Of Seven Stars (following Blood From the Mummy's Tomb and The Awakening) doesn't deliver all it promises, but it delivers enough to be worth watching.
Archaeologist Lloyd Bochner is attacked in his locked study, and has left very specific instructions about how he is to be guarded while unconscious - the attack plainly did not surprise him too much, and police inspector Mark Lindsey Chapman wants to know why. Chapman thinks Bochner's estranged daughter, Amy Locane, had something to do with it. His suspicions aren't helped any when other people in the household begin suffering accidents, and Locane always just happens to be the only one nearby.
Locane and her Egyptology student boyfriend seek out Bochner's old colleague Louis Gosset, Jr., presently an outpatient at the local asylum. Gosset was with Bochner when he made his most stupendous find in Egypt, the tomb of Tara, a sorceress queen so feared that her name was erased from history. He knows - as does Bochner - that the attack was somehow engineered by Tara's ancient black magic, and that there's more where that came from...
The production on this movie is really quite handsome. It's dark and rich and colorful, with a wonderfully atmospheric music score. The sets and set pieces seem more authentic than usual for this kind of film. The performances range from good to adequate. The script is actually pretty decent, and the style refreshingly low-key (though there are a couple of splashy special-effects lapses). It's rather slow, and stretches credibility a bit, but you have to expect that in a movie with dusty mummies walking around strangling people - and the mummy is pretty creepy, at that.
All three versions of this story are pretty good. This isn't the best, but it's imminently watchable and attractively packaged throughout.",1024099200,6,1868,5.048543689320389
7798793,1,1575237555,"first and for-most Bram Stocker did not write the mummy, so this is not his story. This is just a ploy to get you to watch this if you liked the Dracula title. This is a crappy way to get people to watch a movie. Maybe they should have called the move, ""A Crappy Ploy to Rip Off the Ignorant"" Bad movie, nothing origional. Donot waste your money.",989539200,2,346,4.102941176470588
7798794,1,1575237555,"Unless you can laugh along at horror schlock, are a huge fan of Louis Gossett Jr., or are a fan of Richard Karn (Al from ""Home Improvement""), you probably will not like this movie at all. It drags along at a pace slower than a snail in hibernation. The dialogue is really, really, bad. This is one of those movies that you know that the only reason the actors, directors, producers, and anyone else associated with the film did it was because of the money. Richard Karn provides a few laughs as a swinging, single, archeologist and LG Jr is a bit frightening at times (not because of his character, but because of his over-emoting). However, most of the time everyone in the film have these ""how did I end up here"" or ""I can't wait until I'm done with this"" looks on their faces. By the way, did I mention there really isn't much plot until half-way through the film? What makes this film worse is that it actually portrays itself as a serious scary movie. Give me a break! Roger Corman knew he was making schlock and Ed Wood really did believe he was making good movies. The makers of this film can't plead either case. All in all don't waste your time with this film, rent some other mummy movie.",982800000,6,1198,4.376681614349776
