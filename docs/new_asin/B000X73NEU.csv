I will go for a holiday in Mongolia maybe next year in the summer break to have a look and find out how great he was.",1408320000,,252,4.163265306122449
8257896,5,B000X73NEU,"... Maybe some things are not meant to be found...
is the line that is left out of this movie. But then, maybe some journeys are not meant for the world, but for the interior journey. This is the story of the search for Genghis Khan by a group of people who have yearned for this their whole lives. It is a documentary - but like all such, it is the public face on the quest we all have to find who we are, where we come from, who sculpted our society...",1397520000,,454,3.9456521739130435
8257897,3,B000X73NEU,"I am disappointed with this DVD. When I learned about the title, ""The Secrets of Genghis Khan"", I expected that I would be entertained with his genius in tactics and strategies. After all, Genghis Khan is the greatest conqueror in history. Both Julius Caesar and Alexander the Great had their setbacks but, Genghis Khan has never been defeated in the field. Instead, we are treated with a brave visionary leads over a team across the steppe of Mongolia on a quest to discoiver the lost tomb of Genghis Khan. This team, led by Maury Kravitz from America was a total fiasco. This DVD is fraught with archaeological details but contains nothing about the majesty and greatness of Genghis Khan. If you are an archaeologist or a prospective archaelogist, you might enjoy it. If you look for the grandeur of Genghis Khan's feats, forget it.",1231718400,5,834,4.798611111111111
