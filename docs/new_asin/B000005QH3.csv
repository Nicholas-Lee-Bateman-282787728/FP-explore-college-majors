1184746,5,B000005QH3,"The ultimate car chase movie. Particularly revealing and far seeing, since it preceded the 55 mph speed limit by 4 years. Guy drives fast, doesn't hurt anyone, is somehow haunted by his past, but he's basically decent. Police  take it into their heads to stop him. Real speed scenes , not fabricated  fast-forward one-second takes of someone doing 35 mph. Beautiful car too,  Dodge Challenger. The original idea for the movie came from Cabrera  Infante, a Cuban writer.",911606400,2,469,4.9743589743589745

1184848,4,B000005QH3,"I'm gonna go 4 on this, even though the ending makes this a 3.

Barry Newman owns this role. His character has a captivating sorta magnetic all around appeal - not quite looks, not quite personality, it's more of a misplaced sorta dangerman thing. I can't put my finger on it, but his character is not like any other I've seen. He's criminal, a good cop, a killer?, likes to pop pills, race car driver, motorcyle racer..

The movie plays in 2 ways. It's current time, where he is ripping across the desert southwest in a killer ass car. But he has these flashbacks which are meant to show you who he is and why he is who he is now. It's a pretty incredible ride.

And there is a HOT ASS naked hippie girl riding around a motorcycle! Very cool.

I didn't like the ending. I didn't like some of the scenes with the blind DJ screaming and howling and yowling like a wild beast - grating, irritating and just not cool. In fact, I never even got the whole DJ part of it. That kind of DJ / music in that podunk town? Huh?

The ending leaves you feeling like the writer got bored with writing and said ""Fugg it""",1502841600,3,1104,4.188679245283019

20th Century Fox has done and outstanding job on the release of this movie in the Blu-ray format! It looks and sounds really good for a movie that was made in 1971.
~ Special Features here are numerous and give the viewer and insight into the car itself and how the movie plays out, still. We get an interview from the Soundgarden frontman himself, who just passed away by his own hand, talking about the movie. That was a shock and surprise for me, but it was good. All interviews and features here are good and well worth the money for this HD movie!
~ Sound is incredible at DTS 5.1 Audio English, but you also get the standard Mono in English, Spanish and French.
~ Subtitles are Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese.
~ The Menu is very classy and well done with easy selections. Thank you 20th Century Fox for making this fabulous HD Blu-ray movie come to life for a vintage classic!

Two bulldozers flanked by police, symbols of the inflexible western establishment representing construction and destruction, frame the start of Vanishing point.
Its the end of the line for life and freedom.
Inside a nearby seedy shack, a broken old man watches the scene unfolding through torn non functional window screens.
Across the road a dark skinned woman stands behind a white picket fence with one slat missing, while her child pushes his face through the space in the fence. The white fence representing the white energy of creation, the missing slat the woman through which every child is born.  Life is beginning even as the final act of destruction plays out.
In the final scene Kowalski finally, after a lifetime of racing, turns around and races towards the vanishing point of light between the two black bulldozer shovels which represent death. He returns to the ultimate.
Vanishing points theme of spiritual rebirth is supported by its upbeat gospel songs, serving as a counterpoint to the typically base material visuals.",1480291200,3,1083,5.370588235294117

1185043,4,B000005QH3,"BOTTOM LINE: If you love muscle cars, chase films or minimalist storytelling then this film is for you. Don't let the bummer ending put you off. VANISHING POINT is worth the trip, so strap yourself in and put the pedal to the metal. 4 STARS

THE STORY: Old school grindhouse flick showcases a mysterious man determined to deliver a souped-up '70 Dodge Challenger from Denver to San Francisco. On the way he meets a variety of unusual characters who change (and are changed by) him.

THOUGHTS: Director Richard Sarafian constructs this movie in much the same way he would do his next film, 1972's MAN IN THE WILDERNESS. Here, as there, the dialogue is fairly minimal and what little we know of the main character is learned mostly through flashbacks and his brief interactions with others. Star Barry Newman (as hellbent for leather driver 'Kowalski') looks like crap throughout most of this film. I suspect this was intentional as he is strung out on amphetamines (and continues to pop them over the course of the film) to keep him awake for his hellacious, nonstop road trip. Film's technical aspects are uniformly good. Stunts are quite hair-raising for the time period. The action is evenly mixed with quieter moments. Acting is pretty strong across the board, with a special callout to Clevon Little as ""Super Soul,"" the blind disc jockey who comments on (and counsels) Kowalski through the film's 2nd half. As my title description says, the head-scratchingly downbeat conclusion of the film is really the only negative. (If you've seen Dirty Mary Crazy Larry then you can guess what I am intimating regarding the climax.) Lots of odd characters pepper the film and those additions turn it into more than just a one-note chase flick, balancing the balls-to-the-wall high-octane stunt sequences and, ultimately, make VANISHING POINT a more well-rounded viewing experience.

THE BLU-RAY: Fox's hi-def presentation of VANISHING POINT is a solid one. Good picture with strong colors, minimal crush (noise), and no artifacting or pixelation that I could detect. Soundmix is even and level though somewhat softer than I'd expect. Extras include a full-length director commentary, a trivia track about the film and another track about this 70's sub-genre, 2 featurettes, the theatrical trailer, TV ads and more. An excellent value.",1451260800,2,2328,5.0890052356020945

1185115,4,B000005QH3,"Released in 1971, Vanishing Point stars Barry Newman as Kowalski, a pill-popping former racer and police officer, who bets that he can deliver a supercharged car from Denver to San Francisco in 15 hours. The police in four states try to apprehend him as a DJ (Cleavon Little) supports him on the airwaves. Dean Jagger plays a geezer Kowalski runs into in the desert.

This is a cult flick about the adventures of a rebel without a cause. While it has similarities to 1969s Easy Rider, its not as compelling and the subtext isn't as good (see my review of Easy Rider).

The story is a big middle finger to what was called the establishment at a time when the Vietnam War was making a wreck of Americas social cohesion. Kowalski was part of that establishment when he was a cop, but became disillusioned after he exposed corruption and was punished for it, but heralded by the counterculture. Kowalski had seen the underbelly of the ""pig"" and didn't want to be part of it. At the beginning he drives off the road and you see him looking at some derelict vehicles. He increasingly realizes HE is a derelict on the side of the road with nowhere to go. What better next stop than oblivion? The climax is his *beep* off moment to go out on HIS terms. Three years later Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry sorta ripped it off. While that movie lacks the interesting (and ambiguous) subtext of Vanishing Point, its a more compelling watch. Despite the many car chases, Vanishing Point is surreal and even languid, embellished by a listless score (e.g the opening) and acid rock tracks throughout; while I don't like the former, most of the latter tracks are good and fit the ambiance of the movie.

Then theres the naked blond on the motorcycle sequence. Someone incredulously asked: How could he possibly turn down a sexy naked blonde? Whats his problem?! I guess sexiness is in the eye of the beholder because I didn't find her all that sexy. Sure, she has a pretty face, but her body is nearly as un-curvy as a 12 year-old girl. But some guys prefer thinner women and that's cool; to each his own. In addition, Kowalski was still grieving over his true love. Moreover, the naked blond didn't play the game of seduction, which takes time and imagination. Instead she prematurely reveals her entire hand and it simply doesn't turn Kowalski on. Lastly, despite it being the ""free love"" era (1970), Kowalski was much older (and arguably nobler) than the average hippie; as such, he didn't feel it proper to take advantage of the mate of the guy who was selflessly helping him (at least not without his clear permission).

The movie runs 99 minutes and was shot in Colorado, Utah, Nevada and Arizona.

GRADE: B-

COMMENTARY ON THE MEANING ***SPOILER ALERT*** (Dont read further unless youve seen the movie)

In an interview Barry Newman very seriously explained Kowalskis actions at the end: ""He thought he could make it through; and that was the reason for the smile just prior to the impact. I don't question this since the actor himself would have more insights about the movie than the viewer, but even his answer is ambiguous. It could mean (and probably does) that Kowalski thought he could make it through to the other side, i.e. leave the physical plane for the spiritual one and the (possible) freedom thereof. After all, he sees the light between the blades of the bulldozers while approaching. Keep in mind that Kowalski was hopped up on a lot of drugs. As such, he doesn't commit suicide in the sense he wants to die, but rather kills himself in the accident because he BELIEVES he'll make it through; physically or spiritually, it doesnt matter. He believed.",1437264000,2,3649,4.674454828660436

It is still a brilliant visual statement and one of the best car chase movies of all time. I saw it the week it opened in 1971 and knew it was a classic then as now. The rugged individualist is as passe as the lonely two-lane blacktop. This movie is as close as millions of people will ever get to that place in time. Few have ever dreamed of a Medal of Honor, let alone earned one and the ""hero"" Kowalski has this to anchor his character to a moral compass that simply does not exist in the real world. No grey area to confuse anyone. Black and White are still the only colors that matter in the end.",1435104000,,776,4.214765100671141

It's also a very interesting slice of Americana from 1971, as it was leaving the the 1960s and entering the brave new world of the seventies.  The end of the film will likely leave you wondering why would the film-makers let it end like that?  Well, there's a DVD extra that will explain their philosophy about this, after which I'm fairly sure you'll get it.",1433980800,,689,4.5528455284552845

It gives you a new appreciation for all of the locations where it was shot and it transports you right back to the early 1970s.  This version contains both the U.S. and UK releases, along with several bonus features including director Richard Sarafian's commentary.  The UK version contains additional scenes which help to explain more of the main character's motives.
The film centers around Kowalski - one man tasked with delivering a car to San Francisco from Denver.  Not just any car - a 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T!  The film has some existential touches for those who are deep thinkers.  For those who are not, the continuous car chase will hold your interest.

To say this movie made an impression on me would be to not do it justice.  A great movie? Of course not. But once you start watching it you don't ever really want it to end, especially when you realize whats coming.
Its odd, and frivolous and then its deep and then bizarre.  there are so many different types of people represented.  I've met most of these types in my life. the driven self-righteous; the deluded; the wide awake; the completely asleep sheep.  they are all in this movie.",1422576000,4,680,4.1923076923076925

1185353,5,B000005QH3,"If the film Two Lane Blacktop was the American Dream to nowhere, then Vanishing Point might be though of as its more meaningful, soulful cousin that makes you want to drive your car out into the middle of the Nevada desert, camp out for a few days and try LSD for the first time.  This is the type of movie that lets the scenes do the talking for it without relying on wordy dialogue or a corny soundtrack to save the day.  It's like the Easy Rider of the 1970s with the same kind of laid back pace and style that has all but been abandoned by modern day films IMO.  This is something of a thoughtful movie but there are plenty of cop chases, drug scenes and even a nude girl on a bike to attract the base, elementary viewer. But for me, it's the scenes of long stretches of desert highway and white deserts with absolutely no dialogue for long durations (just trying to showcase nature) which represents something of a cinematic gamble but pays off.  The ending is left up to one's own interpretation but in my mind, it represents the logical conclusion or inevitable destiny of the last American hero.",1416528000,4,1103,4.392156862745098

This is one of the ultimate stories of life and the human condition. If you have to ask then you just don't get it. you must be living under a rock.

The cinematography, and the desert views through the camera lens, are classic as well.  And the music -- can't forget the music.  Of course, the 1970 Dodge Challenger and Barry Newman are both fine actors.

And if one wonders what happened to all the characters in this 1970 baby boomer culture over the decades? The Jesus freaks became today's Tea Party, tribulation end-timer survivalists, and the religious-right movement.  The hippies became the global-warming, stop-oil-coal-nuclear-logging and legalize-pot movement.

1185599,5,B000005QH3,"""Vanishing Point"" is Sarafian's classic film about the dashed hopes of a young man in the late sixties/early seventies counter-culture whose life is taking unusual turns as he becomes a car-runner who decides (just for the hell of it) to get to his destination in record time despite being well ahead of the due date (driving his white 1970 Dodge Challenger, a cinematic symbol of phallic testosterone-driven dominance if there ever was one). That's the extent of the plot, sort of, but there are so many unusual counter-culture oddities in ""Vanishing Point"" that it should be made must-see viewing for students of drive-in era cinema.
One suspects an allegory to Vietnam, a lament for lost love, and a longing for finding a niche to fit in to a world that absolutely has lost its ability to shape itself according to the past. This is the great thrill of ""Vanishing Point""--it is a film that questions where humanity had come up to this point (1971), and where it may be heading in future. Although it has the flavor of a hippie-oriented second cousin to ""Easy Rider,"" Newman's Kowalski is the staple figure of a post-conservative worldview that was struggling to see the future in a haze of free sex, rapidly increasing drugs, disillusioned youth, and angry Protestant-like parents and authorities. A viewer is caught up in Kowalski's angst about human loss and the destiny of his own life, and as his paucity of endurance arrives, it leads to a shocking, splattering conclusion which illustrates how the Vietnam, post-hippie generation was about to explode into a nitroglycerin meltdown of utter anxiety and death. But...this movie is still a good time.
There is much to see in this film--from Gilda Texter's fully nude run on a mini-bike (and beyond) to the beautiful, powerfully photogenic landscapes of the American Southwest (with the Nevada locations looking especially lush here)--and historians should have fun trying to locate the cultural significance of this often-overlooked character study. While it may not be to every taste, and it certainly remains ""dated"" as a product of a by-gone era, ""Vanishing Point"" is a corner stone for understanding how to reassess the classic drive-in titles of yesterday.

1185632,5,B000005QH3,"Great movie on many levels.

The story seems simple a Colorado guy break a traffic law and begins a high speed chase through multiple states all the way to California.  However, the movie has underlying message or messages.  This movie can been viewed as an action flick, but also as a metaphor for life.  Most importantly, it shows America of the 1970's, and I do not think that much has changed since then, sub-culturally, economically, and politically speaking.  The hero, Kowalski (Polish last name) played by a Jewish actor, is a guy with a past, who likes ""speed"".  He is a typical man, or maybe not so typical in a very untypical times in the USA history.  Keep in mind the movie is from 1973, at that time United States was still involved in Vietnam, the OPEC countries were causing the 1973 oil crisis (which means it was difficult to get gasoline), the general public was very disappointed in the government and overall people were anti-authority; hence, so many scenes of hippies, free riders, common folks living out in the open.  Personally, I think the movie stands as a statement against the oppressive and authoritarian government, or police state.  The police are portrayed here as the Nazis, brown-shirts, storm troopers, evil guys, you name it. The black radio jockey and Kowalski represent the oppressed minorities, who stand up to the ""white-racist American authority"".  The movie also alludes to life unfulfilled, as the main character is the quintessential ""free-rider"" the last American free sprit, the untamed cowboy of the ever-progressing and closing authoritarian-globalization of Pan-Americanism.  The ending is very appropriate for this movie.  What also stands out in this American classic, is  the music...really good choice of country, soul, and gospel---(which btw, fits perfectly with American west scenery).

I was surprised at the depth of the main character told through flash-back memories throughout the Denver to San Francisco trek. This movie wouldn't be made today, there would be a lot more fancy camera work and I think the violence level would be way beyond what happens here. There was something about the early 70s that allowed for long shots with the camera where one could allow for your own opinions and thoughts to develop instead of having them force fed to you. There was a lot of interesting subtle references to a changing culture as the 60s were over and new modern Liberal world was unfolding. Not to say there is a good or bad motivation, just that ""the times they are a changing"".

Overall this isn't something I would revisit often but I love the overall feel of the movie. It is a chase film and has a gritty feel to it but there is something more, something that makes you connect and cheer for a reckless speed demon.",1369785600,8,1028,4.410526315789474

1185809,5,B000005QH3,"I probably saw this film on a B&W TV while I was a kid. Today, I can see the several interesting details that Director Richard Sarafian put nicely on this 1971 film. My overall view here is that this film should appeal to all those who are nostalgic of the early 1970s and that feel attracted for the antihero character. In this case, the hero takes a personal crusade in the form of a car chase. In several passages of the film, the car chase remains an excuse to be critical and bring to the screen some of the hot themes of that era in the US, including racism, drug use, and free love. Thus, in many ways to me, this film goes in page similar to Easy Rider and other alike. Do not despair, yes, you have lots of fast moving scenes where our here (Kowalski) drives a supercharged, white 1970 Dodge Challenger and bits the bunch of cops chasing him.
Technically speaking, the Blu-ray transfer is awesome. Particularly the landscape scenes look awesome and a pleasure to watch. Please, not a very nice treat on this Blu-ray edition: for this little price you will get the US (99 min) and UK (106) versions of the film, with the UK version being about 7 min longer.

The special features suggest the movie bombed in the U.S. when it was first released but was a huge hit overseas. It then was re-released as the second half of a ""French Connection"" double feature. Still, somehow the cult classic lives on and I'm glad I finally caught up to it only 39 year later!

I guess one thing that stands out and many who saw the movie remember is Gilda Texter's nude motorcycle riding and yep, it's worth watching. She gives an interesting interview in the special features as a now 60 something part time actress. Also fave, Charlotte Rampling shows up as the hitchhiker you dream about.

Having said all that, this movie is about a '70 Dodge Challenger RT and some of the best stunt driving you will ever see. No CGI just exciting chases from beginning to end.

I hate censorship and I don't like it when people try to decide what I should watch for me and alter movies because they don't approve.

1185937,4,B000005QH3,"The 70's was a time of confusion, unrest, and rebellion that saw many Americans questioning some of the basic tenants of society.  With some similarities to Easy Rider (1969), director Richard C. Sarafian`s Vanishing Point (1971), features a daring driver in a white Dodge Challenger hitting the open highways in a quest for freedom, cruising at high speeds, staying just ahead of the law.  Along the way, a few facts about the man behind the wheel are revealed, gradually filling in some of the details about his colorful past.

An ex-professional race driver, Kowalski (Barry Newman) now makes his living delivering cars from one place to another.  Picking up a supercharged Challenger with Colorado plates OA-5599 in Denver on a Friday night, Kowalski intends to arrive in San Francisco by Sunday afternoon.  Early on in the approximately 1300 mile journey, Kowalski refuses to pull over for the state police, and then spends the rest of the film on the run from the highway patrol of several states.

Barry Newman's understated performance brings some sensitivity to a character who appears cool, sexy, and likeable, even though he is an outlaw of sorts, and at times recklessly endangers the lives of others with his maniacal driving.  Fueled by uppers, and driven by forces unknown, Kowalski eludes the cops, leaving a trail of disabled vehicles in his wake.  Reaching the open highway, he rips through vast desert expanses and western prairie country, trying to remain free.

Along the way, Kowalski meets some interesting individuals who help him to continue on his journey.  Veteran character actor Dean Jagger plays a snake hunting prospector, while Angel (Timothy Scott) is an easy riding free spirit, who provides both drugs and much needed aid, at a critical juncture.  Paul Koslo is a highway patrol officer who takes a very personal interest in the chase.  By far the most quirky character is a blind radio disc jockey named Super Soul, played by Cleavon Little.  Identifying with Kowalski's defiance of authority, Super Soul tries to aid him on his journey, however not everyone is pleased when his broadcasts bring Kowalski's exploits to a public stage.

Vanishing Point is an offbeat joyride that is a blast while it lasts, although the longer things go, the smaller the chances for a favorable outcome become.  Well structured, the story unfolds nicely, with Barry Newman giving a terrific performance, rarely seeming to lose his way.  Much is communicated without words, as his main costar is often the Challenger.  Flashbacks are employed to reveal critical elements from Kowalski's past.  By the end of the film, he still remains mostly an enigma, but enough is revealed to piece together some picture of the man.

The music featured in the film, a combination of funk, rock, country, gospel, and soul, is a major contributor to the movie's footloose vibe.  Very much a reflection of the times, the film examines a particular slice of Americana, and one man's attempt to find peace of mind and freedom, in what is a precursor to the Smokey and the Bandit type pursuit films that would soon follow.

The DVD includes both the American (99 minute) and British (106 minute) versions of the film.  The British version is the one to see, as it contains some additional scenes, primarily one where Kowalski picks up a hitchhiker played by English actress Charlotte Rampling.  A terrific bonus is a commentary track by director Richard C. Sarafian, which is very down to earth, and full of fascinating, sometimes risqu stories, and warm remembrances regarding the film that is not to be missed.",1297468800,3,3609,4.998327759197324

1185940,2,B000005QH3,"This is a bad movie on all kinds of levels, but it has its moments of interest.

Bad stuff: Barry Newman leads the list here. A stiff actor incapable of doing anything to flesh out the character. Newman has little to work with in terms of script, but good actors can do things even with poorly-written parts. The ""climax"" of Newman's role is when he stops the car and decides what his fate should be. Newman makes it look like he's deciding whether to super-size his order of fries.

The amped-up social commentary is stupid. The Cleavon Little role is absurd. The homophobia is sick. The glorification of Hell's Angel's is laughable (see Altamont). The blatant rip-offs of ""Easy Rider"" and ""The Chase"" could serve as foundations for lawsuits. And no one who knows San Francisco calls it (or called it) ""Frisco.""

The film does have its highlights. (1) The car. The 1970 Dodge Challenger is the star of the movie. I must say, I've wanted a white 1970 Dodge Challenger since I first saw this movie in 1971, and I still want one in 2010 having re-watched the film. It's the ultimate American muscle car, produced at a golden moment just before the oil shock of 1973. For another film depiction of American muscle car culture at its best see the red Mustang in ""Diamonds Are Forever."" (2) Dean Jagger. He is on the screen for, what, 5 or 10 minutes, but delivers a memorable, funny, funky performance that shows what a good actor can do with a few scraps of material. It's one of the three or four best portrayals ever offered on film of a certain classic American type, the desert rat, out there in the desert prospecting, scavenging, surviving. (For another such character see the first half-hour of ""There Will Be Blood.""  3) The nude woman on the motorcycle - this is truly hilarious and kind of hot. (You can watch it. Google ""vanishing point nude."") She's sort of a wet-dream fantasy of what people in 1970 thought that hippie chicks were like, i.e., nude free spirits who were eager to screw anyone who came along, smiled, and looked a bit stoned. There's a similar hippie chick in ""The French Connection"" (on a bicycle; not nude, though). Let me say, the Vanishing Point hippie gal is gonna get badly hurt if she falls off that motorcycle. The director should have dressed her in a pair of tight leather chaps - JUST tight leather chaps, nuthin' else.",1291507200,5,2356,4.602380952380952

1185969,5,B000005QH3,"EXISTENTIAL CRITICISM AND THE MOVIE ""VANISHING
POINT""
by Geoff Ward
There is, of course, no reason why Colin Wilson's existential criticism should not be applied to performance texts, such as those of cinema and theatre, taken as sub-divisions of literature, as well as to written ones, despite the fact that unlike a novel or a poem, they are not the products of a single author's mind but the creations of a large number of individuals, from directors, writers and actors through a whole range of technicians and other contributors.
  I doubt if existential criticism has been applied to a movie before, but Richard Sarafian's Vanishing Point (1971), because of its notable existential temper, lends itself rewardingly to an application - and an illumination - of Wilson's philosophical approach.
  Vanishing Point tells the story of Kowalski, a car delivery driver who, high on benzedrine, and at the wheel of a supercharged Dodge Challenger, leads police on a chase across four western US states. He's made a bet that he can make the trip from Denver to San Francisco in 15 hours. Catching Kowalski turns into a massive police operation that attracts the gaze of the national media. Through a series of flashbacks, it is revealed that Kowalski is a Vietnam war veteran with a Medal of Honor for bravery, but that his girlfriend drowned, and that his subsequent careers as a twice-promoted police officer, a motorcycle speedway rider and a stock car driver all ended in failure. After that, he was reduced to being a demolition derby driver and even an ""auto clown"". The movie ends with Kowalski's death as he appears to deliberately ram a roadblock.
  On one level the film can be seen as a straightforward thriller (with plenty of exciting stunts and a fine contemporary music soundtrack), but on a deeper level as depicting the existential odyssey of the protagonist, whose ultimate gesture of defiance is typical of the Romantic outsider - a gesture which few indeed would be prepared to give, but one against which there can be no recourse. It is reminiscent of the Poet in Thomas Gray's The Bard who hurls himself into the abyss after cursing the royal line of Edward I. Kowalski is an anti-hero, a misfit, a solitary, defiant in the true Romantic sense that he is prepared to die rather than give in to the establishment. A laconic loner, he rejects the ""norms"" of both culture and counter-culture.
  As an example of popular cinema, although having gained ""cult"" status over the years, Vanishing Point presents itself as particularly accessible to the existential critic whose first consideration is to know exactly what a book, poem or movie is saying; being  ""true to life"", artistically satisfying technically, or telling a story convincingly are secondary matters. Vanishing Point is also a good example of how Romanticism remains unique among artistic forces in that it retains perennial vigour and youthfulness, as well as audience appeal.
  But most importantly, Vanishing Point examines how profound loss of meaning leads to a radical questioning of existence, and in so doing emphasises the corollary, that profound perception of meaning, as in the ""peak experience"", validates existence, and anticipates the evolutionary direction. The movie shows
what happens when the natural peak experience - achieved by Kowalski in motor racing - is lost, and an attempt is made to recapture the feeling artificially through the use of drugs and fast driving on the highway: both kinds of ""speed"".
  It is speed that gives Kowalski a sense of release from a world he seems to see as largely meaningless, and in the latter part of the film, the blind DJ Supersoul announces that his radio station is to be re-named ""KOWalski"", ""in honor of the last American hero, to whom speed means freedom of the soul"".  Supersoul, incidentally, seems able to tap into those latent powers of the mind that Wilson describes as ""Faculty X"" , to use ""intuition raised to a higher level"" - Wilson's own definition of  Faculty X - in his (Supersoul's) apparent telepathic contact with Kowalski on at least two occasions. Ultimately, of course, Kowalski's release is shatteringly final. Samuel Taylor Coleridge, his peak experiences having forsaken him, turned to opium in greater compensatory quantities. The tragedy at the heart of Vanishing Point is that, similarly, Kowalski is unable to regain that naturally optimistic state which can lead to the peak experience.
  Wilson, in The Books in my Life, during a discussion of what he describes as the ""bird's eye view"" of existence, as opposed to the normal ""worm's eye view"", says that in the former state it is as if ""our minds cease to plod along on the level of material reality, and seem to soar up into the air. The result is an odd sense of becoming what we really are"". Describing how he thinks Wordsworth and Van Gogh achieved this state, he then adds, suitably for this essay: ""A racing driver probably achieves it driving at 100mph.""
  At the moment in Vanishing Point when the media seize on Kowalski's story, there comes a telling exchange between a television reporter and Sandy, the man in charge at Argo's Car Delivery, for whom Kowalski works:
  TV reporter: But as a professional driver, he never really made the grade, did he?
  Sandy: Well, you know why? He never really wanted to. So far as I'm concerned, he was number one then, and he's number one now.
  That Kowalski ""never really wanted"" to make the grade seems particularly significant. It implies a certain element of defeatism , reminding us of Wilson's concept of  ""the age of defeat"", set out in his book of that title which is part of his Outsider cycle. Indeed, Wilson's original introduction to The Age of Defeat is entitled ""The Vanishing Hero"", and in the introduction to the 2001 edition, after mentioning Shelley, Goethe and Hoffman, Wilson says: "". . . all these romantics were overwhelmed with a sense of the authenticity of their `bird's eye views', even when they had to admit defeat in translating them back into terms of everyday life. This was the cause of that romantic despair that led to so many premature deaths."" And: ""The vanishing hero is not simply an intellectual or literary problem. For better or worse, it is one of the consequences of this Western society . . .""
  Heroism, in its purest definition, says Wilson, is an appetite for freedom, a desire to live more intensely. Kowalski possesses both these traits. But the realisation of heroism ""depends upon the liveliness of the potential hero's imagination, upon how far he can understand his own latent needs, and devise an outlet for them"".  And Kowalski seems to be one of those romantics who cannot translate his ""bird's eye views"" back into everyday life - hence his
penchant for fast driving on the public highway and his use of amphetamines.
As a fictional character, Kowalski at first glance may seem to represent Wilson's ""vanishing hero"", reflecting the negative and defeatist world in which his creators live. It is tempting even to see in the title Vanishing Point the eventual and complete cultural exit of the ""vanishing hero"" after a long process of literary attrition. But in actuality, in his own way, Kowalski rebels against the unheroic premise, the ""hypothesis of insignificance"", by setting his individuality against the system, whether it be the prevailing culture, or the counter-culture, of the time. It is supremely ironic that, ultimately, he decides to pay for this stance with his life.
  But as Wilson points out, the authors of 19th and 20th century literature had no qualms about loading the dice against their heroes and heroines. In a sense, the character of Kowalski is related to this literary ""tradition"", yet his moral perception indicates that he is in no way merely defeatist, but that, true to romantic type, he is unwilling to play by the established rules, to perform what (any) society expects of him. For example, he stands out against police corruption, to his own personal cost; he checks to ensure that drivers he outruns are not injured in various road accidents, risking capture as he does so; he takes only the amount of ""bennies"" he needs, despite being offered more; he resists the offer of casual sex from the girl on the motorcycle.
  The questioning of existence which pervades the theme of Vanishing Point is symbolised during an aerial shot in which we see Kowalski's car tracks create a giant ""X"" in the desert sand of Death Valley. Primarily, ""X"" indicates the Unknown. It is the ultimate ""sliding signifier"", equating anything with nothing, and it is under the shadow of  ""X"" that Kowalski moves, all the way from ""point zero"" to ""vanishing point"". The narrative of the movie is all about crossings - X-ings - literally, as Kowalski crosses the central reservation, the railroad line, the state lines, No Name Creek;  figuratively, as he ""crosses the line"" between what the authorities/establishment will and will not tolerate, especially as he ""crosses"" the police, appropriately driving a Dodge Challenger, dodging the cops and challenging the system. Kowalski also crosses the line between optimism of the past and pessimism of the present, and ultimately, the point of no return at Cisco, where he becomes resigned to his doom, his own personal ""vanishing point"".
  All this is underpinned by an ironic sub-text, comprising some 40 captions including road and other signs, ads, graffiti and newspaper headlines, which runs throughout the movie. A telling contrast of focalisation is created between this sub-text and the main narrative which is shifted, in a balance of opposites, towards placing emphasis on terms not normally given precedence in Western culture, destabilising or subverting the traditional hierarchy, thus:  law-breaking over law-enforcement; defiance over compliance; non-conformity over conformity; speed over caution. Much of the sub-text attempts to weight the balance the other way in a contrapuntal sequence which continually warns of the precariousness and danger of what Kowalski is doing. For example, the road sign ""Stop"" appears prominently no less than ten times; ""End speed zone"" suggests an anti-drugs message as well as giving a wry commentary on a police chase. Ironical comment is a key function of the sub-text; for example, a police roadblock is shown clustered around a sign saying ""Welcome to California"".
  Yet the sub-text also indicates the synchronic values which Kowalski appears to be rejecting in American society by force of his own individuality, repressive aspects of society which the Romantic seeks to shake off , eg, ""Coca Cola"", ""Mobil"" (big business, materialism), police insignia (the establishment, authority), ""Jesus Saves"" (religion, dogma), ""Love"" (the counter-culture). The juxtaposition of these static images against those of the fast-moving action demands the active interpretative engagement of the viewer who is called upon to make the imaginative connections. Meanwhile, Kowalski himself seems to evade the signifying system. Argo's Car Delivery alludes to the myth of Jason and the Argonauts, the crew of the ship Argo who sailed in search of the Golden Fleece, and who had various adventures along the way, and obstacles to overcome, just as Kowalski does. But if the Dodge is Kowalski's Argo, en route (via the ""Drug Center"") to the Golden State, he finds no equivalent of the Golden Fleece, only X-the-Unknown, and oblivion, beyond his crossing point between life and death.
  The movie's title is, of course, crucial, and functions on a number of different levels simultaneously:
1. The point where the sides of a highway converge at the horizon through the action of perspective - the point towards which Kowalski is always and inevitably heading; where the sightlines converge, itself an illusion.
2. The point at which Kowalski ceases to be a person and becomes a symbol - hero or villain, depending upon viewpoint - created by the DJ Supersoul.
3. The ""vanishing point"" of any stable or ultimate meaning.
4. The point at which Kowalski ""deconstructs"" himself in a deliberate act of self-immolation - the suicide crash; the point at which he vanishes from the world.
  At the beginning of the movie, in a kind of ""flash-forward"", after we see Kowalski drive out of the symbolic ""graveyard"" of rusting hulks of old vehicles and head back towards Cisco on the Sunday morning, the Challenger and a black Chrysler pass each other on a stretch of road; the scene freezes and the Dodge disappears. This may represent Kowalski's point of no return, his own last ride and ""vanishing point"". As the action then proceeds analeptically from the Friday night, Kowalski is shown delivering the black car in Denver.
  So, then, how does Vanishing Point score with Wilson's existential critic? The answer is, I think, quite highly. The movie does attempt to get beyond the values and limits of the ""natural standpoint"", and to investigate the question of existence itself - what human existence is for - through the character of Kowalski whose actions, past and present, seek an intensity or fullness of experience, but which are acutely contrasted with the content of the sub-text, representing the restrictive forces operating against him. In this way, one may assert that the film is successful in revealing existence as potentiality.
  At the same time, however, it raises the spectre of what Thomas Hardy called the ""Immanent Will"" (what today, less grandly, we would call ""Murphy's Law""), that impersonal and unconscious purpose which works itself out through history and is indifferent to the welfare of humanity in its thwarting of aspiration, revealing the disparity between the possible (the desired) and the actual (what the Immanent Will wills) - bringing in the inevitable element of pessimism, or defeatism, one of the ""consequences of Western society"", which
Wilsonian criticism detects as endemic in the literature of the 19th and 20th centuries. That an evolutionary expansion of consciousness should be able to ""inform"" the Immanent Will, so to speak, and thereby gradually overthrow the defeatist attitude, the ""fallacy of insignificance"", is implicit in Wilson's philosophy of the new existentialism.
  At the end of the movie, the chorus of the gospel-influenced Kim Carnes song Nobody knows is repeated several times as the camera tracks away from the crash site to a panorama of desert and sky. It seems to be saying that it takes death to make us see the actual potential of life, of existence - as does the Dr Johnson quotation to which Wilson is fond of referring: ""When a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight it concentrates his mind wonderfully."" But we always slip back into everyday consciousness (which Wilson, in a famous phrase, maintains is a liar) and let the ""robot"" take over so many aspects of our lives, drawing a veil over that potential.
  Kowalski, who decides that he will not return to the ""robotic"" life, takes an escape route which his pursuers cannot follow and, in the words of Nobody knows, his ""soul goes free"", suggesting a kind of metaphysical victory over the world. This, of course, cannot be valorised in existential terms, but it is nevertheless the impression created by combining the film's concluding images with this particular song. As a whole, however, the movie depicts graphically how the realisation of human potential, and the validation of human purpose, are frustrated not only by the very institutions which we create, but also by the very way we think, as the American psychologist George Pransky, much lauded by Wilson recently, has pointed out. One could say that Kowalski sacrifices himself in order to bring this powerfully to our attention.
* Regrettably, the 1997 made-for-TV remake of Vanishing Point is devoid of existential quality and the context of ""outsiderism"". Displaying the lamentably inevitable 1990s political correctness, this version has Kowalski's long-distance delivery of a vintage Dodge Challenger (identical to the one in the original film) go haywire when his expectant wife is suddenly hospitalised in danger of losing their unborn child. Mistakenly vilified, a desperate Kowalski eludes the FBI and police of four states as he races to cover 1,200 miles separating him from his family).",1269993600,4,16314,5.068283582089553

Yes, this movie has some bizarre scenes (like the snake catcher in the desert) and while there are some drugs, they are not the focus, and certainly less impactful than the original advertising for the film would have had you believe (""Thrills, spills and a handful of pills!"").

Kowalski is an ""Everyman"" much like Dennis Weaver's David Mann in Duel. Great car sounds and a startlingly good performance by Cleavon Little in one of his first films, and certainly his first leading role in a movie. (He died much too young at 53.) This film surely won't float everyone's boat, and even for people who like it, there are unanswered questions and things that could have been done differently.

It was fun to hear the director (Richard C. Sarafian) wax poetic on the commentary. He sounded a little bitter at not being the next Steven Spielberg, but who knows, maybe if things had turned out differently, he could have done Jaws instead!

Lots of things about that era make little sense:  the struggle of the the Freedom Riders of the early '60s (Why isn't James Zwerg a hero in America?), the war in Vietnam in which 58,000 American youth died, or the Kent State shootings (1970) where four students died when fired upon by their own National Guard.

1186027,4,B000005QH3,"I finally got around to catching Vanishing Point, the 1971 road film that, like Dirty Mary Crazy Larry, is one long car chase.  This flick above all else, is the film most mentioned in Death Proof, both by the characters and with the use of the white 1970 Dodge Challenger that the girls are test driving at the end of the flick.  Like all the other car flicks I've seen lately, I tried to go into this with unspoiled and with an open mind.

Like Two-Lane Blacktop, this flick begins with a slow burn that builds up to become much more than the sum of its parts.  The inter-cutting of scenes with the main character Kowalski (played by Barry Newman) with those of DJ Super Soul (played by Cleavon Little) are first unexplained and odd, but soon become weirdly telepathic, where one character becomes the body and the other the voice of a being that is past it's time on this earth.  The films existential leaning, though, isn't as up front as Two-Lane Blacktop, as the director (Richard C. Sarafian) and the writers (Malcolm Hart & G. Cabrera Infante) very creatively insert some telling flashback sequences that throughout the film bring the audience up to speed with Kowalski and suggest some reasoning behind his long last stand on the road.

Though the film is structured a little more commercially viable than Two-Lane, it's not quite as much so as Dirty Mary Crazy Larry and not nearly as mundane as most of Gone in 60 seconds, so it's kind of cool to see a progression of existentialist road movies throughout the 70's.  It's kind of interesting to note that in TLB speed alienates, in DMCL and VP speed kills, and in GI60S speed titillates because by that point people were becoming so enamored by the action that they were probably looking past the meaning.  This is an downward spiral that action movies take throughout the 80s (with films like the Smokey and the Bandit, Cannonball Run, and even to a point Top Gun) and which ends ultimately with films like Days of Thunder or Speed and its utterly pointless sequel, Speed 2: Speedier on a Boat No Less (or what ever the hell it was called.)  Car movies are all flash and hardly any substance anymore.  Stuff like the Fast and the Furious or the Transporter (though both fun and exciting) are simply eye candy.  Honestly, Death Proof isn't much better, but at least it turns its head back in the direction of the 70s flicks that it pays homage to.

I'm curious is this is one of the first times the where the whole DJ as a confidant/copilot concept makes it's way onto film.  It seems like a very stereotypical idea now, but I'm not sure where it came from.  I also really dig its telepathic inference, which reverberates nicely in later cinema like in the scenes between the Forest Whitaker titular character and Raymond (played by Isaach De Bankole) in Ghostdog: Way of the Samurai, where even though neither character can understand each others language, they still hold up their ends of a conversation through some sort of unexplained telepathy.

I also think that this is a pretty tight example of counter culture cinema, in the vein of Easy Rider, so it's sort of funny to see that there was a made for TV remake in '97 starring Viggo Mortensen that completely ditches Kowalski's drug fueled existential ride to the end with a plot about having to get home for the birth of his baby.

The USA and UK options are on both DVD and BLu-Ray and the UK version is a bit longer..The extra bonus feature on the Music is also stellar with interviews with classic artists as well as legendary DJ Jim Ladd...and another feature on the mighty Dodge Challenger...loads of Blu-ray extras!

Actors Cleavon Little and the legendary Dean Jagger also bring a gravitas to the film and are superbly cast.

You'll learn a lot about our driver with flash back scenes of his past life as the story goes along. You'll even meet Super Soul, a blind, black DJ that tries to help our driver with his unique powers of esp, until he gets roughed up by some local racist cops.

1186033,3,B000005QH3,"I saw this film in the theater when it originally came out.  I've since seen it once on one of the movie channels.  I was enthused at the prospect of watching this intrigueing film on Blu-Ray with my new 52"" HDTV and Blu-ray home theater system.  When it arrived, I open the box to watch it immediately!!!  Inside the box, there was an insert mentioning that the DVD was made to todays' best, exacting industry standards. It also mentioned it might not be compatible with my new Blu-Ray player.  I ignored the insert, popped it in the player only to find out that the insert was correct.  My player alerted me with a new (to me) ""red screen of death""!!!  I learned a new term that day; ""firmware upgrade"".  Following the guidance on the insert I went to the information site on the web, found my players' manufacturers' site and followed their instructions for burning a CD to upgrade my players' firmware.  It didn't work!!!!!  So, having bought the player just three months earlier, I took it to the store associated with the ""Geek Squad"".  After two hours of trying, they determined that my player needed to go to the service center to be fixed so it WOULD be able to accept this and any future ""firmware upgrades"".  As the player is also the home theater portion of my entire system, I declined their offer to send ot to the service center for, oh, TWO TO THREE WEEKS!!!!  I'll wait until I have several movies that can't be played before I dismantle my home theater system for three weeks just to watch a movie I had anticipated enjoying.  Until then it can sit on the shelf and age.  Why three stars???  Even if the Blu-Ray version isn't all that I expected, it's still an interesting movie!!! JRB",1238112000,,1703,4.498371335504886

1186036,5,B000005QH3,This is like an 1.5 hour long commercial for one of the greatest cars ever made.  I could seriously just loop the audio of the exhaust noise and have a perfectly good night at home listening to that.  If you're a fan of the Challenger you have to have this movie.  Deathproof (Quentin Tarantino) is a very distant second place movie that stars this car.  I love it.  Get it.,1237161600,2,374,4.285714285714286
1186057,4,B000005QH3,"I bought this movie after hearing that it was filmed in Goldfield, NV. It was so cool to see the town and what it looked like almost 40 years ago. It used to be the largest town in Nevada boasting 300,000 people a hundred years ago. The Goldfield Hotel in which Super Soul broadcasted his radio show has been featured on Fox Scariest Places on Earth, Ghost Hunters, and Ghost Adventures. As for the movie itself, it kind of seems a bit dated. Nice naked chick on the motorcycle however and cool car crashes.",1235692800,,507,4.404255319148936
1186058,5,B000005QH3,"C'mon, you already own the movie on DVD, what are all these reviews of the DVD version doing here?

What's on the Blu-ray? That's what you want to know.

Okay, worth the price of admission alone; a new HD 20-minute documentary on the film including interviews with Barry Newman (Kowalski himself), Sarafian (the director), musician Chris Cornell (?!), and ... wait for it ... the naked chick on the motorcyle ... today. Well, maybe you want to skip that visual to keep your memories (and her petite mammaries) vivid in your mind, but it was a noble thought (except for the part about the blisters).

Love the car? Another brief documentary has car enthusiasts, including the legendary George Barris, talking about the 1970 Challenger. I loved finding out that the HP was specifically down-graded to 426 so it could be marketed as a street vehicle, when it was really a drag strip monster with 500 HP, and almost impossible to control at high speeds. Kudos to the stunt driver (Why isn't he on here? Let me guess ...)

There's a trivia quiz you can take while watching the movie. And there's this strange graphic you can add to the watching of the movie where you are looking at it over a graphic of the actual dashboard of the car. Sort of like Mystery Science Theater 3000 (or whatever it's called). I wouldn't recommend it though, if you want to actually enjoy the pristine quality of the high definition remaster, which is beautiful, especially for an early 70's vintage film where, more often than not, the cinematographer was just as stoned as the cast, the picture could often be out of focus, and the ackward zoom shots could make you hurl.

But forget all that, here is the ultimate anti-authority finger-up-in the-air-to-the-police epic. Pop the clutch and get down to your local Brick and Mortar media store (they're sinking fast) and pick it up!",1235433600,4,1856,4.733746130030959
1186059,4,B000005QH3,"It might `only' be a chase movie in terms of plot - but this movie reeks so much of the period in which it was made it is more like an historical record of a nations mood.
Barry Newman is an ex policeman and ex stock car racer, who now is reduced to delivering cars for a living.  In pushing himself to get the job done, he is forced to take speed, and has no time to sleep - he is a man falling between the cracks of society.  He accepts a bet that his latest delivery - a Dodge Challenger - can be delivered from Denver to California by a certain time.  While racing to meet his deadline the police take notice and a chase begins, commented on by a blind radio station dj, who helpfully provides an iconic 70's soundtrack to the proceedings.
Along the way he meets dropouts, hippies, drug dealers, Jesus-freaks and hold-outs against civilization.  In short, a synopsis of all those from the 60's generation who are disillusioned at the way the 70's are starting.
If it's aged in terms of the music and in places the style, It has not dated nearly as much as it's contemporary `Easy Rider', and the cinematography of the empty, grand spaces of Western United States makes the movie worth watching in itself.  The soundtrack is surprising in places, but the sound design itself is a star, with the growl from the Dodge Challenger part of the rush.
It's arguably the movie that defined chase movies for years to come - where would Smokey and the Bandit be without it? And yet few of its successors had the sense of astute and bleak observation of the times.
Thrilling, expansive, yet trimmed down and simple in plot, this is worth catching up on and deserves to find an audience again.",1235088000,,1684,4.419354838709677
1186060,5,B000005QH3,This has to be one of the all time best chase flicks. And if your into the classic muscle Dodge's this is the movie for you. I bought this for a friend who is still in love with the classic Dodge muscle car and he flipped.,1233446400,,222,3.847826086956522
1186061,3,B000005QH3,"Though I'm now in my fifties I'm afraid I'll never grow up: I still like ""Vanishing Point"", done so ever since I saw it first in the early seventies. I've seen in on tv, had it on tape, still have it on laserdisc and on standard DVD, still have the LP soundtrack and now, finally I have it on Bluray (it was released over here in Holland early January, 2009.

The image is only slightly better than the standard DVD, simply because the original filmgrain is the limiting factor as far a picture resolution is concerned. My copy was incorrectly labelled 2.35, it is in fact 1.80, like it was shown in cinemas. I was very pleased to see that the sound had been redone in 5.1 DTS HD, but this turned out to be a big disappointment. This is not a remix: all dialogue and music are still in mono and front-centered, only very occasional there is some surround sound effect, but definitely the sound does not live up to 5.1 DTS HD expectations.

Well whatever! If a true 5.1 version comes along, I'll be buying that too, probably. And there are some nice extra's on the BluRay disc.",1231632000,15,1076,4.375
1186062,5,B000005QH3,"By far the best car chase movie ever made. Kowalski and a 1970 Challenger, it doesn't get any better than that. The music kept pace with the movie which is rare these day's due to studios trying to sell music cd's as well as the movie. The meaning to the story, it's better to burn out than fade away. Cleavon Little was great as the DJ, but most the time seems to be Kowalski's co-pilot. The chase never lets up in this movie until the end, but even then, Kowalski is smiling. Even though this movie is mild compared to today's films, parents might want to remember the drug use and the nude biker girl scene in this film as well as the corrupt cop scene. And if you watch the international version of this film, don't forget the scene where he picks up a hitch-hiker. This is one of those flicks that I watched time and time again, it never gets old. They made a newer version of this film in 2004, don't waste your time, especially if your a big fan of the original. I read in a car magazine a few month's ago an article on the new Challenger, where they were talking about another remake of this movie. If they do, I hope they learn from other remake failures and learn what made this on a cult phenomenon.",1231027200,,1210,4.219827586206897

Trailer in HD, 2 TV spots in 480i.

1186066,5,B000005QH3,"Don't get wrong : this is not a fantastic car chase movie. It's a movie from the early seventies about freedom, about America living the end of a golden age, about a country made of hope and contradictions. It is also about space, and time, about beauty (the desert is amazingly beautyful).
R. Sarafian is a great director, with very little he does big effect, and Barry Newman is exactly the guy requested for this role.
Besides, it is a fantastic car chase movie.",1228521600,,465,4.5476190476190474
1186097,5,B000005QH3,"I saw this in the theater in 1972 while restrained in the Marine Corps and was transported by the music, wide open desert spaces, anti-establishment themes, Kowalski's sense of fair play and nude hippie chicks on motorcycles. In other words all the freedoms I missed while being in the service. I really loved it then and was a little apprehensive about seeing it again as I wasn't sure it would hold up over the years. 36 years to be exact.

Well, the movie works on many different levels and it still holds up today for the same reasons it was a great ""B"" movie way back in the day. Now, the 1970 Dodge Challenger is a sweet, classic muscle car and just the sound of that engine revving over my home theater system is a nostalgic celebration. (Gotta get me one of those!) We miss Cleavon Little even more as he nearly steals the film as Super Soul the seemingly clairvoyant and misplaced desert DJ. We can still relate to the angst and frustration of not fitting in with mainstream society.

There are real humanistic themes here to go along with the weirdness and action. I appreciated Kowalski's sense of fair play, notice how when someone might be injured he usually stops, gets out of the car and determines whether they might need help. Nice touch. He does this in different ways all through the film. You really see the man behind the wheel as a person.

I did get concerned about the present value of this film during the first fifteen minutes because the early chases seemed rather like ""Smokey & The Bandit"". I was relieved that we move away from there quickly and head into deeper, darker waters. A very entertaining little film, indeed.

On the downside I would like to have seen some DVD extras like a ""making of"" segment or interviews and a 5.1 remix of the sound would have been great, too. I know, it's an old ""B"" movie, I'm just happy it's available at all!",1227312000,2,1875,4.489736070381231
1186098,5,B000005QH3,"Vanishing Point is a movie I remember seeing on television as a child. I liked it because I've always liked cars and I liked muscle cars like the Dodge Challenger (love the 2008-09 model). Years later, I recorded the movie off of television on VHS, but the quality was so-so. I finally bought the DVD and I really like it. I loved the bonus features like the various movie trailers for the film and the directors commentary by Richard Sarafian. As a video producer and digital filmmaker, the movie still works for me. I did not outgrow it. Although, I think the drug use is a bit much, I understand how the experiences of the Kowalski anti-hero character would lead him to such behavior. Of note is the Super Soul character brilliantly brought to life by Cleavon Little. Vanishing Point is a great action car chase film, a wonderful exercise in filmmaking and a great look back at how films used to be made before the glitz and glitter of Hollywood CGI.",1227052800,,953,4.546511627906977

1186134,5,B000005QH3,"I rented Vanishing Point because I'm a car nut, and especially like the old muscle cars of the '60s and '70s like the 1970 Dodge Challenger that's driven in the film.  The movie definately satisfies the car nut in me, with all of the chase scenes, but if you rent it just for that you're missing the whole point of the film.  Vanishing Point is the story of an ex-cop, ex-Vietnam Vet named Kowalski.  He's tasked with the job of delivering a 1970 Challenger from Denver to San Francisco.  For fun, he makes a bet with his drug dealer that he can make the trip in only 15 hours.  Along the way he is helped by a blind DJ named Super Soul who gives him advice over the radio for avoiding the cops.  I found the movie to be very spiritual and symbolic.  Kowalski seems like just a stoned-out, law breaking, speed freak, which he is, but the movie gives us a glimpse into how he became that way through a series of flashbacks into Kowalski's life.  It seems like everytime Kowalski tried to do the right thing, it came back to haunt him.  Along the way, he becomes sort of an anti-hero, fighting the establishment that has let him down.  I won't give away the ending if you haven't seen the film, but I loved it.  It's just the way this guy should have gone out!  Get this movie!  4 Stars!",1216080000,,1285,4.260330578512397

I'm telling ya, whenever I'm having a night where I just can't fall asleep, I'll pop this terrible movie in and in 10 minutes I'm sleeping like a baby. I bought this movie for Five Dollars and I feel like I got the short end of the stick here. I feel flat out robbed. With a weak American Dollar, paying $5 for this movie is a bit too much.

The acting, chases and the Nascar plot sent this movie spinning around in circles, literally as the disc flew across the room. I don't understand the positive reviews of this movie. What is there to like? Save your five dollars please. Don't be suckers people.",1213142400,4,893,4.284023668639053

1186138,5,B000005QH3,"The original Vanishing Point (not 'updated' 1997 version) lives up to its name of being one of the classic cinematic car chase movies. Through subtle poignant tones is the story of a man known simply as Kowalski racing against the clock and himself on mission that becomes all too clear as the movie unfolds.

Super Soul (Cleavon Little, Blazing Saddles) is a blind black disc-jockey who appoints himself Kowalski's spiritual co-pilot much to despise of law enforcement promotes Kowalski to an ever increasing audience who listen in and follow him on his journey with destiny. 30+ years later this is still a movie that will leave more than an impression of watch and forget as this is an example of a car chase film that has a story line you will not easily forget.

Note previous comment re 'updated' 1997 version of Vanishing Point that re-edits the original 1971 movie footage to replace Cleavon Little (R.I.P 1939-1992) with Brett Priestly (Beverly Hills 90210) as Super Soul inserts into the story line a pregnant wife, mobile phones and a heavy metal soundtrack, enough said.",1208995200,,1082,4.907103825136612

Its not a great movie when it comes to the storyline, but the action scenes are great, especially if you're a fan of muscle cars and rebellion.

After avoiding it for many years, I finally took a look.

1186173,4,B000005QH3,"Easy Rider may have somehow become the defining film of its day, heralding a plethora of clichd road moves, but I'll stick with Vanishing Point. It may have been the inspiration for Smokey and the Bandit, which added jokes, beer and a happy ending to the equation, but four decades on it's aged much better than Hopper's drug-fuelled road trip thanks to a combination of great visuals and some great car stunts. On the debit side there's some very unfortunate gay stereotyping in one sequence and the Charlotte Rampling scene from the UK version (which, ironically, can now only be found on the US DVD) does unfortunately slow the picture down to a dead stop at exactly the wrong time, but as speed-fuelled nihilism goes it's still a great ride.

While the UK DVD only includes the trailer and the shorter American cut of the film, the Region 1 NTSC DVD is a much better proposition, including both the 98-minute US cut, the 105-minute UK cut, an audio commentary by director Richard C.

1186181,5,B000005QH3,"Before I begin: I'll admit, this is not for everybody. It is for people who enjoy films instead of movies. Films that raise questions and make you think. Based in the exciting 70s, this is about a car driver who, on a whim, bets that he can make it from Denver to San Fransisco in 15 hours. He loads up on speed and heads west. In the raging spirit of the 70s, the same spirit that accompanied Easy Rider and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, he races against the law for what is right; what this reviewer believes is the American Dream. He is helped along the way by an apparently psychic radio DJ, a naked girl on a motorcycle (one of the most beautiful and purely free images I have ever seen), a hippie, along with several other miscreants that the society at the time considered bad. The story is as much about the rebellion and the characters he meets on the way as it is the chase itself. The film manages to beautifully capture every facet of the experience, from the monotony of the drive to the excitement of the chase to the fear of defeat.

So, for those looking for what is perhaps the ultimate chase movie, this is it. But more so, this film is for those looking for inspiration into (or perhaps, remembrance of) the American Dream in a society where it was still possible.",1192579200,4,1285,4.331950207468879
1186222,5,B000005QH3,"The 1970s may have been the dark ages of the automobile (think Pinto, Gremlin, American Motors) and of politics (Vietnam, Watergate, Nixon, Carter).  But the films from this decade include several cinematic nuggets that include this little gem, ""Vanishing Point"".  To watch ""Vanishing Point"" is to instantly time travel to the far-off Nixonian lands of America circa 1970 and 1971.  A free-wheeling, different America than the buttoned-down, anti-septic country we know and love today.  This film is a vast expanse of azure blue skies penetrated by our protagonist and his revved-up white car.  As we watch this film, we are delivered several unforgettable cinematic treats, including the nude hippie chick on the motorcycle, the blind Malcolm X-like ""Super Soul"" who guides our protagonist Kowalski through strange ESP powers, the evil denizens of the highway who try to do harm to our unlikely Johnny Cash-like hero, and the race against time to a destination of nowhere that so typifies the dystopic nature of films of this period.  Watching ""Vanishing Point"" will be the cinematic equivalent of pulling out that Fondue pot, breaking out the LP records, and dusting off the Parcheesi game for a night of 1970s fun.  Resistance IS futile!!!",1190764800,6,1242,5.18
1186223,4,B000005QH3,"Vanishing Point is one of those cult classics that may have not been big in the mainstream box office, but is a huge hit with car buffs, especially 1970 Challenger/Barracuda fans.  The DVD also has an optional director's comments soundtrack which really makes for interesting viewing.

Vanishing Point is a 1971 period piece (I was 4 and 5 years old in 1971) that brings back some vague childhood memories of cars, hairstyles, clothing, etc.

Although the director acknowledges that 20th Century Fox started out wanting this to be an A feature that was eventually relegated to a B movie (he explains why in the director comments), there is a combination of quality cinematography, and cheesy moments in the film that leaves me somewhat perplexed.  I mean, why the hoaky overdubbed high speed car chase sounds that don't necessarily match what's being shown in some scenes and not in others?  The director also says that Barry Newman was not his first choice to play Kowalski, but that 20th Century Fox essentially forced him to.

In a car magazine interview, Barry Newman claimed that there were a total of 5 cars, all Alpine White 1970 Dodge Challengers, four of them with 440 Magnums with 4 speeds, one with a 383 automatic, used in the filming.  However in the director's comments, Richard Sarafian claimed that 9 cars were used.  So who's right?  Based on the footage, it doesn't surprise me that multiple cars (however many) were destroyed in the course of filming Vanishing Point.

Overall, Vanishing Point is a good value DVD for $13.00.  What with the American version, the British version (with one additional scene), the director's comments, and the trailers, it really makes for $13.00 worth of solid entertainment - if you're into car chase movies.

As with most DVDs of older fims, the picture and sound quality are a big improvement over the older blurry and grainy VHS version.  The DVD soundtrack is crystal clear and crisp rather than muddy and overly saturated on the VHS tape.  Enjoy!",1190505600,4,2003,4.887573964497041

Barry Newman is a car delivery driver after a recent depressing life of vietnam veteran, corrupt law enforcement and possible suicide of his girlfriend. The film defines the mental statis and mind racing of many vietnam veterans of the turbulant 60s and early 70s who can side with him. He is spent and he knows it so he just don't give a damm anymore hes out for his last dash. The 70 dodge chalenger he drives simblizes its last hurrahh as well as the fast car from the factory was winding down with 1970 being the last year for cars to get faster. After that year they started cutting back in the energy crisis to follow. The dodge speaks of its mopar domination being the best of the speedy cars with the hemi supercharger and pistal grip 4 speed shifter. Although some may argue the car is the star thats ok as well.

1186304,5,B000005QH3,"Barry Newman plays Kowalski (no first name given), who used to be part of the statist machinery directed by ""The Man"".  He began life as an inductee in the local government indoctrination center, doing a 12-year sentence.  After graduation, he did his dance with the military before rejoining the civilian side of a country on a war footing - as a cop!  Somehow, Kowalski is able to untangle his mind from a lifetime of cultural programming and become a free-thinking person.  The catalyst for this event is ""The Man"", who reacted heavy-handedly to Kowalski's moral clarity and made him an outcast.  One thing leads to another and Kowalski then makes a wager that he can drive a 1970 Dodge Challenger from Denver, Colorado to San Francisco within 15 hours.

That's when the real star of this film emerges - a white 1970 Dodge Challenger with 440 cubic inches of internal combustion engine fed by a six pack that could make over 400 horse power (although Dodge said 390 hp to help out buyers with their car insurance).  This fine example of MOPAR muscle steals the show in a classic car-chase film.

The viewer of this awesome road film gets to ride along with Kowalski, Man!  Cops in hot pursuit are everywhere, and there are plenty of opportunities to experience the Challenger's frame-straightening torque and sudden acceleration, even at slow speeds.  Kowalski lights up the rears more than once!  This Challenger is all muscle, Man.

1186342,4,B000005QH3,"Anyone out there, besides me, ever have the aching desire to create some heavy metal thunder tearing ash across a flat, western desert landscape in a supercharged, balls out, 1970s muscle car? Well, now you can, so to speak, at least in terms of living vicariously through the main character in the movie Vanishing Point (1971). Directed by Richard C. Sarafian, who worked on a number of television series throughout the late 1950s and into the 1960s including, but not limited to, ""Maverick"", ""77 Sunset Strip"", ""I Spy"", and ""Batman"", the film stars Barry Newman, whom I last saw in the film Pretty Boy Floyd (1960), which was his film debut, by the way. Also appearing is Cleavon Little (Blazing Saddles, FM), film veteran Dean Jagger (White Christmas, X the Unknown), Paul Koslo (The Omega Man, Joe Kidd), Robert Donner (Cool Hand Luke, Rio Lobo), character actor Anthony James (The Naked Gun 2: The Smell of Fear), Karl Swenson (Major Dundee), Severn Darden (Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, Real Genius), John Amos (Let's Do It Again), and Charlotte Rampling (Zardoz, Orca).

This here's a story about a man named Kowalski (Newman)...a war veteran, ex-cop (dishonorable discharged), former stock car and motorcycle racer, now full time driver, earning his living transporting cars back and forth between Denver and California. The movie begins near the end of the story, as we see Kowalski tearing down a lonely highway in a white, 1970 Dodge Challenger, with a flurry of police activity surrounding him. From here we revert to two days earlier, as Kowalski's dropping off a car in Denver, itching to get back on the road for the return trip out west. After making a pit stop to retrieve some uppers, he's back on the road, drawing the attention of a couple of motorcycle policemen due to his excessive rate of speed. From here on it's white line fever as we flip around, alternating between the present and the past (in a series of flashbacks), with police presence always nearby. Along the way Kowalski runs across a number of different individuals including a sympathetic, blind radio DJ named Super Soul (Little), who, tapped into the police bands, feeds Kowalski vital information, a old timey prospector/snake wrangler (Jagger), a couple of fun boys in a broken down station wagon, a helpful hippy and his nekkid, motorcycle riding girlfriend, a mysterious hitchhiker (played by Rampling), and so on...as Kowalski speeds west, the pieces of his past come together, and he begins to develop a sort of following as people identify with this `outsider' challenging the establishment, but the more popular he becomes, the greater the target he presents for the authorities. It's outsider individualism versus defined conformity, set against a western backdrop, and only one will walk, or drive, away from the final confrontation...

First of all, if you don't enjoy sequence after sequence of cars zipping down the road, this film, despite the themes presented throughout, will probably not appeal to you. Vanishing Point is more or less an art film geared towards motor heads, one that appeals to the instinct of living life on your own terms, despite continual interference from those whose only desire is to quash non-conforming entity (these types of films were very popular in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s). The movie seems operates on two levels, the first, and more superficial, being that of what you see in terms of cars tearing up long stretches of open, desert roads as white knuckled drivers pit their wills against each other, and then the second level being that of the abstruse, non-conformist aspect I alluded to earlier. It does work on both levels, but if you only decide to focus on the superficial aspects, you'll find yourself somewhat bored or lost during the non-driving/interaction sequences between the various offbeat characters and Kowalski...actually, I was somewhat confused, especially in terms of the significance of Rampling's character near the end. She played a spooky hitchhiker whom Kowalski picks up, and ends up shagging. Above and beyond my confusion I found it a little hard to swallow that such a fabulous babe would be hitchhiking...most all hitchhikers I've ever seen have been pretty funky and scary looking. At some point I did sort of give up trying to decide if the various characters had some deeper meaning, or were included for the sake of being there (what was up with that nekkid, blonde, female motorcycle rider?), opting to just go with the flow, content with my own half baked ideas with regards to overall representational elements of the story. I'm not normally a big fan of continual flashbacks, or flashbacks within flashbacks, but I did like how they were used here to flesh out Kowalski's character, displaying the various events throughout his colorful past, providing for a sense of where he's coming from, and where's he's at...I did like the sort of metaphysical relationship between Kowalski and Super Soul (at times they seemed to speak to each other through the one way radio in the Challenger), although I was curious as to why a blind African American disc jockey who specializes in soul music would set up shop in a rural, predominately redneck community. I wouldn't think there'd be much of an audience for his type of broadcasting, more suited to metropolitan areas, but hey, what do I know? I'm no radio programmer. One aspect of the film that really stood out was the vast, scenic, beautiful western vistas used especially well throughout the feature. It'd be worth seeing this movie if only for some of these scenes.

The picture, presented in widescreen (1.85:1) anamorphic, looks quite good, and the Dolby Digital stereo audio is clean and clear. This DVD release features two versions of the film, one being the American release, with a running time of 98 minutes, and the other being the UK version, with a runtime of 106 minutes (the UK version is on the flipside of the disc). As far as extras, there's a commentary track by director Richard C. Sarafian, which I haven't had a chance to check out, two television spots, and a theatrical trailer. The commentary track is available for both versions, while the TV spots are featured on one side of the DVD, and the theatrical trailer on the other.

Jane, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring) as Kolawski and Steve `Mama, we're all crazy' Railsback (The Stunt Man, Alligator II: The Mutation) as a determined law enforcement officer. I haven't seen the newer feature, but I think remakes, in general, are a tricky thing, even more so when dealing with a cult favorite, as is the case here.",1139270400,13,6797,4.922406277244987
1186343,5,B000005QH3,"An open plea to the execs at DaimlerChrysler:

It is certainly a well-known fact that your corporate vision statement is to hide future vehicles in plain sight. With that said, it would be a no-brainer to offer the production version of the Dodge Challenger in a limited run Vanishing Point Edition.

These cars should be positioned above what will obviously be the SRT8 high performance model and be powered by an all aluminum supercharged, intercooled, DOHC version of the 6.1 Hemi with cold air induction and factory cat-back dual exhausts pumping out at least 550 horsepower (I know...I know...they would outpower the current almighty Viper configured this way!) bolted to either a 6 speed manual or manu-matic transmission. Stage III handling suspension, brake and tire package with driver adjustable ride settings (Normal, Touring & Track), 15"" vented brake discs at all 4 corners gripped by 6 piston calipers and Y rated (186 mph) 19"" front and 20"" rear tires should also be included.

Premium leather and walnut trimmed interior also should be part of the package along with a walnut steering wheel and pistol grip shifter (Reminiscent of and paying homage to the 1970 original) bearing a signed and numbered gold or platinum plaque on the center console from the Last American Hero himself, Barry Newman.

For this I would gladly pay a premium over a ""standard"" Challenger!  :-D

1186345,4,B000005QH3,"""Vanishing Point"" like ""Easy Rider"" does not withstand the test of time. It has demons, artsy scenes, and a plot that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Yet it meant something to us then, and that may not be its fault but ours. Like Marc Antony tells Brutus, ""the fault dear Brutus . . ."" well, you know the rest.

I think for these movies as is true in any generation, young people (us) believed that they had the one true vision of reality. This of course is fallacious and self centered, but not necessarily because they are wrong. It's because their is no 'one true vision' and we don't learn that for several more decades and several more busted lips.

So Kowalski thinks that the war in Vietnam was wrong and that it was led by those political leaders as part of a giant conspiracy. Wrong. The war was a result of stupidity and greed and self serving, shallow interests. This was bad news for the 60,000 men and women who died there and 10 times that number who carried scars for the rest of their lives. But there was no conspiracy of evil. Other examples? How about the Crusades? Now they were pretty meaningful. Or Napolean's march on Moscow, Hitler's alliance with Stalin, OUR ALLIANCE WITH STALIN, and the Korean War?

Anyhow, Barry Newman, in the role that would define his body of work, bets he can drive a 1970 Dodge Challenger from Colorado (I think) to San Francisco. We're not sure why but . . . . here are some of the reasons given: Despair over the war in Southeast Asia (not bad, a worthy explanation for being muy loco, his own despondancy over reporting corruption in the police department (we suspect he was kind of like a Harry Callahan who was ridden out of town), and the death of his surfer-hippie girlfriend (???)

So off he goes enroute to becoming a symbol, kind of like Tommy Smith and John Carlos clenching their fists at the 1968 Olympics. His navigator (read soothsayer) is the blind DJ who has mastered what was then limited radio frequency distance, to speak to just Kowalski and give him 'secret' police bulletins. That is until the man comes and crushes his blind behind.

Along the way Kowalski does a lot of speed, sees a gorgeous naked woman on a Japanese motorcycle (that happened to me, golly, almost daily in the 70's), and picks up gay hitchhikers (ditto).

So it's hard to lash out against the machine if you can't pick your target and . . . pick the symbol of what and why you are targeting that/those targets. While not becoming comedic it does become confused.

Some folks have suggested ""Vanishing Point"" became the model for other movies. I don't see it. What I do see is the sullen anti-hero of the 60's, and in a way Kowalski reminds me of the Jake Holman role portrayed by Steve McQueen in ""Sand Pebbles"" (1966, a few years earlier). McQueen did it better because he was probably a better actor however Barry Newman didn't have the writing he needed to work with. I mean there's a naked woman on a Honda riding in circles. What the hell is that supposed to mean?

It's a good movie. Odd but good. Probably you're not going to say 'I forgot how great that movie was!' I will say that the 1970 Dodge that is the centerpiece of the movie is one hot car that old guys like myself still lust after. 4 stars. Larry Scantlebury",1133136000,2,3274,4.454090150250417
1186346,4,B000005QH3,"""Vanishing Point"" is definitely a byproduct of it's time.  Made in the wake of the success of ""Easy Rider"" it plays like a counter-culture episode of ""The Dukes of Hazzard"".  The film is colorfully entertaining and the car chases are cool enough but what does it all mean?  Why does Kowalski(Barry Newman) have to transport the Dodge Challenger from Denver to Frisco at risk to life and limb not the least ticking off the law enforcement who get in his way?  Could it be because of the physical and psychic scars he's carrying?  Is the public that starved for heroics that they choose an outlaw like Kowalski?  Oh, well, it's 1971(practically the sixties).

1186347,5,B000005QH3,"The 70's was full of great chase movies. From Smokey and the Bandit to Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry. This gem ""Vanishing Point"" is ranked high on the list of nonstop action/chase movies of all time. Yeah, the plots were simple. Get your merchandise from point A to point B in a very short time. But, what seperates these great movies of the past compared to today is.....They didn't have to rely on computer imagery or animated scenes. Nor did they  have to rely on the ""F"" word in just about every line to get the message across. I mean just think if they were to cut out every ""F"" word in lets say, Beverly Hills Cop. The movie would probably last about 45 minutes. And if you took out Eddie's irritating laugh it would be reduced to maybe 35 minutes. But, back to Vanishing Point. Bottom line a great movie to take a leisurely spin through the country side. And for you die hard fans of the early 70's softrock group Bread. A very young David Gates appears in The Faith Healer Scene (with Delaney & Bonnie & Friends) playing the piano. Though David was not credited for his role in the movie. So why not plan a Saturday night double feature or a movie marathon weekend with ""VANISHING POINT"", ""DIRTY MARY CRAZY"" and maybe SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT"".",1129593600,4,1243,4.427947598253275
1186348,3,B000005QH3,"I first saw this movie in 1978 on TV, of all places.  I did not remember much of it, but the ending and car always stood out in my memory.  In the late 1980's I looked for it and found VHS copies, but they were $80.00 so I did not get one.  After getting this DVD I was amazed at what I did not remember, or more accurately did not understand when seeing it at such a young age.  The movie hits on many politcal and social issues of the era and challanges cultural norms through brief yet strong images and dialog.  The movie as a whole is choppy, edited bad and made on a small budget.  Character development is left for the imagination along with the reasons behind what is going on around the two main characters.  The themes and issues that the writer and director try to bring out are the movies saving grace.  It appears to be shot over the course of a week on a small budget, but the setup for each scene is done with care and purpose.  Again it is a very memorable movie and with an ending seldom seen in movies at its time or this time.  I believe if a good director and budget came around it would be a good movie to remake.  One of the best car movies of the 1970's.  Hard to follow but the issues the movie addresses are worth looking into.  I can now say I have a copy of the most memorable movie I have ever seen, next to Star Wars and Jaws from my youth.",1126224000,2,1369,4.025925925925926

  BUT, as an interesting footnote to this movie, when I first saw it at the drive-in in the early 70's there was a difference in the version than any I have seen afterwards. At the end, (WARNING-and this can definetly be seen as a *S P O I L E R*!!)-at the crash scene while the cops and people lingered and the last of the music played, they had a few little paragraphs put  up, like newsclips after the fact, and it included, (I cannot recall the exact wording, sorry),the basic statement that the body could not be found and it had disappeared. Does anyone else recall this at the end of the movie? We never forgot that. Anyway,I found it intruiging enough to make mention of-GREAT movie regardless.

Meanwhile there's a subplot of personal demons that haunt him, a blind DJ named Supersoul who has somehow ""connected"" with Kowalski and gives him some help avoiding the cops. The rest is car chase after car chase beautifully shot from every angle possible. The real star here is the white Challenger that eats up everything in its path including a very fast Jag, two gay guys, a and endless amount of coppers. All the chase are top-notch with very little speeding up of the film to add the effect of speed, and the soundtrack is way above average. This film will really take you back to the 60s-early 70s rural America and there's some nice footage of local color in nearly every scene.  I won't spoil the ending which is a surprise for first time viewers and still makes me a bit depressed to this day. many car chase movie have come along since, some very good (The French Connection, Gumball Rally, Bullit), but Vanishing Point is still the measuring stick for true muscle car action.",1124150400,,1162,4.559808612440191

1186393,3,B000005QH3,"First, let me point out that this remake starring Viggo Mortensen is more appropriate for post 9/11 America than during the America of President Clinton. While it is true, that this remake was released not too long after the bombing of Oklahoma City, Ruby Ridge, and the Waco fiasco, I believe that the Government reaction was more in tune with the paranoia of terrorism now than what it would it would have been in 1996 or 1997. President Bush probably would have labeled Kowalski in league with Osama Bin Laden!

Anyway, both movies have their pros and cons: Both have shaky plots: A car chase across the western states? Excitement galore!!!

But there is something about the original that the remake cannot touch. It may be the free spirit that the original had. After all, the original was released in 1970.

However, the remake had a better back story (the wife in the hospital) and it gave the crash a bit more humanity. the remake erred when it suggested that Kowalski could have survived. Let the audience draw their own conclusion.

The crash in the original was the end of the movie. I liked the indifference of the spectators. After Newman's Kowalski crashed, the people seemed to shrug and leave after the debacle. It was as if the people saw their excitement for the day then went back to their daily routine.",1117497600,3,1322,4.685344827586207

Anyway, everyone who buys the DVD in widescreen should know that in comparing it with the fullscreen VHS, it appears that Vanishing point was originally filmed in the 4:3 aspect ratio (the same as TV) and the film's top and bottom were matted to give the ""Flat"" aspect ratio of 1.85:1. So in other words, this is one of those rare instances where you actually see LESS of the picture in the widescreen version!

1186395,5,B000005QH3,"I should hate this movie. I always wanted a '70 Challenger R/T and in some part thanks to this classic, offbeat movie, prices have now skyrocketed far beyond what I could pay for one. This is a REAL Cult movie. Mopar fanatics have long exchanged philosophical points of view about it and if it had used a bigger name actor, it could have immediately done to the Dodge Challenger what Dirty Harry did for the Smith & Wesson 44 Magnum. Obviously, the Dodge Boys missed a real marketing opportunity back then. Instead, for almost three decades it languished almost unseen, occassional showing up on Cinemax or some video catalog for sixty bucks or more. Now, to my regret, it is available to the unwashed masses (just kidding, sort of) and even spawned a remake.

Now, about that remake. Fox TV did this back in '96 and the Vanishing Point purist that I am, I cringed with anticipation of this. I admit I liked it, not as a remake, but as a '90's version of Kowaslki's journey. Now it seems to have shuffled off to its own video Purgatory. The story made use of the paranoia of the times much like the '70's version did of the anomie of the Vietnam era. So it was not the equal of the original, but did not try to simply retell the story because each decade had its own social dynamics to contend with. if you haven't seen it, it starred Viggo Mortenson before many people had heard of him. Steve Railsback is his usual overcaffeined loose gun going after Kowalski in his black '70 Charger named The Beast. At least we got two stunning Mopars driving like heck through John Ford country. Now back to the original:

Nowadays driving 150 mph into a bulldozer is something you would only do on Fear Factor. Back in the early '70's, it was not that common either, but any teen facing a possible hitch in Vietnam might find it a preferable fate. Such was youth in the days of draft, war, race riots, and cheap gas. Kowalski is an outcast in a lost generation and is like the last wild mustang of the west-I guess it would have been too obvious if he were driving a Boss 429 or even a white (Dodge) Charger. Cleavon Little is Super Soul, actually the Superego trying to bring Kowalski back from his doomed Id-yssey. I was always amused for years over the fact that his flight begins on the incomplete I-70 west of Denver, and that in the '90's it was STILL under construction. Kowalski may be a drugged out anti-hero, but he is still portrayed as a man with more integrity than society who will still take the time to see if that cop he just ran off the road has survived his rollover. They don't make 'em like that anymore. As part of a triumvirate of social misfit car chase movies of the early '70's (Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry and Two-lane Blacktop being the others) this is the best. If you grew up in those times you will dig it, if you were too young, you might just wonder what the heck is up with this dude and dismiss it. That would be your loss.",1111017600,9,2944,4.37043795620438
1186396,5,B000005QH3,"Richard Sarafian's 1971 film ""Vanishing Point"" is, for starters, a fascinating study of those persons anthropologists sometimes term ""marginal men""--individuals caught between two powerful and competing cultures, sharing some important aspects of both but not a true part of either, and, as such, remain tragically confined to an often-painful existential loneliness. Inhabiting a sort of twilight zone between ""here"" and ""there,"" a sort of peculiar purgatory, these restless specters cannot find any peace or place, so they instead instinctively press madly on to some obscure and unknown destination, the relentless journey itself being the only reason and justification.

Disc jockey Super Soul (Cleavon Little) and delivery driver Kowalski (Barry Newman) are two of these specters, marginal but decent, intelligent men who can't or won't live in burgeoning competing cultures which in reality have offered them very little of worth or substance, despite their own personal sacrifices. Kowalski himself had tried to ""fit in"" with the Establishment as a soldier and police officer and later, attempted to do the same with the blossoming 1960s counterculture, but soon disappointingly found that they both were ridden with their own various forms of dishonesty and insincerity. Personal honor, self-reliance, honesty, justice and genuine respect--Kowalski's stock in trade--were tragically valued very little by either, despite each one's shrill and haughty claims to the contrary.

Moreover, it's no accident Newman's character has a Polish surname; the Poles throughout their history have created a very rich and unique Slavic culture largely based upon just such a ""marginality""--being geographically jammed between two powerful and radically different historic enemies, Germany and Russia, and never being able to fully identify with either one, at often great cost to themselves. It's also no accident Little's character is blind and black, the only one of his kind in a small, all-Caucasian western desert town--his sightlessness enhancing his persuasiveness and his ability to read Kowalski's mind, the radio microphone his voice, his race being the focus of long simmering and later suddenly explosive disdain--all of the characteristics of a far-seeing prophet unjustly (but typically) dishonored in his own land.

The desert environment also plays a key role in cementing the personal relationship between and respective fates of these two men--to paraphrase British novelist J.G. Ballard, prophets throughout our history have emerged from deserts of some sort since deserts have, in a sense, exhausted their own futures (like Kowalski himself had already done) and thus are free of the concepts of time and existence as we have conventionally known them (as Super Soul instinctively knew, thus creating his own psychic link to the doomed driver.) Everything is somehow possible, and yet, somehow nothing is.

Finally, ""Vanishing Point"" is also a ""fin de siecle"" story, a unique requiem for a quickly dying age,a now all-but-disappeared one of truly open roads, endless speed for the joy of speed's sake, of big, solid muscle cars, of taking radical chances, of living on the edge in a colorful world of endless possibility, seasoned with a large number and wide variety of all sorts of unusual characters straight from the minds of Mark Twain and Nelson Algren, all of which had long made the USA a wonderful place. ""Vanishing Point"" poignantly shows us that such a world was already slipping away in 1971, and now, over 30 years later, it sadly is but a fond memory, having been brutally supplanted by today's swarms of sadistic, military-weaponed cop-thugs, obsessive and intrusive safety freaks, soulless toll plazas, smug yuppie SUV drivers, tedious carbon-copy latte towns, and a infantile craving for perfect, high-fuel-efficiency safety and security, rather than individual liberty, at all costs, a ""brave new world"" where simply wanting to be left alone amidst Orwellian chants of ""it's for the children"" and ""either you're with us or against us"" is now tantamount to near-treason.

The DVD contains both the US and UK releases of the film; the UK release, I believe, is a much more satisfying film, as it has the original scenes deleted from the US version. As an aside, Super Soul's radio station call letters, KOW, are in fact the ones for a country & western station in San Diego.",1109894400,28,4404,5.367583212735166

We find through flashbacks that Kowalski was once a motorcycle and auto racer, an ex-cop as well as in the military. We also learn that His wife drowned while surfing.

Along the way of being chased by cops on motorcylces as well in other MOPARS, he is challenged to a hi-speed race with a jaguar, gets some much needed gasoline from some 'Jesus people' in the desert, is aided by a blind disc-jockey named 'supersoul' (Cleavon Little) and others along the way to avoid the police, all leading to the climatic ending.

1186433,5,B000005QH3,"This movie held me spellbound the first time I saw it and is still capable of this after countless viewings. This is more than just a car chase movie, it actually has depth and a story to tell. The scenery of the great American West is also first rate and the soundtrack never fails to set the mood.
The story of the main character, an auto delivery driver named Kowalski unfolds as he takes delivery of a white '70 Dodge Challenger which is as he puts it `souped up to 160' and proceeds to drive it from Denver to San Francisco. His plan, however is to do this in 15 hours to win a bet. As Kowalski makes his journey his life is revealed to us through flashbacks and recollections which are usually triggered by what is currently happening to him in real time. Through these the viewer learns that despite his apparent lawless behavior, Kowalski is a man of good character.
It is this good character, sense of duty and strong moral code that led to Kowalski's fallout with the establishment.  He had been a decorated war hero and was honorably discharged from the military.  A few years later, he was a decorated policeman.  However, when he saw his police partner behaving in an unsavory fashion, he reacted.  His reward was to be dishonorably discharged from the police force.  This ultimately led Kowalski down the path to where we are introduced to him.
One of the big things that drew me into this movie is that it doesn't hand you the explanations on a silver platter. Instead it allows you to think about it and draw your own conclusions long after you've seen it.  Some reviewers on IMDB have already done a great job of touching on the philosophies of freedom and individualism prevalent in this movie, so I won't waste the time trying to top those. I'll add that I feel this is a type of an expressionist film. Kowalski is kind of an `Everyman' who is on a journey to find his place in the grand scheme of things. Along his path he encounters various characters that watch over him and help him along, but there are also those who wish to shut him down. Whether you think the conclusion of Kowalski's journey is successful or not is up to you.
Another big plus is the realism in the driving scenes, where the drivers are actually driving their machines and occasionally things happen like tires going flat or the car needs fuel. Most modern car chase sequences leave me wanting with all of the computer generated car moves and general lack of realism. I know they sometimes got it wrong back then too, doing things like obviously speeding the film up. In this one though, they got it right. The driving here brings us into that realm of manhandling 4000 lbs. of American Iron, in all the glory of big-block V8 roar, screaming smoking tires, and hands grappling with the steering wheel.
Another thing that's cool to me about this type of movie is the appearance of the car. At the beginning, the car is resplendent in gleaming chrome and white paint. As the story moves along, the car gradually gets a more dusty battered countenance. I won't spoil the end, but those who've seen it know.
The final things that tie this whole thing together are the soundtrack and scenery. They seem to go hand in hand, from the upbeat rock & roll as Kowalski starts out to the stirring guitar strains during the thoughtful moments. I also cannot say enough about the scenery, which really draws the viewer in. It ranges from the mountains of Colorado, across Utah and into the searing Nevada desert.
In closing, I'll say that this is one of my favorite movies. It won't be understood by everyone, but those of us who fantasize about getting in a classic car and blasting down an open two-lane highway devoid of SUV's, sport sedans and minivans will likely get it.",1089504000,15,3757,4.542097488921714

The excised scenes add just a tad more insight into Kowalski's character; while not essential to the whole plot (such as it is), these scenes ARE interesting and definitely will be appreciated by hardcore fans of the film.  Kudos to 20th Century Fox for making available both versions.  Being a real fan of the era that this movie was shot in, it's a kick to hear director Richard C. Sarafian's commentary track.

How many times we watched it on Beta, stopping, rewinding, analysing, in a basement apartment in Normal, Illinois, while the snow mounded up against the frozen windows.
There was an article in a Mopar Magazine in the early '90's that talked about the two sequences with Charlotte Rampling that had been cut from US distribution.  I am still hoping someday to see the one with her in the black hat, where she hisses at Kowalksi and becomes the malevolent spectre of his imminent death. Until then, I am happy to have at last the hitchhiker scene.  It adds a darkness and a texture that enhances the end of the film.  I am sorry that it was cut.  The Sarafian commentary adds a lot too.  Finally!  It is a good thing.",1080259200,8,953,4.473988439306359

""Now you're messin with a ...""
When you're 15 or 16, it just makes sense that a grown up, like  ex-cop Kowalski wants to drive a supercharged Dodge from Denver, Colorado to San Francisco in 15 hours. The powers that be have done a great job restoring both visual and audio to this film. The late Cleavon Little runs a very close second to the car as the take over star. You get to see Delaney, Bonnie (Bramlett) & Friends including Big Mama Thornton. And let's not forget the naked blond babe in the desert.
Anyway I just was not getting the right memories sitting in my comfortable living room watching this classic so if you're missing the good old days, try this: Get some friends to help carry the big screen tv set  and dvd player into the garage. Get your kids old swing set and place it between you and the screen. Put up those yellow bug light spot lights just to the right or left of where the screen is. Park your car at the bottom of the drive way. Run a bad sounding speaker out to one of the side windows. Remove one windshield wiper. Turn on sprinkler system so it simulates a heavy drizzle. About 30 minutes of the movie, run into the house and tear up a $20 bill. Bring back popcorn, nachos, cokes for the kids, cups of ice for the grown ups (still only a quarter each.) Forget napkins, and going to restroom. And go back and enjoy the movie! To add realism honk your horn, moon passers by, and flash headlights at screen!
Throw trash on your lawn and drive off with speaker still in your car. Watch broken glass as your leaving. Drive around for a few hours or stop to neck. Then sneak into your own house before your teenage children get home.
This is a ""have fun"" and enjoy movie. The bonuses are almost none existent (a 20 second TV trailer, a 1:00 minute TV trailer) and that sort of stuff.
Don't criticize this one by comparing it to the new ones, just smile shake your head and reminisce. I still want that Challenger and Bullitt's Mustang AND CHARGER. No sissy toyotas in my movies!!!

1186438,5,B000005QH3,"My favorite road movie of all time. I think this is a better film than Easy Rider. Barry Newman's subtle non-machismo performance is the perfect contrast to the awesome muscle car which carries him to his vanishing point. I just listened to the dvd commentary track by director Richard C Sarafian, where he claims his choice for Newman's role was Gene Hackman. I don't think Hackman could have done a better job, in fact the balance of the car and the driver would not have been the same. Gene Hackman is an incredible actor, but Barry Newman was, in my opinion, ideal for this film. A work of great beauty, and the haunting loss of a freer epoch. Incredible handheld cinematography by the late great John A Alonzo, married to an uplifting and deeply poignant soundtrack. This film can be viewed on many different levels from an exciting car chase movie to a true American existential classic. I never get tired of works of art and Vanishing Point is such a work. I can't understand why 20th Century Fox failed to put out a soundtrack album. ""Another Soul Goes Free""",1079740800,12,1066,4.61578947368421

1186440,5,B000005QH3,"Vanishing Point is one of the great existential counter-culture films of the 1970s. Like the similar-minded films, most notably, Two-Lane Blacktop and Duel, this car chase movie features an anti-hero protagonist who equates the open road with freedom and staying in one place for too long with death. For years we have had to suffer with pan and scanned VHS copies but now it has finally arrived on DVD in its original aspect ratio.
Fans of Vanishing Point are in for a real treat as both the US and UK versions of the film have been made available on DVD. The UK version runs seven minutes longer and features a scene where Kowalski picks up a female hitchhiker.
Director Richard C. Sarafian contributes an engaging audio commentary. So little has been written about Vanishing Point and it is great to hear Sarafian talk at length about his experiences making the movie.
Also included are vintage TV spots and a theatrical trailer that features wonderfully kitschy ad copy: ""Everyone wants a piece of his hide!""
Vanishing Point is a cult film that has endured over the years. UK music group Primal Scream named their 1997 album after the movie and even recorded a song entitled ""Kowalski"" that features samples from the movie. Audioslave took their love of the film even further and brilliantly recreated and condensed the movie into a music video for their song, ""Show Me How To Live."" The video incorporates actual footage from the movie and replaces Kowalski with the band. After years of obscurity, Vanishing Point has finally been given proper DVD treatment with an excellent transfer and made both versions available for fans to compare and contrast.",1078963200,7,1657,4.900355871886121

Kowalski heads west through the big space from Denver to San Francisco and along the way meets up with counterkulture characters amoung them a blind DJ(Cleavon Little)who can see into Kowalski's mind and broadcasts his epic endeavour to outpace his pursuers, achieving mythic status as he speeds down the road towards his destination.

1186473,4,B000005QH3,"""Vanishing Point"" is a film that follows a very powerful storytelling device: tell the audience where the story ends, then take them there.  We know Kowalski's fate before the film begins and yet still we find ourselves rooting for his victory.  In the film, Kowalski sets out on an impossible mission: make it from Denver to San Francisco in a matter of hours while evading the cops.  Along the way, we get glimpses of Kowalski's past, a history of disenchantment with war, the government, the system, etc.  This disenchantment is picked up by those who support ""the last American cowboy's"" journey.  His quest for speed comes to represent his defiance of authority and his path to victory.  On one level, Kowalski becomes the sacrificial victim at the cost of losing a bet and a few speeding tickets.  On a different level, Kowalski's quest becomes a path to freedom and, in the end, complete freedom.
""Vanishing Point"" does not have an excess of dialogue.  This film could have been a silent picture for all intensive purposes.  The themes and storyline are so simple and clear that one does not need much dialogue for the story to unfold.  With some great shots of the 1970 Challenger and some gorgeous countryside and flatlands, ""Vanishing Point"" makes for a great film for all car enthusiasts and those who enjoy a more artistically driven film than most.",1076976000,3,1361,4.827586206896552

So much so that in the summer of 2003 I retraced Kowalski's path from Colorado through Utah and Nevada in my 1970 Challenger RT. It's a long, long ride but the scenery is still magnificent and the Challenger still dominates the highway (and surprises the occassional state trooper like the one who eyed me just outside of Eureka, Nevada - arriving a minute earlier he would have heard me go by at 140 mph.

1186479,5,B000005QH3,"You may need to be over 40 to appreciate the social contrasts of American life in 1971 and today.  In April of that year an estimated 500,000 Americans were in Washington DC protesting against our involvement in Vietnam.  Howard Hughes was still living; NASA sent a probe to Mars while the crew of Apollo 15 was riding for the first time in the Lunar Rover.  Charles Manson and `family' were found guilty for the murder of Sharon Tate.  The U.A.E. (United Arab Emirates) was formed this year, so was the Libertarian party in the USA.  The Concord SST was doing flight tests, Intel announced their 4004 chip, and the movie Vanishing Point began showing in our local movie houses.
The star of the movie is not the '70 Dodge Challenger; rather the star is the freedom the car and its driver are trying to attain through speed, and ultimately death.  Most of us never know when we'll die, yet the character Kowalski seems to have one up on us.  He has been running through life's trials like questions with multiple choice answers, eliminating the obvious wrong answers first.
The vast open spaces the cinematography so wonderfully capture frame the path to the Pearly Gates; rather a crack of light between the blades of a couple of CAT dozers that Director Sarafian refers to as a crack in the fence.  Kowalski's soul is about to be set free and the Challenger is just the vehicle that can go fast enough to do it.
As Insurance company's rates soared for muscle cars and Emissions standards pummeled high output engines, the whole muscle car era faded to black in a few years.  The movie Vanishing Point is a time machine - the beginning of the end.
The DVD version is by far my favorite which includes Mr. Sarafian's narration as an option.  I would have loved to have heard Barry Newman and Clevon Little (sadly deceased in 1992), and or some of the crew with Sarafian discuss the making of the film.

1186504,5,B000005QH3,"The story begins at the end, where we are shown a roadblock of monstrous proportions, and a white 1970 Dodge Challenger rocketing toward it.  From there the tale begins, backing up two days to give the rest of the story.  An interstate chase is on for the driver of the Challenger, whom we know nothing at all about.  As the story unfolds, the identity of the driver is rationed out in flashbacks and news reports, slowly bringing into focus the nature of the character.  At first, we naturally assume the driver to be a simple car thief, as does law enforcement.  Gradually, we learn that the driver is not a thief at all, he is simply delivering the car. He is a decorated Vietnam veteran who joined the police department after his honorable discharge, married a beautiful girl, and then lost her in a surfing accident.  Not long after, he stopped a senior officer from beating and raping a young hippie girl, and was dishonorably discharged from the force.  We also learn that his high-octane burn across the desert is to satisfy a simple wager: if he makes it from Denver to San Francisco in less than 15 hours, he doesn't have to pay for the amphetamines he bought to keep him awake for the trip.  He is guided along the way by blind disc jockey ""Supersoul"" (Cleavon Little), who speaks to the driver (whose name is we learn is Kowalski (no last name given, via the AM radio in the Challenger.  Supersoul is Kowalski's invisible guardian angel, advising him of the cop's attempts to stop him, at least until some local rednecks bust into the radio station with a storm of rocks and racial epithets and beat Super Soul and his engineer into submission.  As Kowalski rockets across the blasted desert landscape, he encounters numerous crackpots and visionaries, all of whom seem to offer another piece to the puzzle that Kowalski's life has become.  From prospectors to faith healers, outlaws to newlywed hijackers, we are given a glimpse into a world that exists far from the beaten track we all travel each day.  As Kowalski hurtles toward his date with the destiny that was mapped out for us at the very beginning of the film, each rumor and news report seems to contradict the image of him that is being played out by the police of several states, elevating him to something of a folk hero among a growing legion of fans and supporters.
This movie knocked me out from the very beginning.  For those die-hards, yes, there are plenty of car chases and stunts to satisfy most fans of car/action films.  But that's not the whole story, by any measure.  For this is the story of one man, not a mythic legend, or even a regional folk hero.  Why does he do what he does?  He simply has nothing left to lose or gain.  How many men returned from Vietnam at least a little disillusioned by the world they came home to?  How many have had their lives mapped out neat and pretty, only to have the blind monkey wrench of fate turn their worlds upside down?  Here is a man who is perfectly willing to sacrifice his freedom, his safety, and possibly even his life to win what amounts to a ten-dollar bet, at best.  When Kowalski finally arrives at the roadblock, the inevitable conclusion to his odyssey, he takes the only road he knows, a path which had been set for him ever since the beginning.

On a cinematic level, the influence of Vanishing Point is far reaching, indeed.  The story of a jaded ex-cop who has lost his wife, his hope and, to a degree, his humanity, was taken and nitro-injected in George Miller's Mad Max (1979) and the Road Warrior (1982), as Max Rockatansky (not too far a reach from Kowalski) has his life violently ripped out from under him, and thus turns to the open road. At first for revenge, but then because it is the only world he can exist in, a place where jungle law prevails.  By then, Max is nothing more than a shell, a ghost of a human who haunts the blighted landscape propelled by a hunger not even he can understand.  One of the most effective plot devices is that of not giving the protagonist a name until well into the film.  Joel Schumaker used this technique very well in his good movie Falling Down (1993), not giving Michael Douglas' character a name until the final act of the film's story.  By doing this, we are allowed to see the character as a sort of everyman, someone whom we may know, or may even be.  We are then free to observe the goings-on at a much more personal level, knowing all too well that the story being played out upon the screen could, given the right circumstances, be any of us, and to that end, possibly even all of us.  By the time we learn that the character is someone, it's too late.  They are already a part of us, bound by destiny and experience.  Also of note is the using of a disc jockey to provide a running commentary on the nature and exploits of the protagonist (as well as provide a reasonable source for the music in the film), a device used, to lesser effect, in Walter Hill's The Warriors (1979).  Lastly, although film characters have been bumping into oddballs in the desert for years, Abbe Wool's wonderful Roadside Prophets (1992) stands out as the protagonists wander through the desert, encountering numerous wisdom-dispensing desert dwellers, each contributing their ideas, ideals, and experiences in a way that lends toward a larger collective ideology wherein a greater truth resides.

1186562,5,B000005QH3,"The caption on the movie poster read, ""Makes Bullit look like drivers' training."" This was back in the days when a new car was larger than a sofa and didn't resemble a jelly bean or a bar of soap so much as a statement of aesthetic poise and integrity.
The movie is a sort of mock epic of an anti-heroes' journey through the desert from Denver to San Francisco in what is supposed to happen in less than 15 hours. Although he supposedly commits suicide by running into two buldozers at 160 mph, the beginning shows him spinning around to again elude the state troopers. He is then shown delivering a 1970 Chrysler Imperial to where he will get a 1970 Dodge Hemi Challenger R/T and attempt to deliver it to its destination in 15 hours. Because the end shows a 1969 Camaro crashing into the bulldozers, and the beginning shows him eluding the state troopers, it becomes questionable if he does commit suicide. The twin themes of speed and death that permeate the film give it a sense of adrenaline, that perhaps speed is what makes one feel the most alive, and in this sense one eludes death, if only temporarily.
I liked the scene where Kowalski is challenged by a Jaguar XKE, but hated to see a Jaguar get destroyed. Maybe they could have used a Pinto with a Boss 302, instead of a Jaguar.
Although it featured a great soundtrack, songs such as The Allman Brothers' ""Midnight Rider"", Free's ""Allright Now,"" Led Zepplins' ""Heartbreaker,"" or even the later released Deep Purples' ""Highway Star"" would have worked well in this film.
Another thing worth mentioning is that this film has much in common with ""Easy Rider."" This was yet another counter-culture film where the police, the government, and the establishment are all the bad guys and are given stereotypical roles.
Although Kowalski doesn't have much dialogue in this film, we are granted insight into his character through a series of flashbacks that show him as a frustrated and idealistic loner. Therefore it seems likely that speed and death are the only solutions he chooses to solve his problems. But the scene where the Camaro crashes into the bulldozers raises the question, did he, or didn't he?",1034380800,10,2160,4.716931216931217
1186563,4,B000005QH3,"The 1972 existential road movie ""Vanishing Point"" succeeds on so many levels, that it is difficult to pinpoint any one reason for its enduring popularity. This rousing, if not groovy, car-chase flick has so much going for it, most notably the era in which it was produced (early 1970s, Woodstock generation).
....
""Vanishing Point's"" main protagonist, a speed-popping anti-hero known as Kowalski - nicely played by Barry Newman - is an unshaven, darker version of the Steve McQueen persona perfected in the film ""Bullit."" In fact, ""Vanishing Point"" is just a full-length movie version of that film's now-famous car chase scene. But the filmmakers (director Richard C. Sarafian, writer Guillermo Cain) got lucky. They located the car chase along the stretches of America's breathtaking western landscape. They chose a car, a growling white Challenger, that had extraordinary esthetic muscle. And they gave Kowalski an energetic, anti-establishment sidekick in radio DJ Super Soul, superbly played by the late Cleavon Little.
And the dream-like imagery, including a nude woman upon a motorcycle, a hippie commune performing an impromptu concert in the Nevada desert, and of course, Kowalski driving aimlessly across the desert as if lost in his own hallucination, all contribute to a film that plays like one long MTV video a full decade before that medium was created. Certainly the contemporary psychedelic/folk music (including Mountain and Kim Carnes) contributes to the overall counterculture allure of ""Vanishing Point.""
Like an odd puzzle where the pieces never entirely fall into place (another part of the attraction to this film is it can be interpreted a number of ways), ""Vanishing Point"" tells the story of one Kowalski, an aimless driver who delivers cars for a living. On a bet, he decides to deliver a Challenger from Denver to San Francisco within 15 hours. He's eventually chased by policemen from three different states as they attempt to put a halt to his speed odyssey. DJ Super Soul picks up on the story on the scanner, and begins to give Kowalski secret tips on the air to elude police roadblocks. It all leads to an explosive conclusion on the California border which will stay with the viewer long after the film's final credits.
""Vanishing Point"" moves at such a breakneck pace, one can forgive the film for its many faults. These would include the multiple out-of-place flashbacks, detailing Kowalski's troubled life; the comedic portrayal of policemen as bumbling keystone cops; and several heavy-handed scenes of symbolism portraying Kowalski as a Messiah-like figure.
But the filmmakers captured this counterculture era almost perfectly, and the image of Kowalski speeding across the plains of Colorado and Nevada, staring off into the sun-baked western landscape of nowhere through the dusty windshield of a roaring Challenger, is about as cool an American symbol of rebellion as one will ever see on film. And that is why ""Vanishing Point"" is such a terrific film. After 30 years, this groovy drive-in flick which came out of nowhere to become a cult classic, is still ""cool.""",1031961600,19,3107,5.191235059760956
1186564,5,B000005QH3,"This is a classic movie that is as much social commentary as car chase.  I remember watching this on a Saturday matinee on my local television station (long before the advent of cable television) and was mesmerized.
I recently purchased the VHS version and it was just as sweet twenty years later.
The premise isn't much: the main character, former member of society now riding on the fringe, has to get a car to San Francisco in 15 hours.  Load up on amphetamines and off we go.  The 'plot' is merely a vehicle for the ride.
The car chase scenes are great and realistic (none of the special effects laden hocus pocus you see today) and the cinematography of the West is beautiful.  The characters, from the DJ who plays mystical guide to the helpers the driver meets in the desert, show life on the fringe.  I'm sure on some level this is a mystical, metaphorical journey of sorts but to me it is simply fun to watch.
The soundtrack is absolutely great.  It is kind of the O Brother Where Art Thou of the 70s -- the one that missed the radar.  It isn't music you hear on the radio and it certainly isn't mainstream in any fashion but it sure is good.
I give this five stars quite simply because of the cinematography, the cast of characters and the music.  Well worth the visit.  They just don't make films like this anymore.",1030233600,74,1326,4.401639344262295

Overtly, the movie doesn't appear to have much of a plot (just another car chase movie). It may have something to do with the amount of editing that was done. I read somewhere that a significant desert scene was cut from the original. To truely appreciate this movie, the viewer must assume the persona of Kowalski, which by loose definition is having nothing else in life to lose. What sets this movie apart is Kowalski's attitude. He knows that he is in a ""no-win"", ""no-way-out"" situation.

Thankfully it has been released on VHS for it's second time. The packaging is different on the first VHS release of Vanishing Point. Starring Barry Newman as a an ex-cop and race car driver named Kowalski, his job is to drive a suped up 1970 Dodge Challenger from Denver to San Francisco in 24 hours or less. He drives the state cops nuts with his antics and soon all the state troopers from Colorado to California are after him. As he drives this musclecar he flashes back images to his days a a cop, his affair with a girlfriend hippy and as a race car driver. He has the help of Super Soul (Cleavon Little) a small town disc jocky helping him and letting him know which routes are crawling with cops.

Again, while Kowalski's odyssey may specifically reference the post-Woodstock era of diminished meaning & dwindling spiritual freedom, the all-encompassing need to KNOW & embracepersonal meaning is still very much alive.

Like a Tiger, they (musclecars)  should be admired for their beauty and strength, but not set loose at full  boil on an unsuspecting public. WHAT was so romantic about this film????? A  man high on dope, running from the police, on public highways, in a high  performance Mopar? And all for what? A bet. Yep.....this movie ranks right  up there with Smokey and the Bandit for sheer stupidity. Actually, this  movie was before that time, but with one difference, Burt Reynolds was not  high as a kite.  Now, I love a good action flick, same as most anyone. In a  good movie, you can forget about your troubles for awhile, and not worry  about everyday troubles. But even in 1971, this movie sent out all the  wrong messages. It's Ok to flee from police just because you made a bet  with someone. It's Ok to speed on public highways to your heart's content,  as long as you're ""The Last Free Spirit."" As long as you have a  cool, fast car, and you're polite to people, it's OK to do these things.  My problem with this movie (and yes, I did see it at the drive-in theatre  in 71) is the way the movie, and fans alike, glorify the character.  Behavior of that type was just as stupid in 1971, AS IT IS TODAY.  If a  maniac ran you off the road while fleeing from the police, would you  ""understand,"" simply because he or she was the last ""free  person?""  People take this film waaaaaaaay to seriously. Freedom?  Freedom from WHAT?????? Oh.....it must be the freedom we all desire from  those ruthless American Gestapo agents. You know, not being able to own a  fast car.

He WAS a hero, a good cop, a good  racer, but his surfer girlfriend led him into drugs and a life leading to  ruin.  Typical of many in that era (which I survived without drugs, and I'm  52 now, in Sep. 2000).
Anyway, at the beginning, it is 10:02 AM Sunday,  and he vanishes as he passes an oncoming car.  At the end, it is 10:04 AM  Sunday, and he crashes into the bulldozers.  My private interpretation: at  10:02, he ""vanished"" in his sleep-deprived and  ""speed""-warped mind, so he thought he had vanished from the sight  of the police.  (There was no hint that he was suicidal.) Somehow, this  also meant to him that he could not be touched, so he figured he could  drive right through the dozers, they would not see him or hurt him, and he  would be home free. As they say, ""speed"" kills.

The character development is occasionally over-simplified, but not always -  there's some especially fine acting by a few of the minor characters.  In  what other film would someone lost in the desert run into a gospel rock  performance by Bonnie & Delany (in real life, one of their fans &  occasional collaborators was Eric Clapton).  This film is worth seeing many  times over, but DON'T let anyone watch it who doesn't see it from the very  beginning (it's crucial later for getting the full emotional impact of the  story).",923356800,4,741,4.537878787878788
1186736,5,B000005QH3,"This is much more than a film about a car chase. For those that lived in those times it is a wonderful example of searching for truth in times when truth was hard to come by (Viet Nam, bigotry). It's the story of a black  man and a white man joined in the brotherhood of righteousness. Two men  joined by their search for truth not separated by their color. And, it  shows the ultimate form of demonstration against the crooked establishment  by performing the ultimate sacrifice, taking a downward spiraling life and  sending it into infamy, if only for a moment. And, for us old hot rodders  who saw it at least eleven times at the drive in, it is some of the best  chase scenes on film.",923356800,2,689,4.3359375

Whether it be the great tunes stirred up by super soul from  KOW (just happens be be kowalski's 1st three!) or the buddies with  benzadrine, he runs us west from Denver in the spin of our lives.  The hemi  r/t Challanger has no equal!  Interesting twist is take a look at the snake  collector- what christmas favourite did he star  in?  no wonder years  after Primal Scream put together audio disc called vanishing point!!!  great tunes there as well.  My tired worn out copy from '71 will now be  put to rest.
