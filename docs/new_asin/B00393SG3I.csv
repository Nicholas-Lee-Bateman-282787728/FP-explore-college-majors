4093002,5,B00393SG3I,"Before Ninja Turles, before Power Rangers, before Thundercats, before the rest, there was Voltron - Lion Force. The true heroes of the galaxy. This Part 2 disc set is the completion of the set. If you have the first, you'll NEED to get this one also. If you haven't seen either before, stop what you're doing, buy this and buy the first set as well. Your life will change for the better. Trust me. ;)",1378252800,2,400,4.346666666666667
4093003,4,B00393SG3I,If you're a fan of lion force voltron and are looking to buy all the episodes this is the way to go. Its the exact same disks from the 5 box set they did with the lions on the cover but much cheaper. The only downside is the box is basically just a CD spindle with all the disks on it which means if you want disk six you need to tale 1-5 out to get to it.,1333411200,7,356,3.576923076923077

It seems the ""special features"" have all been carried over from the previous five sets without the addition of exclusive bonus content, which would really have made this set worth having. Well, I guess there's always the space saving case aspect.

The artwork for ""Part 2"" is slightly less generic than ""Part 1"" in that I prefer the cover photo better with all SIX members of the team (in their trademark street clothes), same old crossed arm Voltron in the background though. Actualy, this should've been the cover for ""Part 1"" as Sven and the plain clothed team were featured more in the beginning of the show. Where as the uniformed, Allura featured team pic from the ""Part 1"" cover better represents the later episodes of the show.

I will try to post again with more details once I open this collection, unless someone beats me to it. Enjoy!

WARNING!!!!!!DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Like Voltron Lion Force Part 1, this is the exact same set of discs from the individual sets packed on top of each other, around a weird spindle in the middle of the case, like a pack of blank dvd-r's. There's no booklet or extras, just two funky postcards kind inside. If you've already purchased the five lion sets, then don't buy this one or Part 1. It's not worth it.",1276473600,15,1607,4.787003610108303

8391903,3,B00393SG3I,Great show from childhood. This set (lion force part 2) should have discs 8 through 15. However my set is missing 8 and 10 instead has two 9s and two 11s. Shows great. Disappointed to be missing twelve episodes.,1456272000,,211,4.435897435897436
8391904,5,B00393SG3I,"Really good deal for cartoon nostalgia.  Although a bit grainy b/c of age; to see the beginnings of Voltron was remarkable.
There is drama and intrigue with every episode.  This is a good addition for a cartoon collection.",1426723200,2,222,4.815789473684211
8391905,5,B00393SG3I,"This is a must for children of the eighties. Others will love it, too.",1421020800,,70,4.071428571428571
8391906,4,B00393SG3I,"This is an awesome, one stop collection for anyone that didn't buy the original, tin sets!  If you own the tins then this isn't for you as it is basically a repackaged version of those releases.  In terms of the actual show, my biggest gribe is that you have to watch the show opening with every episode.  At first I thought it was awesome, but you quickly tire of it after a few episodes.  Otherwise, a great set to relive some childhood memories!",1417305600,2,448,4.36144578313253
