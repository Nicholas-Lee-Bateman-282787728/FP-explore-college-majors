6411800,5,B00KB01OG8,"Just picked up an advance copy at my local Record store for $70 CDN ($60 US) , how exciting, new opening and closing credits, 31 hours of 36 digitally remastered 52 minute episodes on 10 discs, that's less than $2 US per episode. Excellent bright, clear, crisp, sharp picture image, colorful easy to navigate menus, optional subitles provided, clean professional packaging... altogether a perfect product.

THIS IS THE BEST TV SHOW OF ALL TIME. Top notch stories, as good as in any other previous season, and why not, it's the same group of writers (mainly John Meston, Kathleen Hite, Les Crutchfield). Marshall Dillon is as tough and compassionate as he ever was. In fact, some of the episodes are so good, so powerful, that you may not even notice the absence of Chester. On the other hand, there were more than enough episodes about Festus and his kinfolk, felt more like Beverly Hillibillies than Gunsmoke at times. This was sure worth waiting for, seeing all these all time great actors again.",1407456000,22,3436,5.095914742451154
6411801,5,B00KB01OG8,"All you angry people out, I'm with you, I love the Gunsmoke series but I'm not paying these prices. Its a complete rip off. I didn't like when they started splitting the seasons in two, so they can double there profits!  Now its worst then that.  There is a solution to this problem, Just wait until the prices come way down. $35.00 a season is more then enough to pay.

6411823,5,B00KB01OG8,"Gunsmoke provides western-lovers with a family-friendly great show that emphasizes character, law & order, and good plain common sense. This half-season, as well as all previous episodes, provide a breath of fresh air in an age when many of the most entertaining movies have drifted from such character-building values.  It is amazing to me that the writers were successful in making the plot and storyline consistently excellent and among the best of the classic Westerns from season to season for so many consecutive seasons.  I cannot think of one episode to date that felt weak or that let me down.

Definitely a great addition for the video library of anyone who likes the Western genre, or who likes solid character and good role models in the primary characters, and a strengthening of the ideas of justice, fair play, the rule of law, and even compassion and wisdom throughout.",1471564800,,885,4.966216216216216

I gave this a 5 star rating but with these seasons were not prices so high.  When they first come out, they are priced at nearly $50 per volume.  I place them in my wish list and finally purchased this volume in the low $20's. I'm currently waiting for season 11 to drop.

Great cast, and great guest stars along with fantastic storylines explains just why Gunsmoke lasted for 20 seasons! Originally cast for the role of US Marshall Matt Dillon, John Wayne thankfully turned it down letting us have the 6'7 James Arness of Minnesota fill the role of Matt Dillon, and now, I couldn't see anyone else play that role. Amanda Blake, Milburn Stone, Ken Curtis and Burt Reynolds do wonderfully in this timeless series-you have to see it!",1517875200,,523,4.695652173913044
