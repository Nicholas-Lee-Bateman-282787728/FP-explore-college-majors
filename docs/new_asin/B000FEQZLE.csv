8121541,5,B000FEQZLE,"if you are fan of late great carlos gavito, as I am. then you will find this disc worthwhile.  it is more of a tango star telling his story and style of tango than an educational disc.  if you are advanced and want to see what a star can do in his own great style than this disc is for you.  I bought and wasn't disappointed.  long beach ca.",1396396800,,341,3.898550724637681
8121542,5,B000FEQZLE,"Please buy this dvd!  Gavito is a legend of tango who's dancing style was born out of the golden age tradition with just enough interesting additives from the late 60's when composers like Pugliese and Piazzola were making the music beautifully layered.  He teaches steps that I have never seen a teacher teach, which means they are usable at a milonga. Most teachers in my opinion teach performance tango and don't teach students how to move beautifully and connected to the music in their own space, with no intention of getting around the circle of dance as quickly as possible. You can languish in each step and if the milonga you are dancing at becomes congested you needn't worry about not moving forward.  You will be able to stay in your own circle and have the most beautiful time.  Not for the flashy minded tango dancer!  His moves are super subtle and the private conversation you will have with your partner in dancing will speak volumes-but only to you two.  If you look at his moves and his performance dancing it may not be thrilling to you(it is to me to the point of weeping and beaming)but when you do those steps he does it is very exciting.  Don't take my word!  Please buy this! Beginner or advanced!  It will change your tango life for the better forever.",1351296000,3,1278,4.5701754385964914

For a superb list of just tango books, about 25 of them, see this Amazon listmania list link:",1288656000,2,353,4.446153846153846
