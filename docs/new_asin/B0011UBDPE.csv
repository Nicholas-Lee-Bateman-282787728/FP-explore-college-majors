8405049,5,B0011UBDPE,l like Jack's approach to scales in all keys in one position. l have some of his other books and the video clears of some the book information. Interesting that he doesn't change his strings until they break. I guess he likes the tone of aged strings get. Great Video !!,1313452800,,270,4.313725490196078
