As far as the movie, I loved it, but I am also a huge fan of the manga and show. It is a great adaption if you haven't read the manga's or watched the tv show. I showed both Death Note's as well as the conclusion (L's story) to my mom who had no knowledge of them before and she loved them.",1377820800,,520,3.9056603773584904
8188211,3,B000P1SBBO,"The Last Note picks up where its predecessor left off. A new Shinigami has stuck down on earth, leaving another mystery. Light Yagami is now joining the crime watch, which he must do if he wants to avert himself from the fact that he IS Kira. Meanwhile the new KIRA is Misa, the chick in the Happy Sweets commercial, who gains the new note after a deadly encounter, challenging Light for everything he's got... and leaving L to have to make the decision of a lifetime.

Let me get this straight: I loved the first movie. Sure it was a tad slow but it was fun- had lots of suspense, good characters, a good cast (including Tatsuya Fujiwara in a frightwig :$) and a killer soundtrack that includes some rockin RHCP music. You gotta love it, plus that scene on the bus was pretty cool. It had no gore in it either, which I loved, and had a good cliffhanger of an ending.

The 2nd one is OK, and... well OK. It's pretty good for 2 1/2 hours if you need something else. Some solid acting and moments of humor are in this film itself. However, other than that, the movie just plain bores me. Yes there's some good stuff to be seen, but really, the writing is poor despite some good funny moments and really, the characterization seems quite forced in comparison to the first movie. I didn't think Misa was neccessary at all to be honest with you, she ruined some of the more dramatic scenes and left a few too many loose ends.

Overall, I say DO watch this film if you're a die-hard fan, but those who are causal watchers, do approach with caution.",1227052800,,1542,4.347222222222222
8188212,3,B000P1SBBO,"Death Note 2:The Last Name definitely lives up to the first and disspells the sequel curse. The sequel cotinues where the film left off. The sequel is so suspenseful that you're just biting your nails to see what will happen. Believe me, the ending will have you speechless if you already have seen the manga or anime series.",1220227200,,325,4.620689655172414
8188213,4,B000P1SBBO,"Far more a continuation than a sequel, ""Death Note: The Last Name"" follows the immensely popular and entertaining&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Note/dp/B0017SVH5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Note</a>.The agile game of cat-and-cat continues between Light (Tatsuya Fujiwara) and L (Ken'ichi Matsuyama).  Tables are turned, fortunes are reversed, and a new Death Note and shinigami comes into play.

The story continues almost exactly where ""Death Note"" left off.  A young and popular idol, Misa, gets herself a Death Note and an accompanying shinigami, Rem.  An devoted fan of ""Killer"", she decides to follow in his footsteps, even though she lacks the genius and finesse of execution.  She is much more of an emotional wild card than Light's calculated style.  L is still in hot pursuit, and he gets to show his stuff a little more in ""The Last Name"", demonstrating why he has the reputation he has.  There are quite a few twists and turns, but the pace is good and the film never gets slow or bound up in it's own mythology.

All of the original cast has returned, including director Shusuke Kaneko.  Matsuyama, as L, is particularly good, and it is no wonder that his performance spawned a spin-off flick ""L:Change the World"".  The new shinigamis each have their own individual look and personality, and are animated well enough that you soon forget they are CG characters.  Light is a little bit too steadfast, because we all know exactly what we would do if we had an admirer like Misa, but I guess that is the price you pay for being a cold, calculating genius/killer.  Still, he is a man of absolute steel, as he shows more than once.

For fans of the comic series, it isn't the literal adaptation they might have been hoping for, but it is still an excellent series in its own right.  ""Death Note"" and ""Death Note: The Last Name"" are both great flicks, and it is almost a shame to see them end.  Live-action animation adaptations are rarely done this good.",1212105600,6,2018,5.036144578313253

You will have to read subtitles.  Don't be fooled by the faulty description. The movie is great.  We saw it in the theater dubbed in English.  We thought we were getting a movie dubbed in English since it said the language was English.",1211587200,7,386,4.617647058823529
8188215,4,B000P1SBBO,"I may be out of the minority here, but I thought this was a well thought out movie in the long run. Of course there are a few cons but I shall talk about them later. (Consider not reading on if you don't want spoilers)

This movie picks up where the first one ended. Light is now with the investigation team trying to track down Kira. L is still suspicious of Light but accepts him in the team regardless. A new death note and shinigami come into the picture, causing a 2nd Kira to appear. Light figures that since this Kira has revealed to him that they have ""the eyes"" he could use the 2nd Kira to his advantage by finding L's real name. But of course, L is not so easy to trick and uses the most drastic measures he can to prove that Light is Kira. The plot thickens and I shall stop there about the story.

The first thing I suggest you do before watching Deathnote or Deathnote The Last Name is to separate this from the manga/anime entirely. You should not dive into this expecting it to be like it at all. It's more of a live interpretation of the series, and for me, I felt a very good one.

The many twists in the first movie kept me coming for more, and eventually I sat down and watched Death Note The Last Name. I was hoping for more twists and a satisfying ending to it all which is exactly what this movie did for me. Both Tatsuya Fujiwara and Ken'ichi Matsuyama did an excellent job portraying Light and L, and the introduction of the new shinigami made it a whole new experience for me. Misa is a character I still have problems with..for both the movie and anime, but Erika Toda did a very interesting portrayal of her. I even felt sorry for her in the end (although...the capturing scene with her was a total fanservice bondage thing going on there...thank god for her wearing clothes. The manga was far worse seeing as she was practically naked)There were more elements to work with too since L and Light were now out in the open for each other and working together.

However there were some issues. I think the problems that are in this movie have to do with the time length and bits of the story. The story at times seemed to be rushed or felt like it wasn't written out thoroughly. Some characters seemed to have a lack of development or maybe too much development at one time. The middle of the movie seems to start to become a prolonged cat and mouse game which makes you feel like, ""God, can someone just catch someone for the sake of my sanity please?"" But I take it with a grain of salt since its only given two movies. Also note that this only ends halfway through the anime so the writers and director were taking huge risks.

Regardless, I love this movie and have given it a four out of five. Don't expect it to be an action movie at all. This is more of a suspense/detective theme and I highly recommend seeing it.",1203120000,6,2846,4.2727272727272725
8188216,3,B000P1SBBO,"Everyone I talked to that saw this movie thought it sucked, but only because it was nothing like the manga. The only complaint that I have about this movie is that it was a little too long (over two hours and only three action scenes.) However, since Near and Mello never appear in this movie, I think this is a briliant rendition of what the story would be like ""if L never dies"" (I never liked Near or Mello anyway). The movie is great if your willing to sit infront of your computer for two hours. Also, If you sit there and wine about how it's nothing like the original story, you won't enjoy it at all. It's not like they change the story for the worse. I thought it was even better than the manga. Everyone has their own opinion, but I suggest this for newer death note fans who want to get into it, not hardcore fans who loved it since the manga was released in America.",1201564800,10,877,4.195266272189349
8188217,2,B000P1SBBO,"The plot thickens a bit in this movie as we now have two Death Gods, and three different people with death notes. Also the battle between the teenage geniuses Light and L continues.

Because of the more complex plot, this is a slight improvement on the first movie, if not in terms of sophistication at least in terms of more plot lines being juggled to help make the story more interesting.

Unfortunately all of the criticisms I made about the first movie remain true here. In fact if anything a lot of those problems increase, making the premise of this second movie look even more ridiculous.

The battle of wits between Light and L is interesting to watch, even if some of their intellectual jumps don't always make sense to me (something that was true from the first movie as well) but at its best points the deductive reasoning of L reminds me a lot of the Sherlock Holmes stories.

Among the new characters in this second movie is Misa (actually Misa appeared briefly in the first movie, but only as a set up to her role in the second one) who also receives a death note from one of the death gods, and joins Light in his campaign.

Anyone at all familiar with Japanese media knows that there is often a problem with the portrayals of women. Rather these problems represent the exception or the rule I'll leave for other to judge, but Misa represents one of the low points. High pitched voice, cutesy gestures, given to either childish pouting or childish bursts of enthusiasm, and when she meets Light she immediately throws herself at his feet (literally) and tells him she wants to be his girlfriend, is completely devoted, and places her life in his hands. From this point on she plays nothing but an obsessively devoted girlfriend.

(Also the scene in which she is captured by the police resembles an S and M bondage a little too much. I know they had to restrain her because of her powers, but in the real world I'm sure they would have found a slightly more dignified way to do it. When Light is detained by the police, the circumstances of his detention are very different.)

In closing: now that I've watched both of these movies, I do have to admit I did find the story kind of interesting. But not nearly enough to justify the 270 minutes required to sit through both movies. If the movies had been a little bit shorter, or combined into one movie, then maybe I could justify recommending them. (In my opinion, there were more than enough parts that could have been cut out to trim this story down into one movie, but I realize the film makers were trying to be faithful to the original manga.) As it is, this movie series represents far more time than its worth.",1180742400,3,2682,4.506172839506172
