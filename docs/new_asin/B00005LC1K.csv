If you liked Wallace and Grommit or Chicken Run, you'll love Robbie.  Like the other reviewers, I feel some of the humor will be above children's level, but they'll get the basic theme of, ""if you have a dream, work hard and you'll succeed.""  I can't wait to own my own copy.  Now my dog won't have to wait for the t.v. version with its many commercials to end before he gets his walk.  Grommit would appreciate that.",1008288000,2,538,4.438775510204081
1621190,5,B00005LC1K,"We saw Robbie on television, and it is our favorite holiday video.  It is very funny,and seems like much longer than a half-hour.  I think my wife has the dialog of the entire show memorized.  The humor targets a an older audience than a traditional holiday show, and it may may be a little adult oriented for the younest of children.  It is a cute story with very British humor.",1005177600,,379,4.371428571428571
1621191,5,B00005LC1K,"In the true Nick Park/Aardman Animation Style, Robbie the Reindeer is brought to life with gusto!  A must see for any claymation fan.  I thoroughly enjoyed this video.  It is funny, charming, witty and there's even a little romance!  A great way to spend half an hour!",1001289600,2,268,4.638297872340425
1621192,5,B00005LC1K,"We taped this from Network TV and family and friends watched it over and over again.  Even so, we are ordering a new copy.",999820800,,122,4.083333333333333
1621193,5,B00005LC1K,"We recorded Robbie on our Tivo last November and never stopped watching it. We have watched it as recently as July! My 3 year old son adores Robbie, and my husband and I can actually sit and watch it with him. We quote from this special ALL the time.
The voice characterization is excellent, and the theme song is really really catchy. I'm buying the DVD so I can delete our copy off the Tivo!",999561600,2,393,4.253333333333333
1621194,5,B00005LC1K,"I saw this movie enroute to Toronto from London on British Airways.  It's quite possibly one of the funniest, and most well done movies. It's a claymation story of Rudolph the Reindeer's son.  It's got everything, girls, machismo, cheating, lying, and more girls...  I've been looking for this movie on R1 DVD for a long time, and I'm relieved that I found it!",990748800,3,360,4.682539682539683
7943700,5,B00005LC1K,The British version is worlds better than the American version. Loved it.,1484784000,,73,5.166666666666667
7943701,5,B00005LC1K,"When I found the BBC version of Robbie the Reindeer I was floored.  I had given up finding anything, but the American version (which is good, but not nearly as great as the BBC version) or European DVD copies that wouldn't work on my American DVD player.  My VHS copy that I recorded almost a decade ago from the TV, which I then burned to a DVD, was starting to have problems so this was a great replacement.  Plus, it includes scenes not shown in the United States!  Bonus!",1483142400,,475,4.303370786516854
7943702,4,B00005LC1K,"I gave it 4 stars because of the clay-animation, which is a 5, the story line is great for 6 and under.",1420588800,,103,3.727272727272727
7943703,5,B00005LC1K,"I was very pleased with the DVD as are my son's. It is interesting that it came with both the British audio version and the American Audio version. The American version is not as good as the British one it misses some of the British humor.
Price was very good and I am pleased with the company I got it from. Shipping was quick and on time.",1393200000,,340,4.08955223880597
7943704,5,B00005LC1K,"Aimed at a grown-up's sense of humor but still enjoyable for a kid, Robbie the Reindeer is hilarious.  The claymation style of animation helps to bring a touch of surrealism into the humor.  Having seen the original British version first, that is the one I love.  The voice cast made it come to life.  I saw the American version (no offense to Ben Stiller and the other actors but they just didn't fit) once and it seemed as though the actors were just reading a script over the film.  There was no emotion, no inflection...well, alright, there was but it was so lame, I couldn't stand it.",1262822400,,589,4.4672897196261685
7943705,2,B00005LC1K,"...for a british film???  I saw this movie a few years ago on TV, and then the following year eagerly anticipated watching it again...only to be terribly disappointed that the ""powers that be"" decided to completely ruin the humor by dubbing those English character voices with American voices...and not even good ones at that!!! Ben Stiller and Brittney Spears??? were they the only actors/media darlings who didn't think it was a bad idea?...the voiceovers leave the movie sadly lacking in character and humor.  Shame on whoever thought that was a good idea (one of the networks), I guess they must think that the general public are not smart enough, or interested enough, to understand the British humor...there are a few inside jokes that mainly British viewers would appreciate, the voice of the Yeti sports commentator is done by a very well known British sports commentator for example.

I'll give it two stars...only because the animation is still there, and very good - but i'll give it a miss this Christmas.",1164844800,9,1017,4.970588235294118
7943706,2,B00005LC1K,I think I am little disappointed perhaps because I expected The Wrong Trousers or A Close Shave class of creation. I bought this with the hope that my 2 year old will like it as much as he likes the two Wallace and Gromit adventures. It is apparent that he is not enjoying it as much. Some good punch lines but lacks the drama and tempo which W & G has to offer. The clay work too is fairly crude compared  to W & G.,1062115200,6,416,3.8941176470588235
7943707,2,B00005LC1K,"I bought this as a fan of ""Wallace and Gromit"" and a fan of animation.  The animation is fine, but if you are expecting a story with the kind of humor and action you get in ""The Wrong Trousers"" or ""A Close Shave"" you too will be disappointed.  If you want a harmless holiday DVD to distract the kids for a while, you'll be happy.  For me, I can't honestly see pulling this out every year (unless the kids ask for it).  For my money, I'd rather watch ""A Christmas Story"" or any of the the old Rudolph/Santa movies from my childhood.",1039564800,11,531,4.176470588235294
7943708,5,B00005LC1K,"Just a quick note to say that this is one of my family's and my own favourite cartoons from the Aardman stable.  The whole story is a joy from start to finish and as a teacher I am for ever quoting lines from it.  Really , you either like this humour or you don't, just remember that it isn't a Bambi style movie.  Whether it be the seal singing a song by seal, the work of Blitzen..'Think Eviler..' or Good ole Jingle..'I'll put the kettle on', it remains great fun from start to finish.  personally I love the polar bear who has his fish taken, played with a great geordie accent..

Enjoy..

7943709,5,B00005LC1K,"Robbie the Reindeer: Hooves of fire is a great special.  It was produced in part for the British Comic relief charity to be shown as part of their telethon although in saying that I hope they make Robbie the Reindeer into a series.  The story is full of puns and humor from Santa trying to update his image to biker elves and backstabbing Reindeer. Every scene is so full of detail you might miss some of the jokes in the background the first time round.  That's why it's a good idea to rewind and watch it over and over again ;0).
Robbie the Reindeer: Hooves of fire doesn't have any inappropriate material but some of the humor used can be pretty subtle at times and is aimed more at an older audience.  In saying that young and old will still love and enjoy it. The story is a great new `classic' for the holidays.
The voice talents of some of the funniest British comedians are used and they provide a good variety of UK accents, which include Irish (Robbie), English Liverpool (Santa) and Welsh (Biker elf). The characters are memorable and lovable. At only 30 minutes in length I was left wanting more...",1008633600,16,1110,4.45320197044335
