8504785,2,B005WF0LA2,Not as expected. When my husband had a stroke & was bedfast 2 years---I attended classes at the hospital on how to care for him.  I now have trouble with balance. Thought this disc was meant to help people with balance problems.  It is just a bunch of exercises to do. Was hoping this would help me to take a possible fall correctly---to help minimize hurting myself---or to help one to NOT fall. Very disappointed,1433894400,,414,4.506666666666667

This is a no-brainer investment for anyone who wants to stay active.

Shana is engaging and easy to follow.  As a wellness professional interested in helping people achieve and maintain mobility, I appreciate that Shana has shared her expertise to produce this video & teach these skills.
