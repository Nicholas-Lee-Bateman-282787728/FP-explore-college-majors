8078279,3,B000AE8KWQ,"Almost half of the ""Our Gang"" disc feature silent episodes.
Wanting to start a collection of Our Gang/Little Rascals, I was not enthused with this purchase.",1233187200,,156,5.038461538461538
8078280,5,B000AE8KWQ,"This is a good quality set of DVD's.

The contents have already been described.  Our Gang is classic comedy that almost everyone has seen. The East Side Kids are lesser known, but the stories had well-defined plots.  As for Lum and Abner, if you try to find the four movies in any other collection, you will spend a lot more money than you will here.

The video images are black and white, but they are in very good shape for Lum and Abner and the East Side Kids. Some of the Our Gang shorts are of poorer quality, especially the older ones, but some of these shorts I have not seen in any other Our Gang collections.

For the price and the quality, you can't go wrong with this set.",1228176000,2,683,4.223076923076923
8078281,5,B000AE8KWQ,"Use to watch the Little Rascals as a kid, and these short features were considered old already, and enjoyed the video package very much. If you ever watched the Rascals growing up I recommend buying ""Troublemakers"" it will bring back many enjoyable memories.",1206662400,,258,5.023255813953488
8078282,4,B000AE8KWQ,"LUM AND ABNER were owners of the Jot 'em Down Store, in the fictional rural town of Pine Ridge, Arkansas. In its heyday, this popular radio show (which aired from 1932 to '54) received 1.5 million pieces of fan mail a week-- more than any other sit-com. L & A were also stars of seven movies in the 1940s, four of which are here.

THE EAST SIDE KIDS began as the Dead End Kids, a name derived from the stage play, ""Dead End."" In 1937, Samuel Goldwyn turned ""Dead End"" into a movie  starring the original Broadway performers. After seven Goldwyn films (and a few at UNIVERSAL as the ""Little Tough Guys""), the Dead Enders moved to MONOGRAM PICTURES under the name EAST SIDE KIDS. The titles in this collection are from those early MONOGRAM days. Later the ensemble would be known as THE BOWERY BOYS. Altogether, this successful series lasted 20 years, ending when the ""boys"" were all approaching middle-age.

OUR GANG had the longest theatrical run of any ""juvenile"" series, spanning the silent era (1922) into the 1950s. As the kids grew up, they were replaced with younger actors. Several Our Gang alumni went on to film careers as teens and adults. The majority of ""Gang"" shorts in this set were directed by Robert McGowan, for HAL ROACH STUDIOS. In 1938, Roach sold the franchise to MGM. The original 80 shorts made prior to this changeover were eventually syndicated to television under the name LITTLE RASCALS.
