8110778,5,B00008UAMI,This DVD is my favorite XPW DVD. I think that it has the best championship and climatic matchups. I like seeing Pogo and Supreme going against their enemies.,1389830400,,157,4.642857142857143
8110779,2,B00008UAMI,"Vic Grimes vs Psychosis- I thought this could be interesting with the 200 pounder vs the 400 pounder. This was an ok match both sides hit some nice moves but both have put on better matches. It was good to see Grimes showing his wrestling skill. Grade C+

Konnan vs Damien Steele- This was an ok match. Konnan put on a good show, waiting to take revenge on his former valet. Steele looked flat and didn't do much to impress this match. Grade C+

Pogo the Clown vs Kaos- It was very impressive watching Kaos picking up Pogo and repeatedly slamming him. The match was really starting to pick up steam when Kaos stole a victory. Grade C

Supreme vs Steve Rizzatano- This is a deathmatch, which XPW said it never aired, and has no commentary. This match is basically a 2 on 1 handicap match. Both men hit some big impressive moves. However this match moves very slowly, and the crowd seems totally dead.  Supreme does a wonderful job absorbing punishment, and then selling his injuries. Grade C+

Webb vs Sandman- This was an ok match at best neither man looked to be having one of there better matches. This was slow moving and non of the high spots we are used to. Grade D

Super Dragon vs Disco Machine- Short but very explosive match. This could have easily have been an A match if they let it go. Both wrestlers used some new moves and really impressed me. Grade B

GQ Money vs Angel vs Preston Ascott- This was a match that should have been shorter. This was a horrible match. G Q money seemed the most prepared and hit one or two nice moves. Angel looked awful missing many spots. Ascott has no business in the ring. Grade F

Overall the other reviews are correct this is really a sub par DVD. Only one match was really memorable and it only lasted 5 minutes. The rest of the DVD is just a waste of time. I was disappointed that the DVD was so short. Also I know XPW has some poor lighting, sound on some DVD's however this one was really bad. This DVD seems to skip in a lot of places, and I tried it on 3 different players. Overall Grade D",1193788800,2,2044,4.27720207253886
8110780,3,B00008UAMI,"Well when I wrote the two reviews that I had written before, for Damage Inc. and Exit Sandman, nobody else had written a review for them. Somebody did write a review for Retribution but I will write a review so that I may practise typing. The first match was between Vic Grimes vs. Psicosis. Vic Grimes had somewhat had the match well in hand before he won the match. The second match was Konnan vs. Damien Steele. Konnan fought real hard to win that match. The third match was Kaos vs. Pogo. It was a close match. The fourth match was Supreme vs. Steve Rizzono with T.J. Rush helping. It was a slow and buffoon match but you have to believe that Supreme is a good wrestler after that match. At first the match is one sided with T.J. Rush helping Steve Rizzono so that both are attacking Supreme. But Supreme gets T.J. Rush out of the way so then its just him facing Steve Rizzono, and he wins. The fifth match is White Trash Johnny Webb vs. Sandman for the XPW World Title Belt. It is a close match. The last two matches are bonus matches. One is Super Dragon vs. Disco Machine. It is a close match with Excaliber helping Super Dragon sometimes in the match and Super Dragon wins. The last match is a three man free for all. Preston Ascott III vs. Angel vs. G.Q. Money. It is a close and furious match with Preston Ascott III with his legs on the ring ropes pinning Angel while G.Q. Money is pausing and looking away.",1125360000,,1418,4.294776119402985
8110781,2,B00008UAMI,"OK I am a big XPW fan and this is a pretty bad video fromthese guys. There's really no great match on this video. And it is wierd that this happened because they put out so great action and this video lacks that. Here's the run down.
'Vicious' Vic Grimes vs. Psichosis. Now how can you put a highflyer like Psichosis up against a 300 pound hardcore wrestler. The match was pretty lame and nothin to shout about.
Konnan vs. Damien Steele [loses Leaves XPW]: this was the second best match on the tape and it wasn't all that great. The winner of this match would get an XPW title shot at the champion at there next show. So some good moves put on by these two!
[King of the Deathmatch Title]: Supreme vs. Steve Rizzono. This was a great match but there was no sound to it, it was lame. There were some good moments in this match but it was not the best. It is the best match on the tape. I can tell you that much.
[XPW TV Title]: Kaos [w/ The Enterprise] vs. Pogo the Clown. This is ok match, the dumbes match on the tape all together but it was a match.
[XPW World Title]: Webb vs. The Sandman. I am a bigg Sandman fan and this match he was a big joke. The worst title defense I think in XPW history. And the ending is so lame I don't even feel like typing it here it is so dumb.
This homevideo was probaby the worst XPW video ever released. If you want to see a great XPW video go see Blown To Hell, Freefall those are XPW titles not this one. Thanx for reading",1058227200,,1461,4.041379310344827
