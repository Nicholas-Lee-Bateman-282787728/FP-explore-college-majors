3413304,5,B00189PSQS,"This film is quotable in the model of The Princess Bride, with one memorable line after another.

Ken and Ray are hit men for a powerful criminal figure, Harry.  Ken (Brendan Gleeson) is a kindly older gentleman while Ray (Colin Farrell) is a brash young man anxious to live all of life this minute.  After a botched hit in London, Harry (Ralph Fiennes) sends the two to the town of Bruges, Belgium.  For Ray, this is the worst spot on earth:

""If I'd grown up on a farm and was retarded, Bruges might impress me, but I didn't, so it doesn't.""

So while Ken tries to get Ray interested in sightseeing, ancient canals, historic cathedrals, and architecture, Ray is more interested in movie being filmed on location which features a midget and a beautiful blond.  The idea of keeping a low profile seems to escape the younger killer and keeping control over his partner is daunting for the aging killer.

This movie masks the underlying tragic story with hilarious comedy and the craftsmanship to give opposing emotions like that is masterful.  All the way through everything bad that can happen does, stacking the tension like a playing card castle.  You'll love Ken from the beginning and grow to love Ray by the end.  And at the ending, right at that final scene you'll realize that the filmmaker, Martin McDonagh wrote and directed a perfect concluding sequence.  If you ask me, it couldn't have ended any other way and been convincing.

I can't write anymore without giving something away.  Go see it, it'll make you happy and sad.

3413305,4,B00189PSQS,"Martin Mc Donagh's ""In Bruges"" proves at least one thing once and for all: Colin Farrell is a thoughtful, emotionally open, soon to do very great things on the screen, actor...something that anyone who has seen ""Tigerland"" and ""Home at the End of the World"" already knows despite evidence to the contrary: ""S.W.A.T,"" ""Alexander,"" ""Miami Vice,"" etc. etc.
'If I'd grown up on a farm, and was retarded, Bruges might impress me. But I didn't, so it doesn't""  says Ray (Farrell) to his fellow hit man, Ken (burly Brendan Gleeson): both sent to Bruges, Belgium to cool off after a bloody hit that unfortunately went woefully wrong.
This is McDonagh's first film as Director/Writer and it is evident that he has a great eye for detail both in the sparkling, smart-*ss dialogue as well as with the stunning visual vocabulary of movies. Bruges is a beautiful city: ancient, redolent of the many lives lived there with its cobblestone streets, masonry buildings and outdoor plazas. As such, staid, old lady of Belgium Bruges stands in vivid contrast to the Irish duo of middle-aged, seen-it-all, supposedly Gay, interested in the sights and history of the city Ken and the emotionally over-wrought, painfully sensitive Ray:  nervous, anxious, wanting to party, sporadically breaking out in sobs...literally an open emotional wound desperate for succor, blatantly remorseful, seeking redemption in all the wrong places.
""In Bruges"" roils over with goofy, silly dialogue (mostly spoken by Farrell who proves very adept at delivering it in droll, wry, ironic style) and profanity, violent bursts of gunfire, and jokes at the expense of dwarfs and Americans. Screenwriter McDonagh steers his odd couple Irishmen through a series of strange/odd situations in which questions of honor, friendship and mortality are mulled. The older Gleeson also proves to be the grounded one: good at what he does (that is kill people) and able, by his very presence to calm Ray down.
Ralph Fiennes is also on hand here and plays Ray and Ken's boss, a mean-spirited bloke who talks in Michael Caine-Cockney cadences and arrives in Bruges to make sure that a hit, assigned to Ken is carried out without fail.
""In Bruges"" shares many of the surface traits of such films as Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" but, though great as ""Pulp Fiction"" is, it doesn't have the heart and soul of Mc Donagh's ""In Bruges"": a film that satisfies the thriller/action genes of us all but also digs very deep below and reveals the true natures of its very conflicted, ultimately very human characters.",1203033600,105,2543,5.023696682464455
3413306,4,B00189PSQS,"Much like a comedian, ""In Bruges"" is a film that uses humor to mask pain. It tells jokes and we laugh at them, but it's by no means a comedy; the story is deadly serious and at times downright shocking, and we're ultimately left in limbo about what we should and shouldn't find funny. This is actually one of the film's greatest strengths, simply because life itself is often hilarious in the face of tragedy. Writer and director Martin McDonagh seemed to know that all too well, which is good because it made for a unique and surprisingly engaging film. But be aware that not everyone will be this receptive: the subject matter is anything but light; most of the characters inhabit that massive gray area between decency and amorality; the ending is appropriate but definitely unconventional, leaving us unsure as to whether or not everyone got what they deserved.

The film opens with two Irish hitmen--Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson)--arriving in Bruges, a Belgian city that's known for being the most preserved medieval village in all of Europe. They were sent there after a job in England went horribly wrong. I won't say what happened, but I will say that Ray is now an emotional wreck, unable to forgive himself for what he has done. Anyway, both men are told to wait in Bruges until further notice. In the meantime, they might as well enjoy a little sightseeing, and indeed, Bruges is a beautiful, picturesque place. While Ken is more than willing to take everything in, Ray behaves like an immature teenager, shooting his mouth off about how awful Bruges is. He even gets into hot water with tourists, especially the American ones--it seems he's still bitter over the Vietnam War and the murder of John Lennon.

But it's much more likely that the past few days have taken their toll on him, with the incident in England weighing heavily on him. His only outlet is beer, cocaine, and Chlo (Clmence Posy), a young woman working with a film crew. They share a fascinating if odd relationship, him being a hitman on the brink of suicide, her being a drug dealer and occasional robber. It's through her that Ray meets Jimmy (Jordan Prentice), a dwarf acting in the film being shot in Bruges. They, too, share an interesting relationship, not only because both are pent up fountains of anger, but also because of how they express that anger. Here's an example for Jimmy: there's a scene in which he's high on cocaine, ranting about how there will eventually be a race war between the blacks and the whites, and he feels that every ethnicity from the Vietnamese to the Pakistanis will side with the blacks. ""What about black midgets and white midgets?"" Ray asks. ""Yes!"" Jimmy emphatically responds. ""Now there's a movie!"" chuckles Ray, who quickly notices how offensive Ken is finding this conversation.

After a few days, Ken in finally contacted by Harry (Ralph Fiennes), who gives specific instructions that I won't reveal. I will say Harry is probably the film's only evil character, despite the fact that he has strict principles about who and who not to kill. He apparently first saw Bruges when he was only seven years old, and he loved it so much that he wanted both Ken and Ray to experience it. Bruges is like a city in a fairy tale, Harry says, and woe to those who don't feel the same way--one gets the sense that, in his eyes, disliking Bruges is akin to disliking the air we breathe. As irrational as this line of thinking is, Ken goes along with everything Harry says and always obeys. But then the next hit is ordered, and at that point, Ken reconsiders the life he leads and why he leads it. This, in turn, forces Harry to come back to Bruges.

All this paves the way for the final sequences, which are cleverly written to say the least. They serve as brutal counterparts to many earlier scenes, many of which have Ray and Ken discussing the existence of heaven, hell, and purgatory. They also wonder what it means to be a truly good person; Ken feels that he's generally a nice guy, yet he's well aware that he has killed people. He also asserts that, with one exception, his victims were all bad people who deserved to be killed. This begs the question: Where is the line drawn, since justified murder is still murder? Ken and Ray grapple with this, knowing perfectly well that their feelings could mean the difference between life and death.

There's a scene that sees both men in the Basilica of the Holy Blood, which displays a fragment of cloth said to have been soaked with the blood of Jesus Christ. Ken wants to see this cloth while Ray is desperate to leave, and that's an interesting duality since both men are sinners and unsure about what the hereafter has in store for them. Ray believes that hell is an eternity in Bruges, which is the only reason why he doesn't want to die there. Ken eventually believes that his purpose is to send Ray off to find his own purpose. Both have a lot to pay for. Whether or not they actually do pay, I'm not sure; much like the film's overall sense of humor, the ending of ""In Bruges"" is ambivalent, leaving us in a thick fog. But at the very least, it's a lovely, almost magical fog, much like the one shrouding Bruges every evening.",1202428800,25,5214,4.602150537634409

3413317,5,B00189PSQS,"Its interesting to see Martin McDonaghs first film with the hindsight of his two other movies. While I missed In Bruges (2008) back when it came out, I have recently enjoyed Seven Psychopaths (2012) and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017). Having now seen all three of McDonaghs films, I see the themes and motifs he uses throughout his directing. I already had hints of these common elements; its just that seeing In Bruges for the first time has cemented them. From using short people to drug use to some uncomfortable violence, McDonagh has a style all his own, and it clearly shows in his breakout film.

I think what draws me to McDonaghs films is his expert use of multiple Chekovs Guns as well as tying all these various foreshadowings together in a satisfying way. Whether its a fat American, spare change, or the untimely death of a child, each part of In Bruges was included for a purpose that becomes evident in some truly genius twists along the way. Some may say that the ambiguity of the endings of his movies is frustrating, but I almost like the open-ended conclusions that seem to say and life goes on.

While I did enjoy In Bruges, it still had some areas where McDonagh eventually improved through his continued filmmaking. Even though they spoke English, half the time, I couldn't understand what was being said by the actors. This almost caused me to turn on closed captions for some semblance of subtitles. Other than that, the dark comedy helped to balance the deeply dramatic plot as it centered around death in its many forms. I was already a fan of McDonaghs films, but In Bruges helps to confirm that the McDonagh trilogy is one of the best pieces of filmmaking to happen in the last decade.

A fantastic first film in the McDonagh trilogy, I give In Bruges 4.5 stars out of 5.",1519084800,,1817,4.636645962732919

3413327,5,B00189PSQS,"One if my favorite films for many reasons. Brendan Gleeson, plays Ken,  and Colin Farrell plays Ray, hitmen sent to Bruges after a particularly horrible shootout. Gleesons character loved Bruges, the culture, the history, the museums, the cablestones, the canals and all of it. Farrell, however hated it, a terrible place, but here they were.

Harry, played by Ralph Fieness,  the leader of the Dublin mob that sends out hitmen, wants Ray dead, his awful hit, was too much even forcHarry. So, here they are, and we see Bruges from Ken and Rays viewpoints. We get to play tourist with Ken and sometimes, Ray. In fact, we all want to visit Bruges after this film. Well, maybe not the outside bar, but you know.

Love this film and the messages it presents.

Unfortunately, I was misled by my appreciation of Colin Farrell's  acting ability in a few good films he's appeared in to think this one might be worth the one cent plus shipping charged for it. Serious mistake on my part! It's going into the trash right now, because there's no redeeming quality in it whatsoever for any reasonably intelligent person. I will make certain this copy of the DVD is destroyed so that nobody else will suffer the misfortune of watching it.

Who knew Fiennes was a comedic actor before Grand Budapest.  I have not one bad thing to say about this film.  It is my favorite movie.

3413481,5,B00189PSQS,"THE MOVIE:
If you're looking to buy it, chances are you've seen it. If you haven't, the tagline ""Shoot first, sightsee later"" is completely inaccurate. It's literally the other way around, being a dark comedy with very little shooting at all, mostly near the end besides a flashback. Ralph Fiennes' character doesn't show up until the last quarter of the film, and most of it takes place at night. Basically, the cover COMPLETELY contradicts the entire film. Don't judge a movie by its cover art.

That being said, it's an artfully-done dark comedy centering on two Irish hitmen who screwed up a job and are hiding in Bruges, Belgium until their boss Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes of Schindler's List and Harry Potter fame) calls. While Ken (Brendan Gleeson; Edge of Tomorrow, Harry Potter) loves the well-preserved medieval village, Ray (Colin Farrell; Miami Vice, Total Recall remake) hates it, until he meets a beautiful girl who isn't quite what she seems and a dwarf actor he continually insults. The plot twists and turns and you'll find yourself laughing hysterically, hating yourself for finding insensitive jokes funny, and crying within the span of a few minutes, while marvelling at the photography.

THE DISC
This review is for the Blu-RAY (See what I did there? Ray? Get it? Like the charac- never mind). I put the film into my Xbox One, which was connected to the internet. It had to download several online features, WITHOUT prompting me, and took several minutes before I could start up the film. A minor annoyance I was willing to put up with to watch my favorite film in high definition. It's almost TOO high. In darker scenes, I could easily see individual silver hallide crystals from the film it was shot on, which happens very often, especially in films shot primarily in the dark. This didn't bother me, and even made the movie a more authentic experience. What DID bother me was the opening shots. As they were slowed down, the film grain became more noticeable, as each frame was up for about three times longer than shots with movement. I can't quite explain this effectively. I don't have a good audio setup, but I definitely didn't notice a BAD difference between my DVD and Blu-ray. If there is one, I'm not qualified enough to review it.

As expected, the film looked great in high-definition, and was well worth re-buying. Unlike Bruges, this disc is NOT a $h! thole.",1440547200,3,2396,4.810679611650485
3413482,5,B00189PSQS,"Collin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson play a couple of hitmen on the lam. They've been sent to Bruges, Belgium after a hit gone bad, supposedly to hide out until things cool down a bit. Gleeson loves Bruges. Farrell?? Not so much, until he meets a beautiful local girl,and makes friends with an American dwarf on location to film a movie. When we learn the real reason behind the holiday in Bruges, things really get interesting. This dark, dark comedy has scenes that are hysterically funny and others that are equally tragic.

3413488,3,B00189PSQS,"3.5 stars. This oddball Irish version of a gangster bromance flick plays like a cross between Quentin Tarantino and Samuel Beckett, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, and often a bit surreal. After a job goes sour, two Irish hit men are sent to hole up in the fairytale city of Bruges to await instructions from their boss. To say much more about the story would get into spoiler territory, but then again the story is pretty sparse. This is a quiet, leisurely gangster flick that's mostly about characters and conversations, and the plot meanders and dawdles a lot, especially in the middle. Casting is crucial to a movie like this, and it's pretty perfect here: Brendan Gleeson is the older, wiser gangster, who also happens to be gay; Colin Farrell with his squirmy eyebrows is the tormented younger gangster; and Ralph Fiennes, sporting a hilarious Cockney accent, is their lethal boss. I wish writer-director McDonagh had given them more of a story to hang their characters on, but it's got quirky charm to burn, and pretty locations to die for.",1437436800,,1047,4.854748603351955

3413499,5,B00189PSQS,"This is probably the smartest dark comedy I've seen in ages--though when I say ""dark,"" I mean VERY dark! It's kind of an allegory about Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory, with themes of murder, racism, and redemption--or a refusal to seek redemption. That's not to say it's an overly cerebral movie, though. There's plenty of action and gallows humor, coupled with some touching scenes of vulnerability. The acting is superb, through and through. Colin Farrell is probably at the best of his career, but in my opinion, Brendan Gleeson steals the show. And the extended metaphors of the Bosch paintings (at least, I think those are Bosch paintings), the way one character is interested in religion and the other isn't, and the way some characters consistently show racist tendencies while one does not, really make this a lot more than your standard, sexy reluctant assassin thriller.

This movie actually had great photography, and Colin Ferrell's acting was actually excellent, and the best I've ever seen him do. I thought he wasn't a great actor until this movie, but this movie changed that. Other than that, there isn't a ton to say: a really solid plot and very clever and funny  dialogue, but the vibe was totally ruined by the over the top and sociopathic violence. Ralph Fiennes was again terrific, but even he couldn't undo the damage from the tasteless violence. As an American, I'm glad that Quentin Tarantino is such a great filmmaker, and that he finally won America some respect on the foreign front, but seriously, people need to stop copying him in terms of his psychotic violence. I always hated that aspect of his films anyways. Mixing comedy with sociopathic violence? I don't get it.

Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell make a perfect pair as hitmen in this crime caper about a hit gone horribly wrong. Ralph Fiennes is splendid as their gangster boss who banishes the guilt-ridden Farrell and his partner Gleeson to Bruges to await further instructions as a solution for the mess is sorted. Gleeson finds the city charming and makes an effort to make the most of the situation by sight seeing whilst Farrell is bored and irritable, until he lays eyes on a girl.

I won't reveal any more of the plot because it is at times tragic, touching, and funny with plenty of twists and turns along the way. Most of the cast has names and faces one won't recognize, but each performance is stellar.

3413572,3,B00189PSQS,"The mood of the beginning of In Bruges perfectly conveys that sense of boredom and pen-tapping that Colin Farrells character Ray is feeling upon arriving in fu**ing Bruges with fellow hitman buddy Ken (Brendan Gleeson).  You almost cant wait to finish the film in much the same way that Ray cant wait to get the call from leader Harry (Ralph Fiennes) to give them their job so they can do it and be on their way.  The filmmakers did a great job of forcing you to feel that Bruges-related weariness.  (Man, Bruge citizens must have been pissed at this movie.)

Anyway, it wasn't long (okay, maybe twenty minutes in or so) before I realized I was actually thoroughly enjoying the film.  While some of the scenes were humorous (like the first fight scene in the film, for example), they often weren't funny enough to make me laugh out loud, save for one or two scenes. I actually found the drama element to be more engaging than the comedic one.

The acting here was pretty spot-on, especially that of the midget  - I mean, dwarf - Jimmy (Jordan Prentice).  He acted his ass off.  And going into the film, I had known that Ray carried with him a strong sense of guilt, though I figured the big reveal would prove that the guilt was over something thats actually pretty hilarious, considering the humor element of the film.  However, I learned much sooner than I thought that my expectations couldn't have been further from the truth.

Its actually pretty sad and understandable why Ray would feel the way he does, both about the first target he is ordered to kill and the accidental aftermath that follows.  I have to agree with Harry on this one - having done what Ray did, I may too have to just put the gun in my mouth and end it all right at that moment.  How do you live with yourself after making a mistake like that?  Hell, how do you live with yourself after killing that kind of target?

And, of course, despite Rays utter hatred for Bruges, a hatred that Harry cant fathom (or, rather, angrily disputes), he just cant seem to put the place behind him, something thats actually pretty laughable later on.

In Bruges is a slow boil, it simmers for a while like an AMC show (Im looking at you, Mad Men and The Walking Dead) before you realize that you're in too deep and you're enjoying yourself for it.  Though, unfortunately, as seems to be the coincidental case with many of the films I have recently watched, In Bruges also ends in a choose-your-own-adventure kind of way with its ambiguity.

In choosing how you think the film will end, you're essentially trying to decide which of two characters you agree with more.  Do you agree that someone should be given a second chance to redeem him or herself, despite screwing up pretty royally?  Or do you feel that the mistake that was made was one that simply cannot be forgiven?

Ten bucks, though, says the hotel owners baby was a boy.  It would make sense, given the circumstances.",1407542400,,2939,4.526515151515151

However, the placement, the European city of Bruges is wonderful and the acting is superb.  Every cast member, from the stars to the walk ons, is wonderful.

3413581,5,B00189PSQS,"This is one of those odd films filled with anti-heroes. The good guys are bad guys. All of them. And yet this dark comedy has you rooting for them all, or at the very least, you find yourself understanding the motives and actions of all sides...even though most or all of those sides are at odds one with the other. Cinematography, setting, music, acting, story lines are all outstanding. Be aware that the opening dialogues and narration are filled with the same profanity over and over, to the point where you are almost ready to turn it off; it just comes off as poor scriptwriting. But don't turn it off! It gets better, and the ""extras"" on the DVD show us that the writers can even laugh at themselves: one of the extras is a long running clip of all of the profanities stitched together. They knew they were being over-the-top! Bottom line, as a dark comedy it delivers: it's a great, fun film - in a very depressing way.",1406160000,,927,4.458823529411765
3413582,4,B00189PSQS,"I'm not sure the Belgian Tourist Board would want to include In Bruges as an introduction to this living medieval city, but, by presenting us with a travelogue of the city, it does serve that purpose.  The story involves two somewhat inept professional assassins waiting in Bruges for their next assignment.  The always excellent Colin Farrell does a superb job as a dim fish out of water.  His partner in crime, the equally talented Brendan Gleeson, possesses a bit more curiosity and intelligence, and strives to make their predicament an education.  The lovely Clemence Poesy provides an entertaining interlude and assignation with Colin Farrell's Ray.  Equally entertaining is Jordan Prentice, a Canadian actor of short stature easily mistook for Game of Thrones fixture Peter Dinklage.  And no, I don't think all dwarves look alike!  The story presents a few unwelcome if not unexpected curves, and a lot of offbeat humor.  All in all, a highly diverting outing.",1405900800,,967,5.114649681528663

Colin Farrell mumbles his way through what could have been brilliant counterpoint to his hit man partner's grumbling in this odd couple style flick.

And the protracted, over-violent, ridiculous ending left me wondering if they got paid by the blood squib because there weren't enough words to go by.

3413613,5,B00189PSQS,"It's hard to like the main characters as the story commences, but you gain some sympathy for them as it progresses. Farrell's character comes off as an immature brat with no impulse control, but as the back story is revealed he becomes somewhat more sympathetic and the reasons for his erratic behavior are revealed.  Brendan Gleason,as Farrell's sidekick and mentor is superb--I'd have given him the best actor award, if a choice had to be made. Ralph Fiennes' role is less prominent than the other two, but he is excellent as an autocratic crime boss. The acting throughout is superb, the plot is unbelievable, in parts, and even the final twist is a bit predictable but it's a good exploration of an issue seldom developed in this kind of film--the effect of guilt on a hit man.",1392940800,2,781,4.700729927007299

3413641,1,B00189PSQS,"""In Bruges"" is an unamusing black comedy about Irish gangster hit men (Colin Farrell,  Brendan Gleeson) hanging out in the picturesque Belgian city of Bruges being rude to the tourists, and becoming involved in terrible events when their boss (Ralph Fiennes) shows up. At least it was advertised as a black comedy - perhaps that was an afterthought.

A very disturbing secret is eventually revealed  (which is not amusing) concerning why the gangsters are in Bruges.  It leads to the boss arriving and the final violent scenes.

The film completely misses the mark as a black comedy because of all the (unnecessary) constant cursing and the disturbing graphic violence near the end. None of the characters end up being very likeable.  Colin Farrell fans in particular probably won't like his rude, ignorant, obnoxious gangster character.  Finally,  the bizarre violent ending just leaves you feeling very bad.

I saw this because some reviewers said it was artful neo-noir (comedy?), but it is actually just a mess.  If you want to enjoy an actual amusing black comedy, I'd recommend instead ""A Fish Called Wanda"" with John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Kevin Kline.",1384041600,6,1166,5.057591623036649

The poignancy of the situation (not mentioned here so viewers could check it out for themselves) and the bits of irony, including the absurdity of a Medieval town (from the period, interestingly, when gangsters came to the fore) and the ambiguity of what it means to enter a world of crime with ""rules.""  Men of right don't break the rules; ethical people, those of reason, know that being such requires knowing when to break them--even where it is at a great price.  There is much to learn from this extraordinary film, which I have now added to my list of recommended films in my course on existentialism.

One more thing.  I came across this film accidentally.  I was up late one night doing laundry and surfed the cable channels while waiting to load the dryer.  I was so engrossed by the film that I hadn't noticed the washer had long stopped.

At the core of this movie is the idea of hit men grappling with doing the right thing and being moral in their actions (if that is possible).  Having recently visited Bruges, my wife and I watched this movie hoping for a light and funny movie that was shot in this lovely town.  What we ended up watching was an engaging but deeply dark. and at times disturbing movie. that is all about murder.  I was not expecting, nor prepared to see images like that of a young boy being shot in the head.

3413671,3,B00189PSQS,"""To be frank, In Bruges works a lot like a Guy Ritchie film with a slower, controlled pace and more international flair or even an artsy 50s film noir that has a significant amount of dark humour.

That, along with the calming cinematography, choice of environment, and inspired writing techniques, all make this film worthwhile as a work that examines how bad/violent deeds can lead one to a confused path for redemption. The best aspect of the film is that it does not consider trying to be something else (neither a morality tale nor a full-on crime caper) but something that is rare and somewhat disquieting these days (especially the very violent and ASBO-like values of its characters).

Farrell and Gleeson give out intriguing and rather humourous purposes that examine their Irish sensibilities rather than Americanise it for the mass public. It also has a calm yet brutal edge that surfaces through its non-dialogue moments and choice of imagery within the quaint Flemish town of Bruges. It is not however a perfect and cerebral film as the film does sometimes suffer from a lagging pace and uneven moments of trying to be funny and then dramatic. At least the polar opposites aren't as problematic and caustic as Dark Shadows film adaptation and especially The Boat that Rocked.

It maybe and may not be the greatest film, it maybe one of the finest edgy flicks and art film pieces that come out from Ireland feeling a lot like an average man's paradise in film entertainment for now!""",1377820800,,1495,4.83203125
3413672,5,B00189PSQS,This movie was really fun. I got it because I watched seven psychopaths and loved it and this one is almost just as good. A must see film!,1376956800,,138,3.9642857142857144
3413673,5,B00189PSQS,"I like to think of this movie as an off-shoot of the Harry Potter franchise. Obviously, you have Fleur (Poesy), Mad-Eye Moody (Gleeson) and Voldemort (Fiennes), but I don't know who would be Potter since Farrell is Irish. I guess he could be like Seamus' older brother (we'll call him Ray, since that's the character's name) or something. Anyway, just think of the movie as a piece of Harry Potter fanfiction where there are guns and hitmen instead of wands and wizards.

Moody and Ray are sent to Bruges by Voldemort after Ray accidentally kills a kid, when he's sent to kill a priest. Voldemort thinks that killing kids is unforgivable, so he's planning on having Moody kill Ray, though Moody and Ray are both in the dark about this particular aspect of the trip. Ray is angsty because he thinks that Bruges sucks. (Apparently, people in this film don't like Belgium for some reason. It's almost mocked as much as BBC shows mock Cardiff and Wales.) Ray is miserable because he's depressed over killing the kid, but he meets Fleur when she's on the set of a movie. He gets her number and they go on a date, where he tells Fleur that he's a killer and she tells him that she's a drug dealer, and they run into the Magister from True Blood. Of course, he's being a jerk because every character that that dude plays is a jerk, so Ray has to punch him the face. He also punches the Magister's girlfriend in the face. (I know that it's shocking that the Magister has a girlfriend. At least he isn't using the mail order bride service anymore like he did in CSI.) Anyway, Ray and Fleur go back to Fleur's place, which really doesn't look anything like how I'd imagined Beauxbatons to look. While Ray and Fleur are making out, Fleur's ex-boyfriend tries to rob Ray and gets blinded by him instead.

While Ray and Fleur are on their date/criminal escapade, Voldemort decides that it's a good time to call Moody. He wants to make sure that Moody sends Ray out of the room, so that he can discuss the hit he's ordering on him. Moody says that Ray is headed to a bowling alley, which gets the noseless one a little flustered because Bruges is the most well-preserved medieval city in Europe, so there aren't going to be any bowling alleys. Voldemort tells Moody that he sent the duo to Bruges to give Ray a happy moment before the death that was going to come at the hands of Moody. Moody is flabbergasted. I was almost expecting him to turn into Barty Crouch Jr., but he went down to a bar to get his polyjuice potion (beer) and get himself together. Ray ends up coming in, as does a dwarf with a Dutch prostitute. Ray and Moody go with the dwarf and the prostitute to a hotel where they consume acid, ecstasy, and cocaine that Ray found at Fleur's place. The dwarf is apparently a racist, which causes a bit of a kerfuffle and Ray and Moody leave.

The next day, Ray decides to off himself, and Moody sets his mind to killing his BFF. Moody ends up not killing Ray AND keeping Ray from committing suicide. He sends him off on a train, and then calls Voldy up to tell him that he didn't off his buddy. Voldy ain't happy and calls his wife, who isn't Bellatrix (I bet she was disappointed), an inanimate object. He tells his kids and his wife that he's skipping Christmas to go kill some people, before Mr. and Mrs. Voldemort both ridicule Bruges and Belgium some more. (Apparently, the wifey knows that her husband is a bad dude. I'm glad he's got an open and honest relationship with someone. People with his kind of background don't trust easily.) Anyway, Ray is on the train when it stops in the middle of nowhere. He's arrested because The Magister and his girlfriend apparently got their panties in a twist and filed charges against him for the brawl. Fleur bails him out and he apologizes for stealing the money and the drugs, but Fleur, being a super awesome person as well as a drug dealer, tells him she doesn't care about the drugs or the money. They go on another date. Meanwhile, Voldy and Moody meet and head up to a bell tower where Voldemort shoots Moody, but doesn't kill him. He starts to help him down when the blind dude comes to them and says that Ray is outside. Voldemort shoots Moody AGAIN before heading down again. Moody goes to the top and jumps off, which grabs Ray's attention and leads to a sort of action sequence where Ray apparently survives, but Voldemort and the racist dwarf die.

It's really a funny movie, though it has a lot of vulgar language. Not the kind of thing I would have expected out of a movie that reminded me so much of HP, but it's still pretty cool. Just keep it away from kids and impressionable folks.",1376870400,,4646,4.436768149882904

3413682,5,B00189PSQS,"Here is a chance to see some premiere acting. Our story takes place in Bruges (Belgium) and features a team of hit men. Obviously, based on a June release, the studio had no hopes for 2008 Oscars, but all three of the lead actors have a chance to shine and all three knock it out of the park. They portray the two hit men and their boss.

Brendan Gleeson in particular (""Cold Mountain,"" ""Breakfast on Pluto,"" and ""Troy"") has a lengthy one-take scene with a telephone no less! It goes on and on, he moves through a wide range of emotions, moving around his hotel room arguing a point and ultimately conceding defeat, all with no cuts, no splicing, no cobbling together of a scene. It is very, very impressive!

Colin Farrell (""Phone Booth,"" ""Minority Report"" and ""The Recruit"") may even live down ""Alexander"" if he keeps delivering work of this caliber! He is the other half of the team of hit men sent to Bruges after a particularly tough job (during which he ""hits"" an uncredited Ciar&aacute;n Hinds). The effects of that job continue to haunt him and he seems more and more like a loose cannon.

Ralph Fiennes (""Quiz Show,"" ""The English Patient"" and ""The Constant Gardener"") is their boss who is completely out of patience with a supposedly professional hit man who suffers qualms after the fact. He is a contradictory blend of cold ruthlessness mixed with unexpected mercy. The concern of two of the men for the stubborn (but very pregnant) hotel proprietress is actually quite believable.

The running gag is that Bruges is such a non-entity spot that no one expects anything important to happen there! It is, in reality, a lovely city, with impressive ancient architecture, canals like Amsterdam and lots of history, but the incredulity of the characters when they respond, ""In Bruges?!"" always got a laugh. One of our guys is basically a tourist at heart, travel brochures in hand, so he comes to appreciate the place more and more, while the other is bored, miserably cold and truculent.

This movie has a clever script written with a deft hand that includes many nice touches of dark humor. Alas, some of the folks in Wednesday's audience thought it was downright hilarious. I will admit that some of the dialogue got past me, so the DVD is much funnier simply because of the captions.

3413729,4,B00189PSQS,"Quite frankly, In Bruges is a well done film. It took me a little while to process it, but it really does leave an impact. I had to rewatch it a couple of times as well, just to fully grasp it and appreciate its subtlety. The acting is phenominal. Colin Farrell was surprisingly great. He has never made me laugh much at all, but he was pretty funny in this film. Brendan Gleeson was phenominal as always. He may just be my favorite actor that isn't a household name. A few years ago, prior to seeing this and then going on to recognizing him in many more films afterwards, I only knew him as that weird professor from The Order of the Phoenix. But he has certainly moved up my list with each subsequent film I see him in. Ralph Fiennes had a fairly short amount of screen time, but he made the most of it. Very menacing, and dare I say ordinary villain. Not to mention, he delivered the film's absolute best line. Without going into detail, it's about inanimate objects.

The performances absolutely make this movie, but there are many other good feats to mention. The script was very well written. It's not exactly a laugh out loud comedy, but there are some tongue in cheek moments that made me pause, smile, then after processing what I had heard, or seen, bust out with laughter. This is dark comedy at its best. It really is funny. That doesn't take away from the dramatic elements at all though. It does get very dramatic. The worst part is that you don't even expect to get hit with an emotional scene directly after a funny one. It's a great combination. I did like it a lot, but it's not something I'd recommend for everyone. I'm not sure if I'd call it polarizing, but it's the definition of ""see it for yourself, and you be the judge."" Obviously, there are better dark comedies out there. This movie actually has a bit of a Coen Brother feel to it, which is always a major compliment, at least to me. In fact, quite a few of their films are the better dark comedies I was referring to.

I had a little trouble getting past some of the music choices. I think the composer and music supervisor could have done better jobs. That said, I got past the music pretty quickly once the characters and story itself sucked me in. I also think there are definitely questionable moments. Therefore, a little suspension of disbelief is required. In other words, you can't be one of those nitpicking people who know how to ruin the experience and immersion. Despite my complaints, the good very much outweighs the bad. There are plenty of redeeming qualities. I think this is still a movie that everyone should see. It's well worth the time, and money (if you have to spend it). I highly recommend In Bruges.",1344816000,3,2705,4.451612903225806
3413730,4,B00189PSQS,"Billed as a black comedy, this story of two stir-crazy Irish hitmen on the lam in Belgium could just as easily fall into any one of a dozen other genres. With traces of humor, suspense, romance, action and drama all stirred into the same bubbling pot, the risk is certainly there for overexertion, but the finished product doesn't fall short in any instance. The comedy is sharply witty and well-timed, the action fast-paced and fiery, the romance heartfelt but not heavy. Colin Farrell, whose eyebrows migrate around his forehead like a pair of pitch black caterpillars on acid, works a good range of emotions out of his fairly simple leading role and cleanly manages to get us rooting for him by the time the closing scenes roll around. Upon reflection, there really isn't all that much to the story - it's predictable at worst, minimal at best - but there doesn't need to be.",1344556800,,878,4.707792207792208

No special effects (though some parts are definitely gore filled) and just a great story. Think along the lines of Pulp Fiction or Snatch.

3413741,4,B00189PSQS,"Writer/director Martin McDonagh takes some time setting the scene and developing his characters, before he reveals that his film In Bruges (2008) is not about an offbeat vacation trip, but is actually a grim crime thriller, with a wicked sense of humor.  Spoilers follow.

Englishmen Ken (Brendan Gleeson) and Ray (Colin Farrell) arrive in Burges, Belgium, check into a hotel, and begin seeing the many sights in the historic city.  A movie is being filmed in the town, and Ray hooks up with Chloe (Clemence Poesy) a production assistant.  While Ray is on a date with Chloe, Ken receives a phone call from his boss Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes) living in England, directing him to kill Ray the following day.

Ken and Ray are hit men.  Ray has just successfully completed his first assignment, the murder of a priest.  Unfortunately since he also accidentally killed a young boy, Waters has decided that Ray must be eliminated.  Ray has been keeping busy, punching out a couple in a restaurant, and when Chloe turns out to be a drug dealer, he shoots her criminal associate Erik (Jeremie Renier) in the eye.  After scoring some drugs in Chloe's place, the night finishes with Ray and Ken, partying with Jimmy (Jordan Prentice) a dwarf actor working on the film.

The following day, Ken reluctantly  secures a gun, but instead of executing Ray, he puts him aboard a train out of town.  Harry is mad enough to kill when Ken tells him what he has done, and comes to Bruges to handle the situation himself.  Things almost conclude without too much damage, but soon shots ring out in the quiet night, and the streets become stained with blood, in this offbeat crime thriller.

An Academy Award winner for his short Six Shooter (2006), Martin McDonagh was also nominated for an Academy Award for his original screenplay for In Bruges.  With well developed characters, most of whom are far from admirable, the film has a certain earthy realism, to go along with a very dark British sense of humor.  In his feature film debut, McDonagh demonstrates a flair for drama, and an eye for detail.  Projectiles are a point of focus, as people die and a man loses an eye.  With Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes leading the way, the acting performances are solid all across the board.

McDonagh features a number of twists that keep the story engaging, but when an innocent child is murdered, the odds are not good that things will turn out well.  Trouble is eminent when Harry arrives, but the violence still comes at a surprisingly odd angle.  Shot on location in Bruges, the film nicely captures some sense of the place, in what is a dark, offbeat, and at times brutal crime thriller with some unique characters.",1329609600,,2698,4.734475374732334

I find this movie similar in style/humor/acting as Snatch and Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, both of which I loved as well. It does not have quite as much action as either of those but I believe the dialogue to be slightly more humorous. Similar to both of those movies there is a lot of cursing (as my title hopefully portrays) so if you are buying for kids keep that in mind.

I would recommend this to someone that also likes the other two movies mentioned above as it is comparable in enjoyment for me.

The language is also VERY foul. Yet for me, it never comes across as forced or being foul just for the sake of it. In a strange way, it fits. Like I said above, it's also very dark - if black comedy doesn't appeal to you, stay away.

The cast is SUPERB. Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes are brilliant, and Colin Farrell is just magnificent. I've always liked him (well, mostly - still trying to forget Alexander, Miami Vice...), but his performance in In Bruges is the best I've ever seen him.

3413751,5,B00189PSQS,"IN BRUGES is a delight of a film and far surpasses any expectations viewers may have.  It is a unique film.  It is not a true comedy, not a true drama and not a true crime caper yet mixes part of all three perfectly to glorious results.  The wit and intelligence in the story and dialogue are an unexpected gift and a rarity in films today.  Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson star as two hit men who are sent to the city of Bruges to stay and await contact from their crime boss Ralph Fiennes.  Also seems that Farrell's character Ray had accidentally shot a young boy in his previous ordered hit and much of the story subtly evolves around all the character's dealings with this act.  All three leads are superb but Colin Farrell is the true star here and shows a deft hand showing his true comedic abilities as he portrays the troubled hit man.  His performance is at times hilarious and sometimes heart wrenching.  He also does the true comedic trick of letting his co-stars also shine while being the true comedic foil.  His multi-dimensional characterization here is a highlight of his career.

And the blu ray transfer of this excellent film truly shows all that blu ray has to offer.  Yes, this is an action film but most of it is dialogue driven and not the type of film one might expect to gain so much from blu ray.  But from the picture to the audio this picture shines.  The video transfer rivals the best out there.  Clarity is excellent.  Facial close-ups and the lovely scenery are totally crisp.  Black/white ratio is excellent and colors pop.  Flesh tones are very realistic.  Be it a day or night scene this film excels.  And the DTS-HD Master 5.1 audio adds the needed punch.  Dialogue is always strong and clear and the film has a lovely musical soundtrack that is always in the background.  Surround speakers are utilized to great effect for this.  And when the action sequences come up all speakers are used superbly for a great experience.  And the flow from dialogue to action is seamless.

3413752,4,B00189PSQS,"I knew nothing about the movie as my wife put it on. It seemed slow at first, but gradually it took me in. It works for me on a few levels.

CINEMATOGRAPHY. The backdrop is the beautiful old city of Bruges, in northern Belgium near Holland. The scenes were designed to make use of the sights, so it could also serve as an intro for someone thinking about visiting. Read somewhere that the movie boosted tourism considerably. They chose times of day for a variety of lighting and color, including a foggy time. I suspect the scene with snow used fake snow, though.

CASTING/ACTING. The characters were unusual. The two leads were very expressive. Colin Farrell can do amazing things with his eyebrows, and express variations on many kinds of angst. Clmence Posy has the most winning smile! Ralph Fiennes plays a most unusual villain.

PLOT. Started slow, took me in as it went. I liked it that the *real* villain did not make an appearance (aside from a phone message and phone call) until late into the movie. It is a gangster movie, but not intended to be realistic: it is mostly a dark comedy, but also has some real feeling in it. A drama, and at times a bit of a thriller. It is not often laugh-out-loud funny, but thinking about it the next day, I found it amusing and interesting. Yes, it has some shooting, blood, and a fall from the tower, all graphic (and fake).

Come on. At the time of this review there were 104, 5 star and 16, 1 star reviews? Do the math.
Basic storyline:
2 Hitmen are instructed to go to ""F-ing Bruges"" Belgium in order to await further instructions after a hit by Colin Farrell goes wrong. In the contract hit, killing a Priest, a bullet passing through the Priest kills a boy and Colin's character is having trouble coming to terms with it. While they await further instructions from thier boss (Ralph Fiennes)in Bruges, the older hitman (Brendan Gleeson) wants to sightsee and Colin is having no part of it. To make matters worse, Colin is slowly becoming suicidal, Harry (The boss) wants him dead but Ken (Gleeson) wants to give Colin a second chance forcing Harry to come to Bruges and settle the score himself.
Add in a little romance story with Colin and a local drug dealer, a dwarf actor (Jordan Prentice) that hates his job (""The're making a movie with midgets!"") who is the butt of a few jokes and a few other interesting supporting characters made me really enjoy this.
Jokes in this movie may have seemed to make fun of specific nationalities or..midgets/dwarfs but you have to be able to see the humor in it or you won't enjoy it.
Americans: They do NOT make fun of Americans for being fat. They try to tell the fat man the tower is narrow and long and he might not want to go up the bell tower. He was trying to help not make fun. Colin's character can be crass but he was right.
Midget/Dwarf: They didn't know him at first in the movie so I felt the comments/observations were the kind you make before you get to know someone. Once they got to know the guy, the laughing at him being in a school boy's outfit was more funny because they were messing with someone they now know better.
People are far too sensative these days and it's just a movie. This is not a fast paced action film. It's a smart, thinking movie with more than 2-3 interesting characters and more going on than shootouts and chases.

3413760,5,B00189PSQS,"Warning: this film may not be for you.  The two leading characters are Irish hit men, and their language would shock those shocked by coarse language.  There are also essentially no ""good guys.""  In addition to murderers, the film is populated by prostitutes and drug dealers.

But since violent and profane films have become prevalent, I think that they are worth your time, like any film, if they are good.  This one is good.

We were invited to a friend's for movie night and the Mrs. didn't care for it.  We didn't know what film had been chosen and I think she felt a little blind-sided.  As the opening credits showed the writer and director was Martin McDonagh, I was a little prepared for the desperately comic violence that followed.  Mr. McDonagh, you see, is the Irish playwright who gave us ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lieutenant-of-Inishmore-Student-Editions/dp/1408111071/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lieutenant of Inishmore (Student Editions)</a>"", a play in which much murder and mayhem follows the death of a cat belonging to a dim, but fearful, Irish terrorist.

Colin Farrell plays Ray and Brendan Gleeson plays Ken.  Ray and Ken have been sent to Bruges to hide out after the botched murder of a priest.  Ken has been a hit man for years and accepts the baggage that comes with the job.  He finds Bruges delightful and at one level the film plays as a magnificent travelogue for the town.  In the film it seems as picturesque as Amsterdam or Venice, but with less tourists.  Ray is a new hit man, and the botched hit was his fault, and his first job.  We can't tell if Ray is jumpy only because of guilt over the bad priest job (as Farrell implies with his acting), or if (as he says) he truly doesn't like Bruges.  Ray didn't know much about Bruges before being sent there, Farrell tells us in an f-bomb-laced opening narration.  He concludes ""It's in Belgium.""

While Ken is delightfully taking in the centuries-old architecture, Ray comes along to brood and complain until they come upon a movie in production.  Ray is entranced by Chloe, played by Clemence Poesy, a woman working at the edges of the film crew, and he doesn't quite know what to make of American dwarf Jimmy, played by Jordan Prentice.  Ray keeps calling Jimmy a midget, and he harbors a grudge against Americans for killing John Lennon.

Ray and Ken work for Harry, who ominously orders them to Bruges in Ray's opening monologue.  We know Harry is a darker, more sinister character than our protagonists before he phones Ken with an assignment that gives the usually agreeable Ken grave reservations.  McDonagh gradually shows us Harry - played by Ralph Fiennes with full profane fury.

McDonagh's screenplay peppers the proceedings with comic dialogue on subjects such as the morality of being an assassin, (""I have to reconcile that with the fact that yes, I have killed people. Not many people. And most of them were not very nice people. Apart from one person.""), diverse views on the pleasures of Bruges (""Ken, I grew up in Dublin. I love Dublin. If I grew up on a farm, and was retarded, Bruges might impress me but I didn't, so it doesn't."") and choice of weapon for assassination (""An Uzi? I'm not from South Central Los Angeles. I didn't come here to shoot twenty black ten year olds in a drive-by. I want a normal gun for a normal person."")

In Bruges is the kind of film where a character can be sent to murder another character and find THAT character about to commit suicide - then finish the scene with the assassin instead sending the other character away on a train.  But it is also the kind of film where deadly violence erupts repeatedly, sometimes with ironic and often with comic overtones.

So - if you're in the market for a black comedy about Irish assassins, ""In Bruges"" fits the bill.",1295740800,2,3849,4.808510638297872
3413761,5,B00189PSQS,"Yes, In Bruges has funny moments, and, yes, In Bruges has dark overtones. But, no, In Bruges is not a dark comedy. To label it so is to sell the film short.  Dark comedies rely too heavily on caricature (and thus distortion) to reach the depth of insight that In Bruges offers. This film mercilessly forces us to confront a basic irony of human life: that people are simultaneously conscientious and cold-blooded. The sole source of humor in the film is simply that ironies, regardless of their contradictory content, can be inexplicably funny on their own. Director and writer Martin McDonagh is modest enough to let the irony speak for itself rather than blow it out of proportion.

The irony frames the dilemmas of the two hit men and their boss. Ken (the veteran hit man and father-figure to his partner Ray) has realized the emptiness and selfishness of his life and strives to connect himself to a higher purpose in two ways. First, he opens himself to the sweep of human history as he finds it in the art and architecture of a quintessentially historic European town. For Ken, Bruges is not a tourist trap but a record of the human hope and suffering that precedes him and carries on through him. Second, he aims to give his partner Ray (the novice hit man) the chance of redemption that he himself has lost.

The irony is brought into full relief at the very moment at the playground when Ken opts against assassinating Ray despite Harry's orders. Instead, he prevents Ray from committing suicide for his guilt for accidently killing a young boy while he brutally murdered a priest.  Some of the film's funniest (i.e. most ironic) lines are delivered when Harry (the boss) summarizes the botched suicide as Ken told it to him: ""Let me get this straight. He [Ray] would have solved his problem, your problem, and my problem, but you stopped him from doing it?"" Ken intervened on the grounds that Ray cannot help any other boy in this world if he were dead.

The irony works on different levels for Ray. Most obviously, he realizes the fallacy of his reckless ways as a result of the boy's death and struggles to find redemption. More compellingly, however, it comes out in banal (and admittedly funny) ways throughout the film. For example, he actually seems sincere when tells Eirik (Chlo's ex-boyfriend) at the most intense moment of their fight that a knife isn't going to help while he himself is holding a gun.  In another example, Ray is viciously rude to the obese American tourist but he still seems genuine when he advises the tourist against climbing the staircase up the bell tower given his weight. Strangely, Ray's flashes of empathy rule out labeling him a savage even if he is clearly a murderer.

For Harry, the irony manifests itself in his strict commitment to principles. As the least merciful of the trio, even Harry confirms that if he ever killed a young boy, accidentally or not, then he would stick the gun in his mouth and blow his own head off. With a mysteriously humorous impact, Harry scoffs at Ken's sympathy for Ray as a sadly suicidal young man: ""I'm suicidal! Everyone is f---ing suicidal! The point is to do it!""

Indeed, Harry sticks to his principles and does it in the end. Why? NOT because he killed a young boy, which was the reason he cited for a justifiable suicide. Harry unpredictably does not commit suicide for any act that he did, but rather for an act that he prevented from happening. That act was Ray's own redemption for killing the young boy. Now that Harry murdered Ray, the latter was no longer capable of improving the life of a living boy as Ken told him he must to atone for his killing of the original boy. We thus learn that redemption for a cold-blooded killing is not achieved by performing the same act on one's self. Lives are not commodities in an equivalency exchange. Rather, redemption is the never-ending effort to improve the welfare of others, an effort that cannot be undertaken in death.

Harry half-way realizes this point when he sees Ray, half-dead, crawling over to Ken, nearly dead also from Harry's gun.  Harry says, ""Oh, so this is what it's all about.""  He does not fully get the point, however, because he puts his gun in his mouth and coldly says ""You got to stick to your principles."" In doing so, Harry must have felt responsible for the boy's killing even though he did not participate in it. The question is why would he feel this way. On some level, he must have realized that by preventing Ray's redemption - in the form of improving another boy's life - he himself was effectively worsening some other boy's life and so must die. However, Ray very much learns that suicide is not a path to redemption. His last consciously spoken words implore Harry NOT ""to do it"" as if to tell him so.  Harry ignores Ray and there was nothing funny about that.",1287964800,,4840,4.621653084982538

Some movies just grab me from moment one and never let up. It's a rare delight, but I watch films for precisely these experiences, and In Bruges delivers the goods in spades. McDonagh's script cracked me up time and again with its dark, harsh humor constantly leavened by weirdly tender moments, and his beautiful direction brings Bruges to life in a very odd yet very wonder-full way.

I love that city and have spent some very fine days wandering its cobbled streets and gazing in awe at endless gingerbread vistas out of the 12th and later centuries, and this film takes full advantage of it all. McDonagh had a flash of genius when he set this twisted little gangster tale there, as the contrast and emotional chiaroscuro of the plot dovetails perfectly with the elegant, ancient perfections of Bruges.

But what makes this all come alive are the flawless performances of Gleeson and especially Farrell, who I think delivers one of the funniest turns I've seen on celluloid in many years. I laughed myself silly at some of his lines here. You definitely have to enjoy Irish humor and be able to decipher the thick brogues, but if you do and can you will be amply rewarded. There are some outrageously fresh bits, and when Fiennes shows up it all shifts into overdrive and can't be stopped.

There is endless ""bad"" language, lots of f's and c's to go around, but that along with the occasional violence somehow seems perfectly apt and never gratuitous. This is both a comedy and a drama but somehow not a dramedy. Perhaps a comma? In any case (dative or what have you), In Bruges worked on every level for me, even the romance. Poesy is perfect with Farrell and their romance is strangely believable, mainly due to her almost slapstick gazes of love. And the deliciously ironic ending has to be seen to be semi-disbelieved.

There was nothing that I didn't like about this film...only that it finally ended.

What is more challenging and potentially devastating is the judgment of other people over the choices or mistakes we made.

Colin Farrell does a great job of playing a likable sort of fellow who might not really be cut out to be a hit man.  The film exhibits a good deal of emotion and the ending is simply great.

3413776,4,B00189PSQS,"Nominated for the Best Original Screenplay in 2009, In Bruges deals with a couple of hit men, Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) who are sent to Bruges, Belgium to hide out. While there, they are told to hide out and take in the scenery of the very traditionally gothic village. Ray prefers the big city, while Ken wants to take in the sights. While there, Ray and Ken get their last assignment from their boss Harry Walters (Ralph Fiennes), an assignment neither of them may want to take on.

Martin McDonagh won the Oscar in 2004 for Best Live Action Short for Six Shooter. In the short film, a man, Donnelly, visits the hospital where his wife is sick only to find out that she died. During the morning hours he leaves on a train, and sits across from a man with a possible screw loose and his crew. Throughout their conversing they realize that they've all had someone close to them die a the night before, and the man and his crew present Donnelly with a gift that they believe could ease his pain. With In Bruges McDonagh made another bid for an Oscar in the Best Original Screenplay race.

In Bruges is a brilliant story. It works on several different levels. On one level you have a man dealing with his past and a terrible thing he's done, something that makes him suicidal and keeps him trying to occupy his mind. On another level it works as something of a buddy comedy for at least the first half of the movie as Ray and Ken differ in their opinions of Bruges and how they should go about their ""vacation"". And then, on yet another level, Bruges is purgatory, and this is the last judgment of our main characters. At first the movie seems like a travelogue of Bruges, but when you delve deeper into the movie you realize that the scenery and the shots work as symbolism to the last level of the movie. That's one of the great strengths of McDonagh's work, he's a master at telling a story that is entertaining and has deeper meaning as well.

The performances in this movie are outstanding. And what else would you expect from Irish and British theater vets Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes. They're battle over the soul of Colin Farrell's character is equally well written, but performed by these two heavyweights it truly feels like a war between God and Satan for a man's soul as he dwells in purgatory looking for redemption. But while their performances are great, the best performance belongs to Colin Farrell. Behind the tabloids, it's often hard to remember that Farrell is a great actor first and foremost. But here, he shows great emotional range from party boy to mourning the biggest mistake of his life, as purgatory takes through all ranges of his emotion from the best to the worst.

I can't honestly find anything wrong with this movie. If you're a big fan of the films across the water that were directed by Matthew Vaughn and Guy Ritchie you may find this boring at times, but at the end of the day this is a great movie. I highly recommend this even to those of you who are fans of the more fast paced in your face action movies. The major thing about this movie to me is that it has depth, as well as action and entertainment.

The telephone call from Henry to George is just hilarious when Henry begins talking romantically about his memories and what a fairy-tale place it is all the while dropping ""F"" bombs every three or words.  THIS is how swearing should be used in screen writing.  In most films, this much swearing is over the top and detracts from the character.

3413784,4,B00189PSQS,"""In Bruges"" was an unexpectedly pleasurable film.  Its title really gives nothing away as to the film's contents.  Bruges, a wonderfully maintained medieval town in Belgium, serves as the backdrop for European gangster genre film with a slowly moving but compelling pace and an exciting denouement.

The essence of the story is that two Irish hired killers are sent to Bruges by their English boss to ""lie low"" after a botched killing in England.  The killing of a priest has also caused the inadvertent death of a child.  To the boss, this is unforgivable.  Indeed, it is revealed that the only reason for sending his underlings to Bruges is that so they can have a pleasant holiday before the bungling killer is, himself, killed.  When this task is also bungled, the boss, played by Ralph Fiennes, comes to Bruges to do the task himself.  No more failures by incompetent staff.

I'll say no more about the plot for fear of giving away too much.  However, there are fine acting performances by Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson as the killers.  There is also a captivating role played by newcomer Clemence Poesy as the love interest to Colin Farrell.  This girl is beautiful and excellent in her role.

""In Bruges"" will probably fail to gain a wider audience as it is deemed to be ""art house"".  So often, this is the kiss of death for a film.  It seems to imply no action and, therefore, no interest.  This is not the case with ""In Bruges"".  Guns and death form part of the story.  However, this is not to suggest that the film is a Hollywood action film.  Far from it.

3413785,5,B00189PSQS,"I first saw this movie late one night/early morning on HBO
and was enthralled in it the entire time!
I love a good independent film which strays off the beaten path,
yet in it's originality, doesn't lose or alienate with it's desire to be different.
A lot of times, indies rely too much on trying to shock and be esoteric that they
loose focus and just run haywire!---Well, this wasn't the case with ""IN BRUGES""!
The one thing you may or may not have a problem with is the very thick irish brogue
that both Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson speak in during this film, but then they
are playing very working class lower level irish hitmen who work for the London syndicate.
Alot of the humour is very british and irish, but still translates well I think.
Gleeson plays a more seasoned, world-weary hitman who has a no miss/no mess reputation
in his dubious line of work. Farrell plays a gruff, hot-headed, quicksilver younger hitman
who does things more off the cuff than Gleeson's more methodical and thorough character does!
This dynamic adds to the friction and alot of the darkly comic moments in this film.
The two are an odd couple of sorts who constantly bicker & banter, but respect each
other as much as two murderous criminals can.
They have an older brother/younger brother relationship.

Well, the two are comissioned to a ""job"" that goes horribly wrong and
starts a chain of unfortunate events that takes place in the unlikely
city of Bruges, Belgium. Bruges is known as a beautiful bohemian type city
in Belgium, which prides itself on being one of the most intact (architecturally)
european cities dating back to the dark ages.
Gleeson and Farrell find themselves reluctantly exiled there after the fouled hit,
awaiting further instructions from their BOSS, ruthlessly and cunningly
played by the great Ralph Fiennes, who gives a darkly chilling yet funny
(in some parts) performance in this ensemble film.
While they wait to hear further instructions, Gleeson and Farrell encounter the
very friendly but quirky townsfolk of Bruges, which add moments
of levity to offset the graphic violence in some places throughout the film.
Anyway, the order comes down from THE BOSS and it's not an easy pill to swallow
for Gleeson, and from there the film takes on a poignant, tragic, yet ultimately
triumphant turn that will have you clapping at the end, I promise.
Even though it will be an ending that you don't expect. (-:
I give this movie 5 stars for it's originality, great writing,
believable acting, dark humour and overall entertainment value!

In Bruges is a hilariously-written and acted movie about two incredibly different Irish hitmen hiding out in a Belgian tourist city that's far far better than the previews indicated; with perfect comic performances by Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, and Ralph Fiennes, this is a very good movie whose ending admittedly wraps things up a tad too neatly but remains very watchable and very good.

I'm not gonna waste a lot of college-seminar training on an exegesis of this flick. I take it to be a spoof of the genre, a totally tongue-in-cheek satire of fashionable amorality. Some reviewers have compared it to Tarantino. Okay, but it reminded me more of the Coen Brothers, though it wasn't quite THAT funny and it didn't have the ripples of mordant social criticism of a Coen flick.

I prefer NOT to recognize actors. When I don't recognize them, I can assume they're acting. The only one I recognized in In Bruges was Ralph Fiennes; I knew I'd seen him before but I couldn't have said when or where. His was the comic villain role and he played it with gruesome delight. Colin Farrell seems to be a household name for other reviewers; I thought he was uproarious -- glum, crass, stupid, Sunday-schoolish -- as the hit man who botched his first hit and missed his merit badge for amorality. Brendan Gleeson was a jolly old elf of a veteran killer with a heart of gold. The city of Bruges played its role of tainted beauty to perfection, an old Medieval tart all gaudied up for tourist johns.

But if you think Fargo was one of the greatest movies of all time, and you aren't afraid of colorful British accents, stop reading reviews and add this movie to your cart right now.

In Bruges succeeds because, like a good Cohen Brothers movie, it has really interesting characters played by excellent actors.  It isn't so much that the plot is brilliantly original as that its development is well paced, unpredictable, and sometimes funnily and sometimes frustratingly coincidental.  The characters propel it forward and their quirks season it along the way.  And the setting, in Bruges, is both a visually enchanting location and excellent plot device.  You may or may not like the ending regardless of how much you like the rest of the movie, but it is consistent with the tone of the film and the actions of the characters.

I saw this movie without having known anything about it, and maybe that's the best way to enjoy it.  I wasn't expecting an action movie about hit-men.  I wasn't expecting a comedy about goofy Irish gangsters.  Without any preconceived notions or expectations, I watched it cold and let the movie tell me what it was about.

Ralph Fiennes as Harry (""He swears a lot, doesn't he?""), adds his own darkness and humor to this excellent movie. The ""Nooks and Crannies"" or ""Alcoves"" dialogue with Ken and Yuri was particularly funny. As was Ray and Harry's conversational ""shootout"" scene at Marie's hotel.

There were also a few very sad and touching scenes of Ray; flashing back to his accidentally killing an innocent young boy in the church during his assassination of a priest. And the subsequent attempt to take his own life in the park as Ken stops him. Colin Farrell gives a convincing performance as he conveys to Ken, the need to end his life. Kenny in turn, trying to talk Ray out of it, by emphasizing it would serve no purpose and wouldn't bring back the life of the child he took. A real tear-jerker.

Thekla Reuten as Marie, is absolutely gorgeous. As is Clemence Poesy as Chloe, the only thing in Bruges that peaked Ray's interest and kept his mind off the boredom (and the dead boy). Jimmy (Jordan Prentice) the ""racist midget"" actor, was equally adept to bringing forth his own brand of humor and ""off-color"" points of view.

3413805,5,B00189PSQS,"In Bruges (Martin McDonagh, 2008)

There comes a point in certain movies where you start to understand how all the seemingly disparate pieces of plot, character, and setting come together. In general, when you're dealing with a mystery/thriller, the best time for this to happen is as close to the final frame as possible. Think, for example, of the shock of revelation in the final two minutes of the best modern example, The Usual Suspects. The master of this sort of thing when it comes to stage productions is Martin McDonagh, whose The Pillowman may be the single finest play of the past thirty years. The interesting thing to note here is that when you're dealing with a mystery/thriller in formats other than the screen, the genre's best works often put that moment of revelation much earlier, as is the case in The Pillowman (or, in the world of the novel, Graham Greene's The End of the Affair). McDonagh, however, knows the difference between stage and screen. Which is kind of rare in and of itself.

In Bruges is a story about two hit men, Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson), who are instructed by their boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes), to take a couple of weeks off and go see the sights in Bruges, a medieval Belgian town. Young, impetuous Ray can't stand the place from the moment he steps off the train; older, easier-going Ken is enchanted by the architecture (though not so much the tourists), but in the back of his head, he's wondering why the boss sent them here, of all places; talking it over in the pub, the two come to the conclusion there's a job to be done here, and the boss just hasn't told them what it is yet.

That's about all I can tell you about the plot, for in true McDonagh style, mini-revelations start popping up pretty early on. You don't really need to focus on the plot, though, to have a lot of fun with this film, which despite being a pretty straight thriller is laced with all kinds of dark, absurd comedy. In fact, it sets itself up to be a character study of Ray, and so we expect in the back of our heads that, as with most character studies of this type, the plot is going to take a back seat to quirky characters anyway. (And this is one of those times when I catch another facet of the brilliance of a movie when I'm sitting here writing the review instead of while I was watching the flick.) That never really happens; the character-sketch aspects of this movie are very well-balanced with the plot aspects. We in the western film world are well-used to seeing basically plotless character sketches or plot-heavy films with cardboard cutouts in place of actual characters. Even when you do get a plot-heavy script that's got three-dimensional characters in it, it's still a plot-heavy script. McDonagh strikes a very fine balance here, and while his foot does slip occasionally, most of the time when you think this has devolved into a character sketch, you're wrong. McDonagh just hasn't thrown the right pieces at you yet for it to all make sense. (And despite what it may sound like, I'm certainly not saying these scenes can't simply be enjoyed for what they are; the drug-fueled party Farrell and Gleeson have with Jordan Prentice would be hysterical as its own separate short film, with no other context.)

In Bruges ended up on a lot of ten-best-of-2008 lists, and rightly so. Definitely worth looking into, and the sooner the better. **** ",1242172800,9,3407,4.624793388429752

Yes, if graphic images of violence turn you off, then don't see it, but they are not gratuitous, in my opinion.  It is dark comedy,  not comedy.  The images help show us what drive the characters to their actions.  I love the movie from beginning to end.  I didn't find fault with any scenes or pacing.

I think the only reason some liked it is that Americans are the usual target of abuse which is the only thing that consistently pleases film critics. Europeans can be homophobic, bigoted, sexist, etc. but as long as they bash Americans in the process as well it is a ""progressive"" film and critics will automatically approve.

It portrays hit men as having their own standards (rigid standards even!) and tries to show that even though they are human in lots of ways, they are less the norm in others.  You grow to like the characters immensely and hold out hope for their redemption.  Nobody ever said life was meant to be fair and this movie drives that point home.  Look for the scenes with the American tourists and the height-challenged actor.  Those scenes really are charming and funny and probably more true than not!  The sad ending is somehow fitting, although it goes against what one hoped for.  I had never seen Colin Farrell in any movie and he is excellent here - quite a surprise to me.  I finally got over the fact that the other lead actor was Mad Eye Moody in the Harry Potter movie; he was an excellent choice for this role.

They meet some interesting characters and then the phone call comes from the boss - and it's bad news for one of them.

I'd heard a lot about how wonderful this movie was and, to my surprise, it completely lives up to the hype.

They are an appealing odd couple with contrasting personalities and a deep bond between them.  Ralph Fiennes plays a loving family man who happens to be the killers' boss.  He's very good with a Michael Caine-ish cockney accent.  The underlying decency of the killers makes them sympathetic and even somewhat noble, despite their chosen work.

With its remarkable medieval architecture and serene atmosphere, Bruges is a spectacular location.  This is a movie with beauty and ugliness, humor and suspense, and most important, a truly great script; what a winning combination.  Highly recommended.",1238457600,,1852,6.42741935483871

Farrell's lost boy/man portrayal is especially wonderful although it's nice also to see Fiennes break out of type and be evil.  As the title implies Bruges is a presence all it's own however this is mainly an interior movie.  We see the behind doors Bruges for the most part.  The characters smack against each other in confined spaces.  There is great violence yet it is done quietly and comes suddenly and completely, almost but not quite unexpectedly.  All the characters work hard at seeming in charge, decisive but Gleeson's Ken is the only one who truly creates his reality within the framework of his past choices.  Too bad those choices have been less than moral.  He knows who and what he is though and has his own moral code unlike Ray and the mob boss.  Unfortunately Ray and the boss are already barreling forward to their dome and not even Gleeson's character can stop them.  There is something very painterly about the exterior shots, especially the one's seen from the interior of a building, a train, a gazebo, a park bench, but if there's beauty there it's haunting and sad, presaging loss, tragedy.",1238457600,,1382,4.669421487603306
3413816,5,B00189PSQS,"There is never a dull moment in this fast-paced dark 2008 film that was nominated for an academy award for best screenplay.

After two Irish hitmen mess up a job in England, their boss sends them to the town of Bruges, Belgium.  They don't understand why they are sent there but have to listen to the boss's orders.

One of the men, Colin Farrell, would much rather be in Dublin and complains the whole time.  He's the younger of the two and immediately finds an attractive woman to hang out with.  The older man, Brenden Gleeson, takes it all in stride and follows the boss's order which is to enjoy the town itself and do some sightseeing.  There is conflict between the two from the start but it is easy to tell there is also a deep friendship and understanding.

The boss, who we only meet through his voice until the last part of the film, is played by Ralph Fiennes.  It's a great role and he plays it with over-the-top colorful language and a sense of viciousness as well as a sense of honor and playfulness.  How this all comes together is testimony to the skill of the screenwriter.

It doesn't take too long for things to get out of hand.  There is non-stop action, violence and pathos.  And, believe it or not there is quite a bit of comedy.  I was at the edge of my set the whole time waiting for what would happen next.  I was horrified by some of the violence.  I laughed out loud at the funny parts.  And, mostly, I was made aware of the very imperfect human beings these characters were and how there were many sides to each of their personalities.

3413817,5,B00189PSQS,"Anyone making a movie featuring two philosophical hitmen is practically begging to be accused of ripping off Pulp Fiction, but it turns out the similarities between In Bruges and Quentin Tarantino's most famous work pretty much end there.  Where the work of the likes of Tarantino or Guy Ritchie (not to mention the recent Frank Miller adaptations) tends to emphasize style over substance (not always a bad thing, of course), In Bruges inverts the usual formula by using style to enhance substance.  It's got all the clever dialogue and unflinching violence you'd expect from a postmodern gangster film, but it's accompanied by a level of emotional depth and a view of friendship that wouldn't be out of place in a Wes Anderson movie.  Few films in recent memory (Shaun of the Dead being one recent example) have played this effectively with tone, as the movie effortlessly incorporates action, comedy, and drama, with some heavy philosophizing thrown in for good measure.  It's funny without pandering, dramatic without any histrionics, and sentimental without getting sappy.  The understated direction of writer-director Martin McDonagh suits the unusually quaint setting well, and his twist-laden plot ends up incorporating the aforementioned hitmen, a family of grossly overweight American tourists, a belligerent Canadian couple, a smoking-hot drug dealer and her skinhead ex-boyfriend/partner in crime, and a degenerate, possibly racist American dwarf actor.  There's also some nice dwarf-related humor, which is always good to see.

Oddly, for a movie this distinctive, the plot initially doesn't seem like much of a departure from Gangster Movie Central: after a hit gone wrong (the details of which emerge pretty early in the film) British hitmen Ray and Ken (Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson) are sent to the medieval Belgian town of Bruges for a cooling-off period by their psychotic boss Harry.  The setting initially provides a source for some nice fish-out-of-water comedy (as well as a few not-so-subtle digs at Western tourists), but it's not long before the movie takes a turn into a more meditative, violent (though still frequently funny) direction.  McDonagh's offbeat approach is best exemplified by a simple conversation scene between Ray and Ken around the midway point, which segues smoothly from an earnest meditation on belief and morality to a hilarious speculation on why a middle-aged lollypop man would know Karate, with Farrell and Gleason maintaining their straight faces all the way through.  Some other scenes start to border on the surreal (particularly a coke binge with the dwarf and a few prostitutes), but the movie still manages to maintain its intelligence and solid characterizations througout.  I didn't think I'd ever catch myself writing this, but Colin Farrell turns in a brilliant, multilayered performance as the potentially suicidal Ray, whose jokey, sardonic exterior barely manages to conceal the guilt raging beneath.  The ever-reliable Brendan Gleeson is similiarly excellent as Ken, who initially appears to be little more than an older-and-wiser straight-man type but eventually emerges as a strong, loyal character in his own right.  In the other principal role, Ralph Fiennes really seems to be enjoying himself as Harry, the outrageously profane and menacing(though strangely principled) gang leader.

Overall, I can't find much about In Bruges to complain about.  It's well-paced and sharply-written, it's got great central performances and some nice violent set pieces towards the end, and it all wraps up without overstaying its welcome.  I haven't seen many movies recently that rank high on the rewatchability scale, but this one's going to end up getting several repeat viewings.

His character maintains a strange innocence so that even when doing terrible things, the audience can continue to find him sympathetic.

This is the second import blu-ray I got (the first was a Japanese import of Ronin, another great movie), and the first one (Ronin) was at least better in the fact that it had the option of having no subtitles.

Colin Farrell and his buddy, Bendan Gleeson, are hitmen, sent to Bruges after Farrell accidentally kills a little boy while doing a hit.  His boss, Ralph Fiennes, plays an out of character role in this movie; boss of the hitmen who wants to kill Farrell for shooting the child.

Ironically, Farrell feels so badly about killing a child that he wants to take his own life.  He has lost the will to live.  Fiennes has sent him to Bruges so that he can see a beautiful place before he dies but Farrell hates Bruges.  In Farrell's words:  ""A great day this has turned out to be.  I'm suicidal, me gun gets nicked, and we're still in f....k'n Bruges.

Colin plays his part to perfection: a naive, unsophisticated hitman with a good heart.  The other actors are also top notch.

3413826,4,B00189PSQS,"If you enjoy suspense thrillers with odd twists and unique characters I heartily recommend this movie.  Colin Farrell is an actor with great screen presence and a gift for comedy as well as drama. Comic scenes not to miss are Farrell's separate confrontations with a couple at dinner, a jealously inept neo-nazi boyfriend of a girl Farrell is romancing, and an American dwarf during a cocaine-fueled party.  All are terrifically funny scenes.

Farrell plays Ray, the younger of two contract killers.  His partner is Ken the more experienced and worldly of the duo (Brendan Gleeson).  The mastermind of the killing is Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes).  The target of the killing is a Catholic priest (reason unknown) in London.  Ray is the trigger-puller and blithely kills the priest as would any good psychopath.

However, something related to the killing goes terribly amiss (a spoiler if revealed) and Harry sends Ken and Ray to Bruges in Belgium, ostensibly to hide out for two weeks until things in London cool down.  The only problem is that this is Ray's first contract kill and he has a non-psychotic conscience that haunts him over his mistake.

Ken, the older man, is taken with the  medieval architecture and history of the city.  To the younger Ray it is just miserably cold and old.  The city itself is a source of much of the humor of the movie.  Ray's mistake is a source of pathos.

Ken has the look and feel of the old professional babysitting the younger, high-strung Ray who wants out of Bruges and back into the action.  Little does Ray know that the rest of the action will revolve around the mistake he made during the killing of the priest.

Harry is played by Fiennes in a very similar vein as Ben Kingsley's character in Sexy Beast. He is an over-the-top character with a weird sense of ethics and a pathological logic that is impossible for Ken or Ray to understand but great fun for the viewer to hear. His reason for sending them to Bruges to hide out puts a fine point on his psychotic ramblings.

When Harry orders Ken to kill Ray due to Ray's mistake during the murder of the priest the action really takes off and contains the kind of twists, turns and final ending that is truly entertaining, with Harry lethally adhering to his own perverse code of ethics. The tragedy that sends the action to Bruges is sad and pathetic but that is normally the basis of black humor, and this is very good black humor.",1235088000,,2432,4.642523364485982

One of the outstanding movies of 2008, ""In Bruges"" is that rare cinematic high wire act that manages to juggle any number of seemingly contradictory moods and tones simultaneously without ever once dropping the ball.  Alternating between the absurdly funny and the deadly serious, the movie, written and directed by Martin McDonagh, offers a wise, witty and surprisingly touching take on friendship, guilt, redemption and the strange code of ethics that guides the behavior of the professional killer (those who appear in the movies at least).

Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleason are superb as Ray and Ken, two British hit men who are sent to Bruges, Belgium to hide out after Ray accidentally kills a young boy in an assassination gone wrong.  Stuck in this strange Medieval city, the two men make the best of a bad situation, Ken by taking in the sights and immersing himself in the rich history and culture of the place,  Ray by moaning about how bored and homesick he is, all the while trying to work through the guilt of having the blood of an innocent child on his hands.

In a screenplay crackling with irony and wit, McDonagh paints the portrait of an unusual friendship between two men who seemingly have little in common beyond their chosen profession and a mutual respect for one another. Ken is mature, well educated, even-tempered and pragmatic, while Ray is unbright, hot-headed, and easily provoked by the words and actions of others.  Yet, somewhere beneath his rough-and-tumble, sometimes rather befuddled exterior beats a giving heart and an appreciation for the good that can be found in certain people.  Gleason and Farrell give performances of immense sophistication and depth, with Farrell, in particular, creating a fully rounded portrait of a ""loveable"" killer.  His body compressed down into a perpetual slump while a host of conflicting emotions flutter across his expressive face, Farrell demonstrates that he has the physicality an actor needs to make a character come to life on screen.  In a much smaller role, Ralph Fiennes also makes his mark as the mob boss who has some strange notions about what constitutes morality and honor when it comes to killing.

Add to all these various virtues lyrical direction by McDonagh, beautiful cinematography by Eigil Bryld, some colorful minor characters, and architecture guaranteed to knock the viewer's eye out - and you have one of the true movie going pleasures of recent years.",1234742400,,2461,5.036945812807882

3413832,5,B00189PSQS,"I liked ""In Bruges"" a lot, though I question it's Golden Globe status as a comedy. I can't argue Mr. Farrell's win as Best Actor. It's a buddy movie, and I was remotely reminded of ""Pulp Fiction"", where the language was second nature. Certainly, there's a lot of mindless profanity, but a clever DVD extra shows just how silly it all is. The camaraderie between Farrell and Brendan Gleeson is well established; the ARE an odd couple, but there's a fondness that develops that is special. This is largely the achievement of writer-director Martin McDonagh, keeping creepiness, sad memories, and an unusual sense of humor that prevails throughout. Then there's the later appearance of Ralph Fiennes, the most clueless of mean persons. Without blabbing anything away, they all create an enigmatic trio. I enjoyed Jordan Prentice a lot, a confident actor with some delightfully bitter dialogue; I recall that Peter Dinklage (The Station Agent) was as bitter and suspicious.  Certainly, the little people have been given few chances to shine. He was a real character, and delightful. The only Oscar nomination is for Screenplay, and if you can see beyond the profanity, it's insightful, clever and touching. Indeed, Colin Farrell's best performance. I enjoyed it a lot. And Bruges is, indeed, a character unto itself. Stunning photography as required; another fine DVD extra is a boat trip through the canals. Quite instructive.",1234224000,2,1423,5.133620689655173
3413833,4,B00189PSQS,"Featuring a crackling script and excellent acting from some unexpected sources (Colin Farrell and Ralph Fiennes, in particular), ""In Bruges"" is one of the best black comedies I've ever seen and one of my favorite films of 2008.  Farrell plays a young Irish hitman Ray who has botched his first job in London, and is subsequently exiled to Bruges, Belgium with his mentor Ken (Brendan Gleeson) while the heat dies down in London.  Everyone's down about the problem in London - rookie Ray is heartsick over the unnecessary loss of life; veteran Ken is sanguine, but still thinks about how being a hitman will affect his prospects for heaven; Cockney boss Harry (Fiennes) views the whole situation as a matter of honor, at least according to his code.

Profanity (more than one ""f"" word or derivative per minute) and violence abound (particularly in the second half), as does beautiful scenery from the ""f-ing"" fairy tale city of Bruges, the best-preseved medieval city in Belgium.  But what makes ""In Bruges"" such a fun film is the script, dialogue and performances - great comic timing by Farrell, world-weariness by Gleeson, startling emotion by the usually drab Fiennes.  His first live scene (after several by mail or phone) is a stunner.  I yelled ""yeah, Ralph!"".

A beautiful drug dealer, an American dwarf actor, a cowardly skinhead, an officious tickettaker at a Bruges landmark, a testy Canadian whom Ray punches out in a case of mistaken identity, and a pregnant, courageous and observant hotelkeeper (""you guys are crazy!"") make up a delightful supporting cast.

Some viewers will recoil from the realistic violence; others from the pervasive language, but those who dial down their sensibilities a bit will be treated with a hilarious, if twisted, black comedy.",1234051200,,1771,5.041095890410959

Ray hates Bruges, but one day in a medieval church his conscience awakes and he asks Ken, ""do you believe all that stuff about guilt, sin, and the last judgment?"" That's a good question because the rest of this character study, full of black comedy and adsurdist-surreal elements (dwarfs, obese people, racism), has to do with both men seeking redemption.

The only reasons I can't fully recommend the film are the amazing amount of foul language in the film, the squirting / splashing blood, and the use of drugs in a comical way. I don't mind language, blood or even drugs in a film but I think they need to push the story forward. In this case, it detracted from the story.

REVIEW
Although violent in parts, this is an offbeat, humorous and touching film about male camaraderie. There's a certain inescapable philosophy that holds the viewer's interest. The dialogue is especially well crafted, and the chemistry between the three leads, Brendan Gleeson, Colin Farrell and Ralph Fiennes, is palpable. The various twists are a little contrived, but do not detract too much from the overall quality of the film.

`In Bruges' is one of the better films of 2008. It's a film that stays with you. It would make a good purchase on DVD, even for those who've already caught it at the cinema.

3413839,3,B00189PSQS,"This is one of the funniest and best movies i've seen in a long time. The humor is very dry and/or completely inappropriate, which is just what I like. I also thought that the acting ensemble were top notch especially Farrell who hasn't been this good since his debut in Tigerland.  I also really liked the story especially the love story, the friendship between the two main characters, and what the movie had to say about principles, guilt, and redemption. It was a very tight and solid script with great dialogue. Ans the directing was top notch as well. very solid performances and pacing. Finally, the setting of Bruges itself is beautiful and radiates this sense of comfort and fantasy, like a dream.

will def buy this, but i can't  believe that it's marked down to 37.00..this seems high even for blu ray. are blu rays usually this high when movies first come out? will it go down to 25 eventually? i thought new releases were usually lower first week. i guess it is down from 50 but thats absurd. it doesn't even look like it has any special features, why is is so expensive? low supply maybe? high demand? both? angry!",1233014400,2,1128,4.574257425742574

He has such a gift for the telling of tales, and like Lieutenant, nothing in this movie is as it seems.  The dialogue is simply wonderful - both lyrical and vulgar at the same time.  Many other reviewers have gone into great detail about the film so I won't repeat those details here ... just go out, rent the film and buckle up for a trip through Bruges that is unlike anything you'd find in any tourist brochure ever published.

The story of two oddly paired guys who are forced into hiding features the city of Bruges to great effect as a background.

Without giving too much away, they are pursued there by a venomous underworld character masterfully played by Ralph Fiennes. The dialogue is witty in a ""pulp Fiction"" sort of way, the action scenes are gripping and the setting is magnificent. Pretty solid entertainment.",1232755200,,727,5.016528925619835
3413842,4,B00189PSQS,"I thought I had this movie figured out before I saw it.  In Bruges appeared to be a hyperactive, hip, cool and ironic crime flick with lots of style but little substance.  Imagine my suprise when I discovered a funny, sad and powerful film about two hitmen laying low in Belgium after a botched hit and wrestling with their demons at the same time.  Sound too heavy?  It's not.

Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleesan star as the two hitmen stuck in the glum city of Bruges awaitng orders from their boss (Ralph Feinnes).  Gleesan wants to lay low and wait for their boss to call, but Farrell prefers to go out and take in the night life (what little there is) and his trips bring him into contact with midgets, obese tourists and a girl who tries to scam him out of his money but who he eventually falls for.  All of this provides for deeply hilarious and sometimes darkly comic moments that make this one of the funniest films of the year.

But there is more going on here than just laughs.  Farrell is haunted by the accidental murder of a child during his first hit.  As much as he tries to hide from what he did by drinking and doing drugs, the truth always catches up with him.  Farrell does a teriffic job of capturing the guilt that is eating away at his character's soul.

The film flips back and fort between the comedy of the two mens' misadventures in Bruges, and the drama of their attempts to atone for their sins.  Neither facet of the film feels forced or contrived.  It all meshes together nicely.  And when Ralph Feinnes shows up in the film's final act, he just adds to the hilarity and moral complexity with his underrated performance.

In Bruges doesn't end on a feel good high, but it is a movie that instills you with a sense of hope that people can change and become better than what their circumstances have forced them to be. Most movies of this type don't even try to say something that meaningful. That puts In Bruges in a class by itself.",1232064000,2,1962,4.378453038674033

3413847,4,B00189PSQS,"Really interesting premise/set-up: You get a gorgeous travelogue on the truly picturesque European city of Bruges, which is the backdrop of a violent, profane gangster tale.  To further add to the theme of contrast, the film's most sensitive, likable character (played by Colin Farrell) has committed the most horrendous act in the film, and the most profane, brusque, and dangerous character- played by Ralph Fiennes in a third-act tour de force- actually has the most sensible outlook of everybody, as he attempts to undertake a type of justice for the Farrell character's undeniably appalling action. Brendon Gleeson is the most middle-of-the-road character here (a kind of stand-in for the audience, except that he's a hit man), and he attempts to work things out between everybody.

Romance and edgy humor round out the mix, with everything bubbling along nicely and contributing to a film that's compelling and moving from beginning to end.  Just don't expect an it-all-works-out-for-everybody, hearts-and-flowers ending.  Of course, if you look at things in a kind of universal justice sort of way, maybe everything does work out the way it needed to.

The DVD of ""In Bruges"" includes about an hour of extras, which give further details on both the travelogue and gritty crime aspects of the film.  Final thought: Colin Farrell is really good here, jumping between subtle, nuanced moments and comic rants about how ""anyone could EVER want to visit the boring city of Bruges"".  I liked him in Woody Allen's dark drama ""Cassandra's Dream"" and liked him even more here.  Party animal or not, this guy's the real deal.",1229472000,,1621,5.113636363636363

3413849,5,B00189PSQS,"It's a really tough task to make a movie that can be both hysterically funny and tragically sad at the same time.  Don't do it right and you can have yourself a movie that feels uneven and awkward.  That is not the case with ""In Bruges,"" which has to be my favorite film of 2008.  This is a film where the characters and even the location are the real stars.

Ken and Ray are hit men who have to hide out in Bruges when a hit goes wrong and Ray ends up accidently killing a kid.  Their boss, Harry, is none too happy with the end results and orders the two to hide out while he figures out what needs to be done.  Laying low is not exactly the easiest thing for these two, seeing that Ken is completely taken away by Bruges and must sightsee.  Ray, on the other hand, can't stand the bloody place and just about offends everybody who crosses paths with him--and let's not forget he has the most abnormal fascination with midgets.  Ray also is feeling a lot of guilt and sadness over the poor little boy he accidently killed and has no idea if he can ever make things right again.  All of this equals one vacation that they, nor you, will never forget.

I cannot express how much I love this movie.  It is weird to encounter a movie that has both equal elements of comedy and tragedy.  Because of this, you must sit and watch it all the way through before you can come to a concrete conclusion about the film, and I also highly recommend seeing it more than once.  My appreciation and love of the movie grows with each viewing.  There are so many memorable lines and scenes that will sure enough make this a cult hit within good time.

As I mentioned before, the characters and location are the real stars rather than plot.  Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson make a great team and really convince you that they are in fact ""Ray"" and ""Ken.""  And I cannot forget Ralph Fiennes who is both chilling and surprisingly even a bit sympathetic with his character.  The movie is brilliantly written, shot and directed.

I have to add that the DVD looks GORGEOUS.  I could've sworn that I was watching it on Blu-Ray.  The DVD includes a couple of behind-the-scenes featurettes.

""In Bruges"" was an amazing experience for me, and it's one that I'll never forget.  I love it when films dare to be different and refuses to be something where you can predict everything that is going to happen frame-by-frame.  There are surprises in this movie, yes, but nothing that happens in this movie happens without a reason.  I really hope more people will check it out.

3413850,4,B00189PSQS,"I got recommended this by a friend - it passed me by.

The story is straightfoward enough and the movie is mostly about the interaction of Farrell & Gleeson's characters....with a few stings in the tale.

I must say I was very impressed by Farrell.  Having only ever seen him in his Hollywood blockbuster stuff I had dismissed him, but he played this dark yet funny character. Ralph Fiennes was also brilliantly ""manically funny"".  Heck Gleeson's good too - it's just that Farrell is a stand out.

It is a quirky type of humor - dark, sarcastic, lots of swearwords.  There's only maybe a couple of real ""laugh out loud"" parts (the restaurant scene being my favorite!) but don't misconstrue that - there's plenty going on to keep you smiling.  If that's your kind of thing - and as a Brit it is for me - I would thoroughly recommend this.  And don't worry - you should be fine watching it without subtitles on!

3413851,5,B00189PSQS,"In 2002 we met this up-and-coming actor named Colin Farrell as he stole scenes from the very charismatic Tom Cruise in the sci-fi thriller `Minority Report' (I know that his big break came in 2000 with `Tigerland', but that film did not bring any kind of household name status).  The following year Farrell showed up in a slew of box-office big names like `S.W.A.T.', `Daredevil' and `The Recruit', and he showed surprising depth of character development in the underrated and underseen `Phone Booth'.  It was 2004 though, that was to bring him into the big leagues; sort of.  In 2004, at least in the beginning of the year, he was on the top of everyone's Oscar predictions for he was starring in two very controversial and highly anticipated films.  There was the independent `A Home at the End of the World' and the Oliver Stone epic `Alexander.  Sadly, both films failed, and while Farrell showed some strength in `Alexander' (I loathed his turn in `A Home at the End of the World') it wasn't nearly enough strength to stand out come Oscar time.  Since that fateful year it seems as if Farrell's star has faded.

This brings us to 2008; to be more exact, it brings us to a whole new Farrell.

I had all but given up on Farrell as being a serious actor and actually utilizing the talent I saw in `Phone Booth' when I happened to stumble onto a series of reviews for this little film.  I had read raves calling this Farrell's finest performance to date and so the fact that it was a gangster film (of sorts) and took place in Europe (with accompanying accents) and co-starred Ralph Fiennes all factored into me deciding to give it a shot.

Let me just say this now; one of the best films of the year, easily.

`In Bruges' tells the story of two hitmen, Ken and Ray.  Ken is older and wiser than Ray.  He possesses a certain calmness that comes from confidence and a level of comfort.  Ray is young and green, which leads way to fleeting spells of panic and uncertainty.  After Ray botches a job (his first at that) the two of them are sent away to a small medieval town (Bruges) to hide out, lay low, until they receive further orders from their boss Harry.  While in Bruges the two of them go through levels of self discovery that help shape them into the men they truly desire to be.

Writer/director Martin McDonagh has marvelously crafted a film that both exciting and intelligent.  It never sacrifices either for the other.  The film is never boring, for it is filled to the brim with action and charisma.  Both lead actors (Farrell and Gleeson) compliment one another flawlessly by playing two opposite ends of the spectrum.  Gleeson embodies Ken with this paternal warmth that helps add layers of humanity to this contract killer, especially as the film progresses and his true relationship with Ray is revealed.  Farrell ditches the paternal warmth for wit and charisma.  His portrayal of Ray is so real and natural.  We believe his faux performance (Ray's performance is faux; Farrell's performance is genuine).  We understand the mask that Ray puts up to hide his own insecurities, and as his past is revealed and his motives are unveiled we crumble for him; and this is only made possible by Farrell's undeniably natural performance.  Not one word spoken, not one movement made, not one moment of this performance is sour.

Honestly, so far it's the best performance I've seen this year; by anyone.

`In Bruges' tackles with grace and a fair amount of bloodshed the subjects of loyalty, friendship, morals and ultimately; atonement.  This is proof that genre films of this nature (the whole gangster, murder, hitman type genre) don't have to be riddled with plot holes and littered with poor acting.  `In Bruges' is brilliantly written and expertly executed.  It is not only thought provoking and haunting, but it is witty, charming and quotable (this film is filled to the brim with memorable lines).  The acting is marvelous (look also to Ralph Fiennes who has a nasty turn as Harry, as well as Clemence Poesy who serves as Farrell's love interest Chloe) and McDonagh's direction is spot on perfection, taking in the serenity of the city without losing the intensity of the situation.  This is a hit on every level that will satisfy any and every film enthusiast.",1228867200,6,4278,4.6916890080428955
3413852,4,B00189PSQS,"IN BRUGES is a very well acted, clever, often funny, and occasionally moving film about a pair of UK/Irish hitmen who have been sent to Bruges, Belgium, after a job goes bad. If you liked FARGO or other dark films with flashes of wit, you probably will like this one. By coincidence, I watched THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM during the same afternoon and would rate this film much, much higher.

Parts of IN BRUGES are genuinely thought-provoking and touching, especially where one hitman is trying to protect the other and where a brave pregnant woman puts herself in harm's way to stop a gunfight.

For the most part the plot holds together as well. My one objection is that a person who falls onto a stone pavement from a height of about 220 feet would NOT be able to speak immediately--even if he were still be conscious and still mentally focused (which I also think is very doubtful). I am not just guessing but am speaking from personal experience: way back when I was in third grade, I was thrown from only a height of 5 feet and slammed onto some grassy ground, which knocked my breath out of me so badly that I was unable to inhale any air, let alone speak, for what seemed like 2 or 3 minutes. On three other occasions I have had several of my ribs cracked by impacts, which has made speaking a bit difficult as well.

Be warned, though--this film has a trio of gangsters who not only do extreme violence but have world-class potty mouths. (One of the bonus features of the DVD, in fact, is a condensed run through the film with all the R-rated language laid end to end.)",1228521600,,1572,4.432525951557094
3413853,5,B00189PSQS,"It would be wonderful if this creation of writer/director's Martin McDonagh won an Oscar nomination.  [There's talk.]  It is almost indescribably brilliant.  A dark, scathing almost-comedy but also a tragic drama, it simply defies easy categorization.  You could see that in the ads (the breezy tagline ""It's in Belgium!"" is off-pitch).  I think the marketers no doubt struggled with how to pitch this now instant classic.  Someone did their job right though: Box Office Mojo tells me this small film raked in almost $32 million, over 75% in non-US receipts.  I suspect it'll have a nice reward in DVD sales and rentals, too, as the word gets around.  It's already lodged in IMDB's Top 250 (#233 as I write this review).

Beyond McDonagh, credit really belongs to the great cast.  Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson are magic together.  I liked Farrell saying (in the Extras on the DVD) that when he saw the script, he simply had to do it.  It was that good.

3413854,5,B00189PSQS,"Splendid performances by Colin Farrell, Brendon Gleeson (who played a spy in ""Sleepers"") and Ralph Fiennes as well as a solid story and magnificent cinematography lift this sometimes bloodstained film from the ranks of the ordinary thriller. Both Farrell and Gleeson's portrayals of paid assassins, in whom the charming canals, bridges, and gabled houses of Bruges engender a sense of conscience--and, ultimately, redemption--are worthy of Academy Awards; and Ralph Fiennes is also excellent in what for him constitutes an offbeat role as the unrelenting crime-boss who acts according to his own brutal code of conduct.

I was particularly struck by Farrell who was playing a character that in less skilled hands might seem both whiny and unsympathetic; his moving portrayal demonstrates both his superior acting skill and artistry (which were not evident in the material he was given in  ""Alexander the Great"").

The cinematography, which focuses not only on the enchanting Belgian city--which rivals Amsterdam as the ""Venice of the North""--but also on the magnificent art in its museum, provides an appropriate background for the story, in which the two assassins have come to Bruges for some special purpose, the nature of which they do not, at first, understand. The cinematographer has utilized the stark religiosity of the Flemish paintings, with their themes of torture and deliverance, to mirror the emotions of the unconventional protagonists.

Although the film has its comic moments, I think it does it a disservice to term it a dark comedy. It is more akin to a tragedy, the best of which use comedy to relieve the tension built up during the course of the action.  While the film is certainly not for children, it is highly recommended for discerning adult viewers who want more than simplistic action and car-chases in their thrillers.",1225756800,5,1849,5.212121212121212

This low paced low budget movie is so full of wit and brilliant lines that it makes more than up for the rather slow pace and predictable story line.

The interaction between the two main characters is brilliant as they both struggle with their chosen profession as hit men. The midget sub-theme is absolutely amazing not the least in the scene when they are under the influence of a multitude of drugs. Their well dressed heavily swearing boss (even American movies will find it hard to give the F word as much prominence as in the message left at the hotel!) best moment is when he gives the small time smug a lecture shortly after the poor guy has lost his vision on one eye is classic.

The movie is thoroughly entertaining and beautiful in its own little way.",1225324800,,1034,4.431578947368421
3413857,5,B00189PSQS,"Pan in on a sun filled view of a bridge crossing over into an architecturally diamond of a town which is magnificently beautiful yet unfamiliar to many called Bruges. Place Colin Farrell as a boyishly shy and strikingly handsome assassin who hates Bruges along with his bubbly savoring sight seeing cohort Brendan Gleeson. Then toss in a most hysterical yet drab controlling and humanely emotionless boss Ralph Fiennes and we have the 3 central characters. But wait, let's not forget the dwarf in his school boy attire as well as a sexy secretive blonde who catches Colin's eye as much as the river roadways catches Brendan's. What we have is a dryly humored plot with such laughs and heartbreakingly sad twists and turns that ends with...

Fiennes character is wonderfully strange. I'm not sure this is every one's cup of tea, but I was smiling through out.

Written and directed by Martin McDonagh, IN BRUGES is a quirky, totally unpredictable dark comedy that stars Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson as a pair of Dublin hit men, who are sent to the small Belgium city by their crime lord boss (Ralph Fiennes) to hide out after their last contract killing goes terribly wrong.

Gleeson becomes very touristy, wanting to savor everything about Europe's most well-preserved medieval city, but Farrell is totally bored until he encounters a Dutch film crew and a couple of people involved with the shoot.

I'm not going to reveal any more details about the story, because I don't want to spoil its many surprises.

IN BRUGES is, essentially, a gangster movie, but unlike so many other pictures of this genre, its characters are endowed with a humanity that allows them to change for the better.  Like the plot, writer-director McDonagh's dialogue is refreshingly witty.

The DVD from Universal Studios Home Entertainment has deleted scenes, a gag reel and ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes, including one on the film's extensive profanity.

3413869,4,B00189PSQS,"In Bruges follows the misadventures of two British hitmen, veteran Ken, played by Brendan Gleason and rookie killer Ray, played by Colin Farrell. After a hit that Ray performs goes horribly wrong, their boss, gangster Harry, sends them to Bruges, Belgium for a cooling off period. Ken enjoys the history and the scenery while Ray is bored and looking for action. The two wait for days to hear from Harry. When Harry calls, he orders Ken to kill Ray. Hilarity and horrors ensue.

While there are several supproting characters that weave in and out of the story, the film is really about the Ken, Ray, and Harry. Ken is older and wiser than Ray, but actually likes the younger killer a lot. He's very conflicted with his orders, not just because his boss will kill him if he does obey, but because he owes Harry a lot besides employment. Ray is a young, edgy simpleton charmer who on one hand can't wait to get back to London to enjoy the fast pace of the big city, but on theo ther hand is tormented by the gruesome nature of his botched assignment. Harry is a perpetually vile, ruthless criminal and a loving husband and father, which plays a lot into his wanting Ray dead.

In Bruges presents a lot of meditativeness on the spontaneity of life, the fleeting nature of the same, and all of the funny and strange things that happen to us along the way.

3413876,2,B00189PSQS,"So do you like violent films, or are you someone who enjoys beautiful scenery? Well, this film will please neither. It is too slow paced for the car chase and shoot-out crowd, and far too full of graphic violence to please those with more gentle sensibilities. So who is this film's intended audience? Someone who can enjoy ""clever"" dialog - except hit-men are dysfunctional (and possibly stupid) by definition, and you have to enjoy the f-word a lot. What we are left with is an audience who enjoys the existential pleasures of watching the sensibilities of hit-men buddies who are ""doing their thing"" - ah yes, they could get something out of it. ""Pulp fiction"" aficionados perhaps? Fans of dark comedy? Maybe ""Kind hearts and Coronets"" would be a better alternative. Would they care that the story takes place in Bruges?

This film wouldn't please the ""realism"" crowd either - people don't usually commit suicide by jumping from very tall bell towers as a short cut to the ground, in order to deliver a message (or at least provide a distraction). After they splat (truly) like a sack of tomatoes, they shouldn't be saying much either. I couldn't help wishing that the idiots had all killed themselves in the first five minutes, and then we could have enjoyed a nice tour of Bruges.

In the extras, there actually is a nice barge tour of the city center of Bruges (with no video cuts), although LARGE AND DISTRACTING SUPERSCRIPTS AND SUBSCRIPTS are embedded as video (so you can't turn them off) in order to describe the city's history.

Certainly this is a unique and visually beautiful film, but after the first viewing, the fast-forward button may be useful. I give it two stars for some nice scenery.",1219881600,5,1707,4.760135135135135

The movie was relatively slow-moving, and the only character I really sympathized with was Brendan Gleeson.  This is odd, considering the focal point of the story was Colin Farrel's character (who would show a glimmer of likeability only to resort back to his default, dolt-ish self).

As far as the story goes, there IS a significant plot twist.  However, a successful plot twist usually takes us in one direction before going into another unforseen direction.  In this case, the movie just shuffles around (going nowhere) before taking on the ""surprise"" plot issue.  Is it a ""twist"" when the plot was going nowhere before-hand?  Also, it was less than surprising.

On a positive note, the actors in this movie didn't disappoint.  Working with limited material, it was interesting to see the depth (or lack thereof) they gave their characters.

Also, it wasn't the worst movie I've seen this year.  There were some redeeming aspects (namely Gleeson's character).

While awaiting word from their boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes), Ken is interested in sightseeing and the history of the place, while Ray couldn't be more unimpressed and can't wait to escape.

After hearing so many wonderful things about this film I was absolutely prepared to be let down.  Movies rarely live up to the hype for me, but I am happy to say this one did and then some.

In Bruges had me laughing out loud, hard and repeatedly, as the political incorrectness and the way Ray and Ken play off each other is hilarious.  It had me sobbing big ugly girly tears as the emotion that pours from Ray, his guilt, his sadness, is absolutely palpable and heartbreaking.  This movie had me gasping at the violence, on the edge of my seat and on an emotional roller coaster from one minute to the next.  It was great.

The performances are grand by all three main characters and the supporting cast lends equally wonderful and interesting performances.  I found this to be a multi-dimensional and complex film filled with irony, humor, action and sadness. I was really stunned at the power behind Colin Farrell's performance.  He goes from a sort of spazzy, funny, slightly inept and combustible sidekick to a sensitive, deeply tortured soul in about 2 seconds and every facet of his character is believable and brilliant.

In Bruges is one of those quotable films with a billion awesome one-liners and moments.  This is easily one of my favorite movies this year and definitely upon my list of all time favorites.  I loved every fricken minute of it.

This film is more a character piece than anything else.  When you watch this movie you will find a movie that analyzes psyches of men one of which is just entering the hitman business and another who is a veteran hitman.

Watch this movie for the strong performances from all the actors and not for the action.

[Super late UPDATE - 06/08/14]

DISCLAIMER:  (I thought I mentioned this in my review beforehand.  But I just wanted to say that...) this movie does contain one short scene/segment near the end of the movie that I found to be at least slightly disturbing which, in all honesty, I think movie could have done without.",1218585600,2,1077,4.533678756476684
3413889,5,B00189PSQS,"First off: great flick!  Colin Farrell delivers in a role practically written for him (not sure if it was or not), and at least partially redeems himself for ""Alexander"".  Brendan Gleeson provides a nice performance as a stoic and pensive hit man, the mature counterpart and partner in crime to Colin Farrell's younger and brash character named Ray.  For reasons not exactly clear at first, we learn the two guns for hire have been sent to Bruges to cool their heals and wait for further instructions from the employer, Harry Waters (played very entertainingly by Ralph Fiennes) in Bruges, Belgium of all places.

Now under full disclosure, I have to admit I howled at this movie partially because I lived in Belgium for 3 years and as an outsider, I had many of the same observations as the characters in the movie.  Belgium is a strange Germanic-Franco crossroads in Western Europe.  The northern half speaks Dutch (or Flemish as they refer to it though the two are basically the same language), is closely linked to the Netherlands culturally and linguistically, but usually isn't too fond of the comparison. The south speaks French and is tightly tied to France through language and culture, and Brussels, the capital, is officially ""bilingual,"" though it's primarily a French-speaking city with English spoken more than Dutch/Flemish (the supposed other language earning its ""bilingual"" label).  Oh yeah, and just as side note, there are about 100,000 German speakers (but Belgian citizens) in the Eastern corner of the country.  And because of these frequently at-odds parts of the population, Belgium frequently comes across as a place with a lot of cool cities, but not necessarily a coherent or cohesive country.

And Bruges is definitely one of Belgium's coolest cities, and plenty of folks who have never been to Belgium or Bruges will still find this movie entertaining.  Be forewarned it is a BLACK comedy, where death and mayhem take on a comedic as well as tragic value (and there are equal doses of both in the movie).  Most of the negative reviews on here seemed to be surprised by the bleakness and I'm guessing for them, it overpowers most of the humour.

So, if you want to learn a little about Bruges, Belgium, through some very enhancing cinematography and the narrative provided by Brendan Gleeson's character, AND be thoroughly entertained by a very British-styled comedy (assuming you can handle the macabre-comedic elements of the movie), check this flick out.

3413892,4,B00189PSQS,"How do you make the story of a hitman who accidentally blew a hole through a child's head funny and light? It ain't easy, but IN BRUGE does it on several levels.

You definitely have to have a main character who can pull off something both dramatic and comedic. And that someone is Colin Farrell (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miami-Vice/dp/B000J4QWMC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miami Vice</a>), a killer who finds he's having trouble living with the accidental death of child who got in the way of a bullet.

Then you have to have a great co-star, and he turns out to be Brendan Gleeson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kingdom-of-Heaven/dp/B000EHSVQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kingdom of Heaven</a>). Gleeson has been a favorite star of mine since his American portrayal of Sheriff Keough in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lake-Placid/dp/B000035P86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lake Placid</a>. His combination of dramatic chops mixed with witty line delivery made him the perfect choice for this role.

You've also gotta have some sort of tryst going on, and there's actually several of those. The primary is that of Ray (Collin Farrell) and Chlo (Clmence Posy). Their brutal honesty with each other makes for some interesting mental sparring between the two and has some of the lighter moments within this otherwise dark dramedy. The other is that between Ken (Gleeson) and pregnant Belgium hotel owner Marie (Thekla Reuten). Ken's distant manner opens up to Marie during certain film segments, and Marie's stunning good looks and prideful appearance make her a person to be reckoned with. Another mini-tryst comes thanks to a film being produced ""In Bruges"" where one of its stars named Jimmy (midget Jordan Prentice) is out to have a good time with whatever women he can find (or drugs).

Normally location wouldn't necessarily play that important of a role in a movie like this that is truly a character study of dark people who are also genuinely decent in many ways. But Bruges, Belgium IS important. After Ray (Farrell) accidentally kills the small boy, he and Ken (Gleeson) are told to ""get out of town and head to Bruges."" For Ken, it's like a vacation; the stunning buildings and peaceful waterways put Ken in laid-back mode. But Ray is tense, on edge, and sincerely depressed at his accidental shooting of the small boy. The two clash as soon as they reach Bruges, and their differences are mirrored in the landscape around them: swans, steeples, guns, and prostitutes.

There's also a comparative study going on between a famous painting of Hell in Bruges, Belgium (that Ken and Ray check out), to that of the movie being filmed in town by Jimmy (Prentice) and that of the experience Ken and Ray find while visiting this quaint, Belgian community. I won't say more for fear of giving away too much.

The final bonus for movie watchers is checking out Ralph Fiennes (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Constant-Gardener/dp/B000C65Z1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Constant Gardener</a>) as the overly-scrupulous death dealer Harry Waters. He's a family man with a mob-boss mentality who must head to Bruges himself in order to set things right. And once he's there things really heat up! Bullets fly. Bodies fall from tall buildings with resounding *splats!* And he finds himself the victim of his own moral code in the end. Nicely played.

A warning should probably be given to those who are squeamish or don't care for the overuse of foul language. Both play out significantly in the film, but they are also integral to the characters and the life they've chosen. But you can't say I didn't warn you (the R rating is definitely deserved).

What's more interesting to me now, though, is that I would LOVE to see Bruges in person. The extra features on the DVD include a boat trip through the canals of Bruges and point out incredible spots of interest. An added bonus, for sure. I just hope I don't see any cloaked midgets or men with silencers running around.",1217808000,5,4136,5.411490683229814
3413893,5,B00189PSQS,"Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson turn in truly remarkable performances as two hit men on the lam in Bruges, Belgium, of all places. Colin Farrell's Ray is none too bright, comical, guilt-ridden, immature, and he suffers from a hair-triggered hot temper. As he clownishly mugs his way through the early part of the movie, pouting and sulking like the kid he is, his face becomes a rubbery map of his utter disdain for the cultural beauties of Bruges while his thick black eyebrows dance up and down mirroring his mood changes. By shooting a blank in a man's eye, he starts a chain of inevitable events that lead to tragedy.
 Gleeson's Ken, sensitive, bright, also funny, falls in love with the architectural charm of the Medieval city. For brief moments it's a Laurel and Hardy romp between the two men. There are stunning shots of the city throughout the movie. Why is Ken chaperoning Ray anyway? Early on touristy Ken is on top of a tower. With his hand he makes an imaginary gun and pops one off on the cloddish Ray down at street level.
 Hilarious is the scene in which three obese American tourists ask Colin about going up in the tower. He ends up being chased by the father and dancing around him. His brilliance is evident throughout the movie as he plays a character akin to the one he played in ""Cassandra's Dream.""
 Ray falls for a girl who is part of a movie company filming in Bruges, a company that includes a dwarf, a character that becomes crucial to the plot. Rays says, ""They're filming midgets."" Drugs, sex, and jealousy are introduced, and Ray's fateful journey proceeds a few more paces into inevitability like a Greek tragedy that cannot end until all is settled.
Late in the movie Ralph Fiennes turns in a great performance as a manic, rabid killer-boss.
The movie was written and directed by Martin McDonagh. For those familiar with his plays on Broadway and elsewhere (""The Lieutenant of Inishmore, ""The Pillowman,"" ""The Cripple of Inishmaan""), they will know to expect theater of the absurd inane dialogue, wild swings between the comic and the violent, lots of blood and gore, black comedy, and brilliant story set-ups and plotting.

""In Bruges"" is a dark comedy with witty dialogue most of the time, leadened with un p.c. humor, and bloody guts.

3413897,5,B00189PSQS,"As you start watching this film, hopefully without any prior expectations, you're taken in by the absurd hilarity of two hitmen sent to a sleepy Belgian town and their pathetic attempts at being touristy while waiting for further instructions. The lopey banter between them and among the people they find is fascinating and often laugh-out-loud funny. The character development is deft, twisted.

But as the real purpose of their trip becomes clearer, the film  takes a progressively darker turn. By turn ferocious and feeling, it grabs you right up to its soul-stretching finale. Bruges is quite a town, and treated with all the pizazz it richly deserves, but the real juice here is in the spectacular acting. Ferrel is spot-on in the skin of his bumbling criminal feeling remorse, Fiennes a walking dichotomy between mania and scruples, and Gleeson's mellowing middle-aged pro a fine breath of sanity amid insanity.

This is McDonagh's first movie after what seems to be a successful run as a playwright. His choice of climax here is not for the faint of heart; he clearly had a ball going plum off his nut. But when you are done, you know you have watched something hypnotic, something rare, something ultimately a provocative rumination over the conflicted humanity of even the most 'evil' among us. McDonagh the new film director has a firm spot on my watch list.

3413898,3,B00189PSQS,"For some reason, I just never made it to the theater to see ""In Bruges"", the new film starring Colin Farrell as Ray and Brendan Gleeson as Ken, two British hit men who flee to hide out in Bruges, Belgium when Ray accidentally kills a little boy during one of his hits. Their boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes) wants them out of the picture until the heat dies down, so he sends them to his favorite place in the world, for a little holiday.

""In Bruges"" is a type of film I am generally inclined to see; a gangster film, filled with interesting character actors, some humor, some action, and an exotic locale. But I never made it to the theaters and decided to watch it on DVD recently.

As soon as Ray and Ken arrive in Bruges, Ray is immediately ready to leave; he needs action, excitement, things to do, London, Glasgow and Dublin excitement. Sleepy little Bruges doesn't offer any of this. Ken, on the other hand, is smitten with the old world charm and wants to play the tourist, visiting all of the churches and historical sites, learning about them. Ray thinks he is mad, but they have to stay put until Harry calls with instructions and he tries to play along. They stumble across a movie set one evening and Ray eyes a beautiful woman, Chloe (Clemence Poesy, Fleur DeLacour in ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"") who agrees to a date. A midget actor enters the picture and they miss a call from Harry who is, kindly, very upset when they don't answer the phone and he realizes they aren't awaiting his instructions.

The problem with ""In Bruges"" is that it isn't very funny. At various times, there are bits of drama, bits of romance, bits of strangeness, bits of gangster-noir, bits of mildly amusing stuff going on. But these various, and disparate elements don't mesh into the whole the filmmaker is hoping for.

After Ray and Ken arrive in Bruges, we watch as they interact and learn about their relationship and why they have been exiled. This is the best part of the film because we get a real vision of the characters, a real feel for them. Then, the film introduces other characters and the film begins to become increasingly unfocused and moves in too many directions.

Colin Farrell is good as Ray. You get a real sense for how his life is spiraling out of control; he is clearly distraught about the death of the child he killed (which is shown and explained in a brief flashback) and this leads him to look for ways to deaden the pain and to divert his mind. When he meets Chloe, he unexpectedly finds himself attracted to her, as more than a one night stand, because she is very different from the other girls he meets; challenging, exciting, confident, unexpected and independent along with the requisite sexy. Once they meet, he almost begins to think he might be able to live in Bruges.

Brendan Gleeson is also good as Ken. Sent to chaperone, he tries to make the most of the trip and take in the sites, referring to a guidebook and giving an uninterested Ray a history lesson. Then Harry tells him the real reason for his trip and he spends some time trying to work out all of the issues before deciding he can't complete his assignment.

Ralph Fiennes is good as Harry, the crime boss who tries very hard to maintain a certain image but isn't beyond using a lot of fowl language. Speaking with a harsh, working class accent, Fiennes reveals his character's origins that help to show us how determined and desperate he is to maintain his place in life.

But as the film continues, it takes on an almost hallucinatory quality that just doesn't work. By the time of the inevitable showdown between the three leads, the story and characters lose any tenuous connection they may have already had and ""In Bruges"" becomes a film that is worthy of a DVD rental and little else.

My mind was clearly trying to give me a subtle message. ""Save your money, wait for the DVD"". Thornhill is good that way.",1216857600,3,3915,4.510578279266572

3413900,1,B00189PSQS,"If you go by the DVD packaging, or what a few of the 5-star reviewers have said about it, you'd assume that ""In Bruges"" is a slap-stick, hyperkinetic, gangster comedy in the tradition of Guy Ritchie films. This assessment couldn't be more misleading; ""In Bruges"" is a sluggishly paced, pensive, and largely quiet film full of long, slow wide angle takes, needlessly offensive dialog, and barely any comedy and action. Of the ""thrilling chases"" advertised, there is only one very poorly shot, very brief, and very poorly sequenced chase scene; similarly, there is one tired and particularly laborious shootout that drags on interminably.

Misleading packaging aside, this film is for folks who thought ""Snatch"" or ""Lock, Stock"" were about crass, bumbling, tough British gangsters who speak in near-impenetrably slanged cockney and are involved in an array of over-the-top schemes with unbelievably eccentric people, all of whom have crossed and will ultimately reckon with an entertainingly menacing, irredeemably bad guy. Certainly, the Ritchie films are about these things, and certainly ""In Bruges"" has a few of these elements (near-impenetrable cockney; crass, bumbling gangsters; pretty heroin dealers and a prostitute hiring/coke snorting midget for eccentric friends; and a weakly nasty, temperamental bad guy), but in ""In Bruges"" they're just window dressings, signifiers telling chiefly American audience members: ""I kind of look and sound like those clever and funny Guy Ritchie films! I must just as clever and funny!"" In truth, ""In Bruges"" lacks the smart language play that Ritchie's first films display, it isn't at all as tightly plotted nor as well scripted and fast paced, plot elements are clumsily forced to advance the story, and with the exception of Colin Farrell's grief over his mistaken slaying of a little boy, most of the actors are going through the motions, barely buying into their characters themselves. If you regard it as belonging to that context, the film's a failure; if you can remove it from that context and just watch it for what it is, it's still pretty awful.

If you're looking for a lazily realized British gangster film that's slow paced, poorly shot, and barely a comedy, this one's for you. If you're looking for a smart, fun, taut caper or heist movie, look elsewhere.",1216598400,19,2315,5.18716577540107

A basically simple plot (a hit man has screwed up, causing collateral damage; the boss needs to remove him, orders the partner to get it done, which turns out a problem...) runs into obstacles because the protagonists develop unexpected attitudes. Slapstick with guns.

3413904,3,B00189PSQS,"It's hard to believe, but it's been 14 years since Pulp Fiction was unleashed on an unsuspecting public. So what can we glean from this little factoid? What hath Tarantino wrought? Well, for one thing, the genre tag ""hit man comedy"" has now officially entered the cinematic lexicon. And, by the looks of things, (love it or loathe it) it is here to stay.

The latest example is a film that reportedly, er, knocked `em dead at the 2008 Sundance festival-Martin McDonagh's In Bruges. A pair of Irish hit men, Ken (Brendan Gleeson) and Ray (Colin Farrell) have botched a job in London and are exiled to the Belgian city of Bruges, where they are ordered to lay low and await judgment from their piqued Dublin employer (Ray Fiennes).

Ken is enamored by the ""fairy tale"" ambience of Bruges, with its intricate canals and well-preserved medieval architecture, and decides to go the tourist route. The ADD-afflicted Ray, on the other hand, fails to see the appeal of ""old buildings"" and would just as soon plant himself in front of a pint for the duration of his purgatory. Initially, Ken lures the reluctant Ray into joining him for sightseeing with the promise of some pub time afterwards. However, it quickly becomes evident that Ray lacks any kind of discernible social filter, displaying a general disregard for local mores and folkways. Ken decides that the best way to stay low profile would be to let Ray pass time as he wishes.

In order to avoid spoilers, I won't elaborate much more on what ensues, other than to say that Ray wanders off and finds himself a love interest and enjoys escapades like a coke binge with a ""racist dwarf"" while Ken finds himself thrust into a moral and ethical dilemma that fuels the dramatic turn of the film's final third. Toss some heaping tablespoons of raging Catholic guilt, existentialism 101 and winking Hieronymus Bosch references into the mix, and voila! (The Sundance crowd swoons...)

So what exactly has McDonagh cooked up here? Well, as much as I'd like to be able to tell you that it's ""an original dish"", I'd have to call it more of a ""sampler plate"" featuring a generous wedge of Quentin Tarantino and a few tidbits of Guy Ritchie, sprinkled with a taste of Brendan Behan. If you're a fan of dark (very dark) Irish humor, you'll likely get a few decent chuckles out of playwright McDonagh's brash and brassy dialog (and marvel at his creative use of the ""f""-word as a noun, adverb, super verb and adjective). Unfortunately, the humor doesn't fold so well into the mix with the generous dollops of dramatic bathos and queasy violence. Also, some of the more decidedly un-PC jokes fall terribly flat.

That being said, there are some strong performances here, almost in spite of the film's uneven tone. Gleeson and Farrell vibe a Laurel and Hardy dynamic together that works very well; you almost expect the doughy, exasperated Gleeson to exclaim ""Well, it's a fine mess you've gotten us into!"" every time Farrell throws more gas on the fire with another one of his Tourette's-like outbursts. Farrell has not previously impressed me as a nuanced performer, but in this film he proves to be quite deft at navigating the tricky waters of black comedy (that unibrow sure comes in handy). Gleeson (a world-class actor) is superb as always. Fiennes, who seems to be channeling Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast (by way of Michael Caine) goes way over the top with his archetypical caricature of a ""hard"" Cockney gangster, but he appears to be having a grand old time just the same.

I had an ""OK"" time on my little Belgian excursion with Ray and Ken; and the location filming does make for a great travelogue, as Bruges truly is a beautiful city-but In Bruges may not be the ideal cinematic getaway for all tastes. A guarded recommendation.",1216252800,24,3776,4.739726027397261

While in Bruges they are instructed to see the sights and soak in the city's charm by day and be by the phone awaiting the boss's next instruction at night. The two men, Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendon Gleeson), could hardly be more of the odd couple. Ray is the brash young man who feels that Bruges has nothing to offer except beer that he cannot enjoy because they have to stay in the hotel at night. Ken is older, completely appreciates the ""fairytale"" character of the city and has no desire to act contrarily to the instructions they were given. Besides being partners, what they do have in common is that they are clearly outsiders In Bruges.

This movie was sad, funny, maybe too graphic, a little ridiculous at the end, and not nearly the action flick that the synopsis might suggest. I enjoyed how the movie was about two men who kill for money, yet it was not about them killing anyone for money. I thought Farrell and Gleeson worked together very well, and particularly enjoyed Colin Farrell's contribution to the film.

I was surprised that Ralph Fiennes, a bigger name than his body of work might warrant recently, took a role that doesn't even come on-screen until nearly the end. I like him and I think he does great work which carried into this film. His part was simply an exaggerated power-hungry crime boss, which may help explain my earlier claim that the movie gets a little ridiculous at the end.

As the table turns towards the end of the movie and the characters show themselves to be more complex than they previously let on, the movie matured along their side. I thought there was a great contrast between the beginning and the end of the movie. I liked In Bruges from start to finish, and I find myself looking back on it more fondly even now.

That scene is brief and shocking, but is 100% required for the rest of the movie to make sense. So they're hiding in Bruges, waiting for the boss to call. And they start to wonder, why Bruges? The answer is surprising on a couple of levels and is typical of what makes this movie different from the rest.

The older assassin is able to spend his time savoring Bruges and coming to love it. The younger one never will and seems to enjoy finding new ways to insult the medieval town.

First of all, this film is in NO WAY a comedy, not even a dark comedy.  It is a very dark drama that has some admittedly funny moments.  But advertising it as a comedy misleads the audience.

In Bruges details the odd morality and sense of right and wrong held by a group of hit men.  When one of the group accidentally kills a small child, the boss sends him and his partner to the lovely, historical city of Bruges for a two week cooling off.  The movie centers around the two hit men on vacation, and how they spend their time while waiting to hear from their boss.  When the bossed finally makes contact, you get the ending you expect from the beginning.

My issues with In Bruges stem from the gratuitous, horrific violence of this film.  Yes, yes, it is about hit men, but I do not ever need to see a child being shot in the head.  It was completely unnecessary, and the information could have been conveyed in a number of different ways.  Clearly the director was going for shock value.  The movie was also full of drugs, stupid racist comments, and plenty of f-bombs.  While bad language does not normally offend me, I do prefer that it not be every other word.  Again, shock value.

Overall, the acting in this film was very well done.  Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson both do an excellent job in their roles, and are thoroughly believable.  Their friendship is actually quite touching. Bruges itself is charming - a lovely backdrop for a film.

In Bruges has been compared to Pulp Fiction.  However, I did not care for that film, either.  I want to be entertained when I watch movie, and I do feel this film could have been extremely entraining.  There IS a good story here.  It is just not carried out well, IMHO.",1215302400,9,1886,4.33810888252149
3413914,1,B00189PSQS,"This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.  The plot was disjointed, and the vocabulary boring.  How many ways can you use ""f***""?  If you need to know, watch this movie.  You'll find out how many ways in the first few minutes.  These ways will be repeated ad nauseum throughout the movie.  The actors were good at convincingly portraying mentally highly-unstable characters:  an aging hitman whose prostitute wife was killed in a brothel, a young hitman who botched his first hit and can't get over it, an easy drug-dealing girl, and a bigoted druggie actor dwarf.  Yes, it's as bizarre as it sounds.  I'm giving this movie one star for the beautiful scenery of Bruges, known in the movie as ""f***in' Bruges"".",1215302400,17,727,4.6171875

Having said that, I ended up watching the best movie I have seen all year. It is dark and violent with a sly quick humor. I can definitely see why it isn't a movie for everyone's taste but I loved it! I am not a big Colin Farrell fan but he was brilliant as well as Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes. I will end up watching it again because there were so many layers to this movie and I know I didn't catch them all.

3413916,5,B00189PSQS,"How to describe this deceptively simple film is the hardest place to begin. The plot's fairly simple: Two Irish hit-men, Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson), are sent to Bruges (in Belgium) to wait out the consequences of an assassination gone terribly awry.

The younger of the two, Ray, is bored and angtsy with the whole place. He's got a guilty conscience, having been the bloke who totally screwed up the hit. Ken, older and more sanguine about the whole matter, is the total opposite. He's enjoying the sights and quiet cadence of the city, seeing it as a brief respite from what he knows is a powder keg about to blow up in both their faces.

Without giving away key plot points (all brilliantly revealed as the beginning of the end begins to play out toward its tragic conclusion), all I can say is WOW! Though I have never been a huge Colin Farrell fan, I found the actor to be an absolute revelation. The man can actually act, excellently conveying Ray's guilty conscience with a manic, twitchy angst that practically sets the screen on fire. When Ray's mistake is finally revealed in all its heartbreaking glory, Farrell  manages to portray Ray's guilt and attempt at redemption in a scene that awes as well as chills the viewer. This is definitely an Oscar caliber performance, and one would hope the actor will continue to make such smart choices in future roles. The fact that Farrell gets to use his actual Irish accent is definitely a plus for the character. His Ray is a charming, annoying, childish, totally screwed up nut about to crack.

Gleeson, too, is equally convincing in his quiet, calm portrayal. His Ken, world weary and tried of the whole business of death, nevertheless knows he's got to pull back his shoulders and soldier on--even if it means he has to face the bad end of a gun himself from mob boss, Harry (an excellent Ralph Feinnes channeling an evil more vicious than even Lord Voldemort). Harry's riff on the Uzi he is offered by a gun supplier is hilarious, as is Ray's in run with a racist dwarf, among others as he ambles through Bruges seeking a solace neither drink nor drugs, or even a pretty girl, can offer.

The end for these three men is tragic, but totally fitting. I thoroughly enjoyed In Bruges and watched it several times just to soak in the early subtle clues leading up to Ray's mental meltdown. I admit that I had to watch the film with English subtitles on as I couldn't understand the actor's thick accents, but that wasn't any distraction or detriment.",1215129600,90,2521,4.630872483221476
3413917,5,B00189PSQS,"In Bruges is a delightful little film from the UK featuring Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson (you may recall him as Mad-Eye Moody from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000W7F5SS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Widescreen Edition)</a>).

By turns laugh out loud funny, poignant, and violent, 'In Bruges' has Farrell (Ray) and Gleeson (Ken) as two hit men sent to Bruges from England after Farrell botches a hit job.  Ralph Fiennes (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Constant-Gardener-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000C65Z1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Constant Gardener (Widescreen Edition)</a>) makes a stellar late appearance as Harry, the boss who comes over from London to straighten the pair of them out. Nearly every character in the film, however brief their role, is either interesting to look at or listen to or think about or all three.

Ray and Ken are an ill-matched pair - Ken decides to play the tourist and soaks up the canals, art and cathedral. Ray, on the other hand, never refers to Bruges without the adjective 'firking' in front of it (or something like that). Much of the film's humor comes from little bits of conversation and the contrast between the natures of the two killers. Ken takes Ray to the Basilica of the Holy Blood, but Ray cannot be bothered with kissing the vial. They see a triptych that includes purgatory, which Ray succinctly describes 'It's when you're not really [bad] and not really good - like Tottenham.'(This is a reference not to Tottenham the city, but rather to Tottenham the football team. Also, I think the triptych is Bosch's The Last Judgment').

Turns out though that Ray and Ken quite like each other - it's not going too far to say they are even devoted friends. Out of this devotion comes the film's poignancy.

The film has a fair amount of violence, mostly brief, but somewhat graphic and a surfeit of f-bombs and some c-bombs as well. The use of profane language as humor is harder to pull off now that profanity is so ordinary, but they manage it, sometimes by mixing it with proper and even delicate use of English, such as when Ken includes a reference to Harry's children in a profanity-laced riff, Harry demands that he retract the reference to his children and Ken quickly, almost shamefacedly agrees to the retraction, before resuming his choice references to parts of Harry's private anatomy.

Mostly, 'In Bruges' is just very funny while being a little odd and a little touching. Highly recommended.",1214956800,16,2651,5.501228501228502

3413919,5,B00189PSQS,"I've seen a lot of hit man movies but none quite like ""In Bruges"", which combines black comedy and high drama to surprisingly fresh effect. Not only is it genuinely funny, but it's original. I haven't seen these characters countless times before. Ken (Brendan Gleeson) and Ray (Colin Farrell) are a couple of Irish hit men sent to Bruges, Brussels to lie low after Ray accidentally killed a child on a job in London. Ken is able to relax and enjoy the sightseeing in the picturesque city while they await instructions from their boss Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes). But Ray is nervous, disinterested, and guilt-ridden -until he meets Chloe (Clemence Poesy), a woman working on a Belgian film crew who isn't put off by Ray's obnoxious behavior.

Martin McDonagh wrote and directed ""In Bruges"", his first feature film, and I'll be looking out for him in the future. He writes peculiar, politically incorrect dialogue that is both hilarious and unexpected. And I was amazed by this film's ability to make unrespectable characters so likable. Ray is an uneducated bigot, cute, but nevertheless grating. Yet his interplay with the older and wiser Ken is fascinating and leaves the audience routing for him. Harry Waters is single-minded killer, but he is so steadfast in his own bizarre value system that he's almost sympathetic. These men's rather serious problems ultimately had me laughing out loud. Ironically, I found the violence had more impact than in most gangster films, though I'm not sure if that is due to, or in spite of, the humor.

The DVD (Universal 2008): Bonus features include some Deleted & Extended scenes, a Gag Reel (6 min), and 4 featurettes. ""When in Bruges"" (14 min) interviews writer/director Martin McDonagh, the cast, and producer Graham Broadbent about the genesis of the story, characters, and themes. ""Strange Bruges"" (7  min) talks with director, cast, and production designer Michael Carlin about the city as environment and filming there. ""A Boat Trip Around Bruges"" (6 min) is literally a boat tour of the city, by canal, with the history of the city displaying as text across the top and bottom of the screen. ""Fooking Bruges"" (1  min) is a montage of all the F-words in the movie, which I count to be over 100. Subtitles are available in English SDH, Spanish, French.

3413922,4,B00189PSQS,"Martin McDonagh makes an impressive writing and directing debut with the very fresh and entertaining and surprisingly well rounded film IN BRUGES.  Though the basic storyline is rather simple, McDonagh knows how to keep it turning and twisting with generous amounts of humor as well as probing character development.  He has assembled a cast of very fine actors, turned the cinematography of the gorgeous Belgian city of Bruges over to the capable creative hands of Eigil Bryld, and finished his project off with a fine musical score by the gifted Carter Burwell (with a nod to Schubert and others): the result is a beautiful little film with messages galore and always a visual treat to see repeatedly.

Two hit men - Ken (Brendan Gleeson), a chubby, optimistic bloke who loves spending time with the sights of Bruges, and Ray (Colin Farrell), an emotionally distraught young man in the throes of guilt from a botched 'hit' that accidentally killed a young boy - have been sent by their 'boss' Harry (Ralph Fiennes) to 'lay low' after the botched murder  of a priest (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds).  It is Christmas season and there are too few rooms available so Ken and Ray reluctantly share a tiny hotel room to await further orders from Harry. Ken falls in love with the beauty of the city of Bruges while Ray, ever anxious and distrustful, finds some solace in a film being shot about 'midgets' (J&eacute;r&eacute;mie Renie) with behind the scenes girl Chlo (Cl&eacute;mence Po&eacute;sy). How these two Irish guys make the most of their enforced isolation ultimately leads to  the real reason for their assignment, a reason that includes a last 'hit' that sweeps the audience to a surprising ending.

McDonagh writes very well, giving some of the best comedic lines to Farrell who proves himself a fine fit for this difficult role.  Yes, it is another 'hit man film', but this one has the good fortune to deal with very real people, conflicted with their choice of 'occupation' and who are hungry to share their tenuous lives with good friends.  Though there is considerable bloody derring-do, the film uses the chase and kill scenes to good advantage, allowing the audience to feel the human side of those whose job it is to 'off' others.  Both Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson are superb and their roles are enhanced by a choice selection of character actors who speed the plot along nicely.  This is a very entertaining movie, one that can be appreciated on many levels, and one that suggests that Martin McDonagh has a solid future in cinema.

It is still possible to come up with a great, original, exciting movie experience. This feels like an entirely new genre of film. Yes, it is a comedy - The blackest of black comedies. The dialogue is brilliant...stunning in some places and that's where the laughs come from. The setting becomes a character in itself and crucial to the juxtaposition of the brutal with the beautiful, the wise with the stupid, the boring with the exciting and the politically correct with the outrageously offensive. The brutal violent moments are there for a reason - to flesh out the morality play that is 'in play.' Best film I have seen in a long time. Amazing to watch. Interesting to think about.

3413924,5,B00189PSQS,"The undeniable charm of In Bruges lies in it's lead cast and the dynamite direction and script from Martin McDonagh; who weaves a tale of hitmen Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson).  Ray is the rookie who recently made a horrible mistake during a hit, while Ken is the wily veteran who seeks to help the lad out any way they can.  Under orders from their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes), they are holed up in Bruges; a small, tourist town in Belgium, which becomes quite a big factor as things develop and slowly spin out of control.  If you've seen trailers or previews of In Bruges, you may think this is a straight out dark comedy.  Well, while it certainly features it's share of comedic moments (mostly by Farrell), In Bruges is better described as being the well-paced and just plain refreshing gangster drama that deserves your attention.  Farrell, Gleeson, and Fiennes are spectacular and magnetic, the dialogue is addictive, and the film's conclusion is just plain shattering.  All in all, In Bruges more than deserves your attention, and even if you've never heard of the film and the description tickles your fancy, check this out.",1214265600,13,1147,4.7969543147208125
3413925,2,B00189PSQS,"This movie is advertised on the box as being a comedy.  It is not a bit funny at all. The premise of gangsters shooting it out in the beautiful city of Bruges is what is supposed to be the comedic element I suppose.  This may not be the fault of the people who made this movie however.  It is clearly a dark drama that they tried to inject a little humor into but it's not a dark comedy at all.  I guess a small boy getting his head blown off in a church is funny to a drug addict mentality; but for most of the people on this planet , this is not humorous.  And even worse than this is that you have to sit through  a 15 minute scene in the middle of the movie in which people do alot of drugs and say stupid rascist comments , and scenes in which people think about things on drugs which distort all reality anyways are always the ultimate bore.  The acting however is first class in this movie and the characters are well developed.  The box warns that this movie isn't P.C. and that's fine but if they had said this is a dark drama with a few comedic elements they would have been saying the truth.  Still colin ferrel and the rest of the cast do make the characters engaging enough to forgive the weaker elements of the movie.  I don't think this was sold to the theaters as a dark comedy so I can at least cut the filmaker some slack on that issue.
He clearly has talent and he may have been trying to be hip by adding the endless boring drug taking and talking scene; but a good editor would have shortened that scene and focused more on the solid acting of gleeson and ferril as these two men bond together.  And the best friends you have are not party friends, but  are those who are  bonded to you by your real experiences in life. Ironically the character that Brandon Gleeson plays understands this and this means the filmaker did too, he just got sidetracked by the now outdated idea that showing alot of drug usage makes a movie cool.",1214092800,12,1948,4.176470588235294

Martin McDonagh created a Dantean circle of hell, with Colin Farrell's character attempting to escape via booze, sex, dope, suicide, train, boat. He finally faces his metaphorical dragon-father in the face of Ralph Fiennes, who is a twisted rope of black/white/grey/red. Jordan Prentice is, as usual, wonderful/complex & his surly rejection of Colin's ""Hi"" leads to a ""Ralph Roister-Doister in the Apocalypse"" scene. Clemence Posey is delicately wicked. All the character actors were great. Brendan Gleeson is at his best in this film, a soft, sweet, caring killer whose last act redeems him. There is no bow-tied ending, we are left wondering if the white walls of the ambulance are the ""white light"" everyone talks about in NDEs. My husband & I have seen this film 3 times & cannot get enough. Of course, one of my degrees was in Medieval Lit' (I HATE Bosch, though) & my husband's was in Anthropology.

3413934,5,B00189PSQS,"I have never been to an Irish wake, but I have a stereotype in my head that probably helped this film to work for me. In my stereotype there is a charming and endearing mixture of jolly disorder and tragedy, emotional twists from angry conflict to affection and back, mixed and even screwy personalities, and wandering minds. Some may need to think of this as an ethnic film to fully appreciate it.

The heavy accents were hard to follow, but if I try to imagine this in American English, it just would not have worked for me.  Why not? -- I am sure others will itemize the various improbabilities here and there in the film. Yes there were a lot of ""coincidences."" Yes there could have been less blood and gore."" Perhaps there was not much moral point to the film -- except that if you notice it did deal with compassion and honor among people probably very different from most viewers. And, how could anyone keep moving with all those bullets in them. Yes, yes. Need I go on? You might want to try to think of this as a subtle fantasy in a photogenic city -- and then enjoy.

In any event I really got involved. There were a lot of wonderful lines and some great facial expressions. Bruge was a great setting. I am glad that the director let the camera linger on the actor's faces because that was where a lot of their humanity came through and they were excellent actors. There was a lot of wonderful cleverness all around in the story, dialogue, direction, acting, etc. -- if nothing philosophically profound that I caught. This is not trying to be Bergman or Jodorowsky. Interesting mix of music!

Despite the fact that I found the heavy accents necessary I hope that when the film goes to DVD it will have English subtitles!! I also would like to see more of Bruge in the bonus features. I ALWAYS want an intelligent director's commentary if I am going to purchase a film -- so please. It is a visually very nice film and verry good entertainment and I would buy a DVD with good extra features.

3413935,5,B00189PSQS,"Before I start, let me just for a moment sing the praises of Brendan Gleeson, one of the stars of IN BRUGES.  Is there a better character actor working in films today?  This man elevates everything he's in.  Right of the top of my head, I can remember his role as ""Mad-Eye Moody"" in HARRY POTTER, his touching turn as the father in 28 DAYS LATER and even his law-enforcement role in GANGS OF NEW YORK.  Here is a man so at ease in what he does that he usually upstages ""big"" stars he shares screen time with.

Finally, with IN BRUGES, he has a lead role.  And thank goodness it's in a darn good movie.  It's the story of two London hit-men who've been sent to the Belgian town of Bruges to lay low for awhile after a hit went wrong.  Gleeson is the more experienced of the two, and he's delighted with the town...which he says is the oldest surviving medieval town in Belgium.  It DOES seem to be charming and certainly I now would love to visit.  Colin Farrell plays the younger of the pair...he's crawling out of his skin with boredom.  He could care less for the charm of this town...he wants to go to the pub and drink and meet girls.

Eventually, these two will draw some unwanted attention from their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes) a psycho of the first order...but one with a lovely family and a strangely strong sense of honor.

The first half of the film takes its time letting us get to know the two leads and to enjoy their banter.  Eventually we discovered exactly what went wrong with their job, and the film takes on a deeper texture.  It's not really a buddy film...it's a father/son film.  Gleeson tries to help Farrell appreciate the world around him more, but he is also bemused by him.  He's a gentle soul, who enjoys sightseeing, reading and a nice meal.  He's courtly to the pregnant lady who runs the hotel.  He's softspoken, and frankly it's hard at first to picture him as a killer.  In fact, he seems a bit perplexed to be one.

Farrell is the ""hot head,"" but not in a clichd way.  He's a bit simple, but he's open to learning...a trait he didn't know he had.  While he's got a quick tongue and quick fists...he's oddly gentle too.  Gleeson sees a soft side in him that even Farrell doesn't acknowledge yet.

There are lots of oddball characters populating the film, including an American dwarf in town to film a movie and an attractive young lady who makes her living robbing tourists...but falls pretty hard for Farrell.

When really come to like these guys, so when Fiennes pops into the picture to really screw things up...our stress level goes up much more than it would in a conventional film of this ilk.  While the ""chase"" scenes are pretty tame...they are also very intense and convincing.

The joy of the film is in the two lead performances, and in their witty banter.  Farrell hasn't been this good in a LONG time.  He's still the ""playboy"" but in a convincing, almost shy way that makes him instantly likeable.  Gleeson is terrific, as I've said, and he is quite up to the task of carrying the film.  He has a great scene when he's on the phone with Fiennes and must convince his boss that he's chased Farrell out of the room...when Farrell was never there in the first place.  It's funny but fraught with tension...because you can tell by Gleeson's manner that his quite concerned that he's going to raise murderous ire in the unhinged Harry.

The dialogue is very clever...certainly it's very much a cinematic script, in that no one really talks this way.  But everyone chews into their lines with such joy that the audience cannot help but be sucked in.  The two leads are clearly enjoying playing off each other...Gleeson gives Farrell so much to work with that they both simply pop with energy.

The film is a little slack in the middle.  There's a scene when our two hit men spend time doing some drugs with the dwarf and some female friends that seems pointless and for once, the dialogue feels totally contrived.

And the final scenes, while quite thrilling, require just one or two too many coincidences and chance encounters.  That all the main characters suddenly find themselves together in the same spot at the same moment is just a little bit much.  But fortunately, the film still plays out quite satisfactorily...and quite brutally.

I had a great time with the unfortunately named IN BRUGES.  I can't help but feel that a lot of folks will miss this delightful film because it's title is unpronounceable for so many.  It's a shame, because this is easily the best film of early 2008.",1204329600,5,4534,4.517199017199017

I definitely like this one more than Seven Psychopaths, but it may be on par with Three Billboards. Both have the same high level dark comedy/action mix",1523232000,,314,4.25
