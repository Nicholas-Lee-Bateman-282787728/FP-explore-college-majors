8245357,4,B0012DUCGG,"Our son and wife, alng with teenager daughters, flew to Barcelona 10 days ago for fun.  I never knew this magnificent basilica even existed.  What a fortunate surprise to know our son has been in the La Sagrada familia 6 times in his travels for work.  I was so disappointed in the short time it was photographed on thos DVD.",1376352000,,325,4.383333333333334
8245358,2,B0012DUCGG,"Promt delivery, this much is a positive. But I was really expecting more. Only a few minutes long & not much information at all.  I had seen a documentary on television & thought what a great program to show my children & grandchildren. This magnificent structure & the story of the designer & history of the builders.  So impressive!  This DVD is very disappointing. I'm going to the library to see what I might find there.",1363305600,,424,4.552631578947368
