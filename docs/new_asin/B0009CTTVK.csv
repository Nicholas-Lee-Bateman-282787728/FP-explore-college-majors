2276904,5,B0009CTTVK,"maybe it's just because i'm obsessed with this show, but this is one of the best i've seen. it has all the qualities i love about Fullmetal Alchemist, comedy, action, meaningful plotlines, all in just four episodes. It's not reccomended for younger people or people who don't like violence, but if you can put up with that, it's definitely worth buying.",1140393600,,353,4.80327868852459
2276905,5,B0009CTTVK,"When Ed and Al return to Eastern HQ, with a stray cat hidden in Al's armor, they are full of questions about the mysterious Dr. Marcoh, who possibly researched the Philosopher's Stone. As we all know, Ed's hunger for this knowledge knows few bounds. When he realizes Mustang knows more than he's telling, Ed requests that his annual assessment by the State Alechemists be a combat one, pitting him against Mustang. If he wins, Mustang will cough up the info.....and take care of the cat! Meanwhile, Scar, the frightening killer that has been executing State Alchemists, is making his way towards the East and we finally learn what his grudge is. Ed and Al also find out that the State Alchemists past is one that is clouded with blood.

Another installment in a classic show. The first episode is a bit more humorous than the current story arc. The showdown between Ed and Mustang is more comic than deadly. But Full Metal doesn't hold back on the violence when it has too either, or the sadness and tragedy as we find out about a 10 year old massacre perpetrated by a government driven mad with power against defenseless rebels, and sanctioned by the Alchemists. Things get more and more intriguing. Fantastic show.

Extras: Video for the new theme song by L'Arc en Ciel, Openings/Closings, Production art and image gallery, Character profiles. Also the first episode of the anime Spiral.",1130198400,,1389,4.807531380753138
2276906,5,B0009CTTVK,"I love this series, the characters are strong but real, while at times they act on impulse sometimes they make choices that are human. Some choices are mature, this fits the Ed and Al, they are that way because they have had to be independent from a young age. The voice of youth still lives with them and that is most evident in episode 13 ""Fullmetal vs. Flame"" which I found to be a humerous episode that also gives a hint to the dark past of the army's involvement in the eastern rebellion. This is the main theme throughout this volume you begin to understand the mysterious past, and the situation of the present becomes clearer. I also found episodes 15 ""The Ishbal Massacre"" and 16 ""That Which is Lost"" rather touching because you see the brothers very close bond with each other and how they use each other for their strength. You also get a glimpse into the life of a war veteran, and what he has to say is rather touching and meaningful. This volume is a must for the series the only thing is that to know what happens next you must purchase Volume 5 ""The cost of Living""",1127952000,3,1081,4.356435643564357
2276907,5,B0009CTTVK,"Funimation has done a great job with the dub and done very little censoring.

The voice actors are fabulous, something that has not happened too often with dubbed anime.

The packaging is GREAT!  I love the information books that come with the DVD.  They have helped me addict MANY more people to the LOVE that is Fullmetal Alchemist.

I'm not going to give a plot summary, because you can get it on the [adult swim] page, or any other anime page...that and Episode Spoilers STINK!

The vaguely European/German/Russian setting is great, the soundtrack recorded by the Moscow Symphony Orchestra is VERY moving...the motif of Bratja just breaks my heart.  (I am VERY glad that I got the Volume 1 boxed set combo with tin/soundtrack.)

I've even gotten the redneck neighbor and my 70 year old father interested in this stuff...it has mass apeal and excellent production values.  They were VERY careful about plot holes and continuity.

Re-watch these a LOT and watch with sub-titles as well.  You will get many subtle details/hints that they drop throughout the series in backgrounds, street signs...seemingly non-important things.  Just those small details that change it from a ""kids' cartoon"" to something deeper and much more enjoyable for the thinking person.

*Although now it has me googling old alchemists/physicists.*",1120262400,22,1323,5.126168224299065
2276908,5,B0009CTTVK,"I have seen a couple shows of this series and it has proven awsome....as many reveiwers have stated.  I really would like to here more peoples opinions on these show....I haven't saved eough money yet to but any of the DVDs, and I can't get the channel Cartoon Network, because I live in Canada.  Your reveiws are all I have and being a big anime fan and an even bigger FMA fan its killing me!!!!Please as soon as this DVD comes out reveiw it in detail.....but don't put any spoilers in it.  I know this will be hard to do but please try!",1116979200,,538,4.203883495145631

8058998,5,B0009CTTVK,"I really wish the would do a box set for these. It gets a little annoying to have to buy each in a seperate box instead of getting a slim case set in a box.

regardless I'm addicted to this series and am still purchasing all the other DVDs.

I've been kind of hoping that they will re-release these in HD but I doubt they will do that anytime soon.",1194134400,,348,3.9571428571428573

8059000,5,B0009CTTVK,"I am not a spring chicken, so I get introduced to anime through my daughter. Some of it is fluffy love stories or improbable characters or situations that appear from nowhere to solve the day. Full Metal is none of these. The characters are believable even when they are a talking metal suit of armor. Ed and Al are young boys. Their mother dies. They desparately want her back. They do something forbidden. They pay. And they learn what the costs are. The world is a confusing place. They navigate, sometimes on their own and sometimes with people who they meet along the way. Not everyone is who they seem at the start. Finally they confront the costs of their and other peoples violations of the rules. Through the story there is humor and growth. The story is told from their point of view. They do not give in to the tragedies that surround them and keep fighting for the truth and for each other. I highly recommend this series for young teens and old fogies (that's me). Much better than most things available for teens these days. I rank this up with Dante and Faust as literature about pacts made by people not understanding the full consequences of their actions fighting to restore the balance of their lives.",1170633600,2,1220,4.575342465753424
8059001,5,B0009CTTVK,My sister is crazy for this series and the DVD is full of all kinds of extras.  They are great.,1168300800,,95,3.75
8059002,5,B0009CTTVK,"In my reviews of the last volumes, I made it quite clear that I love almost everything about Fullmetal Alchemist, including the story, characters, soundtrack, and animation. For this review, I've decided to concentrate on the action of the series, especially since in this volume, the Fall of Ishbal, the action is heavy.

In the first episode, Edward Elric faces off with Mustang in the hopes to earn some valuable information as well as to find a home for an abandoned kitten that Alphonse has found. This fight is nothing short of hilarious, yet still contains a lot of explosive action. In episode two, Destruction's Right Hand, the Brothers Elric find themselves the target of a mysterious, scarred man who has the power to shatter brains from the inside. All of the fights with this character are amazing, and these battles continue on into the third episode. Finally, though, the action stops as the brothers must journey back to there hometown for general R&R.

Though the entire series had quite a few impressive battle sequences, this volume contained the best so far. I was floored by the battle in the first episode on this DVD between Fullmetal and the Flame. The detail and the break-neck pace was breath-taking, and not only that but it stayed light and funny, adding elements of comedy while keeping the intensity strong. And since it's still relatively early in the series, the promise of a lot more action is just another thing that keeps me hooked. FMA is turning slowly into one of the greatest anime ever created (but not yet, at least in my view).",1150070400,,1569,4.785977859778598
