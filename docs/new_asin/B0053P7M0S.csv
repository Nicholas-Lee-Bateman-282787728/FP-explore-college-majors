8455569,5,B0053P7M0S,"Just seeing the interaction of the people on the streets and hearing the music made this worth watching.
The stories of the lives of those people is just a big bonus !
It's the story of the Blues and how it came together in Chicago",1391385600,,231,4.155555555555556
8455570,4,B0053P7M0S,"This video presents a pretty good represntation of music on Maxwell Street in its heyday.  It's gone now; you can't even stroll the street where filming took place.  Don't buy this video for the music...it's uneven at best.  But if you want to get a sense of one of the influences on Michael Bloomfield, Corky Siegel, Buddy Miles, Paul Butterfield, Elvin Bishop and the rest of Chicago's blues musicians in the seventies, then this DVD is what you want.",1363132800,,453,4.708860759493671
