This video is simply a series of short clips observing a few of the creatures found in the soil under a microscope.  The content isn't great.  This video is educational, but not entertaining.  If you are looking for a video for entertainment purposes consider:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-in-the-Undergrowth/dp/0691127034/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life in the Undergrowth</a>.  If you are looking for an educational option consider getting some worm bin or leaf material and putting it under a microscope with a document camera attached for the students to see in real life, it is much more engaging.

I won't purchase this again as I can make these videos much better myself through a microscope in the lab and a camera.",1358380800,,895,5.634328358208955
