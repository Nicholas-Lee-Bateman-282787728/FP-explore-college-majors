8565979,5,B00BCJ0Y5O,"Definitely a challenging DVD... I spent about 50 minutes with this one it was both challenging and enlightening. Max Milligan first takes you through playing in 10ths and then chord embellishment and then on to soloing.

This is a great DVD to own for any guitarist no matter if you're a fan of John Frusciante or not, or whether you're familiar with his work or not!",1468281600,3,367,4.5606060606060606
