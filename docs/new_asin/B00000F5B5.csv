1202971,3,B00000F5B5,This was an entertaining film that was moderate. I did not make a connection with the story because it failed to draw me in and the lead figure was warm but not engaging. The leads lover ( Nino) was engaging and charming. The story was slow and did not have an emotional impact. Not a great investment but worthy of a look.,1077753600,,323,4.225806451612903
1202972,4,B00000F5B5,"Imagine just starting to deal with being gay, in an Italian family, with parents that are just this side of looney, and you get the basic premise of the new gay film ""Mambo Italiano"".
This Canadian import is an enjoyable romp through the life of one Angelo Barberini, an attractive  young Italian male who's just starting to deal with coming out of the closet. His life is entralled with two controlling parents whose only desire is for their son to meet ""a nice Italian girl"" and settle down, one sister who lives for her Valium and visits to every psychologist in Toronto, and his soon-to-be extremely closeted cop boyfriend Nino.
One mistake the movie could have made, but never does, is to take itself too serioiusly. It's a fun romp, fast paced, and full of funny moments. As Angelo comes out to his parents, you seem him blossoming within his own life, as he attempts to take charge of the situation. Luke Kirby does an excellent job in his role as Angelo, allowing the audiences to sympathize and laugh with him at the same time. And Tim Post, as a gay help line volunteer, comes across as charming as Rupert Everett in his role.
Fun, light hearted, and quite an enjoyable film, you won't be disappointed with this Canadian winner of a film, ""Mambo Italiano"".
For DVD fans, the DVD comes with no extras at all, which I did miss. But hey, you can't have everything!",1077235200,4,1371,4.573170731707317
1202973,2,B00000F5B5,"To be completely honest I didn't know what to expect when I first popped MAMBO ITALIANO into my DVD player, but I did expect a film with much more substance and sincerity than what was delivered. The premise of MAMBO ITALIANO is nothing new: a young man, Angelo, comes out of the closet to his family when they realize that his ""roommate"" is so much more than just someone who helps contribute to the cable bill. However, to add a spin Angelo comes from a quintessential Italian family who is less than sympathetic or understanding to his lifestyle. His mother and father are the stereotypical high-strung, overly emotional Italian parents who want their son to meet their expectations and be a good reflection on their Italian neighbors and friends. But unfortunately this came off as flat and tiring. Been there, done that. Furthermore, it is apparent that whomever wrote this screenplay has no inkling, let alone personal experiences, of coming out of the closet or being gay. I found many scenes and dialogue to be outright ridiculous and contrived. The inclusion of the gay village that Angelo visits for the first time and his insistence that he has nothing in common with ""them"" is hilarious, but not in the manner which it was intended. One would think that he would have had some exposure to gay culture, whether directly or unintentional, to be more educated and acclimated. To add insult to injury the entire sequence where Angelo volunteered at the gay teen hotline is ridiculous. Angelo and Nino's relationship is as cold as my freezer, and just not believable in any context. In addition, the laughs were few and far between. MAMBO ITALIANO is an ethnic comedy that went sour and has little redeeming value. I don't mean to rip this movie apart, but it's just so bad.",1077235200,6,1781,4.785714285714286
1202974,5,B00000F5B5,"This movie is very funny, fast-paced, has a memorable look to it, and a directorial style to it like the movie Amelie.  It's very Canadian (more specifically, very St. Leonard) and proud of it!  The actors are great.  I've seen the both the French and English plays (on which the movie is based on) and the movie takes the best parts of both, adds in some extra ingredients to make it the best version so far.
If you are in the mood to laugh, this is the movie for you.  You don't have to be gay nor Italian to enjoy it!  Mambo Italiano has been unjustly compared to My Big Fat Greek Wedding - I HATED that movie!  It was barely funny.
My only quips with Mambo Italiano are (1) there were no scenes where the 2 sons show any hint of affection towards each other prior to the big coming out, and (2) the DVD doesn't have a running commentary track.  On the plus side, one of the bonuses is a compilation of comments from the cast, director, and writer which is quite interesting.",1077062400,,978,4.254054054054054
1202975,4,B00000F5B5,"I was a bit apprehensive to view this film.  I'm gay and Italian and I was quite worried that an attempt to portray a combo of both in merely 85 minutes would result in a glut of over-done cliches and caricature-like stereotypes.  I also think that movies that focus upon the traditions and idiosyncracies of various sub-cultures often pigeonhole their respective population into a long list of unfair expectations and prejudices.
Fortunately, Mambo Italiano pulled off the impossible.  It poked fun of tradition while allowing the viewer to realize that tradition and culture can be tortuously binding and limiting.  Where this little film also succeeded was in its juxtaposition of the old and the new.  The young progenitors of culture are usually the ones who break new ground, who shed the excess and limiting traditions for new, more progressive ones.  But, at the same time, as traditions become entrenched in our adolescent minds, they often become so set in adulthood that they have fossilized into our subconscious.  We do things without realizing that we are doing them.  Mambo Italiano presents this fight.  Some of the characters move on.  They live in harmony with their own culture but not limited by it.  Others succumb to the claws of their predecessors, out of weakness, fear and even comfort.  These results are inevitable in any true subculture.  We persist.  We succumb.  We endure.
I recommend this film to anyone, especially those of ethnic backgrounds.  It's never heavy-handed.  It's sometimes too outrageous.  You'll smile.  You laugh.  You'll be frustrated.  But, most importantly, you'll be entirely satisfied by this quaint and almost poignant Italian feast.",1077062400,3,1687,5.174074074074074
1202976,3,B00000F5B5,"Mambo Italiano does for the Italians what My Big Fat Greek Wedding did for the Greeks.  Only this time, the couple is gay.  Both portrayed the typical cultural stereotypes, and both came off cute but not lasting.  Mambo Italiano deals with a typical Italian family living in Little Italy in Canada.  When their son moves out, moves in with his lover, and then comes out to his family, all hell breaks loose.  The movie tries to be a laugh a minute comedy, but the true comedy comes from Luke Kirby who does an outstanding job.  He is the only character with real comedy and emotion, and he lights up the screen in all his scenes.  It is easy to see why he was cast in the lead.  Mambo Italiano isn't a movie that inspires, but it's perfect after a long day after work to just sit back, relax, and enjoy a few chuckles.",1077062400,7,818,4.300653594771242
1202977,5,B00000F5B5,"I saw Mambo Italiano 4 times in the cinema and loved it more with each viewing. Only paranoid persons would complain about any of the characters by suggesting they are stereotypical. And it is foolish to compare this fine romantic comedy to My Big Fat Greek Wedding just because of the ethnic theme. (MBFGW was a major disappointment to me - I thought it was whimsical, but bloated and forced). At least this CANADIAN film had the integrity to keep its original location rather than pretending to be set in America to suck up to the $US.
Mambo Italiano is fast, clever, beautiful to look at, edited to perfection, gives very honest and very rare glimpses of suburban gay life (just as true here in Brisbane, Australia as in Montreal). Also it's very well acted by all the ensemble - some of Canada's very best.
Mambo Italiano should adapt readily to the small screen, because it is plot and character driven, but it's definitely worth cranking the volume and sitting through to the credits when Cake's version of ""I Will Survive"" will leave you fully charged.",1076025600,8,1059,4.698924731182796

1202979,5,B00000F5B5,"A movie about two Italian families with (gasp) gay sons, which as I understand it from the movie is not a good thing if you're Italian. But as the movie goes on Maria and Gino begin to accept Angelo as being gay and are actually quite proud of him. I quite enjoyed this CANADIAN made movie, in which most of the stars are Canadian. I would recommend this movie for anyone who needs to laugh, and as you can see from other peoples reviews you don't have to be Canadian or Italian to enjoy it.",1072828800,6,491,4.178947368421053

Luke Kirby is a great actor. I've seen him since in roles where he plays a straight man and he did an amazing job. In this film, however, he plays a gay man in a strict Italian-American family. It is so fun, funny, and amazing that you'll laugh yourself to tears! There are gay themes, but nothing is gratuitous in any way! Watch it and enjoy it, because a lot of gay movies are sad; this one was not.",1487030400,,558,4.470588235294118

I do admit that I was disappointed with the ending at first.  We want Angelo to win Nino back but in the end it became apparent that Nino was too scared to come out of the closet and disappoint his mother.  Unfortunately, it's a scenario that has become too common when closeted gay men get married and get an innocent third party involved.  I personally would have rewritten the ending so that we see Nino's regret but it's too late to stop the marriage.  It was nice to see that look of uncertainty on his face; he'll always wonder if he's doing the right thing.  Overrall, a great film.",1390176000,,739,4.553030303030303

1204666,3,B00000F5B5,"I'm not sure if the number of stars I gave this movie is fair or not. I saw this movie listed as a good gay movie to see, and wasn't sure what to expect, except that it was probably a comedy. I gave this movie 3 stars because the ending is not what I thought it would be, and perhaps maybe my rating is unfair.

First, the movie is funny and does portray the stereotypes of the old Italian community. In some ways, the ending of the movie was good with Angelo's family loving him and supporting him for who he is, regardless of him being gay. And Angelo winds up having a different boyfriend. But I thought perhaps Angelo and Nino would reunite in the end, which is not the case. I've read a few other reviews, and I didn't see anyone else pick up on this point. That is that history repeats itself with how Nino treats Angelo. When they were little kids, they were the best of friends. But in high school, Angelo was seen as more of a outcast by others. So, Nino didn't want to be seen associating with Angelo so that he would be liked by the other kids, and he renounced his friendship with Angelo by simply ignoring Angelo. Later on in adult life, Angelo and Nino reconnect and become more than friends and wind up being lovers who live together, but are closeted. Eventually, it comes out that they are gay lovers, and both Angelo's and Nino's parents are upset about this, and try to match them up with some girls. This is where history repeats itself, when Nino renounces his love/relationship with Angelo. And again, the reasons he does this is similar to what he did in high school; he did it to fit in and please others, his mother and peers. Nino dates this woman and eventually marries her and has a kid on the way. My heart went out to Angelo - both when Nino renounces his love for Angelo, and when you see Nino getting married. But I suppose in some ways, this is somewhat true to real life. The difference though in real life is that you typically see that there are guys who are gay, but don't realize or don't want to admit it. And when they are young, they get married to a woman and have kids, because that's what the social norms are. But then later on in life, that's when they realize they are gay and wind up having a divorce and finding a guy.

Ultimately, this is a good movie and is funny to watch and is entertaining.",1379203200,,2344,4.253363228699552
1204667,4,B00000F5B5,I guess I expected more given that it has a five star rating. I enjoyed the cultural interplay and the poking fun at Italian men who do not move out until they marry. Not 100% true but pretty close. There was some over acting on the part of the parents. I had a hard time identifying with Angelo or Nino.

There are some really hysterical lines in this movie, but in general I found the whole thing to have been done. Putting an Italian twist on it, was in theory a good idea, but the whole film just comes across as clich. The gay stereotypes are outdated and the other F word is thrown around way too much. If you're looking for an original ""gay"" comedy, watch Sascha Baron Cohen's Bruno, that was a great movie.

This a movie I can watch with family and friends whether they are Gay or straight, conservative or liberal because everyone loves a good laugh and a great story.

1204927,5,B00000F5B5,"A better-than-average ""gay-themed"" film, ""Mambo Italiano"" is one of the better movies that have come out in the last 10 years to explore gay issues in a comedic, lighthearted way. The plot is pretty simple: the story is about a Catholic/Italian family living in beautiful Montreal dealing with their son's recent outing as a homosexual. Although the plot plays like a comedy, the theme is serious in that we see how a religous and old-fashoned family comes to terms with their offspring's sexuality, a sexuality that is still hard for some families to come to terms with. I would suggest this film to anyone who is thinking about coming out of the closet, and I also suggest it to all families who are having a difficult time in accepting their child's homosexuality. What makes a person's gay life so hard for some parents is the fact that these parents have different opinions about a child's chosen path in life. What these parents need to do is to accept that homosexuality is not something one chooses and that in order for someone to be happy they must live their life honestly and openly even if it is against a father or mother's wishes. Mary Walsh, a popular comedian in Canada, steals the film as the mother of a gay cop. Her performance is campy, funny, and hilarious. The DVD is now, unfortunately, out-of-print, but there are a few copies available from private sellers. This is truely a forgotten film that we all should view. The movie has a special place in my DVD collection and I know you will enjoy it.",1257206400,4,1521,4.637037037037037

Paul Sorvino is perfect as the role of Angelo's dad,his accent was flawless and his movements and gestures were so natural. My favourite line was the part when the whole family incidentally finds themselves in confession at their church, none of them knowing that the other family members are present...and one by one they reveal to each other who is in the booth. When Paul Sorvino hears a female voice, and asks ""Who's that?"" his wife says ""Thats your daugher"" he replies ""Anna, have you seen my 'forza italia' hat? Your mother lost it on me again"". HAHAHAHAHA!!! If you come from ANY mediteranian descent, you will particularily relate to this film. Parts of it were sad, mainly the part of when Nino leaves Angelo...and Angelos face at that moment was just heartbreaking. But his character is adorable, and after all the  emotional pain he endures,manages to find a really nice guy in the end. I really love this film!",1208476800,2,1084,4.7967914438502675

After all, no one could do work this good without thoroughly enjoying it. And you will, too, I promise! In fact, I don't think I could name a funnier, more perfectly made movie with a gay theme in it, and I've seen them ALL, believe me.

The biggest surprise to me was how much the film could portray ethnic stereotypes so broadly, and maintain such a breakneck pace, without ever wearing out its welcome. Credit for this must go, most of all, to Paul Sorvino who plays the aggrieved father of the young man (whose Coming Out story this is) and Ginette Reno who portrays the mother. Watching the two of them together, pitching and trading their lines with such perfect, lightning fast timing was like seeing an excellent game of tennis, only with huge laughs!

My favorite scene in the whole film comes fairly late, when the parents receive, react to, and debate the best way to respond to the wedding invitation of one of the other characters. I think it was one of the funniest comic scenes I've ever seen in a movie, period--with or without gay subject matter. My very highest recommendations!",1202083200,2,1228,4.552036199095022

1205017,5,B00000F5B5,"I just really loved it.  Very funny.  I mean, not actual ""laughing out loud"" funny, but the kind of funny where you have a huge smile on your face throughout the whole movie.  The writing is very good.  Such clever writing.  Everything is right to the point.  That's also a compliment to director, mile Gaudreault.  The pace is so excellently directed that you lose all sense of time.  I just loved the plot.  It wasn't terribly predictable.  Like, I loved how our two lovers don't get together in the end.  THAT would have made it trite.

A point that I'm really glad the movie discussed is the ""man who is attracted to and wants to be with other men, but not interested in being honest about his life with anyone but his lover.""  That's what Nino is.  Angelo is much more interested in not living a lie, and that's who we come to respect in the movie.  It's clear that Nino is not interested in self-dignity, and that's who we feel sorry for.

I also really loved how we see a realistic and detailed view of the process Angelo's parents go through in learning to accept there son.  Gay children should show this movie to their parents if they're having trouble accepting their gay children.

The acting is also fabulous.  You have to be a very skilled actor to purposefully play a stereotype and at the same time, believe in your character so much that you make this character a real, truthful person that your audience can actually relate to.  Every actor does that.

A light, feel-good movie, is what it is.  As far as gay-themed movies go, my other recommendations are Big Eden, Come Undone, and Latter Days; although, this stands in a category of quality all on it's on.",1168473600,,1676,4.498338870431894

1205020,5,B00000F5B5,"I'm not going to review the plot... amazon provides a decent one. I'm just going to supply my thoughts on the film.

I first watched Mambo Italiano with my Sicilian mother and both of us almost fell off the couch laughing as we could relate to the characters because he Italian families featured in this film reminded us of our own Italian family... and Gino's mother is the classic Sicilian older woman (she's a lot like my aunts). The plot is out there but not far fetched. It really captures what growing up first generation Italian-American is all about (even though the film is Canadian). Just like My Big Fat Greek Wedding, you don't have to be of the culture (Italian, or GLBT) to understand the humor, you just have to be opened minded as it is a GLBT film. I've recommended it to many friends and all have thanked me profusely for the recommendation after they viewed it. But I might add, the film is filled with great one-liners that you might need to be Italian to understand.

Also, I think Paul Sorvino gives a great performance. He plays the father so well, it reminded me of my Roman father. All the characters are great, but Sorvino gives a very convincing performance albeit a comical one. When he says ""No one hates my job more than me!"" I fall over laughing because I can picture my own father saying that!

Whether you're Italian or not, this movie is a must have and I totally recommend picking it up and viewing it multiple times! It will not fail to make your stomach hurt from laughing.",1158019200,10,1510,4.483636363636363
1205040,4,B00000F5B5,"I loved this movie.  People say the acting by Angelo's parents (Paul Sorvino and quebecoise Ginette Reno) over the top.  Sorry people it wasn't, it was right on the money.  I have italian friends whose parents are very similar.  Another thing people don't realize was that Mambo Italiano started as a play here in Montreal (where  co-writer Steve Galluccio is from). It was on stage before My Big Fat Greek Wedding was made.  Not that Wedding isn't good, it's also a CANADIAN MOVIE.

Mambo is based loosely on Steve Galluccio's life growing up in Little Italy Montreal.  I never saw it on stage but waited impatiently for the movie to come out.  One of my favorite scenes is also when Angelo is set up by his parents, and he proceeds to belittle them for making him ashamed to be who he is.  All in all great movie.",1154390400,2,815,4.482993197278912

1205042,4,B00000F5B5,"Mambo Italiano is an enjoyable piece of sweet fluff.  While it is obvious that the makers of the film are riding on the coattails of the successful MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING the gay plot and different ending put an interesting spin of what many will consider a formula movie.  Well formula or not my partner and I really enjoyed it.

I think the reason this movie succeeds so well is because it isn't afraid to poke fun at itself.  For example, the over the top acting is superb, a good thing too because anything less would be ridiculous.

Not to be too frivilous there are a few serious moments, which add a nice depth to the story.  I particularly liked the scene where the Angelo character (Luke Kirby) asks his ex-lover Nino (Peter Miller) if he had ever loved him.  The reaction on Angelo's face to Nino's lame answer is skilled acting at its best.

Production wise there is no skimping like we sometimes see with other films of this genre.  The movie is crisp, clear and beautiful.  The public garden scenes are especially lush (practically makes you want to move to Canada).  If the production studio didn't drop a ton of money on Mambo Italiano then the director and camera people did a fantastic job making the film look like a big budget Hollywood comedy.  If a lot of $$$ was spent ... well they got their money's worth.",1137024000,3,1331,4.477178423236515

Absolutely brilliant performances by the actors, particularly the woman who plays the man's sister and tries to help him in a sort of psychiatric way.

Since I was bored, I found myself looking at other people there to see if I could get a read on what they were thinking, and after it was over I asked my friend what he thought. He said, ""Oh, it was okay"" but didn't elaborate. So let me: it was painfully unfunny, with jokes or punchlines that fell flat, horrible acting, totally predictable, and very forgetable. This is a movie you might want to rent ONLY if you're really bored and nearly every other movie is out. And even then, you'd be better off to go home empty handed. There's not even much eye candy to recommend, which is a nice fallback if there's nothing else going for it. How people could give this movie anything more than 1 star is puzzling. Just because you like a movie shouldn't mean you give it 5 stars, especially when it's as bad as this one. I mean, I liked Freddy VS Jason, but there's no way I'd give that movie 4 or 5 stars.

I started off enjoying this film. But I soon got annoyed with Angelo, and found this character quite difficult to like. I felt he pretty selfish, determined to have his way no matter what. When asked to do something selfless (such as work the gay hotline), he botches it. Instead of caring about his neurotic sister he seems more concerned with himself. Instead of being sensitive to his boyfriend Nino, he worries only about himself. Angelo seemed immature and annoying rather than someone that might make a good partner.. Bleh.

Nino is likewise no peach. After initiating a romance with Angelo he then procedes to cheat on him, later dumping him for a heterosexual romance. He never fully resolves his feelings for Angelo and this left me with a vague unsatisfied feeling.

I have seen better gay romantic comedies. Nino and Angelo just didn't have any chemistry and didn't work for me as a couple. 3 stars for a fairly average flick.

1205128,3,B00000F5B5,"Those who are from or have experience with the Italian melodramatic family system will probably appreciate this film.  Yes, the ethno-humor is a bit over the top but still manages to get a few laughs and remain cute. Cute and funny are the keywords here, as there's very little seriousness in the manner in which this movie depicts the ""coming out"" theme. It might be funny to see how the movie would work if it was set in South Philly or Mulberry St in NY's Little Italy. It's set in a small suburban Italian neighborhood of Montreal.

Much to his parent's dismay, the main character, Angelo (played by Luke Kirby), isn't interested in finding a 9-5 job with good security or a nice Italian girl to marry.  He also doesn't want to hang out in gay bars, march in the gay parade or even answer the phones for the gay hotline, but he does want to love someone and he wants his parents to know and accept who he really is.  He envisions a life very different than the one his parent's had and one which strays from the traditions in which he was raised.  He lives with his boyfriend and wants to write movies so you can just imagine the drama that ensues with ""La Famiglia"".

Paul Sorvino doesn't stray too far from his typecast as the Italian father, but his acting remains refreshing.  With the help of Ginette Reno (who plays the Italian mom), the parents create some humorous melodrama in the process of ""adapting"" to their son's coming out. A noteworthy performance is also given by Claudia Ferri who plays Angelo's neurotic but understanding sister.

Expect this movie to tackle the subject light-heartedly. It will give you a few laughs, while not being annoyingly thought provoking.",1106179200,,1687,4.618729096989966

Poor Angelo is gay, against his parents' every wish, and everyone in the world seems to know it but them.  Because this is a comedy, his bashing in high school is treated lightly, but you get the real sense that his life hasn't been easy.

Into his life falls Nino, his sometimes-friend in school and now a very hot cop.  They fall for each other and move in together. Angelo is deliriously happy, but Nino still clings to his comfortable closet. Their families make things worse.

I empathized with both Angelo and Nino and felt the characters were well developed.  Although I ultimately was disappointed in Nino (and surprised at his hard-heartedness) I can understand his choices.

Paul Sorvino is one of my favorite actors, and plays the father with great sincerity as well as humor.  Angelo's sister is captivating, if a little frustrating, and Nino's mother is wonderful too.

Great story, great characters, good pace.  The movie avoids being trite or preachy, and ends satisfyingly enough.

However I did take issue with the 'over the top"" dialogue and stereotyped performances given by the parents and some family members. Yeah yeah, I know.. It's supposed to be a comedy, but the laughter is few and far in-between. The relationship between the two gay male leads is interesting, in the fact that the cop character  suddenly chooses ""not"" to be gay anymore. This behavior is exacerbated by the constant derogatory remarks made by his police partner & disapproving mother who manipulates her son into believing what he really wants and who he really is, is heterosexual. He then proceeds to systematically alienate his lover by hiding behind a hetro-induced mentality. What prompts this erratic behavior is caused in part when his partner feels strongly about coming out of the closet. It's as if there are subversive undertones of Gay on Gay bashing. The mood of the film depicts a lot of shouting and self loathing, almost to the point of self destruction. Alas.. in true Hollywood fashion there is a plot twist that plays out as somewhat happily ever after. Wish this movie was so much more... but it's not.",1104624000,2,1273,4.657777777777778

Mambo is able to do what few gay movies choose to do:  get a point across in a humorous, light-hearted, genuine way.  You care about the main characters and relate to them.  It definitely has an agenda (which is not necessarily a bad thing) and focuses on the difficulty of coming out to family, friends, and self (which is overdone in gay cinema), but manages not to be over-powering, and can, at times, even be a little too much fluff.  Overall, though, it is a great, fun movie, if you simply want to be light hearted, enjoy a cute, lovable movie with your boy on a couch eating popcorn and snuggling on a rainy afternoon.",1104537600,2,898,4.58125

Directed by mile Gaudreault and written originally as a play by Steve Galluccio & mile Gaudreault, the film begins with Angelo's description of his childhood (the young Angelo played by Michael Romano) in which he and Nino (the young Nino played by Mathieu Major-Langevin) were best friends, but as they grew older, Nino spent increasingly less time with Angelo until he didn't want to be with Angelo at all.  It wasn't until both were adults that their paths crossed again: Angelo wanting to be a writer, but working as a phone-in travel agent, and Nino as a policeman.  To Angelo's surprise, Nino initiates a more intimate relationship than Angelo would have ever expected.  After the two move in together, Angelo wants to come out to his parents, Gino Barberini (Paul Sorvino) & Maria Barberini (Ginette Reno), and announce his relationship with Nino.  However, Nino, who fears being ostracized by his mother, Lina Paventi (Mary Walsh), and his fellow police officers, wants to keep their relationship a secret, as does Angelo's obsessive sister Anna Barberini (Claudia Ferri) who inadvertently discovers their relationship. Undeterred, after Angelo comes out to his parents, Nino moves back home with his mother and starts to date the obnoxious woman Pina Lunetti (Sophie Lorain) to the delight of his mother Lina, but to Angelo's dismay.  Will Gino & Maria be able to accept their gay son?  Will Angelo and Nino get back together, or will they move on with their lives?  Will Angelo aspire to being something greater than a phone-in travel agent?  You'll just have to watch this sometimes whimsical and always entertaining film to find out!

With an entertaining story & dialog, interesting characters and a good dose of humor, ""Mambo Italiano"" is a fun and engaging film to watch.  The most memorable acting came from Paul Sorvino, Ginette Reno, Mary Walsh and Claudia Ferri.  Other memorable characters include Angelo's Aunt Yolanda (Tara Nicodemo), Rosetta (Pierrette Robitaille), Giorgio (Dino Tavarone), Alicia (Ellen David), Raymond (Shaun Balbar), Steve (Matt Holland) and the woman seeking help (Lisa Bronwyn Moore).  Memorable scenes include Nino & Angelo's camping trip, Anna's frequent psychiatrist visits, the gay help line, Gino & Maria's discussions and the closing scenes.

I immedietly yelled out ""blasmphemy!"" They had no right to mention Fellini's name in such a horrible film. If they had said DeSica I would have started a fire in the theatre.

First off this is the most innacurate display of Italian culture I've ever seen in my life. It's so innacurate it becomes offensive to Italians. I think Paul Sorvino is the only actual Italian in the film. By the way he sucks. That guy cannot act. He was in Goodfellas. Big deal! Any middle aged Italian man would have fit that role perfeclty anyway. I got off topic. For those of you thinking that my opinion is bias cause I'm Italian the same thing go's for My Big Fat Greek Wedding. I felt the same way when I first saw that film.
In my opinion comedy is art and surrounding a lame plot with a bunch of cliched stereotypes for cheap laughs is not comedy. The comedic mind has evolved over the years. This movie does not keep up with the evolution of the comedic mind. This movie appeals to the comedic mind of an ape.

1205183,4,B00000F5B5,"Let's take 'Mambo Italiano' for what it's worth: a very enjoyable film stocked with a lot of laughs, but also poignant because there's no doubt that the tale has been pulled from the real life experiences of playright Steve Galluccio.
While leads Luke Kirby ('Angelo') and Peter Miller ('Nino') don't stand out in any way, it's Paul Sorvino and Ginette Reno as Angelo's parents who will stick with you.  Yes, as others have noted, these are highly stereotypical portrayals.  But it's Gaulluccio's life and *he* wrote the characters that way.  Obviously, he's played it up a bit, but that gives Reno (and especially) Sorvino big meaty roles that they can really sink their teeth into.  Watching Paul Sorvino is a treat.  He's the kind of guy who could read the phone book to you with panache.
I also completely loved Mark Camacho's over-the-top, hilariously profane take as TV exec Johnny Christofaro.  In a series of episodes that could again only have been drawn from playright Galluccio's real life experiences, the Christofaro character - in what can best to described as a series of 'friendly' profane explosions - rips into the writer, belittling his work, tearing down his confidence, but then finishing his tirade every time with an upbeat, sincere ""How's your Mom?""  Once Angelo hits the big time, there's Christofaro on an interview show in a classic exchange, remembering how he always encouraged Angelo to 'never give up' (replete with a series of now characteristic F bombs).  Nothing could be further from the truth of course, which is what makes it so funny.  Great writing.
A hidden gem:  look for Galluccio appearing as 'himself' (in a way) - he's the 'TV version' of Angelo in the sitcom-within-the-movie.",1086825600,4,1722,4.968641114982578

Flash forward fifteen years. Not much has changed. Angelo is trapped in a dead-end job while he secretly longs to be a television writer. He still lives at home with his overprotective, traditional Italian family, where you're expected to stay home until you get married. The only problem is, Angelo is a closeted gay man and he doesn't want to get married. He shocks his parents by moving out into an apartment of his own. That's when fate steps in. His apartment is vandalized and who should be the responding officer but Angelo's childhood friend Nino? They renew their friendship and it turns out that Nino is closeted as well. The two men embark on a secret romance, but soon Angelo finds himself longing to come out. Nino adamantly refuses to come out for fear of his job and interfering mother.
When Angelo finally comes out to his family all hell breaks loose. His strict Catholic parents can't accept it and stop speaking to him, his sister is driven into counseling to deal with their dysfunctional family, and Nino can't handle the pressure. Can Angelo and Nino make their relationship work? Will Angelo's parents ever accept him? Can they all find happiness?

(Canada - 2003)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Digital

Tired of living in denial, an aspiring gay writer (Luke Kirby) comes out to his hyper-emotional Italian parents (Paul Sorvino and Ginette Reno), causing a rift with his deeply closeted boyfriend (Peter Miller) who feels compelled to reassert his masculinity. With a woman...

Directed by Emile Gaudreault, who co-wrote the script with Steve Galluccio based on the latter's stageplay, MAMBO ITALIANO has all the verve and panache of a 1930's screwball comedy, complete with quickfire dialogue and finely-judged comic performances. Not being Italian, this reviewer isn't in a position to judge whether the OTT characters are stereotypes or just witty send-ups, a comic exaggeration of reality, but industry vet Sorvino and legendary French-language chanteuse Reno steal the show as Kirby's constantly bickering parents, prone to making wild dramas out of the smallest problems, which has the unfortunate side-effect of making Kirby himself seem a little too laidback in comparison.

The narrative seems aimless at times, veering between comedy and drama and all points in between, but there are plenty of distractions along the way, including Claudia Ferri as Kirby's therapy-addicted sister, Mary Walsh as Miller's scheming mama, and Miller himself, a gorgeous grade-A hunk of the highest order, around whom much of the plot revolves. It's pretty superficial overall, and mainstream gay cinema needs another romantic comedy like HALLOWEEN needs another sequel, but MAMBO ITALIANO does much to ingratiate itself with the broadest possible audience, though the unconventional 'happy' ending may undermine the experience for some viewers. Cinematographer Serge Ladouceur employs a vivid color scheme which lights up the screen throughout, but the compositions are fairly unadventurous, and the movie plays better on TV than it probably did in theaters.",1079654400,,1940,5.63013698630137

Whenever his father wanted to DO something, his mother will speak about the downsides of it and show fearsome so that they ended up doing nothing for protest, but also left all their displeasure inside their own stomachs for digestion(the same way for Angelo's coming-out, for they pretending to claim that being gay is no more normal than it should be to the outside world).
 This way of showing total acceptance to family member's beings, no matter loves or hurting that they clearly couldn't stand as old-traditioned parents, and continuously being  in conjunction with their children and keeping nurturing them regardless of the negative emotions flying within the family, is because they wanted to keep the family as a whole and conformity in front of the other's eyes. It is this type of love or irrationality what troubles Angelo's heart most and made him struggling between his heart and his family to make tough decisions to fit into this ""real world"" that the masculine force plays roles. However, as Angelo succeeded, he not only succeeded himself but also his whole family, and this is maybe the family effect I think.(as I haven't been able to watch till the end of this movie for it was blank screen for some reason) As this movie truly evokes so much same feelings and memories of families to even a different culture, I think this is really a worth-watching family comedy.",1513987200,,2265,5.034666666666666

This just had some joyfulness and realness to it, that I just really enjoyed. I don't know if I'm allowed to offer this perspective, because I'm not Italian nor am I gay and I'm also a woman. So, for me to watch this movie about gay men was wonderful delight. I personally love gay men.... they bring beautiful joyful life to my everyday being. And to think that there still may be people who harbor such dark feelings about gay men is heartbreaking. All I know is some of my very best and closest friends have been gay men.
 I always love watching a light film that celebrates these amazing, wonderfully, beautiful people I know. I actually have better feelings about these wonderful men than I do about any of my bitchy neighbors!  Bitchy neighbors, away with you!!
VERY nice movie!",1495065600,,905,4.512195121951219

Just a rehash of movies I have seen before, only a different culture and the twist is, the main character is gay.  Big deal.  I got through 33 minutes of this drudgery before shutting it off.  YAWWWWWNNN!!!",1491696000,,345,4.3125
