The movie came quickly and it was the perfect gift for the Lords of Dogtown fan-",1357344000,,208,4.225
4129605,4,B003JHXS7I,"For a mainstream 1970's flick, SKATEBOARD grasps firmly onto the exploitation style of spontaneous direction, freestyle dialog, and capricious plotline. And although billed as a Leif Garret vehicle, the bulk belongs to character-actor Allen Garfield as a tubby, struggling talent agent who owes big bucks to a dangerous bookie so, after discovering a group of wayward teenage skateboarders, Manny starts a hopeful team that travels in a decapitated bus doing borderline minstrel shows disguised as freestyle competitions.

While Garrett meanders in the background as one of the younger skaters, too shy to really take chances, the true hotshots are real life rollers Richard Van der Wyk, Tony Alva and Ellen O'Neal. And while the trio skate better than act, there's something genuine in the wooden deliveries: after all, it's their territory more than Garfield who, with a constantly frantic bicker, seems more part of a low-rent gangster flick than skateboarding propaganda: which this needed more action shots of.

But Manny's a likable antihero, especially after Kathleen Lloyd joins the ranks as the chaperone/nurse. Although scenes where Manny attempts talking ingnue Pam Kenneally from sleeping with Van der Wyk seem a bit creepy, he eventually becomes the endearing sloppy uncle as the team climbs to the final competition where - after the star skater drops out - it's up to underdog Garrett to win a do-or-die downhill race, which has more suspense in the buildup than the real thing. As for the DVD, the picture and sound is awesome! A must buy! [For More Reviews visit [...]]",1327881600,,1586,5.19140625
4129606,5,B003JHXS7I,"I saw this movie when it first came out in the 70s.  It was a great movie then!  The acting is ok but the tricks they used to do back then were awesome and drew a lot of discussion between me and my boys!  My boys were calling ""wheelies"" that they were doing in the movie, ""manuals"".  I told them that these were the ones that paved the way for all skateboarding to come!  They were the pioneers!  They are called ""wheelies""!  Tom Sims of Sims Skateboards is also in the movie.  Tony Alva is in it too.  So is the 70s teenage hearthrob, Leif Garrett.  It was a great movie to watch with my boys!

It took a few weeks to arrive and as soon as I got it, I went straight home, sat my boys down, and watched it!  It brings back memories of when a skateboard park WAS a skateboard park!  A lot of the footage was filmed where I used to live in the valley of southern California.  Skatercross where they did some filming, was located in Reseda which was right by Canoga Park where I lived.  I never had the chance to go skate there because we left the valley but I did go there and check it out from the outside.  I really miss that place!  I am going to try to put this movie on DVD and eventually on my computer to preserve it!  VHS tapes don't last too long.  I was suprised this one lasted as long as it did!  Thanks!",1324944000,,1315,4.003861003861004
4129607,3,B003JHXS7I,"I purchased this at my local by-the-pound Goodwill ""Bins"" outlet. There were a probably 100+ VHS videos but this was the only good one. It was underneath several hundred  books at least. My copy has a white clamshell case, the cover insert is a 9x11"" thick piece of paper, different than the picture on here. It's a very clear copy. No problem with the sound and the movie itself is on par with a regular DVD. Really nice find because I thought being so old it must have been a rental played a thousand+ times!

The date on the video cassette is written in Roman numerals, I thought it was 1987 but it's actually 1977! The birth of punk rock! The film is by Vista and Universal. It should be out on DVD/Blu Ray now since it's in Uiversal's catalog but for some reason it's not. It's a pretty good film so I don't know why Universal wouldn't release it.

Not a bad movie. The story isn't exceptional but it's very believeable and the skateboarding tricks are pretty nice to watch. I've never been into skateboarding but I believe some of the basic tricks in the film may date back to the 1950's. Tony Alva still skates today which is neat and I know Leif for better or worse from those home video shows on Tru TV with Danny Bonaduce, Tonya Harding.

Pick this up if you can get it for $2-3 dollars. It's not a great 1970's exploitation film, bottom of the rank as far as that goes if you're judging against true classic but it's something different and skateboard people or folks who like random 1970's pictures they've never heard of or do not know would probably enjoy it. Probably not many skateboarding films from this period so grab it if you see it.  It made me laugh and smile and the acting is pretty good. If I was a kid and had gone to this movie I know I would have liked it!

Thumbs up! 3/5 stars. Obviously the film has a lot of filler skateboarding scenes and lacks a true engaging story but it's still pretty good and light fun fare for an afternoon or evening with nothing to do.",1307750400,6,1994,4.318181818181818
4129608,3,B003JHXS7I,"In my quest to find unusual cult and camp movies from years gone by I stumbled on this gem capitalizing on the then-rising fad of skateboarding and Leif Garrett's blossoming teen-idol career, and it is a hilarious if painful mixed-genre low-budget monstrosity that could have only been made in the 1970's. The story involves lots of hormonally explosive teens who form a skateboarding team to save unlikely leading man Manny Bloom (Allen Garfield) from death at the hands of mobster bookie Sol (Anthony Carbone.) A side note: for those of you who are familiar with ""The Mighty Boosh,"" Garfield has an uncanny resemblance to the character of Bob Fossil, especially during the outdoor dining scene with his hair blown asunder. This thought gave me no end of amusement.

The team of skateboarders Bloom assembles are quite the ragtag bunch, fronted by genuine skateboarding legend Tony Alva as Tony Bluetile. Obviously Garrett (as Brad Harris) as the teen heartthrob is front and center, and given the material acquits himself perfectly adequately. In the commentary Alva revealed that Garrett learned to skate for the film, and in that regard, particularly given the focus on his character, I thought he was better than expected. Of course the film has ridiculous drama, even more ridiculous romance, a multi-colored school bus full of kids (where have I seen that before?), and a life or death conclusion where Sol commands Bloom to have Harris to take a dive. When Bloom refuses out of respect for his skateboarders (!) he knows that if Leif doesn't cinch the one mile downhill race he is a dead man. I won't spoil the fun of watching it for yourself to discover how it ends up.

The film is an odd little production featuring guest stars like Gordon Jump (WKRP's Arthur Carlson) as Leif's father, and from the really weird department, Orson Bean as himself. I also recommend watching the closing credits carefully for some humorous credits (if you can stand the incessant 1970's soundtrack.) Most amusingly to me was the Public Service Announcement at the very end of the film claiming that these stunts are extremely dangerous and not to try them without proper gear, etc. The DVD is much more ornate that you would expect as it has a commentary track with director George Gage and Tony Alva, which is modestly interesting (there's even a very brief lesson on the irrigation of Phoenix courtesy of Alva!) There are also additional interviews with George Gage and Tony Alva. (I found Alva to be more interesting.) The original theatrical trailer is also included, and it is hilarious in an overblown 1970's way.

""Skateboard"" is not a good movie in the conventional sense, but it is entertaining as a camp classic. For those into skateboarding, 1970's culture, or B-movies this is a little-known gem of eye-rolling quality.",1285632000,7,2824,4.941052631578947
4129609,3,B003JHXS7I,"Skateboard (Skateboard: The Movie) (1978) is a very bad film of the 70's skating scene, including skateboarding chump Tony Alva.

The best sequence was the teen pin-up puke queen Leif Garrett at the skateboarding championships that contrasted the original skateboarding style with that of late 1980's skateboarding.

This 70's exploitation film represents a then unprecedented look at the birth of an exploitative counter-culture that unfolds right before your despicable eyes.

4129613,3,B003JHXS7I,"Now the GREAT THING about this film is that every great skater of the 1970's is in it, Tony Alva, Ellen O'Neal, Jay Adams, Robin Logan, Brad Logan, Laura Thornhill, Bruce Logan, Ellen Berryman, etc., and they are the film, the plot is terrible, the addition of Leif Garrett still makes me puke to this day, personally I think the skaters probably all made fun of him as he was a wimp --- Only put in it so 12 year old girls would go see it --- I was there for Alva, O'Neal & The Logan's --- and for them to me it's a gem --- knock Leif out of the movie I raise it to 4 stars --- The pretty girl that was having sex with Richard Van Der Wyk was cool too ---",1412121600,,656,3.8666666666666667
4129614,4,B003JHXS7I,"Skateboard The Movie is a great look at the late 70's skateboard craze. The movie is shot in a raw style with real professional skaters mixed into the cast of actors. Just like the Bad News Bears before it, Skateboard features a group of kids touring around hitting skate contests and trying to make a name for themselves. It's a lighthearted movie that's fairly safe for family viewing and it features some great retro music, California settings, classic tricks and superfly 70's clothing. Definately worth a watch if you've ever been into the skate scene.",1410307200,2,557,4.873684210526315

4129617,5,B003JHXS7I,"First of all, this movie was never meant to be a masterpiece, or win a grammy for best picture. But, it was a movie made for the time period. Skateboarding was very popular back then, and I should know, like alot of us who grew up during the time era, I skated, and skated hard, everyday, and loved it. I remember seeing the trailor for Skateboading in the movie theater before it came out, and thought to myself, I had to see this movie. Sure, seeing it now, it seems cheezy, or whatever you want to call it, the dialogue is cheezy, the acting is cheezy, the dress code is cheezy, but we have to remember what time period it was, it was the 70's, and it was all appropriate for its time. I bought the vhs tape of this movie a while back, but like alot of you, I don't have a vhs player anymore. VHS is obsolete, so I cannot play it anymore, and missed seeing it. I was glad to see this movie out on dvd now. I had to order it.",1383868800,2,927,4.0162162162162165

4129619,4,B003JHXS7I,"The only reason I even had a skateboard in the '70s was because Leif Garrett was in this movie!  It's a campy movie about a good natured guy who's down on his luck and owes money to a loan shark/mob guy.  He stumbles across a group of kids doing tricks on their skateboards and has a revelation for his next big idea.  He borrows more money, takes them on the road for local competitions and fun & drama ensue.  It's a cute movie, very dated but still cute.  If you love the '70s and all the raves that the decade spawned (Roller Boogie, anyone?), then you'll like it, but it's definitely not a well acted movie so don't expect too much.  Leif Garrett ends up being the hero at the end of the movie, which to this sappy old '70s teen idol fan/goofball, was good enough for me!",1380672000,,776,4.20945945945946
8398114,2,B003JHXS7I,"This movie takes the burgeoning late '70s trend of skateboarding and uses the Bad News Bears model. One shouldn't watch movies like this now for quality, but for a look back. It is barely tolerable for that. Allen Garfield's sleazy slob of a character runs his mouth entirely too much, barking at kids, repeating himself and it quickly becomes annoying. The soundtrack consists of stale music - a modern version set in this time period would use well-known songs, but like most movies produced at the time, they had low budgets and found people who would produce generic, forgettable and often cringe-inducing music.",1528502400,,616,4.990291262135922
8398115,3,B003JHXS7I,It is exactly what you expect it to be. If people rated it one they must be expecting something else which is stupid. It's a cheesy feel good movie with real kids in a story about building a skateboarding team from the 70s,1526601600,,222,4.186046511627907
8398116,4,B003JHXS7I,"These aren't actors, these are real skater kids, so yes, the acting isn't always top notch, but that's why they hired Leif Garrett.  The main actor, David Bloom, is cracking me up with his avoidance of the ex wife trying to collect her alimony and his beat up car.  It's actually in a similar vein with washed up main character/actor films like Bad News Bears,  Tootsie and Swingers - but an even lower budget than Swingers.  The camera work is uneven at times, but the skateboard stunts are cool.  And Leif Garrett as a skate rat is somehow really amusing - impressively, he did some of his own stunts - it was that low of a budget..  And I'm sure this film somehow led up to the true teen classics of the 1980s.  And yes, there was most certainly billboarding of brands.  One of the kids wearing his Nike sneakers, Pepsi gets a mention, and there was a sign for Wham-o Frisbee which was a popular SC brand of toys - etc, etc.  And it was pretty funny that the guy said something about a joint music.skateboarding tour - isn't that what Vans is all about now?  If you want a movie that gives more love to the 70s, check out The Runaways or Spirit of 76.  It's interesting to see a time before skaters had a local park hangout, and they were sneaking into empty pools.",1469491200,2,1268,4.30801687763713
