8125240,5,B000FP2YR2,A beautiful and intriguing look at San Francisco combined with two very interesting stories told with a great voice-over by Harriet Dodge.  The work is visually contemplative as well as intellectually engaging.  Just be prepared to relax and take your time with it.,1435363200,,265,5.1395348837209305
8125241,2,B000FP2YR2,"Thoroughly enjoyed the half about the Golden Gate Bridge.  Really unbelievable.  Eye opening, I had never heard anything like that about the bridge before.
The half about her relationships and living in her city, not so much.  The style showing scenes from all over the area were great at first, but then started to feel like a slide show.  Slow paced, could have used a little more creativity.  Overall, would not recommend.  Too dry and artsy to be considered a documentary.",1326758400,,476,4.814814814814815
