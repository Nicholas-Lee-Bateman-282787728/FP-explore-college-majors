As much as I was anticipating something more, what's basically included is a relatively quick run thru of Joel Whitburn's Billboard Record Archive. The DVD itself plays straight through with no menu choices, much like a VHS. At the end, there's a sit-down interview with Joel, discussing how the collection all began. I actually found this the best part of the DVD.

The Archive itself boasts EVERY recording to have Charted in Billboard Magazine since about 1940. Every Music format, Every genre. 45's, 78's, LP's, Audio Cassettes, Video Cassttes, CD's, CD singles, they're ALL there! ...And THEN SOME (Most of the Charted records going back to the 1920's)!! The main problem I had was that you mostly saw the drawers and shelves of records rather than the specific records themselves (yes, there were occasional or quick glimpses). I think you'd have to visit the Archive yourself to really appreciate it.

If I recall correctly, sometime in the 1970's I remember hearing that Joel was offered a Million Dollars(!) for the collection and he turned it down. And that was for what he only had 30 years ago!

If you want to see some of the rarest items in recorded music, this really isn't the way to go. If you're willing to settle for hearing Joel's background and how he got started with it all, then this IS the way to go. It's your choice.",1157760000,4,1401,4.710204081632653
