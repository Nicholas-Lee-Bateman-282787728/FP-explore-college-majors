5495396,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"READ THE BOOK & SKIP THE MOVIE! Tom Cruise cast as Jack Reacher? Unbelievable! Totally unbelievable! I can't imagine what the casting director was thinking. Of all the actors who could have played the part of Reacher as created by author, Lee Child (""One Shot""), Tom Cruise was the best Marin could do? Since Cruise is the 'main' producer (even though not listed here), guess there was no other choice. What a shame!",1356048000,3,416,4.712328767123288

5495403,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"Far cry from the book. And, Reacher is supposed to be over 6'3"" if I am not mistaken, and very strong. Little Tom Cruise physique is a gross mismatch.",1528934400,,150,4.206896551724138

5495407,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I've been reading the Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child for many, many years now. They are wonderful to say the least. When I first heard that they were now a movie I was very excited to see them. Then I found out that Tom Cruise was playing Jack ... not so much. The Jack Reacher in the novels is 6' 5"" tall and weighs 250lbs (think Dolph Lundgren)...hmmm ... how was Tom Cruise gonna pull this off, He kind of did ... sort of. The author, Lee Child, does have a cameo as a cop in the evidence lock up so I guess if HE's OK with it that's good enough for me. Entertaining movie ... even if Cruise is 10"" shorter than his character. 4 stars for that. LOL",1528070400,,653,3.9923664122137406

5495409,2,B00AS1Q8FW,Terrible acting.  That bar scene--cringe worthy.  The fight?  Ridiculously implausible.  Very little action or substance.  Worst TC movie,1527724800,,137,6.388888888888889

5495414,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I love it. They manage to hold the plot in the moment, but also be interesting overall. Jack is a great character, I don't know the books, but he makes a excellent modern 'lone ranger'. He wanders into trouble, saves the day, and moves on.",1525564800,,239,4.333333333333333

5495419,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Tom Cruise is not who I pictured Jack Reacher to be.  But he manages to pull it off.  The spirit of the stories is preserved.,1524960000,,125,3.96
5495420,3,B00AS1Q8FW,Its a Tom Cruise action thriller so what do you say. It has all of the elements youd want a movie like this to have. Ive watched this movie several times and I still like it. The acting isn't stellar but its still a good movie,1524700800,,226,3.9347826086956523
5495421,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Not my favorite, but up there in the top ten percent.

5495448,1,B00AS1Q8FW,An absolute travesty casting Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher!  What a disappointing adaptation of a novel character/series.  I guess they wanted a big star but I still can't for the life of me figure out how they ended up with Cruise and adapted Reacher into a totally different character from the books to try and make it work. It didn't.,1522108800,,334,4.55

5495455,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"I ordered this in the $2.99 version, as I do with all of the movies, and it was such a low resolution that it was unwatchable. The other problem is that I have spent a half hour on the Amazon site trying to tell someone and try to get a refund, and there is no way that I can find to do that. I give up. I wonder if they are doing that for the upgrade.",1521331200,,352,3.6447368421052633

5495473,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"The video was better than the rating indicates, but we felt cheatred by the purchase.  The reason was that we only wanted to livestream the movie, because we had a family member that wished to view it together with us, and had only a day left in his stay.  In the review jof the movie there was the usual statement ""How do we watch this?"", which stated that if you purchase it, it could be viewed as streaming video.  This was not the case!  He left before the video arrived in the mail and we are left with the video we really didn't want (we had already viewed the video, courtesy of our local library.",1519689600,,604,4.226086956521739

Quick Story Recap: A former soldier is facing charges for murdering 5 innocent people, Jack Reacher is a former military cop there to investigate.

Acting was good; Tom Cruise at times channels a 50s no nonsense tv cop, it seems to work though.  Rosamond Pike, while I have loved her in other films, does good for the most part here, I thought at times she was trying too hard to make a scene dramatic.  Duval!  I just loved that the few minutes he had, were money when he was on.

Overall, it's an action crime mystery that is enjoyable to watch.  It does deliver a decent thrilling action sequence toward the last act.  As mentioned, I loved Duvall, man he really adds to the movie.  There were a few things that took the film down a few notches for me.  First  I didn't like the top boss villain.  He just seemed to be too cardboard, I'm a typical bad guy to be feared type guy.  I thought his backstory of how he lost fingers was too much (I laughed because it seemed so ridiculous - almost parody like - not just one hand but both, really?)  But the backstory seemed like the writing team's pen's practically showing on the screen.  Second, the ""three stooges"" inspired moments out of the two goons fighting Cruise in the bathroom with a baseball bat and crow bar....at first I couldn't tell if they were on the same side, then it was obvious, they really did try to walk in the door at the same time and accidentally hit each other, I mean, please - he kicked the crap out of five of them in the alley before,  The movie did not need to make these two go ""full retard"" in order to make it believable Reacher would survive their assault.  Next item, the played up ""sexual chemistry"" between Cruise and Pike's character.  There are a few scenes where chemistry isn't there but they force it to be there. Most noticeable in the scene where she hands him a note about the lead he asked for - the way they staged it and how close she gets and how she hands him the note, all appeared to be forced and not believable.  Also, not really a spoiler alert but kinda if you want to know nothing before watching,  nothing comes of their flirtations so it all feels like why put it in there?  Typically films introduce things and then they find a means to use them, but nothing comes of a knife given to Reacher late in the film also.

  I didn't like the part how the car tailing Reacher (Cruise) is so obvious in that scene they look out the window.  The car sitting across the street in plain view sitting under a street light, how could you not notice this car.  It was so dumb, the villains were like ""oh no, we have been discovered!"" haha,

But it's ok.  I didn't hate it, I could watch it again if I was with someone who hadn't seen it before, but I won't go out of my way to visit this film again.",1515369600,,3074,4.26643598615917

5495596,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I saw this in the theatre originally & didn't think it was that great, but I have returned to it & grown to admire this film's charm.  Tom Cruise plays an ex-Army investigator turned into a ""hobbyist"" shadow, living a romantic vision of American independence.  When 5 random people are gunned down in broad daylight, an ex-Army sniper is accused with overwhelming evidence within 24 hrs - he is given the choice, confess or face the death sentence.  Innocent, the accused killer asks for Jack Reacher & says nothing further - but, the two may know each other, it certainly isn't based on a friendly encounter during service; the accused killer has his own demons & Reacher knows exactly what he is capable of doing.

After seeing the killings on the news and recognizing his former acquaintance, Reacher orchestrates an appearance out of seemingly thin air - his intent is to bury the ex-sniper.  However, the district attorney's daughter believes the courts are favoring unfair practices & denying those accused of crimes due process - she is able to convince Reacher to help as her lead investigator.  Soon Reacher becomes a target by thugs seemingly everywhere he goes - each time he swiftly thwarts attempts to get him off the case.  It becomes clear to Reacher there is something much more sinister happening involving, perhaps, even the district attorney himself.

The film plots a smooth escalation of intensity as the mystery unfolds.  Tom Cruise is the unbeatable stereotype, but with intelligent writing, I think it works.  Appearances are made by Robert Duvall, a grizzled ex-Marine sharpshooter and gun-range owner - after the standard Army-Marine banter, Duvall agrees to help Reacher.  The real treat is the antagonist of the film - played expertly by famed Director Werner Herzog (if you are unfamiliar with him, he is a brilliant filmmaker and can be hilarious with his deadpan German delivery - e.g., The Grand (2008) - or disturbingly psychotic as he is in Jack Reacher).

The film has all the elements of a true American action/thriller - dubious cops, expert-level veterans, muscle cars, chase scenes, hand-to-hand combat, guns, grizzled old men, lowly street thugs, cute girls, the wrongfully accused, and a German playing a Russian lunatic.  It has all the elements to be utterly cliche, but the story is smart and compelling and the casting is on target preventing Jack Reacher from being a mere spectacle.  It's a great film & I am glad I gave it a second chance - I think it's definitely worth a viewing.",1506211200,5,2529,4.92

So I know some people have a problem with him being cast.  But I don't think anybody could have done it as well as he did.  The story starts off with a sniper killing five people.  And as the story goes along.  There is more to it.  And the five victems are tied together.  Probably my favorite scene is when he meets a girl in a club and what happens after that.  This is one of the best action movies I have seen in awhile.  I haven't seen the second movie yet.  but I want to.,1495497600,,619,3.903225806451613

5495695,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"I want to say that this movie was awful from beginning to end, but I only made it to the halfway point and could not take it anymore.

This movie is one long lecture about how women can be soldiers and tough like men.  The script sounds like it was written by some feminists who just finished a book on how girls can do science.  At first I thought this movie was a joke, a parody of Star Ship Troopers or GI Jane or something.  But no.  This is serious feminist stuff as if it were the 1990s again.

And then there are all these weird running scenes, where the two main characters run as fast as they can, not necessarily to escape the bad guys, but for no reason at all.  If you thought the running movie disappeared in the 1980s, well, it's back.

I feel really sorry for Tom Cruise that his career ended this way.

[Note:  My wife is a big fan of Lee Child novels.  During the movie, she kept shouting, ""That's not in the book!""  I told her to calm down.  I was not blaming this awful movie on Lee Child.]",1494374400,,1009,4.086734693877551

5495771,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"There have been plenty of cinematic detectives private and public in film history but Jack Reacher in the film under review, Jack Reacher, is an odd-ball combination of drifter, military cop, information analyst and mad monk human weapon. Tom Cruise, a familiar action actor (Mission Impossible film series for one), plays the role to the hilt and naturally gets whatever job he had to accomplish and then drift (to resurface again recently as Jack Reacher II).

Heres his task. A fellow former Iraq War soldier, MOS, sniper, James Barr is accused of a mass murder of several people in Pittsburgh and before going into a coma asks for Jack to come and help him out of the frame he was in. (Jack served as a MP investigator in Iraq himself and had investigated Barr for some civilian murders which were swept under the rug by the brass during his service time.) Of course Barr did not know he was being framed, though he might have done it since he had an itchy trigger finger. Jack thought so too based on that war time criminal activity. Jack wanted to see him take the big step off, the death penalty but something kept sticking in Jacks craw about why someone whom he hated would call on his services.

So out of the boonies of America Jack comes to see what is what. And what is what starts with checking in with Barrs defense attorney whose only hope at that point was to keep her client out of the big step-off. Seemed hopeless until Jack put his relentless investigative skills together after he was hired by the lawyer to be her lead investigator in order to have full access to the evidence. Once he saw that evidence, put the crime scene together, made some connections that led toward the murder spree not been random acts, he had that funny feeling that something had been staged. Something had been set up because knowing Barr who was an average sniper at best the whole thing smelled funny. And it was as the facts became clear that there was an ulterior motive working to have Barr be the patsy, Jacks word, in some nefarious scheme. That, and the fact that Jack was being pursued everywhere he went by some rough customers, some life-takers. So naturally until we get near the end Jack has to not only use his powerful analytical skills but his physical ones as well (and his nerves of steel in a hopped car chase). Not to worry the miscreants are brought to justice, rough justice when the deal went down. The motive for setting up Barr up? See the film for that. As for Jack well you know his just drifted off into the hobo sunset.",1490140800,,2549,4.503239740820734
5495772,3,B00AS1Q8FW,This movie could have been better executed with more action and not so much talk. The story line is good but definitely not enough action.  Its okay for a rainy afternoon.,1490054400,,171,4.516129032258065

I'm not sure which present day actor would be the best for the part, but Clint Walker in his prime would've been great.

He travels the country by Greyhound bus and stays in cheap hotels.

Reacher is asked to investigate a mass shooting. The accused is a former army sniper that Reacher knew in Iraq. He discovers more than he bargained for. Tom Cruise is very good and likable as Reacher. It is a crime film with plenty of action. The rest of the cast is excellent.",1486944000,4,682,4.5

Too often my experiences with these movies ended in disappointment - so much so I no longer watch movies with Cruise.  This one is worth the $4 rental and we will likely follow it up with the sequel Reacher. The story was smart, Cruise played the character within himself and did so convincingly. The level  of predictability was there but not too much. The story did have a few surprises and the revelations came well timed. It's a good flick worth the time to watch.",1485648000,,609,4.5181818181818185

The mistake I made was trying to watch it on a night I was exhausted and quickly fell asleep.  Naturally, I associated the movie with boring, since I fell asleep.  Years later when another Jack Reacher movie was being released, I decided to watch the 1st again, so as not to be lost in stories/plot lines of the second movie.

I was amazed!  This was not the boring movie I remembered it to me.  It's a great action movie that keeps you entertained, although, I found the ending fairly predictable, but I find that to be the case with most movies.  Tom Cruise, while getting older, still manages to keep you entertained through the action packed sequences throughout the movie.",1484092800,22,764,4.532846715328467

5496038,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I have never read a Reacher book, so the complaint about the actors size is irrelevant to me.
The thing I like about the movie - was the character Reacher.  He is pretty original in many ways.  Reacher has done something that others might wish that they could do - disconnect themselves from the madness of our modern civilized society and going their own way.
For example -- Reacher owns nothing (home, car), he disdains communication (no phone, email, etc), he has no family or friends & does not seem to want any.  He is a throw back to an earlier time - like a mountain man in the old West or medieval wanderer - who rarely has any contact with other people ----- a true misanthrope.  About the only thing that interests him - puzzles - like solving a who-done-it, especially the ones that no one else can seem to fathom.  Like a modern Sherlock Holmes.
The story is very well done and moves along at nice pace.  The fight scenes are excellent and well choreographed.
Such an intriguing character is what makes this movie more interesting than many others of similar type.",1482969600,,1076,4.520618556701031
5496039,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Reacher is always great,even with 5'7"" Tom Cruise.  He does have the attitude, as Lee Child said.",1482969600,,97,4.705882352941177

5496152,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"As others have noted, Tom Cruise does not look like the six foot four Jack Reacher, but this aside, Tom Cruise does an excellent job in this film. The writer of the movie drama created a good story and Cruise acts in it very well, as do the other actors.
The plot begins when a sniper kills some people, men and women, making it seem like a random serial killing. Although he wears gloves, he leaves a quarter in a machine with another man's finger print and other signs that indicate that this other man is the shooter. The man whose finger print is left is arrested. He asks the police, ""Get me Jack Reacher."" We do not know why. While being transported to jail, he is beaten by other prisoners and is in a coma. Reacher comes, and someone tries to kill him. Other people involved in the matter are killed.",1479859200,,808,4.322368421052632

I thought both Rosamund Pike and Tom Cruise did their best performances. The facial expressions and body language of both really enhanced the mood of each scene.

If you have never acted on stage you might not appreciate the time and effort it takes to rehearse and try out different looks in front of a mirror. The actor is trying to convey an supporting visual to how he says his lines.",1477958400,,563,4.63

While this first film offers nothing new in the way of cinematic entertainment, it stands as a solid action outing led by yet another charismatic, driven performance by Tom Cruise. One-liners help to even out the tone amidst an otherwise dark military thriller. I haven't read any of Lee Child's books that feature the titular character, but following this and the sequel, I think I may have to give them a shot.",1477526400,,508,4.784090909090909

although I felt Cruise tried hard to depict Reacher, it just didn't work for me. Not just height and weight, Cruise has a bit if a baby face, reading the books I had an impression of a almost cruel faced man.
The story is changed up significantly from the book, enough was left out that it wasn't clear why things were happening.

5496459,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"Lee Child is a wonderful author.  The character Jack Reacher is a tough, no-nonsense SOB who scares the heck out of me.  Unfortunately, Tom Cruise is NO Jack Reacher.  I find this horrible miscasting to be a huge detriment. Tom Cruise could not intimidate my grandmother.  So I have to laugh at the parts where he (Cruise) tries to be a tough guy.  His scowl, which is supposed to be intimidating,. just makes me laugh and want to bitch-slap the little twerp.  Just not believable.  Jack Reacher is 6'5"".  Tom Cruise is 5 foot nothing.
Tom Cruise is a good actor for certain roles.  This is not one of them.  He's just NOT intimidating.
This is a waste of time and effort.
The people that like this movie are Tom Cruise fans, not Jack Reacher fans.
Better casting would have been Dolph Lundgren, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Jason Statham would have all been much better choices.  They can be intimidating.
If you like Tom Cruise, you'll like the movie.  If you like Jack Reacher, you'll either hate the movie, or laugh your way through this farce.
I chose to treat it as a comedy......a tragic comedy, but a comedy.  Very hilarious.  Unfortunately, it wasn't meant as a comedy.

I live in the real world, not the fantasy world that thinks Tom Cruise is somehow intimidating.

Lee Child...you blew it allowing this to happen.",1476230400,,1321,4.605150214592275

Can we please have an action movie without a car chase? Second, I am convinced that Tom Cruise insists that he engage in a fight scene in which he drops the gun, so he can go hand to hand with the bad guy. Tom, next time, just shoot the bad guy!

Cruise is such a short, slight person, and yet he keeps making all these action movies. Unbelievable to the max. Strongly recommend you read the books.

Of course, the author of the 'Rizzoli and Isles' books also sold her soul for money. The casting in that show is awful, awful, awful. None of the characters, except possibly the father, is anything like they are in the books.  And a cop raised in Boston with a Texas accent??

5496516,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"The movie is effectively shot, and the script catches the laconic tone of Lee Child's dialogue pretty well, and although Tom Cruise doesn't have the right physical look for Reacher, the script keeps well on the acceptable side of the smartypants snideness we so often see in Cruise's movies.  Don't expect the movie to give you interesting characters -- the interest here is in demonstrating Reacher's powers of deduction and inference and then in seeing how he plans and carries out counter-attacks.  For, as in the books, Reacher is never surprised, and the fun of the novels -- and of this movie to some extent -- lies in our awareness that he is always a step or two ahead of his enemies.  The basic plot here is that a man has been framed for multiple murders, and Reacher soon figures out that he is innocent.  He teams up with the man's lawyer, Helen (Rosamund Pike), to prove his innocence, figure out the real killers and their buddies, and settle matters satisfactorily, if not, strictly speaking, legally.  Werner Herzog, of all people, shows up scarily, and the good final conflict is made interesting and even amusing by Robert Duvall's turn as an old Marine sharpshooter whom Reacher enlists to help.  How exactly that comes about, I won't say in the interest of avoiding spoilers.  Rosamund Pike is an actress of some range, but in a movie where no character has more than one dimension, I think that she gets a bit of a raw deal here.  Her lines are sparse, and about all she's given to do is widen her eyes in incredulity at either Reacher's general awesomeness or the depths of evil to which bad people will sink.  But it was fun to watch -- better than I expected.",1475193600,,1683,4.60200668896321

5496653,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Note: This theatrical review was originally posted on Amazon on Dec. 25, 2012.  The Blu Ray update follows.
Possible spoilers.  As usual, Tom Cruise is getting picked on by many as not suitable for this role. And as usual, he's perfect. OK, so he's not 6' 5"" or whatever as portrayed in the novels from which the story is extracted. Still, author Lee Child is said to be fine with the casting.

Reacher (Cruise) is a highly decorated former soldier whose last job was a military detective. After his discharge Reacher disappears, for whatever reason. The film opens with an effective sequence of a sniper setting up in a high rise parking garage across from the Pittsburgh Pirates stadium. He manages to pick off 5 individuals seemingly at random, but also leaves enough clues that the police headed by detective Emerson (David Oyelowo) quickly arrest a suspect (Joseph Sikora).

Barr (Sikora) is severely beaten during a jail transfer. When first captured he asked his attorney (Rosamund Pike) to ""get Jack Reacher."" As it turns out Reacher finds Helen (Pike), her father (Richard Jenkins) who is also the DA and Emerson. Director and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie manages to lead the audience along with Reacher sifting through the clues with more attention than the police. McQuarrie even tosses in a couple Hitchcock-like ""McGuffins"" to complicate matters.

Clearly something is amiss and the film shifts gears into a corruption fed financial ploy. As the bad guys target Reacher, he goes into combat mode. He's highly skilled. As the primo gangster, Werner Herzog proves he's as effective in front of the camera as behind it. His Teutonic, one-eyed, fingerless take of a prison survivor is memorable. We do get the usual amount of gun play but it is mostly concentrated in scenes involving Reacher and an aging, newly acquired friend (Robert Duvall) attempting to rescue a kidnapped Helen.

The film may not be perfect as a couple of the scenes just seemed to be pasted in at the last minute to clarify something that happened earlier. But there are other surprises that keep things interesting and helps make this action/thriller a cut above the norm. Highly recommended.

(BLU RAY UPDATE) August 20, 2016
With a new Jack Reacher film due in a month or two, I thought it might be fun to go back and watch the original which came out around Christmas, 2012. I hadnt seen it since, but I liked it then and even more now on Blu ray. As usual a second viewing provides an opportunity to pick up on little tidbits missed the first time around.

Director and writer Christopher McQuarrie draws the audience in from the very beginning when we see a lone gunman known as Charlie (Jai Courtney) set up a scoped-out rifle in a parking garage across the river from the Pittsburgh Pirates stadium. A walking path between the stadium and river is flush with pedestrians and joggers. Charlie scans the people left and right and we get to see them, all unexpecting innocents, young and old, male and female. He then begins to pick them off one by one.

A suspect, Barr (Joseph Sikora) is captured quickly thanks to a fingerprint left on a quarter fed to a parking meter where his vehicle was parked. Barr, a former Army sniper doesnt confess and asks that Jack Reacher be found to help him. His attorney, Helen (Rosamund Pike) and her father, the D. A. (Richard Jenkins) are surprised that Reacher shows up unexpectedly. Reacher is recruited to help Helen and he begins to look into the case. His former military job was a detective and he worked to convict Barr of killing civilians in Iraq.

What makes this movie well above average is that Reacher, well played by Tom Cruise, brings to light small clues that begin to add up. The audience tends to go along with him, not necessarily looking ahead or being left behind. Were kind of feel like a partner and discover the revelations as he does. Reacher is a mysterious individual both before and after the case is solved. I look forward to the new movie.

This 2013 Blu ray package includes a DVD and a digital download. The Blu ray comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 2.35:1 aspect ratio. It is hard to say more than the transfer is perfect from both a visual and audio perspective. Originally shot on 35 mm film, the disc maintains the look include excellent grain, modulated throughout the movie. It is sharp, colorful and maintains excellent detail and clarity, even in the long distance shots, of which there are several. A flawless presentation.

Likewise the DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 audio track is perfect. The score and the excellent soundtrack are well presented and show up in all the speakers on queue. Dialog is easily understood. Gunshots ring out with proper clarity and differ in sound given the surroundings. That is, the long distance shot from a parking garage sounds different than a long distance shot on an open gun range. The video and audio are both demo worthy material.

Subtitles include French, Spanish, Portuguese and English SDH. Extras include a commentary with Cruise and McQuarrie and another with composer Joe Kramer on an isolated musical score. Featurettes include When the Man Comes Around, You Do Not Mess with Jack Reacher and The Reacher Phenomenon with the author Lee Child.",1471651200,,5267,4.806629834254144

You have to literally PUT YOURSELF ""IN"" the movie to appreciate the acting. I loved it and it is soooo underrated.",1461888000,,819,4.503355704697986
5496856,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Excellent Thriller; You think you know what happened and by whom, then you are wondering.  Even when you find out, you don't know why.  At the end you get not only a new surprise, but a good ending.  The casting is outstanding.  The characterizations very professional.  I read a long time ago that people who knew Tom Cruise would play Jack Reacher couldn't get past the physical dissimilarities between the actor and the book's character.  Mr. Cruise banishes that from the 'Git Go'.  I watched it twice, then bought the movie and will continue to be entertained.",1461801600,,565,4.762886597938144

5496858,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"The movie was pretty good BUT casting Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher didn't make any sense for anyone who has read the books.

5496861,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Clever approach, interesting twists and turns, and an end you will probably not see coming.  Not a big Tom Cruise fan, personally, but this one I had to watch twice... Jack Reacher is not the usual Cruise venue: not the ladies' man, not the playboy, not the cute grin or mindless action... There is no truly 'innocent' bystander in this movie and no one should be taken at face value.",1461542400,2,384,4.485714285714286
5496862,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Thriller movie,1461542400,,14,6.5
5496863,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"Tom Cruise is NOT Jack Reacher and never will be. Yeah, he nails the role if you've never read a Lee Child Jack Reacher novel. But I'm halfway through the current series of 20 novels, and to say Tom Cruise is Jack Reacher is about the same as saying Mr. Rogers is Conan the Barbarian. Child makes a big deal about Reacher's height, hair and eye color in the novels, which are respectively 6'5"", blonde hair, and blue eyes. Cruise is what, 5'7"" and the hair/eye color are all wrong, as well. Therefore, regardless of how well this movie was put together (I did think it was a good movie on its own merits), I will never be able to take it seriously because it is such a gargantuan radical departure of who Jack Reacher is in the novels. His height gives him all sorts of advantages in the novels, and his general appearance is very distinctive in many ways. This, in turn, lends itself to many nuances in his personality and the way he interacts with other people in the novels. We get none of this in the movie, which is just far too large of a departure from this superb series of novels to ignore. One star for the worst casting debacle I have ever seen.",1461542400,2,1156,4.307339449541284

5496865,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"So there's this great movie.  There's murder there's emotion, there's well written characters and the whole experience is quite good.  Then there's this main character.  He's good looking, he's good at everything, he makes all the ladies swoon and he's just the best you guys.  Irony that the only problem in the otherwise solid movie Jack Reacher, is...Jack Reacher.  The movie does an amazing job with immersion and getting me to care about  whats going on.  Then the alien from the planet awesome shows up and hes so flawless and untouchable that he kills any sense of tension in the movie.  I should probably stop now, I did give the movie four stars and yeah, sans the main character this is a five star movie all the way.  So give it a watch I think most people tend to enjoy/hate less my singular complaint about this movie.",1461456000,,831,4.598639455782313

Rosamund Pike's character was intelligent and sexy.  Werner Hertzog's character was uniquely terrifying, so much so that I almost had to change the channel. Maneuvers in that Chevy Chevelle SS brought back happy memories, wow!! Wish I had enjoyed this movie on the Big Screen when it was first released. Those who are into ""military (especially sniper) culture,"" will enjoy content reflecting this.

I enjoyed it nonetheless Chevrolet Chevelle Chase/scenes notwithstanding(Being the best).It is a good action packed thriller,the Lady Lawyer is Beautiful. And now that I got it as a Gift and As a Blu-Ray+DVD+Digital I am glad I own it. In the commentary the author of the novel that its based off says the movie is pretty much the novel and sticks to most of the book except The character's height.

Unfortunately I have read the Reacher series multiple times and Reacher's size (and genetic make up of that size)  IS a part of just WHO Reached is. It is as much of him as his psyche, his instincts, his logic, his thought process.

So I couldn't quite fully get past the casting of Tom Cruise.

I have STILL watched the movie (via DVD movie loans through the library network) probably three times.

The Washington Times calls this movie ""Taut, muscular, gruff and cool"" for a BIG reason. Mission Impossible meets Above the Law(Stephen Seagal) is the best way to describe this action packed thriller. This film is rated PG-13 for violence and language.

Jack Reacher got through to me. It probably has something to do with the fact that it involved and was filmed in Pittsburgh where I began my career and lived for 8 years.  I saw many of the sites that I covered as a systems engineer.

5497139,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Well, I had low expectations due to Tom Cruise portraying a character that was described as being the better part of six and a half feet of pure muscle, but Jack Reacher was a very well done movie. The acting more than makes up for the fact that the role was being played by someone who didn't fit the mental image I had in the slightest...and that was just where Cruise was concerned. The rest of the cast was amazing, but that's to be expected when you have a man like Robert Duvall on the roster.
There were creative liberties taken in the form of deviations from the source material, but nothing that hindered the plot in the least...granted, it's been a while since I read any of Lee Child's novels, and I don't believe I read any further into the Jack Reacher books than One Shot (the novel this movie is adapted from). I'm certainly no authority on the character or novels in which he appears, but I felt that the movie was a faithful representation.
My girlfriend made a comment near the beginning of the movie that the character of Reacher reminds her of me...and that was pretty damn flattering. Maybe that's part of the reason I enjoy the books and this movie, a sort of relatability. Maybe I should have just gone into military service like I wanted to before I had children at what could be argued as having been too young of an age.",1437868800,,1346,4.409638554216867

5497223,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Very average movie, no strong opinion either way.  The acting was average, the plot predictable and the pace was slow, but steady.  As someone who grew up in Pittsburgh, I loved the background, reminded me of home (moved out in 1996).  I think my biggest issue with the movie is that I am not sure the movie even knew who Jack Reacher was as a character.  Was he a detective, a cop, a special forces action hero, a Jack Ryan type, the Equalizer?  I have no clue....and this is what bugged me most, as they couldn't settle on him, he had no true definition as a character.  My recommendation is wait until it is free and then check it out if nothing better to do.",1436400000,,662,4.256

I'm sure that the Tom Cruisers (Tom Cruise fans, where fan = fanatic) out there are going to enjoy this movie more than I did. I know I'm that way with Robin Williams's movies. (I have been known to watch terrible RW movies again on the assumption that I'll get more out of them each time, and I do find that if I know how a movie ends, I can actually enjoy the movie more..

5497344,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"I judge a movie by how well it engages me.  I found the movie to be paced a bit slow for my taste and the genre is a bit tired to me.

With the negatives out of the way, let me say this isn't your usual Hollywood thriller-action-drama.  The Reacher character is not a stero type of the Hollywood leading man.  He has depth that is well portrayed by Cruise.  Further his interactions show a smart man a step ahead of everyone else, but not so ahead that it's fantastical fiction.

That a long with the twists, that were pleasant surprises, probably mean I should give the movie four stars.

I give stars by my desire to re watch a movie.  Three means I enjoyed it, but probably won't watch it again.  That may change as the movie is popping up in media now.  If after a second viewing the movie is compelling it deserves a four star.  I guess I'm really torn on the rating as three doesn't seem fair, but four doesn't feel right either.

Bottom line, if this is your genre you will like the movie.  If not, it's still a good watch.  If you hate Tom Cruise you will be surprised by it.",1435276800,,1083,4.169082125603865

But, this was a sleeper for me.  The plot didn't drag, the characters were believable (for a change) and it was played with much the same ""grit"" that Damon put down in Bourne and the new James Bond seems to portray.  I liked the idea that Reacher was more the ""every guy"" than superman.  There was just enough beef to keep me interested (and I mean ""meat"", no beefcake), but just enough depth of motive and relationship to keep my wife on the line for 2 hours.  You don't know my wife, but you'd have been impressed.  A great date movie, at least for us, since every relationship seemed to matter to the characters...and, because of that, we cared also.  I'd love to see Reacher come back after this to relate the back story.  Four stars for taking the time to develop the story and to not try and dumb down the things that mattered, like trust and respect.  Kudos, Tom!",1435190400,7,1044,4.4188481675392675

The character is supposed to be this huge. large giant of a man with scars all over him and a presence that makes people cross the street when they see him coming.... even if he's trying to appear friendly when asking directions to the bus station.  In this movie he is portrayed as an involuntary charmer that attracts women without even trying.  Not at all the Jack Reacher that is described in the books.

I don't believe in revealing plot in these reviews, just that it's dark with elements of old detective movies I used to enjoy. I'm sure you can read other entries for the plot if that's really what you want but I think it's worth your viewing time to see.

Fast paced with a dynamite cast and script. I've watched this at least twice just to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Mr. Cruise has stared in exciting, surprising, even inspiring movies--this just was not one of them.  Note to big time producers:  next time try this: Rosamund Pike, brilliant tough girl, Tom Cruise, not exactly brilliant, but thinks he is; both of them in near death (or near embarrassment (what's the difference?), tight spots which leads to victory over the bad forces at the end.  And yes, Rosamund's character gets laid (tastefully done, of course), but on her kinky terms,  not by semi-looser Tom Cruise's character, but by ME--oops, wishful thinking taking over--no, by the bad guy's evil leader's illegitimate 6'4"" Seattle Sea Hawks football hero son.

5497813,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I am not a huge Tom Cruise fan. but I have been a fan of Jim Grant (pen name Lee Child) and his book (One Shot) for a few years.  The hard boiled MP in this book, Jack Reacher, is a muster out MP detective with an eidetic memory, penchant for baseball trivia, riffle expert, and serious desire for anonymity.  With a strapping 6 foot frame this guy is physically imposing.  So in comparison to Tom Cruise in real life, (good looking, height 5 feet in change, average memory) for Tom to pull this character off, he has to play way out of his league.  To Tom's personnel credit, his involvement with scientology and the controlling nature of Nicole Kidman did prepare him well for the structured role of the military brat Jack Reacher.  Also in comparison,  In the written novels Jack is swilling coffee as much as Bill Clinton has extra marital affairs.  The movie lacks this basic character attribute (probably a scientology thing).

The movie is based in Pittsburgh where graft and corruption is gaining a foot hold in the construction business.  a slick crew of underworld business men have paved the way to bilk taxpayers out of millions of dollars on not needed construction contracts.  However, the key to quickly attaining their goal is to take over a local business by setting up a certain war vet sniper to take the rap of a serial murder.  Here in lies the rub ... Jack Reacher already prosecuted this guy for a similar crime years ago when in war time.  However, due to political red tape, the sniper was allowed to get away with it and the whole matter was buried in military red tape.  Jack vows that if this sniper gets his nose dirty in real life, Jack will be there to put the dog down.  The underworld guys perfect cover-up now has a nemesis in Jack Reacher , oddly enough trying to accomplish the same task ... Put the dog down!

Enter Rosamund Pike (Helen Rodin) who is a zealous public defender and daughter of Allegheny county DA.  She becomes the attorney for the patsy.  With the murder of 5 people in a public plaza and the patsy wrapped up for sure prosecution,  the movie unfolds like a roller coaster ride.  The cinematography of the Pittsburgh area is stunning, the supporting actors are tremendous in their roles, and the musical score is hauntingly aware of the changing tides the movie takes.

In real life I know a few guys  like Jack Reacher.  None of them approach the physical stature that Jim Grant attributes Jack in his books.  So I do not hold this as a rub against Tom's portrayal  as the imposing PI.  This movie is a  gem and worth watching several times to pick up all the nuances of the original book ""One Shot"".  I can hardly wait for the sequel to be released.  In my opinion  ""a must watch""",1432857600,,2736,4.481781376518219

5497824,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Tom Cruise in the ""Jack Reacher"" film, based on a fictional book series, isn't too bad of a movie.  I did enjoy watching the film, and I have always been a big fan of Tom Cruise and his movies.  Ultimately I am amazed just how good he looks after all of these years performing in one action film to the next.

  The character ""Jack Reacher"" is an interesting Military Police Officer who seems to try to help solve violent crimes, and help both the cops and civilians along the way. I liked this character a lot and found tremendous potential for Cruise to develop this into a more realistic, slower paced, and slightly more gritty version of his awesome ""Mission Impossible"" series.

  Reacher is such a good guy, even though he is quite, to the point, serious, and all business with ZERO time for nonsense that he actually takes the time to warn the IDIOT thugs who desire to inflict harm upon them before giving them the A$$ beating they deserve.  He takes NO prisoners when fighting the criminal scum in American society, but unlike Charles Bronson, Chuck Norris, or Arnold he usually doesn't kill anyone unless he is forced to.

 The movie has some awesome sniper and marksman scenes I liked.

Another item I really liked about this movie that makes it stick out above most other action films, is he DOESN'T get the girl.  This man does NOT care about scoring with the pretty lady in distress, and there is ZERO romance which I found refreshing because too many guy orientated action films women are portrayed in movies as sexual objects that they just have to have a romance with, or rescue only later to have sex with.  The formula is SO unrealistic and very old, worn out.  Hollywood has this traditional formula that the guy just has to get the girl, or the woman gets her man and one has to ask themselves, ""Why is that?"" In real life, some times men and women DON'T have sexual relationships and they do not run off with one another at the end of an event.

 The gun fights are well choreographed, as are the Martial Arts scenes, and stunts.  The ONLY issue I did have was there had been zero sexuality or nudity (& I mean side characters in the film NOT Cruise with some potential love interest) in this film that could have been rated R, but because of this awful modern trend in Hollywood where teenage audience dollars is what they are targeting, all of that was not featured at all.

 Hopefully looking forward to seeing another one of these films soon, and would like to see Cruise return to this role again.  So B+ and thumbs up for ""Jack Reacher"".",1432252800,,2565,4.484913793103448
5497825,4,B00AS1Q8FW,It's a good movie.  I have read all the books and enjoyed them; and actually very much enjoyed watching Tom Cruise because he captures the Jack Reacher attitude and essence without having to be 6 ft 5 inches tall. Hopefully the sequels further develop Reacher's aggression towards bad guys like the books.,1432252800,,305,4.865384615384615

BUT the movie is actually great.  Cruise pulls it off.  In fact I don't know what 6'5"" actor has the gravitas to pull off playing Reacher...who is also a kind of genius with a photographic memory....not easy to do.  The movie is exciting, well-acted and VERY well-directed.  A wonderful car chase of the sort you used to see in Bullitt.  The kicker is the coup of getting a famous director in his own right to play the bad guy.  He is BEYOND chilling.  Look it up.

5498088,5,B00AS1Q8FW,I have to admit that I have watched it several times but it's my type of action/suspense linked with a former military agent who no longer works for the government all The Shooter or the Bourne movies.

Some of the one star reviewers are unhappy that Tom Cruise was chosen to play Jack Reacher who in the novels that inspired the movie is a tall, muscular, laid back blond guy. I am not. Instead imagine that novels were written about a short, dark haired uptight guy - Cruise still fails. Although Cruise was good in Top Gun and A Few Good Men he does not deliver in this one, His efforts to play a hard man make him look constipated. Steven Segal can make an emotionless face work for him in action movies - he has to since that seems the only expression he has but when Cruise tries that he ends up looking something between pre-occupied and uncomfortable. Some action sequences are good but the final action scenes fall flat because the require a sequence of poor decisions by both Reacher and villains. Rosamund Pike playing opposite Cruise does a good job, she is believable as a sexy but not slutty lawyer motivated by principle but in over her head. There is 0 sexual chemistry between her character and Cruise because constipated is not just not sexy.",1430438400,,1203,4.497716894977169

I am not a fan of Tom Cruise. I usually think he isn't acting and just playing himself, an arrogant jerk. Furthermore he's playing the role of Jack Reacher from the books. A really BIG guy. Tom Cruise is NOT big by any stretch of the imagination.

5498168,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"So let me begin by saying I am not a Tom Cruise fan. At all. I also don't equate this character here with the Jack Reacher from the books. But having said that...

This is a great movie. The action scenes were impressive, the cinematography had its moments, Cruise's character was a total badass, and the plot is generally straightforward. In fact plot-wise, I liked this movie much more than the book it's based on, which is a rare thing for me. But here, they've tightened up the story quite a bit, and apart from the fact they maybe should've done a better job of explaining what exactly the bad guys do, I had very few problems with it. Really, this has become one of my favorite movies, to the point where I watch it at least once a year.

Now, does all this mean it's perfect? Obviously not. Rosamund Pike needed to cut back on the overacting in more than one scene, and the ending is somewhat flawed. Also, like I said, a clearer explanation of what the bad guys do and how they do it would've been nice for those who haven't read the book.

But in general, this movie is a fast and fun ride with a Reacher I'm excited to see in the sequel.",1430092800,5,1147,4.252293577981652

So who is cast to play this character but diminutive Tom Cruise. I guess Paul Reubens, the actor who played Pee Wee Herman wasn't available.
For the record, Paul Reubens is a very good actor. And Tom Cruise is not without talent. But casting Tom Cruise in THIS role where the character's physical appearance, size, and strength are so central to his behavior pattern and the behaviors of others towards him..........was absurd.  Actor, Lee Marvin, would have been convincing as Reacher. Tom Cruise-not so much.",1430006400,,671,5.137614678899083

Not nearly enough is made of the potential for the character of Zec, played by Werner Herzog Stipeti.  However, if the Zec were developed, that would have detracted from Cruise and Pike.  In fact, the movie is really just a vehicle for Cruise and Rosamund Mary Ellen Pike, an English actress known more for her looks than acting skills.  Like Cruise, she has a pleasant predictability, kind of like McDonalds.  Not much substance; but no surprises.  The rest of the characters are cardboard, except perhaps for Robert Duvall, who is allowed to show range.  Stipeti, Duvall and Fast were perfect for their roles.  The rest were interchangeable.

I love the way that Tom Cruise plays Jack Reacher. When I found out that Tom Cruise was going to be the one in that role, I was very very skeptical.

Every time somebody even says anything about Tom Cruise, the first thing that pops into my mind is his a typical Tom Cruise smile. The smile that he has every single movie, and every single picture... Well in this movie that smile is gone and the glour that he has is perfection.

He plays this movie like he is Jack Reacher.

I thought how the movie started out was perfect, Jack Reacher's  play into it was really nice. The other characters that were in the movie, Werner Herzog, Jai Courteney and Alexia fast made some super strong impressions. Actually in fact I googled all three of them to see what else they have played in. Just to see how they would compare to the roles in the Reacher movie. I really like this film, I like the fact that it was different, I like the fact that Reacher was a military former sniper.

And my favorite part was that he walked away from everything that had to do with the government because he just stopped believing in it. I see that happening all around us these days, & I do agree with it.",1429315200,,1202,4.25

Robert Duvall is a hoot!  He's a codgy old fart named Cash and has a sense of humor.  On the night of the big shoot out he gives Jack a knife while he uses gun.  Both Cash and Jack rush in for an amazing rescue of the damsel in distress.

5498446,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Tom Cruise just doesn't cut it as Jack Reacher.  According to Wikipedia, Cruise is 5'7"", and Reacher is about 6'5"" and 230 solid pounds. Those features are a significant part of his persona. I can't imagine what the producer and/or director was thinking when they agreed to this casting.  Watching Cruise take on five guys in a barroom brawl was at least funny... but not believable.  Reacher's size is a necessary part of any film that purports to follow the storyline of the books.

5498481,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"I borrowed this movie simply out of curiosity.

I have never read the Reacher books and I am told it would have helped but other peoples comments suggest it would have hurt as there are frequent departures from the book.  What movie doesn't?

I don't know the story character so I can't judge the performance. If I had to describe it.  It was Cruise being Cruise.

The character seems interesting especially in the area of disappearing when he wants.  He doesn't worry about possessions, lives off cash and takes the simplest means of transportation.

Plot wise; it was ok. It has a good twist but if you haven't read the books or don't pay attention the whole time, you will miss the purpose of the mastermind.  I missed the explanation and found myself wondering who he was at the end and what was his reasons?

Action wise, the film is pretty good.  Fight scenes are ok with the bar fight probably being the best.  Reacher explains what will be the outcome and I have heard similar comments about what to do in dealing with multiple attackers.

There is a car chase which was ok but it seemed more for the sake of the action shots then part of the story.

The last fight left me wondering. The Reacher character came across as a no nonsense quick resolution type of guy.  He had his antagonist in his sight. He then tosses the weapon aside and goes hand to hand.  It's an ok fight but I liked the bar fight better.

Overall, it's not a disappointing movie.  I did get the feeling I was missing things from not having read the book.",1428105600,,1534,4.421428571428572

Tom Cruise would not except in this movie each bad guy waits his turn to go a mano with Tom while Tom telegraphs each blow so badly that the bad guys should have been able to get out of the way. Much of the rest of the movie is just ""drive by"" as Tom's performance, other than grimacing, doesn't match up to the artistry he has shown before.

5498628,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"This movie has a few issues.  The characters seem to change, without explanation, in service of making the story more interesting or intense. Also, the main character, played by Tom Cruise, is not interesting and the characters actions are not always congruent. The story also seems to go off the rails in a movie that is nowhere near as self-aware as it should be. The most redeeming qualities of the film are the acting, which appears OK, and the production values are good.
One of my biggest issues where characters act out of the ordinary is the relationship between Rosamund Pike and Richard Jenkins characters, father and daughter. Their relationship is jagged, however they definitely care for each other. In the film Rosamund Pikes character approaches Richard Jenkins requesting help because she thinks her life is in danger. His response is nothing short of, Oh, that stinks which seems only to push the notion he might be involved in more sinister motives. Earlier in the film he explicitly gets visibly upset when Rosamund Pikes character makes a decision which he thinks will look poorly on her career.
The film is full of other examples where character actions are different than expected not to show they are in fact growing but just in service of making the story seem more interesting. It does not work well at any point. A character, played by Robert Duvall, is the one good character in the film. Sadly, he is not introduced until later in the film.
This movie has a lot of potential considering the amount of talent behind the film. It is really sad it feels so held back by the character development and the overall story.",1427328000,,1643,4.785211267605634

Some characters and subplots are missing (as one would expect in a movie version), but the net result is still a good ride.  Child's descriptions and explanations of hand-to-hand combat techniques are largely lost because of the swiftness of the encounters.  That could have been helped by slow motion sequences blended into that type of action.  Tom Cruise is still  physically not similar to Reacher, but it's his money so he gets the part.  Only dedicated readers will be disappointed, though.  Overall, a good thriller.",1426723200,,582,5.127659574468085

5498807,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"I loved the book one shot. The book was nice, crisp and clear with a cool plot. When I saw the trailer for the movie I thought I had to see this. However, it didn't really come around in my playbook and I missed it the first time around. But on the plane back from France I was able to see it.

At first I didn't realize that it was based off the book one shot, but as the movie progressed I could definitely see that it was that. Tom Cruise played a pretty good Reacher, but I thought Reacher was some sorta mountain of muscles, I-can-snap-The-Rock-in-half-like-a-toothpick kind of guy. He was great in the Expendables, but not so great in this one.

I really liked the beginning of the movie when the sniper is picking people off but you cant see his face. At the end of the movie you can kinda see why the sniper was killing people, but what is really weird is that how did the sniper know that the 2 targets would be in the same park. Also, the reason why the sniper kills the people is still unclear. How were they a threat to the organization is still unclear.

Overall the movie is like a stereotypical generic action movie, with murders and a car chase blah blah blah. The acting was ok, but I think you should see it and tell me what you think, below",1426550400,,1259,4.194214876033058

5498834,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Why five stars when I don't like Tom Cruise?  It is because Cruise is excellent at what he does.  He picks only the best scripts and characters that match his acting skills.  He makes the character blend into the fabric of his acting skills to create interest in the plot.  As for the movie, he plays the character Jack Reacher.  Reacher's skills as an investigator tweaked the interest of the attorney representing the innocent bad-guy who had been beaten into a coma just after he had requested Reacher.  Reacher conducts himself as a mild-manner ""alpha"" that reacts only to overt threats.  He does not need to bully or intimidate others, though his character is given the capability and the abilities to give a deadly response when needed, as he gathers information to support the conclusions of his investigation. It was pleasant to watch martial arts action without the typical theatrical-flair of actors-on-wires doing the impossible.  The sniper's weapon wasn't the usual exotic firearm.  It was just something practical that would get the job done.  Unfortunately, when a shot-body collapses on clean concrete, the absence of blood leaking from the corpse is noticeable (This is something strange in movies in this era where gore, blood, guts and violence are used in lieu of good scripts and good acting).  Fortunately, the script's continuity was magnificent and the flow of the action and the dialogue were so well coordinated it required a second look just to make sure the blood was missing!  The rescue of the female (the blond attorney) by the hero (Cruise) was expected.  The twist to bring this all together for closure was the Marine helping the Army guy to save the blond being held by the real bad-guys.  Now, the puzzling part.  There were big trucks and little trucks.  The little truck hauled the Marine to the movie's final-action set.  The Marine drove the big truck.  The big truck didn't smash or squish anything which is the typical use of big trucks in action movies.  The Marine covered Cruise in the final segment so Cruise could save the blond.  Then a curious thing became noticable in today's political-correct thinking.  The DA wasn't corrupt.  The black guy was bad and then dead.  Then the really bad guy -- ""Oh, to learn how Reacher played the final card you will have to watch the movie!""",1426377600,5,2327,4.850253807106599

Well let me throw this nugget of personal observation: I watched this movie for the second time with my 91 year old mother who was watching it for the first time. Now she has become a Reacher fanatic over the last several months and has read every novel up to this point.  So when the movie finished she began to list the differences between the novels and the film and this lasted a good 10 to 15 minutes.  However it was the last thing she said that got my attention. She said Cruse acted big..  I didn't know what she meant till later when I thought about it.  Then it dawned on me, Cruse did act big.  His whole stature, walk, the way he talked suggested bigness.  If you will noticed that the movie is filmed in such a way with camera angles that Cruse's size or lack of size is not noticeable. So five stars for the acting of Cruse and for the camera work.",1426291200,,918,4.1525423728813555

5498923,4,B00AS1Q8FW,I love Lee Child's Jack Reacher series and although this movie tried to emulate Reacher's stoic attitude I just couldn't get by casting Tom Cruise in this role.  For one he doesn't match Reacher's physical size nor the image I have built up in my mind about Reacher's appearance. I always pictured him as a Steven Segal look alike but unfortunately Segal's actions have tainted that image.  Another issue is the need for  the false background about Reacher serving in Iraq. I guess this was to make Cruise look more credible in terms of age. Anyway the rest of the acting was good and I guess under Lee Child's input fairly true to Reacher's personality and habits.,1425945600,,665,4.666666666666667

Very decent adaptation of a popular literary character to the screen when compared to to many others that come to mind. I went into this as one of the people somewhat disdainful of Cruise playing a character whose written inspiration stands a foot taller and outweighs him by 100 lbs., but he invests the titular character with enough intensity to easily compensate for the physical difference. The other actors all do good work here, too, including Rosamund Pike, who plays a composite of two characters from the novel, ONE SHOT. Robert Duvall plays a small but very good part and Werner Herzog comes to the other side of the camera as a chilling villain.",1425945600,,756,4.649253731343284

5498934,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"A graduate of the US Military Academy at West Point, Jack Reacher served 13 years in the Military Police, during which time he became part of a military police unit, the 110th Special Investigations Unit, formed to handle exceptionally tough cases, especially those involving members of the US Army Special Forces. He received many military awards during his career, including the Silver Star, the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Soldier's Medal, the Bronze Star, and a Purple Heart for wounds sustained in the bombing of the US Marine Corps barracks in Beirut in 1983. Since leaving the Army, Reacher has been a drifter. He wanders throughout the US because he was accustomed to being told where to go, when to go and what to do for every day of his life from military childhood to military adulthood. He also felt he never got to know his own country, having spent much of his youth living overseas on military bases and at West Point. He usually travels by hitchhiking or bus. As a drifter, the only possessions he carries are money, a foldable toothbrush and, after 9/11, an expired passport and an ATM debit card.

Reacher shows up after multiple murders are committed all at once by a mystery sniper. An arrest is made of a former soldier, with whom Reacher has bad history. The plot unfolds. There are fights, conspiracies, hinting but unfulfilled romance, etc. In the end, Reacher lives for another sequal.",1425945600,,1439,4.825910931174089

Tom Cruise is getting better with age in my opinion. Oblivion was excellent and this one is top notch as well. In some ways it takes a bit from the Taken series of films with Liam Neeson, but twists it significantly to be fairly original in its approach.

All and all a good crime drama, with quite a thrilling car chase and a decent plot twist near the end.",1425945600,,421,4.185185185185185
5498972,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I have read every Lee Child novel featuring the 6'4"", 240 lb. Jack Reacher.  In one story Reacher is shot in the chest and head yet survives.  This is due to the fact that his pec muscles are so dense and his skull is so thick the bullets barely penetrate.  Cruise does not meet the physical characteristics of Reacher, neither do most human beings.  This minor point notwithstanding, Cruise excels at bringing the stern and satirical Jack Reacher to life.  I attribute this accomplishment to the fact that Cruise is a great actor.  The pacing of this thriller/mystery is methodical with moments of well choreographed action.  Once again Cruise does his own fight scenes and stunt work.  He also has a great time demolishing a Chevelle SS.  It was a bittersweet moment for this muscle car fanatic.  Definitely worth the price of admission.  You'll watch it more than once.",1425859200,,872,4.785234899328859

Some of the actors weren't that great, especially the lead female character, she struck me as being a bit wooden. The other female character (and I mean the character not the actor) couldn't have been any dumber. The biggest problem, if you ever read a description of Jack Reacher you know Tom Cruise does not match his description but I put that aside. The story itself wasn't too bad, not the greatest but it didn't put me to sleep and the action scenes were pretty good which is why I gave it three stars.",1424390400,,661,4.253968253968254

5499297,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Not the typical action thriller you come to expect from Cruise but has an interesting intensity to it.  The supporting role of Rosamund Pike brings it more reality and no film is ever bad when Robert Duval appears.  It is more conceptually believable than most action thrillers or murder movies.  More in the line of films like 'Next of Kin' in style.  I have watched it more than once just to measure it.,1424390400,,405,4.506849315068493

5499417,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Whats it about?

Tom Cruise plays Jack Reacher: A calm, yet intense individualist reminiscent of Ethan Hunt, John Anderton, Pete Maverick Mitchell and, lets face it, Tom Cruise (pre-couch).

Jack casually struts and punches his way through what begins as a suspenseful procedural thriller. At some point a clerical error appears to have shuffled in every other film genre available. Jack is emotionally unaffected as he travels through Bond style action, Arnie one liners, Whedonesque banter, torture-porn and stooges slapstick before finally settling on the eighties style buddy cop to round out the evening.

What did I think?

Cruise manages to hold this movie together like an affable tour host on a poorly written theme park ride. His dedication to ticking off the cliches no matter what aisle of the video store they come from is admirable.

Ultimately this adds up to a fun romp but try not to think about it too much on the drive home or youll just get frustrated.",1423699200,,972,4.938650306748467

Tom Cruise did ok with the Reacher attitude, but he's just not enought of a physical presence to be Reacher. If anyone reads the books, they'd be hard pressed to see anyone who's less than 6'2"", 250# playing this role (Think Dolph Lundgren in Rocky 4, at least).

If you know these stories, you will probably have a pretty good image of who Jack Reacher is, what he is, and how he would appear.  In short (pun intended), Tom Cruise doesn't cut it.  Not only is he very short (Jack Reacher is over 6 feet tall and as tough as nails) but his one-dimensional acting talent is an offense to the character of Jack Reacher.  I should never have watched this movie because I've been put off by the terrible casting choice.  There is no character development, perhaps because Cruise just can't do it, and the whole thing just falls flat.  The poor choice of Cruise in this role really missed an opportunity to bring Reacher to life on screen, but this movie is a travesty when compared with the style with which the author creates Jack in his books.

5499462,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Even a cursory glance at the comments section will reveal the biggest question about this film:  can you accept Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher?  I enjoyed his work in the title role, but I can sympathize with fans of the series of novels who disconnect immediately when they see Cruise (who stands at a wiry 5'7"") playing a man they've always pictured as 6'5"", with the strength of a bull.  I haven't yet read any of the books (though I'm now adding a few to my queue after enjoying the movie), so I didn't come into the movie armed with that familiarity with the Reacher character.

So with that caveat out of the way?  I really enjoyed the film.  I thought this above-average Cruise, especially in his scenes interacting with (the always superb) Robert Duvall.  I wasn't as familiar with Jai Courtney, one of the antagonists, but I thought he was quite strong, and more than held his own in scenes with much bigger names.  Somehow I didn't know that legendary director Werner Herzog was in this movie -- and he was amazing!  When I saw Herzog appear, I thought it was a bit of (mildly distracting) stunt casting, but he really was chilling.  Alexia Fast was also compelling in a smaller role

I knew the script would be fine when I saw that Christopher McQuarrie was adapting.  McQuarrie was responsible for the script of The Usual Suspects.  I also thought he did a fine job of directing, but I have a soft spot for his only other feature film (Way of the Gun).  The editing, sound, and special effects are all excellent, as one would probably expect from an action film with a budget like this one.

The only element that stood out to me as highly unlikable was Rosamund Pike's defense attorney character.  I thought Pike was fine, but her character just kept making irrational decisions.  I was getting more frustrated than Reacher was with her inability to understand what he was saying.

But that's a minor quibble.  Overall, I would be happy to watch the film again, and I'd even be excited if they went the direct-to-DVD route for a few sequels.  If all of Lee Child's stories are as good as the book that spawned this one, such a film would be compelling even if the roles went to lesser known actors.",1421452800,,2207,4.525252525252525
5499463,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Fortunately, this wasn't too predictable. Hopefully you haven't had spoilers before watching it.

5499464,5,B00AS1Q8FW,Awesome movie,1421452800,,13,6.0
5499465,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"As a long-standing fan of the Lee Child novels, the very thought of the Hollywood midget playing Jack Reacher is utterly ridiculous. However, we were lent the film so thought we should try to give it an objective critique.

Much of the atmosphere of the original novels is built around Reacher's massive frame and threatening, brooding presence but, much like any book's adaptation for the big screen, it is necessary to put aside one's prior visualisation of the characters. Once you manage to do this you're left with, actually, a very creditable action movie. The plot is simple with no major twists, fairly true to the original book, the story bowls along at a good pace, there's no unnecessary slushy stuff and there's lots of fighting, guns and stuff going bang. Much like the novels, in fact. The only thing that didn't really sit right was the set-piece car chase.

All-in-all, a perfectly acceptable & enjoyable, though unexceptional action movie; typical Cruise stuff - don't think too much, sit back & enjoy the ride. Most of all, forget all you already know of Jack Reacher.",1421452800,,1086,4.864864864864865
5499466,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"What a stinker! If you've read or listened (on audio book)  to any of the Jack Reacher novels you know this isn't Reacher. They added extra car chases, extra fights, eliminated important characters and generally made a simplistic hash of the plot. It plays more like an old TV movie (not a good one) --and I don't mean a cable movie. Cruise just does not  evoke any intelligence, just smugness Having Tom Cruise play Jack Reacher seemed like a bad idea initially and this movie confirms it. If you really want to enjoy Lee Child's creations, read the books, or listen to Dick Hill read them. I'm not going to make the mistake of watching another one of these turkeys.",1421452800,,667,4.55

5499468,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"This was a decent actioner.  First off, I admit that I was very disappointed with he casting of Tom Cruise as the film's namesake, Jack Reacher.  Book Jack was a 6""5"" , blue-eyed behemoth whereas Tom Cruise....isn't.  However, Mr. Cruise does commit to the part and handles himself admirably.  It was actually kind of fun, seeing diminutive Tom  square off against some random guys who expected an easy go of it.  Then he beats the snot out of them. Score one for the little guy.  He traded bulk and power for speed and wit.  Nice.
The leading lady appeared to do most of her acting with her cleavage and her eyes.  That is, her eyes got big, then bigger, then I- was- afraid- they- would- pop- out- of- her- head big.  Her cleavage also had a distracting ebb and flow.
The flick really picked up with the appearance of the inimitable Robert Duval.  His brand of sly crustiness gave the action a much needed shot in the arm. (No pun intended.)  He is rapidly approaching American treasure status.
There are a few scenes that verge on being gruesome.  One in particular dealing with fingers.  They are offset a bit by some surprisingly funny action scenes such as the bathroom beat 'em up.  The chase scenes were a little over the top but that is to be expected in this type of movie.
The best thing to do is sit back, grab the popcorn and turn off your brain.  Just enjoy the movie for what it is - escapism with fisticuffs.",1421366400,,1424,4.4192307692307695

Some of my doubts were carried out-Tom did indeed play Jack as too arrogant. Reacher never has that hard edge shown in most of the confrontations in the story-he lets people find out how good he is rather than nastily informing them. And Reacher is a crappy driver-he only ever drove Humvees and Jeeps most of his life.
But the story is plotted out decently, the characters are believable and it retains the Reacher flavor. One thing Tom and Jack share is no compunction about fighting effectively, if not exactly ""honorably"". Two hits-he hits you, you hit the ground.
So this was an amusing movie and worth the price of admission.",1421020800,,798,4.626760563380282

I first met J when he was hired at Mt. Sinai Medical Center as a PTA under my supervision. It was there that saw his positive effect on the population of the hospital, not only the patients, but staff as well. J is a quick learner, energetic, and hardworking.

J is also very flexible and eager to take on new challenges. For example, during the busy summer season we needed extra shifts and inservices. J volunteered and made an immediate and positive impression on everyone there.

I'm convinced Jwill be as great an asset to your company as he has been to ours. Please feel free to contact me if you'd like any additional information.

Sincerely,

5499489,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"This movie has a lot of filler scenes that are not necessary for the story! I love Tom Cruise movies and hence my expectations from this film was much much higher than what I saw. Plus, I think the lead actress is just a disaster. Moreover, some scenes are ridiculous and do not agree with the genre of the movie (for example, the scene in the bathroom that ""Jack Reacher"" gets hit by a bat ... and then some extremely ridiculous scenes)!
I gave the second star because of the attention grabbing intro of the movie and because I love Tom Cruise and his style as I said.",1420761600,,569,4.277777777777778
5499490,3,B00AS1Q8FW,its ok but I have seen better movies,1420761600,,36,3.625
5499491,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Big fan of Tom Cruise, always excels at his character, but the other actors/actress didn't quiet performed to his level. But then again, what do I know, I'm just an amateur trying to enjoy a movie Friday night. I feel like this is one of those movies in which the director tries to compress so much contents into the two hour frame. Plots were flawed, but nonetheless I still watched it 'till the end, which says something.",1420761600,,423,4.5064935064935066
5499492,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"After watching ""Jack Reacher"" for the third time (in a short time), I'll have to say it's one of those movies that hasn't lost  it's appeal with multiple viewings. For me, that says a lot about a movie.  I've read some of the other reviews and have been impressed that some people don't think Tom Cruise was an appropriate choice for the part. I personally think this is one of the better roles he's played, if not the best, ... regardless of whether or not he fit the novel's description of the character. Apparently Lee Child had no problem with Cruise playing Reacher since Lee Child played the desk Sargent in the movie. Did anyone else view the credits long enough to notice that?",1420761600,,685,4.516129032258065

I honestly do not care for Tom Cruise as a person all that much, but for whatever reason, I really love his films.  Or maybe I just like action films and Tom Cruise happens to be in some good ones.  Either way, this is a good one.  I could have done without two of the gruesome scenes...my husband told me when I could look again!

5499550,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Know it all crime fighter who brings his thoughtful analysis to what appears on the surface as an open and shut case. Shades of Sherlock,Hercule, and the genre of those fictional characters who are on the edge of mystery and murder and who through brilliance find the 'true' villains and assure that justice triumphs is played out in this gripping tale about a modern day 'lone ranger.' The story keeps the watcher engaged and the twists and turns as to who the true 'bad guys' are plausible. The frustrations that many today have with the length of time for justice to occur is handled at the end. I did not like the moral of Jack Reacher playing the vigilante but the story makes his actions seem the logical alternative. Working outside of the law to obtain the right outcomes as presented is now a part of what we too often think has to be done in our fractured society. Portrayal of Russians as the 'bad guys' is reminiscent of what occurred during the past 'cold war' and that seems to be starting again through the role of amoral Russian mobsters who do not value life. Of course, Reacher's role helps one realize that those who fight crime often take on the some of the same characteristics.",1420416000,,1199,4.555555555555555

And even though I used to like Tom Cruise as an actor, his rantings from Scientology has left a much lower opinion of him in my mind. I thought he was more intelligent than that. I was really expecting this movie to be a bust.

Well I think he pulled off this movie excellently. I really enjoyed his portrayal of Jack Reacher. There were no references to him being a big guy, as is usually the case in each novel, but also no indication he was not a formidable opponent. I expect he had to wear shoes with lifts in them, and cast bad guys in the 5'9 to 5'11 range. And probably made use of low camera angles to make him look bigger. But however they did things it did not show and was very effective. He really did a fine job being Jack Reacher.

I have never read any of the Jack Reacher stuff, so I do not know if it was true to the story or not.

I'm giving this a 2 star because I didn't hate it, I just didn't like it.  I however would not recommend that anyone wast their time watching this!  While it did have an interesting story, it was poorly executed.",1420070400,,540,3.8378378378378377

Nonetheless, Jack's powers of deduction and drawing on his experience as an investigator  and martial arts expert enables him to overwhelm the bad guys.

5499819,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"OK film, but nothing special.  Lighting was realistic, but the night scenes made it difficult to see the action, especially in the obligatory Reacher-against-overwhelming-odds fight scene.  The chase sequence was better than I expected, though not visceral, say, in the same way that Bullitt was.  The violence is much less than in the book, not necessarily a bad thing, but the musical clues for danger were a little too stereotypical.  Werner Herzog, as the baddie, turns in the best performance; Joseph Sikora, as the hapless sniper, does a creditable job.  Robert Duvall has presence, but it's definitely not one of his best roles, though part of that is the script.  It's hard to see Tom Cruise at 5'7"" pulling off a creditable Jack Reacher, who is supposed to be 6'5"", but he does OK - it's more like watching Billy Jack.  Some of the dialog works, but it's not Cruise's strong point.  The female lead, played by Rosamund Pike, doesn't have much to work with, so it's difficult to evaluate her performance.  I didn't find the movie compelling, while I remember reading the novel in one sitting, not going to bed until much too late.  You can do worse.",1419897600,,1157,4.768844221105527

5499862,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"While the movie doesn't have any unexpected twists (they're hinted at rather obviously early on) or necessarily try for anything new, it is very well done.  Reacher isn't very different from typical Cruise characters, but this makes Cruise better for the role, conveying the confidence of Child's character.  The movie has action, a sad moments, and funny one-liners.  None of these seem over-done, but at the same time, they don't create anything new or elaborate.  I'm glad the fights didn't last longer, as near the end they would seem to be redundant.  The result is a well-paced action/thriller that delivers its humorous moments, has a just-unique-enough hero, and doesn't try too hard.  In the end, it exceeds expectations.  Arguably the best action movie of 2012.",1419811200,,771,5.12

5499925,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"About the only thing that the films Jack Reacher has in common with the books is the name. The differences between the two have been well documented and the ire felt by many of the characters fans at the idea that Tom Cruise had the temerity to even consider the part for himself could be argued to be well-founded.  The most obvious difference, of course, is clear for all to see; Cruise is 5 6 in height compared to Reachers 6 5!  But it doesnt stop there; for example, the movies Reacher is clearly a skilful driver of very fast cars, whereas the books hero can barely drive an old banger in a straight line!

The list could go on and on but whats the point?  This film is a different beast to the book which spawned it and for those who have never read any of the books the arguments one way or the other are totally irrelevant.  As an action movie in its own right its okay and improves immeasurably in the last 45 minutes or so when a truly great actor enters the scene.  Robert Duvall has produced some remarkable performances over the years and though, obviously not now in his prime, still manages to steal the show from Cruises slightly past it action man.  Indeed, it could also be argued that he rescues it from absolute mediocrity.

Okay, Cruise has proved he can do action man/tough guy  but Collateral was made eight years earlier when he was still quite sprightly and barely into his forties: at fifty he only just about convinces in comparison to a real screen tough guy; say, someone like Clint Eastwood who made Pale Rider in his mid-fifties and still looked every inch the part.  The scene in which Reacher is standing around sporting his bare torso thus making Rosamund Pikes character almost swoon by so doing is particularly cringe-inducing.  You could say its a case of a mans Reach[er] clearly exceeding his grasp!

Nevertheless, if you can turn off your brain in order to ignore the occasional silliness, clichs, and clunky plotting it makes for a reasonably satisfying couple of hours if youve got nothing better to do!

You could, of course, if you haven't done so already  try the book!",1419638400,,2115,4.531578947368421

I won't give away the ending, leaving for you tofigure out whether Reacher lives or dies or if he figures oit whodunit.

So evidently my Son did make the connection BUT my Future Son....... and my daughter and I where sitting in the family Rm. and this Movie was going thru the basic..........and I asked is this The Amazon Prime Streaming.............................I been talking about.  He said Yes.  I was just excited to see how this works as obviously I'm NOT the Tech. of the house; as the younger crew has ALL the Knowledge.  So that part so far was a Treat for me and THEN when the movie started I NEVER left my Chair in the Family Rm and I usually can't stay awake beyond 9:45PM or 10PM at the Latest.  The movie ended I believe 12:30AM or going on 1AM. In case you haven't figured out what I'm ab to say (LOL) It Simply was ""The BEST"" movie that got my attention so intently in a LONGGGGGG time and I'm a type of person with a Type ""A"" Personality and virtually impossible to occupy me for that long of a period of time, however; Tom Cruise DID!!!

5500042,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"Being a Jack Reacher"" fan, I was disappointed.  Tom Cruise is too small and of relaxed stature versus my minds vision of a ""military"" and large man.  The leading lady was almost bigger than Tom Cruise! Jack Reacher had been a successful MP for 13 years.  He was the ""guy"" sent out to bring in the ""bad"" marines and navy-seals that didn't want to be brought in.  The movie changed the character qualities of Jack Reacher.  An perfect example is at the end of the movie when Tom C lowers his weapon and fights the ""bad guy"".  The book Jack R believes in hitting first and hard, simply getting it done. Maybe if camera made Tom big as the dwarfs in Hobbit were made small. Tom C tried too hard to be big and confidently tough. The image and the script fell short.  Maybe they should have named the movie something else to lower viewers expectations.",1419292800,4,846,4.384615384615385

Just go into this movie with nothing expected and you'll love it. It will keep your attention from the beginning to the end, as it did mine. Even though I'm not the biggest Tom Cruise fan, I have to say he did a fine job in this one and I would not mind seeing a sequel (Not sure how well it did at the box office, so who knows if they'll make one).

Just watch it.

5500239,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Not your top blockbuster, but a good movie and decent story.
The first time I watched it, I was a little put off by the main character Jack. So much so that I had a hard time getting into it (I need to like my protagonist or I can't root for him). But that's part of who he is, and it is also part of how he tests people.
The second time I watched it I caught a lot more of the subtleties or the things that went by quickly that I glossed over the first time and I understood the character more. (I went in completely blind not knowing anything about the books or character previously)
I've now watched it a third time and liked it as much as the second time. I've watched it 3 times now, that should be review enough.

So for the typical viewer, I expect a 3 or 4 star reception. The movie is good and intriguing, with decent story/conflicts, and good pacing. Acting is good for all characters as it should be with a movie of this caliber.",1418428800,,940,4.081081081081081

Basically he takes his shirt off, flashes his cheesy smile and wait's for every woman in 50 yards to swoon, and impossibly kicks the ass of every bad guy in sight. And for anyone who doesn't know, CID agents are trained to do two things, look somewhat professional in civilian clothes and ask a million annoying questions. I've never seen or heard of one that was a Krav Maga bad*ss or a highly trained sniper.

5500550,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Jack Reacher
 Those of us that appreciate a good rock-um sock-um action flick mixed in with an excellent police procedural will like Jack Reacher.  Some other reviewers hated it but not me.  Maybe they just don't like Tom Cruise.  But this is a good actioner with a twisty plot to satisfy detective drama buffs.  Robert Duvall has a smallish role.  Any movie with Duvall in it is worth watching just to see him at work.
 Christopher McQuarrie both wrote and directed this strong three and a half saw blade film.  McQuarrie is most noted for his writing but he does a perfectly good job as a director in this his second directorial outing.  He has penned the outstanding The Usual Suspects, the less than stellar The Tourist and the recent Tom Cruise WWII movie Valkyrie.
 Writer McQuarrie has written a role for his leading lady that gives her a chance to do something besides look good while being rescued.  As it happens, I just saw Rosamund Pike in another role where all she was called upon to do was to be decorative, which of course she was able to do with no problem at all.  In Jack Reacher she plays a defense lawyer who is on the outs with her father, the prosecutor.  This and the emotional interplay with the uninterested Reacher give Pike a rare opportunity for a leading lady in an action flick to act her sox off and she does.
  This film is based on the book by Lee Child (a pseudonym).  Fans of the Reacher books were put off by casting the diminutive Cruise in the role of the six foot and counting character of Jack Reacher.  Director McQuarrie shoots the film in a way that we never have that issue even occur to us as audience members. Reacher is double tough, quick and ruthless which is just how we like our action anti-heroes.  Jack Reacher stands up well against such popular works in this genre as Taken or Taken II, films that are at the upper end for actioners.
 Jack Reacher is rated PG 13 for lots of violence, all in a good cause.  It runs two hours and ten minutes.  Producer Tom Cruise will no doubt become even wealthier as the film has a budget of $60 million and brought in $18 million in three days worldwide.  If you are in the mood for a serious action flick, this is where you will get your moneys worth this week.",1417219200,,2254,4.380722891566265

The role required a more complex character actor with subtle facial movements and some built in quirks to the personality.
Although the roles are very different, compare David Suchet as a character actor. Suchet studies the development of a character on many levels which then comes across as a truely real person. Cruise doesn't seem to give his roles that depth of study. Whenever I see a Cruise movie I know it will be the same person. As he ""ages"" he still has time to work on character development, perhaps he should get a drama coach for that study. One is never too old to learn something new. Otherwise, Cruise does a predictable job especially with the physical requirements like running and jumping, perhaps that was needed.",1416441600,,949,4.72289156626506

He shows that his character is still a mean lean fighting machine, with believable knockout punches and no tolerance for fools. It's also the classic ""who done it"" with a twist, our guy wants to believe the bad guy has done it again, but he won't ignore the evidence. Good to see Robert Duvall as a back up man who knows Army always needs the Core to save their bacon. Could be a possible buddy movie in the future, as they had great chemistry.

Many say the Reacher character for Tom Cruise is a disappointment because Cruise is too small (as opposed to the book character).  I disagree; his small stature lends to the character.  Think Matt Damon and Jason Bourne.  Unassuming, but both kick butt.

I would have wished for the Duvall character to have kicked a little more butt but that's only the former Marine in me.

5500752,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"A lot of people have complained that Cruise wasn't the man for the job because he wasn't built like the novel character and that he talked too much. I'm glad I dismissed those petty complaints and took a chance or I would have missed out on an excellent action flick.

Did he talk too much, I didn't see that. But as pointed out by another reviewer, there has to be a way in which to convey written unspoken thought onto a primarily vocal medium. Personally, I found the dialogue extremely brilliant. Witty, not predictable, with just the right amount of grit.

As for Cruise being too small to be convincingly intimidating, I disagree there also. He carried the right tone of voice which presented a perfect level of that. No need to yell; speak softly and carry a big stick.

The fight scenes were very well choreographed and the sniper shots realistic.

Want to complain about a real flop compared to the novel? Try seeing Sahara after reading the book. It will make you want to cry. This movie, on the other hand, was very entertaining and Cruise did a superb job.",1415923200,,1068,4.546875

Tom Cruise does a great job in portraying the Jack Reacher character from the book series even though he does not have the same physique (in the book Jack is 6'5"").  He comes across as the same tough character but also shows same moral character that is presented in the book.

5500760,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"It can't be easy to write a screenplay from a Jack Reacher book. The plots often get complicated, the violence is brutal and Reacher himself is a complicated character that takes the reading of at least three books to get to know. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed this movie and I think Tom Cruise gets the job done. He's not the 6'4"" gorilla that Jack Reacher's character is, but you'll quickly forget that and accept him for the role once the punching starts. The sexual tension between Reacher and Helen (Rosamund Pike) is well thought out and not overly done, and Cruise, like Reacher, is deadpan and seldom smiles or laughs. I do wish that they had foregone the PG-13 rating and let the violence more closely match the book, both to demonstrate the brutal nature of Reacher's foes as well as his complete ease with dealing with his foes in a like manner.

5500883,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"JACK REACHER has Tom Cruise as you have never seen him. Tom Cruise is Jack Reacher. Cruise makes this character his. Cruise's Reacher is a thinking mans' too the point blunt instrument and he gets the job done his way and for his motives. It is a very subtle film and that is part of the brilliance here. I went in with low expectations, but I was blown away by JACK REACHER. What a multilayered film of action, drama and suspense. Tom Cruise just keeps getting better with age.

I was totally engrossed by this film. The editing by Kevin Stitt was tight and very effective and Christopher McQuarrie's script with his low key direction gave this a great, yet very subtle narrative sweep. Joe Kraemer's score was old school and it really works here. Robert Duvall continues to demonstrate his brilliance as an actor and almost steals all his scenes, not quite, Duvall enhances them like no other. This film has it all. This film delivers! I have seen this film many times now. Don't let this one get away because it is one of those films that you find yourself returning to!",1414972800,18,1073,4.530927835051546

Even though those of us who have read the Jack Reach Novels can't imagine Tom Cruise playing a character in the book who is something like 6'5"" he actually pulled it off well. I highly recomend watching the movie.",1414540800,,280,4.73469387755102
5500933,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"AWESOME!  Totally came out of left field.  Right when you think Tom Cruise is done picking good movies or even playing his roles well, he comes out with this.  Cool, bad-ass acting/movie.  Nothing new but very entertaining and refreshing.

5500970,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"The character that Lee Child created, 'Jack Reacher', was developed over many years. He was a man 6 feet 5 inches tall, with extra broad shoulders & chest - and he was extremely muscled and strong.  Having a small man, Tom Cruise, play the part of Jack Reacher - is as stupid as having Tom Cruise cast as 'John Wayne'.  Except - Reacher is an inch taller and more physically developed than John Wayne!  What do you expect this movie to be?  Besides a travesty of everything Lee Child carefully developed over the years.  It is a kick in the teeth.  The movie series of Jack Reacher was dead-ended by 'hollywood'. Jewish owned and  controlled movies.

It is true to life as the rest of today's media, TV & movies, that being that NO white male is every depicted as a hero type figure anymore.",1414195200,,791,4.406896551724138

He is a tad too young and not as stocky as the Jack Reacher in the novels. Other than that, the movie met all our expectations and was very enjoyable.

5501071,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I always wonder why people are so surprised by Tom Cruise. From Risky Business to the present he never fails to entertain. This is a movie any true die hard action afficionado will enjoy. Knowing the physical description of Jack Reacher, I was surprised that Tom Cruise was cast but couldn't wait to see what he would do with the part. He never fails when it comes to action stunts and witty comeback.  I only hope that this will become a franchise.  Far better than Taken and Transporter and a couple of others because it doesn't rely on F bombs for dialogue or the exhausted girl in the strip club, girl sold as sex toy, girl with no clothes in the bar needs to be rescued plot to move the story along. The fight scenes were above par and the chemistry with Rosalind Pike was cute and funny at the same time. I would love for there to be a straight to video production company that valued viewers enough to make quality flicks  like this one to view in the comfort of their home.",1413676800,2,981,4.320652173913044

5501187,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"I thought it was going pretty good until Jack Reacher calls the attorney and expects her to believe him over her father.  There needed to be more of a back story for the detective to believe a practical stranger over her own father that quickly.  Also, just because it was Tom Cruise and the audience will usually understand it is Tom Cruise but would those same words work with an unknown actor with the same intensity and equally as thrilling to the public?  Those calls to the attorney with her father present were very cock and used his relationship with the audience in past movies to validate them.  He just should have toned it down 1/2-way and said something to the affect of, ""I know you don't know me that well, but please don't do anything yet to turn me in until after we talk so I can have a chance to prove: ...  What can happen by letting me...  Would it be worth it to you to find out the truth and if I am lying, you can always turn me in at any time in a second. I am the one taking all the risk.  I am not going to re-write the script but she did not appear to be so smitten in love to given him full lead in a few calls.  There were other things but the part re the telephone calls was enough to make me feel like from that point, it made it too easy for Jack Reacher and therefore not enough tension. Just action, action, action without the tension that could have been built. Plus, when you watch a Tom Cruise movie, you expect the unexpected.  From the moment of the call to the attorney with her dad in the room, it was pretty much like any other movie in this genre and there was no plot twists except her dad didn't do it!!

All agree the info in hand leads to the person in custody, so why are people out to do away with Jack Reacher, the loner ex military cop trying to make sense of the evidence in this quirky detective story.

Although Tom Cruise doesn't fit the description of Jack Reacher in the novel, he does an excellent acting job and I hope other Jack Reacher movies make it to the big screen.

5501296,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Jack Reacher is a thriller that is an adaptation from a character of Lee Child's novels. The story is about a murder mystery wherein the wrong guy was caught by the police and Jack Reacher was asked to come in and investigate on who actually did the crime. This film is probably going to be a new movie franchise for Tom Cruise,who currently is filming Jack Reacher 2 as of the moment this review is being written. I think that he is moving away from being Ethan Hunt of the Mission Impossible soon. He could probably be doing its final installment at UK this year. Going back to this film,it was definitely solid and enjoyable despite having a formula-driven story. Cruise did a wonderful job of portraying the main character as it was a great mix of a virtuous justice crusader and a cold blooded killer. Here is hoping that he'll be a better character by having a darker edge in future Reacher installments.",1412035200,,910,4.554878048780488

His height and how it influences folks is an ongoing thread throughout the stories. Tom Cruise and his 5-ft 4-inch shrimpness is void of any of that influence. He comes off as a little punk and is a terrible terrible terrible representation of Jack Reacher. Cruise should go back to being one of the lollipop kids. If I could give a movie negative stars, I wouldn't hesitate to tack on a negative-2 stars.",1411689600,3,516,4.559139784946237
5501313,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"A down to earth character for Tom Cruise.  Much more believable than the later Mission Impossible installments which went beyond feasible, although I enjoy the MI series as well.  My brother went nuts about Jack Reacher and since we live 1100 miles apart I bought it on his recommendation.  I see Jack Reacher as having a future with sequels as long as Tom Cruise reprises the lead role and I enjoyed the intelligence of the detective work.

Everything was believable and enjoyable until the end when Robert Duvall's character, who is supposed to be manly and pro-gun as an X-military gun shop owner, lets Reacher almost get killed more than once.  He's supposed to help Reacher by being an accurate sniper to take out several of the evil guards, but he either reveals he's a panty-waist pacifist as he intentionally misses them while Reacher finishes the job or else he's not very good anymore and can't actually hit them.  I never determined which it was - and that leaves me unfulfilled.

My brother liked it a lot because of the late 60s and early 70s muscle cars which it seems Tom Cruise is actually driving (because they keep his face lighted well in the windshield most of the time) with quite good skills.  He also liked the intelligence of the investigation Reacher does and Tom Cruise actually learning how Olympic shooters and snipers actually shoot.  My brother has a weapon just like the one used at the range in the movie, shoots it regularly, has studied and talked to X-military shooters in detail, and was intrigued and surprised to see Cruise accurately depicting every small detail.

So good story, good casting, accuracy about guns because Tom Cruise demands details be correct in his movies, and an overall excellent movie watching experience - except for the one reason listed above.  Would I buy Jack Reacher 2?  Absolutely.",1411689600,,1848,4.813291139240507
5501314,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Very good mystery for a change, instead of the constant shootem, chasem you see every where now days. It IS bloody, so it isn't Jesse Stone. But at least the characters had to apply some thought as versus fast reaction times, to solve the crime(s) (though the lady lawyer did seem a bit thick headed at times). If you have been properly immunized to lots of gun fire, the show is entertaining--and you probably won't even notice the muzzle flashes and smell of burned powder. Watch for the thug comedy routine in the walkup bathroom. Funny enough to be a Laurel and Hardy on steroids.",1411689600,,584,4.571428571428571

5501318,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"I was pleasantly surprised. The beginning was pretty much exactly as I expected but after the first thirty minutes it improved sufficiently to move from two stars to three. I resisted watching this based on the casting of the lead. The last time one of his characters successfully entertained me he was a navy lawyer looking for the truth. I generally hate his movies and still found this one worth my time.

Cruise just bothers me sometimes. His emotional content seems out of place and contrived. I tried to explain more precisely but my comments kept sounding like I was calling him a sociopath. I believe that would be a bit extreme and altogether unfair so I decided to leave my comments more vague.",1411603200,,704,4.67741935483871

5501331,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"I have personally read all nineteen of Lee Child's Reacher novels, plus most of his short stories. I was excited when I first heard a ""Reacher"" movie was in the works. I couldn't wait to see the action on the big screen.

I can't tell you how disappointed I was when I heard Tom Cruise was to star as Jack Reacher. As far as I was concerned they could not have made a worse choice. Everything was wrong with Cruise portraying Jack Reacher. He was too small, too light and not nearly as rugged looking as he should be.

I refused to pay to watch this movie. In fact, I didn't want to watch it at all until it became available on Amazon Instant Video, It was included free with my Prime membership, so I decided to see if it was as bad as I expected.

Viewing the movie was somewhat painful. It proved to me that I was totally correct in my assessment. Cruise didn't come across as Jack Reacher at all. He looked totally silly standing in the middle of the street surrounded by a bunch of ruffians that towered over him. He looked over matched in most fight scenes throughout the movie.

Although he is probably too old to play the part, I believe Sam Elliot would have made the perfect Jack Reacher. I am not sure who else could have done the part justice, but it certainly was not Tom Cruise.",1411516800,,1292,4.261224489795918

Tom Cruise, no exception. well let me say that after watching Jack Reacher, I was pleasantly surprised and have to tip my hat to Mr. Cruise because the level of acting he portrayed elevated the movie beyond the script. it was so good, time flew by and i was asking at the end, ""is that it? it can't be over?!"" but sadly, it was. he made the movie - he was good, damn good. not hype, but substance - and i for one am glad to see it. i don't know what's been going on lately, but he needs to keep it up. i've seen Oblivion at the theater, essentially a WallE live production, and even when faced with that blatantly obvious comparison, took a chance with my $9.50 and damnit, wouldnt you know it, he did it again!  he gave a kick ass performance that made you not forget, 'disregard' the WallE storyline and stay until the end. Edge of Tomorrow, notwithstanding, was a great idea and he simply made it greater. i have to say, i think we should take another look at Tom Cruise and give him a chance. he is really bringing his A, B and C game to the job and churning out top notch work. he's not like he used to be. maybe it was his divorce? does personal strife lend itself to better emotional performances? no clue. but i always said that whenever phil collins got a divorce, he produced his very best material. tom? stay single a while longer hon. it's lookin real good on you. it truly is.",1411430400,,1644,4.186119873817034

Cruise managed to take a well crafted story and transform it into another episode of Mission Impossible. The movie had little of the ""real"" Jack Reacher appeal.

5501395,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher????

Sorry, doesn't even vaguely resemble the character and I have a hard time imaging 5'6"" Cruise in the fighting scenes.  He's in shape but not a wall. (6'5 of iron).  -Yeah - I know Jackie Chan is small - but his reputation precedes him.

I didn't really think his Mission Impossible character was that believable either.  I quit watching the series after the 1st one.

Remember the guy who won the look alike contest - that's Jack Reacher.

What's really upsetting is now you've made Cruise the Jack Reacher character, he'll continue to be.

I know Cruise is all about box office sales.  To me, Mission Impossible, with Cruise didn't cut it.  I think if you started with a believable character who would half-way act, you would have done better.  Now we're stuck with Cruise forever (SAD).",1411084800,,820,4.704225352112676

I watched with an intensity as the plot unfolded, and watched the thrills with excitement. Wait until you see him handle that old car. I think it was a Dodge Charger. Wait until you see his low key, Reacher-like attitude.

5501431,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"It was okay at best.

I will not give the movie a terrible rating, because in comparison to some, which I could not finish watching, I was able to get through it.  As the movie got closer to the end I had more of a desire to turn it off, however.  I have not read the books, so I unfortunately cannot compare the two.

Perhaps one disadvantage of age is finding that many movies, as well as other forms of entertainment, seems to be simple repeats of everything else.  Don't get this wrong -- I expected that from the movie, but it does get tiring when people who are not the main character are portrayed as helpless and useless.

What kind of idiot throws a firearm down on the ground to ""man it out"" in a fistfight and how many times has this been played out on the screen or in print?

The actors were not at fault for the roles they played nor for the rating I've given this movie.  Regardless of being sick of seeing Tom Cruise, I felt that his as well as most other performers did a good job.  This is part of the reason I simply gave it an ""I didn't like it"" rating.",1410825600,,1073,4.095693779904306

As a former Force Recon Marine, I was very disappointed in some of the stupid things ""Cash"" (a former Marine) said and did in the movie - such as giving Reacher a Kabar knife to defend himself at the quarry (instead of a rifle or handgun) and, most of all, to throw away ANY window of opportunity as a sniper to take out one or more of the bad guys before revealing his presence. His character was really lame. Of course, I have never understood the need to put one's testosterone on display as Reacher did when he threw down his weapon to fight the baddest of the bad guys hand to hand. I guess it made for a good fight scene. In reality, he would simply have taken the guy out and moved on to saving the damsel in distress.",1410739200,,875,4.152941176470589

I really enjoyed the movie and began to read the books by Lee Child on his creation Jack Reacher.  After reading first Jack Reacher novel I was somewhat surprised Tom Cruise played the Reacher character in the film.  This is not to say that Tom Cruise was not great in the role, but according to the author (Lee Child) Jack Reacher is a tall, big and strong individual.  In any case, I found Cruise to be believable as the hard nose, tough ex-military investigator Jack Reacher.

 In this story a suspect of a brutal crime requests to get Jack Reacher.  Needless to say, when Jack begins investigating the crime he is immediately targeted by a group who thinks they can intimidate him and stop him from sticking his nose into police business. The bad guys quickly learn that they have messed with the wrong guy as Reacher does what he does best.  I love this guy's sense of justice and his warrior attitude.

I liked this movie a lot and it is a good introduction to the Jack Reacher character.  I can say that this movie made me begin reading more of Lee Child's Jack Reacher books.

This is not one of those.

I could go into all the reasons why, but here's ONE that ruined any connection with reality immediately. I experienced a sort of cognitive dissonance with the way they chose to display every single (and married haha) woman character drooling over Tom Cruise in this movie. No, really. Literally every waitress, metermaid, and extra was lining up to stare longingly or make a pass at him.

If this were some plot device and his sexiness was important to the plot, even then it would not have worked because it was so over the top. It felt like a forced attempt at convincing us Tom Cruise is still a hottie, and while the man is still virile despite his advancing years, even Gosling and Pitt don't get that kind of play in most movies. So yeah it felt a little forced and weird.

P.S.- I could care less if the guy gets some play, I like some sex in movies. This however felt fake and just F-ed up the flow of the movie.",1410307200,,1053,4.33502538071066

I think this would have faired better in another city, no offense to Pittsburghers, just my opinion. Second, Tom Cruise playing this part 20 years ago would have been appropriate. Today? Not so much. He is simply too old for the part and thus not very believable. If you are a Jack Reacher fan as I have been for many years, you know what I mean.

5501656,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Jack Reacher has almost all the elements it needs to be a really entertaining suspense thriller. It has a great cast of talented actors, interesting cinematography and a story that, while not particularly original, could have stood out if the emphasis was more on interesting dialogue and characters. But it doesn't successfully capitalize on these things and what you're left with is a movie that feels like it veers in and out of being really good.
  Tom Cruise plays the lead with a stoic but darkly ironic sense of humor. It's in his interactions with others that the film is most entertaining and shows it's potential with sparks of good dialogue. The supporting cast is also good but feels a bit wasted. Rosamund Pike is a good leading woman for Cruise, but not given enough complexity to make their relationship really blossom in an interesting way.
  This movie feels like it should have the tone of an Elmore Leonard adaptation where you're happy just to see characters talking to one another. An R rating would have also allowed the more mature elements to pack a harder punch. There are a few moments that come close to that but not enough to salvage the plot, which kind of disappears so that the movie can collapse into a cliched action finale that we've all seen a thousand times over. I don't think it's a bad movie just an uneven one that doeasn't live up to it's potential. Worth a watch for some good moments but it's nothing memorable.",1409270400,,1454,4.66796875

The Jack Reacher novels are based on a character that is 6' 5"" and a tough guy.  How in the world did Tom Cruise get this possible franchise?  He's 5' 7"" with visions of grandeur!  I hope Cruise is a one-off and I hope Lee Child doesn't sell the story rights if he plays the part no matter how much money he puts up. Dwayne Johnson would have been better and more believable.  Having said all that I had to watch to see how much of the story line was followed and I must say it follows the book quite well.  Great story.  Go read it.

Cruise sells a part he's not really a physical match for, Oyelwo does a solid job, and Duval shows up to just duval around a little, which is always fun. Rosamund Pike is a non-entity, though, and is done no favors by a story that demands little of her other than to be a step behind Reacher all the time and occasionally need rescuing. The story is a stack of implausibilities that wasn't actually very interesting in its unwinding and the villain, while presumably threatening, actually came across as a styleless, humorless version of The Penguin. Jack Reacher, as a character, is terrible. But, there are some decent action scenes, I liked the car chase, and Tom Cruise takes his shirt off and punches a bunch of dudes in the balls (not at the same time), so it wasn't a complete wash.",1409270400,,877,4.628205128205129

5501678,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"There are many reviews that have clearly stated the premise of the film and the various actors, etc., so I really don't need to reiterate all of that.  What I do want to say is that I don't believe Robert Duvall has ever given a bad performance in his life! He is simply flawless.  If that man were selling weeds to plant in your yard, I'd buy 'em!  Sure! Who doesn't need a few weeds in your yard?  He's so natural and believable and convincing.  All the other actors were acting.  Mr. Duvall was simply ""in the moment.""

As for the rest of the movie - it was okay for what it was: an action film. It was formulaic. And if you've read any Jack Reacher books, you know he shows up, wears the same clothes the whole time (except for what he washes in the sink of the motel he stays in) - then when they get too grubby, he tosses them and gets a new outfit.  In the books, there's a woman he usually ends up romancing and leaves at the end of the story (love 'em and leave 'em) when he's on a bus out of town, but in the movie we were spared the gratuitous sex scenes (unless they happened while I was fixing a sandwich or something); there's plenty of action for those who like it - fast driving, some fights (so you don't want little children watching); and some great shots of Pittsburgh! [I've driven many of those same streets many times!]

I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan, but I think he did a good job of portraying an ex-military cop.  Again, if you read the books, you just have to get past the author's physical description of Jack Reacher: 6'5"" -- and let Mr. Cruise bring the true persona of the character to life. After all, not many actors are 6'5"" tall anyway, so I don't think we should hold that against him. That seems rather sophomoric.

But, again, it was Robert Duvall and the scenery of Pittsburgh that made it enjoyable for me.",1409097600,,1846,4.215909090909091

The changes to the story were good and not to drastic and the other characters were cast as good as any I might have expected, I honestly liked the range master/old guy at the end of the book better in his movie version than his book version. I'd watch this again and picked it up since I'd like to have this as part of my bit to large collection.

The story is an entertaining one and if you like procedural cop type mysteries then you are likely to like this character.

5501706,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"The starting point is that a military sniper has killed five people at random. A lawyer--who is, by
way, an extraordinarily beautiful woman--is defending him, so we don't like her, we think. After
all, look at what he did. Then Tom Cruise enters the picture--a brilliant and charismatic
professional stranger--who suggests that it really isn't what it looks like. In typical movie
fashion, she fights him on that, but can't help being attracted to him.

And so on. It's very suspenseful, with excellent direction and performances. I love in
particular one scene in which five guys gang up on Cruise in a bar with the idea of beating
him up very, very badly. It's always interesting when they're so savage, so sure of
themselves (after all, it's five against one), so corrupt. And then it's very amusing what
happens.",1409011200,,816,4.870503597122302

What saved the day as far as performances was Rosamund Pike, the co-star.  She really should have been the star of the show.  She did a great job.  We would definitely recommend sitting down and watching this film even though it had the over done car chase and fight scenes.

5501734,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I really liked this movie as personally though I don't know a lot about the Jack Reacher character (what I got was from this movie and one of the reviews), there's enough of the character in the acting and plot to make it a very enjoyable movie. One of the reviewers complains that Tom Cruise's Jack Reacher is too much like Ethan Hawke, but I didn't see it that way at all (though I've never read a Jack Reacher book, I have to compare I admit so don't have that to bother me).

I thought Tom Cruise did an excellent job at portraying the comic booky type character he was playing (I assume), where he is always in complete control (basically), no matter how bad (dangerous) the action is he's always very cool and competent. And I really liked Robert Duvall's old Marine sniper thought he added a lot to the movie too and the Lawyer babe was basically perfect I thought it was amazing how she got the American accent down perfectly even though she grew up in Great Britain.",1408838400,,975,4.386740331491713

The movie is complex. Lots of details unfold. You have to watch it. And for me it was hard as they were rattling off all these facts in a whisper it seemed a lot of the time. After some amazing observations by Reacher and the movie moving along I honestly just got lost. I was doing something else while watching it. But that usually isn't a problem. It was that this movie deals with complex details. I will almost swear to the fact that the one scene of the shack house on the hillside was the exact same house that they used in ""Reckless"". Also the people in this movie are not very nice. The circumstances behind them isn't nice either. So if you are looking for a feel good ending you won't find it in this movie with these folks, in my opinion. I mean it was kinda icky all over to me.",1408233600,,1040,4.274111675126903

As for the story line, they totally screwed that up too. I went back and have now read all of the Jack Reacher novels. They changed this story line around A LOT. It wasn't necessary.

Although it strayed from the book, as most movies do, it was highly entertaining.  Thanks, Mr. Cruise for bringing the Reacher novels to the forefront.  Thanks, Amazon for making the DVD available at a decent price.",1407024000,,336,4.741379310344827

5502053,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I thought this was a great movie. I know some of you won't watch it, or will judge it before you see it  merely because it stars Tom Cruise, but you'll be missing out. Jack Reacher is packed full of action, suspense, some mystery and just enough humor to not make it corny. This is actually one of my favorite Tom Cruise movies in recent time.",1407024000,,343,4.196969696969697
5502054,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Good movies with a lot of action. One scene a little hokey( of Jack being attacked in the bath tub). Good plot and pretty good acting. Cruise maybe a little too cool and way too smart. Still like to see how he took out the cop hiding behind Helen in the construction trailer. That was pretty well hidden. I have never been able to use closed captioning with amazon movies. Why is that? They should realize that older people need CC especially with modern movies that have fast conversations and WAY too much background music and noise.,1407024000,,535,4.525773195876289

There is plenty of action that takes place throughout the movie as soon as Reacher arrives on the scene to investigate and wrap it up.

Tom Cruise on the other hand is 5'7"" at his best and wearing platform shoes. He also weighs about 150. Tom needs to find another area of films to play other than action hero. Most people aren't buying it and the movies are flopping. I think he we cast well in ""All the right moves"" but that was when he was young.",1406851200,,430,4.070588235294117

5502091,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"A good action drama, especially if you are a Tome Cruise fan. I like tough guy movies. This one meets my expectations. The character seems to have taken some of the silly childishness out of Tom's usual acting style. The plot has enough quality tension and puzzle to it to keep you interested. I enjoyed watching Jack Reacher cleverly sort through the evidence and stay a step ahead of the cops. It has a good surprise twist at the end, too. I enjoyed it.",1406851200,,455,4.428571428571429

The twists weren't that hard to anticipate, and the plot moved along standard ""best selling novel"" lines without originality in concept or script.

5502173,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"This movie was terrible. We laughed often at scenes that were not supposed to be funny. To sum it up, I'd say this movie concept must have been furiously fondled by Tom Cruise who was obviously interested in shoring up his former heartthrob image.  Needless to say, it didn't work, and the result is a black eye for Cruise's career, the director's career, the film editor's career, and so on. Yes, there were other actors in this movie, and like old Tom, they were just as bad. Films like this make little people, like myself, wonder about the great fortune this failure took to make! Instead of making a low- quality, expensive film, perhaps invest in the writers! Have honest scruples and refuse to make celebrity vehicle films. There's nothing more sad than to watch an aging person (in any profession) grasping to hold on to youth. No one is fooled and everyone loses.",1406332800,4,872,4.662337662337662

Great fights, like the 5 on one at the bar, with some of the best ""tough talking"" you will hear in a movie, best because it is also the most humble ""tough talk"" you will hear almost like he is tired of kicking people's tails.  One of the best one liners I can remember, when the lawyer bails him out of jail after the bar fight Jack says ""did anyone die?"" the cop says ""no"" Jack then says ""Good,cause if they did they, died of shame, cause I took it easy on them.""  It is good stuff.

The phone conversation with the antagonist over the kidnapped lawyer is super; it is some good writing.  Then the fight with the antagonist (hand to hand as Jack had promised him) is excellent; everyone gets hurt in that fight unlike so many movie fights where the good guy is never hurt or tired, this one looks real and incorporates a move I remember from Marine Corp boot camp hand to hand combat to finish the sorry piece of work off.  It was a satisfying end to the bad guy(s).

Very watchable - and bears repeat viewing.,1405728000,,348,5.12280701754386

5502270,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Much better film than I thought it would be...I am a Jack Reacher fan of Lee Childs' novels, and didn't see it in the theater because I couldn't picture Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher. From his persona in the novel series, the part had to be played by someone 6'4' and built like a professional soldier. Not that I don't like Tom Cruise, I do, but I just couldn't see him in this role. The film was exciting,well paced, and Cruise did a good job despite the height and size issues. Enjoyed it very much.",1405641600,,499,4.2631578947368425
5502271,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I have read all of the books in the Jack Reacher series and I was all set to be critical of the movie since Tom Cruise is not the big hulking Jack Reacher of the books.

5502272,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Not the best Cruise film but, it has a pretty good story line, though a bit thin at times. Some good action scenes, intrigue, and a little humor at times, some may not have been intended. Could have been a better story if a stronger connection to why Reacher is whom he is.

A good rental movie if can be had for less than $5.00. Conversation can be tolerated through most of the movie without missing to much. Not Cruise's best. Just another paycheck for him.",1405641600,,460,4.348837209302325

The only problem I had in this (No Spoiler) is the city building (I don't know if it was the Police building or city official building or what exactly but it was a Gov't building) had no cameras in or around the elevator. My dad worked for the gov't for 20 years almost and in their building, one thing I always noticed going to work with him was the cameras in the elevators.",1405641600,,480,4.172043010752688

5502313,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"I can see why Tom Cruise wanted to play this role, but Reacher is 6'4"" and Tom is 5'7"".  Reacher's height and size is part of the essence of his character and there is no way that a shorter actor is ever going to be able to portray this.  Cruise does an adequate job of portraying some of the other facets of Reacher's character, but there's no way to duplicate the characteristics of a vastly taller man.  So many of the other facets of Reacher's character derive from his size...I'll give Cruise credit for trying but this is not his role.  I'd say his ego got in the way of his best judgement on this one.",1405468800,,608,4.2155172413793105

5502319,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Pretty good adaptation of the Lee Child novel ""One Shot"" into a movie. I had concerns that Tom Cruise could not pull off the Jack Reacher character, since Reacher is 6'5"" and weighs 240 lbs. in the books, whereas Cruise is what, 5' 8"" and 160 lbs? But it wasn't an issue, except during fight scenes, which seemed unbelievable, and the scenes with Cruise bare-chested. You never see the trademark Cruise smile, mostly he's stoic and serious throughout the movie. Still, they should have cast someone else as Jack Reacher. Bad guys have a different approach to a guy that is 6' 5"" vs. a guy that is 5' 8"". I hope if they do another Reacher movie they get someone else to play him.",1405382400,,678,4.432

I understand the concept of the Reacher books (when books are brought to the screen they loose something) but in this film the bad guys are just sick.
Really the only thing this film got right was the location. Listen up Hollywood - Pittsburgh is an ideal setting - use it more often (the rest of the world is so tired of New York, LA and Chicago - we'd like something new). Really I'd save my money (good thing it was free on Prime) and see something that would you make you laugh.

5502404,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"Thank you, Tom Cruise. Thank you for letting us view your fantasies through film. Was this based on a comic or graphic novel made from the books? That is the only way I can tolerate the type of set up and cheesy portrayal. The intro, the camera framing, and the dialogue made this into an incredible live action comic. The problem is Tom Cruise seems like he is trying to make his character believable.
""Get Jack Reacher"". Who is this mystery man? A military super man, knows everything, capable of everything, shows up and disappears when he pleases. They should have made him a cyborg or android or something. I would have been able to accept that given his character. Good lord, ""Who are you, mister? Really?"" ""I'm just a guy who wants to be left alone"".
 I'm not a movie prick. I loved the original Payback with Mel Gibson. For me, Tom Cruise was too quality for this flick, for the script and the plot. It's like he was attempting to push this film from one genre into the next, all by himself. Maybe he didn't realize it.
 That said, I plan to finish this movie (half way through now) and enjoy it. Watch it like a vigilante comic (eg. Punisher) and you can enjoy it too. I never read the books, maybe this is an accurate portrayal. Just doesn't mesh on film.",1404864000,,1265,4.401709401709402

Not much of a who-done-it, since the truth is revealed to the viewer early on, leaving the movie to be propped up by the action alone much of the time.

5502422,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"The iconic Tom Cruise has seemingly re-invigorated his career with his role as JACK REACHER (2012), the central character from Lee Child's novels (there are 17 of them currently!). Directed by Christopher McQuarrie (an Oscar winner for writing the Screenplay to ""Usual Suspects""), ""Jack Reacher"" is a sharp, smart, intricate tale about a veteran Army MP officer Jack Reacher (Cruise), who in his retired civilian life lives as an off-the-grid drifter, aimlessly wandering from town to town, living off his pension, and using his investigative skills and street smarts to survive sticky situations. Reacher is summoned into Pittsburgh when one of his former military acquaintances, a former Army sniper named Barr, is framed for killing 5 innocents at a local square. Reacher is assigned as the primary investigator working alongside Barr's attorney Helen Rodin (persuasively played by gorgeous Rosamund Pike). Opposed to Reacher and Helen are the lead police investigator Det. Emerson (confidently played by Dvid Oyelowo) and the District Attorney Rodin (excellently played by film vet Richard Jenkins), who is also Helen's father. Also look out for a wonderful supporting turn by the great Robert Duvall!

The film boasts a throwback style of summer action storytelling, reminding viewers more of 80s action vehicles rather than the CGI-heavy modern films. In fact, there is virtually no CGI (that I can tell) in any of the action and Cruise actually performs all his own stunts (in particular the fight scenes and car chase scene). Also, using a more traditional working class city like Pittsburgh as the film's setting really gives it a down-to-earth quality and charm that would have been absent had the film been shot in either New York or L.A.

Cruise is extremely likable and convincing as a world-weary, insightful, intelligent tough guy, who also displays moments of true humanity at various points in the film. Reacher is great at ""reading"" people and sizing them up as soon as he meets them, and it comes across as entirely believable in Cruise's mannerisms. body language, and eye movement. A very unique role for Cruise and a very entertaining ""thinking person's"" summer film!",1404691200,,2189,5.215909090909091

5502449,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I don't know which book in the Jack Reacher series this movie represents, but then if I had read the series I would know.  The movie has sparked my interest in the series by Lee Child.

The movie is standard Tom Cruise fare.  Supernaturally superhero action adventure.  Nothing really wrong with the story or the movie for that fact being that it is what it is.  I like this kind of movie so I was enthralled.  Twice.

I'd forgotten I had watched it, what? a year and a half ago... come to think of it, that may not be a good recommendation for the movie. But the truth is, that could just as easily be about me rather than the movie. In fact the entire reason for writing a review is I keep them so I can easily check to see if I've watched something... If I've written a review... which I didn't do the first time.

A man is framed for a murder and it seems open and shut case  He asks for Jack Reacher who is a ghost, not to be found.  But he shows up right on cue, out of the blue.  That's where we get our first good look at Rosamund Pike (Helen, the attorney for the accused).  Oh my.  I must not have been paying attention the first time I watched.  This woman is a beauty.  How I didn't notice the first time around is a shame on me.  It really is standard action/adventure fare as Jack Reacher beats his way into more and more information, until he draws the attention of the real killer who then sets up Reacher as well as the first framed murder.  Then Jack is defending the innocent while also trying to keep his own hide from law enforcement.

That's all I'll say, Tom Cruise is the hero... action/adventure fans should put 2 and 2 together there-after.

Lee Child wrote a number of Jack Reacher books, and while I haven't read any I'm confident there is plenty of material to have this become a franchise with several movies.

I offered 7 on IMDB, 4 here on Amazon, where I watched it btw.  Well, 4 is 'really liked it', and I did.",1404518400,,1945,4.188679245283019

Cruise does a decent job of playing a very intense ex-army guy, but it seems like he wants to be Liam Neeson in Taken, or some version of Jason Borne. I think it works for this movie, but it certainly doesnt reach the status of what Im comparing it to.

Jack Reacher is an OK rental with some decent action and decent car chase. Honestly though, any other decent actor could have done the same job Cruise did. I know he is capable of better.",1404086400,,537,4.203883495145631

5502507,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Three and a half INTERESTING Stars overall; Five Stars for the thrilling action sequences at the end of this film adaptation of author Lee Child's novel ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-Shot-A-Jack-Reacher-Novel/dp/0345538196/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One Shot: A Jack Reacher Novel</a>"". As an action hero, Tom Cruise brought 4 ""Mission Impossible"" movies to the screen to the tune of $2Billion total for the franchise and established himself as an action hero even before that with SciFi epics like ""Minority Report"" and ""War of the Worlds"", and more recently ""Oblivion"" and ""Edge of Tomorrow"", among others.  Jack Reacher fans know author Child's physical description of Mr Reacher very well: really big, tall, muscular, strong, and smart. So Cruise taking on such an admired tough guy role in Jack Reacher brings ""muscular, strong, and smart"" to the role, but even author Child was won over in the end. My one encounter with Jack Reacher was years ago in Lee Child's book ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hard-Way-A-Jack-Reacher-Novel/dp/0440246008/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hard Way: A Jack Reacher Novel</a>"" and Cruise is not the Jack Reacher-type specified there. Nonetheless, Hollywood sometimes has a way of making it work, amid the many failures of other actors and roles, and Cruise works himself comfortably into the role as the movie proceeds. He is considerably helped along by the contrasts with some nasty bad guys and some nice acting and eye-candy from British actress Rosamund Pike. Also, there is a surprise cameo by one of our greatest actors who 'ups the ante' considerably while getting some GREAT one-liners to emote: I won't identify him but his casting was brilliant and the interaction between this actor and Cruise is excellent. The film's slow pace drags at times, but persevering to the end will pay off in the climactic face-offs. Then the writer leaves a Reacher 'calling card' at the very end. Viewers will want to go back to the beginning to watch those opening scenes again to fill in the blanks. Also starring Werner Herzog, Richard Jenkins, and David Oyelowo. Definitely Recommended, even to Reacher fans. Three and a half CREDIBLE Stars (Amazon Direct Video: 2 hours and 10 minutes.)",1404086400,,2312,5.605714285714286

Tom Cruise is nowhere near the book character.  And one of Jack Reacher's characteristics is he does not like to drive and considers himself a poor driver.  So the car chase scene is all for film fans and not fans of the book series.  Tom Cruise is a popular actor, but too small and not enough of a contained  roughness.  Too bad.  I'll stick with the books.",1403308800,,491,4.415730337078652

5502592,3,B00AS1Q8FW,I thought the movie was good for an action movie.  It is much better than the current Tom Cruise movie because it is more realistic.  I picked it because it was my husband's turn to pick the movie and he likes action movies.,1403308800,,224,4.186046511627907

Cruise can still bring it, but what really made this thing go was he and Rosamund Pike, who had really good screen chemistry.

However I was quite surprised how he actually convinced me he was military trained man.  With lots of unexpected twists and turns, it's a good thriller/action movie. Robert Duvall rounds out the cast and gives the movie a weight it otherwise wouldn't have.  I really liked this one and it's not Mission Impossible all over again. He plays a different character in this one and had me convinced and I think this would make a great franchise for him at this point in his career.",1403136000,2,568,4.485436893203883

5502612,3,B00AS1Q8FW,The Jack Reacher character is almost magical.  He appears by magic without being called.  He thinks nothing of singlehandedly beating up a half-dozen thugs at once at once with his bare hands.  This is a movie about cheering the good guy as he routs the forces of evil.  I guess we all need a dose of that once in a while.,1403136000,,322,4.229508196721311

I have to admit to being very skeptical when I heard Tom Cruise was going to play the part.  In the books, Reacher is 6'5'' tall and is a very imposing figure.  I didn't think Cruise could pull it off.  To my pleasant surprise he does.  He nails the character's attitude and demeanor which makes you forget his lack of physical stature.

Also, Tom Cruise, while a good actor, is not Jack Reacher.  He cannot begin to duplicate the physical characteristics of the character from the books.

When I've had a rough day at work, it's always good when I know that I can crack the cover on a Jack Reacher tale that I've not yet read - and hearing that there is a *new* 'Jack Reacher' tale about to be released is almost a *SURE* way to put a glow on my entire week.  Having said that, I was SICKENED & *HORRIFIED* when I learned that some *SICK*, *PERVERSE* Hollywood @$***** had cast Cruise (aka ""Hollywood's half-pint HEADCASE""!!) as Jack Reacher.

This is roughly the equivalent of casting Ted Nugent as Barack Obama, John Wayne Gacy as Charlie Brown, or Dick Cheney as John Lennon in a Beatles retrospective...  And judging by Cruise's box-office numbers lately, I am *FAR* from alone in this opinion.",1402790400,,776,4.4822695035460995

I couldn't quite grasp why Cruise stumbled around babbling incoherently until the scene where he is bashed in the back of the head with a bat. At that point I realized Tom Cruise was portraying the ""Reacher"" character for hilarity due to ""Reacher's"" Iraq induced Traumatic Brain Injury.
All things being equal, ""Jack Reacher"" provides everything the action movie audience is looking for. To wit: Tom Cruise getting the s*** kicked out of him for 90 minutes.",1402790400,,529,5.0227272727272725

Certainly not soul rattling.  But, there's enough action and hints at a back story to make this movie worth seeing on Amazon Prime.  If I had paid $15/ticket, I think I'd have been disappointed.

5502641,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"I enjoyed it as an adventure film, but it is not really Jack Reacher.
Tom Cruise attempts (quite well all things considered) to pull off playing some one with the stature of Jack R, and it is only his skill as an actor that manages to generate a ""presence"" despite his lack of size.
The bigger issue was the the occasion when the story line went in a direction diametrically opposite to what Jack R would have done. In the books he states that he will take an advantage he can get and use it to the full. He would not throw away a perfectly good firearm and then go toe to toe with his enemy - very un-Jack. That was the bit that did it for me.
Having said all that, it was a good thriller type film. Tom C did fine and Mr. D was entertaining.
I would love to see more Jack R, but only if closer to the books.",1402704000,,809,3.9693251533742333

5502644,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I thought hard about whether this is re-watchable or not. Yes, I will want to see it over and over. It's more realistic than some of the crazy Mission Impossible plots. I like the character that Tom plays, and that's really important. Unlike some actors who seem to choose their roles solely to make a name for themselves as able to play any part, Tom like John Wayne stays within a certain on-screen persona. This is a really good one, in many ways better than Mission Impossible, because his role is believable.

Robert Duvall and Tom have great chemistry. I like Robert in the kind of role he plays in this movie. The female lead is good, but since she's not a superstar I don't recall her name. Still, not to knock her; no complaints. If she had overacted, or underacted, I would say so, but she does fine; I just don't remember her name. She is just a lawyer damsel in distress, not a lot of range for her in that part.

5502656,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Better than I thought...having read all the Lee Child Jack Reacher books, and knowing that part of Reacher's persona is his 6'5"", 250 lb physical presence, I was sure I wouldn't be able to relate to Tom Cruise (mini-Reacher?) in the role.

The other day, however, I saw the book on a friend's table, and asked if they were Lee Child fans. They then asked if I'd seen the movie and I said no, and why. They said it was great, and had seen it multiple times, so I said I'd try it. Having just gotten a new Roku 3, Jack Reacher became my first Amazon Prime streaming 'watch'.

I was surprised - I thought the movie was involving, and Tom Cruise brought Reacher's attitude and capability, if not his size. I wonder if they shot him standing on a box, the way they did with Alan Ladd in ""Shane""...",1402444800,,792,4.273333333333333

Reacher is described as blond, 6'5"" tall, not really so handsome as rugged in a well lived in body.  Apart from the fact that the only similarity was age, I wasn't thrilled.  I will say that Mr. Cruise did a commendable job and I'm sure if no other movie goer had read the book, he would have enjoyed the man's performance. I still think ""Top Gun"" was his best to date.",1402444800,,479,4.3

5502659,3,B00AS1Q8FW,Engaging plot but wish I'd never read a Jack Reacher book before seeing this.  Tom Cruise needs to stick to scripts he can make his own.  Very distracting to try to force him into my pre-created image of Reacher.,1402444800,,212,4.410256410256411

If you enjoy the Jack R character then I recommend that you get the audio books(unabridged) with the Jack Reacher Character is well developed, worthwhile listening, I do mine on the treadmill, you will forget you are even on it.
The best thing is all about the plot and the way Mr. Child presents it through Jack R eyes....... killer.

Cruise's portrayal as well.  I also enjoyed the fact that they were smart enough to cast
Robert Duvall to work with Tom.  With a tough guy like Jack Reacher around, the bad

In the Lee Child books, Jack Reacher is a tall, imposing character. These traits play into the character in significant ways as the series plays out.  Tom Cruise's diminutive stature made it difficult for me to really get into the story.

The acting is strength of this film that makes it worthwhile to watch. Tom Cruise, Rosamund Pike, Robert Duvall, David Oyelowo, Werner Herzog, Jai Courtney, and Joseph Sikora were good in their roles.

More seriously, I am having a hard time explaining why I think it was just OK. I think it was because there were moments when my suspension of disbelief failed, and I found myself thinking about whether things that happened were gratuitous or needed for the story. Rosamund Pike's character reminded me too much of one of the DA's from the original Law and Order Series. You can hear ""Kreacher"" in the name JackReacher; Kreacher was a Harry Potter character. This is relevant only insofar as I felt like the name was too staged because, by the end, it is related to the commonality between the hero and the villain. The elements of lack of suspension of disbelief and a feeling like the author or the writers were trying to hard made the film not as engaging for me as I would have liked it to be.

I might watch this again.",1401235200,,1135,4.5

5502729,5,B00AS1Q8FW,Wonderful! Good movie all around. Jack was well played by Cruise and I enjoy watching the movie over and over. I will recommend it to people that are into Lee Child as well as those who are into a different view of crime mysteries. Well put together cast and writing.,1401148800,,267,4.36
5502730,4,B00AS1Q8FW,I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise but this is the best movie I have ever seen with Tom. His acting was actually pretty good. He seems to get better with age.,1401148800,,155,3.727272727272727

5502733,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Based on the Lee Child's action novel:One Shot Some very good detective work by Tom Cruise and martial art fights.
Cruise does a pretty good rendition of Jack Reacher, but the book is much better!  Robert Duvall jumps in and saves Reacher's butt near the movies end!  The one problem I had with the movie was  Rosamund Pike.  She's sexy and cute but miscast.  It slows down the action with her drooling over Reacher and her terrific cleavage.  Also, there are several stories going on at the same time along with multiple villians. MAtt Damon would do better in this role. If you just are interested in action.shootem up/and kick butt...this is worth a watch...once!",1401062400,,666,4.747826086956522

My main objection here is casting. We find tiny Tom Cruise as Reacher who is described as a very large and powerful man. Cruise just doesn't have the physical presence to pull it off. However, Robert Duval's performance was outstanding, as usual.",1400889600,,391,4.444444444444445

5502746,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"I wanted very much to like this movie but I could not make myself finish it. I just did not care what happened to any character in the movie. It was so predictable. I really like Tom Cruise.  I like good bad movies, so terrible you can't turn away like ""Face Off"" and I like good action movies like Mission Impossible (the first one) or Minority Report. His character ""Jack Reacher"" could be very interesting like a new age Phillip Marlowe or Sam Spade but its not. Jack Reacher is less than one dimensional, he has been so successful at vanishing there is nothing left of his personality. He is the pancake man.  The victim scenes are so heavy-handed it's like being slapped upside the head by the Hulk. The scene with the filmy-eyed ol' Russian in the warehouse and his obligatory tale of toughness from his time in Siberia is just ridiculous. Our Hero, Jack Reacher has to have his name said a minimum of 500 times like the Rumpelstiltskin of franchising. Alexia Fast stands out as a small town, good-looker in with the wrong crowd, desperate for attention. She reminds me of the sad/bad gals Lizbeth Scott played.",1400630400,,1117,4.58
5502747,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"It was a good, clean, funny at times. It kept your interest, it had plenty of action, no offensive scenes which was an unexpected plus. I would recommend this as an action movie with an easy plot to keep you guessing 'who dun it'.",1400630400,,230,4.25

Cruise reminds me of a James Bond type of character, tough, hip, smooth and in control. The story revolves around a former Army sniper arrested for the killing of 4 people. The case against the sniper is ""air tight"". There is only one problem he didn't do it and someone has framed him.",1400544000,,444,4.2976190476190474

5502761,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"With conversations, that make you feel like watching a tennis match and cliche's galore. It was somewhat entertaining. But another low for Mr. Cruise. I'm not sure how many more of his movies I can sit through. His co-star, the female Attorney, has the same problem. Cameo shots, dumb conversations. Overacted. Who's writing this crap!
Overall, it's watchable, if you don't take it seriously. But not very high on my scale.",1400457600,,423,4.971830985915493

5502787,4,B00AS1Q8FW,I read the book some years ago. The movie stays pretty close to the original story line. Cruise pulls off the character pretty well.

5502792,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I had resisted seeing this movie because I'd gotten a little tired of the Tom Cruise Machine, and I only took a shot at it when I found it last night on free Prime Instant Video. And you know what? I'm really glad I did.

If you are a guy, even add a bonus half star. If you're a guy who likes Lee Child, the author who created the Jack Reacher persona, make it a full bonus star. And if you like movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Road-House/dp/B00FJULE92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Road House</a>&nbsp;and, heck, just about any Clint Eastwood flick, then what are you doing reading this review? Rent the movie already!

This wasn't always the case: when news of Cruise's casting reached Child's fans, there was a good deal of disapproval, based largely on the diminutive star's height. But Cruise was Child's choice, and upon its release most fans recanted that opinion...and I must say I agree. Tom Cruise carries out the portrayal well, giving Reacher his characteristic full-on intensity and drive - and Cruise added to that persona by performing all of the driving stunts himself.

Without giving away ANY plot details, I'll tell you this: the movie starts with a sinister, brutal action sequence and never really lets up, and that's saying something, because Cruise doesn't even show up for the first fifteen minutes. But when he does the movie doesn't skip a beat: Reacher's almost legendary loner-ism and unbreachable ""code"" is characterized extremely well by Cruise, and his strength of character really powers the film, making you believe that Reacher is a thinking man's John McClain, an almost mythical zen hero like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Billy-Jack/dp/B00HV2PR1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Billy Jack</a>&nbsp;was from the early 1970s.

And it's not just Cruise that makes this film what it is: Werner Herzog makes an extremely wicked villain, and powerful supporting performances by the capable Rosamund Pike, the relatively unknown David Oyelowo, and the always marvelous Richard Jenkins really turn up the dramatic heat.

And look for Robert Duvall to show up in an absolutely fantastic character role just when you've forgotten you saw his name in the credits.

To conclude: while REACHER did not perform up to Cruise's typical box office clout, it did well enough (over $200 million internationally) to warrant an upcoming sequel (from Child's novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Never-Go-Back/dp/0440246326/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Never Go Back</a>).

The movie is a bit slow in developing, and it may not be for everyone. However, I really enjoyed it, so much so that I got the first several books and have started reading them.

Although Tom Cruise doesn't physically fit the description of the Reacher character in the book, I thought Cruise did a really good job in the role, and I hope he makes more Reacher movies.

Reacher is a former military man, recently discharged, who wanders around the country trying to be left alone, but keeps running into situations where he is needed to step in and solve crimes or combat conflicts.

It is like a mix between a Bourne Identity type of movie with Sherlock Holmes.

Car chases, fist fights in the rain, popping around a corner and shooting with pinpoint accuracy without aiming, every woman in the movie (even 60 year old ladies who work at Western Union) who interacts with Tom Cruise gives him the, ""Oh yeah, he is soooo hot"" look. Overall this is a pretty cheesy movie.....",1399766400,,447,4.818181818181818
5502803,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I was glued to my seat.  Good plot.  And Tom Cruise always a favorite.
Jack Reacher was a multi-layered character",1399766400,,113,4.6

5502808,5,B00AS1Q8FW,I really enjoyed the movie.  I like Tom cruise and he was very good in it.  Jack Reacher is a great character.,1399593600,,110,3.9545454545454546

5502812,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Too many loose ends for my taste.  Though I admire and appreciate Mr. Cruise's abilities, this did not showcase his talent.  Lee Child may have been pleased but I was not.  Very clichd and predictable, perhaps too much to condense and make sense.",1399507200,,246,4.674418604651163
5502813,4,B00AS1Q8FW,...from the beginning and throughout.  Looking forward to a sequel.  Tom Cruise does a nice job and Robert Duvall is blast as usual.,1399507200,,132,4.695652173913044

5502816,4,B00AS1Q8FW,I thought this was well done.  A little Pelican Briefissssh.  I do like that they did not make it into a sappy love affair with Rosamund Pike it would have taken away from the story line.,1399420800,,187,4.166666666666667
5502817,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Another in a long line of action adventure movies. This one was enjoyable and could easily result in followup movies,1399420800,,116,4.85

5502820,4,B00AS1Q8FW,I have read the Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child and was very disappointed in the casting of Tom Cruise.  I will say that he played the character very well and the movie is definitely worth seeing.,1399420800,,197,4.324324324324325
5502821,3,B00AS1Q8FW,Tom turns a pretty dynamic character into a wooden performance. I like the Jack Reacher novels but Cruise's performance takes all the life out of the character.,1399420800,,160,4.962962962962963
5502822,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Not a huge Tom Cruise fan by any means but he did a decent job in this flick. I would recommend that people give it a shot.,1399420800,,123,3.5925925925925926

 I Didn't even finish watching the whole movie.",1399420800,,118,4.85
5502824,3,B00AS1Q8FW,So so movie!! Save your money.has some problems with his way of action movie format.not his style of movie for him.,1399420800,,115,4.523809523809524

5502826,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"For a while I have not enjoyed Tom Cruise movies because the action was a bit unbelievable.  But this one was very good.  Story line was right on, and he played it low keyed and the action was as it should be for the story.  Enjoyed it for an old lady like me.",1399334400,,260,3.8679245283018866
5502827,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"I had time to relax and watch a movie and this was available on amazon prime so I gave it a shot. I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan but he's pretty good in this. The story is interesting with a sniper attack early in the movie and Jack Reacher investigating the case. It takes a few twists and the story and the action are all entertaining. Nothing great but if you'd like a decent suspense/thriller type movie to watch, it's worth a viewing.",1399334400,,437,4.214285714285714
5502828,5,B00AS1Q8FW,Quite cleverly directed. Keeps your attention throughout the film. Car chase scene is realistic. Fight scenes incoroprate just the right amount of violence.,1399334400,,156,5.826086956521739
5502829,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Was skeptical at first being a big fan of all the Reacher novels with Cruise being the lead as Reacher is supposed to be 6'5' tall and in around 250 which Cruise is definitely not, however he pulled it off and it was a good movie, he did a great job with attitude of the Reacher character, so disregard the physical side and enjoy it.",1399334400,,334,4.153846153846154
5502830,5,B00AS1Q8FW,I really like the movie. It had action and mystery to it. I usually don't watch tom cruise movies but this one was good.,1399334400,,120,4.041666666666667
5502831,4,B00AS1Q8FW,This movie had a good story and action was excellent.  Kept you on the edge of your seat.  Would watch more Reacher films.,1399334400,,122,4.260869565217392
5502832,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I enjoyed the movie, i have read almost all of Lee Child books or at least i am working on reading all of them.  This movie was not as exciting as the book. Even though Tom Cruise did a good job, he wasn't Jack who is 6'"" and 250 pounds but i kept trying to see Cruise as taller and meaner,  but was pretty good entertainment.",1399248000,,326,3.9242424242424243
5502833,5,B00AS1Q8FW,Very entertaining movie. It was nice to see Tom Cruise not doing another Mission Impossible movie and using Robert Duvall again.,1399248000,,128,5.142857142857143
5502834,5,B00AS1Q8FW,Nicely done Movie. Did not have a chance to read the book so I base my opinion on the movie. Tom Cruise was the right fit for this character and did not over do the role. The movie explored what Justice is in America and did a good job of looking at it from two perspectives. You will enjoy this movie.,1399248000,,302,3.9672131147540983
5502835,5,B00AS1Q8FW,The product ordered arrived promptly and was as advertised. Tom Cruise Is getting older but still has it and knows how to keep it interesting.,1399248000,,142,4.72
5502836,1,B00AS1Q8FW,I really enjoy the Jack Reacher series witten by Lee Child. This movie however is really a poor rendition of a good story.  I knew going in that it was going to be a stretch for Cruise to fill Reachers boots and he didn't do it. Reacher is 6' 5 and 250.  Cruise is barely taller or heavier than the female attorney Helen.  Acting big is not being big Tom.  This movie gives new meaning to mindless entertainment.  Sorry folks.  Spend your nickel and time someplace else.,1399161600,2,470,4.344827586206897
5502837,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"This movie proved our preconceived ideas wrong. Since the Jack Reacher character is described as over 6 ft tall and 250 lbs, Cruise obviously is not what the book describes.  Tom Cruise and his costars did a nice job of portraying Reacher and reflecting the story.  Glad to be wrong.",1399161600,,283,4.64
5502838,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"In some ways, this is the typical Cruise movie... his character is not that different from others Tom has played. But, this is less of an action flick than most. This is more murder/mystery - solve the riddle. There are a couple of fight scenes where Tom tries to dissuade the bad guys from taking him on (5 to 1), saying calmly, ""You really don't want to do this.""  But of course, the bad guys snicker and laugh him off. You can imagine how it plays out thanks to Reacher's multiply army tours of duty. This is the stuff I enjoy seeing from Cruise. Every guy wishes he could fight like that. Initially, however, I found the movie slow-moving, and the acting stiff and sub-par, mostly from the actress who plays opposite Cruise, but even Tom seemed to be rather just going thru the motions, a la Harrison Ford. There is the usual light, ""Are you kidding me!??"", humor from Cruise - which is always enjoyable. What made the movie, for me, was the plot twist... and when it's revealed (halfway thru), it's quite scary how plausible the scenario really is.",1399161600,,1053,4.513089005235602
5502839,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"Let's see. In the books, Reacher was something like 6'5"". Tom Thumb... Ooops, I mean Tom Cruise is 5'7''. Now, there is a masterful bit of casting. Totally unbelievable. And the fight scene trickery was obvious in some cases. I give it 2 stars for... I don't know what. I guess just because it's better than some stuff on Youtube.",1399161600,,330,4.516666666666667
5502840,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Action packed.  Tom Cruises character is interesting.  Good twist at the end.  He is his own law.  Overall...worth the watch.,1399161600,,125,5.1
5502841,5,B00AS1Q8FW,What can I say about this guy......................he never stops making good movies with really good acting and suspenseful story lines. This is a seer and a keeper.,1399075200,,166,5.185185185185185
5502842,5,B00AS1Q8FW,I went in with no expectation and loved it. I also liked Oblivion. Cruise is a good actor no matter what his religion is.,1399075200,,121,4.083333333333333
5502843,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Even though I consider Tom Cruise a ""poor"" cast as Jack Reacher, I do like this movie.  Cruise is a good actor but he can't act 6'5"" 250 lbs.  I am a big fan of Lee Child's work, so next time find us a real ""Jack Reacher"".",1399075200,,222,3.702127659574468
5502844,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I was expecting to just watch a mindless car chasing, shoot'em up movie. I was pleasantly surprised by an actual plot that revealed itself as the movie moved forward.

5502851,4,B00AS1Q8FW,I wasn't prepared to line this as much as I did. I've never read any of the books so I didn't have any issues with Tom Cruise's height. Lots of people do when it comes to this movie though so I wasn't sure what to expect. Will gladly see the next Reacher movie with Tom as the star.,1398988800,,282,3.8793103448275863
5502852,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"The story was somewhat interesting, but is plagued by a bad script that has Tom Cruise forgetting what character he is playing.  Part of the time he is an emotionless character, then he switches to caring about victims he never cared about when they were alive.  The end was a big let down, no big finale just Jack Reacher shoting an old man.  Oh well, maybe next time Tom will play the geriatric role, that probably would have made the movie better.",1398902400,,450,4.463414634146342

5502857,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Somewhat entertaining at times, but I didn't think it was thrilling. Tom's cute as always, but this movie didn't meet my expectations. It felt like I'd seen it somewhere already (even though I had not).",1398816000,,202,4.8
5502858,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"I felt that this movie was entertaining, but not great.  It had all the elements that make up a good action movie, but there really wasn't anything that set it apart or made it stand out.  It was just average in my opinion.  The action was good, it was moderately suspenseful, and there was enough to entertain you throughout the movie.  It just didn't leave a memorable impression on me.  If they came out with a sequel, Id probably watch it, but I wouldnt race out to see it.  If you are a fan of Cruise or love action movies youll probably enjoy this one, but don't expect too much.

It did keep you guessing about who the bad person was (trust no one). It did flow nicely into each scene, editing for me is very important. The plot was believable. The acting?

Completely fake character and some basic insights are wrong, but overall great character!  Love Jack Reacher, I could not have Tom Cruise as a picture in my mind during the next Jack Reacher book.  If I remember right Jack is described as blonde, 6ft 5in give an inch or two, scarred, confident not cocky, brutally intimidating physically, women want him and men want to be him.  Tom Cruise?  Nope.",1398816000,,529,4.515789473684211

The writing was striving to be intelligent, and one can feel the effort.  The actors actually ACTED the effort.  It was a step above the usual thriller, however, so I'll give it 3 stars.",1398729600,,355,4.587301587301587

5502882,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Chris McQuarrie did a better than expected job as director. His script was well written as one would hope with his history. It was wordy, as most of his fare is, but, not so much that it dragged too much. The action scenes were sufficient to support the story, though the final fight had a ""we've already been there, and it was bigger"" quality. Still, I was pleasantly surprised by the enjoyment I got out of the film. Admittedly, I had low expectations, but, they were met and exceeded. Even Tom Cruise's default character portrayal choices didn't seem out of place in this yarn.

Long a Lee Child book fan, I had a very preconceived idea of who and what Jack Reacher is and should be portrayed as, I approached the movie with trepidation.  However, Cruise was able to convince me that he was Jack Reacher and I accepted his interpretation of this character, forgetting altogether who was doing the acting.  A good adventure story.  If you've read Child's books, you know that the hero seems to get out of situations in some unbelievable ways so you must allow yourself to accept that premise to enjoy the books or this movie.

5502927,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"I guess one of the drawbacks to seeing movies after reading the book is when the movies are cast, it very seldom matches a character as pictured in your mind. Reacher is six feet five inches tall, 50 inch chest, packs about two thirty in weight, and Cruise just didn't fit, in my opinion. Your mileage may vary.
The movie was interesting and followed the book pretty closely, but the scene of the two thugs trying to beat up Reacher in the tub was pretty inane.",1398124800,,461,4.372093023255814

5502947,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"We went in with no preconceptions at all (other than the usual admiration for Tom Cruise's acting despite his personal oddness).  We expected a bit of the summer blockbuster genre, certainly not this film.  My reaction is complex:

1) First, I have no idea what the book was about or like, or how this succeeded or failed at doing it justice
2) As we predicted, it was an action film, with over the top chase scenes, over-dramatic characters (e.g., the detective), predictable cheesy one-liners at times, too much superhero unreality, and a little too much feel-good vengeance.
3) Some of the acting was lacking
4) The climactic ending completely lost credibility, and while I love Robert Duvall, his character (particularly at the end) was caricature.
5) But, it was still haunting, thought-provoking, and fun.  This was way more serious than your typical block-buster
6) Finally, and most importantly, despite the flaws, I loved the way this film was shot and developed.  I honestly can't remember if there was music or not, it pretty much captured me the whole time.  The film was slow and thoughtful, more of a ""who dunnit and why?"" that kept your interest.  Really, the action and violence were not the parts that excited you, but more the underlying plot and mystery, and the excellent way this was drawn and teased out.  The violence just served to get your attention and establish the tone and seriousness of the plot, but to me this was more of a mystery drama.  Honestly, this way more of a retro movie, it was shot old-school in a manner that created a feel that I loved, in many places reminding me of a Hitchcock film.

So basically, this film is somewhat all over the place, but I loved the retro feel and mystery story emphasis, and the fact that I'm still thinking about it days later, and for that I give it an overall high rating.",1398038400,,1848,4.675925925925926

The cars involved actually suffered damage after banging into each other and one car died and would not start. If you like a murder/mystery were the clues are not feed to you on a plate like on the old Hawaii 5-O and are not obscure observations by characters, like in Bones on TV? You will like this.  The shooting was more real then most movies as they didn't have perfect aim on every shot.

It's not that I don't like short people, but Reacher's unusual height and strength serve him very well in the improbable jams he gets into. In the movie Jack Reacher just talks too much.  In the books he communicated with the reader mostly.  He is not believable but that is what makes reading the novels and the convoluted plotting so good.

Tom Cruise is NOT physically Jack Reacher and I was prepared to not like the portrayal, but he actually did a very good job with J.R.'s understated and confident manner. Some of the fight scenes seemed hard to believe and the villains  (as well as the D.A.) were a bit clownish & without depth.

The character seems to have been written as some sort of a bad ass, but Tom Cruise just struck me as the same weak individual I've seen on TV interviews and talk shows, merely reciting lines off of a script.  I liked the screenplay well enough and the plot was strong, but I had difficulty getting past how poorly the title character was cast... though with Tom Cruise as Executive Producer, I think we can all see how that panned out.  I had to run an errand with about 20 minutes left in the movie, and I honestly found myself not caring how it ended.  If you're a huge Tom Cruise fan (do those exist?) then maybe you'll love it, but if you're looking for something along the lines of Jason Bourne or James Bond this movie will probably disappoint you.",1397520000,,792,4.331081081081081

5503032,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"Finally saw this last night via Netflix. was not expecting it to be particularly good and was unfortunately not surprised with the outcome.
Regardless of the oft mentioned discrepancy between the physique of the Reacher of the book and Tom Cruise i just didn't feel this film stood alone as anything more than a fairly generic action flick.
The only people upset by the use of Cruise were the long term readers of the books who have long been looking forward to the movie version. That is certainly a lot of people but only a fraction of the target audience of a movie which has Tom Cruise as an expense...
To a large extent then the film needed to either define why Reacher is such an unusual individual and/or simply produce a cookie cutter full-on, shooting and explosions, action movie where the back story wasn't important.

personally, i don't think they really did either. The back story was just brushed on so Reacher's character and intelligence were not made very important to the plot - he just seemed smarter than the cops and the thugs and a better fighter.

Bottom line, disregarding the complaints re the use of Tom Cruise, i don't think the script exactly did anyone any favours either. it didn't introduce Reacher to newbies and it didn't stand out as an action film either.

there are probably five or six books (including this one) which seem obvious choices for movie development. i just hope the next one is a bit more convincing.",1397433600,,1451,4.682352941176471

5503053,3,B00AS1Q8FW,Just looking for some entertainment and Tom Cruise can always be counted on.  It definitely kept our attention and the ending surprised us. It's not overly intelligent but was a good detective story.,1397347200,,199,5.03030303030303

5503059,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) was a far better movie than I had expected.  Having ""driven by"" the Amazon Instant Video several times I finally decided to give it a chance.

It was a good action film, with a thinking man's logic behind it.  Robert Duvall puts on an especially good show as Cash, a former Marine who was willing to help Reacher, a former soldier, in his quest for the truth.

Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike) takes on the role of the defense attorney in spite of misgivings by her father and District Attorney Rodin (Richard Jenkins).  Detective Emerson (David Oyelowo) plays a cop who's willing to do nearly anything to get the conviction after arrest.

Get Jack Reacher.  There's definitely a reason.",1397260800,,708,4.754098360655738

Great dialogue and interaction between Tom Cruise and Robert Duvall.  Some say Tom is too short to play the role of a guy who in the book is 6'5: and ""built like a brick outhouse.""  In the bar fight scene, however, it makes much more sense that a gang of 5 guys would take on someone who appears to be just an average guy.  Heck, even my wife loves this movie . . . and it is definitely not a chick flick!

I really didn't want to watch this movie thinking it was going to be the standard arrogant Tom and everyone is against him, but he was more reserved with this one.

5503094,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Lots of summer acton blockbusters rely on crude humor and special effects, leaving characters and story for the afterthought.  Refreshingly, Jack Reacher, written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, is full of compelling characters.  The protagonist, Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) is an Army Iraq war veteran.  He lives off the grid, treating it as a bit of a game.  In one line, Jack says being un-locatable became an addiction.  He can only be found when he wants to be found.  So when five people are killed in a random sniper shooting, the suspect (Joseph Sikora) asks for Reacher.  In what seems an open and shut case, the only cogs in the wheel of justice are the DA's daughter Helen (Rosamund Pike), and Reacher, who hates the suspect's guts, yet can't resist a good mystery to solve.

As in many films today, the villains are more compelling than the heroes.  This is the case here, as ""The Zec"" (Werner Hertzog) is mesmerizing and has much better lines than Reacher.  Actually, some of Reacher's lines were almost cringe-inducing.  ""I am going to make you drink your blood out of a boot.""  Oh.  Okey-dokey, then.  My other gripe is that Pike has a permanent expression of surprise glued on her face for most of the movie.  It was a little annoying.

It is such an extra treat to have veteran actors Richard Jenkins as the DA, and Robert Duvall as a gun range owner on this cast!  This is at least worth a rental if not a purchase.",1397001600,,1438,4.5984251968503935

5503098,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Having not read the book/s I watched this with an open mind.  As portrayed by Tom Cruise, Jack Reacher is a variant of a Jason Bourne-type character, but with a different back story.  The female lead was very weak, and generally unimpressive.  The main villain who, I think, was supposed to be very scary went out with a whimper.  There was nothing original that I could discern in this movie, so it stands as a decent way to kill some time if you're in the mood for this kind of fare.",1397001600,,485,4.2967032967032965

Considering Jack is 6' 6'' and 230 pounds, Mr Cruise is an interesting choice, but we both think he does a good job. They really added things to the story in order to make the movie, but we liked that too. Who doesn't like a good car chase and shootout?",1396915200,,318,4.063492063492063
5503103,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"Sadly, no. This is as bad, or worse than being miscast as Lestat in The Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice. She was mortified at first to learn Cruise would play him, then molified by piles of cash. I think Robert A. Heinlein said something of the same sort when his books were to be filmed. You throw the book over the California border and run like hell with the money.

Of all the people to play Reacher, this has to be the worst choice from the novels standpoint. Reacher is 6'5"" and weighs 250 lbs. Cruise is 5' 7'' and weighs 150 lbs. Some match. Stephen Segal is shorter than Jack Reacher.  Dwayne Johnson with hair I would believe as Reacher. Tom, well Tom should have stuck to comedies.",1396915200,,692,4.3565891472868215

Cruise is so charismatic he doesn't need jet fighters.
He seems so much like me: older, army, retired, male, etc. and everything I will never be, but might like to be.
Nice to see the old rifles again; even if only used as sniper rifles - shows how good they were.
Demonstrates a lifestyle based on freedom and what he gives up to be unattached.
Very persuasive argument for the pursuit of freedom contrary to his personal commitment to a covenant type, strong-  relationship infused religion.
Always great to see Robert Duval and funny too; like his keeping his night vision in his right eye by keeping it shut.

5503126,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"My sister (a therapist) won't watch Cruise because of his egotism and obnoxious relationship with scientology. But this movie is a great if fairly unreal male wish to be the super guy.  If Cruise is trying to get into the head of his audience, he is definitely on target. His appearance is timed with prescience a-fore-thought. His nerve and ability unmatched, and in the movie untiring (fights 5 guys and the last 2 go running - as he states they would).  The plot isn't deep, but it is good enough to keep us on our toes.
It's definitely worthy of a watch, maybe enjoyable the 2nd time around.

5503128,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Enjoyed the story line and character interplay.  Introduction (i.e., requested by prime criminal suspect) of Jack Reacher on the scene was different.  No nonsense entry with analytical arrogance and a sense for justice, even when its brutal at time.  Defense attorney caring and concern for truth (despite political baggage of DA dad).  Entertaining.  Could be an interesting Transporter like series.",1396742400,,400,5.6

5503142,4,B00AS1Q8FW,It was a good movie and I recommend it if you haven't seen it yet and you are a Tom Cruise fan. I took off one star however just because Tom Cruise didn't live up to Jack Reacher's personality. It was good and I may watch it again.,1396656000,,231,3.8333333333333335

5503153,5,B00AS1Q8FW,Tom Cruise was outstanding as Jack Reacher in this movie.  I wasn't familiar with the Jack Reacher book series until I saw the movie and then became hooked.  The movie was action-packed and fast-moving starting with the opening sniper scene to the ending pitting Cruise and Robert Duvall (one of my favorites) against a cynical Russian mobster and his crew.

5503160,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I am not a big fan of Tom Cruise but Jack Reacher is by far one of his best movies. I love him in that role and maybe if he comes out with more like that one, he might win me over.",1396569600,,180,3.3095238095238093
5503161,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"This movie was dark, smart, convoluted, and very thrilling. A mix of detective / police / legal work and lots of gritty action and exposing essentially an underworld. I decided to watch this movie on a fluke, because I could not fall asleep. But had to stop watching after about 20 minutes because it actually woke me up more. Following up the next day to finish it was a good idea.

I have not read the Jack Reacher books. So I cannot compare Mr. Cruise's rendition to that of the book. But now I want to read the books. Somehow his compulsion to do what's right reminds me of Spock's compulsion to be logical, or Odd Thomas' compulsions. The Reacher character feels like those two characters in some way. Not ""elemental,"" but, ""in its groove."" Not sure how else to describe it.

Tom Cruise's performance reminded me of so many of the outstanding movies of his earlier career. I used to think Tom Cruise was one of the best actors of his generation; then a number of years he was in movies that for me, were ""off."" So he fell off my ""must see"" list of actors. But if he can keep this up, he is back on. This was such a good pick for him.

I would definitely be interested in a sequel. Good stuff.",1396569600,,1197,4.287610619469026

5503164,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Sit back and go for a Cruise. I actually like his character in this movie better than the MI series. I am hoping for a sequel. I did not like the language bombs that could easily have been avoided.

5503199,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"and it's not unbelievable in a good way like something along the lines of Mission Impossible or comic book movies might be.

I am not familiar with the books so can't compare but this story in this movie is utter garbage. The actors, acting and production was fine but couldn't save this stinker of a story. That acting earned Jack Reacher it one star, Rosamund Pike's cleavage earned it another.

Not sure how anyone can consider this a ""thriller"" as I found myself chuckling a lot of the times. Laughing at the movie, not with it.

There are some ""spoilers"" below. I use the term loosely because 1) it should be obvious the good guy wins in a film like this 2) not sure you can technically spoil something that's already rotten.

I was giving the movie the benefit of the doubt up until Jack Reacher was caught off guard in the bathroom scene. Our beloved hero who has up until now shown impressive observation skills, situational awareness and hand to hand combat apparently was completely caught off guard when two 60's or 70's era muscle cars (loud engines) pull up to the house he's in 2 local thugs manage to sneak up on him and whack him on the back of his head with a baseball bat. Maybe it's explained in the book how Reacher has worked up an immunity to crushing head injuries slowly over time or something because the full swing barely fazes him, while a slight tap from the same bat knocks one of the villains down the stairs. Our villains have managed to master Ninja like stealth but when it comes to fighting I couldn't help think back to the old Three Stooges movies.

They could have saved some money on the last fight scene by just copying and pasting it from anyone of the other similar movies. Our hero comes face to face with one of the main antagonists' henchmen, disarms him and then tosses his own weapon to have a fair mano a mano fight. Who cares? It's not like there was much of a story evolving between the two characters. There was not even the slightest hint of any respect between them. Why bother wasting time like this when the damzel is still in distress?

Why does Reacher not want to dispose of a healthy, fit, young man quickly? Is this supposed to show that he has character? Cause that kinda goes out the window a few minutes later when he has no problem killing an old man, with 1 finger, who hasn't pointed any weapons or made any threats, in cold blood. Just when I thought things couldn't get more ridiculous.

About 10 minutes in the streaming stopped and I had to continue watching it on another site. I should have taken that as a sign to not bother but it's a good cast of actors and actresses and seemed to have good reviews. Wish I would have skipped it.",1396310400,,2704,4.406813627254509
5503200,5,B00AS1Q8FW,Good movie but not quite the character in the book. A bit shorter and younger than the Jack Reacher in Lee Child's many books.,1396310400,,126,4.291666666666667
5503201,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"I have read all of Lee Child's Jack Racher novels.

5503203,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"Unquestionably one of Cruise's worst (and I am a fan of much of his work). Absurd, over the top dialog, black and white storyline with no shades of grey. Every potential plot development telegraphed well in advance, screenplay could have been written by a 10-year old. And, unfortunately, performance of supporting female lead was atrocious -- her talent consisting exclusively of turning her head and staring wide-eyed into space. Stay AWAY -- this is an awful movie. Cruise can do action movies and do them exceedingly well, but this one's a stinker. Here's a tip for Tom -- if the script calls for recurring scenes of you with your shirt off, and is devoid of a single line of humor, look for a better movie, you can do better, much, much better.",1396310400,3,749,4.681818181818182

acting its ok",1396310400,,100,3.5454545454545454
5503208,4,B00AS1Q8FW,I enjoy most Tom Cruise movies and this one had a lot of action and liked the plot.  Both my wife and I liked it.,1396310400,,113,3.52

5503210,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Nice enthralling and exhilarating thriller.
Tom at his best acting.
Nice screenplay and sequence of events.
Good twists at the climax",1396224000,,133,5.380952380952381
5503211,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"just an average ""thriller"".  Reading the Jack Reacher books is better than what Hollywood can give you. Tom Cruze not the best choice for Jack.",1396224000,,143,4.72
5503212,4,B00AS1Q8FW,I like Lee Child's books but found Tom Cruise to be lacking greatly in the role of Jack Reacher. He seemed cocky rather than confident but I just don't like him as an actor. Otherwise I did enjoy the movie.,1396224000,,206,4.175
5503213,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"A decent movie although the storyline was a bit weak.
It could have done with a little more intrigue or a more significant plot twist.
Enjoyable nonetheless.",1396224000,,157,4.851851851851852
5503214,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Tom Cruise is not my favorite actor and does not accurately portray the character in the book version.  Not his fault, he is just too nice looking vs. downright rugged handsome type.  Movie itself of OK enough to rate a four.",1396224000,,225,4.463414634146342
5503215,1,B00AS1Q8FW,Really disappointing if you've read any of the Jack Reacher stories. Tom Cruise does not cut it as Jack. And ignoring the comparison to the background character the story was flimsy.,1396224000,,182,4.903225806451613
5503216,5,B00AS1Q8FW,Excellent movie. Tom Cruise always plays a great part.  It was a thriller that had twists and turns you weren't expecting.,1396224000,,122,4.809523809523809
5503217,4,B00AS1Q8FW,we thought it had an interesting plot. well acted. haven't read the book but enjoyed the action movie. worth the rental.,1396137600,,120,4.761904761904762

Plateau in both.",1396137600,,134,4.869565217391305
5503220,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Especially love the car chases. Quite well done. Ever since Interview with a Vampire I've been a Tom Cruise fan. This is a fun action movie.,1396137600,,140,4.423076923076923
5503221,4,B00AS1Q8FW,good show-this is the kind of gritty show I like - also shows off Cruise's acting chops better than the CGI stuff he usually does.,1396137600,,130,4.24
5503222,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Good action thriller. Don't put much thought into where things are going - and you'll be surprised. It's a good ride.,1396137600,,117,4.619047619047619
5503223,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Fast paced action with a twist in plot. Tom Cruise gets better with age. Believable characters well played with fantastic special effects. Great movie for a cool evening and pop corn.,1396137600,,183,4.935483870967742
5503224,3,B00AS1Q8FW,A somewhat typical adventure film as a vehicle to get Tom Cruise back on the silver screen.  Fairly predictable story.,1396137600,,118,4.9
5503225,5,B00AS1Q8FW,I thought it was perhaps his best ever film.  I have not been a fan of his and do not agree with his principles but I have overlooked this and judged him on performance only and this was very good.,1396137600,,197,3.925
5503226,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Very Good action movie.  Acting, story lines, plot are all good to very good.  And, a little mystery to solve.",1396137600,,110,4.45
5503227,5,B00AS1Q8FW,I have watched Jack Reacher a half dozen time now.  Love the action and curves in the story pattern.  Always keeps you thinking.,1396137600,,128,4.521739130434782
5503228,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I sometimes watch movies in small bites, but this movie, like a good book, kept me hooked. I couldn't stop watching it. It's a must see movie if you like action!",1396051200,,161,4.225806451612903
5503229,3,B00AS1Q8FW,Killed some time watching this at least.  Was pretty predictable though. There are better movies out there if you want something that will surprise you.,1396051200,,152,5.08
5503230,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher! Really! Tom Cruise as ""an officer and a gentleman"" or the lawyer with Jack Nicols as the opposition is perfect. His face would speak a thousand words. As a 6 foot 5 super hero, he is totally unsuited. As a movie, it was not enjoyable for me as I have read all of Lee Child's thrillers. I just could not get past the poor casting enough to enjoy the story. Maybe if you don't know and love the improbable Jack Reacher, you can tolerate this travesty.",1396051200,,477,4.252747252747253
5503231,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I was not expecting much from this film going into it, but I have to say I was really impressed with it.  The action, the plot twists and the characters were great.  Count me as part of the crowd that thinks Cruise makes an awesome Jack Reacher.  The whole ""but he's not 6'5"" argument doesn't hold water, IMO.  Badasses come in all shapes and sizes.  Besides, as in most of Cruise's films, the viewer can't easily tell that he isn't a large man as described in the novels by the way they cast the other actors, etc.  It's really a non-issue.

And it was nice to see Hollywood get more realistic fight scenes in a film for a change.  I don't recall the particular martial art that they had Cruise train in for this role, but it seemed pretty realistic to how real street fights go down and the appropriate defense responses for such fights.

I rarely want to view most films for a second viewing, but I look forward to watching this one again.",1396051200,,942,4.337142857142857
5503232,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Good Action  - As true to the original as possible in the time available.  Tom Cruise is less than convincing as the hulking Jack Reacher would have been...but it works.,1396051200,,169,4.6
5503233,3,B00AS1Q8FW,If there's nothing else on its worth the time. Movie keeps your interest and is fast paced. Action packed. Tom Cruise does a nice job.,1396051200,,134,4.4
5503234,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Great movie!  Full throtle, mostly non-stop, action packed, and very entertaining.  I would definitely recommend checking this out if you passed it up in the theaters.",1396051200,,167,5.384615384615385
5503235,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I was pleasantly surprised by Tom Cruise in the Reacher role--He does not fit the picture at all, but he's a good actor and it wasn't so bad.  One problem--I was  unable to get close caption on this movie. and it stalled out after 32 minutes.  When it came back on, it had gone back to the beginning.  These two factors make it problematic that I will continue using this service.  Too bad.",1395964800,,390,4.287671232876712
5503236,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I love Jack Reacher books, and was not disappointed in the movie.  I know some people have a problem with Tom Cruise being shorter than the ""book Reacher"", who is tall, but I liked Cruise.  A movie is visual & having a short hero who can take on anyone & win has more impact than a hero who is taller than anyone else.  I feel  Cruise has the face & mannerisms of Jack Reacher, & did a good job.

Like most movies from books, reading a book first will help one understand somethings that happen in the movie.

Hope another movie is in the works.",1395964800,,545,4.142857142857143

5503238,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"A decent movie.... Not the greatest, but something good to watch when you are bored. Filled with a lot of action and explosions, and a few good fight scenes, so cant complain!",1395964800,,175,4.5
5503239,2,B00AS1Q8FW,I was willing to give it a go as I was up for some great action and I like Tom Cruise well enough. But the dialogue perhaps even more than the acting was too embarrassing. I would only watch if not picky about good dialogue.,1395964800,,224,4.0
5503240,3,B00AS1Q8FW,This movie did not do justice to this terrific book by author Lee Child.  Too bad there was so much to offer in the book,1395964800,,120,3.8
5503241,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Totally under-rated movie.  Well worth the time to watch - great entertainment.  Tom Cruise did a very good job.  If you watch the movie as a standalone without referencing the books, you'll find that it works very well.",1395964800,,220,4.7368421052631575

5503246,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I just love Tom Cruise and always have, however I do feel that he is not among the best of the best; but that doesn't stop me from wanting to see his movies (LOL!!!).  I liked his character's (Reacher) matter of fact attitude and confidence that is soooo Tom Cruise's MO in movies.  The movie held my interest the entire time.  The plot was good but not great; I think if they would have kept us guessing a little longer, rather than exposing the truth too early in the movie, it would have been better. I like movies that I have to figure out for myself; that's what makes a suspense move fun!  I give the movie 3 stars and an extra star just because its Tom Cruise!",1395964800,,667,4.1875

5503248,3,B00AS1Q8FW,It was ok. The acting was a little weak. The plot pretty predictable. Tom was the only plus in this movie!,1395964800,,106,4.095238095238095

5503250,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I enjoyed the movie. It did vary from the book, but they were able to make the differences work. It also seemed weird for Tom Cruise to play Jack. The physical differences are unmistakable, but he did a good job on making it realistic. I look forward to a new movie. I really like Lee Child's series.",1395964800,,300,4.280701754385965
5503251,2,B00AS1Q8FW,The movie does not achieve what the books do.  I have read everiyone of the books and enjoyed them in varying degrees. The movie just does not come up to what the book and your imagination can do.,1395964800,,196,4.157894736842105
5503252,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Good action and an interesting story.  The acting was pretty good.  Plot was fairly shallow and the movie didn't leave you with any wow moments but worth the time spent watching it.,1395964800,,181,4.625
5503253,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"In the books, Jack Reacher is 6ft 3in, and it seems that the camera angles were chosen to give the illusion that Tom Cruise is the same height - which he isn't by a long way, and which was not really successful.  When I first heard of his casting as Reacher, I was appalled by the physical difference from the Reacher in the books... however, I did enjoy the movie, and look forward to sequels as they come.  I just have to not think of the books, is all...",1395964800,,457,4.123595505617978

5503256,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Good flick. Not very realistic, but definite action movie. Potential for other movies the way they left it, but I don't know if it did well enough to make more. It was a bit violent and had some bad language.",1395964800,,208,4.225
5503257,5,B00AS1Q8FW,I like Tom Cruise movies but this one I was not sure About but it was so entertaining that I watched the entire thing without leaving my chair.

The acting is good and Werner Herzog was a pleasant surprise as a character vs director. Tom Cruise plays a guy who can do anything & does it well & he's fighting for the ""good guys""..

5503272,4,B00AS1Q8FW,The movie was good but I am a car guy and I loved the chase scenes with the 70 chevelle. The stunt drivers really enjoyed themselves on this one. I will watch this movie again just for the chase scenes. Some people cry when a person gets killed in a movie. I cry when a classic car gets killed.,1395878400,,294,4.0

5503274,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"The main reason I watched the movie is I have read the ""Jack Reacher Series"" books and liked them.  Normally when I see Tom Cruise I skip the movie.  I have to say it was very entertaining, kept you wanting more.  Great entertainment for a rainy day!
Enjoy!",1395878400,,257,4.3125
5503275,5,B00AS1Q8FW,Great suspenseful flick that surpassed our expectations. Tom Cruise turns in a solid performance. The ongoing tension is a nail-biter. Hubby and I give it two thumbs up.,1395792000,,169,5.071428571428571

5503278,3,B00AS1Q8FW,Good plot but wasted in that bad guy is more creepy than evil.  Also too long could easily cut 20 to 30 minutes maintain story line and improve delivery - movie would snap.  Cruise good as Reacher liked cerebral nature of movie. Courtney good as bad guy but underused.  Other actors not so memorable.  Bad weather - make popcorn and watch the movie.  Beautiful day - enjoy the outdoors!,1395705600,,386,4.536231884057971

Cruise doesn't work as a brooding adventure hero.  I watched the film because I had some time to kill and it came with Prime, but I would never pay for viewing it, nor would I consider buying it.  It was a diversion one afternoon, but the plot is contrived and not very memorable.",1395705600,,416,4.2405063291139244

I disagree with those reviewers (not that it was typical, because it was.  But that it should be downgraded for it).  This is a popcorn flick.  It wasn't meant to carry any socially redeeming value.  It was meant to entertain you for a few hours and take your mind off of whatever it was fixating on prior to starting the movie.  Mission Accomplished.",1395705600,,510,4.527472527472527

This, it turns out, appears to be one of them.  Plot is good; with twists and turns that lead to an interesting and deep place (I do wish they would have explored/explained more).  Co-star, well, not sure how I felt about her....not sure if they could have done better or not.  I'll leave that to others to decide.  Filmed in Pittsburgh, it was wonderful to see familiar sites and places as the backdrop - another reason for the high rating.

I'm certainly not a Tom Cruise fan boy but I don't have a blind hate for him either.  This is a pretty good action movie and has a believable storyline.  This movie, in my opinion, was along the lines of his other movie hits, Collateral and MI: Ghost Protocol.

This movie moves along quite well and has a good plot along with decent acting to keep the movie going. This is not an academy award type movie but it will entertain most of us and not have you thinking you wasted time or money.  Good news here is I'm a Prime Member and it cost nothing.

As always, Cruise did a good job with the role...this is the kind of role I believe he plays best...a confident man who is determined to figure it out and get justice.

5503326,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW:

Movie starts off interesting enough. then about 5 minutes later,  enter Tom Cruise's character: Jack Reacher.

And look, Let me say this: I love Tom Cruise's acting. In fact I'd go so far as to say he's a tremendous actor. One of the best of our generation for sure. But good Christ this character he played... JACK REACHER. Talk about a friggin' cheeseball.

""Okay, let's go outside and fight. But first...you should pay your check.""

""Why""

""Cause you won't be able to later.""

...give me a friggin' break.

And then there's the horrible plot. JACK REACHER seems to grab the clues out of thin air like a bad 70s TV show.

""Hmmm...now let me see the suspect's card statement. A-ha!! Just as I suspected. He refilled his gas tank every other day. That means he was driving long distances. That means he must have been practicing at a shooting range nearby. And that of course means he wasn't alone.""

...wait what???

The whole movie is like this right until it's extremely predictable ending.

PROS:
--2 cool fight scenes
--I swear I'm not trying to be a cock...but that's really the only pros I can think of for this movie.

CONS:
--horrible dialog
--horrible plot
--predictable all the way to the ending
--story drags

The plot is horrible. The story drags. The acting is generic at best (boring at worst). Just a bad movie overall.

I can see people from previous reviews are reviewing this movie based on how well it stacked up against the books that apparently this movie is based on.

And that's fine.

And maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. I haven't read any of the books so I can't say.

But I can tell you that this review is based solely on my experience watching it as a movie.

And with that said....it sucked.

I would take the pass on this and rent something else.",1395532800,7,1807,4.535603715170279

In their defense, the roles were scripted badly and they were probably directed to act like bimbo airheads. At least Fast was actually playing a bimbo airhead, but she didn't manage to pull it off nearly as well as Pike.

The wide-eyed, dumb, fragile, and overtly sexual treatment of Pike's role as Helen was insulting.

It would've been better if he'd had bang the lawyer then you'll have another aspect to the story.  But then again, that'll make it cliche.",1395273600,,244,4.627906976744186
5503368,2,B00AS1Q8FW,Young folks would like it.  too much violence.  Not enough story.  Like Tom Cruse but he should be more discriminating in his choices of movies to perform in.,1395273600,,158,4.571428571428571
5503369,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Cruise does a good job of taking on the role of Jack Reacher, even though he is not as big as the Reacher fromthe books.  The story is well set and plays out well.  Reacher believes in the law and wantes to catch the ""bad guy"" but doesn't always want to follow the rules.",1395273600,,271,4.0
5503370,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I am a Tom Cruise fan to begin with, his action packed films never disappoint, especially the auto chases.  Not having  read the book, I liked the plot twist. Also liked that there was no romance thrown in.",1395273600,,206,4.394736842105263
5503371,3,B00AS1Q8FW,The movie was o.k. but the books are better.  The chase scene was impossibly stupid and unreal but the rest was predictable.  Thankfully there were no graphic sex scenes to endure.,1395273600,,180,4.774193548387097

5503377,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"It seemed like this wasn't the typical Tom Cruise big budget action movie and was just a little bit off through the first half hour (combination of stilted dialogue and weird camera angles).  Once the movie settled into a rhythm, I liked it better, but it definitely wasn't what I expected.",1395273600,,290,4.686274509803922

5503380,5,B00AS1Q8FW,Not a Tom Cruise fan but this one was really a great movie. Hats off to Mr. Cruise on a great performance.  Best outing since top gun in my opinion.  I enjoyed the story line and twists and turns.,1395273600,,196,4.0

5503383,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Tom Cruise is his usual superhuman bad ass... It holds your attention and being from Pittsburgh, I enjoyed the recognizable settings.

5503388,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"To me, Cruise is often playing roles which either do not stretch him as an actor or in which he fails to stretch himself into the role in a way that aids in the suspension of disbelief.  This role is a very good fit for him which did not need more than he could give.  To balance my critique of Cruise, I have found one role in which he played which really did surprise me.  As the film director in Tropic Thunder.  The first time through, I did not recognize him until the sly grin and wink at the very end.",1395187200,,508,4.0

5503390,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"I'm a big Reacher fan.  His character is 50%\50% brawn and brain. Child makes it a point to spell out Reacher's physical attributes, it's an integral part of who he is and how each story plays out.  Apparently this essential characteristic is deemed expendable to satisfy Cruise 's ego. They might as well have put him in a wheelchair for what it did to the character. Cruise believes he is the character he plays and couldn't pass up absorbing Reacher into his fantasy of himself.  If you never read any of the books, it's a good action movie. For those of us who have, it's a pathetic joke.",1395187200,,592,4.462962962962963

5503398,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Over the top,  but entertaining enough for a rainy day. Reacher in the books is a beastly 6'5"" 250ish imposing figure.  It's funny to see Tom Cruise play the character.",1395187200,,168,4.566666666666666
5503399,3,B00AS1Q8FW,Action packed. OK acting. I am glad it was free on Prime. It was not a Bourne Identity for sure but filled time when nothing on TV,1395187200,,130,3.8518518518518516

5503406,4,B00AS1Q8FW,I was worried Tom Cruise would be terrible as Jack Reacher. However I thought he pulled it off well. Recommended,1395100800,,112,4.65
5503407,5,B00AS1Q8FW,What a surprise with this movie the title did not give a hit of the story to follow. Jack Reacher  was able to find the culprit and deduce  the possible accomplisher.,1395100800,,166,4.32258064516129

5503410,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"i was prepared to hate this movie because i had read and enjoyed all of lee child's novels featuring the rather huge, homeless, no-luggage ex-army major jack reacher. i was not ready to believe that tom cruise, admittedly a very talented actor, but smallish, could convey the weight of such an outsized hero. i was wrong. tom cruise, as reacher, doesn't talk much but his fists do a lot of effective communicating. i found his reacher very believable. and the british rosamund pike is a great strong female character in this movie; reacher never even kisses her, which is a nice twist. i would cut the scene in which tom cruise is without his shirt; it's irritating. robert duvall is terrific as the retired marine corps gunnery sergeant who owns a shooting range. tom cruise's father was in the corps so that makes cruise half human. there's a lot of shooting, as you would expect in a film about a crazed sniper in pittsburgh. look for the police desk sergeant about half way through: it's lee child in a cameo role.",1395100800,,1018,4.629834254143646

5503422,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"And it failed to meet those expectations. Do yourself a favor and skip this one unless you are really, really into Tom Cruise. The plot twists weren't twists at all. Some of the most interesting details were meaningless to the main story. The opening scene made for a great cold-blooded hook however.",1395100800,,300,4.788461538461538

The issue I had was the movie froze with about 10 minutes left.  i use Sony PS3 to access WiFi and all signals were strong there.  I would start and stop the movie and it didn't matter.  Finally I got completely out of Amazon Prime and then logged back in.  When the movie was chosen again there was a help screen to ask if I wanted to resume the movie which I did and it streamed properly for the rest of the movie.

Only we also have a pretty nifty cast. It's not anything strikingly original, it's just done well and entertainingly. I would happily watch another Reacher flick. Candy, not nutrition.

5503430,5,B00AS1Q8FW,I am not a big Tom Cruise fan.  But I think he did a great job staying true to his character and not over-acting.  There was a lot of action and suspense in this movie.  It also keeps you guessing.  I knew nothing of the Jack Reacher novel series and the movie has inspired me to read some of the novels this movie is based on.  I would recommend this movie.,1395014400,,358,3.9859154929577465

5503436,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Yes, it's a thriller, action flick with Tom Cruise in it, but it shows a bit of heart as well as the usual justified revenge violence. It's a bit of an anarchic heart, but what did you expect?",1395014400,,192,4.078947368421052

5503448,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I expected to think that this was an okay movie.  I'm not a Tom Cruise fan; my impression of him was formed in his younger days, and I always saw him playing a punk with too much confidence and too much ego and a generally overdone script to get him through it.  But he's grown tremendously as an actor, and he's matured, and I'm starting to become a fan.  He handles his part here with excellence and believability.  The supporting actors, including Robert DuVall, are also excellent.  This film is riveting, and although some of the action stretched credibility all over the place, you have to expect some of that in a film like this.  I'm rating it 5-stars, as one of the best action films I've ever seen.",1394928000,,708,4.449612403100775

I had my doubts about Jack Reacher, since I like the books and really didn't think Tom Cruise was the right choice for this character.  But it was good!  We both liked the movie.  Lots of action and twists, Jack saved the girl, saw justice done, and headed off into anonymity again.  I would definitely recommend this movie!",1394928000,,476,4.2444444444444445

5503458,5,B00AS1Q8FW,Tom Cruise was excellent in this. It was action packed and intriguing. There's a bit to it so listening and watching everything helps to get it all. Good flick.,1394928000,,160,4.551724137931035

Lee Childs spends time having the reader visualize Jack Reacher and while a great actor, Tom Cruise does not fit the visual.

5503466,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Action movies are often guilty of overusing fiction's license of implausibility. But this movie is thoughtful and attempts to remain grounded and reasonable at all times -- and it succeeds.

Great flick for people who really can't stand being pulled out of the action by bad writing.

If you're a fan of the Bourne movies, you'll probably like this one.",1394928000,,353,4.866666666666666

5503471,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Great flick. Good action, likeable characters.  Tom Cruise did a great job portraying the Jack Reacher's wit and lack of conscience, I only wish he physically matched Lee Child's character in the books (6'5"" 250 lbs, blonde, etc) but overall a great flick.",1394841600,,256,4.953488372093023
5503472,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I rate this movie highly based on evaluating it as a package deal. Start with good source material from a hugely successful author, then mix in good performances, and just a superb job on the production. You name it, cinematography, editing, soundtrack, stunts, and this thing just has it all. No, it didn't win any awards, but I'll give it a big prize for not boring the crap out of me with preachy sniveling about society's woes. It's just a well made thriller that moves along at a good pace.",1394841600,,495,4.511111111111111

5503475,4,B00AS1Q8FW,The character stays pretty much to the character in the Jack Reacher books.  As always the movie leaves out much of the book and therefore it is better to see the movie first and then read the book.  Since this is usually  impossible there will be some disappointments.,1394841600,,269,4.5625

Geez I know he might not be everyone's favorite actor or person in ""real"" life, but what a character, what a story. I like the way it was told. Then I read a book, then another, and another, and another, and well you get the point. Ok Tom is too short, but really.

5503525,3,B00AS1Q8FW,the story and background of Jack was a bit muddled. And the violence in the movie was overwhelming.. more than I personally care for. There is no background on the bad guys or at least not much which makes the story rather two dimensional. It was okay.

5503546,4,B00AS1Q8FW,The thing I did not like about the movie was the lazy script writing that made the bad guys businessmen.  That made it less realistic.  Why not have them be Islamic terrorist or labor thugs?,1394582400,,190,4.4

5503554,4,B00AS1Q8FW,This film is a bit of a brainless potboiler but is gets a four star rating because it has no long dragged out boring skin scenes and buckets of blood and guts hanging out slow motion crap.  The car chase requires you to suspend belief in reality or truly believe that GM makes all of their cars out of cast iron six inches thick. On the other hand I don't worry too much when Good old John Wayne gets smacked with a chair and the chair breaks.  This is a good popcorn flick to watch when it is rainy and you don't want to go out.,1394496000,,529,3.981132075471698

I gave the movie three stars because I couldn't give it 2.5 stars.  The movie seems to be hurriedly put together and Tom Cruise, as always is good, but no one would say that this is his best performance.  I don't think this script gave him an opportunity to be at his best.  The movie seemed a bit contrived.

But I don't mean to be too negative.  The movie certainly will not be the best you have ever seen, but it won't be the worst one either.  Overall, the movie is worth watching if you have already seen all the great ones that have been released this month.",1394496000,,757,4.244755244755245

It was pretty easy to figure out (disclaimer, I tend to figure things out pretty quick anyway) and I sat through most of the movie waiting for them to reveal what they'd already revealed. The worst thing a movie like this can do, is draw undo attention to the clues ... this one did exactly that. Tom Cruises performance was somewhat lackluster and not one of his better performances. There were some good action scenes, but not enough to really carry the film. I'd recommend it for that weekend or evening where you just need something mindless to entertain you, and you can get it for free.",1394409600,,692,4.544

When I heard Tom Cruise was tapped for this movie, and considered how different he his physically from the way Jack Reacher is described, I thought it would never work. I've liked Tom Cruise in many movies, but c'mon, Jack Reacher?
I was bored one night and this was on Amazon Prime, so I thought I'd give it a try. Surprisingly, Cruise pulled it off. Not long into it I was completely captivated with how he managed the role. I was also worried that like so many movie adaptation of a novel, it would lose a lot in the translation, but I thought it was well done. I just wish there wasn't so much violence in contemporary cinema and TV. I'm old enough to notice how we in the U.S. seem to be getting progressively more and more addicted to violence in our entertainment, and like any other addiction, you have to keep upping the dosage to get the same effect. This does not bode well for our society. I often take a pass on movies & shows with tons of violence.

It was rated PG-13, but I would not want my 13 year old child seeing the bedroom scene or hearing the f word. (Call me old fashioned).  Lee Child never put sex or the f word in his books. It was just a brilliant mind and fighting machine that attracted so many followers.

The movie made an honest attempt telling you a little about Jack's character  regarding him being a drifter, has a great mind and memory.  I watched it twice, so I guess it was good.

  I think if the movie had introduced a new actor with more physical qualities in line  with the books, it would have been a box office success and we would be anticipating the next Jack Reacher movie.",1394409600,,805,4.2781456953642385

The actor should at least have been taller than his female counterpart in the film instead of looking at her at eye level.  This immensely popular book series falls flat on its face in this film version.  I sincerely hope that any future versions are far better cast.

However, I believe  If you approach a movie, a play, a novel, or real life - with  justice as the desired outcome from a senseless act of violence,  I believe you will find ""justice"" will be served by people of different colors, shapes, heights and facial features.  Tom may not follow the description of the character in the book  but he was believable as the character Jack Reacher.  This movie was slower paced than some of his big box office films, but it was, suspenseful, well written and well casted ( I especially appreciated the light moments contributed by  Robert Duvall ). I also liked the way the writer established  continuity from book to screen in some of the scenes ( he washed his shirt and hung it on the rack in the bathroom; he did not have luggage; he left town on Greyhound(?) or a bus and he did not have a cell phone.)  I am willing to allow Tom to grow into less physical, realistic, mature rolls.  Oh, the fight scenes were wonderful and appropriate for the character depicted on screen.  Thank you Tom for this change of pace movie.

5503643,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"Good script, great Lee Child book but if you are familiar with the character of Reacher, which frequently includes his physical description, Cruise just doesn't cut it!!  When I first heard about this movie it was exciting until we heard who was in the Reacher role...then we started laughing. Didn't bother to see in theater for that reason. I guess in Tinseltown
If you have enough money and a production company and rights to a book anyone can feed their ego miscasting themselves as the lead actor.
Two and a half stars is for the script, five stars for the book.",1394064000,,567,4.6138613861386135
5503644,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Unlike some of the other reviewers I didn't read the novel.  Therefore, I wasn't seeing Jack Reacher from the author's point of view (a huge imposing looking man).  I do however find it a bit of a stretch casting Tom Cruise as the main character because he doesn't come across as imposing a figure as the character was obviously meant to be. (maybe they should have cast the guy who played the CIA agent in RED)  I do think Tom Cruise is a pretty decent actor and because of his role in the Mission Impossible movies (Ethan Hunt)it is not a great departure from the type of character he has played in the past.  I recommend it if you like a thriller.",1394064000,,650,4.30327868852459

The character, Jack Reacher, checks all the boxes: uncompromising, virtuous, unrelenting and steely eyed.  Bad guys best beware....",1394064000,,328,5.392156862745098
5503646,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"Best part was the car chase; the rest was, well, like TV. Sorry. Cruise has made some very good films. If one sets out to do an action type film, then the measure is set. If one sets out to do a more cerebral film with touches of action, a separate bar is set. A  good example of the latter : The Jesse Stone films with Sellek.  I just didn't get the story or flow of this one. Just my opinion.",1394064000,,394,3.8518518518518516
5503647,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I did not get the chance to see this one in theaters.  I am glad I waited, because when the violence ramped up, I could stop the video and come back later.  The story was interesting, the characters were a bit beyond realistic, so I suppose it makes a good escapist story.  Be forewarned, however, that there is one scene that reminds me a bit of the current ""knockout game"" which, although it is an important plot point and brings forward a couple of the characters' motivations/makeup, is graphic and disturbing.",1394064000,,514,4.626373626373627

I warmed up to the movie after the opening sequence, and kept waiting for the inevitable romance between the two main characters, but you will need to see the movie to find out what happens.",1393977600,,457,4.264367816091954

I believe this is intended to be a series of additional sequels but not sure I would spend the money to support this. I believe The Bourne series with Matt Damen is a superior movie compared to this one (more believable). I despise car chases in movies and this one nearly made me shut it off.

I was attracted by the clever storyline--Jack Reacher is a good detective who is very observant and straight-forward, and gets to the bottom of a mystery. He also, however, seems to always be caught in violent situations, and, of course, fights off multiple enemies at once, always emerging unscathed.  Although Jack is always on the moral high ground--there are way too many dead bodies. And the bad people are always REALLY bad--and ""deserve"" to die. There is no subtlety here.
The movie is fast-moving and kept my interest throughout. But in the end I did not walk away from the movie with any real satisfaction that my two hours were well spent.",1393804800,,822,4.63013698630137

Even so, the detailed gruesome depravity and plotting of the villains is too well displayed, which may encourage some to view another person's life as ""cheap"" and expendable.  This movie is not unique in that regard, of course, but it always bothers me to see that even though I know it is just a movie and the actors get back up after the scene is shot.

5503778,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"The good:

Most of the movie. It struck me as an interesting plot with plenty of action, and violence as appropriate to the story, without the overdose of stress I sometimes feel when watching horrifically violent thriller-type movies. The actors seemed well-cast and did a good job. I should mention that I have never read the books, so I had no pre-set expectations.

As a gun owner myself, I appreciated that despite some trumped-up tense moments at the shooting range, gun enthusiasts were not ultimately made out to be the bad guys and gun ownership was not painted as the entry step on some inevitable descent into violent psychosis. Reacher's clear-eyed summary of gun politics, and especially his comment about ""drain cleaner and swimming pools"" earned my total forgiveness for any mileage the film got out of us ""gun nuts.""

The bad:

It sure looked like the ""slam-dunk"" suspected sniper was drugged and had his hands already tied behind his back when the police burst into his house. Or maybe I just mis-interpreted the sequence of events somehow. Otherwise that needed some explaining.

At one point the movie threatened to transform into a Three Stooges comedy for a minute or two. I had a good laugh at that scene, and appreciated the stress relief, yet it did not seem to fit with the rest of the film.

The villain in this movie just seemed TOO villainous for the story. He was so mysterious, so evil, so ruthless, so efficient, so in control, so all-knowing, so scarred and deformed... This is the type of super villain we expect in a James Bond movie, one set on nuclear mayhem or knocking the moon out of orbit, not one wanting to strong-arm a local business.

On the whole, the flaws were very minor and I enjoyed the movie. Cruise is an excellent actor, regardless of his quirks.",1393718400,,1799,4.710191082802548

The main character Jack Reacher  in the books  isn't the same as the movie  , But I cant think of a big enough Actor age wise to play Him . Since Tom Cruise has charisma an a little athletic  is about the only few Actors  that can attract an audience and sell tickets , if any one can remember Interview With A Vampire ?  the author hated Him in that role , but it sold tickets.

There were a few instances of over the top drama, but overall I found it entertaining and would watch additional films from this book series, as long as they don't go overboard on drama.",1393632000,,343,4.34375
5503786,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Hope they continue the series! Tom Cruise puts in a great performance, the story is intriguing and suspenseful enough tho make you grip the armrest really hard. Would like to see him again as Jack Reacher.",1393632000,,205,4.722222222222222
5503787,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"A very good action thriller, spoiled (for me) only by the obligatory moment when the hero throws aside his weapon to go at it mano a mano with the villain just to prove how tough he is. The surprise appearance late in the movie by Robert Duvall was very welcome. And Cruise managed to avoid being annoying, I think for the entire film.",1393632000,,335,4.333333333333333
5503788,3,B00AS1Q8FW,Good action flick with little redeeming social value.  Could have been better but for a couple of totally implausible and gratuitous sidings.  Still...entertaining enough to spend the time to watch.,1393632000,,198,5.566666666666666
5503789,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Very good and I enjoyed the plot. Tom Cruise was made for these type of roles. 4 star movie rating.,1393632000,,99,4.0
5503790,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"This is a very exciting action flick. Tom Cruise delivered a strong performance while avoiding the two dimensional pitfall of the action genre. This movie is solid action, escapist fun!",1393632000,,185,5.2
5503791,4,B00AS1Q8FW,sometimes i forget that tom cruise is a pretty good actor because of all the press he gets for that cult thing. sometimes you just have to get that silliness out of your head and enjoy the show. the story was kind of transparent but the acting was good and the action almost believable with the exception of that sniping display of duval's.,1393632000,,340,4.412698412698413

5503796,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Great action flick. Really enjoyed it! I was a little leery of Tom Cruise as the main character as he was not the person I had pictured as Jack, but he was great.",1393632000,,162,3.9393939393939394

5503802,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Jack Reacher was a decent action movie, though it was more like a detective find the truth movie than a shoot'em bang'em up type movie.  Not worth paying to see it in the movie theater, but entertaining online.",1393545600,,210,4.526315789473684
5503803,1,B00AS1Q8FW,I don't know why I even started to watch a Tom Cruise movie.  This one did not keep my attention.,1393545600,,97,3.85
5503804,5,B00AS1Q8FW,When I first learned that Tom Cruise was playing Jack Reacher I was appalled.  The movie was a pleasant surprise. Cruise played Reacher very well.  I also like movies that follow the book plot and this one did.  I look forward to another movie made from one of the Jack Reacher series.,1393545600,,285,4.4423076923076925
5503805,5,B00AS1Q8FW,This is a must see Tom Cruise movie. It is a good who done it and why movie. To me this was one of his better movies. Not anything like his MI movies,1393545600,,149,3.5454545454545454
5503806,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"In Lee childs Books Jack Reacher is  6'5"" and weight over 200 lbs,depending on the book you are reading. He is able to do things with his hands alone that when cruise does them it is a joke.

I DID NOT BOTHER TO WATCH PAST THE FIRST 20 MINUTES, IT IS A JOKE AND WILL PROBABLY RUIN THE CHANCES OF ANY SEQUELS.

THEY SHOULD HAVE CAST THE GUY WHO PLAYS IN ""PERSON OF INTEREST"" HE ""IS"" JACK REACHER !",1393545600,,396,3.9873417721518987

5503809,4,B00AS1Q8FW,I enjoyed this film. Tom likes to do his own driving which makes the driving scenes all the more interesting. I also know he had a mishap while doing a driving scene. Interesting story if you can hang up reality while watching. Enjoy!,1393545600,,234,4.465116279069767
5503810,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"what?!  this movie is HORRENDOUSLY bad.  bad plot, bad acting, slow, no action worth watching..... just Tom Cruise playing the person he always plays, which seems to be a very ego and violence-driven person.  YUCK",1393545600,,213,5.0285714285714285

5503814,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Very good movie! I have read a lot of the Jack Reaher books and love them. and Tom Cruise did a good job.his size wasn't exactly like Jack Reacher who was 6'5"" and 250 poundsso I so did not picture Tom Cruise for the role.  But once I got over that issue, he still did a good job and was a believable Jack Reacher..",1393545600,,315,3.921875

Tom Cruise...Jack Reacher?  Reacher is described throughout the book as a giant of a man....bear like....huge.....6'5 at least!!!  (That might not be exactly true)...but NOTHING like Tom Cruise.  Nothing.  This is not disparaging Tom Cruise's acting, because he ""acts"" pretty much the same in every moive he is in...if you like him, fine.  If not...whatever.  A comment about acting abilities would apply to the woman who played the lawyer.  I don't even know her name.  She had one expression throughout the movie...deer in the headlights.  Goodness.  I'm sure this movie must have cost a LOT to make....such a shame they casted it in this way.",1393545600,14,808,4.955223880597015
5503816,3,B00AS1Q8FW,Tom Cruise is bad fit for Jack Reacher. Should have been more like a contemporary Clint Eastwood.  Temporary relationship wasn't clear enough either.,1393545600,,149,5.478260869565218

5503822,5,B00AS1Q8FW,I am a big Jack Reacher fan. I have read all the books. The movie had the right amount of tension for his character. I would of chose someone different than Tom Cruise but he carried it off.,1393545600,,190,4.026315789473684

5503834,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Enjoyed this story of the reluctant hero who carries on the tradition of  the strong silent cowboy type.  Jack Reacher is a dyed in the wool patriot who has a deep rooted sense of justice and if needed can be judge, jury and executioner.  Mostly ""he just wants to be left alone"".  He is part criminal investigator, part vigilante but with an interesting balance of heart and head.  He tries to avoid violence, doesn't carry a gun but can engage in both with skill and style.

Cruise does a great job here playing it cool and calm but able to take care of business as it comes along.  One of the most interesting car chase sequences ever as it stays plausibly realistic.  The chase ends with an unusual outcome that is fun and supports Reachers affinity for taking the bus.  Cruise clearly is doing the precision driving him self and he is great at it.  Bravo,  looking forward to the next chapter in the Jack Reacher series.  Watch it, great entertainment.",1393459200,,956,4.526315789473684

5503839,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Fast moving mystery. Good acting and good supporting cast. A lot better than what's available on T.V. these days. Tom Cruise does a reasonably good job and makes the movie good entertainment.,1393459200,,191,5.0

5503856,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Would have given this a 5 star had they cast someone who looked the part. That being said Cruise kinda pulls it off. If you're a fan of the books all you have to do is get over the fact that its Tom Cruise. If you can do that you should like the movie I know I did.,1393372800,,265,3.586206896551724

Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher? I don't think so. Jack reacher (in the novels) is a BIG man, both in stature and in character. Even with elevator shoes and very flattering camera angles to disguise Cruise's diminutive stature, old Tom just doesn't make the cut.",1393372800,,534,4.804347826086956

Jack Reacher is supposed to be a huge man, like 6 foot 5 and 240 lbs and Tom Cruise doesn't come close to that.

5503876,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"I am a big Lee Child, Jack Reacher, fan and this movie completely missed the mark. Tom Cruise is not believable as Jack Reacher and so many things were changed to suit Hollywood's vision the story is barely recognizable from the book. Some cutting and editing needs to be done to make a book fit the silver screen and that is to be expected. This movie, though, changed critical elements completely and in doing so caused the original storyline to lose way too much. The setting is completely different, the addition of the car chase scene completely unnecessary, and several other bits. What I found most unsatisfying, though, was the final confrontation scene when they move in on The Zec. Not even close!!!! And why was there no character development on The Zec?? Even his cronies were changed for the movie...they way they dress, the way they act, and their accents. What's more is there is no development on Barr and they completely did away with his sister and the interactions with Reacher. Also missing is the television reporter and her interactions with Reacher...it was, after all, her car he takes not the lawyers. Ugh! I could go on and on but what's the point? The movie is a disappointment. If I had never read the book, I think I may have enjoyed this movie but it's not likely because there is just zero character development and no gripping storyline.",1393372800,,1369,4.708333333333333

Then again it might have been to ease those who know Jack Reacher away from the description of the man.  Cruise could not be more different from the Lee Child character in stature, but attempted to simulate as much as possible his personality.

5503894,1,B00AS1Q8FW,I give this a very bad rating because the language is highly offensive to me. They use the Lord's name in vain all thru the movie.  And it does not even add any value whatsoever to the plot or the acting. Did not watch all of it.,1393286400,,229,3.872340425531915

5503926,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Wasn't sure Tom Cruise (at five-seven) would pull it off but he did  okay playing Jack Reacher (six-five, 200+ pounds) and carried the movie, which otherwise was mediocre.  Lots of camera-angle tricks helped with his lack of height and it appears Cruise spent some time at the gym getting his upper body buff because his bare chest appeared to be hard as a rock in the movie, which is good for someone his age.

As generally happens when books are turned into movies, fans of Jack Reacher will probably be disappointed.  I am not a Reacher fan, but did read ""The Killing Floor"" (Book 1) and ""One Shot"" (Book 9), the latter of which this movie is based on, prior to watching the movie.

I don't want to give away any spoilers, but the movie was a far cry from the characters Lee Child created in his books.  According to news reports, Tom Cruise owns the rights to ALL Jack Reacher novels, so he will run the show (with Paula Wagner).

In this first Reacher movie, more time should have been spent including characters from the book that are left out in lieu of the cheesy what-seemed-to-be-30-minute car chase, that is for sure!

What amazes me is that the John Grisham movies (which the author claims to have little if any involvement in) are much closer to the books he wrote than most movies that are based on other books I have read.  Not sure why that is, but there isn't one ""mediocre"" Grisham movie, to date; they all rock!

Hopefully Cruise/Wagner Productions will pay attention to some of the criticism so future Reacher movies they make will be closer to the story told by the author.",1393200000,,1594,4.522648083623693

I forgot how well he could actually act, nicely written, nice pace. Pleasantly surprised at that he would play the Jack Reacher character's understated strength so nicely. I also like Courtney Jai as the villain although I loved him in Spartacus as well. Nice way to spend a Friday night with the hubby snuggled on the couch.",1393113600,,476,4.420454545454546

Unfortunately, it suffers from a few typical Tom-Cruise movie moments towards the end. Think the fight in which he lets himself be blindfolded and fells two attacking grizzlies with a single jumpkick. Cough. To be clear - this is not an actual scene in the movie, but you get the idea. The movie is 4 stars for about half of the way - I loved the writing around seeing-the-gaps/seeing-what-beyond-the-obvious, but it falls down on the last 20 minutes.",1393113600,,547,4.829787234042553

Cruise sometimes had him relying in others for the analysis.  Reacher is such an inexperienced driver in the books, but here's Cruise having him do a Bullit-type chase with the villains.  And though I'm a Cruise fan, I prefer him in light-hearted roles.  He's just not the menacing type.  Otherwise, it was OK as an adventure film.",1393113600,,479,4.642857142857143

Did it get and keep my interest. Did I want to root for the characters. Did I care what happened to them. This movie achieved all of that. It told a good story and solved a good and interesting mystery and it did it with some good action. It had very good production values. Neat timing and good dialog with good acting. I am sorry I didn't pay to go see it on the big screen. Simple as that.,1393027200,,555,4.009009009009009

Rosamund Pike was an excellent addition to the blinding Cruise domination  in most films. The story was only messed with minimally compared with most films adapted from books.  Well thought out, well written, well produced and well directed.  No obvious special effects or CGI.  Well worth the time to watch!",1393027200,,447,5.068493150684931

5503986,4,B00AS1Q8FW,I think this is one of his best efforts in years. He has actually turned into a fairly good action performer.

I watched this movie because I wanted to see the special effects that would make the diminutive Cruise into the physically-imposing Reacher.  There were no such special effects, and thus, the scenes of violent encounters with groups of 'bad guys' were simply unbelievable.  Thus, the premise of the plot was diminished.  A suspension of reality is necessary, many times, to really enjoy some movies - but this one was just too far outside the realm of possibility.  Very poor casting, Cruise as Reacher!

But I decided to give it a shot being that Amazon Prime didn't really provide a list of promising free movies (example: Abduction). I am extremely impressed. Tom Cruise played fabulously well in this movie. Everything felt in sync. The action, acting and plot were all played perfectly. But I did find there to be scenes like the assistance from bus passengers to be implausible. But then again it is a movie. I was overall very satisfied. It wasn't a high budget James Bond movie.

Sure the action is there - that is what Jack Reacher is all about. But if you have read any of the series, Jack Reacher is  6' 4"" and 250 pds plus of solid muscle, a real Military MP. I am really surprised that Lee Child let this fly. Must have got a bucket load of money to compromise his character. Guess book sales were not enough.

I have read the entire Reacher series including short stories and Cruise was one of the worst choices for the lead I could have ever imagined. Just goes to show how no movie can do a book justice. I just hope that Lee Child grows some balls and doesn't let this continue with another crappy rendition of another one of his books with T Cruise as Reacher. Go ahead Tom, jump on the couch again....I thought that was pathetic but would give you more stars for that than your performance as J Reacher.

Many times the movies just don't satisfy like the books and this was the case here.  The media was focused on Cruise not being the size of Reacher but that didn't bother me as much as the way Reacher was portrayed.  He just didn't seem like the character.

5504028,5,B00AS1Q8FW,A new super hero is born!  Tom Cruise does a great job of blending action adventure with great one liners.  Will entertain!,1392854400,,123,4.545454545454546
5504029,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"The movie followed the book fairly well.  In spite of the obvious physical discrepancies, Tom Cruise did a good job of making Jack Reacher come to life.  Curious if more books in the series will be turned into movies.",1392854400,,217,4.538461538461538
5504030,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"Tom Cruise is NOT Jack Reacher. Reacher is supposed to be a physically imposing man, Tom Cruise is not. Thin story and sub-par acting.",1392854400,,134,4.625
5504031,5,B00AS1Q8FW,Great movie. Lot of action with a good story. Another cruise classic that I'd recommend to about anyone who likes badass gun fights.,1392854400,,132,4.782608695652174
5504032,3,B00AS1Q8FW,Not Cruises best work but really keeps your attention.  It's not constant action but pretty close.  James Duval is a great character.,1392854400,,133,5.0
5504033,3,B00AS1Q8FW,It was a pretty predictable movie but it was entertaining.  It had some action and the special affects were ok,1392854400,,110,4.5
5504034,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Entertaining action movie.  Good popcorn movie.  Love the books.  Cruise does a good job with the Reacher character despite the physical differences.,1392854400,,149,5.681818181818182
5504035,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Loaded with twists and turns, never a dull minute, grat story though not completely in line with the book.
 Quick paced, easy to watch Cruise is good.",1392854400,,150,4.555555555555555
5504036,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"Cheese beyond belief.. had a huge sense of dejavu watching this, seems like something I had seen before. Good for a action shooter/I don't care about reality mivie.. but for what I was wanting at the time, it didn't hit the mark.",1392854400,,229,4.476190476190476
5504037,3,B00AS1Q8FW,It is a good storyline and some areas were very suspenseful. I didn't enjoy some of the actors because they were a little over-acting. Overall a good movie,1392854400,,155,4.571428571428571
5504038,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"This was very exciting and fast paced which is what Tom Cruise does best.

He seems able to pick good if not great story lines and make a movie come to life.",1392854400,,157,3.90625
5504039,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"I just wish that they had stayed closer to the book but when Cruise is directing, producing and acting I realize it has to be all about him. It was OK....good action, but as I said the book was so much better.",1392854400,,209,4.0
5504040,5,B00AS1Q8FW,I was not sure Tom could pull it off but he made it really work! Great story and a great movie!,1392854400,,95,3.5714285714285716

5504042,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"It was a generic action movie, very predictable.  There was nothing different about Tom Criuise's portrayal of this character. Just an OK movie",1392854400,,143,5.217391304347826

5504044,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Liked the overall plot line, some of the twists. Kept my interest throughout. Cruise is good as Reacher, Rosamunde Pike I liked as the attorney.",1392768000,2,144,4.8
5504045,2,B00AS1Q8FW,This is not a very interesting movie.  It has a very long car and crash chase and lots of shoot em up scenes.  I've seen similar stuff in movies countless times.  I guess 13 year old boys might enjoy it.,1392768000,,203,4.025
5504046,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Was really impressed with this film. As much as Tom Cruise is a whacko he pulled off another great film.,1392768000,2,104,4.25
5504047,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"This movie was a pleasant surprise.  The action is intense and the story is enjoyable.  Tom Cruise does a great job of conveying an intimidating character without being physically imposing.  There are a few scenes that I think would have been better with an ""R"" rating though I understand that the PG-13 helps the film reach a broader audience.",1392768000,3,344,4.796610169491525

5504051,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"Being a Reacher devotee, i cringed when I heard that Cruise would play him in the movies. I refused to pay to see the movie, but decided to watch it on Amazon. I wasn't disappointed, Cruise could never be Reacher. Just a small example; Reachers, size 6'5"" (almost a foot taller than Cruise) Reacher's favorite move in a fight; headbutt to the nose. Oh well, it entertained me while I was ill.",1392768000,2,392,4.458333333333333

5504053,5,B00AS1Q8FW,Good entertaining movie.  If you like action movies this will fill the bill.  It has it's trills and some funny moments.,1392768000,,120,4.666666666666667
5504054,3,B00AS1Q8FW,I didn't like the story but I like tom he is the best actor. so over all it is not that cool movie but it is great for spending you Saturday night with your love ones.,1392768000,,167,3.6666666666666665
5504055,5,B00AS1Q8FW,A very good detective story piece. Tom was not to self centered in this one and the story did not give the movie away.,1392768000,,118,3.9583333333333335
5504056,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"Not a fan of jack reacher after seeing this.  Although many of the action movies have characters that are super human yet enjoyable, jack is so obnoxious it's annoying.",1392768000,,168,4.793103448275862
5504057,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"But when is that ever true anyway. I know most Tom Cruise movies aren't going to be winning any Golden Globes but I still watch (almost) all of them because they are quick, have decent story arks, and good production quality. I would liken this to MI: 3 with less explosions....",1392768000,,278,4.470588235294118

5504059,4,B00AS1Q8FW,It loses just one star for weak character development but I really enjoyed watching this. I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan and knowing he had to be standing on a phonebook to look these other actors in the eye can be a distraction...but he pulled it off nicely.,1392768000,,258,4.285714285714286
5504060,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"I watched the movie, but I could not tell you what it was about. I have lost a lot of interest in Tom Cruise over the past few years and guess it shows if I watch one of his movies and can't remember what it was about.",1392768000,,218,3.6595744680851063
5504061,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Typical thriller with a few twists and a good car chase scene.  i would recommend for those folks who enjoy this genre,1392768000,,118,4.363636363636363
5504062,2,B00AS1Q8FW,Its as though the intent was to have Tom Cruise play Jethro Gibbs as a movie length NCIS. The blonde actress looked perpetually surprised.,1392768000,,138,4.791666666666667

5504066,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"This movie should have been called ""Mission Impossible XVIII.""
I  could never buy Tom Cruise as a badass He's made a few good movies i.e. Jerry Maguire, Magnolia, but have made a LOT of lousy movies. JR falls into the latter category.",1392768000,,234,4.571428571428571

5504070,2,B00AS1Q8FW,Tom Cruise is not Jack Reacher!!! Sorry ...bad casting!!! Cruise did not capture the Jack Reacher persona. I am a Jack Reacher fan and was very disappointed. If you never read the books you may find it a perfectly fine movie..,1392768000,,226,4.536585365853658
5504071,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Expected more rouge, in your face, kick butt action/attitude from Reacher.  If a person had not read the Reacher series of books by Lee Child, it would have been hard to follow.",1392768000,,177,4.53125

5504073,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"If my memory serves me I have read a few of the jack reacher books. I like the off beat nature of the main character and his ability to solve issues although he really doesn't want to be involved. while his success seems to be almost super hero in nature, the plot is entertaining. always enjoy a movie where the good guy solves the problem against overwhelming odds, says goodbye to the girl and rides off into the sunset.",1392768000,,423,4.367088607594937
5504074,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I'm one of those Jack Reacher book fans who was disgusted by the choice of Tom Cruise to fill Reacher's shoes. When I had a chance to watch this movie on Amazon Prime, I figured it was worth the cost (nothing). It turns out I was pleasantly surprised. If you put aside all you know about Jack Reacher, and just watch it as a Tom Cruise action movie, it was totally entertaining.",1392768000,,378,4.263888888888889
5504075,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Always skeptical of movie adaptations of a book, Tom Cruise as producer did an excellent job with this. It retains all of the elements of the book. Would have given 5 stars if Tom Cruise (as Jack Reacher) was taller, but he also did an excellent job with the character. I hope he does some more of Jack Reacher novels in the same manner.",1392768000,,337,4.28125

i usually endure tom cruise's dead eyed impression of a real human due to big budgets and talented directors, this movie evidently had neither.",1392681600,,621,4.971153846153846

5504084,1,B00AS1Q8FW,Have read almost all the books but Tom Cruise cast as the protagonist Jack Reacher is just a joke.  A lot of the other casting choices in this film were also poorly made.  Ruined the movie and has put me off the books.,1392681600,2,218,4.046511627906977
5504085,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"So the story has some depth, and the key characters generally pull of their roles.  That said, is it really that much to expect that if you're going to portray a 'shooter', that you take a class so you can at least look generally credible?  Then there's the equipment selection.  Why use an M1A for a distance shot?  You can build a fairly accurate M1A, but most marksmen who know their trade wouldn't bother, there are too many better options available for the same price point.  Then on to the criminal enterprise, the villain. Why would a criminal construction syndicate need CL III firearms?  How many Jack Reacher's are there operating against them?  A few men of limited moral's with a sidearm, sure, 6+ henchmen all armed with automatic (or possibly 3 rd burst), is only going to draw federal attention.

5504088,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"Mainly this movie is an embarrassment.  Tom Cruise has been in plenty of good films but this has to be his worst.

Recall the opening scene of Kung Fu Panda: the panda dreaming he's a complete bad ass.  Then he wakes up and the audience breaths a collective sigh of relief that they just didn't waste $25 to be tortured by 2 hours of mindless adolescent drivel.

That's this movie; except nobody wakes up. it just floats along in a fantasy of power that leaves you pitying the writer for the number of school yard beatings he must have endured to have scarred him so far into adulthood.",1392681600,,586,4.398148148148148
5504089,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"It is entertaining for the 2 hours + of the movie. It's not great, but the intrigue, clever investigation and action are well mixed. Action scenes are not gratuitous, while the bar fight seems like it at first, it turned out to be a nice plot mover in the end. Not a lot of big explosions and things, but it is quite good (clever action is better than big fireworks for me). Nonetheless, it's not a movie I would buy in Blu Ray. However, watching it for ""free"" with Amazon Prime is just the perfect price, one of those things that add up to making the Prime service worth it.",1392681600,,575,4.236363636363636

5504098,3,B00AS1Q8FW,I do like Tom Cruise but after reading all the Jack Reacher books by Lee Child it was hard to take him seriously as Jack Reacher.  He's too old and too short.,1392681600,,158,3.9375

5504113,4,B00AS1Q8FW,I thought it was cool. Kind of a mystery with action. Car chase sceen was awesome. Tom Cruise is not of real Jack Reacher size but he plays it well,1392681600,,147,3.933333333333333

5504125,3,B00AS1Q8FW,As a big fan of the Reacher book series Tom Criuse did a fair job in the role. What was lacking from the film is Reacher's imposing physical presence and attitude just this side of the lawless. Cruise didn't sell the I came here to punish the former rogue sniper.

5504128,3,B00AS1Q8FW,Tom Cruise is just OK as usual....Mr. Overactor. I'm thinking he would be better suited for soap operas than dramas.,1392681600,,116,4.85

5504131,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"There are good action scenes, and the film captures the mood of the novels. I just couldn't get past the miscasting of Cruise as Reacher. Werner Herzog does a good acting turn as a scary Russian villain, even though his accent is German, not Russian. Film gets silly toward the end. Robert Duvall is a positive surprise.",1392681600,,320,4.631578947368421

5504134,3,B00AS1Q8FW,The overall plot is kind of lame. Other than the 3 actors that are worth anything the rest is pretty bad. Tom Cruise seems to be trying too hard.,1392595200,,145,4.0344827586206895
5504135,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Great acting by Cruise and good acting by rest of cast. Never heard of Jack Reacher before but this was a good pic. You had to suspend reality (above the baseline of any movie) a couple of times but that was not big deal. It really kept you interested all the way through. Also not a big deal: when Jack refers to the bad guy in the movie making his own 'bullets', I assume he did that for the sake of the attorney listening to him - being that the correct term: he makes his own 'cartridges' can be confusing to the general public.",1392595200,,532,4.125
5504136,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"There was some terrible dialog in the early appearance of Cruise, but once the really awkward opening was over, it normalized. As a writer, I understand what they were trying to do, but there was probably a better approach to the opening.

Once rolling the movie got to be good and sometimes even smart.

The scene with Reacher questioning the defense attorney about what she learned from the victims and his read of it was quite good, although a bit predictable.

If you like the violent, tough-guy mystery, who-dun-it story you'll probably like this even if you don't like Cruise.",1392595200,,582,4.8

5504139,1,B00AS1Q8FW,I wish I could rate this at zero stars.  What a horrid piece of junk.  Tom Cruise needs to retire from acting before he embarrasses himself again.,1392595200,7,146,4.37037037037037
5504140,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Lot of fuss was made about Tom Cruise being cast as Jack in this movie.  Seemed like a mismatch to me also.  After seeing the movie, the director clearly made a significant effort to eliminate Tom's diminutive stature from becoming prominent in this picture, and Mr. Cruise, being the excellent actor that he is (no matter what you think of him personally) does a very good job giving an accurate portrayal of Jack's character.  I was impressed with Tom Cruise's performance and the screenplay we actually pretty well done.  Obviously hard to include all of the back story and details from the book, but all-in-all a good capture of the novel on the screen.",1392595200,,657,4.7368421052631575

5504143,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"There was lots of action, quality acting and a plot that wasn't overly predictable. Jack Reacher had some amazing talent but not to the point of being totally unrealistic.

5504150,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"This movie was reasonably true to the novel.  Tom Cruise really immersed himself into the character of Jack Reacher.  It is had to identify by appearance whether a stranger is a good guy or a bad guy.  The main character, Jack Reacher, is both a good guy and a bad guy.  Cruise has managed to portray both convincingly",1392595200,,318,4.431034482758621

I like the character, although he is kind of underdeveloped and one-dimensional, it is what it is meant to be. It is not serious literature. The same could be said of this movie. I didn't really want to like this movie since as has been said, although it is kind of nit-picking, Tom Cruise is definitely not the Jack Reacher of the books. He is no 6'5"" 250 lb. giant, but he manages the role well despite that. Grab some popcorn and a soda and just have fun with the movie. I enjoyed it despite myself.",1392595200,,611,4.275862068965517

I loved many of the lines he delivers to the thugs before he takes them on.  There's was one, I'll have to fudge...but I think it was:""the next thing you're going to see is the inside of an ambulance.""

Movie is watchable, I guess, but is pretty dumb and clumsily put together. I'm thinking that a lot of things were left out from the book that would probably make the whole thing make more sense and be much more consistent and intelligently paced.",1392422400,,573,4.305555555555555

I like Tom Cruise in some of movies but definitely not this one. His typical good looking character not working at all in this movie. I don't buy one bit about how people react to him. Maybe bad casting or bad plot. I don't buy why so many people bought lots of books what I see it here.",1392422400,,537,3.926605504587156

5504248,3,B00AS1Q8FW,anyone who has ever read any Reacher books know that he is well over 6' there is no way Cruise could pull that off and that was the major down fall for me.,1392336000,,155,3.727272727272727

5504251,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Maybe it is too difficult to successfully make a movie out of Child""s Reacher novels. The Reacher character, from the first novel, has always been a large man with a ""hit the other guy first"" mentality.

There is only one scene that made me uncomfortable - just a bit too grisly for me, but the rest of the film has what I would call moderate violence related to bad guys getting what they deserve.  I would not allow younger children to see the movie.

I enjoyed the movie enough to watch it again with a couple of people who had not seen it.",1392336000,,543,4.294117647058823

5504255,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"I'm a Jack Reacher fan and, while the storyline is fairly accurately portrayed, the confidence without being cocky is not. Tom Cruise plays it with little man swagger, which is far from how the character is in the books. Supporting characters were generally good if somewhat invisible. Robert Duvall plays crusty well, and did so in this movie.

Generally, a good action flick, just can't get past 5'6"" when expecting 6'5"", and the imposing figure it implies. Tom is not imposing.

Worth watching, but missed the boat. Much better than many lower budget action flicks, just coulda' been better with someone more imposing like Alexander Skarsgard (True Blood) or Liam Neeson, though he may be a little old for the role.

I hope the makers got enough benefit from the Tom Cruise franchise to offset blindness of the choice. Well, I was stupid enough to pay matinee price at the theater, but would not have paid had it not been free on Prime. Fact!",1392336000,,945,4.75

5504257,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Overall, I thought this flick was entertaining. I like movies like this and was pleasantly surprise it was void of sex and gory killings (at least this version).
There were some ""unrealistic scenes"" (Driving backwards at high speed in the dark while staying below the window line in the dark in unfamiliar place), but I was able to let goof that for the adventurousness of the movie.",1392336000,,383,4.731343283582089

Which he does. A LOT! A Dwayne Johnson type person. Not a wimpy Tom Cruise type. Terrible terrible choice. It's like watching Woody Allen play the Incredible Hulk. It just doesn't fit, and you spend the whole movie thinking ""this isn't working"" because the other characters can't be portrayed correctly. I mean, who the heck would be even a little bit physically intimidated by Cruise upon meeting him? Pee-Wee Herman? Could have been SOOO much better, and a sequel gold mine. Now, it's screwed.

5504275,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"The fast paced action and interesting 'keep you guessing"" plot makes this this a great ""jock flick"".  Cruise is at his usual best!",1392249600,,130,4.6521739130434785
5504276,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I had heard of the book series, but I prefer historical novels to thrillers. So I wasn't familiar with Reacher. Now that I am, I'll consider a Reacher novel for my next flight. Reacher is unique as a mysterious but purposeful, powerful, and omniscient drifter in this movie. I'm presuming that's his M.O., which could enable many heretofore impossible plot opportunities--and make them sound realistic.",1392249600,,402,5.2
5504277,4,B00AS1Q8FW,great movie. Had read the books and was not sure if Tom Cruise could pull it off. But we enjoyed it and look for more movies about Jack Reacher!,1392249600,,144,4.0
5504278,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Found this and watched because we like action/crime movies.  A good plot and NO SEX (gratuitous or otherwise) or awful language.  Very refreshing entertainment.  Not even a big Tom Cruise fan.,1392249600,,192,5.129032258064516
5504279,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"I guess I am a little biased - I find the work of Tom Cruise to be formula and adolescent generally, and in that way, this show does not disappoint.  He has found a reasonably interesting formula in the ""Mission Impossible"" series but I suspect that there will not be a Jack Reacher 2.  If they do bring out a second Jack Reacher, I'll pass.  Yawn...",1392249600,,350,4.2727272727272725

5504281,4,B00AS1Q8FW,I was disappointed when Tom Cruise was cast as Jack Reacher.  Lee Child's Reacher is a really big guy and his size dictates his modus operandum.  Iwas pleasantly surprised at how well Cruise fit my mind's image of Jack Reacher.  I give the movie two thumbs up.,1392249600,,260,4.48936170212766
5504282,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"previews make it look like a bad, predictable car movie with tom cruise doing his own driving  car chase is like 5 minutes of the whole movie.  pleasantly surprised",1392249600,,164,4.620689655172414
5504283,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I really enjoyed this film.  It was full of action, though a bit violent.  The cast all did a good job.  I recommend it especially if you like action thrillers.",1392249600,,160,4.266666666666667
5504284,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Movie had a good plot and was interesting from the start.

I gave it 4 stars as it is has a lot of violence, typical of this type of movie.  The plot was believable and did not have too many loopholes in its investigative logic.  There was one scene that was a bit unbelievable, but didn't ruin the movie.  Car chase scene was a bit over the top as well.  If you enjoy action packed, investigative type movies, this is a good viewing choice.",1392249600,,441,4.2023809523809526
5504285,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Cruise has neither the physical size nor demeanor of the Reacher depicted in the novels.
He is just wrong for the part.
I believe he owns the rights for this movie. If he owns the rights to other Reacher novels
he best choose a new actor for the part or they will bomb as well.
I have read several Reacher novels and I cannot determine which one this movie is based on.
Anyone know?
It seems to be a composite..",1392249600,,411,4.15
5504286,5,B00AS1Q8FW,It was a big surprise. I found it to be really enjoyable and original.  I admit I'm a tom Cruise fan but I think anyone will enjoy this film,1392249600,,140,3.8275862068965516
5504287,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"When it comes to Jack Reacher, Tom Cruise is as far from the mark as you can get.  Jack Reacher is 6'5"".  Tom Cruise is tiny.  He isn't credible as Reacher and unless he grows about a foot and adds 100 pounds he will never be.  Lee Child wanted a movie soooo bad that he compromised his character (Reacher) rather than insist on a formidable actor like Ray Stevenson be cast for the part.  I'm glad I waited for the movie to come to cable.  I would have been really upset had I paid to see it in a theater.",1392249600,,506,4.01
5504288,1,B00AS1Q8FW,The only reason to watch this is for Robert Duvall's character. The blonde chic acts with the same expression the entire time. Her contrived emoting is so far from reality it would be more believable if she was reacting to an astounding bowel movement she had just nestled in her undies. Her breathing is even fake as hell. Then there is Tom's acting or whatever you would call it... showing up. His depiction of a man that escaped society and fell of the grid is absolutely unmotivated with a total loss of character history. He is supposed to be able to kill as a vigilante and depict a man that doesn't care anymore. Just two words for him. You suck. Like a vacuum black hole in space. His ever consuming ego sucks so much attention that the exit from his ass sprays fecal matter all over the audience. It is insulting to ones intelligence and not only did I lose time watching this but also brain cells.,1392249600,2,907,4.437125748502994

5504290,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"This movie was somewhat predictable but well acted and well done. Lots of action, which is why we watch movies like this. I loved the Jack Reacher character and his critical decision at the end.",1392249600,,194,4.571428571428571
5504291,4,B00AS1Q8FW,I have wanted to see this movie since I saw the preview in the theaters but my wife was just not interested. Watched it last week on Amazon prime and would definitely recommend it.,1392249600,,180,4.323529411764706
5504292,5,B00AS1Q8FW,A great action film based on the action Novel series. Sometimes you just need something simple like an action film to pass the time. It did have a couple of really good twists in the plot that made you think too.,1392249600,,212,4.195121951219512
5504293,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"This is one of Tom Cruse's best rolls. Hope there is a follow-up movie. Like
all action movies these days it would be nice to leave out sparking bullets.",1392249600,,153,4.310344827586207
5504294,4,B00AS1Q8FW,This movie was entertaining. It has a couple nice twists and plenty of action. A typical Tom Cruise movie kind of like Mission impossible. It was worth watching on prime.,1392249600,,170,4.7
5504295,5,B00AS1Q8FW,What looked on the surface to be a random shooting spree turns into something that no one could imagine except Jack Reacher.,1392249600,,124,4.681818181818182
5504296,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Well made movie with some intense action scenes. Jack Reacher is an interesting character that you grow more fond of throughout the movie. Highly recommend it.,1392249600,,159,5.153846153846154

5504299,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"I have read most of the Reacher series, written by Lee Child. They are good, but not great books; more for entertaining read than anything else, in my opinion. So goes the movie. It never stayed in theaters very long, either... In spite of Tom Cruise's star power... Which was a major gaffe to begin with. In the books, Reacher is like 6' 3"" and 250lb. Cruise is... Well, you know, not. Like casting Paul Newman to play Ari Ben Caanen in Exodus. I know why they did it, but it was wrong casting.... Period. Overall the movie is adequate, if you are looking for something to watch, with no real substance.",1392249600,,604,4.401785714285714

5504303,5,B00AS1Q8FW,Tom Cruise is such a great actor and this is a great movie. Enough action to keep it interesting but a good plot line too.,1392163200,,122,3.92

5504305,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"Watched this with reasonable expectations and it was worse than I could have imagined. I gave it one star but this movie is more like a black hole, consuming stars leaving nothing but an empty void. Pretty much what it did to tom cruise. Worst move of Cruise's career and the worst movie I watched in 2013. Poorly casted with horrible acting, horrible writing, and generally horrible from start to finish. I can almost always find something nice to say. Not here. Just horrible.",1392163200,,478,4.7023809523809526

5504308,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"This movie is well acted and written, and the investment in the characters pays off, as it makes us care so much more about the action, which is itself well executed.  I don't think this movie did as well as it could have because it was released so close to the Sandyhook tragedy, which admittedly turned me off to these kinds of movies in general for a long time, and still to some extent.  But, I gave this one a chance, and it delivered.  As brutal as this movie can be, even characters with no dialogue (who in other films would be afterthoughts to get the plot going) are fleshed out, and we are given real reasons to care about them as human beings.  It's also interesting to see criminal proceedings from the defense's point of view, which is also rare.  And, although I know that many Jack Reacher fans were disappointed with Tom Cruise's casting, speaking as a Reacher novice, Cruise was convincing and totally gripping as his character as written for this film.  It's not the vision for the character in the novels, but as with all his other roles, Cruise's commitment to his craft shines through and makes for a compelling leading man.  Rosamund Pike, Jai Courtney, and Werner Herzgog are also great, as is David Oyelowo.  Everybody is on their A game here, and I give this movie an A, if you are into this sort of film.",1392163200,,1331,4.471074380165289
5504309,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Intriguing plot. Tom Cruise does a good job as a rogue ""private investigator"" with specialized military skills. Not a lot of action but interesting storyline. Worth watching!",1392163200,,174,5.481481481481482
5504310,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I was pleasantly surprised at how well this movie was.  Tom actually played a great role.  In fact, I would say it was probably my favorite performance by him.  It was not overacted at all.  Great supporting cast.  Good action/drama/mystery.",1392163200,,241,4.925

5504318,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I hear people all the time saying ""I don't like Tom Cruise, so I won't watch his movies."" It's kind of like I feel that I am the only person in the US that likes the band Nickelback, but they sell out every show!

This was an entertaining movie that held my attention from beginning to end. The wife fell asleep, but that didn't surprise me at all. I like conspiracy movies and when they have an ""x-military"" theme, I like them even more.

I streamed this on a ROKU XD player and it looked, sounded, and streamed great.

I liked it! But don't take my word on it. Watch it yourself!",1392163200,,581,4.169642857142857

5504320,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I didn't expect much from this movie after not fuss was made about it in the box office even though it stared Tom Cruise.  But this movie was very entertaining.  It included some suspense, action, and some humorous moments.  Not to be taken too serious but it was an all-around entertaining experience.  More than what I bargained for.  Again, it should not be taken too serious, as the ending and some of the plot left me scratching my head like: What?!?!",1392163200,,456,4.580246913580247

5504325,1,B00AS1Q8FW,I tired to accept Mr. Cruise as Reacher but failed. The movie concentrated on his star quality rather than developing the character into the force he is in the books. As a result there was no sense of an intimidating physical person. Instead Reacher was a little guy who surprisingly could fight and defeat larger foes.,1392163200,,319,4.714285714285714
5504326,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Totally surprised me when this turned out to be an interesting, entertaining, thought provoking movie. This is a good example that over the top special effects are not what makes a good movie, it's the story!",1392163200,,208,4.805555555555555
5504327,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I was quite surprised with Tom Cruise's performance. After many years as a fan of the Reacher books, I was not sure how the diminutive Cruise could come across as 6' 5"" Reacher. Once I pushed that from my mind, I found the movie quite enjoyable.

5504354,5,B00AS1Q8FW,I have watched this movie twice and have enjoyed it both times. I don't like Tom Cruse personally but he sure makes good movies. There's lots of action and a good story line. Pop some corn sit back and enjoy...,1392076800,,210,4.275
5504355,3,B00AS1Q8FW,Cruise is not the epitome of 6 ft plus blond Reacher.  He is a great actor who manages to do a fair job with the character.  I just found the film to be short on story and long on predictable action film cliches.,1392076800,,212,3.9069767441860463
5504356,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Wasn't sure I could see Tom Cruise as 6'5"", 250 lb Jack Reacher but he did OK.  I'd watch him in another Reacher.",1392076800,,113,3.9130434782608696

5504358,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Jack Reacher followed a formulaic script but not much was required of it from me. It was engrossing and moved along at a good pace with some unexpected twists and turns that kept it from being too formulaic.
 Tom Cruise didn't match up to the character I had formed in my mind from reading multiple Jack Reacher novels but that's not necessarily a fault against the movie. There was quite a bit of violence- I supposed we were to get the message that Jack was indestructible. It was certainly better than anything on regular TV!",1392076800,,528,4.557894736842106

5504362,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Good entertainment.  Has a nice mystery and is pretty much classic Tom Cruise. I think it is very similar to a Grisham story.,1392076800,,125,4.434782608695652

5504364,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"In the description, it said Jack Reacher was an ""explosive thriller"". Unfortunately, it felt more like a Sherlock Holmes episode than an actual thriller filled with explosions. Furthermore, the predictability and unnatural dialogue further hindered the movie experience. But, some elements were pretty cool like the few fight scenes and cinematography, so I enjoyed it for that.",1392076800,,378,5.649122807017544
5504365,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I enjoyed it, not over done.  Not sure I would call it thrilling, but if you enjoy the genre, it is a good movie and good fun.",1392076800,,126,3.6666666666666665

5504371,4,B00AS1Q8FW,I thought Tom was very good in this role as Jack Reacher even though Tom does not have the physical characteristics as the actual fictional character he portrays Jack Reacher very well.,1392076800,,185,4.8125
5504372,5,B00AS1Q8FW,This is a good movie. Lot of action and intriguing story line in a who done it type movie. Highly recommended.,1392076800,,110,4.285714285714286

5504375,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I watched Jack Reacher on the recommendation of a friend but was not anticipating much going into the film.  However, the movie suprised me with it's thoughtful suspense, reasonably paced action, and the weaving of a story line that left you wondering almost to the very end who the inside man was.  While this is a typical action/suspense movie in most ways, the cinamatography was well done, the backdrop of Pittsburgh as the location was interesting, and the film captured the true character of lower socio-economic Pennslyvania and what can happen when one travels down the wrong path.  Overall, I give it 4 stars as it kept you engaged and thinking about who the players were and weather or not Reacher could take them down in the end.",1392076800,,740,4.765625

5504382,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Jack Reacher has more pluses than just that, but it's great to see a movie that let's the camera record, rather than create all the motion (it ain't action if it's just whippin' the camera around). When, for example, was the last time you saw a car chase where you actually know what happened? Opening of Quantum of Solace? not a clue. Armageddon? fugettaboudit (ok, those were extraterrestrial exploration vehicles, but geeezzus). I give this thing 4 half-thumbs up! (Get it? No? Well then u gotta watch the movie.)",1391990400,,516,4.808988764044944

5504385,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Tom Cruise did a good acting job but the acting job for others in the movie was so so. It was nice to watch a movie with my daughter and not have to watch sex scenes. Overall it kept our interest and I'd have to say it was a good movie.,1391990400,,236,3.6470588235294117

5504389,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Good yarn but the books are better. Cruise did a good job but does not fit the Jack Reacher profile - not a miscasting as a missed chance at great casting!,1391990400,,155,4.032258064516129

5504391,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I'd not seen this until February, 2014, as I figured it was just another Mission Impossible type film. I was wrong. When an Army vet is accused of shooting six random people, his only request is to 'contact Jack Reacherl'. Jack Reacher (Mr. Cruise's character) is a retired homicide investigator for the Army. He's been drifting and living off the grid. When word reaches him that he's needed by the accused he joins forces with the accused defense attorney to investigate the murders. This is a very well written screenplay, Mr. Cruise gives a great performance as does the support cast, especially Werner Herzog as ""The Zec"", Joesph  Sikora as Barr, Alexia Fast as ""Sandy"" and Rosamund Pike as Helen (the defense attorney). And of course, Robert Duvall as ""Cash"" gives his usual impeccable support. If you're looking for an intelligent, well acted action adventure, here's you film.",1391990400,,884,4.972972972972973
5504392,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"Boring character.  Unreadable author.  Unlikeable actor.  Cruise has displayed the ability to share and draw his audience into to his empathy for the character, however he has not done that in quite a while.  His performance is reminisent of John Wayne...Tom Cruise playing Tom Cruise.  Except, we know He CAN act, when he chooses to do so.  Evidently he chose not to in this project.

5504396,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Sometimes the good guys have to act bad to be good, and this is a great example of that concept. When you are up against tough odds it is important to recognize when to play the game with the same fight that the bad guys bring. Jack Reacher plays by his rules which are the kind of rules we need to keep the bad guys from keeping control of our fears. Ultimately this movie is about standing up for what you believe in regardless of what the law says. We as a society must also learn this to be able to reign in the ""leaders"" of our world if we want to reach our freedom.

5504423,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"I bet this is what Tom watches when he ""Jacks"" himself. I'm sure that involves a naughty Reacher Round. But all sick jokes aside, this is the biggest self-aggrandizing fluff piece of his career. And he has made a career in that self-indulging cliche'd genre.

I am sorry I made the mistake of watching this film and will make it my life's mission to warn others to avoid suffering a similar fate.

There are some things you just can't un-see, and the image of old pasty Tom with his saggy, misshapen man flab - sucked in as hard as he can without blowing out a hemorrhoid - and his freaky plastic surgery mishap of a face, trying to be ""sexy"" are the top of that list.

This is why they take your money BEFORE you watch a film. Funny how that is, yet you pay AFTER your meal at a restaurant? Yet if you vomit from your meal at a restaurant, they don't typically make you pay for it. That is an analogy for this film, if you reach for it... If not, I'll spell it out for you, if you vomit from watching this film, you will not get a refund. That is not cool. So invest your money in a nice dinner instead.

I should say something nice to off-set this brutal tongue lashing... Ok, Robert Duvall did alright, he's such a great actor in such a bad film. The photography was well done. The sound was done well. The score was cheesy, over-the-top and contrived. Oh wait, that's bad. Nevermind.

I'm sure some people will just love this, some simply to defy me because I am such an arse, others because they get off on this low-grade merde and haven't actually seen much better in their sheltered Americana life. If you like unfathomably impossible feats of strength, that are so ridiculous and unbelievable you spew milk duds across the theater laughing, this is your piece de jour. There are all kinds out there. I have seen a dog eat his own vomit. I have heard of a man that can suck his own  .... I can believe there are people out there that will like most anything.

The fact that this movie was on the free list made me think this was an under performer.  The movie delivers, and the supporting roll Robert Duvall plays in the last half of the movie adds a lot.

This movie was a fun filled romp.  I read the first Lee Child book and while Lee Child's Jack is not, physically, the same Jack in the movie the character himself is the same.  Tom Cruise did a great job and hi fight scenes were well done.  There was not much to not like about the movie.  Go in knowing you are watching something similar to Double Jeopardy, Sleeping with the Enemy, Enough, or the Fugitive and you will enjoy the movie.

I am not a reader of the series, so it wasn't bothersome that the physical dimensions of Mr. Cruise didn't measure up to expectations. There is plenty of action, and few do that better than Tom Cruise, so for me the movie works. The plot is somewhat contrived, but generally not so much that it is glaring. So, good action film, fun, slight amount of mystery solving. Predictable, but still not TOO predictable. All in all, a fun couple of hours. Recommended.",1391904000,,610,4.605504587155964

5504447,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Usually I don't bother to post a review if even as few as, say, fifty beat me to it because there's a good chance someone else says what I was going to say.  As I write this, 3,720 have already reviewed the 2012 Tom Cruise action/adventure film JACK REACHER.

What the heck.  But I will keep it brief, more notes than a coherent summary.

While there is much to admire about JACK REACHER, Tom Cruise's performance stands front and center.  Not that someone else playing the role would do such a bad job that he'd drag it down, but Cruise's take on the title character projects wisdom where other actors might have thought it appropriate to come across as arrogant. See JACK REACHER and maybe you'll agree Cruise's way makes it that much more affecting.  Bravo,Tom.

JACK REACHER is the first Tom Cruise film I'd seen since THE LAST SAMURAI, which he made nine years earlier, except for his scene-stealing cameo in the 2008 comedy TROPIC THUNDER.

With all his success, now Cruise can ride the Reacher role for a couple of good sequels.  All those hit movies, then the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE series, and now this.  Tom Cruise has his next divorce or two paid in advance.

While I certainly admired his acting in a number of roles going all the way back to the crazy cadet he played in the 1981 film TAPS,  Cruise's JACK REACHER performance is so good I plan to view the film again.  Reading through his credits, that has not happened before even though I liked TAPS, RISKY BUSINESS, RAIN MAN, MINORITY REPORT, and so many others.

How cool that there is a good role for Robert Duvall in JACK REACHER.  This makes up for DAYS OF THUNDER, starring Cruise with Duvall supporting.  I hated that one.

With JACK REACHER, Tom Cruise seems to have shed the last of his boyishness.  The best may be yet to come.",1391817600,,1798,4.513931888544891
5504448,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I was unexpectedly surprised by this movie. I don't know a single person who saw this when it was in the theaters. It was actually very entertaining. Tom Cruise is good at his job of being a bada55, smart, and dramatic action star. The plot surprised me. It was smart and didn't take all the usual twists. Plus, the ending was very satisfying.

The movie had a narrative and feel like CSI and Law & Order. The main villain was portrayed and described by the characters in the movie as ruthless and able to do the impossible in order to survive, yet in the end he doesn't leave or hold on to a gun when Tom Cruize comes for him. That happens at the end of the movie, but it totally deflates the experience. The action is slightly outdated.

I wonder who could play to the book's basic premise better?  You need a 6'5"" hulking nomad with an impressive intellect, high pain threshold and an existential shading about morality and justice that leaves you wondering what he is going to do next. I like Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible movies but his style of lone-wolf avenger is on a different end of the spectrum from what I imagine. Just putting a plaid shirt on Ethan Hunt doesn't really do justice to the archetypal force conjured up by Childs in his unique series.

5504493,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I'm not and have never been a huge fan of Tom Cruise. There's no particular reason, we just like one actor better than another sometimes. He has some great movies out there and some flops. I thought the plot sounded interesting and was debating on whether to rent this or not. I'm not actually someone who has read the books; my Grandma loves them though and has told me quite a bit about them. And after seeing this movie I think I'll start reading them.

This isn't a movie that puts on a lot of frills. It just is. I like it more for that. It has a great deal of character focus with some really well choreographed fight scenes (I am a sucker for those. I want to see some great action in an action movie). There is just enough bits put in there to actually make you feel like you know Jack a little, even if you haven't read the books. The supporting cast is great (have always loved Robert Duvall and his character in this movie is just a great deal of fun to watch) and it does enough to keep you guessing as to who is really the one at fault here.

It's not the best movie I had ever seen, but I have to say I was entertained and pleasantly surprised by Tom  Cruise's turnout. I see a lot about how his stature and looks do not fit those of the character, but having seen the movie and only known Jack Reacher's physical structure afterward, I can honestly say I'm not at all put off by who they cast. His performance makes for a nice watch and truly sucked me in for the duration of the movie. I look for that sort of thing when I am watching. If I am too aware of my surroundings and not the movie, it just didn't do it for me.

I'd recommend this to anyone who liked action films, who liked or didn't like Tom Cruise, or who enjoys these books. Just enjoy the movie. Don't bring in any expectations and you will enjoy yourself. I can honestly say there isn't anything about this movie I didn't like.

One premise is Reacher is above the law and basically executes people here and there.  Perhaps there are some viewers who like to see a world where events fulfill their Law of the Jungle ideas for proper social order.

Cruise has made so many excellent movies.  My God, he made this one for some quick cash and the hell with his reputation.  Cruise in real life seems to act like he is also one of the chosen ones.  Perhaps that is why his nice wife finally divorced him and took the kids.

Cruise is so much better than this movie and he made it himself without using writers and directors and producers who have made Cruise's reputation so high.  If your a gun carrying super red neck this is your movie.",1391731200,,905,4.209302325581396

5504503,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"This movie grips you from the beginning and holds you in a vice for the rest of the time. A must for any action flick junkie, and a top contender for suspense and thriller. An amazing plot and dialogue as well.",1391731200,,210,4.146341463414634
5504504,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"Cruise mailed it in, no depth to his character, just mindlessly recited his lines.  Pike, though very pretty, was much the same going from dull and lifeless to sudden dead-eyed shock.  It was tough to get invested in the film, the plot twists didn't have you reeling like they could have and another predicatable outcome.  Definitely not one that I would recommend.",1391731200,,365,4.854838709677419
5504505,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"The Lee Childs books are stellar, the movie a disappointment of a great character.  Too violent for my tastes, much of it unnecessary.",1391731200,,134,4.826086956521739
5504506,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Flawed but surprisingly enjoyable.  Have watched 3 times.  Lots of subtleties, along with the not at all subtleties.  Dialog at times is fantastic - harkening back to movies of old.  Tom Cruise is aging.  Cast selection is unexpected.  The lead female's lack of variety of expression was a perfect match for Tom's (lack of variety of expression).  Good watch.  Adequate action.  Good car chase.  Some amazing moments in this film, tied together by some cliche and some originality.  Definitely recommend.  Someone still needs to tell Tom that it's ok to have a sex scene in a movie.  Sexual tension is a TV series is fine, but in a movie not so much.",1391731200,,650,4.696428571428571

5504510,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Very good movie with interesting plot. The acting was very good and Tom Cruise was a good Reacher. I recommend.,1391644800,,111,4.6
5504511,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Watched using Prime, decent film with couple of twists. A low budget film from Tom Cruise perspective. Definitely watchable one time.",1391644800,,133,5.380952380952381
5504512,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"This was largely loyal to Lee Child's storyline, with one key variation.  Reacher was not his normal size; rather, he was played by diminutive tom Cruise.  However, Tom pulls it off in a very convincing and entertaining manner.  He's clearly not Reacher, but he did a good job.",1391644800,,277,4.729166666666667
5504513,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"There were a few of the typical cheesy cop/rebel/enemy lines in it and slight gratuitous cleavage, but overall it turned out to be a really good movie!  (I'm not a Tom Cruise fan all that much.  I know he's done good movies and he's done bad movies, all the while pretty much playing the same character.  But this movie was one of the good ones.)",1391644800,,346,4.292307692307692
5504514,5,B00AS1Q8FW,Cruise does a great job as always. Sweet chase scene with the Chevelle SS and it's one that I will and have watched multiple times.,1391644800,,131,4.28
5504515,5,B00AS1Q8FW,this is an awesome action movie and anyone who likes misteries and action will definitely love this movie.  Tom Cruise consistently delivers for this character.,1391644800,,160,5.4
5504516,4,B00AS1Q8FW,This is a comic book serial character starring Tom Cruise as the main character. It was predictable enjoyable popcorn fun with good actors.,1391644800,,139,5.086956521739131

5504524,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"In this Movie unfortunately Tom Cruise does not convince that he is as mean a bone-crusher protagonist as is Jack Reacher in the book by Lee Childs.

Not only is Tom Cruise not a giant but  because we cannot hear him thinking like in the book we are missing a very important part of the action.  Namely in the Novel we are inside Reacher's head and know ahead of time what is going to happen and why.

The movie just shows what happens.  :(",1391644800,,440,4.190476190476191

5504532,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"To make a long story short, this movie is fun, entertaining and worth viewing.  I didn't watch this for a long time because of reviews I had seen on sites like Rotten Tomatoes, or just speaking with friends that had read the books.  So the other night I couldn't find anything new to watch on Prime, so I thought I'd give it a try and am very happy I did.

The story line was not what I expected and this is entirely in a good way.  The action is well done, the story does a great job a letting the story unfold without giving too much away and Tom Cruise crushes it as Jack Reacher.  Now I am not comparing this in anyway to the book, as I have not read it.  That being said, I like what Tom Cruise did with this character as it is actually a departure from his Mission Impossible persona.

At any rate, I would recommend you give this a watch when you get the chance, you just may be surprised.",1391644800,,896,4.056818181818182

5504535,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Okay, put aside the fact that Tom Cruise in no way resembles Jack Reacher as described by Lee Child's in his novels. This is still a good action movie.  Even my wife liked it and that is rare for this genre.",1391644800,,207,4.048780487804878

5504537,3,B00AS1Q8FW,It was Ok. Just kind of a so-so film. The story line was predictable and the action was reasonable. Not over-the-edge like the Mission Impossible movies.,1391644800,,153,4.923076923076923

5504552,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Interesting movie, entertaining but a little predictable.  I appreciate that the lead male / female did not have to get into bed together . I did enjoy the classic cars in many of the scenes.  Robert Duval is great in anything he does.",1391558400,,235,4.441860465116279

5504554,3,B00AS1Q8FW,kind of silly and not very entertaining. Tom Cruise has more to offer in other movies so we were disapointed with the acting to say the least,1391558400,,141,4.2592592592592595

5504560,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"I can think of a few great words to describe this film
SAD, PATHETIC and LAUGHABLE!
Little Tommy got to play the big guy because he OWNS THE STUDIO.  Any true Reacher fan like myself had a laughfest at Tommy trying to be intimidating.  Really please Penelope Cruz is scarrier.  I hope Tommy's studio does a remake of Peter Pan, its the roll little Tommy is made for.
Anyone notice all of Tom's latest attempts at the box office have TANKED, just like this one TANKED.
This film stank stank stank.
Zero stars, because it won't let me i have put a 1",1391558400,,547,4.29126213592233

5504569,4,B00AS1Q8FW,It felt more like a movie I would catch on TV.  I would've been disappointed if I had gone to the theatre or bought the movie.  It seemed short and it didn't develop the plot very well.  I never really understood the reason for the crimes in the first place.  It expressed why the criminal was ruthless but it was only mentioned why he would do this in the first place.  It would have been nice to have uncovered the initial crime(s).,1391558400,,434,4.2439024390243905

5504578,3,B00AS1Q8FW,I enjoyed the story line reasonable considering the character in the books. Tom Cruise was the wrong lead. The character required a larger man.  Overall was worth the time.,1391558400,,172,4.931034482758621
5504579,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Another computer generated script. Cruise and Pike are superb in their roles. Action scenes are too long and do not adhere to the laws of physics or common sense. Cruise 5' 4"" is as tall as everyone in the movie and is capable of taking a full swing of a baseball bat to the head and shrug it off. The old man that has trouble finding his glasses and cannot drive at night because headlights bother his eyes becomes a crack sniper. The plot is fine just formulated to attract the most audience. Pike is past her prime but is still one super hot ""soccer mom"". If you have nothing to do it is worth watching. I would not pay to see it; even at RedBox.",1391558400,,649,4.158730158730159

5504582,3,B00AS1Q8FW,I gave this movie a 3 star rating only because there isn't a two and a half rating.  If you are a Tom Cruise fan then you might enjoy the ridiculousness of Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher.  If you are a fan of the books I would say again that if you like Cruise you might enjoy the film.,1391558400,,282,3.76271186440678

This is one of the worse movies ever done by Tom Cruise who I respect as an actor.  The script seems to be this: ""Short guy solves crime and kills people"".  That's it.

I watched the whole thing to be honest hoping that the actors would pull it out, but they didn't.  There was no way that it would happen.

Sorry Tom, but really don't include this in your CV.  Love your other movies, but this one had potential, but the script failed.  Big time.

Jack Reacher goes against the grain like a nail against a steel file all in the name of what is right.  Tom Cruise does an amazing job of falling into this character and making him a likeable funny guy with a side you might not ever see.  The kind of guy you might have coffee next to every morning and never know that he is capable of things you've only dreamed of doing.  I gave this film 5 stars because of the characters, the content and the emotions.  The muscle cars and Robert Duvall were an added plus.",1391472000,,609,4.2155172413793105

But that is ok, it is time for you to go get a Lee Child ""Jack Reacher"" novel and begin to get totally hooked on the character.  Tom Cruise does a really good job creating the character in the movie and the mystery of his background is enough to make you squirm hoping to learn more.  I recommend this movie as an action thriller that leaves you wanting to know more.  Lets hope the studio does it again with another of Child's novels.",1391472000,,597,4.156521739130435

Tom Cruise may be capable of action, but his physical presence is far from that of Child's main character.

Jack Reacher was discovered at one of those very rare moments on Amazon Prime when It was free and I couldn't find anything on NetFlix, which is rare.  Anyway, I thought I'd watch a few minutes of ole Tom Cruise being studly on ""Jack Reacher""  Boy to my surprise, I liked this movie, a lot.  The Action sequences were all just great and the bad guys, and their were a lot of them, were all real baddies. No love scenes, since I don't thing old Tom can pull off that sort of thing, anyway.  But Tom is good at killing out and dealing justice to those who are above the law.  This was just two hours of fun and popcorn.  Last I looked it was on Amazon Prime which has got to be a great deal if you buy a lot off stuff on Amazon anyway.  I've had it for a year and that was the second or third movie, so selection there is weak if you want them free. My time is up, Enjoy ""Jack Reacher"" and try Amazon Prime.

5504673,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I'm an avid reader and a fan of Lee Child's Jack Reacher character. I was afraid the movie version of One Shot would distort the Reacher character badly, but except for the extended car chase scene, it was pretty much true to form.  Kudos to the director and screen writers for that.  And Tom Cruise did a surprisingly good job of the Reacher character, though his diminutive size makes it a bit hard to swallow, especially when he takes on multiple bad guys in unarmed combat. Reacher's physical size and presence is a significant piece of the characterization, but I guess the producers wanted Cruise's box office appeal even though he is a poor physical fit for the character.

While this is primarily a ""guy movie"", my wife enjoyed it as well. I think anybody who likes action movies or cop mysteries will also like it.",1391385600,,823,4.623287671232877

5504697,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"It may just be that I don't like Tom Cruise as a solo act/focus of a film. I really enjoyed his performance in the last MI movie because he was linked and had full interactions with the team (ensemble of actors). There is something in his portrayal of Jack Reacher though, that made me feel that the character was smug and dismissive, rather than a man who is hyperaware of his danger to those around him and who has made the difficult choice of a monastic life, to minimize his ""dangerous effect"" on events. It is a subtle balance to portray, (a controllable monster). Unfortunately, while Tom copied some of the physical mannerism of these complex emotions, he just wasn't for me, able to make me believe. However, it was for me, an enjoyable break, and so I do recommend it, just don't expect more than a basic decent job of acting.",1391299200,,835,4.5

With only one exception, the story hung together very well.  Werner Herzog was wonderful.  Cruise is convincing.  And Robert Duvall is always great.

Plot-wise, it was hard to figure out exactly who was double-dealing right up to the end.  Good suspense.  Good acting.  Good action.  And I really enjoyed Reacher's analytical skills.  Modern Sherlock Holmes but Child puts the clues out front where you can see them.",1391299200,,561,4.739583333333333

Having read the Reacher series over the last 5 or 6 years I was looking forward to the movie. Until they announced that Tom Cruise was going to play Reacher. Anyone that had read more than two of Lee Child's Reacher novels was probably thinking the same thing I was. ""How the hell is Tom Cruise going pull off playing Jack Reacher?"" Then I realized that the majority of people going to see this movie have no idea who Lee Child is and had probably never picked up a Jack Reacher book.

The movie itself wasn't THAT bad, but it doesn't follow the book very well(but how many do?) For me, Cruise didn't do a very good job of being Jack Reacher.

This was the first time I used the Amazon Prime streaming video and the movie was free. Had I had to pay for it, I wouldn't have been very happy.",1391299200,,851,4.267080745341615

Read the books and was excited for the movie coming out, then I saw the movie.  Great disappointment.  A great book about a damaged man who wanted nothing more than to have the world leave him alone, but gets dragged back into the land of the living when he can't walk away from a terrible injustice was transformed into a mindless action movie that is run of the mill, slam, bang, pow flick that is undistinguished and a piece of brain numbing scenes run together with a, thank goodness, the END coming in I had been transformed from a 90 minutes!

If there was more action and less dialogue, that'd be okay, but there's enough dialogue that waiting through it for the action is painful.

There are a lot of action films in this world.  Most of them are better than this.  Go see Crank, or watch Tom Cruise in Knight & Day a third or fourth time before watching this.  A similar level of dialogue gets you Val Kilmer in Spartan, I think.",1391299200,,555,4.288461538461538

believable tough guy and Dirty Harry would eat him for lunch before he finished his hot dog.

Someone about 20 yrs younger and a lot bigger might have been more believable than puny

Cruise.

The fast paced script seemed to be read off of cue cards will little conviction or emotion.

It was sad to see Robert Duvall did not pass on this acting opportunity, but i guess the

 money was good and he is probably desperate. Wow from the Godfather to this garbage?

There are 2 very pretty girls in this movie but that was not enough to hold my attention.

It's just tons of meaningless violence from Hollywood who claim they are against gun

violence. A mother with a baby gets shot. I guess this crap won't end because Hollywood can

not write a original script. I WOULD Pass on this garbage if I were you.",1391299200,,897,4.279761904761905

If you have never read the Jack Reacher series you know that Tom is about half the size of the Jack character. It shouldn't matter to you because Tom does a very good job of acting and makes the action come alive. I am referring to the fact the the character of Jack in the books, is not Tom Cruise, i.e., Jack is 6 foot 6 inches. He weights between 280 and 300 pounds.

Then, I realized that it was a modern day version of one of the classic western plots-town in turmoil, Mysterious Stranger rides into town(on a bus), finds out what is happening, fights, gunfights, car chases(the modern version of the chase on horseback) occur, climactic violence, then the Stranger  pats the girl on the head, kisses the horse and rides out of town. Granted the stranger didn't actually kiss any of the cars he rode around in, and didn't pat the girl on the head, but it is still the same formula(""Come back, Shane"").

However, the movie was gripping, the actors did a great job, and the plot didn't give you time to lose your suspension of disbelief.

5504748,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Tom Cruise truly delivers as the action hero in this movie.  I know it did not do all that well at the box office but I really enjoyed it.  The story and the way Reacher is portrayed is really cool - if you like action hero's that are bad-ass and humorous at the same time, this is a movie for you!  People tend to ""dump"" on Cruise but I believe he will go down as one of our generations best actors, especially as an action figure actor!  The girl, Sandy, does a good job, and a couple of other characters are excellent, including Robert Duvall, though I wish he had a bigger part.  The parts he is in were terrific, though it looks like they edited out some of his parts, as it does not flow perfectly with his character, at least in my opinion.  Overall I would highly recommend this movie!",1391212800,,793,4.184210526315789

5504768,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"When I saw the ads, I couldn't believe that Tom Cruise had been chosen to portray Jack Reacher. Reacher is somewhere around 6'2, and Tom Cruise is a midget
Reacher is ruggedly good-looking. Tom Cruise is, well, Tom Cruise.  Sorry - I have never been able to see Tom Cruise as a sex object, but I definitely might follow Jack Reacher down the road a piece.

Tonight, I saw that the Jack Reacher movie was on Netflix, so I decided to see how bad it was.  Actually, if you have never read a Jack Reacher novel, it is probably fairly decent.  I figured I could watch it while I was doing email, but found I had to pay more attention. I didn't like that way the original story had b, ueen changed around, but, then, again, if you have never read the books, you wouldn't be bothered. I was first bothered with Jack Reacher wearing a leather jacket. He wouldn't do that, unless he had found the jacket by the side of the road.

As an action movie, I guess it was okay, only that it didn't really build up logically. Just all of a sudden all of the magical things happened that made the good guy win.
I found the movie just about as disappointing as I had expected it to be.

Who should have been Jack Reacher?
If Arnold Schwarzzeneger were 40 years younger and spoke native English, my vote would go there.
Steven Segal

Oh, gosh. most of the current action heroes are midgets. It is hard to decide. Jack Reacher is tall, and muscled, like the young Arnold Schwarzenneger.  Hollywood hasn't produced any heroes like that lately. Tom Cruise with his shirt off just looked like a scrawny guy with some ab make-up.",1391126400,,1604,4.377104377104377

Turns out the story line was interesting in spite of the cliche that there's only one man who can save the universe, single-handedly, amid awesome explosions and unending gunfire -- without so much as a paper cut. In one scene, a bad guy sneaks up on the unsuspecting Jack Reacher and strikes him on the upper back and head with what looks like a baseball bat. Reacher is temporarily dazed but rallied in time to save the day. I grudgingly admit the acting was great; the storyline contained interesting twists, and the romantic understory was subtle and without gratuitous sex scenes.

Cut to the chase and I believe this movie attests to his acting skills by using good one liners followed by a few quick action punches moving on to his next point of action with grim determinacy.

I really loved this movie and his role as Jack Reacher is a breath of cleaner air over MI sequels. I hope more of Jack is coming as the screen writers have taken on what I see is a short acronym we used in combat for our squads ""SMEAC"" Select a vantage point (Surprise visit), Make a Reconnaissance (Overt is better so the BG's get close and curious), Evaluate the Recon (count bodies, chase crawling BG's and take all ID from pockets), Action ( too late with the previous evaluation but continues to the next scene quickly for a final Command (On my Command let's kick some more commando style Ass!

I did enjoy the movie. One con I had was that the single segment of random killings told me there was a diversion going on to conceal the reason for the bloodbath. I was quick to pick out the real target (widow hint) but the trail leading to the END was convoluted enough to hide the BG's use of the dead parties connection.

There were a few things added, deleted or changed, but it didn't take away from the story and it fit the character of Reacher. We were also pleasantly surprised that there was very little foul language and no gratuitous sex scenes.  If that is what you look for in a movie, look elsewhere. Since Reacher in the book is 6' 5"" and in his late 30's, I was skeptical about seeing him portrayed by an actor that is 5' 7"" and 50.  But I thought Cruise played him well.

an enjoyable experience.
If you love Reacher as written in the books, the movie is an abomination.
From the physical size difference to the distortion of the quirks that make Reacher so fascinating in the books, the
movie is off and it is primarily because of Tom Cruise.
Cruise is fine if you don't have any prior notion of the character he is playing.
In this case, watching the tiny Cruise make Reacher moves is almost laughable.
What a terrible choice for this franchise.",1391040000,,593,4.6571428571428575

If it gave us a bit more back-story and resolved a bunch of open questions about such things as motivations, we might have given it 5. It was well-acted and directed, and we enjoyed it a great deal. It kept us so engrossed that only after watching it did we realize how many questions we had. So, overall, it was great entertainment.",1391040000,,423,4.367088607594937

5504845,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I am a huge fan of the Jack Reacher series and for the other fans of the series I imagine you were shocked to see Tom Cruise selected to play the role of Reacher. The Reacher character that Lee Child's creates in the fabulous series of books is 6' 5"" feet tall and weighs up to 250 pounds. That is a huge stretch for Tom Cruise; you just can't make up for that even on the big screen.

5504861,4,B00AS1Q8FW,I was not expecting too much from this movie based on the latest Tom Cruise flicks but I was pleasantly surprised. The film was filled with great laughs and quality action. There was a plot and story line that could be followed and had a few twists that are explained throughout the film. And Tom Cruise was great.,1390953600,,314,4.431034482758621
5504862,5,B00AS1Q8FW,I've been a huge fan of Tom Cruise for a very long time.  In my humble opinion the actors are those who can put a movie on their backs and carry it to the finish line.  It is reprehensible that this great has not won anything yet.,1390953600,,230,3.872340425531915
5504863,3,B00AS1Q8FW,This was an average to good action/thriller.  Not nearly enough twists to be great.  Tom Cruise is a good choice at parts like this.,1390953600,,132,4.458333333333333

5504870,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"This movie is ok.  It's weak compared to the actual story.  Jack Reacher is supposed to be 6'5"" tall and 250lbs.  Tom Cruise is 5'7"" and maybe 145lbs.  He's also to clean cut for the character.  Jack Reacher is rough looking.  He wears the same clothes until they fall apart or are not suitable to the weather, then buys a new set until they fall apart.  Tom just looks too 'clean'.  Also, the fight scenes are kind of hilarious.  It's like watching a hobbit try to be a bad ass.  It just doesn't work.  Thomas Jane would have been a much better pick for this role.  However, I thought Rosamund Pike did a great job as Helen.  And the movie was shot well.  Just didn't like Tom Cruise.",1390953600,,685,4.25

I have to admit that Mr. Cruise did a good job even though he's not 6' 5"" nor is he 250lbs. Lee Child painted such a vivid picture of his character that there aren't many actors that physically match up ... perhaps an older Chris Helmsworth or a younger Howie Long ...

Anyway, as to the treatment of One Shot, the gist of the book can be found in the script but the antagonists in the film were weak and the details that make Jack Reacher such an interesting character were given short shrift. Thus, my 3 of 5 rating ... Good, but could have been so much better ... Die Trying would make a great movie ...",1390953600,,829,4.18125

Cruise as Reacher was a laughable choice of actors, and what is supposed to pass for gritty film noir is simply filming at night.

As a long time fan of Lee Child's Reacher series, I wasn't sure what to expect, but since Child himself gave a blessing to this flick (and even has a cameo in it), I figured it was worth a shot.

The movie starts with five people being killed by a sniper, and a somewhat obvious suspect being arrested. The suspect remains silent, but writes a note for the cops that says ""Get Jack Reacher"". He and Reacher have issues dating back to their Army days, and initially Reacher wants nothing to do with the case. But the smart and pretty blonde defense lawyer convinces him to at least look at the evidence. No great surprise that the main suspect didn't do it, but it's a somewhat winding road to get to the real bad guys.

The action is pretty credible, there's a decent car chase involved, and the ending is pretty much what you might expect from Jack.

Overall not a waste of time.",1390953600,,999,4.275132275132275

Overall though I like this much better than the Newer movie with Jack Ryan that was a vast departure from the book.  This could have been better without little tom...,1390867200,,359,4.173913043478261
5504991,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Love it. Best Tom Cruise movie ever. I would recommend it to anyone who likes crime dramas. Must see TV,1390867200,,103,4.2
5504992,3,B00AS1Q8FW,would have been a fantastic film....but I could not buy Tom Cruise in lead roll.  There are numerous actors that would have been believable - but Cruise is just not one of them.,1390867200,,177,4.363636363636363
5504993,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"I am compelled to rate JACK REACHER a 1-Star movie, though I would deduct one star for its bladder-bursting length if allowed. Surprisingly and disappointingly adapted and directed by an otherwise very talented Christopher McQuarrie (THE USUAL SUSPECTS, WAY OF THE GUN), this laughably clich hack-fest is so continuously predictable you will long for the movies it so shamelessly cribs (see: FIRST BLOOD, A FEW GOOD MEN, any Legal thriller from 1983-1998). So bad it's just bad. ZERO STARS.",1390867200,,490,5.215189873417722
5504994,4,B00AS1Q8FW,I thought this was a  very good movie. Classic Tom Cruise action movie. I did not like the way it ended but I think that it is setting up for a sequel.,1390867200,,151,3.71875
5504995,4,B00AS1Q8FW,This was a good Thriller.  Again it moves fast and unable to hear what they say sometimes.  Otherwise I was surprised that I really enjoyed the movie,1390867200,,149,4.481481481481482

5505003,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I know the pain of having a book I love destroyed by the movie version...I have NOT read theReacher books and apparently that is a good thing because I found the movie to be an absolute blast.  It was (mostly) appropriate to watch with my 12 and 14 year old kids.  I am not a Tom Cruise fan, but this was a great movie for him - I can see why he wanted to play the character.",1390867200,,375,3.857142857142857

5505009,4,B00AS1Q8FW,I enjoyed the movie. Good action - some of it a bit of a stretch but all good. I have heard of the character and Cruise gives him a good representation,1390867200,,151,3.903225806451613
5505010,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"While it's true that Tom Cruise doesn't fit the image of JR in the minds of us Lee Childs fans, I'm glad it was brought to the screen and wish there could be more (such as with the Jesse Stone TV productions). And I like Tom Cruise.  He's just not big and tall enough to be the Jack Reacher in the novels.",1390867200,,305,3.9193548387096775
5505011,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Recommended if you like mystery, guns and the military. Jack Reacher is smart, fights like six men in one body and doesn't grope all the women he meets.",1390867200,,152,4.464285714285714
5505012,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Devoted fans complained that Cruise was to short to play the formidable giant, Jack Reacher. Take a look at this dude without his shirt. Pow! This is a well made and interesting ""thriller"", although our hero never makes mistakes and always beats 'em up, four or five at a time. There's nothing like being indomitable if you want to be a free-lance cop. Nevertheless I would call this a movie well worth seeing.",1390867200,,410,4.63013698630137
5505013,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Say what you want about Tom Cruise and any of his antics in the past, the guy is a good actor and that's the truth.  I'm no fanboy of his or anything like that but I do like a good action movie and Tom Cruise happens to be in this one.  So, some good points are:

-snappy and witty dialog
-impressive fight choreography
-car chases
-a strong thriller story with a touch of mystery and a lot of action included

Bad points:

-This isn't a knockoff but the ""one man army"" scenario has been done before(I still think this is a fresh take)
-Some of the actors weren't incredible but they were credible in their role
-the run time may feel a bit long for some(over 2 hours)

In general, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie.  It was a solid action movie all the way through with a good mystery story to be solved by the end(or is it).  I really enjoyed the way the dialog was written and the movie had that ""who is going to double cross"" vibe the whole way through.

Bottom line:
If you like action movies with depth, this is  your movie.  Even though it didn't do incredibly well in the theater it deserves a watch...critics don't know everything(me included).  It's worth your time and hopefully this will become a series.  I'd like to see what may happen if a part 2 were to...well...happen.

I don't enjoy being critical but this was the worst movies I have seen in a long time.  If you read the book, keep your positive memories of Jack Reacher.

A bit violent for younger viewers, even 13 seems a little young and the random sniper shots are a little chilling, in light of all the gun violence lately.

I liked the way he handled his role, that of a loner disappointed with society but who operates with a sense of honor. The movie is, of course, fairly brutal and there are a number of red herrings scattered around that add to the suspense.

It kept you guessing to the end who's the real culprit, and while the plot itself may be cliche and somewhat predictable, the actual details are not.

Typically, I like both Reacher books and Mr Cruise (and if you've read the books, yes Tom's size, hair color, etc. will bother you) but this movie is just plain BAD.

It's not the best I have seen Cruise do, but certainly not the worst, he doesn't write the script, he interprets the script. I think he caught the essence of Jack Reacher and they wrote in the things that make Reacher who he is. People who haven't read the books won't care and I didn't have a big problem with it.

If you want to watch a movie that isn't full of sex and don't mind a little action you many want to consider this one. It will keep you off the streets and the car chase is really cool too! Love the old man and the Pirates hat.",1390521600,,705,3.964788732394366

I actually would give this movie ZERO stars.  Yes, it was THAT awful.  I looked at my husband a couple minutes into it to check if it was just me...or was it as bad as it appeared to be.  Yes, that bad.  At different intervals throughout the film, I begged and pleaded for him to push STOP, but he insisted we finish as he was attempting to memorize bad quotable lines to use later.  Near the end of it all...I finally burst into hysterical laughing as to relieve how dumbfounded I was at JUST how bad this movie was.  It was sheer torture...I needed to release bad tension buildup.

What they SHOULD have done was filmed it in black and white, and promoted it as a comic film noir.  If that had been what they were going for, it would have been perfect.",1390521600,5,881,4.221556886227545

When I saw the run-time I figured I'd have to pause & resume later, but I don't think I left my chair the whole time. I agree with another reviewer who said that there's charm evenly distributed throughout. ""Is anyone dead?"" ""What if someone was?"" ""They died of shame; I was being gentle.""

There are no sex scenes here, only a pretty girl leaving Jack's room. There is no hook-up with the female lead, but several moments where he steps up to her...and nope. The tension is just right, and not hokey. I don't know the actress who plays Helen; she's very lovely, but imperfect, as is everyone else--I wonder if no one is allowed to be prettier than Tom...but it's refreshing to see girl-and-boy-next-door types.

5505153,5,B00AS1Q8FW,Enjoyed this flick. Good twist on good guy/bad guy rolls. Points out a potential torment that follows many of our troops in civilian life.,1390435200,,138,4.791666666666667
5505154,4,B00AS1Q8FW,One of Tom's better movies. The movie went along the like the book. I would watch it again. That it.,1390435200,,100,4.05

5505165,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"This is quite the mystery, drama, action, AND suspense thriller. No joke, Cruise is excellent in this movie.

5505169,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Good Movie but I agree that Cruise wasn't the right fit for the Reacher character.  Needed someone darker and more ominous.  Overall though the movie was great.,1390435200,,160,4.888888888888889
5505170,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"Jack Reacher is an interesting noir story of an ex MP turned drifter.  When another veteran is arrested for a mass murder, his oneresponce to the police is to write ""Get Jack Reacher"" on a note pad.  Unfortunately, the defendant is beat into a coma on the way to jail.  Jack misteriously shows up, which is a pretty cute bit of cinema fantasy.  The defence attorney, is of course, lovely, and of course her father is the DA, but I'll even buy all that.  The movie starts to fall apart when all of the cars Jack ""borrows"" from various baddies turn out to be classic American muscle cars from the '60s.  Uh oh...

Well after literally strong-arming a dozen or so goons, the B-girl (bar girl) that helped set him up fror a beating, is killed with one punch by one particularly villian. Jack, being a gentleman thinks about avenging her death.  In the meantime the beautiful attorney, who by the way hired him to find out the truth, gets kidnapped by the real killers.  Anyway, Jack, and a helper, ruch the quarry/bad guy hideout to save the day.  After defeating all the henchmen one by one, including a bad cop in a Dirty Harry style stand-off, he comes face to face with the real villian, a former Russian prisoner so tough, that Reacher understands his only hope at justice, is to kill him.

Overall, the movie is over the top in the wrong ways, and not over the top in the wrong ways.  But it's fun to watch if you are the kind of person that loves scenes in movies, more than entire movies.  Cruize is actully not as bad and actor as people like say.  It may seem trivial, but hey, I believed that he was really eating a meal in the diner scene.",1390435200,,1647,4.339869281045751

5505174,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"This movie should have been about 1 hour long.  The dialog is forced and awkward and there are a lot of things that just don't make any sense.  The overall story is somewhat interesting but the movie is so long and drawn out that I had to give up on it with 40 minutes to go.  There is a chase scene (crappy) that seems to go on for about 10 minutes and ends when Reacher steps out of the moving car walks into the crowd where some stranger hands him a hat that helps him blend in.  WTF?  Why would anyone do that?  This movie felt like it was made for Tom Cruise, by Tom Cruise so he can pretend to be a nearly all powerful, mysterious guy.  Almost laughable in a lot of places.",1390435200,3,679,3.9851851851851854

5505177,1,B00AS1Q8FW,I have read (14/15) of Lee Childs (all on Kindle).  Impression I have of Jack Reacher is a tall (6'5) 200+ man.  Cruise did not meet my expectation of the character.  Also the story line was not Child's best.,1390435200,,208,4.282051282051282

5505182,5,B00AS1Q8FW,The book was great and the movie does a very good job of portraying what I think the author intended to describe.  Not a story you would want to watch half now and half at a later time...turn off the phone and pay attention to the plot twists!  Perfect for a plane ride.  Tom Cruise plays the disinterested drifter in a way that is easy to cheer for.,1390435200,,350,4.117647058823529

5505184,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"What cant Tom Cruise do? he is not 6'6"" like the fictional Jack Reacher but his presence is defiantly not diminished by his short stature.  Good action movie with a believable story line that keeps you feeling engaged till the end.",1390435200,,231,4.634146341463414

5505186,4,B00AS1Q8FW,This movie reminded me a lot of the Bourne movies.  The ending was not as predictable as most movies in this genre.  I was very impressed with this movie.  Tom Cruises acting was excellent.,1390435200,,189,4.5

5505189,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Having read almost all the Jack Reacher series Tom Cruise was not who I envisioned to be him so I was eager to see the film with an open mind because I like both - the series and Tom Cruise but couldn't see the match - kind of like eating pizza with pineapple and Canadian bacon for the first time - sounds bad, tastes good.

The movie was reasonably true to the book although I wasn't crazy about the choice of Rosamund Pike who seemed uncomfortable in her role as the attorney.",1390435200,,479,4.206521739130435
5505190,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Very violent and the shirtless scenes with Tom Cruise with his ""breasts"" were embarrassingly unnecessary.  She's supposed to be hot for him. I get it!",1390435200,,150,5.0
5505191,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Passed over this movie many times b/c it's Tom Cruise and didn't want another shoot 'em up movie. Plenty of suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat. Well done.,1390348800,,165,4.1875

5505200,3,B00AS1Q8FW,It was an OK movie.  Nothing to really brag about.  Yes there was some good scenes but the movie felt like there could have been more to it than just watching Tom Cruise wall to scenes and just look.,1390348800,,199,4.076923076923077
5505201,3,B00AS1Q8FW,This was a typical Tom Cruise movie.  There was enough action to keep the movie chugging along but not as good as his MI series.,1390348800,,128,4.12
5505202,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Interesting throughout. Tom Cruise was great, as always.

Tom Cruise is an excellent actor & makes the role believable, except perhaps for his mysterious true identity & ability to disappear.  It does contain a lot of violence, but it's pretty much a part of the story & it wouldn't be the same if it was tame.  I liked the unfolding mystery of who's who, emergence of new interesting characters, & suspense throughout the story.  I wouldn't recommend it for younger viewers.",1390348800,,491,4.809523809523809

5505236,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"As a reader of the Jack Reacher books, I was pleasantly surprise at how closely the story was followed by the movie script.  I never would have pictured Tom Cruise as Reacher, but he handled the part well.

Just one character, the main villain, called The Zek, was given short shrift.  In the book a considerable amount of space was given to The Zek's backstory, so that the reader could understand his motivation.  The movie covered it all in just a very few minutes, which leaves a viewer not familiar with the story not really understanding the motives of the real bad guy in the story.

My wife, who is not a follower of the Reacher series nor a Tom Cruise fan, actually enjoyed the movie and thought it well done, too.",1390348800,,723,4.446969696969697

This movie gets a c+ I give it a B but again this type of movie been done to many times in past & the viewer can see the end coming in about 25 minutes.

5505242,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Having not read the books, this review will not include preconceptions that I am sure are valid, but didn't affect my enjoyment of the movie.

Jack Reacher is a focused, motivated man who, after a career of fighting for the lives and liberty of others, took a pause to see what he was fighting for. Becoming disenchanted with what he saw, he decided to step out of the picture, living day by day without a care for the world around him.

With one exception. He made a promise to a man who, in his eyes, escaped justice on a technicality. Jack promised to be there if and when this individual made a mistake and finish the job he started.",1390348800,,637,4.34453781512605

5505256,2,B00AS1Q8FW,The movie is dreadfully slow and takes a while to get going. That is assuming the audience can overlook the fact that Jack Reacher is supposed to be about twice as big as Tom Cruise is (there aren't enough shoe lifts in Hollywood to pull that off). Solid storyline but the movie didn't do it justice.,1390348800,,300,4.375

5505277,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"If you've been disappointed with recent Mission Impossible sequels, try this film.  The story has suspense and is not entirely predictable.  The Jack Reacher character is a departure from the Tom Cruise polished image and this character has admirable qualities.  Great extended-cameo performance by Robert Duvall during the second half of the film.  Even though its more of a guy film with a Chevy Chevelle SS as best supporting actor and quite a bit of violence, even my wife thought the film was pretty good (and she is not a Tom Cruise fan normally).  The story ends leaving it wide open for a sequel film.

If you are a Clint Eastwood fan, and you watch the movie, you will understand.  The part would have been perfect for a young Clint Eastwood.  And, Tom Cruise must have thought the same thing.  Because, it is as if he went to Clint Eastwood training camp.  He tries to use Clint Eastwood's facial expressions from how he eats, to how he reacts...everything except how Clint talks through his teeth.  I expected Tom Cruise to say ""you feeling lucky punk"" any minute.  Cruise was good in it, but would have been better not trying to copy Clint Eastwood, which just drew attention to the fact that this movie is better suited for someone else playing the part of Jack Reacher.

5505316,3,B00AS1Q8FW,As a reader of many of the Reacher books I must say the movie was better than expected.  Tom Cruise is not able to play the Reacher character of the books as written.  But if you haven't read the books then you may well like the not-quite-like Reacher character that he does manage to pull off here.,1390262400,,299,4.228070175438597

While a very good actor, you can't ""act"" size and he's just too small to be playing such a tough guy.  Must really be difficult to accept for those fans of the book.  Cruise playing a 6'5"" 230lb. veeran?  ha!",1390262400,,345,4.166666666666667

5505345,3,B00AS1Q8FW,Good performance by Tom Cruise.  Story and characters well developed with enough action to maintain interest.  A little suspense of disbelief is required to make the movie work.  Not bad at all.,1390262400,,194,5.0

5505347,5,B00AS1Q8FW,Tom did a nice acting job and Rosamund Pike was excellent. Robert Duvall gives a needed bit of humor as Gunny Cash to make this movie well worth watching,1390262400,,153,4.310344827586207

5505352,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"The Reacher story itself was not bad.  The Actor, however, could not carry the part.  Tom Cruise was absolutely the wrong actor for the part.  I will say there were times when he tried to act the part, it was he just couldn't do Reacher.  Cruise has one style and one style only, which is all flash.  It is what Cruise depends upon to carry him through a movie.  Reacher, the character, is not flash.  Anyone who has read the novels will understand that.  The character is a quiet man, with the patience to sit or lay for hours when needed, just waiting.  Flashy cars, racing about, the flirty grins just isn't the man readers of the novels know Reacher to be.

All in all the Actor was the disappointment.  People I've talked to all over the world agree that the movie was a disappointment in having Cruise play the part.  He most certain is not a Jack Reacher.",1390176000,,862,4.352201257861635

I must say I was quite impressed with his performance in this movie. The story line moved along fluidly; albeit entertaining the plot  seemed a bit lacking and predictable.  Having not read the book I can say my opinion is a unbiased one.  As one other reviewer pointed out though... ""Why is Jack Reacher the only one with brains? """,1390176000,,537,4.267326732673268

5505365,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I've seen just about everything Tom Cruise has acted in, and I honestly think the plot and sequence of events really fit him perfectly and he absolutely nailed this role.  I actually enjoyed watching this more than M.I. Given the fact that there is a lot about this movie that is way more realistic than most of this genre. i.e - driving into oncoming traffic and not hitting anything... yeah right. Well I guess they thought the same when filming that scene!  Anyway, hands down one of the best action/suspense films I have seen in quite some time.",1390176000,,549,4.591836734693878
5505366,4,B00AS1Q8FW,I thought the movie was entertaining.  I love the Jack Reacher books by Lee Child.  The only problem is the Tom Cruise is no Jack Reacher- 6ft 5in 260lbs. of bad ass muscle.  Pretty good story anyway.,1390176000,,200,4.351351351351352

5505369,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Being a fan of the Jack Reacher book series, I was disappointed in the choice of Tom Cruise to portray such a strong character, He does not fit the image at all. However, the story was okay, even though a bit unbelievable. Lee Child is an excellent author, but the movie fell short of his talent. (in my opinion)",1390176000,,312,4.305084745762712

5505371,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"I've read all the Reacher books, don't care for them all but most are entertaining, full of action and on-the-road mentality. When I first came across this character I thought RAMBO, not quite, but I can see many similarities. Ex-military tough guy roaming the country, eventually getting into lots of trouble. Reacher is on the side of the unprotected, innocent, where a wrong needs to be righted. The endings of some of the books are nothing more than blood baths that have been justified by crimes described in the first part of the book. I actually enjoy most of the books but I don't find them particularly well written. The book this movie came from (One Shot) is one of the better ones and one I've read a couple of times, once just before the movie came out.

Cruise does NOT nail it as someone elsewhere reviews, to be begin with Tom Cruise just does NOT HAVE THE PHYSICAL presence to carry off this role. To make up for his physical inaptness he acts with a swagger and a know-it-all countenance, but for me it's not convincing. The movie itself isn't bad, it does the book some justice (no pun) although there are many changes which often happens from book to movie. For me Tom Cruise is usually Tom Cruise and not the role he is trying to portray. I'm sorry that so many people who never heard of Jack Reacher until now think Tom Cruise is what that character is. Try one of the books and see for yourself. One of the things that is totally missed by the movie is the easy going conversations that take place often between the violence, the reasoning behind Reacher's demeanor.",1390176000,,1589,4.517361111111111
5505372,1,B00AS1Q8FW,The plot is unrealistic.  Tom Cruise  is a wooden actor. I wouldn't want to see it if I were on  DESERT island.,1390176000,,111,3.9545454545454546

5505375,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"I watched this knowing there was no way Cruise could play the character of Jack Reacher (I have read many of the Lee Child books including the one the movie is based on).  He did a decent job but the books are better.

They changed a lot of the flow of the book to make it work in a movie, but it takes away from the investigation.

Watch it if nothing else appeals or if you are a fan of Cruise (although watching The Last Samurai again might be a better use of your time).",1390176000,,474,3.968421052631579
5505376,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Recently watched this again through my Amazon Prime and was surprised how it got me again. Mostly I credit the soundtrack, which I actually purchased on MP3. Love it. How far out was it to cast Werner Herzog as the villain? And he nails it. Of course David Oyelowo nails his supporting role. He is SUCH a rising star. Those three things plus the nice fight choreography were more than enough to make this a half-favorite action movie. I think Cruise deserves kudos for putting such an exceptional piece together here the way he did, and now that the character has been introduced I look forward to the sequel. I'm sure there will be a lot more they can do now that they have introduced the Cruise-as-Reacher character. This first film was not quite as much fun as the books, but I have high hopes for the future and this could become established as a great franchise series.",1390176000,,874,4.537974683544304

5505378,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Good action. Fairly well acted with decent plot. Only reason for 4 stars is that Tom Cruise isn't really in line with the Jack Reecher in the book series. But, he did a decet job. Worth a rental.",1390176000,,195,4.157894736842105
5505379,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"If you need to burn some time off your life's clock, this is as good as anything. While the plot seems original, it fails on so many logical points that you end up watching not for entertainment but to see what the next plot hole might be. Trite characters also help drag it down.  A movie seldom can rise above the level of its script, no matter who is cast as the lead, who are the supporting actors or how the director paces the plot.

5505381,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Surprisingly smart and entertaining.  I had no clue what to expect from this movie as I did not know much about it before hand.  I sellected it because of Tom Cruise and was pleasantly surprised by the entertainment level.,1390176000,,222,4.666666666666667

Who knows, who has time to care? 3.5 Stars.",1390176000,,361,4.746031746031746

5505398,2,B00AS1Q8FW,Tom Cruise is no Jack Reacher.  I'm not sure Lee Child's book can be successful on the silver screen.  Keep reading the books and let your mind be your camera.  That's the best way to enjoy Jack Reacher!,1390176000,,203,4.2894736842105265
5505399,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"Actors can only perform well when provided with a decent story. This is a typical case in point. The story is more like one you would expect from a cheap paperback detective story than a sophisticated thriller with a decent plot. I like Rosamund Pike and, generally, Tom Cruise but the material is trivial and predictable. Gritty and reasonably well filmed with a decent attempt at realism, you cannot add what is not there.",1390176000,,424,4.743243243243243

5505408,3,B00AS1Q8FW,Love the Lee Childs Jack Reacher series of books. This movie was fun but Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher? Just doesn't work for us. Reacher is a humble and factual man who is 6-5 and 250 pounds. Cruise played the part as arrogant and talkative.,1390176000,,239,4.333333333333333

5505412,3,B00AS1Q8FW,This movie was okay. Not one of Cruise's  best acting selections. The plot of the set up could of worked if the actors put alittle more heart into it.,1390176000,,150,4.172413793103448

5505416,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I confess to not reading the two thousand plus reviews on this movie. I'm just going to add my two cents worth. I liked the movie. I respect Cruise as an actor, he's pulled off a lot of tough guy roles convincingly.  Yep, this one had its share of plot holes, but no more than the typical action movie. So, based on liking the movie, I bought the first three books in the series. Honestly, I liked the movie better.  Reacher's character in the books is, in my opinion, much less credible than Cruise is in the movie. I hope they make more movies of the Reacher series , and keep Cruise  in the lead role.",1390089600,,604,4.189655172413793

The production value is solid; good effects and good direction. Acting and story are decent, too. Unlike many movies, this one actually had me more engaged prior to the ending. I feel like it fizzled out toward the conclusion, and it got a tad cheesy with the final fight scene(s).

Overall, a decent movie for Cruise!",1390089600,,437,4.602564102564102

5505447,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"After reading all of Lee Child's Reacher Series novels, I found the casting of Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher hard to accept.

Reacher is a bigger than life character in every way; i.e. size, aloofness, strength, attitude, etc.  Tom Cruise, while a big draw for Hollywood, just didn't convince me he was Reacher.  The Director did a good job making Cruise look like a big guy with camera angles and surrounding cast member size.

I liked the movie otherwise since it followed the original book plot closely.  I would recommend watching it if you like action.  Reacher champions for what's right but employs anything to protect it, even breaking the rules to do so.",1390089600,,660,4.745614035087719

5505450,4,B00AS1Q8FW,It is a good movie with lots of action. I think it should not have been rated PG13 due to all of the violence. Some parts were a bit hokey but over all it held my attention.,1390089600,,173,3.7027027027027026
5505451,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I have enjoyed  the books, and the movie was enjoyable too. I have to give Tom Cruise credit -  he's a better actor than  I  thought to pull off such a convincing Jack Reacher, despite being an old out of shape midget compared to the much younger incredibly fit and giant Jack Reacher in the books. (Tom Cruise is what, 5' 7"" and 50+ now? Jack Reacher in the novels is 6'5"" and late 30's!)) The villains were great (i.e. really nasty), and filming locations made it credible.  I actually look forward to the planned sequel.",1390089600,,523,4.40625

5505455,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Jack Reacher was fun to watch.  It was not easy to see ahead and figure out where the director was taking us.  I thought it was worth the watch.,1390089600,,144,3.9310344827586206
5505456,4,B00AS1Q8FW,If you like TC you'll love this.  Jack Reacher was a character I fell in love with. The movie kept me interested til the end. A great watch!,1390089600,,140,4.0

But if you're even perusing the genre to which this movie belongs, you could certainly do worse than watch Jack Reacher.  There are some places where it seems to drag along, but they almost seemed welcome after the very many breathtaking scenes you'll encounter.  It's a great movie if you're looking for a good-guy vs. bad-guy action film.  Don't forget the popcorn.",1390089600,,427,4.72972972972973
5505459,4,B00AS1Q8FW,A good movie that followed the book fairly well except for the auto chase sequence. Guess I missed that in the book. Tom Cruise is not quite the right size for Reacher unless he's taller and heavier than he looks..,1390089600,,214,4.375
5505460,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Reacher delivers all that is expected of an action movie.  Car chase, shootings, drama, humor, and some suspense.  The plot is simple and not too original, but if you are looking for a simple action flick this one will do nicely.",1390089600,,229,4.560975609756097

5505473,4,B00AS1Q8FW,I enjoyed the plot staging and the reveals as the movie progressed. It seemed believable while being very entertaining. I give it four stars and not five because of the end sequences in the movie. These were a bit overdone and less believable. The character of Jack Reacher is strong and the supporting roles are also written well.

Cruze stayed true to reacher only jack is much taller and would destroy tom cruze in now or in holly woods basement in the hills. The dialogue was a fresh reprise from the post 911 films or the 911 films making money off our pain instead of telling the squatting talking heads trust passing on the house our fathers built to represent.. The people I think. That's what someone told me once apon a highschool.

BUT, it is an amazing movie.  It's extremely well done.  Extremely well executed.  Nearly every moment was worth watching.  I skipped the part where it looked like a guy was going to have to gnaw off his finger...but other than they they ""cut away"" at all the right moments so that the violence didn't become senseless or over the top.

It was fun where it needed to be with great moments that made me smile or outright laugh.  It was tense when it was clear anything could happen.  I didn't feel it was predictable either.

There is no part of this movie that is enjoyable. The dialogue is canned. The acting is stunted. The action sequences are terrible. The camera angles are bizarre. The ""twist"" isn't a twist. The musical score is flat. The fight scenes are boring. The plot has more holes in it than a block of Swiss cheese. The bad guy is unbelievable and uninspiring. The chemistry between characters is non existent. The pacing is missing. The buildup is clunky. The ending is cringe worthy.

5505495,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"First things first: I haven't read the books, though I intend to check them out now. But even if I had read them, I think it's a mistake to compare novels to films. They are wildly different mediums and in all but the rarest cases (I'm talking about you Three Days of the Condor) if you are a true fan of the novel(s) you will be disappointed in the film version(s).

I avoided this film because I'm not a Cruise fan at all. I think he's done some good work--the Mission Impossible series is at least enjoyable--but I largely see him as a self-created cliche, and to be fair, his personal life is a distraction. But I was impressed at the high ratings here, at IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes, so when it came up free on Prime I thought why not.

I have to quote IMDB reviewer Fluke_Skywalker: ""There was a timelet's call it ""The 80s""when action movies didn't need CGI cheats, shaky-cam and ADD-editing to entertain us. They also didn't have to destroy ten city blocks, have a ""clever"" hook or feel the need to tack on a social message to justify their carnage. No, all they needed was a reason for some good old steak and potatoes action and a star to anchor it all. 2012's Jack Reacher has these qualities in spades.""

That's it in a nutshell. Cruise isn't a superhero type here, he's mostly just a guy who has some special skills. The plot doesn't bend to stupidity or convenience, and the chase/fight scenes are not epics that reek of a producer with a big budget. In fact, the main chase scene is fantastic just for the use of a muscle car.

Is it a ""best of"" film? No. It's somewhat pedantic. The plot is one of the highlights and if that came from the novel then it's another reason to explore the novels. But Cruise, who served as producer, avoided his standard cliches of cute guy that gets all the women and superman who can save the world. If the movie lacks anything it's Reacher never hits the classic low point, something that all great stories in this genre do to their hero, nor does he make you particularly like him. Okay, and maybe I was hoping for a nice little twist that didn't come.

All in all, I hope another Reacher movie is forthcoming and that Cruise doesn't feel a need to take it up a notch. The tone is right here--please keep it that way.",1390003200,,2263,4.3530805687203795

Tom Cruise does an excellent job in this movie. There is some mild humor that is perfectly timed and witty, and the action scenes are excellently choreographed.

Reacher's physique is a big part of both character and plot, and they just couldn't overcome that here.

Cruise is effective in this role and channels the badassery of Reacher pretty well; despite all his epic action work, he works well as an anti-hero drifter.  The film's not overly complicated or pretentious, and it sticks to the book fairly well, if that's important to you.  It could have been forgettable, but the simplicity of the story and the pulpy suspense elicited throughout was very enjoyable, enough so that I looked for news of a sequel afterward (and was pleased to find one's in the works).

5505552,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise necessarily, nor do I dislike him. I've never read a Jack Reacher novel. I do like action movies, especially but not solely if they're not stupid or gratuitously violent. This movie was neither. The story and dialog are sensible and, in the right places, amusing as well. This movie surpassed my expectations which were limited from the start. I'd certainly recommend it as an action genre movie. Tom Cruise did a perfectly fine job acting the character. He enjoys playing arrogant characters and I'm sure this character didn't disappoint him. That's not to dissuade anyone from watching. Jack Reacher is arrogant in a likeable gentle way that is endearing. (in the movie anyway - I have no knowledge of the characterization in the books)
I just wonder, of the many reviewers that gave negative reviews of the movie here, what actor would they have chosen that fits the physical statistics of the Jack Reacher in the books? I can't think of any good actors that are 6'5"" and 250# and ""ruggedly handsome but scruffy"" as well. There are some tall actors but not many, if any, are 250#.

They needed some warmth and human feelings here. A little more humour.

The car chase was boring, and I could have done without the neanderthal male vs. male fighting. Yeah, lets just show WHO can beat up who the best! Isn't that just the most wonderful thing????? So ridiculous......

But if you are going to have car chases and fight scenes make them interesting, clever, or funny.

The general story was pretty good. Kept your interest.

Although the story sticks to Lee Childs writing...  mostly... It was difficult to see an actor the size of Mr Cruise portraying a character who is 6 feet 4 inches and with a tough edge.

5505602,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Let me say off the bat, this movie didn't seem workable.  The character of the hero, Jack Reacher, is something like 6' 4"", well over two hundred pounds, an ex-Major of Military Police and one tough mother.  The Jack Reacher series by Lee Child has him retired from the service, wandering around the US with one change of clothes and no permanent address.  He goes from town to town and manages to get into trouble (or help others in trouble.)  While he is actually a clever investigator, he survives much of his troubles by beating the total #### out of the bad guys -- often three or four at a time. Think Tom Cruise?  Me either, but by the end of the movie I bet you'll say Tom pulls it off.  The story line is an adaptation of one of the Jack Reacher series.  A character from Reacher' s MP days who is a marksman but loves the thrill of the kill too much; is arrested for what appears a random act of violence -- the shooting from a distance of a number of apparently unrelated individuals on the street in Chicago.  Jack is involved in the case by an attorney in a large firm who happens to be the daughter of the District Attorney. She has been assigned to serve as the ""killer's"" attorney, but just to work out a plea bargain. From there it is a well-plotted story line as we watch Jack/Tom begin to methodically work it out. The high point comes as the attorney is kidnapped and Jack Reacher walks into a sure trap with only one comrade.  Is this the greatest movie of all time?  Nope!  But, it is pretty good and will certainly hold you.  It is fast paced, good script and Tom Cruise pulls it off.  I thought it was quite good and will watch it again.",1389830400,,1661,4.251592356687898

It all came to a conclusion in front of the window in the DAs office at night as he tried to explain himself to his overly obvious sexual attractant.  It was all just too ""set up"" for me to buy.  His character had no flaw other than being stridently prudish and untouchable.  These are sometimes considered virtues in other situations/characters.  Here, they were just unbelievable.

Basically: I didn't buy into the story.  I was always watching an ""action flick"" and it never got me out of my present reality long enough to enjoy the normally escapist qualities of a good film.  If there was any humor as well, I missed that.",1389830400,,981,4.548571428571429
5505625,5,B00AS1Q8FW,Movie was OK but Tom Cruise didn't fit my mental picture of Reacher.  Not big enough and I pictured a more Jack Palance type character.,1389830400,,135,4.4
5505626,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"If you like Tom Cruise then you will like this. His acting in this is his usual tough guy role. I am not a movie critic, just know what I like. This is up there with the M.I. series and War of the Worlds as far as his character goes. Plenty of action, comedy and suspense for my liking and a great bit for one of my favorites Robert Duvall.

5505643,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"This action movie is different from most -- it is unapologetic about the force the protagonist uses.

Jack Reacher isn't exactly an anti-hero, but he is very aggressive and there are no Hollywood niceties like fistfights that look like they are being proctored by the Marquess of Queensbury.  Like fights in the real world, these fights are short and desperate and not a mini-morality play.  There are many action sequences and most of them are short, to-the-point and  brutal.  I found this refreshing -- the typical action movie re-uses so many tropes (hero being extra-fair, bad guys bragging and monologuing before the showdown, people who can run faster than bullets and explosions) and can be very tiresome.

Good film, and refreshing for its unapologetic outlook.",1389830400,,770,5.12

Psychological thriller in some areas as well. These kind of movies keep me guessing what the real plot is as i try to get to the real plot line before it is revealed. This time, I didn't do it. Cruise' character was done well, ok, I like Tom Cruise, he's one of the many ultra rich Hollywood stars who have their own spaceship, if ya know what I mean. Great actor, he shines in this role. Not afraid to off the bad guys, not afraid to ride right into the gunfights, not afraid to take on the big money man super crooks. Not even afraid to ride away into the sunset ( in this case a Greyhound out of town at night), and true to his character, the film ends when Reacher, while on the bus, hears some nut job abusing his girl friend and he....opps...dont want to give it away.

I liked the movie. Plot was unguessable, not cookie cutter, cast was great and as usual, Tommy Boy was in every shot, but thats ok. I recommend it. If you don't like it, you'll get over it.",1389830400,,1185,4.12987012987013

5505701,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Tom Cruise is a good action star and his movies are well paced and usually not too off beat. Jack Reacher is kind of a anti-social very intelligent person who ends up helping a person he believes got away with murder. Jack is more about the search for truth and justice and seems to have a hard time dealing with  the grey areas. Its more like real life as you try to know someone without all the facts and figures. I believe it makes a more enjoyable experience as you put your own idea of the characters instead of what the writer and director want you to feel by giving you to much information. Robert Duvall  is always good to see and wish he had a larger role in the movie. Enjoy!!!,1389830400,,687,4.196969696969697

5505705,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Did not disappoint. After viewing this I told my wife she had to also watch it. She reluctantly agreed then 15 minutes later cussed at me for letting her start it because she couldn't quit watching it despite having other things that needed to be done.,1389830400,,252,4.5

5505707,5,B00AS1Q8FW,I enjoy the Jack Reacher books but was disappointed that Tom Cruise was chosen to play his character. I was pleasantly surprised when I watched the movie. Tom did a great job and I thought the movie followed the book plot  pretty close. I enjoyed the movie and the cast. Very well done.,1389830400,,286,4.39622641509434
5505708,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Good suspence with action you would expect from a Tom Cruise film.  Not the best ever, buy definitely worth seeing.",1389830400,,115,4.75

5505714,3,B00AS1Q8FW,wrong lead star  totally differant from book would not reccommend this movie to anyone. Jack was 6'2 and Tom Cruise is only 5' 10,1389830400,,129,4.375
5505715,3,B00AS1Q8FW,It's the usual Tom Cruise roll.  Sad to say he usually just plays it one way.  Plot was ok. I wouldn't watch it again but that's just me.,1389830400,,137,3.857142857142857
5505716,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Great storyline but a little slow midway through.  Have read all the Reacher books and this is somewhat comparable.  Of course everything Tom Cruise does is fabulous!!  And the female co-star was believable and there was not too much violence in the storyline.  Hope to see more of these!!  Movies are much better than most of what is on TV>,1389830400,,341,4.616666666666666

5505719,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"I'm a Reacher fan - at least I was.

What the heck?  Everyone knows Jack Reacher is 6'5"" - Tom Cruise?  Are you kidding?  I hoped that some of Cruise's skill that I've seen on previous flicks such as Born on The Fourth Of July would allow him to play this role.  Sadly no.

And his female co-star really did a bad job acting too.

The entire time you're watching the movie, you're aware that you're watching a sub-par casting, acting, and directing job.

Story line was good though.",1389830400,,482,4.337078651685394

5505722,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I  have read all the books, which I really like.  The movie is well done.

5505724,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"If you've read Jack Reacher books, it's a bit of a reach (pun intended) to accept the diminutive Tom Cruise in the role of the large, intimidating lead character. Cruise does his best, but doesn't quite bring off the Jack Reacher aura. Decent action flick, though.",1389830400,,264,4.760869565217392

5505728,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Kind of goofy conspiracy. I couldn't figure out why the bad guys were doing what they were doing and even what they were trying to control. Cruise was good, but not great as Reacher. The action sequences were well done and graphic blood splattering was kept to a minimum.",1389830400,,271,4.551020408163265
5505729,2,B00AS1Q8FW,Horrible plot and acting.  This is the type of movie you will always regret having watched.  Do not do it.,1389830400,,106,4.25

5505733,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"If you've read any one of the Jack Reacher books, or all of them as I have, you would agree immediately that the strength of the Reacher character is literally his size and how he carries it. Tom Cruise, on his best day, simply cannot ""act"" big. The other actors were weak as well. This film was a total failure,  an insult to Lee Child's phenomenal writing and embarrassing to Jack Reacher.",1389830400,10,391,4.430555555555555
5505734,5,B00AS1Q8FW,Tom Cruise always choose his movies well. Nice chases. More of a mystery and detective work than an action adventure movie. Still well done.,1389830400,,140,4.875

5505739,5,B00AS1Q8FW,Good storyline. Did not anticipate a Tom Cruise movie to be this good. His acting was not upto Top Gun or A few good men standards but the movie overall was a good plot that was appealing and good.,1389830400,,197,4.076923076923077

5505743,3,B00AS1Q8FW,Typical Hollywood  action movie.  Good production value.  Decent story.  Good but not great.  Would have been better if they had explored Jack Reachers background.  No depth in the character,1389830400,,190,5.379310344827586

Tom Cruise, however, was the absolute wrong actor to play this role.  Everyone around him was really carrying the story for him.  He was barely sleepwalking through it and was not at all believeable.

Jack Reacher is 6'5"" tall, 250 lbs.  He is broad shouldered and very well built.  In every book he is described that way.  He is trained in several of the Martial Arts and is a champion marksman.  The scene with him shooting the target at the range was pretty good.  I could believe the actor could shoot.  But the rest of the fight scenes were way beyond believable.  How could a tiny guy like Tom Cruise fight off 5 guys who were so much bigger than him?  A giant like Reacher could, but not little Tom.  There are so many better actors that are closer in appearance that would have done justice to this role.  Too bad.",1389744000,,1047,4.352331606217617

I haven't read any of the Reacher novels, so I cannot say whether or not the film matches the excitement of the books, but I hope if there are a series of books, that there will be a series of movies.

5505812,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"According to Lee Child's official web site, Jack Reacher is 6'5"", 220-250 lbs., and has a 50"" chest. And according to several web sites, Tom Cruise is about ten inches shorter.

So like many fans of Lee Child, I was concerned that Tom Cruise wasn't right for the part. This is because, in the books, Reacher uses his size to survive his many dust-ups.

But Cruise pulled it off. He had the right attitude for Reacher. And in the fights, he substituted speed and skill for size. And he was filmed slightly taller.

Also, the movie was well-written, following Child's intelligent plot fairly closely.

I'd definitely watch this movie again!",1389744000,,638,4.7727272727272725

5505817,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"The story is essentially about bringing justice to some really evil dudes.  Super entertaining, although the violence is difficult to watch; that is, the stuff the bad guys are doing.  When Jack Reacher brings the violence to them, it's cathartic. A hero who isn't scared of making sure justice is assured. Refreshing.  Again, to get to the catharsis, you have to wade through some rough scenes--just a warning.  Unless you're used to lots of violence--then forget the warning.",1389657600,,477,5.076923076923077

5505822,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"The movie kept me watching and awake throughout.  That is saying a lot as I use movies to relax my mind and put me to sleep.

I think Cruise is a fine actor but he definitely did not fit the mental image I had of Jack Reacher from Lee Child's description of him in the various books. Having said that, I saw that I could view it on Amazon Prime for free and thought what the heck - if I didn't like it, all I wasted was a little time. Surprisingly, the movie was very good and fairly true to the book. I gave it a 4 star since it was shot in Pittsburgh and I'm originally from there. ( three and a half stars otherwise).",1389657600,,681,3.9420289855072466
5505837,5,B00AS1Q8FW,The movie has a lot of action that keeps you watching through the entire movie.  The only feature that is negative is that the background music is often too loud to hear the actors talking.  It not about the movie but the way the sound is integrated.  It may be my Vizio TV and speakers.  Other movies have the same problem.,1389657600,,324,4.262295081967213

Is he the shortest/smallest tough guy in movies? It's funny to see him taller than other people, because he is short guy, which means the extras must be really short !",1389657600,,318,4.3
5505839,3,B00AS1Q8FW,Not too loud or fast. Sufficiently entertaining and keeps u interested. Just looks so easy and to that extent a bit too unrealistic for a self retired top/intelligent/hero kind of guy.  Fun to watch tom cruise go thru the role smoothly.

And I'm not a gushing fan who loves Tom no matter what (I still can't accept him in the role of LeStat the vampire). He is, however, thoroughly enjoyable as the deadpan Jack Reacher. The action was great, particularly the car chase scenes. I would definitely watch this again and hope that there is a follow up movie. Even Robert Duvall was a treat!

Cruise has been touch and go with his movies lately, and though I enjoyed his last Sci-Fi flick ""Oblivion,"" it isn't the kind of movie I would want to watch another time.

This movie was much more of an unexpected thriller, with some small twists, and outcomes you don't really expect.
Acting was very good, and frankly if they made more Jack Reacher movies I would try to see them.
Great popcorn movie, but too violent and thought provoking for the kids.",1389657600,,581,4.533333333333333

5505879,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I was surprised at the story line.  Good action, acting was fine for an action movie.  defiantly worth the time watching a guy movie.",1389657600,,133,4.5
5505880,3,B00AS1Q8FW,Actually this movie was a bit deeper in the story line than I was expecting.  Enjoyed Robert Duval's role as well.  Plenty of guy action.,1389657600,,137,4.44
5505881,2,B00AS1Q8FW,I know everyone in the movie can act--I've seen them.  Several of the actors have won Oscars--so they have some chops.  This movie made everyone into cut-out characters that worked by cliche rote.  I'm blaming the director and the script.,1389657600,,238,4.9
5505882,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Overall, it was entertaining, but there's  nothing in it that stands out.  I recall a lot of other very similar movies.  It was enjoyable, but don't expect any surprises.",1389657600,,170,4.793103448275862
5505883,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I've never read the popular books, and I know that many fans of the book were deeply upset at the casting of Cruise as Reacher.
But I think he did a good job.  Even very good.
The film is well paced and all-in-all thrilling and exciting.
The combat scenes were crisp and satisfyingly brutal.  I like that the romance was almost nil; it would have felt too forced and out of character.  But the chemistry between the leads is good, if not electric.
I had low expectations, and no tie to the book, so I freely admit that I enjoyed the film more than someone more personally invested in Reacher may have.
I give it a solid recommend... to watch free on Amazon Prime :-)",1389657600,,666,4.312

5505890,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I originally saw the preview trailer for this movie in the theaters. My initial impression was that Jack Reacher was some sort of anonymous vigilante and he went around righting wrongs that the law enforcement branches were failing to. I was a bit shocked to see him ""reveal"" himself so early in the movie and then discovered that my interpretation of the movie trailer was incorrect. Nonetheless, I was actually very pleased with this movie and found that it kept me interested all the way throughout. Reacher is actually a former military investigator that has retired and dropped off the grid. He gets involved right from the beginning as one of his former military suspects is implicated in a major public crime and Reacher has come to town to finish what he started in the military but was not able to. Things go awry when Reacher ends up working for the suspect's defense team and discovers that much of the evidence against the suspect looks too ""open and shut"" and investigates further. From there, Reacher uncovers a much deeper plot that implicates many other people as being involved with the incident. That's all I feel is needed to mention regarding the plot as it gives a basic idea of the movie's premise without giving anything away. As far as the movie, it's pretty much a roller coaster ride from the beginning to the end. I found the plot to be well done, the twists and turns to be timely and well-executed, and the action to be plentiful but no so much so that it was at the expense of having a good story. While I expected to probably like this movie, I ended up tremendously enjoying it and found it to be a terrific detective drama with a good bit of action mixed in. If that's your kind of thing, you'll really enjoy this movie.",1389657600,,1753,4.568253968253968

5505895,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"Tom Cruise action movie:  gotta be good, right?  Nope.  The lines were cheesy, the ""aha"" moments were cliche and unrealistic, as in ""of course, THIS is what happened"" which is fine if it's a children's movie or a play I wrote in middle school.  Also, what's with all the women swooning over him?  Is that something from the comic or is that Tom Cruise jumping up and down on the couch telling the world he likes girls?",1389657600,,418,4.376623376623376

I was disappointed that Cruise was Jack Reacher but once you get over the fact that dude (cruise) is really small compared to the book, the movie is pretty good.

There was plenty of action, which was to be expected. The plot was a bit too convoluted for even a Reacher story. Overall it was a good view, especially for Jack Reacher fans.",1389657600,,328,4.45

5505914,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"This was a really poor choice for the lead role. I enjoy the Jack Reacher series of books, so it's hard to imagine Tom Cruise taking on a gang of thugs by himself.

This movie just didn't come together. I hope this movie series doesn't continue - at least with Cruise as the lead. Maybe it would be good with a more realistic Jack Reacher.",1389657600,6,339,4.2153846153846155
5505915,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Cruise is a good actor and he has good support in this movie. It takes skill to carry this story and each supporting character was cast perfectly. Rosamund Pike was convincing and made a good pair with Cruise. The bad guy was a bad guy. I think it takes alot  of know how to cast the right mix of people with characters that bring the story to life on screen. This movie does that. It is does not waste my time with filler that many  ""hollywood blockbusters today."" I don't think the movie industry is able to maintain quality writers because everything is about the bottom line.

5505920,1,B00AS1Q8FW,Tom Cruise is not Jack Reacher. Couldn't the find someone other than that midget to play the part? It was more like a poor tv knock off. Maybe next time they should just go ahead and get a girl to play the Reacher role.,1389657600,10,219,4.0

I would have liked to have seen the character Jack Reacher played by an actor who had the physical characteristics  as described in the novels. To me what makes the charter Jack Reacher such fun to read is that he is so big and quick.  The real essence of the Jack Reacher character is lost by Tom Cruise playing the role.

However, I did like the movie and thought Tom Cruise did a good job playing an action hero.....but is is no Jack Reacher.",1389657600,,594,4.130434782608695

Although the characters were flat as in two dimensional the action was intense if not predictable at times. On the up side the books by British author Jim Grant ( Lee Child) are much the same though over the span of the series Jack is fleshed out quiet a bit more.,1389657600,,396,4.1558441558441555

Typecast, definitely, but with this flick we see another side of Tom, not singly the badass that has all the answers immediately. Worth watching again.",1389657600,,398,4.619718309859155

I have to admit, Mr. Cruise did an excellent job and I was quite impressed with his portrayal of this fascinating character. The biggest problem I had with Mr. Cruise being cast I this role is that jack is ""larger than most men"". Mr. Cruise was EXCELLENT in his ability to ""nail"" the attitude and demeanor of Jack Reacher. I am looking forward to the next installment of this series.",1389657600,,510,4.494623655913978
5505999,2,B00AS1Q8FW,Just didn't see how the cop got involved with the bad guys. The plot was unique but the cop's involvement threw me off. Maybe it's because I was dozing off watching the movie.,1389657600,,175,4.333333333333333
5506000,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I do not like Tom Cruise. He's done a fine job as an actor over the years, not always perfect, but enough to be worth what he gets paid.

I am a Jack Reacher fan. When I heard of the role, I very much discriminated against Cruise for taking the lead of one of my favorite fictional characters. As Jack Reacher, I would have rather seen an unknown take the role than Tom Cruise. For me, a fan of the novels, he was a distraction.

But if I weren't a fan of the novels, and particular about the stature of Jack Reacher, I would say Tom Cruise was in a pretty good action flick. 3 Stars for the overall; +1 Star b/c it was filmed entirely around my home city of Pittsburgh (that's with an H, people); -1 Star because I think the role could have been cast to suit the fans of the novel. A good unknown who looks like a gnarly beast.
-----------------

One aside -- the scene outside the bar: I remember that scene so clearly from the novel. Of course I pictured it differently, but here's an example of why Cruise wasn't right for the role. Cruise has... sass. Reacher is a mixture of salt, sand, vinegar and indifference. I didn't get that feel from Cruise at all. They need a guy that puts you in the mind of... Clint Eastwood and Mickey Rourke. All grit and no bulls**t.",1389657600,,1269,4.2139917695473255

5506002,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"I never read the book series. I watched it because it received so many 5 star reviews. However, it was only a 3 out of 5 star movie. It's mildly entertaining. The casting was not compelling at all.

I suspect part of the appeal of the book's character, was the size and strength of Jack Reacher. Taking that way in the movie, not only diminishes the quality of the fighting scenes, but also requires a little too much ""suspension of disbelief"" for me. It would be no different than say, the scene where one of the bad guys knocks out Sandy with one punch.. but instead of that happening she just laughs and punches them out in one hit instead. Because she's the protagonist and a ""bad ass"", so the difference in physical size and pure physics, is ignored through ""suspension of disbelief""..",1389571200,,790,4.524475524475524
5506003,3,B00AS1Q8FW,Tom Cruise is not Jack Reacher if you read the books. If you haven't read the books then it may be okay. The movie is entertaining but isn't going to win any awards.,1389571200,,165,4.03030303030303
5506004,3,B00AS1Q8FW,We enjoyed this movie but I'm glad I didn't spend money on this.  Lack of plot development.  The ending also left too many loose ends and not in a good artsy way.  If this is based on a book I'm sure the books are much better.,1389571200,,226,3.869565217391304

5506010,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"The Jack Reacher series of books are a great read.  I looked forward to a movie version, but the casting of Tom Cruise as Reacher is terrible.  Jack Reacher is very tall; self-described as resembling a knuckle-drager with very long arms and a face only a mother could love.  He has a uniquely asocial (not antisocial) personality that Cruise just doesn't have it in him to carry-off.  The character, Reacher, isn't violent for its own sake, but makes sure that when his opponent is down, they are going to stay down.  If I had been asked to name an actor who is the opposite of Jack Reacher's characteristics, I'd have had no trouble saying ""Tom Cruise"".  Guess box office appeal won out.  The movie was OK if you didn't know the books, but would love to see it with someone who fit the role.",1389571200,,792,4.458333333333333

I was in my car and my husband was forced to listen to my tirade against Lee Child and Tom Cruise while driving.  I'm sure he wanted to run the car into a pole to shut me up, I was that upset (just kidding about the car/pole part). Anyway, he didn't understand my disappointment and I kept saying, ""you don't understand! you haven't read every. single. Jack. Reacher. book! I KNOW Jack Reacher! I LOVE him! I can't stand Tom Cruise! He's a shrimp! How can he do this?"" And then, the time came when it was raining, cold, dreary, nothing on TCM, and I figured I'd give it a few minutes while cooking dinner for the family.  I was hooked immediately! Tom Cruise did a pretty good job.  A good enough job that I actually liked the movie! It had great fight scenes, good chase scenes and Tom was good.  The girl in it was a doofus, but the story was great and it did convey the essence of a Reacher novel.  I was pleasantly surprised by movie but, as one reviewer said, Christian Bale would have been great in it.  That's who I always saw when I pictured Reacher:  Christian Bale or Jeremy Renner.  Maybe they could have a different Reacher every movie because Reacher is an everyman who does the right thing because it's right.",1389571200,,1332,4.321285140562249

Again I say, Tom Cruise is NOTHING like the Jack Reacher character in the books, and I just couldn't help feeling his and Rosamund Pike's acting in this movie left a lot to be desired.  Maybe if I had not read any of the books and didn't have anything to which to compare this move I would have actually enjoyed Cruise's version of this character...but that's a moot point.

5506039,3,B00AS1Q8FW,The character of Jack Reacher was poorly developed.  People who hadn't read the books must have had a difficult time understanding some of the scenes.  The chase scene didn't fit.  Jack Reacher was an admitted poor driver!,1389484800,,222,4.945945945945946

5506043,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"The bad guys are generic, he beats everyone up by himself, and Werner Herzog pops up as this non character who never get developed in the movie? That was baffling to me. The way it ended, it was like they ran out of time to tell a cohesive story. It IS, though, an effective type of cowboy-style movie. ""One man against the world"" it does do well mainly because of Tom Cruise's ability to play a believeable character in most instances. I still am trying hard to forgive him for Oblivion. The movie has ""Thrilling"" in quotes,. I wasn't thrilled. I found myself ""Mildly Entertained"" at best. Lot's of great actors that the director didn't know what to do with.",1389484800,,659,4.5

The movie drags and times and seems to get lost.  The acting was good, with the exception of Robert Duvall, and you liked the characters.  The plot was enjoyable as well but very hampered by poor directing.

I'd give it 4 stars if the characters were more complex or the plot was better developed.  The storyline was fairly predictable and really didn't leave you feeling like you saw something new or different.

5506056,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"For those readers who follow the Jack Reacher books, any attempt at bringing hero Reacher to the screen would have to be exceptional.  The movie follows ""One Shot,"" one of Lee Child's better stories.  There is the obligatory violence and female interest, though I wish that Rosamund Pike's role was given more depth other than giving us those luminous eyes for every emotion - anger, shock, fear, suspicion, etc. It's always nice to see Robert Duval, a good addition to any story requiring an ally.",1389484800,,498,4.847058823529411

5506073,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"This movie may not be for everyone, but it hits all my sweet spots. I like the understated bad-*ss that still has to take lumps like real humans do. Cruise may be everything I disagree with outside of movies, but I don't pay to watch him live his life. He has made some great movies lately and they work because of his low key charisma. I enjoyed the story and the tension between the characters and the realism that the movie was made with. I know it seems contradictory to say an ""over the top"" action movie seems realistic, but that is what makes it work so well. Mark Wahlberg brings the same sort of gift to the screen.",1389484800,,624,4.2521008403361344

Thus I finally gave in to watch the movie even though I was totally annoyed about the casting of Tom Cruise. Now I wish I'd held out. He's not just the wrong height and weight and appearance. He also has the wrong gait and demeanor and mannerisms and and speech patterns and interactions with other characters and .... Surely someone else could have portrayed Jack Reacher, but not this guy. If you like Tom Cruise and Hollywood chase scenes, then you'll probably like the film. If you appreciate the character of Jack Reacher, you won't find him here.

And the sexual chemistry between him and Rosamund Pike is hot! But without ever being reduced to a cheap romance. I'm so impressed by what writer-director Christopher McQuarrie has done with this story.

It wasn't filled with excessive violence, though it has it's moments, nor was it filled with over the top CGI.  The acting was good and the characters were quickly related to.  There were the subtle humorous moments and there were muscle car races making this a truly all-round entertaining thriller. To cap it all, there was a ""happy ending"", leaving that feeling of fulfillment.  I hate those books and movies that seem to just stop and never reach a true climax - From a Buick 8 by Stephen King was terrible for that.
One of the better movies I've seen in a while!",1389398400,,814,4.5793103448275865

5506117,4,B00AS1Q8FW,I was surprised at how entertaining this was. The story line was a little boring but I found it hard to turn away.,1389398400,,114,4.0
5506118,5,B00AS1Q8FW,Keeps your attention....doesn't cheap out like so many movies using special effects to cover the fact that it has no script. Really enjoyed the film!,1389398400,,149,5.0
5506119,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"There is a scene in Jack Reacher in which Tom Cruise, as the title character, steps out of a car and walks into a group of pedestrians as the police swarm onto the car. All of the onlookers let him do this, without making a fuss. One of the on-lookers even gives Jack his baseball cap to further aid him in eluding the cops . . . This all happens mere days after a killer has gunned down five people. Despite the presumed guilty party being in custody, this strikes me as total nonsense. It's supposed to be like the inspiring scene in Spiderman, when the train-riders help an unmasked Spiderman, but in this context it's just ridiculous. No one thinks the police might be chasing someone guilty of something? It's a poor scene that mars what is otherwise a fun, reasonably well done action movie.

Tom Cruise is a charming actor. Regardless of his personal life, I find him extremely compelling in his films. (Most of them, at least. This is better than the atrocious Knight and Day by far.) I come away thinking this would have been a huge hit if it had come out in the mid-90s. If you can disregard the scene I opened this review discussing, you get an interesting plot, solid acting, serviceable (if occasionally hammy) dialogue, and some clever action sequences, like the bar fight and the close-quarters fight in which the baddies mostly beat themselves up.

For lovers of action movies (especially of the Dirty Harry variety, given Reacher's disregard for institutional justice), I'd say this is definitely worth seeing, but not worth owning.",1389398400,,1549,4.6911764705882355
5506120,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I am not going summarize the movie, and I can't compare it to the book series because I never read them. What I am going to say is that this is a fantastic movie. The movie feels like those mystery action films that were popular in the 80's and 90's, but with a more modern style of filmography. The acting is spot on, and Cruise plays Reacher, the super cool ex-military detective, very well.

This movie has mystery, but not the nonsensical mystery you sometimes find. There is no out-of-nowhere plot twist, or unbelievable explanations. Actually, the movie lends you the clues to feel like you are solving the mystery along with Jack Reacher.

This movie has action, but not too much action. There is a few fight scenes, and one shootout scene. While Reacher is a great fighter, sometimes his victory comes down to luck, which in my opinion adds a bit of realism. There is also a really good car scene, that will have you on the edge of your seat.

This movie has a hint of humor. The humor is kind of sprinkled in the movie, but there were a few laughable moments, and a few smirk moments.

All-in-all, you deserve to watch this movie. Not everyone will like it (take a look at all the one-stars), but most will. I do want to warn some people who are pure action junkies, because this movie is like a roller coaster (slow in some parts but fast and furious in other parts), and will probably bore you. I really hope they make sequel, because these types of movies have been few and far between.",1389398400,,1498,4.416666666666667
5506121,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"This movie surprised me. It was obviously not well marketed because I had no idea what to expect. It was a very suspenseful action thriller with witty comeback's by the star, Jack, and toughness to back it up. No complaints here.",1389398400,,229,4.609756097560975
5506122,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"Jack Reacher - 6'3"" 230 pounds of hunky, muscled real man. Then you have Tom Cruise - 5'7"" maybe 140 pounds soaking wet. You have GOT to be kidding me! I actually laughed through the whole thing, laughed till I almost woke up my housemate giggling like a lunatic. I know that some people say he ""nailed"" the part, but come on . . . he is such a Weenie! I could kick his backside, and I am waaay out of shape!

OK, the story line itself was ""Reacheresque"" I will give them that. Dark and brooding 'shoot-em-up-car-chase'. Rosamund Pike is wonderful as always, though she plays a holier-than-thou attorney that really got on my nerves. Werner Herzog is just as terrifying as usual - he plays a wonderful horrifyingly scary guy. David Oyelowo really had no more than a bit part, which is disappointing - I would have like to have seen more of his acting. My favorite part of the whole movie was Robert Duvall, who plays his normal gruff, realistic tough guy with a heart.

Joe Manganiello would have been more realistic in the Jack Reacher part, as would Paul Walker (RIP 2013). Even James Caviezal would have been good for the part. I love him as John Reese in ""Person of Interest."" Ah well, I suppose there were some big number back room games played to give Cruise the part, but it is a shame that it happened. I had high hopes for the movie, but it was ultimately a huge letdown. Some people were apparently unable to overlook their 'pretty boy' hormones I guess, but that's their problem, not mine. Here is a great list of people who would be better as Jack Reacher! LOL

Having read all the Jack Reacher novels, I enjoy the plot twists that the author puts into the stories, and the kind of quasi-hero he portrays Reacher as being. Most of that translates well to this movie. Two main caveats, though. Cruise gets the attitude mostly right, I think, but his presence is not - and cannot be - the same as Reacher's presence in the novels. Second, I think the screenplay underplays the obsession Reacher has with details and minutiae, which in the novels tie to the overall plot.",1389398400,,555,4.56

So other than Tom Cruise and his outsized physical and mental abilities, whatever miserable city this takes place in is populated totally by knuckle-dragging, idiot, alpha males and only two women, who are penultimately stupid.
Speaking of the latter, they both have to literally or metaphorically be saved by Tom Cruise in every one of their scenes, because that's realistic right? The lawyer is my favorite. She is so dumb that I think her character must be physically impossible. Assuming this is all good, does anyone really want to watch a man try to chew off his own hand to keep from being murdered?

5506195,2,B00AS1Q8FW,Wanted an action movie. This made me want to go to sleep. It was predicatable which was okay but it took the cast way too long to figure out the obvious. They tried to mix sap (innocent victims and the relationships that they left behind) with weird violence (eating off your fingers to show loyalty). Tom Cruise looked as bored as I was.,1389312000,,338,4.380952380952381

5506201,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Not what I thought but a great movie. I thought it was going to be Tom Cruise kicking the crap out of hundreds of people, at least that's what I got from the previews. Wasn't that at all, although Tom does his share of ass kicking. It turned out to be a really good action/mystery/drama and was very entertaining. I would recommend for anyone to watch.",1389312000,,352,4.348484848484849

5506208,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"It's a decent action/drama movie. If you haven't seen it - you should. Jack Reacher is a seemingly clairvoyant ex-military investigator because he seems to have everything figured out as each phase of the movie progresses. Predictable results, but then, who doesn't expect good guy Jack Reacher to rise victorious in the end?",1389312000,,325,5.150943396226415

5506213,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"I read the Reacher books and Jack is described as 6' 4"" and solid muscle.  I had a hard time getting past the miniature physique of Tom Cruise.  Movies are often a let down after reading the book. That is very true in this case.  The story line is weak. Fight scenes are not believable.",1389312000,,286,4.163636363636364

So, unless you are just a freak for Tom Cruise, or have absolutely nothing else to do or watch for entertainment--don't bother watching this. The script is stiff and dull and just...boring. And the acting? I give a better, more believable performance at family reunions.

As a fan of Lee Child's series of novels, I've come to know Reacher as a BIG, IMPOSING, GRUFF man. I understand the difficulties in staying true to a book when writing a screenplay, but this was too much for me. A MUCH better choice for Reacher would have been Adam Baldwin. Many of the characters he plays in movies is very similar to the Reacher character. I guess the Hollywood stars and planets were not in alignment on this one, much to the detriment of the movie.",1389225600,,563,4.423076923076923

I haven't read the books and merely watched because it was available on prime...that said I was very pleasantly surprised..
I've always been a fan of characters that have an unbridled rage and Cruise really pulls this off...The fight scenes are convincing and lead one to believe that you definitely don't want to mess with this character.  The character portrayed is someone who given a reason...enjoys hurting others and doesn't feel bad about it.

I'll keep from saying everything that others have said...I enjoyed it very much and look forward to the next...going to definitely read the books...",1389225600,,746,5.098360655737705

Much of the reacher mystic is derived by his size and sense of right and wrong.  sorry but Cruise was not the proper fit.  cruise was too talkative.  I could go on and on but the bottom line is ..........it just doesn't work.  Lee made a big mistake....some friends are vowing not to read another Child's book.",1389225600,,513,4.02970297029703

5506242,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"3-1/2 stars

I've never read any of the Jack Reacher novels so I'm going to review as your average movie goer. I like actions, I like thrillers, so I thought I'd give this one a shot, the trailer really sold me too. I've got to say I was not disappointed, Tom Cruise is perfect for the role of Jack Reacher, ex-military police officer who is now a drifter with a cold heart and a no-bullsh*t way of dealing with things. He's witty, intelligent, and always has a quip lined up for any situation. I actually liked the character a lot more than the cliche plot line he's thrown into. It's your basic Military soldier is framed for a murder, yada yada yada. However the ending shocked me about as much the opening did (if you're really sensitive to firearm violence, the opening will probably scar you a little bit). I got a Collateral vibe from Cruise in his role as Reacher and was pleasantly surprised that I did (Collateral is an excellent film).

Pros:
-Cruise nails it
-Acting is good from all the actors in the film
-Entertaining but cliche story
-Cinematography is good

Cons:
-Cliche at times

Think NCIS meets Collateral meets Die Hard.

Worth a watch for sure and I look forward to the sequel.",1389225600,,1200,4.511520737327189

I was skeptical. I cried 'No' when I saw who they cast, but I was pleasantly surprised. The film has action and intrigue. I just wish there was more character development with ""The Prisoner"". But ya know, Jack wouldn't care...it doesn't matter. The scriptwriter surmised the character and his syndicate with ""This is what we do."" Which was clever enough. You didn't need the back story of the villain really. Nobody needs an explanation of greed. He said it himself, ""It's never enough.""  IF you read Lee Child's books you may have found this movie wanting.

5506262,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"This is an entertaining movie, but it could be so much better. In my opinion Tom Cruise is totally the wrong person for the role of Jack Reacher, especially if you have ever read the books.
The character development is lacking in the movie too, which doesn't help at all. Perhaps they should have lengthened the movie to better set the stage for the understanding of the characters.",1389225600,,382,4.632352941176471

5506267,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"GOOD movie. will keep you interested. I liked him in A Few Good Men - a lot. He is every bit as captivating here. Don't look for a stunner (""the truth, you . . ."") Instead solid entertainment.",1389225600,,192,4.078947368421052
5506268,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan but Jack Reacher is one of his better efforts.  The story was intriguing--s serial killing is blamed on the wrong guy--and Jack Reacher is there to discover the truth.  Lots of story twists and turns.  Bad guys who are really bad, good guys who turn out to be bad, and Jack Reacher--the ""bad"" guy with a heart of gold.  Better than I expected and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  A good evening's entertainment.",1389225600,,433,4.430379746835443

5506270,3,B00AS1Q8FW,He does not cut it in this role. Tom Cruise is just not the Jack Reacher of the Lee Child novels.,1389225600,,97,3.6666666666666665
5506271,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Tom Cruise puts on a believable performance in what I'd call a believable movie. The story kept me interested and the fight scenes were fresh and well choreographed. Definitely a great movie in the amazon selection.,1389225600,,215,5.0

5506279,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Very enjoyable and surprising.  Definitely ended with the hint of a follow up series. Won't watch it again but hope they do another Jack Reacher story.,1389225600,,151,4.8076923076923075
5506280,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"To one very familiar with the literary Jack Reacher, Tom Cruise is just not believable as the Lee Child anti hero investigator.

5506281,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I am a big fan of Lee Childs' character of Jack Reacher and have been for years. After hearing that Tom Cruise was going to play Jack, I was a bit dismayed. Tom is a fine actor, but physically he just doesn't match up to the character as Lee created him. Once I saw the movie, Tom pulled it off just fine and was I was very pleased with the movie.",1389225600,,347,3.9014084507042255
5506282,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Runed out a little better than I thought would be, but of course after reading the book it's hard for a movie to match.

5506285,4,B00AS1Q8FW,definitely a guy movie...tom cruise for such a little guy can definitely get the job done with his bare hands.  i didn't expect for him to play a tough guy and yet the movie had so many funny scenes.....i enjoyed it.,1389225600,,216,4.2682926829268295

5506288,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Cruise was the wrong actor to play the part,Reacher is suppose to be a big man,not a little guy like cruise,also crusie did not play the part of a loner",1389225600,,152,4.1
5506289,5,B00AS1Q8FW,This was our first Amazon movie.  Our only other experience is with Netflix.  In the evening with a Netflix movie there are usually several buffering pauses in the evening which we find very disruptive.  There were no buffering pauses with this Amazon movie.,1389225600,,258,4.953488372093023

5506293,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Tom Cruise has a way, kind of like Bruce Willis, those sideways looks.  He nailed Reacher's personality. Good books, good movie. Would like to see more Reacher movies with Tom Cruise",1389139200,,182,4.870967741935484
5506294,4,B00AS1Q8FW,I've read most to the Reacher books and did not think Cruise would work out.  He does a very good job.  He makes Reacher work.  It is a nice change from the glitz-slick movies w/ too many special effects.,1389139200,,204,4.17948717948718
5506295,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Solid movie, Cruise delivers old American justice all the while the beautiful  Rosamund Pike holds out hope that the court system will satisfy her doubts as she tries to defend her client.

5506299,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"It was an entertaining movie, but certainly not the best.  I never read any of the Jack Reacher novels, so Tom Cruise playing the part was ok.  No preconceived ideas about what he should look like, although I did notice alot of shots of TC low and far as if trying to make him look taller.  Hmmm!  Anyway, the plot...not much of one.  He seems to appear in each scene and magically knows everything that's happening even though he's been in hiding for years with no communication to anyone.  Although, that's a little tough to swallow there are the usual thriller aspects-murder, wrong guy arrested, and right now I can't even remember who was murdered.  Anyway, if you can watch it for free go for it otherwise, skip it.",1389139200,,721,4.542635658914729
5506300,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Normally, I look at Tom Cruise's movies like a college thesis just so I can stomach most of the corny lines. I will admit that the lines from this movie are very similar to those found in  the ""Show Me the Money"" movie, this seems to be a movie that finally breaks away from the Tom Cruise cliche. There were moments in this movie that had me in tears from laughter and it was really well done, even if the movie held cliche's from Tom's past. This movie is truly worth watching even if it is for the comic relief.",1389139200,,514,4.14

5506302,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I know a lot of Jack Reacher book fans don't like Tom Cruise as Reacher. I too read the Reacher novels and I am okay with Tom playing Reacher. He is believable as Reacher because you don't have to be 6'4"" to be a lethal weapon. The storyline is a good one and I hope to see more Reacher novels turned into movies.",1389139200,,313,3.984126984126984

5506304,5,B00AS1Q8FW,Really enjoyed this movie. I've read quite a few books with Jack Reacher as the main character and wish more were made into movies. Cruise was perfect for the part. Held my undivided attention through to the end.,1389139200,,212,4.605263157894737
5506305,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I read the book and I liked it. I liked the movie though somehow Tom Cruise just doesn't measure up to a 6 foot 5 240 pound man though he certainly is a good actor and carried the part reasonably well.

5506307,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I've never been a big fan of Tom Cruise, but boy did he hit a home run with this role.  Having read a number of the Reacher novels, I believe Cruise expertly embodies the Reacher character developed by Lee Child.  Forget age, height, and weight as mere surface issues.  An actor flawlessly captures a character when he or she exhibits attitude, delivers dialogue, and makes the viewer forget the celebrity baggage which often tarnishes a performance.  In my opinion, Cruise is 3 for 3 in this movie.  I enjoyed it far more than most movies based on novels.",1389139200,,556,4.63265306122449

5506313,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"This movie was actually a lot better then I expected.

The final battle was totally a let down.  Jack Reacher is on of the best shooters on the planet, but then for the final shootout, he brings a knife to a gun fight.  WTF ????

Really bad planning.",1389139200,,250,4.145833333333333

I must admit that Cruise did an outstanding job of capturing the essence of Reacher.  The movie was very well done but with work as brilliant as Lee Child's I would expect no less.  Bravo to the screenwriters and all involved who brought Child's work to life.  I did laugh a bit to myself about the casting, wondering how they found so many short actors to fill the supporting roles as not to break the illusion of a tall powerful Reacher.",1389139200,,683,4.230769230769231

5506327,4,B00AS1Q8FW,This is your typical frame a innocent guy to cover up a bigger crime movie but some how I didn't find it predictable.  Cruise does his usual tough guy routine yet it is not over the top.  Its an entertaining movie.,1389139200,,214,4.195121951219512

While I was not familiar with the Jack Reacher series, I found it holding my interest and meeting my standards for action and plot.  I had read reviews by the Jack Reacher novel readers that they were disappointed with Cruise as the main character. According to them, Reacher was a much more imposing physical specimen than Cruise who is only 5'7"" in height.

5506351,5,B00AS1Q8FW,I've lessened over the years as a Tom Cruise fan but Jack Reacher is a great movie with a solid story and great action and humor thread through it. Great cast of actors helps too.,1389139200,,179,4.142857142857143
5506352,2,B00AS1Q8FW,Tom Cruise is not an action hero or a sex symbol. He's in his late 40's about 5'6 and probably weighs 150 lbs. and we are supposed to believe he's a force to be reckoned with. I'm not buying it.,1389139200,,194,3.875
5506353,5,B00AS1Q8FW,This was a great movie.  I enjoyed it from the very beginning.  Lots of action and of course Tom Cruise.,1389139200,,104,4.15

5506360,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"I read a some of Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels a few years ago.  The whole idea is rather far fetched, that is, for Reacher to go off the grid in the U.S. while still being able to solve crimes, extract justice and move about the country at will is not believable.  We know what Vietnam Vets have done when they dropped out.  Reacher is being presented as a sort of superman, and Tom Cruise (although smaller than Lee Child's Reacher) manages to pull it off.  Although in walking away from his final scene not completely sure that there wouldn't be a national manhunt for him I would expect a bit more concern on his part.  But that sort of thing existed in the novels as well.",1389139200,,679,4.31496062992126

5506362,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Overall I enjoyed this movie. But being a huge Lee Child and Jack Reacher fan it was difficult to accept Tom Cruise as Reacher. The physical description of him in the books is just so detailed. But cruise had the personality down pretty good.,1389139200,,242,4.5227272727272725

5506369,4,B00AS1Q8FW,Good story and action. Plot wasn't hard to follow. Actors wore believable. Tom Cruise was not over the top as he can be in some of his roles.,1389139200,,141,4.071428571428571
5506370,1,B00AS1Q8FW,TC needs to hang it up. I turned this flic off after 15 minutes. Jack Reacher is supposed to be a big guy. If i have to hear ol nasal voice talk tough other than top gun is pretty hard to swallow. two thumbs down. yer no john mcclain,1389139200,,233,3.7755102040816326
5506371,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Undoubtedly one of the greatest actors for the last 30 years, this guy has hardly aged (!) and portrays one bad boy who can give fast, witty retorts to fools who tangle with him and can kick booty to pieces and drive like an Indy 500 champion!  He is great in movie after movie that I've bought and this is no exception.  He is called upon by a former military ""colleague"" who is now in a coma after being accused of shooting five innocent people.  Jack is not actually a friend of or witness to the event, but knows something intimately important about the accused.  Jack does not appear for what you'd expect... initially, but he is a military police investigator who is fair minded and sees more than his beautiful co-star (Rosamund Pike) who portrays the public defender.  Together they find a much more complicated and dark situation that is far from the cut-and-dried case that is publicly portrayed.  LOTS of action by Tom Cruise and plenty of twists and turns will keep you intrigued and waiting for yet more of these stellar performances... two thumbs up!!",1389052800,,1065,4.638297872340425
5506372,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I thought this film was a nice twist to the normal ex-military thrillers.  Tom Cruise did a good job.  I thought the camera work was well done as well, a slightly out of the ordinary.",1389052800,,183,4.2
5506373,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Good action movie.  Kept my attention all the way through.  Good twists and turns to the plot.  Enjoyed the fact that while there was violence aplenty, there was no gratuitous violence, sex, or unnecessary profanity.  I'd watch it again!",1389052800,,237,5.0
5506374,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Entertainging big of fare with plenty of action and suspense.  It was initially hard for me to get beyond feeling like this was a more aged, retired Ethan Hunt from the 'Mission Impossible' team back in action, as so many of the fight scenes, chases, and semi-implausible escapes seemed like something right out of the MI films, but this unfolds into a very clever and entertaining story that holds your interest.  As far as the supporting characters, Rosamund Pike seemed a little static and cardboard (she was perfect for the Bruce Willis film in which she played an android), but the cast of villians were a perfect assortment of creeps, especially the old German guy. There are a few notable uncomfortable squirm sequences (such as the finger-biting sequence) and this definitely isn't for younger viewers due to the violence, but the story is good and unfolds at a good pace.

I don't understanding one thing, though: why, when Jack was fleeing from the cops and popped out of the moving car at the bus stop, did everyone there help him out?  Was he that big of a hero with bus passengers that they all knew him and supported him or something?  I feel like there was part of the story missing and not established well, and all I can assume is that is the case, but this wasn't clear in the film.",1389052800,,1300,4.586206896551724

So in short, the movie has a solid plot, good action shots (nothing too amazing but good enough), and host of characters that keep the movie going. It's an action-thriller movie so you can't do better than a 4 -- unless you are light years ahead of the pack.",1389052800,,377,4.094594594594595
5506376,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"If this were classified as a comedy, I'd give it four stars. The plot is comically juvenile, but Rosamind Pike's  overacting is almost as hilarious as Cruise's delivery of lines that could only have been written by a 12-year old boy.",1389052800,,233,4.682926829268292

5506379,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Very entertaining with a decent plot and good action.  Jack Reacher is Jason Bourne as a do-good private eye. Have been off Tom Cruise movies for a while since he seemed to go loony, but happy I watched this.",1389052800,,208,4.333333333333333

5506381,5,B00AS1Q8FW,This movie is so good that I mistakenly watched it a second time and it still got me!  The supporting actress does a great job in her roll.  And of course Tom Cruise is wonderful.,1389052800,,179,4.085714285714285
5506382,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"This movie definitely deserves a one-time watch - even if you have read the books and are a big fan of the series. Sure, it may have plot holes and the other things that come with a movie that is based on a work of fiction - but it is entertaining. The only gripe I have with regards to accuracy would be Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher. In the books, Reacher is physically much bigger - close to 6'5"" and 250+ lbs.

Excellent car chase sequence midway through the movie as well :)

And I don't think that it has anything to do with Tom Cruise's lack of height, although it might have helped had Cruise been taller.

The only difference about JACK REAPER (Tom Cruise) and me....is..... I never got hit! Took all of them out, staring with the main guy 1st ( jus like Jack) and finishing the rest with one punch each! They all knocked out, every time, so....I really know it is possible!
Movie got me pumped up and haven't had one like that for awhile. Tom really nailed this one!
Very well done.......... ""Action Jackson"" Ole School kind movie! Surreal Dude!
Anyway..... I'm buying the DVD for my Collection.  Thank You!

Jack Reacher was mostly a bland character and the supporting cast only slightly better, with no twists or turns to keep you wondering.  All in all, it lacked an atmosphere and felt like it was a bad translation from the printed page to the big screen, even though I've never read any of the books upon which the character might be based.",1388966400,,651,4.327868852459017

Not only is he physically wrong but he is not a good enough actor to convey Reacher's sense of menace.  With respect to the people who are defending Cruise, Reacher's size and strength are key to the stories.

I also realize that all the plot lines can't be written into a movie script.  But I couldn't help comparing the run of the mill story on the Kindle screen with the great novel on which it was based.  A better screenwriter would have produced a better script.

I don't know how many times i've seen a movie that I had high expectations of because of the actors, director or screen writer and have been disappointed. Other than Tom Cruise, did not know anything about it. Just selected it,watched it and enjoyed it. You know the drill on these types of movies, how far can you go before you figure out who the bad guy is. For not giving you a ton of people to profile, I think they did a very good job balancing the plot and the characters without resorting to misdirection unnecessary to the storyline.
And yes, it is predictable and cliched  at times, but you can't just create a new type of drama/thriller. What I didn't like was how early in the movie Reacher knows everything about snipers, but near the end with the Gunny, all of a sudden he's a rookie and doesn't know the first thing about setting up. I also think the Gunny's character could have been developed a little more. IMO, more screen time for Duvall is a good thing! But then again, they probably didn't want him stealing the show!",1388966400,,1088,4.412935323383085

If you want to waste a good 2 hours wondering if Cruise is vain enough to produce a film where it's an ode to his ego, then this is your movie.  There are a couple of one liners and one good (and hilarious) fight scene that makes this better than a one star film.  Went in blind and with zero expectations, and came out wishing I took a look at the synopsis at least to give me some warning.  If you need a more recent Cruise fix, watch Oblivion.

By the way, the hero does NOT get the girl, nor does he make any overt passes at her, nor does he try to ""jump her bones' in every other scene.

5506459,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"This is a good movie. In fact, it was so good I purchased one of the actual books.
It was then that I realized the terrible truth.
Although this is a good movie with cool plot line, Tom Cruise is not Jack Reacher. Reacher is 6'5"" tall and very physically intimidating, also very calm and controlled. His size and mannerisms are so integral to the entire book and it's story line, that changing it devalues the story. Had Tom Cruise simply made this movie as a different character, or used a different name, it would have been a four or five star movie. As is, the movie only teases you with the idea of how cool a movie with ""real"" Jack reacher, as written, would have been. Using Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher is as silly, and would make as much of a difference in the movie, as putting Peter Sellers (as Inspector Clouseau) trying to seriously play a Clint Eastwood (as Dirty Harry) role. You are a great actor, Mr. Cruise, but this role is just beyond you (you are so very talented that you can pull off a role that many would expect you not to pull off well (Lestat comes to mind; great work there) but here it is like you trying to play Whoopie Goldbergs character in the Color Purple). Do us a favor. If you really like Jack Reacher, which you must, make another movie from one of the books, and put in people who fit the roles. You would have a winner for everyone.",1388880000,,1369,4.269230769230769

Watching it made me wish Tom Selleck was thirty years younger and had been chosen for the part. The restrained style is his forte and he does it so well. Someone with the presence of Selleck would have made Reacher a franchise for decades. It was an extremely good movie for what it was. I wish they had delved into the motivation of some of the other characters more, such as the police man who was working for the bad guys. I also hated the false trail that they seemed to feel the need to feed us with the DA. It was wasted and childish. The female lead was bland, almost furniture and that too was a waste. She seemed to have the chops, but it was like there was a hand on the back of her head forcing her to say her lines with no real presence.

5506489,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"I really like Tom Cruise as an actor, and I think that the movie is fun and exciting. However, the ridiculous premise where nearly every woman in the story seems to be infactuated with Reacher makes a decent movie seem otherwise cheesy..",1388707200,,237,4.666666666666667
5506490,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"As a fan of the Jack Reacher series, this movie followed the original book for the most part.

5506493,2,B00AS1Q8FW,It's simple. Average action flick.  Not a plot from any Reacher book.  Tom Cruise is NOT Reacher and never will be. Please  don't make another Reacher film till you have a Reacher who's on type.  Surprised Lee Child stood by for this.,1388534400,,234,4.5

5506498,5,B00AS1Q8FW,Such a fun movie. I don't buy many Blu-Rays but this one for me has great re-watch potential. The action sequences are amazing. The entire ending sequence is one of the best in an action movie in years.,1388448000,,202,4.342105263157895

5506504,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"This is a very good movie based on the Lee Child's ""One Shot"". Like any movie based on a book some shortcuts must be taken to keep the run time to an acceptable length. Now casting Tom Cruise as the the 6'5"" Jack Reacher seems like a big shortcut on paper, but Mr. Cruise is able to carry it off (or is it Ethan Hunt?).

The movie is well paced with very little drag. The actors do a great job, I can't point out a poor performance by any of them. I especially enjoy the interaction between Cruise and Pike (Jack and Helen). The fight scene outside the bar is excellent, as is the car chase.

If you have never read the Reacher novels, this is a five star movie and Tom Cruise is Jack Reacher.

If you are a big fan of the Reacher novels, knock off a star. it's still a good movie, Tom Cruise is Jack Reacher Lite.

As for the physical product, no problems with the Blu-ray or the DVD. The digital copy was easy to get, the code worked without issue. I chose to go through iTunes, but other options are available.",1388361600,,1013,4.126903553299492

5506508,5,B00AS1Q8FW,This is a great movie. I recomend it to anyone who likes action and drama. Tom Cruse has made a couple good movies like Knight and Day as well. Mr. Pete,1388016000,,152,3.935483870967742

5506510,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Although this movie is filled with plenty of action, the whole time I was watching it I still could not accept cruise as Jack Reacher.  I don't even like cruise anymore...as a person or an actor, but I wanted to see exactly how the movie related to the book.  cruise did nothing to enhance this first Reacher movie.

I won't get into all the comparisons of the book Reacher and the movie Reacher.  I'm sure the two different characters have been pretty well cussed and discussed.  I'll just say that; cruise DOES NOT meet the standards of who Jack Reacher is or was in the books.

If another Reacher movie is made with cruise playing JR, I will not buy it.  They need to get someone who meets the 'book' Reacher stats.  If they do that, I believe the reviews would be much, much better and the revenue would increase greatly for the movie sales.",1388016000,,845,4.406451612903226

5506512,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"Being a fan of Lee Child and his character, Jack Reacher, Cruise was hard to take.  Anyone familiar with the character in the book knows that a lot about Reacher is his size and the pint sized Cruise just doesn't work at all.  Maybe Jim Caviesal might fill the bill, but Cruise has to go.",1388016000,2,288,4.218181818181818

5506517,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"If you liked ""The Shooter"" movie with Mark Warburg you will like this.  Not a boring minute.  While some did not like that Tom Cruise was shorter and darker than the book Jack Reacher it made no difference to us.  We felt Tom Cruise did an excellent job and owned the part.  Will definitely buy if a sequel is made!",1387411200,,315,4.2

Totally rocks. It's a shame he ruins his income by wearing his religion on his sleeve but that seems to be in vogue in the middle east and the U.S. now a days.

5506528,5,B00AS1Q8FW,I loved this flick. I think Tom Cruise was great. Excellent story-line. Keeps you guessing until the end. Plenty of action of course with a dollop of humor for good measure. You can't go wrong.,1386806400,,193,4.542857142857143

When I first heard that Tom Cruise would be playing the lead role I did pause, and wonder.

5506541,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"If you're like me, you gave up on Tom Cruise a while a of, when his off camera nut bag antics overshadowed anything he might be doing on film, which wasn't great anyway. And I tried the Reacher novels without falling in love with them. So this seems a strange combination for me to be interested in. We'll, writer director Chis McQuarrie was the attraction. And he doesn't disappoint. The action, humour and drama and a great combination and Reacher proves to be a great cinematic creation by Cruise. Who would have thought that. If you'd like to see your hero with a bit more of an any man quality than Bond, perhaps Reacher's your man. Enjoy the ride.",1386374400,,653,4.495798319327731

Jack Reacher is definitely one of those films. It's a fun, tense and a great movie whodunit with one of my favorite literary characters, Jack Reacher. Although Cruise is perhaps better looking and not quite as hulking as the literary Jack Reacher, he still does an awesome job as the former military MP that is a loner travelling the country with only a toothbrush and a single set of clothes. The fight scenes are awesomely done and the automobile chase scenes are worthy of mention with those portrayed in Bullit, Ronin or The Bourne Identity movies. The villains of the film are also some of the best in years. An all-around fun movie that I hope gets a sequel or two with Cruise continuing to play Reacher.",1385424000,,857,4.535483870967742

Enjoyable from beginning to end, the story has a flow, and while Reacher (the character)  is almost too good at everything he does in the books, Cruise plays him as a mere mortal, with a few flaws but obvious humanity.  It's an action movie with believable action (no extended superfast choppy cut fight scenes) and some genuinely laugh out loud funny moments that catch you by surprise because of the dark subject matter.  It's the kind of movie you can't pass by if you see it's on.

Really hope this gets a few franchise movies.",1385337600,,656,4.52542372881356

Tom Cruse does a good job of creating his character.  He is believable.  He makes the most of the twists in the plot that make it so interesting.  I would watch a sequel starring him.

Rosamund Pike does a superlative job.  She is obviously fascinated and replused by Cruze.  In fact, the whole ensemble made it work.

Except for a gratuitous car chase and fist fight, you could kind of believe it, about like the book.

5506574,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Very entertaining action movie, based on popular book series.  Whatever you think of Tom Cruise, the individual, and I happen to be a middle-aged skeptic on many things, I have to admit  that this movie is highly entertaining, and that he brings an intensity to a movie that others do not.  This movie is no exception.

There was even a little unexpected social commentary here & there (OK, I  'fess up:  I haven't read the book).

So, even if the hero by the same name in the book (or so I hear-)  was a 6'5"" guy with blonde hair and blue eyes, which doesn't remotely describe  Mr. Cruise, he still did a heckuva job, and this was a very entertaining testosterone flick, by any measure.",1384387200,,687,4.432

It is an action packed thriller that catches you from the opening scene and keeps you on the edge of your seat right up until the very end. The acting is very good - headlined by Tom Cruise. Cruise is great in this role. He portrays as Reacher a tough, and intriguing character. His performance is one of the main reasons I enjoyed this film so much. The action was exciting and the storyline kept me interested. Overall this movie was well made and a lot of fun. I would strongly recommend it.",1383696000,2,667,4.21875
5506592,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"It is okay for a movie in and of itself.
When I read the books, the actor I picture and hear is Clancy Brown.
This is consistent with the traits of the book: Jack Reacher is not very good at sprinting or driving a car.",1383609600,,218,3.8666666666666667
5506593,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Jack Reacher was nothing like I expected it to be. The previews made this film look like a comedy, featuring some bad ass cop that doesn't play by the rules. The film itself couldn't be more different from how it was packaged and I think that's why it didn't do as well as it could have at the box office. The character, Jack Reacher, comes from a series of novels and the film is taken directly from one of the books. Strangely enough, they didn't choose the first book written to introduce us to the character, but one written much later. Reacher has spent his whole life in the military and retired as a military police detective. He had enough of not really helping those who deserved help and went off the grid. Now, Reacher only shows up when someone is in need of his help and in this film, that person is a former suspect of his. Reacher knows the man is guilty, but doesn't think he'd do this horrible crime on his own and he goes to investigate. The film was fast-paced and had an interesting story to tell, but they don't let us figure anything out! Jack Reacher has all the answers and tells us everything we need to know and how he figured it out way before we did. I get it, he's some kind of police savant, but it really is frustrating. I love a good mystery and the allure is in figuring it out on my own, but this film never gave me the chance. Tom Cruise stars and fans of the book series were mortified by the choice of producers to have him star as Reacher. I don't care much for Cruise either, but the fans protest had to do with the book describing him as a 6'7 powerhouse. Well who would they rather have had play Jack Reacher, The Rock? This was a major, high budget film, and it needed a big name. Cruise actually does a decent job and was very believable, as was the story, but the one major drawback for me was just how little was left to the imagination.",1383350400,3,1882,4.21606648199446
5506594,5,B00AS1Q8FW,This movie was very entertaining and while I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan he excelled as Jack Reacher.  It was also very nicely filmed in Pittsburgh so those of us with a Pittsburgh connection will see plenty of familiar sites and landmarks throughout the movie.,1383350400,,260,4.6521739130434785

5506598,4,B00AS1Q8FW,I was glad the plot was not completely predictable like so many films in this genre.  Some of the action scenes defied credibility -- but who watches a Tom Cruise action flick for its plausibility ?,1383177600,,198,4.5

5506600,3,B00AS1Q8FW,I have loved the series written by Mr. Lee but thought Tom Cruise was a poor choice for Reacher.  Someone taller and more withdrawn.  Cruise is too likeable.,1383091200,,157,4.571428571428571
5506601,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"like this movie.  I'm a little over Tom Cruise, but he did a good job on this one and I liked the fact that they didn't push the usual male lead/female lead romance at all.  Good story with a twist at the end.",1383091200,,209,3.8372093023255816

Tom Cruise did not fit that persona so i was very skeptical to see him take on this role. To my amazement Tom did a very good job and the movie was excellent in my eyes.,1382659200,,436,3.8555555555555556

5506615,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Jake Reacher does not get the girl.  What a shame that the producers and director forgot about Jack's masculinity.  They just brushed by Jack's ability to get the girl that he gets in every one of the Jack Reacher stories.  Other than that I was satisfied with the product.  6 foot 6 inches, 250 pounds,  that is not Tom Cruise.  However, I still think Tom does a good job of making Jack Reacher come alive on the Big Screen.  I would not mine if Tom Cruise did another Jack Reacher story.

Reacher shows up, looks at all the evidence and begins to piece together a much different picture than what the evidence seems to show.  The bad guys are busy trying to tie up loose ends, but soon there are more loose ends than any bad guy can possibly tie up with Reacher involved.

5506629,5,B00AS1Q8FW,The primary reason movies become effective story tellers is the ability to suspend disbelief.  Jack Reacher gives you pieces of his history to tantalize that suspension and then misdirects your attention when it is most effective to propel the story further.  Great entertainment value in addition to the action that Tom Cruise always bring to his action roles.,1381622400,,361,5.206896551724138

All indications point to his guilt and it seems like an open and shut case to everybody except Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise), retired Army police investigator.  What on the surface appears to be the work of a lone gunmen may be a conspiracy and it's up to Reacher to sort out the players.  This may be the best thriller since ""The Usual Suspects"" so it comes as no surprise that Christopher McQuarrie who wrote the script for that film directed and adapted Lee Child's novel.  The plot twists are plausible and leave you breathless.  I'm not very good with these detective films but my wife guessed pretty good the turns the movie was taking but even she was stumped at times.  Cruise seems more engaged than he has in years as the stoic Reacher.  He has created an iconic film character.

In the books, Reacher almost never uses a gun, rarely drives (doesn't have a license) and while he doesn't take guff from anyone, he is usually easy going, mild mannered and polite.  We saw none of those qualities in the movie and Cruise turned the character into a gun toting, race car driving jerk.  It looked a lot like a standard Tom Cruise drive too fast shoot em up movie and not at all like the richly developed character from the book series.  Liam Neeson would have been a perfect Reacher, how sad.

They say that the Reacher character as written was much taller and heavier, but without knowing this (or feeling let down, as fans of Interview with a Vampire felt when Cruise got the Lestat role),in scene after scene Cruise looks--and acts--positively diminutive. Many times Cruise says something ""tough"" and ""snappy"" then looks off to the left in a comically inept attempt to seem tough, while instead looking fey.

Cruise might want to screen Fasts & Furious (4, 5, & 6) or any recent Jason Statham film to see how tough and snappy is done.",1379548800,2,775,4.535714285714286

Cruise's acting was very good, and the character makes shopping at thrift stores look cool.

Off the bat, It lost a star because I cannot stand Cruise as an Actor. (I would have seen it in the theaters earlier if it were not for him in the lead)
The second star was lost because of predictability. The beginning was a bit too spoon fed and the scenario for the opening tragedy was prototypical.  I am sure there were portions of the film which landed on the cutting room floor with the interviews of the families of the victims but, that would have detracted from Cruises screen time and action sequences.  The car chase in the middle was gratuitous and did little to evolve the plot. The overall story was good with decent character development making you care about the characters and there was a moment near the end where you begin to rethink the allegiance of a main character.",1379030400,,835,4.450980392156863

I do not understand using Tom Cruise as the Jack Reacher  character.  In each book Jack is described as 6'5"" and either
220 or 250 LBS.  I really think that you could find an actor that fits the character better than Tom Cruise at 5'7"" and 160#.
I still like the story line and look forward to more.  Jim Price.",1379030400,2,437,4.154761904761905

He does a reasonably decent job with it though and most who are not as familiar with the books as I seem to not have any problem at all with him.  He definitely captures the mentality if not the physicality.  If you are looking for a decent action film, this one is entertaining enough to hold your attention.

It played well, even if I had known about the novel's Jack.  However, what really annoyed me was the use of an M-14 as the sniper's weapon.  There are a lot of rifles out there that could have been used.  The M-14 was a slightly smaller and more efficient M-1.  It could be lethal at 500 yards; at that range I got 6 out of 10 body ""hits.""  Not great, but adequate. It was not a sniper's weapon.  The older M-1 was heavier, and more stable, and it used the larger 30 caliber round. It was the weapon of choice for snipers, and could be far more accurate, especially when a scope was used.  Nobody was trained as a sniper with the M-14.",1378598400,,791,4.084415584415584

I think Tom Cruise makes a great Jack Reacher, and if I had read the novel I would have thought Cruise too short and too handsome.  But Reacher's real talent is his power - physical and intellectual.  Cruise does this well. He is the Lone Guy who sees a puzzle, fits the pieces together, measure the risk and reward and operates with Full Confidence.

Seeing this movie led me to read a Reacher novel...my first one ""Bad Luck and Trouble""  Yep, I am a Reacher fan.

I am not sure if this did well at the box office...I hope it did because I would like to see more of Cruise as Reacher.",1378598400,,677,4.1692307692307695

Tom Cruise is like a lot of other actors who have had a lot of success over the years in Hollywood.  They were fortunate to have the right script, the right director and a good supporting cast that allowed them to have successful movies.  Unfortunately this time Tom Cruise just plays Tom Cruise.

Jack Reacher is being chased by the cops, and a crowd of city folk automatically helps him hide for no reason. The cops are talking about how the arrested guy will only talk to one guy--Jack Reacher--and the secretary comes in and says, 'There's a Jack Reacher here to see you!' So bad. The only funny part was when Tom Cruise takes off his shirt, and the pretty DA is supposed to act like she's about ready to faint from desire. Cruise is a pretty fit 50 year old, but he's still 50 years old, and there's no way this pretty girl 20 years his junior would be turned on by his weird, shaven, skinny armed 50 year old bod.

Does the story interest me? Yes  Does it have a good balance between action scenes and drama/storyline? Yes
Do the actors do a good job with their parts? Yes

The movie meets my requirements in that it's well done and has a good storyline, and not overdone with action scenes.  Tom Cruise performs his role perfectly, and almost every time that happens you get a 5 star movie worth watching more than once.

5506788,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"I've read the Reacher series. I love it. Criuse is not reacher. He doesn't even come close. He's just a producer who wanted to make a movie. It's a fair movie, not good, not bad. Not much of a developing plot, not much in character development. It's got some action scenes and the fighting is close to real, but Tom just does not need to be a driver in that movie. He is not even close, which is surprising, since he knows better.

Anyhow, it's ok, but no matter what it's not a Reacher story. If you love Tom Criuse, it's ok, so go ahead and watch it. If you love Reacher, you might not love this.",1377475200,3,598,4.111111111111111

5506794,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Like many Jack Reacher fans, I had my doubts about Tom Cruise playing Jack Reacher. Cruise is not a six foot tough guy. However, he despite the physical detraction (too small, too nice looking) he played Jack Reacher very well, and the movie maintained the flavor of a Jack Reacher novel. I rented it first, then bought the movie because it surprised me by actually being a pretty darn good flick",1377302400,,396,4.591549295774648
5506795,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"As a Lee Child/Jack Reacher fan and a Tom Cruise carper, I did not expect to like this film. As many have noted, the sculpted, narcissistic, and frankly too-short Cruise was an unlikely choice to play Jack Reacher, who is almost a foot taller than Cruise and who studiously avoids the lime-light. But Cruise is surprisingly up to the part. His manner is dry and understated, quite Reacher-like, and he gives the other actors plenty of room. That's a good thing because Rosamund Pike is captivating as Helen Rodin, the defense attorney with whom Jack teams up. Her role is complicated in turn by the involvement of the undefeated DA, who is her father, thoughtfully played by Richard Jenkins. David Oyelowo is also compelling and weirdly touching as Emerson, the cop in charge of the case. Robert Duvall as Gunny Samuel Cash, is perfect as might be expected

I won't go into too much plot detail, so as not to spoil anything, but this film is deeply true to the novel on which it is based, Lee Child's best-selling ""One Shot."" (That may be because Child consulted on the film, which certainly didn't hurt, a fact that is itself a tribute to the writer/director Christopher McQuarrie.) Scene after scene feels like the book has simply come to life, and for a reader watching a film, such a feeling is rare. Where there are changes, they are the ones that are clearly demanded by the translation to the screen and also the locale. For example, the slow drawn-out tension of the final scene wouldn't work in a film where expectations are strong for a quick finish in the last 10-15 minutes. The site of the murders, minutely described in the novel, is slightly altered, probably to avoid building a commercial plaza and highway that existed only in Child's mind.

This film has the lushness and glamor of a traditional noir novel. The decision to let Jack's romance with Helen linger in the twilight of desire, irony, and innuendo contributes to the effect. The script and directing are a model of restraint and intelligence (like many a Reacher novel).

My only disappointment is in the truly unimaginative title. I can see why ""Jack Reacher"" might seem like the right choice, given the monitory role played by reference to the hero's name in the book (the accused requests Jack's presence by name before anyone else involved in the case knows who he is). But (especially in combination with the book's title ""One Shot"") the name of the film gives the impression that this will be the ONLY Reacher film. It's so good that I hope that is not the case.",1377302400,,2547,4.693512304250559

5506834,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"The story line held my attention well and I found it an exciting movie. Watching Reacher unravel the mystery was great, and the essence of that logic seemed true to Reacher books I've read (only 3-1/2 so far). I liked the characters as done by the actors. One distraction, which I nearly got over by the end, was Cruise playing Reacher. There were lines and deliveries that did not seem like Reacher. It seemed like Cruise was thinking ""This is what Reacher would be like if he were as cool as I am."" But his questioning of the young lady at the auto parts store was right on - that is, he mostly said nothing and just stared at her, which made her keep talking. Unlike at least one other reviewer, I liked the fight scenes. I'm not an expert at such things, but the way they went down was a lot like what I read in the books. Reacher is working a couple steps ahead and using his (and his opponents') movements work for him, and that's what Cruise's fights looked like. The only other distraction was the fight scene that started in the bathroom. The ""Keystone Cops"" aspect of the two thugs seemed out of place. Otherwise, it was a very enjoyable movie.",1376697600,,1154,4.372093023255814

It seems like his movies are getting worse and worse. The fight scenes were horrible. It was like each step was counted in really bad choreographed dance. The only good thing about the movie was Robert Duvall. Then again I have never seen him in a bad movie. I usually read the book before the movie and probably should have here. After this movie, I have no desire to,it was really that bad. The Reacher series probably is good. Although, after Cruise is now Reacher, I think I will pass.",1376697600,4,759,4.467625899280575

5506851,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Jack Reacher is based on the novel One Shot by Lee Child. It is part of a series of novels featuring Jack Reacher. They are all stand-alone adventures, not requiring knowledge of previous books for enjoyment. Reacher is an ex-military man drifting around America with the clothes on his back, a tooth brush, and an ATM card. He typically gets involved in some criminal activity when he runs into a victim who appeals to his sense of justice or a criminal who appalls his sense of justice. I've listened to three of the stories as audiobooks and found them exciting and enjoyable. But not One Shot. I was looking forward to a film version of the character, imagining Dwayne Johnson, aka the Rock, in the main role.

What Jack Reacher has is the more controversial casting choice of Tom Cruise. Certainly Cruise is a more bankable star, but Reacher is a taller, younger, and tougher character than the contemporary Cruise tough guy. Most fans of the novels groaned at the casting decision, but Hollywood runs on numbers, not on faithfulness to fan expectations. A related worry for fans was that the rest of the movie would be run by numbers rather than by the delightful craftsmanship found in the novels.

As for Cruise, I can see how people who haven't read the books would be satisfied with his performance. He does have the charisma and the toughness to deliver a great action character. He suggests the physicality through looks and voice quite well. I still wasn't fully satisfied, but Cruise performed well.

The story was interesting though moments of it fell into cliche. The overall conspiracy didn't quite hold together and the finale wound up showing too many recycled bits from 1980s action films. Not the good bits, either. The movie ran too much according to numbers than to good storytelling, resulting in a mediocre action picture. Which would be okay, if I didn't know the source material well enough to know how far short they fell from the mark.",1376438400,,1964,4.770588235294118

5506858,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Whenever a Tom Cruise movie comes out I check it out; they always are entertaining, well-produced, have strong scripts and good acting. REACHER excells on all points. It's even the Smartest Cruise movie I've ever viewed, even surpassing Jerry McGuire and Collateral in smart writing and ploting. It's more clever, and in the mystery/action category it offers more tension, trickiness and realistic violence I can remember in any flick of its kind for a long time; nothing's gratuitous; it's all linked together with plot concepts and makes perfect sense.

The pace never stops; in fact momentum builds, augmented by subtle false leads, good, often hidden clues  and misleading characters. I've seen it twice throughout and am now mid-way through round number three. (Aside from being a film fanatic, I usta write for a living; now, olde and retired, I only write reviews for Amazon and production notes for myself)

My five stars for Reacher covers all elements. Into viewing number three it's still tricky and smart.

5506860,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I really enjoyed the movie. I made a point of purchasing the product with a digital copy just so I could rewatch it easily on my iPad. Unfortunately whomever setup the Digital Copy flyer did a crappy job, not making it obvious that you have to choose between UltraViolet or Digital Copy.

I will state for the record that I don't use UV and make a point of avoiding movies that only have the UV option. That said, I've still noticed that on some movies you have to activate the UltraViolet code before you're able to request the Digital Copy. Not so with this movie. If you activate the UltraViolet copy (which is at the top of the flyer), you prevent yourself being able to access the digital copy. ***** There is NOTHING on the flyer saying you have to make a choice between the two options. *****

The only recourse you have to try resolve any digital issues is via Paramount's website. I've sent them two (2) requests one week apart via that method. I told them that the flyer didn't say anything about choosing between the two, that I didn't want it on UV, I wanted to have it in my iTune library so I could play it on my laptop & iPad, and they could delete it from my UV account. NO RESPONSE FROM PARAMOUNT at all. :(

Needless to say I'm upset (understatement) because I really wanted to be able to play the movie on my iPad. AWESOME movie. Am actually hoping Tom Cruise makes more of these. HORRIBLE customer service from Paramount.",1376265600,,1441,4.389513108614232

But no matter what I saw, Tom Cruise did not make me forget that Jack Reacher is a 6'6"", 225# blond. So much of the books is based on his size and intimidation factor. Cruise is a good, even great, actor but he just doesn't have that vibe. He is more of the ""surprise, I am quick and fast and good"" fighter, not the ""are you kidding me, you really don't want to do this"" kind of fighter Reacher has been portrayed in the books.",1375574400,,559,4.0

Even when he was talking to the guys holding the attorney hostage, he never admitted to being Jack Reacher. LOL! He even bought new clothes at a thrift store and threw out the ones he had on.  This guy was definitely off the grid.

I liked this movie it was dark and sarcastic.  It was the anti-hero. Tom Cruise did a really good job playing Jack Reacher. I myself wouldn't want to cross Reacher.  The scariest guys in movies are the guys who are way too calm, because most of the time that means there crazy and will mess you up bad.

Minus: If you have not read the book series this movie is based on, you're left a little bit out in the cold on Reacher's back story. The script should have fleshed out this aspect sometime in the movie. The all-too-brief description just does not do the character justice.

NOTE: OK, many reviewers seem to miss the point of a movie review. Its about the movie, not comparisons to the book. If the latter was the case, most would not like the movie version for The Hunt for Red October, which does not do the book of the same name justice.

For the most part, though, I thought Jack Reacher was a decent flick. Cruise seems intent on 2 things with this movie: to look taller than everyone else and to show he's still in shape for a 50 yr old guy.

The basic premise was just that..basic but they threw in a minor twist that added some flare. Overall not a waste of time to watch. It's a shoot 'em up movie with a little bit of good detective work on the part of Reacher.",1374969600,,607,3.9754098360655736

The writing is terrible, the plot is incomprehensible, the acting was terrible and cheesy, and I want those two hours of my life back. Not one thing about this movie makes any kind of sense. It had potential but then it just went nowhere fast. The ""mystery"" of the crime is idiotic and is never explained. There's this villain that is somehow so bad no one can even look at him but his motivation is ridiculous. It basically comes down to ""We take. That's what we do.""

5506954,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"This is the kind of movie is representative of the action movies that Tom Cruise has been making for years.  It's full of action with limited character development.  The criminology element was interesting and should hold the interest of the CSI types out there and while the action scenes are a little over the top they're not so outrageously unrealistic as to distract from the rest of the movie.

So what's my issue?  For those who have read the Jack Reacher books they know that Jack is 6'5"" tall, weighs around 250 pounds, and has dirty blonde hair and ice blue eyes.  In his background, Jack was a military Sergeant and Police Officer who mustered out in 1997 (several years before the Jet Li style martial arts craze) and used more of a brawler style of fighting when his size didn't intimidate people into backing down and giving him what he wanted.  Think of Dolph Lundgren when he played the Russian in Rocky IV.  The idea of Tom Cruise being the intimidating brawler is a joke at best and from movie poster alone it's easy to see that Tom Cruise is no Jack Reacher.

As a fan of the books, I would have rather seen them start with the first book, ""Killing Floor"", which not only kicked off the series, but because it takes place in the mid 1990's when Jack would have been in his mid to late 30's.  This means they could have chosen a younger actor who better fit the character and played Jack Reacher for another 20 years whereas Tom Cruise doesn't have too many action movie years left.  All said, it was an enjoyable movie as long as you realize it's a poor Jack Reacher movie.",1374883200,,1591,4.436426116838488

Excellent fresh handling of the detective/action/adventure genres that is up to par with McQuarrie's other excellent directorial and screenwriting work. Deft handling of the usual tropes and twists by a master of his craft. Tom Cruise delivers the acting goods, yet again, despite my always wanting to dislike him. :) Excellent acting, quick witted dialogue, fun, fun, fun. Highly recommended. McQuarrie's ""The Way of the Gun"" is similar in tone but perhaps darker and definitely funnier (both ""Jack Reacher"" and ""The Way of the Gun"" are dark movies with dark humor) and is also highly recommended.",1374796800,,760,5.237704918032787

It was actually pretty good. Very good, if you can forget that Jack is 6'5"". Due to camera angles, shoe lifts, boxes, whatever was used, Tom appears to be at least the same height as the other actors.

The action is great. Kick-ass, beat-em-up and don't take names kind of action. Jack is not just brawn he is brains too. That comes through loud and clear.

The movie was a little disjointed at times. Hard to keep everything straight. If you want popcorn, get it before the movie starts. If you wait you will be lost.

If Tom makes another Reacher movie I will buy that one too. I like action films. I guess, sometimes, size doesn't matter after all.  ;)",1374796800,,928,4.25

Tom Cruise would be better in the role of Frank Burns if they ever remake M*A*S*H, he's more of a sniveling has been than a tough guy.  All of the actors are capable of much better performances so I'm blaming the directer for the stiff, quirky, overly dramatic pauses and sequences.  The dialog was comedic at times.  And the Zek, the scariest thing about the Zek was believing his dentures held up  to gnaw his fingers off.  He's more like a senile granpa with soiled diapers.

5506985,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"If the casting of Tom Cruise was only to bring people to the theatres, they could have hired an unknown for the main role and get big names for the second roles, like the first Superman in 1978. It's sad to see the author make a prostitute of himself and try to make the rest of the world believe that Cruise is perfect for the role. Why is it so hard to believe that a big-ass actor would be next to impossible to cast? How about Dolph Lundgren?  Or Mickey Rourke? With CGI. You can even enhance the size of your leading character so that it looks totally cool. Like the beginning of ""Troy"" when Achilles fights an impossible giant. Plus, men like Rourke or Lundgren have that natural pissed-off face. We believe it right away. That has the advantage to make us care for how they became that way. We then feel concerned for them. Not with Cruise. He did surprise me, though.  His face did look harsh. But it just doesn't fly. You just know that Cruise is playing a role. I didn't really care for him. He wasn't very charismatic. And charismatic doesn't only mean having a big smile all the time. It's being naturally drawn and intrigued by someone. And Jack Reacher, the character, is intriguing. Cruise is not. Not here. For me, hard guys like the ones I've mentioned before (Lundgren, Rourke) are charismatic  in their own bad-ass way. You want to feel for them. On another level, I was surprised by the main actress (Rosamund Pike). I still think she was miscast. But still, I was convinced at the end of her sex appeal (cause let's face it, that`s one of the main criteria of such a role, as diminutive as it may sound). But at the end, this film remains a very, very average story. Not that it's bad. But I have seen ten times better in every aspects of the story. They even succeeded in misusing the talented Richard Jenkins and Robert Duvall. How's that for a cinematic treat? This movie is a miscalculation from beginning to end. There are B-movies that are way better than this. Having the author of the novels praise this adaptation is also very unfortunate as it makes you wonder about his lucidity. There have been actors and actresses that have been cast for unlikely roles before and that have surprised everyone.

I know this seems so rare.  I mean wow, a Tom Cruise movie where he brags a lot and beats people up or wins something.  These movies are so rare.  It's not a great script and it's not Tom's best work.  This movie could have been better if there was a personal plot arch for Tom's Character.  You could easily replace the title ""Jack Reacher"" for ""24, Rouge Agent"" and have it in the 24 universe and have CTU as the military faction that deals with ""Jack"".

I thought the casting was well done I would have liked the book ending but the ending was still solid to me. I hope Tom will be able to make another Reacher movie since the book series is a fun read.

5507026,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"The female lead is an awful actress.  Her facial expressions are somewhere between constantly surprised and constipated.  Actually found her to be significantly distracting from the film.  Tom's lines are at times quite contrived. Some good action sequences make a 3-star.

I apologize, this is now a 2-star movie.  I just finished watching it (the first review was about 3/4 the way through when I had to do some work and take a break).  The lead actress continued to bring down the film with her poor acting and ridiculously poorly written lines. Cruise's dialog continued downhill and the plot became really dull...as dull as you can get and still have decent action scenes.

A 2 at best.  Makes me wonder if this was just a scientology run picture rather than one that had good writers, directors, etc.  I know Cruise was the exec. producer, so ?.....

UPDATE:
Okay, so this movie is now available for free through Amazon Prime so I decided to give it another chance.
I stand by my evaluation of the female lead.  I honestly cannot stand the vapid, constantly surprised look she has during the whole movie.  I mean, eyebrows raised high, always talking in forced whispers, and that's literally ALL her character does. Irritating, annoying, just plain weird. Its like they tried to add drama to a scene by asking her to ""be really dramatic"". And the fact that they made her have this weird ""attraction"" to Tom from the get-go...also a very awkward somewhat non sequitur aspect to the script. Felt like it was put it in just for Cruise's ego.  I would be quite happy to not see a movie with her in it again.

Again, I will say there are some pretty good action sequences, with the bar fight being one of the better ones.  Except one that sticks in my mind: the finale (slight spoiler alert) where Robert Duvall is sniping from 300+ yards away...in the dark... and during the sequence, somehow the bad guys who are standing in the bright lights are shooting right at him with their machine guns while alternating to Tom behind a rock 50 feet away. All you could see of Duvall was a tiny muzzle flash when he shot (seemingly 500+ yards away at that time), but the bad guys were popping 3 or 4 shots in a row right at him and hitting within inches every shot...with machine guns.

Still a 2 star because of decent action.  The dialog and inter-character relationships are really subpar.",1373760000,2,2385,4.6270783847981
5507027,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Like many others I had intended to boycott this movie based on the fact that Cruise was cast as Reacher...which, pun intended, I thought was quite a reach.

5507032,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Not a critical success, but I liked Jack Reacher a lot. It's a comfortable vehicle for Cruise to play and the audience to watch, with Reacher bringing a collection of experience-driven heroics to the table as he pushes his way through bullies and bad guys to uncover the truth, dispense justice, and save the girl. A nicely done script complements a cast of credible actors and some effective action sequences. Well worth the price of admission (well, particularly at $5 ;).",1373673600,,474,4.864197530864198

5507034,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I have read all of the Reacher books, and I along with alot of people thought Tom Cruise was awful casting and I have only just gotten around to watching the movie.

I thoroughly enjoyed it and smiled along with the many times I saw the subtle ""Reacherisms"" translated to the screen...... when he first meets the DA's daughter and just walks off, the banter before the brawl, when he explains at the end of the movie to one of the bad guys how he figured it out...... ""Not even I would have checked the M**er"" as well as many others...Its a credit to Tom Cruise, that he made me forget the obvious physical differences.

From the disturbing opening credits, it rips along at a cracking pace and I was surprised how the time went so quickly considering its longer than average 2hrs 12min running time.

The look was sharp and Mr McQuarrie has given the movie a neo noir,  hard boiled quality to it, which fits with the character.....it would have been ruined with an expansive ""Die Hard"" approach

Tom Cruise is not - however, I really don't know who could have been cast as Jack with the physical attributes along with acting skills.

5507076,1,B00AS1Q8FW,Cruise is definitely miscast here. The books are good but the movie is awful. For some reason Cruise is continually cast as some kind of superhero type character when the fact is that he comes across as a smarmy smirking punk in every role he plays. Maybe it's just his real character coming through because he can't act -- he just plays spoiled little smirking Tommy whatever the role. The only explanation I have for his apparent movie success is teenybopper appeal and this should not be a teenybopper movie. Skip it.,1373328000,,520,4.663043478260869

5507089,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"The Amazon.com review says it best -- no matter what the movie content is, Tom Cruise gives it his undivided attention. He aims to entertain & he succeeds. I have not read the Jack Reacher novels (altho I think I will now) so had no issues with whether Mr Cruise was physically right for the part. He delivers on the action sequences, he adds a nice touch of humor to the proceedings, he swaggers w. the authority required of this character & refreshingly does not sleep with his employer even tho there is some heat between them. He can be classy or crude as the situation requires & when he walks thru the crime scenes he actually looks like he is thinking things through --the dialogue is snappy, the villains are a believable combination of low-life stupid ,no- nonsense killer & behind-the-scenes creepy/lethal & the car chase is awesome.  I went into this movie with no expectations other than knowing that Mr Cruise almost always delivers the goods & I enjoyed it more with each viewing. I am not quite convinced that the main actress is right for the part but she grew on me. And the other supporting actors are excellent. Tom don;t work with no slackers!! For an ""actioner"" this movie has a good blend of quiet scenes, real conversations & macho action that moved the plot forward w/o being waaay over the top. When the action happens it feels integral to the story & not tacked on just to show off the stunt work. The opening scene is ,from what I have read from Army/Marine sniper memoirs, chillingly accurate in its professional detachment & matter of fact methodology. It should bother you & it does!! It's good to watch this movie more than once because once you know the plot you can go back & enjoy seeing how it all gets set up every step of the way. Hey -- this movie kept me involved & entertained for 2+ hours & made me want to see it again to catch what I missed the first time around --that's what I want in a movie of this genre & that's what this movie delivered.",1373155200,,1987,4.4289617486338795

I have read the basis of this movie and find it very close to what Lee Child wrote.

5507107,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"As a Jack Reacher fan from the first book, I was thrilled to find out that there was going to be a film. That expectation was the high point of my experience with this movie.
First of all, the choice for a lead was so wrong! Tom Cruise has provided some excellent performances in his career, but this is not one of them. Most of the fun of the Lee Child series is the contrast between Jack's efforts to remain under the radar, and the circumstances he finds himself in that provoke him into revealing his capabilities.  I immediately  thought that Cruise had been miscast, and I was not wrong. Another distraction was the ""restrained"" sexual tension implied by the scene with his shirt off, and the unreal, unprofessional dress and behavior of the female lead. She served the same purpose as a shop mannequin, and her conduct should have gotten her fired the first time she came into the picture.
The pervading sense of disappointment was so overwhelming, I really could not concentrate on the movie as a separate entity  from the book series. Did I have expectations of the movie that were too high? Apparently. Was I correct? Obviously. Was what had been a promising beginning to a series of movies blown? Without a doubt.  I just thought that Lee Child must be off in the wings crying at the unforgivable mess that they made of his creation. Too bad!",1372896000,,1353,4.578512396694215

If you don't read the book first, you'll like it just fine.  I did, but my husband couldn't bare to see his well-liked character, cut down to size; do stunts, just to satisfy the Hollywood standard for an action film.  Picky, picky.  I liked the thinking Jack does in this film --and the ending isn't predictable, until very near the end.  Good villians, but the female lead (a defense atty)  was weak.  Her fawning looks at Jack, were a bit smarmy, and the actress didn't deliver her lines like she felt them.  Other than that, I enjoyed this film.",1372723200,,688,4.475806451612903

Having never read the books, my perspective is a little different than some other who say Tom Cruise surprised them in this role. I wasn't too surprised with his performance. While his presence doesn't make me want to see the movies he stars in, he generally does well with his acting. This film was no different. I found him to be a cross between Vincent (his character from 'Collateral') and Ethan Hunt (a la Mission Impossible 3).

The plot was a form of what we've seen many times before, but it worked okay.

5507119,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Though the plot was the standard slightly mediocre story line, the characters in this movie are so engaging ESPECIALLY Jack Reacher that I HAD to give it a full five stars. This was one of the best movies that I have seen in a while; one misses the hero that is NOT a hero. I am not speaking of the Dark Hero type such as Vin Diesel in The Chronicles of Riddick, I am speaking of a truly human individual with no super powers, no enhanced abilities... just a man.

Jack Reacher is a man that has seen way too much war, too much fighting and too much everything in the name of a freedom he had never truly experienced. Only to come home and find out that what we espouse as free is truly bondage in another area; so he is a drifter with a  mission of justice, leaving his old station as a military investigator behind but not his credo, values or personal stand against injustice as a whole.

This type of character is the type that we need more from Hollywood. And despite what was said by comic books fans, as I am not familiar with the comic, Tom Cruise was perfectly cast for this part despite his height and other dimensions that apparently don't match the comic book descriptors.  I am buying this movie which is the best form of compliment that I can think of in this day of streaming video with ease and no commitment to purchase.

If you didn't get to see the film because of what others have said (that judge it without even seeing it most likely) I urge you to give it a chance, let the story unfold and I guarantee that by the last 45 minutes of the movie you will be kicking yourself that you waited this long to give it a shot.",1372636800,,1640,4.193650793650794

But I found this to be a pretty good action film with a sufficient amount of off-setting humor to make for an evenings entertainment. There are a variety of actors who would have brought more fun and charisma to the part, but Cruise does a journeyman's job.

I realize this is supposed to be an action movie so a car chase is almost mandatory, but it should have been left out. I wasn't going to see this movie after hearing Cruise was going to play Reacher, but decided to give it a chance.

However for those who have been fans of Lee Childs character this movie has destroyed their character completely.  Tom Cruise may be a reasonable actor but its obvious that once again he is only able to play himself no matter what the theme.  This movie was the first opportunity to introduce another 'James Bond' or 'Jason Bourne' instead it was just another 'Tom Cruise pretending to be tough' movie. For those fans of the books it was great news to hear that at last Jack Reacher was about to make his appearance on the screen - they hardly expected Tom Cruise and not a single one has come out and said they were happy with his portrayal of a 6'5"" 230lb hero. I have watched the movie and find the scenes of Cruise facing(and looking UP at) the villains totally ridiculous. In fact it was much more like a remake of Hiram Holliday(in itself not a bad thing).
Sorry but Tom Cruise turned a blockbuster option into a mediocre flop and Lee Child has lost a whole lot of books fans along with it.

5507179,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Jack Reacher is an above-average crime thriller. It evokes past genre classics such as Bullitt, Dirty Harry, Lethal Weapon, and Heat. And while not surpassing those films, Jack Reacher still manages to entertain with Cruise's cool, charismatic performance.

Don't worry about his height. Cruise evokes Reacher's no-nonsense attitude and brutal ass-kicking to a ""T"". As the covers say (and this is coming from a fan of the books), Tom Cruise IS Jack Reacher. He does fine work in the role, carrying the film and capturing the attention. The guy, love him or hate him, CAN act. Just watch Magnolia for that. And recently, he's been putting out some pretty fine performances: his Stacee Jaxx, a muscular, tattooed, death-metal star was the best thing about Rock of Ages, and his performance as Jack Harper in Oblivion was also excellent.

The rest of the fine cast holds up well. The action is realistic, fast, brutal, and heavy, but also cool and slick. McQuarrie proves to be a good choice of director.

Jack Reacher may not be the greatest crime/action film ever made, but it's certainly entertaining and a cut above the rest when it comes to acting, action, plot, and visual style. Have fun.

However, I was pleasantly surprised by Cruise's portrayal of Jack Reacher. The style and pace seemed very true to the books. The Blu-ray documentaries were informative but pretty bland. It was interesting to see how close Lee Child was to the production and how he felt about the film's faithfulness to the book. I didn't listen to the commentaries but it would have been nice to hear in the documentaries why the title was changed from One Shot to Jack Reacher.

Bottom line: fun film. Fans of the books should not get hung up on Tom Cruise playing the title character.",1371945600,,676,4.540983606557377

5507186,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"I'm a fan of Tom Cruise but sometimes don't care for his movies as he often plays alpha males at the top of their game and his character at few times, even during death defying stunts, ever gets much more than a scratch, making it hard for me to worry he'll make it out alive.  This film was somewhat different as he plays an outsider.  I didn't read the novels the movie was based on and so come into the story with no preconceptions.  I thought Mr. Cruise did a good job, I didn't care so much for the way the story had the character dispense vigilante justice, and I also disliked how the character took up the personal space of I guess was his female love interest.  I liked it better than I thought I would, but I didn't think it was a strong movie, some of the character's behaviors I liked, some I didn't.  I'd give it 2 and a half stars and would certainly watch the next one in the series if they continue with it.  Basically I'd say, didn't like it, though liked it more than I thought I would, but didn't hate it either.  It was okay and different enough that I'd watch Mr. Cruise in this role again.  Interesting to see him play older than he usually does.

5507200,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"I've read all the Reacher books (I think) and have no great objection to someone of Tom Cruise's size being cast as JR. As far as I am concerned, however, the film didn't do enough to differentiate itself from the many other 'Action movies' already made.

Not enough was made of the calm and brooding menace, and the great powers of deduction. I think that's a combination of the screenplay and direction, as well as the acting. TC can do many things but he certainly couldn't stride manfully about the police station in the early scenes and he couldn't scowl or stare down anyone, as in the scene in the bus depot. The attempt at a 'seven samurai' moment immediately before the car chase was quite poor.

And why have a car chase? That just put the film into similar territory as the Bournes, Bruce Willis and others. I think the time should have been spent developing and illustrating the character, to create something different and play to its strengths. Talking of acting; I thought TC looked quite anxious whilst driving the car - I imagine JR isn't anxious about anything.

I enjoyed the opening scenes, the telling of a story without dialogue. We saw something of the analysis and sleuthing but not really enough. I just think that in the end we had a passable but identikit action movie when there had been a good opportunity to create something better.",1371859200,,1362,4.643153526970955

5507211,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"It probably helps to be consistently ranked one of the most influential people in Hollywood, if not the most influential person, because then you can choose a project that has intelligence to it and do it correctly, not with shameless pandering to attract audiences, yet at the same time satisfy some of the blood- and action-lust that is thought to draw men to the movies, along with their dates. This movie delivers on a lot of points that are characteristic of the star's iconic roles, and, what is something that identifies a fine piece of detective fiction for me, it holds together. Even I didn't notice some stuff, or, I should say, didn't question some stuff ... echoing something the hero says in a moment of possibly breathtaking but endearing humility. I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone, though, so enough said there.

There was violence, but not gratuitous; there was sex? Meh. There was action; yes ... controlled, adult, as in, mature, action, which I find so much more exciting and erotic than, again, the pandering to some lowest common denominator that if the denizens of such baseness were to find themselves waking up in and looking at each other in, is so low they might wonder why they were there; possibly nobody is that brain-dead that they go for cartoonish gore. In a word, there aren't too many action movies that hold my attention. This isn't to say that I am an arbiter of what is good or bad; but what I think Hollywood sometimes doesn't realize is that there may be absolute standards of what makes something great, or trending on the scale that way, because everyone appreciates what is classic. Think of the best films out there ... Godfather, The Fugitive, Seven. Did you like them? Because scores of other people can watch them over and over again. The intelligence behind them makes them endure.

So whatever your common denominator, I think you'll find this one worth the two hours in front of your tv.",1371772800,,1946,4.703812316715543

Third If he wanted to be noticed for this picture he should have paid more attention to the books.  Then he would have realized that there are people who read the books Lee Child has written on this character.  The cast was perfect but his portrayal of Reacher was sadly lacking.

Or if you're lifting a car up, sometimes someone tough and brave needs to be the ""jack reacher"" and get the jack out from under the car. So I expected that. Then suddenly I'm in some action caper. I mean, I would have even been okay with it being a story about Tom Cruise helping ladies reach things up on high shelves in the supermarket... but it wasn't that, either.

There are a few moments here and there. It's almost like they followed a formula. Insert fight scene here, now maybe a car chase, ah gotta have a gun fight or two and another fight scene & DONE. Yawn. There are definite lag points in this movie & I don't wish to give away what will happen in case you are still committed to finding out if these are going to be two hours well spent or if you're going to be like me and wish you had that time back in the end. But the one scene with Werner Herzog and the baddie henchman was laughably ridiculous. Hmm, now on second thought the movie may be worth it just to laugh at how ridiculous that whole part of the movie was in fact. Sort of how Gothika was a total bomb except the one scene where Halle Berry is driving and turns around to laugh hysterically only to turn back around and scream. Collateral was a better Tom Cruise as a bad ass movie. This one needs to keep reachin' for some more action scenes to fill in things.",1371513600,3,1117,4.081818181818182

Since I didn't read any of the Jack Reacher novels I don't quite know what the deal is with this character. He tries to come off as a super hero but then he doesnt know simple things that Robert Duvall tells him. He sees minute details in one scene and then stumbles over obvious things that someone with his training and expertise should automatically know.

Reacher does a very respectable job of providing some fun entertainment and for that, I really appreciate it.  I don't necessarily look for the next greatest thing in my movie watching; I don't pretend to be some sophisticated movie critic.  I like what I like and I like movies like Jack Reacher.  Yes, it's the old tried and true formula of the anti-hero type loner who comes into town to kick butt as only they can do.  I don't mind that  it's been done many times before.

Now that I've given my piece of mind, I must say that I was mildly surprised to find myself enjoying the movie.  Storyline was off base from the novel but movie moved along at a pretty good pace.

Physically of course, Tom Cruise is no Jack Reacher, but psychologically he carried it off.  That's why they call it acting!  The movie's plot is pretty much true to the book, which is the story of an ex-army sniper accused of a mass shooting. The accused man asks for Reacher, for an initially mysterious reason. I actually found Rosamund Pike more distracting because of her trace accent. The evil Zec and his gang were suitably scary.  I would love to see another Reacher movie.",1371254400,,786,4.5

I said to myself ""Oh, no, not again!""  Haven't we had enough senseless killings in this world?

This film is based on one of the books of the prolific crime writer Lee Child.
Christopher McQuarry mounted a nice looking film noir using Pittsburgh's unique locations.

With Tom Cruise as a 'modified"" Jack Reacher, the film is a good ride as far as crime film goes but with
a hollow center.
The simple story line may be able to get away with in a novel but for a film of this nature, you need much more
than that.
While watching this film, I kept on thinking of Clint Eastwood's ""Dirty Harry"" which this film should have been.

That being said, Tom Cruise always delivers.
You can sense his commitments to this film and his energy while watching the film.
Rosamund Pike was given a meaty role this time and she delivered in flying colors.

By turning the book into a film, Jack Reacher the protagonist might have lost some of his sheen, e.g. the 6 ft 5 in
250 plus frame drifter/crime fighter who doesn't own a car or a weapon except being handed one.

By turning Jack Reacher as described by the author in his books into Tom Cruise, it further watered down the uniqueness
of this central character.

Admittedly, Jack Reacher is a character who makes up his mind about things and, as is said about him near the end of the film, doesn't care about the law, etc.  So he does some unheroic things because he judges his adversaries and carries out punishment as he sees fit.  On one hand, he's a Dirty Harry kind of guy, but, on the other, he is a perceptive investigator.  And the plot ""secrets"" aren't that obvious, though you kind of know they are there from relatively early in the film.  But seeing ""facts"" of the situation explained was of interest.

Cruise is devoid of personality, and simply doesn't have the acting chops to overcome his physical disadvantages of playing Jack Reacher.
If you are going to make a Jack Reacher movie, go with an actor with presence, like Hugh Jackman, or Gerard Butler, someone who can convey the menace that Reacher is supposed to exude. The young Clint Eastwood, or Connery would have been perfect.

5507310,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Tom Cruise plays a traveling angel archetype military cop named Jack Reacher. It's the usual Cruise flair with some good to very good action scenes and an interesting mystery which some people will claim is convoluted.

Cruise's character teams up with a morally inclined female attorney played by Rosamund Pike, who try to figure out what was/is going on when an American sniper went crazy and started shooting civilians. Of course there's more to it than you would expect.

The real attraction to this film is watching an older Cruise play the Jack Reacher character who has the wonderful quips and badass action scenes and is basically above the law with a relatively straight moral compass.

The story unto itself is quite good, too, but as stated above some will rightly claim the clue trail was too complex and/or unsatisfying. I found it just fine.

Richard Jenkins stars as the father attorney of the Rosamund Pike character. Robert Duvall makes an appearance as a crusty shooting range shopkeeper and don't forget Werner Herzog as a creepy ""one-eyed"" villain.

This character is based upon a novel series by Lee Child. Its release was postponed out of respect for the Sandy Hook Elementary School Shooting in 2012.

The budget for this picture was $60M and it made a bit over $216M at the Box Office.

5507323,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I started this movie way too late one evening, but once I began watching it was impossible not to finish in one sitting. This is very well done crime story and psychological thriller. A How-and-Why-done-it rather then a Who-done-it. Tom Cruise is in top form in a mission-impossible (i.e., mentally and physically superior) type character who is requested by the sniper suspect in a seemingly open-and-close multiple-murder case immediately before the suspect is beaten into a coma due to being under-supervised in transport with other prisoners. It's a very odd request since Jack Reacher is the person who in the past had relentlessly pursued this man and attempted to imprison him for a similar crime committed as a solider.

This is a smart and well-executed fast pace movie that will make you think as you try to figure out who is behind the murders and why and what is Jack Reacher's deal anyways.

The one aspect that was not to my personal liking is that the last 30-40 minutes after the crime was solved it sort of switch-genres and turned into pure action-adventure-chase-and-shoot-em-up. This may appeal to people who like both crime-thrillers (which I do) and action-violence (not so much).

Yeah, it's not quite the same as the book, I read that too, but whatever is. Yes, height and size may be different from the book character but it really did not impact the movie at all.

As an ex-military policeman turned vigilante drifter is called in to help investigate after an expert sniper takes the lives of five random victims. The prime suspect Barr (Sikora) insists upon his innocence and believes he's been set up and asks for Jack Reacher (Cruise). Barr's lawyer (Pike) asks Reacher to investigate the shootings, Reacher is led to believe there is an unseen force pulling the strings of the investigation and he's determined to get to the truth.

Fans of the Reacher series have voiced their dislike of Cruise playing Reacher, who is a bigger broader and taller character in Lee Child's books. But Lee himself has said, ""Cruise doesn't soften the character and will grow with the film adaptations.""

Hooray to the wife of one reveiwer for not seeing it.
This movie needed to have a new face play Reacher, not Tom Cruise they always cast him in roles from books that the character is so much more that his pretty boy wimpishness, as in Interview with the Vampire he ruined your mental image, Oh well not many people read anymore so all the Cruise groupies will rejoice at him playing a character they have never heard of.

a sniper who went crazy and killed several contractors in the middle east;
but was swept under the rug because they had been involved in a massive
gang rape.  This time, though the sniper was being framed and it is Cruise's
job to find the truth, but he has to battle all these tough criminals who are in

A man who Jack knows got away with murder while he was in the military, is in a coma due to a serious beating while he was in police custody.

5507400,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"Tom Cruise who, imho, hasn't actually acted since what - Risky Business maybe?  Has now ruined what could've been quite a lucrative series of movies by allowing his gigantic ego to take over any possible logical decisions.

In EVERY single book and there are 17 - not including short stories - Reacher is described as:  ""Reacher is 6'5"" tall (1.96 m) with a 50-inch chest, and weighing between 220 and 250 pounds (100-115 kg). He has ice-blue eyes and dirty blond hair. He has very little body fat, and his muscular physique is completely natural (he reveals in Persuader, he has never been an exercise enthusiast). He is exceptionally strong, has a high stamina, but is not a good runner.""  His size is a significant factor in the stories - he can physically do the fantastic things depicted in the books because he's so ginormous.  Things that tiny little Tommy Cruise could never pull off - no matter how much he wanted to.

Cruise could've chosen to produce and even appear in a cameo in all 17 movies (and more to come, Mr. Child hasn't stopped writing these novels); found the RIGHT Reacher and launched the American 007 (as in a long series of movies - not comparing characters or content) - he could've profited off the series well into his old age.

Instead, he's made this ridiculous farce of a film that likely has soured the movie-going audience to this wonderful character all together.

Smooth one there, Tommy Boy.

As a long time reader of the books, I'm disappointed in Mr. Child, but am hopeful that what he thought the movie would be was not how it turned out and that his positive comments on the movie were due to contractual obligations - because Reacher fans know it's a piece of s***.

Don't bother seeing this movie - the books are the equivalent of an action movie in print.  They're fun, exciting, a bit of mystery, a bit of secksay time - the whole package.  This movie does none of that justice.

Hopefully someone will be smart enough to find the right Reacher, start the series with the first book and allow movie goers the opportunity to enjoy Reacher stories as much as the fans of the books do.

1)  Tom Cruise is not Jack Reacher.  Has he read a description from the book?
2)  I am going to give Ms. Pike the benefit of doubt and say the writing for her character was a mix between ""boobs, damsel in distress and deer in the headlights"".  Her part was pretty awful, delivered in a wooden and non-believing way.  Like, ""I can't believe these are my lines...really?""

The discription Lee Childs gives of Jack Reacher is a 6'5"", 225 lb. guy with hugh muscles and hands.

Like many, ok ALL Reacher fans I was bummed out that Cruise was playing the part.  But on the flip side I figured he would bring in many more people to see the franchise.  Was Cruise Jack Reacher,  no but I enjoyed the movie just because I like Tom Cruise and the story line was ok.  They didn't screw up the book too bad. I just pretended I was watching a Tom Cruise movie not a Lee Child inspired movie.

I figure Cruise will make another one or two and then move on.  Hopefully the series will go on and they will pick a big guy.  Somebody on the body size of a James Arness, Clint Walker, Chuck Connors, old TV cowboy actors who got the job purely on their size and not previous acting skills (John Wayne size). I don't know of any BIG Size current movie stars so the only Big Guy I know is Blake Shelton.  Can he act? I think so.",1370131200,,934,3.978494623655914

I am not familiar with the book series so I came to it free of preconceived notions.

He was perfect as Bane in the last Dark Knight movie.

I hope Cruise makes a ton of money on it and does more of them.

Like all Jack Reacher novels, Reacher finishes off the bad guys in a straightforward manner. No wierd, unexpected events. In fact, what is unexpected in this series of novels is how cooly and cleanly Reacher finishes the bad guys off. This movie does a great job of staying true to the finish.

5507442,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"This move is dripping with so much testosterone, it has the feel of a rancid wine made from the stomped leavings of a 1,000 eunoch's castoffs. I say that not just because of the gun-based plot and the car chase scene you can smell coming at the sight of the very first Camaro, but because of the fact that Reacher's character, especially with regard to the empty-headed women in the film, seems to act as the one brain for all of the other characters, good or bad. And everything he does, he does so with an extra splash of male posturing. He can't just kick your ass; he has to tell you in what spectacular fashion he will do so first, and also what your moral mistake was in having even thought you could take him on. I think Rosamund Pike as Helen must have won her audition based on the term ""confounded"" alone. One wonders how her character ever made it through law school without Reacher there to help her. Because this is also an Explaining Movie. Just in case you are as stupid as everyone else in this movie but Reacher, they will ask him questions and he will patiently, yet glibly, explain to them (and us) exactly how to Think. Silly. ""But...but, WHY would we be interested in knowing anything about our client?"" the lawyer asks, confounded. Don't worry. Reacher will tell us. Werner Herzog puts in a more amusing than chilling performance as an evil villain, and Robert Duvall pretty much has to show up to steal the limelight, which he handily does from Tom Cruise. As entertainment, this movie does fill that bill, although I would categorize it as a comedy rather than a thriller. It's just goofy.",1369958400,,1613,4.508532423208191
5507443,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Jack Reacher, a story about a wanderer that solves crimes and helps people in need. Don't be confused by the premise of the movie; that says it all right there.
The movie starts quickly: a sniper kills five people, a bunch of characters are introduced, a plot originates, and (spoiler) a conspiracy is unraveled. Movie over.
All in all, I did not dislike the movie. For pure entertainment value, it was worth a watch. We see an interesting premise for a movie involving corporations, retired army men, some good fighting and action, and alot of shooting. A decent movie, but lacking at parts.
First off, I felt through a good portion of the movie that I was watching an episode of Law and Order, or some other cop/ lawyer drama. They would sit in the office for long periods of time, trying to solve the case, while the story just got away from me. If you like cop and lawyer dramas, then perhaps this movie is for you. I did not find it particularly realistic or interest grabbing, but perhaps will appeal to someone.
Secondly, there were quite a few oversights within the plotlines, or just general things that I noticed wrong with the movie, or just plain did not fit. Others I just felt were just plain stupid, and did not add whatsoever to the story. (Spoiler) There is a scene in the movie where a dirty cop takes a defensive position behind a hostage, in which relatively no part of the cop's body is showing. Nonetheless, Tom Cruise's character bursts around a wall and kills him in one shot, regardless of the many shots being fired in his direction in a very narrow  and tight spot. Just dumb, reaching parts like this. Maybe that's why he is called Jack Reacher. Because many of the parts do just that...they reach, but fall short of realism.
Sidenote: Tom Cruise is looking very old in this movie, like his skin is stretched over his bones, and not in a healthy way. Just my opinion, but the shirtless scenes did him no justice.
Do I recommend this movie: It wasn't terrible, but it was not great either. You may like it, you may not. You may finish watching it and say 'Meh, it was okay', much the same as I did.",1369958400,,2125,4.4627249357326475
5507444,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Back in the sixties a new sort of character was formed in movies. This was the anti-hero, a person who did the right things but not always for the right reason and who always seemed to do things in the most unorthodox and unapproved ways. Where this was usually the odd man out during the time it eventually became the norm rather than the exception. Over the past few years there haven't been that many successful anti-heroes out there. With JACK REACHER that all changes.

Tom Cruise stars as the title character, an ex-military detective who is self assured in everything he does and can back up that attitude. When a man named Barr is accused of being a sniper and having killed 5 innocent people, he tells them to contact Jack Reacher. The problem is no one knows how to find him. That doesn't matter though since Reacher has seen the news story about the killings and heads their direction.

It seems like an open and shut case. The gun, the equipment to make the bullets, the van he drove and a quarter with his fingerprint on it found at the scene in a parking meter all point to the guilt of Barr. Helen (Rosamund Pike), his attorney, doesn't doubt his guilt but wants to make sure he isn't executed. Thinking Reacher might be her salvation she's surprised to find that he came here to make sure Barr is put away, explaining to her what he did years ago when he served in the military. But as she talks to Reacher things don't add up and he stays on to become her investigator.

If he did nothing more than that the story would be a short one. Instead, those responsible for the killings, attempt to take Reacher out of the picture resulting in some major medical problems to the five men who try to follow through on that order. Rather than brush him off it does nothing more than make him feel certain that there is someone else responsible for the killings and trying to frame Barr.

As Reacher delves deeper into the lives of the victims it becomes apparent why these people were chosen, or at least one of them. He continues forward facing down opponents tossed his way, an attempt to frame him for another murder and a slew of bad guys who want nothing more than for Reacher to go away. But that's the problem with an anti-hero. He may have nothing invested in the cause going on but when you push him chances are he'll push back...and much harder than you pushed to begin with.

Cruise has become the king of action films with not only this movie but the entire MISSION IMPOSSIBLE series and other films as well. In this film while he doesn't resemble the character from the series of books (a fact that miffed many fans of the series) he does turn in another fantastic performance as Reacher. Reacher is a character that you wouldn't want to anger but that you'd love to have in your corner. Cruise does a great job of making his Reacher believable with ease.

The rest of the cast does an equally commendable job, especially Pike who offers a character who could come off simply as a damsel in distress but who instead shows a bit of grit of her own. Noting that she is the daughter of the district attorney trying the case, she butts heads with her father throughout trying to find justice rather than a simple easy conviction for him.

Director/screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie has always had a handle on action films, smart ones at that. It would be great to see him continue on with this series with Cruise in the lead but a weak box office return for this film means that isn't likely. Then again hot DVD sales/rentals could change all that.

So if you're looking for some top notch action this week look no further than this film. It does it all in spades from fast paced car chases, to shoot outs to well choreographed fight sequences. Action fans couldn't ask for more.",1369958400,,3797,4.476878612716763

The only thing is it isn't a character. It is just Tom Cruise in yet another script. Tom Cruise is like a Barbie, dress them up any way you want it is still Barbie. Tom Cruise never acts, he is just Tom Cruise and screenplays keep getting written for him. Because, we all must really like Tom Cruise. Even enough to see him in any situation. There was a scene that sums up the movie pretty well. The regular cop says to Cruise something like, ""we have similar jobs"". Reacher was an ex-military cop. Cruise replies, ""Except all the bad guys I was after were trained killers."" Then that trademark head tilt, I am serious Tom Cruise look. Fight scenes are good, classic car, and interesting plot.

Tom Cruise is barely adequate - despite this being his type of thing so often - but he just can't carry the movie to greatness by himself, and he is just not 6'4"".

I came to this in a skeptical mood and did not like Cruise as Reacher but since then I have read two more Reacher novels.  Each was good in action scenes but poor in plot and structure.

Generally pleasantly surprised.

I will keep on reading Reacher books because there are few action thrillers as good as them out there.  I will continue to see poor plotting and good action scenes.

5507519,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Lee Child wrote the Reacher character as a 6 foot 5 inch giant with blonde hair.  Even though Tom Cruise is no more that 5'7"", he pulled off the nature and persona of Reacher beautifully.  You can see Lee Child in the film as the policeman sitting at the desk in the police station.  He has no lines, just a shrug, but it was interesting to have him sitting because Lee Child is 6'5"" or so and he would tower over Cruise.

Many Reacher fans (nobody calls him Jack) were very upset in forums that a taller actor was not used for the part.  I am sure that Lee Child was thrilled to get a top shelf actor like Tom Cruise to play the part.  If he was played by someone like Howie Long (one of Lee Child's early preferences), there would not be enough star power.  This makes it likely that there will be more films made with Tom Cruise having a recurring role in the movies as he gets older.

The movie is very well done, keeping in mind that several characters were consolidated into one and a change in venue was made.  The book ""One Shot"" did not take place in Pittsburgh PA and there were several characters that were left out to shorten the film duration.  Even so, the film did a good job of telling the story and capturing the confidence of Reacher, that some would describe as arrogance.

I am happy to have this movie on Blu-ray so that I can watch it again and again, just as I have read more than a dozen Reacher books multiple times.  Lee Child is my favorite author. I look forward to more Jack Reacher movies with Mr. Cruise playing the lead role.  I hope it has the same success as Albert Broccoli's James Bond series.

I also liked Helen (Rosamund Pike) who is the sultry lawyer trying to defend a man obviously guilty of multiple murders, or is he...

Jack Reacher is a tough as nails ex-military officer an ex-military policeman.  He arrives to find and take care of Jimmy Barr who is accused of killing 5 people with a sniper rifle.  He had promised Jimmy many years before that if Jimmy killed anyone that he would come after him.  He and Helen link up and she convinces him to help prove Jimmy guilty or innocent.  There are lots of violent bad guys, fights and action chases.

Overall the movie was good but there were a couple of scenes that were pretty silly.  Particularly the fight in the bathroom was ridiculous.  My wife and I liked the movie and we found it entertaining.  I rate it as a 4 star film.",1369612800,,963,4.236263736263736

5507527,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I haven't read any of the books by Lee Childs about Jack Reacher, but I know a few people who love this character and the author who writes him. Therefore, since I have never asked whether the movie captures the true nature of Jack Reacher or not, all I can do is review it from my own viewpoint. This was a very intelligent movie. When I say intelligent, I mean it did not fall back upon blood and guns and car chases to hold up the action and excellence of the story. The character of Jack Reacher is quite complex. He is obviously a very experienced ex-military member who has seen his share of bad situations and has been highly trained, as if he had been an Army Ranger or a Navy Seal. He also seems to have some significant holdover emotion of the experience.

Even with the intelligent, complex storyline, what I REALLY liked about it was I didn't get lost as I do in a lot of movies that try to lay out a complicated situation and resolution. This, also, was a different Tom Cruise, more in line with Minority Report. Restrained and trying to find the heart of truth in a plot that is full of twists and turns. Others in here have already given the plot points, so I won't go there. However, I do want to say that the supporting cast, Rosamund Pike and especially Robert Duvall, are excellent in their respective roles and make this movie much stronger and better.

I don't think this is Tom Cruise's best role to date, (being inclined toward Minority Report for that one), and I think his role in Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is very, very good. However, I give him kudos for him not trying to look younger than his age. He definitely looks at least close to, if not right on, 50 years old. The media tends to make Cruise out to be a bit of a prima dona, but this role definitely showed his age, and for that, he won points with me. I deducted one star because it just isn't a 5-star movie. I'd would say, however, it is right on the mark at 4 stars, which is very good. It will be interesting to see if Cruise continues to keep his roles maturing as he is.

This movie has something for everybody. As I said, a lot of twists and turns, there is a car chase that is somewhat heart stopping, and figuring out who the bad guy is was not easy (points given if I can't pick the bad guy a quarter of the way in!). Not having read the books, I can't equate it with Lee Childs intent of the story. I can, however, review it on the basis of whether or not it meets the requirements of a movie worth watching. And Jack Reacher is definitely worth watching. Highly recommended if you like a good action movie with smart characters and an involving story that manages to keep you on the edge of your seat without constant scenes of gun fights, lots of blood and gore, but quite still quite thrilling. Money well spent on Jack Reacher!",1369612800,,2838,4.281191806331472
5507528,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I like Tom Cruise. My sister has been reading the Jack Reacher  books so when the movie came out she went to see it. She really liked it so I bought it. It's a pretty good movie, action packed.",1369612800,,193,3.948717948717949
5507529,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"It's hard to understand why this didn't do better at the cinema - it's actually an above average thriller - pulp fiction beginnings, but pieced together into a screenplay that fairly sizzles along, and runs like clockwork.  Tom Cruise might not look quite the bruiser that the books apparently have him written, but coming to the movie without preconceptions, I certainly bought in to him as the outsider with a drive for his own personal brand of justice, which doesn't always mean living on the right side of the law.  He brings a pent up but honed, trained energy to the part which works well.
It would be fair to say that the plot doesn't rely on action set pieces, but when they do come along they are well executed, notably the mid movie car chase, rather that the slightly more pedestrian conclusion. Satisfyingly, these set pieces serve the plot rather than appearing to be merely a studio request.  Most satisfyingly still, although the storyline wanders some well trodden paths (Jack Bauer meets John Rambo..?), it does so in some unexpected ways.. not that it is a twisty plot per se, just that it is not sign posted from the outset, and the screenplay sparkles with some memorably economic dialogue.  If the secondary characters are given lesser roles to play with, it's almost forgivable in the face of the efficiency of the plot as it careers along, as driven as the main character.
Christopher McQuarrie should be congratulated on getting an excellent balance of intelligence and thrills, and a good performance out of Cruise in the lead role.  Cruise doing his own stunts - notably in the driving - certainly adds to a sense of realism which helps the movie, as does a memorable cameo from Robert Duvall.
I'm not encumbered by any preconceived notions of the character or the story, not having read any of the books.  However on the basis of this film, I'd be delighted to see more of the same.. and Tom Cruise did convince me at least as the unstoppable Jack Reacher.  This isn't a movie which aims for the moon.. it's not trying to be the years most action packed, or most intense... however it has aimed to be a well crafted thriller bringing Lee Childs protagonist to the big screen in an intelligent and involving way.  And this it has done admirably.

5507530,5,B00AS1Q8FW,Jack Bauer has competition. I hope they make more Jack Reacher movies. Much better than I expected. We loved it!,1369612800,,112,4.65
5507531,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"""Jack Reacher"" was adapted from the 2005 novel ""One Shot"" by Lee Child, which is part of a series. Christopher McQuarrie both wrote and directed the film. A sniper goes on a killing spree in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, killing 5 unrelated people in broad daylight. Clues at the scene lead police detective Emerson (David Oyelowo) to arrest former army sniper James Barr (Joseph Sikora), and District Attorney Alex Rodin (Richard Jenkins) charges him with the crime. Barr refuses to speak to investigators but makes a single, written statement: ""Get Jack Reacher"". Reacher was a much-decorated MP investigator who knew Barr in the army. Barr's defense attorney Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike) assumes, incorrectly, that Reacher will be a character witness. In fact, Reacher dislikes Barr but is not satisfied with the evidence against him.

I haven't read Lee Child's ""Jack Reacher"" books, so I don't know why this one, which is in the middle of the series, was chosen for the film or how much it may have been altered. But all of the characters in this movie are cartoons, the dialogue is conspicuously terrible to the point that it made me cringe, the plot is ridiculous at every turn, and we never understand any of the villains' motives. If that weren't bad enough, the female lead, defense attorney Helen Rodin, is dreadfully miscast. She is supposed to be a trial lawyer. Trial lawyers have strong personalities, and they do not show cleavage in the office. Helen doesn't even have a personality. Rosamund Pike's breathy voice sounds like a low-rent night club chanteuse who constantly flirts with customers. This is ridiculous on a lawyer. And the film runs too long at 2 hours, 10 minutes.

But ""Jack Reacher"" shows us what a movie star is. Tom Cruise doesn't have the physical stature of Lee Child's Jack Reacher, but he sure has the screen presence. The man is 50 years old, and he is totally convincing as a smart, fist-pounding, gun-toting vigilante action hero. He's a movie star. He makes the audience want to watch him, even if we must endure the next ridiculous scene and torrent of corny dialogue to do it. I'm impressed. Tom Cruise's charisma can sometimes carry this movie. But Cruise is the only thing in ""Jack Reacher"" that is watchable. The only good thing I can say about McQuarrie's direction is that the omission of dialogue for the first 8 minutes works well. The film was a box office success, so the writers may get another crack at this character if it is to be a franchise. They have a great male lead. The rest of the package will need a lot of work.",1369526400,,2574,4.7690582959641254

So we all have a set image in our minds what he should look like, very large and tough. other then the coloring, The Rock, would have been an excellent choice too (size wise) I was very disappointed and hope if there is another movie (doubtful with the straight to video release) they choose someone more appropriate.",1369526400,,717,4.318518518518519

5507551,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I have been wanting to read a Jack Reacher book before I saw this movie. With my son home for Memorial Day weekend, wanted to watch something he was sure to enjoy, so we chose this film. We both enjoyed it. What's great about movies based upon books, they usually have more depth, twists and nuances because you are packing a 300 page book into a 90 minute or so movie.

There's usually great back story. In this movie, there's a multiple shooting with plenty of clues pointing to a killer with a past. However, are the clues too obvious? And why does Jack Reacher suddenly show up? And why isn't he wanted on the scene? Who is trying to run him out of town and why?

The plot thickens.

The actors were well-cast. While I can understand readers' disappointment that the Reacher actor wasn't 6'5, blonde and chiseled, Tom Cruise carried off the role of Jack Reacher. I found him believable. Loved Robert Duval as owner of a gun range - he was my history professor's college room mate, so always enjoy seeing him. Rosemund Pike, as the attorney for the accused, is an actress I would like to see in more films. The other actors seemed well-suited for their roles.

The story held our interest, seemed fresh and original and we were glad we watched it. The script is entertaining - Jack had some zingers. Hope there is a sequel to this movie from another of the Jack Reacher books.",1369440000,,1379,4.4603174603174605

The plot is filled with enough mystery, intelligence, and twists to keep you wondering what will happen next.  Three important characters' loyalties are constantly in question.  Jack is always in charge and driving the plot.  He is a no nonsense, get to it kind of guy.  This makes you keep your eye on every scene.  The only weak part is the gun shop owner.  But Duvall is the actor, so the guy is enthralling!

Enjoyed watching Reacher (Tom Cruise) put all the pieces together. Am a huge fan of Tom Cruise and Robert Duvall acting together so that was an added bonus for me. Think they have great screen presence together. Am not that familiar with the actress who played the defense attorney for James Barr but she did a great job too. Loved her expressions. Loved the scene with the bad guys in the alley where we first see the main bad guy boss and the ""things stay done"" conversation.

He romped and stomped the villians in true Reacher style.

I didn't like the use of Jesus' name as used in the movie.

I think the previews and the promotion people were ""playing the biggest role"" by marketing this film to the ""Tom Cruse"" fan base.

The movie was okay, to be honest, it reminded me more of a late 1990's or early 2000 screen play (example: John Travolta in Basic). I paid too much to rent this, I should have waited and got it from Red Box",1369180800,,505,4.315789473684211

A few good fight scenes, a good car chase.. but not a lot of character development as far as the bad guys go. Cruise was good for the most part but I felt like some of his lines that were supposed to be funny did not come off as funny as intended - they felt a little forced. Even the ending seemed a little unfulfilling. All the loose ends were tied up and they kinda left it open for further films but it was just anticlimactic.

Not horrible but not Cruises best work - although it was cool to see him share some scenes with, Days of Thunder costar, Robert Duvall again. Wouldn't mind seeing a sequel to THAT movie!",1369180800,,688,4.212121212121212

they also forgot about the other military officer that jack reacher knows that comes in to help put the gentlemen away.
the police chase in the car im sorry was not in the book, jack reacher walks most places, moves to another hotel before the girl is found dead in which she was hit once and was not leaving to go out to meet someone, they went to her house woke her up and told her to get dressed and killed her with one punch under the freeway and didn't have to suffocate her.
At the firing range Jack Reacher made the shot with one shot not three shots.

Its too bad all the film had was Cruise with big brass ones bringing it to the bad guys a few times. The surrounding story is a snore with just a smidgen of tension.

My fiancee and I are avid movies watchers, in various genres. We love stories, we love acting, and we love talking about these things afterwards. We even ditched cable because our obsession with buying/renting was too obvious. That said, when 'Jack Reacher' made it's way to Amazon for rent, our decision watch the trailer was a no-brainer. You'll note that the trailer for this would have you believe (by implying quite strongly through its editing) that this is an action movie about a vigilante hero who rights the wrongs of social injustices. Possibly in a vintage muscle car. Apart from the car, this couldn't be further from the truth! In fact, like most movies that are absolutely terrible, you actually see all of the best scenes in the trailer.

The film itself is lackluster and fails to produce any real interest in what's happening. In tandem (and perhaps more importantly) with this, Tom Cruise utterly fails to deliver in the role. There's no way to find anything 'mysterious' about his character, because he's too busy trying to culminate whatever charm and 'sex appeal' he may think he has left in his 50 year old body. Believe me when I say that after the first half hour of absolute boredom I was begging to believe his role if only to stop my restless squirming as the tired plot droned on. It just couldn't happen. My fiancee may have even groaned more than I did.

There's a certain scene in the movie, where Cruise is exposing the plot... and the writing flips itself on it's head for a moment and falls into this poorly done Film Noir dialogue, as seen in those fabulous old detective movies (and books). With now understanding this movie was based from a book this makes a little more sense--but in the moment, where I had no clue of this fact--I actually lifted my hands up and asked what the hell was with that! Immediately in the next scene this style of dialogue disappeared and was never seen again. It was perhaps the lowest point of the movie. Not just in that it was poorly placed, poorly done, and horribly contrived... but because this is also the point in the movie where you realize A) This is confirmation that the trailer was misleading and B) The 'bad guys' are so ridiculously laden with lameness that the movie is only ever going to get worse.

That is not an understatement. Because not only do I not care about the main characters from the beginning, now I can't even count on falling in love with the villain because they've sucked out any ounce of potential cool they might have had. By the time the movie is in it's third act and Cruise's Reacher is bumbling around in his midget-like strut to stay 'one step ahead' of the bad guys, I'm convinced he should never ever be put into the role of a person who is meant to be extremely intelligent. He can't do it! That and the bad writing didn't make it anymore difficult for him to crash and burn with it. He effortlessly manages to suck supremely in this role.

At the movie's climax, I was hoping for a left turn. Perhaps one that involved a nuclear device landing in the predictable show-down scene that wiped out everyone--then roll credits. Sadly, it plays out exactly how you expect it would. With no flavor, no wit, no charm, and certainly without hope of ever being memorable. I'd say the vintage SS was the star of the show, but I've never been fond of those cars... so there's no solace for myself or the fiancee. Why this movie has so many good reviews I have no idea. I can only assume standards for films such as this have dropped significantly, or that many of the reviewers are fans of the book, Cruise, or all of the above.

If you're like me and don't care about Cruise, the books, and actually have yourself some standard for movie entertainment... then my advice? Watch the trailer and imagine the movie the way it sells itself; it'll leave you with a great feeling, and then you can save your money and move on to something else. I assure you it's not even worth the rent.",1368835200,3,4257,4.514915693904021

It doesn't have costumed superheroes or grand special effects, but it makes up for it with real stunts.

Well this was surprising. I've never been a huge Tom Cruise fan, but judging from the trailers Jack Reacher looked like it was a solid action flick and, for the most part, it was. Unfortunately, it loses some of its steam in the last 30-40 minutes when it transforms from a unique thriller to a cliched action film.

Jack Reacher starts off with a sniper (Jai Courtney) taking out what appears to be five random people. When police arrive on the scene all evidence points to a man by the name of James Barr (Joseph Sikora), a former U.S. Army sniper. When given the option to confess or go to trial his only response was ""Get Jack Reacher"". While being transported to a new facility, Barr is beaten into a coma by his fellow inmates and that's where Reacher comes in. Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) is a former officer for the U.S. Military Police Corpse. He's also a drifter which makes it extremely hard to find him.

When he arrives at the hospital where Barr is being kept it's no surprise that District Attorney Alex Rodin (Richard Jenkins) and Detective Emerson (David Oyelowo) are more than a little surprised. While at the hospital he also meets Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike), who is serving as Barr's defense attorney. When asked how he knew his friend had asked for him, Reacher says that Barr isn't his friend and that he had come to kill him. The rest of the movie deals with Reacher and Helen putting together the pieces of a very complicated puzzle as we find out that Barr was not only set-up, but that the shooter had a secret motive.

From the start Jack Reacher is extremely engaging. In fact, about half way through the movie the disc I was watching this on started skipping and I don't think I've worked faster in my life trying to get a movie to work again. Luckily I did, but maybe it was a sign that I should've called it quits because about 15-20 minutes later the story started getting out of control. They took every action cliche in the book and applied it to the end of this movie. Now this was never an intellectual film, but it had enough flare that made it stand out from the crowd. It offered some fresh ideas to some old formulas which made it worthwhile, but that somehow got lost during the film's final half-hour.

That's not to say that Jack Reacher became unwatchable, but the fact that we had Reacher rescuing the damsel in distress (Helen) just felt really out of place. Reacher never showed any signs of intimacy towards the woman, so what was the point? There was no romance at all in the first hour and half, but he somehow cares so much for this woman that he's willing to risk his life for her? It just didn't add up and it felt like it was put there just because we've seen it done in almost every other action film ever created. To top it off the film allowed little-to-no closure about who these men were. We learn about a possible motive for the shooting, but it's obvious these people don't work for the company that hired them. So where did they come from?

The cast, for the most part, did a good job and I don't really have many complaints in this department. Tom Cruise gave another Tom Cruise performance. We've seen him play this badass action hero before so don't expect to be blown away by something new. Rosamund Pike and Richard Jenkins both gave solid performances. Nothing to write home about, but nothing that brings down the film either. The only one who felt a little flat was Diavid Oyelowo. In the beginning he was fine, but as the film progressed and we learned more about his character his performance kind of fell apart. That's another thing, they didn't go into detail about why his character did what he did. All he said was ""You act like I had a choice"". Okay, well what did they do to you exactly? There's just a lot of things the audience never finds out.

Overall Score: 7.75/10 - I know this looks like a high score compared to the amount of complaining I did, but that shows just how strong the first 80% of this film is. If it would have been more consistent it probably would've gotten a nine, but, as you can see, that didn't happen. They had some cool ideas, and Reacher is a pretty interesting character, but the end of the film is very underwhelming and they leave a lot of unanswered questions. If you're a fan of Tom Cruise then chances are you've already seen this. For those who haven't, if you don't mind some cliche in your action films then you should at least give it a rental. Because even though the ending is a little generic, the rest of the movie is more than worth it.",1368748800,,4610,4.429245283018868

5507716,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Jack Reacher is a better movie than what is being described by the reviewers who gave it one or two stars.  It seems many people dislike the movie because Tom Cruise is a foot shorter and one hundred pounds lighter than the character described in the books.  Not so sure that makes it a 1 or 2 star movie.  Many say the plot is typical and pointless.  I disagree.  I haven't read ONE SHOT, the book this movie was based on, so I thought that hiding the targeted killing of someone amidst the seemingly senseless slaughter of many to be quite clever.  Granted,it was not unique, but still.  And if you have read the book, well you knew the plot going in.  Those of you who dislike the movie because of Tom Cruise as a person...I guess I would ask why you went to see it in the first place?
I agree with those who said the car chase was obligatory and not all that relevant.  But Hollywood just doesn't seem to be able to get away from those.
Unlike most reviewers, I am not a fan of the novels, though I've only read the early books in the series.  The Jack Reacher in the books just doesn't seem all that likeable, nor is he easy to relate to.  Cruise's Reacher is a little more likeable, and his motivation easier to comprehend.  Though I wish the whole living off the grid thing would have been explained a little more.
My big complaint with this movie is the lack of development of all the characters.  What's up with the lady attorney and her father?  The lead detective's statement concerning not having a choice didn't explain his actions.  And the villain?  Truthfully, he did not seem all that real.  But why was the widow's death his only option? Why was owning that particular construction company so important?
There is speculation among some reviewers that because this movie was a box office disappointment there will be no more Jack Reacher movies starring Tom Cruise.  That's too bad.",1368748800,,1899,4.47093023255814

The alterations in the plot were ridiculous and not worthy of the  strong character of Jack Reacher.  Hollywood just had to put in a car chase that lent nothing to the plot and was never in the book. Cruise did his best with a miserable script and the lady lawyer was a dismal and disappointing potrayal of the one in the book.

5507735,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"There were stretches of the 2012 film ""Jack Reacher"" so derivative, I would stare from my window and estimate my tax return. I'll be the first to admit Tom Cruise is one of the great movie stars of recent times, and there was an era he could do no wrong. To his credit, he's survived three decades, skillfully choosing productions to maintain a stormy reign. One of the frustrations of his career is he avoids edgy projects, marching through middling films like ""Jack Reacher"" where he barely has to pose.

Cruise has worked with so many greats -- Paul Newman, Dustin Hoffman, Jack Nicholson -- it's no wonder his iconic status has marched far longer than contemporaries (what are Andrew McCarthy, Matt Dillon and Val Kilmer up to these days?). So what to make of ""Jack Reacher?"" Based on the popular series of novels by Lee Child, specifically&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-Shot-A-Jack-Reacher-Novel/dp/0345538196/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One Shot: A Jack Reacher Novel</a>, Reacher is a super everyman who lives underground without a credit card to his name. He's been trained with skills rivaling Jason Bourne, is a war hero and travels by Greyhound bus. When lounging at the local motel, he strolls around with his shirt off. In his wake, women swoon and gangs of men are soundly whipped.

There's a sadness pervading ""Jack Reacher,"" akin to the Clint Eastwood's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rookie-1990/dp/B003LCKZ6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rookie (1990)</a>&nbsp;or, going back further, Burt Reynolds'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heat/dp/B0000C0FFV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heat</a>. Clint and Burt, studs of former eras, were well into their senior citizen years when they repeated these fatigued variations of once-macho status. They were depressing films, with Eastwood firing big guns and Reynolds battling Vegas toughs in bell-bottoms. Rather than tackling age-appropriate roles, they were starring in tired formula pictures to maintain dwindling box office muscle. The connecting thread through all of these wheezing attempts is Cruise, Eastwood and Reynolds can act. But for some reason, they couldn't act their age (to Eastwood's credit, he evolved as a considerable director).

All one has to do is go back and watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Born-on-the-Fourth-of-July/dp/B000ICXQR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Born on the Fourth of July</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jerry-Maguire/dp/B00170M2JY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jerry Maguire</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Magnolia/dp/B0036T1RMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Magnolia</a>&nbsp;to see Cruise has chops. So why is he wasting his time in machine gun battles? At one point during the concluding dramatics, Cruise has the villain trapped. Rather than dispatch the menace, he throws down his gun to fight hand-to-hand in the pouring rain -- a cliche even when Akira Kurosawa used it in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven-Samurai/dp/B004D1CK32/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven Samurai</a>. There's also a car chase that depressingly echoes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bullitt/dp/B001F4UHGC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bullitt</a>. The classic Steve McQueen vehicle is the greatest action film ever made. There's a scene in that coolest of cool films where McQueen goes shopping at the grocery store and humorously buys a large stack of TV dinners. ""Jack Reacher"" has little time for such creative quirk.

This film was directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who cut his teeth writing the screenplays for ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Valkyrie."" He's not a particularly good director, possessing all the imagination of Paul W.S. Anderson. There's an average mystery here, where a Pittsburgh man is accused of being a random sniper. Like Alan Ladd in buckskin, Reacher rides down out of the mountains and teams with the defense attorney (Rosamund Pike) to uncover a conspiracy. Cruise's character could have been interesting -- just exactly why is he a homeless loner? But the film is too busy with fist fights and Chuck Norris high kicks. And I'm still not sure who the main villain was, played by Werner Herzog of all people.

While ""Jack Reacher"" turned a profit, Cruise is selling himself short. Newman turned his career around in the 1980s by playing a burned out police officer in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fort-Apache-the-Bronx/dp/B00319ECCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fort Apache, the Bronx</a>. After years of gimmicky disaster flicks and peculiar Robert Altman excursions, the explosive performance was a revelation.

Gray hair, crow's feet and life's twilight disillusions were embraced, and he would continue to challenge himself with fascinating projects while marching towards unparalleled respectability.

No, but he plays the character with all the intelligence and attitude necessary to make up for it.

Well written and well executed, this movie is about honor and justice. There are a few Hollywood Leftist stabs at the military, and civilian contractors in Iraq, but that is par for the course these days. It's kinda like a little baby that is oh so cute, then it has to do a little dootie while you are holding it and as you are going ""gaga googoo.""

I found this to be an imaginative whodunit with alot of unexpected twists and turns. The film does have a tendency to over analyze on the details but over all I found it better than expected.
The story starts with the ""random"" shooting of five individuals in an open waterfront park in Pittsburgh. The perp is picked up and brought in. The only thing he will tell them is to find one Jack Reacher. They send him to a holding cell but on the way he gets beaten up by fellow prisoners and has memory loss,winding up in a hospital bed. The police look into the perps record and Reacher's. It seems the perp is an ex army sniper and Jack is an ex military MP,who has purposely dropped off Government radar. Just as the D.A. and lead detective are having a pow wow about their next move,in walks Reacher himself. The defense attorney appointed to defend the perp is there and she happens to be the D.A.'s daughter. She grabs Reacher right away and has a good talk to him about what they know so far about the case. Reacher reveals more of his military past and it seems he once tried to convict the perp of a deliberate killing of mercenary troops,but it didn't stick as evidence and witnesses were hushed up. Reacher told the perp if he ever got in any trouble back home,he would be there to see him taken down.
Reacher right away cottons on to some facts of the case that don't make sense,and he is convinced the perp is innocent. Reacher agrees to help the defense attorney and this leads them both on a long and complicated search for the truth. The identification of one person,leads to another higher up and so on. Reacher at one point attends a firing range many miles out of town run by an ex military man,who at first denies he had ever seen the perp. After a small test of firing skill by Reacher,the man retracts his denial of the perp and agrees to help Reacher when push comes to shove later.
Reacher's extensive nosing has finally uncovered the man behind the killings in the park. His name is Zec,a Russian who spent many years in the Gulag. He runs a construction conglomerate and it was his men that took out the people in the park,not the one arrested. In fact the other four people killed were collateral damage to mask the killing of just one woman who would not sell her business to him. Reacher,with the gun range owners help,zero's in on Zec and his men at a gravel pit. They have captured the defense lawyer and are holding her as bait for Reacher. Reacher takes them down one by one,including the lead detective in the case who was Zec's patsy,until he reaches Zec,sitting behind the lawyer. He has a few short words with Zec and ""ends"" the conversation abruptly. As the police sirens wail in the background signalling their imminent arrival,Reacher and the gun range owner leave the defense attorney to mop up the scene of carnage left behind.
The film finishes as the defense lawyer interviews the now innocent sniper. Though he does not recall the shooting,he still thinks he did it. He also believes Reacher will one day show up,as promised,to prosecute him,not knowing Reacher was there already and proved his innocence.
The film builds to a heightened tension rapidly and manages to generally keep it there throughout the film. There are some nail biting moments throughout with Reacher being involved in car chases,shootings and fights. The only criticisms I can make of this film is that there may be a bit too much attention to detail,as the film's 130 minute running length attests to. And the final ending of the gravel pit shootout,leaving the defense attorney to come up with some plausible explanation for all the dead bodies around,seems a bit of a stretch. Considering all that has come before it it seems far too convenient and an easy way out. I was surprised to see acting vet Robert Duvall in his small but nice role as the gun range owner.
Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. There are no extras.
All in all a surprisingly good thriller/whodunit,with Mr Cruise on top of his game. The film's length is a bit of a bother as is the over attention to detail,but generally speaking it satisfies,and that's what counts.",1368489600,,4395,4.6286811779769526

5507775,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Neither my husband or I have read the Jack Reacher books, so we watched this purely as a standalone action/mystery movie, and we enjoyed it. Cruise is riveting and believable as the aloof, intelligent Reacher with a mysterious past and semi-maniacal dedication to truth. The movie plot held our attention - it begins with a sniper picking off 5 people, seemingly at random, and leaving enough clues that he is quickly caught. However, as Reacher investigates, things become cloudier, and we aren't sure who is behind the shooting or why. The twists are revealed at the perfect pace - fast enough to keep you intrigued, but slow enough that you keep wondering if it's going to twist another direction. My only complaint - which is a common one for me - is the violence levels. I'm ok with a gritty story, and violence that is a necessary part of the plot, but some of if here just bugged me, such as the scene of a man trying to chew off his own fingers, or the one where a young woman is killed for knowing too much. Both could have been briefer and less graphic, and played the role they needed to in the overall plot. I assume they were part of the book(s) and they were trying to be true to this, but in my opinion it's time for Hollywood to ask some tough questions about the violence they portray and how they portray it, and to cut the details when it's an option. It's all gotten way to glamorized.",1368489600,,1405,4.407692307692308

5507778,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"...But if you have read Lee Child and you DO know who Jack Reacher is then this film is just ridiculous. I have admittedly been a fan of Lee Child and will likely continue to read his books but I will no longer recommend his work. This is perhaps the biggest sell out in the history of films adapted from books. It is understandable that the author gives up to the studio a certain amount of control over storyline, character development, etc but this has to be the biggest departure in history of a character developed over years and more than a dozen books. Jack Reacher is 6'-5"" tall, 220-250 lbs with a 50"" chest, which is nearly a full foot taller and 100 lbs heavier than the actor cast for this roll, Tom Cruise. More importantly though is the way that a guy this big carries himself and is perceived by others, something that is impossible for someone 5'-6"" to pull off. Reacher has massive hands and can kill someone with one punch which is something that is impossible to be portrayed by someone of Cruise's size.  Yes, this would be an okay film if the title was, ""Ethan Hunt"" or ""Mitch McDeere"" but as Jack Reacher it is a big loser. Oh, and not to beat a dead horse but I think that there is something very wrong when the local law enforcement person - who is typically a beautiful ""girl-next-door"" woman that Reacher ultimately sleeps with-is taller than Reacher himself. Yes, all you (former) Lee Child fans, the leading lady in this film, Rosamund Pike is 2-3"" taller than Cruise. Yeah, Child, that REALLY works in cementing that Reacher character that you spent so many years developing! Shame on you Lee Child for selling out.",1368489600,14,1644,4.516778523489933

After getting used to the fact that this was not the Jack Reacher I had read Lee Child's 17 books about, I was pleasantly surprised.  It's a big difference from 6'5"" x 250#  and Tom Cruise.  I was disappointed when Tom was cast for the lead.  But during the TV hype about the movie, I decided to see it as soon as it was available on Amazon. I actually wasn't expecting to like it.
I was pleased to see that they didn't shoot 'up' at him or give him a lot of boxes to stand on to make him look like Reacher.  They just let him be tough like Reacher.  I'm not a great Cruise fan but I actually liked him in this movie.  He's improved with age or maybe Reacher was a good vessel for him.  There were a couple of tremendous car chases.....does anybody learn that Reacher hates to drive, is a terrible driver and doesn't even have a driver's licence? New side of him, I guess.
I would and have recommended it.  Just don't read the books first.  I think I would have given it five stars if I hadn't.",1368489600,,1050,4.098039215686274

5507812,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Back in December 2012 when Jack Reacher was released I figured, ""why not read the book then watch the movie when it comes out on Blu Ray?"" The movie is actually based on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-Shot/dp/0345538196/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One Shot</a>, the 2005 9th book in Lee Child's series. One Shot was an excellent book, and I pictured a Tom Cruise-like character as Reacher knowing that I would soon be watching him in the role.

Cruise did a decent job with the portrayal of Reacher in the movie. He nailed the dialogue. However, Cruise would be a much smaller Reacher than that of the guy in the book who stands 6'5"" and in one chapter literally crushes a guy the size of Stallone in his bare hands. I actually noticed that they made Cruise seem as tall as some of his co-stars in several scenes, which made some of the CQC seem a bit more realistic.

Anyway, the movie was a very good adaptation of the book. Reacher is a rough, tough character with a military police background. Now ""retired"" and for the most part a drifter, Reacher seems to be as much of a military police expert as he is an expert in finding trouble and fixing it. However, now as an ""independent"", unlike the traditional methods used by police, Reacher--while extremely intelligent--prefers the methods of Rambo to exact his justice.

Jack Reacher learns that a guy that he used to be in the military with is accused of an atrocious crime. So Reacher makes his way to Pittsburgh (Indiana in the book)  to investigate. Turns out the guy accused of the atrocity asked the cops to ""find Reacher"" as one of the only statements after his arrest, because Reacher may be the only guy that could put doubt behind the accusation. This of course doesn't make Reacher any friends in the local police department who think that they have an air-tight case, and Reacher's presence certainly wouldn't sit well with anyone trying to frame the accused. Indeed, anyone trying to frame the accused might go out of their way to make life literally difficult for Reacher, but making life difficult for Jack Reacher is usually more hazardous to the health of the bad guy than it is to Reacher.

Just like the book that Jack Reacher was adapted from, actions and scenarios are extreme at times with some implausibilities, but the movie moves quickly and is well worth a rental for fans of the action/thriller/crime drama genres.",1368403200,,2442,4.874698795180723

  Overall, the film is pretty dull.  Whatever else you say about modern action films like the Matt Damon Bourne films or the recent James Bond movies, they have a lot of visual energy.

But it is quite obvious they put together a complete utter failure. This is certainly one of the worst movies Tom has ever been in or behind. Tom has been in much better projects that didn't come across one dimensional and painfully paced. I had three family members sitting down to watch this with me and all three decided it would be more fun to start the Bar-B-Q early and left me to wade in this movie muck.

I want to mention my favorite parts of this movie, first of all the car chase scene was top notch and somewhat realistic, then there was the fight scene in the rain at the mining site-- it had a very eerie realistic quality and I was drawn into the scene

USA
Director: Christopher McQuarrie
Writers: Christopher McQuarrie -screenplay, Lee Child
Stars: Tom Cruise, Rosamund Pike, Richard Jenkins, and Robert Duvall

Over the years I have read many novels.  Several I have seen the movies, and the characters were usually quite different from those cast to play the parts.  I know it can be disappointing if your an avid book enthusiast, but keep in mind what the movie makers must overcome to cast a movie.  Can they find an actor/actress that looks like the book character, and can that person act their way out of a paper bag? Will they do the novel justice with the screen play and acting?  Unfortunately book purest are rarely satisfied and may not even be willing to see the movie.  In this case, it's their loss.  When Tom Cruise started his career he may have been almost a pretty boy, but even then he could act his way out of a paper bag and then some.  He has always been able to take a character and make them flesh and blood.  So hence why I never miss seeing a Tom Cruise movie.  Cruise makes Jack Reacher believable, and someone you want on your side when the chips are down.  He may not look like the book character, but he ""is"" the movie character.  To me he made a retired military cop real, and the supporting cast were great too.  Even the short time Robert Duvall was given on screen, he made his part unforgettable.  That's what good actors and actresses do.

On a sunny day a sniper kills five people while they walk along side a river.  An ex-military sniper is taken into custody shortly after and will only say, ""Get Jack Reacher"".  Who is Jack Reacher?  A retired Army officer that has been off the grid for two years.  Out of the blue Jack Reacher walks in and says he is no friend of the sniper, and that he is there to bury him.  But when the sniper's attorney convinces Jack to look deeper.  Jack finds the case against the sniper is wrapped, tied with a bow, and just too plain neat for him to believe.  His suspicions are now aroused and if there was any doubt, someone is trying to stop his investigation by any means necessary including a frame up for a murder.  One of the reasons this movie is so great is the bad guys have some real depth to them along with being cold blooded their boss is scary.  If you're in the mood for a great crime thriller, I highly recommend you at least rent this one.  After seeing it I know I will want to revisit regularly, so I ended up buying it to add to my library.  I bought the Blu-ray and the picture and sound quality are excellent.  Beautiful camera work throughout is good reason alone, but there are many scenes that the added quality make it worth buying.  This is well worth adding to your video library.  Tom Cruise was so good in this part my hope is they will bring more of the books to the screen with him as Jack.

5507846,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"I can only review the first hour of ""Jack Reacher,"" not because of problems streaming the movie from Amazon, although the screen went blank twice during the first hour and I had to shut down and restart both times, but because the movie is pathetic. The writing style tries to imitate ""Dirty Harry,"" but falls short of even the worst Chuck Norris flick, as does the acting. At the end of the first hour Cruise and his co-star, Rosamund Pike, with newly exposed cleavage, are standing in a room looking out into the windows of the building next door at a bunch of people working at their desks. It's at that point that Cruise starts pontificating on the meaning of life and also the point where I had to turn the thing off. The movie, and Cruise, take themselves way too seriously and neither has the wit or the intelligence to pull it off. And, not to make fun of Cruise's height (5' 7""), but it's hard to take someone seriously who has to look up at all of the supporting actors, including the female lead (5' 9""). I'm a fan of most of Cruise's movies, but this one just doesn't cut it.",1368316800,2,1087,4.359605911330049
5507847,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Even though Tom Cruise may not meet the physical characteristics, he pulls off a very good Jack Reacher.  Though there have been a few changes from the book I was very satisfied with the whole movie.  I did not expect it to be funny, but it had some great one-liners too!",1368230400,,271,4.294117647058823
5507848,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"This is my kind of movie. realistic fight scenes, good plot, delivers on action and entertainment. very well worth your time.",1368230400,,125,5.0
5507849,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"First off, I am not familiar with the character or the book.  But if the book was created with a lot of bad dialogue in mind,  more than a hint of overacting, and a plot a five year old child could follow, then this movie hit the nail on the head!

I can not forgive the dialogue.  The writing for this film script was atrocious.  The actors from Cruise down were not remotely believable in any instance.  The evil doers reminded me of Dr. Evil from Austin Powers.  You remember that guy right?  (1,000,000 dollars...)  The fight scenes were not even remotely entertaining or enthralling.

I lamented over every aspect of this movie.  The only reason I gave it two stars is because while the movie was playing out I was able to bask in it's mediocrity as though I was a member of Mystery Science Theatre 3000.  (You might get that, you might not.)

Bottom line...this was not enjoyable.",1368230400,,886,4.4625
5507850,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"a good movie over all. worth the power to run the blu ray player.
a guy movie with a very good car chase in it. not a movie to see
10 times but that kind of movie is hard to find.",1368230400,,179,3.3902439024390243
5507851,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Let's face it: when fans of Lee Child's series think ""Jack Reacher,"" Tom Cruise is far from the first person they think of to portray him.  Reacher is basically a brick wall, a hulking genius who is unafraid to get down and dirty and do whatever it takes to win the fight--even if that means fighting dirty.  Tom Cruise is...well, Tom Cruise.

And yet, fans, listen up: Cruise nails it.  He knows how to nail that ""don't mess with me look,"" and has the off-the-cuff sense of humor that makes Reacher unpredictable.  In his (too few) fight scenes, he's brutal: the violence is surprisingly realistic (the opening scene is truly disturbing), and isn't glossed up or played down.  Some viewers may be unsettled.

And yet, something about the film just doesn't hold up to Cruise's performance.  The story is one of the series' better ones: five supposedly innocent civilians are killed, and the alleged perpetrator requests the help of his old nemesis, Jack Reacher, a former military cop who has become a drifter.  Reacher shows up, and lo and behold, things aren't exactly as they appear.  The supporting cast is solid; Rosamund Pike, who's had a spotty career (I can't see her and not immediately think of SURROGATES, unfortunately), is good, though she and Cruise don't have much chemistry; Werner Herzog and Jai Courtney, the two primary villains, are properly despicable (Herzog's The Zec deserves a hell of a lot more screen time); and Richard Jenkins and Robert Duvall are reliably great in their limited roles.

So where does JACK REACHER falter?  It's hard to say, but it seems to lose steam moving into the third act; granted, this is sometimes true of Child's novels, but the author usually manages to regain momentum.  The film, aside from a nice fight scene, does not.  And the abrupt ending, pretty much a staple of the series, doesn't really work on the screen.  There's nothing truly noteworthy about Christopher McQuarrie's directing or script, which is either a good thing or a bad thing, depending on how you look at it.  The movie is a solid, enjoyable action film, with doses of wry humor spread throughout.  Basically, if you've read the novels (this one's based on ONE SHOT; Child gives his novels some bland titles, but at least he's never simply named one JACK REACHER), you know what you're getting.  If you aren't a fan of the series, go out and read a couple; then give this movie a chance.  It's not great, but it's definitely better than most hack action films out there, and features Tom Cruise giving a commanding performance.",1368230400,,2555,4.792237442922374
5507852,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"It's such a shame as this could have been a great movie. Instead it was slow in many parts and not gripping or really that exciting. Could be the worst movie he has ever done.

After reading an interview with Lee Child about the movie, I set aside my skepticism that Tom Cruise could fill Jack Reacher's shoes. Lee Child said that Tom Cruise is such a good character actor that after 3 minutes watching the movie one would find him believable. Nope. The movie was all wrong, nothing like the books. I like  Cruise, but he was not at all believable as Reacher. I love the Reacher books and I have read every one of them.  and am looking forward to the next.",1368230400,,564,4.252336448598131

Wandering samurai in the bleak modern landscape, finds unjustly wronged man, uses clever understanding of human nature to pluck out truth from the strands of deception-where is Charlie Chan when you need him? Nah, it's a good story, the characters, Pike, Cruise, Herzog, esp. Herzog play their parts a little larger than life so that the characters assume the dimension of archetype. Pike is the damsel in distress- a by the rules DA who doesn't understand that not everyone plays by the rules, Cruise as The Man Who Knows, carefully studying the trail of events until it leads him to the culprit No One Sees. Herzog, though, exudes genuine evil, exhorting his minion to commit an unspeakable act upon himself and when the minion cannot muster the strength. Well. You know the rest. All in all a good romp with Robert Duvall, you cannot, you must not, forget Robert Duvall in a minor role. But darn, does he deliver those lines as if he is the character he plays.

I really can't stand the thought of Tom Cruise, why does Hollywood keep giving this psycho work when there are millions of capable starving actors out there?  Maybe because of roles like this. If you ignore his real-life insanity he is capable of throwing down a good performance. On par with the Mission Impossible franchise.  I hope this becomes its own franchise. We need new original works rather than remade crap. Seriously, Hollywood remade Hansel and Gretel and Little Red Riding Hood for Christ's sake. Though I think Jack Reacher was originally a book.

5507880,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"From someone who never read the book I was left scratching my head over several unanswered questions.

What was the former Russian prisoner's involvement in the corrupt corporation that was behind the murders?

How did the police detective become involved with the Russian's organization and why?

Where was the fall guy when the shootings took place?  I assume that he was drugged by the bad guys since there was a shot of his fingerprint being placed upon the quarter but why didn't he just explain this to the cops when he was being interrogated?

I understand that the subsequent beating that placed him into a coma erased his memory of the events surrounding the shooting but how could the bad guys have known that this would occur?

Was the fall guy actually knowingly involved in the shootings since he had been seen at the shooting range with one of the bad guys?

While I understand that the defense attorney was initially only concerned with trying to avoid the death penalty for her client, when confronted with Jack Reacher's theory as to why her client might be innocent wouldn't she have immediately grabbed onto it rather than complaining that it wasn't her job to find the real killer?  Maybe not, but isn't it part of the job of a good criminal defense attorney to try to prove that someone else could have committed the crime other than her client?  Isn't that a means of trying to present reasonable doubt to a jury?

Why would the former Russian prisoner's obviously proficient right-hand man wanted to put Jack Reacher out of commission, why did he allow the job to be outsourced to a meth dealer and some of the most inept stooges imaginable?

If this film was good enough I might watch it a second time just to find some answers to these questions but frankly it wasn't entertaining enough to warrant a second viewing.",1368144000,,1841,4.686335403726708
5507881,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Lee Child's Jack Reacher is one of my favorite characters in fiction. If you haven't read the series, go do so now. Child's writing is paced perfectly, absolutely enthralling, and none of his books are not without an aura of complete entertainment. This movie, on the other hand, is not really the Jack Reacher I know and love. Taken objectively, it's a decent movie, but taken as a Jack Reacher movie...eh. The acting is pretty awful, even Cruise seemed unable to pull off Reacher's short, terse sentences without sounding kind of ridiculous. The action was good, though the cameras on the hoods of cars during the chase scene seemed a little strange. The entire movie was a little strange, surreal almost. It wasn't Jack Reacher, but it was a decent enough action flick. But it has tons of problems that detract from it.",1368144000,,822,4.755244755244755

5507887,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"I have just finished the novel, One Shot, that the Jack Reacher movie is based on. Very loosely. I rented the movie from Red Box after reading the book. The Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child don't work very well on the big screen, was my first conclusion. This is, in part due to Tom Cruise casting himself as Jack Reacher. Now, if you enjoy Tom Cruise playing Tom Cruise, you will probably be satisfied with the movie.

I have read nearly all of the Lee Child novels featuring Jack Reacher. Reacher is an iconic protagonist. He is meticulously described early on in every novel as 6 foot 5 inches tall and around 250 lbs, blue eyes and sandy hair. He owns a toothbrush and that's about it. No car, no driver's license, no driving skills. A somewhat clumsy individual except when he is involved in hand to hand combat. He drifts around the country until he is caught up in some Knight Errant quest, whereupon he metes out his own brand of justice, which is always brutal.

No effort was made in the movie to pass off Cruise as the Reacher character in all his towering physical persona. O.K. I get that, but also missing from Cruises character is the steel trap calculating thought processes that Reacher exhibits as he tracks down the antagonists in the novels. That may have been beyond the capability of the screen writer and Cruise.

Some notes about the movie compared to the book. There is NO muscle car chase in the book, in fact there is no car chase at all in One Shot the novel that the movie is supposed to be based on. The Rosamund Pike character in the movie is not abducted in the book. There is no shoot out in a rainstorm at the end of the book as depicted in the movie. In fact, there is no shootout at all at the ending. And, the main antagonists do not meet the end that they do in the movie.

I was left wondering why they bothered to call the movie Jack Reacher or to mention that it was an adaptation of the novel, One Shot. They might just as easily called it Charlie Schwartz. No one would have known the difference.

I think the short cameo in the movie featuring Lee Child said it all. A shrug! The cameo showed Child seated in a police uniform. Good thing he wasn't standing. Lee Child (a pseudonym for the author Jim Grant) is 6 foot 5 inches and around 250 lbs. He would have towered over Tom Cruise. We can't have that in the movie, can we?

I sincerely hope they don't attempt to bring any more of these Reacher novels to the screen. At least not without someone believable in the part.",1368144000,,2516,4.319915254237288

Though he never appears to be 6'5"" and close to 250 lbs like the fictional Jack, the film is enjoyable as pure escapism.  There are touches of unexpected humor and lots of action.

There is a very awkward scene where he takes his shirt off to just show off his body. He continues to act very macho towards the defense attorney in numerous scenes and backs her into corners. The movie is about 15 minutes too long and has long segments that are very quiet with just 2 people talking. Mr. Cruise seemed to have been very tired towards the end of the filming of the movie. Towards the beginning he quickly put down 5 guys during a bar fight. Towards the end he was almost done in by just one guy, who was much sexier then Mr. Cruise by the way! We did watch the entire movie which is over 2 hours and enjoyed most of it. Mr. Cruise must of intentionally picked unknowns for the cast and then felt guilty and cast Robert Duvall for an excellent supporting role.

Great fighting sequence when he essentially wrecks a 5 on 1 against him.  He does all his own stunts, as usual, so that applies to this film.

Seriously, you want Tom Cruise or Edge? Hugh Jackman is probably the only one I would have liked in the role more the Cruise.

For the movie, I liked how everything was pieced together. Its fun watching Jack Reacher work, cause he is not your normal investigator. He just does things his way without a care in the world. This is a good investigation movie with excellent action sequences in-between. Reminded me of a mix between Bullitt and Get Carter (1971).",1368144000,,617,4.609090909090909
5507913,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"When they made the first Bond film, Ian Fleming wanted David Niven to play Bond. When he saw Sean Connery he called him a 'mumbling truck driver.' After Dr. No became a success, Ian had no problem with Connery. I only mention this so many people took umbrage over the casting of Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher.

That said, Jack Reacher is a damn good thriller. The production notes tell us Jack Reacher was filmed on 35 mm anamorphic format. In other words, old-school. No digital. No projection screens. The film has an early 70s vibe throughout and it's not hard to imagine Clint Eastwood or Steve McQueen playing this role had it been around. Cruise ratchets his performance up to an eleven (as usual). The music is filled with nobility and the direction leaves you with no doubt you're watching a western played out in modern times. I liked the fact the film is devoid of the rapid-fire digital editing we've come to associate with the genre. I hesitate to call it an action film. Jack Reacher is more of a steady-paced thriller. I read a review somewhere that said most films today go to great lengths to hide the fact the actor is not doing his stunts but not Jack Reacher. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the car chase where the camera zooms into the car several times to show us that yes indeed, that is Tom Cruise doing his own stunts.

Another thing worth mentioning is the character of Reacher is completely unsentimental and never second-guesses himself. As much as I enjoyed 'Skyfall,' it's refreshing to see a character who's not wracked with guilt. The next Bond film will have Bond on a therapist's couch. Seriously, Reacher is blunt, direct and remorseless. It's refreshing.

Jack Reacher is well worth an evening's viewing.

I hope they do Bad Luck and Trouble next. Here's my fantasy casting;

Calvin Franz: Ed Norton. (What a great cameo.)
Frances Neagley: Jennifer Garner.
Stan Lowrey: Ben Affleck.
Dave O'Donnell: Brad Pitt.
Karla Dixon: No clue. Maybe Angelina Jolie.

After that, do 61 Hours and so on.

That's just my two cents.

In this flick, you get to see the street cred/ghetto low tech Cruise,- lean, dirty, in jeans, and ready for trouble.
And in T-Cruise films, they are always careful to have Tom as the prettiest face in the movie, and in this flick its no different.
Chosen as his co-star is Rosamund Pike, who was excellent a few years ago as the sweet eldest sister in ""Pride and Prejudice"".. And this time she's on board to fulfill the movie's subtext as his girl whom he never kisses tho she wishes he would.
They have good chemistry onscreen as she portrays the educated upper class in the movie which plays in balance perfectly against Cruise's finest choreographed  ass kicking role since ""The Last Samurai"".
This 3.5+ star movie and recent 4 star ""Oblivion"" are proof that Cruise should remain at the top of the pack.

If anyone reads the Jack Reacher novels, they would know that an integral part of the books, of every book, of every plot is the immense size of Reacher, that he always says that he isn't swift of foot, but perserveres with his assailants due to his size, weight and muscle.  To have a teeny tiny like Tom Cruise take on the role negates the whole image of Jack Reacher.
I bet Cruise put up his money to make this film, otherwise who would have bankrolled it with a star who is so completely different physically than the Reacher in the book?  Did Lee Child have a say so in who could play Reacher?",1368057600,2,646,4.278688524590164

One review, although a very good review, said Cruise was short, something about his nose, and his personal life. Well, lets see?  First he was getting a 100 million a film for how many years?  Every film was a huge hit and allowed him to make that kind of money. Yes his love for his now ex or soon to be ex Katy seem to be his undoing a bit. I for one could care less if he jumps up and down on Opera's couch and declares his love for his woman.  I would have.  Who cares?  This movie has nothing to do with his looks or his personal life.  I did not read the book, nor do I care to. I watched this movie cause I wanted to see Tom Cruise play something different.  It was not a 100 million dollars in special effects, explosions and crazy car scenes.  It was just Tom on screen most of the time, good plot, the chemistry between Cruise and the District Lawyer was great. But not over the top.  No sex scenes, no romance for the sake of having it. They had humor on and off through the whole movie which was perfectly timed and it made me laugh.  I thought Tom's personality for this character was spot on.  His dry humor was also just spot on.  And I loved the fact that they added Robert Duvall even though it was a small part, but still a part that was needed and he came in towards the end and did a great job. A side note, Cruise and Duvall paired up for Days of Thunder, where on David Letterman (I think?) Robert Duvall said Tom Cruise was the most generous man he had ever met in his life. This was just after the making of the very cheap and awful Godfather III.  The two had great chemistry together on film then and I cant believe it has taken them this long to work together again. This was a good thriller, good plot, great acting and most of all it was believable. Nothing that made you think ""oh special effects"", or ""no way that could happen"".  It was just Tom Cruise in a jacket, pair of jeans, on a mission to do what he thought was the right thing. A good conspiracy theory, and great action.  I loved the fight scenes.  Nothing over the top with flips and crazy stuff.  It's all stuff with training in the MMA Gym most can do. With a ton of practice of course.  It was just good fun and I was entertained the entire time. And I just felt it ended to quick. I would love a sequel.  If you like Tom Cruise I think you must see it.  I think its funny that some people talked about how he looked.  This guy got best looking man alive a few times.  Gee?  I wish I looked that bad with the girls....lol  lol  Watch the movie and enjoy....",1368057600,,2680,4.0494296577946765
5507918,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"""Jack Reacher,"" based on Lee Child's popular seies of novels, stars Tom Cruise in the title role of a mysterious military investigator who looks into the murder of several civilians by a skilled sharpshooter. Reacher is a loner who solves crimes because he avoids falling into conventional thinking.  Having spent years as an Army cop, he now keeps a low profile, traveling under aliases and operating on instinct.  He knows the law often fails to provide justice, so he dedicates himself to getting that justice.

Because Reacher has a photographic memory, it's tough for those he's pursuing to hide.  An occasional remark made days or even years ago remains fresh in his memory.

In the novels, Reacher is 6' 4"", a far cry from Cruise's stature, but his Reacher does an effective job conveying a self-confident swagger and handling himself more than competently when danger encroaches.  Cruise draws upon earlier action flick performances, so the viewer is familiar with the formula.  Under Christopher McQuarrie's direction, the movie offers lots of action, though the middle sags a bit.  Rosamund Pike co-stars as defense attorney and love interest Helen Rodin, David Oyelowo portrays a tough, confident detective, and Werner Herzog is a solid bad guy.

The two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack contains commentary by Tom Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie and three behind-the-scenes featurettes.",1368057600,,1403,5.3122171945701355

5507920,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"We just rented this movie and I was very impressed with the storyline. My wife has read all the Lee Child books and she didn't like the movie because she couldn't get over the fact that Tom Cruise wasn't the same height as the character in the book. I have read the first one and could very easily get over this.

When I watch a movie, one of my main requirements will be if the movie is entertaining. This movie was very entertaining. The characters were very believable and I was more impressed by the imperfections that were allowed in the characters rather than how perfect they were.  The women weren't perfect 10s and the men weren't all hunks. They came across as real.

Cruse plays this part to perfection. I admire him for his ability to maintain his level of physical fitness for so many years. He is not that much younger than me and I have never seen him less than a perfect specimen. I know he probably has a team of servants to assist him in that and he has to pay for it, but his reward is years of employment as a leading man. His ability to play a character who can master hand to hand combat, which is used in this movie multiple times, is very believable.

Robert Duvall rounds out the superstar cast as an old retired gunny running a rifle range. He is great in the movie and its easy to see why he is one of the best character actors in history.

Overall a very good movie. Not a family movie mind you, but a good action packed adventure that is going to set Cruise up for for 2 or 3 more sequels to go along with all the other sequels he keeps going like a wizard.

In this era of the movie industry, there seems to be a great emphasis on horror movies. I guess they are cheap to make and you get inexpensive actors to play the parts. Movies like Jack Reacher don't come along everyday and I am very happy that this character gets to come to life and give me a couple hours of entertainment.",1368057600,10,1913,4.198910081743869

It did not cross my mind once during the film that he was ""not tall enough"" or whatever else people have complained about.

The mystery/suspense aspect was very well done and refreshing for a genre which is too-often deadly predictable and demands you check your brain at the door for 2 1/2 hours. The bits of humor throughout were a nice counterpoint to the violence (which is more implied than gory).

And I've seen more than my fair share of authors sell out to get their first book into film... It's really a shame because anyone who has ever read any of the Reacher books was dying to see them made into film.  The plots were literally written like screen plays to begin with.  But no matter how hard I try to like this movie, I just can't see Tom Cruise as the 6'4""/250lb guy with ham steaks for hands.  What made Reacher so improbably was that a guy that big could HIDE IN PLAIN SITE.  Women were typically terrified of him, because he always looked like a bum.  He found himself in all sorts of ridiculous situations and still managed to literally punch his way out.  And he killed really bad people with a certain relish that one wishes could be deposited on all really bad people... The rest of the cast does a fair job.  So does Cruise. But Cruise is so well-known for being ""Cruise"" he just ruins the role -- and no hard feelings for the effort...  This wasn't Tom Cruise's fault.  Lee Child should be embarrassed that he was willing to sell himself that cheap just to get into film.  Lee:  Next time, find an actor who can at least play the role as you wrote it!

5507925,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"There seems to be two camps of response to this film: those who have read the novel `One Shot' by Lee Child and have trouble with the casting and those who come to the film without knowledge of the `character Jack Reacher. Not having read the book this viewer found the film intensely engrossing, full of smart dialogue form writer/director Christopher McQuarrie, and a finely tuned cast of actors who get the opportunity to strut their stuff in this story that seems far shorter than the 130 minutes of the film. Tom Cruise may be short in stature at 5'7"" but at age 50 he is in fine shape, performs all his own car stunts (which are excellent and harrowing), and at least for the novice he does `become' Jack Reacher.

Briefly, the setting is Pittsburgh, PA and a professional sniper (an exceptionally fine Jai Courtney) shoots dead five seemingly random people. The police quickly capture on James Barr (Joseph Sikora), arrest him, interrogate him (by DA Richard Jenkins and his cohort David Oyelowo and the DA's lawyer daughter Rosamund Pike who seeks to give Barr a fair trial): Barr declares his innocence and his answer to his question of is he guilty is his writing `Get Jack Reacher'. Barr is beaten unconscious in a van on the way to jail and is comatose.  Jack Reacher, ex-military investigator, (Tom Cruise) who despises Jack Barr from their shared military history appears and the action begins. Reacher is only too willing believe that Barr did the crime he's accused of. But when Local criminals try to take out Reacher, he decides to give the case a second look. Soon he's unraveling a much deeper conspiracy.

In addition to the actors mention, there are several excellent cameos by Werner Herzog as a Russian ex-prisoner who knows about survival (he chewed of his own fingers while I prison to ward off gangrene from frost bite), Alexia Fast, Josh Helman, Vladimir Sizov, and Robert Duvall. The story is rich in innuendoes, insights into corporate greed and threats form outside sources to take over the country, and some serious chases both by car and on foot.  The brilliant cinematography is by Caleb Deschanel and the atmosphere is greatly enhanced by the musical score by Joe Kraemer.  But this is a Tom Cruise special and he proves he can still rule the roost as one of the top action heroes in the business. For this genre, this is a fine entertainment.

5507930,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"When I heard the much maligned news that Tom Cruise had been cast as Jack Reacher, I vomited a little in my mouth. Seriously? Cruise is talented and versatile, but it was just playing him way against type. Didn't see it at the theater out of protest. Rented it, and now, I need to be honest and eat my words. Cruise is not Lee Child's Jack Reacher, but he is a version of Jack Reacher that worked. I hadn't read the book One Shot (upon which the movie was based) for several years, but the movie brought it all back. And that was very, very wise of the screenwriters. They kept to the script, and Cruise hit all the right notes. The brutal fighting style was a stroke of genius. It was antiHollywood, and all the better for it. I still feel like ten other actors would have been better for the part, but it made for a very entertaining movie.",1367884800,,842,4.236024844720497

Cruise plays the role believably enough but I felt something was missing from the film.  I was not familiar with the Reacher character and books that this is based but I really felt that for those like me who didn't know the background, some more character exploration would have really done the story more justice.

The movie is entertaining enough and keeps you interested until the end, but the plot seems to have left some good character development, including the villain in the movie, on the cutting room floor.

Nevertheless, the movie is good but definitely not Cruise's best, not by his effort in playing the character, but by the lack of development in the character itself.

While it wasn't too difficult to figure out most of what was going on, and it doesn't try to hide much, it was fun to see how the characters interacted to get to the bottom of the mystery nonetheless.

5507936,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Earlier in 2012 and for whatever reason, Tom Cruise decided a singing role in The Rock of Ages would be a smart role for his borderline flailing career.  Hopefully, Cruise learned a lesson that an un-relatable character, like Stacee Jaxx, was always going to be pitiful to watch, even if he did star in the massively successful Mission: Impossible sequel just a few months prior.  What's the point here?  A typical Tom Cruise film is either incredibly good or horribly bad.  Despite his reputation outside the world of film, Cruise is still a reputable actor - and if he'd stick to a certain genre of film, he might even be able to revitalize his career to its previous prominence.  Clearly, he's at his best in action flicks, and even might be able to sell himself in a comedy role (Tropic Thunder), but outside of those roles, it's difficult to take him seriously right now.  Sure, within the last ten years he's starred in a few intriguing dramas, like The Last Samurai or Collateral - but since Collateral (despite his box office success stories), Cruise has gone stale.  Could Jack Reacher be a career difference maker?

Directed by Christopher McQuarrie (The Way of the Gun), Jack Reacher stars Tom Cruise as a former military police officer, named Jack Reacher.  Now a drifter, Reacher arrives in Pittsburgh after former military sniper, James Barr (Joseph Sikora) allegedly kills five people outside a sports stadium - someone Reacher has already investigated in the past.  However, as much as Reacher would like Barr to be guilty, he discovers not everything is as it seems and takes it upon himself to investigate these murders that the District Attorney, Alex Rodin (Richard Jenkins) believes are worthy of the death penalty.  At the same time, Rodin's daughter and defense attorney, Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike), agrees to defend Barr and assist Reacher to try to save Barr from the death penalty.  Robert Duvall, David Oyelowo, Werner Herzog, and Jai Courtney also star in supporting roles.

Much like the Jason Bourne character for the Bourne novels, Jack Reacher also originates from a series of novels - created by author Lee Child.  Jason Bourne and Jack Reacher are very similar characters, not so much because of their origin (even though they are both officers), but because they are two incredibly powerful individuals (mentally and physically) that you wouldn't really want to mess with.  Unfortunately, unless you're digging into their past, characters of this nature are only interesting to an extent.  Jack Reacher is well-trained in combat and weaponry, so yeah - he's a total badass.  But, what fun is it to watch one guy constantly succeed at everything?  He takes down five guys with no problem (not to mention he does it with a Spider-Man-like banter), hits a bullseye with a sniper rifle like it's no big deal, and is basically smarter than everyone else (especially the police and a District Attorney).  As an introduction to the Jack Reacher character, this film does a fine job of putting him on the map.  In future films, though, he needs to be more flawed, a bit more open to emotion, and have a better villain trying to kill him - otherwise nothing sets him apart from established characters, like Jason Bourne, James Bond, Agent 47 (Hitman), or Rambo.

As far as Tom Cruise goes, he does his usual ""thing"" with the starring role in Jack Reacher.  The description of the Reacher character in the novels is a tall, overpowering man.  Obviously, Cruise doesn't really fit that description - but it doesn't hurt the film that he's not the perfect character actor for Jack Reacher.  Cruise is easily believable as this smart, athletic drifter that mysteriously outshines everyone else around him.  He's not an ego driven character, yet he's driven none-the-less.  In any event, the spotlight is on Tom Cruise for the duration of the film, briefly allowing newcomer Jai Courtney to spread his wings as the villainous henchman, Charlie.  Speaking of Charlie, his boss, a Russian businessman known only as The Zec, is supposed to be the ""big bad"" of the film, yet the character is weakly written and without an overpowering motive for his villainy.

The underlying question is:  is Jack Reacher worth watching?  The quick answer is yes, but it comes with strings attached.  If you combined films, like Shooter, Rambo, or any other ""frame job"" film, you can already say you've seen Jack Reacher.  However, you can make that quick judgment about most every film these days.  Jack Reacher is a new, mysterious character that walks around with a great deal of baggage - and he's an honest, charismatic character with personal qualities to be admired.  In the end, this film creates more questions than it provides answers, which means there better be a few more sequels, otherwise this film will fail to stand apart from the pre-mentioned titles in the future.

5507937,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I questioned why I was even watching the movie, but then it came along quite nicely.  I don't want to give too much away, but there's suspense, mystery, and action.  If you enjoyed Tom Cruise in the Mission Impossible movies, you should enjoy this.",1367884800,,248,4.613636363636363
5507938,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Prior to watching this movie, I had already read every one of Lee Childs' Reacher books and his Reacher short stories, and both Diane Capri's Reacher novels, and even Michael Kerr's ""Reacher kind of guy"" novel --and loved them all. . . So I came at this movie with high expectations.

With all that out of the way. I really enjoyed this movie! I think it is a good, solidly entertaining, action movie. If you watch it, you will enjoy it. I strongly recommend it!

Frankly, it starts off just a bit slowly, but after the first action scene, the movie picks up and never really lets down.

The plot is not very complex, but not too skimpy either. It has suspense, movement, shooting, chases, intrigue confusion and even fun. Reacher is not all chase scenes and shoot ups, it has some interesting plot twists, but it is not going to leave you wondering what is going on either. The movie is a nice bit of escape from the day-to-day. It is a good choice.

Also, Tom Cruz, Robert Duval, Rosamund Pike and the entire cast are very good. They move the movie along and keep us interested in the developments --it's well acted and in one sense they are stronger than the script! The city and county background are well chosen and complement the story.

As a Jack Reacher fan, my only disappointment was that Tom Cruz, as good as he was, was not the ""real"" Reacher to me.  OK, I am not complaining about his height --even though Reacher is supposed to be a mountain of a man, who stands out in spite of himself -and make an impressive, if not intimidating, figure.  No, it's not his height, but there is something a bit perky, not jaded enough, socially too quick, or too upbeat and clever about Tom Cruz's approach that is just not quite Reacher.

Don't get me wrong, Tom Cruz delivers some of the ""Reacher mannerisms"" very crisply and nicely. He also has some of Reacher's speech and manner. Perhaps I just can't see Reacher as a handsome superstar. . .

Also, in the novels, Reacher's smarts are deep, quiet and homegrown. But they also are sharply honed by his experiences. He uses and expresses his savvy skills in a subtle manner (when he's not pummeling or shooting someone that is).  In this movie, however,  Reacher gets into a ""can you top this"" or ""stump the chump"" back-and-forth with the detective in a peculiar way. Also, Reacher  would not get hit by surprise from behind quite like he does that one time in the movie (sorry, in case you did not want to know ;-).

So for me, things like that distanced Tom Cruz from my Reacher image a bit. However, Tom Cruz does makes his Reacher quite interesting, very exciting and always appealing none the less. I was watching and enjoying every scene.

And that's the point: Even as a ""Reacher Fan,"" I was pulled quickly out of the ""book-and-character-comparison"" mode and dropped right into the ""let's see how he gets out of this"" mode."" And that's enough!

In short, a good movie  :-)",1367798400,6,2931,4.512287334593573

5507958,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"Though I'll admit I have not read the book(s), my judgement on the film and the final two star rating has to do with the film as it stands on it's own merits rather than an adaptation from a book. The film starts off extremely well, utilizing some slick film making for the opening sequence. Though this segment might be accused of borrowing some ideas from the opening sniper sequence from Dirt Harry, it's done extremely well and it get's you hooked to the core. The audience is treated to a senseless act of horrible murder on what appears to be just random people who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Perhaps a crazed gun nut just picking off anyone he so desires for the thrill of it. It's giving the audience something to hope for. I was thinking ""Yep this is gonna be on great flick, if it keeps up the momentum"".

It's an excellent opening and it's done with expert creative technique. Having seen the trailer before hand, it gives the impression that this is likely to be not just one hell of a ride, but also a slick rendering of a solid action movie. The kind you often hope for but only comes along once in a great while. But as the characters are introduced and the plot begins to unfold, it begins to slow down a bit, then walks it's self into the territory of interesting investigative detective story. Searching for answers. ""Who is Jack Reacher?"", ""Why these random murders?"" ""Who's in on it?"" ""Can we trust Reacher and how exactly does he fit in with all this?"" It sets the tone and get's things set to the proper pitch. It leaves you wondering what might happen next when things really get moving. But sadly it starts it's engines here and there but never really get's moving.

By that time Reacher teams up with a determined defense attorney to solve the crime, and this continues for a good 30 minutes before there is any further action at all, the first of which is a fight sequence, and one pretty typical of the usual macho B movie, or perhaps maybe with some stylish rendering less likely seen, but more usually not all that much endearing or worth remembering.
This fight sequence is short and to the point, and then from there on there is roughly yet another half hour of different characters investigating the evidence to determine what the motive was.

So an hour into the film, almost half way through, there are two short typical moments with some action along with a lot of crime investigation sequences we've seen a million times in films and television. And in this case it plays like the kind we've all seen beatin' to death over and over again. Just about an hour and 10 minutes into the film there is a short and not particularly memorable car chase. Most chase sequences I've seen are a lot more energetic and exciting. It feels like it needs to be there and it seems to maybe be finally giving the audience what they paid for. But it's short lived and again not much worth remembering.

Cruise plays this character with a reasonable style, along with a typical script, and it's simply by the numbers. It's also a typical performance and one that doesn't leave you really enjoying his acting even if it is right on key. By the 90 minute mark I was begining to tire of the film as it continued on it's very typical crime story pathway. The entire thing plays out almost like a slightly more polished episode of CSI or something. One reviewer here referenced Charley Varrick citing some simularities he felt existed in this film that wer ein tha one. CHarley Varrick is an underrated yet very well made crime story helmed by Dirty Harry director Don Siegel. I kept carefully looking this film over and couldn't make even the slightest connection to that film at all with anything in this movie. By chance though you might enjoy Charley Varrick, it's a classic, stylish and pretty gritty 70's heist movie starring Walter Matthau, Andy Robinson, who played Scorpio in Dirty Harry, and Joe Don Baker(Walking Tall(1973) (Cape Fear), excellent here as a mob hit man. It's definately a much better movie than this one, but then movies back then were often a lot better than ones made today, Even though Charley Varrick was not a major box office draw.

Jack Reacher ended for me by the 100 minute mark. I shut it off. And I must tell you I purchased the HD version here for $14.99. Even though I paid full price for it I simply could not keep going. I ""walked out"" so to speak. So is it a bad movie? Not at all. It's well acted, still somewhat interesting, but I think to some degree the trailer ruined it for me. I'm not one of those that has to have action in order to enjoy a movie. I like films of all kinds, and am perfectly content with a solid drama with no sex, violence or language. This film simply plays out with a plot that I'm tired of seeing and doesn't have anything new to say. On top of it there isn't very much action for the majority of the film. It's pretty much mostly dialogue and not particularly interesting dialogue at that. One thing for certain, the trailer is misleading. It makes one believe this is going to be a well oiled action flick, and if you are one who is searcing this out for that reason you are likely to be painfully dissapointed.

On the other hand if you prefer a typical crime investigation story you should enjoy this one, but I doubt even these individuals will come out of this one with much of anything worth noting or remembering.",1367625600,,5428,4.46122860020141

5507971,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"(This review is biased by my long-standing admiration for Lee Child's writing and the character of Jack Reacher, as portrayed in the books.)

No way does Tom Cruise carry the role of Reacher. I think there was one, 5-second spot in the whole movie, when I thought, yes, that might have been a Reacher expression. Apart from that... no.

I cannot believe that anyone who has read the books could ever have thought that Tom Cruise could take this role. Reacher's physical presence is as important as his intelligence, character, and anything else.

Lee Child himself would have been better cast in the role. He's the only ""actor"" who shines in this entire movie (he has a small cameo role). And as for Ms. Pike's chest... really???? Wouldn't a T-shirt have fitted the role better?",1367366400,7,778,4.7481481481481485

Reacher, for those of you who haven't read the book series, is a very imposing figure who used both his wits and over-the-top physical strength to survive and thrive as a military cop and as a civilian who just can't avoid trouble and can't resist helping people in dire need.  Cruise, on the other hand, is frankly a little delicate to be believable in the role.  The movie, overall, was pretty good as a typical action/adventure exercise and, aside from my not liking the casting, Cruise did a great job given his physical limitations.",1367366400,2,761,4.706766917293233

Cruise stretches his typical character where he is a supra-capable but reluctant do-gooder who uses humor in stressful situations by adding a much darker side and less forgiving quality to the protagonist.

I was very pleasantly surprised. Jack is a powerful man trying to do the right thing, and he doesn't care about the rules. There's a basic flaw in that philosophy which the movie doesn't address, and that's probably part of why the reviews weren't great. In addition, the supporting characters, with the exception of the female lead, were pretty straightforward, and the relationships not very complex, either.
Here's my Achilles heel: I like to win easy. My favorite games are ones in which my team wins in a blowout, and I hate losing like poison. I like Ocean's 11 and 13 because they portray a bunch of guys who never lose even the little battles, and win in straight sets.

Cruise is great at what he does: he makes a quality action movie with subtle humor and not riddled with profanity (the ever increasing popular stuff where 95% of English dialog is replaced with F*** or mind-numbing slang).  It's one of my few reliefs in moviedom that someone out there is still producing movies like this.  Again, it's not a deep flick, but it has a decent plot that doesn't totally insult your intelligence, and the hero is still a hero.  He kills bad guys and has self-control: he doesn't have to sleep with everything that crawls across the screen.  And, this is a movie that I can actually allow my kids to see without having to fast forward the majority of the scenes due to nudity or horrifying content (the closest thing to nudity is a rear shot of a woman in a thong, but for the faint-hearted in these matters, it is a mere flash).  Perhaps the highest point for me is that the hero actually cares that justice is executed (albeit in his own hands), unlike so many who make a mockery of justice by waffling in doubt about perpetrators to the degree that the perps in the end rule the ""justice"" system.  Every now and then the wild west style of justice is awfully refreshing.  Kudos, Cruise and company!",1367107200,5,1422,4.4517374517374515

5507998,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"This is the movie equivalent of an airport novel that keeps you turning the pages and you enjoy every second until the end. The film uses the airport novel tactic of building tense scenarios and then moving everything around every few minutes to keep the story fresh. Of course, after you know the whole story it doesn't play backwards particularly well since it seems like an overly-complicated plot after you've seen the twists and turns.

Jack Reacher is an interesting if one-dimensional hero who comes out of nowhere, acts outsides the boundaries of the law and uses his near-supernatural intelligence to separate the good guys from the bad. Still, with Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects) directing, it's tightly paced and keeps the action moving so you'll rarely stop to notice some of the craziness of what's happening. Cruise is quite good as always although he can practically phone in the performance on this one. The main villain is somewhat weak cinematically but fortunately he doesn't have enough screen time for us to question his believability for too long

No doubt it's made enough money to guarantee that the rest of the original novels will get turned into a franchise. It's not as exciting as the Bourne series but definitely well made and easy to watch.",1366848000,5,1283,4.962790697674419

This is set in the same state as those school shootings and opened in the same week. The film suffered as a result of that tragedy at the North American box-office. The film opens on a disturbing scene of a sniper supposedly shooting innocent bystanders? The film goes into different perspectives of that opening set-piece in the movie as clues are being fed to the audience. The film is shot with interesting camera angles that photographically draws the audience into the narrative.

Tom Cruise was unjustly criticized for taking this role as he bares little resemblance to Lee Childs character as written in the books. Tom Cruise convinces with his acting ability and the fight scenes are extremely believable. Tom Cruise is an effective actor and carries the role well.

My only problem was Werner Herzog as the villian. Herzog has screen presence but has an extremely underwritten role.
A lot of the villians in Tom Cruise movies the villian is underdeveloped, from THE MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE films, and with Jack Reacher. I've always thought if a film has a well-developed, overwhelming villian the hero comes off looking better and more heroic.

Cruise is a decent enough actor and well suited for the genre, but the plot seemed derivative and overly pedantic, just another flick I'd catch because...well...I'm a dude and the preview mentioned something about guns and explosives.

Surprisingly, the plot played out steadily, not needing to be propped up by a few well placed action sequences. While, if you've seen any movie ever in your life, you'll be able to predict what's going to ultimately happen, ""Reacher"" maintains a consistent level of intrigue and charm through the whole length of the film. I appreciated that the action scenes actually added to the plot. I was expecting some random ""Look how awesome I am at fighting"" scenes tossed into the mix, and was happy to see that while those scenes are absolutely in there, they also help move the plot forward. Good thinking, action-movie-maker-people (pretty sure that's the correct technical job title, but don't quote me on that...)

It has a story that engages the mind without being taxing on the brain.  The acting is good, with crisp dialogue and has some good old-fashioned tough-guy lines from the title character.  If I had to make this movie using ingredients from other sources, I'd say there's a good helping of ""Bullitt"" with a hint of ""Person of Interest"" and a little of ""Dirty Harry"" even.  The cinematography is clean, clear, and colorful, with good, steady fight scenes that you can actually tell what's going on.  None of it is predictable and it's all classy.  Good pace, sweet cars, pretty girls, great character.  I left the theatre feeling good, walking a little taller and already certain I'd buy the DVD.  Can't wait.",1363564800,10,1212,4.691943127962086

5508018,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Tom Cruise is a big star, but there are also tons of people who hate him and will not review his movie fairly because they do not like him as a person, they do not seperate him from the character he plays. Both my husband and I have read on the Lee Childs books and are huge fans and were so excited when this movie came out. It had a great twist and the fact that it did not have the traditional sex scene was a bonus. It was all action all the time. As far as the character, no Tom may have not been the perfect choice, as he is on the smaller less intimidating side, but he did a good job. I do hope that they make another one, because there is so much action in Child's books! I saw it twice in the theater and preordered the bonus edition for the behind the scenes",1363478400,,769,3.9044585987261144
5508019,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"When Tom Cruise was given the role of Jack Reacher by Child himself many fans flipped the frying pan complaining that his height, build, etc was entirely wrong for the character and, I get that. However similar to a movie called ""Thor"" (2011) you can't just cast someone with muscle, blonde hair, etc and say that is doing the material justice. The same goes with Jack Reacher sure Tom isn't even 6 feet tall but,can he act? You better believe he can and not only can he act, he always delivers his characters story even if some of his films aren't that great. So now that you know where I stand (I feel Cruise was miscast but I to would have cast him because well I'd rather see talent behind an important character then have someone just for show). To the review the film in short, well directed, beautifully acted, with a smart screen play from a beloved novel. Do yourself a favor, watch this!

5508021,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"Yep.  If you buy the rights to three movies, you get to ""act"" the part.  Hopefully, with over 15 pretty good Jack Reacher novels, after Tom Cruise slaughters these first three, we'll get to see Ray Stevenson, or some actor near the stature, demeanor, and disposition, try Jack Reacher before they get too old.  If nothing else, let Lee Child (the author) play the part.  This could end up like Akira Kurosawa/Toshiro Mifuni with ""The Seven Samauri"" and ""Yojimbo"", and Sergio Leone/Clint Eastwood doing European/International western renditions of Kurosawa's samurai classics.  Some of us just want to see our true warrior/samurai, as written and captured nicely by Lee Child.  He's big, powerful, tough, rough around the edges, has his own code of justice, smart, doesn't take ""no"" for an answer, and will ultimately destroy evil.  With a good production team and a well cast actor, this Jack Reacher series could provide Oscar material, or at least provide our next generation John Wayne/Ward Bond/James Arness/Clint Eastwood.  Unfortunately, Tom Cruise can never do this part justice without the physical stature and temperament for the job.  Nice try, but we need the ""classic"" team.

I knew nothing about Jack Reacher previous to the movie so I didn't know that Tom didn't fit the profile... it doesn't even matter because he was GREAT as the character.  It's an excellent movie... believable action scenes, lots of twists and turns... laced with some funny stuff, too!  Good plot.  Highly recommended that you see it.  I'm looking forward to seeing it again and owning it!

10/10/2015: I recently re-watched this movie.  I STILL think Tom did an excellent job!  I enjoyed the movie just as much or more than the first time I watched it!",1362787200,4,689,4.536585365853658
5508023,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Let me preface my review by saying that I am a HUGE fan of Lee Child's books and I am FULLY AWARE that Reacher is supposed to be a hulking figure of a man, 6'5, 240 pounds blah blah blah and Tom Cruise isn't even 5'6 (maybe). Now for you to be put off of a movie because x doesn't look like y, then there probably are very FEW movies you actually like based off of novels because nothing is ever the exact same as they are in the book. Since the dawn of cinema...when has it?

Anyway, the movie was really good and Cruise did a great job as Reacher. He wasn't very physically imposing of course, but he carried himself as a guy you absolutely do not want to mess with which is how Reacher comes across in the Child books. The fight scenes were well cheoreographed and made to look realistic and gritty, which worked well with the film, and the plot of the movie was translated very well from the book with some omissions which I'm sure will ruin the movie for all you close-minded perfectionists out there.

Jack Reacher was a fun movie and as a fan of the book, I approve Cruise as Reacher and would hope to see him in the role again being that my ideal actor to play Reacher, Val Kilmer, has grown content in his direct-to-dvd movies and eating until he resembles a tub of goo. I'll be getting the movie when it comes out, it's a good addition to any action fans collection.",1362528000,11,1376,4.208333333333333
5508024,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"Back in 1962, a movie called 'Dr. No' came out, with the main character being played by Sean Connery. This film was based on a book about a spy named James Bond (maybe you've heard of him). Most people define their image of James Bond as Sean Connery. The two are inseperable. Sean was NOT the choice of author Ian Fleming, however. He described Bond as looking more like David Niven (the literary Bond also has a scar on his face). Ever since then (and probably even before that) films have been made from the source material of novels, with casting that might not quite match up. This is nothing new. A few years back (once again with 007) everyone ranted and complained that Daniel Craig couldn't possibly play the part because he had blond hair. At first I was included in this bunch. But you know what? Daniel Craig gave 110% and knocked it out of the park with 'Casino Royale', and people loved it, myself included. Even more recently, 'Drive' was adapted with great success, with large stylistic changes from the book.

So now, people are complaining because Tom Cruise isn't a 6' 5"" blond guy like Jack Reacher is. I don't know for sure, but my guess is that the casting doesn't happen the way a lot of people think. My guess is that Tom Cruise was made aware of the project somehow, and had a key role in getting it off the ground. Thats only my guess. But here's the deal, for fans of the novels, what else do you want? An actor (a good one, I might add) has put everything into making a good, engaging, fun, and visually appealing movie. This is FILM, and the truth is that it has to differentiate itself from the source material. But even so, this movie is as close to the 450+ page novel as one would hope to get. And in my humble opinion, the movie improves upon the source material.

The film adds a style that doesn't come accross in the book. Maybe thats what some fans want, but fans of the books didn't make the movie. I've heard some people complain that Jack Reacher only walks to places and rides buses in the books. This is true. But its also true in the film. He does borrow a car in the movie, but guess what?... HE ALSO BORROWS A CAR IN THE NOVEL. It makes me think that people saw the trailer and just assumed the car belongs to Reacher. It doesn't. He isn't driving everywhere in his personal set of wheels. He does plenty of walking and bus riding.

Enough with the critics. This film harkens back to action movies of the 60's and early 70's. As I was watching it, 'Bullitt' came to mind. The pace is refreshing, and when the action happens, it makes sense and is delivered with the highest attention to quality and detail. Smart decisions were made in adding things (the car chase, an extra fight scene or two, tension between Jack and Helen) and taking away things (boat shoes, unnecessary characters, and Sheryl Crow), depending on what works for the film, itself.

Regardless of what you think about the books, the film was very very well made, with mystery, action, and well-placed humor. Lee Child is alright with Cruise playing the character, so why shouldn't everyone else be? Those passing on this because of nit-picking should try to regroup and accept whatever deviations from the book, and be glad that a movie got made. It looks like it might be the only one.

5508026,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"The success or  failure of  Jack Reacher will depend on your ability to accept Tom Cruise as a bad ass, I have never found Cruise to be a particular believable action star, but he is a great movie star and has managed to just barely pull it off before. After the success of the excellent Mission: Impossible-Ghost Protocol, the best of it's series, Cruise seemed prime for a comeback,. But alas Jack Reacher is not it.
 Based on Lee Child's novel ""One Shot"", where Jack Reachner is a mid-fifties 6'5 250lb. bad ass, Cruise assumes the role in none too believable style. When he tells one character ""that I'll drink your blood from a boat"", the compulsion is too laugh, which I don't believe was the desired effect. This role cries out for Liam Neeson or anyone of a number of aging action film stars.
 In the last decade or so movie stars like, say Richard Gere have looked towards being taken seriously as dramatic actors and strengthen their acting muscle. Cruise, on the other hand, seems to have focused his attention on being accepted as an action hero.
 For a routine potboiler Cruise sure seems to believe this to be a vanity project, evident by the fact that I saw his name at least three times during the opening titles. He uses the role to flex his muscles, literally, but was better served by the comical send-up of Rock of Ages.
 Adapted and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who it's hard to believe won an Oscar years ago for his clever modern crime masterpiece the Usual Suspects, his move into the director's chair has been an awkward one. He is a thoroughly capable director see his debut film the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Way-of-the-Gun-Blu-ray/dp/B002NPY7EU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Way of the Gun [Blu-ray</a>], but this one suffers from the miscasting of his lead actor.
  Jack Reacher begins with a sniper attack on what appears to be a bunch of innocent passer bys, coming only a few days after the massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, where twenty children were sensuously killed along with six adults. I think this movie might hit a little too close for some people, it certainty loses some of it's escapist appeal to such.
 Cruise is surrounded by a hefty supporting cast, but sadly both Rosumund Pike and Richard Jenkins are badly used. German filmmaker Werner Herzog, however, does make for an amusing villain with a soft spoken hiss in his voice, Herzog comes across as one of the film's rare highlights. Likewise, old codger Robert Duvall is a welcome sight in an all too brief role as a retired Marine gunnery sergeant who aids Reacher in the expected climax. Duvall also manages to be a more suitable action star at nearly eighty years of age, than Cruise does at fifty.
 The production looks good, competently shot by Caleb Deschanel, and above average editing, even in the obligatory car chase, are perhaps the only things that separates this from a typically generic DTD movie. In fact Jack Reacher may have benefited going the TV detective movie route like Tom Selleck has in his above average  Jesse Stone series of TV movies.
 At two hours and ten minutes, Jack Reacher runs at least thirty minutes too long. This allows for a lot of wondering and lost audience anticipation because it's pretty obvious where the movie is heading, it just takes too long to get there.
 I like and have been known to praise an action movie when it raise to a certain level and becomes more than just an action movie, the recent James Bond adventure Skyfall or last year's Ryan Goessling vehicle Drive are good examples of this. However, I must pan an action flick, when it becomes less than an action film, and I feel that is pretty much the case with Jack Reacher.
 Aside from Cruiser's miscasting, the movie never offers much intrigue, suspense, thrills or intensity. It fails as an action movie, it fails as a mystery because the plot developments are so apparent and it fails as a thriller because it never manages to thrill.
 It all comes to strangely ambiguous ending, after the fact, that sounds as if the movie is building to something more. I guess the filmmaker's were looking ahead to the sequel, which I doubt will happen..
 This won't be Tom Cruise's next big franchise, in fact each vehicle makes him seem less relevant than before. It is a shame because he is one of contemporary's great movie stars, but perhaps now is a good time to hang up the cape and look forward  to establishing himself as something the movies really need, a strong capable actor. Heading down this route the best he has to look forward to is a spot in the next Expendables movie, but maybe that's what Cruise longs for.

  When we first join the characters, we find ourselves in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A sniper attack ends the lives of five seemingly random people. With an abundance of evidence against him, the police arrest and charge former Army sharpshooter James Barr (played by Joseph Sikora). Rather than confess and throw himself on the mercy of the court, the way District Attorney Alex Rodin (played by Richard Jenkins) and his lead investigator, Detective Emerson (played by David Oyelowo) would like, he writes ""find Jack Reacher"" on a piece of paper and that's the last we hear from him for sometime. Jack Reacher (played by Tom Cruise) is a former military police officer who served with distinction and all but vanished from the earth once he left the service. The D.A. and lead investigator ask how they're supposed to find someone like that and just as one of the characters says ""you don't find him, he finds you"" he shows up at their office. By this time, perhaps as a result of misconduct on the part of police and prison officials, James Barr is in a coma. His lawyer, Helen Rodin (defense attorney and daughter of the District Attorney played by Rosamund Pike) introduces herself to Jack Reacher and asks him to work as her investigator. Reacher tells Rodin how he and Barr first became acquainted. Barr, a sharpshooter who never fired a single shot during a battle scenario, has been trained for a task he was never ordered to attempt. He, out of desperation, kills several men who are completely unknown to him. As it turns out, those men were civilian contractors and Barr killed them as they were concluding a rape rally. Barr was acquitted and Reacher, certain he will commit a similar crime in the future, vowed to be there when he did.

  I wouldn't call myself a Tom Cruise fan. I've seen films he was in that I liked (examples include A Few Good Men, the Mission: Impossible series, and Collateral) and I've seen him in movies I hated (Knight and Day, War of the Worlds, Vanilla Sky). I would consider myself a Rosamund Pike fan; however I have only seen two other films in which she appeared (Die Another Day and The Big Year). I wouldn't call Jack Reacher a masterpiece or some sort of reemergence of Cruise's career, but it was very entertaining and I'm glad I saw it.

Reacher is 6 ft 5 inches, blonde, physically fit but slim, blue eyes and not too talkative. The biggest conflict with the sniper novel is the use of cars.  Jack goes by bus or walks miles to get somewhere. Jack usually does not have a change of clothes and carries a toothbrush in his pocket that he uses with water only.  If someone had not been reading the Reacher books, this discrepancy between Cruise and Reacher would not be as bothersome.  Since I have read most of Lee Child's books, I am not anxious to see the Cruise version since I bet I will be disappointed.  James Caravesial (?) would be a better casting for Reacher.",1361664000,2,790,4.574468085106383

The scenes from throughout the Pittsburgh area look incredible as well - showing one reason why an incredible number of films are being done there. Gorgeous area.
There are a number of 'negative' reviews on here and i think most haven't even seen the movie (even though some ""claim"" they have just to negatively review it). People need to get over the fact that Cruise is playing the part of the 6'5"" Jack Reacher. The fact is, he nails the role. The reason he got the job is his incredible skills and adaptability.
The much talked about ""car-chase"" scene is one of the best of the last 20 years. Why? 2 reasons. One, is its very realistic. Too many car chases i see in movies are so far-fetched ridiculous that they're actually boring. Two, the sound. This is without question the most realistic ""sounding"" car chase i've seen. The engine shifts and noises make you feel like you are right there, if not in the car itself.

The twists and turns in the story and the eye-candy scenery from the Pittsburgh area make this film one that can be watched repeatedly - making a Blu-Ray purchase a no-brainer. I'm actually looking forward to that more than i did when i went to the theater to see it.
Of course, its an action-type film in many regards, so one must take the slightly ""dumbed down"" approach to it, but its light years better than duds such as Expendables 2.
I give it 4, maybe 4.5 stars, as i really enjoyed it. A worthwhile purchase for repeated viewings, especially if you're a Cruise fan.",1361145600,6,1669,4.490131578947368

5508035,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Tom Cruises new film Jack Reacher is best appreciated when seen in parts. There are some well-executed action set-pieces including one Philadelphia car chase done in a restrained 70s style. Its a crime thriller with twists and turns (and one-liners) aplenty, and it certainly keeps you guessing until the very end, but something is missing in this movie, something that would make the film really unique.

The story of Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise), a former military police officer (character created by author Lee Child) investigating a case of a seemingly random killing spree is so convoluted that it cannot be summarized in just a few sentences. Rosamund Pike is a defense attorney Helen whose father happens to be the DA (Richard Jenkins). And the ex-military sniper accused of murders is now in coma.

All these things require a fair amount of suspension of disbelief, but still they are fine as long as you get a strong central character and some memorable supporting ones. I have not read the original and the fans of the books may disagree, but Tom Cruise did a good job as the (anti-)hero Jack Reacher, who claims he is not a hero. Not surprisingly, Cruise's Days of Thunder co-star Robert Duvall steals scenes effortlessly.

The film benefits from the interesting main character and slick storytelling, but the script (by Christopher McQuarrie, Oscar winner for The Usual Suspects, who also directs Jack Reacher) does not give us a reason to care what happens next. Its like watching the pieces of the puzzle fall into place, but the process is not very intriguing. As the story unfolds, we finally see the bigger picture, which is, honestly, just preposterous.

As is often the case with such films, Jack Reacher manages to hold the viewer's interest not so much through the originality than the star power and effective set-pieces. It is watchable but forgettable.",1360886400,2,1874,4.95859872611465

5508048,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Having not read any of the Lee Child books, I watched this movie with fresh eyes. For those of you expecting something fun and over the top like Red or Knight and Day, this is not that kind of movie. That said, it is fun. This movie takes you on a journey with the characters trying to solve the mystery with more realistic action and scenarios than have been in most recent movies. It is more like an old-school cop movie like Bullitt or Dirty Harry. I really enjoyed this movie. My favorite part was the car chase. It was so refreshing to see a chase put together this way. The surround sound was amazing and put you right in the action. The movie had great acting, believable but awesome action scenes, and a well thought out plot. It also wasn't too predictable. I would say it was a good show all around. If you like movies that are awesome, watch this. Now, a note on content: This movie deserved the PG-13 rating it received. There was a little bit of swearing, including the token PG-13 ""F-word."" Also, if any of you are nervous about that part in the preview where you see that scantily clad woman, that is literally all you see. The bulk of the rating was for the violence, which this movie has in abundance. You see some innocent people killed, also there's some awesome hand to hand fights. Some of the killing\deaths were disturbing for my wife. Great movie overall, I was pleasantly surprised.",1359676800,3,1407,4.457364341085271

5508056,1,B00AS1Q8FW,"Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher...a breathtakingly absurd notion, equivalent to Clint Eastwood playing Liberace's lover (re the new movie about Liberace's life featuring Matt Damon).  I've read a few of the  Jack Reacher books and found them to be generally entertaining diversions from the ills of the day, escapist capers to kill time, a quick read on a rainy day with some good scotch or whiskey, or while lying on a chaise lounge on the beach, drinking margaritas and taking a peek or two at the occasional honey bun ambling along.  Now I don't wish to disparage Mr Cruise's talents (enjoyed his performance in ""A Few Good Men and ""The Firm""), but my god, has the man no sense of shame or good taste?  What was he thinking or smoking; has he been so deluded by Scientology drivel that he believes he's capable of playing any role he wants?  And for Lee Child, the author of the Reacher books, to say that he had no problem with Mr Cruise playing Reacher despite the physical differences as ""Reacher is a force of nature"" is bewildering.  I beg to differ.  Jimmy Cagney, another short actor, was a force naturale in ""White Heat,"" one of his best gangster movies.  Mr Cruise as Jack Reacher is incomprehensible.  Who, then, is Mr Reacher's doppelganger in real life?  Liam Neeson, although older than Reacher, would have been excellent in the role.  Absent Mr Neeson, my choice would be Dolph Lundgren.  See the character:  Reacher has a menacing physicality and a gruff, taciturn temperament.  Highly intelligent, he's a man with quick instincts and a wary, foreboding nature that keeps him on edge, quietly alert to danger and very capable of handling himself in bad situations.  Trouble comes to him as naturally as a river flowing to the sea.  But he's ready for anything, and we enjoy the visceral experience of a hero taking down the bad guys.  Neeson or Lundgren, the only two men who are right for the role.",1359072000,26,1912,4.693693693693693

I would feel like I couldn't take this movie seriously, and from now on every time I read one of those books, I'll be picturing Tom Cruise doing whatever is going on.

5508058,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"""Jack Reacher"" is a reprisal of those elegant Don Siegel detective thrillers from the 1970s. Tom Cruise returns to screen in fine form as the titular character to convincingly resurrect the intense cool of the iconic stars of the 1970s. This is a different Tom Cruise, edgier and relentless in his pursuit of the bad guys.

Cruise's role as Jack Reacher is in part a reprisal of his Vincent character from Collateral with the key difference that the physically intense and commanding presence on screen in that Michael Mann classic now has a compassionate and intellectual dimension in this role to make Cruise's portrayal of the multi-dimensional warrior/detective/hermit Jack Reacher character genuinely convincing. The mystery and aura of Reacher doing all he can to restore justice in the shadows is admirably brought to life by Cruise. He convincingly brings to screen a heroic character who is seen when he wants to be seen and disappears when he must. The end result is that the larger than life persona of Cruise is aptly suited to bring the larger than life character of Jack Reacher effectively to the screen.

Tom Cruise carries the peculiar wisdom of Jack Reacher with subtlety. His biggest accomplishment is to bring Reacher's physical intensity in harmonious relationship with his quiet, reflective, persona. As such Cruise has crafted a performance that goes very well with director Christopher McQuarrie's meditative, even stately, shot sequences. Do not expect to find the rapidly edited, hand-held camera shots, which has become the ""grammar"" of choice for action film narratives. The tempo is more classical and is the best recent tribute we have to those finely crafted Don Siegel action flicks from ""Dirty Harry"" to ""Coogan's Bluff"". McQuarrie's use of sound also evokes the best of Michael Mann movies, especially Heat.

Another stylistic innovation in this film is its spare visual style. Special effects are held back to a minimum only because there is so much real action called for by the Jack Reacher character. One can clearly see that Tom Cruise once again does all his stunts to give his portrayal of Reacher at work in the most dangerous scenes in the film that much more authenticity. The car chase sequences are worth calling out as an impressive piece of driving by the star. McQuarrie's camera often shows those kinetic and precarious car chase sequences with Cruise in the driver seat. These car chase sequences have the visceral intensity of the greatest chase sequences in Peter Yates's unforgettable McQueen masterpiece ""Bullitt"".

The supporting cast of David Oyelowo as Detective Emerson and Rosamund Pike as Helen Rodin, resurrects character types from McQuarrie's first film as a director where he obliquely sets out to critique violence in the Way of the Gun. Pike and Oyelowo once again demonstrate the high quality of Britain's acting talent flooding into Hollywood productions. The screen chemistry between Pike and Cruise are there to be seen. It is simple, understated, matter-of-fact. But there is a slow build up to something meaningful at the end of the film. Pike is perfect in the role and Oyelowo does an impressive turn as a detective who has much more going for him than his veiled personality shows.

For those of you in the mood to see Cruise on the course of perfecting his craft in his fourth decade as a star see this film. Cruise is increasingly molding a unique persona on screen that puts him up there with the Eastwoods and Connerys of the world. This film may not disappoint those who continue to appreciate Cruise for what he does best, breaking the barriers of the action film and what an action star should do to take the action film genre to new heights in the 21st century.

This is a relatively ""small"" film as far as the budget goes and has the look and feel of an indie film. Cruise's seering intensity keeps this film off-center to give new meaning to the mainstream action flick. ""Jack Reacher"" will hopefully find a solid niche of movie goers and find a steady stream of audience overseas. Even if this film does not look and feel like a traditional blockbuster Cruise film, it more than makes up for what it does not have by way of scale with its singular moodiness that is a throwback to the quiet intelligence of the great Siegel action movies. This film is a brilliant mood piece and  I hope that the film is successful enough to spawn more adaptations in the future.",1358812800,5,4449,4.88476821192053
5508059,2,B00AS1Q8FW,"I don't buy Cruise as Reacher. Sorry, but the character's physical size and strength is too much a part of the novels. One of the prime characteristics of Reacher is the intimidation of his opponents by his size. It is a MAJOR character point. It helps make the character believable. As a 6'4"", 230 pound ex-bouncer in a variety of night clubs, I promise you that in real life, big guys normally win, unlike when Hollywood pays the big guy to fall down when fighting the small actor. In my years of bouncing, I only saw two instances of the little guy winning. In one case, the little guy was a highly trained MMA fighter and only a little smaller than his opponent. In the other, the little guy was an athlete and the big guy was out of shape and had obviously never been in a fight before. That is one reason I personally enjoy the Reacher series. It honestly allows for size actually being a factor, just like in real life. Tiny Tom is not Jack Reacher. EVER! Hope they recast and try again.",1358640000,15,994,4.349462365591398

I don't understand the personal attacks against TOM CRUISE. Despite the differences in the physical differences with the character in the books, (I haven't read any of them) I thought TOM CRUISE was more than sufficient portraying the character on screen.

5508061,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"The movie ""Jack Reacher"" begins with a seemingly random sniper attack that kills five innocent victims.  In record time, the police investigation rounds up a disturbed former Army veteran, who just happens to be a trained sniper.  Under questioning by the police, he asks them to ""call Jack Reacher.""  Reacher (Tom Cruise) turns out to be a former military policemen who has gone off the grid and into the private justice business.  He agrees to help the attorney defending the veteran, and quickly determines that what looks to be an open-and-shut case looks a lot more like a clever frame-up.  Whoever is behind the frameup reacts badly to Reacher's involvement in the case, sending a group of thugs to scare him off.  Reacher doesn't scare so good.  He does find himself up against a ruthless conspiracy with a connection to the Russian mob and an insider within the investigation.

The air of paranoia around the case only gets thicker as Reacher continues his investigation his way, beating up bad guys, conducting high speed car chases and dodging shooters.  He will get help in the form of a retired Marine (neat cameo by Robert Duval).  Reacher acts as if he has nothing to lose, which may be his only edge in a final confrontation with the bad guys, with everything at stake.

5508063,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"The film opens up like ""Basic"" with one man requesting another. A man (Joseph Sikora) is accused of random shootings. The evidence is overwhelmingly against him.

Eventually he takes on the task as the lead investigator for the accused. His lawyer (Rosamund Pike) happens to be the daughter of the prosecutor (Richard Jenkins). As Jack investigates, things are not what they seem which draws us into the story.

Unfortunately the mystery is short lived as clues come too fast. It then resorts to an us vs. them with a car chase scene that lasted way to long for this type of crime drama. The script was otherwise well done. Acting was as we would expect from the cast. Makes for a decent rental. There could be a Jack Reacher sequel, hopefully with some complexity.

How could Tom Cruise ever convince anyone that he was Jack?  When we got to the theatre, the poster proclaiming that ""Tom Cruise is Jack Reacher"" made me cringe.  But, within 15 minutes of the opening credits, Tom won me over!  I loved the movie...I laughed, I cried, and I got lost in the action.  We've seen it twice!  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the unecessary profanity that is not in the books, but that's my only complaint.

5508065,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"I've read some of Lee Childs work. A movie based on his writing should turn out exactly like this movie did. It was smart, fun and Jack didn't take any crap from people. My expectations were exceeded specifically because Tom Cruise managed to play the character so closely to what I read in the book. Couple that with the fact that the investigation was decent and the villains sufficiently dangerous made this a good time for anyone who likes these crime drama stories.

The fault of this falls more with the source material than the film itself. Childs is the master of coincidence and it got pretty old in the books for me. His villains lack any real motivation beyond money and in some cases, their ability to start rolling in the dough is in question too. If I was to give this any sort of harsh criticism, it would be in the story itself. Starting the story off the way they do, for example, is pretty rushed and unnecessary. A civilian can come up with better ways to accomplish what these maniacs did. It was catalyst for the sake of getting the characters involved.

None of that matters when it comes to the performances and the action in this movie. They allow it to be brutal and they let the character be true to himself. Cruise snaps off his lines nicely and he's got the shape to pull this off. The number 1 complaint that I hear people make about this choice was less that Cruise might not be able to do it but that he doesn't fit the character's description. Let me tell you, it might be a fun fantasy to imagine this 6'5 monster roaming the country incognito but he stands out way too much. At least with Cruise, I can believe he's able to blend in and disappear.

Give this movie a chance. It's not rocket science, it's another crime drama but it's a good one and I think that if you don't cling to a ton of preconceived notions, you'll have a lot of fun.",1357862400,9,1874,4.348571428571429

Cruise's Reacher is a thinking mans' too the point blunt instrument and he gets the job done his way and for his motives. It is a very subtle film and that is part of the brilliance here.

I was totally engrossed by this film. The editing by Kevin Stitt was tight and very effective and Christopher McQuarrie's script with his low key direction gave this a great, yet very subtle narrative sweep.

5508068,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"I'm really not judging too hard on this movie. I enjoy action movies, cop movies, thrillers, etc. I also have not read the book.

However, one major complaint is that this movie should have been rated R. For such a tough character as Reacher is and the dark-ish plot, an R rating would have been much more interesing. The sniper in the beginning isn't as effectively portrayed without the ""pink mist"" which is even mentioned later on in the movie. No, I'm not obsessed with violence and gore, I just feel that it would have been more effective considering the movie is about a sniper. Just my opinion.

I think Tom Cruise, as crazy as he is in real life, plays a decent Jack Reacher. Again, I don't know the book but he's pretty good for what I do know. I just mean as a character, it was fun. Tom Cruise, like him or not, can definitely pull off a lot of his characters very well. (Mission Impossible, Valkyrie) Some people simply dislike him, but they're often considering his personal life.

Some things are stupid. Jack never uses a gun, really, unless he has to. I mean, he should get his ass beat eventually. I understand it's a character trait, but there is a stupid point where he has a gun pointed at an enemy much larger than him but tosses it aside to brawl.
There is a scene where two goons basically beat each other up instead of him by accident. Funny-ish, but dumb.

The story is intriguing. I never read the book, so it was all new to me. I don't know what's been changed, but Reacher's realizations about the conspiracy are interesting to me, and you say ""Damn, I should have noticed."" They're not too far-fetched, which is nice.

The best part about the movie is the audio. Some people may say this is the worst part. Very little music, some ambient bass. The movie feels real, not clouded by ""epic"" music. Everything takes place in a realistic setting and I feel like it's more ""authentic"" if you will.

For example, there is a car chase. My favorite scene in the entire movie. No music, just muscle cars racing through streets with cops. Some may say it's boring and generic. I find it real and authentic. No crazy jumps or maneuvers. Just speed and wit. It's almost worth watching for this scene. It's amazing. The classic cars in the movie help, too. Besides the newer Crown Vics the police drive, Reacher grabs a Chevelle SS and I saw some classic Mustangs and Camros (I believe, even if only for a second).

Unexpectedly, I found plenty of humor throughout this novel. Not bursting on the floor laughing humor, but clever, witty humor that fits perfectly into the story and makes the movie just that much better. Without it, it's close to a generic ""badass"" movie, but instead becomes clever.

All in all, decent movie. I'm going to read the book now because I enjoyed it. Maybe it'll be better, I don't know. But I'm interested. As for a sequel, I wouldn't count on it. I know the books are separate stories and this one takes place later in the timeline, so I don't think many of these characters would end up returning in a sequel. In Hollywood, it's tough to do such a thing- except James Bond, but that still has some recurring characters- considering that only one character is important.",1357689600,56,3218,4.507718696397942

Tom Cruise, Rosamund Pike, Richard Jenkins, and others, including Werner Herzog and Robert Duvall

I saw Jack Reacher this weekend. I went mostly out of curiosity:  I've read every Reacher novel written by Lee Child (some of them bought through Amazon) and loved them.

I knew Child's Reacher and Cruise's would be different animals. Child's Reacher is 6' 5"", between 210 and 250 pounds in different books, and has a 50"" chest. Cruise is 5' 7"" and probably weighs, stripped down, between 140 and 150 pounds. Even as fighters (which is one of the things Jack Reacher has to do every so often), they'd fight differently -radically differently--because there's no way a 150 pound, 5' 7"" tall man could do some of the things an oversized behemoth like the original Reacher does. And though neat, like an ex-military man would be, Lee Child's Reacher is always a little scruffy: he buys his clothes one set at a time, throwing away the old ones, because he doesn't like to travel encumbered, and until then, he washes them out in the sink of whatever motel room he's staying in. Tom Cruise's Reacher exhibits the same behavior as Child's Reacher in this regard, but Cruise's Reacher always looks neat, just as Tom Cruise does himself.

Enough carping on appearance. The critical question is how well does Cruise do as Reacher, and the answer is `okay.' Not great, not even near it, but okay, not a total embarrassment.

Nor is the movie a total embarrassment. There is a good fight near the beginning when five local thugs take on Reacher to teach him a lesson. It's kind of comical watching little Tom Cruise mouth some of Reacher's words about how this is their last chance to get off without damage and how five to one odds are really three to one odds, because the last two will run away when they see what Reacher does to the first three, but the fight itself is swift, brutal, and most essential in a Reacher story, efficient. There is no waste effort, and avoiding waste effort is essential to the Reacher persona: he doesn't indulge in histrionics, he always uses the most direct efficient and quickest way to success in combat, like a good soldier would.

What a shame then there's a second big fight because the movie butchers it. Reacher has come to the showdown against the bad guys. He's already warned one -a Russian sniper- that if he sees him again, he's going to hand him his lunch barehanded. So what happens? He gets the drop on the bad guy and is pointing an assault rifle right at his chest at close to zero range.  So Reacher/Cruise throws away his gun and rakes on the baddie mano a mano, in one of those generic fights we've seen in hundreds of other movies. There's also a car chase -what action movie would be complete without one?--that is boringly generic. We've seen it all too many times for it to be exciting except in the most mechanical, evanescent way.

That's a problem with the whole movie. It's a generic action film. Some of Reacher's tics have been inserted -he doesn't talk a lot, he washes his clothes out in the sink and buys new ones and throws away the old ones when he's done with them, he has near eidetic memory, and most of the time you just know he's been in army for years by the way he acts--but behind it all, eliminate the tics and this could just as easily be Ethan Hawke, sans disguises and trickery, in any of the increasingly boring Mission Impossible movies that have kept Cruise a star.

What's best in the movie? Old pros Werner Herzog and Robert Duvall milk their roles for all they are worthy and succeed in making them believable and enjoyable to watch.  Richard Jenkins does a good, not great job, as Good Lawyer Rosamund Pike's father (he's the D.A.).

The Lee Childs novel that this movie was taken from (One Shot) was crisply plotted and everything Reacher does in it is thought out and efficient. This movie is just messy. Not horrible but not good either. Thus okay, no better than that.

One other complaint: Cruise is starting to look old for this kind of movie. His body is still buff, but, as it was in the last Mission Impossible movie when he was on the outside of the Burj al Khalifa in Dubai with his shirt off, his muscles look like old muscles now, and his face is puffy in closeups. Cruise has shown in previous movies that he's a modestly competent actor. He needs to begin stretching himself before he winds up playing opposite Sly, Arnold, Bruce and Jean Claude in one of those retread Old Heroes movies.

Lee Child says he likes Cruise as Reacher, but then Lee Child sold Cruise's production company the character franchise for the movies and I doubt he did it purely out of a conviction that Cruise was the perfect Reacher. Besides, Child used to work in advertising and we all know ad men occasionally bend the truth.",1357171200,171,4811,4.560834298957126
5508075,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"""Jack Reacher"" is based on a 2005 novel called ""One Shot"" in which the title character, Jack Reacher, is a drifter and former military police officer who has elite skills. Having no knowledge of the character or the book series, I am seeing this movie without any prior knowledge of what the character is supposed to be. Many of the loyal fans are upset about the casting of Tom Cruise.

Apparently, in the novel, Reacher is intended to be homeless looking, 6'5"" tall and blonde. Tom Cruise is none of those. Although the author, Lee Child, has been known to say, ""Reacher's size in the books is a metaphor for an unstoppable force, which Cruise portrays in his own way. With another actor you might get 100% of the height but only 90% of Reacher. With Tom, you'll get 100% of Reacher with 90% of the height."" That being said, I completely understand what he's talking about.

""Jack Reacher"" is without question something that will continuously pique your interest. Never a dull moment, it is part mystery, part legal drama, part action flick and part comedy. The comedy is rare, but there. In light of recent incidents, the subject matter may be tough to watch, but it also adds to the disdain for the villains. The movie starts out with 6 people gunned down in Pittsburgh by a sniper. Much of the setup is told without dialogue and it effectively sucks you into a mystery. The best part about ""Reacher"" is that the movie allows you, the audience, to play along, figuring things out along with Reacher. The clues are uncharacteristically plentiful but Reacher looks at things a completely different way.

I'm not gonna judge ""Reacher"" based on the books, but on the movie, and it is good. It the kind of movie you can't take your eyes off of, for fear of missing something. It is the kind of action movie that movies like ""Alex Cross"" should have been. It is the kind of action movie that proves Tom Cruise to be one of the best action stars we have today. He's become such a great action movie actor, that he makes the cast of ""Expendables 1 & 2"" look like has-beens. Sorry, but Tom Cruise's action movies have substance and acting chops. There are no Bruce Willis' hanging from F-15's or endless gunfire. He doesn't just blow things up and shoot things up, he has a brain, and so do his movies.",1357171200,7,2297,4.543478260869565

I am not a die-hard Tom Cruise fan and he has done enough movies that suck that they could go either way. This movie was well done and he did a fantastic job. Who cares if he is not 6'5"". He plays it big and pulls it off. I would say get to the theater and watch this movie. It does not seem like a 2 plus hour movie. It moves along well and it was rather refreshing that he played the character as confident not some angsty whiner. I am tired of that whole line of thinking in movies music and whatever else you can think of.

5508077,5,B00AS1Q8FW,"When I first saw the previews for this movie I was a little hesitant to go see it in theaters. All of my friends saw the hobbit already so we decided to see this.  I walked in expecting to see the next Mission Impossible movie but boy was I shockingly impressed.

Before watching this movie, I hadn't read any of the books. I read some reviews on the movie before going and the only complaints I could find were mainly:

1. John Reacher is much taller than Tom Cruise
2. The character in the movie is too confident, the character in the book is more subtly confident

First let me start by saying that this movie was so good, it made me want to start reading the books.  There are 17 of them total. I started reading the first one, 'Killing Floor' as soon as I got home after watching the movie.

The movie itself was action packed. It was more of your classic Action Mystery and almost had a feel of an action movie from the late 90's. There aren't any big twists or shocking turns and I liked that. It kept me interested without really trying to shock me after hiding extra facts we couldn't possibly know.

The ending was one that you hope for in a movie. I won't ruin it for anyone but I was satisfied with how they ended the movie.

I highly recommend watching this movie. By the previews, Tom Cruise's 'Oblivion' looked pretty good, but 'John Reacher' should not be overlooked. It was such a good movie it made me start reading the books and to preorder the Blu-ray which I almost never do.",1357084800,4,1496,4.298932384341637

5508080,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Wolverine, the most popular of the X-Men and one of the most popular comic book characters in comic book history is also one of the shortest. According to thirty plus years of continuous publication, Logan - AKA wolverine - is 5'2"" tall and somewhere around 200 lbs, with metal infused skeleton and claws, and a back as hairy as a Kodiak bear. When X-Men director Bryan Singer cast a slim 6'3"" song-and-dance man named Hugh Jackman to play the short stocky Wolverine, comic book geeks everywhere said ""What the f***?""

Now anyone familiar with the Jack Reacher novels written by Lee Child knows that main character of the novels is a 6'5"" 250 pound blond haired blue eye bruiser with the face of a professional rugby player. And likewise anyone who read the novels must have said ""What the f***?"" upon learning that the diminutive Tom Cruise was cast to play Jack Reacher. ""He's too small. He's too Pretty."" My wife, who's a huge fan of Lee Child's novels, was so irritated with the casting choice that she refused the see the movie.

For those of you not familiar with Lee Child's novels, the title character is military veteran who hobos around America with nothing but the clothes on his back and the money in his pocket. He avoids relationships, responsibilities and even posessions that might tie him down. He doesn't even own a suitcase. When his clothes get dirty he throws them away and buys new cloths. He rides from town to town on Greyhound busses. He generally minds his own business, but always seems to find himself at the center of a mystery or conspiracy that requires his investigative instinct and brutal hand-to-hand skills to solve.

The movie begins with a sniper shooting down four people in Pittsburg. The evidence quickly points to James Barr, a former Army sniper with a disturbing past. But maybe the evidence points at Barr too quickly. No sooner is Barr taken into custody when his is beaten nearly to death by other convicts and left in a coma. Now the mystery becomes one of whether Barr will even come out of his coma to be put on trial. Enter Jack Reacher, a former military policeman who despises Jack Barr from their shared military history. Reacher is only too willing believe that Barr did the crime he's accused of. But when Local criminals try to take out Reacher, he decides to give the case a 2nd look. Soon he's unraveling a much deeper conspiracy.

Well, having just seen Jack Reacher at my local theater, it seems that the miscast Tom Cruise somehow made it work just as a miscast Hugh Jackman made Wolverine work. Cruise is believable as a retired military policeman who really doesn't care and just wants to move on. Tom Cruise may not be my favorite actor (I would have preferred James Caviezal) but he is a superbly skilled actor who knew just how to play the character. The movie also benefitted from a tightly written script which solidly conveys Lee Child's vision of the hardened cynical soldier turned drifter. It also managed to give us just enough backs story without getting bogged down in exposition.

One last thing: Jack Reacher sports about the best fight choreography I've seen since Watchmen.  I've had a few years of training in Wing Chun and a couple more in some other styles.  I'm not easily impressed, but the moves Cruise used on the bad guys were a hell of a lot more realistic than most movie viewers will be used to.

As for the diminutive Cruise playing the man-giant Reacher...6'5""...5'6""...what's the difference?",1356912000,868,3485,4.711001642036125
5508081,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"The main complaint I heard and read before JACK REACHER ever even hit theatres was from fans of Lee Child's series of books about this film's titular character, and it was always the same complaint: ""Tom Cruise is too short! Jack Reacher is 6'5"" and is built like a brick outhouse!!"" And my response to that was always: ""Can you think of an actor who's really good, does action well, has a lot of charisma, and IS ACTUALLY built like that?""

Christopher McQuarrie, the Oscar-Winning screenwriter of Bryan Singer's unforgettable THE USUAL SUSPECTS, and the writer/director of the very forgettable THE WAY OF THE GUN, picked up his pen and got back behind the camera for this potential franchise first outing for the cinematic adventures of Jack Reacher (Cruise), former Army military police investigator. He's, as they say in the film, a ghost. He has no fixed address, no credit cards, no phone number. In fact, the only proof of his existence is a bank account, his military record, and his military pension. He buys his clothes from Goodwill as needed and donates the old ones, hops on a bus, and goes wherever the day takes him. But in a very disturbing and wordless opening sequence, a man with a military-grade sniper rifle shoots five people in front of PNC Park in Pittsburgh. All the clues lead back to Army sniper James Barr (Joseph Sikora, who spends most of the film in a coma) as a man who just snapped. The lead District Attorney (the great Richard Jenkins) is pushing for the death penalty, but the defense attorney for Barr, Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike) is looking to stop that from happening. It also happens that Helen is the daughter of the DA. When told to confess, with all the convenient evidence stacked against him, Barr only has one thing to tell them: ""Get Jack Reacher"". Once Reacher comes on the scene, he is fully aware of what's been going on, but uncertain as to why Barr asked for him, because he fully believes that Barr is guilty. Nevertheless, Reacher ends up working as an investigator for Helen, and runs afoul of the real reason those people were killed, and uses all his skills and investigative talents to find the truth.

It's true that this film is a little thin on character development. We know just enough about each character to keep the momentum going forward, but no more than that. Character motivation gets even less time. For all intents and purposes, this film feels more like a throwback to 80's detective thrillers, but with a smarter and more modern sensibility. McQuarrie seems much more assured behind the camera here than I've seen before, and he creates a labrinythian mystery here that feels organic as Reacher follows up on each clue, and Cruise seems to be having a good time playing a character that is somewhat out of step with the outside world, but always seems to be able to see the angles played against him. It's also true that some quality actors seem a little wasted here, with the only real exceptions being Pike, a menacing Jai Courtney (SPARTACUS) as the villain's right-hand man and a great supporting role by Robert Duvall as a retired Marine and shooting range owner who ends up coming along for the ride. Actors like Michael Raymond James (TERRIERS, TRUE BLOOD), Jenkins, and David Oyelowo (RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES) are kind of shafted. Even famed director Werner Herzog, the real villain of the piece, is more of a cartoonishly creepy villain. Also true, apparently, to huge fans of this series, that the film in no real way resembles the book this film is based on, which is the ninth book in the series called ONE SHOT.

Why then do I give this film a 4 out of 5?

Because this was an incredibly fun film. I like protagonists that are on the outside looking in, and always seem to have that extra step ahead. Jack Reacher is very much kin to 24's Jack Bauer; they are both renegades, they're both very smart, they're both men of serious action, they follow justice and not the law, and if people would only listen to them, things would be over a lot quicker. Although, Reacher has a much more evident sense of humor than Jack Bauer ever did. He has some terrific zingers along the way here, particularly in a 5-on-1 fight scene. He also carries himself with an assuredness that is rare to see in a modern action hero. Most films at present have the heroes of the film constantly questioning themselves. Are they up to the task? Can they be the hero the people involved need? Can they win the day without compromising their values? JACK REACHER as a film and as a character throw those discussions to the wayside in favor of a more entertaining romp as opposed to a more navel-gazing reluctant hero that seem to dominate films of late. The pace of the film also seems nicely breezy as well, which has a bit of a mismatch of tone that the opening of the film would have us believe. While it's a long-ish film, it doesn't seem long at all.

I understand people's frustration with this film, but I don't subscribe to it because when it comes right down to it, I enjoyed the hell out of JACK REACHER, but if the box office indications are worth anything, it's unlikely I'll see more of his adventures on the big screen.",1356912000,251,5200,4.587096774193548
5508082,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"I expected this to be a Tom-Cruise-Kicks-Ass-For-120-mins film, which would have been the worst-case scenario. The trailer didn't reveal much, but it seemed to market this film as strictly an action film. I enjoyed the bits of humor sprinkled within the film. There is also a surprising amount of depth and mystery to this film which was pleasing, however, that's about the extent of the strengths of this film.

Jack Reacher doesn't bring a whole lot to the table as far as the mystery and crime genre go. This was a fairly predictable film and I didn't find any of the characters interesting or fleshed out in the least. The title character is extremely bland and we get little to no character development. I can't help but say that Tom Cruise's talents were wasted with this film because he played a role that Nicolas Cage easily could have played just as well. The character was poorly written and Tom Cruise apparently didn't have much to work with which led to a very uninteresting and one-dimensional character. The villains weren't very interesting either, which made the drama less exciting, to put it bluntly. Fight scenes were poorly choreographed, and the final action scene was just dull.

Jack Reacher isn't a terrible action/crime film in any sense. The humor greatly cushions this very average installment, but it's not enough to push me to a recommendation. Jack Reacher is a film I've seen hundreds of times, only the T's are crossed a bit differently.",1356912000,3,1470,4.852589641434263

Tom Cruise just is not right for the role of Jack Reacher. Reacher has to be physically intimidating and Cruise just is not. Thats nothing against him because its actually difficult to think of any current big-name actor who could credibly play Reacher.

Christopher McQuarrie was an odd and risky choice for writer/director. He didn't seem to do badly, but his presence made the whole thing feel a whole lot like an extra mission impossible.

It gets one star because I don't like bait (Reacher) and switch (mission impossible 4.5).

5508086,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"Jack Reacher is not a bad film, though it will likely be a disappointment to fans already familiar with the character from Lee Child's series of Jack Reacher books.  It might even be a good film - to someone who's never seen any of the myriad similar action thrillers of the last forty years or so.  If however, like me, you have, then Jack Reacher comes across as more tedious than anything else, with more clichs than bullets, dialogue frequently so arch you could cross the Mississippi with it, and not a single unpredictable moment.

(*** Warning - this review does contain a few minor spoilers, but no major ones ***)

The film begins with a long opening scene where we observe a sniper - mostly from the sniper's point of view, so we never really see his face - picking out targets, seemingly at random, at a nearby office park, the crosshairs of his scope lingering on one potential target after another but never actually firing... until finally he does, making six shots in quick succession and killing five people in the process.  The evidence found at the scene by the lead police detective, Emerson (David Oyelowo), quickly leads to a suspect and an arrest - James Barr (Joseph Sikora), a former army sniper who lives in the area. With the evidence overwhelming and the case seemingly air-tight, Emerson and the District Attorney, Alex Rodin (Richard Jenkins) offer Barr a deal - plead guilty and get a life sentence instead of going to trail and possibly getting the death penalty.  But instead of signing the deal, Barr instead writes three words on the plea agreement: ""Get Jack Reacher"".  Which is a bit of a problem as Reacher is apparently something of an invisible man:  a former army military policeman who has no known address, phone number, bank account, credit card or even driver's license.  The man lives as off-the-grid as it's possible to get.

But before Emerson and Rodin can wonder much about why Barr wants them to get Reacher and how they might go about finding him, Reacher (Tom Cruise) suddenly appears at their office, for reasons of his own.  Barr's defense attorney, Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike), who happens to be the DA's daughter, is also curious about why Barr asked for Reacher as even she - along with everyone else, including it seems Reacher himself - believes that Barr is guilty.  Her real reason for involvement is her opposition to the death penalty, which she hopes to save Barr from.  Reacher is also curious why Barr would ask for him, particularly given that he'd promised to kill Barr if he ever crossed the line again.  But they can't just ask Barr now because the man is in a coma resulting from a severe beating he received when he was put in custody with some other prisoners rather than in isolation.

As Reacher begins to investigate, a number of things begin to not add up.  The evidence, he decides, is too overwhelming, too neatly convenient and convincing.  It also doesn't fit the pattern of a man who was army-trained to be a sniper.  Reacher's suspicions lead to questions which he presents to Helen as needing answers.  Their investigations quickly start provoking reactions, most particularly a crude attempt to intimidate and neutralize Reacher.  The evidence quickly mounts that something much bigger is at work, that the shootings were not random but had a purpose behind them, with conspiracy, corruption and deception all part of the mix.  The rest of the film proceeds to reveal all, with an abundance of fighting, shooting and chase scenes along the way.

If all of this sounds familiar, it's probably because you've seen these elements in varying combinations in any number of action thrillers over the last few decades (or even more if you're older).  There is very little in Jack Reacher that is new or original and even less that is unpredictable, making the film, for all of its flurry of ""action"" sequences, somewhat tedious to sit through.  The cast has some talented actors in it but the characters are so clichd and stock, and their dialogue so arch, that there's not a lot that they can do with them, from Richard Jenkins' No Way This Guy Is Innocent DA to Rosamund Pike's Painfully Naive Defense Attorney (not to mention the two-for-one cliche of Clashing Father/Daughter Attorneys With Opposing Values). Michael Raymond-James (best known as the Cajun bad guy from the first season of True Blood) is Linsky, the Lurking Henchman Who Screws Up And Pisses Off The Boss.  Alexia Fast's Sandy is Girl Who Dies Because She's Too Dumb To Listen To The Hero. Joseph Sikora's Barr is the Victim You're Not Meant To Sympathize With.  And Robert Duvall's ex-marine shooting range owner, Cash, is just another in a string of recent roles which Duvall seems to be making a career of these days, The Tough But Affable Old Coot.

The only truly redeeming things in Jack Reacher are a handful of scenes which are genuinely funny (as opposed to the scenes which are - unfortunately for the film - unintentionally funny) and a surprise - and superb - performance by famed German film director Werner Herzog.  In one scene, Reacher is assaulted by three thugs while he's searching an apartment... but he barely has to do anything because the thugs are so physically incompetent that they land more blows on each other than even come close to hitting him.  Reacher doesn't even really have to dodge.  It's a brilliant bit of masterfully choreographed comic violence that comes across as completely believable instead of mere slapstick.  In another scene, Reacher ends up in a situational joke - finding himself in the role of being the guy who brought a knife to a gun fight - which is then taken another comical step further.  And Herzog's villain, The Zec (Russian for ""The Prisoner"") is a truly chilling creation, a ruthlessly self-controlled villain with only one good eye who never raises his voice... because he never has to.  Especially after he explains why he's missing so many pieces of his fingers.  He only has a handful of scenes, but he's far and away the most memorable thing in the film.  And for fans of the author, Lee Childs has a cameo as the desk sergeant in a scene at a police station.

The bulk of the blame for Jack Reacher's failure to rise above the mediocre should, I think, be laid in equal parts on McQuarrie as the writer & director and on Cruise as the producer.  McQuarrie struck gold - once - back in 1995 when he did the screenplay for the iconic The Usual Suspects, for which he was properly awarded the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.  Since then however, his record has been decidedly spotty.  Prior to Jack Reacher, McQuarrie's only directorial effort at a feature film was the 2000 box-office bomb The Way Of The Gun, for which he also wrote the screenplay.  Many of the same problems with that film are repeated here, including a ham-handedly manipulative score by Joe Kraemer surrounding what one critic termed ""a pointless exercise in gun violence with characterizations so thin they vaporize"".

But then Cruise, as the producer, must be held accountable, not only for picking McQuarrie to write and direct and for picking Kraemer to do the film score, but also for casting himself as Reacher.  Not only is Cruise not remotely physically suited for the role (Reacher is 6'5"" and built like a tank; Cruise is 5'7"" and weighs about 170 lbs), his performance just walks all over the character Child created (Jack Reacher is noted for not saying anything most of the time; Cruise's Reacher won't shut up).  One way of looking at this film is that it's Cruise working his way through some mid-life crisis, trying to show that at 50 he's still physically the same actor he was back in his 20's when he did Top Gun.  Which is why the publicity for the movie is making such a big deal about Cruise doing his own stunts and why there are these scenes lingering on Cruise's bare upper torso when he takes his shirt off.  Don't get me wrong - as an actor, Cruise can deliver excellent work as he's done in films as varied as Tropic Thunder, Collateral, Jerry Maguire and Interview With The Vampire - but only when he's under a director that he can't walk all over as he does McQuarrie in this film.  Here, he spends most of his time going through stage-managed fight and chase scenes with one facial expression that only varies with the intensity of the glare.

Except for Werner Herzog's chilling bad guy and a couple of fairly original funny scenes, not really recommended unless you've got two-plus hours to burn and don't mind spending it on a film barely distinguishable from the hundred or more films you've already seen that are just like it.  Again, it's not really bad - it's just sort of there.",1356739200,9,8715,4.713909030982202
5508087,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"I've read a few of the Reacher books. That being said, I thought this movie was...'okay'.

I think that Cruise (despite his physical shortcomings for the role) did pretty well as Reacher. The dialog was sharp and actually provided quite a bit of laughs. The woman in this movie was awful and truly pulls off a 'deer in headlights' look the entire time. Herzog is basically wasted. I'm guessing he filmed his scenes in two days max and stands or sits around looking tired the entire time.

The car chase was really cool, and even though it was goofy, I liked the scene in the drug house. However, there really wasn't as much action as I was going in expecting.

This was a serviceable movie, but nothing to write home about. I was expecting more.",1356739200,11,745,4.503703703703704
5508088,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Director Christopher McQuarrie won an Oscar for his screenplay on The Usual Suspects, and he also wrote the screenplay for Jack Reacher. If you have seen the trailer, you might think that the movie is a pure adrenalin rush in the same vein as Taken, but that's not exactly correct. There is plenty of action, but McQuarrie also gives his characters time to breathe, and we learn a little about the backgrounds of most of the major players.

The movie begins with someone shooting five apparently random strangers from long range with a rifle. This is shown in close-up. In fact, this movie has more close-ups than any I have ever seen. It includes facial shots, point-of-view shots, and objects. The camera angles are also interesting. Perhaps the intention was to place us right among the action?

A man is arrested for the shooting and asks for Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise). Unfortunately, Reacher is something of a mystery and nobody knows how to contact him. When he does eventually appear, it's on his terms. We learn that he was an investigator of sorts while in the army, and he's enlisted by Helen (Rosamund Pike), who is the lawyer representing the accused man. Reacher isn't sure he's even guilty.

I don't think that I should give away many more plot points, so I'll talk more generally about what you can expect. But I will say that the story is fairly predictable.

I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise, but I think this is one of his best performances and I would put it up there with Collateral. At 50 years of age, he's still a convincing action star, and I believed that he had the skills to do what he does in the movie. McQuarrie also keeps some of the action scenes realistic and things don't always work out perfectly for the hero.

You'll see Reacher investigating the crime, and we are shown how some of his realizations come to pass. There's an enjoyable cameo from Robert Duvall, and nobody gives a truly bad performance in the entire movie.

Action fans will enjoy a few fight scenes, a car chase, and a big shootout, but there's a story present at all times. This isn't a movie without substance. Reacher is the only character who is given much to do. At times it seems as though everyone else is standing around waiting to see what happens.

Jack Reacher won't blow you away, but it's better than the standard genre offerings. I could easily see it spawning a sequel, and I would probably go and see it.",1356739200,8,2423,4.55632183908046

There were two, maybe three brief action scenes throughout the entire two and a half hour running time. The other 90% of the movie was just talking heads. The dialogue was either boring or laughably unrealistic for a gritty crime thriller. (Example: Jack Reacher:  ""I will beat you to death and drink your blood from a boot!"") The whole movie was a contrived, boring, convoluted mess. Frankly, I'm kind of pissed that I paid to see it.",1356652800,15,565,4.4326923076923075
5508090,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"During a recent coast-to-coast flight, I read my first book by Lee Child (""Jack Reacher: One Shot"") and was pleasantly surprised (my reading is usually non-fiction these days). Of course I smiled when I realized that Tom Cruise would be playing a 6'5"" former military investigator, but he plays TALL! As is always the case, two characters were melded into one, two characters disappeared altogether and I was surprised by the dump trucks, but the movie is (almost) as diverting as the book.

In this PG-13 action-filled thriller, a sniper kills five people and escapes. Based on forensic evidence at the scene, police track down the shooter, arrest him and obtain a signed confession in record time. Problem is, he says ""Get Jack Reacher"" right after he signs his confession. No one has heard of the guy.

Let's take a look at this cast:
  * Tom Cruise (""Mission Impossible"") is our eponymous anti-hero, a loner, very smart, a man who is arrested only when he wants to be; but he's beginning to think this case looks a little too perfect.
  * Rosamund Pike (""The Big Year"") is a newly graduated attorney who has taken a hopeless case that appears to be open and shut. She just wants to keep him off Death Row.
  * Richard Jenkins (""Liberal Arts"") is the District Attorney whose daughter has taken this case over his objections; he intends to wrap it up right away.
  * David Oyelowo (""The Help"") is the Police Commissioner who is only too happy to close a case this quickly...and with incontrovertible evidence. (His name is pronounced ""O-Yellow."")
  * Alexia Fast (""Blackbird"") is the sweetie sent to seduce our skeptical hero.
  * Joseph Sikora (""Safe"") is the trained military sniper accused of shooting five random victims.
  * Lee Childs (Author) is the Desk Sergeant; a sharp-eyed JayFlix person spotted him making his debut cameo appearance.

The tag line is ""Six shots. Five dead."" So expect wit, fisticuffs, cold-blooded brutality, vehicular mayhem and lots of gunfire but no blowie uppie stuff or sweaty bodies. In other words, this is a movie made for a target audience who wants action and entertainment. And that's what we get! Amazon will notify me when it's available on DVD.",1356652800,,2190,4.828418230563003
5508091,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Reacher, when not thinking too much, can be a kick-ass character. For the most part, So is this movie. The film allows the viewer to think and follow action , in a way most other contemporary action films, do not. Resonably logical, except for a throw down the gun and fight scene at the end, this was fun. Let's hope it makes enough money to follow up with another.",1356566400,8,366,4.318840579710145

As usual, Tom Cruise is getting picked on by many as not suitable for this role. And as usual, he's perfect. OK, so he's not 6' 5"" or whatever as portrayed in the novels from which the story is extracted. Still, author Lee Child is said to be fine with the casting.

Reacher (Cruise) is a highly decorated former soldier whose last job was a military detective. After his discharge Reacher disappears, for whatever reason. The film opens with an effective sequence of a sniper setting up in a high rise parking garage across from the Pittsburgh Pirates stadium. He manages to pick off 5 individuals seemingly at random, but also leaves enough clues that the police headed by detective Emerson (David Oyelowo) quickly arrest a suspect (Joseph Sikora).

Barr (Sikora) is severely beaten during a jail transfer. When first captured he asked his attorney (Rosamund Pike) to ""get Jack Reacher."" As it turns out Reacher finds Helen (Pike), her father (Richard Jenkins) who is also the DA and Emerson. Director and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie manages to lead the audience along with Reacher sifting through the clues with more attention than the police. McQuarrie even tosses in a couple Hitchcock-like ""McGuffins"" to complicate matters.

Clearly something is amiss and the film shifts gears into a corruption fed financial ploy. As the bad guys target Reacher, he goes into combat mode. He's highly skilled. As the primo gangster, Werner Herzog proves he's as effective in front of the camera as behind it. His Teutonic, one-eyed, fingerless take of a prison survivor is memorable. We do get the usual amount of gun play but it is mostly concentrated in scenes involving Reacher and an aging, newly acquired friend (Robert Duvall) attempting to rescue a kidnapped Helen.

The film may not be perfect as a couple of the scenes just seemed to be pasted in at the last minute to clarify something that happened earlier. But there are other surprises that keep things interesting and helps make this action/thriller a cut above the norm.  Highly recommended.

(BLU RAY UPDATE) August 20, 2016
With a new Jack Reacher film due in a month or two, I thought it might be fun to go back and watch the original which came out around Christmas, 2012.  I hadnt seen it since, but I liked it then and even more now on Blu ray.  As usual a second viewing provides an opportunity to pick up on little tidbits missed the first time around.

Director and writer Christopher McQuarrie draws the audience in from the very beginning when we see a lone gunman known as Charlie (Jai Courtney) set up a scoped-out rifle in a parking garage across the river from the Pittsburgh Pirates stadium.  A walking path between the stadium and river is flush with pedestrians and joggers.  Charlie scans the people left and right and we get to see them, all unexpecting innocents, young and old, male and female.  He then begins to pick them off one by one.

A suspect, Barr (Joseph Sikora) is captured quickly thanks to a fingerprint left on a quarter fed to a parking meter where his vehicle was parked.  Barr, a former Army sniper doesnt confess and asks that Jack Reacher be found to help him.  His attorney, Helen (Rosamund Pike) and her father, the D. A. (Richard Jenkins) are surprised that Reacher shows up unexpectedly.  Reacher is recruited to help Helen and he begins to look into the case.  His former military job was a detective and he worked to convict Barr of killing civilians in Iraq.

What makes this movie well above average is that Reacher, well played by Tom Cruise, brings to light small clues that begin to add up.  The audience tends to go along with him, not necessarily looking ahead or being left behind.  Were kind of feel like a partner and discover the revelations as he does.  Reacher is a mysterious individual both before and after the case is solved.  I look forward to the new movie.

This 2013 Blu ray package includes a DVD and a digital download.  The Blu ray comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  It is hard to say more than the transfer is perfect from both a visual and audio perspective.  Originally shot on 35 mm film, the disc maintains the look include excellent grain, modulated throughout the movie.  It is sharp, colorful and maintains excellent detail and clarity, even in the long distance shots, of which there are several.  A flawless presentation.

Likewise the DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 audio track is perfect.  The score and the excellent soundtrack are well presented and show up in all the speakers on queue.  Dialog is easily understood.  Gunshots ring out with proper clarity and differ in sound given the surroundings.  That is, the long distance shot from a parking garage sounds different than a long distance shot on an open gun range.  The video and audio are both demo worthy material.

Subtitles include French, Spanish, Portuguese and English SDH.  Extras include a commentary with Cruise and McQuarrie and another with composer Joe Kramer on an isolated musical score.  Featurettes include When the Man Comes Around, You Do Not Mess with Jack Reacher and The Reacher Phenomenon with the author Lee Child.",1356480000,4,5188,4.7952755905511815
5508093,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"**very minor spoiler on the first 10 mins of the movie only**

first off i will warn you. there is a pretty dark violent sceen at the begining where several innocent civilians are shot by a sniper in a lone gunman terrorism attack. it is very graphic and the average person is going to be bothered by it. this is not a kids movie, there is no part of this a child or even really a teen would enjoy.

non spoiler review - Tom Cruise plays Jack Reacher, a former Army Cop. Tom fights his way through conspiricy and bad guys with help of a defense laywer try to uncover what happened in a mass shooting involving a former military sniper. the movie itself is not a huge mind game, nor is there anything that is really un predictable but the ride to the end is pretty fun anyways. Personally i found a few of the sceens a little cheesy and un realalistic but it is definitly worth a view if you are interested in some of Tom's other movies like the Mission Impoissible's.",1356480000,,967,4.25

It takes place in Pittsburg, where a former military sniper appears to routinely pick off several people as they walk down the street.  When the police question him, all he can say is ""Get Jack Reacher.""

Through the investigations and the trists and turns, amid car chases and kick-butt action, we watch things unfold.  Tom Cruise portrays his usual great-screen image and the movie is well worth seeing.  Later in the film,you will understand how Jacker fits in.",1356307200,,542,4.774193548387097

5508098,3,B00AS1Q8FW,"This reviewer hasn't read the any of the Lee Childs books and had no preconceptions about the movie, which opens with a seemingly senseless sniper attack that kills five people. A rapid police response results in the arrest of a disturbed veteran and former sniper, who asks the police to ""call Jack Reacher.""  It turns out that Jack Reacher is a highly skilled former military policeman with authority issues and a willingness to go off the books to get justice.  Reacher reluctantly agrees to assist in the defense of the accused sniper, and quickly discovers the slam dunk case might be too good to be true.  Whoever is behind the setup reacts badly to Reacher's presence, sending a group of thugs to scare him off the case.  Reacher doesn't scare easily, but soon finds himself in a race against time to stop a ruthless conspiracy, before the conspiracy puts a stop to him...

The plot behind the killings is fairly complicated, and it will become obvious to Reacher and to the audience that someone involved with the case, whether the lead police investigator, the district attorney, or even the defense attorney, is working with the bad guys.  There are a series of exciting, if not very realistic, action sequences, in which Reacher beats up thugs, survives high speed car chases, and picks off the members of a nasty gang one by one.  Veteran actor Robert Duvall has a nice extended cameo as a former Marine and rifle range owner who gives Jack a hand.

Judging by some of the harsh reviews already posted, if you'r a fan of the Jack Reacher novels, this movie probably doesn't do it for you.  If you're a fan of Tom Cruise in the Mission Impossible franchise, ""Jack Reacher"" will probably turn out to be a decent little action flick.",1356220800,,1742,4.685245901639345
5508099,4,B00AS1Q8FW,"Having not read any of the Lee Child books, I watched this movie with fresh eyes. For those of you expecting something fun and over the top like Red or Knight and Day, this is not that kind of movie. That said, it is fun. This movie takes you on a journey with the characters trying to solve the mystery with more realistic action and scenarios than have been in most recent movies. It is more like an old-school cop movie like Bullitt or Dirty Harry. I really enjoyed this movie. My favorite part was the car chase. It was so refreshing to see a chase put together this way. The surround sound was amazing and put you right in the action. The movie had great acting, believable but awesome action scenes, and a well thought out plot. It also wasn't too predictable. I would say it was a good show all around. If you like movies that are awesome, watch this. Now, a note on content: This movie deserved the PG-13 rating it received. There was a little bit of swearing, including the token PG-13 ""F-word."" Also, if any of you are nervous about that part in the preview where you see that scantily clad woman, that is literally all you see. The bulk of the rating was for the violence, which this movie has in abundance. You see some innocent people killed, also there's some awesome hand to hand fights. Some of the killing\deaths were disturbing for my wife. Great movie overall, I was pleasantly surprised.",1356134400,4,1407,4.457364341085271
