I can only hope that DIC releases the rest of the episodes so I can avidly collect them too.",1089158400,4,261,4.458333333333333

7908659,5,B00000FYX9,I wish they would release the whole series on one set - its a great 90's throw back; cheesey and fantastic. Mummies Alive! was a good show that played around with Egyptians history and reincarnations. Again cheesey but really cute! The four episodes on the DVD were the first in the series - such a treat.,1429920000,2,305,4.464285714285714

7908665,1,B00000FYX9,"i'm not sure what contents this particular item is selling.  i'm interested, but i'm clueless since there's no desription about the episodes, or if it's a feature.",1210377600,4,163,5.037037037037037
7908666,4,B00000FYX9,"Mummies Alive! is indeed a great cartoon and is definitely a good purchase for anyone into the old-school semi-violent action cartoons in full 80's manner. However the DVD includes no more than 4 episodes which feels a little short, especially since there are no extras/easter eggs. Besides that, it's solid fun from beginning to the end; animation is picturesque, the voice acting is good and the storyline is entertaining. 4 out of 5*",1125964800,3,436,4.986301369863014
