1346614,3,B00004S5JI,"A bit cheesy and low quality audio and video make this short documentary not all that great. But, since the topic and some of the information is still interesting, it was worth the watch.",1345420800,3,187,4.529411764705882
1346615,2,B00004S5JI,"Please, if you know anything regarding Vlad Dracula you can tell McNally was living it up (even with bad teeth) He knows english, yet to make the CD more intruguing, he thought to use his german accent....poorly.  The only reason he wanted to make this, was for publicity. Florescu was more about History, but McNally was more on mixing the two:Mythical and real. WHY are there so many trying to incorporate the mythical man with Bram Stokers ""Dracula""  Can anyone with a PHD or MBA get anything right?  The woman who claims to be a decendent...yeah right..another publicity hound.  This was interesting to watch, but hardly about TRUTH.  Do not tell me that most of the writings about Dracula were made up by his enimies, and then try to use them as factual evidence abou him.  Please,that is like using the National Enquirer to write history?",1295049600,3,844,4.7465753424657535
1346616,1,B00004S5JI,This DVD was a waste of money.  The information was poorly presented and the DVD was not very well done. A couple of interviews with people from the area and lots of clips from Vampire movies but if you are looking for something new or interesting then you are out of luck.  I thought that with Polanski involved it might be good but there is no redeeeming value to this DVD.  Nothing new and very superficial and boring. I would put it on ebay for a dollar if it wasn''t that I would feel like I was cheating the buyer.,1109980800,29,520,4.18
1346617,3,B00004S5JI,"The tape is of good quality.  It gives a general overview of Vlad the impaler and Bram Stoker.  Don't expect a goldmine of details and information on either of the two men at 45 minutes in length it just doesn't have enough time.  It provides a few insights on how the vampire legends were started and what other physical conditions might have made them flourish.  It also delves into what inspired Bram to write his famous novel.  It will would be a nice addition to any video library with the exception that it is so short.  I would have liked much more detail.  The information that you get is generally accepted as accurate, but just not enough of it. A good tape for someone who has no knowledge of Vlad the impaler or Bram Stoker.  A little disappointing to someone who does.",979516800,3,781,4.450704225352113

1346658,4,B00004S5JI,"Could have used better editing to remove or explain discrepancies. I would also like to see a Vlad documentary use and explain his entire name Vladislav Basarab Tepes Dracula, including the rift in the House of Basarab. More importantly, I'd like to have mention of the fact that the Order of Dracul was founded to protect Christendom, rather than leaving it open to speculation and assumption that ""Order of the Dragon"" must mean they were up to something foul. I did like that the granddaughter explained the dual meanings of the word ""dracul"" and how later use of the name ""Dracula"" by some truly meant ""devil,"" rather than ""dragon"" because of Vlad's fearsome reputation. When addressing the death of his first wife, Elizabeth, the granddaughter speculates that she jumped to her death because she could not bear to live without her husband. While that may be true, it doesn't explain why the Turks would have sent her the false message that Vlad had died in the field. Another reason for her to have killed herself is that if Vlad was dead and the Turks came for her she would be raped and likely sold into slavery. That certainly puts Vlad's cruel tactics into perspective.",1462579200,,1178,4.779411764705882

1346660,3,B00004S5JI,This is a slow documentary providing historical perspectives of the original Prince and why he was used the begin the portrayal of Count Dracula.  It is interesting how people of the country still perceives him as a hero versus perhaps a barbarian. The interview with is great-grand-daughter (or great great great ....?) is interesting. She is much realistic about his character and provides some perspective. Versus the colored drawings and interviews which where mainly in another language. The pace was slow and difficult to keep my concentration due to the lengthy foreign language interviews.,1462147200,,597,5.351063829787234

1346663,2,B00004S5JI,I found very little of this informative.  The translations on the interviews were repetitious.

I didn't expect a Hollywood blockbuster, but it is more than I expected information and History wise. Learning about the man behind the myth as well as exploring how the myths came to be and why people thought the way they did, while these superstitions were being formed, was super interesting. Also I've never seen a modern day account of Transylvania and how the people there think and feel about the legends/myths.

I don't give this a 5-star because the color of the images has a green tint, but the interviews, the development of the plot and the excellent use of movie scenes and historical information side-by-side is very skillful and will help understand both the hero and the novel and related but independent from each other. The XV century was a bloody and ruthless time in Europe and Vlad did what he understood would work (and did work) to regain his throne and detain the Ottoman invasion (which successfully beat other European countries, reaching as far as Vienna, where the famous coffee was introduced by the Ottomans).  Having been a prisoner of the Ottomans as a teenager, and knowing their tremendous strength, he used tested methods but in a massive display of terror and successfully achieved Mehmet's retreat.

1346827,2,B00004S5JI,"**TRIGGER WARNING!**

I can't believe none of the other reviewers did not mention the real dead bodies in this documentary! This is highly unsuitable for children and parents with little vampire fans will want to look at this personally before allowing a child to watch this! Obviously, this is a documentary about the origins of Dracula so there aren't going to be any fairy princesses, but with Twilight and other vampire-based shows making something as gruesome as undead human creatures who use live human's blood to survive into a precious lovestory for tweens everywhere, I feel it's important to mention this!

In addition to graphically violent movie footage in this documentary, there is also footage of several REAL dead human bodies. You'll see a funeral procession in which a (presumably) embalmed corpse is shown. Later, the dead and extremely bloody bodies of an assassinated dictator and his elderly wife are shown for quite a long time. First we see them live and upright, being bound and lead to execution, then we see blood streaming from the head of the elderly wife and footage the dictator's body being checked by guards to be sure he is actually dead. It's disgusting and there is literally no warning. All this footage happens over a the monotonous voice-over, telling us about the overthrow of the government. There is no warning whatsoever about this footage, not even at the beginning of the film where there ought to be some sort of parental guidance warning or something!

All that being said, the documentary is informative if you know little or nothing about Vlad the Impaler and Bram Stoker's inspiration for Dracula. There is a lot of footage from the recent Bram Stoker film (the one with Keanu Reeves) as well as from some older movies. There's a lot of information which is really not very relevant to Dracula legend so I really feel as if it's put there as filler and it makes me wonder why, seeing as how vampire legend goes back so far. You would think they wouldn't need filler information... There's an interesting tidbit involving a man who believes he keeps vampires at bay with a trumpet, bells, and wreaths of garlic around his neck. He thinks his father was killed by a vampire and that he personally has met vampires. I honestly would rather have known his story than seen an elderly couple dragged into the street and murdered.

There is a very informative section to do with porphyria, a disease which causes one to be ""allergic"" to the sun and show other symptoms commonly associated with features of a vampire. This is actually quite interesting as far as a theory for why people thought vampires existed in the first place. Especially nests/covens/families of vampires, as porphyria is hereditary.

The sound quality is AWFUL. I had to turn the volume up twice the normal amount in order to properly hear some of the speakers, but then the music was super loud in some spots and I had to turn it back down. The picture quality is pretty bad too, and the color is way off. In the interviews the whole room, including the interviewee's skin, is either neon green or blue. Even some of the movie footage has a greenish cast. What? Why?

Skip this whole entire documentary and read a book instead!",1393200000,2,3244,4.7736185383244205
1346828,3,B00004S5JI,"My husband and I watched this streaming from Amazon Prime.  I had heard most of the facts about Vlad the Impaler before, but this was still interesting.  My biggest gripe was the strange coloring of the film.  Most of it looked green....I mean, when they interviewed McNally, he had bright white hair and green skin.  Really green.  It looked like it was filmed in black and white, then washed over with green watercolors.  The sound quality wasn't that great either, but the real distraction was in the coloring.  In reading the reviews, I haven't seen anyone else complain about this, so I don't know if it was something that affected only the streaming version.",1392249600,2,664,4.771929824561403
1346829,5,B00004S5JI,I gave this a 5 star rating because I feel that it told the true story of Dracula and offered some new information I didn't know about. Over all it was very interesting and I enjoyed how Dracula's descendents were included. Its amazing how a book of fiction can influence our perception of historical events. I highly recommend the documentary to anyone who is a fan of the Dracula story.,1389052800,2,388,4.557142857142857
1346830,3,B00004S5JI,"Cheesy as one person put it. But what does one expect? :) It was a good 44 minutes  the use of all there German off-putting, however.",1385596800,,133,4.115384615384615
1346831,4,B00004S5JI,"This is a pretty cool documentary.  If you don't know anything on the subject, it will give you a perspective on the historical Vlad.  They also do a good job of putting him in context with Bram Stoker, The Iron Curtain and even some very well displayed medical explanations of the Vampire mythos.
Maybe they intended to kick me in the gut in the end.  If so, they did a good job.  Showing a known child molester (Roman Polanski)making money by running a comedy on Dracula? I suppose it's proof that pure evil is undead today.  Well done, I suppose.",1381795200,,549,4.45
1346832,2,B00004S5JI,"Wasn't horrible, but wasn't great either. My biggest problem was actually with the sound quality. The music and sound effects were recorded at a very loud level, yet all voices were recorded at a very low level, making it very difficult to hear anything that was being said over the volume of the music. Was VERY annoying trying to hear what was being said.",1377388800,,357,4.59375
1346833,5,B00004S5JI,I bought this as a gift for a Dracula fan. She couldn't wait to get home and watch it. She was thrilled with it and said she wants to rewatch it with friend. It even had an intermission so she didn't miss a thing.,1360195200,,213,3.8636363636363638
1346834,4,B00004S5JI,A very informative documentary about the history of the Dracula legend. Includes many interesting facts about the real-life Romanian prince whom the famous character of Dracula was based on. A good watch!,1359590400,,204,5.40625
1346835,5,B00004S5JI,"This is somewhat old story of the true Dracula which had been told so many times. I like the telling of Dracula here, as I seen so many vampyre films and Christopher Lee, will always be my favoite Dracule, but the real Dracule is a real person not vampyre. It's just fun watching for me and I think others may find it fun as I did and learn abit, hope so.",1351296000,,355,4.014084507042254
1346836,4,B00004S5JI,"If you're curious how the whole genre got started, this does it. Quality of film work is PBS type/educational film type - not movie quality. Gives historical facts about death in the culture and era that seeded the vampire myths and not just about the historical figure that Dracula was based on. Think PBS informative and not movie entertainment.",1350086400,6,347,4.898305084745763

It appears to be a very bad transfer from someones VHS tape - recorded at home.  Don't waste your time.  A real stinker !!!",1500940800,,268,4.638297872340425
7921722,4,B00004S5JI,"Originally ordered for my ex wife I kept it after she left. It is a historical documentary that documents the life of the real man Vlad.  It exposes the fictions as well as the truths surrounding this person.

Is very good and historically accurate as far as I can tell but the video quality is sub par. The colors are very washed out. Looks like a poor transfer.

Still I like it because it is an accurate documentary. Little graphic and perhaps not for the squeamish but I liked it a lot and great value as it is free w prime.",1488672000,3,528,4.207920792079208
