For me the real highlight (actually it is all one big highlight) are the 2 songs by Nikki Lamborn.  Oh my... move over Janis Joplin there's a new girl in town.

A Little Help From My Friends

The sheer uniqueness off this concert tour makes this a must have in my collection of music DVDs. The incorporation of the magnificent and full orchestra with some of the great songs of all time is an absolute pleasure and thrill to watch and hear. Overall most of the songs are done very well with some blistering guitar work and some fantastic vocals. However the DVD left me a little cold in the end. The main turn off the vocals of Darlene love who started with a quite good version of Jumping Jack Flash, but continued to completely destroy great songs like let it be and ruby tuesday... and I will never understand why she insisted and screaming all the way through ""with a little help from my friends"" what happened to just singing the song the way its meant to be sung with passion. In my opinion she detracted from the overall quality of the performance. However it was not one person who left me a little empty by the end of the show, the sight of so many great stars on stage singing together such great songs should have been an unforgettable concert, and as good as it was I still believe most tracks were no where near the best versions I have heard live... with a couple of exceptions... Conquistador was fantastic, as was stairway to heaven (though the led zep version is obviously untouchable). Sound is very good in dolby 5.1 perhaps a little imperfectly mixed at times but very acceptable, video is excellent.

Overall very much worth getting for a good addition to anyones collection, hearing the songs played with a great orchestra is fantastic, just don't expect too much.",1126310400,,1877,4.61631419939577
7926460,5,B00004Y2QH,"Excellent video perfomance of a symphony performing rock classics,Nikki Lamborn singing with a symphony performing Led Zeppelin is great. Simon Townsend performs so much like Pete you expect it to be Pete up there. Zak Starkey great as usual. Roger Daltrey in all his glory, still the ultimate performer, spinning his mic and catching on cue, you don't expect this with a symphony backing you up. The instruments are stunning it makes you feel as if you are there, or you would want to go a performance. All the vocals are great for remakes, espacially if they weren't the orginal artist. I only wish there were more, hopefully they will come up with more tapes for us to view.",1009497600,4,677,4.697478991596639
7926461,5,B00004Y2QH,"Due to assisting a friend in a personal time of need, I missed this show during its L.A. run. THANK HEAVENS FOR VIDEO!!! Since purchasing this title (from Amazon. Com, of course) I have viewed this enough to where my do holds up a lighter in certain places.
Daltrey, Alice Cooper, Darlene Love, Gary Brooker and the other guests put on an excellent show. If I'm not mistaken, this is the show Daltrey did after suffering whiplash in an auto accident in Australia, which adds to the conviction and greatness of the the show.",1001203200,3,523,4.574468085106383
7926462,5,B00004Y2QH,"Amazing!. This presentation is an extraordinary summary of big successes of the history of the rock, of bands like Procol Harum, The Who, Led Zeppelin, Rolling stone and others. Also bill with participation of Roger Daltrey and Gary Brooker (vocalists of Who and Procol Harum) that give an incredible interpretation of their classics topics. Alice Cooper is another great singer. Darlene Love delights us with its incredible voice. All this accompanied by a symphonic orchestra of great level. It is to listen to it and to delight.",972691200,10,531,5.114942528735632
