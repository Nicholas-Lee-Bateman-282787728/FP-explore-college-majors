8031133,5,B0002S65IQ,I REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE A LOT. I HAVE ALWAYS LIKED THE ACTORS AND ACTRESS (EDWARD ASNER AND ILLEANIA DOUGLAS). IT WAS GREAT.,1457827200,,128,4.608695652173913
8031134,5,B0002S65IQ,"I got to have a part in this movie so I'm a little biased. We are the Color Guard at the end. I also got a close up. Also the story line of this movie is pretty cool, closure after many years of waiting for a family and the remains returned.",1426550400,,241,3.7450980392156863
8031135,3,B0002S65IQ,"This movie could almost be in the family film genre, were it not for the needless cussing present in the movie.  It is unfortunate that the writers included that because it really had potential.  The story focuses on a family, the male members anyway, getting together to search for the missing body of the brother who was killed in Vietnam.  The Father is at death's door.  The one brother is a decorated war hero who is still fighting his demons.  The other brother is well-to-do but somewhat scoffed at by the family due to his staying out the war in Canada.  And then there is the young son of the war hero who is trying to experience things.  All in all, the story line had lots of potential.  We learn a lot about what families go through to find their kin in Vietnam.  And we learn a lot about searching techniques.  It is worth the while, although, I was disappointed in the language.",1275177600,,892,4.41717791411043
8031136,3,B0002S65IQ,"Edward Asner portrays the patriarch of a family who gets word that the
remains of his son lost in the Vietnam War may be found.  He gathers his
sons and grandson and they go on an archaeological dig.  Robin Thomas is
especially fine as the brother who came home from the war a hero and Richard Cox is very good as the brother who fled to Canada rather than
serve  Adam Brody is Thomas' son.  This is a nice movie from an independent
film maker.  The cast probbly did it as a labor of love.  I don't rememeber
it ever playing in a movie theater in the Chicago area.  Thanks to home
video it can be seen.",1194998400,,602,4.094017094017094
8031137,5,B0002S65IQ,"""Is it Brendan!?!?""

These words should have automatically given Ed Asner a Lifetime Achievement Award for acting.

He gloriously marveled the screen and stole the end of the movie with his enthusiasm, charm, and compassion.

Very few movies can do this...but Missing Brendan brought me there.  I, too was searching for Brendan throughout the whole movie.

Highly recommended!!",1120608000,,377,5.431034482758621
8031138,5,B0002S65IQ,"if you like the oc, and adam brody like i do, you'll like this movie, cause adam plays another funny character even though it's a serious movie. and if you don't know or like adam brody it's still a really great movie anyway. i give it 5 stars.",1119744000,2,244,4.104166666666667
8031139,3,B0002S65IQ,"I saw the Missing Brendan DVD and Adam Brodys acting was excellent, very different than what you would think. He falls in love with this girl while his family is looking for his missing brother from Vietnam. It was a very touching story.",1101168000,3,237,4.534883720930233
8031140,5,B0002S65IQ,"Really shows Adam Brody can act. Other acting was really good too. It was both serious and had funny parts. I cried at the end.

was very well done.gave me a better idea of what viet nam is like now, and what my parents were dealing with back in the 60s.

I would defenitely recommend this to most.",1095033600,4,298,4.120689655172414
