7975858,4,B00007G1UH,"If you like cheesy 70's and 80's soft core skinamax type comedy's, the quality of the prints and transfers isn't great, 4 films in the set(BIKINI MED SCHOOL, BIKINI HOUSE CALLS, ILLEGAL AFFAIRS, BRIEF AFFAIRS) are a total waist and are basically the same early 90's vhs nonmovie reedited, but I enjoyed the rest of the films,SECRETS OF SWEET SIXTEEN is in the vein of the Schoolgirl Report films, SENIORS, GETTING WASTED,and INCOMING FRESHMEN are in the Porky's vein, but of course not as good. TOGA PARTY is a bizarre little low budget flick about a country boy becoming a rock star. THE HARRAD EXPERIMENT centers around a 70's college level sex psych class. The set has a good deal of softcore skin, and a few cheap chuckles. Not a bad set for the price, if your into these kind of flicks, and I am, but they really should have replaced the first four svhs nonfilms I mentioned with actual movies.",1313884800,2,899,4.590062111801243
7975859,3,B00007G1UH,"I bought this monstrosity only for one film, ""Toga Party,"" which is a really bad, poorly produced film that has nothing to do with toga parties.  It is a very funny little film, and the musical scenes are hilarious.  I do seem to recall watching the original VHS release years ago, and there being a brief Toga scene at the beginning.  Please, let's restore this film to the directors original vision!  Criterion, I'm looking at you!",1128038400,,433,4.657894736842105
