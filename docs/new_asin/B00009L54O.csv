8398521,3,B00009L54O,"This DVD has footage from the 2003 Players Club rally.  They show each day of the rally with some clips of people driving, then a bunch of random clips from some car show (set to techno) and people doing donuts in the snow (set to techno).  Lot's of techno music.  The saving grace of this DVD is that it has some great ""hiding from the cops"" footage.  Those segments make this DVD worthwhile.",1328918400,,393,4.342465753424658
8398522,5,B00009L54O,This DVD gives viewers a great look at some of the hottest exotics on ths planet along with some total hotties.  A few dull spots but mostly very entertaining and different look at the Player's Run Rally (similar to Gumball but smaller with better cars).,1200096000,,254,4.644444444444445
8398523,1,B00009L54O,"this video is very boring.  i was very dissapointed, for i liked the first version better.  all it is is a guy following expensive cars and travel across america.  no real action.  they went to some car shows (SEMA and Nopi) but no commentary, just crappy music.  there isn't even racing.",1080259200,6,288,4.568627450980392
8398524,4,B00009L54O,"i'll keep it simple if you liked the Mischief and Mischief 3000 you are going to enjoy this movie. If you you didn't then its more of the same,
you have been warned",1065916800,,164,4.0
8398525,4,B00009L54O,"Unlike Gumball 3000, this one is not just super cars on the highway.  The Players Run is undoubtedly Playa.  In addition to the ""Rally"" they make stops along the way and do events such as the the Bondurant racing school, indy car racing and some cool parties.  The cars are super sweet, and the hot german chick Simone is in it from gumball 3000.  The extra features are pretty good too.  Pictures, stupid stuff, german police reports are just as good and entertaining as the main feature.  I would recommend this DVD to all import and super car enthusiasts.  i have watched it multiple times in the first day i got it.",1060387200,8,619,4.473214285714286
