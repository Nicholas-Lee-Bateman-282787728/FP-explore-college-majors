8660664,1,B00KPY1U50,"The information is great, but the quality REALLY stinks.  Very grainy- it looks like an old VHS copied over and over.  For the price... what a rip off!  I even had to have the first copy replaced because it kept going back to the middle  of the way through.  The second copy at least plays all the way through, but I can't say enough about the horrible quality!",1420156800,4,361,4.25
