8338557,1,B001RPZDZ4,"After the mediocre playing of the should-be-wonderful overture, there is a  long, long, long section of dialogue,  then just when you think it couldn't be worse, the the singing begins.
Is the singing is awful on purpose--to be funny maybe? Maybe  the singers are  genuinely awful.
Who can tell, since they never sing any other way.
This opera? performance is so bad it hurts.",1260835200,10,376,4.828125
8338558,1,B001RPZDZ4,"After the very scrappy performance of the effervescent overture, it takes nearly 30 minutes of seemingly interminable ""acting"" until the first ""singer"" gets to sing. Be advised that the acting & singing are as amateurish as the playing by the orchestra. This DVD on the usually reliable Kultur label should never have been released. Embarrassingly bad.",1243296000,13,352,5.303571428571429
