4720727,4,B005LAIHHC,"This is raunchy comedy club humor brought to the big screen and it works about 85% of the time.  Saw it today, let me inform people firsthand the film DOES NOT make fun of victims of the 9-11 attacks, Muslims, or Christians. It DOES poke fun at cultural bias and stereotyping based on lack of understanding. It DOES poke fun at Bush/Obama era economic and foreign policies. It DOES ridicule misogynistic Middle Eastern attitudes regarding women. The supporting cast provides some great nutty contributions, particularly Jason Mantzoukas and Bobby Lee.",1337385600,5,551,5.122222222222222
4720728,5,B005LAIHHC,"Sacha Baron Cohen does a great acting job in his latest film, ""The Dictator."" The gags are mostly good and although some are tacky and racist (with a few being crude) it still held my attention on a very rough day for me because it works as a parody of dictatorships. There is little about the plot and the film that I can add to the reviews already posted here; but I can certainly vouch for other reviewers who write that the film is actually pretty good entertainment, a parody and nothing truly offensive even if Sacha Baron Cohen is very daring when it comes to topics for jokes and gags.

The plot is not terribly deep; but it moves along well and you shouldn't get bored. Sacha Baron Cohen (who plays the brutal dictator of the fictional, northern African country named Wadiya) surrounds himself with excellent actors all turning in convincing performances that make the film even funnier. Sir Ben Kingsley plays Tamir, the rightful heir to the dictatorship occupied by his apparently younger brother General Aladeen (Sacha Baron Cohen). Anna Faris is brilliant as Zoey, a Brooklyn, New York vegan small business food store owner who's liberal activism clashes sharply with Aladeen's ""take no prisoners"" and kill-`em-all policy whenever anyone disagrees with him. Nadal, a scientist ordered to create nuclear weapons for Wadiya, is well played by Jason Mantzoukas; his timing is just right and he supports Baron Cohen really well.

Soon after the film starts with some gags and basic introductions, General Aladeen is practically summoned to the United Nations. They want his assurance that he isn't developing nuclear weapons--otherwise they may use military force against Wadiya. Aladeen travels to New York with Tamir and an extensive entourage--but soon after that he is kidnapped and nearly killed in a very funny scene with one of my favorite actors, John C. Reilly, playing the would-be murderer. Tamir hopes that with the real Aladeen out of the way he can use a phony ""double"" for Aladeen and use the double to make Wadiya a democracy so Tamir can sell its oil to countries around the world, most notably America and China.

But what Tamir doesn't know is that Aladeen escaped being killed and wants nothing more than to gain back total control of Wadiya. Just how Aladeen and Zoey get to know each other and how Aladeen tries to win back control of his country is how the rest of the film plays out, complete with gags and jokes about anything Baron Cohen wants to tackle, including 9/11, blacks, Jews, Asians and just about anything else you can imagine.

All in all, if you liked Sacha Baron Cohen's other films, I think you will like this one. It is better than ""Bruno"" and while it isn't quite as good as ""Borat"" it's definitely funny. It managed to divert my attention on a rather stressful day and that's actually saying a lot. In addition, if you're new to Sacha Baron Cohen's sense of humor and you're not that easily offended, you should enjoy this film.",1337299200,87,2980,4.7805825242718445
4720729,3,B005LAIHHC,"This is Sascha Baren Cohen's first try at an actual scripted movie instead of a faux-documentary, and it's nice that he's trying new approaches to his satirical style of comedy instead of going through the motions on his approach. However the jokes started to feel like they were going through the motions; don't get me wrong, I love politically incorrect humor, Borat and Bruno both had my sides sore in laughter, but a few of the jokes in this one fell flat for me because it seemed like it was being crude for the sake of being crude.

For example, when Aladeen first learns how to masturbate it just wasn't really that funny to me, it didn't really push any envelopes and didn't add much to the story besides establishing that he's had the easy life before. Also when Anna Ferris and Aladeen hold hands inside a woman's vagina, it didn't really serve a purpose to the plot or the characters and just seemed like it was trying too hard. Also the crude racist FBI agent and the two Middle Easterners scaring Westerners on an air-craft felt very reminiscent of Harold & Kumar: Escape from Guantanamo Bay. Ben Kingsley's character felt underdeveloped as the main villain, and his character was rather forgettable, it's a shame Sascha B. Cohen couldn't write more jokes for his character.

So that's what I didn't like about it, but there is still a lot to like in the Dictator. I said some of the crude stuff didn't work for me however when Aladeen was on a zipline and had to 'lose weight' that part I found pretty funny since it was just so silly. I liked Anna Ferris' character, her bleeding heart liberal character was a sharp contrast to, well, a Dictator. The torture scene had me laughing hard, Aladeen's decision-making in his country was all pretty funny stuff, and who could forget the Middle Eastern music covering famous American songs? The Dictator is a pretty silly and fun movie if you don't mind politically incorrect humor and are used to Sascha Baren Cohen's style of humor. He's definately a genius when it comes to satire and parody, however this one just didn't do it for me as much as his other offerings.",1337299200,,2127,4.624338624338624
4720730,4,B005LAIHHC,"This movie was absolutely dirty, offensive, hilarious, racist, and crazy over-the-top moments. It's about the same style as  Sacha Baron Cohen's previous movies, but it's done much better. Cohen plays a silly ruthless dictator named Admiral General Aladeen. He is very anti-semitic and plans on creating nuclear weapons. He hates the very idea of democracy. While on his way to the United Nations, he's betrayed and shaven so no one would recognize him. He's taken in by Zoey, a vegan hippie, and gives him a job at her store. Will Aladeen make it to the U.N. to stop democracy from coming to his country, or will Zoey change his heart? I would definitely recommend THE DICTATOR!!!",1337126400,2,681,4.870689655172414
4720731,4,B005LAIHHC,"After establishing himself as a satirical force with Da Ali G Show, Sacha Baron Cohen took his style of free-form, guerrilla comedy to the big screen with the brilliant Borat, a film that turned him into something of a cultural icon. The film was sharp, topical, and unpredictable in a way many spoofs simply can't replicate. Keeping up that level of success proved to be harder than many thought, as Cohen followed it up with the terribly unfunny supermodel film, Bruno, that seemed to stumble in every way that Borat got right. The Dictator, while marketed as being a sort of spiritual and creative cousin to Borat, is a total departure for Cohen, as it relies heavily on traditional Hollywood storytelling and jettisons the unscripted stuff we've become so accustomed to. The change hasn't effected Cohen in the least, as The Dictator is just as incendiary and depraved as we all hoped it would be.

That's not to say the film has the insight of Borat, but it does show Cohen's deft ability to bring pointed, serious issues to light while hiding them under a thin veil of gross out gags, penis humor, and stunning political incorrectness. The firebrand of a closing monologue is a thing of genius, even if the message he's sending is an obvious and disturbing one. But that's getting ahead just a little bit, because there are an incredible amount of laughs to be had before reaching that point. Cohen plays General Aladeen, a hilarious Saddam Hussein knock-off who runs the north African nation of Wadiya with an iron fist. Born into power and demanding of his people's support, he's both vengeful and extremely petty, powered by years of privilege. He has the money to do basically anything he wants, like nail some of the hottest women in Hollywood. You either worship him as the leader or....well, the other option is pretty nasty. When the UN comes calling with claims of Wadiya fostering a nuclear program, Aladeen jets to New York with his security detail to try and head off any possible sanctions. When he arrives, he's naturally floored that our country is as free as it appears, while also noting some of the obvious hypocrisies. Not long after arriving, he's betrayed by his elder brother(Sir Ben Kingsley), who has him kidnapped and replaced by a moronic body double who will sign a UN agreement making Wadiya a true democracy. Why? So that Big Oil execs, all named after their corporate masters, can swoop in and buy up the oil fields for a hefty sum.

Presumed dead and shaved of his beard, the symbol of his rightful power, Aladeen is forced to try and acclimate to American culture while finding a way to stop the signing. The dictatorship must be protected at all costs! He becomes reluctant friends with a political activist named Zoey(Anna Faris), a vegan and a woman (*gasp*) who takes him in and gives him a job, even as he insults and demeans her right to her face. In fact, jokes about the perceived inferiority and unworthiness of females are probably the most prevalent of all in this film, although no group is spared Cohen's wrath. For once, we're treated to a spirited comedy that hasn't had all of the best gags ruined by trailers, which is a remarkable feat considering all that we've seen of the movie. Smartly, Cohen has chosen to use his gift for creating spontaneous controversy as a means of hyping the film, such as turning up at the Academy Awards as Aladeen, then promptly spilling ashes all over Ryan Seacrest.

Cohen is a master at eliciting uncomfortable laughter from situations we know are just plain wrong! When Aladeen and his reluctant compatriot, a scientist named Nadal(the perfectly cast Jason Mantzoukas), turn up at a funeral for an African-American man with hopes of stealing his epic beard, it's impossible not to hide your face at the racial firestorm that's about to be unleashed. No subject is taboo, and even the 9/11 tragedy is used to clever, comical effect. It's at times like this when Cohen is at his most dangerous, and it seems to sharpen his edge in a way. There's no doubt that many people are going to be turned off by this scene in particular, and it's hard to blame them. It's equally difficult not to respect Cohen's brazenness to go where nobody else would dare to. There are times when the film seems to stretch pretty hard to keep up the steady stream of gags, and it's at times like this when you wish Cohen would depart from the script and just go out and insult some ignorant bystander. Like most of Cohen's creations, Aladeen isn't a character you necessarily root for. He's more like somebody you love to hate. That said, he's as memorable and quotable as Borat was, and certainly less irritating than Bruno.

It helps that Cohen gets a ton of support from a fantastic supporting cast, another reason why this film succeeds where some of his improvised efforts haven't.  Mantzoukas is brilliant as Aladeen's accomplice, Nadal, a scientist who the dictator thought he had executed. Nadal is just the right prism from which to view Aladeen's character, a guy who has loyalty to the system Aladeen represents, but also has a good deal of hatred for the man himself. He also knows the true nature of Aladeen's heart, and manipulates him at every turn. Anna Faris is basically relegated to being the focal point for Cohen's verbal jabs(he calls her a ""lesbian hobbit""), and it takes some getting used to seeing her held back in such a way. A number of priceless celebrity cameos also swell the film's ranks, but they are also best left unspoiled. The most surprising scene stealer of all had to be MadTV's Bobby Lee as an ambassador who likes to exert his power in a very special kind of way. Again, something best left for you to discover yourself, but let's just say it involves some very interesting folks doing something unexpected.

As Cohen has branched off into more legitimate roles, such as co-starring in Martin Scorsese's Hugo, it's going to be interesting to see if it leads to a softening of his style. For now, The Dictator proves again that nobody is as outrageously offensive as Cohen, and we wouldn't have it any other way. ""Jachnun""!!",1336694400,5,6129,4.723364485981309

4720876,2,B005LAIHHC,"This movie could of been better if it wasn't written and acted by the guy who played Borat. In Borat the jokes were pretty lame and the only reason it got such great reviews was because it was outrageous. I honestly got bored by it. In this movie its sort of similar, the jokes were trying to hard to be funny without creativity added in them. Don't get me wrong I respect the actor but he needs to add more creativity in jokes and not try to hard to make it funny, There were a few scenes in this movie that were respectfully funny. Not creative, but respectfully funny as in its basically funny, but not laugh out loud funny. My sense of humor centers around creativity and things I haven't heard before sometimes. I have a dark sense of humor and this movie to people is dark humor, which it could be if it was made better and didn't try to hard to be funny, it was repetitive humor and basic. Offensive? to some people I guess. A laugh out loud movie in my opinion would be something like 21 and 22 jump street among others. Its hard to find comedy movies like that which I haven't seen, The idea of this movie could be used in a much more creative and funny way. I don't want to bash the actor of the movie it's just my opinion, I'm not hating, I'm trying to respectfully point out things. If you are like me then this movie won't amuse you, but if you can't find anything else comedy related to watch and are like me where you are skeptic about watching this yet don't have anything better to watch then this movie isn't that hard to sit through, its entertaining but won't likely make you laugh out loud, the comedy is sort of stupid too. I was able to watch the whole thing where when I sat through Borat I got very bored of the repetitiveness, I convinced myself Borat was funny but later realized I was lying to myself, Id recommend this if you are bored and don't have anything better to watch.",1504396800,,1905,4.236263736263736

It was original, truly funny in many places, and provided an uncomfortable insight into several aspects of the American character.  Cohen's follow-up&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brno/dp/B002TL08FU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brno</a>, however, fell flat as it was essentially the same joke - an outrageous foreigner playing the unsuspecting locals for saps, but to make an impression on audiences, it had to be even more over-the-top and ridiculous.  It failed because it was trying too hard and was too self-conscious.

Fortunately, Cohen is now too well known to be able to pull off yet another stunt in that vein, so he abandoned it in favor of a straight-up comedy.  The result isn't much better, and while it might have been possible to fool enough people into playing along with the possibility that they were meeting a real, deposed Middle Eastern dictator, we instead have a script that plays it safe by trying to mimic the results of improvisation.  This has never worked, and the script that imagines the effect of inflicting a blatantly arrogant, hateful, and misogynistic cretin onto the denizens of New York City comes across as completely unbelievable, especially the love interest that occupies most of the screen time.  The convoluted ""political"" segment of the plot is as ludicrous as can be expected in what is supposed to pass for a comedy, although Cohen manages to squeeze a speech in toward the end that might qualify as social commentary.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Great-Dictator/dp/B004NWPY7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Great Dictator</a>, it's not.

Three things that we didn't care for in The Dictator were the f*** word spoken by Cohen (not necessary) and the reference to what the Dictator does to little boys that makes them kill themselves and/or cry:  clearly child abuse/child porn which the movie seems to infer (detestable, gross, and illegal--and never funny).  Shame on Paramount Pictures for promoting child abuse!  Why couldn't the Dictator refer to bullying or else knocking them over as he did with the little boy in the market which was very funny.  And the reference to men receiving oral sex from other men (redundant)--however, there is a lesson contained in here, too.  The oriental official struck it right on the nose:  It isn't about sex, it's about the power!!  Then at least 2 references to semen, one on walls and another on computer keyboards, neither are needed.  So there we go.  Otherwise, this movie has its funny moments.  It but is mostly scripted and the acting  is marginal at best.  Would have preferred to see the version available at theatres rather than this Banned & Unrated version of child abuse and oral sex.

4721038,3,B005LAIHHC,"I did some checking on Sacha Baron Cohen's other films, most of which I have seen, to discover why he keeps making these gross out, overt the top comedies. Bank, folks, he makes serious bank. He spent a load of money making this one, some $65 million but it turned out just fine because even with this heavy load up front he brought it in with $179 in world wide box office. To be fair, in the one hour and 23 minute long movie only about five minutes worth of film disgusted me, so that's not so bad.
A lot of his humor consists of making remarks that are shocking because we cannot utter them in polite company. I will not repeat the remarks here but many of us can call up slurs on our Arab brethren. His character is a middle east dictator with no redeeming virtues at all. He is a torturer and a casual killer-none of which we take seriously, it is all done in such a broad lampoon that we know he is just kidding around.
He has brought in a collection of big stars, or sort of big stars, to help him. Anna Faris plays the urban modern young American woman who falls for him. Ben Kingsley, John C. Reilly and Megan Fox round out the famous names. In various combinations he uses them to poke fun at  contemporary urban hipsters and savagely slams his fellows in the acting community.
This one hour and 23 minute very R rated comedy has a lot to offend most people. He does have some funny bits and I bet he could exclude his worst excesses and still write and film some humor for us. Bet he does not reduce the cringe worthy stuff in his next film. It is what he does.",1486944000,,1573,4.1743421052631575

There is only one way to say it: this is a fairly stupid movie. The only tidbit that I appreciated was a speech towards the end when Mr. Cohen wonderfully and satirically compares dictatorial actions to those taken by the U.S. government during the Bush administration. I will not spoil the details here: it is for me the only scene that redeems this movie.",1479513600,,486,4.47191011235955

On the bright side, it's a light hearted film that won't give you a headache trying to realize the plot (whatever it is).

On another note, I found it sort of boring when ""Aladeen"" tries to find his humanity.  I prefer this character to remain a jack-ass, because it's what makes it funny.",1454544000,,645,4.672566371681416

The heroic story of a dictator who risks his life to ensure that democracy would never come to the country he so lovingly oppressed. Or the story of a dictator who is stranded in the America  the country he hates  without his identity but all of his attitude.

Intermittent laugh-out-loud moments don't disguise the fact that this is a hit-or-miss affair. Imagine Coming To America with outright vulgarity: its sort of funny but not always in a good way.

-Are you having a boy...or an abortion?

-Oppressed at last, oppressed at last!

- Have you seen a water birth?
  No, but I've seen a water death.
  Oh. Was it moving?
  There was very minimal movement.

4722236,4,B005LAIHHC,"Wow!  People get so bent over movies involving Sacha Baron Cohen!  We all know that he's Julien, the king of the Lemurs in Madagascar, right?  Ooops!  People are going to start hating on those movies too. Worst movie ever seen, witnessed, heard of, acknowledged!!!!!  Really?  What vexes me the most is when imbiciles view a movie starring an actor that is risqu, demented, brash, socially-retarded, or villainously hilarious and then get all upset because they were insulted by the subject matter.  Borat rings a bell.  The Dictator is not The Notebook, it's not The Wizard Of Oz, and it certainly isn't anything Hitchcockian in nature.  It's a Sacha (say it with me) Baron Cohen movie about a ridiculous dictator, General Haffaz Aladeen in Wadiya (a fictional country located in the Horn of Africa) who gets deposed while visiting NYC and the United Nations.  It mocks leaders like Kim Jong-Il and Un and Muammar Gaddafi, Idi Amin, etc...  On the run from people that want him dead, Aladeen runs into Zoey (Anna Farris) a hipy-dippy feminist organic green-grocer who seems to attract refugees like a magnet.  Although Aladeen had no intention of making Wadiya  democratic, he convinces Zoey that is his intention, but first he must get back into the UN before it's too late.  This movie is funny on so many levels.  Sure it mocks tender subjects, but they need to be mocked.  Hilarious.  Snappy.  Chockful of subject matter that will make certain people stark raving mad.  Like Borat, this movie pokes fun in all directions at once.  Nothing is sacred.  If you can't sit back and laugh at the scary, despicable world then you are way too uptight and a nice mindless action movie might go over nice with you instead.  If you wanna laugh and you don't have a stick up your booty, enjoy another mischievous Sacha Baron Cohen movie.

4722333,4,B005LAIHHC,"The Dictator features Sacha Baron Cohen in an acting role as a Qaddafi-like figure (he even has a golden gun) who comes to New York, falls in love and becomes slightly human.  Cohen is no longer trying to fool anyone into thinking that he really is Borat, Bruno or Ali G.  Cohen is an incredibly gifted and brilliant comedian who has made a career of provocative risk-taking humor experiments.  He thrives on skating on the edge.  The Cambridge-educated Cohen claims to have been sued more than any other living actor and it could well be true.

The movie begins with a moving dedication -- ""In Loving memory...Kim Jong Il""!

Cohen then proceeds to rip the dictator lifestyle.  The film is allusive to Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator"" which mocked Hitler prior to World War II.  One could also compare it to The Emperor's New Clothes with Ian Holm about the taming and domestication of another dictator, Napoleon.  I found The Dictator incredibly funny.

Cohen is ably assisted by Anna Faris who plays a somewhat butch organic market owner based in Brooklyn and his inevitable love interest.  She has appeared in the Scary Movie parodies among other films.  Ben Kingsley of Gandhi fame plays Cohen's scheming rival for power.

There are brief hilarious cameo appearances with Gary Shandling and Megan Fox.

The key to all good comedy is good writing and this movie has it in spades.

The conclusion of the movie is marred by a rather tedious scene in which Cohen would appear to endorse the bromides of the scruffy Occupy Wall Street crowd.  There is also a brief cheap shot at Dick Cheney.  These are balanced out by the rough treatment meted out to the tofu and spouts eating crowd in the Faris scenes.  For those with delicate sensibilities a warning: Whole Foods is mocked and derided!

The movie, while being consistently funny, does also touch on some incredibly serious topics such as nuclear proliferation, violent hatred of Israel, the danger of Iraq, racial and gender stereotypes.  By far the greatest question raised, however, is the broader question of tyranny.  What drives a tyrant?  How can the rest of the world deal with the reality of tyranny in our troubled world?  What happens when tyranny acquires technology that gives fuel to megalomaniacal dreams of conquest and destruction?

Another dictator, Napoleon, once said, ""From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a single step.""  The Dictator, however, suggests that from the ""ridiculous to the terrifying may also be but a single step.""

It's all really scripted, so it loses its charm really fast.  It devolves into a familiar hack comedy in many scenes.  Cohen could have weaved a lot of the candid antics for which he is a known genius.  Unfortunately, the movie is largely a tame comedy.  Worth watching?  Yeah.  Once.

You expect much better from a comedic and chameleon genius like Cohen.  The Dictator is better than a lot of other comedies produced by the hack-choked Hollywood machine.  But don't expect Borat or Bad Grandpa quality laughs.",1408320000,3,635,4.787037037037037

4723602,5,B005LAIHHC,"Sacha Baron Cohen best work by far. Although for the plot they use the old hollywood royalty ""switcheroo"" scenario, Baron takes on it, with all his brutal rawness, talent and gusto, will keep you laughing your ass off for most of the movie. Very relevant nowadays political topics are covered on it with such hilarious tones that there is nothing else to do but totally enjoy the ride. All the actors, including the small support extras in this movie are top notch proven comedians and they all help Baron carry the ball all they way to the goal post. I am very surprised by some of the negative reviews given by some people to this movie. All I can say about them is that some people definitely get offended very easily. For those that know Sacha Baron's comedic style and know that there is no barrier for this guy... and for those that fully understand what life's parodies are all about, you all will find this movie a total blast. Kudos for the producers. This is one of the funniest movie I've seen for a while.

It hurts so good the laughs. Sacha baren has perfect delivery and can be a great actor when he finds the right role. I love sacha in this, I love anna , I love sacha's chemistry with Jason Mantzoukas . I can see why people would not like this film because it really is offensive in a lot of ways if you don't get the jokes or don't have a sense of humor or can't take a joke because it has a lot of racism, stereotyping etc. I loved it though. you can't take yourself too serious . if you can lay back and just enjoy the film an dlaugh it's a 5 star laugh feast. I loved it and today I watched it again and felt compelled to write a review as I always do when I feel the overall rating doesn't reflect the film in my eyes because I 95% of the time agree with the amazon ratings for movies.

4724266,5,B005LAIHHC,"I'm going to start off this review by just being honest: I loved this movie. I laughed my entire way through it. It's offensive. It's absurd. It's hysterical. It's definitely not for everyone, but I appreciate all of Sacha Cohen's work. If you're not familiar with what he does, then perhaps this movie isn't for you. But if you can appreciate an off-beat, politically inspired, offensively hilarious film- then this is the right choice.

The Dictator takes you on the journey of a dictator of a northern African nation called Wadiya, who after years of surpressing his people and bragging of uranium rich weapons- is challenged by the United Nations to attend a sanction in New York City and announce his approval of democracy rather than dictatorship. Once in America his chief advisor, greedy for Wadiya's oil wealth, has the dictator ""Aladeen"" killed. Alas, Aladeen is not killed, but has had his beard shaved- which causes him to be unrecognizable. His chief advisor replaces him with a stunt double Aladeen, who is to make Wadiya a democracy and allow free oil trade in the country. But, the real dictator does not want his country to become a democracy and hitches a plan to show everyone his true identity, and prevent Wadiya from becoming anything but a dictatorship.

Along the way Aladeen meets Anna Ferris's character- a feminist, non-racist, non-prejudice, fem lit major who runs an organic, anti-sexist, anti-big business, fair trade grocery store. Did you get all that? Me neither. She's the epitome of the modern day 20-something democratic extremist. She's all about equality. And ya gotta love her for that. Of course, Aladeen cannot even begin to comprehend all of this equality nonsense. Which makes their relationship hilariously entertaining to watch develop.

The film is quite offensive at times. It openly discusses topics such as abortion, sexism, female oppression, oil wealth and the greed associated with it, and of course dictatorship- with a few references to Islamic politics. What I find really hysterical is the fact that although the dictator is an absolute terrible person, he is- in many ways, comparable to the horrible people all over the world. There's one scene I especially love that pokes fun at the racial stereotypes developed by 9/11. Aladeen and his assistant are in a helicopter tour, talking about a subject in their native tongue. But the only words the white tourists can understand are '9/11, 2012, Empire State Building, Boom boom boom, and 5, 4, 3, 2, 1."" All of these words are skewed against an entirely innocent conversation- but of course, the white Americans are utterly paranoid of the non-English speaking northern African tourists that they absolutely freak out about this discussion. This, I thought was brilliant- as it so hysterically portrays the typical racist mindset of so many Americans after 9/11. It's sad, but true. And I found it hilarious. This is just one of the many examples of Sacha Cohen's brilliantly subtle ploys at picking fun at modern American faults.

All in all I thought the movie was ridiculously well done. It was hilarious, with just the most PERFECT ending. Spoiler Alert: In the end Aladeen very cleverly (and not purposely) describes Dictatorship in a way that so closely compares to our modern democracy. It truly leaves you thinking ""How different are we from other suppressed nations (most commonly found in the middle east)?"" Just ridiculously brilliant. Ah! I love Sacha Baron Cohen. Just another of his brilliant works. I'm such a fan! Definitely recommend for people interested in a politically-driven film that is played out in an absolutely gut-wrenchingly funny way.",1400630400,17,3670,5.071192052980132
4724267,5,B005LAIHHC,"Sasha Baron Cohen at his best.  An excellent satire of American post-9/11 political and international misadventure. Less offensive and more cerebral (yes, I said it) than much of Cohen's previous work, but still plenty of out-there offensiveness to satisfy Cohen's fans.

The Dictator is nothing like Borat, and more like a very boring Ali G In Da House. Unlike Borat, where it seemed... realistic? Plausible - that's the word - where the plot seemed plausible, the plot is pretty contrived and totally unbelievable. The whole thing just *feels* like a 90 minute sketch.

The first ten minutes are funny enough, and then it just goes down the drain after that. Save your time, this is only ""offensive"" in the sense that the jokes are laboured, predictable and boring. And also, sometimes just needlessly offensive without actually being funny. Because without comdiec timing or flair, a controversial ""racist"" joke just comes out as plain racist.

There was no redeeming value in this movie. I can use six letters to describe it. ""Stupid."" Although I am not a guy, the idea of this even being a guy movie is pushing it. After waiting to see something good, it became apparent there was no good, saying bad would lift it all the way to a one bag.

This movie is filled with lewd moments that are either nude or nearly nude such as a zipline cut where the main character ends up displaying his genitals on a window. Not funny. The main character is in contrast with the good nature of the supporting characters, which makes the main character's near value twist a farce.

I'll try to find words for it, but there's a kind of humor that pulls laughter out of you in a nervous ""OMG"" fashion.  Many movies attempt this and fail (Dumb & Dumber comes to mind).  It's simply *not* just crass idiocy.

I so want to dissect this movie scene by scene for you, but it will absolutely ruin it, and the frenetic 1-2 punch style of the delivery is centric to this.

Don't get me wrong: This is not a cerebral movie.  But what it ALSO isn't is an unthinking collection of grotesque humor.  It's really amazing, and quite frankly there's an ""I don't know what's wrong with my opinions"" innocence to the protagonist (antagonist?) that I can't *quite* put my finger on that works so well.

I consider myself a movie buff.  I appreciate the careful way timeless movies are crafted.  And I loathe shlock 99-cent-bin films.  But this is *not* that.  This is truly worth it.

Much to my surprise, it definitely had some literal LOL moments in this movie.  The overall experience was humorous enough, with only a few ""they should have left that scene out"" moments.  The scenes from the olympics, the helicopter ride and a few others were surprisingly funny.  I do not literally LOL very often at all, but this movie had a few surprisingly funny moments.

4725462,1,B005LAIHHC,"It was written and acted by a JEWISH person, SACHA BARON  COHEN , who was half Welsh and half Iranian.

so we should expect so much racism and hates and grudge against Islam, which happens from every JEWISH person in the world,  and willing to DISTORT the picture of islam and muslim values.

I think the idea of this movie  is to distort the picture of muslims , rather than humour and make us enjoy the show.

I encourage  everyone to watch  any other funny movies, instead of wasting their times on watching hateful, not funny movie like this one.

What a lot of people fail to realize this whole movie was a set-up for his famous 'dictatorships aren't so bad' speech. He was clearly taking a political jab at how America has evolved from what we used to think was a representative democracy, but it's been slowly turned into a dictatorship ruled by lobbyists and corporate interest. He spells it out in his speech with the parallels of how it is, versus how we think it's nothing like a dictatorship. But he's right, and a lot of people don't get it, or want to face it. The illusion of ""Free Elections"" is really the opiate for the masses, to allow us to believe we are making a choice, when the choices are already laid out before hand. This movie aims to shed light on that through humor, and using a fake country with a fake ruler that has all the hallmarks of many actual dictators from other real countries.",1389484800,,1056,4.253731343283582

The movie treats political correctness in a manner reminiscent of Blazing Saddles, and with roughly an equal number of laughs. There is a big difference however; between a story that contains some crude moments - and a story that might have been written around crude moments.  Does contain a bit of HARDCORE political satire, but even that is not worth the obsession with human bowel movements etc.  I give it one star for GUTS: Making fun of big oil AND the recently deceased dictator of North Korea (the only country in recent history that has publicly threatened to  launch nuclear tipped missiles at the United States) DOES display a lot of guts.

I laughed a handful of times, nothing too hilarious to the point where it hurt and I've laughed at non-movies that have done this without even trying. Midway through the movie, I caught myself, thinking, ""this isn't as good as I expected it to be."" But overall, it did entertain me. There are a lot of stereotypes in this film that were funny but it just illustrates how Hollywood keeps holding onto these stereotypes and gross depictions because they can't come up with any contemporary funny material. If you took out the stereotypes that Hollyood's been playing up for many years, people would be rioting at how bad this film was because essentially nothing would be in it. But it did entertain me.

I did like the humorous irony pointed out by General Aladeen where he discusses America and its ways/similar characteristics to dictatorships and tyrannical forms of government from concentrating the nations wealth to 1% of its population to bailing out the wealthy when they gamble and lose to ignoring and disregarding the poor's health and education to creating the appearance of a free media controlled by a few individuals to wiretapping phones and torturing prisoners to having rigged elections to lying about waging (immoral and evil) wars to overwhelmingly filling prisons with a people of a certain racial background and no one would object or complain to this to using the media to intimidate and scare people into supporting government policies that are inimical and adverse to their interests.

4726676,4,B005LAIHHC,"THE DICTATOR, it has to be said, is an extremely funny film.  Sacha Baron Cohen has undertaken the task of attacking those demigods who consider themselves both impregnable and supreme, running their tinpot dictatorships.  He is largely successful in his task; his Aladeen comes across as incredibly narcissistic, whose philosophy is simple - execute people first, and ask questions later.  The film has him coming to the United States to address the United Nations; this gives director Larry Charles the chance to make some trenchant points about so-called 'democratic' societies which, in their way, are almost as repressive as Aladeen's.  Some of the jokes are extremely vulgar, but delivered with an lan that renders all criticism impossible.  Ben Kingsley copes well with the thankless task of acting as Baron Cohen's foil, while Anna Faris is a feisty love-interest.  Not the most memorable comedy, perhaps, but certainly an entertaining one.",1373846400,,948,5.328859060402684

4726762,2,B005LAIHHC,"This film came across as an early second draft - lots of good ideas that haven't quite jelled. Sacha Baron Cohen played Admiral General (ha-ha!) Aladeen, the ruthless Arab-ish dictator of the east African country of Wadiya. He loves grand titles, overly-decorated uniforms, giving himself awards, his golden limo and his retinue of red-bereted, gorgeous female bodyguards. So, the film is set up to be an over-the-top satire about excess of power in the Arab world. But it kind of goes nowhere.

Imagine Borat with a love story attached. That's what you have here. A weird pairing of a violent, domineering, sexist, abusive and racist tyrant with his polar opposite - Zoey, a peace-loving, armpit-hairy feminist and natural foodie. The combination does not work. Aladeen insults Zoey and all women, and she just finds him charming. The film can't seem to decide whether to play Aladeen as a bad guy or a nice one. He sentences many people to die. He admits to having sex with small boys. He has sex with legions of prostitutes. He threatens the West with nukes. But he is redeemable because he is lonely (shades of Team America!) and falls in love with a working girl?

The film is not a total loss. The scene in which Aladeen tries to deliver a baby (and leaves his cellphone inside Mom) was fun, if not actually funny. His argument with a CIA torturer (about who had the latest pain-inflicting devices) was almost topical. But so much was left undeveloped. His solid gold limo was a great visual, but was not put to use. As were his hotalicious body guards, who were good for only one sight gag, where an idiot shepherd tries to milk them.

""The Dictator "" is a mess of unfunny crudity, gross out humor, a ridiculous plotline, pointless ethnic jabs and missed opportunities at satire - or just plain comedy. Some bits are so tone-deaf and badly written (prime example: the helicopter ride with 9/11 references) that even the cast could not possibly have thought them funny. His big speech at the end (using actual American political reality - e.g., ""You could let 1% of the people have all the nation's wealth"" -- as the way a true dictator should act) was preachy and out of place.

SBC is a gifted artist. But next time, he really needs to ditch his ego before inflicting another travesty on the public like this vile klunker.",1373587200,,2330,4.689486552567237

4726846,3,B005LAIHHC,"Warning! Spoilers ahead.

There is some funny slap-stick humor. For example, when Aladeen (played by Sacha Baron Cohen) was told to take the garbage out. He took the garbage bin and...

There is also some dark humor. For instance, the scene where Aladeen looked at the window of a store in New York, talking to himself ""Why is this happening to me? All I ever did were stealing my country's wealth and executing people who disagreed with me. Why does it always happen to the good guy?"" (I don't remember the exact words but these are very close to what he said.)

However, it's very difficult to rate this movie because of its extremities. It vividly illustrates the word ""extreme"". Yes, many of the jokes are so over-the-top that they were either very funny or very disturbing.

Case in point, at the 31st minute,in the grocery store named Free Earth Collective, he made politically incorrect comments and jokes that might deeply offend women and immigrants.

Another example, at the 53rd minute, in the grocery store, he made fun of one of the taboo subjects that might cause extreme discomfort.

The scene when he helped with delivering the baby was too much for me. At first, instead of helping the woman, he tried to have sex with her! To me, it looked like a rape attempt. It's very disturbing. Then he spent hours trying to deliver the baby and talking on the phone at the same time. It's disgusting.

According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are the financial figures of this film:
 Production Budget: $65 million
Domestic:  $59,650,222
+ Foreign:  $117,897,130
= Worldwide:  $177,547,352

So, it's a big flop in North America. It lost about 5 millions. However, it made a profit of $111 million dollars overseas. That's a huge amount.

Because of all the reasons above, I gave it 3 stars.",1372896000,,1798,4.742765273311897

4726900,3,B005LAIHHC,"I was so shocked that I actually liked THE DICTATOR.  Though I did like 'Borat', I found Sacha Baron Cohen highly irritating in 'Hugo' (a film I didn't like, anyway, though), and I always found the commercials for 'Bruno' more annoying than anything else.  But when I saw Cohen in 'Les Misreables' I loved both him and Helena Bonham Carter so much, I had to try this film.  And was hugely surprised that it had an actual, linear storyline, instead of seeming like a bunch of spontaneous or ad-libbed ""interviews"" featuring yet another of Cohen's bizarre characters!

Here Cohen plays Hafez Aladeen, hateful, oppressive, uncaring (and kind of stupid) leader of the republic of Wadiya, over which he rules with an iron hand - and lots of punishment for anyone who even annoys him.  Called to New York City to speak in front of the UN about his shady dealings with Wadiya's nuclear weapons program, Aladeen ends up in trouble when his second-in-command Tamir (the awesome Ben Kingsley) betrays him, replacing Aladeen with a double while also inadvertently getting Aladeen himself tossed onto the mean streets of NYC - where the evil dictator immediately meets/clashes with Zoey (Anna Faris), a left-wing feminist revolutionary determined to make her ""cause"" known during Aladeen's visit to the States.

The film even gets a bit rom-com, between Aladeen and Zoey, but Cohen lovers needs not fear - there are PLENTY of off-color jokes and sight-gags on hand, some maybe determined to test the gag reflex.  The jokes are hit and miss, but Cohen certainly throws everything into the pot, and overall while not great this is an enjoyable enough off-color comedy that keeps Cohen's blue humor a bit in check, even as he works in his usual ad-libbed bizarreness when he can.  Not great but worth a look, and definitely (I feel) a step up from Cohen's usual fare.

(Just an FYI, I did NOT see the ""Banned and Unrated"" version, just the regular R-rated version released in theaters; I hear there are significant changes between the two, so will be catching the unrated/banned version when I can.  For now, this was enough!)",1372636800,,2111,4.855153203342619

It shows that Cohen knows a lot of other comedians and just put them in the aladeen places.  Script was aladeen, but we all know that the plots to Cohen's movies are somewhat aladeen and to be taken with a grain of salt.

4727039,3,B005LAIHHC,"I should say I'm not a Sacha Baron Cohen fan. Most of his material strikes me as a failed SNL sketch. But there are parts of this film that are so funny, they had me thinking ""funniest thing since Monty Python.""  Those parts, however are few and far between.

The opening is stale, nothing new and not that funny. But about 2 minutes into the film, I'm grinning. A few minutes later, I'm laughing. This is the part where we learn that Admiral General Haffiz Aladeen of the country of Wadiya edited the country's language, changing 300 words to 'aladeen.'  Including the words 'positive' and negative.' So picture some poor sap trying to learn the results of his HIV test.  A brief period of lameness follows, which brings us to the six minute mark, where Wadiya's nuclear bomb is revealed. It is beyond funny. So in the first eight minutes, you are alternatively shaking your head at the lameness and laughing your head off. After this, however, there is only an occasional laugh. Even my co-viewer, who claims to be a SBC fan, admitted that the real laughs were a little thin on the the ground.

There is a plot, but it's not important to the enjoyment of the film. Did you see ""Coming to America?"" Combine that with ""The Price and the Pauper"" and any Three Stooges short and you pretty much get the picture.

Some reviewers believe that anyone who doesn't find the movie funny doesn't get ""sarcasm."" I think we do, although some of us call it satire, which implies funny.  And in The Dictator it is. Three or four times. But mostly, it isn't.  The unfunniness is so egregious, it hurts.  SBC tries too hard to squeeze in too many laughs. I mean, come on, how funny is referring to ""The Real Housewives of Schwarmaharadarajan?""  Or peeing into a pitcher and then drinking it? It's pointless...even in a satire, characters have to behave reasonably. I think Cohen approached the movie the way bad soup makers make soup: if they find it in the refrigerator, it goes in the pot. If it popped into Cohen's head, he added it to the script. Sometimes a little restraint is not a bad thing.

Cohen is hilarious and there are a lot of little moments that make this great (A genial nose rub, talk about a splash guard for a torture device (Youll ruin your shirt!), etc.

Yes, sure, it is probably offensive and makes jokes about sensitive issues like 9/11 and Bin Laden, but its hilarious all the same (""When they shot his double...."" And to see the look on the American's face when he heard that! The little moments are priceless).

I think most of the bad reviews come from people who are too stuck up or sensitive, because Cohen is a joy to watch in this.

 The end has a wonderful dialogue comparing a dictatorship to America. Cohen explains all the benefits of a dictatorship, why he doesnt want to give it up for a democracy, because of what you can get away with. A lot of what he says is happening in America already, a very eye opening scene.",1370908800,3,985,4.336956521739131

Why not poke fun at ourselves?  Sacha Baron Cohen manages to highlight the ridiculousness of the world around us and draws us in to looking at things a different way.

4727280,3,B005LAIHHC,"Cohen is not a fool.  He has riddled his movies with hypocritical insights of the caucasian and middle eastern varieties.  The one common theme and quite possibly what he draws his most humor from throughout the entire movie is the second class position of women in modern society regardless of nationality.  His intentions are not completely virtuous.  He pushes the limits of sexual exploitation to commit his humor and his theme to one's memory.  I found myself rolling my eyes at his story telling quite as frequently as chuckling at his humor.

I found the dialogue to be sophomoric and the acting wooden.  The story itself is so predictable.  It is as if the writers of the story watched Ricky and Lucy Ricardo, Ralph and Alice Cramden, Rob and Laura Petrie and even Fred and Wilma Flintstone and took their lives, peppered them with foul language and bathroom humor and then thrust it out on the public.

Personally, I don't get offended, and I thought it was pretty funny.  At the end, when our beloved dictator is telling the pro-democracy crowd the great things about dictatorships, he's actually pointing out the falacy of democracy.

I also think that the premise, a Gaddafi-esque dictator from the fictional country of Wadiya with a team of hot female bodyguards, would make for a very funny movie. The jokes were awkward, poorly timed, and felt forced throughout most of the movie, however. There were only two bits that made me laugh, one of which was already in the preview.

If you're easily offended, none of Sacha Baron Cohen's comedy is for you. If you're not easily offended, watch Borat. If you're truly bored, stream this for free on Amazon prime, but you will regret it.",1369958400,5,726,4.584615384615384

Borat - stupid and juvenile but very funny.

4727741,5,B005LAIHHC,"It's easy to misunderstand satire when its wrapped up in vulgar comedic form. And those who didn't watch it to the end and said its bad? Well you guys missed out on the important key message when Aladeen addresses the U.N. about the perks of a dictatorship. If nothing else, watch that scene. The dictator isn't really about an evil dictator, it's actually an ironic statement about the state of America: of corruption, corporatism, and greed. But its guised as trash and it is trash, but as the final scene would suggest, the nasty things happening behind closed doors in the U.S. is even below this trash. A darker understanding the director aimed to produce is that while our dictator in the story is a joke and a spoiled imbecile, real problems in this country aren't laughing matter. And when an ""awful dictator"" is depicted as the last hope of a ""real"" democracy (*there's a funny plot twist spoiler*), it suggests that democracy has died already and is only a facade for the greedy to mobilize people and manipulate them.

*spoiler: in the end a democracy is brought forth with open elections - a tank pushes voters towards Aladeen's booth. In reality, nothing has changed. It is still a dictatorship under the guise of a democracy. My comments: But at least here it is ridiculously obvious of how people are being manipulated... but the same cannot be said for people who are so subtly manipulated, people don't even know they're being manipulated. We let laws, such as the Patriot Act which basically lets the government detain anybody for an indefinite amount of time if suspected of terrorism, pass. It brings into mind a scene where Aladeen talks to Nadal on the bridge about civil rights in passing. (Aladeen: ""civil rights? what are those Nadal?"" ""I'll tell you about it, it's a hilarious joke"").

To be fair, as some of the 1 star votes have indicated, the vulgarity is highly inappropriate and offensive to everyone. And I mean everybody! Some people may have a problem with that but here's what you're missing - it's supposed to poke fun at everyone more or less 'equally' regardless of class, race, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, and religion. But search deeper. Note the way how Aladeen's offensiveness remarks contrasts with those of Clayton in the beginning where he basically says ""hell, if you aint from the U.S., everyone of you is an A-rab"". There is no distinction or shades of grey in this symbolic ""patriotic"" man's mind. He does not see the differences in cultures and people and simply lumps everyone either as ""one of us"" or ""the enemy"" - a mentality borne of fear, persecution, and dehumanization. In contrast, Aladeen takes the time to insult everybody personally but he at least recognizes people according to what they identify themselves as and offends PEOPLE rather than just seeing an amorphous blob of enemies everywhere as Clayton does.

I'll leave off this long and boring commentary with this single summary of the Dictator:
""A man, even an awful dictator, can have a change of heart, but a company (even if the government suggest otherwise) is not a man.""",1369958400,11,3103,4.828947368421052

So if you are sensitive to that, don't bother, you won't find it humorous.

The movie definitely hits you with some wackiness that will score some laughs, but I felt like it was holding back a little. The movie is more in line of Ali G (much more scripted/with a focused story-line) then it is of Borat or Bruno(with their more mockumentary type setup) but it still has some good comedy.

Started out a little slow, average offensive humor, expected a little more from Sacha, but gradually got better. It went from hot to cold quite a bit. Masturbation scene was interesting along with the democracy rant at the end. I'll have to watch it a few more times to get all the jokes. It's worth a viewing if you're a Sacha fan, but this isn't Da Ali G show if that's what you're expecting.

Anyone looking for a sensible and logical plot (or at the very least a coherent script) will be sorely disappointed -- it's an improv tour-de-force, with Sasha Baron Cohen falling into character, and milking the character for all its worth.

Sasha Baron Cohen gleefully cavorts through his role as the vile self-serving dictator of a fictitious Middle East country.  Blacks, Jews, gays, vegans....no group is spared.  The delightful Anna Faris is a perfect companion to Cohen, once again proving she's the queen of the spoofs!  Ben Kingsley seems to be having a great time and John C. Reilly has a dynamite cameo,

The jokes roll on and on and they are funny.  The love story is pretty well played as well as you don't know from the start what will happen.

The real gem here is the UN speech by the dictator.  You can probably skip over the rest of the movie to be to it and it would still be worth watching.  This movie nails the 1% debate so well.",1360540800,,472,3.8645833333333335

And this movie didn't hit me til the end, in which all the brutal dictatorial tactics the Dictator renounces are....US foreign policy.  This is way smarter than any rant on NPR.  Seriously.  It's not about some sleazy Middle Eastern dictator, not when you get to the end.  It's about the global corporate takeover.  The whole point of a pointless UN reflects this.  Listen to the Dictator's speech, pure hypocrisy, but it is a litany of US sins against ethics and humanity since the rise of the military-industrial complex, which Ike so presciently warned us all about.

Smart film.  The ""crude"" humor wouldn't shock an average middle schooler.  I don't know what world some people inhabit, but there's only so much disinfectant one can rub upon oneself before one becomes so non-resistant to bacteria that one catches anything particularly virulent.  Such as US foreign policy.  Drones are, after all, a kind of airborne pathogen.

Watch this movie until the end, when it pays off brilliantly.  No lie.  And then watch ""Hugo,"" where you realize how great an actor Baron Cohen is in every way.  I don't fan easily; I'm a Cohen fan.  Particularly after ""The Dictator.""",1359676800,,1242,4.856459330143541

I can almost feel Sacha restraining himself to please the board members.

Sacha needs to keep total control over his productions so that they may blossom into the awesome sick spectacles they can be.

He uses the African nation of Eritrea for his fake ""Wadyia"" country which they call ""North Africa"" when it is in East Africa.  If it was supposed to be a joke - it was not funny.  From there, they go into every arab stereotype and does everything to vilify them.  The dictator seems based on Moamar Qaddafi and is more of Cohen's insults to groups other than his own.  He calls blacks ""sub-Saharans"" but his fictional nations is located there!  I know by calling blacks 'sub-Saharans,"" that is more of a political thing.  He calls an African from Sudan ""blackie"" and ""sub-Saharan"" when Sudan is IN the Sahara! It's no wonder this film flopped.  He also has the styalized arabs types in the film with afros and looking mixed.  I can imagine what point a guy like Cohen is trying to get across, but I won't say it here.  Just do one of those daily shows if insults and political propaganda is your main focus, because comedy certainly is not!  We know there is only one reason he stays employed.

When I saw advertisements for The Dictator, I thought to myself, ""Maybe this will be his turnaround.""  Since there are many angles one can use to make fun of tin-pot dictators, I earnestly looked forward to watching this movie.

After the first 20 minutes, I gritted my teeth to get through the rest of the movie.  The humor was extremely dark, offensive, politically incorrect, and representative of the humor that would amuse a middle school or high school kid.  Despite employing all of the above in trying to elicit laughs, the movie was not funny at all!

I agree he should compensate his unwilling performers more sometimes, but without looking at the moral issues those movies are far more humorous, engaging and entertaining than this movie that seems to the formula comedy.  I don't like reality tv either as I find that mundane as well, but Cohen has a way of mixing reality with his story in funny and smart ways.  I don't mind that The Dictator should not have been scripted, just less formulaic.  It is definitely worth a watch but everybody also owes it to themselves to watch the original Dictator by Chaplin just to see how the films very.  Remakes like these are especially great because of they are such reflections of the times and these to films are hot button topics.  The other thing to watch for is the ending with the varying monologues and there solutions.  They are both honest and heartfelt but very different approaches.  Charlie Chaplin's version I suspect was very influential in the making of future Mel Brooks movies.  I could pass that film off as a Mel Brooks movie to the typical idiot that has never watched a movie before 1970 or 1980.  There's probably morons that never seen a movie in the 1900s, I'm sure I could make them think they are watching a Brook's film like Young Frankenstein.",1353628800,,1365,4.626556016597511

I especially loved the soundtrack, which was largely made of English songs translated into Arabic (I'm an Arabic speaker and I was literally crying with laughter, it was such a good touch).

4729128,4,B005LAIHHC,"What's it about?

The heroic story of a dictator who risks his life to ensure that democracy would never come to the country he so lovingly oppressed.

Is it any good?

Sacha Baron Cohen, creator of films Borat and Bruno, returns to the big screen with a new character, Admiral General Aladeen. Although the creative team behind those films return (including Director Larry Charles) the film does not follow the same mock documentary style, instead relying on traditional fictional storytelling. But is it as funny? Almost. The writing is very good, having us almost feel sorry for Cohen the Dictator, as he loses his beard and all his power in a double cross. The relentless jokes are more hit than miss, with a number of laughs out loud moments, including a hilarious, albeit degrading cameo by Megan Fox. For the easily offended you might want to move along, for everyone else I found the film to be 'aladeen'...and I'm sure you will too!

Best bit?

The opening shows Aladeen in his native environment, winning awards, winning gold medals and executing staff.

Did you know?

Sacha Baron Cohen attended the 84th Annual Academy Awards in character and full costume as Aladeen, accompanied by his ""virgin guards"". He later spilled an urn with the `ashes' of recently deceased North Korean Dictator Kim Jong-il, on Ryan Seacrest's tuxedo.",1351987200,3,1339,4.924444444444444

4729446,2,B005LAIHHC,"While I normally give every movie I see a chance, regardless of how the trailer makes it look, something about the previews for The Dictator had me wanting to not see it at all. Sacha Baron Cohen's earlier work like Da Ali G Show and Borat were great, and Bruno was alright for what it was, but it seemed like with The Dictator, he wasn't making any progress with his comedy. More Middle Eastern jokes, more ""offensive"" jokes that are boring most of the time, why not try something different? The movie had this self-aware feeling like they were writing jokes with a ""hey, isn't this funny?!"" mentality instead of going for more genuine humor. I just plain didn't like this movie, and it hurts to say that since I know Cohen can do so much more given the right material and setup. When it comes down to it, if you've seen his other movies and Da Ali G Show, then you've seen most of what's here. If you haven't...I suggest watching those instead. The Dictator will most likely only appeal to people who still get shocked at politically incorrect humor.

Aladeen is the dictator of the [fictional] country of Wadiya, ruling over it with an iron fist. Whatever he wants, he gets. Be it a nuclear bomb that's pointy instead of round, winning a race against professional runners, or changing a couple of words to his own name. He has a tendency to have people executed whenever they do something that bugs him even in the tiniest bit, and as such, no one likes him. Aladeen travels to America to talk with the United Nations, but he's kidnapped and shaved soon after his arrival. They replace the dictator with a lookalike, despite the man being mentally challenged, and plan on having him sign a document that would bring democracy to Wadiya, opening the country's oil fields up for business. Homeless and without any friends, Aladeen befriends (for lack of better word) Zoey, an activist who works at one of those all-natural shops that activists love to go to so much. It just so happens that her store is catering the hotel that Aladeen's replacement is staying at. This won't be pretty.

I'll get the things I liked about the movie out of the way first. Jason Mantzoukas, who plays Nadal, former chief of Wadiya's nuclear weapons program, provided most of the laughs for me. Whenever he'd get irritated at Aladeen's obliviousness to logic and basic instructions, it was funny. Unfortunately there's a good amount of time that goes on without the guy after he's introduced, but when he comes back, it's good. The other main thing is a speech that Aladeen gives towards the end of the movie. I was just about to write it off as a waste of time until that moment. Aladeen talks about many things that are wrong with America, and you can't help but go ""...yeah, he's right"" during this segment. The speech isn't delivered with a very serious tone, yet everything he says is true. There's also the infamous helicopter scene from the trailer, and it still made me laugh when it came up.

...that does it for things I liked.

Everything else about the movie is a flop. Jokes go on forever and don't know when to end, especially those with Bobby Lee, whose character is so forced into the movie that everything he does seems out of place. Some scenes are so drawn out that I was wondering if the movie was trying to be taken seriously all of a sudden because the attempts at comedy were suddenly gone. Aladeen just plain isn't an interesting character either, and comes off as Borat with authority more than anything else. It got old whenever he'd be talking about something sexual, and replace words for organs or actions with those in his language. The editing in The Dictator is pretty awful too, and it's clear that a lot of scenes were cut from the movie. You can see for yourself if you watch the trailer before or after watching the movie.  As for the politically incorrect-ness of the comedy here, none of it offended me in the way it might offend most people. No, what offended me was how hard they were trying to get a shock out of the viewer. Not since Carlos Mencia's show, Mind of Mencia, have I seen such a sad, forced attempt at surprising audiences with what was being said. Didn't any of the writers or anyone else have the guts to step forward and say something like 'hey guys, maybe we should stop with all this and write something more original'? I've seen the movie twice now, with the most recent viewing being 4 days ago, and I barely remember any of the jokes. How can the guy behind the genius Da Ali G Show be so desperate for a reaction now?

The Dictator will be one of those movies that will fade from my memory in a couple of months. It's not the worst movie I've seen all year, just the most disappointing.

The plot is simple.  That's fine.  The problem is that the comedy is really weak and really contrived.  I don't recollect busting out laughing at any point (and I really love Sacha's previous work... so I really wanted to love this).  It just was a bunch of tired, predictable jokes.  No real twists or turns.  The acting was pretty subpar across the board.

  Admiral General Hafez Aladeen (played by Sacha Baron Cohen) has been master of all he surveys in the North African Republic of Wadiya for decades. He's immature, anti-Semitic, has such poor judgment, and so little control over his libido that his bodyguards are all female and chosen primarily for their looks. In addition, he spends a fortune of his country's money for the pleasure of Megan Fox's company in the bedroom. Still, all is not perfect in the world of our conceited ruler. He must face the combined challenges of building his struggling nuclear program and keeping U.N. inspectors from discovering it. All while his right hand and uncle, Tamir (played by Ben Kingsley) grows frustrated with working for such a buffoon. Believing that he rightly belongs in the seat of power, Tamir (Kingsley) hires an American mercenary named Clayton (played by John C. Reilly) to kidnap Aladeen so that he can be replaced a look-alike they employ to foil assassination attempts. The look-alike, (also played by Cohen) is a simpleton and will be much easier to manipulate than the real Aladeen who managed to escape his captors, but not before they'd stripped him of his decorated military uniform and cut off his trademark beard. After meeting him outside the U.N., Zoey, an activist and operator of an alternative lifestyle food co-op (played by Anna Faris) offers Aladeen a job, believing he was a refugee from the oppressive regime rather than the covertly ousted oppressor himself.

  Now, having not seen Borat or Bruno, perhaps I was unprepared for Cohen's brand of comedy. The director, Larry Charles, was also behind the camera for Cohen's previous efforts but I'm only familiar with his work as an alumnus of the Seinfeld writing staff and as the director of the Bill Maher documentary Religulous. I am a fan of both but comparing The Dictator to Seinfeld is like comparing apples to... well, Seinfeld. And the obvious references to eccentricities exhibited by Saddam Hussein  and former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi were funny, but the protagonist himself neither funny nor sympathetic.

Cohen doesn't seem to care who he offends and much of his humor in DICTATOR is over the top in a vulgar and annoying manner. I understand that Cohen is trying to make a point and is making fun of dictators and discontent in the world but to this extreme? He is an equal opportunity insulter. Everyone is fair game. His character General Aladeen is dictator of the fictional Republic of Wadiya. A map of eastern Africa is shown and it looks like Wadiya borders Sudan right about where Eritea is. Aladeen (pronounced like Aladdin in Arabic) seems to be head of an Arabic country (his accent, the ""language"" he speaks has some Arabic words and so on) but he says at some point, ""I am not Arab.""  Cohen just seems to be out to offend everyone without at least making it seem its wrong.
I like Cohen so I wanted to see the film. I knew to be prepared for awkward moments that were lacking in sensitivity. Lots of references to Osama Bin Laden. It was his double that was killed which is a running joke about Aladeen's doubles.
The music brought a few laughs..famous songs like 9 to 5 and EVERYBODY HURTS were played in movie in the Wadiyan language whatever that is! I couldn't tell if the words were made up or if there was an actual language used.

There are a number of confusingly negative reviews here that lambast this film simply because it isn't as all-around great as ""Borat"".  Apparently we now live in a world where films can no longer be good -- they have to be AWESOME.  That's hardly fair.  ""The Dictator"" isn't awesome but it is funny and it is worth seeing.

Even if you get the theatrical version on DVD instead of the unrated version, you're still getting an entertaining show.  And one of the supporting characters, Nadal, almost steals the show.  He has a great scene on a bridge and another great moment in Times Square.  He ""grounds"" the movie very well, fleshing out a supporting character more than we usually see.

4730539,3,B005LAIHHC,"Sacha Baron Cohen's new comedy ""The Dictator"" is a string of hit-and-miss sketches strung together by a thin storyline about Admiral General Aladeen, ""dictator"" of a fictional North African country of Wadiya, secretly developing nuclear weapons. Like Borat and Brno, two comic characters Sacha Baron Cohen created, Aladeen travels to USA, but what you will see is not British shock comic's risque stunt involving unsuspecting bystanders, but a more story-driven comedy with professional actors, while picking random targets.

That does not mean ""The Dictator"" does not contain politically incorrect laughs. It does, and there are a lot of them, but for all these political and scatological jokes (and I find some of them pretty funny), somehow the ""Borat"" star has lost his edge. As one of the characters in the film says, he has become a ""nice"" person. Well, I mean, comparatively.

In ""The Dictator"" sometimes it seems Sacha Baron Cohen wants his character to be liked by the audiences. ""The Dictator"" is clearly aimed for mainstream success, with supports from Anna Faris and Ben Kingsley, and cameo appearances of Megan Fox, John C. Reilly and Edward Norton. The film even includes a subplot about Aladeen falling in love with Anna Faris's activist Zoey. Their love story, for all the ridiculous and outrageous moments it provides, is too familiar.

Where is Sacha Baron Cohen going? (After ""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted,"" he will be seen in ""Les Misrables,"" directed by Tom Hooper of ""The King's Speech"" fame). Now that his face has got more recognizable, it is unlikely that he will repeat what did in ""Borat."" Or will he?

Finding an unlikely cohort in the security that was hired to protect Aladeen (or so Aladeen thought) Clayton (John C. Reilly), Tamir puts in motion a plan to remove Aladeen from power.  The plan goes horribly wrong, though the desired outcome is achieved and a bewildered Aladeen finds himself in the streets of New York City.
While Aladeen is trying to regain his status, he meets Zoe (Anna Faris).  Zoe manages an eco friendly grocery store.  Aladeen begins to work at the store, never losing his will to regain power.  Along the way, he runs into a former Scientist in Wadyia ""Nuclear Nadal"" (Jason Mantzoukas).

Nadal begrudgingly agrees to help Aladeen regain his power, though at first neither of the two have any idea whatsoever how to go about accomplishing this task!

Aladeen continues his daily routines otherwise, getting to know his boss and also new friend Zoe on a more personal level.

The movie cascades through various situations through just outright silliness and LOTS of crude language.  However, while at first glance some of the language and situations may seem offensive there is a method to this madness!  Through various misadventures, misunderstandings, as well as dumb luck - Aladeen finds himself with a chance to regain his former status and life.  Aladeen's Uncle Zamir however has other plans.  Ending as absurdly as the story began, you will enjoy the conclusion and the movie will end with you wanting to see it again.",1346284800,8,1852,4.856687898089172
4730870,4,B005LAIHHC,"I'm surprised so many people here are giving this one one star. And that it's only gotten 3 stars overall here. 65,000+ IMDB users rated it 6.6, which is pretty good for a comedy. Yes, Borat got 7.4, and this isn't as funny as Borat, but I'd say 6.6 is just about right. (I guess these Amazon reviewers would rate it a 3 or 4 on IMDB. Why such a wide variance, I don't know.)

I wasn't expecting much, but my wife and I laughed our butts off! Assuming you ""get"" the jokes (i.e., are knowledgeable about recent world history) and liked his other movies, I fail to see why you wouldn't like this one enough to be entertained for 1.5 hours.

4730871,5,B005LAIHHC,"The funniest part of this movie (for me, anyway) was the presence of Ben Kingsley, who plays his role utterly straight-faced. I'm sure he was completely aware of how absurd every aspect of this movie was, but to watch him, you'd think he had no idea. In a film that is filled with comedic actors doing outrageous things, Kingsley is strutting around, dignified, serious, and stern of feature, delivering his lines as if he's taking part in a Shakespearean play. It's great to see such a respected actor having fun with the roles he selects, and willing to take on something different for him, impervious to the fear that many critics and fans might lambast him for the decision.

John C. Reilly also has an incredible performance- I felt his lines were the funniest of the movie. Unfortunately, his role is quite brief, but it's great to see these two heavyweights (Reilly and Cohen) from ""Talledega Nights"" reunited and having such a good time together. (And keep your eyes peeled for a non-speaking cameo by Ed Norton late in the film.)

If you don't like Cohen's humor, or any of his previous movies, you surely will not like this one. But for his fans, it's another delightful trip into the absurdity and hilarity that he's become well known for. What sets him apart from other outrageous actors is that his humor is always remarkably on point with its satire (sometimes subtle, oftentimes overt) of politics and society.",1346284800,5,1425,4.765182186234818

I think this is the funniest movie Sasha Baron Cohen has ever starred in. Some jokes may be crude, downright racist and stereotypical, but we already expect that with a Sasha Baron's movie. A very clever politically-incorrect satire, funny from start to end, full of funny dialogs with world politic references.

One of my favorite parts in the movie is when Aladeen makes his speech in the UN about dictatorship (or is it American politics he is describing?):
""Why are you guys so anti dictators. Imagine if America is a dictatorship. You could let 1% of the people to have all the nation's wealth. You could help your rich friends get richer by cutting their taxes and bailing them out when they gamble and lose. You could ignore the needs of the poor for health and education. Your media would appear free but would secretly be controlled by one person and his family. You could wiretap phones. You could torture foreign prisoners. You could have rigged elections. You could lie about why you go to war. You could fill your prisons with one particular racial group and no one will complain. You could use the media to scare the people into supporting policies that are against their interests. I know this is hard for americans to imagine, but please try!""

4731348,4,B005LAIHHC,"Sacha Baron Cohen basically has two groups of fans: those who enjoy his gross-out, extreme form of comedy; and those who appreciate the intelligence behind his low-brow humor.  THE DICTATOR is a nice showpiece for this odd blend, as it buries it's thought-provoking ideas behind hard-R humor.

The film follows General Aladeen (Cohen), the idiotic, over-the-top dictator of Wadiya.  On a trip to New York, Aladeen's second-in-command (Ben Kingsley) attempts to have the General assassinated.  Aladeen escapes and, beardless, takes up with do-gooder Zoey (Anna Farris), who has no idea who her new friend is.  As he falls in love, Aladeen also attempts to regain control of his country, before it is turned into a democracy.

THE DICTATOR isn't Cohen's best effort; it starts off strong, but then meanders.  The jokes get a little old (until a hilarious diatribe in favor of dictatorships at the end; conservatives will be a little pissed at that one), and the story strays as Aladeen (kind of) develops a conscience.  Still, Larry Charles's direction is strong, and Cohen is still the master of below-the-belt satire.

He gets by okay in The Dictator, his first starring vehicle without any such scenes, but also feels more homogenized and common than ever before. It's an intentionally crass, stupid film that leaves no culture un-mocked and no softball un-smacked. That's not to say it isn't funny, because it is - I averaged a legitimate laugh every five minutes, which is far better than the modern average - but it's missing the sharp-edged points that helped his previous films transcend generic comedy. Borat was as much about cultural disconnect as it was naked men wrestling in a hotel lobby, and Bruno used its explicit shocks to challenge homophobia at large. Despite a hammy attempt to shoulder in a deeper message about modern democracy, The Dictator has nothing even remotely intelligent to say. Take that for what you will; there's still a place in film for plain, dumb laughs, but I was hoping for something more unique considering Cohen's track record.",1344816000,10,1161,4.839195979899498
4731397,3,B005LAIHHC,"""The Dictator,"" Sacha Baron Cohen's most recent satire, portrays Admiral General Omar Aladeen, despotic ruler of the fictional North African country of Wadiya. ""The Dictator"" is scripted and doesn't contain the unanticipated ""ambush"" reactions of real, unsuspecting civilians that were a major part of his earlier pictures, ""Borat"" and ""Bruno."" There is a sense of improvisation here and there, but the plot is fairly predictable.

Aladeen comes to New York to address the United Nations, where his scheming uncle (Ben Kingsley) has him replaced by an easily controlled double and kidnapped to be tortured and killed. He manages to escape and eventually meets the proprietor of an organic foods store, Zoey (Anna Faris), who believes Aladeen is a dissident seeking political refuge.

In ambush, hidden-camera pictures, editing builds the scene for maximum humor.  When a film is confined to the rigors of the written page, the script has to stand on its own. Too often in ""The Dictator,"" the jokes make you squirm, such as a toss-away gags about Aladeen's cousins ""taking down"" the Empire State Building.

Baron Cohen, a master at instant characterizations, succeeds in making Aladeen a caricature but never bothers to make him a real person.  With his beard and zillion medals on a paramilitary uniform, Aladeen most closely parodies Libya's Muammar al-Gaddafi. That's not enough for a feature film, however, and the running time far exceeds the character's ability to elicit laughs.

Some good visual gags notwithstanding, ""The Dictator"" is not Sacha Baron Cohen's finest. He is far less successful in getting laughs here than when he points his hidden camera at real people and draws out their bigotry, prejudices, and dark thoughts.

The ""Banned and Unrated"" two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack contains a digital copy, several deleted and extended scenes, a Larry King interview with Baron Cohen in character as Aladeen, and a music video. ""The Dictator"" is also available in a single-disc DVD edition.",1344729600,,2003,5.260188087774295
4731398,4,B005LAIHHC,"Call me a sometime Sacha Baron Cohen fan.  While I liked ""Borat"" (in a perverse way), I thought Bruno was pretty stupid and not particularly funny.  ""The Dictator"" is more Borat than Bruno.  Cohen plays the part of a ruthless dictator of a North African country that is trying to develop all kinds of weapons of mass destruction but is particularly fond of a nuclear bomb.  He argues with his chief weapons scientist because he insists the bomb have a ""pointy"" end.  The scientist, Nadal is played by Jason Mantzoukas (TV's ""The League"").  He manages to steal almost every scene he's in.

Aladeen, the Dictator, must travel to New York to address the U.N. so that military action is not taken against his country by the rest of the world.  Once there he is replaced by a lookalike (also Cohen) under the control of his assistant and political rival (a smirking Ben Kingsley).  Like most great comedians who use insults and extremism to be funny, Cohen (who also co-wrote) goes after everybody and everything including the democratic form of government.

In one scene he defends his political change from a dictatorship to democracy using the U. S. as his beacon by defining current political differences as examples.  The ""one-percenters"" won't likely be laughing.  The film is loaded with numerous cameos including Megan Fox as herself having a one-night stand with Aladeen.  Cohen's material will offend many so take this as fair warning.  For me, I found this more hilarious than cringe-worthy.  I liked it in spite of the fact than many of the punch lines had been given away in the numerous TV and movie trailers.

The Blu ray is shown in 1080p with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  It is digitally shot but has a look of film and is very good.  Colors of varying hues are part of the film's fun and they are excellently projected here.  The primary audio track is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.

It has low-brow humor that is outrageous and crude, but there are several moments of ruthless political satire that ultimately make The Dictator much funnier than I expected it to be.

There are pop culture references and topical humor that restrain it from being anything close to timeless, but I don't think I've laughed harder at a movie this year.

The film courts controversy immediately by opening with the title card ""In Loving Memory of Kim Jong-Il."" From there, we meet Admiral General Aladeen (Cohen), the bearded, ignorant dictator of the (fictional) Republic of Wadiya. Aladeen's astounding stupidity, willingness to execute anyone who disagrees (or agrees) with him, and his development of nuclear arms that unnerve the US has his own men out to assassinate him; particularly Tamir (Ben Kingsley), the rightful heir to the throne that Aladeen has assumed. When Aladeen travels to New York to give a speech to the UN, his beard is shaved by a would-be assassin and he escapes into the streets as a double replaces him and promises to give Wadiya democracy. Aladeen ""befriends"" a feminist, vegan shop-owner (Anna Faris) and, against all odds, begins to fall for her as he desperately tries to keep his double from signing a constitution that will give his beloved country democracy.

The film frequently utilizes shock humor and no topic is off-limits. Be forewarned; The Dictator doesn't know the meaning of politically correct. 9/11, child molestation, sex-selective abortion, various sex acts, stereotypes targeting race, women, and cultures are just a few examples of the comedic fodder here. The humor alternates between intelligent and down-right stupid, but maintains a streak of intelligence by always being aware of the audience it's targeting. Two early scenes represent this dichotomy; in one, Aladeen exclaims ""you now have herpes"" after a sexual rendezvous with Megan Fox. In another, Clayton (played by John C. Reilly) mistakes Aladeen for an Arab and informs him that ""anyone outside of America is technically an Arab."" Once you sift through the low-brow stuff there is some fine material that takes on dictatorships, America, terrorism, and cultural stereotypes. There's also an amusing and subtle gag about Osama bin laden and a brilliant throwaway gag that shows the confusion throughout Wadiya when Aladeen orders the words `positive' and `negative' to be changed to `Aladeen.' In a film where a man is beaten for several minutes by a large pair of breasts, it may seem odd to refer to said film as ""intelligent,"" but writing dumb in a smart and witty way is difficult and Cohen (and his co-writers) knows how to capture these differing facets of humor remarkably well.

Making a film with a straight-forward narrative rather than the documentary-style of the previous outings seems be a more freeing experience comedically for Cohen and company. There is material here that Cohen would have never been able to execute on real, unsuspecting people without a potentially dangerous backlash. One example is the helicopter scene, which is one of the funniest and most hilariously politically incorrect scenes in the film. It's one of the film's best scenes and it would only work so well in this narrative framework. Some jokes fall flat, but the film's brisk 90-minute running time and rapid-fire humor make it easy to forget a mediocre joke as the next one has you rolling on the floor laughing.

The Dictator is an uproarious experience that will have you clutching your stomach with laughter and also nodding in agreement when it catches you with surprise moments of brilliance. The speech at the end about dictatorship in America is astounding and insightful. Never sticking to one comedic level for long, the film ends with the line ""are you having a boy or an abortion?"" There is something here to please, or offend, anyone. With a slew of celebrity cameos including Edward Norton, Chris Elliot (yep, he's still alive), and Garry Shandling; The Dictator is over-the-top and consistently funny, despite the topical humor that will grow stale in years to come. It's not a timeless classic, but I was shocked by how good it turned out to be. I don't know if I've seen a funnier film this year and I doubt that I will.

He takes the idea of a dictator and makes it hysterical.  I hadn't a dull moment as I watched this film.  I felt like watching Borat, only without the documentary portion, a proper storyline in substitute.  It has a good amount of political bashing, favoritism, and even fake murders in the film.  Great job, Sacha, you really blew me away on this one.  The fact that an Englishman can act such a film as he did in any of his films is outstanding.",1343088000,2,618,4.368421052631579

Some have called it ""offensive"" others have called it not believable, others have decried the character itself. For this movie, this is not the point. The plot makes numerous references to current events throughout the movie. The Dictator character himself is a composite of Ghadafy and Saddam Housain. The Dictator's country is modeled on Lybia. The references to current events are really too numerous to mention, and if mentioned, would spoil their discovery. When this reviewer saw the movie at the theater, and when one of these political references were made, the reviewer laughed but the other patrons were not. They did not get the joke.

4731404,4,B005LAIHHC,"""You lied to me and your wanted for war crimes!"" General Admiral Alladeen (Cohen) has the perfect life. He is the dictator of an oil rich country and all he has to do is make a signal and people die. He is a multiple gold medal winning athlete and can pretty much but whatever or whoever he wants. When he refuses to let UN inspectors into his country to look for weapons the US threatens attacks. While in New York to talk to the UN his second in command tries to have him killed and institute democracy in his country. Alladeen tries everything to make sure that doesn't happen. I have to say that I think Cohen is the Andy Kaufman of this generation. His comedy is the type where it makes you a little uncomfortable and you laugh but also wish he would stop and that you never saw it. If you have seen ""Borat"" you know what I mean. For me he is usually a little too much and crosses the line from funny to obscene. I didn't think that ""Bruno"" was that funny and in that one he seemed to just try and make people mad more then laugh. All that said this is far and away his best movie. There are the scenes in this where you laugh as you look away and thing you laugh at that you know you shouldn't but for the most part this is pretty mainstream (for him). I will say this is not for the easily offended though but there are some really really funny lines in this. This is another movie where if you like Cohen you will watch and if you don't you won't but this is his best movie so far and more like ""Borat"" then ""Bruno"".

There are some real belly laughs in this one, but in between quite a bit of the humor falls flat. Some of the jokes in this movie were actually quite creative and original, but I just felt that too much of the film was trying too hard to find humor where there was none.

The ""comedic hate then love story"" part was forced, predictable and horrendously acted. I felt this was a complete waste of time and money. Apparently I am among the few looks like others reviewing this loved it.

4731469,4,B005LAIHHC,"Sacha Baron Cohen's full-scale transition to ""normal"" comedy mostly works in ""The Dictator."" Ostensibly a satire of the cartoonish extremes autocratic rulers can reach when nobody is criticizing them, in addition to American sensibilities and blind spots when it comes to their own leadership, it's plenty funny when it has no particular agenda. The shot of the wall of General Aladeen's seemingly endless pictures with blank-faced celebrities is wonderful, as is hearing a cover of R.E.M's ""Everybody Hurts"" in Arabic during an emotional moment.

As Aladeen, Baron Cohen is basically a more malicious Borat given immense power. Ignorant, casually homicidal, and deeply antisemitic, he is easily removed from leadership by his uncle Tamir (Ben Kingsley, admirably straight-faced the whole time). Presumed dead after losing his beard to John C. Reilly, he must reclaim the throne from his double (also Baron Cohen, with an ever-closer resemblance to an imperial Borat) and the his beard from ... well, you'll see. Aiding him in this endeavor is Anna Faris as a walking, talking compilation of every dorm-room idealist stereotype ever, and Jason Mantzoukas, a weapons expert who had previously been fired for not making a sufficiently pointy missile.

The film is consistently funny, with Mantzoukas and Faris turning in strong performances, but the targets are a bit slapdash. There are a couple of good vignettes on that already well-explored region of Baron Cohen's comedy - redneckism (redneckery?) - but nothing too distinct. Likewise, the film could have had more fun with the sort of privileged do-gooderism engendered by Faris's character. And the climactic speech, with its blunt reminders of how America's political system resembles a dictatorship in more than a few non-trivial ways, is done with almost no comic flair, whatever you may think of its message. Personally, I found the random non-political bits to be the funniest, like when Aladeen reveals his plan to test the claim of Cocowater to have more potassium than three bananas, or expressing his fondness for Yiddish due to its way of pronouncing words the way they sound.

In any case, if you haven't already been tickled by Baron Cohen's work, there's no talking to you. Whatever the critics may say, Gaddafi and Kim Jong-Il would be proud.",1338508800,,2311,5.223719676549865
4731470,4,B005LAIHHC,"3.5 out of 5 stars for THE DICTATOR.

Upfront time: I'm not one to fall for Sacha Baron Cohen's subversive humor or his sense of the outlandish. I'm left cold and unimpressed by his Ali G and his Borat and Brno. But then there's Admiral General Aladeen, a thoroughly despicable, funky-bearded tyrant who somehow wormed his way into, if not my heart, then at least my good graces. Understandably, enormous chunks of human civilization will absolutely loathe THE DICTATOR, and be offended and outraged by it. But, as a wannabe anarchist (there's this nihilistic chick I'm trying to impress), I'm inclined to sort of dig this movie.

In the oppressed and oppressively warm North African nation of Wadiya, Admiral General Aladeen rules with absolute abandon, if not with sagacity. His will unchecked, Aladeen subjects his people to his petty whims and cruelties. He doesn't think twice about ordering someone killed, however trivial the reason. He sleeps with world-famous celebrities, if you consider Megan Fox a celebrity. You get a hint of the sad little boy lurking inside Aladeen when, post-coital, he pleads with Megan Fox to linger for a cuddling session (Megan Fox rejects him and demands her goodie bag). Redemption thru hugs? What the-- is Cohen getting mushy?

THE DICTATOR, despite the brutal subject matter, may be more mainstream than Cohen's other motion pictures. It certainly follows a more conventional plot trajectory than did BORAT or BRUNO. Ben Kingsley - I would say he's slumming but he hasn't done anything good in a while - plays Tahir, the rightful heir to the throne, except that he was passed over for Aladeen. Tahir is fed up with his second banana role and plots to overthrow the Wadiyan ruler. When one assassination attempt is foiled by a body double, Tahir convinces Aladeen to address the United Nations in New York, wherein another assassination would be staged. Except that this second stab also fails, leaving Aladeen shaven of his signature beard and wandering the streets of the Big Apple, unrecognized. Meanwhile, Tahir installs a dimwit body double in place, a puppet whose strings he pulls from the shadows.

On the streets of Manhattan, epiphany doesn't strike Aladeen as much as it sidles up to him only to be violently punched in the Adam's apple. It's a chore overcoming a lifetime of prejudice and hatred. But then Aladeen runs into left-wing activist Zoey (Anna Faris) who believes that the dethroned dictator - or, as Aladeen introduces himself to her, ""Allison Burgers"" - is a persecuted dissident. She offers him a clerking job at her vegan, feminist food store in Brooklyn, an offer which he accepts once he learns that her store is catering for the hotel in which the traitorous Tahir and the pretend Aladeen are staying. See, Allison Burgers still aims to regain what's his. Then again, Zoey hasn't hugged him yet.

Fair warning: Neither sensitive souls nor them humorless fuddy-duddies need come to the show. Sacha Baron Cohen's transgressions surface frequently and undilutedly. Scenes play out, colored with rampant obscenities and disgusting imagery. Regarding the scatological stuff, even the writers of BRIDESMAID are cringing. And yet here's a saving grace: THE DICTATOR is funny as hell. Another saving grace: Cohen drops several acute observations. Don't forget that this is a satire; somewhere, Jonathan Swift is showing solidarity, never mind that he's long dead. I don't know that Aladeen as a character is able to salvage the audience's good regard. The tone is too viciously satirical, the narrative not really grounded enough, that I ever felt Aladeen was an honest-to-gosh, full-blooded person. He comes off more as a cartoon figure, and, so, emotionally, I was never engaged. Still, there's a redeeming moment which momentarily invests me, when, after a panic attack followed by a particularly vile act committed by his accomplice, Aladeen scolds him: ""Plan B was to have coffee and regroup - not to chop his head off!"" Now, I didn't get a lump in my throat. But I almost did choke on a jujube.

If Marvel movies haven't taught you yet, don't exit once the end credits roll. You'll miss out on some stuff. That is, if you've managed to stick around that long. Odds are, halfway thru the film, you'd probably already stormed out of the theater, appalled and disgusted and loudly denouncing Sacha Baron Cohen.

4731472,4,B005LAIHHC,"In ""The Dictator,"" Ben Kingsley's character, in trying to persuade Sacha Baron Cohen's not to commit suicide, points out that he, alone of all the recent dictators, is still in power.  You know, unlike Saddam Hussein or Kim Jong-Il.  And Dick Cheney.  If you didn't find the last name amusing, you'll probably want to avoid ""The Dictator,"" a movie which also contains ample jokes about bodily functions, decapitation, childbirth and molestation of boy band members.  It also contains some sharp satire about today's political climate and the US's relations with other countries considered less ""democratic.""

Sacha Baron Cohen plays a North African dictator, who finds himself de-throned, and even worse, forced to take a job in a eco-friendly health-food store run by Anna Faris, in order to make ends meet, while he plots to get back in power.  Faris is a walking stereotype of a feminist, but she's also kind of cute, and her company, being hired to cater the event when ""Aladeen"" is going to renounce his dictatorship in front of many world leaders (all eager to partake of his country`s petroleum products), is a perfect cover to sneak in.  On the way there, he'll learn some life lessons about what's important in life, what qualities make up the perfect life partner, and what not to carry when being transported into a hotel room.

The movie's humor level is uneven, which is a disappointment.  When it's funny, it's very, very funny; when it's not and the joke is drawn out too long, it makes you check your watch.

I'm impressed by alll the jokes that flew  by me so fast ...that now I have to re-see this film and laugh at  the jokes I got and then find the ones the movie threw at us  that jumped away. Loved it.

Some of us are very picky movie viewers, going seldom because we reject so much... including those too many made for 12-1/4 year old males. In fact the  3 trailers before the Dictator came on  and that we were force-fed to sit thru were AWFUL....loud, crass, unfunny, foul language used to elicit some kind of response with the same old old old stupid slapsticks.

So the movie we paid dearly for - the Dictator - himself came on when we were ready  to walk out. But being particular also means enjoying the unusual, the uncommon, the odd, the dissident and different and the de Cohen moves.

Fast and furious - as in angering the P C public - this film is a gem, a must-keep, a fun funny movie.

4731474,3,B005LAIHHC,"MOVIE REVIEW #34 : "" The Dictator ""

Sacha Baron Cohan (Hugo, Borat) pulls no punches when he does his films. They are direct, ironically sarcastic and extremely crass. If you are easily offended by racist comments, political commentary or very color visuals....this film is NOT for you.

Larry Charles (Borat, Bruno) directed this film, like he did Sacha's others films with the style of farce, slapstick and extreme visualizations and graphic body parts....yes body parts. (If you have seen Borat, you know what I am talking about.)

Screenwriters Sacha Baron Cohen, Alec Berg, David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer came up with a story that basically puts an abusive dictator in a fish-out-of-water story by having him come to New York to sign a pact (unannounced to him) that will allow his county to sell oil.....he wants to keep it, but his right hand man does not.

His right hand man is played by Sir Ben Kingsley (Gandhi, Schindler's List) as secretly back-stabbing second-in-charge who tried to have the Dictator killed several times. - Unsuccessfully, of course. The story is simple and predictable. The action slapstick and visual and you have to look close...there are planted gags, signage and more - especially when you get into the Dictators palace. He is obsessed with bling and himself. It's funny and very visually sharp.

The Dictator is eventually kidnapped and `shaved' and becomes like everyone else as his double is put in place in order to over throw his government. One event after another makes his adventure fail almost at every step.

I actually enjoy his films and although he is politically incorrect most of the time....I know he's a comedian trying to make me laugh. A lot of people don't like this form of crass comedy - but I wasn't disappointed. In fact, there were several times I was laughing hard out loud and other times I was saying....""oh no!..."", out loud as well. This is like the adult version of Monty Python!

There are other performances by some pretty good actors like Anna Ferris (Scary Movie, Cloudy with A Chance Of Meatballs) as his `boss' in a new eco-friendly store that he has to take a job in and survive. She is the one who actually gets him to understand what the `right' thing to do is. Even Megan Fox and Edwaqrd Norton make cameo appearances with film clip archive footage of Hillary Clinton and Obama!

Also John C. Reilly (Chicago, Step Brothers) makes an un-credited appearance as the agent who kidnaps the Dictator and gives him his new look!.  Again, if you have a weak threshold for crass (visual) humor and no stomach for political incorrectness...this film is NOT for you. I thought Bruno and Borat were better films overall of this type, but this one did make me laugh out loud!",1337558400,16,2742,4.780126849894292
4731475,4,B005LAIHHC,"Call me a sometime Sacha Baron Cohen fan.  While I liked ""Borat"" (in a perverse way), I thought Bruno was pretty stupid.  ""The Dictator"" is more Borat than Bruno.  Cohen plays the part of a ruthless dictator of a North African country that is trying to develop all kinds of weapons of mass destruction but is particularly fond of a nuclear bomb.  He argues with his chief weapons scientist because he insists the bomb have a ""pointy"" end.  The scientist, Nadal is played by Jason Mantzoukas (TV's ""The League"").  He manages to steal almost every scene he's in.

Aladeen, the Dictator must travel to New York to address the U.N. so that military action is not taken against his country by the rest of the world.  Once there he is replaced by a lookalike (also Cohen) under the control of his assistant and political rival (a smirking Ben Kingsley).  Like most great comedians who use insults and extremism to be funny, Cohen (who also co-wrote) goes after everybody and everything including the democratic form of government.  In one scene he defends his political change from a dictatorship to democracy using the U. S. as his beacon by defining current political differences as examples.  The ""one-percenters"" won't likely be laughing.

The film is loaded with numerous cameos including Megan Fox as herself having a one-night stand with Aladeen.  Cohen's material will offend many so take this as fair warning.  For me, I found this more hilarious than cringe-worthy.  I liked it in spite of the fact than many of the punch lines are given away in the numerous TV and movie trailers.

The Blu ray is shown in 1080p with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  It is digitally shot but has a look of film and is very good.  Colors of varying hues are part of the film's fun and they are excellently projected here.  The primary audio track is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  While it might not be demo worthy, it is still very good.  There isn't much going on in the surrounds but this is the nature of the film.  Center channeled dialog is clear.
