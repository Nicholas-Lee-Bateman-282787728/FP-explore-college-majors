4572153,3,B00553K93U,"Franklin Schaffner made some fine films, but this one, his second, after the War Lord, still has roots too deep in television (of that era) to be good.  Schaffner's visual sense is good; he's much more interested in exploiting the skiers holding flares than in developing characters. The story plays like an episode of Mission: Impossible or The Man from Uncle, with nothing at stake, an little or no character development.  As a film this was a failure, considering I had never heard of until recently, unlike Schaffner's other works.  But judged objectively, I would say that I was not entertained, scared, or edified in any way shape or form.  The camera work is the star here, a major step up of the utterly sloppy work in the War Lord. His next film would be ever so much better in every way: The Planet of the Apes.",1444262400,2,821,4.5646258503401365

4572166,4,B00553K93U,"The Tyrolean Alps work out as the huge background in this predictable and uneven picture, where the charismatic Yul Brynner and the virtuosic director Franklin Schaffner (The planet of the Apes, Nicholas and Alexandra and Patton) brings some additive good action scenes in the snow.

When the son of a CIA agent (Don Slater) dies in strange circumstances, this ice- blood agent goes to the very scene of the facts to try to investigate what was really going beneath this ""accidental"" episode but the web spider is about to envolve him before he realizes.

There are certain resemblances between this film and the Bond's Under his Majesty's secret service.

Go for it.",1343520000,3,667,4.9375
4572167,4,B00553K93U,"Warner Archive releases a little seen espionage affair in DVD-R Director Franklin J. Schaffner's 'THE DOUBLE MAN'-1967 , made at the height of the sixties spy craze when movies and television were bombarded by every conceivable idea pretaining to that genre.  Here we have a routine story stretched out to a 105 minute length involving a KGB nest trying to keep their party alive by luring one of the CIA's best agents over to Europe in order to switch him with an exact clone to infiltrate our security systems.  Anton Differing, acting more Achtung baby than Russian, plays the brains of the outfit.  Yul Brynner plays the CIA agent while pipe smoking chair bound american actor Lloyd Nolan barks grouchy orders over the phone bringing the term phoned-in performance to a new level.  British character actor Clive Revill plays Yul's is he or isn't he traitorius ex-partner.  The beautiful scenery of the Austrian Tyrol and Britt Ekland help round out the mix. When the switch is finally made, the picture goes into high gear but many may feel cheated by waiting almost an hour for it to take place. Director Schaffner went on to bigger and better things after this one and tries to give life to Alfred Hayes and Frank Tarloff's script.  The cinematography by Denys Coop is wonderful and the brassy score by Ernest Freeman gives the film the icing it needs. Actor Differing always played Nazi generals or scientists so its cool to see him in a KGB role. Brynner gives his role a gripping intensity showing he believed in the project and its for this alone that makes the film worth seeing. Warner releases it in a beautiful 1.85 transfer with crisp sound and briliant images and makes 'THE DOUBLE MAN' worth seeking out for espionage fans.",1336953600,7,1740,4.764119601328904
4572168,4,B00553K93U,"Great 60's action suspense spy thriller starring the Imortal Yul Brynner. Great tone, very overcast, dark and moody. The music helps balance things out and helps keep things light. The plot is fast paced and overall you get what you would want out of this type of film. My only complaint is that Brynner doesn't react the way a normal human being would if his only son was murdered but that might just be me. Close in tone to the Quiller Memorandum released a year prior. I can also see similarities to A Dandy In Aspic but that film is a miss for me as Lawrence Harvey just doesn't have the charisma to pull off the lead.",1334188800,2,622,4.3247863247863245
4572169,4,B00553K93U,"Good film - although I am no fan of our Swiss-Russian-Mongol protagonist, you can believe that he's been a distant, unloving father - actually the wooden, one-note acting helps!  But the film around him is great, the vintage St. Anton location filming is really fun (although some of the rear projection is pretty bad), and it's otherwise a good cast, with some ""hey, it's that guy!"" moments.  Plus Britt Ekland, never a bad thing.  Could almost have been a Bond plot - cross ""License To Kill"" revenge/making the boss mad and the ski scenes from ""The Spy Who Loved Me.""  Although Bond never had a doppelganger, did he?",1326931200,5,618,4.694444444444445
4572170,4,B00553K93U,"[THE DOUBLE MAN - (1967) - Directed by Franklin J. Schaffner - Widescreen Presentation] A thoroughly solid (though by no means spectacular) by-the-books Cold War spy film with Yul Brynner as Dan Slater, a cold, calculating, cruel and carnivorous CIA agent searching for clues to his 16 year-old son's apparent 'accidental' death on the Austrian Tyrolean Alps while skiing. Though he was an expert skier, skiing is a dangerous sport. But as far as Slater is concerned, there are no accidents. Unfeeling and unlikable in the extreme, Brynner gives chills with every glance or word he utters in his relentless pursuit of the truth; more importantly, his kind of truth. He trusts no one, loves no one and strictly obeys no one. Because of this, it's difficult to feel anything for his loss, mostly because he doesn't much care either, it's all about retribution and revenge. But is it all that simple, or is there a 'double standard' looming ever-present in the background?

A considerable cast of character actor co-stars, among them Anton Diffring (everyone's default Nazi / Russian / bad guy during the 60's), Clive Revill, Lloyd Nolan and Moira Lister all bring charm but no considerable depth to their characters, and Britt Ekland adds the essential and enjoyable eye candy requirements, not Elke Sommer as the dvd box and Amazon details state (though they were somewhat interchangeable as far as appearances and abilities are concerned during that time). I'm not being critical of the actors, as the script was written that way, the only true figure of significance is Dan Slater, and everyone else is just in his way. It's Yul Brynner's single-handed show, replete with bullish menace, marauding cunning and relentless suspicions as he dissects those around him before he finally confronts his Russian doppelganger. True, the plot is not original by any means, it was utilized on almost every TV spy show in the 60's, but it plays out well in spite of the final act running a bit long. A bit more editing at the finale would have made it efficiently smoother and more satisfying as a whole. In spite of this mild criticism, all fans of spy flicks will undoubtedly enjoy this one. And the soundtrack title tune is immediately catchy and memorable and should be made available. So, ""Double your pleasure, double your fun"" with this absorbing and entertaining espionage thriller.",1318550400,9,2379,4.977386934673367
4572171,5,B00553K93U,"Thoroughly entertaining 1967 spy genre film featuring the suave but tough Yul Brynner and ever beautiful Britt Ekland.  The cinematography of the snow covered Austrian Alps is lovely. Filmed on location in Tyrol, Austria.  This DVD has bright colors, crisp picture and a fantastic jazzy soundtrack by Ernie Freeman/Stanley Black which should be put on CD.  If you enjoy the Bond movie On Her Majesty's Secret Service, you are sure to enjoy The Double Man as well.  Highly recommended!",1315872000,24,484,5.0886075949367084
8457496,4,B00553K93U,I watched this movie in the movie theater when i was a pre-teen. The movie has not lost panache. I really liked Yul Brenner in this movie. Wish he had played more heros.,1526428800,,169,4.151515151515151
8457497,3,B00553K93U,"Yul Brynner plays a CIA agent who flies off to Switzerland after his son is killed in what authorities claim was a skiing accident.  We know that it's all part of an elaborate plot by baddie Anton Diffring.  The movie wisely keeps the audience in the dark for much of the film concerning exactly what Diffring is up to, making The Double Man fairly effective as a mystery and paranoia thriller--right up until the point where you find out what's actually going on.  Unfortunately, the conspiracy at the heart of the film turns out to be exactly the same as one featured a year earlier in a two-part episode of The Man From U.N.C.L.E.  And just in case people missed it on television those episodes were also released to theaters as a feature film called One Spy Too Many.

Besides the very poor timing, The Double Man is a passable enough thriller but no better.  Director Franklin J. Schaffner shows zero skill at directing action and includes some fake shots of stars Yul Brynner and Britt Ekland skiing that look embarrassingly bad--considering that no stunts or action are involved it's hard to fathom why he didn't simply shoot his actors on real snow for the close-ups and use doubles skiing for the longer shots.  Instead, he chooses to use some laughably bad looking rear projection that suggests the director probably should have watched a James Bond film or two before he began shooting this.

Schaffner does a bit better near the end in an extended suspense sequence where Brynner's character is trying to elude two assassins--but while the scene feels well staged it's never genuinely exciting.  But as far as suspense and action go that not quite exciting sequence turns out to be the high point of the film.

The Double Man is the kind of subpar vehicle that ultimately derailed Yul Brynner's career as a film star.  It's a decent if mediocre movie that is instantly forgettable--but if it happens to turn up late at night on TCM you could probably do worse.",1505606400,,1972,4.703488372093023
