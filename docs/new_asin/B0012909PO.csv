8326011,3,B0012909PO,"+++WARNING: If you got this DVD only for the juggling you may have seen him do on Youtube, stick to Youtube. His Abbey Road juggling is NOT on this DVD. It was the finale of this act but right when he is about to throw the first ball into the air the screen goes black and text appears. It basically apologizes for not having the juggling and says that it is due to copyrights. Bummer. That being said the comedy on here was quite funny and my wife and I enjoyed it. It was very intelligent and kept us laughing.",1293321600,,512,4.13
