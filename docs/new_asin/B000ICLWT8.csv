8145060,5,B000ICLWT8,This DVD was a wonderful way to learn about Yunus' life and work with the micro-credit movement.  It's amazing how much impact one person can have on such an apparently intractable problem like poverty.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone with an interest in social change; it would also be a good complement to the classroom or in corporate training programs.,1169510400,,363,4.838709677419355
8145061,5,B000ICLWT8,"For all those that are interested in being and/or learning about Social Entrepreneurs, this is a terrific series that you need to watch! With the emergence of so many troubling world issues it is refreshing to see so many strong and determined leaders taking the proverbial, ""Bull by the horns"" and making a positive difference in their community and the world.

In the series you have a rare opportunity to meet up close and personal, the leaders and founders of the Social Responsible movement for our generation. The 16 DVD series is an opportunity to meet with the leaders and pioneers in social entrepreneurship. Such as Muhammad Yunus, Peter Eigen, Fazle H. Abed, Oded Grajew, Alice Tepper Marlin, and Bill Drayton. These are the most respected names in the world.

This series is priceless. I thought I knew what being a social entrepreneur was all about. It wasn't until I watch this DVD series that I now really know. Also check out, How to Change the World by David Bornstein. A great book on the topic of social entrepreneurship. (And no I was not paid to write this review.)",1168473600,2,1086,4.7407407407407405
8145062,5,B000ICLWT8,"This is a great DVD series, it lets you in to the minds and experiences of these great Social Entrepreneurs so you learn, have fun, and get inspired with each DVD you watch. Great to buy for your self or your family and also a great gift for all ages.",1166400000,,251,4.04
