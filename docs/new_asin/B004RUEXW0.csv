best and Jack was an after thought. His back nine is probably the greatest run of golf in Major golf history. The best golfer
in history closing out a career with a victory at age 46,you couldn't write a better ending to close out an unmatched record of
greatness.",1356739200,,388,4.328767123287672

4461653,5,B004RUEXW0,"This is by far one of the best sports documentaries I've ever watched. It was just like it happened as I was watching it. The commentary was also spot on and from some of the best people in the game. This is a film that will be history for a life time. If you haven't seen it, I highly recomend it for not only sports fans, but everyone. It's an amazing story.",1332979200,,360,4.013888888888889

4461655,5,B004RUEXW0,"If this is the ""Yes, Sir..."" that was shown before the ESPN telecast of this year's Masters, the 25th anniversary of the epic '86 Masters, and surely it is...this is a truly outstanding piece of work about a truly outstanding golfer...

Watching this production when it first aired, I thought--and said to myself--- ""Now, I""ve got to have that..."" and here we are, having my very own copy sent to my home.

Folks, golf lovers, Nicklaus admirers and devotees, it's just doesn't get any better than this.

It would be interesting to know if this production was prepared with the intent of marketing it to the public or if public demand dictated that it be made available. It might well be the latter.",1311638400,3,698,4.658536585365853

8439288,3,B004RUEXW0,"This DVD is a somewhat enjoyable recap of the 1986 Masters. The quality is decent and summarizes well the events of that tournament. However, I do wish it included more actual footage of the golf, especially the exciting final round.. it's more interviews than anything else. Also, the DVD run-time, as described on Amazon, is somewhat misleading. It said it ran for 120 minutes, when in fact it's only 48 minutes, plus ""bonus material"", which is simply more interviews. I'm not even sure that, if you add it all up, it would come to 120 minutes. Not sure who's to blame for this... maybe Amazon or maybe the DVD manufacturer, but it's definitely inaccurate. I would much rather have seen a film that showed more of the actual tournament than this DVD shows, but I suppose this effort is better than nothing.",1453593600,,808,4.697183098591549
8439289,1,B004RUEXW0,"I have to agree with the other 1-star reviewer (so far), Colten, and add some more.

This DVD in actuality is quite a bit different from how it's advertised on Amazon.  Both the day I ordered it and today (9/20/15), it is listed as being 120 minutes in run time. This run time was VERY attractive to me, as I thought there would be tons of coverage, maybe even Jack's FRONT nine, too, on the final day?  Nope. In reality, it is just 48:41 for the documentary, and then there are some separate interviews with the same participants as in the main program as a separate track, totaling 36:32.  Thus, 85:13 in total-- not 120 minutes.  And only 48:41 for the actual show.  Very disappointing.  Secondly, the description on the listing notes, ""Narrated by Jack Nicklaus""-- very desirable to me(!)-- but this isn't true, either. It's narrated by ""Jackie"" Nicklaus, the great golfer's son, aka Jack Nicklaus II, who caddied for him that day.  Again, HIGHLY disappointing.  Plus, he reads his script slowly and stiffly.

The picture quality is not nearly as sharp as on the great, official 1986 Masters Highlights 60-minute CBS video narrated by Pat Summerall, a classic VHS tape, then DVD, that covers the entire 4 days, which spends 45 minutes on just the last day-- much more GOLF coverage of just the last day than this poor video, which keeps breaking away to go, somewhat annoyingly, to people like Tiger Woods, Ernie Els, Tom Watson, and others for their thoughts . . . but who cares?  I respect all of these people except Tiger, but their thoughts add nothing.  Gary Player, a sharp interviewee in the past, sounds like he's just there to say anything . . .  nothing helpful comes from him, either.  And Tiger seems predisposed to talk about, guess who, himself.  Didn't want to see A BIT of that.

An interesting thing they did was produce the picture in full anamorphic 16 x 9, though the original broadcast was of course in 4 x 3, as is the Pat Summerall-narrated DVD.  Maybe this is why this DVD's picture looks unnatural to me-- that is, the portion that covers the 1986 tourney.  The rest of it (the interviews from 2011) isn't distorted and has fine picture quality.

Overall, this production reminds me of SO many others, when less qualified producers and writers put out a poor ""re-make"" of something on some great subject that was done perfectly in the first place, years earlier.  Such is the case with this video.

The only redeeming quality is a quick look back in spots at Jack's other Master's victories and even the 1980 and 1982 US Opens, when Jackie Nicklaus (the son) refers to them in his (weak) narration.

If you've never seen anything on the 1986 Masters, you'll like this DVD.  But if you've seen the other DVD mentioned above, in particular, or a number of other shows on this topic on The Golf Channel or ESPN (where this one aired originally), then this DVD will disappoint you greatly, as it did me.

Please don't thumb me down for being VERY accurate for the benefit of future buyers.  If you bought this, like it, and now are thumbing down people with whom you merely disagree as to how much you like it, you're not helping new buyers who use these reviews.",1442707200,7,3188,4.6

8439293,1,B004RUEXW0,"For those familiar with that weekend in 1986 you will not learn too much new material here, and if you have not seen it, any ESPN marathon might be able to do the trick for you. Technically there is not much here to raise a brow, and unless you really want to relive this over and over, it's better left to be skipped more than anything else.",1391904000,,342,4.119402985074627
