5841603,5,B00DPJEW9S,I usually don't watch zombie movies but this one was filmed locally.  I wanted to see the local places and I really enjoyed the entire movie.,1382313600,2,141,4.423076923076923
5841604,1,B00DPJEW9S,"Bad acting, bad dialog, bad camera work, cheesy effects. The list could go on but I think you get the drift. The good reviews must be from shills involved with the movie 'cause nobody smart enough to type them could honestly think this movie was anything but pure crap.",1382140800,3,269,4.510204081632653
5841605,1,B00DPJEW9S,"This movie really sucks, its low budget crap, bad acting, terrible camera angles. I watched for about 15 minutes and had to stop.",1381536000,4,129,4.6521739130434785
5841606,5,B00DPJEW9S,"I have to say that I have watched a lot of modern day zombie movies. I must also state that a TON of those movie are really bad! So I tried to keep an open mind with Zombie eXs (clever spelling - LOL). It is an adventure and a comedy that involves zombies (they're almost more like ""Infected People"" more than Romero style zombies) but it is a pretty unique twist on the genre. It has tons of pop culture reference to video games, trashy games shows and narcissistic cultural tendencies in general. The story is a roller coaster of misadventures dealing with over coming self doubt and gaining awareness of the great scheme of things. I'm not trying to be deliberately vague, I just don't want ruin the story. Overall this is a very interesting story with an crazed journey into the depths of the (very) possible zombiegeddon with a very satisfying ending. while this movie may not be as groundbreaking at Shaun of the Dead it is easily ten times greater than such flicks as Zombies, Zombies, Zombies and Flight of the Living Dead. So do yourself a favor and check this movie out today!",1379203200,7,1086,4.517766497461929
5841607,5,B00DPJEW9S,The movie is great for the low-budget production that it is. Sit back and enjoy it for what it is. After that BE SURE you run through the extras! The actors commentary if friggin hilarious!,1377993600,5,189,4.428571428571429
8596014,3,B00DPJEW9S,More funny than scary. Pretty good film for a refreshing break from a horror marathon.,1511481600,,86,4.8

8596016,3,B00DPJEW9S,"Zach (Alex Hammel-Shaver) goes on a game show with all of his ex-girlfriends in a set up. The show is sponsored by Hapiwater which turns people into zombies...who can talk, have selective extraordinary strength (they can bust through the top of a door, but not the bottom) and sometimes walk with a foot drag.

The film was mostly three people finding ways to kill zombies. I don't know why they gave the gun dealer in Philadelphia a southern accent. The build up was good, but 60 minutes of zombie killing got boring. The dialogue fell off a cliff. The blooper reel at the end was better than the film. What was clear is that the cast had a ton of fun making this low budget zombie film, and couldn't care less if fellow Pennsylvanian Movie Guy gives it a meh. Fairly honest DVD cover in that it shows people who are in the film.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1445817600,2,864,4.39375

8596018,3,B00DPJEW9S,It was OK. Silly teen comedy.,1413936000,,29,4.0
8596019,2,B00DPJEW9S,"I love bad movies but this one is BAD. It's the first time I've found the cast/crew commentary better than the movie itself.  Bad acting, camera work, lighting, etc. Now I watch the movie because Madison Hart is really cute and I am prepared for how bad the movie is. This isn't a ""B"" movie, its an ""D"" movie.",1406332800,,309,4.237288135593221
8596020,3,B00DPJEW9S,"Not a bad zombie movie, Its definately not the best, but not as bad as some of the rest.
I am a avid zombie Movie collector and it surely was a good add to my collection,
But again an OK movie on a 1 to 10 scale I give it your average 5.",1399680000,2,237,3.490566037735849
8596021,1,B00DPJEW9S,"This movie stinks. All these 5 star reviewers are people involved with the movie. It's not selling apparently, so they figure lying will prompt some people to buy this stinker of a film",1397433600,,185,4.636363636363637
8596022,5,B00DPJEW9S,"Bought this dvd for my mom and she loves it, good quality and it is funny, for the price is awesome!! I will recomend it!!",1391731200,2,122,3.92
8596023,5,B00DPJEW9S,"OMG, what if all of MY old girlfriends came back as zombies?
In fact, what if any two of them came back just as friends (of each other; not of me)?
Great idea.
Is the concept silly? Of course it is.
Are the production values in line with multi-billion$ Hollywood productions? Uh.... DUHHHHH.
Was it entertaining. You betcha!",1390694400,6,324,4.603448275862069
