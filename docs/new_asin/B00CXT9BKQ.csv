5751667,5,B00CXT9BKQ,"My OB recommended the Dia Method when I was in my first trimester after my normal exercise routine was starting to strain my hips, ankles and back.  It was an absolute lifesaver - gentle yet effective in keeping me trim and healthy throughout my pregnancy.  The core compressions helped me strengthen my ab muscles - enough so that I was strong enough to push out my baby (with absolutely no medication) in less than 45 minutes.  I still use the Dia Method DVDs five months post-baby and will continue to do the exercises forever; I lost all my baby weight in four weeks following Leah's plan.  This method, unlike every other pre and post natal workout I've seen, is grounded in solid scientific research about diastasis recti.  A must for any expectant mother.",1396742400,2,762,4.6992481203007515
5751668,5,B00CXT9BKQ,"I just had a healthy baby and I worked out using the Dia Method BellyGuard for my entire pregnancy.  I found the workouts to be challenging, effective, and short enough to fit into any daily routine.  I also really loved how you can stream the workouts on your laptop or ipad if you choose instead of the DVD.  This made it very easy for me to access the workouts whenever I wanted to.  Leah is a wonderful instructor.  I had a difficult pregnancy emotionally, and honestly it was very helpful for me to ""connect"" with the people in the workouts on a daily basis so I didn't feel so alone.  It made me feel good to see other pregnant ladies doing the same workouts.  The ladies in the workout videos were normal - and they even struggled a few times.  That was refreshing to see because usually workout videos show perfect people doing workouts perfectly.  I found it nice to see other people just like me, trying to stay fit.  And stay fit I did.  I was far more toned in my abs, butt and thighs than I was pre-pregnancy.  The ""belly back"" instruction throughout all of the workouts kept a constant reminder on the core compressions and was very helpful.  Throughout my pregnancy I did not experience any back or hip pain and I credit this entirely to The Dia Method.  Prior to my pregnancy I struggled with back pain and I was concerned it would become an issue for me.  That is why I purchased this product and it came through and exceeded my expectations.  I highly recommend The Dia Method for your pregnancy.  I just purchased the Post-natal system and I can't wait to get started.  Seriously, this program worked better for me than my gym membership and my pre-natal yoga classes combined!",1395532800,2,1696,4.4869281045751634
5751669,5,B00CXT9BKQ,The DVDs were part of my daily workout when I was pregnant with twins.  It was the Dia Method that kept me fit and free of back pain during my pregnancy. People were shocked that I carried my healthy babies to 38 weeks and I owe this to Leah!,1395532800,,242,3.938775510204082
5751670,5,B00CXT9BKQ,"I did a great deal of research on prenatal fitness prior to finding Leah. Her approach is so logical yet there is nothing else like it. I found the exercises easy to follow and effective. I did not have back pain or exhaustion during my second pregnancy which, without the Dia Method, I suffered throughout my first. I was also able to deliver my son via VBAC which was an important goal for me. I recommend this system to everyone I meet that is pregnant!",1395187200,2,456,4.376470588235295
5751671,5,B00CXT9BKQ,"I am currently almost 8 months pregnant and I started using the Dia Method at the beginning of my pregnancy. I'm generally healthy and fit and when I became pregnant I found it was difficult to workout the way I used to.  The Dia Method has been a saving grace during these past few months!  No matter what was changing or going on in my body, the workouts always made me feel better, stronger, and have fewer ""pregnancy symptoms""- ie low back pain, sciatica, swelling etc. They are targeted and effective and most importantly I feel completely safe doing them.  I've noticed a tremendous difference in my abs since starting the workouts and I have stronger abs now while pregnant than I did before.  Leah Keller is highly respected for her work and brings to life these simple yet profound exercises that make all the difference in how you feel in your pregnancy.  The Dia Method is based on science, makes sense, and feels great.  I've tried other pregnancy workouts and they don't even come close. This is the only one that I would recommend.  And the short videos are great- its very easy to do them often.  I've already bought several for friends!",1375315200,3,1152,4.612745098039215
5751672,5,B00CXT9BKQ,"The Dia Method empowered me to prepare my body for an amazing birth experience. I learned basic principles to confidently perform daily exercises while multi-tasking at work or relaxing at home. Combined with a Bradley Method childbirth class, I felt fully prepared, in body and mind, for a natural, empowered birth. My 9 pound 2 ounce baby girl came quickly and powerfully, and I knew I had the strength and focus to bring her into the world safely, peacefully, and with great joy.",1371513600,4,482,4.819277108433735
5751673,5,B00CXT9BKQ,"Easy to do videos.  Every mama or mama to be should be using the dia method in my opinion.  I've purchased other work out videos in the past, but this is the first one that i'm discovering positive results around the mommy-pouch area.  the videos are tailored specifically for that.",1371427200,3,282,4.6
5751674,5,B00CXT9BKQ,"The workouts are easy to follow, and many are short enough to do when I only have a small amount of time. Sometimes I even bring a disc with me to work and pop it in the computer to get a quick workout on the go! The focus on the core muscles make it really empowering to feel strong even once getting to the third trimester when the body is changing so much. I really love working out with the Dia Method and recommend it to any pregnant woman looking for something safe, efficient and effective during their pregnancy.",1370822400,5,520,4.262626262626263
8587346,5,B00CXT9BKQ,"Here is my story.  I am an active athlete.  I was clueless on which exercises were healthy and my local gym couldn't give me advice due to insurance purposes. I tried you tube, google search for information,  I realized that most prenatal videos on the market were ""basic, boring, generic exercises"". Then I found ...... The Dia Method are exercises that are geared toward helping you to give a healthy strong birthing experience. I love the medical diagrams on explaining why you are doing certain movements. I love how the exercises are based on core compression breathing. The instructor is very clear in directions and allows enough time to pause between movements. Great for beginners ( no weights) and great for advance (I added 5lb weights). In addition to the daily Dia Method exercises, I also perform cardio (cycling or swimming) 3x's a week. I'm looking forward to purchasing the After labor series!",1505001600,,910,4.934640522875817
8587347,5,B00CXT9BKQ,"I was skeptical at first, but desperate to find a good workout that was safe while I was pregnant. I have to say, I ended up loving this program and looked forward to doing it daily. It kept me moving and motivated and I believe made the last part of my pregnancy a little easier (compared to my first). I highly recommend, especially if you are active/athletic pre-pregnancy like I was. Such a great program!",1487635200,,409,4.466666666666667
8587348,3,B00CXT9BKQ,I just started this but I'll keep updating this as time goes along....this workout has a move where you have to bear/balance all your weight on one leg and do a squat. I'm gaining weight being pregnant and this does not feel great nor safe!,1484697600,,240,4.355555555555555
8587349,4,B00CXT9BKQ,"Ultimately, I did like this workout program but it does have some short comings.

First, the good:
1) I started this workout program at 14 weeks pregnant and was able to keep doing the videos right up until the day before I went into labor at 38.5 weeks.  Workouts really are suited for all stages of pregnancy.
2) My back felt better at the end of my pregnancy than it did before I started these videos.  Seriously.  The same exercises to combat rounded shoulders in pregnancy really helped with my office worker back tension.  I was amazed.
3) I stayed mobile throughout my pregnancy and never had any balance issues.  This was my main reason for getting the videos.  The exercises aim to combat some of the posture issues that happen as the body changes during pregnancy and it performs as advertised!
4) Without these videos I believe I would have had a c-section.  My baby was in a bad position during labor and so the pushing phase was very long.  Staying fit and having good abdominal strength and endurance made the difference.
5) Even with a difficult labor, I recovered quickly.  Again, totally worth it.

The bad:
1) No cardio.  I kept running through 29 weeks and then switched to walking for the rest of my third trimester to make up for this.
2) Not enough stretching.  She cuts the stretches short to save time, which is cool, but I really needed more.  I did Hilaria Baldwin's prenatal yoga DVD twice a week to keep limber.
3) Maybe it is just me, but couldn't these be put on one DVD for ease of use?  I found the multiple DVDs cumbersome and annoying.

All in all, I would buy this again.  It was well worth it.  However, it does need to be supplemented with other activities to be a complete prenatal fitness program.",1479340800,,1736,4.492012779552716
8587350,5,B00CXT9BKQ,I bought this off of amazon and used it throughout my pregnancy. I credit 100 percent of my pregnancy fitness to it.  I did the DVDs and walked daily and remained active the whole time. I bounced back quickly.,1473724800,,209,4.358974358974359
8587351,5,B00CXT9BKQ,"I am so happy I found this amazing, comprehensive system. The instructor does an awesome job of instructing you how to perform the exercises safely, keeping in mind special precautions for the pregnant woman. I feel like it is much more safety-conscious than the typical prenatal workout DVD, which I really appreciate. The workout is really designed to address and prevent typical physical complications that pregnant woman can face during pregnancy and to prepare woman for the physical act of labor. If you are in incredible shape already, these workouts may not be much of a challenge for you. They are great for functional fitness, though and they make me feel very empowered, like I am doing everything I can to be physically prepared and in great physical shape for labor. For a first time mom like me, this is priceless! I strongly recommend this program!",1473552000,,863,4.917808219178082
8587352,1,B00CXT9BKQ,"This is probably a fine workout system but i bought it, opened it and then returned it and was only refunded 40 bucks. Everything was returned with it, no discs were even used. Personally this system is waaaaay too much money to spend for a few workouts, any prenatal workouts will help you with labor. I wouldnt recommend it.",1461974400,,326,4.5423728813559325
8587353,5,B00CXT9BKQ,"Great workouts for the time-challenged mama! In less than 30 minutes, I get a warm-up, workout, and a cool down. Many times, quick workouts don't leave me feeling as though I've done much at all. I'm an intermediate to advanced level, and these are fantastic. I'm on my 8th pregnancy and have already successfully healed a DR before this pregnancy. My intention is to work with my body while I'm still pregnant to prevent further DR challenges. Leah is also down-to-earth and knows her audience. Great job!",1450569600,5,506,4.827586206896552
8587354,5,B00CXT9BKQ,Wife used a couple of times and lost interest.  She said it looked better on the info mercial than was actually on the video,1435881600,2,124,4.166666666666667
8587355,5,B00CXT9BKQ,"Love it! This fitness system was recommended by my OB, and it helped me stay healthy, energetic, and decently toned throughout pregnancy. I got a lot of 'you don't even look pregnant from behind' comments - LOL. The ab exercises also really help strengthen your push muscles and make for an easier delivery - I got my baby girl out in just 4 pushes. And two weeks after delivery, my tummy is pretty flat, wearing all my normal clothes (well, the ones that are nursingj-friendly anyway.) So pleased with this that I also purchased the post natal series (which unfortunately I couldn't get on amazon at the moment).

Some others have said that they mainly do the 10 minutes of core compressions. I actually did the opposite. I did the 30 minute workouts 2-3 times per week. My favorites were Synergistic Strength (very efficient!) and Birth Power. Since all the workouts are based around core strength, I didn't feel like it was necessary to do the one-off core compressions - just did them occasionally when I didn't have time/energy for a full workout.

Highly recommended!!",1403913600,3,1074,4.8
