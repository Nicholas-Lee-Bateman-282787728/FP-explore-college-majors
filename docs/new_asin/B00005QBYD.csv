7950153,5,B00005QBYD,"This is a great set of DVD's. The narration is well spoken and understood. The musical score is well placed and subtle. While I'm a fan of ground assaults (the 2 DVD's on Allied and Axis tanks), it was the first 4 DVD's that made this collection worth it's weight. Each DVD attempts to introduce you to the aircraft in the order they were developed in the 40's, but there is some deviation (since nations introduced different fighters at almost the same time period during the war). There is a brief description of power plants, armament, and squadrons of note for each type of aircraft, all the while showing dogfighting and aerial photography of the planes. Expect about 3-4 minutes devoted to each aircraft.

The video footage is both in color and B&W, but mostly in the later. If you are any level of video historian in WWII, then you will have seem some of this footage before, but probably not in such a compact volume.  The DVD menus are easy to navigate and the musical score for them in on par with the music in each video. This is a great addition to the collection of any WWII historian or aircraft fanatic.",1196553600,,1118,4.502463054187192
7950154,2,B00005QBYD,"The set of vehicles covered by this boxed set is too broad, making for only skimpy overviews of the well-known primary  fighting vehicles.  Instead of focusing on a few key ones, the series covers many of them, from multiple countries, sometimes ten or more in a single episode.  This means that coverage of individual models is often less than 5 minutes apiece.  Many of these vehicles are models from the early 1930's and were rapidly phased-out after 1939.  These precursors should not have been given as much time.

For instance, the Axis tank coverage does not focus on the core German models, e.g. Mark II-IV, Panther and Tiger.  These alone would provide more than enough interesting material for an hour-long episode on Axis tanks.  Instead, it gives a typically shallow overview of too many vehicles, like all the German tank models and every insignificant and outdated Italian tank, of which there were many.  It doesn't make any sense to devote equal (and short!) time segments to the Tiger and a light Italian tank model that was rarely used in battle.  Similarly, the Allied tank episode covers way too many vehicles from too many countries and gives extremely short shrift to the T-34, which was (by far) the primary fighting tank of the Russians and a real key to their victory on the Eastern Front.

The plane episodes are marginally better but suffer from the same problem of too many airplanes covered with little detail about each one.

There is zero coverage of naval vehicles.

Also, this set just isn't worth the money.  It has 6 discs, but each DVD only has a single, one hour episode.  This is a total ripoff price-wise.  At this length, all the episodes could have fit on two DVDs, and the set would cost half as much.  At around $55, it costs more than ""Big Battles of World War 2"", which has more than twice the amount of footage plus greater replay value.

Though I don't own it, ""Great War Machines of World War II"" would seem like a better buy in the same area (WWII vehicles), with 8 discs for a bit less money.  The coverage looks more narrow, but it really isn't all that interesting to learn only a little bit about each vehicle, which is the approach taken by this disappointing production.",1126310400,9,2225,4.658974358974359
