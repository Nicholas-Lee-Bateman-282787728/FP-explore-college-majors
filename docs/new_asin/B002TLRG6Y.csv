8380230,5,B002TLRG6Y,"I saw this on YouTube. The quality of the picture was so-so (640x350) and there was no CC or subtitle that made me miss many or even perhaps most  of the jokes (since I understand very little British English, or at least not the one the actors spoke). I wonder if the DVD is of better quality and if it has CC or subtitle.

The movie itself was hilarious. I gave 5 stars as a farce (some may call it ""black comedy""). It's about as funny as ""I love you to death"" or ""A fish called Wanda"" but probably had a much smaller budget.

I recommend that the viewers read about it and the actors in Wikipedia and on IMDB but only after they saw the movie. It was very educational for me.  I plan to see it at least one more time in the near future.

It's too bad that none of the public libraries in Ohio seems to have the DVD.",1467763200,,817,3.9877300613496933

8380236,5,B002TLRG6Y,"From the moment Gerald (Ian Charleson) buys the ill fated Jaguar, ""Car Trouble"" explodes with hilarious dark comedy. Forbidden to even touch his new prized automobile, Jaquilene (Julie Walters) obviously misunderstands and her amorous escapade with the car salesman, leads to disaster for the Jag. and her marriage. ""Car Trouble"" is extremely rewatchable, and actually becomes funnier on repeat viewings. - MERK",1258588800,6,411,5.645161290322581
