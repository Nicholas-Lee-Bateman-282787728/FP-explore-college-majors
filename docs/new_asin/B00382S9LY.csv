4082753,3,B00382S9LY,"Nick Searcy's disturbing performance as Clive Mercer is the biggest asset in this twisted tale of obsession.  Clive stumbles upon a young woman killed in a freak auto accident and sees her as his ideal woman.  Her concerned sister and estranged boyfriend try to discern her whereabouts with unpleasant results.
The movie moves slowly but Searcy's almost pathetic portrait of a sad and lonely man maintains your interest.",1276128000,4,420,5.161764705882353
4082754,3,B00382S9LY,"The Cover art and Title might be somewhat misleading as they played only a small role in the last part of the film. ""this isn't a spoiler"".
Cold Storage started off with a great gore effect ""a flashback"" Then as the story went to present day it became somewhat slow..Although there are some wonderful aspects to the movie,one being Nick Searcy who always plays a crazy lunatic to perfection with out over acting and making it seem very real. I also am a big Matt Keeslar fan, although his role was somewhat wasted he's still nice to look at.
There are some grit my teeth and wince, gross out moments in the film..I don't gross out easily but GAG,some of this did. The story has certain elements of May,Grace and Psycho but not a copycat.
It was interesting enough and worth watching I just wish it were a little faster paced. What few gore effects there were, were very well done and were very effective..
If brushing your teeth with a straight razor,Boils,Necrophilia or a fat sheriff sucking very runny egg yokes through a straw gross you out by all means watch it..Or not~!",1272931200,6,1076,4.551546391752577
4082784,3,B00382S9LY,"O boy here we go, can you hear the banjos playing? This is one of those country fried back woods movies that's freaky
To say the least and full of surprises. I think she needed a little more cold storage than the movie title suggests but you be the judge. Enjoy this one ;-D",1415923200,,274,4.092592592592593
4082785,3,B00382S9LY,"This is not your average low budget thriller ( I can't catorgize this as a horror flick) for several reasons. The great performance by Nick Searcy as Clive ( the dimished capacity hermit/kidnapper? ) in the lead role was very convincing.
Melissa (Casey Leet) is on her way to star in a play when just a few miles from her distination she has an accident. She is found by Clive who takes her home. Won't say anything else about her and Clive for obvious reasons.
When she fails to show up for her rehearsal the shows manager calls her sister Cathy (Joelle Carter) who is her emergency contact. As luck would have it, Cathy is visited by Daric (Matt Keeslar) Melissa's (ex) boyfriend? and the two head off on the same route Melissa took to see if they can find her.
The story starts off with a flashback from 30 years prior and then jumps back to present day for a teaser as to what we may expect to see. The story is somewhat slow until just past the halfway point and then makes up for the first half and finishes with a bang.
Some of the things that make this story loose points is the pacing of the first half of the story and the accident is just not even close to being believable. Also some of the actions that Cathy and Daric do range from odd to just plain dumb and given the way Daric's character was being portrayed they weren't realistic.
Many for the production values were quite good cinematography, main characters performances, most of the directing and some pretty decent gore scenes that I won't reveal here.
There is some violence, blood and good gore scenes and cursing including the fword, but not used to excess. There isn't any nudity only a scene of Melissa wearing her bra and jeans.
I really wanted to give this 4 stars, but it falls a bit to short, but was worth the time especially watching Clive in action.",1415491200,,1833,4.410029498525073
4082786,5,B00382S9LY,"Different from the overdone ""5 teens go camping and get killed one by one"", this actually took a writer to come up with a decent script.  A  young lady has an accident with her car in rural Tennessee. Hurt badly and knocked unconscious, a local man finds her and takes her to his cabin to make her well and claims her as his own.  She dies, and he doesn't realize he's giving a corpse a bath, trying to feed her supper, dresses her up and drives her into town.  Her sister and her boyfriend go to the area in search of her, and  the mountain man throws one of them in his well and one in his freezer with a chain on it.  How can they escape and have this weirdo caught?  Nick Searcy is wonderful as the weirdo, Clive.  Nothing sexual in this, but violence and scenarios creepy enough to give little ones nightmares.",1415318400,,815,4.212903225806452
4082787,5,B00382S9LY,"Excellent movie , great choice to choose. I loved it and im sure you will too. Its a great buy with a good price.",1365465600,,113,3.75
4082788,4,B00382S9LY,I'm not a big horror fan but a big Nick Searcy fan. He was FANTASTIC. A big departure from his role on 'Justified..' It was a good balance of horror and comedy. The story and characters kept your interest,1341705600,,204,4.256410256410256
4082789,3,B00382S9LY,"Okay, in this movie it is Clive and if you are familiar with the dirty limerick then you know this story. A woman (Casey Leet) dies in a car accident only to be found by a hillbilly (Nick Searcy). Her sister (Joelle Carter) and boyfriend (Matt Keeslar) set out to find her.

What makes this low budget film good is that they bothered to create memorable characters instead of using just bodies to read lines. I enjoyed listening to whatever gems the town folk were going to come up with next. The problem with the story is that the plot dragged along too much. The ending needed to be stretched out and have a good hook. The title of the movie is a bit misleading as the ""cold Storage"" aspect wasn't utilized enough to make it the title.

No f-bombs that I recall. No sex or nudity.",1336003200,,782,4.312925170068027
4082790,4,B00382S9LY,"There is very little cold storage actually going on here until very late, and then not for long.  Otherwise, this is quite a good production for a low budget independent horror film, with some pretty good performances and locations.  A woman dies in a car accident and her body is taken home by a weird man who takes a fancy to her and wants to keep her around.  Her family comes looking for her, and I will not reveal any more than that.",1324684800,,438,4.253012048192771
4082791,4,B00382S9LY,"Do not mess with those back woods inbreed mumble mouth Hillbillies, being out of touch with reality can mess up your social skills to say the least.
Our main man Clive (Nick Searcy) is one out of touch and crazy boy and he has love on his mind. Nick Searcy who plays Clive is 100% convincing as a twisted redneck freak and had me squirming in my chair and thinking this is one nasty foul smelling odd ball. When a missing young lady's wimp of a boy friend and bad to the bone sister go looking for her they find Clive in all his sick glory and the fight is on. Good low budget movie with a group of fine actors make this worth a look, heck you will be planing your next vacation around Clive's Bed and Breakfast.",1307664000,,712,4.129496402877698
4082792,4,B00382S9LY,"Without giving away the familiar plotline, this movie had humor, pathos,(I know the main character was creepy but I could feel for his situation, being so lonely for so long) and sincere performances. (Did anyone see ""Little Children""? I think the main character in this movie would have been good to play the creepy guy in that movie). For a low budget movie it was very good.",1305504000,2,377,4.641791044776119
4082793,5,B00382S9LY,"This a piece that achieves what it set out to do, a thriller with some chills and then rises above it with a surprisingly sensitive and layered portrayal of a pool soul, lost in a wasteland of madness and loneliness, a hell from which he cannot escape.",1297555200,3,252,4.382978723404255

8390979,1,B00382S9LY,"Why is this allowed on Amazon. They force half their distributing partners to actually publish graphics and titles. Then Gravitas Ventures to posts gross titles that are basic as hell, its worse garbage than youtube. This title was pathetic, most from this distibution platform are because they don't care at all about the people that they represent, just money to the machine.",1514937600,,377,5.096774193548387

8390982,3,B00382S9LY,"Surprisingly well made for a low budget movie! I think the movie could have done without the gory opening scene. I suspect it was inserted to keep the horror fans looking for more. However, without that scene, I believe no one would be shocked to see it in the drama category alongside the horror category. Element of drama involved are: selfless love, dealing with loneliness, perseverance in the face of public apathy and pure evil.
Actors were spot on! The main character (the simple minded) was completly believeble.
I recommend the movie.",1420156800,,543,4.913043478260869
8390983,4,B00382S9LY,"OMG another hillbilly movie AAAAAACK.  However, that being said, I have to admit this is very well done and the cast is superb.
The writing and direction are good and reveal a keen ability to successfully incorporate various scripting and cinematic elements to deliver a satisfying production that holds the audiences attention.",1419724800,,328,5.3076923076923075

Well, after shutting my eyes a couple of times because of the nastiness (not fear), I made it through this movie. Well done plot and acting was believable. Worth watching if you don't have a weak stomach. Please tell me no one really lives in those conditions. Ugh!",1417478400,,546,4.697916666666667
