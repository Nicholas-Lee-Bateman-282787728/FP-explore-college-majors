4437429,5,B004OBZMBS,this was worth the rental. pretty cool. one thing that would make it better though is if the trolls were also done with some of the stuff Ray Harryhausen used to do. so some shots would be with the computer fancy pants stuff and other shots with the stop animation mixed in.,1305417600,2,274,4.288461538461538
4437430,5,B004OBZMBS,"I watched this after seeing news/reviews about it on io9.com. A lot of comparisons are made between Cloverfield and it, but I feel that it is rather quite different movie. There are moments of action and it is far from dull, but it is really not deserving of classifications as ""thriller"" or ""horror"" of which I've seen. That's not to say I didn't thoroughly enjoy it. It has a really great documentary feel and is really interesting look to the culture and folklore of the area. It really feels fresh, unlike a lot of the crap Hollywood is pumping out these days. I highly recommend it, and in fact, I will be watching it again today.",1305417600,17,635,4.482758620689655
4437431,5,B004OBZMBS,"I had heard of this film from MovieBob over at the Escapistmagazine.com and rented it on his recommendation.  And I can see why he loved this movie so much. Possible spoilers, but I'll try to keep them to a minimum.

Under the presumption of a bear poacher, a trio of college students set out to find out whats going on with a rash of dead bears across the country side. By the name of the title, you can see what they end up uncovering.  Very soon they come to find out that not only are trolls real, the fairy tales behind them aren't all lies, nor truths.

What I love most about this movie is the camera work. That may sound a bit weird, but after watching ""Cloverfield,"" you'll like the camera work too. The camera is steady nearly all the time, with realistic small bounces as the camera person runs, but only shakes terribly when dropped, which makes sense.  It lets you really get a look at the trolls when they have their fleeting moments on camera.  Just long enough to get a true sense of what they look like, but scarce enough to still leave you with a sense of wonder in the world's forgotten creatures.

The characters are nicely done too. The Trollhunter himself is nicely portrayed as a man sick of the secrecy, and terrible conditions of his job. The college kids do a nice job of being just some naive people who get in over their heads once the reality of the situations set in. And the trolls are nicely characterized by their actions, and reactions.

The CG is pretty good, nothing to make your jaw drop in disbelief, but used to do what is needed to be done. Plus the beautiful countryside makes for some nice scenery as their journey progresses, from the fogged in shorelines, to the plains of snow up in the mountains.

The last thing of note is explanations. I loved how they took some time to explain how the trolls live, and thrive. Why they react the way they do to sunlight, and other things that set them off.  The ending does leave a possible opening, I suppose, for more movies. But I for one would rather that not happen. I feel the filmmakers gave just enough of a taste of this parallel  world, to leave us satisfied while wanting more, which is where they should leave it. I highly recommend it for those who want a good thriller, with some light humor, and a great finale reminiscent of the game ""Shadow of the Colossus.""",1305244800,60,2358,4.397701149425288
4437432,5,B004OBZMBS,"Presented as the lost tapes from a group of college kids, who disappeared while filming a documentary in the mountains of Norway, Trollhunter is a fascinating film. The armature filmmaking technique lends itself to the drama and anxiety of the film. I enjoyed the pacing which never ramped up to far and always seemed to create an even tension that kept you wanting to look ahead to the next scene. The film is actually very tame with limited violence of which most is implied and no foul language (even if there was the movie is in Norwegian and is subtitled). The special effects were very believable and not overused; I appreciated the use of the camera and sound effect editing to induce fear as much as seeing any of the beasts. With any movie you could start asking too many questions and pull apart the believability of it but I think if you are looking to be entertained the story is actually put together rather well and isn't just an excuse to scare you or to show you trolls. I would watch this movie again and again.",1305072000,3,1028,4.502673796791444
4437433,5,B004OBZMBS,"(Saw this movie on Amazon Video on Demand at the pre-theatrical release price).

While this movie is clearly carrying genes inherited from its predecessors such as The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield, Trollhunter manages to be far more than a mere clone. It is filmed with an unassuming panache which keeps it fresh and entertaining throughout.  It stands apart as much as for its distinctly non-Hollywood feel and style as for the subject matter, and while it falls short of being truly scary, nevertheless it has moments of high excitement and you're never quite sure how the story will unfold (though the ending is something you can see coming a 200-foot-tall mountain off!). The dour and mysterious Troll Hunter himself makes an atypical and fun central character, and the trolls themselves make sufficient appearances to satisfy without turning the movie into Where The Wild Things Are.",1304640000,21,895,5.123287671232877
4437454,5,B004OBZMBS,"I saw this film on Netflix, and plan to purchase it from Amazon. Great movie! I'm almost 40 years old and I still find the ideas of man eating trolls aas well as giants seems to rattle me to my core, unlike traditional horror films. Maybe it stems from my Norse ancestry. I am still facinated by the history and lore of those regions and this film does them all justice. The film will leave you wondering if trolls are actually real.",1511049600,,433,4.2926829268292686

4437458,1,B004OBZMBS,"What if they made a movie where giant trolls went around eating Muslims, but left Christians alone? What if the troll-hunter played the Islamic call to prayer to lure trolls out to kill them? Would that be acceptable? or would Muslims call out the movie as anti-Muslim? If Trolls in folklore had a particular hatred for Christians it doesn't matter and that's not the point. The point is violence against Christians is considered acceptable, while violence against Muslims and any other religion isn't tolerated. This movie seems to have a scary underlying message which goes beyond what is seen on the surface.",1509840000,,611,5.0

4437467,5,B004OBZMBS,"This isn't really a mockumentary or a traditional ""found footage"" horror film.  Instead, ""Troll Hunter"" succeeds by never winking at the audience.  The entire troll concept is silly enough to make camp tempting.  Otto Jespersen's plays it straight and brings a world-weary gravitas that anchors the story.  This isn't a blockbuster with amazing special effects.  The acting is workmanlike, but not stellar.  There is a sure-footedness about the production, however, that makes this a much better money than many with much larger budgets and far greater ambitions.",1499644800,3,563,5.413793103448276

4437501,5,B004OBZMBS,"If you are looking for a straight-laced horror film, you won't find it here.  And that shouldn't be disappointing.
A group of college students follows a bear-hunting expedition in the stunning wilds of Norway in the hopes of catching a poacher.  Instead, they find a man (Hans) who secretly manages the troll population for the country, whose existence has been covered up by the government.  When Hans allows the students to tag along and document his actions, the entire film turns into mayhem.
This is a ""found footage"" mock-horror film with savage irreverence, absurdity and murderous Nordic humor on display.  Oddly, one becomes touched by the plight of the trolls, though they be stupid and very foul smelling.  The net effect is that reason is thrown overboard.
It is a brazen feat - clever storytelling, a certain fondness for folklore, wicked and pointed humor and high production values.  If you're looking for a ridiculous adventure, you could do far, far worse than this.",1486339200,3,983,5.0

4437534,5,B004OBZMBS,"A unique documentary on trolls which, unlike the case with sasquatch, elves, and UFOs, provides all the empirical evidence needed to confirm their existence. Through multiple video images we are also given to understand that there are many varieties of trolls, ranging from bear size to 100 ft. tall. All, however, can be exterminated with exposure to sunlight or by ultraviolet rays. Death comes swiftly--though painfully--with trolls exploding from the inside out, or by turning into stone. Christians appear to be particularly at risk of deadly troll encounters.

The Norwegian government denies the existence of trolls (sounds familiar?) It also denies the existence of its very own Troll Security Service (TSS) which is engaged in indiscriminate and inhumane troll cleansing. The detailed information on trolls gathered here by a group of college students at great potential cost to their life and limb should not be buried but be rewarded with a special prize.

Hans invites them along, because he's been at this job a long time and doesn't like the benefits.

Several film students decide to investigate bear attacks, and in the beginning of the film, are at the scene of a bear that has been killed.  The bear has been blamed for missing hikers, and the wildlife service is out there to record the incident and handle the press, when one of the local bear hunters state that the large, brooding man at the edge of the crowd is probably a bear poacher.  The students investigate the man, which leads them to a darkened wood, where they see flashes of light over the crest of the hill, and suddenly the man runs past them yelling ""TROLL!""  After that, the film follows the students and the man as he investigates trolls in Norway.  Very fun film, lots of dry humor, though I expect people who aren't paying attention to not really pick up on the small moments that make the film so enjoyable.",1475452800,6,1002,4.453551912568306

But it's one of the better ones.  It's Norwegian that also takes place in Finland, so you're reading subtitles as you watch, but that's never a bad thing.  Basically a group of uni students for some reason are making a film trying to track down a bear poacher, and when they come across his caravan, decide to trail his vehicle into the woods.  Of course he's not really hunting bears, and after at first seeing these kids as an irritation, decides to take them along and show them what he's really hunting.",1467763200,,718,4.5

Of course you're led to believe by the previews that it's more 'troll' then walking around 'found footage' style. I understand not every 'Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Foreign, Fantasy, Creature Features, Action Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Foreign Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Foreign Action & Adventure, Norwegian Language, Scandinavian' film needs to be all out, wall to wall action...but sheesh this one just drags on more often then not.

Im a sucker for the found footage genre.  I love the immediacy it provides and, when done well, the style can elevate mediocre material.  Here, it is paired with a compelling story and some fascinating world-building.  It turns out that trolls are real and the Norwegian government is aware of it.  Who knew?

This is not really a horror film, I think it could be considered a (straight) Cinma Vrit mockumentary following the ""Dirty Jobs"" exploits of an troll control expert as recorded by a student crew who originally intended to make a documentary on bear poaching.

Other than prepare the viewer this way I do not want to spoil anything else.

Its one of the better found footage films ive seen & the general story/premise is very good. Basically a student film crew follow a hunter who hunts trolls for a living. Theres a bit more to the story but I don't wanna spoil it. What I really enjoyed about the film is that every troll shown & mentioned has a different set of characteristics, personalities & look. They also come in different shapes & sizes. The acting was good, the troll effects were very well done & it was great seeing a different type of troll everytime with the best being saved for last (the biggest species of troll). Only thing I didn't like too much is the ending. I think it could've been better & wrapped things up a bit better then it did but other then that its a great film & very much worth seeing.

4437768,5,B004OBZMBS,"This film is a hoot. It is both wacky and at the same time strangely convincing. The actors are presented as non-actors and for a while I thought I was watching a documentary. Then the trolls come into the picture and the effect of the film changes. Norway has a mythical past. Vikings, the Edda, Odin, fjords, winter... Some of that mystery is touched upon, almost despite the efforts of the makers to come across as amateurs. Either they are (amateurs), or they are very clever and artful professionals.

I recommend this film unreservedly. One thing this film is NOT: it's not like a Hollywood version on trolls. These trolls are real.

4438161,5,B004OBZMBS,"Troll Hunter?

The fact that the picture is still playing while the end credits are running, maybe is sort of a benchmark of the silliness of this feature.  It pokes fun at old world folk lore, and mocks some of their foundational religious stereotypes.  Mostly we have a lot of fun with some college students who are tracking an enigmatic outdoors man throughout the dramatic scenery of Norway.

It's not English dubbed!  The English is sub-titled, so it takes away some of your attention while you're viewing.  This really punctuates the drama, I thought, as I'm watching and saying ""NO WAY did they just do THAT!""  The tale of Three Billy Goats Gruff is but one of the fabrications of Trolls Lore underlying the comedic thread of this film.  The 'Scapegoat' is a plot crisis which leads us into the action.

This movie is about a couple of young college reporters that follows around a man that works for the government in a job that only a few people know about.  He has been working for the government a long time with low pay to keep trolls hidden for the general public and now he thinks people should know that trolls are real.  His job is to keep track of the trolls and make sure they don't leave protected areas where they could cause serious damage to people and property.  If any trolls' do gets out of the protected areas, it is his job to either get the troll back into the area or kill it before it kills someone.  The movie had some suspense and a little bit of comedy.  A couple of trolls explode and their blood and guts get all over.  It was a little bit like the movie Jaws but with trolls.  The acting had room for improvement but over all it was a fun and entertaining movie, one more thing, the movie is all english sub-titled.  I liked it enough to buy it, I hope you will like it also.",1418688000,,1120,4.10091743119266

4438199,4,B004OBZMBS,"To those who have seen 'Cloverfield' this movie has similar impact at times. We have monsters in our darkest thoughts and, as this movie shows, so do the people in Norway. At first it seems a little odd that the source of their fears are huge, strange creatures that can be 200 feet tall, hairy with ape-like movements or have multiple heads and carry the moniker ""Troll',  but the people in the story approach the hunting of these creatures (to destroy or film) in an almost business-like manner. The hunting almost becomes 'just a job'. The viewer quickly becomes as engaged as the characters in the hunt- and that's when the viewing fun begins.

Not a great movie but the production values appear to be better than average and the script is well developed with numerous moments of levity and light-heartedness. My daughter said it reminded her of 'The Blair Witch project' because of its stark and colorless 'camera view' scenes but in this
movie the monsters are presumed real, numerous, and are out to eat you.

 The subtitles are very well done and its intriguing to hear how the word 'okay' is used quite often with other spurts of English here and there. It almost makes one think that there was production involvement by outsiders in this film with the intention of maybe doing it in English ( dubbed?) to appeal to a wider American market. Hopefully that will happen in the future.

  Bottom line: Guaranteed to bring a few jolts and smiles. Worth watching.",1418515200,,1467,4.70703125

Troll Hunter does not disappoint as it builds from an unlikely story to a glimpse of what might be, what was in another time, and which shockingly exists TODAY. It's a faux documentary, but does not disappoint either the format or the genre.

4438203,3,B004OBZMBS,"I enjoyed this film, but I didn't love it and it certainly isn't among my favorites of all time.  Ultimately it suffers from being a ""found footage"" film (which often, but not always, tries to hide some level of incomprehensibility and bad writing.)  I know that it is supposed to be more or less comic, but like many ""parody"" films it fails to recognize that its underpinnings need to be coherent and good by themselves.  That is today under every comic film there needs to be a good serious film.  I did like the special effects and the art design.  The trolls themselves are delightfully designed, reminiscent of children's fairy tale book illustrations.  To see them come to life was, for me, the highlight of the film.  What detracted was the incomprehensibility of plot and the lack of a plot arc.  I walked away pleased, but not fulfilled or added to in any sense.",1418083200,,871,4.6103896103896105

4438223,5,B004OBZMBS,"Troll Hunter is a fictional documentary shot by three university student reporters.

It is far above the usual found footage flick made by an inexperienced somebody shooting on the fly on a video camera got last Christmas from mom and dad.  This is professional quality video that was edited and ends up looking not surprisingly great. The only difficulty it might pose are its necessary subtitles.  Suck it up America, this movie is worth that effort.

The story is far above the usual fare found by those of us who choose to view ff flicks.

For openers the folks making the fictional documentary are bright and aren't just wandering about guided by a predictable and nonsensical back story.  We see a smart team of young reporters on the trail of an interesting story about someone illegally killing bears.

What they stumble upon is a surprising story rooted in reality that carries us and them into the unbelievable.  They find the mysterious hunter and discover his prey one is  they thought impossible. They and we are hooked as we follow their investigation and the TH and his prey.

The Troll Hunter we meet is as interesting as Quint was in Jaws.  His personal story establishes his creds and his special burden.  The trolls he seeks have their own story and understandable reasons for their wrath and all we see done by them.

The result is a gripping, thoughtful, well-made movie.  It is certainly worth its viewing time, a its rental fee, and given your own interest in ff movies its purchase price.",1416182400,,1512,4.743295019157088
4438224,5,B004OBZMBS,"This ""Documentary"" is so good, it almost makes you believe in Trolls for real ! A VERY interesting movie indeed. (I usually stay away from subtitled foreign-language movies, (I ONLY HAVE 2,)) But this one was so good, I purchased it after viewing it on Amazon Prime. The other one is Gojira, (The Original Japanese version of Godzilla, King of the Monsters. Also a very good movie.) Before viewing this movie, I always thought of Trolls as approximately human proportions, or slightly smaller. NOT Giant Monsters! And I NEVER thought of different species of them either!
  For any ""Monster Lovers"", I would recommend this movie!",1416182400,2,628,4.9714285714285715

My grand daughter thought the footage was of real trolls! By the way, their depiction was creative and darned realistic.

My rating would have been 4.5 stars. It is thoughtful and creative and watchable.

No seriously, it made me laugh and was thrilling at the same time. I got to pretend I was in that cave with a huge troll farting in my face and everything. I have a lot of Christian friends, though so I am sorry that the one Christian guy in the film suffered a fatal 'trollestation' (not the sexual kind).",1415491200,,431,3.9655172413793105

One thing you should know that I've seen no mention of; they provide their own English subtitles because they are speaking Norwegian for the entire thing. (Except a very short point where Polish fellows show up and they'll speak English for a few minutes before leaving.)  Normally that would be a turnoff for me but I'm glad I stuck with it.",1414281600,,494,4.8

4438325,5,B004OBZMBS,It was surprisingly an enjoyable movie. Low budget but good acting with a good plot. They do go about explaining a lot in the story line it's not just people running around killing trolls for no reason or a stupid horror movie full of typical cliche's you find in most horror movies. I found it in the horror section on here but to be honest it was scary at all but it was extremely entertaining. I would recommend watching.,1412726400,,424,4.379746835443038

4438327,5,B004OBZMBS,"This is the movie Blair Witch wanted to be.

As a Norwegian incapable listener, speaker, or interpreter,my experience in reading the subtitles impacted my interpretation.
The multiplication of emotion effect or having to read the script, while listening to actors, and process what you're seeing, adds a level of intensity, that makes Trollhunter more effective than a movie in your language.

The effects and actors were great. I really did feel as if it were a documentary/reality program.",1412467200,,491,5.282051282051282

8437077,4,B004OBZMBS,"We like it. Great effects and even thought the whole thing is in a Nordic tongue, we can still understand what is happening. Scary real at times, which is what you want in a Monster Movie.",1525046400,,188,4.25
8437078,3,B004OBZMBS,"A trio of students tries to make a documentary about a rogue bear killer in Norway. After way too much set up, they find the guy and discover that he hunts something much bigger than a bear. He hunts trolls for a secret government department that wants to keep the trolls contained to their territories and kept away from the public eye. The troll hunter reluctantly lets them document his work.

The movie is a found footage film in the vein of The Blair Witch Project, complete with opening title cards claiming the footage was found on a couple of hard drives and edited down but not enhanced with special effects. And end cards claiming the students have disappeared and anyone with information should contact their local police. As often happens in found footage films, the set up takes too long and the scenes of running away from danger are less interesting and less plausible--the camera is just jiggling around the landscape with maybe some sound effects or the occasional glimpse of something significant. How you feel about found footage films will be a major factor in your enjoyment of the film.

The movie has a weird dynamic--the troll hunter dismisses fairy tales as a source of information but the trolls definitely can smell the blood of a Christian (the troll hunter is not so sure about Muslims). Happily, the movie doesn't bother with a scientific explanation, it just states characteristics of these trolls and you either take it or leave it. The filmmakers are aware of the ridiculousness of the premise but take it seriously enough to keep it out of the realm of mere comedy. The movie is more drama and horror but has enough comedy to make it fun.

The landscapes are truly beautiful, so as a travel film, this is a delight. How you feel about landscapes will be a minor factor in your enjoyment of the film.

Slightly recommended, as a bit of foreign geography and creative license showing someone hunting trolls in modern-day Norway.",1524614400,,1960,4.7558823529411764

The trolls are amazingly realistic, and the agency, TSS, both attempting to protect the public while practising fervent dishonesty will be familiar to anyone who has ever worked for a public service agency.  Trolls get enraged at Christian hymns, heads up if you travel in troll country.  The Norweigian scenery is so dramatic and lovely it is worth watching for that alone.  I think this movie is unique, and definitely worth a watch.  It is primarily a comedy, so if horror movies are a turn-off, don't hesitate to watch.",1513641600,2,601,4.740384615384615
