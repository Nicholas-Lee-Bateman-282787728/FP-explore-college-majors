8000973,5,B0000DGKI3,Bear in the Big Blue House is so special for younger kids.  He is one of the characters that teaches respect and manners instead of a lot of junk.  I was very particular about the cartoons that my kids watched and this was one of the good ones.,1383955200,,244,4.0625

8000975,4,B0000DGKI3,"As usual, Bear and friends are wonderful. My 3 1/2 year old didn't like this one as much because there is less music and more talking. But as she gets older I'll think she'll be able to follow along more.  As for me, I reviewed it and thought it was good.",1253404800,,255,4.0
8000976,5,B0000DGKI3,"Bear in the Big Blue House and his friends make for fun, education entertainment.  Bear is a big friendly bear with a great singing voice.  Great lessons are taught in this video and the songs are catchy. Your kids could be watching worse.",1232323200,2,239,4.534883720930233
8000977,2,B0000DGKI3,"My 16 month old son and I love Bear in the Big Blue house. We have many of his shows and love most of them. But, this one was a flop. Not sure if it is the new format and music or the new, more mature themes, but it didn't work. My son pays no attention to this DVD, but loves the others.

Opt for ""Dance Party"", ""Bear for all Seasons"", and the nighttime ones and skip this one...",1095206400,4,380,3.810126582278481
8000978,5,B0000DGKI3,"Here I am a 24 year old married woman who loves Bear in the Big Blue House!  Oh and yes my 13 month old son does too.  He has been enjoying Bear since he was 8 months old and he is almost 14 months old now and every time he hears this video come on, he runs into the living room and plops his butt down and can't take his eyes off it.",1071187200,4,334,3.5616438356164384
