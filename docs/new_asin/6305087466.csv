972135,4,6305087466,"Originally released in 1988, this movie is one of my all time favorite horror flicks. Not because of gore or the usually included gratuitous bimbo nude shots in the other movies, but because it messes with your mind. It leaves you with the feeling that it could happen.

This masterpiece is from the mind of Wes Craven long before he was known for directing the Scream trilogy. Craven drew his inspiration from the book of the same name written by E. Wade Davis. Davis' book was his own true experiences penetrating Haiti's voodoo culture in order to obtain information on the drug, as well as the drug itself, which was said to create zombies. However, Craven did exaggerate scenes for the movie. What he didn't exaggerate was the atmosphere - the film was filmed in Haiti for most of the movie, until the film crew were warned their safety could no longer be guaranteed (Haiti was having real life unrest during the filming).

Bill Pullman, playing ethnobotanist Dennis Alan, does a very convincing job incorporating realism in to the movie and his character. He makes you believe what he is going through throughout the entire movie.

After a trip to Haiti, a large pharmaceutical company talks him in to going back in search of the elusive ""zombie powder"", which he learns, the company wants to use as an anesthesia. His timing couldn't be worse as he lands in time for the country's revolution. Dargent Peytraud, played by the always creepy Zakes Mokae, doubles as the chief of police and the region's leading voodoo priest. While hospitable at first to Dr. Alan, he soon becomes wary of this American's nosing around and questioning their culture. In not so subtle way, Dr. Alan is warned that his time there is over.

Once back home, Dr. Alan is troubled of the fact that he had left his friends in Haiti in trouble, not to mention what he may have brought back with him. Namely, Marielle Duchamp played by Cathy Tyson. Marielle was instrumental in assisting Dr. Alan. Having made up his mind, he dares to go back.

Dargent learns of Dr. Alan's return and is not happy. He unleashes his voodoo fury to teach Dr. Alan a lesson in meddling. But things don't go as planned. Good vs. Evil until the end.

I'm going to leave you hanging on a couple of points because while this movie is easily categorized as horror, it is also - in my opinion - a psychological thriller as well. It keeps you thinking, and its not predictable. After almost 20 years this movie still gives today's movies a run for their money.

And don't forget - inspired by a true story",1169683200,3,2557,4.618942731277533
972136,5,6305087466,"When i watched this movie for the first time, years ago, i was amazed.  I have watched it again a few times since, and I'm still amazed.  This movie not only deals with the plot of an American doctor galavanting all over the globe to find that one mirical drug, but also deals with how a different culture percieves what the drug can do to their own people.  It's another religion vs. science movie.  I love these types of movies because the subject matter can be explained scientifically but yet leaves that hint of *what if?*
For example, when the good Dr. was participating in the making of the drug, certain rituals were used to make sure the drug would work properly.  Now, a logically minded person would know that those rituals could have been left out, but there is the hint that they shouldn't be because dire concequences would befall the user.
All of the hallucinations could be explained by the drug in some form or fashion, but the mystery wouldn't have gotten solved if he hadn't hallucinated in the first place.
Overall i found this movie thrillingly intense and intresting.  The cast was perfect for the plot.  I wouldn't change a thing.",1041292800,2,1153,4.622549019607843
972137,5,6305087466,"This brillant 1988 film, about voodoo was directed by Wes Craven. It stars Bill Pullman as Dennis Alen, and Cathy Tylson as Marielle. This film was based on true events. Dennis is a Harvard anthropologist and is called up by his old professor with a job for a pharmaceutical company. He is to go to Haiti and investigate the rumors and folklore of zombies. A man who died 7 years earlier, was found wandering in the village. He is to go there, and find out how he has come back to life. Dennis goes to Haiti, and meets Marielle, a doctor who treats the mentally ill, and since zombies have no control over themselves, she gets a lot of them. Dennis and Marielle go on investigating, and they find out, people are turned into zombies through a powder through the skin. Dennis is a scientist, and doesn't really believe this. Little does he know, there are things about this voodoo powder that science will never know. All of this is going on as a strict dictatorship is running Haiti. The leader does not want Dennis investigating this. It is rumored he is a powerful black magician. What will Dennis learn after his decent into a mystical, dark world in Haiti?
This film has a very creepy mood, and is filmed mostly in Haiti. It has a documentary feel to it. The acting is done very well, as is the direction. All top notch. This is one of the best religious films I've ever seen. It explores voodoo, the rituals, and deities. Some scenes are very scary. There is a torture scene no male will ever forget. There is also a good romance subplot in the film, that works well with the two main characters. I have nothing but positive things to say for this film, except one: some effects are not needed. I recommended this to all film lovers. Take a chance, with an alternative religious film, its quite interesting. 5 stars. Check it out.",1036281600,6,1835,4.480597014925373
972138,5,6305087466,One of the best newer zombie movies. And based on true facts. Becareful who you upset when you visit Haiti!,990921600,,107,4.4
972139,5,6305087466,"Yes, the movie does take some liberty (lots of it) with the book, _The Serpent and the Rainbow_ by Wade Davis, but I liked it anyway.  I first saw this movie when it came out originally.  I liked it then, and since I've recently been reading the book, I decided to watch it again.
A Harvard scientist is sent to Haiti to discover the secrets of zombification, after having undergone a hallucinatory encounter with the forces of evil in the Amazon.  Once in Haiti, he explores the underground world of Voodoo with the help of a psychiatrist contact.  He ends up contracting for a special zombi-making powder with the help of a Voodoo shaman.  However, a corrupt government official (also a black magician) discovers this and intimidates the scientist into leaving (after a harrowing scene in which he punctures his scrotum with a large spike, <ouch!>).  He leaves Haiti, but not before the Voodoo shaman who promised him the powder secures it for him.  Back in the United States, he discovers that the powder's effects are indeed promising.  (He intends to use this to create a new form of anesthesia.)  However, he is continually plagued with visions and nightmares involving his own death and burial and the corrupt black magician.  He decides to return to Haiti to confront this evil yet again.  In Haiti again, he is immediately taken by a friend who offers him magical help.  But, the evil magician discovers this and has the doctor sprayed with powder, turning him into a zombie himself.  He appears to die and is buried.  Another zombie hears his screams as he awakens from his agonizing catatonia in the graveyard and digs him up.  Finally, a revolution occurs in Haiti, and in a confrontation between good versus evil the doctor must meet the magician in battle, who now controls his soul.  This movie offers a bizarre interpretation to the phenomenon of zombification.  (Of course, for the scientific approach read the book.)  It is entertaining and worth watching.
The movie has tried to capture something primal, and that is man's fear of the great beyond, death.  It leads us to ask the question of what is death and can death be conquered.  By far the most disturbing scene in the movie is where the scientist is buried alive with a tarantual in his coffin.  The idea of being buried alive is so horrendous that it operates on the nether-regions of man's unconscious.  This is what makes the scene so disturbing to watch.",987120000,2,2434,4.758949880668258
972140,4,6305087466,"I am a fan of Voodoo cults (being a denizen of New Orleans for five years)  and Wes Craven in general (Though his Nightmare on Elm Street series did  degenerate over the years). This film is extremely fast-paced and  entertaining overall. The images come fast and furious, particularly during  the ceremonial scenes. It gets a bit boggged down and confused in the  latter stages, but not enough to entirely distract from the denouement. The  acting is generally excellent (there were very few characters I didn't find  believable) and the script is on a par with the book from which it is  derived. I found myself involved with the central character (the  anthropologist), which is as much as one can ask from a film of this  variety. I enjoyed the local color and the feeling of location  authenticity. Some of the Ken Russell derived special-effects tended to get  in the way, but didn't hinder the overall treatment. At some stages I did  believe I was reexperiencing ""Altered States,"" however.",965779200,23,997,4.863095238095238
