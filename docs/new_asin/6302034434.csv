419527,3,6302034434,"This second film is just as interesting as the previous one except that there is no suspense. We know what he is going to do and what is going to happen before it is even hinted at on the screen. Then the pleasure comes only from the way the various tricks happen and the succession of them. We know there will be dynamite in the car, that he will lose a wheel, that the car will have a crash, just to speak of the car. And that is what happens. Now the details and the particulars are for you to discover them in the film. That he may be baited by some dumb woman is obvious and has to come but we know that he has already seen through her and that he knows he is being dragged into a trap. Now, how is he going to get out of it? That's what you must discover by yourself. And don't worry he will get the main trafficker but how is another story. A speed boat is no match to our busy beaver on the river. We also know when he is going to be wounded. They did not know what bullet-proof jackets were in those days. It's true recently it was discovered that some GIs did not have that kind of equipment in Iraq. But what is the meaning of such a film? This insistence on hunting the traffickers and this blindness that does not see that it is the prohibition that creates the problem. But the film is a constant and perfect illustration that there is no value what so ever that can stand in the way of this moralistic crusade against the forces of evil. Why not simply legalize these goods so that they can be properly observed and under surveillance? When something is not illegal or pushed out of the way it is all the less fun to use them, to do them. It is the forbidden or the restricted that is attractive.

419528,5,6302034434,"This picture came out in 1975 and it was the second in the three part series of the life of Sheriff Buford Pusser. Bo Svenson takes over the role of Sheriff Buford Pusser, and Luke Askew plays the role of Mobster Pinky Dobson. The last that we saw Sheriff Pusser he was laying in a hospital bed after him and his wife who was killed in ambushed Sunday morning drive. After Pusser recovers he goes after the men that killed his wife. Is Pusser able to complete the revenge that he's after or does the mob try to take him out before he successes. The only thing that bother me about this picture that this was an actual true story. How could you leave in a town with this kind of crime and yet don't do anything about it.",1170201600,,719,4.179856115107913
419529,3,6302034434,"Near the end of the Original WALKING TALL, Sheriff Pusser's wife is killed while the mob is attempting to kill him. Now it is time for payback. There are a few changes, though.

Bo Svenson replaces Joe Don Baker as the likable sheriff. He does a creditable job but, under the circumstances, he is less concerned with the niceties of exactly following the law.

He's still effective, though. He is so effective that the mob is desperate to get him and hires a variety of hit men to do the job. One of the mob leaders, in particular, is just as obsessed with getting the sheriff as the sheriff is with getting them. That leads to an intense conflict and no concern for niceties. That means violence and mayhem.

Even with his proclivity for violence, the sheriff is concerned for his people. He is still a ""nice"" guy unless you are one of the people who is responsible for the problems. He still manages to get most of the small fry but the big fish still elude him.

This is not a bad movie as sequels go but it is not as good as the original. Anger can only take you so far in progressing the plot. It cannot make up for a lesser script and lesser story.",1159228800,7,1154,4.279816513761468
419530,4,6302034434,Bo Svenson is damned good in this. No he ain't the actor we were used to having in the role since he ain't Joe Don Baker but he's very good in this. He has a real integrity about him and conveys a hunger for justice.,1102896000,7,216,3.8222222222222224
419531,2,6302034434,"""Walking Tall"" was a big sleeper hit in 1973,making around 40  million dollars at the box office. Adjusted for inflation that translates to  around 100 million in today's dollars. That is  considered a legitimate  blockbuster by Hollywood's standards. Not bad for a low budget movie with no  big stars from a small  independent studio. Buford Pusser said in an  interview that his ""only criticism of ""Walking Tall"" was  that it wasn't violent enough"".That's saying something. Pusser served  three two year terms as sheriff from 1964 to 1970,""Part 2 Walking  Tall"" (as it was originally called,now it's Walking Tall 2,big  difference)takes up where the first one left off. Part 2 covers perhaps a  year in the Sheriff's life. I first saw Part 2 in the theatre when it first  came out in the summer of 1975(the summer when ""Jaws"" first came  out) and I'm sorry to say I was disappointed in this followup. Bo Svenson  took over the role of Sheriff Pusser,after Joe Don Baker decided it would  be better not to play the part for a second time. At 6ft. 5in. Svenson  physically looked more like the actual Buford Pusser but I didn't think he  was nearly as good in the role. Joe Don Baker who is a mere 6ft. 2in.(however  he still walks tall),and hails from Texas and went to the prestigious  Actor's Studio,is a fine actor and he gave a powerful,emotionally charged  performance in the first film that is sadly lacking in Part 2. Also,Part 2  had a different writer,a different director,even a different studio(the  studio which released the first film called Cinerama  Releasing,unfortunately went out business the year before),American  International Pictures released Part 2. American International went under  back in the early '80's,after 25 years in the movie business. The first film  had a more adult R rating. Part 2 was considerably toned down compared to  the first film,it was only PG.Part 2 plays more like a luke warm '70's  style TV movie. Bo Svenson played Sheriff Pusser again in 1977 in ""The  Final Chapter:Walking Tall""(which I never saw),and again in a TV  series that ran on NBC in 1979,(which I also never saw),the series was  short lived,it ran only for a few months.",969321600,17,2186,4.871934604904633

419689,4,6302034434,"Walking Tall Part II, 1975 film

In McNairy county citizens are destroying the gambling equipment and furnishings from the ""Lucky Spot"". Buford's doctor says he should consider resigning because of his injuries. But Buford won't rest until he catches those who shot him up and killed his wife Pauline. His enemies get together to conspire. Pinky Dobson is told to finish the job this time or he'll be put out of the whiskey business. They will make it look like an accident this time. Buford will run again, he is a hero to the people. Stock car racing is a popular spectator sport. Can it be fixed by creating an accident? A dollar of corn and sugar creates a $6 bottle of moonshine, a better return than growing crops. A call about ""drunk and disorderly"" brings the Sheriff. Can he handle it alone? [Is this a set up?]

""Steamer"" resists arrest, there is a gunshot. Buford calls for help and they quickly arrive. Back home he sees strangers. Who are they? Buford recognizes a man in a photo, he is from Boston. He orders a new and unmarked car. They get a search warrant for another distillery to raid. They are dressed in camouflage. One man does something stupid. This still is destroyed, and their vehicles. Witter plans a car accident for Buford. Could someone tamper with his car's wheel nuts? Buford sees a car following him, then speeding past him. A whiskey runner? Can rough dirt roads cause an accident? Another set up? Witter has a plan to trap Buford. Buford wants that blue car stopped. He learns that driver is in town buying Black Angus cattle. The search warrant allows a search of this car. There is collateral damage during the search. They find a bottle of rye whiskey for evidence. ""You're my kind of Sheriff"" says a Deputy. A friendly woman doing research meets Buford.

Moonshiners are caught. Who is paying them? One prisoner tells of another place, it is raided. Will the men talk? Buford needs to get to the man at the top. Two hunters see another still and report it. Can that woman get information? Buford gets a telephone call. But first he checks his engine and sees a problem [No dogs to warn about strangers?] A tripwire warns of the approaching Deputies. Later a truck with wooden planks is stopped and searched ""Who's your boss?"" A deal is made for information. A Deputy borrows Buford's car. On the road it goes out of control and crashes! It was sabotaged. Can the neighboring Sheriff chase Pardee into McNairy county?

Buford ran a background check on that Graduate Student. Can she lead him on? Buford isn't fooled and sends her away. Witter gives his associates one last chance, or else. The neighboring county Sheriff calls Buford so he can setup a roadblock to stop that car, but it goes off the road. Can they set up a roadblock on a river? The Sheriff raids another still. Boss Dodson drives his speedboat along the river until he hits a log. Margaret visits Dobson in the hospital. Can he escape? A Federal official is investigating Dobson now. There are shots and another car chase. [This pads out the film.] Margaret talks. Buford sends word to cover that boarding house. Ray Henry is trapped. But he gets off a shot before going down. Buford rides in an ambulance again. Later we see what happend. Did they make it look like an accident?

This is based on a true story, but changed for dramatic effect. Many rural people only work par-time (seasonal) and look for other jobs to scrape by. Some can be tempted to work at an illegal activity. This story educates you about organized crime outside the big cities. Ever wonder why they don't make movies about organized crime in the big cities like they did in the 1930s?",1381968000,,3665,4.615030674846626

419715,3,6302034434,"Apparently Joe Don Baker wanted to do other things, so Bo Svenson replaced him in this follow-up to Walking Tall. Originally, the real Buford Pusser was actually signed to portray himself in this film but died in a car crash within 24-hours of signing the contract. The film was originally to be called ""Buford"". Bo Svenson is a better and more versatile actor than Joe Don Baker, although Baker became a friend of Buford Pusser and his family. Today, Buford's daughter Dwana is still in contact with him. According to her book ""Walking On"", Dwana got her feelings hurt by Bo Svenson the first time they met when he told that she ""should go on a diet"". She said the producers forced him to apologize to her. I had the honor of meeting Mrs. Helen Pusser (Buford's mother) in June 1979 and she told me that she didn't care for Bo Svenson after he told the family to call him ""MR. Svenson"". Maybe this film was not as successful as the original because it was pretty well ""sanitized"" of the graphic violence and nudity that Walking Tall became so well-known for. This film was rated ""PG"" when it was first released in 1975 but would probably get a ""PG-13"" today. It doesn't really offer a very satisfying wrap-up of the original film's ending, but it is still worth a look for all admirers of Buford Pusser.",1346371200,,1304,4.529661016949152
