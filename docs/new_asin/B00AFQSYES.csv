8551133,1,B00AFQSYES,With no tab showing you what Andy Aledort is playing so you can take your time and recreate it this DVD is useless. He jumps around too fast and there needs to be a tab diagram of the lick so you can learn it. I literally pitched the DVD after 5 minutes and I am a long time blues player. Save your money.,1474416000,,305,3.857142857142857
