796242,4,6304160062,"I saw this movie a long time ago, when I was a kid, and went back to view it again this week. It really is one of the best movies I can think of for children to see, especially your daughters. It's dramatically compelling and enjoyable to see even as an adult, and it teaches children the valuable lessons of standing up for what you believe in, doing what you know is right even when other people don't agree, and giving of yourself to those less fortunate. Caddie is a courageous, strong-willed girl who really understands herself and how the world should be. And she's willing to do whatever she can to make it better. I can't imagine a better lesson for a child to learn.",1103241600,3,675,4.365079365079365
796243,5,6304160062,"Caddie Woodlawn starring Emily Schulman is based upon Carol Ryrie Brink's JOHN NEWBERRY MEDAL Award Winning book ""Caddie Woodlawn.""  Brink's book chronicles the real adventures of her grandmother (Caddie) as  a twelve year old tomboy growing up in  Wisconsin in the mid-1800s.  With  her brothers Tom and Warren, Caddie's wild ways upset her refined Bostonian  mother -- Caddie would rather swim across the river to visit her friend  Indian John than stay at home with her sisters and learn to knit.  Caddie  is the apple of her father's eye -- but even he knows that she must grow up  and learn to be a woman.  Mrs. Woodlawn invites her cousin Annabelle from  Boston to teach Caddie how to be refined -- the visit turns hilariously  disastrous when Caddie and her brothers try to teach Annabelle the ways of  Wisconsin --  Annabelle is tossed from a mare, their sheep eat every single  one of the ""eight and eighty buttons"" on her dress -- and she  attempts a somersault -- little does she know that they've stuck an egg  down her dress..... Despite Caddie's childish pranks -- the novel is truly  inspiring as Caddie must stand up to an entire town of men to save the  Indian tribe across  the river from an erroneous ambush.  The men of the  town are convinced that a murdered pioneer family in a nearby town is the  work of Indian John and his tribesman -- as the entire town gathers at the  Woodlawn house (terrified as they await a massacre by the Indians)  a group  of vigilantes (Mr. Woodlawn NOT included) plots a surprise ambush  -- which  Caddie overhears in the barn. She knows that the Indians are friendly --  but she is the only person who can avert a tragedy.  As she secretly  prepares to make the dangerous journey to the Indian Camp her tattletale  Cousin Annabelle catches her -- but agrees to keep her secret.  Finally  Caddie courageously rides back to her house with Indian John -- where after  several tense moments -- the misunderstanding is revealed.
****If you are  looking for a true story of the triumph of goodness and the incredible  strength of the human spirit -- embodied in one young girl, I highly  recommend the novel ""Caddie Woodlawn"" by CAROL RYRIE BRINK --  this movie version is entertaining and very recommendable-- but the drama,  hilarity and truth in Caddie Woodlawn's story can best be found in the  award-winning novel itself!!!",935712000,15,2375,4.706601466992665

796320,4,6304160062,"Caddie Woodlawn is a great movie that shows a girl's courage to stand up and do right even though it is not always the popular thing to do. I watched this movie every time I'd go visit my grandparents and really love the movie, however I noticed the DVD cuts parts of the movie out that are in the VHS and unless you have seen it before, different parts leave you wondering how different things have happened in the movie. (example: how she got the silver dollar) The VHS that has the entire movie I'd give 5 stars, since the DVD cuts parts out, I have to give it a slightly lower rating, although I still do like the shorter version.",1314144000,2,634,4.24793388429752

7863351,2,6304160062,"My daughter and I LOVED the Caddie Woodlawn book, it is such a charming and sweet story.  After reading it, we were really looking forward to watching this movie.  But, in hindsight,I wish we hadn't!  We were sorely disappointed by this movie; it didn't follow the book at all!  It changed the story line, left out some family members, and didn't even touch on some of the key scenes that we loved reading about in the book.  It lost all the charm and sweetness of the book.",1435017600,4,474,4.402298850574713

I have also visited the home area of where the grandmother of the author lived and made it even more fun to read.  I bought it for my granddaughter, but had to read it again first myself",1434240000,,299,3.806451612903226
