8299942,5,B001EYV2XK,"I have been looking for a good, quality video on India that would show what life is on the subcontinent for quite soemtime. Unfortunatley, what I had come across until this video was a myriad of freak shows that exploited some of India's more ""exotic"" faces and tried to present them as representing the whole of India. With Dicovery Atlas India, I have found a video that shows a realistic picture of the slums of Mumbai (both positive and negative). The video also delves into the changing caste system, a Hindu wedding, the economic boom, etc. I would recommend this video to anyone interested in seeing the real India. As a middle school teacher I have to say that D.A. India & China have been well worth the investment.",1235260800,4,724,4.62015503875969
8299943,1,B001EYV2XK,This is not the entire 2 Hr documentary. It has been shortened to 43 min. I was really disappointed as I thought it would have both episodes.,1228176000,11,141,4.2592592592592595
