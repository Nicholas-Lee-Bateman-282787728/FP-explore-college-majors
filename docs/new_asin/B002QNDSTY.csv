8377829,5,B002QNDSTY,Excellent story!  A love triangle complicated with a mysterious back story and the main character's sudden break from who she thought she was.,1405382400,,142,5.173913043478261
8377830,4,B002QNDSTY,"I initially had a hard time getting into ""Pretty to Think So"" at first because it concerns itself with New York and the world of finance, two things that I know little and care less about.  The film also has an air of upper-class ennui, which is always a major turn-off.  But the story also concerned multi-cultural relationships, something that I have a personal in, and that was were the hook was.

The directors, Francis Hsueh and Steven Hahn, are former corporate lawyers from New York who quit their jobs to focus on their true passion, filmmaking, so it makes sense that they would create within the world that they know.  Their first film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Party/dp/B000MQ53F4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Party</a>, was a documentary on the Asian party scene in New York.  ""Pretty to Think So"" is their first feature film.

The story features Hanna (Pia Shah), a Stanford graduate who was just laid off from her job at a major investment firm.  Hanna grew up as the only Indian girl in Chinatown, and has fond memories of her childhood friend Alex Yuen who she has not seen for a long time.  The night she gets her pink slip, Hanna goes out to a bar where she meets Jiwon Kim (Louis Ozawa Changchien), a hot-shot and confident corporate lawyer.  Jiwon and Hanna soon become an item, and the out-of-work Hanna dreams of a financially secure future with Jiwon.  The situation is complicated, however, by the sudden appearance of a grown-up Alex.  Hanna childhood friend/infatuation had fallen into a hard road of gambling and hustling, but now was reformed and worked as a street pastor to at-risk youth.  She suddenly finds herself caught between the comfortable and secure future offered by Jiwon, and the ambiguous yet passionate nature of her feelings for childhood-companion Alex.

This film is well-shot, and Hsueh and Hahn have a keen eye for visual language. There was definitely a ""New York""-ishness about the film that would be better appreciated by those that live there.  A knowledge or interest in the inner lives of lawyers and finance would also help.

One only has to look at the title of the film to see how things are going to end. ""Pretty to Think So"" comes from the Hemmingway book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sun-Also-Rises/dp/B000BMHVSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sun Also Rises</a>, where Lady Brett Ashley suggests that she and Jake Barnes could have been happy together.  Jake cynically replies ""Isn't it pretty to think so"" implying that their happiness was doomed no matter what.

In the same hand, ""Pretty to Think So"" is about endings.  The dot-com bubble and dreams of easy wealth could never last.  America's pre-9/11 world domination could never last.  Hanna's love for these two men, built as it is on such shaky ground as it is, could never last.  But isn't it pretty to think so?",1267660800,,2931,5.1804670912951165
8377831,5,B002QNDSTY,"""Pretty To Think So"" is riveting on many levels. It has strong characters and very gripping relationships. The connection established to the setting -- New York City, is visceral and unique. While the story shares some features of a classic plot device, this film is set apart by carefully-developed layers of the unconventional and unexpected, as themes of romance, loyalty, faith, love, inter-cultural friendships and relationships, ambition, honor, and fate dance in an out of the story through which the three main characters interact. Highly recommended as a film that will make you think, feel, and keep you engaged throughout.",1262995200,,633,5.34
8377832,5,B002QNDSTY,"I'm a fan of these directors, and watched their first documentary, ""Party"", which was very good.  This is their second film, and totally different from the first as it's a movie.  I didn't know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised and ended up loving it.  The plot was original, characters unique yet people I could identify with as someone working in corporate America.  It grapples with subjects that I rarely come across, like complex human relationships, bundles of strong feelings/characters, flaws and perfections.  The ending was surprising and resolved nicely.  I highly recommend it.",1261440000,,599,5.252631578947368
8377833,5,B002QNDSTY,"This film captures the essence of a love triangle gone awry.  The movie does an excellent job of relating to the audience in so many different levels.  I really enjoyed the raw HD footage that this movie was shot in, and appreciated the music, which was created by the directors themselves.  I got to meet the 2 directors at a film festival last year and realized how resourceful they were in producing this movie!  I applaud the directors for sticking their neck out there and showing the viewers that with enough hard work and passion, you can succeed in anything you do.",1261008000,,573,4.588235294117647
8377834,4,B002QNDSTY,"I've been following these two talented, young indie directors in the wake of the fantastic - yet epically under reviewed - ""Party"" (sometimes I leave that film playing as background at my house parties; query whether available on blueray for my MC high def...).  This is a great second piece of work, though I find the cinematography of Party more striking.  As with Party, the look into cultures and cliques is impressive and eye opening.  I highly recommend this film for those interested in Wall Street, finance and the lives of high powered bankers and lawyers.  Good work guys.  Can't wait to see the third project...",1260921600,,622,4.830188679245283
8377835,5,B002QNDSTY,I have lived in New York City for 5 years. Few movies capture the essence of finance and relationships the way this film does.  These filmmakers have a unique point of view and gift that should be acknowledged. Did I mention the acting is terrific?,1260921600,,248,4.511111111111111
8377836,5,B002QNDSTY,This movie keeps you engaged from beginning to end.  It's full of universal messages in a distinctive New York setting.  The characters are deeply appealing. You keep rooting for all--heroes and anti-heroes-- for very different reasons. And the ending... well you will keep thinking about this movie long after you finish watching.  I highly recommend it.,1260057600,,355,5.303571428571429
