5679887,2,B00BX49BJI,"Length does not make a film an epic.  This film had 2 major sets - the farmsteads of the rival clans - the rest of the film was shot in what appeared the Czech countryside, but it is very hard to tell as there are almost no long shots.  Obviously shot on a low budget.  The cinematography is crystal clear, but very claustrophobic - I kept trying to see what the camera wouldn't show.  Very little plot and character development.  ''Marketa' tries very hard to emulate Tarkovsky but falls way short.  Beautiful cinematography does not make a movie great.  (I kept wondering if I was watching the same film all the 5 star reviewers saw!)",1380240000,6,636,4.478260869565218
5679888,5,B00BX49BJI,"I think others have expressed well what a wonderful film this is, but the reviews are for old editions. First off, it's a great film. It reminds me of Tarkovsky and of ""the Passion of Joan of Arc"" in some ways. It has that kind of classic drama infused in it.

The good news is that Criterion has done a wonderful job with the transfer. The mid-tones look great and the restoration is good without looking digitally hashed-up. The sound has some problems inherent to the original film. Much of the dialogue is looped and favored with slap-back echo. It's a minor disturbance for such a treat of a film but I did find myself wondering if those voices were inside my head sometimes!

Criterion didn't play it safe this time and brought a stunning work of art into our homes. Kudos to them for not pandering and doing all the expected movies and for their usual fine and careful restoration work.",1372204800,15,893,4.506172839506172
5679889,5,B00BX49BJI,"If you can imagine a cross between Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublev and Leone's Once Upon A Time In The West (all made within a year of each other), you might have a notion of what Vlacil's Marketa Lazerova is like. Throw in a dash of Bergman's Virgin Spring, and you're almost there. Named by Czech critics as the best Czech film of all time, Marketa Lazerova is a poetic social critique/examination of human kind, in particular when operating outside the confines of ""civilization.""

The film is set in the Middle Ages,* when family clans competed to rule the harsh territory seizing everything within their reach that they were able enough to claim and defend (not unlike the ""old West"" for a time), a time when religious and social order (established by the church, alongside the king and his army) was not fully accepted, and clans were used to operating in accordance with more primitive codes and authorities largely based around shamanic/mythic insights, the most basic offeudal ethics, and the strength/toughness of family numbers, from the clan leader on down.

What sets it apart is the cinematic poetry, and anyone who has trouble with the narratives of Tarkovsky, or a modern master like Malick will probably have trouble with this film. While, a straight forward story line does exist at the core, this film speaks on many levels, and making sense of it not only requires careful consideration of everything we hear and are able to see, some of which seems contradictory until we realize that not everything is actually happening, or at least not literally as it is depicted.

Mythic poetry is what it is, and it is the kind of film that opens up once you begin to question into it.  I would begin with why it is called Marketa Lazarova (the name of a character whose part is not all that big)?

The film is almost 3 hours, and ample time for absorbtion and reflection are necessary, so anyone eager to check the next film off their list will probably need to come back to it when they are ready and able to give it more time and space.

*That it is set in the middle ages doesn't mean that there are no modern day parallels, particularly in times of war.",1369180800,32,2162,4.646596858638744
5679890,5,B00BX49BJI,realizes that none of the 2008 -2012 (if any)  reviews has anything to do with this disc except re:plot of the film.  Neither does this one.  Am looking forward to after people buy it and review the actual disc Amazon is asking us to buy and providing old reviews unrelated to anything but plot to make a buy decision myself>,1366329600,8,325,4.383333333333334
8574932,5,B00BX49BJI,"I hadn't heard of this movie or indeed its director until I read about the parallels between this film and 'Andrei Rublev' by Tarkovsky, a film maker I adore. It's hard to get to the level of Tarkovsky for anybody, but I think this film holds its ground very well compared to the vastly more famous 'Rublev'.

The story seems fairly simple: in the Middle Ages the well-to-do Lazar tries to get his cherished daughter into the safety of a monastery but fails as the price is too steep. Lazar also has to deal with a rather wild and unruly clan living nearby whose members routinely rob travellers. On one of those raids Mikolas, son of clan head Kozlik, spares the life of two travellers, one of which is the son of an important clergyman. Kozlik knows this will bring trouble and adding to his vexation his daughter falls in love with the young man.
Mikolas, on a mission to Lazar, gets beaten up by Lazar's men and Kozlik in a rage orders a raid on Lazar's farm. His men wreak havoc and Mikolas abducts and rapes Lazar's daughter Marketa, with a surprising twist: they genuinely fall in love with each other.
When an army arrives Kozlik tries to hold them off but gets captured. Mikolas tries bravely but foolishly to rescue his father from prison and impending death but fails. Marketa, for her love for Mikolas rejected by her father, is wedded by the army commander to her lover as he lies dying.

As in Tarkovsky's films I found a lot of poetry in this rather grim and violent tale. And as with 'Rublev' I found the way the distant past was portrayed totally convincing. A rich and rewarding film with gorgeous cinematography and quite perfect except for the echoey sound of the voices. Another splendid release by Criterion.",1525478400,,1730,4.577419354838709

8574938,2,B00BX49BJI,"Breaking the case's spine of this Blu-ray when opening it the first time must have been a premonition of things to come. I knew nothing about this film and read the back cover's description which convinced me to buy it on a whim. I expected to watch a medieval story akin to 'The Return of Martin Guerre' but what I saw was a story almost impossible to follow. Honestly I was disappointed in this Czech film. I was confused too much and I had to read Wikipedia's article about to make sure I followed the plot. Even their description was a bit hard to follow. I admit this work requires your best attention as it jumps around more than the average film. I'm sure it requires more than one viewing to understand it but I also don't want to invest more time watching squalor and mostly cruel people. One can say the same thing about 'Martin Guerre' with its rural medieval setting but that film is easier to digest and the better of the two.

On the plus side, the photography, sets, and costumes make you feel you are living in those times and the restoration is remarkable. The strange music is always interesting and compliments the action. The actors also make you believe their portrayals are real and uncomfortably so. However I would have preferred a more conventional way of storytelling as I found it hard to follow. My wife and I watch a lot of foreign films so we're used to seeing different types of narrative and editing. She gave up on it and I finished it although I admit the non-linear plotting made me doze off a few times. OK that's not being very objective but that's just us and I wonder if other viewers will be honest enough to admit they had the same reactions. I know some reviewers here have a higher opinion of this film but I think it's one that viewers will either be fascinated by it or find it confusing and unpleasant to the point of boredom and turn it off as I was tempted to press my remote's button. There's no middle ground here. I'm in the latter half and will say in this case the whole (as in the film's gloomy story line and convoluted editing.) isn't equal to the sum of its parts (as in scenery, acting, costumes, score, etc.). It's almost a sin for a film lover to trade in a Criterion, but I'll sleep peacefully later.",1417132800,7,2261,4.39618138424821
8574939,5,B00BX49BJI,"Great Czech film, good pic and sound quality and abundant extras. I'd got the DVD version and, after watching it, decided to collect its bluray edition. Nothing to regret.",1413590400,2,171,4.931034482758621
8574940,5,B00BX49BJI,"The acting is amazing. The cinematography is incredible. Most Americans, lets face it, aren't going to put up with a relatively subjective and slow-moving film with several leaps in the narrative. Ultimately it is a tale of sin, repentance, rebellion, redemption and absolution, and seriously dysfunctional families. Dude, I mean sssserioussssly. And you get to see all of the gory details of their glorious dysfunctions.

I found myself sympathizing with the characters, particularly the initially child-like Marketa who loses her innocence. I found myself wondering where they were or what would befall them. There was a sense of it being an origin of man tale akin to Clan of the Cave Bears with feudal pagan clans living like animals despite it being the 13th century, and with the vast scope of Once Upon A Time in the West. At all times, you must look and listen for symbolism and work a little to construct the disjunct, subjectively told story with jump cuts aplenty. In that sense, it's a bit like 2001 which jump cut a strange odyssey of the evolution of man into space. If it is a little ""slow"" or ""boring"", I suggest taking a break and coming back to it. Black and white often makes people feel distant from a story, and emphasizes that this is a story about something that happened a long time ago.

The musical score deserves mention in its own right. It was truly beautiful, mixing modernistic and medieval elements. At times, it's akin to Carl Orff's Carmina Burana in its bombast and references to medieval music, or invoking religious choral beauty.

Given that the majority of us don't understand Czech, we can't understand some of the things that the director tried to achieve with language. And we don't know from watching that he made his actors live as they did in the film for two years until they were really acting according to more primitive instincts. I'd say that the work paid off. I might actually watch this again someday. And I didn't think I would say that when I was in the middle of it.

I'm pretty sure this movie is just fine without going for the Blu ray edition.",1402704000,13,2102,4.703804347826087
