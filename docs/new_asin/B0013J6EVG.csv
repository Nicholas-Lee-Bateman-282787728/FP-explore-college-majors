8251210,5,B0013J6EVG,A wonderful movie with a Wizard of Oz feeling and background shots that are little changed from the TT's running today.,1465603200,,119,4.714285714285714

8251212,4,B0013J6EVG,"I was agreeably surprised by the quality of this presentation, as well as the dialogue and photography.  I had never seen george formby, or florence desmond before this film.  I was impressed by formby's comic timing, and florence desmonds comedy skills as well.  Of course, the period TT races appealed to me as well as the story.  Miss Desmond is quite the singer and comedienne, and a looker as well. It is a little gem of a film.",1367712000,,433,4.512820512820513
8251213,4,B0013J6EVG,"I must disagree with the reviewer that said this movie will probably not appeal to American audiences, I am American and thought the movie was quite fun!

I was not familiar with the cast, but my husband and I are both motorcycle race fans and found ourselves wrapped up in the story.  We enjoyed it very much.",1360108800,2,310,4.421052631578948
8251214,4,B0013J6EVG,"The films of the singer/comedian George Formby, the Lancashire lad who was a very big star in the UK in the thirties and forties, will probably not appeal to American audiences. Formby, possibly the male equivalent of Gracie Fields, played the working class hero, gauche and innocent, who had no pretensions above his station. Usually his films followed a formula whereby he overcame some challenge and won the heart of the girl. The attractions are that Formby was a first class technician in spite of his ""dumb"" demeanor, many of the films are nicely put together and when he picks up his ukele and sings, his charm is obvious.

""No Limit"" is a very popular comedy whereby Formby plays a chimney sweep with an ambition to win the Motor Bike Time Trial on the Isle of Mann. The film benefits from many historic location shots, a first rate spritely leading lady in Florence Desmond, who is a charming singer, and an exciting climax, the motor  bike race itself with some spectacular stunts. The print is first rate but there are no extras.

If you are interested to learn about Formby, this film might be the best place to start.",1284854400,5,1130,4.668341708542713
