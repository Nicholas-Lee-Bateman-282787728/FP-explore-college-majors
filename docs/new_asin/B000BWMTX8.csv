8605067,4,B000BWMTX8,"Interesting, thoughtful mix of two genres - a coming of age film that's
sweet, nice, (if occasionally a touch sappy), and a deeply moving,
complex political morality play about the price one pays for trying to
live by one's ideals.

Two leftists, almost killed by the Argentine generals, raise their son
in the backwoods, trying to help organize the people there against the
local land baron.

Into their lives comes a charismatic, sympathetic, but cynical
geologist, unhappily working for the land owner, but unable to buy into
his new friends' idealism, leading to all sorts of emotional and plot
complexities.

I'd like to re-see this, and I could imagine rating it even higher, but
the over the top score, and few more clichd elements stopped me from
really flipping out for it, while still finding it a solid, strong,
thought-proving film.

Not sure if I saw the same DVD as the reviewer who had such a bad
experience, but I don't remember, or have any notes, on it being
that awful a transfer.  But sometimes there are several versions
of a film floating around, so...",1301616000,3,1074,4.783783783783784
8605068,2,B000BWMTX8,"EVEN THOUGH THE MOVIE IS SUPPOSED TO BE EXCELLENT, THE TRANSFER IS HORRIBLE.
SEEMS LIKE A BAD HOME VIDEO TRANSFER.
NO MENU, NO CHAPTERS, NO EXTRAS, SUBTITLES ARE OBLIGATORY (NON OPTIONAL)...
I WISH THIS HAD BEEN ADVERTISED SO THAT I WOULDN'T HAVE BOUGHT THIS DVD.
IT JUST RUINS THE MOVIE EXPERIENCE.",1261958400,8,299,4.882352941176471

And I recommend too:
