Super Funky Fun!
This is a very entertaining story, much more so than Genesis Of The Daleks which I find to be tedious.
I would say the Rick James looking android adversary-competitors of the Daleks are from the planet Superfreak but that song wasn't released until 1981.
They are so freaking cool, even as android-robots. The actors portraying them are so talented they actually make the characters very interesting and it is so good to see some ethnicity in a Doctor Who story. I find it refreshing. It makes this story feel realistic.
The Doctor himself is given a fair amount of silly dialogue and there are some humorous scenes along with intense situations and suspense. A decent balance is maintained throughout, it held my interest well.
I like the scenes with Davros, the Dalek's  creator being pushed around by Tom Baker! A comical situation in itself.
The Daleks themselves are at their most annoying here, I would much rather douse them with saltwater than listen to them.
They remind me of a set of salt & pepper shakers my Grandmother used.
This is also the (humorous) debut of the second Romana, Lalla Ward, Tom Baker's future wife. She gives an impressive performance.
I think it's obvious this story was written for Sci-Fi fun rather than Moral Statement and I am okay with that.
It really doesn't make much sense that Davros would still be alive after so long a time but then again anything is possible.
This is a decent adventure with sincere production values and it shows. Everyone involved with this production was very professional.
I am consistently impressed by the overall quality of the first four eras of the Doctor Who series.
They really are British TV at its best.
Like all Doctor Who stories this one is unique for its own reasons.
I found it very worthwhile and stimulating.

As with my other Doctor Who PAL format Region 2 releases the live video has a matte instead of glossy appearance for whatever reason. Not a problem.
This disc has a CGI update option for some (17) special effects but is unnecessary, the original work looks fine.
Extras include Terror Nation, a half hour documentary of Terry Nation's affiliation with Doctor Who and I believe a 9 minute interview with the director Ken Grieve.

This is perhaps, can be considered as one of the more fragile adventures featuring the Doctor's most infamous antagonists. The lack of budget, the surprising lack of ambition and the lazy treading out of the Daleks mean the main feature is one really one that some may consign to Dalek history, and those interested in the continuity of Doctor Who adventures. The look, of the Movellans is ludicrous. These dreadlocked exiles from a disco event that finished early, their space suits - skin-tight and silver may have been all the rage in a 1970s Wind and Fire tribute band. Yet the basic plot had so much potential that was unfortunately realised, which could have been made real gem of narrative. This was to be the very last script; Terry Nation did for Doctor Who he had long been interested in the idea of a robot race as adversaries to the Daleks.

In essence, the plot threads boil down to oddly familiar territory as it emerges that the Doctor is back on Skaro, many generations after the happenings of Genesis of the Daleks. He soon determines that two dangerous extra-terrestrial races are on the planet; the Daleks, who have returned to find their architect Davros; and the Movellans, who have an ominous schema of their own. From the get go the audience is distracted by the opening scene where Romana, undergoes a regeneration process, `tries on' a number of bodies before choosing the Astra likeness.

However, notwithstanding all of its teething troubles, the narrative does work. this is mainly due to Tom Baker, who portrays the Doctor well. He is so amusing as he meanders the sets, on occasions ad-libbing his dialogue in an off-hand fashion before coming out with something unpredicted and, possibly, unscripted. He is the personification of being very alien here in his mannerisms and responses. With this revisit to the Daleks, we see his (the Doctor's) actions in the Genesis of the Daleks have influenced the Dalek race and this is an important part of the Dalek universe.

In terms of viewing figures, over 13 million viewers saw this series, which made it a hit at the time it was broadcast. As mentioned early this may not be the best Who-Dalek narrative, but it is not that bad either.",1422316800,2,2309,4.779448621553884
