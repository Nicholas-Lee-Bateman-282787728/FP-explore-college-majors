8207450,2,B000T28PII,"I found this documentary somewhat lacking, I bought it because my husband wanted to use it for a history class and hoped it might provide a picture of continuing explotaion in Africa as a legacy of the colonial period. I was interested in finding out more on the topic of Blood Diamonds. Neither I nor my husband came away satisfied by this cursory and un-inspired synopsis.",1495497600,,374,4.681818181818182
8207451,5,B000T28PII,"Interesting look at conflict diamonds or blood diamonds. History Channel always does a nice job at explaining and analyzing the subject. It gives both sides of the story and archive film footage. The story is told in layman terms, so anyone can follow and understand what is/are Blood Diamonds",1456790400,,293,5.0

8207453,5,B000T28PII,"If you want to really understand Diamonds and their impact upon African countries that have them, this is the one stop documentary.  While reading quality books about blood diamonds are even more detailed, this gives a surprisingly complete understanding in one sitting.  Outstanding work.  Watch out for the gore, as there are lots of graphic and disturbing video segments.",1391212800,,374,5.305084745762712
8207454,3,B000T28PII,"The copy that I watched said this would be 50 minutes and really it's 90.  Also, I assumed this would be a re-hash of ""National Geographic: Diamonds of War.""  Luckily, it was not.

This work starts way back at Cecil Rhodes and the DeBeers brothers in Southern Africa in the 1800s.  It also covers more than Sierra Leone, speaking of Angola and the Congo.

This work warns viewers about disturbing images, but that just skimmed the surface.  You hear of men, women, and children not only being maimed, but committing horrid acts of violence themselves.  The work doesn't say much of the environment, but seeing what would have been lush, green land turn into turned over sand for miles and miles must be devastating for African biodiversity.  I don't recall this work mentioning AIDS, but there is talk of dislocation, slavery, extreme poverty, and rape, so this must be exacerbating the HIV pandemic in Africa.

In watching this, I was thinking, maybe people need to turn on diamonds, in the same way that some no longer value furs.  However, this work (and National Geographic's) implied that it is very difficult to tell what is a ""conflict diamond.""  In the same way that the movie ""Monster"" ends with the message that the viewer can do nothing about the defendant, this work kinda suggests the problems will continue so long as somebody values the gem.",1199836800,13,1356,4.776824034334764
