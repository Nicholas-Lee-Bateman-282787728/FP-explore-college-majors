8461585,5,B0058IBBCU,"One of my favorite documentaries and a refreshingly different perspective.  This is the side of the war you don't learn in the USA unless you know where to look.  These documentaries are an excellent place to start: there are many simple maps, diagrams, and statistics.

It has at least 1. the original Russian/Ukrainian narration, 2. the original Russian/Ukrainian narration with English subtitles, and 3. English narration. The narration isn't constant.  There are plenty of pauses to give the brain a break to stop and admire the beautiful filmography.

Aleksandr Dovzhenko's hand in this is obvious in the beautiful filmography reminiscent of his Ukraine Trilogy.  The language is also stunningly beautiful, a true testament to the culture of the USSR and many Slavs.",1429228800,6,771,5.278688524590164
8461586,4,B0058IBBCU,"I rated this DVD a ""Four"" only because there were certain scenes that repeated throughout the program. I get it, historical film footage is tough to come by, and is probably very difficult to edit, but if the same scene needs to be repeated, try hiring a different writer for the script.",1395705600,6,287,4.538461538461538
