8494245,5,B0066UWTYS,"My girl friend and I are taking local dance classes, and I cautiously bought the Shawn Trautman video only for that first class. It was so helpful, that I bought more, and wrapped them up for Christmas, both as a nice gift, and to demonstrate my commitment to continue indefinitely with dance instruction, since she is so very patient with my motorcycle hobby! When my girl friend's daughter saw this Cha Cha video on Christmas day, she latched onto it right away! She had years of professional dance instruction as a child, and yet still appreciates the quality of this product. If it doesn't come back, I'll just have to buy another!",1388534400,,635,4.678571428571429
8494246,4,B0066UWTYS,"I bought several dance instruction DVDs by Shawn Trautman (and others) to help my father to learn the Latin dance steps. Shawn has several wonderful dance instruction videos, but I have learned to read the labels carefully. If the title is ""[Dance Step] 101,"" three of the five sections will be devoted to clapping out the beat, learning how to connect to your partner (hand placement) and tips for giving a strong lead. The fourth track offers several dance steps. The fifth track puts it all together as the couple dances.
Since I wanted my father to be familiar with appropriate steps for medium-tempo music played in ballrooms, my strategy for teaching him was to buy the appropriate ""sampler"" DVD so he could see the dance performed [see my other reviews], the ""Cha Cha 101"" DVD reviewed herein and Shawn's ""Beginner Cha Cha"" DVD. (I was planning to leave this dance instruction DVD with my father, but he went right for the ""Beginner"" DVD -- which teaches more steps.
This particular product is good enough for a novice and I think that Shawn Trautman is a great instructor for men. I own many of his other dance-instruction DVDs for country western and disco dancing. Since my father went right for the ""Beginner"" DVD, I am biased against the more simplistic ""101"" product. Both versions of the subject teach the Basic, Progressive Basic, Crossover Breaks, Chase and various closings -- twirls, spins, et al.  This product does not teach the ""Back Break"" step (nor the ""Sliding Doors"" step -- which is my father's favorite)! Neither product gives deep enough discussion of Cross-Body Leads.",1358208000,,1597,4.8713235294117645
8494247,5,B0066UWTYS,"This is our third Shawn Trautman 101 Dvd and we loved it.  Apparently, all their 101 dvd's have the same organization of: 1. Intro, 2. Rhythm & Timing, 3. Connection and Style, 4. Leading & Following, and 5. a Review.  This format works extremely well for my wife and I, and it makes it quite easy to return to particular sections of the dvd for follow-up review and practice.  Although it might be elementary for experienced dancers, I found the Rhythm and Timing section particularly helpful in getting me started, and I liked the way Shawn breaks down the beat and then builds it from clapping, to walking, to the basic dance step.  Shawn and Joanna again do a wonderful job of explaining the basics together for both the leader and the follower, and they share many helpful tips in both the Connection/Style and Lead/Follow sections of the dvd.  They cover several moves beyond the basic step and by the end of the dvd you will have a complete enough group of moves or figures to thoroughly enjoy the Cha Cha and look confident on the dance floor.  The Trautmans obviously have a great love for dancing, and they are quite successful in passing that love onto their students.",1327017600,4,1179,4.617224880382775
8494248,5,B0066UWTYS,"The Shawn Trautman Cha Cha 101 is extremely easy to follow. Shawn teaches the leader's part, and his wife Joanna teaches the followers part.  In no time, you will be doing the Cha Cha and loving it! If you have questions, you can ask Shawn on Facebook! Customer Service is outstanding!  I paid less for the Cha Cha 101 than I did for 15 minutes of private lessons...and I can keep practicing with the DVD!  Such a great value!",1325721600,,426,4.367088607594937
8494249,5,B0066UWTYS,"This is a wonderful series from a truly talented dance professional. Instruction is incredible,quality and content of the DVDs are outstanding.
