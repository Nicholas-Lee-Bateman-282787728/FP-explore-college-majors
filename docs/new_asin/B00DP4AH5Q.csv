5839820,5,B00DP4AH5Q,This movie is highly underrated. I stumbled across it in a dvd store and had never heard of this movie or read the book by Oliver Jeffers but the cover was cute and the animation looked good so I purchased it. I'm so happy I did! Very touching story about a boy who finds a penguin on his doorstep narrated by Jim Broadbent. Wonderful 3 dimensional animation and sweet story that makes you feel warm and fuzzy at the end. Apparently this was a TV short from 2008 and has aired on some children's shows like NickJr. but I've never seen it. My children love it and it kept their attention throughout. Highly recommended!,1382400000,22,618,4.4298245614035086
5839821,4,B00DP4AH5Q,"Very cute, I was excited to finally get this as my child LOVED the trailer for it on another DVD, turns out the movie in it's entirety doesn't entertain AS well, though she is four, an older child or just different might like it more. I like the idea of the story and the narration, etc. Only thing is there are some parts that are ""almost scary"" then turns out not-so-much, and there is one part at the end that is pretty darn scary for a younger kid i.m.o. and a pretty sad part but if the kid sticks through those parts they will see the happy ending.",1518912000,,554,4.138888888888889

5839837,2,B00DP4AH5Q,"The animation is beautiful, so is the music but unfortunately the essence of the book is almost completely lost. You don't really see any friendship forming between the boy and the pingouin.
The boy spends almost the whole movie scowling, frowning and basically being a jerk to the pingouin. He slams the door in his face the first time he sees him, doesn't want him to touch any of his things, angrily wrestle a little radio that the pingouin was interested in away from him, even pushes him around and seems to only want to get him back to the South Pole to get rid of him...
There's no story telling or anything during the journey, the boy seems to make a point of ignoring the pingouin, even turns his back to him most of the time.
The giant octopus who helps them after the storm is a nice touch but that's pretty much it. My four years old was unsettled by the boy's attitude and kept asking why he was so mad and grumpy.
I like the book better and so does my daughter.",1499212800,3,975,4.275675675675676

5839850,5,B00DP4AH5Q,I saw this DVD on Sprout while visiting my great nephew. I could not get it out of my mind. Found it through a third party seller on Amazon. I am sharing it with the other children...and enjoying it again myself.  This is a wonderful story about friendship and how first impressions are not always correct. True friendship takes time to grow.  I also enjoyed the amazing section about how the DVD was created.,1483488000,2,409,4.513513513513513

This was the best six dollars we ever spent - our 2.5 year old has watched it a dozen times already.  I thought the part with the storm might be too scary for a young toddler, but it doesn't seem to bother him at all.  It has all the charm and beauty of Oliver Jeffers' book with the benefit of keeping our son's attention long enough for us to do some laundry or prep dinner.",1481500800,,502,3.9019607843137254

I was refunded when I called to ask how to turn on the don't buy anything option which was nice, but a week later I went ahead and bought it for him again. He LOVES this movie. He watches it most days before bedtime. It has nice calming music. He has named both the boy and the penguin (though they actually do not have names in the film). He is sad when boy tries to leave the penguins. Penguins are probably his spirit animal.

We don't watch any TV, so I was searching for dvds my 2-year-old son could watch that would be gentle and good quality, and this fits the bill perfectly.

We don't watch much tv, and I'm very fussy about content for my little guy.

5840129,5,B00DP4AH5Q,Very nice story and my kids watch it over and over again. I am happy with this movie over all.,1390262400,,94,3.75
5840130,5,B00DP4AH5Q,"If you have a child between 6 months and 60 years old, this movie is a must see.  If there was a collection, I would own it.  Highly prized in my collection, for the simple fact that it is a simple story of an ordinary boy doing the hard stuff parents would be proud of.  It will make you smile, cry and laugh all in under 60 minutes.  It will take you back to a time of imagination and hope.

Must see!",1390089600,2,403,3.8658536585365852

5840133,3,B00DP4AH5Q,"None of the characters speak. Very little happens in it. It is very short. My two little children like watching it, but I don't enjoy seeing it very often.",1388016000,,155,4.379310344827586
5840134,5,B00DP4AH5Q,"This is a beautifully rendered story for young children, I hope to see more from this studio; its great to see more smaller studios producing great 3d animations",1386115200,4,161,4.785714285714286

5840137,5,B00DP4AH5Q,"Have been a fan of Oliver Jeffer's books featuring the boy and the penguin for several years, and have been eagerly awaiting the chance to finally see the short. Well worth the wait. Well animated and stays true to the book, while fluffing it out to fill the minutes. Simple story with a great message about friendships. Young kids might be afraid of the ocean storm scene the first time through.",1382918400,3,396,4.591549295774648
8595733,5,B00DP4AH5Q,"My boys (ages 7 and 9) LOVE this short film.  It was based on a very sweet book, same name and same author, but the movie has more content in it.  The music in the movie is so soothing and the narration is very calm and well done... The animation is colorful, sweet and aesthetically appealing.  I ended up buying because my kids keep wanting to see it over and over again.",1529452800,,373,4.152777777777778
8595734,5,B00DP4AH5Q,My kid loves this penguin movie. Wish they come out with another edition or a part 2.,1528848000,,85,4.0588235294117645
8595735,5,B00DP4AH5Q,"Very cute!  This is a bit slower moving than most children's cartoons.  It's VERY BRITISH!  Adorable!  If you like ""The Gruffalo"", ""Room on the Broom"" and these types of animated shows then you will love this one!  It's a must have!  Although it is a short film it's definitely worth having in your collection and as an Amazon ""Add On"" item the price is nice!  The theme is based upon the notion that everyone doesn't fit in with the group and everyone needs someone, even if that someone is a somewhat unexpected attachment.  These two are inseparable at the end of the day!  A special friendship.

8595741,5,B00DP4AH5Q,"We love this absolutely adorable movie about the unlikely friendship between a little boy and a lost penguin.
