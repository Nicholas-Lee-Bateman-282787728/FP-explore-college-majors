3830426,5,B00208N7ZU,"As the others have mentioned in their reviews, this is a great instructional dvd.  I'm not an instructor but found it very informational with the detail on the various exercises at the beginner, intermediate, & advanced levels.  In conjunction with taking classes and using my home reformer, this is a great tool to have.  I highly recommend this dvd.",1328832000,9,351,4.915254237288136
3830427,4,B00208N7ZU,I'm a Pilates Instructor I've been a fan of Jennifer Kries' Pilates video series for a long time. This master trainer series is just as excellent. Not only is she truly a master trainer but she seems like such a nice logical person. If I lived in New York I would absolutely train with her.,1298937600,7,290,4.290909090909091
3830428,5,B00208N7ZU,"If you are a Pilates instructor or training to be one, this DVD is definitely worth the money. The video was shot while Jennifer was presenting to Pilates instructors on how to train a client on the reformer. In addition to verbal cues, Jennifer provides many good tactile cues to help your client move correctly and safely into the exercises. She also provides tips on how to keep yourself safe.  She has a great presentation style and takes you through the entire classical reformer repertoire, beginning level through super-advanced. I was trained in STOTT PILATES, so it was nice to see the classical repertoire. This DVD has expanded my knowledge and teaching capabilities. You can pay much more money and attend a live workshop, but I think this DVD is just as good.",1289088000,15,772,4.804511278195489
3830429,5,B00208N7ZU,"This DVD is perfect for someone interested in learning more of the details of pilates movements.  Whether a pilates trainer or student looking to enhance your movements Jennifer Kries gives many helpful hints and explanations.  She says in the beginning that this shouldn't replace a certification program, but this is a great place to start if you are interested in knowing more without paying $5000 for a certification course right away.",1281398400,9,439,5.169014084507042

8348458,4,B00208N7ZU,I love Jennifer Kries' teaching style. This is worth the money and time investment if you are a Pilates instructor.,1474761600,,115,4.8
8348459,5,B00208N7ZU,"I just bought a reformer and have done Jennifer Kries videos since 2003. She is a phenomenal teacher. I have really loosened up from muscle stiffness, and gained more flexibility doing her, The Method videos. I bought this for me, not for me to teach others.
One complaint I did have is that I wish they had provided more than a side view. I wish I could have an view looking down, so that I could see how her alignment was and her feet.
She gives you great cues where you can help your client if you are a Pilates teacher. Hands on cues too. As far as how to help your client with the stretching, doing the exercises correctly and making sure they are properly aligned.
But other than that, I feel she really educated me on how to properly do the exercises. It had 3 levels, beginner, intermediate and advanced.
The video is over 3 hours.
It was also good to see her be funny and have some personality come through, rather than just instructing.
Now I want all her videos.",1442966400,5,973,4.3224043715847
8348460,4,B00208N7ZU,great video if you have access to the equipment,1414972800,,47,4.333333333333333
8348461,5,B00208N7ZU,Excellant DVD!  Jennifer is an awesome instructor anyway but in this trainer video she gives great tips about typical form breaks and how to assist in correcting them.  I think every Pilates instructor could benefit from the information on this DVD.,1408406400,,249,5.048780487804878
8348462,5,B00208N7ZU,"So far I have really enjoyed the mat series. I have only gotten through the first half of the video. There are several portions, so there is plenty to learn from on this video. My only complaint is that sometimes you can't see clearly the model's ab area. She is wearing all black, the mat is black, and Jennifer is wearing black so sometimes they blend in together. Jennifer's instructions are clear and informative.",1395964800,,417,4.648648648648648
8348463,5,B00208N7ZU,"This video I got to study pilates  in detailes, because I can't go to certification program, so I have to study at home. And I can tell you, it met my expectations 100%. Jennifer Kries  explaines so clear and demonstrates on her student those tiny nuances, what you can get only during the personal tutorial. She is a great teacher. I have several more of her videos, and I like them a lot. I can recommend it to any yoga-pilates-fitness-dance fan to deepen you practice, get better control and understanding of movement, stay injury-free. Also it is very helpful to teachers to learn with such a great authority as Jennifer.",1389139200,,625,4.672727272727273
8348464,4,B00208N7ZU,Excellent Teaching Tool for Pilates Instructors. The information is easy to follow and implement with a Pilates instructors class for better results.,1375142400,,149,5.818181818181818
8348465,2,B00208N7ZU,"I purchased a pilates reformer and then looked for instructional material. I found this product on Amazon. As this product had good reviews and because I thought I was getting five dvds as pictured with the item as it is presented on the Amazon page, I ordered it.  I thought this would be a decent value - $40 for 5 dvds.  If you are considering buying this go ahead - it may be a great product - but you will not be getting the pictured 5 dvds - just one.  It still may be a good value and may be an excellent product but $40 for one dvd seems expensive and I only ordered it thinking I would receive 5 dvds.  So I am thinking about returning it.  Amazon - or the vendor/seller - should change the picture which accompanies the product heading.",1358553600,11,746,4.188811188811189
8348466,5,B00208N7ZU,I bought this to help me instruct my husband how to use the reformer.  I tried the video myself and found the exercises challenging and fun when I maintained rhythm and reps as Jennifer & her student would take breaks for clarification.  My husband enjoys the videos - a great feat coming from a former weight lifter!,1358380800,4,317,4.543859649122807
