4271156,5,B0046WCM7M,"This was a really good movie and had a twist I didn't see coming.  The main actors were excellent but some of the adult actors could have used some lessons.  This is a movie that should be watched by parents with their teenagers, and they need to talk to each other about it.",1309219200,3,275,4.169811320754717
4271157,5,B0046WCM7M,"I waited and waited for this excellent movie to become available from Netflix, then finally ordered a copy from Amazon.  Well, I just loved the movie=)  It was very inspirational and uplifting.  I would readily recommend this movie to anyone...",1308787200,3,244,5.05
4271158,1,B0046WCM7M,"This film starts out badly, and then half way through it gets terrible. The kids probably could have put in a good performance, but the script is awful and the direction is very poor. It was obviously everyone's first attempt at making a feature film. Too bad, because the subject (teen suicide) deserves a good movie. This is not it.",1307404800,6,334,4.583333333333333
4271159,4,B0046WCM7M,"This is a good movie that shows how we all have an influence on others, whether directly or indirectly. The budget may not be very high, but getting out the message of anti-bullying and appreciating that each of us is uniquely created is definately a high priority these days.  I thought the St. Louis ""Muny"" kid did a great job of acting alongside the Hollywood actors.",1304899200,16,370,4.606060606060606
4271160,5,B0046WCM7M,"This is really a lower budget movie with a powerful message.  The adult actors could use some lessons but the younger actors, especially Leo Howard, did a great job.  The writers and producers should be commended for this film.  Although it did run as a lower budget film, it was one of the best theme driven dramas I've seen in a very long time.  It's not an Oscar winner; it's better than that....it's a truthful film.

Without going into details of the movie which will spoil the affect, I can honestly say that this film will make you want to sit with your family or friends and discuss issues that you would normally not talk about openly and honestly.  It's an eye opening movie that will have you wondering about those around you.

Logan was powerful.  It might have been a lower budget film, but I'm very glad I watched it.",1301702400,39,831,4.456953642384106
4271161,4,B0046WCM7M,this is a good family movie with an excellent theme and is best used if it allows you to talk to your family about the issues it raises after.not exceptionally acted but a very good movie anyway.,1297036800,8,195,4.297297297297297

4271163,3,B0046WCM7M,"Teen suicide attempts are always a tragedy.  This movie was attempting to get the message across, but fails on some levels.  The acting is dubious, in terms of its sincerity and BooBoo Stewart seems very awkward in the role of a religious teen trying to help.  What really is disappointing is the gag reel.  It really is not appropriate for a movie trying to impart a serious message to have a gag reel where the actors are shown laughing during what should be a serious moment.  I am fairly mixed about this movie and am not sure I would recommend it.",1397692800,,552,4.425742574257426
4271164,4,B0046WCM7M,I thought the movie was good but also kinda outdated. Wish it wouldnt have been so slow.  the story line was good though,1394755200,,120,4.217391304347826
4271165,5,B0046WCM7M,"I was a little disappointed at the beginning of the film.  Felt kind of low budget and it may well have been, but as I watched I began to feel the pain of Logan and was soon engrossed in the film.  Carries a very good message for teens and really for everyone.  I would recommend the film.",1392940800,,289,4.035087719298246
4271166,2,B0046WCM7M,"It's difficult to rate a film with a great message poorly, but unfortunately, there are few redeeming qualities in this production.  While I agree the message is important, there are better films and documentaries on the topic of teen isolation / bullying / depression / suicide.  This is not one of them.  The acting is fair at best and sometimes absolutely poor, and the sheer lack of compassionate adults is questionable.  While it appears this is a low-budget (independent) production, I have seen many that are of far superior quality.  It reminded me of an after school special, only those are typically much better.

4271167,4,B0046WCM7M,"Overall the drama was interesting but it works a little to hard trying to get a point across.
The first part of the movie is setting up the situation, and gets a little slow in places. The last part of the movie tries a little too hard to make the point. To tell you what the point is however would be a major spoiler.
The DVD also has a director's commentary which is ok, and both a gag reel and deleted scenes which are both fun.",1387929600,,431,4.023255813953488
4271168,1,B0046WCM7M,"Good story, that being said, acting is awful, directing and camera shots are sophomoric;  good intentions but not worth DVD it's recorded on.  Really wouldn't waste your time or money. : (",1383350400,,188,4.84375
4271169,3,B0046WCM7M,"I don't understand the rave reviews.  This was a good movie and a meaningful one.  It's certainly one no one in my family will forget.  But it is the worst acted, lowest budget production I've ever seen.  It definitely has a message - and had I known the message was ""how to worry about suicide,"" I wouldn't have let my 9-year-old watch it.  My 12-year-old has been panicked about his friends ever since (and it's been months since we saw it).  The best part of the movie is the trailer spoof section.  THAT is worth watching - but you have to sit through the agonizingly sad movie to have it be worth your while.  I'd never, ever watch this again.  And neither would anyone in my family.",1381795200,,688,4.354330708661418
4271170,5,B0046WCM7M,"I thought this movie was a great family movie. A must see for any person growing into their teen years. Has joy, sadness, laughter, family ties, bonding, upsets, and trials... and all with a subject that is important.",1380499200,,217,4.7368421052631575
4271171,3,B0046WCM7M,I did not think this movie was directed right. The actor Leo Howard could have done a much better job but the script and the direction was all wrong. I have seen this young man acting before and he could have done a better job with the right lines. Leo is a forceful young man and to put him in a roll of a wimpering brother was all wrong for him.. Service was really good and I received my movie in record time.,1380240000,,412,3.9759036144578315
4271172,3,B0046WCM7M,It was a great movie I enjoyed it till the end when it just kept on skipping so I could not finish the movie but until then it was good. hopefully my copy was the only one.,1377475200,,172,3.675675675675676
4271173,5,B0046WCM7M,"This is an excellent DVD about the crisis of Suicide among our youth.  This kind of information on a media communication would
have been very helpful to me in my youth because at the age of 13, I had a friend who committed suicide.  Our Pastors and
Priests were all we had and they were outstanding as their compassion and professional counsel helped me and my friends
through a horrid tragedy.  Sensitivity and Listening to another person in crisis - and a help hand - cut across all ages both young
and old. The Movie, ""Logan"" is worthy of your purchase and viewing. Always remember there are those who look up to others -
be there for them.",1375660800,7,643,4.432203389830509
4271174,5,B0046WCM7M,This was tastefully done and handled in an interesting and realistic manner.  It had me in tears.  I really enjoyed the characters and how they matured and developed.  Teenagers need to be listened to as they grow up.  No one should go unheard.  I enjoyed it even more the second time I watched it.,1375488000,2,298,4.444444444444445
4271175,5,B0046WCM7M,must see this move. this move is all some it mad me cry and not much things do that! cant what tell the 2ND one comes out! the boy in this move is hot and i meen hot like a twink a twink is a young boy!!,1369267200,,203,3.3404255319148937
4271176,1,B0046WCM7M,It seemed very local to the place & was totally amateurish. I reckon only the kids that new logan will be interested in it. I felt totally ripped off!,1368057600,,150,4.206896551724138
4271177,3,B0046WCM7M,"Be aware that ""The Lord Jesus Christ"" is listed in the credits.
Logan is an average kid who seems to be overshadowed by other kids and events. He wants to make a movie but nobody takes him seriously.
There is a point to this story that could have been much better scripted and if producers with a larger budget had financed it, better made.
One serious mistake on the DVD is the inclusion of a ""gag reel"" which shows the actors ruining takes by breaking up laughing at the story's most serious moments. If the actors didn't take it seriously, why should I? Or you?",1367280000,,564,4.380952380952381
4271178,4,B0046WCM7M,"This was a wonderful family film. Logan and his brother are growing with parents that are not really there. The movie confronts school bullies and teen angst. There are happy and sad parts. I did not care for how it ended. I think it needed about another thirty minutes to complete the story line. The acting from the kids was realistic and genuine. Booboo plays a Christian kid trying to share his point of view with his friend. Never seen him playing a part like that, I think it was a hard role for him. They all did good and the parents do come around. I recommend this film for anyone with 10 year old kids on up. The subject matter though is harsh.",1367020800,,654,4.282258064516129
4271179,5,B0046WCM7M,Absolutely loved it. Very touching and a heartfelt movie. Highly recommend this dvd for families for awareness and no denials.,1365120000,2,126,5.35

4271181,3,B0046WCM7M,"Perhaps a little far fetched in so far as brotherly relationships, but yes I could imagine a relationship like this but not so intense as the film portrays. I liked the story line and the acting was good. The underlying story about youth suicide, shows quite clearly how sensitive young people are about the way they are portrayed by their peers.
Youth suicide is a big issue in most so called civilized countries, unless we get rid of the bigetory, and name calling within our youth culture its not going to get any better unfortunately. Unfortunately this subject matter is swept under the carpet here in Australia, and education authorities are lothe to talk about it, even the news papers do not report suicides. I believe this would be good viewing for upper primary school children, and into high schools..
At least the film portrays a happy ending but only just.....",1348185600,9,873,4.788079470198675
4271182,2,B0046WCM7M,"My expectations were not fulfilled.  That could be my problem! This is a very average family film.  The topic of youth suicide is dealt with in a sensitive manner and does remind all of us that one of the chief reasons that suicide is attempted or completed is the individual thinks that they are totally alone and have no support.

The acting left a lot to be desired.  I'm think that the youth actors were just beginning in their careers.  Some have gone on to other roles. The adults were self-absorbed and unthinking caricatures.",1341532800,,533,4.627659574468085
4271183,4,B0046WCM7M,"NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE MOVIE ""LOGANS RUN"".  STORIES ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT. SURPRISED TO SEE HOWARD AND BOO BOO STEWART IN THIS MOVIE.  HOWARD IS CURRENTLY A CO-STAR IN A DISNEY PROGRAM NOW, SURROUND MARTIAL ARTS. DO NOT LIKE THE ONE WHO SUPPOSEDLY MANAGES THE MARTIAL ARTS STUDIO. IN MY VIEW, THIS OTHER GUY RUINS THE MOVIE.  AS FOR THIS MOVIE, ITS WORTH THE MONEY IN WATCHING AND IN BUYING IT. HOWARD AGAIN SHOWS THAT HE CAN CLEARLY ACT WELL IN ANY MOVIE PLACED ON HIM. HE WILL GO FAR IN LIFE, IM SURE.",1338163200,,508,4.326315789473684
4271184,5,B0046WCM7M,"The film is about a boy, Logan, who wants to make a movie but the only one who takes him seriously is his brother, Tyler. However, when Tyler is stressed out he snaps at Logan and says that he will never finish the movie and that the idea was stupid to begin with. Logan takes this hard and hangs himself. Tyler is so devistated that he swears to finish Logan's movie. He speaks with the other students and finds out that many have thought of or even tried to commit suicide.
This film is very moving. It made me laugh and cry and sends a great message to teens. Logan brings to light the serious issue of teen suicide and how simply talking to someone about your problems can make you change your mind. I highly recommend this film.",1334102400,3,733,4.280575539568345
4271185,4,B0046WCM7M,"I'd heard about this film, and was perplexed not to see it (then) available in the UK. By total chance, I ended up buying something else from Amazon USA and found the film listed on that site. I ended up paying what I consider 'rather over the odds' (down to import taxes perhaps) for this film, but I don't in the least regret searching it out.

The write-up I had read about it was accurate: it is a moral tale, and like some USA films aimed at families carried a fairly prominent Christian message. I was relieved to find that this did not in any way spoil the film because sometimes such a stance does affect the 'reality' of the storyline.

I found it an uplifting tale, well-acted and filmed. The youngsters were pretty credible; I am a long-serving state school teacher so I know what is and is not believable in screen portrayal of children. In short, it's an engrossing and largely realistic tale, well told, and one feels genuinely uplifted at the denoument. I have kept actual description of the storyline to a minimum here so as not to spoil anyone's enjoyment.",1333843200,5,1073,4.525773195876289
4271186,5,B0046WCM7M,"My family have watched this over and over several times and love it.  The story is very good and the actors seem very professional.  The story does a very good job at dealing with some very difficult subjects.  The three main characters,(Leo Howard, Booboo Stewart and Patrick Probst) do a great job and compared to a lot of movies on TV these days, this is definately one of the best I've seen.  This has a GREAT ending and great music ! We love it so much, we have bought extras to give as gifts !",1332547200,20,499,4.221052631578948
4271187,5,B0046WCM7M,"This movie is an absolute MUST see for all preteens and teens. It does deal with some issues that are very real these days- bullying and teen suicide. This movie is very clean, and there is nothing in it that is bad. The theme of suicide is dealt with in a very dignified way. Depending on the age and maturity level of your child, you may want to watch it first. My nine year old has seen it. We viewed it together, and have had many conversations about bullying as a result. This is a great way to start a conversation with your family about topics that really matter.
For all of the reviewers who say the actors are not good- this is a low budget film. It doesn't always have to be about the money and special effects, and highly paid actors. In this case, it is about taking a stand against bullies, and teen suicide. It is about saving lives, and educating parents and teachers. Bullying and Suicide are topics that is often ignored, or not taken seriously, until it is too late. This film should be seen by every kid, teacher, and parent and in every high school and middle school across the USA! It is heartwarming, funny, real, and has a twist. Excellent Movie- As a mom of four kids, I highly recommend it!",1331424000,8,1215,4.333333333333333
4271188,5,B0046WCM7M,"When I first came across this movie, I wasn't sure what to expect. There wasn't much information available and the summary left a lot to be said about it.

Aside from a few odds and ends with the writing, the movie is very well done. The story was touching and as I've seen a few other reviews say, it's a must see by parents and teens everywhere. If you have a classroom, youth ministry or just mentor to kids, pick this up and share some time watching it.",1330646400,3,457,4.193181818181818
4271189,5,B0046WCM7M,"Yes, this is a low-budget movie.  Yes, at first it just seems like another hackneyed, pre-chewed, slow-moving, Disney-esque movie about an artistic kid with high aspirations but only a family of shallow self-absorbed, 2-dimensional characters for support.

But then something happened.  A movie totally surprised me:  shocked me:  got me to sit up and pay attention.  It took me for a very intense ride that I was not expecting.  It was like the first half of the movie was all a set-up for an expertly-delivered 1-2 punch that drove home the fact that this movie has a purpose and a message beyond simple coddling entertainment.  Reviewers giving it poor ratings have perhaps missed this.  This is NOT an ""entertainment piece"" there spoon-feed Pablum-entertainment.  It's more a public service wearing the trappings of very likable movie (for the first 1/2; an excellent movie for the last 1/2!).

And the purpose and the message deal with several VERY prevalent youth issues in our society today.  In light of this -- and how expertly the writers, directors and actors take you for an unexpectedly intense journey -- EVERY single negative thing I might have pecked away at suddenly falls into the category of ""utterly irrelevant"".  It's not all spit-and-polish.  But it's amazing how well such a powerful message is carried by so few, young actors.  They have distinguished themselves.

This movies is here to do a LOT more, than just entertain.
It's here to try to save lives.
5 stars isn't enough.

(But I would warn that this is NOT a kids' movie; and that parents of more sensitive tweens might want to pre-view it first.  Even if you don't pre-view, watch it with your young people.  Take the roller coaster ride with them.)",1327017600,5,1731,4.88659793814433
