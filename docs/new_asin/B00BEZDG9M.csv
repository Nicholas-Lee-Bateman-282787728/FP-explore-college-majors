8567457,4,B00BEZDG9M,"Very good movie for the sports genre. Filming was excellent. Hockey action better than most I've seen. Acting and writing was very good as well. Youth hockey fans and parents will enjoy. Reading subtitles is a skill but even if you aren't very good at it or a kid that doesn't want to read, you can pick up enough from the scenes visually and from tone to know what's going on. The 3D - just ignore.",1468108800,,399,4.2631578947368425
