8400370,5,B000NY24Y8,"After experiencing the impact of Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ,"" I wanted a video that presented more of Jesus' ministry, works, teachings and life. This 6 VHS set does a fine job. It is definitely geared for family viewing, as it leans more toward children. But we are to be like God's children, so don't shy away from it. It includes a good amount of Biblical detail, a good account of the times, and the settings are impressive. Even the Jews look like Jews, and the Romans look like Romans. It was very well directed and produced, and Nelson Leigh did a great job in the role of Jesus.

I also highly recommend ""The Jesus Film"" which includes scenes not found in this video set, like the Sermon on the Mount. It also explains at the end of the film that we receive the gift of God through faith - trusting solely that Christ is who He says He is: the Son of God - the manifestation of God in the flesh - and in Christ's payment for our sins on the cross (dying for sinners), and His resurrection from the dead. I highly recommend getting both films for a well-rounded spiritual experience. Lure your children away from today's subculture, and get them focused on a Christ-centered life. These videos will help, as well as reading the Bible in your home with them.",1201824000,,1277,4.43404255319149
