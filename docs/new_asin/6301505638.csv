333195,5,6301505638,"This movie is extermemly funny and thought provoking. The claymation was ground breaking in the field and a pleasure to watch. That the script writers thought to explore the thin veil existing between a writers characters and the writer is ingenius. Then, to explore Mark Twains classic stories and build a fictional story around the interaction of Mark Twains life with the stories and characters...another shot of genius.
Top it all off with thought provoking satire in true Mark Twain style and you have a movie worthy of a place in your library.

This films 25th Anniversary, marks the 175th Anniversary of Mark Twains birth, the 157th Anniversary of Mark Twains pinnacle work, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and the 100th Anniversary of his death.

The Adventures of Mark Twain is an amazing journey of imagination, humour and heart, and a must for fans of Aardman Animations Studio. Tom Sawyer, Huck Finn and Becky Thatcher, stow away with Mark Twain on an incredible journey through time, and built around a plot that features Twain's attempts to keep his ""appointment"" with Halley's Comet! The journey introduces the three friends to a variety of Mark Twains storybook characters from The Famous Jumping Frog of Caliverous County, The Diary of Adam and Eve (Letters from the Earth), Huckleberry Finn, The Mysterious Stranger, and Captain Stormfield s Visit to Heaven. The sequence based on The Mysterious Stranger reportedly received over ten million views upon being posted on YouTube. The sequence was allegedly banned from TV due to its 'disturbing content.'

This unique The Adventures of Mark Twain film combines the visual richness and the magic of the Claymation process, with the sophisticated humour of Mark Twain and an experience to be cherished by all ages. The Adventures of Mark Twain was the first full length feature film in the Claymation process and directed by Will Vinton, who is best known for The California Raisins animation.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: This is a really a special tour-de-force of ambitious stop-motion Claymation animation, whose apparently premise acts as the springboard for a dazzling and often dark study of Mark Twains work. Before Nick Parks Aardman Animations, there was Will Vinton, the stop-motion pioneer who gave life to the name Claymation as well as creating iconic advertising characters like the California Raisins. The Adventures of Mark Twain was his labour of love, but one so poorly treated and it was released in Britain under the title unremarkable Comet Quest. But it deserves to be more than a footnote in animation for its audacious, surreal use of stop-motion to reflect the art of literature.

The reason the film works is of Mark Twain himself, who is a giant in the American culture, and he is nowhere near the same touchstone over here in the United Kingdom, meaning that much of the power and relevance of this film effectively, is one long Mark Twain love-in and is lost slightly in Transatlantic interpretation. But Mark Twain remains a fascinating and eminently adaptable writer, and especially with his pithy epigrammatic sound bites, like if the film dialogue has been forged before films even had sound, and his feverish imagination devised worlds of escapist adventure and absurdist humour really suited to the cinema.

Will Vinton imagines a Mark Twain at the end of his life, aboard his balloon-powered ship on route to meeting Halleys Comet! Its a framing device based on the unusual coincidence of the real-life Twain being born, and dying, on consecutive fly-bys by the comet, which allows Vinton to depict the author as maverick and madman, happily embracing death because hes got his lifes work to be remembered by. And some of that work, especially the quintessential Mark Twain characters Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn and Becky Thatcher, are along for the ride.

The scenes of Mark Twain pontificating to the children, as they ask questions and generally, as well as slightly silly, are some of the slightly flawed part of this Claymation animation film and imagine if we had an American version of Doctor Who, based on a Claymation theme, wow, that would be the most ghastly terrible outcome ever, as this is a typical eccentric British Television type fantasy TV programme and would be useless to have an adaptation with Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyers joining a Doctor Who adventure, especially with their Southern drawl, despite their authentic lingo. But Will Vinton sees the bigger picture and this is a story about the act of writing, and he turns the ship into a living library, in which the stories are perpetually being acted out so that the children can step into Mark Twains fiction shoes.

The film comes to life in short, breezy re-enactments of short stories, two in particular leaping to mind. In Adam and Eves Diary, Will Vinton delivers a very funny, beautifully timed sit-com from Mark Twains wry reimagining of Adam as a carefree man-about-Eden narked by the unwelcome arrival of a woman. And yet, in The Mysterious Stranger, Will Vinton creates an uncanny dread from the tale of Satan, with a robed, headless figure carrying a mask that contorts from a grin to a grimace, who builds a world of plasticine people and then casually destroys them it tires him and of their in-fighting and you see, its a stark, spectral nightmare.

Between these tales, a much more rounded, complex portrayal of Mark Twain emerges, than was initially apparent. He was a dark man, and Vinton isn't shy about showing it, but mostly this is a tribute, and Claymation is exactly the right format for demonstrating the fluid synaptic leaps by which a writer creates stories and characters. Ideas literally spill onto the screen, the clay a writhing mass that morphs and tumbles into new shapes. Vinton is Twains match for exuberant imagination, and he doesnt miss a trick. There are incredibly rich, textured shots that belie stop-motions famously labour-intensive methods. Will Vinton simply cant sit Mark Twain at his organ without giving the pipes pairs of hands that move up and down to play the correct notes, or stop characters noses twitches or fingers tapping in the simplest of dialogue scenes. No wonder Will Vinton never ever made another Claymation animation feature film; he must have been totally exhausted.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Despite its age, The Adventures of Mark Twain has been granted a very satisfying 1080p encoded image presentation overhaul, and the results are quite spectacular at times. While white specks and minor print nicks pepper the film, most every other aspect of The Adventures of Mark Twain high definition is a sight to behold. Detail in the clay is superb, every line, every smudge, and even the fingerprints of the animators are visible. The tangible texture of the clay is full of unending detail, which creates that sense of wonder I spoke about before. Colours are soft and pleasant, primaries are lovely, black levels are deep, and contrast is consistent and despite only seeing this on a very bad VHS tape, needless to say, this is quite an upgrade and the detail is even more impressive. Truth be told, I was surprised how good this ended up looking fantastic.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The Adventures of Mark Twain 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Stereo and 2.0 LPCM Audio Stereo tracks are excellent, especially the two-channel soundscape and is a solid release with its audio. Dialogue and voices are warm, clean and perfectly clear, and is right on the button, and every last sound effect and Bill Screams music cue sounds about as good as it possibly could and even a sense of weight and notable oomph, especially when it comes to Mark Twain's airship, making this one of the more absorbing sonic experiences available on this classic 1958 Claymation release. But the power, faithfulness and unexpected fullness of the stereo mixes, just might take you by surprise. I was swept up in the magic of it all myself. While I would have liked to see a fully realised 5.1 track, especially since there are quite a few parts in the Claymation film that would had benefited from a surround sound track, but this 2.0 track does quite nicely indeed.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Director and Producer Will Vinton: If you're a fan of the Claymation film, you will really will want to listen to Will Vinton retrospectively discuss his Claymation film. Will Vinton talks intimately about how he feels about the Claymation film, and also discusses the different techniques of animation they used throughout the film. This is a very enjoyable commentary, don't miss it.

Special Feature: The Story of Claymation and The Adventures of Mark Twain [1985] [480i] [4:3] [16:44] Here we have an announcer telling us about the early days of Motion Picture and innovators experimenting with different forms of stop motion animation and sometimes they used modelling clay, that eventually came to life on the screen, which we see early examples. In 1932, one such pioneer name Lewis Clark Cook, who made comedic clay animated film called The Little Baker [1926]. However, 2D cell animation got an early foothold and quickly became the norm, especially for animation. By the 1940s and 1050s 2D animation was the dominant force, especially on Television and in the cinema. With lots of cell animation companies swamping the market, model animation or 3D model animation, was largely denigrated and rarely seen. By the 1960s Claymation was completely maligned and called not suited for the animation world. Towards the end of the 1960s, Will Winton, native of Oregon, Midfield and architectural of Berkeley University and here he experimented with stop motion animation and pixilation. Because he was influenced by the Gaudi Barcelona Buildings in Spain, experimented in Claymation and when he saw his first results, had a total epiphany in animation and clearly felt it had great potential. In early 1970s, while working full time in Portland in Oregon, carried on his pioneering work and with the help of college friend, Bob Gardiner, joined as one of Will Wintons team, to make his first 8 minute Claymation, entitled Closed Monday [1974], which went on to garner hundreds of awards, and even an 1974 Academy Award for the stop motion animation. He then went onto making a Claymation for Mountain Fresh Rainer 1975 beer advert. He then followed up with his next project; with a more ambitious Claymation stop motion entitled Martin the Cobbler [2005]. Then what follows is a documentary entitled CLAYMATION: Three Dimensional Animation which lets you into the secret world of stop motion animation and explains in more technical detail and how it is a slow painstakingly process. Then we go much more into detail about Will Winton and informing us about more innovative Claymation films we are informed about and they are Rip Van Winkle; The Little Prince; Legacy; A Christmas Gift; Creation; Dinosaur and The Great Cognito, which went onto winning hundreds of awards over a 7 year period. As time went by, the 3D stop motion improved in leaps and bounds, which attracted advertising agencies, so making great profits for the Will Winton team that helped to other more adventurous projects, like the inventive Claymation Festival of Claymation, that was shown in cinemas around the world, and the two Claymation presenters were Herb and rex., which helped to going onto even bigger projects, like The Adventures of Mark Twain. cinema release. Then the Will Winton Team had a massive hit on their hands, when they went onto to do the TV advert for California Raisins and the amazing raisins dancing to I heard It Through The Grapevine, the eventually they went into popular music videos, especially the Purple Raisin dancing with Michael Jackson, which was so successful, they went onto another Michael Jackson Claymation music video entitled Moonwalker. So from then on there was no stopping the Will Winton Team and their next project was Claymation Christmas Celebration for American Prime Time Television, and also Meet The Raisins; Claymation Easter; The Raisins: Sold Out and Comedy of Horrors, and then branching out into computer animation and their first project was Cool Tools, also the M&M adverts. At the end of the 1990s, computer animation got more adventurous, especially with The PJs series, which featured Eddie Murphy, and then they moved onto Gary and Mike [2001] and because of their pioneering work from the Will Winton team, computer animation is even more popular today and here to stay. This is a great special feature documentary and so very informative, but sad to say, some of the images are not of the best quality.

Special Feature: Behind The Scenes: Pre-Production and Where It All Begins [1985] [480i] [4:3] [6:55] At the start of this documentary, we see the Will Winton Team are all sitting on the floor discussing a particular script, for one of their up and coming Claymation stop motion film and as we go through the documentary, it is broken up into different sections and they are as follows: Script, Production Design and Storyboard, Voice Recording, Recording Actors Voices and reference Filming Their Movements, and with this particular section, we actually the voice actors acting out the part in the Claymation film, while recording at the same time, and we also get a split screen comparing the actors speaking and the actual finished Claymation stop motion film. Next section is entitled Character Construction where we see a person hand dressing the stop motion puppet and eventually we see the puppet in action. Next up is Preparing the Clay which is pretty well self-explanation. Next up is An armature Supports the Figure, here we see the metal structures puppet doing a sort workout, but eventually you see the puppet get fully dressed with plasticine. Next up is Sets and props, where we get to see all the plasticine puppets and the team working on the puppets for certain shots. Next up is Stop Motion Adventure: Moving One Frame at a Time, here we get to see the team showing the painstaking movements of the plasticine puppets on the set, then we see some stop motion film. Next up is Post production: Editing Animation, which again is self-explanation. And finally we have Adding Music and Sound Effects, and again the title says it all. So ends another fascinating look at the Will Wintons Organisation, but sadly there is no voice over explaining what is going on, but what we do have is very cheesy 1960s type music in the background, which was probably okay when the documentary was originally released.

NEW! Special Feature: Crew Interviews [2011] [1080p] [1.85:1] With this particular special feature, it is broken up into 6 separate sections, that you can either watch separately or in one go, and they are as follows: Barry Bruce: Character design/Lead Animator [12:14]; Bill Scream: Music and Sound [10:12]; Mark Gustafson: Animator [Huck Finn] [9:32]; Susan Shadburne: Writer/Composer [9:29] and Will Winton: Director/Producer [12:46]. This is really totally fascinating, especially hearing all of their personal views on working with The Adventures of Mark Twain [1985] and especially to seeing them now in 2011, compared to the first previous special feature documentary in 1985. But what was really nice to see was Will Winton, himself in 2011, and personally looks so much better compared to what he looked like in 1985, on top of all that, he is a very interesting person to listen to and explaining his experiences with working on the 1985 Claymation animation film and was staggered to hear how much it cost to make in 1985, which took a total of 4 year to make and also had a total of 17 people working for him and doing all the fantastic work in Claymation and totally recommend in viewing this special and unique feature.

NEW! Special Feature: The Music of Mark Twain [2011] [1080p] [1.85:1] [19:45] This feature, like the previous special feature, is in different sections, that relate to the different stories in The Adventures of Mark Twain and what you view is one still image used with the actual background music used in each story of the 1985 Claymation film and they are as follows: THE JOURNEY BEGINS:

1. CLAVERAS FROG SUITE: The Jumping Frog of Calaveras County and Frog Reprise To Intro Dark Twain.

2. ADAM AND EVE THEME SUITE: Reuniting After The Fall, Getting To Know Adam, Its A Fish, Its A Fish . . .; Adam Hunting Trip, Family reunion and Adam and Eve  Soul Mates.

3. THE COMET SUITE: Busting In The Comet and  Twain and Shadow Depart.

4. HEROES: End Credits Theme.

Special Feature: Stills Gallery [1985] [480i] [4:3] Here we have a slide show of the Will Winton team, that you have to manually move forward to see each slide and you have different sections and they are as follows: 1. BEHIND THE SCENES:  You get to view a total of 32 individual slides. 2. CONCEPT ART: You get to view a total of 18 individual slides.

Trailer [1985] [1080p] [1.85:1] [2:17] This is a really nice brand new Claymation trailer for The Adventures of Mark Twain.

Finally, The Adventures of Mark Twain Claymation transcends mere entertainment, to become a really thoughtful portrait of an artist and his unique perspective on life and experience. We are shown Mark Twain's compassion and his misanthropy. We are taken on a journey laced with Mark Twain's favourite ingredients: hilarity, terror and poignancy. The Art Direction was brilliantly achieved by Barry Bruce, Joan C. Gratz and Don Merkt. The magical Claymation was executed by William L. Fiesterman, Tom Gasek, Mark Gustafson, Craig Bartlett and Bruce McKean and the Claymation film was beautifully scored by Billy Scream. Highly Recommended!

333348,3,6301505638,"This film is so morbid and strange for a kids movie, yet its entertaining in a way. It stumbles upon Marks other adult oriented works, and adds this weird devils game or something, IDK. Knowing how his other novels are, I guess they wanted to keep the films context in the same vein. But there is one problem with that method, MOST KIDS NEVER READ ANYTHING BEYOND TOM SAWYER AND HUCK FLINT. So if your trying to get yer kids to read MT novels, and introduce them to this, they'll say ""this is stuped, i'ma playing COD Black Opps"".

I dig the Claymation work while its not perfect, but it is far more appealing than some bland CGI rework with the clay model rendered in digital (looking at you 2000s Fireman Sam). You'll like this film if you know and examined Twains novels, or if you are drunk or high and like to see some weird s*** during your ""phases"".

I'm reviewing the MGM DVD release from circa 2005. Extras: Trailer reel for Sony family films. What bugs me here is the case states the films original theatrical is here, but it is not unless I missed it in that crappy excuse of a trailer reel. Audio is ENG DD 3.0 LFE which is serviceable, and has English and French subs. The English subs are SERIOUSLY messed up and have grammar and spelling issues. I guess MGM/Sony at one time got so aphetic that they ether had someone with 3rd rate English do the subs, as they were too lazy and greedy to spend a damn on a title like this. The source it comes from is a nice, clean master that has some grain and very little specks & hairs. The digital transfer however, is another one of MGM/Sony's interlaced failures. The combing is noticeable, but it not as bad as some of their other titles and AT LEAST its free of mooring and banding (The 2005 release of The Mask Of Zorro had a HORRENDOUS transfer. ""High Definition Remaster"", MY A$$!!).

I am aware of the recent release from Magnolia Entertainment. Surprisingly, there is not a lot of information on that release but from what I gathered it is supposedly better than the MGM release. Lets hope it fixes the combing issues, adds the right trailer, and maybe if not too much a proper 5.1 mix.",1384041600,,2149,4.394472361809045

Some parts are dark, some adult humor too, I appreciate this film even more being an adult, and having since read Mark Twain's stories.

There are strong Christian overtones, although they seem to be mocking the religion in favor of science, albeit subtly at times.

""Did you imagine the same heaven would sort all sorts of people?"" Is a line from the movie, when a human trying to get to heaven ends up in another worlds heaven. So I could see how overtly religious people who take the Bible literally would be offended.",1377388800,,854,4.568627450980392

Since this appeared to be a children's movie, I expected more of a historical account that would be valuable in educating young children - Twain's experience as a steamboat captain and how that influenced his stories, the culture during his lifetime, etc.  Instead this movie included some disturbing scenes with Satan, Adam and Eve, etc.  Twain (a Presbyterian) was disgusted with the hypocrisy of some Christians (which comes out in his works).  However, he also held in high esteem those who lived a holy life (consider his writing on St. Joan of Arc).  The Adventures of Mark Twain emphasizes only his skeptical, questioning side, which could be an interesting adult discussion, but holds no value for educating young children.",1375747200,3,831,5.073529411764706

333431,5,6301505638,"This film is a colorful introduction to the works and philosophy of Mark Twain, woven into an artistic tapestry made of clay. Old films with lush color and intricate detail benefit enormously from a high definition transcription, and The Adventures of Mark Twain comes roaring to life in this Blu-ray restoration. It certainly has not been seen in its full glory since its release in 1984, and this lovely edition might even exceed the experience of the original screening.

Although the term ""Claymation"" is now in general usage meaning animation created through the manipulation of clay figures, it is actually a copyrighted word coined by Will Vinton. His Academy Award and Emmy Award winning films showcased the pinnacle of artistic development in the technique, and none more so than The Adventures of Mark Twain. Wonderfully detailed character faces are complemented by lavishly decorated sets and swirling backgrounds, each minute on the screen having required many hours to create. Recent practitioners like Aardman studios in Britain have advanced the art of creating an engaging story with clay figures, but none have surpassed the realism achieved by Vinton.

The Adventures of Mark Twain follows the career of America's premier author of the nineteenth century, as he tells some of his stories to his best-known characters: Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn and Becky Thatcher. The children have stowed away on Twain's airship, which he is piloting toward a rendezvous with Halley's Comet. The stories are connected by a background narrative consisting largely of direct quotes from Mark Twain, who is perhaps now better known for his pithy and cynical comments than for his books. As one of those quotes states, ""Classic books are those people want to have read, but don't want to read.""

Mark Twain's first published story was the Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, and it is presented first in the film. The great majority of Twain's writing had nothing to do with religion, but of the four stories highlighted in this film, three are inspired by the Bible, or touch obliquely on religious themes. We are shown the good humored Diaries of Adam and Eve, then we encounter the dark Mysterious Stranger. The ""stranger"" identifies himself as Satan. Lastly, we accompany Captain Stormfield on his visit to heaven. A few viewers, unaware of Twain's religious skepticism, are surprised and uneasy when they find that he wasn't all about jumping frog contests and whitewashing fences.

I was particularly moved by viewing The Adventures of Mark Twain because I had read while in Jr. High School everything Twain had written, with the exception of the suppressed works such as Letters from the Earth, which was not published until many years after his death. Like a visit with an old, old friend, the film was a bittersweet experience. Twain's works were a reflection of the reality of life, mixing the humor and the sorrow. A perfect example of this duality is taken from the Diaries of Adam and Eve, where after a lifetime of comical adventures, Adam writes the last words in his diary following the death of Eve: ""Wheresoever she was, there was Eden.""",1374537600,,3165,5.057471264367816

333436,4,6301505638,"I remembered this from my childhood. I had only seen it once, and in my memory it had a nightmarish quality. A relative had let me watch it because it was claymation, but he had no idea what the actual content matter was. That said, it's not really for kids. I recently came across it while browsing Amazon's Prime video collection and had to watch it again from the perspective of a ""grown up"" (I also read/teach Mark Twain). The claymation film follows Mark Twain as he seeks Halley's Comet and his own death. He was born the year the comet passed by Earth, and he had it in his mind that he would die when it returned (this actually happened, it turns out). Tom Sawyer, Huck Finn, and Becky (Twain's characters) join Twain on an airship. While there, they get to see scenes from Twain's works. Some are funny/light-hearted while others are darker. There are references, too, to Twain's unfinished work, The Mysterious Stranger, which delves into mankind's duality, the futility of man's existence, and the idea that life is a dream. In the end, we see two versions of Twain walking around the air ship--one is his dark side, which he reveals everyone has. There are many elements that a scholar or fan of Twain will ""get,"" but for someone unfamiliar with Twain or his tales, I think this would just be too weird to appreciate. Still, it's under two hours, and it's an interesting film to watch if you have the time--and aren't a kid!",1370217600,,1436,4.569767441860465

Mark Twain near the end of his life plans an expedition to catch up with Haley's Comet in his custom airship, but didn't count on three stowaways: Tom Sawyer, Huck Finn, and Beck Thatcher(who aren't fictional here). The inside of the airship is leads to several different short stories that Twain wrote, including the steampunk classic of Captain Stormfield. There is some deep metaphysical and philosophic material going on here, like Twain's duality with his dark side coming to life, and the nightmarish conversation with Satan himself.

333576,2,6301505638,"Will Vinton brings his creative genius to the task of bringing complexity and depth to the work of Mark Twain. He does this via putting his Claymation Twain on a hot air steamship to rendezvous with Halley's Comet in 1910, the year of Twain's death. Huck Finn, Tom Sawyer and Becky Thatcher stow away and are subject to Twain's wry observations and humor. Unbeknownst to the kids, Twain's evil twin is also on board, trying to scuttle the journey. The confusion between the works and words of ""light"" Twain and ""dark"" Twain account for some of the journey's dramatic moments.

I would have expected a Twain film to highlight Twain's great works - Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer. But these are mostly missing, except for a terrifying cameo by Injun Joe. Instead, Twain's lesser known, more difficult and adult-oriented works are highlighted - Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven, The Diary of Adam and Eve and Letters from the Earth. The last, with a terrifying Satan playing life and death games with little clay people, is extremely dark and creepy.

Kudos to Vinton for trying to being the ""real"" Twain to life. And kudos with bringing Twain's more difficult works to public notice. Bravo for putting Twain's own sayings into this character's mouth -- though some, like ""as surprised as a Presbyterian in Hell"" are dated and almost impossible to comprehend. Congrats also with showing a man in his humorous and evil-tempered sides. Congrats also for daring to poke pointed fun at Heaven and Hell with any audience.

But is this a kid's movie? The subtitle, ""Where dreams become reality,"" seems to suggest this, but is pretty misleading. There is nothing in the story about dreams becoming true -- other than Twain's morbid expectation that he would go out with the comet as he came in with it. And the odd choice of offbeat Twain material makes this a poor choice for introducing kids to the great author. Not to mention that what was included would be nightmare materials for many kids. I think even some 12-year-olds would find this stuff too much to handle.

Yet ""The Adventures of Mark Twain"" is extremely well made and innovative, if a bit pokey in the dialog. If anything, it will give non-kids a sense of the mature (and often religious) themes that obsessed Twain. Watch the movie, then pick up ""The gospel according to Mark Twain"" to get the full treatment of his often funny, often insightful musings about religion.",1295308800,7,2423,4.803357314148681

333579,5,6301505638,"This movie is rated G, but it's unlike any other rated G film I've seen before.  It's by far the darkest and most philisophical.  The issues of mortality, deity, and the afterlife itself are addressed throughout in all kinds of ways, particularly in the diaries of Adam and Eve.  I actually read Twain's rendering of their diaries in a 1995 edition of ""Essays and Sketches of Mark Twain,"" and they're just as amusing in clay figure depiction as they are in print.  The scene at the end of the segment showing how their love has grown with age is wonderfully touching.

Twain's unique mixture of high brow wisdom with low brow character is beautifully captured in his convincing claymation character by the many sprinkled-in quotes.  Quite frequently he made me laugh.

But he made me think too, particularly in the exceedingly dark and nihilistic ""Mysterious Stranger"" sequence that is very hard to avoid mentioning in any review. I don't want to go into it any further than necessary, but I want to say that when I saw the scene on youtube, I knew I had to check out the whole film.

Personally, I think the content is more PG than G, but sometimes it's tough to make a distinction between the two ratings.  I still have a hard time believing a G-rated movie mentions Hell so directly.  Over the past several months I've been trying to come up with examples of what I call ""G-rated Shock Value"" and ""The Adventures of Mark Twain"" definitely fits.",1262995200,2,1447,4.63921568627451

333657,5,6301505638,"I was only six when I first saw ""The Adventures of Mark Twain"" on video. That was in 1994. Our friends taped it for us, and good thing, because the movie dropped off the face of the earth until recently. I'm thrilled to find it on DVD, because it's remained one of my family's most beloved (and weird) films. It's not a really a kid's film, unless your kids are brainy and literate. What it is is a strange, beautiful, unsettling, funny, and unforgettable work of animation and storytelling that blends fact, fiction and fantasy.

Mark Twain is indeed the central figure, though we see him through the eyes of his three famous child characters: Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn, and Becky Thatcher. In the strange metaworld of the movie, the aging Mr. Twain is taking off in a fantastical airship to meet Halley's Comet, which lit up the skies during his birth and is now returning to see him to his grave (true fact). His ship is right up there with Howl's Moving Castle in terms of whimsy and inventiveness; it is part dirigible and part steamboat, with a multitude of strange features and gadgets and functions that do not abide by the rules of physics. Tom, Huck, and Becky stow away on the ship by accident, and as the foursome chug through the sky toward their fateful meeting with the comet, the movie leaves all boundaries behind.

The main plot is engaging, as the three children attempt to understand this strange old author and his fancies. Tom wants to hijack the ship and make a new story with himself as the hero. And there is a mysterious fifth passenger lurking about -- who could it be? Ah, but in the meantime, the film breaks from the plot to dive (literally) into some of Twain's literary works. We see a clever retelling of the Celebrated Jumping Frog, a disturbing visit with the Mysterious Stranger (concerned parents may want to fast-forward through this bit), and a bizarre and comical interlude with Captain Stormfield and some pushy aliens. The standouts, though, are two extended sequences focusing on Twain's Diary of Adam and Eve. We see the first couple during their time in the garden of Eden and their banishment, surrounded first by wonders and then by the hardships of real life and family. Adam and Eve turn out to be incredibly dysfunctional (he's lazy and stubborn, she's controlling and anal-retentive), but their exploits, while comedic, are ultimately touching and somehow perfectly appropriate. Meanwhile, in the real(?) world, Twain and the children must cope with such threats as a vicious storm, Tom's reckless hijacking scheme, and what happens when they actually reach the comet....

Creator and animator Will Vinton has an amazing and unique style. His clay figures are distinct and expressive and his fantastical visions are delightful. He uses clay as paint, blending color and form to create amazing sights. Bodies and vehicles morph and shapeshift with cheerful abandon, creating an elastic reality that never grows boring. Such thrilling scenes as the lightning storm and the final ""showdown"" with Halley's Comet suck you in, and when you remember how much time and effort goes into claymation, it becomes all the more impressive. Artists as dedicated to their craft as Vinton are rare, and their work should certainly be elevated. He has made a great tribute to Mark Twain and his works, and I really hope that ""The Adventures of Mark Twain"" is destined for a long and successful run on DVD. I plan to tell as many people as possible about it.",1218672000,3,3493,4.818333333333333
333686,4,6301505638,"When I was the ripe old age of ten, I watched this movie at Grandmas house.  I remember frantically pawing through the TV Guide to find what the name was...I had started watching it about five minutes in, and they didn't show the title again.

Nearly twenty years later I found a clip on 'YouTube' that sparked my memory, and hunted it down through Google.  Thank God for technology....

My son and I watched The Adventures of Mark Twain together, and I was surprised by how relevant it was today. My son actually showed interest  in it, even though there's no computer animation.  In my opinion it's a timeless classic, and although it deals with a few adult themes it presents them in a humorous and easily digestable way.  The animation is beautiful, the storyline compelling, and it wraps up nicely.",1199577600,2,803,4.652482269503546
333687,5,6301505638,"To be absolutely honest, this is probably a biased review. I owned a Betamax of this movie when I was a kid, and when I bought it and rewatched it, it blew me away just like it did when I was a kid. I can't believe this is made in 1984, it looks absolutely gorgeous. If anything stops this claymation from being absolutely perfect, its Eve's voice in it. The woman who voiced Eve sounds like she's in a hurry, bored and is maybe sleepy. It kinda sucks because it ruins the otherwise surreal mood of the movie.
I don't want to give the impression that if you didn't see this as a kid you won't enjoy it. The movie is, as I mentioned, very pleasing visually. Its story is strange (especially for a kid), but its well worth watching, especially since it doesn't cost much.

Every background, character and landscape element is clay and I sat amazed, thinking of the intensive work that goes into a feature length piece like this.. well, there simply IS nothing like this in claymation.

If you make caricatures, or need a resource to get your artistic juices flowing in sculpting miniatures, then this is simply IT.

The story is a good one also, but that has been much commented on I'm sure.. so, I keep my comments to defining it as simple excellence in art and design!

 Mark Twain takes an alien approach of looking at Christianity, something that is barely ever done at an adult level. All the scenes seem to be inspired from his books, and he definitely keeps his voice through the entire movie. The biggest problem I can see, is this really what everyone wants there kids watching?

 I say yes. While I do believe they say damn and hell a few times in the movie, past that, the profanity is mild, as it is rated G, and almost always used in an ""appropriate"" way. Whats most important, here, is that it gets children thinking early, and allows them to process there own decisions, and even moreso, will encourage them to read on there own accord, and hopefully have one-liners they repeat that are alot better then the new Disney movies or a commercial they watched recently.",1170288000,8,1021,4.386243386243386

I used to watch this with my boys when they were very young. They did not understand the symbolism or humor then but were attracted by the incredible claymation. It's neat to see them watch it again years later and sudenly the lights go on and there is something deeper to appreciate.

I can't/won't speak to the narrow minds that kept Huckleberry Finn off so many library shelves for such a long time but we all understand that Mark Twain did not necessarily write for an audience of children.  This genius of an American writer gave us things to think about and consider...uncomfortable issues for the time and gauging from some of the more emotional responses/reviews, still difficult for a few today but I challenge that truly GREAT art does that.

If you are a fan of Mark Twain and don't mind entertainment that encourages exploration of the human spirit, our ideals, aspirations, disappointments, patterns of life and the conclusion of that then I HIGHLY recommend this gem. It's definitely a keeper...you know, one of those special works that you keep in the closet even after you can recite the dialog and have given away all the other older movies you've grown tired of. It is wonderfully representative of Twain so if you are not enamored of his work you may not ""get"" this.

I saw some reviews that found the movie choppy but I never thought this was the case. It's a film that requires your full attention but it's so entertaining that you will want to watch again and again. Over time you will pick up on things that you may have missed the first few times around and have one of those OHHHH now I get it moments....This is not Sesame Street...it's contemplative, thoughtful and BEAUTIFULLY done...enjoy...

The premise is that three youngsters--Tom, Huck and Becky from The Adventures of Tom Sawyer--stow away on a fantastic lighter-than-air craft piloted by Mark Twain, who was born during a year when Halley's Comet visited our atmosphere and is trying to join up with it during one of its return visits. As he puts it, the Lord noted that those two freaks of nature came in together, and they should go out together. Along the way, the kids start to question the outcome of the trip and plot to hijack the ship. They also encounter several of Twain's short stories that are dramatized as subplots, a couple of which end up revealing crucial aspects of Twain's own character. The Clamation effects are a knockout, highly imaginative, and the plot has more substance than you might think on first approaching it. You might want to view it with your youngest children, since there are some potentially frightening considerations of mortality.

Thankfully, it was and better than I remember.

The Adam and Eve sequence rings funnier now at 30 than when I was 10. The animation itself is enough to blow you away, but the fact that it is still a very entertaining movie, story-wise, after all these years says a lot about this film.

333750,4,6301505638,"First off, I own a copy of this movie on VHS and there's just no comparison between the two (VHS and DVD).  The colors are vibrant and crisp, and the sound is near perfect!  Not to mention (but I will), the DVD is in wide-screen format, which is a nice feature as well.

As for the film itself, this is ""old-school"" Claymation.  I would say 99% of what is mis-en-scene is actually clay.  It must have taken years to complete this project!  In comparison to stop-animation features, such as the Wallace and Gromit series or Nightmare Before Christmas, the animation is not quite as ""glossy"" or perfect, but that is what gives this film it's charm.

Overall, the film does a fine job at presenting some of Mark Twain's more popular stories.  The primary story-line, however, focuses on Mark Twain's attempt to meet up with Halley's Comet, through the use of a unique flying contraption (basically, it's a blimp). Mark Twain's literary subjects Tom Sawyer, Huck Finn, and Becky Thatcher are introduced to us as stowaways on Twain's vessel, and thus begins the film's introduction of additional, lessor known stories.  One of which, ""The Diaries of Adam and Eve"", is woven throughout most of the film.  It's a great and poignant look at relations between men and women.  My only complaint is the screeching/scratchy sounding voice of the actress who played Eve.  Holy cow!  What were they thinking?!?!  It's really annoying and I found myself wanting to clear my throat every 30 seconds.  Sorry...had to mention that.

For me personally, I really enjoy the scene involving ""The Mysterious Stranger"".  Extremely well done!

Overall, this is a classic film!  However, I fear that most people who watch this film expecting the typical ""happy, fun for all ages"" movie, might be a bit disappointed.  This film unfolds a bit slowly, but is well worth the wait.  You just need to be patient.  And knowing how kids (and adults) are today, if you're not dealing with 3 second MTV edits, forget about it.

Fast forward a year or so, and Im home sick with bronchitis flipping through channels, found it on HBO, and settled in as the codeine cough syrup started to work.

About halfway through the movie, I was very pleasantly stoned when something weird happened. The kids are in the elevator and find the Mysterious Stranger. I was confused - I had never seen this part before. The stranger quickly identifies himself as Satan and it goes downhill from there. He had the kids make clay people and then kills them (clay people, not the kids) in horrible ways - sending an earthquake to suck them down into the earth as they screamed and clawed at the ground.

By that time I was absolutely freaked out and unable to move. Thanks to the codeine, I knew there was only possible reason I was seeing this scene: obviously I was dead and Satan had just announced he was coming for me through the magic of Claymation. I have never been more petrified. My conviction was only strengthened when he announcec, It is true, that which I have revealed to you; there is no God, no universe, no human race, no earthly life, no heaven, no hell. It is all a dreama grotesque and foolish dream. Nothing exists but you. And you are but a thoughta vagrant thought, a useless thought, a homeless thought, wandering forlorn among the empty eternities.

Well long story short, I wasn't dead. It was that Disney had redacted that part because it would be too scary for its target audience.
