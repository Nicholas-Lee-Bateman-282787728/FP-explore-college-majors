8205818,5,B000SM5TQA,"John S. Hurt may have been unassuming in person, but he, along with Rev Gary Davis, taught the folk revival how to fingerpick. John Miller knows Hurt's music inside-out and presents it clearly.  Volume 1 is good but the songs in this lesson (Payday, Avalon, Candyman) make it the winner in my book. But if you want Spike Driver, then you need em both! Essential stuff for fingerstyle guitar.",1387756800,,391,4.666666666666667
8205819,5,B000SM5TQA,"Miller is obviously a gifted guitarist, but more importantly to those of us who purchase these DVDs for instruction, he is also a gifted teacher.

With his easy going personality, he is a very likable figure, as you will spend many hours on these DVDs, revisiting the lessons repeatedly, as you learn some of the most beautiful fingerpicking songs ever composed.

This two volume set, along with Homespun's DVD with Happy Traum and John Sebastian teaching the music of Mississippi John Hurt, will give you a really well rounded MJH education!

You will learn the songs and those that hear you will enjoy them tremendously...even my kids sing, ""My Creole Belle"" and ""Miss Collins"" and other wonderful songs.",1213747200,,706,4.966101694915254
