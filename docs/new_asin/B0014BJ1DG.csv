3128081,2,B0014BJ1DG,"First I have to say I'm a huge Robert Ryan/Western fan (Hour of the Gun, The Lawman), and if you've ever seen Burl Ives in ""Big Country"" you know how good he can play a bad guy. But this movie was an odd diappointment--not terrible, but strange for a Western.

It starts right off with Robert Ryan being a tough guy; then shows him oddly romantic with Tina Louise (yes, from Gilligan's Island who looks gorgeous as a brunnette) and you see why Ryan rarely did love scenes. The whole movie is taking place indoors at this pt and it's claustrophobic and not at all what you want or expect in a Western.

Then Burl Ives (who's quite good) shows up with his thugs and it shifts into a ""hostage take-over plot"" we've seen many times before and it seems like an akward fit into a Western. This part goes on for awhile with some very uncomfortable scenes with the thugs dancing with the 4 women left in town.

 At that point the film moves to it's conclusion with Robert Ryan heroically & cleverly leading the bad guys to their own destruction. He then returns to town with one of the original thugs a changed Man--very odd. And one final thing; this movie is beautifully shot in B&W but the harsh treatment of the horses by the men is hard to watch. This film is now in my Western 'collection' but I don't much recommend it for viewing unless you're a diehard like me.",1213920000,7,1362,4.350393700787402

3128084,5,B0014BJ1DG,"This is a grim, taught film, almost more noir than Western, with surprisingly little gunplay but plenty of wide-open nature.  The town looks like another blizzard would blow it away, and the snow and the cold do much of the work, e.g. Tex and Starret at the end.  The dance sequence is brilliantly violent sexuality barely kept in check, almost a rape sequence.  The acting is uniformly excellent, with Ryan and Ives leading, but the henchmen and the townspeople are perfectly presented.  Excellent pacing, real tension.

THE DAY OF THE OUTLAW, in stark black and white, is one of his finest, and perhaps the finest directed by the underrated Andre De Toth. Burl Ives makes a superb ""baddie,"" almost along the lines of Donald Pleasants. Set in the snowy high altitudes, the film exudes a superbly shaped ""coldness"" that is also reflected in the lean dialogue.

3128097,4,B0014BJ1DG,"Day of the Outlaw, 1959 film

A very small town in the Old West is taken over by a gang of renegade soldiers who turned outlaw. The former conflicted residents must now cooperate to survive. The leader of the gang is wounded, a veterinarian must remove the bullet even though he has never done this before. There is a harsh penalty for failure! The first order is to confiscate all the guns. [Gun Control is the beginning of totalitarian control.] No one is allowed to leave - or else! This gang was fleeing from the legal authorities. The few women are in danger of being used by the outlaws. Mr. Blaze must fight Tex as punishment for disobeying orders. Will the good guy win? A young boy is taken as a hostage. The leader, Captain Brun, recovers from his wound and explains his ban on liquor and women - to keep his gang unified. The outlaws celebrate this Saturday night. Brun also dances with a lady, so does another of his gang.

The veterinarian presents his diagnosis of Brun - he won't live much longer. Blaze tells Brun of a trail away from the town (Army soldiers are on their trail, they enforce the law in this territory). Blaze will lead the way. The leader must decide what to do. Blaze plans to take the bad men out of a good town. The gang must either go forward or wait for the superior forces of the Army to catch up and capture them. On the way out of town the snow drifts become deeper. When one horse falls the rider acquires a replacement. They ride on, snow falls. Brun falls off his horse! So too another man. [That means fewer men to share their loot.] Another member of the gang falls, and they ride on. They halt for the night. Can they light a fire? The morning light appears, Blaze dug into the snow for the night and escaped the cold wind. One outlaw does not awake. Another keels over. Only Blaze returns to town, the threat ended.

Will the past conflicts in this small town return? Or will they learn that cooperation is better than conflict? Did the snow represent the Cold War? What is your opinion of this story? This is worth watching, but is slower paced than some other Western movies.

Robert Ryans obituary told about his association with actors accused of being reds. Ryan had been a boxer in the Marines like Senator Joseph McCarthy. He passed on word through mutual acquaintances that if he was ever summoned to testify before McCarthys committee he would challenge his to settle it in a boxing ring, man to man. If he refused he would call him a yellow coward; if he accepted there wouldnt be spot on his body that wasn't bruised or bloody. Ryan was never called to testify. But Hollywood gave his roles as bad guys or villains. Watch Ryan in the movie Executive Action, one that is rarely shown on television or available in a Public Library.",1418860800,,2789,4.44140625
3128098,2,B0014BJ1DG,"I had high hopes for this film but was ultimately disappointed with the stilted writing and highly contrived storyline.  Tina Louise's character is a farmer's wife who must spend at least 2 hours a day on her hair.  Her character tells Robert Ryan's to buzz off in one scene but then offers herself to him barely 7 minutes later.  The highlights on the DVD case are also highly inaccurate.  Robert Ryan's character does NOT try to lead any homesteaders out of harm's way and the ""unforgettable climax"" of the film is a rather lengthy battle of attrition.",1388275200,,554,4.680412371134021

3128101,5,B0014BJ1DG,"The problem with Westerns is that they glorify the ""gun"", marginalize women, oversimply characters, and reinforce racial bias.
This film does none of these things.

I could easily argue it is the best Western ever made...and certainly the best in black and white.  I could not take my eyes off the screen.  As some have noted, the cinematography is outstanding  - the scenes of grey trees against white snow covered hills might have been taken by a Zen photographer - they are that good!  And the scenes in the interiors have that ""anxious claustrophobia"" that we usually identify with film noir.  (Andre De Toth was known for his skill in making noir film).

But the best parts of the movie, along with the cinematography, are the performances by the character actors.  Neither Robert Ryan as ""the hero"", nor Burl Ives as ""the villain"" quite fit their labels.  They choose to act - either well or badly - depending on the moment or the crisis at hand.  When Burl Ives (as the leader of a gang of sociopath bank robbers) arrives in town, he protects the women and children...but only up to a point.  Mortally wounded by a bullet, he has to decide the fate of the small town, not anyone else.  Indeed Robert Ryan starts out as a villain himself, and then decides he did not like what he saw in his personality and decides to change.

When the bank robbers insist on dancing with the women and get very aggressive with them, the visual experience of observing such naked violence against women is more distressing than most rape scenes in cinema.

In every sense, this is a tense, fascinating, psychological thriller that just happens to be set in a Western landscape.  I was overwhelmed by how good the picture was...5 stars is not enough.",1368835200,,1738,4.6524590163934425
3128102,5,B0014BJ1DG,"Fantastic, unjustly obscure western, with great characters, wonderfully bleak atmosphere (thanks to the snowy exteriors shots), and some mesmirizing performances from Robert Ryan and Burl Ives.

3128103,5,B0014BJ1DG,"THE DAY OF THE OUTLAW is strange filmmaking indeed. This Western film noir, directed by Andre De Toth, is curious stuff. THE DAY OF THE OUTLAW seems like a cross between directors' Sam Fuller and William ""Wild Bill"" Wellman ventures into the Western film genre. Robert Ryan is pitted against the evil Burl Ives in this cold and stark black and white production. That vision of starkness is the greater substance and very effective essence of this outstanding film. An interesting score from Alexander Courage and Russell Harlan's cinematography are very effective here.",1336780800,,569,5.129032258064516
3128104,5,B0014BJ1DG,"A review of the movie ""Day of the Outlaw."" This is my third review of westerns, searching for nuggets on the true history of the west. The director, Andre de Toth, states: this is ""a view of pioneer life that isn't as idealized as other films of the day."" de Toth ""gives us a truly bleak Wyoming winter."" It starts out that way and goes down hill rapidly, in a tiny bleak town of Bitters, WY, with a population of only 20 people, including four women. It illustrates how difficult life could be as the country slowly recovered from the civil war, and as the population slowly moved west.
 This town is not too small to be absence of any strife. For this area the strife is the classical battle on whether there should be any barbed wire on the range. The key character is Blaise Starrett (by Robert Ryan). He is defined initially as ""a ruthless cattleman at odds with homesteaders."" However, he is no way a ""cattle baron"" or as ruthless and evil a rancher as seen in ""Open Range."" In Bitters, the strife is defined as ""trouble between local farmers and the lone cattle rancher over barbed wire fences."" Starrett is depicted as ""a hard edged rancher who bitterly resents the farmers whose barbed wire fences hamper his cattle drives."" He is also bitter as he came to Bitters as a roughneck, about 20 years ago, and who fought to clean up the territory for settlers, only to be ""ostracized for his troubles.""
 As in my other reviews this town comes under total domination by an evil, and mostly ugly, gang of renegades who are on the run after robbing a bank, and drift into Bitters. This gang is ""led by a former Cavalry officer named Jack Bruhn (a commanding performance by Burl Ives)."" His gang consists of some nasty, dirty and repellent individuals, that ""only Bruhn's iron hand keeps them from laying waste to the town, especially its women."" However Bruhn is wounded and slowly dying. Starrett senses that the only way to save this town, and particularly the women, is to get this gang out of town (and he just might redeem his reputation, if he can survive the elements and finesse the renegades.). He convinces Bruhn there is a way through the mountains to the west and he can find it. In contrast, if Bruhn dies in Bitters, there will be a terrible massacre, that will be Bruhn's legacy. Starrett wins Bruhn over to his plan, and he and the gang head into the mountains and a winter storm.
This movie relies far less on gunplay than most westerns. Indeed the final showdown, in Open Range, saw what might have been the biggest gunfight ever. Rather, in this movie, it is a battle ""between man and the elements.""",1299715200,,2619,4.523206751054852

3128106,4,B0014BJ1DG,"This is a cattleman-against-farmer western with two twists. The cattle owner sacrificed his life over an extended period to clear the land of outlaws. He feels that because of what he did all the land is his. He does not want the new-comer farmers to fence in their land, which will stop his cattle from grazing. He is determined to kill the lead farmer who says he will defend himself, even though he stands no chance of winning against the cattleman. But the first twist is that the cattleman is in love with the farmer's wife, and she with him.

The two stand to shoot it out in a bar, with the farmer having two other farmers standing with him against the cattleman who stands alone. The shootout is interrupted when a bandit with six band members enters the bar, stops the fight, and takes over the small town of twenty people with its four women. This is the second twist. The bandit leader is wounded with a bullet in his chest. He is an ex-military captain who has been able to control his men. He tells them to leave the women alone and drink no whiskey, but they want to drink whiskey and rape the women. What will happen next? Will the town find a way to save itself from the seven outlaws? How? Will the cattleman get the woman he loves? Will there be a shootout? Isn't the cattleman acting like the bandits?",1291766400,,1320,4.387755102040816
3128107,5,B0014BJ1DG,"The films of Andre De Toth are slowly being paid due recognition in the DVD market. As prolific and versatile as De Toth was there is, of course, hits and misses. While some of De Toth's weaker films, such as ""The Stranger Wore a Gun"" (1953) and ""The Indian Fighter"" (1955), are readily available, other, far more notable works such as ""Ramrod"" (1947) and ""The Bounty Hunter"" (1954) still languish in obscurity. De Toth is best known for being the one-eyed director of the 3D ""House of Wax"" (1953), the noir classic ""Crime Wave"" (1954), and as one of the great western revisionists of the 1950s (he wrote the story for 'The Gunfighter' 1950).

Snow extraordinarily sets the bleak tone, even more than it did in De Toth's ""Springfield Rifle"" (1952). An older hero is at the center of many De Toth films, as in ""Day of the Outlaw."" Blaise (noir fan favorite Robert Ryan) and Dan (Nehemiah Persoff) are traveling to the aptly named town of Bitters. They are frostbit and struggling to move through the thick snow drifts. Blaise whips his horse with determined intensity. The horse stumbles lethargically. Blaise, a rancher and gunfighter, is furious over the barb wire fence that has been put up by framer Hal Crane (Alan Marshal) and vows to kill Crane. A very tired Dan tells Blaise (in horse voice), ""A wire fence is a poor excuse to kill a man."" Blaise' motive runs deeper still. That motive is Crane's wife Helen (Tina Louise), whom Blaise had an affair with.

The Scene shifts from the seemingly endless snowy abyss to a claustrophobic saloon where, it seems, confrontation looms. First, Helen confronts Blaise. She tells him the affair is over and warns him not to harm her husband. Blaise promises nothing. Blaise then confronts Hal, provoking an inevitable showdown. Blaise represents the seasoned renegade spirit (a frequent De Toth theme) at odds with the arrival of civilization in the form of younger, weaker men (Hal and the farmers).

Despite Helen's pleas, Blaise fully intends to kill Hal . She reprimands Blaise for his lack of mercy. ""You won't find mercy anywhere in Wyoming"" he retorts. Bitter indeed. It is the sound of a bottle hitting the wood floor that will leave Helen a widow and rid Blaise of an annoying farmer, but the bottle is suddenly interrupted by true threat in the form of outlaw Jack Bruhn (Burl Ives) and his gang. At this point, De Toth's narrative takes a dramatic and refreshingly unexpected shift.

Bruhn, like Blaise, is a dying breed and is literally dying from a gunshot wound received in a recent bank robbery. Stark tension permeates ""Day of the Outlaw"" as Bruhn faces certain death under a paramount struggle to maintain control of his gang and the situation. The feeling of claustrophobia is a prism to both Bruhn and Blaise. They engage in a battle of wills while finding an uncomfortable, identifying ground. Both men discover their own fallibility in the process and willingly take a contrarian, fatalistic course of action, which then shifts the narrative to its bleak and cynical finale.

The final quarter of the film is replete with desolate symbology. Insatiable greed is juxtaposed against Russel Harden's sumptuous camera work of the merciless, ominous landscape. Underneath the shifting terrain lies a steely, determined goal of self-obliteration.

""Day of the Outlaw"" vividly stays with you long after the credits have faded, imprinting an indelible image of coarse whites. It may indeed be De Toth's finest work, and that is saying quite a bit.

3128108,2,B0014BJ1DG,"I recently saw this film on a dvd issued from France with supplements of interviews with
famed French director Bertrand Tavernier and the director himself.  The former heaped
praises on the film and its director in a typical French indulgent way.

The film was basically divided into 3 parts.
The first part was played out like a stage play, taking place inside a bar cum hotel, setting
up the conflicts between the Robert Ryan character and the other farmers.
That first part was not particularly well written or played.
The 2nd part started with the arrival of the renegade Burl Ives character and his henchmen who
were basically cardboard western baddie characters.
The final part involved impressive wintery outdoor photography while Robert Ryan led the renegade
group up the snowy mountain to their cliche endings.
This is a low-budget B-western with several obvious continuity and editing problems.  Some of supporting actors
gave stiff or below standard performances, e.g. the young girl who fell for David Nelson character.
Somehow the director lingered on her close-up shot even though it should belong to cutting room
floor.
This question may be a bit too late but someone should have asked Andre de Toth if all the sufferings
of human and animal was worth for this slight film.",1283990400,2,1288,5.009345794392523

3128110,5,B0014BJ1DG,"Bitters, Wyoming provides the setting for this brutally visualized creation...comes with a daunting, moody, and merciless soundtrack.  Performances by Robert Ryan, Burl Ives, Tina Louise and company are pinned to multiple conflictual pairings.  From one scene to the next, the physical distance between the characters and their psychological dimensions maneuver amongst individuals and groups.  Farmers and Ranchers make up distinct classes at odds with each others stake in the use of available land, the laws handled by them to provide for individual needs for it, as well as, the types of roles that each chooses to play when another, more sinister, company bursts into the picture and reconfigures the parameters of the conflicts that are immediately established from the beginning credits.  Multiple viewings are suggested here for the sake of style.  This western is layered with complexities and surprises for which there are scarcely any models that lend it justice paying careful attention to the moment balanced with a nicely spaced out direction of time and space.  Hint: listening is as much of the experience as seeing.  Watch it more than once, it's really great theater.  You can't count the ways it physically and emotionally tickles the nerves in true fashion.

3128111,4,B0014BJ1DG,"Surprisingly well-crafted, brooding and atmospheric Western. And different, too, with talk instead of gunfights, a middle-of-nowhere outpost with a population of 20 instead of a big cattle town, running instead of chasing, snow-ridden wilderness instead of resplendent prairies, and no drinking! Veteran actor Robert Ryan, perpetually beleaguered face and all, stars as a rancher [Blaise Starret] having a tiff with locals over land. Their confrontation is interrupted by the arrival of a gang of thieving and truculent renegades who are being chased by the US cavalry. They carry stolen cash that they plan to divvy up once they are clear. They are tired, thirsty and bored. They are led by Burl Ives [Oscar winner the year before for a GREAT performance in THE BIG COUNTRY, 1958] as Jack Bruhn, a corpulent geezer carrying a bullet that, unbeknownst to him, is slowly killing him. Bruhn's introduction of each member of his gang to the hostages conveys a cautious respect and an awareness of the potential for dissolution should things get out of hand.  The imperious and teak-tough Bruhn, realizing there are 4 women and a boy there, and knowing his boys more than anybody, allows his clan food and rest but no dames or drink. Wants his chances of staying ahead of the calvary and escape maximized and the possibility of hazardous delays and inefficiency not an issue. Knows his boys are ravenous---and not just for food. Nice tension development as we repeatedly see them contest their injured boss' restrictions and we sense that Bruhn's hold on his boys is becoming more tenuous with time. After the town Doc tells Starrett that Bruhn is slowly dying he realizes that once Bruhn is dead his degenerates will have their way with their women and pillage then destroy the 'town'. Thus, Starrett offers to escort Bruhn and his gang to safe environs through a hidden snow-covered trail that even the cavalry doesn't know about. The savvy Bruhn feels this is a ruse and confronts Starrett who admits the ploy and elucidates his concerns. Bruhn, always seeming to have a veiled sympathy for the women and boy, goes along with the subterfuge. Starrett leads them on their endless trek through the austere, snow-racked wilderness---I have never seen horses struggle in the snow as in this film. When Bruhn's closest aide, a young man who is not all bad, loses his horse the boss orders him to walk knowing this may be his only chance of survival once he expires. Bruhn eventually succumbs to his wound. Two members of the gang are subsequently murdered by their comrades so that there would be a greater share of the cash to be divided. They trudge on and on, horses having to be put to sleep, until eventually they get to the end of nowhere and the last two scoundrels freeze to death, Starrett the only survivor. Kudos to director Andre De Toth for such a singular film done with noteworthy skill. His use of long-distance filming with concomitant hard-to-hear conversations allowing the stark, bleak black & white environs do the talking was marvelous. And how about the masterful and mesmerizing so-called 'Saturday night dance' scene. Here Bruhn relents and allows his animals one night with the women for dancing---still no drink or hanky panky. The dance is harsh, disturbing and sexually frenetic with Tina Louise's [Ginger from Gilligan's Island] hair unfolding and splaying while being circled---her stilted, stiffened posture symbolic of both the women's repulsion and their partner's repressed carnal state---a vicarious rape of the women. Hurried conclusion minor beef. As for actor Robert Ryan [can't forget his UNFORGETTABLE diatribe against the King's wife as John The Baptist in KING OF KINGS, 1960]---we gotta get that face up on Mount Rushmore!",1258243200,,3760,5.0256410256410255
3128112,5,B0014BJ1DG,"Although this is a Western, filmed in B&W and set in a wintry ramshackle ""town"" in uncharted Wyoming, it could be anywhere.

In fact at times I thought I was watching a particularly brilliant Star Trek or Twilight Zone episode.

It's clear that the people behind the recent Vampire flick ""30 Days of Night"" were inspired by Day of the Outlaw too, as there are recurrent images and themes regarding the vampire siege of the town that are lifted from this stark, unflinching drama.

Burl Ives proves once again how great a character actor he was, mixing mano a mano not just with Robert Ryan as the flawed hero but also his men - a gangly group of unbridled id every bit as scary as the bloodthirsty vampires in 30 Days of Night.

Unjustly overlooked and very satisfying.",1256688000,,769,4.550724637681159
3128113,4,B0014BJ1DG,"Andre De Toth's ""Day of the Outlaw(1959)"" is one of the grimmest and most tense Westerns of the 1950s. The genre had really come of age that decade with a much stronger emphasis on adult themes and the lines between hero and villain starting to become blurred for all time. This film may include a B-movie title but does not properly convey what is a suspense classic with a high level of intelligence.

The film tells the story of a rancher(Robert Ryan) who is one conflicted dude. He is being forced out of town by the very people he had protected, getting his land stomped upon and is bitter that one of the town's lead ranchers has married the love of his life(Tina Louise). He is about to duel the husband and two other men when a gang of outlaws arrive in town led by Burl Ives. He is a former cavalery Captain who now leads a group of bank robbers who are making off with a load of stolen gold with Cavalery on there trail. Ive's men are homicidal maniacs and lay siege to the small town. They listen to Ives but he is dying from a gunshot wound and it's only a matter of time before the outlaws tear the town apart.

The film is highly tense with wonderful Black and White cinematography that combine a sense of naturalistic beauty with the snow and wilderness and a high sense of dread. The segment where all the girls in the town are forced to dance with the outlaws is one of the more tense and disturbing filmed in a Western. Beautiful Tina Louise particularly stands out as the camera stays on her being flung from man to man her tied up hair loosening with each swing until it hangs free and she becomes increasingly disheaveled and sexy as her classy refined demeanor is stripped away in real time as she dances about the room. It's incredibly well done.

The conclusion is a surprise and shocking, certainly one of the most unique ever seen in a Western and adding truth to an inevitable that Robert Ryan's character knows to be the entire time as the outlaws meet there fate in the snowy wilderness.

The performances are all sharp led by Robert Ryan, a great underused actor, who delivers a world weariness more effectively than about any other actor this side of Robert Mitchum. He isn't just mean and tough but human and flawed. His level of intelligence and strength and the demons that drive him make him a interesting and complex Western hero.

Burl Ives equals him as the outlaw's leader bringing a gruffness and toughness that fits well but also a sense of dignity and righteousness as a soldier who hides a bitter secret. Ives is able to evoke sympathy for his Captain turned bandit and it's probally the anchor to the picture.

Tina Louise is gorgeous in Black and White and it's difficult to remember that she'll be most famous on the silly sitcom, ""Gilligan's Island"" and proves that she was an adept Dramatic actress as well as being gorgeous.

3128114,4,B0014BJ1DG,"In the 1950s, westerns took a turn to the more intellectual with less reliance on mindless action, Day of the Outlaw is one of those psychological westerns.  Rancher Blaise Starrett (what a cool western name) owns a spread in the mountains of Wyoming, but he's having trouble with the local farmers who want to fence off the area.  But just when the confrontation is coming to a full boil, a gang of vicious renegades on the run ride into town to rest up after being chased by the cavalry for robbing an Army payroll.  Now Blaise and the townfolk must band together if they hope to survive against these ruthless killers.  Being a psychological western, there isn't a ton of action here, but when it comes it's surprising and meant to catch you off guard.  Not many westerns filmed in winter settings, but the snowy locations add to the dark, cynical feel of the movie and the use of black and white really adds to the effect.  Take advantage of this new DVD, the movie's well worth a watch.

  The always reliable Robert Ryan leads a strong cast as Blaise Starrett, the Wyoming rancher who's always been interested in his own problems but now finds himself having to look out for the well-being of others.  Starrett makes a noble transformation by the end of the movie, something you actually believe in because it's Robert Ryan.  Singer Burl Ives gives a startling performance as Captain Jack Bruhn, a cavalry officer with a checkered past now leading a band of ruthless renegades.  Bruhn is not like his men and single-handedly keeps them behaved.  A pre-Gilligan's Island Tina Louise shows what a good actress she is as Helen Crane, a farmer's wife who has feelings for Starrett but neither of them know what to do if they want to be together.  Jack Lambert and Lance Fuller are very good as Tex and Pace, two of Bruhn's gang and maybe the most dangerous of them all.  Other recognizable western faces here include Nehemiah Persoff, Elisha Cook, Dabbs Greer, Alan Marshal, and David Nelson.

  The DVD has a widescreen presentation of the movie in its original black and white format.  The Andre De Toth directed movie looks great with all the snowy locations, but unfortunately there's no special features here.  The movie's a good one though, especially Robert Ryan and Burl Ives, so give Day of the Outlaw a try!",1224979200,2,2319,4.679012345679013

3362578,2,B0014BJ1DG,"First I have to say I'm a huge Robert Ryan/Western fan (Hour of the Gun, The Lawman), and if you've ever seen Burl Ives in ""Big Country"" you know how good he can play a bad guy. But this movie was an odd diappointment--not terrible, but strange for a Western.

It starts right off with Robert Ryan being a tough guy; then shows him oddly romantic with Tina Louise (yes, from Gilligan's Island who looks gorgeous as a brunnette) and you see why Ryan rarely did love scenes. The whole movie is taking place indoors at this pt and it's claustrophobic and not at all what you want or expect in a Western.

Then Burl Ives (who's quite good) shows up with his thugs and it shifts into a ""hostage take-over plot"" we've seen many times before and it seems like an akward fit into a Western. This part goes on for awhile with some very uncomfortable scenes with the thugs dancing with the 4 women left in town.

 At that point the film moves to it's conclusion with Robert Ryan heroically & cleverly leading the bad guys to their own destruction. He then returns to town with one of the original thugs a changed Man--very odd. And one final thing; this movie is beautifully shot in B&W but the harsh treatment of the horses by the men is hard to watch. This film is now in my Western 'collection' but I don't much recommend it for viewing unless you're a diehard like me.",1213920000,7,1362,4.350393700787402

3362594,4,B0014BJ1DG,"Day of the Outlaw, 1959 film

A very small town in the Old West is taken over by a gang of renegade soldiers who turned outlaw. The former conflicted residents must now cooperate to survive. The leader of the gang is wounded, a veterinarian must remove the bullet even though he has never done this before. There is a harsh penalty for failure! The first order is to confiscate all the guns. [Gun Control is the beginning of totalitarian control.] No one is allowed to leave - or else! This gang was fleeing from the legal authorities. The few women are in danger of being used by the outlaws. Mr. Blaze must fight Tex as punishment for disobeying orders. Will the good guy win? A young boy is taken as a hostage. The leader, Captain Brun, recovers from his wound and explains his ban on liquor and women - to keep his gang unified. The outlaws celebrate this Saturday night. Brun also dances with a lady, so does another of his gang.

The veterinarian presents his diagnosis of Brun - he won't live much longer. Blaze tells Brun of a trail away from the town (Army soldiers are on their trail, they enforce the law in this territory). Blaze will lead the way. The leader must decide what to do. Blaze plans to take the bad men out of a good town. The gang must either go forward or wait for the superior forces of the Army to catch up and capture them. On the way out of town the snow drifts become deeper. When one horse falls the rider acquires a replacement. They ride on, snow falls. Brun falls off his horse! So too another man. [That means fewer men to share their loot.] Another member of the gang falls, and they ride on. They halt for the night. Can they light a fire? The morning light appears, Blaze dug into the snow for the night and escaped the cold wind. One outlaw does not awake. Another keels over. Only Blaze returns to town, the threat ended.

Will the past conflicts in this small town return? Or will they learn that cooperation is better than conflict? Did the snow represent the Cold War? What is your opinion of this story? This is worth watching, but is slower paced than some other Western movies.

Robert Ryans obituary told about his association with actors accused of being reds. Ryan had been a boxer in the Marines like Senator Joseph McCarthy. He passed on word through mutual acquaintances that if he was ever summoned to testify before McCarthys committee he would challenge his to settle it in a boxing ring, man to man. If he refused he would call him a yellow coward; if he accepted there wouldnt be spot on his body that wasn't bruised or bloody. Ryan was never called to testify. But Hollywood gave his roles as bad guys or villains. Watch Ryan in the movie Executive Action, one that is rarely shown on television or available in a Public Library.",1418860800,,2789,4.44140625

Her character tells Robert Ryan's to buzz off in one scene but then offers herself to him barely 7 minutes later.  The highlights on the DVD case are also highly inaccurate.  Robert Ryan's character does NOT try to lead any homesteaders out of harm's way and the ""unforgettable climax"" of the film is a rather lengthy battle of attrition.",1388275200,,554,4.680412371134021

3362598,5,B0014BJ1DG,"The problem with Westerns is that they glorify the ""gun"", marginalize women, oversimply characters, and reinforce racial bias.
This film does none of these things.

I could easily argue it is the best Western ever made...and certainly the best in black and white.  I could not take my eyes off the screen.  As some have noted, the cinematography is outstanding  - the scenes of grey trees against white snow covered hills might have been taken by a Zen photographer - they are that good!  And the scenes in the interiors have that ""anxious claustrophobia"" that we usually identify with film noir.  (Andre De Toth was known for his skill in making noir film).

But the best parts of the movie, along with the cinematography, are the performances by the character actors.  Neither Robert Ryan as ""the hero"", nor Burl Ives as ""the villain"" quite fit their labels.  They choose to act - either well or badly - depending on the moment or the crisis at hand.  When Burl Ives (as the leader of a gang of sociopath bank robbers) arrives in town, he protects the women and children...but only up to a point.  Mortally wounded by a bullet, he has to decide the fate of the small town, not anyone else.  Indeed Robert Ryan starts out as a villain himself, and then decides he did not like what he saw in his personality and decides to change.

When the bank robbers insist on dancing with the women and get very aggressive with them, the visual experience of observing such naked violence against women is more distressing than most rape scenes in cinema.

In every sense, this is a tense, fascinating, psychological thriller that just happens to be set in a Western landscape.  I was overwhelmed by how good the picture was...5 stars is not enough.",1368835200,,1738,4.6524590163934425

3362601,5,B0014BJ1DG,"A review of the movie ""Day of the Outlaw."" This is my third review of westerns, searching for nuggets on the true history of the west. The director, Andre de Toth, states: this is ""a view of pioneer life that isn't as idealized as other films of the day."" de Toth ""gives us a truly bleak Wyoming winter."" It starts out that way and goes down hill rapidly, in a tiny bleak town of Bitters, WY, with a population of only 20 people, including four women. It illustrates how difficult life could be as the country slowly recovered from the civil war, and as the population slowly moved west.
 This town is not too small to be absence of any strife. For this area the strife is the classical battle on whether there should be any barbed wire on the range. The key character is Blaise Starrett (by Robert Ryan). He is defined initially as ""a ruthless cattleman at odds with homesteaders."" However, he is no way a ""cattle baron"" or as ruthless and evil a rancher as seen in ""Open Range."" In Bitters, the strife is defined as ""trouble between local farmers and the lone cattle rancher over barbed wire fences."" Starrett is depicted as ""a hard edged rancher who bitterly resents the farmers whose barbed wire fences hamper his cattle drives."" He is also bitter as he came to Bitters as a roughneck, about 20 years ago, and who fought to clean up the territory for settlers, only to be ""ostracized for his troubles.""
 As in my other reviews this town comes under total domination by an evil, and mostly ugly, gang of renegades who are on the run after robbing a bank, and drift into Bitters. This gang is ""led by a former Cavalry officer named Jack Bruhn (a commanding performance by Burl Ives)."" His gang consists of some nasty, dirty and repellent individuals, that ""only Bruhn's iron hand keeps them from laying waste to the town, especially its women."" However Bruhn is wounded and slowly dying. Starrett senses that the only way to save this town, and particularly the women, is to get this gang out of town (and he just might redeem his reputation, if he can survive the elements and finesse the renegades.). He convinces Bruhn there is a way through the mountains to the west and he can find it. In contrast, if Bruhn dies in Bitters, there will be a terrible massacre, that will be Bruhn's legacy. Starrett wins Bruhn over to his plan, and he and the gang head into the mountains and a winter storm.
This movie relies far less on gunplay than most westerns. Indeed the final showdown, in Open Range, saw what might have been the biggest gunfight ever. Rather, in this movie, it is a battle ""between man and the elements.""",1299715200,,2619,4.523206751054852

3362603,4,B0014BJ1DG,"This is a cattleman-against-farmer western with two twists. The cattle owner sacrificed his life over an extended period to clear the land of outlaws. He feels that because of what he did all the land is his. He does not want the new-comer farmers to fence in their land, which will stop his cattle from grazing. He is determined to kill the lead farmer who says he will defend himself, even though he stands no chance of winning against the cattleman. But the first twist is that the cattleman is in love with the farmer's wife, and she with him.

The two stand to shoot it out in a bar, with the farmer having two other farmers standing with him against the cattleman who stands alone. The shootout is interrupted when a bandit with six band members enters the bar, stops the fight, and takes over the small town of twenty people with its four women. This is the second twist. The bandit leader is wounded with a bullet in his chest. He is an ex-military captain who has been able to control his men. He tells them to leave the women alone and drink no whiskey, but they want to drink whiskey and rape the women. What will happen next? Will the town find a way to save itself from the seven outlaws? How? Will the cattleman get the woman he loves? Will there be a shootout? Isn't the cattleman acting like the bandits?",1291766400,,1320,4.387755102040816
3362604,5,B0014BJ1DG,"The films of Andre De Toth are slowly being paid due recognition in the DVD market. As prolific and versatile as De Toth was there is, of course, hits and misses. While some of De Toth's weaker films, such as ""The Stranger Wore a Gun"" (1953) and ""The Indian Fighter"" (1955), are readily available, other, far more notable works such as ""Ramrod"" (1947) and ""The Bounty Hunter"" (1954) still languish in obscurity. De Toth is best known for being the one-eyed director of the 3D ""House of Wax"" (1953), the noir classic ""Crime Wave"" (1954), and as one of the great western revisionists of the 1950s (he wrote the story for 'The Gunfighter' 1950).

Snow extraordinarily sets the bleak tone, even more than it did in De Toth's ""Springfield Rifle"" (1952). An older hero is at the center of many De Toth films, as in ""Day of the Outlaw."" Blaise (noir fan favorite Robert Ryan) and Dan (Nehemiah Persoff) are traveling to the aptly named town of Bitters. They are frostbit and struggling to move through the thick snow drifts. Blaise whips his horse with determined intensity. The horse stumbles lethargically. Blaise, a rancher and gunfighter, is furious over the barb wire fence that has been put up by framer Hal Crane (Alan Marshal) and vows to kill Crane. A very tired Dan tells Blaise (in horse voice), ""A wire fence is a poor excuse to kill a man."" Blaise' motive runs deeper still. That motive is Crane's wife Helen (Tina Louise), whom Blaise had an affair with.

The Scene shifts from the seemingly endless snowy abyss to a claustrophobic saloon where, it seems, confrontation looms. First, Helen confronts Blaise. She tells him the affair is over and warns him not to harm her husband. Blaise promises nothing. Blaise then confronts Hal, provoking an inevitable showdown. Blaise represents the seasoned renegade spirit (a frequent De Toth theme) at odds with the arrival of civilization in the form of younger, weaker men (Hal and the farmers).

Despite Helen's pleas, Blaise fully intends to kill Hal . She reprimands Blaise for his lack of mercy. ""You won't find mercy anywhere in Wyoming"" he retorts. Bitter indeed. It is the sound of a bottle hitting the wood floor that will leave Helen a widow and rid Blaise of an annoying farmer, but the bottle is suddenly interrupted by true threat in the form of outlaw Jack Bruhn (Burl Ives) and his gang. At this point, De Toth's narrative takes a dramatic and refreshingly unexpected shift.

Bruhn, like Blaise, is a dying breed and is literally dying from a gunshot wound received in a recent bank robbery. Stark tension permeates ""Day of the Outlaw"" as Bruhn faces certain death under a paramount struggle to maintain control of his gang and the situation. The feeling of claustrophobia is a prism to both Bruhn and Blaise. They engage in a battle of wills while finding an uncomfortable, identifying ground. Both men discover their own fallibility in the process and willingly take a contrarian, fatalistic course of action, which then shifts the narrative to its bleak and cynical finale.

The final quarter of the film is replete with desolate symbology. Insatiable greed is juxtaposed against Russel Harden's sumptuous camera work of the merciless, ominous landscape. Underneath the shifting terrain lies a steely, determined goal of self-obliteration.

""Day of the Outlaw"" vividly stays with you long after the credits have faded, imprinting an indelible image of coarse whites. It may indeed be De Toth's finest work, and that is saying quite a bit.

3362605,2,B0014BJ1DG,"I recently saw this film on a dvd issued from France with supplements of interviews with
famed French director Bertrand Tavernier and the director himself.  The former heaped
praises on the film and its director in a typical French indulgent way.

The film was basically divided into 3 parts.
The first part was played out like a stage play, taking place inside a bar cum hotel, setting
up the conflicts between the Robert Ryan character and the other farmers.
That first part was not particularly well written or played.
The 2nd part started with the arrival of the renegade Burl Ives character and his henchmen who
were basically cardboard western baddie characters.
The final part involved impressive wintery outdoor photography while Robert Ryan led the renegade
group up the snowy mountain to their cliche endings.
This is a low-budget B-western with several obvious continuity and editing problems.  Some of supporting actors
gave stiff or below standard performances, e.g. the young girl who fell for David Nelson character.
Somehow the director lingered on her close-up shot even though it should belong to cutting room
floor.

of human and animal was worth for this slight film.",1283990400,2,1288,5.009345794392523

Farmers and Ranchers make up distinct classes at odds with each others stake in the use of available land, the laws handled by them to provide for individual needs for it, as well as, the types of roles that each chooses to play when another, more sinister, company bursts into the picture and reconfigures the parameters of the conflicts that are immediately established from the beginning credits.  Multiple viewings are suggested here for the sake of style.  This western is layered with complexities and surprises for which there are scarcely any models that lend it justice paying careful attention to the moment balanced with a nicely spaced out direction of time and space.

3362608,4,B0014BJ1DG,"Surprisingly well-crafted, brooding and atmospheric Western. And different, too, with talk instead of gunfights, a middle-of-nowhere outpost with a population of 20 instead of a big cattle town, running instead of chasing, snow-ridden wilderness instead of resplendent prairies, and no drinking! Veteran actor Robert Ryan, perpetually beleaguered face and all, stars as a rancher [Blaise Starret] having a tiff with locals over land. Their confrontation is interrupted by the arrival of a gang of thieving and truculent renegades who are being chased by the US cavalry. They carry stolen cash that they plan to divvy up once they are clear. They are tired, thirsty and bored. They are led by Burl Ives [Oscar winner the year before for a GREAT performance in THE BIG COUNTRY, 1958] as Jack Bruhn, a corpulent geezer carrying a bullet that, unbeknownst to him, is slowly killing him. Bruhn's introduction of each member of his gang to the hostages conveys a cautious respect and an awareness of the potential for dissolution should things get out of hand.  The imperious and teak-tough Bruhn, realizing there are 4 women and a boy there, and knowing his boys more than anybody, allows his clan food and rest but no dames or drink. Wants his chances of staying ahead of the calvary and escape maximized and the possibility of hazardous delays and inefficiency not an issue. Knows his boys are ravenous---and not just for food. Nice tension development as we repeatedly see them contest their injured boss' restrictions and we sense that Bruhn's hold on his boys is becoming more tenuous with time. After the town Doc tells Starrett that Bruhn is slowly dying he realizes that once Bruhn is dead his degenerates will have their way with their women and pillage then destroy the 'town'. Thus, Starrett offers to escort Bruhn and his gang to safe environs through a hidden snow-covered trail that even the cavalry doesn't know about. The savvy Bruhn feels this is a ruse and confronts Starrett who admits the ploy and elucidates his concerns. Bruhn, always seeming to have a veiled sympathy for the women and boy, goes along with the subterfuge. Starrett leads them on their endless trek through the austere, snow-racked wilderness---I have never seen horses struggle in the snow as in this film. When Bruhn's closest aide, a young man who is not all bad, loses his horse the boss orders him to walk knowing this may be his only chance of survival once he expires. Bruhn eventually succumbs to his wound. Two members of the gang are subsequently murdered by their comrades so that there would be a greater share of the cash to be divided. They trudge on and on, horses having to be put to sleep, until eventually they get to the end of nowhere and the last two scoundrels freeze to death, Starrett the only survivor. Kudos to director Andre De Toth for such a singular film done with noteworthy skill. His use of long-distance filming with concomitant hard-to-hear conversations allowing the stark, bleak black & white environs do the talking was marvelous. And how about the masterful and mesmerizing so-called 'Saturday night dance' scene. Here Bruhn relents and allows his animals one night with the women for dancing---still no drink or hanky panky. The dance is harsh, disturbing and sexually frenetic with Tina Louise's [Ginger from Gilligan's Island] hair unfolding and splaying while being circled---her stilted, stiffened posture symbolic of both the women's repulsion and their partner's repressed carnal state---a vicarious rape of the women. Hurried conclusion minor beef.

It's clear that the people behind the recent Vampire flick ""30 Days of Night"" were inspired by Day of the Outlaw too, as there are recurrent images and themes regarding the vampire siege of the town that are lifted from this stark, unflinching drama.

Burl Ives proves once again how great a character actor he was, mixing mano a mano not just with Robert Ryan as the flawed hero but also his men - a gangly group of unbridled id every bit as scary as the bloodthirsty vampires in 30 Days of Night.

3362610,4,B0014BJ1DG,"Andre De Toth's ""Day of the Outlaw(1959)"" is one of the grimmest and most tense Westerns of the 1950s. The genre had really come of age that decade with a much stronger emphasis on adult themes and the lines between hero and villain starting to become blurred for all time. This film may include a B-movie title but does not properly convey what is a suspense classic with a high level of intelligence.

The film tells the story of a rancher(Robert Ryan) who is one conflicted dude. He is being forced out of town by the very people he had protected, getting his land stomped upon and is bitter that one of the town's lead ranchers has married the love of his life(Tina Louise). He is about to duel the husband and two other men when a gang of outlaws arrive in town led by Burl Ives. He is a former cavalery Captain who now leads a group of bank robbers who are making off with a load of stolen gold with Cavalery on there trail. Ive's men are homicidal maniacs and lay siege to the small town. They listen to Ives but he is dying from a gunshot wound and it's only a matter of time before the outlaws tear the town apart.

The film is highly tense with wonderful Black and White cinematography that combine a sense of naturalistic beauty with the snow and wilderness and a high sense of dread. The segment where all the girls in the town are forced to dance with the outlaws is one of the more tense and disturbing filmed in a Western. Beautiful Tina Louise particularly stands out as the camera stays on her being flung from man to man her tied up hair loosening with each swing until it hangs free and she becomes increasingly disheaveled and sexy as her classy refined demeanor is stripped away in real time as she dances about the room. It's incredibly well done.

The conclusion is a surprise and shocking, certainly one of the most unique ever seen in a Western and adding truth to an inevitable that Robert Ryan's character knows to be the entire time as the outlaws meet there fate in the snowy wilderness.

The performances are all sharp led by Robert Ryan, a great underused actor, who delivers a world weariness more effectively than about any other actor this side of Robert Mitchum. He isn't just mean and tough but human and flawed. His level of intelligence and strength and the demons that drive him make him a interesting and complex Western hero.

Burl Ives equals him as the outlaw's leader bringing a gruffness and toughness that fits well but also a sense of dignity and righteousness as a soldier who hides a bitter secret. Ives is able to evoke sympathy for his Captain turned bandit and it's probally the anchor to the picture.

Tina Louise is gorgeous in Black and White and it's difficult to remember that she'll be most famous on the silly sitcom, ""Gilligan's Island"" and proves that she was an adept Dramatic actress as well as being gorgeous. Her character offers alot of complexities as well even if her and Ryan's relationship is underutilized and not as explored as it should have been.

This DVD looks great with a stunning Widescreen transfer and a decent price. Western and Noir fans should check this out if they are interested in the dramatic aspects of Western filmmaking. This film deserves a wider audience.",1247875200,5,3249,4.543589743589743
3362611,4,B0014BJ1DG,"In the 1950s, westerns took a turn to the more intellectual with less reliance on mindless action, Day of the Outlaw is one of those psychological westerns.  Rancher Blaise Starrett (what a cool western name) owns a spread in the mountains of Wyoming, but he's having trouble with the local farmers who want to fence off the area.  But just when the confrontation is coming to a full boil, a gang of vicious renegades on the run ride into town to rest up after being chased by the cavalry for robbing an Army payroll.  Now Blaise and the townfolk must band together if they hope to survive against these ruthless killers.  Being a psychological western, there isn't a ton of action here, but when it comes it's surprising and meant to catch you off guard.  Not many westerns filmed in winter settings, but the snowy locations add to the dark, cynical feel of the movie and the use of black and white really adds to the effect.  Take advantage of this new DVD, the movie's well worth a watch.

  The always reliable Robert Ryan leads a strong cast as Blaise Starrett, the Wyoming rancher who's always been interested in his own problems but now finds himself having to look out for the well-being of others.  Starrett makes a noble transformation by the end of the movie, something you actually believe in because it's Robert Ryan.  Singer Burl Ives gives a startling performance as Captain Jack Bruhn, a cavalry officer with a checkered past now leading a band of ruthless renegades.  Bruhn is not like his men and single-handedly keeps them behaved.  A pre-Gilligan's Island Tina Louise shows what a good actress she is as Helen Crane, a farmer's wife who has feelings for Starrett but neither of them know what to do if they want to be together.  Jack Lambert and Lance Fuller are very good as Tex and Pace, two of Bruhn's gang and maybe the most dangerous of them all.  Other recognizable western faces here include Nehemiah Persoff, Elisha Cook, Dabbs Greer, Alan Marshal, and David Nelson.

  The DVD has a widescreen presentation of the movie in its original black and white format.  The Andre De Toth directed movie looks great with all the snowy locations, but unfortunately there's no special features here.  The movie's a good one though, especially Robert Ryan and Burl Ives, so give Day of the Outlaw a try!",1224979200,2,2319,4.679012345679013

8254910,5,B0014BJ1DG,"I am a fan of Robert Ryan and Burl Ives. I had no idea Tina Louise looked this good as a brunette. lol Anyway, I have an original DVD issued from MGM/20th Century Fox that I found at a used Book/DVD place locally. The movie looked really good for a black and white DVD. I played it on my Sony Blu-ray player and UHD 4K 55"" Vizio. The sound was good and picture was good for a 1959 flick.
I didn't have any issues with the movie, in fact, it was quite believable to me. Ryan's character has issues with one of the men in this small town and it turns out that it takes a ""backseat"" when ""Ive's"" character plus his band of thugs walks right in on them at the saloon.
The focus is now on the men in the saloon and the citizens of the town's safety. The gang of outlaws, being on the run from the U.S. Cavalry, take time in the town to gather themselves after a rough ride of about several weeks.

The subplot, Tina Louise' character knows that her husband is no gun toting man and would probably die at the hands of Robert Ryan's character, the local ""tough guy"" in town. So, she offers herself to Ryan to leave her husband alone, once and for all. But, Ryan knows that it won't stop him from doing what he wanted in the first place and that was not to have barbed wire fencing cutting off cattle grazing land in the area.
Something Tina's husband is all in favor of because of the purchase of the barbed wire.

But, for now, the main problem is the gang that just rode into town and what to do with them. After a surgery to remove a gunshot bullet out of ""Ive's"" character, his health seems to sour. Once Ryan knowns this, he uses this to his advantage. His ultimate goal is to get them out of the town altogether and tell them there is a passage way through the mountains. Once all the gang members believe this, they set forth on the journey which takes them to a snowy covered mountain range, blowing blustering cold wind at every turn. Ryan's character knows that the gang won't make it out of there alive. That was his idea all along. Get them out of the town and into the snowy mountains, where they can die one at a time, or take each other out for greed over the gold they have in the bags they are carrying.
Great movie and lots of drama.

8254915,5,B0014BJ1DG,"This is an overlooked Western of tremendous quality.  An engrossing character study of Ryan's conflicted ""good guy"" and equally developed is the ostensible ""bad guy"" played by Ives who looks for a kind of redemption.  The tension builds as the events unfold, and the certainty of a bad end becomes evident, and it is just a question of who will be face this end.  Unlike most Westerns filmed in a dry, hot environment, this is filmed in the cold mountains deep in snow.  As in all good Westerns, the country itself is a major character and the white, gray, black colors of this film create a backdrop that highlights the actions of plot and character.  If you like Westerns or film noir, this is a movie not to miss.",1467849600,,716,4.51937984496124
