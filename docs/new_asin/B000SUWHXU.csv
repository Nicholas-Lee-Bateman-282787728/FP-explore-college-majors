8206933,5,B000SUWHXU,"Childhood memories of sitting around all day watching this over and over can now be repeated.

And also, now that I have a kid of my own we can take comfort and joy knowing the annoyance we cause daddy with all the cheezy songs.

It is everything I remembered and loved about this specific Dot movies.",1410998400,,301,4.357142857142857

8206935,5,B000SUWHXU,"My first experience with the ""Dot"" movies was with the kangaroo and I was left in tears at the ending. This one left me ridiculously oblivious to my normal everyday life and I really do still like it. All of the ""Dot"" movies leave a message about respecting nature and all it's inhabitants; not just for now but for the future of the world. If we can't learn to live in harmony with nature, then how can we hope that our children won't suffer because of our ignorance? My only beef with this movie was a single scene where Dot's foot got pricked by a coral plant. The music was great and so was the plot lines.

I would recommend this movie to anybody who has an affection for animals and/or those who have children living near a naval museum.",1385942400,,743,4.307142857142857
8206936,4,B000SUWHXU,This movie is a perfect reflection of my childhood! My kids got to enjoy a piece of the 80s. They were taken aback by the ridiculously bad animation.  Good message!,1360454400,,164,4.466666666666667
