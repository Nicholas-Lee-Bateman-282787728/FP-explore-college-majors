7845362,2,6303346391,"Ma and Pa Kettle on Vacation, 1953 film

Pa prepares breakfast in the kitchen for Ma. A letter arrives; it has two airline tickets to New York then on to Paris France. They need a babysitter. Pa borrows tobacco. Vaccinations and passport photos next. They arrive at Idlewild Airport in New York City. TWA has a four engine Lockheed Constellation to cross the Atlantic in hours instead of days by ship. A passenger asks Pa to deliver a letter to him in Paris, and explains why. They arrive in Paris. A stranger talks to Pa and offers to sell him French postcards. Mr. Wade arrives. The Kettles sample caviar. A couple visit Mr. Wade. Pa brings that letter to Mr. Wade and is attacked! Ma and Mr. Johnson arrive to find Pa unconscious. Mr. Craft buys them wine at Cafe d t.

There is a show with dancing girls. Then dance music. Craft dances with Ma. Next a French Apach dance. Ma joins the act. The morning newspaper tells of Wades death. That letter is given to the US Embassy, it has important secret information! Pa will carry that letter but with different papers inside as a lure for the spies. Pa and Johnson sit at a sidewalk caf and eat escargot. Craft meets them, then leaves. Pa buys French postcards. They visit another caf. There is more humor. The next morning there is a complication when Ma and Mrs. Johnson are abducted by the spies to get that letter! Can Pa get the police to follow him? Yes. [Was this copied from a Keystone Kops movie?] They all arrive at that shop. Back home Geoduck views those French postcards. The Kettle home was redecorated.

A good movie needs a good story; this is at best average. Its subject matter reflects its era, but seems dated now.",1504656000,,1683,4.47557003257329

7845365,3,6303346391,"Fifth in the Ma and Pa Kettle series, following their introduction to audiences in THE EGG AND I, this entry reunites the Kettles (Percy Kilbride and Marjorie Main) with their new snobbish in-laws, the Parkers (Ray Collins and Barbara Brown) from MA AND PA KETTLE BACK ON THE FARM, for an adventure set in Paris. The quality of the supporting cast is all that might be asked from Universal Studios, but the screenplay falls well below the comedic norm set by better examples from the Kettle canon. The Parkers have discarded their airs and have asked Ma and Pa to be their traveling companions to France after friends cancelled. During the flight to Paris, a mysterious seat mate of Pa Kettle gives him an envelope to keep for him, asking for Pa's promise to return it at the Louis Quatorze Hotel, where all primary parties in the plot will be staying. An espionage angle is soon introduced, with a pair of ""Secret Service"" men being assigned by the U.S. Embassy to guard the Kettles, Pa now holding a bogus replacement envelope as lure to foreign spies who are also tailing the farmer duo. In addition to these cloak and dagger shenanigans, the couples visit a nightclub where they see (and interfere with) a floor show and, at the hotel, Pa attempts to purchase ""French postcards"" at the request of Indian friends who are taking care of the Kettle farm during their Parisian junket. Charles Lamont effectively directed the first two Kettle amusements, but this time a weak scenario provides little with which he can lead, and the sight gags that Kilbride pulls off when he is at his best are simply tiresome (after the first scene) as the film declines too often into slapstick. There are bright notes: good supporting turns from Sig Ruman, Jay Novello and Ivan Triesault; burnished cinematography from George Robinson; and astonishing dresses created for Main by Rosemary O'Dell that bring a chuckle.",1105833600,3,1903,4.82262996941896
7845366,4,6303346391,"At odds in Ma and Pa Kettle Back on The Farm, now the Kettles and their daughter-in-law's parents are friends and vacationing together in Paris.  The delicate balance of social wit and screwball comedy that permeated  classics such as The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle is back.  It is  worth noting that 3 of the best Kettle films, The Further Adventures of Ma  and Pa Kettle, Ma and Pa Kettle Go To Town, and Ma and Pa Kettle on  Vacation, were the three directed by Charles Lamont.  This is a classic  Kettle film.  While it isn't as smooth as the other two Lamont Films, this  one is still a must see.  Ma's reaction to the entertainment, and Pa's  innocent involvement in a spy ring are among the highlights that this film  has to offer.",962409600,,750,4.426470588235294
