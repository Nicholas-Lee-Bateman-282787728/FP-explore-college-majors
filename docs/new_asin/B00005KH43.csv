8173608,4,B00005KH43,"Dubbed in English.  Typical kung-fu movie about revenge and fight scenes are well choreographed.  Some sword fight scenes do slow down, but done well.  The police captain of a local town arrested a big boss of a local bandit for two years.  When the captain takes a vacation to visit his family, the bandit takes the opportunity to help their boss escape.  After escaping, they seek revenge with the captain and kills his wife and daughter.  Now the captain seek revenge with the bandit.  The bandit has a major project to loot a wealthy family in another town.  While the bandit plans to break into the vault of the wealthy family, the captain plans to get his revenge against the bandit.  On the way, the captain gains a partner while the boss sends off most of his bandit to die so that he can get a bigger cut of the loot.  This movie has nothing to do with Shaolin, so it really shouldn't have it in the movie title; somewhat misleading.  Maybe the kung-fu resembles that of Shaolin technique, but one can't tell what style it is as most fights in this movie are sword/knife fights.",1518480000,,1087,4.494897959183674
8173609,4,B00005KH43,"Since I purchased this film I have watched it several times and I still think that this is a good martial art movie, it has an all star cast and most of the fight scenes are good.",1169596800,,179,3.864864864864865
8173610,4,B00005KH43,"Uhmmmm, let's see, what's the perfect making of a good kung fu flick. Hey, I know! What about you being a policeman who kicks the butts of some local criminals who break into your house.  You try to defend your family and your honor, but then here comes that ""curve"" ball.  These thugs then pull your family out of the bedroom and hold knives to their throats. Not only that, they grab hold of you and make you watch while they're murder your family.  It doesn't stop there! They then force you to the floor and chop off your thumb.  Do you know the things you are not able to do if you are missing a thumb?  Never thought about it, right?  After he escapes, all he can think about is getting revenge on the animals who tore his world apart.

Now this is the making of a good kung fu movie.

Not the best I've seen, but isn't revenge sweet anyway!",1127606400,,847,4.185185185185185
8173611,5,B00005KH43,Another quality piece of work by the Wu tang Clan. Tons of extras and the DVD menus are superb-better than the major studios in most cases. I also can recommend the Wu's newest release of Shaolin Drunkard and Kung Fu of 8 Drunkards. Top notch!,1018396800,,243,4.4222222222222225
8173612,2,B00005KH43,"This movie actually has a plot.  It's a drama with some kung-fu, although the action and fight scenes were not that great.  But the twist and turns makes it some-what-o.k.",1012262400,,171,4.666666666666667

8173614,4,B00005KH43,"3.5 stars for the movie 5 stars for the DVD.
The story begins with the star Chen Kuan Tai's family being killed by Lau Kar Wing, Leung Kar Yan and Wilson Tong. During the fight that ensues, Chen loses a thumb in the battle. He manages to escape and vows revenge. Enter Meng Fei. He's a scam artist of sorts who forgres a relationship with Chen to thwart the  crew of Lau, Leung and Tong. The movie picture is of decent quality and the sound is very good. The DVD is laced with extras including interviews with Meng Fei, Wilson Tong and  Leung Kar Yan. There are 8 previews of other GZ releases, Wu Tang video, interview, and commentary plus interviews with two kung fu masters. THis may not be the movie for you as some of the  Kung Fu is of average speed with pre-1978 flair but I will say that the layout of this DVD is the best I have ever seen to date. If Ground Zero continues with this..would you ever buy from anyone else!?",996710400,2,930,4.213483146067416
