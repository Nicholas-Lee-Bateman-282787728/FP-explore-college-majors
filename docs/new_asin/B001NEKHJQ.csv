8326611,5,B001NEKHJQ,"This set is a fabulous way to start practicing yoga.  Flow Yoga for Beginners is incredibly relaxing.  Although Shiva Rea can surely bend like a pretzel, rather than showing off, she models appropriate beginner poses with instructions on modifications, breathing techniques, and tips for listening to your body.  Creative Core Abs is a wonderful ab workout. If you allow yourself to let go and be creative.  You will likely learn to move your body in ways it has not moved since you were a small child- and somehow this is really refreshing.  When I started Creative Core and Upper Body I was shocked to hear that I would be doing 108 push ups.  I thought, no way, this lady is crazy- but she gets you through them and leads you energizing stretches- surprisingly my arms do not get very sore after doing these exercises- which, I guess, speaks to the importance of the stretching.  Creative core and lower body is also a good workout, but I honestly do not use it as much as the other four.  I love Yoga Trance Dance for when I am stressed out or overwhelmed I am not sure if it is a great aerobic workout, because I am not sure that the point of it is to be a workout... but it makes me feel a lot better.",1238889600,3,1207,4.357142857142857
