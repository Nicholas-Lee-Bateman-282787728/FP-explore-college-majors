8619381,5,B00FY84G12,"Understanding the Battle of the Atlantic is central to understanding World War II. This superbly filmed documentary is a must for history buffs who are looking for a relatively easy way to connect with the war as it was fought off America's eastern shores. While the piece doesn't purport to be the definitive account of the Battle of the Atlantic altogether, it nevertheless does do a great job of bringing to life hitherto untrodden historical territory about the war that defined the second half of the twentieth century.",1408406400,2,524,4.965909090909091

They sank merchant vessels because our east coast was the launching platform to England. The big ""cover up"" is an outright lie. U-boat sightings and shipping losses were big news, and were printed on front pages with photos. Sometimes sailors would come ashore to look around. Usually ending up in bars. That's it. No master plan, no invasion, just a couple of bored bubble-heads on recon. We also had sub defenses, including armed sub-hunting aircraft, coastal blackouts, and a huge VA Navy base, all before Pearl Harbor.

8619384,5,B00FY84G12,"This video does an excellent job telling the true story of the battle of the Atlantic.  Not many people realize how close WWII came to our Eastern shore.  Today, the technology exists to find and identify the ships sunk  off of the Atlantic coast.  This video makes history come alive.",1391558400,4,285,4.64
