1179943,5,B000003KJX,this is first ever godzilla movie and on th top ten list.storyline.over sea ships or being destroyed and the surviors are horrobly burnt then giant tracks are discovered around the beaches then a giant lizard appears and leaves tokeo in firey ruins. NOTE:the godzilla in godzilla raids again is not the same one in this film the one in this film is killed,996883200,7,355,4.650793650793651
1179944,5,B000003KJX,"The 1998 version of ""Godzilla"", complete with computer-generated special effects, proved my theory that the only way to make a Godzilla movie is to put a guy in a rubber suit, let him run roughshod over an endless array of miniature sets, and whatever you do, don't forget that glorious sound affect that our hero makes when he's mad.  This is the film that launched the whole Godzilla franchise and really the only one that takes a serious approach.  Apparently Raymond Burr's scenes were pieced in after filming was completed, almost like an afterthought, but it somehow works.  Although all of the other entries in this series are campy, they're worth watching for the laughs and for the dreadful dubbing.",990748800,7,708,4.883333333333334
1179995,5,B000003KJX,"Classic monster movie, the absolute best.  I loved it as a kid, I still love it decades later.  One of my all time favorite monster movies, and still the best Godzilla movie of them all.",1467849600,,186,4.285714285714286
1179996,4,B000003KJX,"It's good for what it is, but we don't need a repackaging of what Classic Media did right the first time. This should have been both Raymond Burr Godzilla movies ...King of the Monsters and Godzilla 1985.",1466294400,,204,4.54054054054054
1179997,5,B000003KJX,If you like old sci fi movies this is a must buy. I had only seen the one with Raymond Burr but this includes the Japanese version as well. It was interesting to see the differences. The American version tells the story as a series of flashbacks as Raymond Burr a reporter narrates. The Japanese version has a more anti nuclear theme and a few extra scenes than the American version.,1464307200,,383,4.408450704225352
1179998,4,B000003KJX,"OK, I got what I expected and the quality was as I expected.  Also the shipping was quick.  So, no problems with Amazon or its Marketplace seller.  But I did take away one star for 2 ""weirdisms.""  The DVD case said clearly that both movies (""Godzilla"" and ""Gojira"") were in a 4:3 aspect ratio.  And, that's what they appeared to be - except for the end credits, which were in a widescreen format.  Go figure.  But both of the actual DVDs had the word ""widescreen"" printed on them.  The 2nd weird thing is that the DVD case shows ""Gojira"" coming out in 1964 and ""Godzilla"" in 1966 - 10 years after they ""really"" came out.  So, one strike for the DVD manufacturer.

Campy today.  But back when it came out in the USA (I was 6 at the time), this film had power.  And the Japanese anti-nuclear message came through loud and clear.  Made sense.  The atomic bomb drops on Hiroshima & Nagasaki were ""recent history"" for Japan (only 9 years earlier at the time ""Gojira"" came out in Japan).  And, there must have still been a keen sense of shock and worry in Japan's culture.",1463443200,3,1066,4.36734693877551

1180033,5,B000003KJX,Has both movies- the original Japanese movie w/English subtitles and the Americanized version of the same movie in English but does not compare to the Japanese version- the story line was changed slightly and was hard to follow at times but was nice to watch both! Was great to finally see the FIRST and original Godzilla-- there's only ONE Godzilla and the Japanese (Toho studio) do it as only they can. Nobody else has their touch and creativity and humor that really make the Godzilla movies great and unique. Well worth the money and a must for almost any and all collections. This is where it all started and I hear that TOHO was not really planning on making more Godzilla movies after this one because it was just too outrageous!!,1435622400,6,737,4.633587786259542

However, immediately upon arriving at home, I got on Amazon and purchased the original with Raymond Burr.  There are just some movies that shouldn't be remade, and this is one of them.  The story, the acting, Japanese and American are just superlative to any other version (especially, the horrendous Matthew Brodderick version - whoever thought Godzilla was an iguana is an idiot!).  But, it's the monster that makes the movie.  I must have watched this film at least 150 times since I was a kid, and, this rubber suited monster is just believable and especially believable to me.  The roar of this Godzilla still generates monster thrills and chills.  Leave my Godzilla alone, and never, never make another version.

1180140,5,B000003KJX,"I'll admit it, I've never been a huge fan. Most of the sequels were bad... so bad. But this original was totally awesome! And I would have never checked it out if it wasn't for my dad who tried to convince me that it was a great movie, and once I seen it, I agreed. It was a serious action/drama/horror film with a great story, great acting, great characters, and great visuals for the time. I'm very glad I bought it.

This DVD includes both the American edit of the film ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" and the original Japanese edit ""Gojira (aka: Godzilla)"". I loved both edits equally. Loved the added scenes in the Japanese version and loved Raymond Burr in the American edit. And unlike many of the sequels, the American edit in no way alters the original concept of the film nor the drama and it has some great voice dubbing.

Plot:

When ships start to disappear and are mysteriously destroyed in the South Pacific, an investigation begins which reveals that the ships were destroyed by an intense blast of radioactive energy. The superstitious villagers of Odo island believe it's the mythical monster Godzilla. Of course this is disputed at first, but it soon becomes clear that Godzilla is no myth when giant radioactive footprints appear in the earth and the monstrous beast rises up from the ocean and comes inland to Tokyo. Godzilla is a giant indestructible reptile, mutated due to nuclear weapons tests. Now it has arrived in Tokyo to wreak havoc on the city. With the military battling it with every weapon available to them, Godzilla continues its rampage. Is there any way of stopping it before it makes mankind an endangered species?

It's very suspenseful, dramatic, and eerie. One of the best monster movies ever made! Highly Recommended!",1401494400,18,1761,4.7639344262295085

7902984,2,B000003KJX,"Godzilla: King of the Monsters, 1956 film

It begins with a view of ruins in Tokyo. One survivor is Steve Martin, a journalist who climbs out from the wreckage. Could this destruction happen again? There is an odor of burnt flesh. Amiko finds Steve among the survivors. Earlier there was an explosion beneath the waves, destroying a ship at sea. When Steve arrived in Japan he was questioned by Security about what he witnessed on his flight from United World News in Chicago. Other ships are obliterated by a blinding flash. Survivors did not last long. Scientists investigated this tragedy. One survivor said he saw a monster. There is a disturbance at night on the island: wind, rain, and lightning. What caused it? Witnesses were questioned. Was it a monster? A ship is sent to investigate the damage. The ground is radioactive. One man finds a trilobite. A bell rings an alarm! Then a monster appears, people run in panic. Was Godzilla a relic from the Jurassic Age? How did it reappear today? Did Strontium 90 cause this?

Amiko visits a scientist who has a fish tank. and a secret. Navy ships drop explosives into the sea to destroy the monster. Then Godzilla appears inside of Tokyo Harbor! The military responds. The 400 foot tall Godzilla walks ashore and destroys buildings by the waterfront. People are evacuated for safety. Godzilla walks out of Tokyo Bay, the Army fires cannons at the creature. High tension wires cant stop it. Its breath causes fires. Nothing can stop it! Armored vehicles cant stop it and are destroyed. There is a wall of flames in Tokyo. Godzilla continues its destruction! Buildings collapse. People watch helplessly. Jet airplanes fire rockets at Godzilla. Wounded people are taken to hospitals. What can be done to stop the monster? What if the oxygen in the water was destroyed? This is a tough decision for the scientist. Divers go beneath the sea to search for Godzilla and kill the monster. The poison is released in the water, the monster expires.

This is at best an average story. How did a lack of oxygen in the water affect an air-breathing reptile? Godzilla symbolizes the horror of atomic bombs that destroyed people and buildings; or the fire-bombing that also did the same. The story of a monster from the sea goes back over a thousand years to Beowulf. The movie Jaws was a better movie; it was based on a true story from the Jersey Shore in 1916. Close to Shore by Michael Capuzzo is one book about this event.",1515456000,,2464,4.738927738927739

7902990,5,B000003KJX,"Yes, thats right. This is not just a good movie but a great one. Here's why: Despite the primitive special effects of an impoverished 1954 Japanese film industry (the war had been over less than 9 years) the movie has a gripping realism that is hypnotic. This is magnified by being shot in black and white which gives it a newsreel-like look and feel. Then there's Akira Ikufube's haunting score. So powerful is his ""Prayer of Peace"" choir towards the end of the film that it has been performed countless times live.
