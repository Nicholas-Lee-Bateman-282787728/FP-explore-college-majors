1729692,3,B0000694ZF,"this is a double disc 2 movie edition. 1st is the da last don and its a good movie but its only 45 minutes long, but it has good quality to it. lots of girls, guns,and drugs.
2nd disc is the im bout it which is an ok movie but the quality really sucks. it probally costs them only a couple thousand to make this film, not that good. overall i would pay no more than 10 dollars for the 2 dvd's.",1073865600,4,393,3.8048780487804876

7964987,3,B0000694ZF,"it's great for all the guys to enjoy a good R&R watching these flicks. but not for a wholesome family to partake. oh by ghetto, i mean ""low-budget."" don't let this word scare you away, they did a pretty decent job for what they spent making these movies. ""i'm bout it"" is nice and quite entertaining. that's personally the movie i was going for until i saw this double pack. ""da last don"" is full of stereotypical and generalized personas. it just makes me laugh. very cheese worthy but fun if you don't mind the script. either one doesn't have the best acting nor the worst, but it's nice to see your fav rapper on the tube or plasma/lcd tv ya got. and yeah, the price isn't bad at all.",1200614400,,687,4.292307692307692
7964988,2,B0000694ZF,"I'm not sure if ""the last don"" was a comedy or what.  The story line and the characthers aren't even close to what the portray to be.

There's no way I would consider Master P a good actor.  Decent, maybe.",1140480000,2,205,4.075
7964989,5,B0000694ZF,"DA LAST DON is a short film but very good with 2 music videos at the end.

BOUT IT ia a classic film which is very real,

IF YOU ARE A FAN OF NO LIMIT - GET IT.

MASTER P IS A PRETTY GOOD ACTOR.",1121472000,3,194,3.2666666666666666
