7733216,5,B01E898YZQ,"So I finally watched ""pieces of talent"" today. A strong recommendation from my friend Bryan, administrator of the Fitz of Horror page on facebook. The movie was a very well plotted out work of violent and twisted beauty. Truly only a mastermind could have put something together that was so cleverly designed.

Thank you Fitz of Horror, for letting me borrow your copy, I loved it! And I'm glad I bought one of the 150 limited edition, producer signed Bluray copies.",1460678400,,466,4.753086419753086
7733217,5,B01E898YZQ,"An amazing first effort from director Joe Stauffer. The story follows an aspiring actress Charlott (Kristi Ray) and a Charismatic and demented serial killer, David Long, who just wants to make beautiful movies......Maybe not the kind of films Charlotte intended to star in.
This film will stick with you and demands multiple watches.",1460505600,,333,5.30188679245283

8758051,1,B01E898YZQ,"Pretty boring. Lots of cheap handy cam scenes. There's no atmosphere & the acting is largely terrible apart from the two main characters who were unfortunately unsupported.
Weak kills. Uninspired.
I only made it to the bowling alley scene before succumbing to lack of interest.
There's obvious movie making talent there but it wasn't quite tapped into with this film.",1462579200,,367,5.133333333333334

I never thought I would say a horror movie is beautiful, but this one earns that title. Do yourself a favor a grab a copy!",1460764800,2,249,4.319148936170213
8758059,5,B01E898YZQ,"I initially was able to watch this movie for free streaming while the creators were trying to get the word out. I was glued to the movie from start to finish. I wasn't truly sure how I felt about the movie at first. I liked it, but I wasn't sure to what degree. But it kept coming back to my mind. It left it's mark on me. I ordered the DVD from their site a few days later. Watched it with my mother, who really enjoyed it. Then I lent it to my sister. I've never seen her so entranced by a horror film. She couldn't take her eyes away and talked about the film for a week, still mentioning it on occasion.

David Long is great in this and Kristi Ray is wonderful. Their both so organic. It doesn't feel like acting, feels like you're watching someone living their lives. The FX are very nicely done. There is some gore, but it's not over the top and what's there is really nice.

I'd recommend any horror movie enthusiast to at least give the movie a real chance. I fell in love with this movie, even kicked in some dough in the hopes to get a sequel going, which I really hope their still going to do.",1460678400,3,1104,4.082949308755761
