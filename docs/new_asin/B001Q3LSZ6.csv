8334979,1,B001Q3LSZ6,"I'm only writing because we have been waiting for series 5 to be on USA format.
PBS has had it on the network.  Unfortunely can't always catch all the story lines.
Having purchase 1-4 would like to have 5 in the collection.
So, does anyone know when? They say there has been 6 in the works.  Looks like a long wait.",1359417600,,315,4.147540983606557
8334980,5,B001Q3LSZ6,"Great show!
I live In the States and  a lot of my movies come from England, as do I, so many years ago I purchased a region free dvd player from amazon for about $30, I also went onto Amazon UK and purchased one for my family members that way I can send them movies that have just been released here and Vice versa.",1357257600,4,315,3.921875
8334981,5,B001Q3LSZ6,"Hard to believe that people would give this fantastic show 1 star because it was not in Region 1 format. You do know that they sell Region Free DVD Players don't you? And they are very inexpensive.

 This season of the show is back to being great mainly because the brought Adrian Lester back (Mickey Bricks), I am not sure why he was not in the cast for season 4 and even though season 4 was good the show missed Mickey, well he is back and the show is back to its best with him leading the crew.

 Once again, go to Google, type in Region Free DVD Players, and there you have it.",1355616000,4,581,4.0701754385964914
8334982,5,B001Q3LSZ6,"The other reviewers downgrading this show because of region locking?  How lame.  There are ways around region locking, this is the internet, look it up.  No, you shouldn't have to do that, but you shouldn't have to do a lot of things in life.

If you can figure out the above, this is definitely a great series, really fun to watch.",1326672000,13,332,4.39344262295082
8334983,1,B001Q3LSZ6,"The rating is for NOT allowing us to have Hustle.

Hustle was one of the best mini series ever shown on AMC. So when Amazon began selling, I snapped it up. Season 4 dropped off with the absence of Adrian Lester; 5 brought him back BUT now Jaime Murray is gone! Nevertheless I got to see it when I was in the UK & thought to buy it once available. For some bizzare reason BBC/Amazon released 5 only in ""region 2"", so I can't have it. COME ON! What kind of business decision is this??",1323043200,12,482,4.073684210526316
8334984,1,B001Q3LSZ6,"I cannot truly review this season, due to the fact it only plays in Region 2.  Alas, I am in Region 1.  I liked very much seasons 1-4, and was very disappointed to find I could not continue with the series, as it is only in Region 2.  If the publishers of this series are hearing me . . . . I want it in Region 1, as I would like to continue watching it!

Thanks for 4, boo on 5.

8334985,4,B001Q3LSZ6,"Maybe I'll start by giving all praise to my recently gotten region-free DVD player. Else, I would've gone stark raving loony waiting for this one to come out on a Region 1 DVD. But I just saw HUSTLE Series 5 and it was, as expected, very entertaining. Five series into it, and Mickey Bricks' crew is still stylishly pulling off fast ones, although, technically, it's not the same crew, what with actors Marc Warren (""Danny Blue"") and Jamie Murray (""Stacie Monroe"") having amscrayed to what they hope were greener pastures. But HUSTLE Series 5 does feature the return of the conning crew's mastermind Mickey Stone a.k.a. ""Mickey Bricks."" He's come back to London only to learn that recession had scattered away the old gang. Their old hangout, Eddie's Bar, had gone out of business, with Eddie himself now toiling away as a low cog in a posh restaurant. Still, it doesn't take but two shakes of a feather for Mickey Bricks to reassemble his old crew, part of it anyway.

Mickey, master of the long con, and Ash ""Three Socks"" Morgan, fixer extraordinaire, are eventually joined by new recruits, Emma and Sean Kennedy, sister and brother orphans who'd fallen thru society's cracks and had survived on their own, on the streets, by scamming them gullible mugs. Emma, the older sibling, is the one with the talent. Kid brother Sean is just along for the ride. Initially. The crew's roper (he ropes in the marks) Albie Stroller (Robert Vaughn) doesn't take an active role until a few episodes in, what with this distinguished old Yank currently cooling his heels in stir.

It's a nod to how fantastic and integral Marc Warren and Jaime Murray were to this show that it took me a few episodes to get comfortable with the new group dynamics. But Kelly Adams and Matt Di Angelo seem to have a good fit, with Di Angelo's role of Sean becoming the new point of view character for the audience. Sean, essentially a rookie to this grifting trade, is the one to whom the rules of the con have to be explained. Thankfully, these bits of exposition are still enlivened by the show's visually very cool application of the freeze frame device. Kelly Adams, meanwhile, injects her own brand of sexy into the show, demonstrating maybe not as much cool sophistication as Jaime Murray but more moxie, more attitude.

What HUSTLE hasn't lost is that sense of elegance and charm and cheek. And the humor is still there. The cast still ingratiates itself by gracing the camera with knowing looks and roguish grins (although no one did this better than Jaime Murray). These episodes do their best to recreate the old romanticism of the con, and it helps quite a bit that the crew only goes after them unsavory marks what absolutely deserves getting fleeced. Rule one of the con states: ""You can't cheat an honest man."" For Mickey Bricks, there's no end of greedy suckers.

Maybe the nastiest pair of villains to get tricked ever so silly appear in Series 5's second episode, ""The New Recruits."" Guest stars Adam James and John MacMillan are terrifically vile as Carlton Wood and Harry Fielding, two unscrupulous businessmen who runs a firm founded on the intellectual property of others, except that they tend to steal these very ideas (causing one man to commit suicide). Mickey Bricks gives them their comeuppance in one of the most gratifying moments I've ever had in viewing this series. But then that's topped by the sixth episode, ""The Road Less Travelled,"" as the revenge-minded Wood and Fielding return and enlist a consortium of marks who'd been hoodwinked by Mickey's crew in the past. In a neat twist, this episode opens with the villains utilizing the show's freeze frame device as they set about putting the con on our favorite bunch of grifters.

As ever, be prepared for HUSTLE to pull the rug out from under you. These likable nogoodniks tend to play mind games not only with their marks but with the viewing audience as well. As usual, there are six episodes on two discs. The set comes with two bonus features: ""Bricks & Mortar"" - an inside look into Series 5 (00:20:55 minutes long); and ""Tony Jordan: the Hustler"" - a featurette on the series creator, show runner, and writer (00:19:15 minutes).",1312761600,4,4189,4.756533700137552
