6477824,2,B00L9KB61C,"So we have another low budget zombie movie that centers around a couple's break up and them eventually getting back together.  When I watched this I noticed that it reminded me a lot of Cloverfield.  A couple has broken up, she shows up to a party with her new boyfriend and it causes tension.  Then a disaster happens and the ex-boyfriend wants to get to her to make sure she is okay and then get her to safety.  Over the course of the movie, his friends all die off one by one, sometimes sacrificing themselves pointlessly so the others can get away when they could all easily escape.  Eventually the new boyfriend dies and only the ex's are left and they make it to safety.

The zombies themselves actually look pretty good and they don't look too over the top and look like actual zombies.  They sound pretty cool as well when they growl and hiss as they are chasing people.  My favorite scene is when a guy rides by on a bicycle wearing a gas mask and is blaring rock music on a boom box strapped to the from of his bike while the characters look at him and give him a WTF look.  I have to admit that made me laugh out loud when I saw it!

A lot of times in the movie everything is tinted a certain color, like blue or green and it's a little annoying.  It's kinda like in the Matrix where in some scenes everything kind of has a green tint to it and it kinda gets annoying.

All in all the movie is pretty bad, the dialogue is stupid, the human characters are boring and forgettable, and the zombies look okay.  This is a movie you get from the Redbox or Netflix on a rainy day, or you get it from the $5.00 bin at Wal-Mart and then never watch again after the initial viewing.  Just try not to pay too much for it.",1438905600,,1721,4.144578313253012

Unusual there. Actors were quite good with a good script. It wasn't a $20 million budget movie, but I liked it better than some I've watched honestly. Not a lot of effects or CGI, but worth the price. I was entertained and interested. If you like Walking Dead for reasons other than the cool makeup on walkers... I think you'll like this movie.

Felt like some college film project.  As others wrote, it started off o.k., but then fell apart.  I like zombie films, but not this one.  Was waiting for it to be over and had to force myself to watch it till the end.  The characters made the absolute worst decisions one can make and would just throw there lives away as in ""Stay here.  I have to do this.  Go on without me.""  And then stay to get eaten.  No one really armed themselves.  One moron decided to try to fight 4 zombies (of the entire what......8 to 10 in the entire film?) with a flimsy piece of plywood.  Another had a small pocket knife and never used it until the end of the film AFTER he  did the stay behind to defend routine and was then infected before deciding to try to use it.  They are running though an EMPTY city, cars everywhere, running through an empty shopping mall, and NONE of them ever thought of stopping at a sporting goods store, or a gun shop, motorcycle shop, or auto sales (I would have hit a motorcycle shop, a gun store, prepping store or REI/Cabellas--since they only have 5 hours to leave the city before being chemically bombed).  Anyway, just the absolute dumbest decisions ruined it for me, along with no chemistry between the characters,  terrible story, rubber zombie masks and very few zombies.

6477837,3,B00L9KB61C,"This is actually very well done and had video taping and special affect considering.  The only thing that is not so believable is the fact it's in LA and there are just not enough zombies shown in the movie to be realistic.  The box or cover artwork is also pretty hoaky but it's much better than 90% of the SCI FY movies.  I think had they had a better budget and displayed a believable amount of zombies in the area it would have been much better.  The acting was pretty good and there was a few stupid scenes like most horror movies but over all very pleased with this one.  If you are  zombie fan and like the serious type zombie genre this is a good one for you to check out.  It won't light a barn fire but it will certainly entertain you.

6477838,1,B00L9KB61C,"This was a pretty bad movie. While it was nice to see some fresh new talent put to work there was zero chemistry among this ensemble. The writing was dull, the dialogue contrived and the plot never deviated from the zombie formula. The production values were cheap and the make-up amateurish at best. I kept waiting for something to show for my patience but it never materialized- even the ending was totally lame. I want my one hour and twenty-three minutes back!",1424390400,,464,4.670731707317073
6477839,2,B00L9KB61C,"This should get about 2.35 stars. It has a lot of problems. So why is it worth a shot? It gives a reason for the plague and the re-animation is not lightening fast. [That being said: Lightening fast changes speed up a film and reduce boredom, but mess with suspension of disbelief] This film keeps your interest peaked while, at the same time, you're bored. There is, also, a troubling point: ""Why does the ex-girl friend bring her new squeeze to her Ex's party. The writers assume that because he's new to the group that all viewers will automatically hate him. ""NEWSFLASH"" - The new guy does not start off as a bad person and nobody in this group is a good pal (I was hoping that they'd all die except for the veterinarian). They all are boring and substandard. Also, this follows the ""Shaun of the Dead"" plot. That is: Beer/alcohol drinking, main characters break-up, zombie problem, let's go to the beach [not bar], pick up 'ex' on the way, ... This was not a great story, the direction wasn't great, the plot was average, poor characterization, no outstanding special f/x or filming, and it was boring. But there was something interesting about it as the same time. If you only like big time movies then keep away. Same with glitz and excitement.

Enough gore but not too graphic.  Terrific shots of LA on fire, and in general, better effects than any I've seen (except the mob-at-the-wall shot in WW Z, which was the only good thing in the movie).  Couple of tiny cavils: do NOT get in an elevator during any disaster, and the ""brothers"" look  so dissimilar that they can't possibly be related despite pretty good acting.

The package looked like it was going to be decent and indeed for the first few minutes into it, it was, but it quickly evaporated. I wonder who did the casting because they didn't do their job. The zombies were clearly lacking in numbers for being a big city like L.A. of all places. The city itself has near or over 4 Million residents and you put a total of 6 zombies in it? Laughable.

Shame because it featured rather likable characters and in the beginning they had a good plot going, but the second half just got a bit stupid with everybody just throwing themselves at a Z or two to ""save"" a friend when there were tons of better options.  Still better then 90% of the cheap zombie flicks out there in that they cared to actually act, have some CGI, and a plausible reason for what was happening.

For such a low budget movie, they did a good job, beats an Asylum film any day.  Give it a chance, it isn't the best but over all not too bad.  A fun way to waste sometime and not wish for your time back like so many movies out there.

Although you can count on one hand the actual zombies appearing in the movie, it really didn't matter.  For a ""B"" movie, (seemingly filmed in a one block area), it was done great in my opinion.  The characters seemed to enjoy making this movie, and the plot is typical for a movie of this type.  Special effects added to the scenario of a zombie attack on Los Angeles made it quite entertaining.  This movie is one that you can sit back, put your feet up and watch for the enjoyment of it.  By no means is this like a Georgo Romero movie but one worth watching.",1416096000,,671,4.285714285714286
6477861,2,B00L9KB61C,"Not to cross-pollinate horror sub-genres but each time I watch a B-horror flick in which our cast of  youths makes the dumbest choices, I can't help but marvel at how genius Joss Whedon was when he created Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Whedon flipped the scenario about the airhead cheerleader ending up as the slasher's easy prey, instead making her the epic asskicker burdened with destiny. But then here's DISASTER L.A: LAST ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE BEGINS HERE (a.k.a. APOCALYPSE L.A.) wherein a group of young people flees a quarantined Los Angeles when meteor strikes dispense toxic smoke over the city, this smoke then transforming all inhalers into eventual zombies. And we're back to dumb choices.

It started out promisingly. The way it set up its premise grabbed my attention. Lead character John (Justin Ray) is hosting a party, and it's a sequence that quickly introduces the principals, from John himself to his impulsive younger bro Turner (Jerod Meagher) to his ex-girlfriend Tori (Stefanie Estes) to other hangers-on who we suspect are just there to pad the red shirt contingent. Cut to the television and news about the meteor strikes and them talking head experts reassuring the viewers that, truly, honest to gosh, the meteors pose no threat, at which point we horror veterans immediately, collectively, all should've yelled at the screen, ""Oh, crap, you had best run, you poor bastards!""

What does it say when you regain consciousness on the floor inches away from the toilet, and that's the best part of your day? The next morning finds a hung over John waking up in the loo, moments after which the meteors begin to devastate L.A. Reports begin coming in of people becoming ill and extremely violent, and we all know what's up with that. With L.A. sealed off from the outside world, can John and co. get their sh-- together long enough to get out of town?

The first half hour is a marvel and demonstrates that you can lay in world-building that hooks you even on very modest production costs. I thought that the bedlam and confusion sown and that sense of immediacy were staged very well. Sadly, after that first half hour, the story veers into B-horror clich and now come the crappy elements. In every one of these movies, there has to be some fount of B.S. sciency theories. For this movie, it's some veterinarian who - I kid you not - tries to cure zombiefication with aspirin. There are those moments where people stop in the middle of fleeing zombies just so they can engage in a heart-to-heart. Even aware of the toxic smoke, none of the characters cover their faces with handkerchiefs. Also, Los Angeles: home of the easily compromised car safety glass (only requires an errant elbow). Then we've got several idiots who unnecessarily sacrifice themselves so that the others can make it out okay. Damningly, the found-some-change-in-the-sofa budget comes into play with the sparsity of zombies on the set. It's ridiculous. It's L.A, yo. It was already teeming with the undead even before the space meteors and the transmogrifying smoke. The L.A. in this movie looks desolate and deserted, and, ratio-wise, I equate the sprinkling of zombies in this film with the scanty helping of pork in those cans of pork & beans. This movie was intended to be a character-driven zombie flick. Much of the film is about the survivors' working thru their own personal demons and their petty jealousies and rivalries even as they try to stay one step ahead of the nine or ten zombies that we do get to see in the film (note: you don't ever see more than three zombies bunch up at any one time). But, me, I didn't care about any of the characters. Mostly I watched the film clinically rather than emotionally because the story and the acting, after that first half hour, stopped drawing me in. Ultimately, I'd seen all this before, and better done before. So 2 out of 5 for this one, those 2 stars based entirely on that neat first half hour.",1415836800,8,3945,4.788546255506608

I expected something that seemed low-budget and amateurish, but it was a very, very well-made movie.

6477871,3,B00L9KB61C,"The film opens rather smartly with a good sound track. TV chatter about meteors is playing in the background of a party where we meet John (Justin Ray) the main character of little personality and his drinking buddies, ex-gf (Stefanie Estes) and her obnoxious new boy friend who we all want to see dead.

The meteors is serious stuff as we find out the President walks out of a news conference rather than read ""My Pet Goat."" At some point in time we go from shelter in place to get out of town. Much of the film is consumed with our group running around, getting picked off one by one. Of course their odds of getting out of the city would greatly increase if they would just leave the parking garage, which occupied too much of the film. Realistic emergency recorded looping radio broadcasts.

The zombies had deformed faces, zombie teeth, and vampire eyes. They were of the fast running variety, except for that token foot dragger, most likely from a director's fetish. The film needed more zombie action and less of John and his guys running around.

It's supposed to be a zombie film, but it's more of an alien invasion film because the people who are affected by the smoke from the meteors are mutated into alien like creatures.  You have got to rent this movie!  I was hooked right away with the characters alone, one in particular being the brother.  It starts out with the typical party, so many others, but it's more incisive with the characters'personalities than most ....which are filler.  During the party, there are two news reports, one of the president suddenly leaving a news conference, and another by the local channel describing icy meteors that will float by earth without any contact whatsoever.  So they go outside to look at them as if they are entertainment. That lasts about 15 minutes, and then goes to a scene of one brother lying on the floor  in the bathroom,  hung over and not hearing the noise coming outside.  But when he looks out the window, he sees mayhem everywhere and big meteor trails of smoke and burning office buildings, with military and news helicopters flying all over.
The special effects are top notch,  and very realistic.  I couldn't tell that he wasn't in this  landscape of mayhem for a second, it was that good.  All the scenes of them running through the neighborhoods are the same excellent CGI.

Even the character dialog is pretty decent the first 30 minutes in, but then it suddenly changes to random one-liners, stupid arguments, and no REAL conversations on how they (the people in the movie) will survive. It's like the script writer started with a great story idea, but then suddenly lost interest halfway through the script. You see a total of 6 zombies during the entire movie, and most of them are clearly wearing bad, rubber Halloween masks (not counting the two zombies with close ups; those make up effects were surprisingly good).

The acting, like the first thirty minutes of the movie, are pretty decent. But it all goes down hill once the cliched 'meteors' hit LA and people are warned to 'stay indoors'. And let's not forget the college kid cliche -- they party; the TV report scares them; but then they run out into hell to find a missing 'girlfriend', disrupting the group's survival plan... TWICE.

6477887,4,B00L9KB61C,"If you loved ""World War Z"" you are probably an FX junkie and therefore you might have trouble with this film because in ""Disaster L.A."" there is actual dialog between characters, and the relationships between the characters actually do influence the course of the film, and, by the way, this is a low budget film so the effects are not stupendously great.

The film focuses on a group of 20-somethings residing in Los Angeles as events spiral out of control, and as zombie flicks go ""Disaster L.A."" is better than many, if not most.  The characters are engaging and the plot unfolds in a reasonably rational manner, despite emotional conflicts between the characters and the uncertainties of the overall situation.  The cast is quite competent and makes several of Romero's efforts look like amateur productions.  One could quibble about a few things, such as a sequence of camera shots that seems to indicate a pedestrian passage leads directly from parking garage into the L.A. River, or a concrete culvert 50 yards wide, but I give it a pass.

""Disaster L.A."" is not another ""DaVinci Code"" pretending to be somehow profound.  It's a zombie flick and I call it pretty entertaining.  I'd rank it as better than ""28 Days Later,"" though not quite up to the standard of the British ""Dead Set"" miniseries.

I like it and recommend it.  I give it four stars because I'm a fan of the zombie sub-genre and of horror flicks generally.",1412812800,12,1427,4.7682926829268295

The director kept a quick pace tempo all the way through, but what I really liked was his use of the long sequence shots where instead of all that stop action peek-a-boo filming he shows a more complete visual that makes the scene more interesting and exciting. He's also great with the tension build  up, there are some really gripping scenes and moments. The characters are likable for a change, this is a nice refreshing twist. The acting's pretty good, not oscar worthy or anything but certainly better than average for this sort of movie. Also the director makes good use of the CGI he does use and gives a fairly epic feeling movie on a small budget. I do wish they had more zombies but the ones they have are pretty freaking scary. These are mean zombies. Not nice zombies. Very mean.

As zombies movies go with 28 weeks Later being a 5 star I'd give this 4 stars, just for overall fun watching this thing unfold. Its a fun movie to watch.",1412640000,6,1040,4.383419689119171

I didn't want to spoil the rest, but I'm a huge zombie fan specially a scary zombie film I can believe .

8664654,3,B00L9KB61C,"This film gets ripped, like totally trashed online far beyond what it deserves. It has many flaws and like some here have noted it has a good beginning and decent technical work. This is a small budget film and of course much of the negativity comes from people who expect Hollywood standards every time they see a film. This is especially setting oneself up for disappointment when looking at zombie films where a significant number are nowhere near even the level of a minor cable channel. For its budget this film is really good though it does itself in in other ways, mostly its script.

 The film is also very influenced by or a direct homage to Cloverfield. It opens at a young adult party where the lead characters' ex-girlfriend shows up with her new boyfriend, making things awkward. After an unexpected terrible event happens a small group of survivors sets out to escape but the lead wants them to find his ex-girlfriend first. Yes, pretty close, isn't it. Like Cloverfield, the first third is really good and creats great expectations. much of the budget must have been spent on the graphics showing the meteors heading for Earth, which look really good. the impact in L.A. with it's smoke, sirens and helicopters looks really good even though we know the smoke and helicopter effects are pretty easy to get online. Still, the total effect with all the confused friends, some worried, some excited like it's all a show, is well done. but then early problems begin to surface which begin to grow once they leave the initial apartment to get a car.

Turner Clay, the writer-director did a gutsy thing setting this in L.A. As all zombie fans by now know, the low-budget thing is to go to the sticks where trees look pretty much the same, zombie apocalypse or not. But he didn't do the sensible low-budget urban zombie thing by having everyone trapped in one apartment, house or whatever (i.e. requiring only one set) but instead turns them loose in one section of L.A. at least between stops in various buildings. But because of his budget, Clay's L.A. is absolutely deserted. Except for the helicopters and a couple newscasters early on, we see one guy in a gas mask ride by on a bicycle, three or four random people running here and there in the early outdoor backgrounds and two people in a parking garage. This is in the first few hours of an urban catastrophe in a city of almost 4 million and a greater metropolitan area population of 17.8 million. He didn't even pull the Fear the Walking Dead ""9 days later"" trick. This is a lot to swallow and he would have had to make a really great film to make me do so. Also, and I kept tab since I had been warned of a low zombie count, there were 8 zombies all told, actually 7, since one was the same one we saw earlier.

This could be enough to kill the deal for some viewers, so just be forewarned. I've sat through a lot worse and in the end it's watchable even though it loses credibility as it goes. MINOR SPOILERS FROM HERE ON. (I can't discuss any more without revealing a few general things). There are many bad decisions made here, though there usually are in zombie movies and the usual excuse is that people actually do make bad decisions, especially in a crisis. But here there are just too many. The decision to drive to the beach then head up the coast is a bad one to begin with because everybody will be doing that (though it could make sense in this films instantly unpopulated L.A.). Of course main character John just has to find his ex, Tori, who at least seems to live closer by than the girl in Cloverfield, which was a truly ridiculous quest.

Not once, but three times, characters needlessly sacrifice themselves to ""save the group"", and this is what most people complain about. They are always being chased by two or three zombies (these are ""Infected"" and thus fast) who they could easily dispatch or even just run from since the zombies aren't that fast. The only thing i can say in defense of this is that each of the sacrificers is despondent and possibly suicidal (Nate lost his girlfriend early on, Adam had been bitten and Turner blamed himself for a friend's death). But at no time was there ever a reasonable need shown for anyone to sacrifice themselves.

The rest is just a pile on from a script that needed more work. When a girl stands in the center of the roadway in a parking garage it's clear that there is plenty of room for the car to swerve around her. No one ever picks up any basic weapons (a found gun runs out of ammo right away and is tossed). They rummage through several apartments but no one picks up any basic weapons like knives, crowbars, hammers or even household or garden implements. They shouldn't be using elevators. When they find the car that was stolen from them just minutes before, they don't even check to see if it still runs because there's a dead guy by it. Then the usual cliches: there's always time for a minutes long heart-to-heart talk between brothers or lovers. And do we really have to have the scene again where someone is standing with their back to a character and won't respond to their name being called until they turn around and ""Gasp!"" they're a zombie.

In the end it seems they were never more than a few blocks from the beach anyway. Once they get there they seem relieved. Are we supposed to think they're safe?",1477008000,,5358,4.517525773195876

8664656,5,B00L9KB61C,Much much better than most indie low budget Zombie films.  The lead looked a bit too much like Will from Will and Grace so I kept expecting some jokes with Jack but the acting was fine.  The first act is the best then it seemed like the dialogue fell apart.  Less is more with the zombie make up.  The alley zombie in the ill fitting rubber mask was comical.  Not sure why they did that.  They had other zombies done up well.  There is a lot of running around parking lots and stair cases but it's not as bad as most indie cheap zombie films.

The acting is terrible, the lead character can't seem to keep a straight face when he's supposed to be emotionally distraught. When running, without sweating or breathing, for their lives against the clock, they stop repeatedly to discuss relationships, give grief counseling, just talk about random things. The characters bypass a running car, which is not in use, to rather keep running for their lives, when they could drive.
In short, this movie stinks in every way a movie can stink, EXCEPT, they did decent camera work, inexplicably... It's like someone's older brother who has a good camera and can use it right, helped the people make this movie. I blame HIM too for his complicity in this nightmare.
