2436715,4,B000BQ7J9I,"ninja turtles was a great cartoon, needless to say the episodes rock. but the dvd is poorly put together. as with the 1st two seasons there are no special features. furthermore this time you don't even get a complete season, only 12 of like 40 eps that were in season 3. i was hoping this time there would be a boxset witht the whole season and special features. but alas i was disappointed yet again. at least this one came out like 6mnths after vol two as apposed to the year that i had to wait between volumes one and two. at least the show is still rocking as ever!!!",1135209600,4,571,4.2
2436716,3,B000BQ7J9I,"I am also thrilled that the episodes have been released. I do not care so much that there are no special features. I just care that the episodes are there.

I am disappointed though that there are just 12 episodes. There are at least 193 episodes in total for the 80's version of the show. Releasing just a few episodes at a time will take forever to get a complete collection. He-Man has recently been released and they are doing around 30 episodes per release. That means there will be just four releases to get the complete series.

I just wish they did something similar with Turtles. Season 4 is ok because that has only 15 episodes anyway. The only other season that has more than 20 episodes is Season 7 which has 27 episodes. So if they could do a massive release next time with the rest of Season 3 that would be fantastic.",1135036800,6,832,4.361290322580645
2436717,5,B000BQ7J9I,"Ok, so this DVD only has the first 12 episodes from season three.  No special features, animated menus, and other features you would find on a TV season DVD.  So what????  The important thing is at least a portion of season three and I think any fan of the old Ninja Turtle series should appericate that at least!  I mean, the studio/s responsible for the old TMNT show's DVD releases DID NOT have to release it.  They could have just stopped at season two or season one (then again they never would have had to release any of the seasons in the first place!)!

So to those who are complaining about the lack of special features, video quality, and whatever else; STOP IT!!!!!  I'm sure the rest of season three will be released eventually on DVD.

Anyway, that being said; I find season three to be my favorate and memorible season!  I can't wait until the rest of season three is released!",1134950400,3,891,4.450617283950617

2436744,5,B000BQ7J9I,"This is a review of the complete season 3 set, not the volume 3 set.  The complete season 3 set is a collection of the previously released volumes 3,4,5, and 6.  This is a great way to get all of those together at a great price, I found my copy for $5 at Walmart and that's a great price for the amount of episodes you get, 48 not the advertised 47.  This is probably one of my favorite seasons next to season 5, it has my absolute favorite episode ""April Fool"" that I had on one of those Burger King VHS tapes that I watched countless times.  If you already have some of the volumes in this collection, like I had 3 and 5, it's still worth it to get this if you're missing a couple of the volumes.  I mean five bucks, that's probably cheaper than tracking down whatever volume you're missing by itself.  This is a fantastic way to start building a collection of the old cartoons if you don't want to spring for the complete series set and a good way to fill in some of the empty spots in your collection.",1452902400,,1005,4.128205128205129

2436788,5,B000BQ7J9I,"In this third and presumably longest season of the entire series, our turtle heroes and all the others go through a lot this time around. Here's a breakdown of some of what to expect out of this collection which really stood out to me. Splinter loses his memory; Krang desperately seeks various resources to keep his Technodrone running; Raphael, well, is just being Raphael; Leonardo falls for a beautiful female ninja; April masquerades as a look-a-like princess; Donatello relives a plot from a classic mystery movie; Bebop and Rocksteady become ninjas themselves, as well as get robo-duplicates of them; Shredder begins acting like Michelangelo; and as for Michelangelo, I'll let you find out what makes him say the words yo never thought he'd actually say: ""I Crave Pizza No More!"" (GASP!) Say it ain't so Mikey, say it ain't so! In addition to what goes on this season, I'd figured I don't forget about newcomers such as the hockey-masked vigilante Casey Jones, or new villains such as Leatherhead or his royal highness of all rats himself, the Rat King. And cheers to the late James Avery (Fresh Prince of Bel-Air) for his fine work for making Shredder a lot more funnier this third season. Kudos! Well I said pretty much all that I wanted to say about this collection. I enjoyed it a lot. But don't take my word for it, I'd highly recommend you add this to your turtles collection if you hadn't already. And keep on kicking it with those turtles!",1409356800,,1454,4.75098814229249

This particular set is comprised of Episodes #19 through #66.

I plan to comment on each episode in future reviews.  I've already talked about Episodes #61 and #62 (please see my VHS review of ""Turtles Vs. The Fly."").  At any rate, this is much too great for cartoon/T.M.N.T. fans to pass up!!  :)",1402358400,4,655,4.6347826086956525

2436821,2,B000BQ7J9I,"There are 47 episodes across 4 dual layered DVD's.  That's just under 12 episodes a disc.  A standard half hour TV show DVD release puts 8 episodes per disc.  That means these episodes have had added compression applied to them.  This reduces the video quality available.  The average size of an episode on these discs is 650 MB.  A standard such release would be around 800 to 900.  The quality could have been increased by adding 2 more discs.

Unfortunately, the third season is when the series started veering more towards comedy and away from the semi-serious tone of season 2.  The comedy focus doesn't really work, though.  While the show would be better known for its comedic elements, it didn't start off entirely that way.  You start getting more and more lame parodies like The Maltese Turtle and 50 Foot Irma.

Due to the decreased video quality, I can't really recommend this release, in combination with the quality of the episodes in the season.",1400198400,,960,4.751515151515152

Least they could have done was remaster the episodes so the video would look a bit better with less artifacts.

""volume 1"" equals season 1.  ""Volume 2"" equals season 2.  So far everything is simple.  A few years back, Season 3 was split up within ""Volume 3"", ""Volume 4"", ""Volume 5"", and ""Volume 6"".  Now, for one fourth of the shelf space of Volumes 3-6 (and probably one fourth of the price too) you can get all of season 3 in just ONE way more organized package.  It's annoying when franchises do these things.  If you didn't buy volumes 3-6 then this is a GREAT buy, but if you did, then it's not worth paying money for this just to make the spines of the collection appear more organized (unless you have OCD).",1377907200,17,651,4.295081967213115

These shows are NOT what I remember, but that's ok - he loves them. The humor is slapstick like a Donny and Marie variety hour. The animation is like throw back Marvel. All the characters are wearing neon clothes with pegged pants and 80s hair (not to mention all the vally-girl-esque language).

But at the same time - none of the villains are scary
The story plots are very easy to follow
There is very little fighting and violence
and you get a lot of episodes for your buck.

If you buy more of these ""season"" DVDs make sure you are getting the complete seasons and not the smaller discs that only have a few episodes. The complete seasons are only a few bucks more (if that!) and have more features. Check the episodes against IMDB if you're not sure.

2436916,4,B000BQ7J9I,"Compared to similar TV shows from the same time period, this one is relatively inexpensive. However, I don't like the new ""volume"" breakdown instead of just giving the seasons. Each season is broken into multiple volumes to maximize profit so there are only a few episodes per disc. This is a frustration that I have with many of these sets as I began collecting the seasons originally from places like bookmans, and then when I couldn't find some of them I moved to amazon to fill the gap and found that I was going to have to switch gears and buy them piecemeal. This seems like a ploy to maximize revenue and confuse consumers.
However, other than that side note, I have to say my 3 year old LOVES this series. He is a big TNMT fan and I have to admit I love watching them with him. Despite the fact that some of the errors are much more noticeable with old school animation on a larger TV screen, there is just no comparison between the new versions of the turtles and these ones. If you watched the TMNT growing up this is a great way to reintroduce yourselves to them and pass them on to your children. No matter how much time passes, they never quite lose their charm.",1354665600,,1175,4.345454545454546

Although this set is treated just like the previous release which was that of all the episodes of Season 2, but Season 3 is one of the longest in the series at around 40 or more episodes that make up this season.  While I'd expect that if that sales of the first two was good enough to bring out starting of Season 3 that they'd would have started a season earlier with the sets or at least with this set have it divided in two sets.  For example like Season 3 Volume 1 containing half of the episodes on a set number of discs, although they continued to go with this route trying to cram 12 episodes on one disc.

I wonder if the people that were in charge of the DVD releases knew anything about their marketing cause so far with 3 Volumes without putting that much effort into making these Volumes worth the overall purchase for the fans.  While it's nice that the first 12 episodes of Season 3 made it onto DVD, while at the same time it may have been nice to have thought of something during the Season 2 release of this series.

Awesome buy, and it's fun for me to watch them again, too...now if they would only bring back the TMNT cereal...",1187740800,,467,4.1208791208791204
2436937,5,B000BQ7J9I,I loved this show when I was a kid and still love it. Even my little brothers love them.,1185235200,,88,3.6842105263157894
2436938,4,B000BQ7J9I,"For a little under $9.00 on Amazon, you can get 12 episodes from the third season. I can't think of a better deal than that. Unlike other shows from the 80s that have lost most of their appeal today, the stories are still interesting and the jokes, while lame, are lame enough to still be funny. The opening sequence with the theme song is just as exciting today as it was when the episodes were originally aired.

Volume 3 contains episodes with Irma becoming a giant, Splinter and Shredder switching bodies, Donatello mimicking Humphrey Bogart for an entire episode, Shredder reversing the effects of gravity, April being mistaken for a princess, and a young kid becoming the ""fifth turtle"". Although the plot setups aren't quite as good as in seasons one and two, they still play nicely to those of us who grew up watching them.

Like the other TMNT Season collections, this DVD has no extras, but really 12 episodes is enough of a treat in itself.",1171843200,6,951,4.654761904761905
2436959,4,B000BQ7J9I,"This is the old series which aired on TV in the eighties. My 22 year old daughter thinks it's great that her seven year old brother is now watching one of her favorite cartoons when she was little! Although he says the turtles in this series ""look like babies"", because he is accustomed to the sleeker, more modern look of the turtles in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles-Fast Forward, which is what is airing on TV now, he nevertheless enjoys the old series and owns volumes 1-4. I consider them money well spent!

I would have given this 5 stars, but the dialogue from the old series is really silly and not as well-written as the more recent 2 series and the movies which were geared to entertain adults as well as little kids.",1168300800,,725,4.451127819548872
2436960,5,B000BQ7J9I,"I really can't remember the episodes as a child, but I do remember that I would sit down to watch the Ninja Turtles; they were my favorite back then and still are now as a teenager. Out of the first three volumes, volume three is my favorite; I find the episodes a bit more entertaining for some reason I can't explain. I enjoyed all twelve episodes, particularly ""The Fifth Turtle"". I recommend this DVD for anyone who wants to sit down, relax, and enjoy a nice set of cartoons.",1167350400,3,479,4.393258426966292
2436961,5,B000BQ7J9I,"I loved this cartoon so much as a kid and now I get to enjoy these DVDs. I know, we're all a little disappointed that the whole seasons aren't being released. I guess there are no plans since they keep putting out the ""best of"" volumes. STILL...it's awesome to have such an amazing series being released, however the format. I'll take as many best ofs they can throw at me! We can't control these companies, so we can make the best of it. 12 is a nice number, and these 12 from season 3 are some of the best of the whole series. Standouts include ""The Old Switcheroo"", when Shredder and Splinter swap places, ""Enter the Rat King"", where Splinter is put under this new villain's control, and ""April Fool"", where April is mistaken for a princess and kidnapped by Shredder who plans to use her for ransom to get a rare diamond. Part of the show's enormous success was due to the extremely likable characters. The turtles, of course all have distinct personalities. Their master,Splinter may not share in their love of pizza but he can whoop up on the foot clan and whip his students into shape, both physically and mentally. Their best friend April O' Neil is one of the best loved tough heroines since She Ra. Even her fellow reporters at Channel 6 are just as important to the series, usually adding comic relief. Check the Rat King episode where lonely desperate for a man Irma insists the Rat King capture her instead of April! Even a maniac will reject Irma, and you can't help but love her. Where is the Irma action figure by the way? As for the villians, the standards are Shredder, Krang, Bebop and Rocksteady, along with an army of foot and rock soldiers. The writing is razor sharp and very clever and the bad guys's constant bickering will keep you in stiches, especially the exchanges between Shredder and the brain-inside an android Krang. In one episode, Krang mentions he doesn't leave the technodrome without his ""alien express card""..LOL! Another cool thing I've always loved is the music! Aside from the theme song, there are nice bits of music that builds up the tension or excitement. The show had a knack for an eerie synth-dramatic sound. It's brilliant. Parents, if you're concerned about the violence, I wouldn't be. Like He Man and the Masters of the Universe, there are messages and lessons to be learned, although not made as blantantly as He Man did at the end of every episode. Aside from the 80's -surfer dude speech of Michaelangelo, the series is not dated at all and is fresh as a brand new pizza. Sink your teeth into these! Keep 'em coming!",1161475200,7,2572,4.593478260869565
2436962,5,B000BQ7J9I,We have here 12 episodes from the classic 80's cartoon. I loved when I was a child and I never miss them. I think this is the best Lions Gate multiple cartoon Dvd having seen Rambo and Speed Racer. The prize is under $15 so also is a good reason to purchase it. I hope Ghostbusters follow this way soon. CTHV take good note of this. I'll wait for the rest of the series.,1148428800,,370,4.013513513513513

2436964,5,B000BQ7J9I,"It's so great that I can now finally watch the episodes as they were ment to be seen, unedited! When the series aired over here in Denmark, we sadlly enough had to put up with the teriblly edited versions of the episodes - the same version which were also shown in the UK!

Finally I can enjoy more unedited episodes from this great show, and I'm really greatful for that! The reason I've given this set 5 stars is for the episodes alone - they're fantastic! I agree with some of the other reviewers though, it would be nice to have comercial bumpers included, and extras like the ""turtle tips"", but hey - the episodes are beeing released, at that is what I'm buying these discs to enjoy most of all!

I do hope they'll keep releasing these. Ad leased one more is coming, namely  volume 4, which will be released on april 4th. of cource I'll buy that one too, and I'd recommend everyone else to do the same thing, so that the intire series ad leased will make  it to  dvd at some point!

2436966,3,B000BQ7J9I,"All in all, I'd say I've become accustomed to high quality box-set releases, so when I realised they're taking their time to release this series one disc at a time, I was a little disapointed... I just feel that the turtles deserved a little better. Also after playing the discs of this series, I was expecting them to clean up the prints a little, but it doesn't seem to have been done. And the opening sequence looks like it's from an old worn-out tape, not the original masters. I'm also disapointed there are no commercial break sequences saying the turtles will be right back.. (RHINO had added those to the G.I. Joe DVDs that they never got to finish, but that's another story..).

I don't care much about bonuses, so considering the low price of the DVDs, I'll say it's ok (there are none). Just above passing grade. It's also not too hard on my paycheck to pay for the series 10$ at a time... It seems they are at least releasing the episodes in order. I just wish they had done a release similar to the HE-MAN box sets.... Now THAT is quality stuff for an affordable price..

I hope when they release The Real Ghostbusters on DVD, they will follow ""Entertainment Rights""'s example and release the series in quality chronological box sets...",1140220800,,1249,4.571428571428571
2436967,5,B000BQ7J9I,"Thank god they released the original Turtles on DVD. The classic 80's series is fantastic, I never get tired of it. I don't mind at all about the lack of special features, just having the episodes released is fantastic, and I am so happy. Been waiting for years. Also we only had to wait 6 months between releases. I am looking forward to the rest of Season 3 to be released, can't wait :)",1135296000,15,389,4.27027027027027
