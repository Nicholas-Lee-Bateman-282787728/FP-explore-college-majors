I like the idea of using 2 sets of weights so you can adjust the level to your liking.  I have been doing this tape every other day for the past 2 months and have very noticable muscle tone in my arms, legs and abs.  You are constantly moving in this tape, so not only do you get a good weight workout, you get great cardio workout as well!  I wish she would have focused more on triceps but I guess that's what the Crunch: Best Arms & Abs tape is for.  I highly recommend this tape!",1011571200,11,589,4.078260869565217
1622901,5,B00005LQ1J,"This is a great video!  It's upbeat, but with very little whooping and hollering.  The moves are not dance oriented, but are fun and interesting.  It's tough to begin with, but since it's only 30 minutes long, you can bear with it (and press pause if you need to!).  One person on the video offers low impact alternatives and you can actually see her and follow her lead.  Many of the moves require balance, and with practice, you'll get that.  Just remeber that developing balance is a part of good fitness, too.  One thing to look out for - the instructor doesn't give many suggestions on form for lunges and curls, but if you already have this knowledge, it's nice not to hear every time you play the video.",1011398400,8,710,4.457364341085271
1622902,5,B00005LQ1J,"I have recently gotten engaged and like many brides want to loose weight and become more tone.  I have gone to the gym for several years and have also tried other videos.  I feel Crunch - Cardio Sculpt is absolute terrific and is the BEST way to accomplish my goal.  Violet, the instructor is fabulous.  She is energetic; extremely knowledgeable, and a wonderful motivator.  The workout is low impact, which tones every part of your body in just 30 minutes.  I also work full time and attend graduate school part time.  With my busy schedule, this workout fits perfectly into my schedule.  I highly recommend it.  You will feel great and notice a difference within days!!",1011052800,57,671,4.7155172413793105
1622903,5,B00005LQ1J,This is absolutely the best 30 minute workout.  The concept of using two different sets of weights allows you to work at your own ability level.  Violet is a great instructor and I hope to see her in more videos.,1011052800,,212,4.275
1622904,5,B00005LQ1J,Violet Zaki has such a positive personna and is an excellent instructor.  Beginners to experienced can do well from this workout since Ms Zaki covers all the bases. I highly recommend it.,1006300800,4,187,4.84375
1622905,5,B00005LQ1J,"I love this video! It's a fantastic combination of solid body strengthening moves with low impact cardio. I also really like that it combines body resistance training as well.
The instructor is so motivational, she keeps you hanging in there, even through that last rep.
This video rates top marks with me because you can pop it in and get a really good overall body workout in just thirty minutes! Perfect when I don't have time to do a big work out, or anytime I need to do some exercise and get the sweat going!",1001548800,12,514,4.421052631578948
1622906,2,B00005LQ1J,I was very disappointed with this being my 6th Crunch video.  The camera cuts away at key moments.

1622911,4,B00005LQ1J,"I have fallen in love with the Crunch workouts, most are easy to follow with no complicated moves and most give you a pretty good workout.  I like a good interval training workout, I'm not crazy about just lifting weights, its boring so this one was a good deal.  The instructor was good with her cues and the bursts in between the strength were challenging enough but not overwhelming.  The workout is a good length, around 30 to 35 minutes and includes a decent (not great) warmup and cool down.  While not my favorite of the Crunch workouts, this one is a good addition to my library and gave me a decent workout.",1367971200,,616,4.424778761061947

1622915,5,B00005LQ1J,"I love this workout!

I first tried this workout when it was available on Netflix. After they removed all of their fitness videos, I was so sad, because I felt like I had finally found the perfect workout for me! I finally decided to just order this DVD so I could get back to working out the way I want to.

This video is about 30 minutes long, including a cool-down, and combines cardio and weight training. It works your arms, abs, legs, gluts, and gets your heart racing. I like that there is scene selection, which obviously was not available on Netflix. There is also a 10 minute buns workout, which I have yet to try (I'll probably give it a go this weekend). I love the trainer, who has a nice voice (and Australian accent!) and she is very encouraging and positive, not harsh, and seems to give helpful reminders at just the right moments. The workout itself is appropriate for beginners but as you develop your strength and skill, I think it would still be quite suitable. They recommend that you use two sets of weights, one set that you consider light, and one that you consider to be a bit heavier, but if you only have one set, that will do just fine. I used to use a set of 3 lb. weights and a set of 5 lb. weights, but I recently moved and no longer have weights in my posession, so I've resorted to using household items, like water bottles or lotion bottles (silly, I know!) until I can repurchase a few sets of weights.

I do this workout 3 times a week, and every time, even without the proper weights, I find myself sweating and sore in the best way. Every time you start nearing the point where you want to give up, the instructor changes the exercise, so it is tough but not torturous. I don't know if this is bad, but I do this workout barefoot since I have thick carpeting in my apartment, and honestly I don't feel like my ankles or feet are being strained or tweaked by the exercises. I used to do this on wood flooring in my previous residence, and wore athletic shoes on that surface, which I would recommend if you also have smooth floors.

The only things I can critique are that: 1) there is no stretching segment at the beginning (but there is a warm-up segment, but that is not the same thing), and 2) there are some jumping moves, which I don't enjoy doing since I live in a third-floor apartment, and it feels rude to do so. One of the background girls demonstrates low-impact alternatives, which I follow along with instead during those portions.

Overall, I highly recommend this workout to anyone looking for a full-body workout, especially to beginners because it is a great place to start. I am not the most athletic person, nor am I typically inclined to be active, but I actually look forward to completing this workout! I couldn't ask for more.",1357862400,3,2788,4.395348837209302

1622921,5,B00005LQ1J,"I use exercise and dance DVD's almost every day, and have found that the Crunch series is the absolute best.  The length of them is usually around 40-50 min., just the right amount of time for my workouts, and this one is as good as the rest.  Instructions are clear, and this one lives up to the rest!",1353110400,,302,4.189655172413793
1622922,2,B00005LQ1J,"I am intermediate/advanced level for exercising, and I would not use this video again.

Pros:
* Violet's personality was tolerable, not fake or over-the-top enthusiastic, just matter-of-fact and calm.
* Uh, that's it.

Cons:
* I barely felt like I had worked out.  Definitely not intense, in spite of what the description indicated.  With a name like ""cardio sculpt"", I expected both elevated heart rate and feeling the burn in muscles, but didn't really get any of either.  This was very low impact.
* Cue-ing was a little late, I missed several moves on the first try because they weren't cue-ed until she was already doing them, or not clearly explained if in advance.
* Although the moves were mostly on beat, they weren't matched smoothly within the phrasing of the music, which made it impossible to establish a rhythm.
* Not enough reps of each move.
* The music was not bad, but combined with all of the above, the video was boring.

""Crunch: Boot Camp Training"" is one of my favorites and I would strongly recommend that one over this for strength/toning.",1336953600,,1064,4.755434782608695
1622923,3,B00005LQ1J,"The only reason I bought this is because Exercise tv was removed from my Video On Demand.  I love the Crunk gym exercises especially the ones led by Michelle
Otterman (or something like that). This one was very inexpensive and now I know why.  The instructor had no direction.  One minute you use hand weights, the next minute she tells you to drop them.  The exercises were quick and i found some of them a little hard to do. This dvd is a bit advanced.  I did it with a friend..after 5 minutes, she stopped because she could not follow the instructor.  As a dance lover, even I had a little challenge following her moves.  She changed moves before giving it a chance to work.  The music was just okay...the typical Crunch Gym music is slamming.  I'm used to hearing hip hop beats with some moves i can't get enough of.  You will not find that in this dvd.  I'm keeping it only because it was so cheap.  If you like good choreography that is organized,this isn't the exercise dvd for you.  Check out Michelle O instead.",1327276800,,1020,4.390374331550802
1622924,4,B00005LQ1J,"I enjoyed this work out a lot.  She is very encouraging and doesn't demean you in any way.  The work out was very good.  I like how she gives you the option of alternating weights.  She did call everyone ""troops"" once and that was cheesy.  I'm not a fan of that.  Personal preference.  I like how she gave a detailed cool down.  Not a lot of videos focus on the cool down.  The warm up requires some coordination and I don't have it.  All in all I enjoyed myself.",1321315200,,463,4.101123595505618
1622925,5,B00005LQ1J,"This is a great overall basic workout that is low-impact and uses light dumbbells.  It's not going to train you for running the marathon, but it covers all the body areas.  I use it for light/maintenance workout days.  It's also fairly short, so great for when you're rushed.  Violet has a wonderful presence -- encouraging and upbeat without being obnoxious.  I like her cueing, too.  I did this workout a number of times on Netflix and finally decided to actually buy the DVD.  Glad I did.  It's a great workout to fill that niche in the workout rotation ... total body, low-impact, time-sensitive.",1320451200,,600,4.757281553398058
1622926,3,B00005LQ1J,"I liked a lot of the combos (i.e. knee lift w/bicep curl, then straighten the leg w/shoulder press) but there wasn't enough repetition to get a good workout.  You could easily use these moves, but do more of them for a better workout.  The 10 minute butt workout at the end was pretty good.  I wil.l probably use these moves in future workouts.",1271203200,,344,4.428571428571429
1622927,2,B00005LQ1J,"Violet is a decent instructor in that she's pleasant and not annoying -- no small feat in the workout arena.  On the other hand, though, she doesn't describe a movement until she's halfway through it, and doesn't allow enough time to catch up before moving on to the next complicated combo.  I was at least a step behind the whole time!  What's more, the workout doesn't flow at all, and wastes a lot of time with ""Pick up your weights.  Put down your weights. Sit down.  Stand up.""  And it wouldn't have been hard for her to make it flow, since most exercises had me moving into the same positions over and over.

The movements Violet asked me to do often seemed to work opposite the natural movement of my body, and I felt at times as though they put my neck and back at risk.  And though I'm experienced in weightlifting and have been working with workout videos of varying styles and levels for months, some combinations were too difficult, others much too easy.  For a better workout, TRY ANY OTHER CRUNCH DVD.  I've done nearly all of them, and they're excellent in general.  This one doesn't even belong in the same class.",1269820800,3,1129,4.485294117647059
1622928,1,B00005LQ1J,"This video is the worst in the Crunch series. I have most of the Crunch workout DVDS and I love them. However, this DVD is hard to follow and I don't feel like I worked out at all. Violet doesn't cue very well. I bought this DVD because I wanted something that would give my an entire body a workout, especially my arms. This hasn't happened. I am not happy with this DVD and do not recommend this to anyone.",1252627200,4,408,4.1125
1622929,4,B00005LQ1J,This is a great workout to tone up your muscles while adding in a little cardio.  The cardio itself is light but in combination with using the weights it makes for a good overall workout.,1219363200,,187,4.3428571428571425
1622939,4,B00005LQ1J,"This is the only DVD of Violet Zaki I have. It works well when I want an ""all round"" workout but not over-working too many areas. You can always modify a workout, which Violet includes throughout this whole routine.",1193875200,,215,4.538461538461538
1622940,5,B00005LQ1J,"I really love this workout- Violet Zaki is a great instructor- one of my favorites(I also love Ellen Barnett in the self DVD's, and Janis Saffel's kickboxing routines). Violet's motivating with out being annoying, and really knows how to combine sets so that you don't get bored, get a great workout, and actually enjoy it! While I like her self videos slightly better(just because they are set on the beach vs inside)I still really love this DVD. You get alot of great moves for arms, shoulders, hips, legs, butt, and abs. I certainly feel it the next day but I still feel motivated to use it again for my next scupting session. Plus I love that there are like 10 women doing this routine with her one of which you'll relate to- I highly recomend this DVD!",1189382400,,757,4.532846715328467

It has a lot of rather complex moves that need time (for me, at least) to learn and between the level of difficulty and my own personal level, I decided to concentrate on the Pilates cardio DVD I also purchased rather than a straight Cardio workout (actually, I purchased this thinking it WAS a Pilates-Cardio workout by mistake).",1162512000,2,507,4.404255319148936

The middle section of the workout gets you burning & sweating a bit, but i like that its easy enough to follow. im never one to do a step class, or areobics class at the gym, b/c i hate the feeling of not being able to follow. this goes fast enough to work out, but she explains it well & you get the hang of it quickly!

1622966,5,B00005LQ1J,"This video is led by Violet Zaki, and falls just shy of 29 mins (Warm up and cardio sculpt segments combined). Then, there is a cool down of about 5 minutes, which I usually omit, since I cool down on my own.

You will need weights for this workout; anywhere from 3-10lbs, one 'light' pair and one 'heavy'. This workout may not be ideal for people who have balance issues, as you do a lot of exercises supporting yourself on one leg, while the other is working. It can take some getting used to.

One exercise entails placing one leg forward and doing 3 standing hamstring curls with the other, then transferring your body weight back and lifting the front leg, knee bent. At the same time, you are holding weights, which are then brought up in a shoulder press and then down to a biceps curl as your front leg lowers back to the floor. It might sound a bit complicated, but the shoulder press/biceps curls actually follow the movement of your leg (knee up, shoulder press-- leg down, biceps curl). You of course later switch and repeat the process on the opposite leg.

Another exercise is a squat, wider stanced than normal as you hold a pair of heavy dumbbells criss crossed between your hands. As you squat, you do a biceps curl with the weights, and then raise your arms as you come up from the squat to do a french press for your triceps before lowering your arms and lowering back into the squat.

There are also a lot of lunges in this video, both rear and front. During some of these, you hold the lunge while you do various arm exercises with whichever weight is required. You do front shoulder raises (single and double arm) in one series. In another, you do side arm raises which transition to a hammer curl.

In another segment, you are on the floor, feet flat on the ground, hands positioned under your shoulders, fingers facing towards your heels as you support your body weight (hips and back are off the floor). You then raise/lower yourself in a triceps dip. Raising your hips higher, you remain in this position while extending one leg straight in front of you, raising it for 3 counts and lowering it for 1. You then switch legs. That series is a bit tough.

Most of the exercises you do, you can adjust your level slightly, if need be. (For example, if you don't want to do a jump/hop and would rather merely do a side step.) There is a lady off to Violet's immediate left who does modifications on the exercises which require it.

Also in this video you do some standing ab work, as well as ab work while on the floor.

It's a good workout and Violet shows you each exercise before you actually execute it. With a little patience, you should get the hang of things in no time, even if you are a little wobbly when it comes to some of the one legged balance type exercises. Just remember to tighten your core and focus on your form and you should be fine.",1146960000,2,2876,4.392857142857143

What I really love is the 10 minute buns segment at the end.  Most times, I do the 10 minute buns immediately after Cardio Sculpt to feel like I did an intense 45 minute workout, but on some days when I lack the time or motivation, I do the 10 minute buns by itself to feel guilt-free (it will be the longest 10 minutes of your life!).

1622997,4,B00005LQ1J,"This is a very creative workout.  There's cardio in between upper and lower body, abs, and an bonus glutes section.

This isn't a traditional gym style workout of doing one exercise at a time.  Most of the exercises are done in combinations, i.e. squats into bicep curls, lateral raises and hammer curls done in lunge position.  This is by no means the first and only workout that does combinations, but the secret that makes this workout fun is the exercises that are chosen to be combined together, making each combination smooth and fun to do.  One example is to lunge, pulse, pivot both feet 90 degrees, squat, pivot back to lunge position, and pulse.  That's the gist of that combination.  Sometimes I feel like I'm doing choreographed weight training, which is a cool concept because choreography is fun.  The creativity in combinations such as this is unique and therefore refreshing.

Since this workout is only 30 minutes, each combination is done too fast, so there's no time to work the muscles to fatigue.  So why can't I just add more weight?  I get annoyed when a lunge is done into a lateral raise.  Lower body and upper body require different weights, so doing lunges with lighter weights feel useless, but I can't use heavier weights because I'm doing lateral raises after the lunges.  That's the main beef I have with doing combination exercises.

The cardio is okay.  They are simple hi/lo and kickboxing.

Overall, this is a fun workout.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is creative and different.  The tough factor wasn't very high but it was pretty fun.",1102982400,7,1586,4.768382352941177

Though it might not seem like there's a whole lot of cardio, you can  accomplish a good bit in 30 min - it's all in how hard you push yourself.  The instruction is good, the routines/intervals well designed, and by increasing the amount of weight you can really get your heartrate going.  Perhaps there is not as much cardio challenge as I would like, so I combine this workout with another 30 min one.

If you are advanced, you may find that you will grow out of this video rather quickly. But if you are a beginner, or a moderately fit person, or getting into the workout scene just recently, this is the ideal tape for you. I am moderately fit, although not very strong, and I found that this helps work and strengthen my muscles, and fulfill that cardio work suggested by many fitness experts.
The instructor is fun and energetic - I enjoy watching her and working out alongside her instructions (upbeat and encouraging, not overbearing or intrusive). The group in the background is also pleasant and friendly looking, the music is non-intrusive and enjoyable. The instructor takes you through exercise that work your whole body, esp the abs at the end, brings up your heart rate and allows you to cool down all in 35-40 minutes - I enjoy it alot and really wish there was an additional 5-10 minutes (that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5)

The program was easy to follow after using a few times and I definitely worked up a sweat and felt the burn. I was addicted to the exercise, and sometimes used it 3 times a day. I had never been one to exercise, and that caused some problems. There are a lot of lunges in the video, which seemed to bother my knees. The biggest problem for me was the use of weights. I had never used them before and started off with 3 lbs. I forced my body and ended up getting hurt. After only 2 weeks, I had to stop as both elbows were in pain. I ended up having tennis elbow in both elbows and had to endure 2 months of physical therapy.
I still recommend the CRUNCH video...I wish that I had been educated about using a workout video as a beginner. I overdid it with the weights and frequency. Start off slow and PLEASE modify your movements as a beginner. Listen to your body!",1074470400,2,1037,4.113300492610837

1623035,3,B00005LQ1J,"Having read the reviews on the Amazon sight, and having never purchased a Crunch video before, I was really looking forward to doing this workout. However, I must say I was slightly disappointed. Having done the workout I am still not convinced that you can effectively work all the major msucle groups in just 30 minutes. The instructor moved from one segment to another quickly, and I didn't feel that each muscle group had been worked effectively. She just seemd to touch on each group of exercises,and just as you got the hang of the sequence it was over! If you don't want to build up your thigh muscles then don't get this video as alot of the standing work is based on lunges.
If this video was just 15 minutes longer I think it would have been more effective. Yes, I realise we all want a workout that we can fit into our day, and that doesn't take huge amounts of our time, but I'm not convinced this 30 minutes will produce the effective results it claims.
I also thought the constant changing from light to heavier weights was slightly unnecessary (based on the exercises the weights were being used for).
In my mind, if you want an effective video that really works your muscle groups in as little time as possible, I have still not found anything better than Karen Voights fitness videos. When you have finished working out with her 30-45 minutes videos, you really feel as though you have worked your body. Unfortunately I did not feel that with this video.",1046390400,3,1471,4.554716981132075
1623036,4,B00005LQ1J,"This is a pretty good body-sculpting workout, including a quick warm-up and cool-down in the 35 minutes. It alternates between weight lifting and short bouts (just a few minutes at a time) of cardio without weights.  You workout your whole body: abs, arms, legs, buns, etc.  There is an extra bun-toning segment on this dvd, which is a real burner!
If you have the picture-in-picture feature on your TV, then you can watch something else while having the workout in the smaller screen.  That is something I have been able to do and it makes the time go faster.  The workout is pretty easy to follow and naturally repetitious, which makes it easy to get a hang of.  If you want to get more out of it, then you add to the amount of weight you are lifting. They recommend you have 2 weights (say 5 lbs each) and one heavier weight for a few of the exercises.
The instructor is helpful and isn't overbearing in her encouragement.  I have a few of the other Crunch videos, and they always have a good atmosphere along with a good group of people that are exercising along with you. This is a good video to do on alternate days; it doesn't really fill the cardio realm of exercise, it being mostly slow movement with weights.

She squeezes in a variety of lunges and squats anywhere she can. I really look forward to ending my workout with Violet as her work-out is very well put together and flows nicely.
