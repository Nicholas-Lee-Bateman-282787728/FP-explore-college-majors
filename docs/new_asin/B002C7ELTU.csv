3904656,4,B002C7ELTU,As soon as it comes on you get a BRUTAL scene which kinda sticks with you I wish more directors were that bold. The movie it self is decent with lots of scares better than most. Its low budget but the movie is interesting enough that you won't notice. If it had more money attached i wouldnt mind a theatrical wide release.,1269043200,,323,4.225806451612903

3904658,2,B002C7ELTU,"Frayed started off well. The movie feels like a low budget Halloween type movie with a disturbed young boy and a brutal assault of a parent. The boy is then sent away to an asylum. Sounds like Halloween up to this point..Unfortunately, poor plot twists and wooden acting mar the second half of the movie and I found myself tired, disappointed, bored and a little annoyed by the time Frayed came to its conclusion. At one point I was so bored I literally pinched a loaf in my shorts. And I can honestly say that has NEVER happened before.",1262995200,,537,4.434343434343434
3904659,5,B002C7ELTU,"I saw this one in the video store, and paid little mind to it my first two or three visits.  But when I ran out of titles to choose from that sounded or even looked appealing, I rolled my eyes, scoffed, and reluctantly pulled this one from its dusty and untouched place on the shelf.  The goofy cover with the clown make-up and the ""typical"" horror-movie teen was the main reason why I passed this by time and again...but little did I know, this was to be one of the most suspense-filled, well-done horror flicks I'd ever had a chance to experience. Other reviewers have touched on the plot, the terribly gory scene at the beginning (not blood-gore, but brutality-gore), and the twisty-twist at the end, so I won't bore you with repetition and monotony; however, I will be glad to recommend this movie to you as one with all of the above plus a clear understanding that everyone involved with its production were putting their ALL into the project. This flick is exceedingly better than the vast majority of the Hollywood, big-dollar, horror movies out there. ""Frayed"" makes it perfectly clear that you don't need a big budget, a bunch of hype, top-billed actors and actresses, and Hollywood-induced special effects, to produce an outstanding and suspenseful presentation.
FIVE STARS!!! *****

The opening gets things moving fast.  After which things move to a crawl and slowly start to pick up a decent pace.  But there is a good story and the character development keep us involved and caring.

3904663,4,B002C7ELTU,"Frayed begins in 1994, with an innocent looking video of a child's birthday celebration. We see family and guests engaged in typical, lighthearted games indoors and out. But as we continue to watch, it is with the creeping suspicion that all is not what it seems in this family. At one point, unprovoked, Kurt (the oddly dour birthday boy) slaps at his dad with his new baseball bat and shows no remorse for his behavior.

Later in this sequence, we follow Kurt into the house. Uncertain about what the focus of the story will be, we are not prepared for the events that quickly unfold. Soon the film makes good on its promise of an act that is more than horrific--and it is presented in a sustained frame, so you are not allowed the respite of a cutaway or looking from a different angle. [Note the warning on this site: The violence is graphic.] It is an act brutal enough to thrust Kurt and his family--led by his father, Pat Baker, who is the town sheriff--into a nightmare from which they will never emerge.

Kurt is sent to a psychiatric hospital, where he remains into adulthood. Sheriff Baker begins the arduous task of picking up the pieces of his life in the aftermath of this profound and traumatic event. Gradually the community comes to terms, and life goes on for thirteen years.

The news that the adult Kurt has escaped from the hospital sends shock waves through the town. Sheriff Baker prepares for the worst, and a hospital security guard, Gary, sets off to find Kurt before he crosses paths with any of the locals. Meanwhile Baker tries to reach his daughter, Sara, who has taken off to the woods on a camp-out with friends. In a twist of fate, Kurt becomes aware of Gary's efforts and begins tracking him with murderous intent, leaving plenty of collateral damage.

Frayed takes inspiration from (and pays homage to) many classic films in the psycho killer sub-genre, but its narrative avoids clichs and has a driving force all its own. The style fuses the momentum of stalk and slash with the eerie physical beauty of more ghostly horror films.

There are several dramatic twists, but the story is so well constructed that none of these manages to derail the plot. With each development a deeper level of the story is revealed, until the final scene delivers one great slap that knocks theory and jaded expectation right out of the viewer. Lazy audience members might scratch their heads, but if you've been paying attention, the pay-off is terrific. Even if you figure out part of the conclusion with the clues scattered throughout, you won't guess how it all fits together until the very last moment.

Believable and committed acting from the entire cast adds plausibility. Tony Doup, Aaron Blakely and Jeanette Maus deserve special mention for their standout contributions.",1251763200,18,2798,4.758762886597938
3904664,4,B002C7ELTU,"The really brutal gory scene happens in like the first 15 minutes of movie.  And it is GORY!!  I'm a die hard horror fan but it definitely made my stomach turn.  After that a regular horror movie, some twists.
It was a good movie, it has a good concept of troubled kid kills his mom and is sent to an mental asylum.  They really aren't equipped to deal with his anger after 10 years so they decide to move him to a high security facility.  He gets away and mayhem ensues.  It definitely had a few twists in the end  I wasn't expecting and I have heard it is being banned in the UK so grab this while you can.",1251504000,12,608,4.016666666666667

A small town sheriff's worst nightmare comes true when his homicidal son escapes from a psychiatric hospital. An intense manhunt ensues as the dark secret behind the son's evil past becomes revealed.

Review - 2/5
The film starts off with a brutal bang that got my hopes up. A very violent and graphic scene of a woman getting beat in the face by a baseball bat. After that it's downhill. Come to find out the twist ending means the whole film never really happened. It was all imagined by the son. So why is this a film again? It was beyond ridiculous. It's useless to even view this once. Not only is the acting pretty bad but the film is just an imagination. The clown wasn't real, nothing was..... What a waste of time. Come on! Stop putting useless twist in horror films.",1396915200,,788,4.397260273972603

3904667,4,B002C7ELTU,"<strong>Frayed</strong> (Norbert Caoili and Rob Portmann, 2007)

I tend to be a little obsessive about movie-watching when I get going. In the period from September 4 through September 6, I watched a total of ten films, ranging from the horrific to the pretty-darned-good. Of the lot, <em>Frayed</em> was my favorite (by a bare nose over <em>Hanna</em>). Sure, there's not much new under the sun here, and you'll probably see the two Big Reveals at the end coming a mile away (though the movie's final shot, which comes just after Big Reveal #2, is an even nastier twist of the knife than was the true ending of <em>The Descent</em>, which was so depressing it was excised from the American theatrical release...), but here's something I don't often say: this formula has been done a lot recently, and <em>Frayed</em> does it as well as anyone else has, and better than a lot of higher-profile flicks that cover much the same territory (I'm looking at you, <em>Perkins' 14</em> and <em>Basement Jack</em>).

Plot: years ago, a policeman's son, Kurt (played as a child by Jimmy Castle in his first screen role and as an adult by Dino Moore, the movie's PA), a nasty, bullying little piece of work, was put away for the murder of his mother after he was sent to his room for bad behavior at his sister's birthday party. Now it's the present, his sister is in high school, his father (<em>Life or Something Like It</em>'s Tony Doupe) is the Chief of Police, and everything goes to hell when Kurt escapes from the hospital. One of the hospital guards, Gary Jordan (<em>We Need to Talk About Kevin</em>'s Aaron Blakely), is pursuing Kurt, who may be headed home to reprise his role with the new (well, new since he got sent up, anyway) stepmom Jolene (<em>Highway</em>'s Kellee Bradley), or he may be after his sister Sara, now all grown up and gorgeous (<em>Kabuki Mono</em>'s Alena Dashiell). Needless to say, they're on opposite sides of town, Gary's only one guy, and Chief Pat seems more concerned with covering up the escape than actually hunting his kid down...

Here's a hint: this is not a turn-your-brain-off slasher film. I've seen many, many message board comments and questions about things that make perfect sense as long as you paid enough attention to figure out the three key shots at the end that explain everything. But if you miss the significance of one or more of those three shots (without going into spoiler territory: the picture, the family in the kitchen, and the bedroom), you weren't following closely enough, which makes the impact of the final shot nonexistent (and without the impact of the final shot, this really kind of is a turn-your-brain-off slasher flick). They tell you <em>everything</em>, including the one thing I haven't seen a single person mention: what triggered the entire chain of events that movie's built on. That's extremely important, and no one says anything about it at all. (It's also THE spoiler for the film, so I'm not going to say what it is, but I'm going to let you know that it does exist, and it's contained in the film.)

One last thing: the opening sequence ends with the killing of Kurt's mother, a scene that is quite brutal (it has been compared to the similar opening-sequence-ending murder in Gaspar Noe's <em>Irreversible</em>). While the rest of the film never even comes close to that level of brutality (nor its special effects budget), those with weak stomachs might want to stay away, or fast-forward about two minutes when the action cuts from the birthday party to Sara's bedroom. I've seen more than one comment from people who turned the movie off at that point. *** ",1317168000,,3643,4.831730769230769
3904668,2,B002C7ELTU,"While I found the film to be technically competent and have decent production values for a low-budget horror film, the basic plot of ""Frayed"" was too derivative of ""Halloween"" to be very enjoyable. A forced triple-twist ending, which employs two of the most overused cliches of the genre and undermines the story's internal logic, does nothing to redeem the end product.

It's also a little sad that it took five screenwriters to create such a painfully unoriginal story. The co-directors have potential, and I'd like to see what they could do with some original material.",1307836800,,572,5.021052631578947
3904669,4,B002C7ELTU,"This movie has its highs and low points.
I must agree with the description, of one of the most horrific, bludgening, quenching scenes in cinematic history. Which is one of its few highlights.

THE GOOD
the premise alone, is not new, but I like where it was headed.
storyline stayed on point and never deterred.
clear understanding of the concept the director was trying to portray.

THE BAD
film quality- mixed reaction on this one, b/c the quality (whenever the entire frame wasn't pitch black, was of good quality)
too much dark/black out frames/scenes with only audio.

THE UGLY
n/a

CONCLUSION
ITS WORTH A BUY, the reason(s) I would recommend
the behind the scenes, making of, commentary bonuses lays much needed insight, for reasoning.
the ending- a twist, that wasn't detectible. The ending was let down, but the scene prior to the ending, was remarkable (in order to clear things that occured in the beginning)

1 of the finest Direct to DVD films.",1297036800,4,955,4.8343558282208585
3904670,2,B002C7ELTU,"The movie would have been better if the actors weren't so wooden in their performance.  The sister was the worst of the lot in my opinion.  I was wanting her to be killed off so my suffering would end.  The movie was interesting in some parts, I liked the way the killer concealed himself.  But aside from that it was fairly pathetic.",1290124800,2,334,4.338709677419355
3904671,4,B002C7ELTU,"I went into this movie expecting the typical direct-to-video slasher fare; I was somewhat intrigued by the warning about ""one of the most brutal scenes ever put on film"", but other than that I figured the best I could hope for was a decent retread of an old formula.

From the get go, I wasn't disappointed in this belief; you've seen this before. The comparison to ""Halloween"" is obvious almost from the outset, and you get reminded a LOT of another, more recent European slasher that I won't name so as not to give anything away. Suffice to say, I was certain I had the plot figured out before the movie had reached the one-third mark, and while I thought the production values, cinematography, and acting were way above par for a low-budget outing like this, I still wasn't overly excited...it was formula, pure and simple (although the supporting role of ""Veronica"", featuring Tasha Smith was very easy on the eyes; a poor man's Megan Fox, but I digress).

Then, in the last reel...yes! I was vindicated (yawn) in my belief of what was going on and how the plot would unfold...

But then...

I was floored...the ending that I had deduced (and was completely correct about) still wasn't the ending that I thought it would be. The movie rolled on for several more minutes, revealing one of the best plot twists(actually SEVERAL plot twists, all contributing as a whole) I have seen in quite some time. I have to say, the filmmakers, like Romero and Hooper in the past, have no desire to make you feel better at the end...I for one felt very uncomfortable with the ending of this film, and that impresses me the most.

I say that anyone interested in horror films or mysteries should check this one out...I would rent before you buy (as I said, 95% of the film is nothing you haven't seen before) but the end totally justifies the path you take to get there.

As for me, I'm buying it. This is one I'll enjoy watching again.

(And yes...the ""brutal"" scene in question IS very, VERY brutal, both in circumstance and execution...not for the squeamish.)",1283990400,2,2051,4.618131868131868
3904672,2,B002C7ELTU,"Story is about a kid in 1994 goes nuts and kills his mother, then 14 years later he escapes the mental hospital... maybe Micheal Myers fans might enjoy this ""alternate"" version of that story, but I got sick of it because, well, I dunno about anyone else who see's this movie, but I picked out what was really happening very early on in the movie, and just kept rolling my eyes around wanting to fast forward things when it tried to make use of a ""once you've seen this movie, you will have to watch this part again to make sense of it"" but it failed to do so with me, as I predicated it within the 1st 10 minutes, and just found it pretty lame that they stretched it out for nearly 2 hours to climax on the obvious.

I dunno, it may just be me, but I thought it was just a rip off of Halloween and tried to be smart about a twist for the ending, but just displayed a pretty poorley constructed twist that is seen coming from a mile away.... oh the ""most brutal scene ever shown on film"", on film maybe, but on VHS/DVD/TV?

The ending of FRAYED is genuinely disturbing. Don't let this one get away...",1278115200,2,482,5.113924050632911
3904674,3,B002C7ELTU,"If this were the first time we'd seen a movie like this it might be half way decent. And I would have thought that after the ""Scream"" series, which lampooned this genre of flicks, they'd just plain stop. No such luck.

Here we have yet another ""Halloween"" rip-off. The producers justify (or try to justify) this re-make by a rather clever twist in the plot. Yes the twist is rather clever but the ride still isn't worth the fare. Here a young boy goes whacko at his sister's birthday party and kills mom. He heads off to an institution where he stays for the next 15 years. He never utters a word but draws a lot of disturbing pictures. Neither sis nor dad (who has since remarried) has visited him. The authorities figure to transfer him because there's nothing they can do for him. (It took them 15 years to figure that out?) Of course the transfer goes south. People die, junior dons a mask ( I guess it's a law that you need some kind of mask if you want to kill people in the movies), heads home to wreck some more havoc and everyone is in peril.

Some of the directing here is rather good and helps move this tired dog forward. But the acting is universally lackluster. The dad acts as though he's in a coma, and everyone else just isn't that good. There are some really inane pop songs peppered throughout which, I guess, are supposed to remind us we're dealing with young adults here. I guess they didn't have enough trump to come up with real songs.

I was pretty certain I saw the twist coming and I was glad I was correct. It helped me justify the time I'd spent watching this.

I did give this 3 stars but it's really more like 2 and a half. If you're a hard core fan of this sort of thing, you may want to add this to you collection. But if you've had enough, don't bother.",1277078400,2,1786,4.2441176470588236

8363432,4,B002C7ELTU,"Frayed is a very interesting horror/psychological horror film. It has a lot going for it including several twist and some good gore scenes. The beginning murder is probably one of the most graphic Iv seen in horror. It will disturb you,  yet you will find yourself wanted to go back and rewatch it wondering how they pulled it off. It looks that real.
Beyond that the film has a intelligence to it that we just don't see much today. It's cleverly written to throw the viewer off but yet, if you pay close attention, the clues to what is happening are all there and if you payed close attention to the film, you should be able to figure out most of it by the end. However, with that said, a lot of people come away from this film confused and not understanding the whole thing.
Basic plot is that a child  attacks and kills his mother for no apparent reason. They send the child away to a mental institution were, after 10 years, he escapes. During his escape he kills one guard and injures another one outside. When the guard comes to, he realizes he is being stalked by the killer and a cat and mouse game begin.
Iv seen a lot of reviews were people call this a Halloween knock off. I have to wonder if they watched the whole film. Yes, the beginning does resemble the beginning of Halloween, but thats were it ends. Once the killer escapes, the film takes on it own form with a truly disturbing ending. A very underrated film and I hope more horror fans find their way to it!",1446422400,2,1477,4.328519855595668

The first twist was incredibly predictable. The second was quite disturbing but felt like a cheat because it wasn't as if it revealed something surprising about a LIKEABLE character. Or even a particularly sympathetic one. The third twist jumped the shark entirely. Also, the scenes with the young people (with the DREADFUL and hard-to-believe-those-dudes-would-listen-to-it-even-to-score songs by the man who also cut the film together digitally and is WAY full of himself in the interview) jarred against the tone of the rest of the film. Finally, the look of the killer was laughable. Yeah, it was supposed to be scary from a child-like point of view but it looked like something out of a third-rate Slipknot tribute band. HOWEVER, the sequence where someone discovers a hidden crawlspace filled with insane child's drawings and keepsakes was very well-done. Chilling, even. Too bad the rest couldn't decide what it wanted to be and seemed to think the viewer wants to spend chunks of time watching and listening to two teenage girls whine and lie and complain.",1397001600,,1209,5.237113402061856
