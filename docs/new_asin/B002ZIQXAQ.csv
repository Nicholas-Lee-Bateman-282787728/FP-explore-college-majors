8385088,5,B002ZIQXAQ,"Forget the books...this DVD will only take 50 minutes of your time.  Whether you just graduated college and seeking that first job, or a seasoned professional this DVD will help.  I'm 43 and have held 3 positions in my career.  There are a lot of tips here that will help you with your interviews.  A lot of these I knew and this helped as a refresher, but I was surprised about how many I didn't think of.  The material  is organized very well.  It's easy to follow along and take notes.  I'm one that learns best by hearing AND seeing the information. I found the video to contain essential information to prepare for a successful interview. I thought the price was right at $25.  Even being on unemployment I could spend that much.",1264377600,,734,4.458646616541353
