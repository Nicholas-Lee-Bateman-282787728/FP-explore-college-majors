The movie was made from book that is titled ""The light in the forest"". The movie refelcts the book the book but leaves out some of the seens and characters.",1049846400,,268,4.38

860511,5,6304400780,"I remember reading this in 4th grade, but I completely forgot what the novel was. Recently, I started a project that I wanted to buy/own every Disney movie. I searched this and when it came up it seemed familiar. I clicked onto it and read the description and just like that all of a sudden I remembered :D  I'm so glad I remember what the book is now so I can get it and read it on my kindle. It's been ages since I read/watched the movie because we ended up and watched it in the class afterwords. I wish they made this in dvd/blu-ray format though vhs is so outdated",1296777600,,569,4.126126126126126
860512,4,6304400780,"This 1958 Disney film features a wonderful cast, including two recently departed actors, Fess Parker and James MacArthur. It tells the story of a young white man who had been adopted by Indians as a child. Because of treaty obligations, he is forced to rejoin white society. His readjustment is difficult, despite the love interest he has in the character portrayed by Carol Linley. The plot is a bit formulaic, but if you like the look and feel of the 1950s Disney films, (and I do) you will enjoy this film. Seeing Fess Parker and James MacArthur perform is always a pleasure. Jessica Tandy and Joanne Dru also star.",1295395200,,618,4.678899082568807
860513,4,6304400780,"We bought this movie both for a local historical interest (we live in the area in which it was set) and because we have been collecting G rated movies from our youth. I was somewhat surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  Despite being a family movie, it is a reasonably accurate portrayal of the issues confronting both the colonists and the Indians in the mid 1700s without the politically correct whitewashing we would get today (there are bad guys on both sides). A good, solid, family film. It is also interesting to see James MacArthur (Dan-o of Hawaii Five-O) early in his career.",1255996800,,584,4.615384615384615
860514,4,6304400780,"After reading the book, I was overjoyed to go to my local library to borrow the movie for this. I was disappointed how most of the scenes that ties to the theme were cutted off.

860717,2,6304400780,"I watched this movie in school after reading the book. If you're looking for a good movie that's fairly loyal to the book, then do NOT watch this movie, but if you're looking for an old movie that's so bad it's funny, watch it! The movie is dramatic, cliche, and poorly done, but because of that it's funny. True Son falls in love with a blonde servant. Half Arrow, his best friend, is an overly excited Indian with a strong Spanish accent. Yeah, that's Disney for you! It's terribly amusing, though not worth buying (unless you're getting it as a white elephant present for someone).",1092009600,,584,4.571428571428571
860718,3,6304400780,"If you were born in the 1960's or before, you might enjoy this sweet, simple Disney tale of young love and the wilderness.  Today's youth, however, will find it a snooze.  MacArthur and Lynley are beautiful and display great promise.",1058745600,,233,4.8
860719,1,6304400780,"The Light in the forest the movie was awful. I loved story line but it was made unprofeshinally and un real. It was like watching a kindergardners play (which I would enjoy much more.)The book was made with a spirit of passion by Conrad Richter but the movie toke that passion and obviously changed it into a heap of garbage.
  The movie is about True Son a boy who has lived among the indians for many years and now must go back home to his real white family. The boy is lost between his two sided heart now he must make a decision.
  If I were to compare this to a rollercoaster ride of your mind it would be a rollercoaster going no where.",1050019200,,642,4.153225806451613
860720,2,6304400780,"I saw this movie at school. It was okay. It had a lot of action.
I have read the book though. Thats why I like the movie. I don't think I would like if I hadn't have read the book. The thing about it is that it's old and not as cool as the new and imporved movies. It doesn't have all the things that movies have these days. These are teh things that I liked about the movie. I liked the action and fights that it had in it. I also liked the cool indian characters. I also like the cool outdoor setting of the movie. The video is a lot like the novel. It has some new characters and some of the same. But some characters that I think were very important went even in the video. I wish they were. The ending is very exciting. And thats all i have to sayy about that. If you like boring movies than this is DEFINITLY the one for you. Believe i have read the book and seen the movie...",1050019200,,882,3.9055555555555554
860721,3,6304400780,"The film The Light in The forest was exactly what you would expect in a Disney film. No gore no real fighting, if your an action movie lover then this is the worng flick for you. After reading the novel by Conrad Richter, Diney literally trashed this book. Changed everything besides a few things. Also if you like movies true to the book, skip this one.",1050019200,,354,4.378787878787879
7869708,5,6304400780,The movie was really enjoyable. I knew that I would be getting my money's worth. It arrived quickly. I thought that this story was so interesting since it depicts events that really did occur at that time. A great watch for the entire family!,1448841600,,242,4.5227272727272725

7869710,4,6304400780,"My mother loves this movie and couldn't find it on DVD. Apparently Disney considers this movie an educational program, they label it a classroom edition. If you go to www. DisneyEducation.com you can purchase this movie as a DVD for $19.99.",1423094400,,240,4.878048780487805

7869713,5,6304400780,"One of the better Disney live-action films
from the 50's. That as yet to be release on dvd. Why is it taking so long?",1416096000,,117,3.9166666666666665
7869714,4,6304400780,"This good ""Disney Style"" move starred James MacArthur as a ""white man"" raised by Native Americans of the Delaware Tribe.  He is a baby when the Delawares kidnap him and is thus raised as a warrior.  As a young man he considers himself to be a warrior and is unfamiliar and reluctant to search his ""white man's ways"".  He is reluctant to meet his biological parents and is befriended by Del hardy (Fess Parker of Davy Crockett fame).  ""True Son"" (the Native American name for Johnny) falls in love with a ""white girl"" who is an endentured servant.  True Son thus decides to join the ""white mans world"" but finds it is too unfamiliar and not to his liking the ways of the White Civilization and thus returns to his tribe.
This movie is based on ""The Light In the Forest"" novel by Conrad Richter.  Though the book is better than the movie, this is a good movie though ""Disney Style"".  Made in 1958, this movie has the traditional Disney feel but it does have some good drama and is not as ""hokey and far fetched"" as other Disney historical movies.  This would be a great movie to introduce elementary and junior high schools to Colonial American History and Native American History. Hpefully it will be re-issued on DVD sometime soon!

Thoroughly enjoyed the movie. They don't make them like this anymore. Characters and storyline were the emphasis back then. Now it's all CGI, explosions, minimal deep meaning character interaction, and fluff.",1381968000,2,324,4.890909090909091
