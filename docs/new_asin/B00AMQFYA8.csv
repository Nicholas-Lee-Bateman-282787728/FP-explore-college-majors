8554084,5,B00AMQFYA8,"I very much enjoyed watching this interview of Neil Sedaka. I am an older long-time fan of his music who remembers hearing his hit ""Calendar Girl"" back in the early 60's. A few years ago I saw him ""live"" in concert and enjoyed the show. This interview touches on his childhood and early years when he first started playing the piano and then it proceeds with how he got started in the professional music business before continuing through the milestones of his career. It's a great inside look at the man behind the music. He is truly a national treasure!",1458518400,,555,4.56
