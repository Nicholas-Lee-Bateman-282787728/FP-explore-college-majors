8098793,5,B000CFMSO4,this is defiantly a good anime keeper for a collection.,1425945600,,55,4.6
8098794,4,B000CFMSO4,"I got this in a few days after ordering it so it got to me REALLY fast.  Shipping was a breeze.  It may not be an ""actual"" item, however there are almost no problems with it.  The disks have nice art on them, and the box itself it a little bit uglier than the nice box sets however its a nice DVD box and such.  The languages are English and Japanese with good subtitles.  So far, after watching it (and yes, I HAVE seen the actual episodes as well so I can compare the two) the only thing that gives it away as lower quality is a little shaking during the panning shots.  This does not happen often and it has not detracted from the anime so far.  With this becoming a harder to find anime I say get this unless your uptight about perfect quality.  This is a really cheap and worthwhile alternative.",1234828800,,800,4.14935064935065
8098795,5,B000CFMSO4,"The product is a little sketchy, I just bought it online the other day and watched several parts today to make sure it was good quality. The packaging is top-notch, the 3-DVD setup is a little sketchy, the menus aren't supper high quality, you don't get the ability to skip through parts of an episode (each ""chapter"" on the disc is the next episode) but...

I watched it and it looked like fine quality. Now that being said, I have a 140"" hi-definition projector so if this thing was poor quality I would be able to tell. Is it identical quality to the other versions (typical is 4 episodes per disc) I can't say, but I watched the entire series on those a couple weeks back and can't tell a difference.

So my verdict- if you want to save a lot of money and get a good quality version of his incredible series... this is a fine product. If you are nit-picky about things like menus, shell out the extra dough and buy the 100% legit ones sold as two volumes.",1208736000,,959,4.292817679558011

8098799,5,B000CFMSO4,"I first heard of Wolf's Rain through Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, but do to poor scheduling on their part, it was near impossible to keep up with the series and eventually, it was ultimately cancelled.  Quite unfortunate.

Despite this, this set is quite possibly one of the most affordable ways to get the entire television series as well as the four OVAs of what could be one of the best Animes of all time.

The story takes place in an apocalyptic world where the human population has been reduced to an oppressive living in domed cities, most wild animals have gone extinct, and the Earth's surface has gone dry and barren of plant life.  With the world dying and quickly coming to an end, the story follows a pack of wolves that have adapted to blending in as humans in the pursuit of a fabled world called ""paradise"".  However, a group of humans known as the Nobles seek not only to rule what is left of the Earth but stand in their way in hopes of having paradise for themselves.

Wolf's Rain presents a strait forward story you want to see through to the end with enough twists and beautifully executed action scenes to keep things interesting.  Unlike many series, the characters in Wolf's Rain tend to have an obvious goal, but still retain individual depth that allows you to care what happens to them.  The storyline is unique in its ability to make you root for the wolves without completely villainizing humanity.

The animation is superb and well drawn, but ultimately what becomes the icing on the cake of the series is the music.  Much of the same team that worked on Cowboy Bebop's score put their talent to work in Wolf's Rain.  From the opening song ""Stray"" sung by Steve Conte to the credits ""Gravity"", the music and overall score is one of the best ever put in a television series, let alone an anime, and is a real driving force in each of the scenes.  My only advice that would deter you from buying this box set is to buy the limited edition box set that comes with the soundtrack, as I later bought it as well.

Finally, for those of you that watch the English dub, the series has a talented cast of voice actors, such as veteran Jeff Blum, that do a fine job in bringing further depth to their characters.

Ultimately, this is a powerful anime that as the credits rolled on the last episode left me craving more and should not be missed.  A definite must have for the Anime collector.",1151366400,6,2412,4.474885844748859
