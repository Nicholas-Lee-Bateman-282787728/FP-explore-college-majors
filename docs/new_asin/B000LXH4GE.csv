8198169,4,B000LXH4GE,"I thought it was an excellent movie and caught the racist tones of 1970's outback Australia accurately. I worked a summer job in Nundroo in late  1977 when I was a Uni student in Melbourne - Nundroo in South Australia was a roadhouse near the coast, between Ceduna and Nullarbor, on the edge of the Yatala aboriginal reserve. The attitudes of the local whites were very much as captured in this film. They were generally bigotted - simple as that - and not too worldly or educated, norinterested in hearing other viewpoints !

The American review below is so wide of the mark. Their loss !",1266105600,2,589,4.547169811320755
8198170,4,B000LXH4GE,"This coming of age film is not a blockbuster or too sensational but then it's not trying to be. What it is, is a tight dramatic portrait of rural Australia. I can't say I've seen a film with as many scenes that I either have lived through or have witnessed for real which left me appreciating how well they captured the culture whilst weaving an engaging narrative. Basically it's far more genuine than some American trying to use Aussie slang...

Also unlike many of the other critically acclaimed films involving indigenous culture, it doesn't glorify it in some atavistic tragedy or relegate it to a supporting role rather it's a snapshot of the attitude between cultures in it's setting.

Set your expectation before you see it then you'll be prepared to experience it for what it is. If you're a guy who finds Mamma Mia worthy of 5 stars then I'd say 'don't bother' but if you want to walk a story in someone's shoes at their pace and emotionally engage with a film and it's characters, then it's definitely worth it.",1249516800,3,1022,4.6098901098901095
8198171,5,B000LXH4GE,I think it's a great film... adapted from a great book. Powerful and moving... so what if it's not made in America?! Definitely don't 'not bother' :),1247270400,3,149,4.555555555555555
