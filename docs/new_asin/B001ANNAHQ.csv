8278141,5,B001ANNAHQ,"I actually bought this HD DVD in Rio de Janeiro, and once I watched it back home stateside, was blown away by the vocals, music, and arrangement. It's a live concert in a specially set up recording dome in the Minas Gerias state, and the crowd just goes wild. The HD quality on both video and audio is top flight.

Alexandre is really an MPB (Music Popular Brasil) artist, but the tracks on this DVD are a mix of MPB and Samba. Being a frequent backpacker in Brasil, I'm a samba and forro fan and not MPB as much. But the musicians, especially the many percussionists on this DVD are straight home sambalistas. I have learned a good bit of Portuguese on my travels, but even if you don't know a lick of the language you'll still enjoy this music. The legends are in English, Portuguese, and Spanish.

Alexandre's voice is famous in Brasil and abroad - he has even done some pop duets in the US. The tracks with guest artists are brilliant - watch the one with Angolan artists Anselmo Ralph & Yola Araujo. That's killer samba and zouk. Daniel and Perlla are also great in their duets with Alex. The women on the DVD are smoking hot - dancers and backup singers. That's just Brasil!

I enjoy this music so much, I bought the CD from Amazon and crank it out in my convertible on a 700W system. A Deus Eu Peo turns heads in LA - people are attracted to this sexy language and sound from another land.

Enjoy, and discover Brasil! Obrigado e Adeus.",1252886400,,1443,4.353159851301116
