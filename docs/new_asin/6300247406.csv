265511,4,6300247406,"- and one of these days, I will.
 The reason I'm talking about is the scene in which Chevy's character tries heroically to convince Patti d'Arbanville's character that he can give her an orgasm from across the room. Without touching her. Riot!",1067385600,,243,4.785714285714286
265512,1,6300247406,"Chevy Chase tried too hard to be funny making up for a one-joke plot, poor direction and a cast that was obviously there to just pick up a paycheck.  Bill Murray might have pulled this mess off, though.  This movie is not funny.  It's not cute.  It's a waste of time.",1023062400,6,267,4.176470588235294
265513,5,6300247406,"MODERN PROBLEMS is a wacky movie, silly at times, but overall is a humorous story.  My wife and I loved it. It showed off the comedy range of Chevy Chase; the jealous suitor, the ... jilted lover, the telekinetic imp, the rogue on his way to a mental breakdown, and the viscious demon. His supporting cast furnished a laugh here and a chuckle there. But, Nell Carter, voodoo whiz kid, provided Chase with a character who brought the story all together for a climax. The ostensible story was one of romantic comedy-- romance on the rocks. Don't believe that theory for a minute.  When Chase gets doused with liquid nuclear waste his antics with kinetic hanky panky become the show; a straight comedy show. What is comedy?  It's what makes you laugh. This movie made us laugh. For a bonus, you will see the funniest flirting scene ever filmed. Wink! Wink!",1016064000,5,853,4.635761589403973

265515,2,6300247406,"An incredible cast is mostly wasted in this lackluster comedy. While the plot has great potential, the movie drags, and the special effects are terrible. A few genuinely funny moments, though, and Nell Carter is a hoot.",945993600,8,219,4.945945945945946

Sort of reconciliation is supposed to take place at a beach house with people that have strange personalities. This includes Mark (Dabney Coleman) who gets to play an obnoxious character as in most of his movies.

He is doomed until a mishap or close encounter with radioactive waist transforms him into a telekinetic terror. Will he be able to get his sweetie back?

Maybe if Chevy Chase did something magnanimous with his new-found super-powers, that would be one thing, but in stead he just beats up and bullies the people whom he perceives are getting in his way (case in point, what did the ballet dancer ever do to him?). If you want funny early Chevy Chase, stick with Fletch.",1445472000,,511,4.446808510638298

He tries to tell everyone what he is doing but it seems that no one will believe him even when the occurance is done in front of them! Dabney Coleman plays a narcisstic, book author that feels that everything should go HIS way and even has a brief, first-time nude scene. He has typically played such roles in Tootsie, 9 to 5, and well, you can look him up on IMDB. In any case, I thought the funniest scene was when he (Chevy Chase) made a airplane cigerette ashtry turn on and fly around the room! And Nell Carter as the maid and voodoo mistress fascinating!

266311,4,6300247406,"I used to love this film as a kid and although it has not aged well (many films of the era haven't), it retains most of its charm. The plot is a silly one. Chevy Chase plays Max Fielder, an air traffic controller who is having serious relationship issues. One night, as he is heading home and while driving with his opened sun roof, a tanker truck spills nuclear waste all over him and his vehicle giving him telekinetic powers (think ""Carrie""). Max begin using these powers for his own amusement and for revenge.

This comedy originally released in the early 80's is pretty much forgotten today and is nowhere near as popular or as well known as Chevy Chase's other films like ""Caddyshack"" or the ""Vacation"" movies. As stated, the film is silly. It is basically an SNL skit stretched out to a 90 minute feature but it does offer some laughs. The ballet sequence for instance is hilarious (loved that scene as a kid and I still find it funny today). Chevy Chase does give a charming performance, his facial expressions are priceless but Nell Carter, who plays Dorita, a voodoo practicing maid, steals the scenery when she is on-screen and Dabney Coleman's portrayal of an egotistical, womanizing, self-help guru and author is also a hoot. The film drags in parts but the last quarter is just for laughs and worth the price of admission.

The picture quality and sound are okay and the only extra's featured are the trailer and TV spots. For those who just want to spend 90 minutes on mind-less, harmless fare, the film is recommended. Despite a loopy storyline, the laughs are there, and the ensemble cast deliver in spades.",1409270400,2,1624,4.655052264808362

266410,2,6300247406,"This is by far and away one of the WEIRDEST movies to come out of the early 1980's comedy period. The story is failry simple - burnt out air traffic controller Chevy Chase is doused with toxic/nuclear waste while driving home one evening and develops strange telekinetic powers. What ensues is a smorgasbord of weirdness that, although doesn't make sense most of the time, is generally pretty damn funny. I remember seeing this as a kid and finding it (along with Mark Blankfield's equally weird ""Jeckyll & Hyde: Together Again"", and the cult classic ""Student Bodies"") to be one of the strangest films I've ever seen.

This is by far and away not Chevy Chase at his best (see ""National Lampoons Vacation"", ""Caddyshack"", or ""Fletch"" for that), but it is certainly worth a watch for the nostalgia factor and for the laughs.",1378944000,,821,4.78169014084507

A lot of the blame for the film's failure is in the performance of Chase.  We are told, by other characters natch, that he is a cold heartless manipulator.

266567,2,6300247406,"Modern Problems is a glorious time capsule of 70s kitsch, filtered through a veneer of sci-fi, drug-use, and the decline of modern man.

Chevy Chase is Max Fielder, a control freak with a high-stress job (air traffic controller) who drives his live-in girlfriend away with his obsessive need to control everything. We don't really see exactly Fielder's controlling nature, so we'll have to take girlfriend Darcy's (Patti D'Arbanville)word for it.

It doesn't take long before Darcy's male best friend puts the moves on her. Poor Fielder has the misfortune of bumping into the non-couple in every scene, which further inflames him. And yet Fielder never does anything about it - there's never any fisticuffs, swearing, or much of a reaction at all except a lot of facial expressions ranging from the comedic to the lascivious.

And that's what Modern Problems is mostly composed of...facial expressions.  It's unlikely there will ever be another modern film that takes so much time focusing on an actor's face, and director Ken Shapiro milks these expressions for all their worth.  Chase in particular spends a lot of time hamming it up for the camera.

Although Modern Problems is supposed to be a comedy - and it is juvenile comedy at its best - it also nurses a grudge. Fielder has one of the most important jobs in the world; in the era of emergency landings and terrorist attacks, we all view an air traffic controller's job as critical.  Yet he is powerless as a result of the collapse of social conventions like marriage (Fielder has a friends-with-benefits relationship with ex-wife Lorraine), the ascension of equal rights for everybody (wheelchair-bound Barry is a confident, successful buddy from Fielder's past), and tolerance for every lifestyle (as espoused by BS-spewing Mark Winslow, a self-help author). Fielder is just a working Joe trying to get by, but gone are the entitlements he would have enjoyed in the 50s.

That all changes when toxic waste spews on Fielder, mimicking similarly toxic ""waste"" from chickens and rain that blows into his car's stuck-open sunroof in the beginning of the film. Fielder discovers he has telekinetic powers - humorous ones, mind you, accompanied by silly sound effects - that allow him to do everything from remotely pleasure his girlfriend three times in a row to tossing his enemies around in the air.

Throughout Modern Problems runs the common thread that Fielder resents losing his primacy in modern society. Homophobic jokes abound, from a quote about bringing a gun to a gay bar bathroom to senseless revenge on a hapless ballet dancer's groin. Worse, the only African-American character (Dorita, played by none other than Nell Carter) is a voodoo priestess whose powers don't work because, as well know, Fielder's not possessed, just mutated.

Or something.  By the end of the film Modern Problems abandons the man-with-telekinesis plot for man-possessed plot.  When Dorita attempts to bound the possessed Fielder with magic powder, he snorts it up like it was a drug. The ending wraps things up by passing his powers on to someone else that might need a little help in modern society.

Modern Problems nurses an emotional wound about how poor Fielder can't make his girlfriend happy by being his old, abusive self. Although he gains superpowers, he never really changes.  Instead, it's Dracy's problem. If all those women would just stop worrying about things like jobs and sexual equality then modern man could get back to running the world.

In short, your perspective on Modern Problems likely depends on your station in life.  I saw this movie as a kid and quoted  it for decades, but looking at it through adult eyes I felt a little embarrassed for everyone involved.",1292284800,2,3735,5.017799352750809
266568,2,6300247406,"Though Chevy Chase was the main character of the film, he was actually the least appealing character in the movie.  He seemed like a pretty depressed guy right from the word go, and his appeal (even as the main comedian) just seemed unenjoyable to watch.  He had too many scenes where he just sat there staring forward, and if he spoke, he said something that just contributed to him being continuing unpleasant company.  I think everyone in the film showed a great more patience for Chevy's character than what he deserves. Even before the nuclear waste dump incident.

This was not that great of a comedy even though it really did have a great all-star cast.  Dabney Coleman, Mary Kay Place (who was far too optimistic about life to have ever been Max's former wife), Brian-Doyle Murray, Patti D'Arbanville, and Nell Carter.  These people all contributed stronger supportive roles than what Chevy Chase brought to the film.  But, it may not be Chevy Chase's fault either.  But, I would imagine he would be disappointed with this films overall appeal if he himself watched it today.

I own this DVD because I saw this film during a prime time of my exciting military life in the eighties.  I think even Chevy's ""Foul Play"" was better than this film, but my favorite Chevy Chase film is still ""Seems Like Old Times.""  But again, what helped that movie was all the great supporting cast members.

Come to think of it, I don't think Chevy Chase was ever that funny.  He was just popular at the time, that's all.  ""Fletch"" was dumb; National Lampoon's ""Vacation"" was dumb.  His small role in ""Caddyshack"" wasn't that great either.

Gee, I think I just talked myself into getting rid of this DVD of ""Modern Problems.""  I don't think I'll ever watch it again anytime soon.",1248652800,,1767,4.685064935064935

What's not to love about Dabney Coleman trying to reason with a man who uses his powers to slowly drag him across a wall.

Oh, and the things he could do to his girlfriend by just raising his eyebrows.

This was definitely a cookie movie, but it was fun, and interesting from the psychic powers point of view.  I mean, if you're going to have powers, why not have a little fun with it?",1238803200,3,563,4.128440366972477

Because the film has a ""wacky"" comedy element, people think this is supposed to be a more wild and fun movie. The pacing is slower, the acting is better (especially Chase, Coleman and Carter) and the concept is more out there. This film has more in common with Jerry Lewis or old slapstick than ""Caddyshack"" or ""Zapped!"". Serious comedy buffs need to own this! Brilliant physical comedy and a few 80s one-liners to boot.

Warning, though, it is clever adult entertainment, and some of you will simply not get it. It is spew-your-popcorn-over-the-chump-in-front-of-you funny, but also subtly deep, real, dark and very, very clever.

The scenes in which he uses his powers are outrageous....the restaurant,  the opera house, etc.

266667,2,6300247406,"Acting Lesson #1:

Let's say (hypothetically) that you (yes you!) are a cast member of fledgling hour-long skit-based comedy program Saturday Night Live in the Lord's year 1975. Perhaps you are one of the more popular performers on said program. All over America, SNL is exploding in popularity, and millions tune in to witness your own special brand of physical comedy. Now let's say you get cocky. You figure if you're already so popular on national television, you could become even MORE popular in the movies. So after only one year on the show, you leave to pursue a career in Hollywood. But you weren't ready. You hadn't built enough hype up as a TV star yet, and with what appears to be no consideration whatsoever, you accept every movie roll that comes along.

That, ladies and gentleman, is the story of Chevy Chase. Despite his obvious comedy genius, he blindly accepted the roll of our protagonist Max Fielder in the godawful Modern Problems. Wrought with visible camera equipment, transparent special effects, weird and upsetting continuity errors (including teleportation), and more shots of the boom mic than of Chase himself, Modern Problems is much like a poorly edited home movie.

Now we've established Chases's undiscriminating attitude, but what on earth possessed the rest of the cast? This stinker touted a few reasonably well-known names such as Dabney Coleman, Nell Carter, Mary Kay Place, SNL alum Brian Doyle-Murray, and a guest shot by Pat Proft. Perhaps the first 100 actors to sign up were given a free calendar.

Regardless, I would never pretend that this movie had no value. Like at least 60% of all films, it becomes an instant classic when you and a group of friends gather to guffaw at it's obvious shortcomings. And, heck, there are some legitimate Chevy jokes in Modern Problems. Don't miss the line ""Smells like feet!""",1118793600,16,1857,4.9423076923076925
266668,4,6300247406,"This is one of those forgotten classics that you'll either love, like or hate alot.  The concept is one that has been done several different ways in other movies...but seldom lives up to the results in this movie.  Imagine if you were suddenly given the power of telekinesis, to move things and manipulate things at will.  What would you do if you had that power?  Well...in Chevy Chase's character's case, being as his life is running downhill, you try to win your girlfriend back and wreck havoc in the process.  Again, other movies have tried this concept out...some being the average joe who gets to be a superhero with funny results.  But the ideas in this film are genuinely original...which is probably why I consider it a classic.  It would be interesting to see someone come along and attempt a remake of this one...though I doubt it would have the same impact as this one.  I give it four stars only since the movie is a bit dated and some viewers may not like it as much as I do.  :)",1116979200,11,994,4.447513812154696
266669,5,6300247406,"When I was 12 this movie was a staple on the then still-blossoming HBO.  I think I've watched it or seen bits and pieces of it like more than thirty times. As a kid there were a lot of things I didn't get, of course, but it was funny to me. Now, that was 1982.  Twenty-three years later I saw it on Amazon and nostalgia just washed over me.  I had to have it.  Finally, I thought, Modern Problems and Foul Play have been released to DVD, two childhood staples...  I watched both movies.  Modern Problems was as I remembered it, mostly.  I get all the jokes and situations now that I'm an adult, of course, but there were some other things I got as well.  This isn't the happy-go-lucky Chevy Chase that we all remember from Cassyshack and Seems Like Old Times, this is the darker side.  Modern Porblems has its share of ridiculousness, but beneath the surface, this is a pretty dark comedy.  When Chevy uses his telekinetic powers to make his ex-girlfriend's date's nose start bleeding, Jesus it is hysterical, but at the same time...when you have a chance to think about it...quite grim.  There is an underlying 'life sucks' theme going on here which was where the world was in 1981 and I think this movie captures that pretty well.  Is this my favorite Chevy Chase movie? No. Fletch and Vacation and Christmas Vacation and Caddyshack are.  There's been a lot of others, too.  Is this a classic?  I'd say, yes.  Here is 1981 all rolled up and categorized in a comedy by the reigning star of the time.  A little slice of Regan-era fatalism.  Enjoy.",1115251200,9,1547,4.464285714285714
266670,3,6300247406,"I never really got into this movie, it's more strange than it is funny. And Chevy wasn't his usual self either, he was way to morose and distant to really side with his character or empathise with him in any way.

Chevy plays Max Fielder, an air-traffic controller who's life is constantly in the toilet and bad luck follows him everywhere. He's very paranoid and possessive over his girlfriend, so much so that she dumps him for some total dork.

On his way home from a disastrous night out his car is sprayed with radioactive gunk from a leaky government truck. He is soon blessed/cursed with telekinetic abilities, which he uses to get revenge on those who make his life miserable.

It could have been really fun but it's just...weird. Ken Shapiro (who?) does not have the same edge in his direction as Harold Ramis, Michael Ritchie or John Landis and he doesn't know how to fully use Chevy's brand of humor. There are some laughs to be had though, but their not so memorable.

The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen but it's mostly all shot in soft focus so there's nothing outstanding here. The sound is plain old Mono and it's alright if nothing else, though the dialogue has very heavy use of ADR. A trailer and TV spot are included.
