7900004,4,7798954910,"According to the Internet Movie Database, Jackie Chan has made 99 films; after a quick perusal, I'd say that I have seen approximately...four. So when I say that Sheng Ding's beautifully photographed ""Little Big Soldier"" is the best ""Jackie Chan movie"" I've ever seen, you can take that with a grain of salt. The story is set during China's era of perpetual warring prior to unification under the Qin Dynasty. Chan (who also scripted and co-produced) is the ""Big Soldier"", a world-weary Liang warrior who happens upon a wounded enemy Wei general (Lee-Hom Wang), after a battle. He takes him prisoner, hoping to collect a reward. A ""Prince and the Pauper""-ish misadventure ensues. Reportedly, Chan has been trying to get this film made for nearly two decades. It is a unique, splendidly acted and handsomely mounted comedy-adventure-fable, which also features my favorite line of 2010: ""They are trustworthy, but truculent.""",1294358400,,923,5.16
7900005,4,7798954910,"""Little Big Soldier"" (original title ""Da bing xiao jiang"") is a Chinese/Hong Kong action adventure film starring (and written by) Jackie Chan. The story is set in the last days of China's Warring States Period, just before the Qin Dynasty's first unification of the country in 221 BC. Jackie Chan plays an unnamed old ""Soldier"" of Liang State, who, feigning a death in the battlefield, captures a young, injured ""General"" (Leehom Wang) of Wei State.

All the elderly ""Soldier"" wants is to stay alive, go back to his homeland, and hopefully, to have a small piece of land as a reward. But things are not so easy especially when the Wei troops looking for the General are closing in on them. Also, there are tribal warriors living among the mountainous area where the Soldier and the General have to travel.

Co-produced by Jackie Chan himself, the film has a few nice trademark comic set-pieces using props, but the film's overall tone is rather serious, though not too serious as entertainment. Both leading stars did great jobs here. Jackie Chan, whose acting abilities are often underrated, gives humanity to the character, a blend of comic and tragic elements. Leehom Wang is also good as the proud ""General,"" a young man who still has to learn a thing or two from the old ""Soldier"" - and vice versa.

There are some lapses in his storytelling, but chemistry between the two leads will make you almost forget about it. Director Sheng Ding adds a poignant touch to the adventures by using beautiful locations and songs as the backdrop of the war-time story. With the now familiar end credit bloopers, ""Little Big Soldier"" is an enjoyable ride film with a bit of bitter taste thrown in.",1290124800,30,1687,4.77054794520548
