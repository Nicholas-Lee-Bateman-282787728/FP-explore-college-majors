2249024,4,B0007XG4LO,"This movie was fun, especially for the middle school and elementary set. I believe anyone 15 and under will really enjoy it. Personally, I think this is one of Randy Quaid's best roles. This is one role where he doesn't play a bumbling bafoon (National Lampoon Vacation's cousin Eddie) or a drunk (Independence Day). This role allowed him to show that he can play a serious role and do a good job to boot! Fun action movie for kids, includes many action packed race scenes. Good story line, a family torn apart by the death of Mom, who happened to be partners in professional kart racing with Dad (Randy Quaid). While Dad has fallen into a 4 year self pity rut, his son is getting into trouble with the law in their small town. When professional kart racing returns to their hometown racetrack, Dad and son are able to work together to put the grieving behind them and work together toward a brigh future in kart racing.",1110672000,5,920,4.514970059880239

2249030,4,B0007XG4LO,"Especially great movie for a father and son to watch together, or grandfather and grandson but also for just about anyone. I bought this movie for a Father's Day present for my ""Papa"" husband and was sorry I didn't buy one for my son and son-in-law also. It is a watch over and over kind of movie. Full of speed and rooting for the good guy etc. Randy Quaid was tip top in this (as always....not referred to as Dennis' brother for along time now!) I highly recommend this movie for a time when you want to get your guys to sit down and watch a movie that isn't a ""chick flick"" but has some heart and motors in it too!  I liked it myself!

2249031,3,B0007XG4LO,"Kart Racer is a fun movie starring Randy Quaid as the father of a kid who dreams of being a kart racer. The young lad, Watts Davies (Will Rothaar) gets into more trouble trying to pursue his dream.  He convinces his dad (an ex-kart champion) to help him and this turns into a very positive film.

My husband, use to race at local tracks in southern California, liked this one and he hardly ever sits down and watches anything with me.  He pointed out some of the racing stuff was hyped up and not what really happens, but it was fun and enjoyable.

I found the movie to be very predictable, but still very entertaining and one the whole family can enjoy.

Amazon had a fantastic deal on this DVD and I bought it not expecting much, but I was wrong...",1217203200,,750,4.290780141843972
2249032,5,B0007XG4LO,"My son love this movie and it was a wonderful price, we got it very fast and that may be due to the fact that we live so close to Wisconsin which is where the company is based.  This is our second copy, it is simply a great movie with wonderful inspiration for your child!",1184544000,,272,3.9454545454545453
2249033,4,B0007XG4LO,"Boys, especially boys who have a passion for cars, will love this movie.  To be fair, the story is a simple, run of the mill, common movie story:  a child has to overcome parent's problems to accomplish some goal.  Of course, no matter how inexperienced they are, they always win the race or accomplish some difficult goal.  In this movie, however, they do show 'Watts' ( the boy's nickname) first working without his father's permission, then working together with him to qualify for the big kart race.  Traditional values families will want to point this out to their kids; the hard work needed to accomplish the goal.  Kids may wish to point out to their parents that the parents helped with Watt's goal, not insisting the kid work toward the parent's goals.

There is no bad language or any questionable behavior, so this is a wonderful traditional values movie.  There are lots of scenes of racing cars and even kart crash scenes that most boys will really enjoy.  A more original story would have given this movie an 'A' rating.",1160956800,7,1034,4.7
2249034,4,B0007XG4LO,"I race karts for real and thought this would be a badly filmed and stupid stereo-type view of racers and their daily lives. Which, as it turned out, I was correct!

However, the story line is entertaining and fairly plausible without being too boring. The racing scenes are 'hyped up' for those Americans who can't live without brash commentators stating the blaringly obvious.

The racing enthusiast will find some enjoyment at laughing at some of the inacurrate and over exagerated sections of the film, but will secretly be enjoying it, seeing themselvs in the main character. For the 'normal' person, this will provide them with nothing more than a way to kill some time and an innacurrate view on the karting scene and the people involved in it, but who cares? It's fun and worth 90 minuites of your time. Whoever you are.",1120608000,2,827,4.776223776223776
