8212953,5,B000UCX21W,"we got this just before a beach trip, watched it once.  My husband and two girls all learned something to help up improve our castles.  We made some really cool drip/drizzle style castles.  And are keeping our eyes out for tools and other containers to make other castles in the future.",1357171200,,286,4.568627450980392
8212954,5,B000UCX21W,"I watched Sand Castles for Everyone with my 13 year-old daughter. We liked the three skill levels that give you a good feeling for how to start making sand castles and what is possible at a more advanced level, and the tools section of the DVD that shows you that all the tools you need are probably in your kitchen and garage. Todd's instructions are clear and easy to understand. It was amazing to see Todd sculpt a Neptune figure with such economy of strokes. He is truly a master at his art. My family is now excited about checking out the sand along our local rivers to see if it is ""castle-worthy.""",1249171200,,604,4.353982300884955
8212955,4,B000UCX21W,We enjoyed watching the dvd. It is quicker than reading about it. We did both.,1243987200,,78,4.266666666666667
8212956,5,B000UCX21W,"We love this video.  It is very clear, very helpful and includes techniques for all skill levels.  Our family just won 3rd place at the Crown Memorial State Beach 42nd Annual Sand Castle and Sand Sculpture Contest using some of the techniques we learned from this video.  It was the second contest we ever entered.  Thanks for making such an awesome video!",1212883200,3,356,4.693548387096774
8212957,5,B000UCX21W,"My family and I have always loved making sand castles, but never really knew how to do anything more than basic dribble castles. Our castles quickly cracked when they got too tall. We heard about this video from a friend who had met Mr. Van der Plym, the sand sculptor and had seen a couple of his big projects. The day after we watched the video, we headed down to the beach and built a castle that was our best ever. The suggestions in this video are so simple that anyone can follow them and make something that looks practically professional! We would recommend this video to anyone who loves playing in the sand and building castles.",1186272000,6,638,4.461538461538462
