As you can imagine, I seek out any product with the word chicken in it and buy it.  When a friend told me that there was a movie called ""The Hoboken  Chicken Emergency"", I couldn't resist. I bought it, I watched it and I  loved it! Who can resist?",947203200,6,372,3.933333333333333

7867610,5,6304312083,"This used to be on the Disney Channel in the 80s.  Great story about a boy that gets a giant chicken from a mad scientist instead of a turkey for Thanksgiving. He names her Henrietta. She escapes and causes havoc in the city of Hoboken until she's allowed to live with the boy again.

I love birds and I have always loved chickens.  This movie made an impact on my childhood.  I now have a pet Jersey Giant hen I named Hoboken.  Already had a Henrietta. Like the other reviewer said. I wish this were on DVD.",1407628800,,508,4.195876288659794
7867611,1,6304312083,"You have to know first that this is the only movie in 35 years that my family turned off before finishing. We can put up with a lot of abuse just to say we watched the whole thing, but this move was that bad.
The ONLY reason I bought this on Amazon was as a gag gift for Christmas. I hear they made a second one and that the book was good. I don't know anything about that, but this move is horrible.",1357948800,,400,3.8313253012048194
7867612,5,6304312083,"I read the book: The Hoboken Chicken Emergency to my 3rd graders From Thanksgiving to the week before Christmas vacation.  We then watched the video and enjoyed comparing it to the book by Manus Pinkwater.  My video arrived promptly, before the estimated arrival date, and in excellent condition in its original case.  Thanks for a job well done. :)",1324684800,,349,4.88135593220339
7867613,4,6304312083,"I used to watch this over and over when I was a little kid.  I don't remember how I watched it, it might have just been on tv.  I thought it was weird, but I liked it.  It's been at least 20 years since I saw it last and only remember a couple of random parts from it.  But, come on, they haven't made a dvd version of it?  I don't even own a VHS player anymore...",1292112000,2,364,3.675324675324675
