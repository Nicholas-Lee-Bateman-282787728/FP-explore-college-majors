8579376,1,B00CAYH2IW,"This is a faith based film. Stephen (Dennis Cole) is the towns' sign maker, preacher, and bad actor. He owes money to Mr. Prescott (Rich Henrich) as does most of the town. Mr. Prescott is a bad person who uses a goon (Mark Edwards) to collect his money. The plot goes from bad to inane and then worse. The movie consists mostly of poorly delivered, badly written dialouge. The action is minimal.

The film was boring from start to finish. Any theme about redemption, coming to God, etc. got lost in the sad script. Not worth watching for free and I am being kind.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1374883200,,608,4.468468468468468
