8479782,5,B002EJL6H6,"It is great to hear from the wifes perspective and experiences about a man who gave himself completely to a struggle which called his conscious.  I've read ""My Brothers Road"" a few times and this is a great supplement to the biography.  It's hard to put to words learning about Monte, but if you can appreciate a person who fights for what is right, you will love this glimpse into his existence.",1286928000,,396,4.486111111111111
8479783,5,B002EJL6H6,"Emotional in its depth, honest in its clarity of content, both nostalgic and reverent in its tone, the aptly named documentary ""Who is Monte?"" paints an intimate portrait of an iconic figure of contemporary Armenian nationalistic fabric--Monte Melkonian--holding up a filmmaker's mirror to his very soul and successfully unveiling the essence of Monte. From child to man and husband; from a student of ethnic identity and oppression to warrior and commander, this film captures the spirit of Monte.

The director masterfully weaves the words of Monte's widow  through a compelling chronology of Monte's life,  placing the fragility and vulnerability of Monte's very human persona in the context of his destiny as a hero of the Armenian struggle for the liberation of  Nagorno-Karabagh.  At times touching and tender, at times passionate and explosive, the skilled editing of this film effortlessly brings together varied biographic material--from family photographs to war-time footage--to penetrate the man behind the pictures, the essence behind the stories, the soul of Monte.

The thoughtful use of English subtitles makes this intimate look at an Armenian-American accessible to a world-wide audience.  This film answers the self-posed question, ""Who is Monte?"" with probing curiosity and poignant artistry. Two thumbs up!",1246579200,3,1327,5.605
