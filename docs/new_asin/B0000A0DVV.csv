1900245,4,B0000A0DVV,"For a movie that was probably made for next to nothing this is really a pretty good crime/sci-fi programmer. Director Edgar Ulmer is famous for making good looking low budget films and this is one of his best.
Douglas Kennedy is bank robbing safe cracker Joey Faust sprung from prison by James Griffith(usually a bad guy in b-Westerns and tv shows of the period)to steal radioactive isotopes. Of course to do this Faust has to become transparent and is subjected to radioactive bombardment himself...talk about Faust selling his soul!
Corny, insane, implausible. Yet it somehow works! The acting is top-notch for this kind of stuff and the direction is sure-handed. It's under an hour and ends in a big explosion!
The ALPHA dvd is very good offering a clear picture at a bargin price. Marguerite (FLIGHT TO MARS) Chapman, Red Morgan (he's in Ulmer's BEYOND THE TIME BARRIER, probably shot around the same time) and Ivan Triesault(the mad scientist here) co-star.
Wonderful, whacky fun, a bit sleezy and well made!",1244246400,5,1013,4.964705882352941
1900246,4,B0000A0DVV,"This 1960 black-and-white film is sort of a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Invisible-Man/dp/0783240961/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Invisible Man</a>&nbsp;rip-off, but I'm okay on that criticism in that the two stories aren't all that similar. ""The Invisible Man"" is clearly the superior film of the pair but this one still has its good points.

The tale here is that an infamous safe-cracker (""Joey Faust,"" played by Douglas Kennedy) is sprung from prison to become the minion of a criminal mastermind (""Major Paul Krenner,"" played by James Griffith) who has established an atomic laboratory in a large farmhouse located out in the boondocks. Why does he need an atomic lab? To produce an army of invisible zombies which he plans to sell to the Army!

The lab's venerable old scientist is ""Dr. Peter Ulof"" (Ivan Triesault), a man working under duress because Krenner holds his young daughter hostage in the lab's closet. Krenner has two other shills, neither of which are all that loyal to him: ""Laura Matson"" (Marguerite Chapman) and ""Julian"" (Boyd 'Red' Morgan, who plays the farm watchman, armed with a Winchester .30-30). No one else, including the main cop, is all that significant in the film.

After Faust initially reaches the farm, driven there by Laura in a very cool 1959 Buick convertible, he comes to terms with Krenner after a bit of arguing. Krenner threatens to have him tossed back into the pokey if he doesn't cooperate with his (mad) plan.

Faust takes the tour upstairs with Krenner where Dr. Ulof is introduced along with his new invisibility ray which he demonstrates on a Guinea pig mainly to garner Faust's confidence. Faust is impressed but he sees the device as infinitely more useful in robbing banks while Krenner insists on his stealing atomic material from a government vault. This material is purportedly much more effective, albeit it's also a notably more volatile substance than what Ulof is currently using. The side effects are additionally anticipated to be very hazardous, a fact which is shrewdly withheld from Faust.

Faust goes along with the initial plan, stealing the atomic material right from under the noses of two astonished guards. But after that he sets his own agenda and attempts to draw in his sympathetic peers to help him overcome Krenner.

I can go no further than that without revealing the direction and the ending of the film so I'll stop there.

I thought that the special effects (by Roger George and Howard A. Anderson), the sets, the scenery, the camera work, and the story were all pretty darned impressive, all better than what one typically experiences  in this genre of films. The actors weren't too hokey and the action stayed pretty brisk. This was also a nostalgic, Drive-in movie-type film from my own teen years so that plus is a somewhat personal one and a more subjective point.

The biggest shortcoming of this movie for me is that it only runs for 57 minutes, but that was pretty typical for these B-horror and sci-fi flicks. Also, the DVD packaging on this one conveys that the Transparent Man can walk right through walls, which he can't.

This film was produced by Miller Consolidated Pictures (MCP) and was directed by Edgar G. Ulmer. Jack Lewis wrote the original screenplay. The aspect ratio is 1.75:1, essentially full-frame. It's more of a science-fiction entry than a horror film but I guess you could include it under either title.

In summary, I would definitely recommend this budget film for avid fans of the genre(s).",1220140800,13,3557,5.084048027444254
1900247,2,B0000A0DVV,"This movie is laughably bad.  It's so old, and the picture quality is so unbelievably awful, it's not a scary movie by any stretch of the imagination.  It's only scary feature is the fact that it is remembered enough to be released on DVD.  My favorite part was the mouse trapped to a machine and then it disappears.  It disappears in such a cheesy, horrible way because the film tricks used back in the early 60's were so weak, so it doesn't look believable.  Another favorite part was the guy who was supposedly being beat up by an invisible man, but it was really funny because the guy was jumping around pretending he was getting punched and strangled.  It's funny!  Before anyone accuses me of not being able to appreciate old horror movies, just let me tell you that I've seen other films released from around this time, and they looked a LOT better, and the acting and scary moments were a lot better as well.  This is just not a good movie.",1199836800,,948,4.4393063583815024
1900248,3,B0000A0DVV,James Griffith stars as crazed ex-military officer Paul Krenner who has dreams of world domination whe he forces scientist Peter Ulof played by Ivan Trisquif to do his bidding. Ulof develops the process of invisibility through atomic-radiation in wich Krenner plans to make an army of invisible military force and sell it to the highest bidder. Douglas Kennedy plays Joey Faust a safecracker who has just gotten outta jail and they make him invisble so that he can steal more radium. After he does this things start to take a unexpected turn. Laura played by the beautiful Marguerite Chapman is thrown into the mix. The showdown at the end boosted this up. It was great seeing Griffith and Kennedy duke it out with one another.  It's still a hokey movie but an enjoyable one. The Invisible Man & Hollow Man shouldget together with The Amazing Transparent Man and make a 3 invisible men movie extraviganza. I'd watch it.

1900249,3,B0000A0DVV,"This is one of those old drive-in formulaic wonders that make you roll your eyes and laugh, yet mysteriously manages to entertain with predictable plot points. The story essentially boils down to a mercenary ex-soldier who employs a crack thief (metaphorically named ""Faust""...don't ever say the movie isn't heavy handed) to steal radioactive material for him under the cloak of invisibility. (Oh, wrong movie...I mean transparency.) The thief has other ideas and decides to rob a bank instead, but in one of the most unintentionally funny moments in cinema history, parts of him blink back into the visible spectrum during the holdup. Things go horribly awry, there is a short bout of love, a few hysterical fist fights (as the fighters ""fight"" their invisible...I mean transparent...foe), an atomic detonation, and a wonderful cold war era ending presenting the audience with a real conundrum.

This is a fairly entertaining, and very short, movie. It is generally well acted (though the fight scenes really needed work) and the special effects were above average for the time (I especially like the guinea pig's progressive disappearance effect, though the reanimation effects were really silly looking); I was especially fond of the completely bogus scientific content (the X-13 versus radium explanation is priceless).

1900250,3,B0000A0DVV,"Of course this movie is another variation on ""The Invisible Man.""  Yet the movie has decent special effects and, in spite of a simple and hokey plot, a reasonably enjoyable story.

Joey Faust (Douglas Kennedy) is busted out of prison by Major Paul Krenner (James Griffith).  Krenner wants Faust to steal radioactive material to continue his invisibility experiments.  Dr. Peter Ulof (Ivan Triesault) does the honors as the quasi-mad scientist doing the actual ""science.""  Laura Matson (Marguerite Chapman) is the inevitable hot babe who provides the sexual tension, such as it is.

Everyone is kept in their place because Krenner is a master of manipulation.  He has something on everyone working for him, and if anyone steps out of line he ruthlessly punishes them.  Faust has little interest in stealing radioactive isotopes, longing instead to steal a little cash from the local bank.  The only problem is that something is happening to the creatures treated with Dr. Ulof's process.  A poor defenseless lab critter has already died from the process.  I wonder what would happen if Faust were to suddenly appear while in the middle of a bank robbery?  The possibilities are boundless!

This movie had to be double feature fodder in the early 1960s, or triple feature material for drive-in theaters.  As a science fiction movie it is nearly pure schlock, and yet somewhat enjoyable.  The special effects are generally well-done, but there are moments in the plot where I rolled my eyes.  The radioactive isotopes seemed very poorly guarded, and the isotopes themselves were still visible as they floated down the hall.  I groaned and laughed at the same time.

I wish I could say they don't make movies like this any more, but they still do.  They just show up on the Science Fiction Channel.

Mill Creek Sci-Fi Classics 50 Movie Pack: Disc 1, Side B, second feature - THE AMAZING TRANSPARENT MAN (1960), starring Marguerite Chapman and Douglas Kennedy.  Directed by Edgar G. Ulmer (BEYOND THE TIME BARRIER)

I think most people know what they are getting into with a movie titled THE AMAZING TRANSPARENT MAN - that name alone fairly reeks of low-budget sci-fi.  If that's your assumption, then you'd be right.  But there are grades of low-budget sci-fi - some of which, given the material we're working with, are actually quite entertaining, and others that are nearly unwatchable.  TRANSPARENT MAN falls squarely in the middle, getting an excellent performance out of Kennedy and Ivan Triesault, the scientist who turns Kennedy transparent, and also doing a respectable, 1960's job on the special effects, but failing with a predictable plot and some pretty ridiculous scientific mumbo-jumbo.

The movie starts out with a bang - Kennedy, as Joey Faust, bank robber, is breaking out of prison, and the tower guards have cut loose from their mounted machine guns to try and stop him.  But Joey's got some help - a mysterious woman picks him up not far from the prison walls (in a car she evidently rented from Batman), and spirits him away to an isolated farmhouse.  From there, Faust is introduced to the Major, who has need of Joey's special talents.  Although the scientist the Major is blackmailing (Triesault) has perfected a way to make a living creature invisible, he needs more atomic material in order to be able to create an invisible army, which he can then offer to the highest bidder.  The question is, will Joey play along?  Or will the temptation that comes from a life of crime lure him away?

If I say that the film is pretty good for this kind of movie, that may not be telling enough.  If you've enjoyed B-movie science fiction from the fifties and early sixties in the past, then you'll probably enjoy this as well.  (On the other hand, if you're indifferent or opposed to them, nothing here is going to change your mind either.)  Director Ulmer was prolific if nothing else, and you may have seen his work before - I had (BEYOND THE TIME BARRIER), and his style is competent, if predictable.  This could almost have been a candidate for the fourth season of the Twilight Zone where the episodes ran an hour rather than the half-hour, given its running time and its storyline - and the morality twist at the end.  I think in this case, though, the 58 minute running time works against the story.  It felt rushed to me.

But Kennedy's anti-hero/hero elevates the story - let's not make more of it than it is, but he does sell the film.  His argument with Triesault at the end, and Kennedy's facial expressions as the scientist urges him to do the right thing is a good example of this - here's a fellow you can really identify with.  That alone doesn't make a cheesy flick a classic, but it's proof that 'low budget' doesn't always mean 'don't care'.  Besides, how many times have you wondered what it would be like to be invisible?  Here's another opportunity to vicariously live the fantasy.  Dream on!",1392940800,2,3574,4.9463986599664995

I wonder what would happen if Faust were to suddenly appear while in the middle of a bank robbery?  The possibilities are boundless!

This movie is creative in its use of special effects, not so with respect to plot.  Krenner is a mini-megalomaniac, seeking to manipulate individuals, and ultimately the world, to his own ends.  Faust has baser motivations:  himself and money, in that order.  We have little idea what Faust will do with the money, if he ever gets it, but it is what he wants.  Laura eventually decides she is attracted to Faust, but of course, Faust is too full of himself to see Laura as anything more than a tool for Faust's goals.  The only person here with a moral motivation is Dr. Ulof, whose only interest is getting his daughter, who is held by Krenner, freed.  Ultimately, the characters are stereotypical and the short length of the movie provides little opportunity for much character development.

The end of the movie is semi-predictable, considering the shallow character development.  While I will leave the ending for the viewer to learn, consider statements of the various characters and the end is revealed.

This movie had to be double feature fodder in the early 1960s, or triple feature material for drive-in theaters.  As a science fiction movie it is nearly pure schlock, and yet enjoyable.  The special effects are generally well done, but there are moments in the plot where I rolled my eyes, especially because of the science, or lack thereof.

Dr. Ulof throws switches in an authoritative manner, but he throws different ones each time and the sometimes they go up and sometimes down, in what I thought was a somewhat random manner.  I groaned and laughed at the same time.

1900261,3,B0000A0DVV,"I had very low expectations of this one, but it managed to surprise with me reasonably good acting.

This film features your stock megalomanic somewhere out in the desert, in a Victorian house (naturally), who has plans to take over the world by means of an invisible army.  How he wants to get the army to do his bidding is anybody's guess.  The megalomanic guy's crew is:  a beautiful assistant, the scientist, a guard, and the safe-cracker who they just sprung from prison (he looks and sounds a bit like Humphrey Bogart at times).  The madman is blackmailing a scientist (who incidentally used to work for the Third Reich) by holding his daughter hostage.

The prison escape scene when they are stopped by the cops at a road block is hilarious.  ""Oh your husband has no ID?  No problem, m'am, we surely wouldn't want to wake up your intoxicated husband, that would be very rude of us.  We'll just go on looking for the escaped convict.  Have a nice day. ""

There are a few things that don't add up, such as why this sizzling hot lady is working for an evil mastermind out in the countryside?  Can't she find a modeling job in the city somewhere?  And why does she fall for the thuggish safe-cracker who is never nice to her at all?

As someone else pointed out, the fight scene is truly laughable.  It looks like a couple of teenage girls fighting.  Also, when the whole place blows up and supposedly takes half the county with it, how does the professor manage to survive even though he was just outside the house at the time?

I loved the 'special effects' of invisibility when the ray starts to wear off.  The safe-crackers body appears, then just his head, then his whole body. Embarrassing, especially since he's in the process of robbing a bank.

Okay, I've told you mostly about the funny stuff, but it's really not bad at all.  If you're a fan of B-movies, you'll find this one entertaining.  And if you don't like it, then you have wasted nothing more than a mere 58 minutes of your time.",1290816000,2,2001,4.487534626038781

7995036,2,B0000A0DVV,"Not as bad as I have read. It always surprises me how Ulmer manages to come up with different camera set-ups considering his budgets and time tables, allowing the editors to add some rhythm to the action. The main problem with ""Transparent Man"", in my opinion, is not Ulmer's direction. He was always resourceful even in the worst conditions, and signed quite a few good movies, as ""People on Sunday"", The Strange Woman"", ""Strange Illusion"", ""The Black Cat"", ""The Naked Dawn"", ""Detour"", ""Ruthless"" and my favorite, ""Bluebeard"".  The problem is Jack Lewis' unfocused script, a too verbose tale about power madness, materialism, lust, raw evil and the danger of atomic experimentation. Everybody here can't stop talking, even when the running time is so short. Surely the script should have had 30 pages full of dialogues and more dialogues. Luckily it is over fast.",1434585600,,864,5.041958041958042
7995037,4,B0000A0DVV,"This is a rip-off of the Invisible Man movies but it is still a interesting (and very short!) drive-in type movie.

The plot is ok but not developed fully - this would be pretty good movie if they had fully did this - after all the movie is only 57 or 58 minutes. IF they had made the movie 30 or 40 minutes longer than this it  might have climbed out of just being kind of intriguing. Acting is better than I expected - except for the almost laughable fisticuffs. I watched this on Amazon Prime for free so I did have some picture freezing issues but not so bad that the movie was unwatchable.

However the picture on this DVD case of a guy walking through walls didn't happen - in fact nothing like it did. However - if you ever watched the 4-D Man stuff like that did take place (staring Lee Merriweather and Patty Duke!!).

I would rate this a 7.75  to 8.25 out of 10 - A pleasant way to waste an hour or so.",1431734400,,912,4.072625698324022
