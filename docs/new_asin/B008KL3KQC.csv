8528688,5,B008KL3KQC,"Alvaro Castagnet combined his dialogue with painting, which meant I was able to see a lot more painting.  It was very inspiring and a great resource for my own work.  One of the best watercolor videos.",1411603200,2,201,4.555555555555555

8528690,2,B008KL3KQC,"The cd case interior was broken, and so the cd became loose and all scratched up. The case is poorly made and fragile. I am not impressed with the quality of the video as well.

However, the painting was as good as I expected from Alvaro. Been able to see how he paint from scratch and his use of colors  are awesome.

It would have been a 5 stars except for the case and quality. I hope the CD will hold up to several more times of playing. Fingers crossed.",1358380800,,458,4.066666666666666
8528691,5,B008KL3KQC,"Castagnet is not only accomplished, he is amazing to watch.  Coupled with his sense of humor and casual style the watcher is captivated not only by the process and the painter, but inspired to try the technique.  It is well worth the monetary investment as 5 paintings are completed in 90 minutes.",1347840000,4,297,4.6923076923076925
