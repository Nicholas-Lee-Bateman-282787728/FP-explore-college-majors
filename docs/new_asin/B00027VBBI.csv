8023279,1,B00027VBBI,"This is a low budget slasher with tons of slow poorly acted scenes. It is currently available on DVD as part of a ""They Suck"" multi-pack horror films @ Walmart. Henry Primo (Randy Ackerman) just turned 16. He likes Becky (Laura Sellers) who is a bit cold to him. Meanwhile there are tons of young hot looking babes who smoke Becky, that are after Henry. Of course like any 16 year old male, he stays true to just one girl in the face of babes throwing themselves at him.

His monied family arrange a party during which Jim (Stan Grunewald in a KISS shirt) gives Henry a combination of PCP and LSD...which he claims was 20 hits. During the night Henry goes into a berserker mode and kills 7 people in a matter of a few minutes. He wakes up the next day (seriously he went to sleep after all those drugs) and spends the next 15 years in jail doing a Hannibal strait jacket/mask routine. Afterwards, in an awkward plot point, he is allowed to return home as long as he stays confined. Oh yes, he also has ESP, reads minds, doesn't speak and likes Big Macs. Note product placement.

The plot has holes you could drop a planet through. The ESP thing never plays a part...and who threw those pies?

It does contain one gratuitous strip tease.",1397174400,,1236,4.388646288209607
8023280,4,B00027VBBI,"This is one of Manoel de Oliveira's most obscure films (and many would say that de Oliveira is obscure himself), but it's really quite good and it falls well in the Manoel de Oliveira universe.  I didn't really care for it the first time I saw it, but subsequent viewings of it have made me change my mind.  It seems like a simple film on the surface, but it's really quite complex and fascinating, like all of de Oliveira's films.  This creates an incredible tension between the characters where one feels that violence can break out at any time, but it never does.  It's masterful filmmaking from one of the greatest directors working today.

The film is about two couples, and their power struggles.  There are only two scenes.  The first one takes place at a dinner party on the Portuguese coast where there's a power struggle between Michel Piccoli, Irene Papas, Leonor Silveira, and Rogerio Samora.  After a storm cancels out the dinner party, the film jumps several years to a castle, where the dialogues and the struggles between the couples begin anew.  The 2nd half of the film is much more startling than the first, as de Oliveira's framing, lighting, and amazingly subtle rhythms really take hold of the film.  The 2nd half is reminiscent of The Convent, where the scenes are very dark, yet, they are illuminated just enough that you can see everything that is going on.

Anyone interested in de Oliveira's work should seek this film out.  It's one of his most underrated.",1214611200,2,1484,4.709302325581396
8023281,3,B00027VBBI,"A minor but enjoyable movie by the almost centenary Portuguese director. The movie starts with a beautiful shot of the waves breaking at the rocks of some cliff in the Portuguese coast. The film is basically about two couples, a young one and an old one (the lovely - and Oliveira regular - Leonor Silveira, Rogerio Samora, Michel Piccoli and Irene Papas) in two extended sequences. The first sequence happens in a garden party of some sort by the sea that is interrupted by a storm, the other happens some time later in a castle. The second sequence shows an argument of some sort between the couples, involving an incident that happened in the first sequence. This is a talky movie, but more than the particular dialogues what one remembers about it is the slow but beautiful cinematic rhythm of Oliveira.",1168387200,2,807,4.7304964539007095
8023282,4,B00027VBBI,"First of all, I'm not Rob. I will admit to being a friend of his though. I saw this movie years ago and I thought it was pretty good in a campy B movie sort of way. Be sure and check out Prize Fighter it has a good story line with a lot of local interest if you're from northeast Oklahoma.",1106265600,,289,3.7540983606557377
