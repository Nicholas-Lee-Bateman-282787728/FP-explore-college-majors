8232986,5,B000YJ6FGA,"Six months ago, 1x week, I started taking drum circle doumbek lessons {realizing to be a better belly dancer, i should know the drum beats & rhythms}.
 I had a hard time drumming by myself, remembering the lessons learned; a Belly Sista gave me Carmine T. Guida's ""Baby Beginner Doumbek Workshop"" DVD - AMAZING! - Carmine's way of explaining the positions of the fingers, the hands, the wrists, the Doums - Tek and the Ka's, drills, learning the basics of middle eastern drumming along with Carmine's students in a fun DVD. . from this DVD i learned rhythms (Maqsum, Baladi & Saidi)-- the totally awesome way carmine puts the transition between Baladi and Ayub . . i'm on Amazon tonight to purchase his next advanced DVD. . .

 ~if YOU want to learn to play the doumbek, you NEED to get this DVD! 5***** Kim K'mika - Ghada Girls Belly Dancer~",1333411200,,842,4.562913907284768
8232987,5,B000YJ6FGA,"In my opinion here is no better place to start learning any hand drum than at a drum circle.  That being said there is no better DVD for a beginner to learn doumbek than Carmine Guidas's DVD.  It's recorded in a drum circle environment.  It starts with the basics, how to hold the drum, the doum the tek and ka sounds.  It introduces you to the popular rhythms and repeats them enough times at a slow enough speed that you can digest the rhythms.  You may not be able to accomplish every rhythm the first time through but if you try to do the entire DVD every night for 5 days a week, in a month's time you will have committed the rhythms to memory and you will be surprised at your progress. Nothing works better than meaningful repetition both for your brain and muscle memory. The chapters are set up in a logical progression so you can find the rhythm you are looking for and just repeat that section if that's what you want to do.  There are many good doumbek instructional DVDs out there but I find they move too fast and assume too much.  Wait to buy those later. Start with this one and move to Carmine's Begintermediate Doumbek and you will have a rock solid foundation to move to more advanced drumming techniques if that's what you decide to do. The cheapest individualized instruction in my area is $40.00 an hour. At that rate I figure this first DVD is worth 800 dollars, and I don't have to put any gas in my car...Amazon delivered Carmine to my door.",1317859200,,1466,4.347985347985348
8232988,5,B000YJ6FGA,"this is a great cd and overall series. I've tried other cd including some of the great Masters....however, this cd is excellent for taking a beginner fast through the rythms, plus uses humor, plus uses a classroom environment so you can see others trying out the techniques, struggling with them, getting victorious over them, etc., which is a great encourage-builder.

Plus there are bonuses at the end of each cd that includes jam sessions that allow you to just freestyle it and have fun.

Well done and I've already purchased the beginnermediate cd and look forward to purchasing the advanced editions. Thanks!",1313366400,,614,5.009803921568627
8232989,5,B000YJ6FGA,"Great brass-tacks basics class, taught with clarity and humor in the supportive atmosphere of Carmine's virtual classroom. Basics skills and rhythms are broken down and drilled - lots of belly dance teaching DVDs leave the drilling part to you, so you have to pause the disc to practice. I really appreciated Carmine taking the time for the repetitions that, as he says, will get the skills out of your head and into your hands. Also appreciate his emphasis on relaxation as an important part of technique. I'll be buying his next level teaching disc for sure.",1304294400,,560,4.84375
8232990,5,B000YJ6FGA,"Carmine is not very eloquent, but then again few musicians are. I make my living with language; I guess they let the music do the talking. By this I mean that you wouldn't learn how to hold the drum (and your hands and arms) by listening to him alone. But since this is a DVD and not a CD, you can see how he does it.

However, Carmine does have many skills and character traits which are essential to a good teacher. He is very patient, kind and gentle and he is clearly enjoying himself even at this basic level. I can't detect any arrogance, which is a big plus in my book. Even though this level is ""baby beginner"" indeed, he builds up a good sense of confidence and achievement.

A wonderful first step -- highly recommended!",1299801600,,730,4.282608695652174
8232991,5,B000YJ6FGA,carmine is a great instructor. the lessons are easy to follow and make you want to continue learning. highly recommended!,1290297600,,121,5.1
8232992,5,B000YJ6FGA,"I bought this DVD from Carmine at a show in Virginia. I thought the 5 minute conversation that I had with him was funny and watching him drum was very impressive so I figured that the DVD would be educational and entertaining. I was right. After attempting with other instructional DVDs and being frustrated to the point of giving up, I was preaching AWEsome (Carmine's trademark saying apparently) and actually drumming beats that even impressed my belly dancing wife.
Carmine's style of teaching is perfect to get you drumming several beats in less than 30 minutes with great results. It will be a while before I can go from the ""filled Baladi"" to the Ayub and back but I am working on it after only one evening!

I highly recommend this DVD and hope that he has plans for another one that is at the next level.

8232993,5,B000YJ6FGA,This video is great. I have now watched it three times and am already getting the hang of this. I even learned the CA sound on the first day watching this video. The instructor makes it fun and entertaining. I def. recommend this video to anyone who is interested in learning the Doumbek.,1212364800,6,288,4.452830188679245
8232994,5,B000YJ6FGA,"I have purchased several ""How to"" doumbek books and then realized that they were no help because I can't read music.  I have an idea of basic Belly Dance rhythms from dancing for 15 years, and I can say them and dance to them but had no idea how to ""take them out of my head and play them on the Drum!""

I found a great website and joined that - dorkU.com.  I emailed my consern about drumming and not being able to read music.  The person (Carmine Guida himself!!) suggested the ""Baby Beginners Doumbek Workshop""

One of the best things about the DVD is you are drumming a beat in the first few minutes, (one you recognize)  After trying to teach myself to read music from a book #%^&*!(I had no idea that some of the rhythms would only be played with the right hand! (I am sure before I looked like I was slapping out a fire!!)

Carmine Guida is an ""awesome"" ""fun"" instructor, the DVD starts out super simple and takes you to where you are ready to party and drum with others!  I am sure I have become an annoying person (more annoying) because every time I have company I make them play with me(I have two drums!!) .  Everyone has been totally impressed with the fact that right away they are drumming and sounding spectacular! If I had 3 thumbs, I would give it a 3 thumbs up!!!!  Carol",1204588800,12,1290,4.25
8232995,5,B000YJ6FGA,"This review was written by Maya, a belly dance instructor, and Mustafa, a doumbek rock star wannabe.

Maya:

I really enjoyed this DVD. I appreciated the time taken to explain proper drumming technique (especially since I realized after watching it the first time that I had been doing the ""ka"" sound wrong). The explanations of each rhythm are thorough without being confusing and are interspersed with a good dose of Carmine's wacky sense of humor (especially the mizmar imitation while drumming chiftetelli). The pace of the instruction is slow enough for the viewer to grasp each concept and practice it but fast paced enough so that you don't get bored. It truly is suitable for babies- my 18 month old son now runs around saying doum and tek!- and beginners with enough challenges to keep you practicing for a while before you master everything on it. If you can't take a drumming workshop with a live instructor in your area, buy this DVD. You'll get your money's worth.

Mustafa:

The DVD is filmed live during three Baby Beginner Doumbek workshops. (Nice editing job). This made it more interesting to watch than say someone staring at the camera telling you what to do. It made me feel that I was part of the class, yet I could pause, rewind, or fast forward the DVD whenever I needed to. Carmine breaks it down enough for me to actually get it. It was helpful to start with the simplified version of each rhythm and once that was imprinted in muscle memory the filled in fancy version was easier to play.

After the workshops are over, Carmine plays in two jam sessions and a performance. It is AWEsome to watch and hear. I had to zoom in on his hands and slow the motion down to try to figure out how the heck he's making those sounds. That didn't quite reveal his technique, however. It left me wishing Carmine would produce an intermediate level doumbek DVD.",1197331200,14,1872,4.626506024096385
