1730543,4,B0000694ZB,"The video shows lots of jungle animals with the numbers and counts.  I thought it was educational.  They showed the animal and played a song and told about the animal.  My kids seem to like videos that tell a story.  My children were not really into just watching animals only.  But, if your children love to watch REAL animals then they might like this one.  I thought it was very educational.",1111363200,5,394,4.47887323943662
1730544,5,B0000694ZB,This video is great for the whole family.  The songs are wonderful and don't bore the adults.  My baby jumps up and down whenever I even sing the songs.  She loves this video more than any and we have 12!  BUY IT  TODAY!,947462400,5,220,4.023255813953488
7965184,4,B0000694ZB,"As an adult the songs are a bit irritating and repetetive, but my 2 1/2 year old son really likes it. Children learn through repetition. It is a decent quality movie and the numbers do seem to be helping him in the way they teach. The animals are very cute and it keeps my son interested and he asks to watch all of the time.",1416441600,,325,4.015384615384615
7965185,5,B0000694ZB,Animal Numbers: Learning to Count with Animals is a fun video that your kids will surely enjoy.  We got this video for my daughter and son and they loved it.  The animals in the video are super cute.  I would definitely recommend this video.,1385164800,,241,4.431818181818182
7965186,5,B0000694ZB,I bought this and the alphabet version 10 years ago for my first son when he was a baby and he is learned how to read well by 2yrs old.  I searched hard for this again and now my newborn of three months totally enjoys the animals and fun songs.  No need for nursery rymes with this video.,1304121600,,288,3.9482758620689653
7965187,5,B0000694ZB,"We bought this video and the Animal Alphabet video for our son when he was 17 months old.  We were looking for live-action stuff that would be good for someone of his age.  He's now 22 months old and still loves it.  The footage on this video is amazing. I enjoy it because I get to see animals I'd never heard of before (a widow bird, for example) and I get to see animals I'd seen before do things I hadn't seen before.  It's a Time/Life production so it's not surprising that they have excellent footage and production values.  The songs, written and performed by British composer Anton Mullan, are both catchy and educational.  Everyone I've shown this video to has been impressed.  A side note: the video intrepidly introduces ""zero"" after having counted from one to ten.  The concept of zero will be out of my son's reach for many years, I think!",1179964800,,852,4.487012987012987
7965188,5,B0000694ZB,This is truly an educational movie. Not only does it teach counting but also teaches about the animals with snappy upbeat songs.,1178668800,,128,4.863636363636363
7965189,5,B0000694ZB,"This video teaches much more than just the numbers 0-10.  The real footage about animals is fascinating and so fun to watch.  The songs are catchy and easy to sing along with.  Your children will be able to name dozens of animals at the zoo after watching this video.  It's great for all ages.  My sons are 2 & 7 and both of them watch parts of the video almost every day.  I like it, too!",1178409600,,389,4.052631578947368
7965190,5,B0000694ZB,"I'm not the type to park my son in front of the tv all day, it is mostly just for some time for me to get stuff done (dishes, laundry,...)  I found this movie at a discount store for $3 while on vacation.  My son was just a year old when he started watching it.  HE LOVES IT!  He is now 17 months old and watches it at least once a day.  I just ordered the alphabet dvd, hopefully he will love it too.  I don't think it is just for older kids, my son loves this movie.  I disagree that it doesn't get annoying but I don't usually watch with him...I value the 40 minutes of mommy time.",1150934400,2,584,3.857142857142857
7965191,5,B0000694ZB,"Our 2 year old twin boys enjoy both Animal Numbers and Animal Alphabet.  The songs are catchy and great footage of the animals.  For some reason they prefer Animal Alphabet - maybe because we had that one first.  Both boys are really into animals right now.  We read a lot of books and play games that are based on animals.  Since they're also learning to count and say their alphabet, the Animal dvds were a perfect choice.",1140739200,2,424,4.454545454545454
7965192,5,B0000694ZB,"At first I thought this video was a little strange -- not what I expected of an animal counting video.  It has fast-paced images with very lively music by an Australian band.  But it is so well done.  The video footage is outstanding, and the original music goes really well with it.  Each song is excellent. It's clear that a lot of work by those with expertise went into making this video.",1129852800,4,391,4.388888888888889
7965193,5,B0000694ZB,"I bought this and the ABC version together for my 2 year old to get her started (she loves animals).  The songs are great, the footage is awesome and she enjoys when I sit with her and repeat the names of the animals.  However the reviews lead me to believe they were OK as a first video, since I bought so many numbers and ABCs videos I have to say that for my kid, the best responses have been for those videos that have a lot of repetition. It will be a great song DVD for our car when she is ready to ""review"" what she has learned, and I will definitely NOT be bothered by the songs, they are not at all annoying, the songs are really different from other DVDs and their rhythm varies from song to song.",1126656000,4,707,4.042857142857143
