5092629,3,B007K7IBRA,"This is not compelling viewing as so many ESPN 30/30 films are.  This is mediocre at best.  Chuck Wepner asserts that he is the real boxer who inspired Sylvester Stallone's Rocky character.  Big deal.  Rocky is likely an amalgamation of many boxers, not just Chuck Wepner.  Wepner is obviously jealous of Stallone's success and sues to get a slice of the pie.  Bad form if you ask me.

Wepner was more famous for his proclivity to bleed than his boxing skills, and perhaps his illegal rabbit punches.  He was a dirty fighter.  He fought an out of shape Ali, stepped on his foot and knocked him down.  Now he's made a career out of that moment.  Let's face facts, Wepner was nothing more than a white punching bag.  Sure, he had a winning record, but whenever he fought someone with boxing skills, he usually lost.  The fact that he was temporarily ranked in the top-10 of boxing is an insult to the sport (this was done to legitimize his title fight with Ali).

Wepner is not a sympathetic figure.  He was convicted of using and selling cocaine, and also convicted of forgery.  To make him out to be the ""victim"" in this documentary strains credibility.

Wepner has repeatedly cried about the unfairness of the Stallone situation, but for me, it is more about a man who is jealous of Stallone's success and believes he is entitled to Stallone's money.  It's bad grapes.

This is one of the worst ESPN films I have watched.  Usually, ESPN films are quite good, but this one dies of a TKO.

5092630,5,B007K7IBRA,"Fascinating video which shows exactly where the inspiration for the Rocky movies comes from and more than once Stallone admits this to be true. Watch a true story about a working stiff from New Jersey who takes on the world [ sometimes he wins/ sometimes he doesn't ] but he never loses his ability to be honest, especially about himself which is next to non-existent in this ""I'm the Victim"" world we live in today. You also get to see M. Ali as he really is: a self absorbed draft dodger who never knows when to shut up. Great story about a great guy.",1376524800,,553,4.326923076923077

5092632,5,B007K7IBRA,"""The Real Rocky"" is another stellar entry in ESPN's fine 30 x 30 documentary series. My favorite sports films of all time are the stunning, panoramic ""Hoop Dreams"" and the original ""Rocky."" Stallone, an under-appreciated talent, wrote the initial salvo over something like one long weekend, spurred on by having witnessed the Ali-Wepner bout live. All of this is legend now, of course, but seeing the transformations Chuck Wepner's cinematic life took are nearly as fascinating as watching ""Rocky"" and the final chapter, ""Rocky Balboa,"" a gem, back to back. Do I buy the central thesis that Stallone had robbed Wepner of life rights? Not really. The similarities are there, but Wepner, although not in the class of Ken Norton, George Foreman, and Philadelphia's favorite son, Joltin' Joe Frazier, WAS a ranked fighter. Mr. Balboa was a nowhereville collector for a loan shark. This flicks simply moves, though. A tale of an Also-ran, it ranks up there with ""The Best That Never Was,"" the Marcus Dupree.",1355961600,4,1002,5.042168674698795
5092633,5,B007K7IBRA,"I don't want to give any spoilers, as a lot of this movie was a big surprise to me. Just watch it.

For fans of Rocky, boxing, or Muhammad Ali (or even professional wrestling), this is a must-see.

But you don't have to be a boxing fan or a Rocky fan to enjoy this movie. This is a tale of human drama (and occasional comedy) that should appeal to anyone. Wepner is a likeable Everyman.

The movie had great pacing, there wasn't a boring moment.

Highly recommended.",1348444800,2,466,4.32183908045977
5092634,5,B007K7IBRA,"Before viewing this movie, I knew that Stallone had based his Academy Award-winning picture, ""Rocky"" on the Chuck Wepner fight with Ali. What surprised me were the other things he ""borrowed"" from Wepner's life that he used his movies. Muhammad Ali does not come out well in this movie. He's really kind of a jerk, not anything like the image the media has created for him. Personally, I think he's very over-rated. Check out the Mike Douglas Show interview. Very informative and entertaining.",1346284800,,492,4.9397590361445785
8518787,4,B007K7IBRA,"Very interesting film, well made.

This guy sued Sylvester Stallone for stealing his life story to make Rocky.  More specifically, for Stallone using this guy's name to promote the Rocky movies without Sly giving him a penny to do so.  There are major elements of this guy's life story all throughout Rocky I, II, and III.  They eventually went to court.  I'll save the end of the movie for you.",1479427200,2,395,4.585714285714285

8518790,4,B007K7IBRA,"Chronicles the life of Chuck Wepner. A Marine, a bouncer. Someone tells him he ought to be a boxer so he does that. Fights some well-known fighters, includes pictures and footage, insightful.

He is scheduled to fight George Foreman but he loses to Ali so Wepner gets Ali. He was ranked as the #8 fighter. He gets to train full-time. Ali wants him to make it a racial thing for ratings, ugg. They go at it for 15 rounds, Wepner puts Ali on his rear.

Sly Stalone  sees the fight on close circuit TV and writes a movie inspired by the fight. Wepner gets a phone call to go see the movie. A second movie is made and Wepner gets invited for a small role. He is hung over so it does not work out.

He battles Andre The Giant. In Rocky III Balboa battles a wrestler!

Eventually Wepner sue$ for being used as a model. Insightful. A movie is supposedly to be made.",1467849600,,858,4.2073170731707314
8518791,4,B007K7IBRA,"I believe that this is a biased documentary from the point of view of Mr Wepner. I believe that a writer has license to become inspired by real life events and if not there would be nothing to write about. Should every war movie give all the profits to the brave men and woman who fought? Well maybe! But What about every western giving the profits to the indigenous natives of North America. Every prison film giving the profits to every prisoner, especial;y the ones who are not guilty! No! Writers are allowed to write and Stallone obviously works damned hard. Lockup, Escape Plan, Rambo and the Rocky series are about human beings and Mr Stallone settled out of court because he had to fell harassed and feel some pity. How many fighters did time? Most of them. I don't agree with Mr Wepner but he received some cash from a hard working man, ok, enjoy the money but the film only portrays him as a whiner! Go ahead and kick my ass you bully!

8518796,5,B007K7IBRA,"Chuck Wepner life was stolen for a fictional story ' ""Rocky"".This documentary makes that case. I do not think ""Sly"" even denies the fact that he lifted the life story of Chuck's life. This documentary is rather sad but also really funny. Ali and Chuck seem to be much more interesting guys then today's fighters. more real. I do think  Wepner is a likable guy. I do think he won a case against Stallone. Fake heroes are sometimes celebrated far more then real ones.",1435968000,,465,4.535714285714286
