8171816,3,B000MTEFQY,An average show from a great writer with a disappointing finale.  Should have been better but wasn't bad.,1193270400,,105,4.833333333333333
8171817,5,B000MTEFQY,"I found this wonderfully entertaining.  Sure, the series doesn't follow the game exactly, but this was still fun and enjoyable.
