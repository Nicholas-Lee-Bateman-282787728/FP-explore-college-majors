2860207,4,B000R7I490,"Clearly life in State College Pa. has seen its better days. The History of Penn State Football is much more than what has transpired over the past few months. It's about a program that rose from an unknown cow college to one of the most respected athletic and academic schools across the land. This DVD does much more than simply place Joe Paterno on a golden throne. Considering the documentary was produced several years ago, the horrible events that unfolded in the latter part of 2011 and into 2012 are not included. It's without argument Paterno played a major role in the program's ascent. Nittany Lion All American and former Fearsome Foursome member Rosie Greer does a splendid job of narrating. Keep in mind, Penn State is also Rip Engle, Franco Harris, John Cappelletti, Todd Blackledge, D.J. Dozier, Kerry Collins, Jack Ham and Chuck Fusina. That's just scratching the surface. The history, while a bit fractured today, is rich and proud.",1342569600,3,949,4.900621118012422

8199222,5,B000R7I490,"I attended Penn State from 1952 to 1958, majoring in mechanical engineering.  (I needed nine semesters to graduate because of my NROTC course load and subsequently heavy academic credit schedule.)  That included all of the liberal arts electives that my curriculum afforded.  The last landed me an active duty assignment in Admiral Rickover's organization, managing projects involving the design and construction of nuclear-powered ships and submarines.  He too firmly believed that we ""techies""  needed a broader-based education beyond pure engineering.  But that's a whole other story.",1354060800,,587,5.767441860465116
