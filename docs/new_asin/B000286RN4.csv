2066568,2,B000286RN4,"I'm not sure what is worse, the acting, the screen writing or the mess they made of a great story. IT'S A BIG WASTE OF $16.00

The story was completly ruinned the setting was to be a small flat in NY's village the appartment in this movie looked like a victorian place. Thsy dresses well and the entire feel was wrong including an added twist of a grandmother telling hea child the story with some stupid put on twang. The whole production was really a waste. I guess the producer paid for the awards it won.

IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE A GREAT VERSION OF THIS BELOVED STORY BUY O'HENRY'S FULL HOUSE BY CIMINA CLASSICS I BOUGHT MINE ON AMAZON, IT'S LESS EXPENSIVE AND YOU GET 4 O'HENRY STORIES WITH A CAST OF GREAT OLD TIME MOVIE STARS. Just a wounderful collection of stories. I was so happy to find it, I lost a VCR copy I taped from TV years ago. It was never showen again. You won't go wrong.",1257552000,5,895,4.1976744186046515
2066569,1,B000286RN4,I still have not received this product that was ordered in March. I also attempted to order it in Dec. and had no luck! HELP!!! What does it take to get this item???,1238803200,,165,4.03030303030303
2066570,1,B000286RN4,"Several things are terrribly wrong with this video:

1) It seems that they were trying to create a faithful rendition of the story in video format by scripting it word-for-word from the original story.  While reading O. Henry's exact words may be enjoyable, phrases like ""imputation of parsimony,"" ""mendicancy squad,"" ""meretricious ornamentation,"" etc. do not transfer well at all to film.  A more professional screenplay adaptation is necessary for the story to translate into something that makes sense for a video audience.

2) While the cast was attractive and fit the parts visually, the acting style seemed very amateur and much more reminiscent of a small town theater company as another reviwer noted.  It was too over the top for the subtlety that video can capture.  It simply didn't seem genuine.  This can partly be blamed on the use of O. Henry's exact words, rather than properly adapting it for film.

3) The camera angles, lighting, and audio recordings are all poor in comparison with today's production standards.  Although Amazon's editorial review lists several awards dated 2002 for this film, it looks like it was shot in the late 80's or early 90's...very low budget.  The cost of the DVD should be reflected in the quality of the video.  It's definitely not a collector's item that would cause one to overlook dated production values.  This DVD is far too expensive for the product delivered.

When I purchased this, I was remembering a made-for-tv version (more of an ""inspired-by"" rendition) that I viewed when I was very young.  I thought I was purchasing the one I remembered.  Unfortunately, I was incorrect.  After a bit of research, I discovered that the version I remembered is called ""The Gift of Love"" starring Marie Osmond and Timothy Bottoms, also available through Amazon on DVD.  I realize that Marie Osmond is not an academy award winning actress. But I found a clip of her version on YouTube, and it has much more character and appeal than this version by Scott Mansfield.  The story is still set in the appropriate time period, but the screen adaptation is far more engaging, and the production is far more professional than the version I purchased.

My recommendation?  If you want an exact rendition of the book, and you're not concerned with a quality video production, buy this version.  If you can settle for an ""inspired by"" version of O. Henry's story and want a DVD that is far more engaging to watch, buy ""The Gift Of Love"" instead.",1231372800,11,2482,4.875894988066825
2066571,5,B000286RN4,"This short film is a timeless portrayal of selfless love and compassion in the ""true"" spirit of the Christmas season.  It should be in everyone's video, CD collection.",1141084800,4,167,4.964285714285714
2066572,2,B000286RN4,The descriotion said it had George Wendt in it and he's nowhere to be found. Also the director listed was different. I already ahd this video and thought I was getting a different and hopefully better version of the story. I felt ripped off.,1135123200,5,241,4.5
8023445,2,B000286RN4,"Liked the bits of original dialogue.  Saw ""O'Henry's Full House"" couple of weeks ago on Uverse free movies (was a TCM classic). 5 O'Henry short stories done in 1952, I think. Anyway, the performance of The Gift.... was wonderful and a lot for this one to live up to. But since I couldn't access the older rendition, this one served well enough to show my 8yr old granddaughter, even though I had to rent it.",1482019200,,407,4.426666666666667
8023446,2,B000286RN4,Story is MUCH better than movie.,1456876800,,32,4.5
8023447,1,B000286RN4,It is framed by having an older person telling a child the story.  I don't understand why anyone would stage it that way.  It is not the same story and it ends up being kind of sappy and hokey.,1434672000,,193,3.923076923076923
8023448,1,B000286RN4,I was very disappointed. The bit with the grandmother and child breaking in for extended periods ruined the movie unfortunately.,1419724800,,128,5.45
8023449,3,B000286RN4,"This isn't very good.  On the up side, it gives students an opportunity to contrast the film to reading the story.  Even my most reluctant readers preferred reading it.",1419120000,,168,4.758620689655173
8023450,2,B000286RN4,"The film opens with a grandmother, a granddaughter, and emotive acting in an attic. ""The Gift of the Magi"" is then a flashback told by the grandmother and acted out by a stilted couple consisting of an insecure wife and cajoling husband.",1393804800,3,237,4.666666666666667
8023451,3,B000286RN4,"This version fell a little short, as much was taken out. If you want to get the brief story line, then I would recommend.",1387929600,,121,4.083333333333333
8023452,1,B000286RN4,"Not a great film at all.  The screenplay suffers from trying to maintain too much of the narration, and the acting is ho hum.",1355184000,3,125,4.208333333333333
8023453,2,B000286RN4,"I rented this to show to my class, who had read the story.  After previewing the first 5 minutes, and decided not to show it to them.  The original story was changed by having an older woman telling the story to her granddaughter as a memory, with flashbacks. This was an unfortunate addition that ruined the flow of the story, and  the acting was not convincing.  I do not recommend it.",1353110400,4,387,4.408450704225352
8023454,2,B000286RN4,"I anxiously awaited the holiday season to show the video to students.  Today I read O. Henry's short story, ""The Gift of the Magi"" to them and then put in the video.  The story describes Jim and Della as almost destitute and describes their coats as old and the house as near shabby.  The video portrays a couple that live in a very nice place with nice looking coats on the coat tree.  The narrator (Della as Grandmother) tells her grandaughter how poor she and grandfather were then, but the flashbacks show a couple who look anything but impoverished.  The couple's sacrifices to please the other were diminished when they were portrayed as capable of laughing it off and heading out to the store again!  Too bad.  I doubt I'll ever watch/show the video again--better to let the reader use the author's well chosen words to create his/her own image. I'm very disappointed.  O. Henry deserves an apology! A video librarian is quoted on the case as saying the ""video remains true to the short story..."". She must not have read the same short story I read!",1292371200,2,1056,4.609625668449198
