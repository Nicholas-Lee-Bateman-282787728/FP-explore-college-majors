8349624,5,B001CP1UN8,Just listening to the music in this film renforces the fact that most of Latin/ Cuban music has it's roots firmly embedded in Africa. Too bad that most Africans have been unable to profit from this fact and improve their living conditions.,1453075200,,239,4.714285714285714

8349628,5,B001CP1UN8,"As we drift down the Congo River, passing the rotting corpses of countless sunken boats, viewing them with equal amounts of horror and perverse interest, we see the following text, in French and English, scroll by: ""Today the Democratic Republic of Congo is also a country where international business interests continue to work with rebels and aggressors to pillage the resources belonging to the people, reduced to hunger. It is a country where in recent years almost 4 million have died--the result of a civil war kept alive by international geopolitical powers.""

Originally released in 2007, and re-released in 2010 by First Run Features on DVD, ""On the Rumba River"" serves two vital purposes. It tells the story of Congolese musician/composer Antoine `Wendo' Kolosoy and the musical style, Congolese Rumba, he innovated. In the telling of this story the film reminds or introduces the viewer to the Congo's horrifying history of occupation, cultural destruction, exploitation, and war.

Watching ""On the Rumba River"" is a little like dinning on a sweet and sour dish. The people we meet -- along with the irresistible music they make -- are sweet. Their impoverished living conditions enshrouded by the fog of hopelessness is sour -- bitter, of course, is a more accurate reference.

Director Jacques Sarasin captures Wendo, an old man with a wife and many children, seated, in the bright African sun, eyes closed, his head in his hand, while his wife berates him for not working, pleading with him to get a real job, not music. The two eventually converse.

Refusing to comply, Wendo gradually pulls together the musicians he worked with decades earlier to reform the band and put on a show. Through interviews we learn bits and pieces of Wendo's and his music's past. And we hear the indomitable spirit of music briefly break through the Congo's horrific history and the people's current oppression.

I was deeply gratified by Sarasin's vivid, high quality images -- as well as the excellent audio quality. As I've written in a few reviews of documentary films, this standard DVD's visual quality approaches the Blu-ray standard when played through my Blu-ray player. The disc's ""Special Features"" includes Bonus Music Tracks, Photo Gallery, Wendo Kolosoy Biography, Sacques Biography, Theatrical Trailer, and Trailer Gallery.
