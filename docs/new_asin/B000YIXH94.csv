8232933,5,B000YIXH94,"My daughter loves to watch this video. She started watching this 2 months ago. She is now 16 months and can say the next letter in the alphabet wherever I pause. In the past week, she can say the numbers as well. She loves the words mango, hello, berry, etc. I am simply impressed with this video. I wish they sold the numbers DVD in the US.",1465171200,,341,4.104477611940299
8232934,5,B000YIXH94,"You might never have thought it possible, but these clever people have managed to create a great DVD that combines synthetic phonics with fruit and vegetables! All manner of fruit and veg have been ingeniously animated to create objects and scenes that are the basis for each lesson in phonics. The disc is divided up into brief sessions that can be viewed on a daily basis and which look at individual letters, blending groups of letter sounds, and then blending those sounds into whole words.

Our children found this DVD a really fun and effective introduction to phonics. After watching the DVD we were able to extend the learning experience by using fruit and vegetables to make our own faces, shapes, letters, numbers and pictures. Though the combination of phonics and fruit sounds an unlikely one, we found that this DVD really caught our children's imagination and helped them to learn whilst playing.

I would recommend this to anyone who wants their children to learn how to read and write quickly and painlessly!",1295481600,,1024,4.913294797687861

8232936,5,B000YIXH94,"This is very cleverly done. I got it as a gift for my niece, and of course had to watch it myself. The bright colors are engaging, and the way the objects are constructed is amazing. I'm not an educator, but I can see the information is presented well. There is a variety and not everything is completely spelled out, allowing the viewer to make the connection. And it really does make me want to eat fruit and vegetables!",1216944000,3,422,4.3544303797468356
8232937,5,B000YIXH94,"Great balance between education and
entertainment. Great graphics that capture tiny imaginations and a
lovely introduction to phonetics, children copy and repeat the sounds
very quickly and have their favorite characters, the lions and monkey
are very popular in our family, they are made out of real fruit and
vegetables which the kids find really funny, they watch it all the
time and keep learning new animals, even the older kids are fascinated
by it, I'm impressed! and I love the clip of Evie on the review by
Eliza, how cute is she...",1214438400,3,541,4.827956989247312
8232938,5,B000YIXH94,"I've never really seen animated characters entirely put together using pieces of fruits and veggies, but my son certainly found it entertaining. And I would imagine that in addition to teaching kids the alphabet, the bright colors and fun shapes promote a healthy diet as well.

Overall, this is a really fun DVD for young children - It's bright and colorful, and the unique style of characters made entirely from fruit and vegetables is truly fun to watch.",1214438400,3,457,4.858974358974359
8232939,5,B000YIXH94,"This was recommended to me from a friend in England who is a kindergarten teacher and uses it with her pre-school class, but it wasn't available in the States so I was very pleased to see it on Amazon and bought it straight away, I was particularly interested because all the characters are made from real pieces of fruit and vegetables, the animations are really cleverly done, its really something different that I haven't seen before,  children try to guess what the characters are, they repeat the alphabet letter sounds, words and numbers along with the dvd which has a really cute childs voice over, personally I feel that anything that encourages children to eat fresh fruit and vegetables from a young age is a big plus, the children ask for fruit while they're watching, as that little girl does on the video.. They watch it over and over, and ask for 'fruity' I would highly recommend it..

Sure does what it says on the tin. They love repeating the letters and sounds. Fruit is definitely on the menu when this is goes on. Spotting the animals and things made out of fruit is FUN, some very ingenious ones like the Queen of England!! I've just sent one to my buddies little girl in CA.
