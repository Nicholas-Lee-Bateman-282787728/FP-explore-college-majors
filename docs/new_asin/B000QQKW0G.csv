I like all of them.  Had seen and wanted to have them around for comic relief and found the 3rd was just as funny...to me.",1518220800,,269,4.056603773584905
8196907,5,B000QQKW0G,"While I bought this tri-pack for BILL & TED, I am able to wacth the other two I've never seen. I remeber as a teen wacthing BILL & TED on tv and thought the concept was great. It's basilly BACK TO THE FUTURE but with humour.",1349049600,,224,3.891304347826087
8196908,3,B000QQKW0G,"I was browsing Amazon for the Spinal Tap dvd ,when I came across this 3 DVD pack. It seemed like a good buy since I had seen Airheads and I liked the movie. I wonder why/how Bill and Ted's excellent adventure fits into this compilation. While Spinal tap and AIrheads qualify to be called rock n' roll flicks,B&T is an extremely kiddish flick ( looks dated in 2008 )and apart from a few stray refernces to their band and some rock star names thrown in,is no way a rock flick. I could think of so many other flicks which would have rounded off this compilation better. Am not sure if they belonged to the MGM catalogue,but even then,Im sure the MGM guys would have found something more relevant to this theme if they looked up their library. I'd recommend that you buy the DVD of the movie you want,rather than invest in this pack.",1210982400,,829,4.3896103896103895
