8337310,3,B001R4KQCU,"This video is quite interesting whether you agree with the political views presented here or not. Freedom of speech is protected, hypothetically, for all points of view. Sometimes that is hard to accept when it's a 180 on your beliefs.",1359676800,,235,4.9
8337311,1,B001R4KQCU,"Nevens needs to learn that there is a BIG difference between freedom of speech and the freedom to teach. In this boring video (I only got through about 10 minutes)Nevens tries to pollute the minds of minors in high school with his anti-war rhetoric and other such nonsense. College, maybe? Public high school? Not to minor children and not on my tax dollar. He was a draft dodger during the Vietnam War (look it up) and has no right being a public school teacher period in my opinion. No stars for this trash from me!",1301097600,,517,4.4526315789473685
8337312,5,B001R4KQCU,This is a story of a teacher who gave his students voices and was terminated for it. The students used poetry to express themselves; the poetry was political and questioned the establishment and the Iraq war. This film opened my eyes to many injustices that happen when you are an independent thinker.,1234224000,7,301,4.8076923076923075
