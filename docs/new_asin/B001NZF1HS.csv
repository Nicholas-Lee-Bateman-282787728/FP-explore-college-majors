8328531,4,B001NZF1HS,"These are two of the most important presentations ever put on DVD !! First you get a new version of the UFO press conference at the National Press Club. By new version I mean that this one was organized by James Fox and Leslie Kean. You get many of the witnesses the Dr. Greer and Mr. Basset had in 2001 and 2007 (I believe) with a couple of new ones thrown in - most of whom are from other countries. These are people who are first hand witnesses to the reality of unexplained aircraft and often the active cover-up that is on going.

Next is Richard Hoagland's presentation about the moon and the structures and other artifacts that NASA doesn't want you to know are there !!  Mr. Hoagland touches on Dark Mission, and the Monuments of Mars, but concentrates on the Moon. The audio is a little rough, but not bad enough to keep you from being amazed at the information.

Whether you are new to this material or not, this is massively important for everyone. There has never been anything as impressive or important offered for such a reasonable price. Watch it. Share it with others. It will inspire and amaze you. As someone who has done his homework on this subject, I can tell you that the information presented here is very valuable and has been cross confirmed with other witnesses and researchers.

Remember the old saying - fact is stranger than ficition !!",1378598400,,1366,4.518218623481781
