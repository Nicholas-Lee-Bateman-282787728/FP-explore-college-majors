2966415,2,B000WC38WI,"While I admire Buscemi for attempting what can be one of the harder things to do on film - basically a two-actor script - I hated this. Yes, it's riveting - perhaps the film's deftist feat is its way of hooking the viewer back in every time the two characters threaten to part ways. But by the end I hated the actress and wasn't terribly fond of the journalist. I felt like I'd been enmeshed in the lives of two people unworthy of my time and attention. Also depressing was the ageist message/resolution. Made me nostalgic for films in which age and experience counts for something durable and respectable.

2966416,2,B000WC38WI,"This film should be rented or watched on television before you decide whether to purchase a copy of it.

Both Steve Buscemi and Sienna Miller (especially Miller) are among the finest contemporary actors - so it is almost always a pleasure to watch their work.  However, this film consists primarily of over an hour of improbable and sophomoric dialogue between Pierre (Buscemi), a failed, morally-flawed (yet self-righteous) journalist and Katya (Miller), a self-absorbed, manipulative actress who, alternatively, pities and preys upon the unlucky Pierre.  Through a series of interchanges between the characters, we learn (over and over) that they peddle fiction to their respective audiences and, at times, to themselves - but this is easy to pick up during the first ten minutes of the film.  The rest of the film seems intent on exploring how many ways this basic message can be delivered and redelivered.

The majority of the interchanges between Pierre and Katya take place in Katya's bohemian apartment, so the film - especially with its minimalist camera work and limited space - often creates the feeling of an intimate stage play.  This would be fine if the writing allowed the characters to expand beyond those limited confines and become interesting.  However, both Miller and Buscemi (who also directed)are repeatedly forced to try to ""emotionally charge"" the alternatively petty and ""heavy"" dialogue that is aimed at showing, as Warhol would have put it, that each character is, in his or her own way, ""deeply superficial"": Imagine two actors forced to take a really good five-minute Tennessee Williams scene and stretch it out for over an hour.  Mid-way through the film (or sooner), you will probably stop caring.

The silver lining in this otherwise forgettable film is the incredible range of Miller and Buscemi's mastery of quirky character. For me, this aspect of the film made it worth viewing - but only once.",1205539200,4,1931,5.124203821656051
2966417,4,B000WC38WI,"When it comes to Steve Buscemi and Sienna Miller in ""Interview"", I don't think I've seen a middle aged man and a young woman that had this much chemistry since Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanson in ""Lost in Translation"". However, if Murray and Johanson's on-screen relationship was warm and nurturing, the relationship between Buscemi's Pierre and Miller's Katya is more like a cage match.

Pierre, a self-important political journalist, is assigned to do an interview with a subject he believes to be beneath him ... Katya, a schlock TV/film actress and tabloid fixture. The two characters clash instantly, but end up continuing the ""interview"" all night in Katya's opulent New York loft, where the two characters ridicule, antagonize, manipulate, charm, seduce and abuse one another, both for their own career agendas and to satisfy their equally inflated egos. Steve Buscemi (clearly a talented director as well as being a great character actor) and Sienna Miller both give terrific performances playing these two complex, layered and often repugnant characters. I found the whole thing fascinating.

Toward the end of the film Pierre tells Katya ""What do we both have in common? Neither of us believes in relationships. There's no equality ... there's always a winner and a loser."" Watch the film to see which is which.",1200960000,6,1322,5.144186046511628
2966418,1,B000WC38WI,"When I watch a movie, I accept to get something out of it, but after watching interview I feel let down like I have wasted my time.  I don't mind wasting my time being a person who is perpetually lazy, I do, however, regret having watched this movie.  I had compassion for the main two characters, a journalist and young female celebrity, for they seemed like real people despite their obvious self-destruction and lack of compassion.  Nevertheless, by the end of the movie, I hated not only the two characters featured in this film, I found myself hating humanity a feeling I am not too costumed to because I have been a human for reasonable amount of time, and have found humans most if not almost all to have the capability to love, be emotionally intimate, and grow with interactions of one another.  However, the young female celebrity, Katya, proves at the very last few moments in the film interview to not be able to love, be compassionate, or even be human at all.  Not only is the character Katya unrealistic, but her final actions scared me to the core.  I know that there are sociopaths in the world, but they are rare.  I would even hazard a guess that very few of Hollywood's celebrities are sociopaths.  Therefore, this movie is an interesting view into those few humans that can lie without feeling remorse. Be that as it may, I wouldn't waste my time watching this movie.",1200268800,4,1388,4.5910931174089065
2966419,4,B000WC38WI,"INTERVIEW is a smart little independent film adapted from the 2003 Theo van Gogh film by the same name, a film that drew a lot of attention based on a script by Theodor Holman, which in turn was based on an idea by Hans Teeuwen sparring the famous Dutch actress Katja Schuurman with actor Pierre Bokma. In this adaptation Steve Buscemi reworked the Holman screenplay with the help of David Schechter, changing the female role to a tabloid type bombshell actress (also named Katya, played with razor sharp clarity by Sienna Miller) with a disgruntle political reporter Pierre (Steve Buscemi) whose career is on the skids requiring that he take lousy assignments such as this interview to stay alive.

Other than a disastrous opening in a classy restaurant where the two characters realize they are ridiculously mismatched as an interview pair, the entire film takes place in Katya's loft. Katya appears shallow and short of goals and Pierre only acquiesces to complete the interview when he suffers a head injury and is invited for ice and drink to Katya's place.  What ensues is a battle of wits in which each of the two characters discovers more about each other than either cares to disclose, and after a 'mating dance' of sorts the two return to their separate corners of the boxing ring - each having a final twist on the other's private life.  It is a play within a play and the words make all the difference.

Sienna Miller is becoming one of the more important actresses on the screen and in this role she proves her mettle in a superbly nuanced role.  Steve Buscemi may not have been the optimal choice to play Pierre, but he is sharp to watch and is never short of intelligence, both as an actor and as a writer/director. Not an action movie and not a film for those who need strong narrative, but for viewers who enjoy the barbs and wit of a sparring match, this is a well-made example of the genre.

2966420,1,B000WC38WI,"The DVD jacket is totally misleading in its trying to sell the film as a comedy ""with a twist"". In fact, the writing is pretty bad, the directing is worse, and acting is wooden and stereotypical. Sienna tries hard but has little to hold on to.

There is very little of interest here to attract the casual film watcher. The personal dynamics does not work, in fact, Buscemi is awfully irritating in his quasi-journalist role and I kept asking what would the Miller character see in Buscemi's ineptly played persona.

While Steve Buscemi's 'Interview' isn't in the same category, his feature brings wit and irony front and center in an admirable fashion.

Political reporter Pierre Peters (Buscemi) and soap opera star, Katya (Sienna Miller) in 'Sex in the City-esque 'City Girls,' spar with one another in what commences as an admirable update of `Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Who-s-Afraid-of-Virginia-Woolf/dp/0790732254/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</a>.  During the opening scene they're at a restaurant, each interrupted at key times with cell phone calls.  (To sample the lack of subtlety, her cell phone goes off with the sounds of a feisty terrier.)  We find out later that he's intensely irritable for being reassigned from the political beat to interviewing acting celebrities.  Early on we also discover that both are forces to be reckoned with as they try to outwit one  another.

Recovering from a restaurant debacle, most of the movie occurs at her place.  From tempest to tranquility, the film ebbs and flows in manic/depressive cycles.  Each time they start to calm down, they discover they have more in common than would have originally imagined.  Chemical dependency comes to the surface as she snorts cocaine, and he continues on a typical drinking binge.  Their intoxication has a sobering undertow as each tries to expose the other's vulnerability.  Both are formidable players in the tirades that come to roost in her apartment.

In two keys scenes, each tries to unravel the other.  She takes her video camera and starts to interview him.  Similarly, he gets on her computer and does some investigating of his own.  The dirt each finds about the other is enough to undo the other unless someone is clever enough to win their intense sparring match.

2966422,4,B000WC38WI,"This is the first of three films, which are American remakes of feature films directed in the Netherlands by the late Theo van Gogh. Actor/Director Buscemi was specifically chosen by the original producer to direct the film. He chose the lead role for himself. I have not seen the ""original"" and am basing my comments just on viewing the DVD of this US version.

The film is 85 minutes long and, except for 2-3 minutes at the beginning, and even less at the end, there are only two actors on the screen talking and interacting with each other. And nearly all the action takes place in one New York City apartment - though it is a big loft apartment! And yet this is not a quiet conversational film like ""My Dinner With Andre"". There is definitely a sexual thing going on here but you'll note that the R rating is for ""language and strong sexual situations"", not nudity. There is no nakedness at all. Yet, like some of the prime scenes in ""Body Heat"", there is definitely sexual tension in the air. And, not unlike ""Body Heat"" this is an emotional duel between a man and a woman where what is said is not always the truth.

I was not familiar with lead actress Sienna Miller before this film. (I loved Buscemi in ""Ghost World""). Until I watched the two featurettes (the requisite ""Making of...."" and a brief interview with Director/Star Buscemi), I was not aware that Miller is British. She has an LA accent down pat. And it's perfect.

Note that the locale can be a bit confusing. Miller's character is a TV actress and is hounded by Paparazzi so the film should be set in LA. But the loft set and the mention of being in Washington in a few hours, gives the viewer the impression that it's in lower Manhattan. But you'll find yourself listening to the words and watching the chemistry between the two characters that you won't even think about it until the film is over.

This is not a great film that will win big awards. It's an ""independent"" And for the 90 minutes or so that you are watching this DVD you won't find your mind wandering or getting bored. Give it a chance. I did, and I'm glad I did.

2966436,3,B000WC38WI,"""Interview"" starts out very strong with some very sharp dialogue and witty exchanges.  The set up reminds me some of a movie called ""Conversations with Other Women"" starring Helena Bonham Carter and Aaron Eckhardt in that it is mostly a two person and one scene play.  But ""Conversations"" was better than ""Interview"" in that the dialogue and emotions remained consistently believable throughout the film, and this is VERY important, both of the characters were likeable and plausible and you wanted them to be with each other.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Conversation-s-With-Other-Women/dp/B000JJ5G4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Conversation(s) With Other Women</a>

There are moments where Buscemi (who is a great actor) and Miller (who did a fine job with what she had) came across as very believable and sympathetic.  But somewhere around the mid-point of the flick, Miller's Katya sort of morphed into a pathetic, coke snorting nut and Buscemi came across as a complete phony (when he told Katya ""I care about you...I really do,"" I found myself rolling my eyes and thinking ""yeah right."")

There are three other defects to the movie that I will have to tag with the SPOILERS warning...see below

SPOILERS

1. I don't think that this movie played straight with its viewers.  Almost to the end, we were given the impression that Buscemi and Miller's characters actually had come to care about each other at least a bit.  But then, the plot twist threw all that out the window and suddenly it became ""battle of wits between the movie star and the washed-up journalist"").  Frankly, I would have preferred a straightforward setup where either Buscemi and Miller did become friends or a setup where you knew they were adversaries from the start.

2.  The twist where Buscemi discovers what he thinks is Miller's diary (but which turns out to be that of her character in a soap opera that she wrote out as an acting lesson) was so obvious I spotted it immediately and found myself thinking, ""Dear God, don't let that be the twist ending.""

3.  Given the fact that Buscemi's character was planning all along to betray the trust that Miller had ostensibly placed in him, I totally didn't believe he would ""share"" (let alone on videotape) his darkest personal secrets.  I think that it would have made a much better ending if after Miller told him she had the tape and was thinking about sending it to the police or his boss if Buscemi had said, ""What makes you think I told you the truth about me...incidentally I took a few acting classes so I know how to say something that's complete BS and make it sound like the truth just like you did.""

END SPOILERS

So I would give this film 3 stars for a strong first half and hope that Buscemi and Miller will partner in some future enterprise.  Maybe she could do a turn on ""Boardwalk Empire"" some time in the future.

2966439,4,B000WC38WI,"... like a woman scorned

I knew of Steve Buscemi prior to watching Interview but I doubt I've heard of Sienna Miller before and that's too bad because, unless she's playing the part of her life as Katia (the cheap thrills movies star and darling of the tabloids) in ""Inteview"" I'd like to see a lot more of her, playing major parts in major future releases. Seriously.

Surprisingly watchable, ""Interview"" feels and plays a lot like an off- or maybe off-off-Broadway... play, and this is not meant to be a negative. It's basically 2 people, Buscemi - an unscrupulous war correspondent/political reporter turned 'fluff piece' interviewer - and Katia - the supposedly empty-headed but sexy all-over starlet - sizing each other up and playing a complex game of seduction, true and/or made-up confessions, gradually and reluctantly revealing each other their darkest secrets. Or so it seems. But not everything is the way it appears to be and, in the end, we get the well-earned and much-deserved catharsis.

Sienna Miller is simply brilliant as Katia: seductive, talented, entertaining, convincing making us to want to see more of her in more 'serious' movies. Buscemi... well... maybe he's not too convincing as a sex object but he is quite good as the cheating reporter making up sources and stories and in the process of being downgraded to the 'page six' beat. The two of them plus an abundance of alcohol, tobacco and some not so legal drugs managed to keep me interested for the movie's duration and that's all I needed on a Sunday evening.

To sum it up, ""Interview"" is not groundbreaking art but it's a clever script, a brilliant play by Miller and a good Buscemi performance, demonstrating that he can do more than episodic parts as target for other people's fists. A 4-star rating is fair.

______________________________

Note:

The movie is R-rated, probably for language (maybe a couple dozen f... can be heard but not much else) and for showing some copious and near continuous consumption of alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs. While the sexual tension is so strong, you can almost smell the pheromones, there is no nudity and nothing explicit takes place beyond some kissing and close dancing.",1266710400,,2207,4.948648648648649

2966441,4,B000WC38WI,"Steve Buscemi's ""Interview"", timing in at 86 min. with a whopping 3 setting changes, is a suprisingly intuitive character study for being so short. Veteran Buscemi and up and comer, Siena Miller, mesh with complete ease and everything seems to work well.

Along with a very interesting screenplay, these two actors completely devulge into their characters and really compliment eachothers strong points. I really cannot emphasize how fun it is to watch these two in action. It's strange how simplistic you think the film is for the first half only to get to the second half and realize your watching a complex drama of a rare sort.

This may have been designed to be an acting tour de force by a couple actors, but it was not.  This gave me the impression that it was made as a project for a college acting class.  The twist at the end was sooooo lame that I called it as soon as the journalist peeked onto the starlet's computer.  This was a twist I saw coming and kept saying to myself:  ""Please be wrong.  Please be wrong.""  Sigh, I wasn't wrong.  Another issue I had was the countless times the writer threatened to leave and did not or the countless times the starlet ordered him out then changed her mind.  But what really bothered me about this work, other than the lack of plot, bad dialogue and totally unlikeable characters was the drug and alcohol consumption.  Between the two main characters, they drank more wine in 84 minutes than I could consume in a week and, except for about 30 seconds, never got even tipsy and then after that 30 second display of drunkenness, were sober again for the rest of the film.

3200913,2,B000WC38WI,"This film should be rented or watched on television before you decide whether to purchase a copy of it.

Both Steve Buscemi and Sienna Miller (especially Miller) are among the finest contemporary actors - so it is almost always a pleasure to watch their work.  However, this film consists primarily of over an hour of improbable and sophomoric dialogue between Pierre (Buscemi), a failed, morally-flawed (yet self-righteous) journalist and Katya (Miller), a self-absorbed, manipulative actress who, alternatively, pities and preys upon the unlucky Pierre.  Through a series of interchanges between the characters, we learn (over and over) that they peddle fiction to their respective audiences and, at times, to themselves - but this is easy to pick up during the first ten minutes of the film.  The rest of the film seems intent on exploring how many ways this basic message can be delivered and redelivered.

The majority of the interchanges between Pierre and Katya take place in Katya's bohemian apartment, so the film - especially with its minimalist camera work and limited space - often creates the feeling of an intimate stage play.  This would be fine if the writing allowed the characters to expand beyond those limited confines and become interesting.  However, both Miller and Buscemi (who also directed)are repeatedly forced to try to ""emotionally charge"" the alternatively petty and ""heavy"" dialogue that is aimed at showing, as Warhol would have put it, that each character is, in his or her own way, ""deeply superficial"": Imagine two actors forced to take a really good five-minute Tennessee Williams scene and stretch it out for over an hour.  Mid-way through the film (or sooner), you will probably stop caring.

The silver lining in this otherwise forgettable film is the incredible range of Miller and Buscemi's mastery of quirky character. For me, this aspect of the film made it worth viewing - but only once.",1205539200,4,1931,5.124203821656051

However, if Murray and Johanson's on-screen relationship was warm and nurturing, the relationship between Buscemi's Pierre and Miller's Katya is more like a cage match.

Pierre, a self-important political journalist, is assigned to do an interview with a subject he believes to be beneath him ... Katya, a schlock TV/film actress and tabloid fixture. The two characters clash instantly, but end up continuing the ""interview"" all night in Katya's opulent New York loft, where the two characters ridicule, antagonize, manipulate, charm, seduce and abuse one another, both for their own career agendas and to satisfy their equally inflated egos. Steve Buscemi (clearly a talented director as well as being a great character actor) and Sienna Miller both give terrific performances playing these two complex, layered and often repugnant characters. I found the whole thing fascinating.

Toward the end of the film Pierre tells Katya ""What do we both have in common? Neither of us believes in relationships. There's no equality ... there's always a winner and a loser."" Watch the film to see which is which.",1200960000,6,1322,5.144186046511628
3200915,1,B000WC38WI,"When I watch a movie, I accept to get something out of it, but after watching interview I feel let down like I have wasted my time.  I don't mind wasting my time being a person who is perpetually lazy, I do, however, regret having watched this movie.  I had compassion for the main two characters, a journalist and young female celebrity, for they seemed like real people despite their obvious self-destruction and lack of compassion.  Nevertheless, by the end of the movie, I hated not only the two characters featured in this film, I found myself hating humanity a feeling I am not too costumed to because I have been a human for reasonable amount of time, and have found humans most if not almost all to have the capability to love, be emotionally intimate, and grow with interactions of one another.  However, the young female celebrity, Katya, proves at the very last few moments in the film interview to not be able to love, be compassionate, or even be human at all.  Not only is the character Katya unrealistic, but her final actions scared me to the core.  I know that there are sociopaths in the world, but they are rare.  I would even hazard a guess that very few of Hollywood's celebrities are sociopaths.  Therefore, this movie is an interesting view into those few humans that can lie without feeling remorse. Be that as it may, I wouldn't waste my time watching this movie.",1200268800,4,1388,4.5910931174089065
3200916,4,B000WC38WI,"INTERVIEW is a smart little independent film adapted from the 2003 Theo van Gogh film by the same name, a film that drew a lot of attention based on a script by Theodor Holman, which in turn was based on an idea by Hans Teeuwen sparring the famous Dutch actress Katja Schuurman with actor Pierre Bokma. In this adaptation Steve Buscemi reworked the Holman screenplay with the help of David Schechter, changing the female role to a tabloid type bombshell actress (also named Katya, played with razor sharp clarity by Sienna Miller) with a disgruntle political reporter Pierre (Steve Buscemi) whose career is on the skids requiring that he take lousy assignments such as this interview to stay alive.

Other than a disastrous opening in a classy restaurant where the two characters realize they are ridiculously mismatched as an interview pair, the entire film takes place in Katya's loft. Katya appears shallow and short of goals and Pierre only acquiesces to complete the interview when he suffers a head injury and is invited for ice and drink to Katya's place.  What ensues is a battle of wits in which each of the two characters discovers more about each other than either cares to disclose, and after a 'mating dance' of sorts the two return to their separate corners of the boxing ring - each having a final twist on the other's private life.  It is a play within a play and the words make all the difference.

Sienna Miller is becoming one of the more important actresses on the screen and in this role she proves her mettle in a superbly nuanced role.  Steve Buscemi may not have been the optimal choice to play Pierre, but he is sharp to watch and is never short of intelligence, both as an actor and as a writer/director. Not an action movie and not a film for those who need strong narrative, but for viewers who enjoy the barbs and wit of a sparring match, this is a well-made example of the genre.

There is very little of interest here to attract the casual film watcher. The personal dynamics does not work, in fact, Buscemi is awfully irritating in his quasi-journalist role and I kept asking what would the Miller character see in Buscemi's ineptly played persona.

While Steve Buscemi's 'Interview' isn't in the same category, his feature brings wit and irony front and center in an admirable fashion.

During the opening scene they're at a restaurant, each interrupted at key times with cell phone calls.  (To sample the lack of subtlety, her cell phone goes off with the sounds of a feisty terrier.)  We find out later that he's intensely irritable for being reassigned from the political beat to interviewing acting celebrities.  Early on we also discover that both are forces to be reckoned with as they try to outwit one  another.

Recovering from a restaurant debacle, most of the movie occurs at her place.  From tempest to tranquility, the film ebbs and flows in manic/depressive cycles.  Each time they start to calm down, they discover they have more in common than would have originally imagined.  Chemical dependency comes to the surface as she snorts cocaine, and he continues on a typical drinking binge.  Their intoxication has a sobering undertow as each tries to expose the other's vulnerability.  Both are formidable players in the tirades that come to roost in her apartment.

In two keys scenes, each tries to unravel the other.  She takes her video camera and starts to interview him.  Similarly, he gets on her computer and does some investigating of his own.  The dirt each finds about the other is enough to undo the other unless someone is clever enough to win their intense sparring match.

3200919,4,B000WC38WI,"This is the first of three films, which are American remakes of feature films directed in the Netherlands by the late Theo van Gogh. Actor/Director Buscemi was specifically chosen by the original producer to direct the film. He chose the lead role for himself. I have not seen the ""original"" and am basing my comments just on viewing the DVD of this US version.

The film is 85 minutes long and, except for 2-3 minutes at the beginning, and even less at the end, there are only two actors on the screen talking and interacting with each other. And nearly all the action takes place in one New York City apartment - though it is a big loft apartment! And yet this is not a quiet conversational film like ""My Dinner With Andre"". There is definitely a sexual thing going on here but you'll note that the R rating is for ""language and strong sexual situations"", not nudity. There is no nakedness at all. Yet, like some of the prime scenes in ""Body Heat"", there is definitely sexual tension in the air. And, not unlike ""Body Heat"" this is an emotional duel between a man and a woman where what is said is not always the truth.

I was not familiar with lead actress Sienna Miller before this film. (I loved Buscemi in ""Ghost World""). Until I watched the two featurettes (the requisite ""Making of...."" and a brief interview with Director/Star Buscemi), I was not aware that Miller is British. She has an LA accent down pat. And it's perfect.

Note that the locale can be a bit confusing. Miller's character is a TV actress and is hounded by Paparazzi so the film should be set in LA. But the loft set and the mention of being in Washington in a few hours, gives the viewer the impression that it's in lower Manhattan. But you'll find yourself listening to the words and watching the chemistry between the two characters that you won't even think about it until the film is over.

This is not a great film that will win big awards. It's an ""independent"" And for the 90 minutes or so that you are watching this DVD you won't find your mind wandering or getting bored. Give it a chance. I did, and I'm glad I did.

3200933,3,B000WC38WI,"""Interview"" starts out very strong with some very sharp dialogue and witty exchanges.  The set up reminds me some of a movie called ""Conversations with Other Women"" starring Helena Bonham Carter and Aaron Eckhardt in that it is mostly a two person and one scene play.  But ""Conversations"" was better than ""Interview"" in that the dialogue and emotions remained consistently believable throughout the film, and this is VERY important, both of the characters were likeable and plausible and you wanted them to be with each other.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Conversation-s-With-Other-Women/dp/B000JJ5G4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Conversation(s) With Other Women</a>

There are moments where Buscemi (who is a great actor) and Miller (who did a fine job with what she had) came across as very believable and sympathetic.  But somewhere around the mid-point of the flick, Miller's Katya sort of morphed into a pathetic, coke snorting nut and Buscemi came across as a complete phony (when he told Katya ""I care about you...I really do,"" I found myself rolling my eyes and thinking ""yeah right."")

There are three other defects to the movie that I will have to tag with the SPOILERS warning...see below

SPOILERS

1. I don't think that this movie played straight with its viewers.  Almost to the end, we were given the impression that Buscemi and Miller's characters actually had come to care about each other at least a bit.  But then, the plot twist threw all that out the window and suddenly it became ""battle of wits between the movie star and the washed-up journalist"").  Frankly, I would have preferred a straightforward setup where either Buscemi and Miller did become friends or a setup where you knew they were adversaries from the start.

2.  The twist where Buscemi discovers what he thinks is Miller's diary (but which turns out to be that of her character in a soap opera that she wrote out as an acting lesson) was so obvious I spotted it immediately and found myself thinking, ""Dear God, don't let that be the twist ending.""

3.  Given the fact that Buscemi's character was planning all along to betray the trust that Miller had ostensibly placed in him, I totally didn't believe he would ""share"" (let alone on videotape) his darkest personal secrets.  I think that it would have made a much better ending if after Miller told him she had the tape and was thinking about sending it to the police or his boss if Buscemi had said, ""What makes you think I told you the truth about me...incidentally I took a few acting classes so I know how to say something that's complete BS and make it sound like the truth just like you did.""

END SPOILERS

So I would give this film 3 stars for a strong first half and hope that Buscemi and Miller will partner in some future enterprise.  Maybe she could do a turn on ""Boardwalk Empire"" some time in the future.

3200936,4,B000WC38WI,"... like a woman scorned

I knew of Steve Buscemi prior to watching Interview but I doubt I've heard of Sienna Miller before and that's too bad because, unless she's playing the part of her life as Katia (the cheap thrills movies star and darling of the tabloids) in ""Inteview"" I'd like to see a lot more of her, playing major parts in major future releases. Seriously.

Surprisingly watchable, ""Interview"" feels and plays a lot like an off- or maybe off-off-Broadway... play, and this is not meant to be a negative. It's basically 2 people, Buscemi - an unscrupulous war correspondent/political reporter turned 'fluff piece' interviewer - and Katia - the supposedly empty-headed but sexy all-over starlet - sizing each other up and playing a complex game of seduction, true and/or made-up confessions, gradually and reluctantly revealing each other their darkest secrets. Or so it seems. But not everything is the way it appears to be and, in the end, we get the well-earned and much-deserved catharsis.

Sienna Miller is simply brilliant as Katia: seductive, talented, entertaining, convincing making us to want to see more of her in more 'serious' movies. Buscemi... well... maybe he's not too convincing as a sex object but he is quite good as the cheating reporter making up sources and stories and in the process of being downgraded to the 'page six' beat. The two of them plus an abundance of alcohol, tobacco and some not so legal drugs managed to keep me interested for the movie's duration and that's all I needed on a Sunday evening.

To sum it up, ""Interview"" is not groundbreaking art but it's a clever script, a brilliant play by Miller and a good Buscemi performance, demonstrating that he can do more than episodic parts as target for other people's fists. A 4-star rating is fair.

______________________________

Note:

The movie is R-rated, probably for language (maybe a couple dozen f... can be heard but not much else) and for showing some copious and near continuous consumption of alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs.

3200938,4,B000WC38WI,"Steve Buscemi's ""Interview"", timing in at 86 min. with a whopping 3 setting changes, is a suprisingly intuitive character study for being so short. Veteran Buscemi and up and comer, Siena Miller, mesh with complete ease and everything seems to work well.

Along with a very interesting screenplay, these two actors completely devulge into their characters and really compliment eachothers strong points. I really cannot emphasize how fun it is to watch these two in action. It's strange how simplistic you think the film is for the first half only to get to the second half and realize your watching a complex drama of a rare sort.

Another issue I had was the countless times the writer threatened to leave and did not or the countless times the starlet ordered him out then changed her mind.

8222430,5,B000WC38WI,"SURPRISINGLY GOOD! I found this film much better than I expected. It was a really interesting experience watching it. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Pierre Peders (Steve Buscemi) was once a brilliant journalist, covering foreign wars and major political events - now he is a broken man, doing second rate jobs. One of those is interviewing Katya (Sienna Miller), a very popular young actress, specialized in B-movies and soap-operas. Pierre hates his life, hates the task he was given and openly despises Katya, it is therefore only normal that their interview begins very badly. But it will last longer than expected and go into directions we cannot foresee initially... I will not say anything more about the film.

This remake of 2003 Dutch film ""Interview"" by Theo van Gogh (who was one year later murdered by a Muslim fanatic) is a surprisingly interesting thing. It was different from what I expected and surprised me many, many times. It can be also understood in many different ways and is ultimately quite deep. It is definitely a quite intelligent kind of entertainment.

This was I believe the fourth film directed by Steve Buscemi. I didn't see the previous ones, but this one he clearly aced. The convention here is similar to a theatre piece, as most of action takes place in one room (even if it is a big one) and there are only two characters who matter. The main pillar of the film is therefore the dialog, which is very good indeed - even if occasionally it turns a little bit weird.

On the surface of things this is a kind of war of sexes film, but there is not much of a fight here, as Katya has all the cards for her (beauty, social position, money, success and she is in her own appartment). Women usually have the upper hand in those things anyway and here Pierre is handicapped both by his age and also by the fact that he is a total trainwreck. I found that there was more of a class war waged here, as Pierre is an arrogant intellectual jerk, who despises the less educated young actress and feels completely superior to her - well, a lesson will be taught to him... It is finally another case of ""hell has no fury as a woman insulted"". Pierre is atrociously unpleasant to Katya and she takes issue with that - trouble will follow... But I will say no more here. Finally, this film reminds us very well another old truth: ""who can understand a woman?"".
