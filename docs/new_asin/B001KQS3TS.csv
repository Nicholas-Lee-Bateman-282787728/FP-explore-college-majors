3668473,5,B001KQS3TS,"Yoga...I've tried several different DVDs and always felt like I didn't ""fit in"".  I'm a little high strung, and not up on the vocab., chants - well, I just felt akward.

I ordered Yoga Fitness after seeing Elise in the new Shape:20 min. makeover (some moves from this are also in the Shape DVD), then I ordered her ballet DVD...I just think she's the best!  Very calming, right on with the cues, and all with a smile =)

On the DVD, there are 3 sections: Yoga Fitness Plus, Lower Body Yoga, Bonus Workouts.  I did the Yoga Fitness Plus with Elise as the trainer. It is one challenging workout!  Elise shows modifications for Level 1, 2 and for advanced Yogis.  She describes the movements while demonstrating in an easy to understand way, throws in vocab for the non-yogi's to pick up on, and gives notice prior to movements in which you may fall...which I did, several times =)BALANCE is a big deal, and not so easy while holding the poses Elise puts you in. You will stretch your muscles in ways never felt before.

I love the bonus workouts!  There are 5 ""mini workouts"" - really only the third & fourth I would consider mini workouts. Side twist, standing bend, back strengthening, sun salutations, tension stretch-neck. The sun salutation segment is impressive, and the standing bend feels awesome!

This is wonderful for those who aren't big yoga fans, however, are intermediate through advanced exercisers.  I highly recommend this DVD, the level of intensity this workout reaches will amaze you.  It's a total body challenge and I look forward to being able to do the entire work out without falling =) ENJOY!!",1242864000,16,1618,4.7188612099644125
3668474,5,B001KQS3TS,"I have had the pleasure of taking Elise's classes in Santa Monica, and she is my favorite Yogi!  She has the greatest spirit and energy, and she really pushes you to do and be your best.  I was amazed that she was able to translate that into a DVD format!  My job takes me away from Santa Monica for 2 weeks out of the month.  I just found this Yoga video by Elise and have been using it daily since it arrived!  I'm so sore!!  She's such a great instructor and offers the BEST Yoga DVD out there.  I have tried 5 different yoga DVDs, and this is the only one that truly gives me the workout I need and crave.  Elise is amazing!!  If you can't make it out to LA for one of her classes (which are totally YO-GAsmic!), this is the next best thing.  It will give you the true feeling of being in a studio.  You can get a real sense of her spirit.  Her 20-minute circuit video is GREAT, too!  I've been using that in addition to this Yoga DVD on days when I have a little extra time.  ELISE IS THE BEST!!",1241568000,8,1000,3.984848484848485
3668475,5,B001KQS3TS,"This is a very intense workout. What I like most is, that its not dated(old yoga). I have not done the other workouts on this other than Yoga Fitness Plus. Honestly, I would be surprised if anyone could after doing this one. Awesome workout.",1241481600,,241,4.5
3668476,5,B001KQS3TS,This is easy to follow and at a moderate pace that can easily be adapted to any level. The segments are challenging with time to modify at your own pace. Clear and Precise instruction.,1235779200,2,184,4.4411764705882355
3668477,5,B001KQS3TS,"I have been practicing yoga for 6 years and am somewhere between the intermediate and advanced level.  I love Bryan Kest (Power 1,2,3) and Mark Blanchard (Sedona Experience, Progressive Power Yoga, and his new set, True Power Yoga) because they kick my butt still to this day.  I found the Yoga Fitness workout on Comcast Exercise TX one day and thought it looked challenging and fun.  I am now ADDICTED to this workout.  I had to have the DVD so ordered that as soon as it became available.  Elise Gulan is adorable, you can't help but like the girl, her cueing is right on, the moves are challenging but feel terrific, and I could go on and on.  I can't recommend this DVD enough - and I've done a LOT of yoga DVDs over the years.
Buy this DVD - you won't regret it.",1233187200,28,768,4.298611111111111
3668478,5,B001KQS3TS,"I feel I can review this because I've done this workout on Fit TV several times.  When I saw it available for sale on DVD I had to pre-order it.  Now I've previewed the clip on Fit TV and aparently this DVD has several workouts included are.
Yoga Fitness Plus Elise Gulan
Lower Body Yoga Tom Morley
Bonus 15 minutes worth of extra workouts with other instructors
Now I've only done the Yoga Fitness Plus workout (my review will focus on that portion of this DVD) and I have to say that I truly enjoyed it.  I normaly don't like yoga DVD's but I truly love Elise's cueing.  It is amazing.  I feel great everytime I do this workout, like all my worries have been stretched and blown away with every deep and relaxing breath.  What I also love about this workout are the variations that she gives you with levels.  You will feel your body working, your core, your legs, you really have to challenge yourself with this workout.  This is by no means an easy workout if you do all the level 2 moves.  I wouldn't even consider it a walk in the park at level 1 but that is what I love about this workout I can feel my muscles lengthening, and strengthening at the same time while the deep and slow breathing really helps keep me focused and relaxed.  I REALLY hope that Elise comes out with other DVD's.  I'd love to see an Intermediate and Advanced Yoga and Ballet.  I also highly reccomend her Ballet Conditioning workout. It is a great overal body workout.",1231372800,12,1451,4.353159851301116
3668492,3,B001KQS3TS,"I ordered this to get some of Elise Gulan's yoga instruction.  There is hardly any of her on this video.  I was definitely disappointed.  The rest of the instructors are fine and I have done the video many times, but she was what I was ordering it for.",1386633600,2,252,4.208333333333333
3668493,4,B001KQS3TS,"Challenging routines. Feels a bit dated, but Elise Guilan is strong, flexible and very inspirational. Her ballet inspired workouts are also recommended, and she definitely works the core. I got a a really great price for this and would recommend.",1384214400,,246,5.175
3668494,3,B001KQS3TS,"Let my start out by saying that my experience of yoga is limited to a collection of DVDs.  I was looking for a yoga workout that would also raise my heart rate a bit (yoga and cardio together, what could be better?)  If you're able to follow it, this DVD delivers.  Unfortunately,  I have a hard time following it.  The instructions are unclear and I find myself having to crane my neck to see what she's doing.",1383264000,,411,4.285714285714286
3668495,5,B001KQS3TS,"I really liked this DVD it is a great work out, hard but good. This is more of an advanced yoga work out.",1372809600,,105,3.608695652173913
3668496,5,B001KQS3TS,"I'm not really into yoga, but I absolutely love Elise Gulan's Yoga Fitness Plus.  Her directions are easy to follow, I love that she includes beginner, intermediate and advance options to the poses and best of all, I love feeling that I did a work out but stretched my muscles at the same time.  I'm horrible about stretching, it bores the pants off of me, but this workout is an amazing compromise.  I just ordered the DVD and I can't wait to get it so I can start adding this to my exercise routine.",1371513600,,501,4.308510638297872
3668497,4,B001KQS3TS,"I received the product this morning, luckily the item itself wasn't damaged. I've learned to never use the free shipping option when one item is not a pre-order as well. Was waiting since the end of March for this to be shipped out.

The workout is overall is fabulous. I'm so happy to have a more convenient yoga workout DVD. I burnt a bit of a sweat :)",1369958400,,354,4.205882352941177
3668498,5,B001KQS3TS,HAve used it twice a week since I received the item. Tried other Yoga DVDs alway go back to this one. It's not easy and this is what i like. Thanks!,1362096000,,148,3.806451612903226
3668499,5,B001KQS3TS,"Greetings - I just hopped on Amazon to order an extra copy of this DVD.  I bought my original back when it first came out - it's getting a little beat up and I don't know how long Exercise TV DVDs will be available...  I've been doing it at least once a week, usually twice (in addition to other workouts) for three years.  I have it memorized, but it's more fun to do w/ Ms. Gulan for company & motivation.  She is insanely strong and flexible.  It is by far my favorite yoga DVD.  So, I figured since I love it (I'm referring to the 45 min. YFP w/ Elise Gulan, by the way) so much that I need a back-up copy, I should really post a review.  This is a VERY challenging, athletic vinyasa flow.  It's as tough as the P90X Yoga & any of the Ultimate Yogi DVDs - just a little shorter.  If you'd like to add yoga to your fitness repertoire, but are hesitant to ""waste"" your valuable workout time - this DVD is for you.  This is not for beginners.",1354233600,,943,4.048648648648649
3668500,3,B001KQS3TS,"I have been practicing yoga now for about 7 years--mostly vinyasa, viniyoga and anusara.  I picked up this DVD so that I could have a good workout at home.  The instructor is pleasant enough but my issues with it are these:

1. ""Level 1"", ""Level 2"" and ""Most Experienced Yogis"" titles she uses throughout the video are misnomers.  Level 1 is definitely not a level one.  In comparison to my yoga classes, this Level 1 is at a much higher level than I was used to.

2. There is no ""mirroring"" for her movement prompts: many exercise dvds have the instructors substitute ""left"" for ""right"" so that you can mirror them in front of the tv.  Elise does not do that so you wind up with your back to the tv a fair amount of the time and have to break concentration to make sure you are following the postures.

3. No modifications for people with weaknesses/injuries.  It is all Level 1, 2, and most experienced. Most instructors and DVD instructors that I have used include modifications for those of us with joint or back issues--particularly with yoga--since it is built on flexibility.

It's an average video, but I much prefer Jillian Michael's Yoga Meltdown for this type of and yoga practice.",1344470400,,1192,4.580188679245283
3668501,5,B001KQS3TS,"Finally an advanced yoga workout! I've been practicing yoga for 10+ years and was getting bored and looking for a challenge.  This dvd is perfect, some sun salutations to keep things flowing but more of a fitness focus.  I wasn't sure I would be able to do the whole workout the first time, but I hung in there and I'm glad I did. I felt like a got a good cardio workout, some good stretching, and lots of strength work especially on the glutes and abs.  The 20 minute buns and thighs workout is also great when I'm pressed for time.  Don't buy this unless you have some yoga experience or it will definitely be too difficult. It's truly amazing that the instructor can do the exercises and talk at the same time; there are no other people on the set, just one hard core yet calm chick!",1339718400,,786,4.29054054054054
3668516,5,B001KQS3TS,"To put it simply, Elise's Yoga Fitness Plus is the best total body yoga exercise routine. Elise is beyond inspiring.

The first time I tried this routine on ExerciseTV, I wasn't able to make it through the whole video. After a couple more failed attempts I decided to buy the DVD, determined to complete it. Now that I've been practicing this flow regularly for years, I still have to work hard to complete all the level 2 variations. I actually find it more enjoyable than the advanced level yoga and pilates classes I regularly attend at the gymn.

This routine produces results. Once I knew the flow well enough to follow the audio without the video, I bought the video for my iphone and continued my practice in hotel rooms when I was on business trips. Elise has helped me build strong, lean muscles. Even when I take a break from regular exercise and then come back to this video, I'm always astounded by its transformative powers and how quickly daily practice will get me bikini ready.

I also want to note that, having read a couple negative reviews, I can't fathom what these reviewers are talking about, I can only imagine that these reviewers weren't in good enough shape to truly appreciate this routine, just like me when I started, but weren't willing to move past that frustration.",1338595200,3,1297,4.655021834061135
3668517,5,B001KQS3TS,"I love this dvd because the flows and vinyasas put together by Elise Gulan really do strengthen and stretch every muscle, even a few you didn't know were weak.  I started working out with Elise and this particular workout a few years ago when I found it on Exercise TV.  Then we moved and my new area didn't carry it.  Finally found the dvd online and thought I'd jump back into it.  I'd been working out a lot and thought I was in good shape.. but starting over with this workout for the first week made me realize just how weak my muscle tone was!  Now, four weeks later, I'm back in shape and many have remarked on my super tone arms and backside!",1334016000,4,650,4.209677419354839
3668518,5,B001KQS3TS,As a regular practioner of yoga I'm always looking for great yoga DVDs to add to my home collection.  I found this one by reading other yoginis recommendations.  They were right! This is a great yoga/cardio workout.  I'm sweating when I'm through!  I will definitely add this DVD to my daily yoga practice!,1330041600,2,306,4.716981132075472
3668519,5,B001KQS3TS,"Advanced yoga video, but can be modified for intermediate level users.  One of my favorite workouts, and I love the lower body yoga with Tom Morley.  I did these 2 workouts online through Exercise TV until they pulled the plug.  So glad it is on video!",1326067200,,252,4.434782608695652
3668520,5,B001KQS3TS,Really enjoying Elise's workout. What a tough and challenging 40 minute plus routine! Also like Tom's 20 minute routine. Both great instructors. I really feel I may give up going to an outside yoga class because I am getting all the benefits of yoga at home with this DVD. Would definitely look for more by these instructors.,1313107200,,325,4.719298245614035
3668521,1,B001KQS3TS,"Looked at what was on the back of the sleeve, and decided it was not the program practice that I was interested in.
I didn't want to take the risk of unwrapping it, and then not liking it, as I would not be able to return it.",1304640000,,225,3.8085106382978724
3668522,3,B001KQS3TS,"I had previously purchased a ballet workout DVD that Elise Gulan made.  Very enjoyable and novel workout since I really haven't ever done ballet, except for a few months as a clumsy 5 year old kid.  So I had high hopes for her yoga DVD.

This DVD was just a workout.  Not yoga.  You might as well go lift weights or do pilates or some other workout.  There was no mind-body stuff going on, no relaxation, no beautiful scenery.  Just a workout.  I probably wouldn't buy it if I had to do it over again.",1304553600,5,501,4.2
3668523,5,B001KQS3TS,"This is one of my most favorite DVDs ever, not just yoga but all work-out DVDs.  Elise Gulan is very encouraging so that you want to try (and hold)even the most difficult poses.  I use it every other day because it makes me feel so good.  The work-out is quite strenuous and challenging but I have noticed my body has changed, especially my core.  Before doing this DVD, I felt weak and old (I'm 48 years old).  Now that I've been using it for 4 months or so, I feel strong, like I did perhaps 20 years ago. I've never been flexible but this routine has changed that.
  At first, I fell quite a bit but kept on trying.  Now, I hardly ever fall.  There is a lot of focus on lower body, which I definitely needed, and you work so hard that cardio is there.  There's another work-out focusing on lower body.  The guy who teaches it is very unintimidating, which I actually liked.  He seemed very human.  The other segments are very short; I hardly ever use them.
  I HIGHLY recommend this DVD to anyone who wants a challenging work-out that's fun, different, and positive.",1273536000,3,1069,4.355329949238579
3668524,5,B001KQS3TS,"I would highly recommend this DVD.  I'm younger and not overweight but I'm fairly new to yoga, exercising, etc, so my balance is pretty bad and I am weak in the upper body and abs.  This DVD has 2 separate workouts with 2 separate instructors.  Both instructors, Tom Morley and Elise Gulan have such a positive spirit and energy that it makes spending time doing the workout that much more enjoyable.  (no sullen-serious faces here)  Tom's workout is great for those days when you don't have much time, but want to get your heart rate up and even break a bit of a sweat.  It is only 20 minutes and it goes by in a flash.  This workout was originally on Exercise. TV as ""Thigh and Buns Yoga"". It includes chair poses, down dogs - lowering yourself down and then back up, temple poses, crescent poses. Even at 20 minutes this workout produces results.  My knees have been feeling great as a result of strengthening my thighs.

The other workout is by Elise Gulan and is 45 minutes.  Elise is so talented that she simultaneously instructs two separate levels (1 and 2) while she is actually doing the workout (by the way, no voice-overs on either workout).  I am able to complete the workout doing about 70% of the level 1 moves.  Some of the poses are so challenging for the balance and flexibility that I am just physically unable to do them yet, but it is great because it gives you something to work for. This workout goes by really fast as well because of the flow of the different segments. For example, just when your arms feel like they are going to fall off, she switches to more lower body poses.

I would say that the 20-minute is more of a beginner to intermediate workout and the 45-minute is more of an intermediate to advanced level. Both workouts are just one person in a simple room doing the workout and instructing you at the same time.",1265587200,5,1852,4.443786982248521
3668525,1,B001KQS3TS,"I got this video because all the reviews were so good.  I was so disappointed because I didn't like this video at all.  There is only one person to watch and she spends what seems like 85% of her time in downward facing dog.  I thought I would keep the video for the 20 minute workout with a different instructor, but I've never seen such sloppy yoga in my life!  Although he would remind you to breath properly, he was huffing and puffing like he was doing a cardio routine.  The set is plain and dull and the music doesn't do much either.  I exercise with different videos and dvd's everyday without fail so I feel like I know what I'm talking about.  This video will not motivate you toward regular exercise.
I have donated this video to my local library.",1244678400,4,758,4.333333333333333
8315876,5,B001KQS3TS,"I bought this DVD bc I love Elise in the Shape Magazine DVD. I'm such an advocate of her practices that I had to buy and see how her yoga is. I would definitely say this is more of a Fitness yoga, not a relaxing zen type. The music is not calming nor serene, and it's got a timer running. However, Elise kicks your butt in such a delightful and challenging way.  It incorporates a lot of vinyasa movement and poses with a fitness flow. It is challenging! and fantastic. I always feel so strong after. Never gets old and I get a good sweat and stretch.  Love Her!",1483574400,,562,4.146788990825688

8315880,5,B001KQS3TS,"I love this video. I used to do it off Exercise TV all the time. Bought it and forgot how tough it is! I'm a ten year yogi and consider myself somewhere between intermediate and advanced and this leaves me hurting (in that good way). Works every inch of your body, abs and glutes in particular. I am not a savasana type of girl so I like that this video doesn't have one. It's just a constant flow for 45 mins. Elise is adorable and very encouraging with her prompts and instructions. Time flies the more you do it. I also enjoy the 20 minute lower body segment on this DVD. Great to do when short on time. I often do it after a weight training upper body session.
