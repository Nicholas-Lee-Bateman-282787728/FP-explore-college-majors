2447851,5,B000BYRCFQ,I'm a big fan of the whole AMERICAN EXPERIENCE series and an avid TR fan. I consider this a great history video. Very informative and entertaining.,1200268800,13,147,4.6923076923076925
2447852,5,B000BYRCFQ,"Easily my favorite in the American Experience presidential series, this biography of Theodore Roosevelt is informative, enlightening, challenging, touching, and even inspirational. Narrated with gusto by the late TR buff, Jason Robards, and featuring interviews with noted Roosevelt historians and key family members, this is an exciting journey through the life of the first modern American president.

At no point in covering TR's life is there necessity to spice things up or add color. His story is a dizzying, wild ride that parallels the expansion of the nation, its influence, and its lifestyles from the Gilded Age of the Second Industrial Revloution to the War to End All Wars. Roosevelt was a precocious asthmatic child with insatiable curiosity and a love of taxidermy; a boxer at Harvard; a state legislator; rancher; sheriff; nationally respected naval historian; big game hunter and authoritative ornitholgist; a reformist New York City police commissioner; the Assistant Secretary of the Navy; a heroic volunteer colonel in the Spanish American War; Governor of New York; Vice President; and (upon the assassination of William McKinley) the youngest man ever to become President. All before his 43rd birthday!

You owe it to yourself to view this film and learn from the life of this incredible human being who was described as ""a steam engine in trousers."" He was a bit eccentric at times but he was NEVER boring. His life is certainly motivation to take life by the horns and live it to the fullest.",1139875200,71,1516,5.158536585365853
2447853,5,B000BYRCFQ,"American Experience documentaries are always stellar efforts and this is no exception. The magnificent life of TR is told is painstaking detail and everything is beautifully photographed and arranged. When the film details TR's childhood asthma, they photograph a small boy, meant to be TR, in a darkened room, as the wind batters the curtains. It's an ethereal moment and makes the viewer think they are in the room with Roosevelt.
TR's entire life is depicted, with generous amounts of time being spent on his early years in New York. But the majority of the program is rightly devoted to TR in the period 1898-1909, where he went from Rough Rider to President. His private side is illuminated and one realizes he was a fascinating, though sometimes infuriating man; stubborn, headstrong, yet brilliant. It's all here: his ability to speak languages, his amazing memory, the fact he read a book every day, his passion for the outdoor life, his years at Harvard. His romances are here as well, including his early passion for eventual wife Edith, whom he threw over for his first wife, Alice. She died on the same day as TR's mother, and this dual blow is examined in detail.
This is a gorgeous film, photographed with care and produced with exquisite flair. If you're not especially interested in Roosevelt, you will be after viewing this documentary. If you are already a fan of TR, this will make you love him all the more.",1059782400,6,1427,4.804878048780488

2447864,5,B000BYRCFQ,"Very enlightening story...packed with facts and trivial info on Teddy....or...""TR"", as he preferred to be called.

He was truly one of our greatest presidents...Determined beyond belief. He did more to shpe our country than any otge president...before or after.  He most definately was the peoples president.......Even tho he was born into great wealth....he chose to achieve his success on his own....and mixed with the working class and avoided the aloof rich.

Even tho he was a Republican...by party....he was no Conservative.......He leaned heavily to the Liberal attitude and fought for the working class......He had no use, or respect for the lazy... or corrupt.

I would recommend this film very highly.......and watching it once...is just not enough.....You will want to rewatch it...to see what you missed the first viewing.",1413676800,,834,5.4921875

2447867,5,B000BYRCFQ,"The American Experience program on the life of Theodore Roosevelt is a very commendable treatment of the life and times of this important figure in American politics and history. While we will probably not agree with very thing Roosevelt did and every position he took, we cannot but see the importance of this man's life in our country's history. While TR's promotion of the Spanish American War was probably overall unfortunate, his work on conservation and the national parks system is a clear triumph. The program moves along well and gives a fairly balanced portrait of an important figure in our country's history.",1408233600,2,620,5.029126213592233
2447868,5,B000BYRCFQ,"Probably the majority of Americans have some knowledge of who Theodore Roosevelt was but what they may know of him is limited to just a few things. Taking part in the Spanish-American war with the charge up San Juan Hill might be the one thing he is most remembered for. He might also be remember by some for the phrase ""speak softly and carry a big stick"" and some might even remember he is one of the faces on Mount Rushmore. But as the PBS series ""American Experience: TR: The Story Of Teddy Roosevelt"" shows there was a lot more to the man then just being the youngest person to become president of the United States.

This documentary shows how dynamic Roosevelt was as President and how over a hundred years after he left the White House his policies and political decisions are still benefitting the United States today. His battles with big business and breaking up the trusts, working for child labor laws, helping to create the Panama Canal and his greatest gift to America the establishment of our National Parks system. He was a republican who battled his own party as much as he battled the democrats. He was a man who spoke his mind and backed them up with action. An avid reader as well as a writer, he wrote over 30 books in his lifetime, it is mentioned in the documentary that Roosevelt might have been the most intellectual person to become president since Thomas Jefferson and after watching ""TR"" I would tend to agree with that. I thought I knew a lot about the man until I watched this documentary and learned there was a lot more aspects to the man then I realized.

The documentary is on one DVD and about 4 hours in length broken up into four chapters. Each chapter looks at in order the events from his life. Chapter one deals with Teddy from his birth in 1858 to 1901 when then Vice-President Roosevelt suddenly becomes President with the assassination of William McKinley. The interesting part to this chapter is learning how this robust President was a sickly boy with a serious case of asthma who many thought would not make it to adulthood.

Chapter two is from 1901 to 1904, Roosevelt's first term in office upon taking over the Presidency. It was during this time Roosevelt would take on the big companies and their trusts, fighting for the American laborers. Chapter three deals from 1905 to 1908, Teddy's second term in office. It was during this time he would start the Panama canal, develop what would become our National Parks system and his work to bring a peace agreement to end the 1905 war between Russia and Japan that would earn him the Nobel Peace Prize.

Chapter four looks at Roosevelt's life after the Presidency from 1909 to 1919 when he died. It looks at how he helped to get his friend William Howard Taft elected President in 1908 and how disappointed Roosevelt would become at seeing how Taft was leading the country. By 1912 Roosevelt had seen enough and decided to seek the Republican nomination for President. This would cause a riff in the party as Roosevelt tried to take the Republican nomination away from a sitting president as well as a former friend. When he didn't get his party's nomination the documentary then shows how Roosevelt would help form the Progressive party and run in 1912 as a third party candidate. Roosevelt would of course not win the election but he would also cause Taft not to win a second term allowing Woodrow Wilson to become President. After the election of 1912 the documentary looks Roosevelt's life as he went on hunting expeditions in Africa and then South America, where he also most his life in the Amazon. It also looks at how Roosevelt tried to get the United States to become involved in the first world war, known at that time as the Great War, when it started and how glad he was once the U.S. did finally enter the war. But that war would take its toll on him as Teddy proudly watched one son after the other go off to fight in the war and to then know the heartache of losing his youngest in battle.

Whether you are a history buff or not you owe it to yourself to watch this documentary. Teddy Roosevelt may have only been President from 1901 to 1909 but the impact of those years in the White House even way back then still effect us Americans today. I very highly recommend this DVD.",1407283200,2,4288,4.534883720930233

2447874,5,B000BYRCFQ,"How can you not love a terrific American character narrated by Academy Award winner Jason Robards?

2447877,4,B000BYRCFQ,"I liked this video.  It was both informative and entertaining.  I still believe the US would have been better off had TR won the election of 1912 and 1916.  I believe he could have negotiated an end to World War I as he did the Russo - Japanese war of 1904-5.  Had he been able to do so , the world might have been spared the Bolshevic revolution in Russia and the rise of Hilters Nazi party in Germany.  Alas we will never know unless someone developes a time machine.
  Think about that thought the next time you elect a president.  Nov of 2012 might be another critical year as was 1912.  Let's not make the same mistake again as the people did in 1912 by electing the idiotic professor, Woodrow Wilson.

2447878,5,B000BYRCFQ,"This is a most comprehensive collection of information regarding Theodore Roosevelt.  He was a fascinating  man, an adventurer and a man of action.  He was also a bit of a war monger.  You learn about his childhood of asthma and the belief that his parents feared he would never reach adulthood.  This President was a strong motivator and worked hard until he was able to overcome his weak body.  He loved this country and was intent upon making the lives of the average man better.  He was also an avid hunter and his home at Sagamore Hill is filled with the heads of wild animals he had killed.  An odd thing that struck me was the head of a wild animal in his wife's white and pink pristine parlor.  It just did not seem to belong, there and I wondered why she didn't protest such a sight among her feminine things.  The video is all too short, but it gives a fascinating look into the life of a unique and independent individual who was a real American icon.",1336262400,,962,4.353932584269663

2447882,5,B000BYRCFQ,"I purchased these DVDs to learn more about each of the president's domestic and social policies.  The ones that I have watched so far have been excellent and it has given me a better understanding of their personal character.  It shows how their visions of the country is based on the presidents background and how Congress (especially the Southern Democrats) stymied passage of important Presidential legislation which could have had major and positive impact in race relations sooner and other important issues that affect us all.

TR is interesting especially after having watched FDR and then Eleanor Roosevelt. For a Republican, TR was very progressive and you can understand why FDR and Eleanor respected him.",1216339200,6,715,5.2

Sickly as a child, ranching in South Dakota restored his health and taught him respect for natural resources. He designated 5 National Parks, 18 National Monuments and 150 National Forests.
