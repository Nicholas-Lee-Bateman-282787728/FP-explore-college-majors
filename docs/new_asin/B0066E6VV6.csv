4962125,5,B0066E6VV6,"A better film than critics reviewed.
James Franciscus is excellent here, and in the scenes with Genvieve Page  he and she explode wih sexual chemistry. Her acting is a good reason to own this film, and to see Mary Astor in a late film, wonderfiully showing how to act on screen.
Suzanne Pleshette should have had big oles and this film shows wjhy..she, like Angie Dickenson, were given little to work with, but here Suzanne Pleshette works and delivers a nuanced performance that is close to the high water mark of her rival, Genvieve Page.

The co-stars are superb, as they continually give the sense of the decadence of the publishing world, the usual compromises, but also too the hatreds that fester and reek havoc on Fransiscus as he begins his roller coaster ride as a new novelist. This the sort of film he was so famous for..uncovering the evil and making adultry, not a big deal in 1964 films, cause death and chaos of all varieties throughout the film.
Delmar Daves directed a lot of Warner Bros. coming-of-age films that are fun but dated, but here he's in his intelligent element again. See this and be amazed at the truths it tells. And Genvieve Page..a marvel as always. The last 20 minutes..unbelievable.",1394668800,,1219,4.71830985915493
4962126,5,B0066E6VV6,"...very biased as I am due to being a James Franciscus and Suzanne Pleshette fan, and having loved the novel, but perhaps more due to having gotten this film under my skin back when it came out. It's from an era of American drama film production that starts to push the envelope a bit, no longer prudish, but not over the top- when classiness still was part of the American landscape, complete with it's fakes, backstabbers and authentics.",1391904000,2,439,4.641025641025641
4962127,5,B0066E6VV6,"The opening scenes was filmed in my hometown of Jenkins, Kentucky. It had a great story line and the actors were perfect for the part.",1388707200,,134,4.4
4962128,5,B0066E6VV6,The movie is simple but yet the actor's are not...they shine and with a hot stud like James you can't go wrong....so sad he died at such an early age...he could have done so much more...,1374796800,3,186,4.194444444444445
4962129,5,B0066E6VV6,It's all about Suzanne for me; but it's a good solid morality tale. Novelists were huge pillars of the culture in the 1950's and a little beyond.,1365811200,,145,4.407407407407407
4962130,5,B0066E6VV6,"This movie is timeless. Great storyline and acting.  James Franciscus was one of my favorite stars.
Suzanne Pleshette had a smoldering sexuality and also had a great acting talent.",1365379200,,180,5.206896551724138
4962131,3,B0066E6VV6,"Yes, ""trashier"" -- a failure to go completely over the top makes this film at best moderately enjoyable, rather than gloriously entertaining in the way only a full-blown Hollywood melodrama can be. Filming in B&W was a mistake, as this sort of story absolutely needs that wonderfully oversaturated Technicholor of the late 1950s, making everything look both larger than life & waxily artificial. It feels as if the film doesn't quite know which way it wants to go: a gritty portrait of a dog-eat-dog social world, or a shameless wallow in shallow excess. Because, let's face it, the latter is what makes this sort of movie so much fun!

Still, there's good work to recommend here. James Franciscus isn't afraid to make his character a hard-edged, self-involved cad, perhaps not quite as naive as everyone else around him seems to think. He knows what he wants (or thinks he does) & goes after it relentlessly. And you can't go wrong with a dependable character actor like Edward Andrews, who brings a smarmy, slimy joie de vivre to his role as an acerbic literary critic; this sort of role is a speciality of his that's always a bright spot. Suzanne Pleshette has a somewhat more thankless role as the long-suffering good girl, but she still manages to give it an added sexiness without any effort.

I'll admit to having a certain soft spot in my heart (or head) for this film, which I saw as a young boy in the 1960s. Seeing it with an adult's eyes decades later forces me to admit that it's probably more of a rental for many prospective viewers. Recommended for those who like melodrama, but with some reservations.",1349222400,7,1618,4.713780918727915
4962132,4,B0066E6VV6,"I love the book ""Youngblood Hawke"", and have always wanted to see the film. When it became available on DVD on Amazon I decided to order it, despite a tad of nervousness about the recording being made on DVD-R recordable media, as I just hoped it would play on my DVD player.

However, my concerns were all for naught. The DVD played beautifully, and I was finally able to see this old film in its entirety with great picture and sound quality.

The film itself was a bit disappointing as Hollywood took a lot of liberties with the story, and they also ruined the ending. It certainly would make a good mini-series for TV, and I hope someone will do that at some point in the future.",1344038400,12,683,4.3700787401574805

8493902,5,B0066E6VV6,"Youngblood Hawke was released in 1964. It starred James Franciscus, with great support from Mary Astor. A soap opera supreme of a writer and the women he loved. Fans of James Franciscus will like this the most.",1505692800,,210,4.702702702702703
8493903,4,B0066E6VV6,"I enjoyed this movie.  I liked the relationship more between the young, best selling author, Youngblood Hawke, and his editor.  His affair with a married woman and mother of two , brazenly carried out by the writer and his mistress,  came to it's natural horrible conclusion, affecting her children and in the revenge of her husband.  Although he manages to clean himself up, the consequences remained heavy on this viewers mind.",1505520000,,429,5.0

8493910,5,B0066E6VV6,"I remember being very young when I first saw this movie.  I never read the novel but I am sure the movie is just a fragment of the book.  What holds this movie together is the great cast of character actors and leads.  They just don't make them like this anymore.  It also is in glorious black and white.  The films theme music is very good. First class entertainment from Warner Bros Studios.
I have a big selection of
DVDs and I pull this one off the shelf frequently to watch.",1396656000,,479,4.21978021978022
