5169828,5,B008MILL7I,"Vintage Willis is what I heard in another review and that is exactly what these films amount to. Damn if these action films were not 10x better than they are today. Much more original in many ways.

Of course this is action and humor mixed together. Boy Scout is simply one of my favorite films. A few unrealistic kills, the good guys win, and maybe too many great jokes but honestly I would not have it any other way. I am serious film fan and these ones never cease to cause enjoyment. They simply don't make buddy pics like TLBS anymore. Screenplay is F'ing WICKED funny. Makes the new Die Hards look so damn bad. Seriously, modern action films pale in comparison for the most part. This is one hilarious film to boot.

LMS is also great, more violent, arty, and still a pretty damn good film. Based on an old Japanese tale it really sets up its characters and setting like few films do. So don't expect Shakespeare but do expect to be very entertained. The cinematography is excellent.

16 Blocks is the only one presented in lossy audio but it doesn't seem to be that bad. An actually pretty good film as well. Willis is a down on his luck cop in a sea of corruption with an informant he must protect or give up. A lot of suspense. Some parts a little unrealistic but still a solid film in the genre.

On to the transfers: For being on one disc they both average around 22Mbps which is good not great but it clearly does the job. You haven't ever seen these films look this good despite the fact much attention was NOT paid to these releases.

Considering huge films like Batman Begins are STILL being sold with transfers around 13Mbps these are quite capable if nothing to write home about. It could have been better but this is cheap as heck IF you buy used and you can't go wrong here. I got it for 10 bucks and in perfect condition. Enjoy.",1368748800,5,1848,4.344927536231884
5169829,2,B008MILL7I,"Details for this product are incorrect.  The number of discs is two.  ""16 Blocks"" is on one blu-ray disc.  ""Last Boy Scout"" and ""Last Man Standing"" are combined on the second disc.  The two discs come in a two-disc blu-ray hardcase.  Do not order this set and expect separate blu-ray discs for the three movies.  I am returning mine.",1360886400,6,333,4.559322033898305
5169830,4,B008MILL7I,I was willing to pay $10 for one movie but this was a way better deal and the supply was sent right away. Good Job.,1359936000,,115,3.64

5169833,5,B008MILL7I,"This product is worth the price simply for ""16 Blocks."" It's the best Bruce Willis movie you've never seen, and I give it 5 stars. ""Last Man Standing"" would get 3.5, and ""The Last Boy Scout,"" 3. I paid about $10.00 for this product, and it's easily worth the price.",1484438400,,265,4.32

5169836,4,B008MILL7I,"I love all these movies, I was searching for The Last Boyscout when I found this trio. The quality is what you would expect on an old movie converted to  blu ray, its a bit grainy and the sound is a bit off the voices are low and the action is loud but with a few adjustments to your settings you can fix it. Overall great deal for 3 great movies.",1450569600,,347,3.887323943661972

5169841,4,B008MILL7I,"This isn't really a review, but as I found the product description lacking, I decided to compile this list of helpful information below. I hope this will be useful for prospective buyers to know what they're getting:

THE LAST BOY SCOUT (1991): 105 minutes - Director: Tony Scott - Starring: Bruce Willis, Damon Wayans - Genre: Action, comedy - Plot: A down and out cynical detective teams up with a down and out ex-quarterback to try and solve a murder case involving a pro football team and a politician. R

LAST MAN STANDING (1996): 101 minutes - Director: Walter Hill - Starring: Bruce Willis, Bruce Dern - Genre: Action, Crime - Plot: A drifting gunslinger-for-hire finds himself in the middle of an ongoing war between the Irish and Italian mafia in a Prohibition era ghost town. R

16 BLOCKS (2006): 105 minutes - Director: Richard Donner - Starring: Bruce Willis, Mos Def - Genre: Crime, action - Plot: An aging cop is assigned the ordinary task of escorting a fast-talking witness from police custody to a courthouse. There are however forces at work trying to stop prevent them from making it. PG-13

Now let's crunch some numbers. This collection costs $14.21, and contains 3 films. To find the value of the individual film you're getting, we divide the price by the number of films to get an individual price of $4.73 per film, a good price for this thrill-packed and smart set of Bruce Willis actioners! I hope this information is useful to you. Cheers!",1418947200,,1466,4.737254901960784
