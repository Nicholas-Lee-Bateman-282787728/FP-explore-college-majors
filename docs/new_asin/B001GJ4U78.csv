This movie looks like some 7th graders got together and decided to make a movie in their backyard.  Total piece of crap!  Not even worth a rental!!  A real floating turd of a movie.

Try Googling a trailer for this movie and see what I'm talking about.  Then maybe you will avoid making a GRAVE MISTAKE by buying or renting this movie!

BOGUS 5 STAR REVIEWS:
The last reviewer, Benjamin, admits he worked on the movie and I found out the second to the last reviewer ""Monica Dominguez"" is really Maria Diaz, who Also worked on the movie!!  And Zombie guy, most likely also worked on this crap, since this movie was the only review he has.  And the other 5 star reviewer admits he was drunk when he saw it!!  Seriously.... There are no real 5 star reviews on here!  (the first reviewer who gave it 5 stars obviously has some sort of mental deficiency since he thought it was made to be funny, when it reality it is just soooo bad, you have to laugh)",1228953600,6,1057,4.287878787878788

3611473,2,B001GJ4U78,"It didn't take long to see that most of the negative reviews here were correct. I'm sorry but those reviewers that claimed the acting was decent should be banned from movie theaters henceforth. I realize that  judging movies is totally subjective but if you thought the acting in this movie was decent you're watching the wrong subject.  Personally,  I watched the entire film because there was 3 star gore and because the director chose to make the zombies move slowly. Kudos! One of the stars i ultimately  gave the movie was for this very decision.. I hate movies that have fast moving zombies - they have DECAYING flesh gor godsakes - I can give  only so much suspension of disbelief).. I guess I watched too much ""Six Feet Under"".  Finally, I watched the entire film for the same reason one can't take their eyes away from a train wreck, and the train wreck in this movie was the actor who portrayed the villanous father of one of the kids (Or stepfather, it was uncclear). Regardless he brutally whipped the kid with a belt very early in the film quickly establishing the character as an unforgivable fiend. Despite this plot point specically included for this very character, the actor proceeded to dart his eyes rapidlly back and forth for the remainder of the movie. This melodramatic device went out of style with Snidely Whiplash in the silent movies. Further, why he believed changing his voice to sound as if he had gargled with gravel made him somehow more evil is beyond me but nevertheless it was a ""so bad it was good"" thing that kept me watching the film. Shame on the director for allowing this hambone any where near this movie; worse giving him so many damn closeups. We see his darting evil eyes, yes, yes, he's a bad guy, we know, we know, get on with it dude.  I gave the second star for the makeup. It was quite good, and the director  gave a nod to Greg Nicotero, head of makeup for ""The Walking Dead"" by naming the TV announcer character Tom Nicotero.",1480118400,3,1978,4.552112676056338

3611485,3,B001GJ4U78,"Scott Darling's GRAVE MISTAKE glories in ripped latex skin and ersatz blood splurting by the gallon.
Zombie heads explode in creative ways, the living join the dead, and predictable flashes of irony
abound. We've been here before; it's familiar but enjoyable ground for gore picture aficionados.

""How much farther to the armory, Mike?"" is cue for the wagon's gas tank to go dry. A trot among the
living dead, including one zombie in top hat and overcoat, leads to the standard close encounters
with a cannibal, or several. Pow, bang, goosh, sploosh, etc.

Holed up for the moment in an abandoned hardware store, our little group of intrepid humans search
for weapons to do battle with the creepazoids outside, all but comic relief Stephen Eckles (as foul-
mouthed redneck, Karl King), who manages to get it on with two plastic funnels.

A quick glance at GRAVE MISTAKE's IMDb page reveals both its anemic 3.1 viewer rating and who
among these characters lives or takes a trip to Zombieville, but on the latter, why spoil the fun?",1448928000,,1030,4.840909090909091

But HONEST TO GOODNESS....this is a LOT OF FUN to watch. Absolutely absurd storyline but typical of the zombies take over the world scenario. To call this a labor of love is an understatement. This is all done by just a few people...basically Seth and Shawn Darling. All the special effects, makeup, writing, filming...it's all them. I know people that do this kind of film on digital and know the work involved. This has the proper mix of horror and comedy that make for great ""suspension of disbelief"" movies. Yeah...it's cheesy. The acting is amateur at best. But THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS FUN! Having the mentally challenged ""Zombie Expert"" be one of the first victims and the means of his death...hilarious! Ren-Faire knight fighting the zombies with sword and armor, the prerequisite sweet couple getting eaten...all the classic must haves in terrible zombie movies. The actors give it EVERYTHING they have and it really does show. The mix of desert town...Ren-Faire...Zombies, giant Roadrunners, hell...this is GREAT! Just relax and have some fun with it.

3611496,3,B001GJ4U78,"...that's what I would call this little no-budget flic.  If you liked Townies (which I did, I own that one as well), you should be able to appreciate this.  You can tell it's a labor of love, in that someone wanted to make this movie and wasn't about to let a little thing like money get in the way... the acting is quite horrible, but it felt intentionally over-the-top.  There was a scene where a girl has just been ripped into by zombies... and as she's laying there, quite dead, you can clearly see her blink...  Not once, but twice!  Priceless!  There is a seemingly random medieval fest which does tie into the story later on, and works fairly well.  The abusive redneck dad is hilarious!  I couldn't help but laugh, even when he's beating his kid.  Something about his face, the expressions he makes throughout the whole movie.  Oh man, has to been seen!  As ridiculous as the whole story was, I found myself actually rooting for the characters.  The effects are not bad, I have seen far worse.  I would rate them a notch or two below The Walking Dead's CGI fx.  And what is TWD's budget compared to this movie?

So yeah, the crew that made this obviously worked their butts off to put out the best film they could.  And I might add, this held my attention from start to finish (something I cannot say for Walking Dead, sorry).  Not worth full price, but I got this as part of a $5 horror dvd (10 films, including Gingerdead Man 3, lol).",1400284800,5,1444,4.388679245283019

3611519,5,B001GJ4U78,"Okay let's be honest. This is not a 5 star movie sober. Unless you have some sort of buzz working, please don't attempt to watch this film.

The movie was written, produced, directed, and edited by Shawn Darling. He (I think it is a he.) also did the camera, special make-up, wrote and performed the musical score, and scouted the location. It stars Seth Darling- go figure.

This movie is on the order of ""Redneck Zombies"" but perhaps not quite as ""good"". A man dumps chemicals, which look a lot like window washer onto a cemetery out in the dessert. The label claims they are chemicals, but the movie shows them as biological agents. Somehow this creates legions of zombies that appear out of nowhere. In town, James Blackburn plays an auto-mechanic. Phil, his assistant is the village idiot who speaks with a lisp and maybe even some kind of Australian accent. Phil has written a manual on how to combat and survive the undead. (Plot spoiler: He gets eaten early in the film.) Meanwhile there is also a small Renaissance Fair going on out in the middle of nowhere. Vehicles seem to die when zombies are around and the cranking noise, that of a vehicle that won't start, doesn't match the visual of the turning of the key. The acting is bad by design (I think). At one point our group of people is fighting their way through zombies armed with a pipe, tire jacket, and an umbrella (not one of those with a large point, but one that folds in half).

If you are a lover of Ed Wood movies, check it out. If you love films with good acting and plot, don't bother. This film would make a top MST-3000 movie.",1291334400,5,1604,4.448979591836735

8305539,5,B001GJ4U78,"This movie's all over the place in the beginning!  But please stick with it- it's awesome!  Warning- my review has a bunch of SPOILERS!

First we see a man yelling at what seems to be his wife or himself when he dumps fluid on a mound of dirt in a field.  Then we see a happy cop who's either slow or mocking the horror genre with his fake super excited demeanor.  He reads an undead instructional survivalist manual that he made.  Then we see a father (the same guy who dumped fluid on the dirt) sleeping in the living room with his hand in his pants and a dirty mag in his other hand.  His son walks through the front door, wakes up his dad so he smacks his son around (perhaps due to embarrassment).  Then we see a man who resembles Eddie Vedder in a convenience store having war flashbacks.  We then see a costume party in a field with people dancing strangely, swinging swords around and wearing werewolf masks while pleasant Renaissance-style muisc plays.  Then we see a mother arguing with her son over a noise he's making with his ball toy while they're at the auto repair shop.  The boy's name is Woody and he dares his mom to smack him since the father is out of the picture.

Woody and the guy who wrote the undead survivalist manual have a discussion outside with another kid nearby who mentions his stepdad.  The guy who looks like Eddie Vedder is named Mike, and he calls the 3 of them inside the auto shop.  They find out on TV people are attacking other people.  It started in a small neighborhood then spread to bigger areas.  The survivalist book writer thinks it's zombies.  Now we see a cowboy driving his daughter in the country.  They see zombies approaching as their truck won't start.  They take a moment to drink alcohol despite the danger which is hilarious.  They drive home and the daughter gets surrounded by zombies.  She smacks them with something before karate kicking them.  The one zombie grabs her foot and pushes it in.  She walks into the house as a zombie.  The father shoots but fails to kill them all.

We now see a young man and his girlfriend driving in the desert.  He pulls over, drops to one knee and proposes to her with the cheesiest poem ever.  ""From the moment my eyes met yours, I knew the kind hands of fate had touched the hard fibers of my life and the stars were smiling down upon my humble soul"".  LOL!  She says ""What?"" and he replies with ""Will you marry me?"" She understands that.  ""Yes!""  As he squeezes the ring on her hand, zombies come up from behind and bite blood and flesh off the woman's neck and arms.  He waits for them to finish their meal then runs to the car and returns smacking them with a golf club-like sword.  He continues the poem.  ""The stars no longer dwell in the envy of your beauty"".  He then looks to the sky and says ""I must avenge thee!""  LOL!  This is incredibly funny no kidding!

The guy who beat his kid earlier drives up to the auto shop.  Mike says ""Have you hit any kids lately?"" and the guy replies ""What did you say to me?""  Mike says ""Oh nothing I'm just talking to my car"".  Mike and the mother of that bratty Woody kid watch the TV.  It's another zombie update.  Vandals dumped a highly contagious and toxic substance in the graveyard according to the news reporter.  The guy who beat his kid looks around guilty since he's the one to blame for the toxic substance.  The kid beater and Mike the mechanic get into a fight when Mike accidentally punches Woody's mom who jumps between the two.

The guy who wrote the survivalist book says it's time to act like rational adults.  Through the garage window he sees zombies walking around.  He recommends cutting out their brain or cutting off their head.  He says zombies don't like fire either.  Mike doesn't believe these are zombies.  Just then the zombies eat the guy who wrote the undead survivalist book by walking in and grabbing him.  They rip his body open until there's nothing but blood splashing around and his head to spare.  Mom wakes up from the punch.  When asked what happened the kid beater guy says ""Mike got tired of your sh and popped you one!""  Mike runs outside and hot wires a car while zombies smack the car windows.  The whole group runs to the car but a zombie grabs Woody's leg and munches away.  The zombie won't let go, and nobody in the car is willing to help.  Another guy in the car smacks the zombie with the survivalist book.  The boy's now a zombie and bites the other kid in the car.  Mike pulls out a gun an blows his brains out.  The mom... doesn't even react.  At least not right away.  I guess she didn't really love him after all, haha!  Okay she finally reacts by smacking Mike a moment later and asking why he killed her son.

The kid beater guy grabs the mom and bashes her head into the glove box which ticks off Mike prompting him to smack the guy in the nose.  I think I'd rather take my chances with the zombies than be with these wild people, lol.  Pretty piano and violin music plays.  They grab some weapons, exit the vehicle and smack the zombies.  The mom waits for a zombie to put an umbrella handle in his mouth so she can hit the button that opens it, which results in the umbrella opening and the zombies head exploding.  They chain themselves inside a nearby clothing store.  The mom and other kid pretend they're playing swords.  Obviously this is what mother's do after losing their sons!  The wife beater plays with the faucets hanging on the wall.  He pretends he's showering his armpits with the shower heads and drinking from the faucets.  Sensible Mike doesn't fool around- he grabs his tools and leaves.  The wife beater places red hats over his breasts and crotch.  Woody's mom grabs a chainsaw and says ""I got what I need, let's go!""

Mike suggests resting, as does the kid beater.  Woody's mom says to the kid beater ""Shut up you p""  LOL!  Mike teaches the boy how to break an arm and he says ""I can't wait to show my mom!""  Mike asks the mom how she's doing.  She says ""I just watched you blow away my son!"" but realizes the zombie would have won so he had to do it.  Mike mentions his war days and accidentally setting a tripline in the wrong place and killing his team.  While this is going on pleasant music plays and the zombies are quiet.  The boy sees a black employee of the store named George using the toilet.  The boy explains there's a zombie outbreak going on outside but he doesn't believe the boy until he forces George to look out the window.  They're all headed to the armory.  George walks by the kid beater and says ""He ain't worth the s on my shoe!""

The kid beater gets the boy alone, pushes him into a wall and says ""I'll teach you to disrespect me!"" Just then a zombie grabs him.  Mike blows the zombie's head off.  Mike warns the kid beater for the last time not to cause any problems.  It's now nighttime.  The group leaves the store and runs down the street fighting zombies by smacking them with poles and sticks.  Chainsaws too of course.  They take cover in another building.  Here a guy is dressed up as a knight.  I guess this is the guy who proposed to his wife earlier.  Mike asks what's up with the knight to the other guy hiding here with his wife.  He says he doesn't know but he's a good fighter.  The group turns around and sees zombies coming through the back doors.  The knight warns ""Thy must get the lady to safety!"" in relation to the guy's wife, something the knight wasn't able to do earlier.  The guy's wife gets bit before the zombies get to the husband.  Wow, before that man got bit he wasn't lying!  That knight can handle himself very well with that sword.

The knight tries to break down a steal doorknob but can't do it.  He says ""The stones of this keep are much too strong for my steal"".  The zombies approach and kill George.  They pick apart his back and even share his body parts with each other.  Mike and everyone else run to a back room with the wife who was bit by a zombie. They wonder what to do and think about cutting her arm off.  The kid beater recommends slamming the woman's arm in the door and it'll come off.  They agree that for once in his life he came up with a brilliant idea.  They slam the door into her arm while the kid beater says ""Hit 'er harder, hehehe!""  Eventually the arm flies off.

The knight guides them all to the car outside.  They decide who should go.  The knight concludes he should go since he's the most experienced with his battle training.  He can't believe he dropped his sword because he's admirable.  Looks like the sword flung in the air from my view, lol.  The kid beater guy volunteers to go after the car after the knight is killed.  When he gets there he tries to drive away leaving everyone behind like a typical scumbag.  The engine stalls, and a zombie literally pulls his head off and munches on the attached spine.  Good job!  That guy was horrible!

Mike teaches the kid how to fire a gun before he leaves.  Suddenly the woman with the removed arm comes to life... as a zombie.  The kid bashes the top of her head with a TV set.  The mother and kid leave.  While walking down the hallway they see a zombie breast feeding her skeleton baby in a dark nursery room.  Now THAT'S scary!  Mike comes back... and says he's infected.  A zombie scratched his arm.  Mike says he loves Woody's mom an they kiss... and he bites her mouth off.  Ew!  The kid with the gun says ""Stay back!  Don't make me shoot you!""  He blows a hole through Mike's head and runs from the zombies coming behind.

The kid runs outside and sneaks around until morning.  The kid's all alone.  Can't believe HE of all people is the sole survivor!  He was such a small character in the beginning when mentioning his stepdad to Woody and the survivalist book writer, but my has he grown.  He walks up to a building and observes the damage created by the zombies.  He walks to a farmhouse until he's forced to run from a zombie dog.  At first I thought that thing was a cow!  This is the kid's house.  His walks inside and sees his mom is now a zombie.  He blows her brains out.  The dog zombie approaches and it's very clearly just a puppet, lol.  I think it's supposed to look that way to add to the comedy.  Just then the knight walks in and chops the dog!  He saves the day!  They try to leave but the property is swarming with zombies.  Bad ending perhaps, but otherwise AWESOME movie!  A mix of suspense, comedy and lots of blood.  A great zombie movie.",1500336000,,10444,4.3205791106515
