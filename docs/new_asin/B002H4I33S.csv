8370169,4,B002H4I33S,"'Apocalypse: The Second World War' would be a great teaching tool for anyone trying to introduce students (older high school age or introductory college especially) to the subject of World War Two.

The narrator does a good job describing the circumstances and the action as the film starts to roll. The video itself consists almost entirely of street level motion picture clips filmed by photographers of the various combatants from the period just before the war began all the way through to the Japanese surrender on board the USS Missouri.

The film has been technically 'touched up' to be mostly in color, which lends a new dimension to the visual experience even if you have previously seen many of the clips in black-and-white.

It is of course impossible to give comprehensive coverage to World War Two in less than six hours. In particular, the end game of 1944 and 1945  is far too rushed. But don't let that criticism detract from the fact that this is an impressive technical achievement which manages to pack in a lot of information and arresting imagery in the time allotted.

A definite recommend for history teachers and World War II buffs.",1447286400,,1156,4.847715736040609
8370170,5,B002H4I33S,"Apocalypse: The Second World War is, by far, the very best documentary I have seen to date about WWII. The enormous amount of actual footage from all angles--German, British, Japanese, Russian, French, and, of course, American, is nothing short of phenomenal! Where has all this film footage been? Although I very much like, and still re-watch, the film series, Band of Brothers, Apocalypse goes beyond and deeper. Simply the fact that each country's military was filming the war ""live"" as it unfolded is both controversial and, now, informative. I believe this is an excellent production and well worth viewing--and showing to today's younger generation. Masterful in every sense of the word!",1376956800,12,693,5.252252252252252
