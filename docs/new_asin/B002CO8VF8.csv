8364328,5,B002CO8VF8,"This Region 2 DVD plays in my Proscan $30 player I got from Big Lots, as does all the others I've tried from the UK (with a code # on the remote).
 Handy to use when Disney offers entire season DVD's in other countries only. This is when Selena Gomez 1st really shines as an actress. Unlike other Disney shows that have over acting child stars, she comes across as a smart ass teenage girl in the real world we live in. The parents  (as in all these types of TV shows lately) are fumbling around idiots and are rarely as strict as they should be to straighten the kids out. More enjoyable than the movies she's made since this show aired, it's classic Disney from all the colors to the magic spells they use. Maybe others in the US will get to see this with out a special DVD player when they release this and future seasons in Region 1.",1418083200,,837,4.192546583850931
