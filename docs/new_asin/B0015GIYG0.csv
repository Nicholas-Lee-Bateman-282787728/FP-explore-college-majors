8258369,5,B0015GIYG0,"If you search on YouTube for ""LittlePimCo"" or ""Little Pim - ENGLISH - Eating and Drinking"" you can see a clip from this volume. I purchased this as a gift for a friend's adopted daughter. As an adult, I don't think I could sit through this for very long without wanting to bang my head against a wall. However, the two-year-old found it knee-slapping funny (literally) and had a blast. As long as the target audience enjoys it, it's worth the price.",1273881600,2,449,4.487804878048781
