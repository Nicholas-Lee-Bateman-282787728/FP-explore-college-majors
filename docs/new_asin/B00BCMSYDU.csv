5578190,4,B00BCMSYDU,"I bought this for ""Gunfight Ridge"" with Joel McCrae and wasn't disappointed. Its an excellent 90 minute b&w movie with a great cast and great transfer. The movies ""Gunbelt""&""The Lone Gun"" are both good movies with average transfer,and terrible colorization. I'm not sure why they tried to colorize them? And the 4th movie ""Ride Out For Revenge"" is a b&w film with great transfer but stiff acting and slow story, with the exception of the nephew who does a great job of stealing all the scenes he's in. If the price is right, buy it.....support your favorite artists.",1368662400,14,566,4.785714285714286
5578191,5,B00BCMSYDU,"Here is my review in which I received my copy a day early, thank you Amazon! Again, Shout Factory! has produced another great set of Westerns and this set includes four 50s Westerns. All movies are in Full screen format. There isn't any special features and the disk is only one-sided. I wish Shout would've at least added some movie information like run time for each movie and color either on the back or on the inside.

Here is the list of the movies on this set:
-The Lone Gun (1954/color/74mins)
George Montgomery, Dorothy Malone, Frank Faylen, Neville Brand; Directed by Ray Nazarro
-Ride out For Revenge (1958/b&w/77mins)
Rory Calhoun, Gloria Grahame, Lloyd Bridges, Joanne Gilbert; Directed by Bernard Girard
-Gunsight Ridge (1957/b&w/85mins)
Joel McCrea, Mark Stevens, Joan Weldon, Slim Pickens; Directed by Francis D. Lyon
-Gun Belt (1953/color/78mins)
George Montgomery, Tab Hunter, Helen Westcott, John Dehner, Jack Elam; Directed by Ray Nazarro

The quality of the movies is quite good with ""Ride Out for Revenge"" being the best quality. Both video and audio are great! Overall, Shout did a great job on this set and I would recommend this, especially to Western fans!",1368403200,25,1181,5.082474226804123

5578207,4,B00BCMSYDU,"These are four good typical 50s western, which are fun to watch, for an almost ridiculously low price. In Gun Belt, for example, Billy Ringo wants to go straight but his brother, who just escaped from prison after knifing a guard, egged on by a local well-respected citizen of Tombstone forces him at gun point to participate in a hold up and murder. He is now wanted by the famed Wyatt Earp and his brother Virgil. Billy accidently kills his brother and his brother's son wants revenge thinking Billy did it on purpose. This nephew, who Billy likes, decides to join the gang to take his fathers place, and Billy needs to save him. The local well-respected man who is bothered by a gunman who threatens to kill him unless he gives him 70 percent of his earnings, hires the gunman to rob a stage coach of half a million dollars. He offers Billy 50 percent of the money the gunman takes from the stage if Billy guns down the gunman after the robbery and brings the money to him. Billy persuades Wyatt to join him to thwart the robbery, but something goes wrong. He also needs to save his nephew.",1473724800,,1093,4.442786069651741

5578260,5,B00BCMSYDU,"Oh, western fans, four westerns in a row to such a fine price. Two of them are in black and white and the picture quality is super. Two are in color and they are also very fine prints though now and then a bit unsharp. These kind of westerns which dominated the fifties and were the kind they showed in sunday matinee theaters in Denmark, Europe when I was a kid are not big budget John Ford films. Neither are they b-westerns like those starring Bob Steele, Buck Jones, Tom Tyler and many, many more ( I think b-westerns are the most charming of westerns ). No, they are something in between, some call them middle budget westerns and they certainly can be great too. ""Ride out for Revenge"" with Rory Calhoun is a bit weak because it tackles with the serious historical problem of moving the Cheyennes from their home country to Oklahoma and that is too much for the genre. But enjoy Lloyd Bridges as a drinking cowardly officer. The other three films are super. Enjoy Joel McCrea's usual calm authority in ""Gunsight Ridge"" and be thrilled by the two high action westerns starring George Montgomery who is up against such heavies as William Bishop ( what a great psycho ) and Neville Brand. These two are perhaps the best because the hero is up against almost too hard odds which make them very exciting. This disc is here by highly recommended!",1374451200,12,1346,4.520491803278689

5578264,5,B00BCMSYDU,Gun Belt was released in 1953 and is the first of two films George Montgomery did with Tab Hunter. The other is Hostile Guns in 1967. They were almost a screen team !

5578265,3,B00BCMSYDU,"I enjoyed the Rory Calhoun western best. None of these are great titles but they're fun. I noticed that Shout is putting out a couple of sci-fi dvds.

5578266,5,B00BCMSYDU,"This set of four fine little Westerns from the 1950s comes to us from Shout! Factory at an almost unbelievable price. Other reviewers have offered details on the casts and action. I can only second the rave reviews they give: this four film set gives us two George Montgomery color classics, including what may be his best outing, GUN BELT, an unheralded Rory Calhoun oater (RIDE OUT FOR REVENGE), and a fine Joel McCrea vehicle (GUNSIGHT RIDGE), these latter two in great black & white prints. These films were released by United Artists/MGM, and Shout! Factory has apparently secured DVD release rights from them. The result is a delight, highly recommended for those (like me) who cannot get enough of good, ole' Western action! Perhaps the folks at Shout! Factory will locate some other fine Westerns (from the 1950s?) to release. There are a goodly number still in the vaults. In any case, don't hesitate on this one...picture quality on each of the four is just fine.",1370390400,8,973,4.832335329341317

8566116,5,B00BCMSYDU,"4 -FORGOTTEN GEMS from U/A THAT ESCAPED my attention when they were released; THESE  4 were pretty much forgotten -until this little package came along and was I IMPRESSED! The standout for me was  ""GUNSIGHT RIDGE"",  WITH JOEL McCrea  creating a really cool character off the trail from his usual ride in this one; with Mark Stevens  also  standing out  as a crummy no good killer in this most unusual WESTERN.  "" RIDE OUT FOR REVENGE ""  has a storyline involving ROMANCE upsetting western town with  INDIAN / WHITE  relationships about to GO SOUR-- thanks to Army Boss LLOYD BRIDGES . This little diamond of a film finds RORY CALHOUN,  here , in one of his BEST PICTURES-- and one that he wrote as well --It surely has some emotional wallop at the finish line!  ADD 2 OATERS with a 'BROTHER-WANTIN'-TO-GO-BAD'-(INTRODUCING TAB HUNTER) with more 'CRAZED BAD GUYS-JUST- A-EGGIN'-HIM-ON 'against  KINFOLK  GEORGE MONTGOMERY-- who never  seems to smile....in the 2  additional forgotten saddle mounts;--; ""GUN BELT"" and ""THE LONE GUN"",  filling the rest of the MARQUEE HERE .
