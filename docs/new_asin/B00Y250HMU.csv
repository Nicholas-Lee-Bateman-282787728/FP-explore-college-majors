7207644,5,B00Y250HMU,"As a child of the TV era-as I have oft time stated- I first saw this movie on TV in the sixties. In glorious black and white, the movie is a goldmine of aviation and nautical stuff. The actual aircraft and real Navy ships are featured as the actors ply their trade using the real things as props! And official film footage for combat scenes. That's worth the cost of admission alone to me! That the acting is pretty good...but still a little hokey, as was much of the stuff from the fifties in biographical efforts such as this. Sterling Hayden, an actual WWII veteran does an admirable job portraying real life US Navy Captain and later Admiral John M. Hoskins, one of the men who helped naval aviation, and especially carrier aviation enter the jet and missile era! All while dealing with the personal tragedy of becoming an amputee due to combat injuries and having to fight superiors trying to retire him out of the service he loves and has already sacrificed much for. This is an inspiring story of his endeavors and contributions in an historical and personal conflict. Highly recommended!",1441411200,11,1095,4.678756476683938

7207648,5,B00Y250HMU,"I remember this movie from 1955 when I was 14 years old.  I saw it several times that year and never saw it again until yesterday, July 18, 2015.  It was just released on DVD & Blu-ray by Olive films who have obtained the Republic Catalog.  They have already released many fine films from Republic and have a lot more to go.

It appears that I am one of the first reviewers for this movie.  That creates a responsibility to be objective. The quality of the BluRay is excellent, especially considering the movie is 60 years old and in B&W.  It stars Sterling Hayden, Alexis Smith, Dean Jagger, Ben Cooper, Virginia Grey and Richard Crane.  It is well directed by John H. Auer.  As I was growing up Sterling Hayden was one of my favorite actors.  I think this is one of his finest dramatic roles.

Based on the real life story of Rear Admiral John M. Hoskins (Hayden) it takes place between the last years of WWII until shortly after the Korean War.  He is assigned to take over the U.S. Navy carrier Hornet but it is sunk before he can even get on board.  He is then assigned to train Navy pilots for carrier duty.  Eventually he is assigned to the carrier Princeton but before he can assume command the ship is sunk out from under him by the Japanese at the battle of Leyte and he is severely wounded. His battles are just beginning as the Navy wants to retire him.  He refuses retirement and is determined to stay on active duty in spite of his wounds.  Everything I have said up to this point you can read on the back of the case so I haven't given away any plot spoilers.  I have to stop here or I will. Suffice to say that this is just the warm up - the real story of courage and triumph is yet to come.

The movie is well balanced with war action; the strain on his family; and his dedication to the Naval service.  The battle scenes are well fused with actual war footage and you feel like you are in the middle of it. Purchasers will not be disappointed.",1437264000,58,1961,4.2398921832884096

7207665,4,B00Y250HMU,"Film covers transition of the Navy from piston engine to jets.  The R4D is seen as wartime transport.  There is footage from WW2 with kamikazes and F6F Hellcats.

There is a nearly half hour pause as Hoskins recuperates in hospital and fights for his next command.  Then contemporary footage of Hellcats and SB2C Helldivers on post war flight operations, aircraft which would have been relegated to training and reserves by the time the film was made.

The FH Phantom and F6U Pirate are completely skipped over.  We start with NATC trials of the F9F Panther, with an F7U Cutlass crash landing stuck in there to masquerade as a Panther.  Then we've got Panthers simulating carrier qualification trials, followed by Panther and AD Skyraider flight operations into Korea.  Film ends with the apron in Hawaii crowded with C-97 and C-54/R5D bringing back wounded from Korea as Hoskins assumes command of MATS.

Still a worthwhile movie, although it compresses some history.",1466294400,3,968,5.037735849056604

7207669,3,B00Y250HMU,"Love these movies but this one seemed kind of a little slow -- I know that's heresy but there are others which, while they are not ""all battle"" remain very interesting (Stand By For Action earns every rave it has gotten). It's well produced, covers a lot of territory from WWII to Korean, lots of scenes of aircraft including early jets taking off; but there's some real-life emotional territory my wife liked; -- heck we're amassing every one of these great shows we can. Sterling is good, and I'd put this in the category of ""Up Periscope"" -- pretty good. Bridges of Toko-Rei is a great one and Ben-Hur is great, if that helps.  Manilla Calling is very good; just can't say this one is great because I do like a little more action.",1458345600,5,733,4.470149253731344

Here we will see the transition from propeller aircraft to jet aircraft on aircraft carriers.  Great story with good acting. Anyone interested in aviation, the Navy, or romance will enjoy this great film.

7207672,5,B00Y250HMU,"This is apretty accurate movie, about the transition of Naval Air Power, from 100% propeller-driven, to mostly jet, between the end of WW2 and the beginning of the Korean War, including the political forces aligned with and against those changes.",1455235200,,246,5.175
7207673,5,B00Y250HMU,"Good, solid, oldie but goldie cinema. I liked this little known 1955 film A LOT. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

This film tells the true story of life, works, struggles and tribulations of Vice-Admiral John Madison ""Uncle John"" Hoskins (1898-1964) during years 1942-1951. His participation in both World War II and Korean War are an important part of the film, but quite a lot of time is devoted to, well, other topics, including the burden his career imposed to his wife and children. I simply cannot say much more in order to avoid spoilers.

I would advise you to NOT research admiral Hoskins before watching this film. ""The eternal sea"" follows very faithfully the real events and if you google too much, well, it will spoil your pleasure of discovering the whole story by yourself. And the story is worth discovering - it is not for nothing that Hoskins was for a time a familiar face for Americans, as his face was on the cover of many magazines (and for good reasons too)...

This is not exactly a war movie but rather a military biography, in which the two wars are of course very present, but the fighting scenes are few. The most important part of the story takes place in last months of WWII far from the frontlines and later in the post-war years, before the Korean War begins. Also, this film gives a lot of importance to the ""home front"" and the heavy, very heavy burden naval-military career places on the families. The wife of the admiral, Sue Hoskins (Alexis Smith), is a character as crucially important as the main hero - and her struggles and sacrifices are not lesser than those of her husband. Previously completely unknown to me actress Alexis Smith played her with a great skill - I will certainly look for more of her films.

Most of the film however is a one-Sterling-Hayden-show. In this film he plays a very noble character, quite different from those which made his reputation. He is mostly remembered for films in which he played a dangerous gangster (""The Asphalt Jungle"", ""The Killing""), a not entirely stable gunfighter (""Johny Guitar""), barking mad general (""Dr Strangelove"") or a corrupt cop (""The Godfather""). But he played also the good (albeit tough) guys and here is an occasion to discover this less known aspect of his career. I was quite impressed with his acting here and I will look for some of his other less known films, because I would like to see him more.

I will stop here, to avoid any temptation of spoilers. I liked this film a lot and I will definitely keep the DVD for another viewing. A recommened thing for all amateurs of military films and of good cinema in general. ENJOY!",1453680000,5,2661,4.665245202558635

7207678,2,B00Y250HMU,"Sterling Hayden seems to be made of cardboard in all his films I've seen. This one is no exception.
