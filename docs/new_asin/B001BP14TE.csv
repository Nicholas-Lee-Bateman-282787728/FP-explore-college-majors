After watching the past Death Note episodes, I was really excited to see the climax of between L & Kira (Light Yagami). It was one of the best moments in the TV show so far.

Then we are introduced with 2 of L's successors: Mello(M) and Near(N). Both of them are determined to capture Kira by any means necessary.

You will definitely not be dissapointed with this volume since the storyline is becoming fast paced.

Definitely add it to your collection and reserve Volume 8.",1228780800,,493,4.632183908045977

--This review is for Death Note vol. 7.
My husband and I have loved watching this series, and have impulsively bought the next dvd, and then the next dvd, without caring how much money we had left in our bank account because this show was so addicting... and we are finally caught up waiting for December 30th for the next volume.  Hard to wait!  We went through the available dvd's really fast.
It's a great series, but it has dipped on this volume... Let me explain.

I browsed through the other reviews and was absolutely stunned that NO reviewer has mentioned, (or maybe they all didn't notice?), the one main thing that jostled my like for this late turn of events on this volume 7:  On the second to last episode, AND including the last episode on this dvd, the animation is quite different to me.  And I happen to -hate- it.  And my husband has noticed the difference in the animation as well.  It's really hard to explain how it has changed.  And I would call it a subtle change since it seems no once else has noticed it.  So, why should I be so bugged?  Because. it. is. different. to. me., it's. not. the. same., and I don't like the change.  So, in my anger on this fact, I would say that it looks cheaper.  It's almost as if the main animating company didn't have enough time to finish animating the rest of this set of episodes, and hired out for someone who is not as good and it was just quickly pumped out and uncared for.  That is a theory of ours, not a fact.  It's just what it seems like.  And I would say that it looks like the same bozos who animated that old G.I. Joe cartoon from the 80's got the green light to animate the last two episodes on this volume. =A joke, not a fact.  And please heaven forbid that the animation remains this way!  Granted, the up close shots of the main characters still look relatively the same, but it's when the characters are being shown together in a group and you see their whole bodies in the frame, or when characters are shown from torso shots, especially noticable when the are talking in those same kind of frames.  It was hard for me to keep enjoying what I was watching, and also the story is getting weird...

I'm not so sure about this new direction in story the last two episodes take on this volume.  I thought the same thing as we were watching the Yotsuba involvement part of the story, but that has worked ok I guess.  My husband and I aren't too excited about the new characters that were introduced on this volume 7.  It's like the chemistry of the story of Deathnote is being changed again, as it felt like with the Yotsuba involvement.  The new horrible animation style doesn't help me enjoy everything about the new direction of story.  Apparently the new animation is only horrible to me and my husband.  I can't believe no one else has noticed or mentioned...)
I -could- have given this volume 4 stars if it wasn't for the disapointment in the new animation.  The lack of 5 stars I give it just mainly has to do with how I'm not sure about the direction the story is going, haven't enjoyed it as thoroughly as the first 5 volumes.",1227484800,2,3143,4.357388316151202
