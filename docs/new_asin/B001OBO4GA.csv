8330304,5,B001OBO4GA,"Yawara is a very classic show with many characters. The story is always moving progressively, damn near no filler episodes here! What really makes this anime great is the writing and many memorable character's through the story. You will find plenty of characters to cheer for and laugh at. This serious follows the main character through her days in high school to college and how she perfects her training and resents it at the same time. This is a must watch for anyone into slice of life anime with a few twists and turns here and there.",1521417600,,541,4.587628865979381

8330306,4,B001OBO4GA,"I've heard good things about this anime and decided to buy it when it was on sale, I wasn't disappointed. Though some might think that a series about judo would be boring, it's definitely not. The interaction of the character's, Yawara's growing pains of trying to be a normal teenager while her stubborn grandfather makes her prepare to one day earn a gold medal at the Women's Judo competition in the Barcelona Olympics.

One of the great thing about this boxset is the booklet that comes with the product, it explains the references and judo terms used throughout the series. I studied judo for a quarter at my university and I enjoyed hearing terms I learned during that time.

I highly recommend this series, you'll be drawn in by the first few episodes.",1295568000,3,759,4.6992481203007515
8330307,5,B001OBO4GA,"I watched this anime when I was 14-15 and I have always love it.  It's awesome. I have always liked Judo ( I practised it when I was a child) but I liked it a lotmore after after watching Yawara.

I loved that girl. Probably one of the manga characters I love more.",1259280000,2,265,3.981132075471698
8330308,5,B001OBO4GA,"I'm sorry Amazon I love you but $125.99 (on sale???) when I could get it from Best Buy for $80.00 and AnimEigo for $90.00 is just wrong. I know you have to make money, but seeing prices listed from other sites tells me that the retail price is lower than you quote. Usually Amazon is comparable and I don't mind it being a little higher for the convenience of it arriving at my home. Again I love Amazon, the service has been great and I have gotten some good deals. However, I think your pricing should be updated on this item.",1251676800,6,528,4.237623762376238
8330309,5,B001OBO4GA,"There was a Golden Age of anime in the late 1980's.  Takahashi Rumiko had scored a mega-hit with her series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Urusei-Yatsura/dp/B00005ASUS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Urusei Yatsura</a>, and the studios were looking for the next big thing.  Two animated projects were developed side-by-side, both with a martial arts/love story theme and both adapted from popular comics in the Shonen Sunday magazine. One was another Takahashi comic, with a more fantastical feel, called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ranma-1-2/dp/B000Q73HB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ranma 1/2</a>. The sister series had a more realistic take on martial arts, in this case judo, but was no less popular in Japan.  ""Yawara: The Fashionable Judo Girl"" was in fact more popular in Japan, and consistently scores higher on ""Top 10"" lists than its more American-famous companion.  Yawara was so popular that when judo athlete Tamura Ryoko took the silver medal at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, she was instantly given the nickname ""Yawara"", which she still is referred to by to this day.

""Yawara"" is a long-running series, with over 100 episodes, so it is impossible to encapsulate the entire story here.  The basic set-up has Inokuma Yawara as a judo prodigy, a young high school girl who has been trained from birth by her grandfather, 7th dan judo master Inokuma Jigorou, with one goal in mind.  She is to win the gold medal at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, and later receive the National Medal of Honor as a result of her prowess.  Yawara, however, doesn't want to be a judo star, and just wants to act like all the other girls her age; dressing in pretty clothes, having cute boyfriends and frivolously gossiping over cake in fashionable cafes.  Jigorou has his work cut out for him, as he pushes and prods, connives and schemes, all to get Yawara on the path of judo.  He creates a rival for her, in the form of Honami Sayaka, a spoiled rich girl who has succeeded in every sport she has ever tried, and isn't about to let a plain girl like Yawara get the better of her.  Between Yawara and Sayaka is the smooth-talking playboy and judo coach Kazamatsuri Shinnosuke, who captures the hearts of both tough ladies. Needless to say, hijinks ensue.

Staying on the realistic side, ""Yawara"" never goes for the slapstick physical comedy of Ranma , but reminds me a lot more of Takahashi's other series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maison-Ikkoku/dp/B00009L53V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maison Ikkoku</a>.  The characters are so well-developed that you find yourself quickly sucked in and gasping for a new episode.  Serious subplots develop, new characters enter the playing field, but never with the ""joke a week"" sense that they are temporary throwaways.  One character, Jody Rockwell, is particularly heartwarming as a giant Canadian judo champion who comes to Japan in order to test herself against Yawara.  The plot isn't a dead giveaway either.  I honestly don't know who Yawara will end up with, if she will go to the Olympics, what will happen to other characters...all of which keeps me coming back for a new episode.  Yawara also does a daily countdown towards the Olympics, something that I remember fondly from the first Japanese animation I ever saw,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Space-Battleship-Yamato/dp/B000YE81I0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Space Battleship Yamato</a>.

As usual, Animeigo has set a new level of excellence with their boxset release of this series.  You never just get the movies from Animeigo, you get an entire cultural package, which is really helpful.  Shows like ""Yawara"" don't exist in a vacuum, and much of the cultural references wouldn't be caught without Animeigo's handy pop-up information.  I have also found their subtitles great for studying Japanese, as they take the time to explain certain words rather than just translate them.

This boxset contains the first 40 episodes of the 124 episode series.  I am looking forward to the release of the remained of the series, and hopefully (fingers crossed!) the 1989 live-action ""Yawara"" feature film as well.  After seeing this boxset, I am a confirmed Yawara fan! Ippon!",1232064000,22,4338,5.5963302752293576
