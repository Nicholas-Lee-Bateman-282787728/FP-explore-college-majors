1746035,5,B00006FD8X,"Fully in line with my expectations for BBC excellence, the Midsomer Murders series doesn't disappoint. I did find however the Set numbering quite confusing as it didn't seem to correspond to the character developments.

For those new to the series, I would recommend viewing the series in the order in which it was aired, not by the consecutive order of the Set numbers. For instance, ""Set 5"" is actually Season 1 which aired in 1998. ""Set 4"" is mostly Season 5 which aired in 2002. Below, is an overview for your viewing convenience.

1746036,4,B00006FD8X,Genial and often gentle murder and John Nettles' handling of suspects and witnesses is so polite it's a pleasure to  watch.,1126051200,,123,4.857142857142857
1746037,4,B00006FD8X,"The Midsomer Murders series is the best contemporary British mystery series available on DVD for Anglophiles who want to believe England has not changed for the worse. I am a big fan of the older Mystery series as seen on PBS, and have purchased most of the DVDs available for `Morse', `Poirot', `Marple"" as well as others that reflect `crime' in earlier imaginary ages. Most of us who travel to the UK from time to time are painfully aware that England as a Never-Never land disappeared long ago, if indeed it ever existed, but the Midsomer series allows us to play ""adult pretend"" as it portrays England as it might have been and might still be if you know where to look in Kent and the Cotswolds.

While other excellent mystery series depict the UK (especially London) as it really is -- gritty and not terribly different from many major cities in the US (BBC-America `Mystery Monday' lineup, i.e., `Murder in Suburbia' and `Wire in the Blood.'), the `Midsomer Murders' series fits the definition of ""cozy"" as given by PBS Mystery host Diana Rigg (I think these shows are A&E products that have never been shown on PBS, however).  Although the series is set in modern times with cell phones and computers, the producers know where to take the crew on location (as they describe in the extra features on the DVDs), as well as the fact that many Americans want England served up as a kind of fantasy-land where a finite line-up of suspects falls into place and social order is maintained (One wag described England as the American Anglophile's Disney Land).  And, just like the old mysteries by Christie and March, motive and timing become the means of entrapment-not forensics, while sleuths not terribly unlike Dectective Allyn solve the crime.

In Series #3, beautiful places such as old hotels, commons, and memorial gardens are threatened with renovation and change. You can get yourself killed in Midsomer if you threaten to change anything. One way to stay alive is stick to tradition. Mailmen who deviate from their appointed rounds and threaten the supposed marital bliss of villagers, couples who commit fornication in broad daylight, and cheating spouses run great risks. Like their role model Allyn, Barnaby and Troy are ready to get to the bottom of the crime and understand the forces that lie within the heart of village life.",1104192000,26,2342,4.832917705735661
1746038,4,B00006FD8X,"Karinka shows her personality in this disc, and it's a rather bizarre one.  She's willful, fiesty, and a touch sadistic, but is also very, very funny.  Her interactions with Kurumi are priceless.  However, this disc also begins to take a dark turn when Kurumi grows black wings and a new male angel appears.  Not as fun as disc two, but a great set-up for whats to come.

Just beware, some discs won't play the last two episodes.  Call ADV if you have this problem.",1095724800,,465,4.476190476190476
1746039,4,B00006FD8X,"in his review of March 2004 ""Complex plots and enjoyable viewing, March 14, 2004
  Reviewer: Frank Behrens from Keene, NH USA wrote that Inspector Morse was assisted by Troy.
I do not wish to nitpick but the name of Sgt. Lewis was Robbie.
Much as though this series is an enjoyable puzzler, the plots are nowhere as complex as those of Morse but they are pleasant enough sojourns into the bloodied fields of merrie Englande.",1083110400,5,424,4.64
1746040,5,B00006FD8X,"Many of you might have watched ""Midsomer Murders"" over the commercial-ridden A&E channel and have joined millions on both sides of the Atlantic in becoming devoted fans. For you, good news. Acorn Media has issued the third set that includes five more episodes in boxed sets of 5 DVDs.
 Briefly, in the first set, ""Death's Shadow"" deals with several weird murders in Badger's Drift, ""Strangler's Wood"" with the seeming renewal of serial killings after many years, ""Blood Will Out"" with the effect of nomadic groups on local problems, and ""Beyond the Grave"" (the most gothic of the four) with ghostly doings in a museum.
 In the second, we have ""Dead Man's Eleven"" dealing with a cricket bat as a murder weapon and a cricket game as the scene of yet another murder; ""Death of a Stranger"" dealing with fox hunting, strange tramps, Oscar Wilde, and murder; ""Blue Herrings"" dealing with suspicious deaths in a home for the elderly; and ""Judgement Day"" dealing with a ""perfect"" village trying to win an award as the bodies pile up.
 In this latest set, ""Garden of Death"" involves local outrage at the commercialization of a local treasure; ""Destroying Angel"" is about murders concerning a hotel; ""The Electric Vendetta"" centers around those who do and do not believe in UFOs; ""Who Killed Cock Robin"" is about a love affair, while ""Dark Autumn"" is about multiple love affairs.
 In a former review, I said that I found the first two series just a little less striking, a little more low-key, than those I have raved about in the Wimsey, Poirot and Miss Marple series. I added that ""Midsomer Murders"" seems a recycling of the Inspector Morse series but without that character's idiosyncrasies. But by now, I am pretty hooked on the show and complain only about extremely complex plots that will make you want to view them a second time. But that is the point in owning recordings.
 I should interject here that some television series are rich and enjoyable enough to deserve repeated viewings. Poirot for its humor and period settings, Marple for its characters, Wimsey for all three of those elements, and now ""Midsomer Murders.""
 John Nettles plays Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby with a droll sense of humor that is most appealing and most of his ongoing problems stem from his job's keeping him away from his lovely wife (Jane Wymark) and daughter (Laura Howard). His sidekick, Sergeant Troy (Daniel Casey) is simply Barnaby's sidekick but there is a humorous interplay between them. Notice that Inspector Morse's assistant is also named Troy.
 And it is very good to see that gorgeous English scenery with its old inns and the like. Oh yes, and no foul language, but some unnecessary nudity of the ""we may do it so we must do it"" variety adds nothing to the quality of the show.",1079222400,86,2776,4.819327731092437
1746041,5,B00006FD8X,out of the 3 movies that have come out so far this has to be the funnyest---kurinka and kurumi go in an all out battle were kurumi wins but what are these black wings coming out of here back it tells u in this vido so don't worry----kurinka surches for kurumis sercret and kurumi thinks her power is the fact that her master kissed her so kuranka try to kiss him and she does but she does not get more powerful at all then the boy gets kidnaped by this miltary base in the sky and what dr.anakogeis from the feature--theres lots more surprises were this came from but youll have to see this dvd to find out---so order it,1033862400,,620,4.175
1746042,4,B00006FD8X,"Continuing the series of short episodes (most actually have around 10 to 12 minutes of viewing with a little padding to add to the 15 minute quoted times, which in turn are less than the typical 22+ minute episodes of other), this is about an hour of actual watching if you skip the intros and titles. But if you like boys-and-girls together sort of fun, it's okay. (I bought mine cheap as I could find to avoid paying too much).
Karinka comes in as the next angel on the list, and unlike the ""minor profanity"" warning her personality is that of a mean little potty mouth. She's cute and fiesty and small and she wants to destroy Kurumi, which means she has to find out Kurumi's secret. Which means she first sneaks around trying to weasle it out, then Kurumi faces her down. Brought out into the open she then joins the collection. Her little asides as to how she really feels when she's acting sweet to fool others will annoy some people but tickle others. Her realistic personality where she gets ticked off and then acts sweet clashes with the bland ""I am evil. I will kill you."" mornonocism of Hollywood.
We find that some of the participants are supposedly from the future, and one person appears with intent to find the true secret of the steel angels.
Overall, I approach the series simply as entertainment: I like the period setting which isn't overdone, and the girls and beset-apon guy, the silly puppy-love sort of crushes, and the true heart in the people. Sometimes it's a little smarmy or silly and others it's heavy. In a word, there is variety in what goes on, and overall it's aimed at level people who just watch shows for fun and laughs, and no other real purpose, and don't have to have non-stop romance or endless gory violence.
I would rate it for mature teens (and teenage hearted adults) who understand girl-boy, who aren't going to spas-out about one or two nude shots, and who momma already has heard cussing. People who like saucyness but don't need stark black ugliness. Angels tend to show a hard, evil side but later on are won over into being girlfriends in the group throughout the series. And if you were into philosophy, you'd say that the angels aren't evil - they just need a good heart to show them what's right. When they meet it, they do a flip-flop in motives.",1032307200,,2301,4.533653846153846
1746043,4,B00006FD8X,"This is the third installation for Steel Angel Kurumi. The episodes on this disk go much deeper in showing you what the character Karinka is like. The first 4 episodes on this disk basically goes into the personality of Karinka. The last two episodes on the disk goes into a darker story line which leads into the next DVD.
I actually enjoyed watching Steel Angel Kurumi. The show is very fun in both languages. A little warning about the language used for the English version. The character Karinka uses explicits such as f*** and b****. There is also a little nudity as the doctor tries to repair another angel which is Saki. I would rate this TV show as PG-13.",1032307200,,663,4.533333333333333

1746219,5,B00006FD8X,"Elegant country estates and picturesque cottages hide dastardly activities in Englands Midsomer County, where corpses seem to stack like kindling, murders are often remarkably grotesque, and motives range from bizarre to out-and-out kinky. Based on novels and characters created by Caroline Graham and debuting in 1997, the long-running BBC series MIDSOMER MURDERS features Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby (John Nettles), his slightly daffy wife Joyce (Jane Wymark), and their theatrically ambitious daughter Cully (Laura Howard.) Tom is assisted in his cases by the amusingly loutish D.S. Gavin Troy (Daniel Casey) and a number of medical men, most often the dryly comic Dr. Bullard (Barry Johnson.) The repeating characters are often supported by luminaires from the British stage, screen, and television, and the scripts are memorable for their dark witbut in spite of the humor, episodes often include a strange sense of tragedy.  Although the central characters sometimes have overarching storylines, each episode stands alone, a complete story told in about an hour and forty minutes.

The fourth set contains five titles. MIDSOMER MURDERS had always been extreme in terms of plot, but the story telling truly hits its stride here, with the killer often acting from flatly psychotic motives. Garden of Death sets the tone with a story of an aristocratic but mercenary family determined to raze a memorial garden on their property and put up a profitable tea shop for tourists in its place. Destroying Angel is equally complex and remarkably dark, the story of bickering heirs whose numbers are unexpectedly thinned by everything from shotgun to poisoned mushrooms. In Who Killed Cock Robin?, Barnaby finds himself face to face with a man he once arrested and who now claims to be straightand dealing with a murder along the way. Dark Autumn is particularly disturbed in tone, presenting a series of murders that ultimately expose one of the most psychologically sick criminals in the series.  My favorite of the set is The Electric Vendetta, which is wickedly funny in a warped sort of way. A naked dead man is found in the middle of a crop circle, and his wounds are described by the local UFO expert as indicative of alien abduction. But what of the next body? And the next?

In addition to memorable performances, great scripts, and first rate production values, MIDSOMER MURDERS also has an intriguing score and makes effective, often paranoia-inducing, use of prowling cameras that sometimes take the killers point of view. And it is the rare episode that stops at one or murders. Three is commonplace, four is not exactly unknow, and fans of the cozy genre may well find the series a bit too disturbing for their tastes.  But if you like a good murder mystery, youll find it in this series. Its immediately addictive. Strongly recommended.

1746410,5,B00006FD8X,"The reason this series works so well is entirely due to John Nettles performance as the levelheaded Tom Barnaby.  Murder on such a grand scale doesnt seem to faze him one little whit.  And a lot of these murders are bizarre!  In episode one (Garden of Death) hidden family matters come to light, causing more than a little friction as their numbers dwindle..........murder begins at home.  Episode two (Destroying Angel) involves mushrooms and a conflict of interest between two factions........whos killing who!  Episode three (The Electric Vendetta) starts with an annoying flashback that isn't explained until much later, resulting in some confusion over the time period involved.  This is a plot ploy theyve used before.  UFOs are suspected, but not involved.  Bodies just don't fall out of the sky!  Episode four (Who Killed Cock Robin?) involves a missing victim, leaving all to wonder if he is dead or alive.  And then a body shows up but its not the right body!  The last episode (Dark Autumn) features several brutal killings as a local postman is cut down in the prime of life.  I would have called this episode Postage Due.  The man delivered more than just the mail.  All his mourners were women.

At this rate, the citizenry of England will soon be decimated, leaving only Barnaby and Sgt Troy!",1457568000,,1307,4.877272727272727

1746517,4,B00006FD8X,"Good storylines for the most part.  As always, likeable main characters.  One complaint I have is that the stories are usually about multiple murders that occur throughout an episode.  I would prefer the entire program being about Tom and Gavin figuring out the identity of the murderer of one killing.  It's hard to believe these quant English villages all having serial killers.  Makes me wonder what they put in their English Breakfast Tea.

As for the Electric Vendetta, I was disappointed.  Not a very good explanation why such a vendetta went on 40 years.  Another problem:  If you compare the actors portraying the same characters -- as elderly people and as young kids -- there's way more than 40 years between the two.  The older characters look like they're in their late 70s while the younger characters look like they're in their late teens or 20 years old.  Cause Midsomer Murders are around 1998-2000, that means 40 years earlier would have been late 1950s-early 1960s, yet the clothing and hairstyles look like the 1940s.  Based upon the age difference between the older vs. younger actors and the clothing and hairstyles on the younger characters, it looks more like 55 to 60 years difference, not 40 years difference.",1420329600,,1234,4.908212560386473

1746620,5,B00006FD8X,"If you like an up-to-date fairly cosy English mystery series you may want to sample Midsomer Murders. Based upon books by Caroline Graham, it follows the sleuthing of a very likable Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby (John Nettles)and his stalwart partner Sergeant Troy (Daniel Casey). You get to know his wife Joyce ( Jane Wymark) and his daughter Cully, (Laura Howard). But most of the time you follow Barnaby around to the bucolic villages and towns of central England as he finds out why seemingly perfectly normal villagers might inspire each other to murder. Most of the murders aren't too grisly, so you will sleep at night. I watch it for scenery as much as anything else.

This season the shows include as described by the producers:

Garden of DeathOne of the most beautiful spots in the county becomes a source of contention.
Destroying AngelWhen a hotel owner dies, the manager misses the reading of the will that names him part-owner.
The Electric VendettaA mutilated body found in a crop circle leads some to suspect aliens have invaded.
Who Killed Cock Robin?A murder mars plans for the upcoming wedding of the village squires daughter.
Dark AutumnA postman is brutally murdered, and it turns out he was delivering more than the mail to village women.

I first saw one series of these mysteries on PBS in the 90's and later was delighted to find that this is an ongoing popular mystery series in England with many more stories for us to enjoy.

For those who do not own them, they can be purchased in sets that come in the correct order of the UK airings. If you own previous DVDs, be sure to check that you are not duplicating. If you are new, sit back and begin to enjoy one of the best cop/crime shows ever produced in the WORLD, and it continues today (2013), 16 years running. And expect multiple murders.

TOP British crime drama, with a twist of humor and romance. And then there is the awesome footage of British village life, as spectacular as any English documentary/travel DVD. The characters are believable, and the crime solving is reasonable, although complex enough for the most avid of mystery fans. I have never watched an episode that was not a 5-star production. Speaking of stars, every British TV & film star now wants to be a guest star on this show. Guest stars began in the beginning, and are a part of what makes this such a delightful series. Prepare yourself for some very tender moments or a belly laugh. It has it all.

Tom Barnaby (John Nettle) became an icon for Murder Mystery TV fun. Episodes are based on novels of Caroline Graham. Eventually most reviews of other crime shows get around to comparing to Midsomer. It's that good.

SUBTITLES NOW INCLUDED, an update from the old releases. Midsomer episodes are 100 minutes each.

Terrific. Intend to see them all.",1366502400,,272,4.808510638297872
1746762,5,B00006FD8X,"I am glad there are stories that can't be solved in the first few moments of the movie.  Finally, smart and clever, clues that are truthful, but also slightly misleading. You learn  about the details of Midsomer, map included, and would love to invite these characters to tea to talk about all the clues! These are keepers!",1363910400,,323,4.649122807017544

1746764,5,B00006FD8X,"Midsomer Murders is seen in more countries than any other TV series and the reason is simple: it is as addictive as any drug. Watch one episode and you are hooked. Beautiful scenes of the English countryside, John Nettles as lead, eccentric characters, and ingenious murders for sometimes odd reasons add up to the best crime drama on film.",1361577600,,340,4.779661016949152

1746767,5,B00006FD8X,"My wife and I are not very impressed with what is offered on TV lately.  We have taken to buying Murder She Wrote, Perry Mason, Matlock, Diagnosis Murder, etc..... series on DVD and watching those.  Having watched those series at least twice, we were looking for something new.  I saw these on Amazon and decided to try them.  We love them.  We are not real film critics, we just like trying to solve an entertaining murder mystery.  At first we thought these were below our sleuthing skills, until we got to the end of the first mystery and realized neither of us had identified the culprit correctly.  3 discs later and we still are having trouble getting the killer pegged.  We like them, and since it is a British show, we never saw them before.  We are going to buy the next set in the series and recommend them for a relaxing evening of solving the crime.",1359936000,,861,4.43312101910828
1746788,5,B00006FD8X,"I now have 20 set of this series and look forward to getting the rest. I have never seen a mystery that was so baffling. I consider myself pretty sharp and i pay attention to every detail, and still i never (with three exception) figured out who the bad guy was. The writers and actors are very good at misleading you while not actually hiding the culprit. I am impressed and the camera is very good despite being British .",1358121600,,423,4.3

1746790,5,B00006FD8X,"Midsomer Murders is one of my favorite British television programs. The actors are brilliant, the plots are interesting, and a bit of levity is usually a part of each episode. My only complaint is I wish subtitles were an option from the very beginning. John Nettles IS Tom Barnaby who is a brilliant policeman. I know everything changes, and I congratulate Mr. Nettles on his retirement but I wish Midsomer Murders could go on forever. I adore this wonderful show!",1356393600,,465,4.825
1746791,5,B00006FD8X,These Midsommer Murders were as delightful nd entertaining as all I have seen in the past.  I look forward eagerly to the next set I will be able to afford.  They offer hours of stimulating entertainment.  We watch them over and over.,1356220800,,234,4.523809523809524
1746792,4,B00006FD8X,"A young boy named Nakahito, who is a mystic in training accidentally awakens an artificially created human named Kurumi. She is called a ""Steel Angel"" and is completely loyal to whomever awakens her. The army is after her to use her power as a weapon. They send other Steel Angels after her to bring her back, but the other Angels end up living with Nakahito and Kurumi instead. Lot's of silliness ensues. That's pretty much the plot in a nutshell.

This anime is a lot of fun. The characters are cool and the laughs keep on coming. There is an ongoing story line but for the most part the show is about Kurumi being bubbly and goofy while trying to have fun with Nakahito. The animation is pretty good for an older series, and most of the voice cast is ok. Kurumi's voice can get on your nerves sometimes though. My only major complaint is the episode length. The episodes are like 10 minutes long. There is a preview and a closing song after every episode, so prepare to wear your remote batteries down skipping them. After the main story, there is a time warp of 80 years or so. Nakahito is obviously dead and Kurumi is awakened once again by his granddaughter. Now Kurumi is in love with a prepubescent girl. It gets kinda creepy. All in all this series is pretty fun, but it's nothing to write home about.",1355011200,,1310,4.435684647302905
1746793,5,B00006FD8X,"I love the series.  That is all I can say about it.  I love the characters, I love the town settings and I love John Nettles.  Amazing how one small area can have so many murders, but there you go.  The series continues to find different ways of murdering people and no one is immune from the possibility of either murdering or being murdered.  Because of the whimsy involved in each plot, the grisly murders don't seem so bad.  That is fine with me.  John Nettles is amazing.",1354924800,,476,4.340909090909091

Once I start watching them I can't stop until I have seen all in the set and am then disappointed that I have to wait until new ones are available.

1746851,5,B00006FD8X,"Midsomer Murders is a fine example of British cozy mysteries (inspired by the novels of Caroline Graham), without going over the top on the gore factor. Set in the bucolic English villages in Midsomer County, the murders that occur here(at an alarmingly high rate, one might add) are in stark contrast to the serene beauty of the English countryside. The murders can be grisly, but this is often offset by the scenic country setting, and the witty dialogue (Amazon Prime members are able to view Midsomer Murders' episodes via instant download for free).

DCI Tom Barnaby (John Nettles) leads a relatively contented life with his wife Joyce (Jane Wymark) and works for the Criminal Investigation Department. Assisted by his detective sergeant Gavin Troy (Daniel Casey), the pair find themselves going all over the county investigating the strangest and at times grisliest murders in little hamlets with innocent sounding names. Tom is a meticulous investigator and an astute observer of human nature. His methodical investigative methods and keen eye contrast with DS Troy, who is prone to making politically-incorrect statements and often blunders to the wrong conclusion regarding the identity of a particular murderer.

The episodes in Season 4 are:
Garden of Death - the Inkpen clan stir up the anger of the locals when they plan to remodel a beloved garden and turn it into a teashop. When two Inkpens turn up dead, the DCI and his DS find their hands full trying to figure out the identity of the murderer.
Destroying Angel - Inheritors of a hotel meet untimely ends. This episode is interesting for its homage to the detective stories of yesteryear.
The Electric Vendetta - Cropcircles and UFOs? Strange case indeed.
Who Killed Cock Robin? - Discoveries of awkward liaisons and homicide keep our detectives busy.
Dark Autumn - This was an entertaining episode because its kind of over the top. Well, I admit many of the Midsomer Murder episodes can be rather over the top, but this one features a postman who turns up dead, and turns out he has been sleeping with many of the village ladies! The list of potential suspects is lengthy and of course, keep DCI Barnaby and DS Troy busy!

There is a Gothic feel to many of the crimes, which is enhanced by the unique music chosen to accompany a particular episode. At times, certain scenes seem overly exaggerated, but to me, they only add to the charm of the show. This is a great example of atmospheric crime dramas with a wonderful ensemble cast and riveting storylines. Midsomer Murders will appeal to fans of British cozy mysteries, where blood and gore take a backseat to wit and humor, and the focus is on investigations set amidst a bucolic, close-knit setting.",1325635200,4,2722,4.900216919739696
1746852,5,B00006FD8X,"When I first became a fan, I was facinated by the everyday husband and wife interactions of Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby and his wife. They're darling. From that position, I enjoyed watching how DCI Barnaby slowly brought out the fact's connecting points. Each episode is well written, of course acted with a great deal of professionalism, and leads me to want to see more of their adventures. The balances of life that the characters struggle through are handled well, and also teach the viewer about what could happen, does happen, and won't happen. Sometimes stories do not include all of these components. I must admit that seeing Mr. Nettles age into his part added much more realism to the life of the character. When I learned that Mr. Nettles, his on screen wife, and daughter were going away, I felt sad. But, isn't that the way of life. The old must make way for the new. I enjoyed the trip through Set3, and look forward to many more hours of enjoyment watching the microscopic lives of Midsomer Murder's characters.",1310947200,2,1032,4.770949720670391

It feels one's reading an Agatha Christie's book, updated to the XXI century, with images instead of words.

1746856,4,B00006FD8X,"I love this series and own practically all of it.  But when the issue of religion enters the script, the writers seem abnormally anti-clerical and ignorant of church history and doctrine.  One of the stories in Part 3 has a man in his early 40s as a Catholic bishop who wears civilian clothes and is in the ""running"" for Cardinal.  Utter nonsense.  Similar examples abound throughout Midsomer Murders.  Oh well, the series on the whole is entertaining and interesting, despite the often mind-boggling complexity of the plots and the many sneers at those who take the Christian faith seriously.",1265414400,3,593,4.94949494949495
