The first cartoon has the word ""buckaneers"" on it and its about Betty being in the country and  runs out of gas and ends up at a redneck shack.  After singing and dancing with them The next cartoon is called(maybe) Shoo Fly about a fly that won't leave Betty and Pudgy alone in the kitchen where she is making pie and Pudgy was trying to take a nap.  It also contains ""stop that noise and ""be human"" and ""Betty and the king"".  I believe it  has the same cover as volume 1  and I would SO appreciate it if you would email me if I can buy this one.  Thanks, Janice  Revet",1354060800,,686,4.022222222222222
