8371429,3,B002JH268G,"I bought this because it's one of the 2 DVDs I could find that explain how son cubano is danced.

In this DVD, Jose Carrion explains the concept of dancing contra tiempo.... without ever mentioning the words 'contra tiempo'. How weird is that? While he manages to cover a few basic turn patterns and the hallmark of son cubano, the tornillo, I find his instruction to be overly simplified. For example, when he explains how the tornillo is done it's little more than just explaining the obvious - ""first the lady walks around, then she turns you... and you can also go down like this"". He does not explain how to balance properly and lock your arms in order to allow her to turn you in the first place!

To cut things short, let's just say if you're a complete beginner and have no background you will definitely struggle.

'La Raices del Son' is the second part of the DVD. While informative, it is drab and uninspiring because you have to watch the dude sit there and literally read the whole essay off a laptop in front of the camera. *facepalm*

The performances make up the third part. At least that's entertaining to watch although there's nothing to explain what they're about.",1315267200,4,1184,4.570754716981132

It is rare to find any instructional video or even footage of this elegant Cuban dance style and this DVD has both. Son is the precursor to salsa dancing, but it has its own unique personality and style, so getting to see the real deal is a treasure.
And yes, this is the real deal. Jose Carrion, who instructs in this video, is a former principal dancer and corps professor with  Ballet Folklorica Cutumba from Santiago de Cuba. Santiago is the city in Cuba where son developed in the 20s and son is still danced there.
The dance instruction in this video is very clear. First, the basic step and body position are clearly explained and demonstrated for male and female.  A key element to knowing how to dance son is knowing how the basic step fits with the son clave (clave Cubano) and this is emphasized in the instruction.  Then, Jose leads through many of the dance figures that are unique to son. Moves are carefully explained and executed with elegance by the two Cuban dancers. Body position and movements of male and female are easy to see and copy from this footage.
The video of the performance company Cutumba dancing son is also a treasure. The lead dancer in the first piece in the performance is ""muy suavecito "". I could watch him over and over again. When he does the tornillos - the turns the man does while the women supports him - it is a jaw-dropper.  To see these performances is to really see the heart and soul of Cuban dancing.
Finally, for those who also want a history lesson, the DVD includes a lecture on the roots of son by the musicologist,  Ernesto Armian Linare.",1262476800,2,1660,4.4295081967213115
