8137701,4,B000H92K2U,"EMSON's 50 CLASSIC TV SHOWS consists of 4 flipdiscs stored in stagger fashion on both sides of a double-thick snapcase. None of the individual programs are identified, nor is any literature included with this collection. Picture and sound quality vary from mostly OK to occasionally bad (note will be made of the latter). Some purported as ""shows"" are only highlights. Best here (and worth this set's price) is an uncut early 1950s live Bob Hope hour, his third ever ahow as host. Bob, Les Brown and USO cast celebrate the military. Worst condition-wise are fragmentary Colgate Comedy Hours. (Box contents are mislabeled. There are 3 Lone Rangers and one Milton Berle show.)
