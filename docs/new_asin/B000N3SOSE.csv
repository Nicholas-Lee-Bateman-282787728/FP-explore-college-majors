2754226,5,B000N3SOSE,"I was fortunate to view this Documentary last year in Pasadena, California.

I went to see it again last month in Santa Monica, California.

It is to a Documentary like this that people will view over and over and ask themselves the question of:  ""Why""?  The life of a Carthusian Monk is so far removed from our life in the World and we ask ourselves why one is drawn to become a Carthusian Monk.

There is no religious order that takes a VOW OF SILENCE.  This was a common belief of the Trappists (Cistercians).  As with the Trappists of old, Carthusians simply 'OBSERVE' Silence and eventually desire it.

From the Solemn Investiture of Novices into the Charterhouse of Le Grande Chartreuse; watching Monks getting a hair-cut; the tailor-monk making new habits; the simple act of eating one's meal alone in cell; the Solemn, repetitive chanting of the ""BENEDICITE"" from the Psalms in a darkened, candlite Church; to Monks enjoying their once-a-week outing on the snow slopes of the French Alps.......all these acts draw us inward and overwhelm our senses and give us a sense and portion of what it is like to be a member of the Strictest Order within Roman Catholicism.

If viewers are interested in further knowledge of the Carthusian Life, they might want to get Nancy Klein Maguire's book:  ""AN INFINITY OF LITTLE HOURS"".  Dr. Maguire takes us to St. Hugh's Charterhouse, Parkminister, U.K. and follows 5 young men from 1960 as they enter this Charterhouse to follow their desire to become a Carthusian Monk.

Dr. Maguire's book is a magnificent companion to ""INTO GREAT SILENCE'

It is a book that I have read and re-read many times and have not been moved so much since, except when I first read Thomas Merton's  Autobiography -  ""SEVEN STOREY MOUNTAIN"".

2754227,5,B000N3SOSE,"Zeitgeist Films presents a documentary directed and written by Philip Groning. In French and Latin with English subtitles. Filmmaker Philip Groning spent six months living among the monks of the Grand Chartreuse Charterhouse in the French Alps for his documentary ""Into Great Silence."" The filmmaker was granted unprecedented permission to film in 2002. This was not given lightly, for his request was put forth to the prior sixteen years earlier.

This is cinema at its purest and most exalted. It is hard to place into words a film, which is wrought in silence. For 162-minutes you will be allowed a glimpse of the ascetic strictness of the monks. I do not see this as a documentary, but an immersion into an entire way of life that will have no voiceovers or explanations. Just a small part of our time spent in transcendent meditation on the human pursuit of meaning, on man as a religious and social creature, on the form and function of symbols, ritual and traditions. And on the rhythms of work and prayer, night and day, winter and spring.

It is a beautiful film where everyone will take away something different and hopefully fulfilling. The film will not allow you to enter the world of the monks, but to just view it from the outside. You will see the day-to-day activities from season to season and be able to form your own opinions and conclusions. Many may at first experience impatience at the repetitions and variations encountered, but allow yourself time to adjust to the contemplative pace. And be witness to the ordinary moments that taken together are a representation of grace.

The Carthusian monks who are the subjects of this documentary do not have a great deal to say. Living in a light-filled stone charterhouse  in a picturesque valley in the French Alps, they bind themselves to a vow not of literal silence but of extreme reticence. We view the daily lives, prayers and routines of this most ascetic of Catholic Orders founded in 1084 by Saint Bruno. The monks, because of their vow of poverty, subsist on very little. They pray aloud at times and sing solemn Gregorian chants, but they rarely speak, except on there Monday walks.

The monks in their rigor and discipline find their freedom and fulfillment. Your view on the monastery and our world will change as the movie progresses. And isn't that what a good movie or book is suppose to accomplish? It is a world of yesteryear as it existed one thousand years ago, where some modern technology has crept in, as you will see. In our modern world of moral decay this gives us a window to a traditional Catholic existence. A two thousand year tradition of following the Desert Fathers into a way of life that is rarely, if ever, seen.

I feel that this film is about the presence of God, a God who is there for those who seek Him with their whole hearts. In the film only a blind monk offers some simple but piercing observations on Christian happiness, abandonment to God's providential care, and the tragedy of the loss of faith and meaning in the modern world.

This film is not only for Catholics, it is for everyone in the world to see and benefit from.",1176163200,435,3141,4.679347826086956

2754229,4,B000N3SOSE,"This almost silent three hour documentary tracks the daily lives of Carthusian monks living at the Chartreuse Monastery in the French Alps, as they live in a way that seems to be in such contrast with the modern world. It's a fascinating movie if you are able to get into the slow rhythm of the film (if you are still in the movie theater after an hour, you will probably made it to the third hour). By the same token, it would be almost impossible to see it in your house on DVD, since there are so many possible distractions that would make you want to stop the film. Remarkably, given that European filmmakers tend to be among the most secular people in the world, the movie is also surprisingly respectful of the choices made by the monks in living in this particular way.",1175731200,133,776,4.395833333333333

No matter your religious leanings or belief system, this is a marvelous film to watch. It is a literal going into great silence yet the lack of dialogue and sound is not a bad thing. In fact, it is what makes the story so poignant and enlightening. The subject matter, chronicling the Carthusian monks at the Grande Chartreuse monastery in France, dissolves into a charming and poetic cinema of light, shadows and above all, simplicity. It may not sound exciting, and actually it is not meant to be; nonetheless, it captivates you and pulls you in. I find it to be an engrossing and timeless film and I make an effort to watch it two or three times a year as a way to find inner silence and balance again.

2754250,5,B000N3SOSE,"This is a different kind of DVD. It explains to the viewer in images, much less than in words. There are in fact few words in this DVD that goes beyond two hours. However, I found it to be engaging and led me to wonder what will be next. The Carthusian way of life is very difficult and can only be lived with special Graces from our Creator. As one learns about the hours of the day and night we learn of the sacrifices these men make; of the joy they experience in total silence, their care for one another especially for elderly and for a blind monk who carries on as theough he were Sighted. I recommend this DVD for anyone interested in Monastic life according to the Carthusian way. The Carthusians have a motto that says: ""We have never been reformed because we have never been deformed."" Their founder came up with a way of life that helps the members get to heaven. They have not needed to change things to a modern time that they do not participate in anyway. There are important lessons for all here.",1447113600,3,1011,4.326315789473684

2754263,3,B000N3SOSE,"We were interested in the monastic impulse, the need for some people to shut themselves away from the world for a life of solitude and contemplation.  These monks have opted for a particularly severe version of that, to the extent that they even take their meals in solitude in their cells.  The director opted for long, steady shots, which we like as a film-making device - just point the camera and let the story unfold - but when the ""story"" is about solitude and meditation, those long shots can get pretty boring - watching someone meditate, or long shots of snow falling, are  probably not the most interesting subjects for a film.

2754288,5,B000N3SOSE,"This is the most profoundly moving and beautiful film I've ever seen. I could put this movie on repeat and just let it play over and over while I go about my day to be reminded of the simple beauty there is in life.

As a film - as a work of art - I can't think of another film this successful in achieving its intended purpose: to completely pull you into its world and allow you to actually live inside and fully experience each moment as if you are there and taking part in the events of the film. I felt like I, too, was a monk in a remote monastery of the Carthusian Order in France whose days were spent in silence, prayer, contemplation, and work.

And I think that this experience I felt was the plot of this film, a film that otherwise does not have a plot. We become a character in the film, we experience stillness, we contemplate the (repeated) words of God, we eat simple fruits and bread and drink only water, we experience the drifts of snow and motes of dust in the sunbeams that fall across the window pane.

Yet on another level everything is mysterious, too. Each monk is filmed for a few moments looking directly at us, their faces calm, serious, but also deeply happy. These are men who understand life in a way none of the rest of us do, they have found a peace and a stillness within themselves and with each other that is at once recognizable to an outsider but also nearly unattainable. Only through experiencing this film can we, on the one hand, begin to understand their deep understanding and peace, but on the other, through our experience come to realize how difficult and how far away from those emotions we really are.

An hour into the film I began to contemplate what would motivate a person, especially a young person, to want to be initiated into this world. Nobody who becomes a monk does so lightly, but even the most prepared person cannot really know what lay ahead of them, what the rest of their life will actually be. This life is a simple, quiet life, but also it must be extremely difficult. Every day is spent in prayer, and quiet reflection of the word of God. They sit and stand and kneel (very Catholic) countless times alone in their room in a very uncomfortable looking wooden prayer station. They cut and chop wood, attend to the animals, make their own robes, tend their own vegetable gardens, and even pay the bills. Their lives are regimented but they also seem to have nothing but time.

Theirs is a world of contradiction that is not contradictory. They are free yet they are cloistered. They are silent, but they also speak. They are still but they are also busy. They are alone but they are together. Their lives are difficult but also beautiful. At one point in the film one of the two initiates explains, in Chant, the multiple natures of the Christian God: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. To most people this is always the most confusing aspect of the faith to comprehend because it seems totally contradictory - how can God also be his own Son and how can those two unique identities also be part of a greater third: the Trinity? - and yet this monk does not seem to see any contradiction, in fact their texts explain that the existence of this Trinity is enough evidence to believe in it.

And so perhaps you would need to spend your entire life living this way to make sense of this conception of life and the universe and the complexities but also simplicity of their faith. And for two and a half hours I did feel as if I at least understood why they live this way and was able to experience, for a moment, the peace and stillness they must feel every day of their lives and for the rest of their lives.",1406332800,6,3681,4.382137628111273

Or it could be a helpful aid to meditation for anyone seeking relief from a complicated, noisy modern world. The photography captures stunning natural beauty and the beauty of a simple way of life.

This film reveals a perfect harmony between the natural beauty of the Chartreuse Mountains and the people who live a life of prayer.

As a serious student of meditation and prayer I gained some insight into a meaningful life of silence, devotion and hard work. The interview with the elder monk was deeply inspiring. In his own words he tells us how serving God and hard work is a practical and meaningful life. That interview alone provides the viewer with a perfect balance between words and deep silence.

2754297,4,B000N3SOSE,"I like a movie that gives me something to look at, something to think about, and then plenty of time to observe and think about it. Into Great Silence does this to the extreme, which doesn't work if you're looking for entertainment or aren't in the right mood. I don't think I can match the first time I saw it in theaters, which somehow felt more meditative in the darkness, sharing the experience with the rest of the audience. I remember thinking that every person in the audience was on their own train of thought, noticing something different. (Well, I know this was the case because some walked out!)

I was a bit disappointed by the image quality in parts of the movie. Some scenes were grainy (the beginning falling snow, for instance) on an HD TV, and some even had those black blips you see in old films or at the theater. It wasn't enough to distract me terribly and the majority of the scenes were fine, but I don't understand why such a visual film would have issues like that.",1395878400,2,990,4.43956043956044

2754301,5,B000N3SOSE,"When I first viewed ""Into Great Silence"" it was unsettling. Over time I have come to understand there is a longing in us to be separated from the sound and noise of fury around us and the electronics driven tyranny of the urgent.

It is quite possible that we do not know our innerself & spirit of our being yearns to find a real place of peace. While this concept may be far from being an actual experience for us, can we carve out a piece of it to nurture who we are? Is there a place that allows the external and inner distractions to vanish?

When we decide where that special space is, it becomes a sacred space for us. A time and place to schedule on our calendar so that it will be something that we know will help to center us. It may not spot the excessive demands on our time but. We may be better able to make sense of what the inner self truly needs and adjust our priorities accordingly.

Watching Into Great Silence may provide a chance to find that elusive peace with the intention of establishing a great silence in our lives. Then our lives will be open to change what ultimately matters.

I suppose one has to be dedicated to the concept of finding one's way back to the Allness of the Universe(s) or God (as a succinct encapsulation of this concept) to be at peace with the silence and seeming ""non-doing"" even in their day to day activity. Sometimes I found the juxtaposed scene transitions a bit distracting though I can't think of a specific example at the moment.

I have only one difficulty which has to do with the English translations of the sub-titled contemplations, which seem to overlook the significance of the very subtle reflexive French verbs, e.g., ""Vois, je me suis fait homme! comes to me, in essence, as ""Observe that I have made myself man"" (from the German text... ""see then, I am become Man""); ""Si vous refusiez de devenir dieu avec mois, vous serez injustes envers moi"",... ""If you refuse to become God with me, then you are not right toward me"" (from the German ""if you would not become God with me, then you do me Wrong.""

I strongly recommend the ""Bonus"" material, in particular: the Director's account and the chanted office. I was in a moderately contemplative Benedictine house, and judge the portrayal of monastic life offered here to be not misleading (of course, Carthusians spend much more time in ""private prayer and meditation""). But it is difficult to show the balance of a monk's day, let alone a whole monastery's year, in under 3 hours.

From a technical point of view, the cinematic genius and accomplishment was in editing, arranging pieces to produce a unity. My own experience allows me to fill in the interstices between the peekaboo bits in montage and I am not sure what someone would come away with who does not know monastery life.

A friend of mine resents the inclusion of their silly snow play and petty worries about drying their fingers before choir; but these bits better than the solemn portraits give an insight into the holy simplicity of minds continually focussed on God.

One power of this movie sets it apart from all others I know of. On standing up to leave many or most movies, it is not unusual to have a feeling of being slightly tainted by their ideas or images. Whenever I watch Into Great Silence, I feel not only relaxed but somehow purified.",1371427200,3,1432,4.648221343873518

I've always had a love for the church's eremitic orders and I didn't want to get my hopes up too high. I mean after all, how can a movie portray life in an eremitical monastery accurately without being ""staged?""  Well, it turns out nothing was staged as the film maker lived with the monks for six months and was able to become part of the community for the duration of his stay.

Most importantly the lack of dialogue added, in a strange way, to the sense of communication.  I felt not as if I was I watching a movie but rather spending time IN the monastery.  The monks chanting in the early morning hours couldn't have been more soul grabbing and I would have bought the dvd just for that.

Into Great Silence ranks as my favorite movie.

They put aside everything that might stand in the way of directly experiencing the presence of God. Their day-to-day life stands in marked contrast to our hurried, frantic, stressed-out lives. This film is nearly three hours long, but you'll be sorry when it ends. It's greatest achievement is that it somehow conveys what it FEELS like to live this life.

As the film went on, I turned out lights, put another log on the fire and watched with deepening peace and awareness. A remarkable experience.

2754349,5,B000N3SOSE,"This movie is mesmerising. It's in French with English subtitles - but there's hardly any dialogue anyway. It's Into Great Silence. The Carthusians, when approached by the film-maker, told him it was not the right time and they'd be in touch in perhaps 10 or 13 years. Sixteen years later they contacted him and approved the doco. These are Christians who know how to wait on God and understand His seasons and times. They are locked into heaven.

A prophet I know taught that God's timing of this doco (it's the first that reveals this Order to world) was for teaching the modern church, in this day and hour, how to really ""live in Christ"" and to show modern intercessors what a real life of prayer looks like. A fundamentalist prophetic minister encouraging modern ""prayer-warriors"" to learn from ancient Catholic Monks is a good and strong endorsement - of the doco, of the Order, and of God's timing which the Carthusians seemed to understand.

The Monastery has been praying/living this way for 1000 years and the movie manages to portray their holiness - probably because their holiness is pervasive, even when they're ""at play"" in the snow. The cinematography is also beautiful. Anyone serious about Jesus needs to watch this.",1327795200,10,1234,4.871428571428571
2754350,4,B000N3SOSE,"This one popped up on my netflix list of documentaries and, intrigued by the title I tuned in.

Initially I sat there somewhat stunned, I was missing the point. There are a lot of still shots, no dialogue (obviously), no background music and at first I felt sad for, what I felt, were a group of societal misfits that had found a home. That's somewhat of an oxymoron as, I should have felt happy that they had found a home. I wasn't yet in the right frame of mind to fully appreciate what I was watching.

The next emotion I felt was a sort of enlightenment, I started to ""get it"". These monks were doing what so many of us can only hope to do in our lives. They had found their personal zone. Their life involved no outside influences, no schedule other than prayer ritual, no worries about ""stuff"", no bills they couldn't pay and all the other stresses we experience on a day to day basis.

The last third of the documentary had me in awe of them. Interspersed with watching them go about their daily rituals, are still shots of the monks just sitting staring at the camera. I noticed a serene, contentment in their eyes. Each of them had a look of quiet calm bordering on some kind of euphoria that, I feel, I'll never experience.

As the documentary came to a close, I'd taken on a feeling of peace. The scenery around the monastery was breath taking and the life of these monks I came to envy. I didn't envy them as monks but I did envy their tranquility and remoteness. They were living a life free of burden and blurred lines.

I was reminded of the story of Dick Proenneke who, in 1968, at age 51 dropped out of civilization and built himself a cabin in a remote part of Alaska.

I came away from this documentary somewhat envious of the peace these folks had found. It must be hard to switch off the noise in your head and devote yourself to your personal cause, in this case, devotion to God.

This DVD is ACCURATE. What you are seeing is , yes, the real McCoy. You are seeing Carthusian life as it really is.
They live in solitude the vast majority of the time. They  observe a STRICT routine and a very structured way of life.
They all dress the same, eat the same food and have to share a common frame of mind to ENDURE the rigid severity
of their existence. You cant play at being a Carthusian. LOOK CLOSELY. Pay attention to what you are seeing.

But remember always that these are just men. On that one Summers day when they are all released from routine and
they sit together out in the sunshine, on the ONE SINGLE day of the year when they can mix and share whatever comes
 to mind, speaking freely about their idle moment...together. The ONLY day in the year when they are ALLOWED to do this.
WHAT do they discuss? You will see the scene in the DVD film...what is it that they discuss? What is it these saints and
 martyrs discuss among themselves on the ONLY day they can speak about ANYthing that comes to their minds?

Listen to them. watch for it, the moment will pass quickly and you may miss it as the film progresses.
In that ONE moment of freedom what is the subject these Divines discuss? ONCE a year and what do they
 choose to talk about out of all the subjects they could choose?

They discuss the number of toilets they have in their monastery as compared to the greater number of toilets
 that are found in another Order's monastery. And one gets the impression that they are PROUD that they have
 fewer toilets than the effete Cistercians, the lax and wavering weak Cistercians over the hill.

Vainglory....for all of their life...they are still subject to the human foible of vainglory. THAT is true
Monasticism. I love the men and I love their striving, but I know the human ass when I see it.

As fot the deep purpose of the Life, it is THERE. But you have to have an eye for God and an ear.
And it is bought with great loneliness. And a superhuman faith. No matter what their faults,
they are there .....and they do endure.",1307491200,12,2179,4.355555555555555

2754358,5,B000N3SOSE,"I first stumbled upon this movie several weeks ago in a Catholic book shop. The phoograph on the front of the DVD case immediately aroused my curiosity. After picking up the dvd and reading about this film and the ridiculously positive reviews from such respected sources as the New York Times, the L.A. Times, and Newsweek, I knew that this was a film I didn't just want to watch but needed for my collection.
I ordered the film on Amazon and waited anxiously for it's arrival.
When it finally came in the mail and I was able to sit down and watch the nearly 3 hours of a film that has no narration, no accompanying score or soundtrack (the only music in the film is the Gregorian chants sung by the monks), and such a non-traditional movie structure that you lose all concept of time while you are viewing it, I was utterly surprised by just how watchable, and even more, how enjoyable and hypnotic I found this film to be.

In a time when big Hollywood studios are releasing films that try to give the audience MORE...more action, more special effects, more sex, louder
sound effects, and soundtracks that seem to almost never cease throughout the course of a film, Into Great Silence and it's director Philip Groning have taken this film in the complete opposite direction and succeeded on a level where, in my opinion, 90% of films coming out of Hollywood fail. Into Great Silence is a masterpiece of film and should be required viewing for all producers and directors; the same big studio directors and producers who constantly try to give the audience more (which has accounted for the extended lengths of so many films nowadays) when, in fact, what these producers should really be doing is scaling back their grandiose ambitions to focus on painting a picture with story, pacing, and character development, a l Into Great Silence.

German director Philip Groning spent 6 months living in the famed Carthusian monastery with these cloistered and devout monks, learning about their daily routines and rituals. When Groning and his cameras left the monastery he came away with so much more than just showing these monks in prayer, deep meditation, and at work. Groning has somehow managed to suspend time with Into Great Silence, and we move along with the film at the pace of the monks, not the pace of the camera shots.

There are some truly beautiful and poignant moments in this film such as the first time we are allowed to view a few minutes of the Night Office, which is a hymnal prayer and meditation session that these monks engage in on a nightly basis and usually lasts anywhere from 2-3 hours. Scenes that also come to mind are the sledding scene towards the end of the film when we realize that these monks truly are just men and regular people, like you and I, with the exception that they have acquired such a loving devotion to Christ and have trained themselves in a daily discipline that includes so many worldly sacrifices that most people just cannot fathom it. The Carthusian monks really do live by the old adage, ""Be in the world but be not of the world.""
A scene towards the end of the film shares a perspective on life and faith from one of the monks who we have been seeing throughout the movie but only in the background. He is blind, and while we are not directly informed, we believe he has been blind for his whole life. When this monk tells the camera that he thanks God everyday for his blindness because it has been for the betterment of his soul, even the most skeptical viewer would not be able to hide the feeling of raw emotion at these words and admiration for this old monk who has dedicated his life to the service of Christ in the monastery.

I could go on for several more paragraphs writing about and describing the beauty of this film and how it just seems to get so much right whereas most films coming out of Hollywood nowadays just seem to get so much wrong, but instead, I will just leave you with the exhortation to SEE THIS FILM! I promise you will not be disappointed. Be patient and let the slow and progressive pacing of the film slow down your own hurried and racing mind, which, until you watch this film, you may not have even known was racing and hurried in the first place.",1279411200,7,4237,4.541884816753926

THere is nothing other than that to say.

In the opening sequences, the snow falls, the silence encloses, and the face in prayer for 5 minutes doesn't move, you think it is a photo, and then you realise you are in the presence of the Lord, in the stillness, simplicity, calmness and gentle service and brotherhood of these who live in the cave in the mountains.

Simply. THis is a retreat, and a movement to the heart of Christian mysticism, not by needing to use words, but simply by answering the original response to the question : ""Lord where do you live?"" and He said :""COme and see"".

This is a treasure, a pearl of great price, and can only be highly recommended to all, but especially to those who have followed the ways of formation, and know the hours and the tension of 'retreat' and living in community, and its resultant love of the Lord.

2754360,5,B000N3SOSE,"I watched Into Great Silence one night alone at home, in the dark, in the middle of winter. It was cold, but it somehow felt right to watch it without the comfort of warmth, in a state of more ascetic purity. This is an unusual film, not so much a documentary as an act of meditation conducted through film. The camera watches and contemplates much the same way as the Carthusian monks do, in unhurried and watchful silence, without commentary. Nothing much 'happens', but we get a clear sense of what this kind of life means; the putting aside of distractions and noise in order to hear the voice of God beneath the silence, and to pray for the world. The monks are still human, though, and it is refreshing to see their recreation and the weathered faces of the old men who have spent a lifetime in the mountains.

Many people who have given this a poor rating have found it long and boring. It was certainly 'difficult' to watch to the end, but I attribute this to my own restless mind. Imagine a lifetime of quiet watching and waiting rather than a mere couple of hours! We begin to see the foolishness and insanity of most of the ways that we structure our time and activities. Can we be truly human without silence?

It may be a while before I watch Into Great Silence again, but even one viewing has created a small place in my mind of quiet and reflection to come back to when I need it. It ends with an extended shot of the single candle in the darkness of the chapel at night, the light in the darkness that cannot be overcome.

Footsteps. The buzz of an electric razor. A waterfall. Thunder. Gregorian chant. Laughter. Bells. A smiling monk.

The richness in simplicity.  The monks' sunday conversation is humorous, intellectual and captivating. Many may not appreciate their completeness.  They love God and the natural world and it is sufficient.  Their simplicity is mysterious and intriguing.

2754363,5,B000N3SOSE,"A very meditative, unusual movie. There are no words, no voice over, simply following the daily  activities of the monks who took vows of silence. The Carthusian monks living in the monastery (Le Grand Chartreuse)secluded in the  mountains close to Grenoble committed to a totally different life style than the rest of us. This is a contemplative order,which means there is not much contact to the  outside world, but vows of silence and daily activties filled with prayer and introspection, living a life in a close, loving  relation to the divine. The cloistered life is in addition to a lot of prayer, is simple life in poverty and simple labor, which labor can be also a very hard work, and this movies is showing it giving us the pace of monks life, the glimpses into their cells, their work, their vespers, and even their fun as they frolic on the snow on Sunday, when they can talk. This documentary gives us the opportunity to witness their way of achieving their lives' calling, their  happiness, toil and sense of humor.

I saw this movie three times at a movie theater. It really drew me in. It is a very slow going movie, but this is the pace of monastery life. Visually stunning piece. We  see the interiors filmed  in their natural light conditions, which often required high speed film, so, you see grain from time to time, (but probably not on the small screens)but it ads to the unusual climate of the piece. We see the details, like for example monk's ear, or drops of water falling. And we can  hear monks sometimes talking, (rarely), not only chanting. There are sparse interviews, and when they frolic on the snow, they talk too. Or the old monk feeding the cats calls them lovingly. But most of the time the movie is silent. So, take your time, take a meditative, patient ride into another spiritual world. The movie is long, and peaceful. A very  unusual documentary. Not only the director spend  six months living in the cloister, but also it took twelve years for the monastery to decide to allow a movie maker to come under their roof. But it seems that the patience got well rewarded. We have even a very rare glimpse into a ceremony of accepting new monks. A stunning movie.",1266364800,7,2202,4.6061381074168795
2754364,5,B000N3SOSE,"Halfway through the film I said to my wife about a scene that struck me as particularly well-composed, this looks like a painting. Most of the film, she said, looks like a painting. And she's right. It does.  Into Great Silence is perhaps one of the most beautiful movies of recent years, a cinematic poem of tranquility and serenity that may leave you wishing you didn't have to return to your hurried life in a noisy, cluttered world.

German director Philip Grning lived for six months with the Carthusian monks of the Grand Charteuse, a 17th century monastery in the picturesque quietude of the French Alps. With no crew and shooting only in natural light, he followed the renunciates on their daily rounds, capturing the languid flow of days filled with prayer, study, and labor. What he produced in the editing process is described in his publicity material as a document ""seek[ing] to embody a monastery, rather than simply depict[ing] one."" That is, Grning offers the viewer the opportunity to experience the life of the monastic, rather than be told about it. There is no narration, no explanatory subtitling, no score, and except for the passing of days and the passing of seasons essentially no narrative.

What you might find while viewing is exactly what you experience when you live quietly in sheltered environments. You begin to notice detail. Small details that your mind usually flirts over in a rush to complete a task or in search of more gross forms of stimulation. Close shots of a masticating jaw, a piece of fruit, a length of hanging cloth, or a wash basin suggest Grning experienced the same. When you take away the cacophony of telephones, television, cinema, radio, and the internet, when you take away the need to live by the clock, to keep appointment books, to always be in a rush, your senses have a chance to rest, to experience the rhythm and pulse of the body. And then you find the most mundane things intriguingly beautiful - the grain in a piece of wood, the dance of dust motes in a sun beam, the play of water over rocks, trees swaying in the breeze. Quite suddenly, the world is full of wonder.

Is it any surprise, then, that though they lead what most would consider lives of deprivation, the monks of the Grand Charteuse appear to be men whose lives are filled with great happiness.

2754365,5,B000N3SOSE,"The screen silently opens to reveal a lone monk quietly and deeply in prayer. He is so still one wonders if this is really a photograph. But, ever so slight movements from his mouth assure that this is indeed no photo and the camera simply continues to linger on his entranced like kneeling form.

 From there, a title card quotes 1 Kings concerning how the LORD was found not in the earthquake or in the lightning, but in a small whisper (19:11-12). Thus begins ""Into Great Silence,"" Director Philip Groening's spiritual odyssey into the simple monastic lives of the monks of the Carthusian Order; one of the most strictly ascetic monastic orders within the Roman Catholic Church.

Philip Groening had originally sent a letter of request to film the lives of the Carthusian Order based at the Grand Chartreuse. Twenty years later they accepted his request. Groening lived and worked among the Order while filming.

Rather than rely on a more traditional narrative format found in other documentaries, Groening aims at seeing that the film's flow is more in harmony with this movie's title. And, he does it most beautifully and provocatively, making this film one of the richest spiritual experiences recorded as more of a contemplative work than a typical documentary.

We receive an inside view into monks' daily lives, from their hours of prayer, to labor out in the garden, and in other simple activities like one certain monk's feeding of cats, which makes for an entertaining and amusing scene. We also witness the passing of time and seasons changing at a deliberate pace. Day darkens into night, and night passes by to be illuminated again by day. The snowy cold winter melts into the bright sunshine of Spring, and then back into Winter all without hesitation and acceptance as if through the monks' eyes.

The Order's Rule involves a Vow of Silence, but on Sundays, the brothers are allowed to walk outside and engage in conversation with one another. They make the most of this time. And, a scene with the monks sliding down a snow covered hill in winter reminds viewers that though they're in a strict Order, the brothers haven't forgotten how to have fun!

This way of life is shown to bring peace and joy. A sense of peace and joy which is shared to the audience by a blind monk who speaks directly to the camera; one of the few talking spots in a film truly dedicated to Silence and the spiritual realities beneath. The film conveys the Order's way of life in its motto: ""Stat crux dum volvitur orbis, which is Latin for ""The Cross is steady while the world is turning.""",1261699200,4,2585,4.731111111111111
2754366,1,B000N3SOSE,"""Silence is God's first language."" You will see this quotation from St. John of the Cross on the phamplette in the CD case. The director made a wrong choice in that he used God's language instead of human's. Shortly, this film is as much superficial as the silence itself which surrounds the monastery physically. Silence in itself is nothing. It's just like a vacuum. I understand the intention of the director, but his intention is not supported by normal human psychology. It only brings irritation to the audience. Maybe he wanted his film to be interpreted in many different ways by them. But it's his own thinking. His own interpretation omitted the medium through which we can access to his intention.

Foremost, he wasted the precious time, which relates with the fact that monks do waste time in their monastery. When the director intermittently showed the faces of the monks, I thought that I was looking at the prisoners. Paradoxically, they are actually prisoners of love for God. If these are what the director aimed at, it's a great success. But it's not an appropriate and conscientious way of sharing his experience in the monastery for six months with other people who want to know the depths and reasons of the life of the monks. If this is a documentary which appeals only to our heart and soul, not to intellect, then it is not a documentary at all. It's just a propaganda for Catholic Church. In my thought, through this film, Carthusian orders will lose many vocations. His approach too much idealise monks lives and separate from the secular world. But they are only an extension of any other monasteries practicing looser rules than Carthusians.

The only thing I was surprised at was that I mistook the ear of the monk on the first scene for a wound in Jesus' heart.

What would Thomas Merton (who was tempted to join this Order) say if he is alive and see this film? He'll be very much disappointed, I think.

2754367,3,B000N3SOSE,"Sure, the story of the filmmaker being invited to the monastery 16 years later is intriguing, and the shots of the interior of the monastery are interesting up to a point.  But I don't think this film is all that it's being made out to be.

People are complaining about the slow pace.  Maybe, but the obvious rejoinder to that is to say that Groning was attempting to capture the slow, deliberate rhythm of life in the Grande Chartreuse.  And sure enough, when you're done with this film (a long one), you will actually feel as if you have spent some time up there in the French Alps.

The problem, as I see it, is this:  if such was Groning's ""brilliant"" approach, then he dropped the ball in a much more important regard.

If I could sum up the lives of these monks in one word, it would be ""ordo,"" order.  They've got a highly regimented life, very institutionalized.  Not only have they got the matins, vespers, complines, etc., but their meals are being served at exactly the same time every day.

If the filmmaker was so cleverly trying to capture the spirit of their lives up there, why does he engage in so many MTV-style jump cuts from candles, to leaves, to snowy mountains, to icicles melting, to celery being cut, etc.  If he was so earnest about capturing the spirit of their routine, he should have injected more order into his editing, I feel.  Perhaps this could have been accomplished with a color scheme?  Music?

As it is, the film seems to jump around haphazardly from theme to theme, in a way that the lives of the monks certainly don't.",1247875200,5,1558,4.4787234042553195

I saw it in a theater, and it's an incredibly fascinating, meditative film.  To peer into the monastic lifestyle is a pleasure and a rare thing indeed.  The inside of the monastery is breathtaking beautiful and so other worldly, and when the monks adventure outside, it's also beautiful and kind of funny (there's a completely unexpected scene where we see the monks goofing off and sliding down a snow filled hill).  It's almost like a science fiction film, where you've discovered an entire planet that you never thought existed.  The film runs just under 3 hours, but it doesn't feel long at all.  Despite its title and what some have said, there is dialogue/spoken words in the film.  Prayers are uttered, and the head of the monastery does talk to the camera crew.  He says that people live away from God these days, and I believe him to be right.  But that's for another review.

The only quips I have with the film are that it's shot on digital video (and is hard to see at times), and the intertitles.  I think the director put these intertitles in the film just to break the film into sections.  They don't really make any sense from a formal or an artistic standpoint.

2754375,5,B000N3SOSE,"In creating ""Into Great Silence"" German documentary filmmaker Philip Groning has succeeded in introducing 21st century audiences to the obscure and mysterious life of Carthusian monks of the motherhouse of the Grande Chartreuse high in the Swiss Alps.

After first establishing contact with the monks over 19 years ago, Groning was finally permitted to enter the walls of the monastery with his camera to record the lifestyle of this obscure penitential order that traces its foundations back to St. Bruno and six companions in 1084. With a year of on-location shooting, ""Into Great Silence"" brings the silence, repetition and rhythm of the monastery to a world that is increasingly loosing the ability to appreciate and comprehend this kind of radical religious devotion.

What makes this documentary unique is the fact that it visually describes the life of the monks, inside the monastery, through simple observations of their day-to-day activities. There are no voice-overs, no interviews and no background music beyond the occasional Gregorian plainsong chant. It is entirely shot from a `fly on the wall' perspective, following the monks, both old and young, as they go about their daily rituals of rising for late night prayers at 1am, spiritual reading, liturgical worship, manual labor and communal gatherings.

Through this novel approach the viewer himself is induced to participate in a kind of cinematic meditation on the contemplative life. The series of visual impressions enhance an understanding based not on a rational analysis of the merits of religious life, but on one's own emotional responses in conjunction with one's already existing intuitions about Christianity.

""Into Great Silence"" opens with a young monk at prayer, alone and in his cell. We hear nothing but the sound of wood crackling in his small heater-stove. Here he spends the majority of his 12 hours of daily prayer, alone and in silence. He is interrupted only occasionally by either a visit to the church for community prayer, fraternal exercises, or by a brother delivering vegetarian meals through a small food-hatch, or ""guichet,"" in the wall.

Within the first five minutes of the film, Groning has managed to expose the stark truth of the Carthusian religious life - as it is in reality - creating a sever contrast with the sweet sentimentality and devotional glamour often resorted to by filmmakers exploring the religious genre. ""Into Great Silence"" is definitely not a promotional film for monastic vocations. Rather, it seems to delight in demystifying the life through a depiction of the monotonous drudgery of daily monastic minutiae.

The most fascinating part of the documentary seems to be the montage of head-shots or `portraits' of the monastery inmates. Groning is the first filmmaker to actually be able to capture, on camera, the monks individually and up-close. He took advantage of this special dispensation to record their faces as they stare blankly into the camera. What we see are the faces of old men, time-worn and wrinkled. We see young men, with bookish demeanors and awkward expressions. Yet through this we gain a glimpse into the religious mind and the desire for a share in the promised ""peace that the world cannot give.""

The thought of watching a documentary over 160 minutes in length, may seem somewhat intimidating. But remarkably, the film is able to keep the viewer engaged in a way that may surprise even the most secular of movie buffs. Perhaps this film simply satisfies the same morbid kind of curiosity that fuels the recent `reality show' craze that has transformed television drama. But, in Groning's defense, it is not the satisfaction gained by observing show participants engaged in mundane life activities that interests us. It is the fascination of attempting to comprehend why individuals, who appear altogether average and normal, would give up all that life has to offer to live a severe life alone and apart. And all for a distant and some would say ""illusory,"" goal of intimacy with God - a God that the European media, and the general movie-going public, is becoming increasingly estranged from. But then again, perhaps a spiritual ignorance that breeds curiosity is what has fueled interest in this documentary in our post-Christian age.

As the Western world continues to move further and further away from its historical roots in Christianity, ""Into Great Silence"" is destined to become a rare visual record of the lingering vestiges of the lived ideals of poverty, chastity, and simplicity that had, in previous times, laid the foundations of European society.",1230163200,5,4614,5.167336010709505

2754377,3,B000N3SOSE,"This is a very difficult movie to review. It's difficult, because it is what it is, an untainted window into the lives of monks in a monastery. However, it is not something that you watch because you want to be entertained in the Hollywood sense of the word. Granted, Hollywood does very little entertaining these days, but I think you get my drift. We took this DVD out of the library, and it wasn't till we were 10 minutes in when it hit us, this film is 2+ hours of monks going about their lives in a monastery in Switzerland, and there is no narrator. You will be a fly on the wall watching monks do what monks do, and let me tell you, that isn't much. They don't even talk very much. So be forewarned, there are no car chases in this one.
  The lack of action doesn't surprise me. I didn't expect that, but I was curious to learn a bit more about these guys and what made them join the brotherhood, etc. With that in mind, I was a little let down.
  The film is beautifully shot. I will give it that. I will also say that it is very peaceful. You get sucked into the silence and the rapture of the place. Perhaps that was the filmmaker's intention. In a way, words aren't needed, because the silence says it all.
  I give this film 3 stars, because I do feel that it did what it was supposed to do, and it is beautiful to watch, but I was hoping it would be more of a documentary. Maybe that is simply my expectations getting in the way. Whatever the case, just be warned about what you are getting yourself into before you buy or rent this.",1228608000,40,1546,4.153846153846154
2754378,3,B000N3SOSE,"What's this?  A two-hour-and-forty-one-minute long documentary on an order of monks who have taken a vow of silence - a film almost completely devoid of speech and musical accompaniment and fully devoid of narration?  How audacious a concept is that?!

""Into Great Silence"" focuses on some Carthusian monks who reside at the Grande Chartreuse Monastery tucked away in a remote corner of the soaring French Alps.  With rare exceptions, all we hear for the duration of the movie are natural sounds (birds chirping, water dripping, leaves rustling, feet shuffling, brooks babbling), the tolling of bells, and the signing of Latin hymns.  We watch as the monks go through their well-oiled rituals of meditation, prayer and daily chores.  With the visuals having to carry so much of the weight of the film, I'm happy to report that the imagery is often quite stunning, resembling nothing less than beautifully composed landscapes and warmly-lit still-lifes brought to sudden life.  And, at times, ""Into Great Silence"" serves as a welcome balm to our aching ears which seem to be under almost constant assault from the cacophony of the modern world.

Yet, just how ""great"" you'll feel the silence is may depend on whether you view cloistering itself as the ultimate act of piety, devotion and self-denial, or as an act of cowardice and selfishness, giving a person permission to retreat from the harsh realities of life and to relinquish all personal responsibility for making the world a better place in which to live.  It may take a special person to be both willing and able to shun so much of the pointless jabbering that consumes our lives on a daily basis, but there's still something to be said for being a part of the one species on the planet that is able to truly engage one another through our speech and words.  That seems, somehow, too precious a gift to be traded in so cheaply for a trouble-free life.

""Into Great Silence"" is certainly not for all audiences, and it does go on way too long, no doubt about that.  Some viewers will find the movie refreshing and therapeutic, while others will be driven out of their skulls with boredom.  To be honest, I had a little of both reactions while watching the film.  Congratulate yourself on your enlightenment and superhuman patience if you find yourself thoroughly entranced by the experience, but there's no real reason to feel like a Philistine if you don't.",1226188800,5,2415,4.8585365853658535

It makes you realize how everything we do is to the Glory of God, and you can see that these monks do EVERYTHING slowly, neatly and well done. All is done for Christ, they do not worry about anything, they do not fear anything. They just live their lives for Christ and that is it. You walk away from it peaceful and a bit more focused, and with a
realization of how fearful we are even when we didn't realize it. This is one that I will be watching again and again. It's like reading a spiritual book, you gain so much from reading it the first time, but you desire to go back to it again and again and pull more out of it.

2754382,5,B000N3SOSE,"For anyone who has ever wondered what life is like inside the strictest of all Catholic religious orders, this film gives the ultimate insight. No other director could have done better with the limited resources at-hand.

For those of us who are accustomed to modern life, with all its noise and contact with other people, along with the flood of information and news we are bombarded with every waking minute, this film goes into the little-known world of men who have turned their backs on all of this and gone into cloister. Rather than working to pay bills, juggling a career and raising a family, these men devote their lives to serving God. Their life's purpose upon entering the monastic life of the Carthusian Order is to seek their own salvation and to pray for the salvation of the world. What higher calling could anyone aspire to and live with?

Although I am not Catholic, I did enjoy this film. Even without modern lighting, background music or dialogue (all the things we take for granted in films today) ""Into Great Silence"" is still a spell-binding movie to watch and admire the singular dedication of the Carthusians.

As far as who should see this film and who should not:

Shoulds: people interested in monastic life, either seeking to enter it or are studying it. I don't think you need to be Catholic to appreciate it.

Should Nots: people used to lots of noise in their movies. Lots of music, dialogue and special effects. The inclusion of these things - indeed, the overdoing of their additions - have become so much a part of modern films that storlines are left to suffer.

The only thing that I feel is missing is something of an explanation from the monks as to why they chose to join the Carthusian Order, the strictest monastic order in the Catholic Church. With all the order the Church has - Franciscans, Dominicans, Jesuits, etc - what led them to join the Carthusians?

Meditative and beautiful, this film will strike some viewers as painfully slow and often less than clear about what they are watching. If that is likely to be a problem, viewers should steer clear of this one.

However, if you are open to thought-provoking images and the opportunity to immerse oneself in the daily routines of a group of men who have chosen a totally different way of life - in particular to live in silence far away from this noisy world - then there's plenty to consider and ponder as a viewer takes the time that the subject warrants.

2754384,2,B000N3SOSE,"INTO GREAT SILENCE is more a sleep aid than a documentary. I think a more appropriate title would've been Into Great Boredom. Not for the men that chose to go to the Grand Chartreuse Monastery, but for how long, how slow, and how incredibly uninteresting this film was.

The only positives are some beautiful shots of the monastery with the French Alps as a backdrop, and how completely immersed the camera gets the viewer into the life of solitude and silence that these men purposely confine themselves.

But that's it.

Running well over two-and-a-half hours, the film could've easily been cut by half and still held the same level of immersion. Too many lingering shots on monks kneeling in prayer, monks praying in the dark (with the red candle of God ever-present), monks walking through hallways, monks sitting near windows, and just an otherwise tremendous amount of overly indulgent quiet (from the production standpoint). I know that the title has the word ""silence"" in it, and that these men take a vow as such when they enter the monastery, but I think a bit of interaction, explanation, or some sort of definitive purpose would've made the film much more enjoyable.

Before I get plowed asunder by those that enjoyed this film, let me make it clear that I understood  the nature of it. The silence. The length of the film in order to show the dedication one must have to go into the monastery. The unquestioning loyalty you must have in ""the divine spirit.""

2754397,4,B000N3SOSE,"Philip Groning's Into Great Silence is an interesting and abstract documentary on the daily lives of Carthusian monks at The Monastery of the Grande Chartreuse in France. There isn't any narration or music, only the natural sounds and voices that were recorded while filming. The film takes the viewer inside the monastery for a look at life far removed from society as we know it.

This unique film will bore some to tears, but I liked it very much. It's is an odd mixture of pure beauty and worn dullness. The monastery is old and mostly neglected, and the monks are very ordinary looking men who live in a sort of collective solitude. Every now and then, there are lovely images of nature's beauty, and scripture is intermittently shown in white on a black background.

One of the more striking things about Into Great Silence is that these men who have given up all worldly possessions and pleasures are completely dependent on God for their daily mental and spiritual fulfillment; and God provides it to them. They quietly go about their days, mostly alone, in work, recreation, prayer or contemplation. God is the center of their universe, and they wouldn't have it any other way.

The Into Great Silence viewer is a silent observer of the monks and their very quiet way of life. Without music and narration, you feel like you're ""there"" in the room, quietly watching as an apprentice would watch a master craftsman. The film requires dedication, and I was drawn right in from the very beginning.

At the end of Into Great Silence, I felt as if I had just gotten home after a long trip. My own home seemed different than before, a little pretentious in it's design, and almost like a public place compared to the monastery in the film. I felt different, too.

two-and-a-half-hour glimpse into the lives of the monks of the Great
Chartreuse in the French Alps. The Carthusians are one of the strictest
orders - living in solitude, but with prayer and a weekly meal in
common.

Yet this asceticism is not dour, nor is it world-denying. What impressed
me about the film is the care the director, Philip Groning, took to show
the details of the life of the monks - from the box of buttons in the tailor
shop to the fruit that accompanied the simple meals the monks eat in
their cells.

Groning paid particular attention to water - we see the monks dip their
fingers in the holy water font at the entrance to the church; we hear the
rain on the monastery roof; we even hear the monks during their weekly
time to talk together discussing whether the custom of a ritualistic
washing of hands before dinner should continue. The baptismal image
is just under the surface - dying with Christ, we rise with him.

The film is deeply sacramental - as are the lives of the monks. All of
creation can show the glory of God, from the incredible landscape
surrounding the monastery to the drops of water on a plate that has just
been washed.

Toward the end of the film the monks in choir are singing the
""Benedicite,"" the canticle of the three young men in the fiery furnace,
in Daniel 3:52-88: ""All creation is called to bless the Lord - fire, water,
whales, humans. Let all that is, bless the Lord.""

If you have about three hours and want to experience a Lenten
discipline of silence, take time to watch this film. And then take time
to bless the Lord.

However, I was a little disappointed in two of the translations into
English. The text of Jeremiah should read: ""You seduced me, Lord, and
I let myself be seduced."" The Gospel text should read, ""No one who
does not deny himself and follow me can be my disciple."" Minor
details, in a film that is almost free of words.",1207872000,5,1965,4.414364640883978

It doesn't 'describe' or 'explain', it simply 'is'.  162 minutes long, it will seem longer.  After the first half hour or so, you will begin to sense what the days in this stark context are like.

It is truly a visit to the 11th century.  The Carthusians were one of the many, many efforts to try to 'reform' the failed Roman Catholic fixation with monasticism.  As such, Christians will find the usual shortcomings in reliance on church forms and rituals rather than Biblical content (although it is refreshing to find the Carthusians put a heavy emphasis on reading and study of the Biblical Psalms).  The confusion this this troubling obsession with 'church tradition' (as against Biblical Truth) sows is shown beautifully (and sadly) when the monks on one of their weekly walks (one of the few occasions when they can and do converse) discuss the fact that some other monastery has apparently done away with a ritual 'washing' of their hands prior to the meal.  Because they have 'cut loose' their observances from any Biblical standard, they are divided as to whether their ritual of running their fingers under a dribbling tap should be retianed or abolished.  What is saddest is that they have no standard or criteria for making the decision.

For all the Biblical shortcomings of Catholic monastic life, this is a wonderfully moving testimony to the extraordinarily sincere, but ultimately misguided and wasteful, lives of the monastic participants.",1202428800,,1735,4.8805460750853245

German filmmaker Philip Groenig proposed this film to the Order in the eighties, receiving permission to make the film a couple of decades later.  The Order does not move quickly, nor does the movie.  As it draws you in, it slows you down; hearing becomes more acute, vision sharper, and what you see in the faces of these men who for all intents and purposes enter into virtual solitary confinement for love of God, of the Order, and of the world, is peace, joy, contentment.  You may find yourselves living life at a deeper, quieter, more joyful level after viewing this cinematographic meditation.  Just rememeber afterwards that you cannot go retreat at a Charterhouse unless you, and they, are considering the possibility of joining.

2754413,5,B000N3SOSE,"I am not going to write a review of the film but rather comment on how to prepare yourself to perceive it.  That's right-perceive it.  You cannot watch this as entertainment.  Suspend your insatiable thirst for entertainment for 2.5 hours at least and enter a dimension that is not of ""our"" world.  It is not a documentary, it is not action, drama, comedy.  This is a genre-less movie. Oh! and before I forget a Warning-do not eat popcorn while you watch this movie.  Some audience members were chewing popcorn and drinking soda, when I went to see it in a theater.  I simply do not know what to say to that.  Maybe someone out there can give me a reasonable explanation of why people do this.  So, again-NO popcorn.
  My comment is mostly addressed to all the people who watched only 15-20 minutes of the film.  I do not condemn or blame these people.  Our modern forms of entertainment have ruined our consciousness to the point that unless there is action or sex on the screen we won't watch more than 15 minutes of it.  So, if people do not have the patience or spiritual preparedness to watch something like this, it is entirely not their fault.  It takes years of preparation to get to a point where you would watch this film with an open enough mind to either be enthralled by it or if you do not ""get"" it, to just remain ""silent"" and immediately return to your chaos-filled everyday lives-as plain as that.
  Also, by no means should you watch this film for educational purposes.  There are libraries in this country-most of them are free.  I am not going to recommend any sectarian books, but I do suggest reading books on contemplative forms of spiritual life.  Or if people are turned off by spiritual literature, they can read the haikus of the Japanese poet Basho and realize that may be once in their life they should just sit quietly and watch snow fall for 13 minutes.
  Good luck with the movie.",1200355200,16,1912,4.497093023255814
2754414,5,B000N3SOSE,"In 1984 film-maker Philip Groning asked the remote and reclusive Monastery Grand Chartreuse if he could make a documentary of their monastic life. ""It's too soon,"" they said, ""maybe in 10 to 13 years."" In 2001 they called him back and said they were ready. Groning spent six months by himself filming the everyday life of the Carthusian monks (founded in 1084) high in the French Alps. He begins in winter and ends in spring, which makes the stunning scenery reason enough to watch the film. There is no narration or any music in this film, and for the most part no sounds at all except for the echos of daily tasks like pouring a pitcher of water, birds outside the windoow, bells, cutting a piece of cloth with shears, etc. Even the short snippets of the monks chanting the liturgy are exceptions to the silence. This is a life full of paradox--austere yet rich, silent but resonate, simple in the extreme and yet complex, alone in a cell but together in community, useless by the world's standard but meaningful if ever there was meaning. The film is long at 162 minutes, and more of a meditation than a documentary on what monastic life was likely like 900 years ago.",1200182400,10,1171,4.580952380952381

Weighing in at about two and a half hours, it is a quiet and unflinching look at the lives of a group monks living in an isolated monastery tucked into the French Alps.  Modern life rarely intrudes, though occasionally one sees a jet plane in the sky overhead or one of the Brothers using a laptop computer to track bills.  Otherwise, you might be in the 16th century.  Some might consider this ""Into Great Boredom"" or ""The Last Great Inaction Hero.""  Some may stir and view it as akin to watching a feature film of paint drying or grass growing.

That would be a sad mistake, though.

There are no car chases or explosions - just spiritual fireworks from the mundane ebb and flow - a somewhat repetitive ebb and flow - of monastic life.

2754426,5,B000N3SOSE,"This movie perfectly illustrates that there is a deep spiritual space beyond dogma. That is not to say the monks in this film lack structure or are somehow removed from the Catholic faith; it is more that serious spiritual practice is common not only to many faiths but has remained stable over thousands of years. The Dalai Lama recently commented that we were living in a great age of secular as well as religious spirituality and I think this movie responds to that possibility. It certainly offers a way forward for as many secular, agnostic people as for the already religious. It teaches us to slow down, to really focus on what is important, to try to drive deep down inside ourselves and to relate to others in a much deeper way, made possible by not talking for much of the time. Then what we have to say is what is important or what is joyful rather than routine. I wish that many Protestants from those sects who believe that Christianity is about rules could see this to see how rules are really there to be gone beyond and not imposed on everyone else. There is no evangelical drive here either: those who come travel deep. We each have to find our own way, though the monastic structure starts the process.

At a personal level this movie had a profound effect on me and it is on that basis that I give it five stars. Make sure you see it when you have the time to benefit from it. And have time to reflect on it afterwards.

As a film it is remarkable and the images are amazing. Often the director/cameraman manages to frame an image in ways that are almost like abstract art. His compositions are superb and his use of almost amateur film speeds draws our attention to differences in what is being observed. What a relief to have variety of cutting rather than the two second take of so many films, jumping restlessly around. The scenes at night by candle light are especially effective.

The arms length approach to the world has preserved this way of life to the greatest part and Groning's direct access to the monks, complete with appropriate waiting (10 + years) and restrictions (no artificial light, no soundtrack) is remarkable on two fronts. First and foremost that he was able to do the film at all and secondly through his deep sense of stewardship by presenting and accepting the situation ""as is"" vs. adding any theatrical or cinematic props. The slow almost plodding presentation does what is only possible via this approach, that time essentially shifts once entering the charterhouse. The senses are all intensified and the very simple and direct experience of finding who you really are begins. This was not an easy film to make and watching it can be both instructive on the Cathusian order itself as a piece of history but hopefully, and more importantly it can open a small window into who you are and your relationship with God. Watching this nearly 3 hours silent effort in an American theater can be its' own source of entertainment as the bulk of the crowd fidgets and maneuvers to find comfort in the silence and unfamiliar surroundings.

2754430,5,B000N3SOSE,"Those of us who have followed the development of this movie are familiar already with the story of its origin: ""In 1984, German filmmaker Philp Grning wrote to the Carthusian order for permission to make a documentary about the. They said they would get back to him. Sixteen years later, they were ready."" Without crew, artificial lighting or sound - other than the ambient noises of the monastery - and without running commentary, the Carthusians, one of the Church's most austere orders, welcomed Grning into their midst. He filmed their daily prayers, tasks, rituals, rare outdoor excursions against a background of the changing seasons. Supernature, as well as nature, marks the rhythms of life of these very holy and yet intensely human beings who dwell at the Grande Chartreuse.

The result is Into Great Silence.

The film is multifaceted. The fact that it has neither score nor script allowed the filmmaker to witness the natural development of the story unfolding before him. This is a story of prayer, sacrifice and intense joy.

I think that nothing portrays the humanity of these men more than the brief interludes Grning captured of each one of them. Interspersed throughout the movie Grning presents us with the faces of the monks and I firmly believe that, although I don't know and may never know their names, I swear I know them. Their personalities jump at you from the screen. This is possible because their continuous dialogue with God has enabled these monks to drop all masks, all pretenses, their very hearts coming to us through their eyes and their beings through their countenances.

Into Great Silence is somewhat of a misnomer. For we hear the monks pray together, talk, and even play. We hear the animals calling, the sound of the wind over the mountains, the drops of water from melting snow, of a fork against a dish, and of human laughter. We also hear the words of the blind monk sharing his joy for the gift of sightlessness. We hear the prayers the Prior pronounced over the two prostrated novices at Chapter. We hear the ""yes"" they give to the Lord and his Church to lose themselves forever behind those holy walls, and we see and hear the loving embrace with which each member of the community welcomes the new brothers. We hear the sound of their hair being cut. We hear the food cart trampling down the ancient hallways. We hear the ""click click"" that the hands of the Prior makes as he types in his IBM notebook computer.

There's a lesson in all this, for it is not the lack of sounds that make this place a holy place, but the ""quality"" of the silence and what it's said and heard in it.

If you're looking for an action-packed film crawling with murderous albino monks intent on protecting the secrets of the Church, this movie is not for you. In fact, it may put you to sleep. But if you are a seeker of the Face of God and the Spirit is impelling you to deepen your communion with the Lord, whether as a lay person or even as a member of this holy group of burnt men, you will find yourself one step closer to his Mystery.",1195689600,11,3067,4.5978062157221204

I think the director appreciates still images, artful black and white photos, and the way that an object can be more impressionable when it is enlarged and surrounded by a black matte. My television screen is not very large, and I feel this had an effect on the impact of the film. Also, anyone that has to deal with distractions in their viewing environment will not reap the benefit that someone in a relatively quiet, relatively distraction-free atmosphere will. I live in a high traffic area and the noise from outside was distracting during this movie about silence. One could, in this case cover their ears I guess, but there are some conversations, singing, etc. that are part of this film, and should be heard. As silly as this may sound, I think this film may be good to watch when one is ill with the flu or whatever, and feeling less than energetic, and perhaps staying home from work, and alone. I couldn't help myself from pausing the film to do something else occasionally. I think the viewing experience in this film in sort of interactive.

2754435,5,B000N3SOSE,"An edited transcription from a public email discussion of ""Into Great Silence"" indicates that this film is a winner: director Philip Groening's study of the Grande Chartreuse monastery. This is the opening email, written by Father R. and talks about the main character of the movie. Keep in mind that the film is silent, with subtitles, and that it took more than ten years for the filmmaker to receive permission to film the inner life of the monastery. Father R. writes in his message:

""Fr. Laurence Freeman...made a fascinating point, that the major character of the whole is the mysterious God, there everywhere: in the monks, in the hallways and the church, out in the fields. And the implication is that God should be the main character in our lives, in our hallways and church and fields.""

The life of a monk is one dedicated to God. ""Into Great Silence"" documents the events in the life of monks who live in a Carthusian monastery in France. The DVD I own has two disks, with the second disk containing a statement by a French Cardinal, (that is an added attraction and certainly worth the price of admission). There are other interesting commentaries on the second disk. Regarding the film, which is on the first disk, I found this a powerful film.

In response to Father R., I wrote in my public email:

""Dear Father R.
I like what you say about the film, for it is so apparent and yet not noticed as you've said: The mysterious God. That's part of the mystery. Thanks for the surprising observation.

The photography (cinematography) is excellent, so artistic and spare, adding to the silence and simplicity. The director captures the pace of life in the monastery effectively. It helps in viewing the film. Many fine shots, like stills. This is a good documentary, and a work of art.

I received my 2 CD set as a birthday gift, bought from Amazon.com. The experience of watching the film helps me to fill out the sense of community and relationship between monks and with God. I'm lucky to be reading Aquinata Bockmann, ""Expanding Our Hearts in Christ, Perspectives on the Rule of Saint Benedict."" Film is a powerful help to the imagination, and this film brings out
a sense of lives committed to Christ. For not only is that a message in this film, it is also a message of Sister Bockmann's book.""

There are many special moments in this film: the changing of the seasons, the rhythm of daily life through the seasons, and even the faces of the monks looking into the camera. This series of portraits is in itself interesting. During the email discussion, Anne wrote of her delight and interest in seeing the faces of the monks:

In response to the power the film held for this religious woman, Anne a viewer of the film, she said:

""What they seemed to be saying to me was -- We have found it: the thing everyone in the world looks for, the deepest longing of every human heart: we have discovered it. Their faces radiate a celestial joy and a peace from beyond themselves. Something in my soul reached back out to them in longing and recognition and love. It's a moment that makes your heart whisper a long 'yes.'""

She saw in the film men fulfilling their lives. This is a positive film, filled with a kind of awe. The awe is in the life of these monks, as how they live and what they do in their prayers and dedication. It is in their peace, and their connectedness to the Almighty.

For the individual or group interested in religious subjects, wanting to learn more about life in a monastery, or what it is to dedicate one's life to Christ, this film is an excellent choice. For film buffs interested in an artistic and visually beautiful film, this is an excellent choice. For seekers of God who wish to see what a group of people are like who make God primary in their lives, this choice of film is helpful and edifying. In fact, in its form, style, and method, this is an edifying film.

2754436,5,B000N3SOSE,"I must warn you in advance, `Into Great Silence' is not everyone's movie.  Exquisitely shot and presented, this documentary film, very deliberately shows the rhythm and repetition of life of the monks at The Monastery of the Grande Chartreuse.  At the movie's end there are two revelations worth sharing: Filmmaker Philip Grning asked to film the community back in 1984, but had to wait sixteen years to have his wish fulfilled.  Much of the monks' lives are that deliberate as well.  The other should be of no surprise, the Carthusian community is among the most ""ascetic"" (austere, ""strict on self-discipline"") monasteries in the world.

Although slow in presentation, gorgeous shots of illuminating sunlight and expansive horizons in the French Alps are worth a look.  Time-lapsed cinematography garnishes the change of seasons that mark the seasonal sojourn the film captures.  Long, shining shots frame key monks as each tries to look unflinchingly into the camera.  The sunlight embellishes the subject matter for a halo effect, mirroring the inner light of every man.  Key players include a blind, elderly monk, a gardener, the cook, and two candidates to their order:  Etienne, whose writing reveals he is Spanish, and Benjamin who is an migr from some African country--speaking with an African dialect mixed with French.

Besides great beauty, the movie conveys the life of its focus.  We not only see their life, we live it as well.  It is like we are with them.  We enter into the chapel for prayer or into the church for chant and into their ordinary routine of work, meals, and prayer in each monk's private cell.  The music, nature, and sounds of their work play a song on our own hearts as well.  Scripture is repeated throughout the documentary and translated into English and German with subtitles displayed on the screen.  Some may find this a procedural flaw, but the repetition gives us a first hand experience.  It is difficult to watch this film without experiencing some sort of transcendence.

Some of the special moments in their itinerary are special for us as well.  When they eat together in the refectory (roughly dining room), recreate in the snow, and have one of those rare moments when they are able to talk together, their silence is framed by its opposite.

Ironically, the movie has a great deal of sound.  Just as the camera makes the movie a document of great beauty, the microphone hears many movements.  Using good judgment in subject and volume, the film lets us hear the sounds of nature:  water, birds, and wind.  We also get the movement of the men:  rustling habits, men eating, kneeling, and working.

Clocking in at 2:40, people could quibble either way about the timing:  It is too time-lapsed or too much, but I believe it is nearly perfect.  This wonderful film is one I'd love to own; one that is meant to experience again and again.",1194566400,26,2884,4.864476386036961
2754437,5,B000N3SOSE,"[Saw the film in a movie theater, so the experience of watching this at home on DVD would be markedly different, but here goes anyway.]

There's little I can add to the rapturous reviews of Philip Grning's Into Great Silence--an almost three-hour documentary on a Carthusian monastery in France and its monks who have taken a vow to live their lives as silently as possible. It's not nearly as forbidding as it sounds, even if there is no voiceover narration, or hardly any subtitles--there is no need for them for the most part--or no artificial light. (Some of the most beautiful passages in the film are set at Vespers, sometimes lit only by a lone candle.)

The monks do speak, for starters, and the part Grning chooses to show is their rather funny quibbling about certain rituals. But immediately, at the beginning of the film, the audience is already drawn into contemplation: we watch a monk, barely discernible in the dim light, kneeling in prayer, for about half a minute; he stands, adjusts the heater in his bare room, and kneels again.

The theme of the eternal present is movingly raised by an elderly blind monk, testifying joyfully about his blindness and his peaceful embrace of his mortality. There are no distinctions between past or present with God, the monk says; only the present prevails, and when He sees us, he always sees our entire life. In contrast, the ineluctable passage of time is seen outside the monastery: seasons follow one another, the snows end and the blooms appear. (Grning also presents the monks not as timeless, ahistorical figures: one monk puzzles over bills on an IBM Thinkpad, another practices his singing on a small keyboard, airplanes fly overhead.)

The cinematography, both intimate and grand, is something else: some high-definition video shots echo the Old Masters in their composition; we see, in painstaking detail, new leaves peeking through still-frosted stems, or the slow drop of water from a bucket. (Indeed, the swarming motes in the grainy Super-8 footage--sometimes, of nothing but blue sky or gray cloud--suggest a perpetual movement in what is ostensibly still.) Grning also gets a lot of mileage from close-ups of shaved heads, the camera peering over monks' shoulders as they read or pray, inviting the audience to imagine the secrets inside their skulls, to wonder about what inspires such devotion.

Viewers will come away with different things. For me it was the effortless way in which the deeply ordinary was invested with a deep, spiritual gravity; they shovel snow, feed cats, saw wood, sing, and kneel in prayer, and somehow the divine is felt as a trace, lingering in all their labors. There is a scene, for instance, in which a monk repairs a shoe, and his simple act of blowing on the glue to dry it becomes, in the world of Into Great Silence, the seeming exhalation of a prayer. The less generous will wonder about the political implications of a retreat from all the sorrows of the world. But many will surely remark upon the temporary transformation of the movie theater into an extension of the monastery; indeed, the hush follows you outside into the night as you leave.",1194393600,13,3156,4.891588785046729
2754438,4,B000N3SOSE,"The director is trying to use the medium of film to convey a metaphysical understanding of life. Not Easy. He uses various techniques to hopefully focus the viewer's attention on underlying truths. The problem here is the viewer must already be spiritually sensitive to pick up on this. Otherwise, the movie just seems slow, uneventful, and lacking. The slow pace of the movie, its rhythms, and the time consuming shots of individual scenes and items, I think, are meant to make us ponder the fact that there is a Creator and a Sustainer in all things. We are invited to look deeper into the mundane and the obvious. The director wants us to experience the devine essence in all that we are seeing. The purpose of the monks lives is to become increasingly aware of God's presence all around and within them. The goal, if you like, is to walk with God in their daily lives whether they are working in the kitchen or are in prayer. I should think that becoming this aware of God's presence in one's daily life would be ecstatic at times. The monk's sense of self must diminish as his awareness of God's presence increases. These monks humble me. For the right person this is a very beautiful and moving movie. Thank you Phillip Groning for making this work of spiritual art.",1193529600,15,1272,4.607929515418502

2754442,4,B000N3SOSE,"The last year or so has seen a virtual revolution in our understanding of the human aspect of Carthusian life. First there was the revealing study of several former Carthusian monks by Nancy McGuire, An Infinity of Mirrors, and now the documentary Into Great Silence. The reversal of Carthusian anonymity might be well symbolized by the haunting close-ups of the faces of Carthusian monks in the film. Previously, all that one would ever see of Carthusians in pictures was their backs. Even then, their cowls were raised to conceal any suggestion of individuality.
There is, nonetheless, in this revealing film,  a fundamental flaw that leaves the Carthusians as mysterious (and perhaps open to misunderstanding) as they have ever been. The film is essentially a work of art, a sensitive rendering of a beautiful monastic environment. Yet anyone who approaches the Carthusian experience as essentially aesthetic is missing the point: and this error is likely the reason why so many attempt this vocation and soon depart (the retention rate holds steady at about 10% of all who enter). It is a life of unending sameness, intentionally tedious in its repetition, forcing the Carthusian to slowly minimize his submersion in the physical world with  its seductions and beauties. It is certainly true that one paradoxical  consequence of such routine is intense attention to physical details: the beautiful setting, the subtle nuances of the liturgy, the fly returning to a dinner pear. But in this film, such physical details seem to form the core of the life. In reality such attention to the beautiful small details of natural life soon becomes tedious (both for the Carthusian and the viewer of the film); and the monk must move beyond images to the spiritual core of the vocation: the imageless contemplation of God.
The film does attempt to suggest this core in the repeated images of monks engaged in meditative prayer. But watching someone meditate is a far cry from the experience itself. The latter is endlessly eventful and increasingly profound. The observation of it is unbearably tedious. I give the filmmaker credit for attempting to  represent the Imageless,but the images of film are, finally,  the antithesis of contemplation. Restless Americans seem to have particular difficulty with such  uneventful living. Witness the change from of the original  German title: ""Die grosse Stille"" to the English ""Into Great Silence"", the latter promising us action and movement rather than just Being, to put it  philosophically.
On the other hand, in its attempt to present the Unchanging, the film is excessively silent. Although its structure suggests the flow of Carthusian days and seasons, the lack of explication leaves an uninitiated viewer with  little understanding of the intentional balancing of this essentially  eremitic life with community living: the alternation between solitary liturgical prayer and the  choir liturgy is suggested, but not explained. The conversation for maintaining human relations in an otherwise intensely solitary life, is recorded here, the talk both  erudite and amusing, another little known characteristic of Carthusian life. But its weekly occurance is not pointed out. The sleeping arrangements, the daily interruption of sleep at midnight for the night office, and the rigorous fasts (bread and water at least once a week) are significant elements of the life that are not featured here.
As other reviewers have noted,  with one dramatic exception, the monks do not speak about their lives. I suspect that since Carthusians Have left ""the world"" this was a condition of filming. At first, I did not appreciate this, but on reflecting, their silence conveys the core of this life more powerfully  than  interviews which would likely  have been mundane and pietistic. The Carthusian life, as the film makes clear, leaves speech far behind.
So, for a number of reasons, I was unhappy with the film. On the other hand, many weeks later, the images of these silent white figures in their echoing cloisters keep coming back at odd moments during my busy days in the world...theologically that is one purpose of this mysterious life.",1186617600,55,4175,5.199701937406855

The first hour may be excruciating, as you wait for something to happen, but as you relax into the quiet and feel the presence of God in the faces of the monks, you will get a taste of why people live in this way.

2754445,5,B000N3SOSE,"The movie is an unique experience. I'm glad I saw it in a small theater. I'm not sure how it would play at home on a DVD. The movie is slow and meditative. Any distraction would tend to remove one from the experience. In the theater, people eating their popcorn, shuffling their feet, or even moving around, were major distractions. The audience wasn't intentionally rude, but the meditative silence of the movie pulls one into the movie and other sounds bring you back into reality.

It doesn't really cover the lives of the monks, but rather gives glimpses into certain aspects of their lives. You have a far better idea of the rhythm of their lives, but not really a better idea of how they live or why they live that way. I see the attraction of the focused lifestyle, but year after year. Wow. The movie is hard to describe. The movie consists of a collection of different snapshots of the lives of the monks, I think using the rhythm of the prayer times and the seasons to pull the snapshots all together. There isn't a narrative thread. The director interviews a blind monk at the end and that does help to put into perspective the lives of the monks. They are pursuing happiness in God through disciplining their lives in silence and solitude. A good scene is the monks horsing around in the snow. Another good scene is the good-hearted debate about the hand washing. The scenes made them more human, more accessible to me.

I'm not sure if I can recommend the movie. I don't know if I would call it a enjoyable experience. I'm glad I watched it and it is a movie I'll remember. However, it is a very beautiful, very long, and very slow movie. Only a few, motivated people would like the movie.

2754446,3,B000N3SOSE,"This film shows with some success how the worldly-abnegation of the Carthusians results in an ability to meditate beyond the common place of everyday prayer.  One could argue a film need not do more than that to say something important. I did feel the sense of absence in these people's lives, and their discipline as means to suspend their humanity in a kind of holy iteration of metaphysical intuition - well beyond piety.  I felt also however that this way of life as practised by Carthusians, would come across regardless of how they were depicted.  Unfortunately you have to make a film which is equal to them in order for their experience to be shown as equal to itself.  Groning can't do it.  He resorts to simplistic, even sometimes banal, filmic techniques to try to give a sense of what these people are about and how they live.  The fuzzy cam-corder scenes are particularly studenty and annoying.",1185235200,11,907,4.745222929936306
2754447,5,B000N3SOSE,"I probably experienced this film differently than others because I already had a great interest in the Carthusians and have read quite a bit about them. In a way this was a disadvantage because I was so fascinated to see things I'd read about, that something of the ""contemplative"" character of the movie was wasted on me. It depends on the alienness and mysteriousness of the Carthusian life, which in a sense you are not really supposed to figure out much about! I will watch it again though and this time just to experience it.

A friend and I watched this in our church's social area and when one of our priests (a elderly Italian religious) walked by and I told him what we were watching he said that he had visited the Carthusians once when he was a young priest, and that although he greatly admired them, he could never live their lifestyle, he would go crazy in under a month! If you read the recent book ""An Infinity of Little Hours"" you will learn that some would-be Carthusians don't take nearly that long to realize this isn't for them! So one of the most surprising scenes to me was that of a postulant being escorted by singing monks into his new hermitage, which had been lovingly decorated with many little candles. The more you realize what an intense moment this can be, the more you will be affected by how extremely tender and fraternal the scene is. There is more ""plot"" and happenings in the film than first meets the eye, but it is rightfully obscured relative to the sense of the unceasing rhythm of the monastery life, again part of the film's fascination is its mysteriousness and the difficulty of interpreting what you are seeing, without any explanation. The film attempts to communicate a life of profound prayer which the appropriately-disposed viewer may experience some of the savor of.

There are some luminous glimpses of divine strength and beauty inhabiting human weakness, in men who have in some way BECOME prayer--the blind elderly monk who is briefly interviewed at the end enthralled me. He is like St. John of the Cross' metaphor of the clean window which is able to be made bright by sunlight. Very beautiful.

There's never been a film of life in a Carthusian monastery, and may never be again, and ""Into Great Silence"" has too many merits for this viewer to find any fault.",1184198400,53,2320,4.639902676399027

Based on the film, I couldn't help wondering how the Monks supported themselves . . . there were stickers on some of the vegetables, so it was obvious some things come from outside.  I have since learned that the Monastary is the sole producer of the Chartreuse Liqueur, and has been since early in the 17th century.  It would be interesting to see what the involvement of the Monks was in the production of the spirits.  The world wide distribution of the green, yellow or VEP versions of the elixir must provide a reasonable portion of the resources necessary to maintain the monastary.  I also wonder if the monastary just produces the cordial, or if the Monks also are entitled to consume some on at least special occassions.

Excellent film, thought provoking and extremely spiritual.",1184112000,13,831,4.776223776223776
2754449,4,B000N3SOSE,"Filmmaker Philip Groning spent six months living among the monks of the Grand Chartreuse Charterhouse in the French Alps for his documentary ""Into Great Silence.""

I went into the film with a strong curiosity about the life of the Carthusian monks and was treated to an up-close-and-personal look at their lives across four seasons spanning a one year cycle.

I am told the film-maker was only allowed to bring himself - which meant he was The Director, The Cinematographer, The Lighting Technician and The Editor. To make it even harder, there was no lighting allowed inside the monasteries and the filmmaker was at no time to cause any disruption to the ritualistic cycle of the monks daily life. You will notice extremely ""grainy"" (ie low resolution) sequences in some that were filmd in portions of the monastery with little natural light.

Certainly a film best watched on screen (than on DVD) if you wish to feel the walls of the monastry and smell the cold air outside in the courtyard where a near 70-year old semi-blind monk chops wood to stock up for winter.

For those keenly aware that they came to watch a documentary film(not a staged re-creation) that waited 16 years before filming was approved, and the fact that the filming itself was carried out in extremely difficult technical circumstances, this will be a rewarding experience. Philip Groening appears to have attempted to use all available footage to tell the whole story, and unfortunately stretched the film duration beyond 3 hours - a litle too long to sit patiently and watch. Did I mention the monks have a vow of silence inside the monastery the whole year, except for a few days?. The silence on the screen is interrupted only by sounds of footfalls, chopping or sawing of wood, and sometimes you will even find yourself enjoying the mere sound of utensils being washed for the next meal, a relief from the deafening silence. There are ofcourse several scenes of chanting in the chapel, something he monks do every few hours day and night, which meant they slept barely a few hours at a time before they woke up and went about their assigned routines.

The overall feel of the creates a strongly claustrophobic feeling if you find yourself getting absorbed into the film. A scene showing the process of acceptance of new monks into the Order almost made me feel first hand the massive sacrifice and commitment two youngsters going through the acceptance ritual, were about to make.

All in all, this film was a unique documentary filmed in the most unusual circumstances and certainly a must-see if only to peek into the lives of a set of people who have voluntarily given up everything that defines life for us, and happily living that existence almost from early life till death. These are extraordinary men living an extraordinarily disciplined lives in dedication to their Order.",1183248000,23,2863,4.85655737704918

Initially, I was somewhat reluctant to go to the cinema and watch this movie.  However, I accompanied a lady-friend and for close to 3 hours, we sat mesmerised by the tale that unfolded before us.

We both thought that the movie could have been cut in parts - the slightly out of focus snow falling at nightime seemed pointless; the repeated verses from the bible.  For example, the quotes from ""The book of Kings"" were fine the first time around, but after the 3rd (?) time, it became too repetitious and unnecessary.

Another (minor) criticism of the movie is that there are some moments where the film is very grainy.  I can only guess that this was due to lack of sufficient lighting, but surely the director could have either obtained a camera that would film low-light without the high grain or, change the f-stop on the lens, to allow more light.

The chance to view life inside a cloistered environment is a rare opportunity and I for one, congratulate both the Abbot of the monastery and the director for deciding that this was a story to be shared with the world.

Finally, watching the men play in the snow was unexpected and showed that they were not only monks but that they also had a human side.  It also showed that they were able to enjoy some activities outside of the monastery, which had no religious overtones.",1180742400,18,1407,4.596

I wished to be back in the film's ambience of the sacred.

It helps to have a sense of the sacred to appreciate this film.  If you are looking for action, even if it's only the monks' ""inner"" struggle, pick another movie.  This one is about success on the spiritual path not failure, and measure of success in the monastery is different from that in the world.

Some want to know what these men are thinking.  Perhaps they are thinking about God, and their thoughts of God need not be complex to be profound, for the simple utterance of His name can contain all other prayers.

Years ago I spent a year and a half in an American Zen Monestary, watching this movie made me want to sell my house and go back to the quiet and timelessness of a meditative life.  Other reviewers have complained that this movie is boring or should have contained more interviews with monks, more action.  However I think that the movie is perfect the way it is.  Meditative life is a direct experience deep quiet. Talking about it isn't the experience.  Sitting in a movie theater in silence watching dust motes float in a beam of light allows us to have a little taste of the experience.

2754457,2,B000N3SOSE,"I've been anxiously awaiting the arrival of this film in my area for months. When it finally got here I couldn't get to the theater fast enough. As a long time fan of the Carthusian Order and after years of reading any book I could find about them, the idea of getting an inside look at their lives on film was akin to winning the lottery as far as I was concerned. The result after viewing the film twice is the following...

Their is a note at the end of the film that it took something along the lines of thirteen years to get permission from the Order to film the project. With that much of a wait, I would like to believe that Groning could have come up with better ideas as to how to take advantage of the unprecedented opportunity he was given.

Minus one segment, their is no interaction with the monks at all in the form of spoken word/interviews. No listening to what they have to say about the life, their struggles, their joys. Instead the viewer is made to sit through tedious shots of water dripping off of eating bowls and random stills of furniture.

The film is entirely too long. If the useless artistic shots were taken out at least the film would be digestible instead of being as one reviewer has already stated, ""a cure for insomnia"".

Their were a few bright spots. The footage of the monks playing in the snow was brilliant. Again, more of this kind of candid footage would have made the film much better. Also, the scene involving feeding the local cats was tops on my list. These types of scenes show the Carthusian in a light that is refreshing and if anything makes any of us regardless of our religious affiliations, respect their vocations more.

It's my hope that the DVD will have more interview footage and if anything else, the nearly three hour yawn-fest can be broken up in segments to make it more watchable. The Carthusians are an amazing Order with a charism that is unlike any other in the world and in many ways in history. This film hardly captures any of that.",1180051200,14,2003,4.417344173441735

I have seen this film reviewed as being not unlike a computer monitor screensaver slidewhow. It is much more than that, but that gives you a general idea.

  Having been in a couple of Benedictine Monastaries myself, I can assure you that those places feel like Country Clubs compared to the setting of the Carthusian Order. I came away with a profound respect for these men who have elected to live their life in prayer and devotion to Our Lord.

  This would be of interest to those who want to know more about those men who have chosen the utmost in devotion to Christ...and in turn, it can possibly lead people to examine the fact that in spite of the pace of their lives, there really is time to pray each and every day.",1179532800,18,1036,4.260204081632653
2754459,1,B000N3SOSE,"An endurance test for the ages, that is how best to describe ""Into Great Silence."" Or better yet, the greatest prank ever played on film snobs. Director Philip Groning, minus his crew and any artificial light, wanders around this monastery capturing the comings and goings of the monks within. They eat, they walk, they prey, they repeat. It is the kind of film that makes you realize just how exciting your life actually is. I know for a fact that if you were to set a camera up at my work for a few weeks it could easily be edited down into something far better than this which manages to bore the buttocks off of the proverbial bronze statue.

I went to see this film primarily because of the positive reviews, especially that one handed out by Manohla Dargis. But Dargis, love her as I do, does have a knack for picking things that move like thick molasses. This, ""Three Times"", ""Last Days"", the list goes on and on. Perhaps the critical response is due, in part, to the motion for motions sake duds that Hollywood churns out, and I would be the last person to blame them for that. But this cannot be the antidote, I was going bonkers by the time the 164 minutes finally came to a close. And I wasn't the only one, with nothing happening on screen the audience was left to provide the high drama. The guy in front of me kept dozing off only to be woken up by his father. A coughing fit in the back caused a scandal (Why I don't know as there was no dialogue to hear). One woman started snoring. The best comparison I can come up with for this film would be ""The Story of the Weeping Camel"" in which people who have never had a movie made about them show us exactly why they have never had a movie made about them. I assume Groning is trying to sell access to an unknown world and based on its box office performance thus far it seems as though people are taking the bait. But the fact that he waited 16 years to have this movie made does make me wonder what he was envisioning in the first place.

There are a few perks to watching this film. All of the shots are 100% natural, so those that hold great beauty, like the light entering the monastery, are very impressive. I would also say that making your movie your way, no matter what, is always a virtue. . .perhaps the single most important virtue in the world of cinema. Yes, his back is to the audience, big time, but quite obviously he doesn't care. Anybody can sit down, watch ""Sherrybaby"" and declare a general hatred of smack, but rarely does a movie turn you off to a religious lifestyle. Living this life would push me well past the brink, and it has nothing to do with my atheism. These people may looooove it nice and slow but that is not my style. For all the problems of modern life (inconsiderate cell phone guy, global climate change) there is nothing appealing about the opposite. The only thing I was inspired to pray for was the end credits. There is not an ounce of entertainment value to be found here and if you don't believe me ask the guy in front of me. Oh wait, he left half way through. *1/4",1179100800,32,3073,4.287435456110155
2754460,4,B000N3SOSE,"I saw this film in the Independent Film Forum in NYC's Greenwich Village, and ended up having a two hour discussion about it afterwards.  The main thing that shocked me about this film was how happy all of these monks are.  If anyone would tell the average modern American to have every hour of the rest of your life neatly regimented into time segments, without time for television, vacations, or intimacy with members of the opposite sex, most Americans would thing of that as being excruciatingly difficult.  However, when looking at the daily activities of these men, you ""get it"".  Because of the regimentation of their daily tasks, when they do get a few hours on Sunday to talk, those hours are beautiful and meaningful.  Their lives seem like the way life was supposed meant to be, one of hard work and communion with the Creator.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a film that will slow their mental pace down and make them reflect on the importance of the various things you value in your own life.",1178409600,208,1026,4.640883977900552
2754461,4,B000N3SOSE,"""Into the Great Silence"" is a German film about French monks who pray in Latin. The monastery of the Grande Chartreuse in the French Alps houses a community of monks of the Carthusian order that has been praying in nearly-total silence and solitude for nearly a millennium. It took the filmmakers over a decade to obtain permission to film at the monastery, but the results are lovely. The monks live in an isolated Bavarian-style villa high in the mountains and hew to an austere daily regimen. They rise well before dawn to pray -- alone in their cells -- for hours. They occasionally gather to chant the liturgy of the hours. They retreat to their cells, where they take meals, bathe and study in solitude and silence. The film follows the monks through their day and over the course of a year, from the deep snows of winter, through the planting season, and around again to winter.

The film is long, it must be said. It features long, lingering shots of the monks at prayer -- favoring closeup shots of an ear, fingers, lips and eyes. But visually, the film is breathtaking. The interior of the monks' cells is spare, with plain wood furnishings and gray, stone walls. The diffuse lighting is almost entirely natural. Many of the shots achieve a Flemish painter's level of natural beauty and homeliness, with parts of the shot plunging into darkness. The camera lingers lovingly on small elements of the monkish life: a candle flame that hovers almost disembodied near the tabernacle in a near-dark chapel during middle-of-the-night prayer; a view of a snow-laden roof seen through a monk's window. The potential monotony of this approach is broken up using a number of techniques. Monks are caught as they make small movements -- adjusting the flue in a wood stove, eating from a tin of soup, scrubbing a plate, learning a new chant. Communal moments are shown as well -- the monks getting haircuts, filling pitchers of water, walking to chapel. The camera also focuses on the small things of nature -- a leaf, a rushing spring, water dripping from a drying dish, a patch of sky -- permitting us to study the beauty and simplicity of the small elements of the creation that surrounds us. In all of these ways, viewers find themselves drawn into the monks' silent world of prayer.

There are drawbacks and debatable choices. The filmmakers interspersed standard film stock with scenes made by (or in imitation of) the shaky home movie stock of the 1960s. Perhaps this was done in an attempt to provide a sense of the community's longevity. But the technique came just ""this close"" to being the a precious, film-school distraction. Though the Gregorian neums and script in the wonderfully over-sized chant books are an object of the filmmakers' attention, the contents of those beautiful words is never apparent. Those who have chanted the Divine Office during a retreat may know what is going on (the chanting of all 150 psalms over the course of a few weeks), but others will not. Too, there is a focus on the seasons of the year, but not on the seasons of the Church -- Advent, Christmas, Lent and Easter -- which are enormously more significant to the monks. Then again, with a single unfortunate exception, one does not know much about the contents of or the motivation for the monks' prayer. What do they spend so much time doing -- meditating on the Passion? Scripture study? Self-analysis and reflection? By the same token, this lack of information brings viewers into contact with their own inner monologue -- ""what are they doing now?"" ""How long will this movie last?"" ""How is the film structured?"" These reflections, born of the silence of the movie theater, may precisely map to the inner lives of the men the film portrays. A more pressing issue is with the biblical texts that are occasionally (and with deliberate repetition) displayed on the screen. One verse, from Jeremiah, was horribly mistranslated from the French. The French read, ""You seduced me, and I *allowed myself to be* seduced."" The translation read, ""You seduced me, and I was seduced,"" not entirely the same thing. Missing from both was the context of the verse, in which the prophet Jeremiah accuses God of luring him into prophetic career that caused him to be mocked and derided -- a far cry from the gentle feeling these words evoke when divorced from their biblical context. And one more problem: the one monk who spoke about his inner life was an elderly, blind man whose gentle piety was a vapid as his sight was blunted. One can only hope that others had an interior life that was less pollyannaish.

""Into Great Silence"" is a challenging film on many levels. It is not easy to spend three hours watching others pray. But in the end, it succeeds in bringing the interior life of the monastery to a cinematic audience. Whatever flaws it suffers are subsumed to that larger and more worthy achievement -- the devotion of one's entire life to the worship of God.",1178323200,29,4953,4.756976744186047
2754462,4,B000N3SOSE,"Into Great Silence was quite the film. When I first saw the trailer for this film, I thought it looked fascinating. Then, I heard it was a near 3-hour film about monks and almost entirely silent. Needless to say, I felt reserved. Even as a spiritual person I didn't know if I could find myself captivated for that long with that type of a movie. I was wrong. The near 3-hour run time felt more like an average 2-hour film, even with its slow pace and silence. This film was beautiful in two different ways. First of all, many of the shots were fantastic. Groning used natural lighting and found ways to capture many darkly lit scenes in ways that were incredible. Also, his edited shot selection was great. The biggest visual downfall were the many grainy shots. I was disappointed with those and found myself wishing the entire film was shot with a clear lens. Regardless, that was not enough keep me from enjoying this film.

The second beautiful aspect of this film was its spirituality. Knowing that these men have willingly chosen this path for their lives and seeing their passion (although in a very relaxed and focused way) unfold on-screen was powerful. It's a life I know I could never lead, but I have respect for those who can. I can not honestly recommend this movie to everyone. I think it will take a certain kind of film fan to enjoy this movie. Keep in mind that it's a slow-paced, very quiet film before seeing it. But also note that the visuals and spiritual aspects are well worth watching. This is my favorite film of 2007 thus far.",1178150400,38,1553,4.526690391459074
2754463,5,B000N3SOSE,"The lives viewed externally by the cameras are unremarkable; the drama only hinted at in the film is entirely interior for the Carthusian monks, who devote themselves to a lifetime of asceticism, prayer and a modicum of physical labor, cutting wood or tending their tiny gardens. (The heavy lifting is done by brothers and--probably--hired help.)

The remarkable insight for me was the sheer masculinity of the monks. There are no weak men on display. How could there be, with the commitment made to constant prayer and the strength required to fulfill the commitment? (There has to be a lot of wise spiritual guidance available within the cloister to make things work.)

A second insight was the absence of formal intellectuality. It appears a Carthusian monk need not go to college, and therefore is spared the meanderings of Hans Urs von Balthasar, etc.

I enjoyed the not-so-subtle dig at the Trappists during the one Sunday afternoon conversation that was allowed to be filmed. IMHO, the monk's remark was well-founded, because the 20th-century model of the Trappists seems largely engaged in impressing the world, whereas the Carthusians could care less what the world thinks.

Finally, I'm glad the filmakers were proscribed from filming during any of the liturgical feast days, seemingly being limited to filming only spring-summer-fall regular days at the Charterhouse. I guarantee you the cameras won't be back, ever--you can tell that from the monks' portraits interspersed throughout the film.",1177200000,27,1505,5.258333333333334

8174393,5,B000N3SOSE,"If you appreciate quiet, contemplation, and simple cinematography, you will enjoy this documentary.

Unlike other documentaries, however, Into Great Silence pulls off the seemingly impossible--no narrator, no annoying musical scores, no canned script. You understand the simplicity of the Carthusian Order by the simplicity of the video. The effect is deeply moving and unhurried. The amazing part about this documentary (2 hours and 42 minutes) is that you see the final credits and think, wow, it's over already?

Powerful. Nice cinematography. Excellent bonus DVD (with about two more hours of material). Nicely done.

NOTE: If you order this work, pop it in the DVD, and start playing, the initial scenes use a grainy looking camera effect. This is not a defective DVD. Most of the movie is in high resolution.",1521676800,,814,5.246153846153846
