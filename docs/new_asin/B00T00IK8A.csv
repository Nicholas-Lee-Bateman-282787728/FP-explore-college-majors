6998654,3,B00T00IK8A,"Three stars is honestly two more than it deserves but because of Roddy I had to go that high. His performance is the only thing that makes this even remotely tolerable. I'm sure it was the usual ""shot on a shoe string budget in a day or two"" production. It meets that description in excess. I've loved Roddy since They Live, this isn't even close but he stayed true to character the entire movie. If you have time to waste and you watch it for free, fast forward to the scenes he's in and you'll probably like it. The plot (as it is) isn't much so you won't miss anything worthwhile. Bad guys brother dies in the ring with Shane Douglas after Shane catches him and his girl making out. Revenge plot from there with zombie addition as they are created to do bad guys dirty work to try and kill Shane and friends. Rest in Peace Roddy, you deserved much better scripts.",1441324800,5,866,4.319018404907975

6998658,1,B00T00IK8A,"There's absolutely nothing positive to say about this poor excuse for a movie. I was hoping it would be a campy, fun flick, but no chance. No one, not even the Rowdy One, could act their way out of a paper bag. The ""plot"" revolves around Shane ""The Franchise"" Douglas killing another wrestler with a pile-driver. Billy's (the victim) brother is some kind of demonic character who is able to turn a nurse into a zombie by removing her heart and eating it. In a short period of time, he comes up with an army of the undead. Roddy, The Franchise (he makes it clear any number of times that's who he is), Hacksaw Duggan, Matt Hardy (or Jeff) and some unknown stiffs show up at some venue where an event is to take place. Here's the catch, if you are in the ring, no zombie can get to you, unless you are Kurt Angle. At that point I was unable to watch any longer. The script must have been written by a kid in junior high or a room full of monkeys. I may attempt to finish this poor excuse for a film, but it will take some time and therapy to do so. Actually, NO STARS, but you are forced to assign at least one.",1468713600,,1109,4.11520737327189

6998667,1,B00T00IK8A,"Listen, I honestly don't know why you're reading a review for a movie called ""Pro Wrestlers Vs. Zombies.""  You already know that it isn't very good, at least from a critical perspective.  The real question about a movie like this is whether it's any fun.  And really, the answer to that is based on how much enjoyment you're going to get out of seeing wrestlers outside their normal environment.

Rowdy Roddy Piper (RIP) is great here.  He actually has some understated moments (which... that's not much on display here, so you'll appreciate his restraint), and he has one of the best moments in the film, on the bus before the wrestlers arrive at the abandoned prison where much of the action takes place.  Hacksaw Jim Duggan was also able to inject a bit of pathos into his role... who knew?  But the other roles are either underwritten or overwritten.  The Franchise Shane Douglas actually plays an interesting role that's a shade of grey -- he's not really a good guy or a bad guy.  Unfortunately, he's saddled with a little too much of a backstory.  It's a zombie film.  I'm not going to get emotional about the plight of his extended family.

The actors who aren't professional wrestlers sadly don't bring much to the table.  The soundtrack is also a liability.  And the effects budget... you know, the effects were better than I'd expected.  The blood did not come across very well on screen, but some of the other gore was effective in a way.  If you're watching the film because you're a huge fan of Kurt Angle and Matt Hardy, know that their roles are fairly small compared to Douglas and Piper.

The bottom line is that the film isn't as good as most zombie movies, and isn't as good as the principal casts' best wrestling matches.  But if you're looking to scratch both itches at the same time, this is probably the best combination that will ever be made.",1458000000,,1868,4.59214501510574

6998671,3,B00T00IK8A,"Funny! I used to watch Wrestling when Roddy Piper and Hacksaw Jim Duggan were Major in the league..It was bloody enough, my 8 year old cringed a little. All and all it was worth the watch!",1453161600,,188,4.25
6998672,2,B00T00IK8A,"WARNING SPOILERS - I figured that since ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper just recently passed away (July 30, 2015) from a heart attack at age 61, I would watch this unknown film in his memory. After a couple of minutes, I wish I watched THEY LIVE (1988) again. There's been a lot of professions and people squaring off (versus) against zombies (strippers, Navy SEALS, Abraham Lincoln, humans, Cockneys, cowboys, ninjas, vampires, Scouts, Tom Sawyer, etc), but I doubt that there is a better profession than a brawling wrestler. Until you see this film, that is. The film starts with one of the most anemically populated wrestling shows in recent memory (it's apparent that it was filmed at a high school gymnasium because you can see the basketball backboards in the ""up"" position) and there's an on-screen scrawl that says ""The ring is the only place you can kill a man and get away with it."" (Vince McMahon knows a lot about that). I knew right then and there that I was in for a spectacularly bad experience (And I was right). We see some wrestling matches that make TNT Wrestling look like Wrestlemania. There are no words in the dictionary to describe how badly this film sucked (This is where I would insert in a vacuum cleaner joke reference, but those companies don't deserve it in a film like this). After a wrestler named Billy (Michael H. Richmond) is killed in the ring by ""The Franchise"" Shane Douglas (playing himself; most A and B-Class wrestlers play themselves) populated sparsely by about 30 people (""Oh my G**, Billy's dead!), we see Billy's sinister brother Angus (Ashton Amherst) throw a big pile of money in front of wrestling promoter Cody (played by the director, Cody Knotts) and says he wants Shane Douglas and his girlfriend Taya Parker (famous female wrestler) for a special wrestling show he has planned at an abandoned penitentiary. Cody says for this amount of money, he can also get Angus other wrestlers, including Rowdy Roddy Piper, ""Hacksaw"" Jim Duggan, Matt Hardy, and his girlfriend Reba Skye (another famous female wrestler) and lots of lesser-known wrestlers. Cody says he can even deliver Olympic champion Kurt Angle, but Angus says to make Angle's entrance a surprise and have him enter through the side door (Wait a minute. Penitentiaries have side doors?). A nurse is then kidnapped by Angus' disciples (this happens right after the mirror in her compact shatters and we hear grunting and see a puff of dark smoke through the mirror shards). We then see her tied to the floor with lit candles all around her and duct tape over her mouth (Ah, duct tape. A killers best friend!). Angus puts on a plastic hoodie, takes a look at a photo of his brother Billy and then uses a dagger to cut open her chest,  remove her still-beating heart with his bare hands and then eats it. We then hear that growl again and see that puff of dark smoke, as a demon (most probably Satan himself) tells Angus that he can now get revenge for the death of Billy (The heartless nurse gets up and acts like Angus' lap dog). In a scene that makes zero sense, two second rate wrestlers enter Angus' home and the heartless nurse bites them, instantly turning them into zombies. We then see Shane Douglas having breakfast with his mother, brother, sister-in-law and his favorite, nephew Nicky (Drew Ripepi). Shane takes Nicky outside, where they talk, and when Cody returns to the inside of the house, he finds all the furniture overturned with the heartless nurse turning the rest of the family into zombies and she carries Nicky away. Shane then goes to his manager, Cody (Where Shane gets a dig into Vince McMahon for bouncing paychecks), and wants to know about this latest match and, especially, when he will get paid (Hey, what about his missing family?). Cody tells him he will get all the money, including the back pay owed to him, when he boards the bus tomorrow for the deserted West Virginia penitentiary. Shane runs into Roddy outside the building signing autographs for his young fans and Shane discovers that Roddy and a whole bunch of other wrestlers will be on the bus with him tomorrow. After they all take the bus ride and make it to the penitentiary, a man hops on board and tells them that whomever wins their matches will find much fortune and then makes them all turn over their cell phones to him (right then and there, I would have jumped off the bus and run away!). They turn over their cell phones with very little pressure. ""Hacksaw"" Jim Duggan (who looks horrible) is already there and Kurt Angle is attacked by zombies at the side entrance (He grabs one zombie by his foot and it falls off!). He quickly becomes zombie chow after his three minute cameo. Without any exposition, the zombies have Shane, Roddy and Hacksaw trapped in the ring, when Angus shows Shane he has Nicky. All the non-zombie wrestlers run through the prison and are picked off one-by-one by the horde of zombies (Matt Hardy is torn in half. Hacksaw Jim Duggan and his bloody two by four becomes zombie jerky after Shane locks the door behind him and refuses to let Hacksaw in). Seems like Shane is holding some deadly secrets, as he sacrifices his fellow wrestlers to stay alive. Shane killed Billy because he was screwing Taya Parker, which is why Angus wants them both dead (I do have to say that some of Shane's actions during this film deserves some bloody punishment). Angus has Shane surrounded by zombies, while Roddy and non-wrestler Sarah (Adrienne Fischer) try to avoid them. Angus cuts out another heart and eats it, so Roddy, Sarah and Shane escape outside. Angus tells Roddy, ""This is only the beginning!"" to which Roddy retorts, ""I beat cancer. This is nothing!"" (Roddy really did beat cancer.). After Roddy and Sarah kill a few dozen zombies, Angus yells out, ""I need more power!"", to which the demon replies, ""Granted!"" Corpses come crawling out of their graves and Roddy is attacked by a pack of the living dead, but Sarah saves him with her machete, putting her life in mortal danger. Shane catches up with Roddy & Sarah, where he is attacked by his zombified brother Troy (Cody Michael) and then by zombie Nicky. Shane kills them both, but he asks Roddy to kill his zombified mother , which Roddy does. Angus chains Shane's neck to a pole and slowly begins to choke him while zombies enjoy a meal of his innards. Sarah gets bitten in the neck by a zombie, but, for some unknown reason, the demon starts yelling in pain and all the zombies drop dead. Roddy and Angus get into a fight and Roddy wins (with the American flag as a backdrop, no less!). Turns out with the demon dying, Sarah will not turn into a zombie, so they both live happily ever after. At least Angus got his wish, but he put way too much work into it. Wouldn't it have been cheaper or easier just to hire a hitman to take both Shane and Taya out? I guess we wouldn't have this crappy movie then, right?  Besides using real-life wrestlers (wrestling is nothing but acting anyway, which is why there are so many wrestlers-turned-actors) and some over-the-top gore (a zombie snapping in two when Matt Hardy lifts him over his head; a head crushed in a refrigerator door; machete impalements; appendages torn off bodies; intestine eating; heart removals; etc.), there is very little to recommend here unless you are a gorehound. Hacksaw Jim Duggan looks simply terrible and his face is hardly shown, so it wouldn't surprise me if they used a stunt double in many of his scenes. The story is all over the place (especially Shane's temperament) and none of it makes a lick of sense; it's just an excuse to get some wrestlers to fight some cheesy-looking zombies. It sounds to the human ear that Roddy was improvising most of his lines because the ones that were given him in the script weren't very good. Roddy's the best thing about this film, but director/screenwriter/actor/co-producer Cody Knotts (LUCIFER'S UNHOLY DESIRE - 2011; BREEDING FARM - 2012) does nearly everything wrong and seems determined to sabotage this film with his lousy filmmaking technique. Especially disturbing is how Shane is portrayed. He seems highly schizophrenic. We are shown him being a loving family man and then saying that he loved killing Billy in the ring. Most people like this spend their lives in rubber rooms (or getting eaten by zombies). Well, at least he got his dig into Vince McMahon. I'm willing to bet McMahon was pissed when he heard what Shane said, but the fact that Shane wasn't sued probably makes what he said about Vince true. Otherwise the film makes no sense unless you want to see real-life wrestlers (some way past their prime) get eaten by or destroy zombies. Not a recommendation, though.
