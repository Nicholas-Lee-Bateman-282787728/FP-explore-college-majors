8157769,5,B000KKM6BQ,"A quite dazling movie on an obsession of an artist with magnificent images of riding horses and at the same time a high psychological ""depth"".
It wasn't a cheap acquisition, but it is worth while!",1455408000,,196,4.628571428571429
8157770,5,B000KKM6BQ,"This in a very artistic film and I think reveals a lot about how Bartabas sees horses.  The story is loosely based on fact, the characters existed but their main purpose is as an illustration of horse/human interaction of the haute ecole.  Bartabas is arguably one of the best trainers of horses in the world today. Anyone interested in the art of riding horses at the highest level will find this film fascinating.",1337385600,2,415,4.671232876712328
8157771,4,B000KKM6BQ,"For about an hour, this fever dream fantasized vision of the brief life
of the great horse painter Theodore Gericault really held me in it's
thrall.

A fictional story with real characters, the film imagines that
Gericault ran away to join the circus, but a circus run by Franconi, a
great horseman, whose horses and riders in the film perform truly
breathtaking feats. Franconi himself is portrayed as a leather mask
wearing, frightening presence. But this sounds far more grounded in
reality than this surreal film is to experience.

While the story didn't really even try tie together, the images of
horses and humans were worthy of the best of Greenaway, as was the
exquisite air of mystery.

But somehow the last 45 minutes felt more literal, more forced, and the
film lost some of it's power. It felt like the film slowly evolves from
a mysterious dream, to a story that needs to be neatly, if surreally
tied up, By growing more literal, it lost some power and magic. But
it's still a strong film, filled with some truly unforgettable images
of horses and humans in various combinations.",1330387200,4,1093,4.772486772486772
