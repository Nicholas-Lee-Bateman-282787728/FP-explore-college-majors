7915403,3,B000025RBJ,"I had the dubious pleasure of Bryson's self-satisfied ramblings in the book form of ""Notes from a small island"" a year or two ago. It was something to read at a time in my life when I had very little to do, I suppose!
This Christmas I had the even more dubious pleasure of seeing Mr Bryson on film presenting a screen adaption of his highly overrated work. As a travelogue in itself it is not bad at all. You do get quite a sense of the Ukfrom it. Pity about the presenter!
As an English person myself, I became very bored with the fact that Bryson consantly puts Britain down, albeit in a backhanded way. Also, if you listen carefully, you will see that what Bryson is really doing is talking about America. His references and comparisons are very often made with America. So what! He s supposed to be talking about the UK not the USA. I suppose it is an arrogant trait that many Yanks are predisposed towards, however for me, and I imagine for many other natives of what Brysonmakes out to be a small and insignificant isle populated solely by freks and eccentrics of all persuasions, Bryson's contant references to himself and his home country soon become very tiresome!
From reading the book, you just don't get a sense of how monotonous Bryson's drawl actually is. From what I recall, Bryson makes some very acrid remarks about many of my countrymen and women, but really, when you see Bryson, who obviously thinks he looks good like a bearded John Denver in a hiking jumper, you know he hasn't got a leg to stand on. Bryson has left the UK to go back to his beloved America. No doubt he is boring people to death over there with his so-called witticisms and anecdotes about the British. Good riddance is what I say!",1073174400,,1721,4.449367088607595
