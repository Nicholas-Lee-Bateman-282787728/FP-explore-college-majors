6822706,1,B00PV09C7G,"Ok, this is the very first negative review I've ever written, but in this particular case, it's definitely warranted. This movie is awful - lines, acting, costumes, etc. The plot line just couldn't get any worse - I couldn't even finish the movie. I've heard people say that before, not knowing what they meant, but this movie isn't worth the time or the brain cells to watch it. Come to think of it, it didn't take brain cells to watch it - boring, awful plot, not funny even in the worst sort of way.

Unfortunately there were a couple of things that bothered me personally.
The main character sleeping with the other girl. I think the movie could have been even better without that storyline.
It was nice that there was no foul language. But then right before the end, that was ruined. For me, that took away the cute innocence of the movie.",1532995200,,372,4.567164179104478

6822747,5,B00PV09C7G,"What did I like the most? The acting. The city (Chicago). The dialogue. The sweet sweet love story.

What did I like the least? I would have pumped a lot more money into the production, although I think Chicago looks more realistically like itself than in many films made there.

I was not familiar with the actors (except for Travanti). They were all perfectly suited to their roles. The sexual tension was gentle but grew in strength through the course of the the plot, which also made the main characters' story more believable. I liked this movie a LOT.",1531958400,3,557,4.616161616161616

6822750,5,B00PV09C7G,"This is one of those independent films made with a love and care that just grabs your heart and sucks you in.  In this case, it is also a real Chicago production.  While I have no involvement, I know some of the names in the credits and a bit of their backgrounds, and I can infer -- or imagine -- from that how this production came together.

I don't think I can give enough credit to Aubrey Dollar.  She takes her character, inhabits her, and makes you fall in love with her.  I can see how Josh ends up where he does.  And while his character is more laid back, there are moments where the film really shows their chemistry to best effect.  And like the best such scenes, it's the small things, the momentary interactions and rapport, that make this.

Add to this supporting cast who can shine and paint a convincing character, not just a foil.  Spence is particularly good at this, as Molly's sister-in-law.  And Josh's ""hook up"" interest, contrary to where stereotype might take such a character, proves herself to be surprisingly and refreshingly sympathetic.

No, not everything is perfect.  This is still a smaller, independent production.  And it has a few quirks.  Ones that, if you like the film, can actually be kind of endearing.  But it works very well in the essentials, including script, timing -- kudos again to the actors, as well as the editors -- cinematography, and editing.  And the music!  (Including some that is definitely local; you wouldn't know about it, otherwise.)

As others have commented, this is a film I find myself watching repeatedly.  It never fails to lift my spirits -- and wish for my own Molly, fire and all, especially the heart and humor.

It's become sort of my personal contemporary independent Chicago film exemplar.  Something I stumbled across and came to own as such.  I found another one that is similar for me, for New York:  ""Alto"".  These little slices, well done and with a lot of heart, that are like a personal souvenir one holds on to as a reminder of a place and time that's special to them.

Oh, and I almost forgot to mention:  This film carries some of that sentiment, itself.  For example, the references to John Hughes and his films set in Chicagoland, that captured a time and adolescence for a generation that has now gone on to reflect upon our time and place.  While remembering that heart.

(I'll add that, perhaps less noticed, the exterior of the frame shop is a building that IIRC is just west of the house that was the exterior of John Candy's home in ""Only the Lonely"", a film on which Hughes was a producer.  And Candy starred in his earlier ""Uncle Buck"".)",1531612800,6,2631,4.571734475374733

6822768,1,B00PV09C7G,"Cute movie, adorable plot, great characters, but I cannot endorse a movie where the female lead is abusive to men. She literally PUNCHED two men during the film, and neither was in self defense.

6822769,3,B00PV09C7G,"Heard great things about this one but I do not agree.  Basically Molly and Josh live in the same area. Both are returning to Chicago for Molly's mom's wedding.  Josh is a good friend of the family and best friends with Molly's brother. On the way Molly finds out her BF is married and breaks it off and Josh breaks it off with one of his young things who thought bringing her to Chicago was a sign of more. After all, he is a playboy and can't have that.  Stuck at the airport with Molly waiting for a flight, Josh receives a call from his father that he has terminal cancer and his one wish was to see Josh married. Of course, Josh tells him he is engaged to Molly. At first they assume, it will just be a small lie to dad but everyone is told and they end up really having to lie to their entire families.

The problem for me was that Josh was written as an unrepentant playboy. This is the first, ""pretend to be married"" movie where the groom actively has sex with someone else the entire time. Josh finds a FWB and proceeds to have sex with her until literally the day before he proclaims he has fallen for Molly. Really? Really? I felt bad for Molly if she really believed that.  Plus there is no reason for him to fall for Molly as the relationship just isn't explored in anyway other than they live together.  A weak romantic movie, which this is, has the main couple sleep together so you know they are in love. But that isn't the same thing Josh obviously doesn't know what love is and will likely be cheating on her within the year. Kind of a bummer.",1522627200,,1560,4.20066889632107

6822777,5,B00PV09C7G,"I read a ""professional"" review about this movie that dismissed it as a ""romantic comedy by the numbers."" And? What's the problem with that? That's why women watch these movies and read romances. We know how it's going to end. We know what's going to happen. It's the journey that makes it fun.

The cast in this movie was excellent, especially the lovely and very talented Aubrey Dollar as Molly (why isn't she in more stuff? She's excellent!). Molly is the younger sister of Josh's best friend, and they're both going back to Chicago for her mom's wedding. Josh finds out this his father is dying of cancer, and his father's dying wish is to meet his son's fiancee. Josh is a Player, and the very thought of marriage gives him hives. With a passed out Molly next to him (long story!) he tells his father he's getting his wish as he's already engaged. Molly agrees to go along with it because she loves his parents and it will get her own Irish-Catholic family off her back about getting married (as she has extremely poor taste in men).

I love the fake boyfriend/fake fiance trope, and this one lived up to all my expectations. The couple is adorable, you believe and can see why they fall in love with each other (although I didn't like Josh's dalliance with Giselle) and there is definite heat and chemistry between the two leads. I even loved her reaction to his confession of love (so unexpected!) Yes the story's predictable and you know how it's going to end, but there's a ton of romance and some laugh out loud funny parts and seriously, what more can you ask for from a movie like this?

Keep watching through the end credits as there's a scene tacked on that lets you know what's happened to Molly and Josh and it's so cute and sweet.",1484784000,,1746,4.484276729559748

6822795,4,B00PV09C7G,"I was so very lucky to see this film before it had any distribution. I saw it at the 2013 Napa Valley Film festival in St Helena CA. OK so what do we have here? Another romantic comedy, we've seen them all right? I always want to see a good one, but it seems in recent years you get a lot of bad to average ones, and once in a blue moon you hit a really good one.

 I won't lie, in the first 7-8 minutes, I thought it would be another C- movie. For some reason it just felt like at the 10 minute mark this film found its legs and got going. The production is first rate, it can hang with any of the big budget movies, but our two stars really lift this movie above the rest of the pack.

Shane McRae is really solid as that kind of jerky guy that might be hiding a decent human being inside. But in my opinion Aubrey Dollar is the gem here. She is small in stature, over emotional, and ultimately becomes a little firecracker when things begin to crumble around her. So what's the story? Nothing earth shattering. The boy knows his father is dying, and dad's wish to see his son marry the love of his life isn't in the cards. So Boy conspires with girl to fake engagement to make everyone happy.

Things (everything it seems) go wrong, and hilarity ensues. Along the way, two people might start to have feelings for each other. Nothing here is unique or totally original it seems. But the story is more skillfully crafted and told, and of course two fantastic leads and a solid supporting cast bring this often told kind of story rise above the rest. The only thing that bums me out is that no blu ray release is planned. The DVD was released in the US shortly after this film made the film festival rounds. A blu ray was released in Germany, with both German and English tracks but it's a different region coded title and won't play in standard US players. Boo. Well with small films this is usually the case.

One last bit of info, the Cameo Cinema only brings back one (one year it was two) film to play outside of the film festival and this film was picked to come back. It screened to a sold out crowd at the 2013 Film festival and was chosen to return on Valentine's day weekend in 2014 and yes I saw it again with a group of friends. It's a fantastic rental, so if you are in the mood for something romantic and funny that doesn't suck here you go. I'm including a photo from the NVFF 2013 Aubrey Dollar with director John Burgess after movie Q&A.",1472083200,,2454,4.190677966101695

The premise is nothing new, and various iterations in the past have been entertaining. But in this version, (in addition to the previously mentioned items) the characters were not likeable at all. I only watched part of it because it was so unbearable.

I have appreciated Hallmark because their shows are, for the most, part clean and family-friendly, but this was way off the path and since it is relatively new, I'm a little worried. I hope this is not an indication of a new direction for them. Sigh.",1430265600,7,595,4.881188118811881

6822964,4,B00PV09C7G,"This engaging and comedic romantic farce was filmed close to where I live, so I was waiting to see when it would be on the shelves of my favorite small town rental spot. Just now hitting the shelves, I picked it out for a view. I always enjoy a movie that has a quizzical theme with interesting characters, although mainly I enjoy movies that are this easy to watch at times. ""One Small Hitch"" fills the bill with comedic mix-ups, a bit of romance and a story that is predictably fun to follow - yes, predictable and that is why I liked it as much as I did.

For a couple who may be slightly confused about the reasons why they need to get married, the ride from point A to point B doesn't always go as smoothly as one may expect and things get thrown in when you don't expect them. It is always just fine though when one does not have to invest any time in a convoluted or complicated storyline that doesn't finish as neatly as the bow on a wrapped wedding gift. There are quite a few interesting personalities in Josh Shiffman's (Shane McRae) family who is ready to see him wed for a particular family reason. His ""loser"" friend, Molly Mahoney (Aubrey Dollar) just may have to step into character for this to work - and for ... other reasons.

An engaging viewing evening with this 'Here Comes the Bride' tale and nothing to have to analyze afterward. I find these films enjoyable when you just do not want a complicated plot but to be entertained with the story. There are times that these types of films are necessary fare for me and I liked this one. This film will be a purchase for me as I do enjoy a wedding theme that was attractive enough for repeat views.
 *The soundtrack of the film is particularly well-done too which made the view even better.",1426809600,8,1758,4.3373860182370825
6822965,1,B00PV09C7G,"I guess, like many people, I can watch a ""feel good"" romantic comedy once in a while and hopefully enjoy it.  Some I do and some I don't, but hey, that's life.  Unfortunately this movie fell into the second category.  In fact I found the premise for the story to be an insult to my general intelligence.
Ok, so we have a young lady (Molly), leaving on a trip home for a wedding and she discovers while at the airport that her boyfriend is married. She has ""loser"" written all over her (and later admits this fact).  While on the plane, she meets a guy from her past childhood days (Josh).  One she obviously had a crush on at some time or another.  Now Josh is currently in a relationship but it seems he is going home to see his father (who is dying from cancer).  His father has told him that his one big wish is to see his son get married before he departs this life. So, up until there, the story (while a bit predictable) is moving slowly along.
Now Josh comes up with what he considers a great idea. Why don't he and Molly pretend to be engaged and make his father happy?  Unfortunately, life tells us that lying to someone who is dying (in an effort to please them) is generally a recipe for disaster, but I guess the writer/s of the tale felt that they could generate enough humor in the scheme of things so that we would forget about that.  Ha!!
Well it turns out that Josh really believes he is the ultimate ladies man.  He has an urge to bed any and every good looking woman he comes in contact with.  And he is such a self centered, egotistical  **** of a guy that he feels he can even justify this fact to both himself and Molly.  After all, he says, we are both entitled to live our own lives.  What we are doing together is just pretend, isn't it?  And true to form, good old Molly (the loser) agrees, even though she obviously does have feelings for Josh. And what about the girl who Josh is supposedly involved with?  The one he left behind?  Heck, she doesn't even rate a mention at this time.
Needless to say, adding this aspect to the sham can only add to the possibility of discovery of the whole sad sordid mess which very nearly occurs.
By this time Josh and Molly have had to take the pretense to a higher level.  So much so that Josh's parents are investigating possible wedding venues. Josh's parents are coming down the stairs from the venue they have just inspected when low and behold, the elevator doors open.  Out pops little Josh with his latest conquest and they embrace passionately.  Mother spots them and re-directs father back up the stairs so that he doesn't see what she sees.
And to top it off, Josh and Molly soon after ""hit the sack"" together.  I mean, this guy has some serious psychological problems and poor old Molly is obviously no better.  She knows what Josh is up to but she can't help herself.  And I need to remind you (as I had to try an remind myself) that this is supposed to be a ""romantic comedy""!!!
Anyway, to cut this short, while at a restaurant, Josh's father suffers what appears to be a heart attack.  Wow, emergency, everyone to the hospital.  And sure enough, Josh turns up with his paramour but proposes to Molly and she accepts.  So a wedding occurs and loser Molly marries a guy she knows will jump into bed with anything wearing a skirt, when ever the urge hits.  All in all, not a very funny movie.  Sure there are a few laughs and a few one liners, but considering the sadness of the real story behind it all, they didn't work for me.",1426809600,16,3505,4.293759512937595
