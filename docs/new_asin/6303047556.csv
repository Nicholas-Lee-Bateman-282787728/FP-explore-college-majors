8611821,5,6303047556,"I've seen the Goldy films two or three times now. I think they are gems. I'm no film critic, but I showed it to my son when he was little and to my grandchildren recently. They love it and I love watching them see a silly story about those majestic creatures, the California Bear on our flag. As an urban creature ,I like the adventures of a girl set in nature. They are rare. Jesse and the Bear are endearing. The other characters provide the comic relief you look for up in the mountains.
I hear the Goldy films have a growing following in Europe, so it must be the kind of family film a lot of people over there enjoy too.",1261094400,3,625,4.131147540983607
