8195583,5,B000QCUA0C,"the price is great! I like Ferlin Husky's music and these movies are great to see him in action. And as a dded bonus there is Pvt Snuffy Smith and Lil' Abner. I haven't seen Lil' Abner since I was 10 and that was 50 years ago.  And it is still pretty funny. Nice transfer. Snuffy Smith is a good transfer, not great, but good.  In the movie ""Hillbilly's in a Haunted House"", check out Ferlin's car, what a hoot.

Now, these movies are not for everyone. It is a strange taste, but to see Ferlin sing, Jane Mansfield strut her stuff and to see Snuffy Smith and Lil' Abner for a trip back to my childhood, they are worth it.",1492819200,,621,4.115702479338843
8195584,3,B000QCUA0C,"None of these films are especially great, but they are rarely seen curiosities worth a bit of a look. The two Ferlin Huskys are entertaining enough with top line supporting casts. Husky was a pretty good singer, but so much as an actor. The concert sequence at the end of Hillbillys in a Haunted House is way too overlong. Somehow, the director should have interwoven the music with the plot and some action, the way William Witney used to do with the Roy Rogers films. Snuffy Smith is pretty funny if obvious, but delighted to catch up with a rare film based on the Barney Google comic strip.",1481587200,,593,4.5

8195588,3,B000QCUA0C,Have not seen the discs but have previously seen the films.  Whoever wrote the Amazon description of the films - specifically the one re: Lil' Abner apparently does not know that the Brit comics character(and US by import _ Andy Capp is Not the creator of Li'l Abner .  That would be Al Capp.  Carry On!!!,1432080000,,305,4.410714285714286
8195589,4,B000QCUA0C,"I'll say right off, I'm not a big fan of country music per se, but I am a fan of a few of the stars in VCI's HILLBILLY COMEDY COLLECTION. This two-disc DVD set contains four films with a country music and/or hillbilly premise: LAS VEGAS HILLBILLYS (1966), HILLBILLYS IN A HAUNTED HOUSE (1967), PRIVATE SNUFFY SMITH (1942), and LI'L ABNER (1940).

My main reasons for purchasing this set are the two films on disc one starring three of my favorite '60's blondes, Jayne Mansfield, Mamie van Doren and Joi Lansing. Essentially playing herself, Jayne co-stars with Mamie in LAS VEGAS HILLBILLYS, directed by Arthur C. Pierce. The girls help country favorite Ferlin Husky use his inheritance to open a casino in Vegas. B-movie veteran Jean Yarbrough helmed the semi-sequel, HILLBILLYS IN A HAUNTED HOUSE, which has Husky teaming up with pin-up queen Joi Lansing who end up in a spooky old mansion housing a band of spies comprised of horror greats Basil Rathbone, John Carradine, and Lon Chaney. Both films have thin plots (as they should) built around putting on a jamboree, with lots of laughs and featured performances by some of the popular country music stars from the era. HAUNTED HOUSE is the better of the two, helped greatly by the presence of Rathbone, Carradine and Chaney, who spoof their well-known screen personas. The transfer quality on the movies is gorgeous, with vibrant color, crisp sharpness and clean audio.

Disc two has PRIVATE SNUFFY SMITH, an army camp comedy directed by Edward F. Cline and starring slow-burn comic Edgar Kennedy, and LI'L ABNER, the first live action feature based on Al Capp's famous comic strip. Directed by Albert S. Rogell and starring Granville Owen in the title role with Martha O'Driscoll as Daisy Mae, and an uncredited appearance by the great Buster Keaton as an Indian, the film is a faithful depiction of Capp's beloved characters in the fictional town of Dogpatch, U.S.A. The quality on these public domain titles isn't up to the level of the HILLBILLYS double feature, but they're as good as their sources allow.

Recommended for country music and Jayne Mansfield/Joi Lansing/Mamie van Doren fans.",1376870400,3,2150,4.950138504155125
8195590,5,B000QCUA0C,"Watch this movie and you can feel like it's the 1960's, you're fourteen years old and watching TV in the safety and comfort of your mom's home (I didn't have a dad). It's a completely dumb plot but remember you're only fourteen years old. I won't say much about the plot except to say that the producers were obviously trying to cash in on current entertainment icons of the age so they combined elements of spy and horror movies with country western music and stars.  For me that worked the same way I used to combine several flavors of pop at a restaurant soda fountain as a kid.  Best of all is to watch and appreciate the actors whose authentic personalities resonate through the hokey characters they play. Ferlin Husky is a genuine Nashville country western star of the mid twentieth century and he shines with all the warmth and honesty that rural America has always meant to me.  Ferlin seems like the kind of guy who would stop on the highway and help you fix your flat tire and then give you directions to a truck stop with the best chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes or grits (your choice) and homemade pecan pie. Merle Haggard doesn't act in this movie but he does perform with his band and if you want to see vintage Haggard from the days when he really was an Okie from Muskogee then here it is. Basil Rathbone, John Carradine and Lon Chaney can be appreciated as great old Hollywood actors who having lived past their relevance to the movie industry are simply trying to work in a film and make a few bucks - I think we can all relate to that. Also there's a beautiful actress named Joi Lansing who has a staring role and she can also really act. In fact she's so beautiful I found myself hitting the pause button several times just to feast on her many endowments. I can only wonder why she never hit the big time.  You can enjoy this movie on a few different levels but for me I approach it like an archaeologist who has just uncovered a buried vault of mid twentieth century America.",1362441600,5,2003,4.405405405405405
8195591,4,B000QCUA0C,"If you are a country music fan from the early Sixties you will appreciate seeing some of the country music stars performing from that time.  The Hillbilly Collection is just a good 'ol time of entertainment.  The set includes: Hillbilly's in Las Vegas and Hillbilly's in a Haunted House plus Jayne Mansfield and Mamie Van Doren!!  The other two features is the first Lil'Abner movie in black & white and Snuffy Smith in the Army which is really very funny, also in black & white. Pure Hillbilly with lots of laughs.",1281484800,6,515,4.637362637362638
