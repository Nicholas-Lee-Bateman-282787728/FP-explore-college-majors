6155008,5,B00HDG4X5M,"if life were indeed a cabaret then Rufus' accomplishments would be heard the world over. I'd bet he'd even dance a can-can if asked.  As it stands his music is featured on many hit movie soundtracks, His original opera composition was a splendid effort uniquely Rufus (we are still waiting for la Prima Dona to tour in Los Angeles), This genius has devoted a lifetime of  original works to captivate audiences old and young, his quirky humor,  his unique vocal style, entwine to capture our hearts and imaginations and in its wake creates a loyal following of long time fans and fellow musicians. Glad to hear Krystal Warren and Teddy Thompson on the tracks of this CD.  Rufus the artist makes incredible music, Rufus who is passionate about his work and astonishingly open about his personal life reveals much pain and darkness but also whimsey and redemption on many of his tracks.  The tracks on this collection are a whitman's sampler of wainwrights richly talented truffles. Uniquely Rufus. He writes songs that are relevant and chic.  Lets stop the mindless swill on the radio airways -  we need change, we need more Rufus on  the radio  Free Rufus Radio for a FAB planet,",1397001600,3,1178,4.763546798029557

8631663,5,B00HDG4X5M,"Rufus has a beautiful voice and is extremely talented. I like him live but he doesn't need a band to back him up, actually I like him with just his guitar and/or piano so his voice becomes the prominent thing you hear. This is certainly worth watching!!",1415404800,,253,4.404255319148936
