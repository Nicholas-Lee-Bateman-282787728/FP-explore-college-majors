8561290,5,B00B2A0IP4,"First, let me start with a disclaimer that I didn't purchase this DVD but I went thru around 31 topics covered in this DVD, originally hosted on IIL's website.
The contents are very informative covering various topics on Project Management, and one on Six Sigma, presented by Dr Harold Kerzner,James Brown,Dr Thomas Juli among others. And yes, it also covered some case studies of Wartsila Corp and Respsol. Each topic runs for  approximately 30 minutes and not too heavy on contents.

I will recommend this DVD for those keen on honing their PM Knowledge & Skills. And not to forget the 15 PDUs that a PMP can claim on going thru the topics covered in this DVD.
