8152610,1,B000JPZ3SA,"I have the DVD version, too. The Blu ray is just as bad; 4:3 and only Dolby Digital 2.0. Simply transferred to Blu ray with no Hi Def mastering whatsoever!!! Don't buy ANY version!!!",1363219200,,182,4.382352941176471

8152612,1,B000JPZ3SA,"Obviously a low-budget affair.  Random, stock footage from seemingly old movies and/or reenactments ('60s/'70s) are used to illustrate key Civil War battles, often over & over.  There is a grand total of one (yes, one) ""expert"" used constantly who rambles on & on.  I actually nodded off several times before finally giving up (I didn't even finish it).  Not worth your time, trust me!  (Stick to ""The Civil War"" by Ken Burns)",1225238400,11,426,4.861111111111111

What I found was a boring film. Its only salvation was the importance of the subject matter. I assume it was historically accurate, but the graphics were repetitive in both discs, and the narration was dull and ponderous, particularly  by the persons filmed . It is an interesting subject, but these DVDs don't do it justice. There must be a better source. Duane R. Kullberg",1216339200,17,736,6.829787234042553
