7850949,5,6303593461,"""L'Innocente"" is the last film of Visconti (1976), he died shortly after.
It is a masterpiece, such a careful and refine portrait of XIX century Italian aristocracy, an intense tragedy done with extreme good taste and style characteristic of one of the greatest film director of the Italian cinema.
Gianncarlo Giannini and Laura Antonelli give great performances. The cinematography by Pasquelino de Santis and the music (!) of Franco Mannino
are superb. This film is an unusual cinematographic experience.",1199491200,8,506,5.417721518987341
7850950,5,6303593461,"This movie is perfect in every way. The cinematography is absolutely hypnotic. The performances are brilliantly subtle,yet powerful. It is an excellent study of passion,jealousy and desperation. Each scene is so multilayered,that upon repeated viewing it could never be boring. The musical score is a beautiful accompaniment,greatly adding to the feel of the movie. I highly recommend this movie to anyone,but I especially think of it being a great experience for anyone who is interested in increasing their knowledge of great filmakers like Luchino Visconti.",1019692800,13,560,5.6
7850951,4,6303593461,"A free adaptation of GABRIELE D'ANNUNZIO's novel , this is a terrific melodrama that will pleased mostly lovers of those turn of the century stories dealing with adultry. Slow moving it is ,but never boring and you guys will ravish at LAURA ANTONELLI's stunning figure. If you don't think that LAURA is beautiful then you must be blind. It's fun to see TULIO (GIANCARLO GIANNINI)go crazy when his wife is announcing him that she is pregnant from another man. The hypcrosy of bourgeois life is interestingly treated and that villa, plus the fashion of the time making all the women look their best. One truely wonderful love scene and finally let me say that i would like to see other movies like this. You guys watch out ,because your wife or girlfriend may ask you:am i as beautiful as LAURA?OK now you're in trouble.",972518400,15,818,4.6875
7850952,4,6303593461,"A beautiful movie, as many others of Visconti.  Devinitely a must-see for Italian movie lovers and for any serious movie lover in general.",959040000,4,138,5.0
7850953,3,6303593461,"I always enjoy it when someone tells me about a film maker who I should look out for. After learning about Visconti I took it upon myself to rent his films. And this is the first one I rented. The film is filled with  lavish sets,wonderful cinematography, and great acting from each character.  But Visconti on the other hand seems to be a director who doesn't seem to  demand too much from his actors. His directing style seems very tenuous. He  doesn't seem to take control of his actors. Which is a much different  feeling I get when I watch Bergman or Kurosawa. All in all Visconti made a  very interesting film. It may seem a bit slow,but carries your interest  untill the end.",954806400,6,682,4.451612903225806
