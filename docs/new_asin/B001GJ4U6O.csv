The Chili Peppers are one of the best live bands in the world, however, and this is the only live footage (that I know of) documenting their brief stint with Dave Navarro on lead guitar. If you are a huge Chili Peppers fan who also loves Janes Addiction (like me) this DVD is a rare find. Though the video is only one hour long the band sounds amazing and Mr. Navarro does not disappoint, lending the band a slightly heavier more experimental sound much as he did on ""One Hot Minute"".  The flaming hard hats worn by the band during ""Power Of Equality"" say it all. These boys are on fire!

So to review; bad video quality, mediocre sound, GREAT SHOW!, rare footage. Your move. Personally I am happy I own it.",1352332800,,790,4.36734693877551
8305513,2,B001GJ4U6O,"It's nice to finally see a RHCP concert from the Navarro era (the DVD cover is misleading). However, this is essentially a bootleg quality DVD (below average audio/video). And, most disappointing of all, the audio is noticeably out of sync with the video, which is unforgivable for a retail product in this day and age.",1283644800,5,319,4.818181818181818
8305514,4,B001GJ4U6O,I liked the video but the date is wrong in the description. The concert is from 1994. So a lot of the songs a know weren't on the video. It was good.,1277856000,2,149,3.6875
8305515,1,B001GJ4U6O,"This dvd sucks!!! It nothing but a montage of pics (the same pics) repeated over & over; set to music (Which aren't even Chili Peppers songs) Followed by interviews with everybody but the RHCP. The interviews are good but they're are much better dvds out there(Off the Map, Funky Monks & Red Hot Chili Peppers - Live at Slane Castle) Save your money and buy one of them. Live at Slane Castle has the best concert footage. Also check out Greatest Hits and Videos -Red Hot Chili Peppers, It has videos plus extra behind the scenes.",1216771200,5,529,4.520833333333333
