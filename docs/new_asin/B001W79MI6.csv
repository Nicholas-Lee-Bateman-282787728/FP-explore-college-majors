8347069,5,B001W79MI6,"We got these two seasons because we have seen Season 1 & 2 over and over on Comedy Central in the UK and were desperate to know what happened after Casino Night! We were not disappointed - we watched both seasons in a matter of days, it was that great. Now all we can do is wait for Season 5 to be on DVD so we can see what happens after the fireworks die down. So exciting!",1245456000,2,374,3.8701298701298703
