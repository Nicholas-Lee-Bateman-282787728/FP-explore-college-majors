8069898,5,B0009XTYGO,"I have been using Dalton's system for 16 years now.  I am a scratch golfer.  I will tell you that this swing is easier to understand than any other but it like all the other still requires practice.  One benefit to this swing is that after a few years and the muscle memory takes hold then it is pretty easy to take off sometime and still be able to stripe it.  You need to follow all of Dalton's steps exact though.  Also, you need to move the ball back in your stance just a little.  Maybe an inch or less.  The rollling of the LEFT HAND ONLY is the key.  You must learn to keep the right hand out of the swing if you are going to do this swing.  It will work but you have to put in the time.  I think this swing is easier to practice than any other.",1355961600,2,752,3.888157894736842
8069899,2,B0009XTYGO,"The straight shooting ""point"" videos changed my game for the better. If you follow the video, you will hit the ball straight.  Very straight forward and tangible lessons. I even play better if I just watch it the night before I play.

The ""short game"" is not quit as informative. Doesn't include a real lesson about what is a consistent way to better your short game.",1247011200,2,367,4.545454545454546
8069900,2,B0009XTYGO,"To be honest, I was disappointed.

All he did was show what Dave Pelz and other people say about the short game.  Let your arms become a 'clock' and swing to 6pm or 8pm or 10pm to regulate your distances, and with different clubs come different distances.  Pretty standard stuff.  I got it pretty cheap so I was happy that I didn't spend too much $ for what amounted to be no new information.",1236902400,,392,4.256756756756757
