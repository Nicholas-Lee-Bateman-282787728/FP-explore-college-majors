3644307,4,B001HUHBBS,"This combo pack features both the package for the first and second seasons of ""The Invaders"". The show looks quite good with a few exceptions during the first season set. It appears that the episodes are drawn from cleaned up 35 mm vintagae prints.

During the first season we discover along with architect David Vincent (Roy Thinnes) that there is a plot by aliens from another world to take over our world. They take human form  but have some distinct differences (at least some of them)that make them obvious to someone like Vincent. He has a difficult time getting people to believe him initially but he gathers enough evidence to become a threat.

The first season set includes one episode where footage had to be substituted from what appears to be 16mm print syndication print as the original episode print was damaged. The few scenes pulled from this are very soft and blurry but otherwise the rest of the prints look extremely good for their age. Color is pretty solid throughout (even when upscaled on my Blu-ray player) and CBS/Paramount has cleaned up most of the dirt and debris with white speckles the only noticeable flaw in most of the episodes (typical of films from the time--caused during the duplication process from the interpositive).

The other issue is that the pilot evidently has been time compressed (why? I'm not exactly sure given that it would have fit just fine on the disc at a full 51 minutes)it runs about 49 minutes. I really didn't notice it all that much until I compared the vocal timbre on the 60 minute pilot episode that is included as an extra. Why this occured I'm not sure unless this was an accident or they weren't sure about how well things would fit given the extras that were planned (or perhaps the show was sourced from a digital transfer of the UK version of the series which is in the PAL vs. NTSC format that is commonly used in the U.S.--these run at slightly different speeds which could account for this).

We get introductions for each episode by actor Roy Thinnes as well as an extended interview in which he reveals he saw a UFO just prior to accepting the role in the series.

Creator Larry Cohen provides a commentary track on the episode ""The Innocents"" where he reveals that while producer Quinn Martin didn't really want him to write any episodes after creating the show, he did provide outlines for the bulk of the 16 episodes during the first season that were followed pretty closely.

We also get three season one promos and the rarely seen 60 minute extended version pilot. The source for the hour long pilot has faded more than the 45 minute pilot version and looks a bit more gritty than the aired pilot but overall looks quite good. We get all 16 first season episodes here as well. The 45 minute version of the pilot appears to run a bit fast and I'm not sure if that is because it came from a PAL source or if it might have been time compressed a bit. This isn't the case with the 60 minute version of the pilot.

The second season set includes all 26 second season episodes. Again, star Thinnes provides introductions for each episode. We also get interview footage centering around the production of the second season. Alan Armer line producer for Quinn Martin Productions on ""The Invaders"" provides a commentary track on ""The Peacemaker"" and he reveals that the line producers in many respects acted as story editors on the show as well assigning/writing/producing episodes. Martin's shows always had top notch production values but Armer does cite one of the common failings of Martin's other shows--falling into a predictable formula something that ""The Invaders"" managed to avoid for the most part during its brief two season run on ABC.

In the second season Vincent begins to gather others who believe him and work with him including millionaire Kent Scoville (Kent Smith). During the second season, Vincent pursues the aliens and even finds some aliens that for their own reasons are willing to help and cooperate with Vincent although they have very different motives.

Image quality for the second season is also extremely good. Colors are solid throughout and the episodes have been clenaed up outside of white specks on the film source (which, again, are from the 35mm prints that were used for airing on the show).

Packaging is quite nice in a multiple disc holder Amray case with clear plastic. On the inside you can read an episode summary for each episode, it's original air dates and the extras for the set.

Overall, this is quite a good package and CBS/Paramount has done a good job of presenting the show only using inferior sourced print material on one episode that I found. The extended pilot was searched for as an extra for this set almost delaying the original release date of the set as they searched for it.

The only thing missing here is the two hour pilot for the 1990's version of ""The Invaders"" with Scott Bakula that NBC tried to launch. That would have made a nice extra and bookended the series nicely but, aside from that minor point, this is an extremely good set that fans of the series will enjoy.",1240099200,103,5113,4.6867335562987735
3644308,4,B001HUHBBS,So far enjoying the show.  Too bad it didn't make it for a third season.,1239926400,2,72,3.8
3644309,5,B001HUHBBS,Great DVD set of an old TV show. Just like I remembered. Good quality video and packaging.,1238544000,5,90,4.352941176470588
3644310,5,B001HUHBBS,"As a kid I used to look forward to the night that The Invaders was on just as positively as a child would look forward to the start of the summer vacation. Of all the great shows of this period which included Star Trek by the way, this was this then early teenagers favorite. For some reason the show seemed to never go into syndication (the video will tell you that it is one of the most popular shows in syndication in Europe). The Sci-Fi Channel finally ran the series in the early 1990s and I taped them. Well, VHS tape breaks down and of course I had to deal with commercials so it was with GLEE that I found this fine series on DVD. I couldn't order quickly enough and once again felt like a 13 year old again awaiting the delivery.
Once the shipment arrived I spent several days at work feeling like roadkill from staying up late watching this show. I still feel that it was the finest Quinn Martin Production made and brought paranoia to life in a manner which few if any programs have managed before or since. The program has aged quite well, much better than this viewer has and remains actually a well written and of course well produced adult oriented thriller featuring a main character portrayed by Roy Thinnes whose acting skills actually lets you get the feel of being a person who is a sole witness to an ongoing,hidden alien invasion and can find few believers to help him in his virtually single handed defense of our planet and oh so slowly only gradually picking up fellow witnesses as he fights the enemy that has taken human form (though some exhibit a peculiarity of their hand), with their sole motivation being to make our world, theirs. If this show came out today, with or without todays digital special effects which this show did not have available, it would be extremely successful in this viewers belief.
The Fugitive was a Quinn Martin Production as were several other highly successful shows of the period but this relatively unknown production was by far superior to all the others. If you never saw this program when it originally aired or if you did and have forgotten it, trust me and purchase this series of DVDs. The price is a bargain and all you will lose will be a bit of productivity at the jobsite as, like a great book, it is really hard to stop watching this once you start which will lead to numerous nights of limited sleep.
This quite simply was my most enjoyable purchase in recent memory and made this balding 55 year old feel like the 13 and 14 year old he was when he first enjoyed this finely crafted and thrilling show when it originally aired.
Trust me and buy it while you can. I guarantee you, no matter your age, that if high action science fiction appeals to you that you cannot find a better purchase. If high action science fiction hasn't appealed to you before then it will if you take the chance and view this classic late 1960's era series. And do not miss the special feature at the end of the last video of the series and when you view each program chose Mr. Thinnes introduction to each program.
Man, I am so glad I bought this series! I hope you do too!",1238457600,102,3123,4.41421143847487
3644311,3,B001HUHBBS,"This was exactly as advertised. It brought back memories, the feel of the 60's is here. It also reminded me of how easy I was to entertain when I was young.

Now however, I understand why it only lasted 2 seasons. All the stories are the same, with different scenery. You'll ask yourself. Is everybody really that dumb? A little thinking would have exposed this invasion.

I kept asking myself two questions. 1)How can anyone, now unemployed, afford to do all this investigative traveling? Must be some credit card.

2) If It's one shot one kill; and it is, in this show. Why not get a semi automatic gun and an extra clip. Enter an invader location. There always lightly ""manned"", and shoot everyone in sight. Then call in the TV press.

3644316,5,B001HUHBBS,"After all these years, this series still sends a chill up my spine. David Vincent is an architect who witnesses the landing of a flying saucer, piloted by aliens. When he tries to tell the authorities what happened he is not believed and the spacecraft is gone. From then on, Vincent becomes aware that the nonhuman aliens have taken on human form and are here in numbers, with the purpose of wiping out humanity and taking the planet. They have infiltrated all areas of society, but luckily their numbers are initially not great. This is a great opportunity for series binge watching and will raise your paranoia to the ceiling.

  The clarity of the sound,and the video transfer is excellent. Each episode is shown in it's broadcast order with an intro to each episode by the man himself - Roy Thinnes. I am dating myself here, but it is nice to see some of the early TV stars before they were well known on TV.
The only problem I have with the set is with the storage boxes. The disc securing tabs are brittle, and the first disc of the second season was floating around in the box. Fortunately there was no damage to the DVD.
I would like to see these two seasons  combined into one box set with outside artwork similar to the BSG series boxset.",1439942400,,832,4.220125786163522

I can't really write anything that anyone else hasn't already written.  But I did want to comment on a few things.  This was not a show that I could watch many episodes in a row.  It was basically the same thing in each episode.  I had to space them out over time.  I liked how it was treated seriously.  Roy is a fine actor and believable in the role.

3644345,4,B001HUHBBS,"The Invaders is a Quinn Martin Production (The Fugitive) as as such it offers a high production value and lots of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury automobiles (even the used and wrecked vehicles are Fords.) QM also assures you of a lot of top established and up-and-coming actors. Names like Michael Rennie (The Day the Earth Stood Still), Jack Lord (Hawaii Five-O), Roddy McDowell (Planet of the Apes), Susan Plashette (The Bob Newhart Show, William Talman (Perry Mason), Peter Graves (Mission: Impossible), Gary Walberg (Quincy, M.E.), Russel Johnson (Gilligan's Island), Wayne Rogers (MASH) and Susan Oliver (Star Trek.) And speaking of Star Trek, you Star Trek fans will be delighted as you find yourself saying to yourself, ""I remember that guy (gal) from the such-and-such episode of Star Trek"" on practically every episode of The Invaders. The special effects are good. Out of the hundred of times the aliens incenerate upon death on screen only once was there a shadow left on the film (and it was so obvious I'm surprised it passed post-production.) Another glaring error was a tracing of bullet marks on the rear window of a car, they floated on film. That's not bad out of 43 episodes.
The Invaders, the story of architect David Vincent trying to warn the world that their are invaders from outer space on Earth bent on doing us harm, is a study in paranoia. Creator Larry Cohen even said in one of the two commentaries in the set that the series was a commentary on the Red Scare. You may want to brush up on the history of the McCarthy Era to have a proper perspective on The Invaders.
In a final note, as was true of the 1960's, they smoked too much, they drank too much but they did know how to dress.",1429142400,,1709,4.662251655629139

Seeing it now in the DVD set is like watching it for the first time. Except for the cars and the clothes, it could be contemporary and of today. The writing is excellent, FAR better than most of the drivel on TV today! Roy Thinnes as the lead is very believable and doesn't overact but behaves like an intelligent Indivdual might do when confronted by an alien menace.

3644349,5,B001HUHBBS,"When I got The Invaders in the mail in late December, 2014 I thought I'd watch one episode a night during January and February 2015 to lighten the winter gloom.  I ended up power-watching the whole thing in two weeks at the beginning of the new year!  I do have memories of trying to watch this show as a kid during its original run from 1967-1968, but my frail nine and ten year old mind was too scared of it to continue.  I'm a whole lot tougher now!  As a long-time grown-up I found to my delight (during my viewing binge) that The Invaders is actually a thoughtful, character-driven show.  The special effects are minimal (they could do a whole lot better with the saucer effects these days, which would make it scarier, for sure), but each story had some subplot with a lot of human interest.  I was entertained, and sometimes even enlightened (believe it or not), by David Vincent's interactions with the guest stars.  Each guest star seemed to have some backstory or baggage that was unpacked during the episode.  In short, it wasn't just a show about aliens and humans beatin' the tar out of each other every week (although they did have their share of good old-fashioned fistfights -- a staple of 1960s adventure series).  It was a show with some nuances.  Early on, for instance, they introduced alien characters who weren't totally in line with their leaders' invasion plans.  In fact, one of my favorite episodes is ""The Life Seekers"" toward the end of Season Two.  In that one you have an alien leader who goes rogue and is planning, along with his beautiful alien companion played by Diana Muldaur, to return to the home world to try to convince his people (with the help of powerful political contacts) to spare the earth.  He tells Vincent at one point, ""It would be a crime against creation to extinguish the human brain"" ... or something like that!  Don't you just love it?  Here's an alien who's come to appreciate our culture, our music, our poetry, our thinking, our accomplishments, and our potential as a species.  We're not the monolithic bunch of total savages that the home planet was led to believe!  Nor, apparently, are the invaders a monolithic bunch of emotionless, murderous survivors.  But I digress.

Technically, even though this isn't a Blu Ray treatment, just your standard DVD, I found the picture and sound quality to be every bit as good as (and sometimes even better than) the original broadcasts.  In fact, it's been a real treat for me to watch in that regard, because the old tube-type Magnavox color TV we got in '67 was broken down half the time!  My brother (an electrical engineer) says it's because the heat in the wood casing would build up tremendously and fry tubes and circuits on a regular basis -- faster than our middle-middle class budget could keep up with!  So, I've had a lot of fun watching The Invaders ... In COLOR!

If you like science fiction that makes you think and even has a social conscience (there was, in fact, an episode that dealt with race relations -- with some awesome guest stars), then I'd highly recommend The Invaders.  My only regret, now that I've ingested the whole series in several big gulps, is that the network didn't try to stretch it out another season or two.  I think they really could have done something with that friendly alien thing.  They could have even done a story arc where David is taken to the aliens' home world in their home galaxy.  We all could have seen a little better what made them tick, and what they were up against, and why, with ""10 million habitable worlds"" at their disposal, they chose to pick on us!

Their destination:  The Earth!  Their purpose:  To make it THEIR world!

3644360,3,B001HUHBBS,"The Invaders was the first TV program that made UFO's not only a reality but also a sinister sub rosa part of the political landscape.  Written during the height of the Cold War, the Invaders clearly played on that innate fear we had to the unknown, whether it be nuclear war, UFO's or the 'Reds'.
The series had an architect[David Vincent, played by Roy Thinnes], knowing too much about flying saucers.  He is going to tell the entire world the 'truth' about UFO's, if he has the chance(of course).  He is almost silenced (the big sleep) in every episode, where the Invaders (i.e. agents of the UFO's or their accomplices) try and use a sinister device to simulate some 'innocent' health event that would take care of him.  Unlike 'Kenny'[from South Park], 'The Invaders' David Vincent survives for another day.
The running gag concerned the Ford Station wagons.  Ford sponsored the Invaders and had a tie-in with the cars that were portrayed on the show.  Well, in most episodes, Vincent rented a Ford station wagon but didn't return it as it was destroyed in a car chase running from the Invaders' agents...",1412208000,,1110,4.755208333333333

This show had great writing, lots of tension, paranoia, and a list of appearances by young actors just starting out in the industry.  Sure, the premise of a secret alien invasion burrowing itself into the fabric of society was far fetched but it was novel at the time and fun to be engaged in.  Roy Thinnes did a good job portraying a frustrated man on a crusade, although as I was watching the series it seemed the writers were toying with the character a bit too much, and they seemed to avoid that in the second season.  Also, love seeing how things looked back then: the cars, clothes, hairstyles.  Actually downright humorous at times from this vantage point.

The musical score in the first season was more dramatic than the second, making some of the scenes creepier.  Granted, the second season had to move on beyond the first season, changes were made and who's to say if they were good or bad.  It's a great shame there wasn't a third season, that would have given the show proper closure.",1402790400,4,1169,4.5285714285714285

Cheap cardboard, and after a few months, the package ink had come off, and had fused itself to my DVD's completely ruining the discs.  So now, I find out that this series has FINALLY come out in the USA, in much safer Plastic Cases.  Hopefully, I won't have to buy this set yet again.

3644385,3,B001HUHBBS,"Quinn Martin (Irwin Martin Cohn) is still a name to strike awe in any television producer when it comes to creating successful shows. His record of success is, I believe, still unmatched, although the technical aspects of the medium have moved far beyond the capabilities of his era. The reason why one can  still watch with more pleasure than one would imagine is that the emphasis, by necessity, had to be on the story and on building characters people would want to see weekly. The limitations, in terms of what we expect today from an action show, are immediately apparent and striking. I should think most young people would be repelled by the absence of what they see daily on their television screens, computers and computer games, movies and all the devices that create the incredible (by comparison with what was available in 1967) media world. To those, for whom the sixties were almost universally owned by the three networks, and restrained by rigid censorship and the problems of the first days of color, it possesses the helping hand of nostalgia.
I wouldn't know what to recommend to the average (and younger) member of the television audience with regard to this show. To the, let us say, mature folk, it may also seem over-simplistic in style, story and acting, but I would guess that some, at least, will find the flavor of this show to be to their taste, at least for occasional viewing.",1378771200,2,1406,4.762295081967213

When watching The Invaders during the original broadcasts, I remember liking the conceptual framework of the series but eventually losing interest in it. Looking back at it from the vantage point of over 40 years, there is a flatness and sameness to it, at least in the early going. Part of that flatness, I suspect, comes from it being a Quinn Martin production -- The Fugitive, the FBI and Twelve O'Clock High to me shared the same subdued sense, even during the height of the action. Still, I remain fond of The Invaders, and it's hard not to think how the series might have evolved had it had the opportunity to go beyond the second season, when Thinnes' character of David Vincent found himself joined by other believers.

It is a very believable story,not like those science fiction series from today.
The main actor,Roy Thinness is excellent in the role of Architect David Vincent.
It takes David Vincent 43 episodes over two years to convince the public that The Invaders are here to conquer the Earth.
I love the way they die.
They fall to the ground surrounded by a red glow and then just simply disintegrate.
When they kill an earthling,they make it look like a heart attack.
They place a device on the back of the neck and an autopsy shows that the person died from a Coronary Occlusion.
I highly recommend this TV series to anyone who enjoys watching sci-fi movies.
Don't just buy one season,you must buy both seasons together to appreciate it in its entirety.
The Amazon service is also nothing short of amazing. (pun intended).
The communication from Amazon is without doubt the best I have received from any Internet website.
The very best of viewing to all.

Ed Ashner as an alien?
i kept looking for Mary Tyler Moore to show up. Klatu shows up in one show,or at least the guy who played him, didn't see Gort though.

3644413,4,B001HUHBBS,"These space aliens need to find a new planet; their home world is dying, and for all their advanced technology, they are unable to stop it.  Their planet is probably similar to Earth in size and climate; their star a little brighter.  Unfortunately, their atmosphere must be unique; apparently there are no similar planets in their own galaxy.

Luckily, their saucers are incredibly fast - so fast that they can easily flit across hundreds of thousands of light years, plying the space between the galaxies.  In surveying the nearby Milky Way galaxy, they discovered a marginal planet, but time was running out; no time to search for another.  The planet had two problems: it was inhabited; its atmosphere toxic.

The problem gas was oxygen; unprotected, their alien bodies rapidly oxidize in a crimson flash.  Fortunately they have the technology to morph the exterior of their bodies into replicas of the native life.  The trouble is, it doesn't last and their exterior must be periodically regenerated or they die.  They needed a long term solution.

There were two possible solutions to the oxygen problem: either treat their alien bodies chemically so they could tolerate the oxygen or chemically remove the oxygen from the atmosphere.  The second solution would have the added benefit of doing away with Earth's infestation of human beings . . . .

If you are the human named David Vincent you are living a nightmare.  You have seen their saucers; you have seen them.  Some seem friendly but you quickly learn that they will kill humans with no more compunction than that shown for swatting a fly.  You try warning your fellow humans of their invasion plans but no one believes you! . . . . Wake up!  Wake up!

Other reviews have successfully described the contents of this excellent series in full so there's little purpose in repeating such adulation. This review rather concentrates on what it is that fundamentally attracts.

The Invaders is in some ways the flip side of its predecessor The Fugitive except that our hero is the pursuer in this series, not the pursued. Its basically a series about 'paranoia', the fear of what is lurking in the shadows but cant be or is rarely seen. Its the monster under the bed, the Nazi threat during and before WW2, the Communist fear in the Cold War, the fundamentalist terrorist organisation in today's world. Its about fear for our personal safety and safety of the societal structure in which we live.

And just as our determined and resilient hero, David Vincent, who is constantly maintaining the vigil on our behalf to fight these nefarious foes, is unable to hold onto sufficient proof that the Alien is amongst us, we also rarely can hold onto proof of our fears and that the monster is trully waiting for us under the bed, lurking, plotting.

The Invaders fed into this paranoia better than virtually any other TV series. Perhaps some episodes of Outer Limits and the Twilight Zone compared. X-Files gave it a good shake. This is Alien and Jaws combined, but more subtly, without the splashy effects, just the lingering implications to haunt your imagination. And then there is that fear that the alien looks like us and could be anywhere..no one can be trusted.

The first season was magic with our lone hero thwarting the Alien's designs. His efforts were usually alone or with an occasional doubting ally awakening to the threat of global domination, often with no more than a mutated 'pinky' to justify the threat. The second season was still very good but lost a little because suddenly our hero had others who supported his belief of the monster under the bed and the threat of handling the danger alone with his and our fears was in some ways lost.

The writers and producers focussed most successfully in creating a well paced, well scripted series that maintained its ongoing sense of foreboding, not cheap fast scary thrills but a constantly growing fear of an approaching doom. The music successfully maintained the mood as did the acting of Thinnes and support cast. Stand back and you get a laugh out of the whole concept but while watching this gem, you easily get caught up in the paranoia and trepidation of what is fundamentally a basic fear in us all...the fear and threat of the unknown.",1287014400,7,2718,5.042316258351893
3644419,5,B001HUHBBS,"Back in the merry old 1960s, before cable, before color television for most of us, I had seen lunchboxes featuring Roy Thinnes and a spaceship.  I never had a chance to watch the episodes -- I was a tender young munchkin and probably unable to handle the weighty subject matter (for its time).  And yet, the story still carries a power to entrance and entertain.  Sure, it was the 1960s and not up-to-date with the 21st century -- but this was excellent television writing!  Excellent acting.  After all, do we watch drama for the drama or for how many exploding barrels of gasoline they can stick in a visual?  (Power Rangers -- ack!)  For the serious audience, to be sure.  Thank you Roy Thinnes for a rock-solid portrayal of David Vincent and his quest to spoil the Invaders!",1278288000,5,778,4.586956521739131

They are exciting, have great guest stars and leave you on the edge of your seat. Qwinn-Martin does a great job.
I was presently surprised to see Roy Thinnes do the intro's from 2008. I am really glad I bought this and would recommend the series to anyone especially if they like ABC's ""V"".",1274486400,2,344,4.390625

3644422,5,B001HUHBBS,"I watched the Invaders religiously every Wednesday evening growing up in France in the early seventies. What a thrill to be able to see the full series again forty years later.

3644424,4,B001HUHBBS,"The Invaders was a novel and extremely different format for the then TV programmers to authorize and I was amazed they allowed a full two seasons.  Like Star Trek, it was so very different from the usual shoot-em-up western of the era.",1264291200,,235,4.595238095238095
3644425,4,B001HUHBBS,"The 42 one-hour episodes of the science fiction series ""The Invaders"" were originally broadcast on ABC from 1967-1968. That might seem like just one season but the series was a mid-season replacement, which premiered in January 1967. The season one DVD set includes only the 16 episodes produced to fill out the remainder of ABC's 1966-67 broadcast season.

Like ""The Prisoner"" which also premiered in 1967, ""The Invaders"" has become a mega cult hit over the years and this DVD package is greatly anticipated. The series has its roots in 1950's paranoia science fiction, specifically those films (""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", ""It Came From Outer Space"", ""Invasion From Mars"") that were surrogates for the anti-Communist hysteria that swept the country during the early Eisenhower era.

""The Invaders"" took up the old theme of finding the enemy in our midst and was a worthy successor to the classic anti-Communist series ""I Led Three Lives"" (1953-1956). But the anti-Red phobia was no longer a draw by 1967 so the series confined itself to aliens from outer space and drew few parallels to those folks from behind the Iron Curtain. It did exploit the growing distrust of American business and government leaders by showing alien infiltration of these sectors.

Ray Thinnes plays architect David Vincent who stumbles across a spacecraft of disembarking aliens one night. They are from a dying planet and have come to colonize the earth. Their strategy is to infiltrate society by taking the form of humans, but like the robots of ""Westworld"" they have a little problem with their hands (or in this case with a bent pinky finger). They also have no heartbeat as a consequence of having no heart. And when they die their bodies rapidly evaporate, leaving no trace for Vincent to prove his claims to the authorities.

Vincent becomes a latter day Paul Revere, riding around trying to spread the alarm to a citizenry that dismiss him as a nut case. He is never able to bring physical proof of his claims to anyone important. The aliens do not kill him because his death might make his story more believable so they monitor his activities and do their best to thwart his various schemes.

Each episode was structured as a four-act play with commercial breaks between acts and an epilogue. Quinn Martin regular William Conrad provided a narration. Conrad also did narration for ""The Fugitive"". During its run ""The Invaders"" became more and more like ""The Fugitive"" because the original concept offered the writers no where else to go. There were only so many ways Vincent could fail to warn people of the aliens and should he successfully convince the world of the invasion the series would end. So like Richard Kimble he becomes a man on the run who episodically meets up with new people each week. This takes away from the original idea of an alien invasion.

The acting is generally first rate and the music lively and distinctive. Production design is standard Quinn Martin, the occasional sci-fi devices are meant to be taken seriously and are not the self-parody stuff of 1960's sci-fi series like ""Lost In Space"" and ""The Time Tunnel"".

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1263686400,6,3187,4.87985212569316
3644426,5,B001HUHBBS,"I concur with the other high reviewers. It was a great series and a collector's dream come through. Roy Thinnes is at his paranoid acting best. It was a real treat to have him do intros and antidotes about each show. Yes.. the props and special effects were pretty cheesy in those days (look at the original Star Trek for comparison) but non of that detracts from the A+ acting, story lines or that wonderfully eerie intro theme (makes a neat ring tone). Overall, a great addition to anyone's Sci-Fi classics collection.",1256515200,4,520,4.663043478260869

I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent picture quality of these DVDs. The packaging and the arrangement of the DVDs is satisfactory.

3644428,3,B001HUHBBS,"A barely serious drama of the ultimate peek-a-boo! Invaders really teaches to explore attentively those who around you to find their motives and objectives and not get in their way. There is hunting, chasing, detective work, combat and all else that makes for excitement. The plot is just a bit weak. Still worth getting.",1247097600,2,321,4.962962962962963
3644429,5,B001HUHBBS,"While this late '60s sci-fi series had low production values, it more than made up for it with good acting and scripting. The Invaders is clearly a predecessor of the X-Files alien invasion story arc. (Did someone try to warn the public in the late sixties about something that may have already been going on at the time?) The X-Files' extraordinary popularity grabbed the collective imagination and has been translated in 18 languages. Maybe the general public was not so open-minded in the sixties, when The Invaders was first broadcasted. At long last available on DVD, The Invaders can give X-Files fans an idea of what an alien invasion was like on TV, forty years ago. It does not compare visually with the X-Files, but the acting is efficient and the general mood is equally dark. (Speaking of dark, bring 'Dark Skies' to DVD soon!)",1246752000,6,839,4.793103448275862

3644431,5,B001HUHBBS,"Unless you're planning to go to Europe, you'll probably never get to see this series in syndication. If you see this DVD set at a good price, grab it. Roy Thinnes plays David Vincent - an architect who lost his way while driving late at night and wound up at a deserted diner. Suddenly he sees an alien ship land and tries to convince a disbelieving world that the invaders are here, have taken human form and are walking among us. The aliens discover that Vincent knows about them and either try to eliminate him or discredit his story by making him look like a crackpot. In the final season he does manage to find others who believe him and share his cause to stop the invaders from taking over Earth. This series is a must for any serious sci-fi fan.",1241481600,33,753,4.347517730496454

8309663,5,B001HUHBBS,"Just excellent.  Bought this recently, and of course my first viewing was when I was 13 years old.  My wife (who had never heard of the show), was stunned by the great story lines, creative writing, and action.  For me, its like watching them for the first time, its just been so long.

Were 1/2 way thru the 1st season and are thoroughly pleased and often impressed, to say the least.

Every shows intro is the same, citing a highlight from the first episode, where ARCHITECT David Vincent witnessed the landing of a craft, from another world.  One thing I keep telling my wife, is that chasing THE INVADERS is ALL HE EVER DOES.  Ive never seen him do any architectural work; and, my other question: Just where the heck does he (David Vincent) get all his travel money. (Must have saved every cent before that fateful night.).

If you prefer superior, modern special effects over truly imaginative writing, a variety of excellent actors, and very good action directing, then do not purchase this.  Its not for you, nor should it be.

For others, its a real treat.

8309668,4,B001HUHBBS,"I remember staying up 'late' as a teen to catch David Vincent's relentless battle against 'The Invaders'. What was such a suprise is how well the series holds up over four decades later.
The visuals - by the Howard Anderson effects team - are remarkable for the time and budget constraints. The score is memorable, utilizing some of the 'Outer Limits' themes.
 Best of all is a palatable sense of paranoia and dread. Overall, the series is a real bummer as it seems Vincent's pleas and actions only make a dent in the relentless growth of the Aliens.
The DVD quality is excellent and Roy Thines intros are effective.
Overall, a great purchase for any period sci-fi library, and a series as effective as ' Invasion of the Body Snatchers'.",1496620800,,737,4.6692307692307695
