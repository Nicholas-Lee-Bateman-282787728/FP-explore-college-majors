2554556,5,B000F8DB94,"This is a FUN DVD. The scenery and setting is so gorgeous and its filmed in an atypical way thats really cutting edge! THIS IS A HOT HOT DVD. You need this one for your collection. Shiva reminds us to BREAK out of the mold, yes even in yoga.... and to have fun... and that life is about movement. Her best DVD YET hands down!!",1147392000,7,326,4.030769230769231
2554557,5,B000F8DB94,"This is another one given in the yoga matrix style.  I have only done the ""prana yoga only"" option so far, and I loved it.  It is a lot like the prana section in Yoga Shakti, but 41 minutes long.  You do stuff like go into cobra doing figure eights with your chest, in cat do circles with your chest, in bridge do free-form movements with your hips and hands. (There is a lot more, but it is hard to explain adequately.)  You are told to explore and do what feels good. It makes me happy, like a kindergardener doing modern dance.  I have no doubt that it will help me to avoid injury during traditional yoga practices, as well as get some different kinds of muscle tone.

The dance part I have only watched so far.  I don't know much about traditional ""trance dance"", so I can't critique the reiewer who said this didn't work well on a DVD. But I can say that as an avid dancer, who cares? You may not hit a true ""trance"" state, but I love the idea of dancing around, pretending to play the drums that are all around you.  (There is other imagery in the variety of dance meditations she presents).  This DVD is a perfect way to get into dance for those who are shy, because you learn that dancing is about how you feel.

Anyway, I am super happy I bought this DVD. It is different, but that is what makes it good. I am officially a Shiva Rea groupie.  Her style is great (as it was in Yoga Shakti): soothing, smart, present, not overdone.

BTW, per her website, this is only one of the three videos she is coming out with in upcoming months.  Another will be more traditional yoga, like Yoga Shakti, and the other about the mental and other aspects of yoga.",1147305600,79,1658,4.2253968253968255
2554558,5,B000F8DB94,"I wasn't sure about buying this DVD because of the dance part but after I saw the previews on the web I pre-ordered it right away, it just looked too good. Everything about this DVD is stunning : the music , the cinematography ,the location (white sands), Shiva's Instruction and much more.
If you like the prana yoga segment on ""Yoga Shakti"" then you will probably like this too because except the free form dance segments there are also prana yoga segments which are absolutely fun and creative, she makes traditional yoga poses more dancey and fluid so you never really hold a pose ,you move through it , so it's good for the days you don't feel like holding poses or do a rigid yoga practice. Even though I don't usually feel comfortable dancing in front of the TV (or at all) ,Shiva has a way of just grabbing you into it plus the amazing music gets you in the mood. The DVD has 6 preprogrammed practices ranging from 29 minutes to 41 minutes being the longest , most of the practices are mixes of free form dance, prana yoga and movement meditation but there's also a ""prana yoga only"" practice and a ""trance dance only"" practice. The ""Yoga Matrix"" lets you choose from 15 segments that you can play the order you want.
If you want a different way of practicing yoga , this is it!
I can't wait for her next DVD's to be released.",1147219200,17,1334,4.383064516129032
2554559,4,B000F8DB94,"In Indian stories, Shiva Nataraj is the Cosmic Dancer and the original Yogi.  In Shiva Rea's Yoga Trance Dance, the two rivers of yoga and dance reunite in combination of Yoga asana and pranayama as a preparation to enter into spontaneous dance and movement.  In live Trance Dance events, the leader leads dancers through breath and movement (prana yoga activation) into ecstatic dance (movement meditation) and then into meditation and relaxation.

In this DVD, Shiva works to capture some of the magic of these events.  Filmed in White Sands National Park, the visual impact is amazing, an further evolution of the Yoga Shakti series (also by Shiva Rea).  The DVD is comprised of 17 mini-sequences, and the Yoga Matrix allows you to combine them into sequence, or you can use a preset sequence.  The soundtrack is made of some previously released tracks and some newly written ones, including music from Dum Dum Project, Drala, and KDZ.  You can watch each sequence with or without Shiva's instruction.

As a product, the DVD is certainly a great representation of the potential of Yoga Trance dance; however, it is difficult to represent the energy of a trance dance in a pre-planned format such as a DVD.  For those who want to experience the energy of trance dance, this DVD is an amazing introduction: visually arresting, sonically charged, and undeniably powerful.  Shiva's instruction is beautiful (and classically her), and the dancers are wonderfully real.

This DVD is a true joy to watch, and a wonderful way to experience the joy of Yoga and Dance.  Bom Bom Shankara!",1147132800,40,1580,4.965779467680608
2554560,1,B000F8DB94,"I brought this DVD years ago and I did enjoy it but after giving my life to the Lord I threw this in the garbage along with all my Yoga videos, and no there is no such thing as Christian Yoga (if your looking for a way around it) These are demonic moves praising other Gods. If you believe in the one true Living God and Jesus Christ is your savior stop participating in these Yoga practices.

There is a way that seems right but in the end leads to death.",1444089600,,456,4.010989010989011

It's kind of hard to do the yoga just by listening to her and if I look at the screen I feel she is too far away to really see what she is doing. I guess I need more practice with this style of yoga. I was hoping it was all kundalini yoga with additional dance segments. I still can't figure out how to do the movement while in downward dog. I like the dance sections but sometimes feel a little lost and don't feel I am getting a very good workout from it. It is very relaxing otherwise and will be a workout to do as a cool down or just on a ""day off"" workout day.",1406246400,,669,3.7857142857142856

2554572,2,B000F8DB94,"I saw this advertised at the beginning of a Bollywood dance video and from the clips of it, it looked pretty cool. But no, it is super hippy-dippy. One segment was trance drumming or something. This is not a video where they do a move and teach you how. No, there's just a big group of people dancing around like maniacs, and you're just supposed to dance around like an idiot in your living room?

Another segment is just twisting your torso from the waist up, with your hands on your shoulders. She just keeps getting faster and faster and it looks like a sure recipe to really hurt your back.

I guess I should have inferred what this was going to be like from the name ""Yoga Trance Dance, "" but it did look cool in the ad. I would definitely not recommend this.",1381795200,4,765,4.268965517241379

2554574,5,B000F8DB94,"I love Shiva Rea's matrix-style yoga programs, so I purchased this disk for my sister in-law, who is a yoga teacher.  My sister in-law teaches Ariel, Acrobatic and partner yoga, so she loves anything that is different.  She LOVES this disk and raves about how much she enjoys the instruction, the music and the moves.",1364601600,,317,4.745454545454545
2554575,5,B000F8DB94,"I thought about purchasing this DVD for awhile before I bought it - now I could kick myself for not buying it sooner!!! For those familiar with Shiva Rea DVDs, Yoga Trance Dance has the yoga matrix, as well as pre-set practices. There is a practice for beginners, as well as solar & lunar practices.

I can't give this DVD enough accolades! I first tried the solar flows & was instantly hooked! I've since tried all of the practices on this DVD & found Tandava Kriya & Liberation Dance to be my favorites. I've integrated this DVD into my practice by doing approx. 20 minutes of Trance Dance to get my hear rate up before moving on to other Shiva Rea DVDs like MOre Daily Energy, Fluid Power or Yoga Shakti for another 20-30 minutes of practice.

For me, dancing is so liberating & is a true expression of my soul - if you love to dance & love yoga, this DVD is definitely for you!",1359072000,,881,4.301204819277109
2554576,5,B000F8DB94,"These practices really wake me up in the morning, and help me to feel energized and enlivened. They are a great mix of yoga, dance, and creative movement.

I feel better when I do than when I don't and that is what I feel the point of the whole DVD is. If this is why you move, this is what I recommend. And I recommend moving for this reason.",1343174400,2,358,3.5443037974683542

2554580,4,B000F8DB94,"I LOVE doing this DVD, it is very freeing and fluid. Please do watch the trailer though, as I'm not sure I would categorize this as either yoga or trance dance, so the name may throw you off. It does draw on both traditions, however. It draws on kundalini yoga, and incorporates pranayana (breathing) techniques and flow movements designed to awaken the shakti, or feminine kundalini energy. All of the yoga segments incorporate spirals and circular, fluid motions. The dance sequences do as well, with a special emphasis on the hips, and twisting motions. The music is somewhat trance-like, although I think of trance music as being rave oriented, and this is not as 'hard' as that. It is rhythmic with an Indian flair, and lots of drumming. It is repetitive and not very melodic, so if you don't like that you may get tired of it. The dancing segments are free-form, with a general guideline as to what kind of movement to build upon.

The DVD is organized with two different ways you can utilize it. There are pre-organized routines that are each composed of different segments put together around a theme. Some are more dance oriented and some are more yoga oriented, and some are more rigorous while others are more relaxing. Or if you prefer, you can compose your own routine composed of individual segments.

I enjoy this DVD a lot, but I do have three reasons for not giving it five stars. The first I have already mentioned - I think the name is a bit misleading. The second is that this DVD is not for those with limited movement - in almost all of the segments you do need to be able to get up and off the floor easily, and be very comfortable with your body. The final reason is that ALL of the dancers have yoga-magazine-worthy thin, muscular bodies - I really would have appreciated some other body types, particularly since this DVD is very oriented around feminine energy. How about some curves and voluptuousness?? At least a little bootie? Something to make the rest of us feel included, and not reinforcing the body images we are confronted with all the time in the media...",1324166400,12,2093,4.623655913978495

her philosophy of individual creative movement

2554583,2,B000F8DB94,"I saw a trailer for this on my Bollywood workout dvd, and thought it would be OK. I have a number of injuries that have left me with limited movement. The trailer showed very gentle movements from a standing position. But right from the beginning, you must be able to go straight down to the ground or mat - gracefully - and there is no slow working up to it. Many years ago, i watched and worked out with Richard Hittleman's PBS yoga show, and he emphasized working up to things slowly. None of that here. So I will find someone to give it to. If you are looking for an exercise video that allows you to go slowly - this is probably not for you.",1299110400,6,646,4.134920634920635
2554584,5,B000F8DB94,"I have to admit when I first got this dvd I was so sure about it. Being brand new to yoga I felt overwhelmed by all the freedom Shiva encouraged, frankly I just I didn't know what to do with my self at times. So if you are heart-set on a yoga practice that will tell you very illicitly what to do, this is not the dvd you want. If you want to have fun and/or ignite your creativity look no farther. Also prepare to go into watching for the first time with a very open mind. The music is different from what we usually hear everyday but I think it's beautiful. I must say though, a few of her comments such as, ""Open your pallet like the Taj Mahal"" threw me in to a fit of giggles that was so serve I had to forfeit that whole workout! You get accustomed to those remarks though and are left with a great workout that leaves you feeling renewed, rejuvenated, stretched, and de-stressed. Also if you ever suffer a sore, tight back the nine minute prana yoga for the spine segment is easily worth the cost the whole video.",1298505600,5,1019,4.151515151515151
2554585,3,B000F8DB94,"I just couldn't really follow Shiva's instruction that well.  She kind of just assumes you know what you are doing.  Also the ""trance"" dance part of the DVD kind of hurt my neck.  Overall, the production is beautiful and the music is cool, but just not my go-to DVD.  I will probably keep trying it to see if it gets better with practice, but the first few times I lost interest and felt lost!  Note: I do yoga regularly and dance, so it was surprising that I would find this DVD hard to follow!",1286236800,,495,4.223404255319149
2554586,5,B000F8DB94,"I was hesitant to purchase this DVD at first, but after reading the reviews decided to give it a chance.  I'm glad I did.  I really enjoyed the Dance as a chance to let go and enjoy.

I was also surprised that there is more yoga on the DVD than I thought there would be. The yoga is a very fluid style, so if you are not open to this style, you may not like it.  But for me, I thought it mimics real life motion, is awesome for the hips and spine, and very relaxing.  As mentioned by other reviewers, there are six preset options and you can also select your own blend from the matrix.  The Prana Yoga Only preset is 41 minutes long and includes 5 very fluid yoga flows.  Although there is a yoga flow specifically for the spine and another for the hips, all of the yoga flows would be helpful for both. The hip flow is one of the more challenging flows and she does warn to be careful about the knees (it is the only yoga flow I have not completed due to past knee problems).

All in all I think this is a wonderful DVD, and something so different as well.",1277942400,4,1057,4.023923444976076

2554589,5,B000F8DB94,"Yoga, to me, is about movement and feeling energy in my body.  Shiva Rea's Trance Dance DVD is perfect for this.

This DVD has 6 pre-set practices:

-Intro: Basic Trance Dance Flow (29 min)
-Intro: Adventurous (28 min)
-Prana Yoga Only (41 min)
-Trance Dance Only (32 min)
-Energizing Flow (31 min)
-Meditation Flow (38 min).

There is also a matrix feature, so you can create your own workout.

Once I got over my self-consciousness about moving free-form around my workout room, I really enjoyed this workout. The workouts aren't too taxing, so they're perfect for those days when my energy is running low, but I want a little energy lift.

The scenery at White Sands National Park, New Mexico, is spectacular.  I feel relaxed just looking at it!

Shiva doesn't give a lot of instruction during the dance portions, she encourages you to move freely and listen to your body.  During the yoga portions, Shiva gives good instructions on form.

I would categorize this DVD as more of a free-form dance than of yoga.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone wanting a relaxing, yet energizing practice that is not a typical yoga DVD.",1269388800,5,1134,4.73469387755102

i got this today in the mail and i just finished the beginners section on this i had to do the review before my shower-
i had such a great time with both the yoga and the free dance that i will be looking forward to doing this again- probably this week i had that much fun i now understand why the others reviews were so very pleased with this and Shiva. i love the free thinking free moving segments. i love the positive energy i have right now= i love the calming zen interactive beginning and ending moving meditations-especially the end which gives a reason to use my yoga eye pillow that has sat gathering dust for a year.
also i love the fact it has harder and different segments for me later on.  in general. FUN FUN FUN. the dance part- it reminded me of dance class free form where you could just lose yourself in the music no wrong dance here.

This dvd is a great introduction to prana yoga and trance dance - especially for those of us who are too self conscious to move like this in a class. There is just the right amount of instruction balanced with opportunity to do whatever your body wants to do. The music is energizing and the scenery is interesting as well. The matrix format allows for a customizable workout and limitless combinations so you don't get bored. I'd definitely recommend this for anyone who is open to or already loves experimenting with yoga, dance, and movement.",1264118400,,686,4.725

Thankfully, I'm so glad I didn't take my doubts too seriously and went for it. This is absolutely my favorite DVD from Shiva Rea!! For those looking for a traditional yoga practice, you will be disappointed; however, those who keep an open mind and trust in Shiva will enjoy this DVD immensely.

It contains 3 opening movement meditations, 3 sun salutations, 3 krias, 3 free form dance segments, 3 prana yoga segments, and lest we forget, shavasana. Essentially, this DVD mixes prana yoga, similar to what's featured on Yoga Shakti, and free form dance.

The DVD includes the yoga matrix and some bonus material. You feel ridiculous at first doing the free form dance routines. But once you learn to let go and not care anymore, it truly becomes a fun and liberating experience. You'll definitely build up a great sweat after doing this cardio workout. The scenery and music are just awesome - even when you hear it the first time, you will be compelled to dance, dance, dance!

You can choose your own work-out with the Matrix feature and meditations. Every work-out sequence is designed to help your body move outside of its normal patterns which stimulate your mind to let go and feel vibrant again. Right in the middle of the work-outs your spirit will sing out Om-Shanti-Om! Shiva REa Rocks and you will never look at Yoga or Dance the same way again--get ready to transform everything.

But, I'm really glad that I tried this DVD anyway.  I love the DVD and the scenery, and sometimes letting go is exactly what I need.  Plus, I love the matrix option, and I can workout for as long or as short as I want, or I can do a high intensive or low intensive routine.
I can only do this DVD when I'm alone, though.  I'd feel pretty self-conscious with anyone watching me...they might think that I was having an episode (:",1222387200,,590,4.0085470085470085

I was lucky enough to practice Trance Dance live with Shiva Rea about 5 years ago and this DVD brings me right back to that wonderful experience I had! Sometimes it's ok to LET GO in a yoga class.

2554602,5,B000F8DB94,"If you are middle aged, overweight and out of shape like I am, you'll find some of the yoga poses difficult. Shiva moves through them fairly quickly so they can be hard to follow.  The faster movement segments that are part yoga and part dance are much easier for me because they are a small part pose and a large part freeform. And they are aerobic without being hard on the knees. So I enjoy this video but alternate it with other videos of slower, more traditional yoga sequences. (I like Big Yoga and Yoga for the Rest of Us.)
The music is great, with some traditional Indian music for the slower parts. The Indian music was at times a little too loud making it hard to hear her voice. The rest is rhythmic, infectious and perfect for the dance parts. The segments are each about 30 minutes and it's easy to get a good workout in that space of time.",1200182400,4,853,4.298136645962733
2554603,3,B000F8DB94,"In this well-produced DVD, Shiva Rea guides the viewer from early warmup vinyasa-like exercises towards ever more trancy, chaotic release movements. I can understand why a DVD like this was bound to be produced by somebody;  someone somewhere who enjoys both yoga and trance dancing would try combining the two... and in this case it turns out to be (appropriately named) Shiva. However, I have mixed feelings about this DVD, and the approach itself.

The DVD is set in a sand dune desert, with a group of well-muscled good-looking young people following proscribed exercises.  Unfortunately, the yoga-like dynamic postures in the beginning of the DVD were way too brief. While I like dynamic ""flow""-like movements, I like to get into them - giving the body time to ""get it""; instead, Rea transitions from one movement to the next without giving the viewer a real chance to enjoy what is going on.

A more serious concern is that this DVD, at least in my mind, negates the very essence of trance dancing. Trance (especially hard core styles such as goa trance) is about letting go, about allowing the  (personal and group) energy to take over. It is about surrendering to the ecstasy of the body in its connection to the transcendent. In contrast, the DVD is composed of 5 minute segments that jerk you out of the trance just as you were about to enter it. Programmatic, lecture-style approach to trance dancing as featured in this DVD may in fact represent the very antithesis of trance. Consistent with this, the 'demonstrators' in the DVD appeared to be much more concerned with looking good than with enjoying the dance.

This is not a bad DVD. Rather, imo, it is kind of missing the point. In other words, when doing yoga, do yoga. When trance dancing, allow the dance to take over without any regard for form, time, place or skill.",1199145600,17,1837,4.761006289308176

2554605,5,B000F8DB94,"When I first started to watch this DVD, it seemed really strange.  The thought of just dancing around, without instruction, moving from your spirit seemed alien to me.  But when I started to actually do the DVD, after a few minutes, it was absolutely freeing.  More so when I did not try to mimic the people on the tv screen.  I didn't know my body could even move the way it was.  Although this is not something I would do in public, because I'm sure I look ridiculous, it is very cathartic in my own home.  The prana yoga sections are also both challenging and liberating.  For days after the trance dance sections, I found myself moving to a silent beat even at my desk at work.  I have been doing traditional yoga for about a year now and will continue to do so, but this DVD gives me the opportunity to express myself in other ways.  The music is amazing as well.",1188777600,8,868,4.276073619631902

It is a great stress relief, without getting all sweaty.  I feel so free after using this DVD.  I didn't know that would happen, but it makes me feel lighter in my spirit and soul.

Basically very stiff..BUT, I have found that this is nice because it is more dancerly than a traditional basic yoga class & I like that it has flowing movements to help you bend & be freer in your spine & body...the more I do it the more I love it.  The setting is also beautiful as is Shiva herself...she seems like a kind caring woman....I also bought the new Yoga Vinyasa flow dvd that I also like, but reading the reviews here I think the one to get is the Yoga Shakti if you want a good basic yoga workout.

2554608,5,B000F8DB94,"I ordered this DVD accidentally...when ordering creative core abs.  When it arrived and I watched it, I was somewhat intimidated because, at age 60, I could not imagine myself dancing in such an uninhibited manner.  So this DVD has sat on my shelf for several months.  In the meantime, I was learning Chinese Soaring Crane Qigong and learning how to feel QI move through my body.

This morning I decided to give Trance Dance a try just before giving away the DVD.  I was astounded.  As the drums started beating, something inside me 'broke loose'...something that I have not felt in 40 years!  I began moving in ways that I never thought I could!  I felt my hips undulate with an intensity I would not have believed possible...and I wasn't following Shiva Rea's moves!  I was doing this with my eyes closed just listening to the music!

Because I have moderately severe pulmonary fibrosis, I checked my HR several times.  It never went above 100 yet I was hot, perspiring, and enjoying every minute! After 15 minutes, I was too relaxed to continue!  I will now use it as my warm-up for strength yoga..when I want to have internal heat!

If this old body can move so freely, what can a young body do with this music.  I had forgotten how fun it is to move so fluidly!",1180224000,124,1266,4.495614035087719

You can do the dance sequences as much or as little as you like. And there is a (beautiful) fire thrower! What more can you ask for? Enjoy.",1177200000,4,492,4.666666666666667

If you seek a less structured work-out, this DVD has parts you will love while still offering many structured yoga work outs also on YOGA SHAKTI.

If you don't own any of Shiva's DVD, buy YOGA SHAKTI first.  This one will build on your skills and add dimension to your practice.",1176422400,2,488,4.511363636363637
2554611,4,B000F8DB94,"This yoga dvd is unique.  If you are looking for something different, something to change your perspective, or something to free your body, this is a good choice.

Who is it good for?  I have been doing yoga for 5 years now, mostly practicing by dvd or audio instruction and I didn't find it to be too difficult. I also love dancing.  You certainly do not need to have any dance experience to be able to handle this dvd. As far as yoga goes, I imagine it would be fine for beginners who have some experience with yoga, just because it could make you more comfortable with the movements.  However, the movements shouldn't be impossible for anyone who hasn't done yoga before (in this case I would certainly suggest just watching it before actually doing it).  Advanced practioners may not like it if they are rigid in a specific style or form of yoga. If any person, particularly a yoga practioner, is looking for a different way of doing things this is a good choice. As far as dancing goes- if you don't like dancing at all, I suspect you may get annoyed with this dvd.

Why is this a good choice?  As I said, I have been doing yoga for about five years now and I hit a point where I was feeling unhappy with the rigidity of yoga poses as taught under dvd instruction.  I wanted something that would give me more flow from pose to pose. My body was craving that. When my body was supposed to continue opening, it was locking from the rigidity.  All the movements in this dvd allow your own body to free form release and move, by not always following exactly what the instructor is doing.  At first it feels ackward, especially in the dance sections, but eventually your body releases that tension that usually causes all movements to lock. The ackwardness is because our bodies are continuously being taught to lock and hold positions without actually feeling what our own body requires.  I think it is a good addition to any person's life, but you have to be open minded.  You may feel silly at times if you are not used to dancing.  I suggest you actually just take your eyes off the dvd screen at that point because watching the people dance on the dvd screen will likely make you feel silly.  The point is not to dance like them.  The point is to dance how your body feels you should.  You will feel silly for awile until your body actually releases and then you will see the point.  Let go.  This dvd is about letting go of tension, of all those locking actions that seperate you from the universe.  Let go.  Surrender.  That is what yoga is about and if you understand that, you will understand the freeing movements of this dvd.

Negatives? The filming is sometimes focusing in the wrong place.  I think the filmwork is too fancy at times and it becomes a distraction that makes it difficult to follow what is going on.  I find it difficult to entirely see what movements Shiva is doing at times because of the filming.  As far as instruction goes, when first getting into some of these movements, it is a little difficult to figure out.  It might be nice for Shiva to offer an additional section with tips and instruction on the poses, in order for  people to get the most out of them.

Overall the positives outweigh the negatives and I think it is good for the days you are feeling locked up, lacking energy, have excess tension, or just want to do something different.

If you are rigid, do not like free flowing movements, hate dance, or only like predictible yoga postures, I do not suggest this dvd.  You probably could use it, but you will hate it in the process.",1174953600,11,3579,4.426605504587156
2554612,4,B000F8DB94,"I've done the trance dance part of this dvd only once.  I find it hard to get into it by yourself.  Trance dance is very social sort of like samba or salsa.  You need the energy of people to keep your energy up.  I like the yoga parts of the dvd and the music.  I think that doing free form dance by yourself is difficult unless you already have a repetoire of movement to draw from.  That's why having other people around you is so helpful.  You can then mimic someone else and then add your own movement. Otherwise, you are at a loss for what to do next. Also, the music needs to be quite loud so that it can pusle thru you.  I am very considerate of my spouse and neighbors so I don't turn my TV up very loud (at 6:30AM).  All in all, nice production and great music, but not my favorite Shiva Rea dvd.

I wish it was a bit heavier on the prana yoga, I tend to feel a little unsatisfied in the upper body and abs. But it adds a great cardiovascular dimension to my practice, and even though I practice in a small space, I can really get into it (provided no one is watching). I find that watching the screen during the dance segments brings me into my mind too much, I start analyzing/comparing my movements with the other dancers, which seems to lead me as far from a trance state as possible. On the other hand, when I permit myself, it is really a deep, delicious practice.

There needed to be more instruction, more people diversity and less fancy camerawork.

2554617,4,B000F8DB94,"I am a big fan of Shiva Rea's yoga videos and since I am also a bellydancer, I thought I would try her Yoga Trance Dance DVD.  The first time I tried it, I let go of my inhibitions and actually reached a trance-like ecstatic state.  A second time I did it when I was very stressed out, and I was not able to let go.  So experiences may vary.

The practices usually begin with a prana yoga sequence.  I loved the snakey movements of the Water Salutation.  In fact, my dance troupe may use the ""shoulder rolls into cobra"" as part of our upcoming performance!  Even the prana yoga segments are very dance like.  The kriyas are designed to warm up the body with a repetitive movement and get oneself into a trance-like state.  Finaly, there are some improvisational dance segments.  It works best if you listen to her speaking and the music, but do not look at the television.  It will only limit you if you feel you must move as the dancers on the screen are moving.  Instead, be inspired by the imagery she speaks of, like playing drums that are all over the room, and let yourself loose.  This is definitely something that's fun to do in your own home. That said, I would LOVE to go to a live Shiva Rea class on the beach.

The music on this DVD is awesome.  I would listen to this stuff even if I wasn't working out.  It's mostly a world-beat, but it's very cool.  The DVD is also very beautiful, mostly filmed on a beach. Even the segments between sections are lovely, evoking Indian dance and temples.  Like all Shiva Rea videos, the aestetic value is very high.

Like all Shiva Rea's DVDs, the DVD features several pre-set practices combining trance dance, prana yoga, kriyas and shavasana, or you can create your own practices using the Yoga Matrix.  Usually I will try all the practices, and then start making my own once I understand the proper orderng.  She always includes a pre-set practice for evenings, since most of the practices are energetic and will wake you up.  There is also a set that is all prana yoga.",1168473600,10,2022,4.408108108108108

Yoga and Dance may be a creative mix but somewhat like mixing oil and water - yoga is meant to induce stillness and stretch the body/mind, dance is about movement - shifting from one pose to another itself in yoga should be done with care and with time/attention. Only very experienced dancers or yoga practitioners can just 'let loose' and wiggle body parts in combination with yoga poses thrown in.

Shiva should have put in a warning at least or just made it a dance video, not mixing it like this for users of all experience levels.",1167782400,6,739,4.316546762589928

When I bought this dvd, I assumed that there were going to be instructional dance movements that incorporated yoga into it somehow, and that is not the case.

It would be great if Shiva came out with a kundalini dvd in keeping with her style. The trance dance is the perfect way to totally release and do whatever feels good! I have to completely disagree with the reviewer who said that Shiva was to tight looking! The whole point of of the trance dance is to do it in whatever way you like. You don't have to look like a wet noodle, you can dance as strong or as gentle as you like. She's in great shape and has great definition in her shoulders and arms so they look tight because they are. I also did not feel at all like the people in the video were ""hollywood posers"". They are just good looking people who are in really good shape,isn't that what you want to see in an exercise video? They were dressed in loose flowing type clothes which are totally appropriate for the spirit of the location and style of the dvd.

This film is for spectators and posers, not for serious Yogis. You can barely hear Shiva's cues over the music. The video is so focused on being 'cool', that it totally fails to instruct, cue, or demonstrate poses. Anyone who has never done yoga would be totally lost.

And as for the trance dance....I was not entranced. The problem was that Shiva was very tight and I didn't get a sense of freedom from her. There was one guy that seemed to be 'in the moment', but for the most part the trance dance was quite silly.

You can choose from one which is yoga only, one which is dance only, or four that are a combination of both. The 'yoga matrix' can also be utilized from more variety & personalization. This dvd is beautiful and spiritual, to help you get in touch with your inner self while working out your body at the same time.

2554633,5,B000F8DB94,This is a wonderful DVD...great for releasing what ails you.  Just shut your eyes and let go!  I love this collection.,1150416000,4,118,4.571428571428571
2554634,5,B000F8DB94,"Shiva obviously dives into her projects whole-heartedly...WOW! I love it!  So much fun, so inspiring, a great yogic experience.  Beautifully filmed, poetic language.  I am so apprciative of the wisdom shared in this DVD.  Top-notch, you gotta get this one!",1150156800,8,256,5.325
2554635,5,B000F8DB94,"What a beautful way to teach moving meditation!  Believe me, there is nothing better to reduce stress than running around in circles waving your arms!  The only ones who will feel silly are those who let themselves be self conscious!  Quite a cardio workout this is too.  I found myself using segments from Yoga Shakti and this DVD by combining them together in one workout ~ and oh lord is it a workout!  Much like Yoga Shakti, this DVD has preselected workouts that range from slow, gentle and ""meditative"" to ""high energy"", ""Trance Dance Only"" and ""Prana Yoga"". As well as the wonderful ""Matrix"" that gives us the option of choosing any or all of the individual sequences.

  I was quite impressed with Prana Yoga, there were some poses and ideas presented by Shiva in this section that I have not tried before and they are giving me a much more flexible back and tighter abs!  The ""Twisting Kriya"" section really does put me in a trance and the ""Infinite Movement Meditation"" is perhaps my favorite ~ calming, cooling and restorative as well as a balm for the soul.

The photography, the scenery and the outfits are phenomenal, the dancers look like ordinary people, not models, although I did recognize music artist Joel Virgel among them!  Kudos to you again Shiva for all you have done!

Om Shanti",1149552000,29,1304,4.671052631578948
2554636,5,B000F8DB94,"This practice is more invigorating, freeing, inspiring, and energizing than any other DVD practice I have ever tried.  No lie.

It brings you joy and reminds you of who you truly are - you realize ""Hey - I'm not just my job, I'm not just a wife/mom/etc,  I'm ME and it's so cool!  I almost forgot!  And screw the job and screw whatever my kid just said that hurt my feelings, right now I am a whirling dervish!""-- it makes you feel happy like a kid again.  I guess you could call that ""washing away stress"" but I'd say it's more like screaming ""GET THEE BEHIND ME SATAN!!"" at stress and exorcising it from your planet.  Annihilating stress, if you will.

And it doesn't matter whether you are a yogi or not!  You can modify the dance sequences in any way you want.  You wanna lightly bounce instead of jumping up and down?  Well cool -- you can do that without feeling like a schmuck.  My superyogi friends would do this and love it, just rockin the moves, but my mom could do this and love it, too, because it's about being YOU instead of trying to be the person on the screen.  And the yoga matrix format rocks, without a doubt, without a doubt.

So in a word, I'd say this DVD offers LIBERATION!!  (Oh yeah, and a lot of great yoga stretches and a lot of intense calorie burning cardio, too.  But it's such a great stress buster that I almost forgot about that.)",1147737600,25,1365,4.2734375
2554637,5,B000F8DB94,"I own 2 other Shiva Rea DVD's and love them both.  This one is totally different, but a lively, joyful, meditative and thoughtful experience.  The first time that I did it, I must admit I was a bit self-conscious ""letting go"", even in my own room, but as I continued, I found many other feelings arose in addition to ""exercise"" that I didn't expect.  If you like structure and lots of instruction, then try Yoga Shakti DVD also.  There is a place and time for everything and you may find that in addition to the structure (I'm an ""instruction follower) you may be able to loosen up and have a different experience.",1147651200,11,614,4.455357142857143
2554638,2,B000F8DB94,"I own and frequently use Shiva Rea's Yoga Shakti - it's the most challenging Yoga DVD I've found to date, so it stands at the forefront of my collection. I enjoy what I'll call Shiva's ""academically creative"" approach to yoga in general, so I was pleased when I saw advertisements for her new Yoga Trance Dance, and pre-ordered it. The DVD is high-quality; well filmed, and her unique ""yoga matrix"" is as cool a selling feature as ever, since it allows you to design your own routine. The contents of the DVD are not what I expected, however. I had anticipated more of a creative blending of traditional yoga poses into dance - looser interpretations of the poses set to rythym. However, the DVD is structured such that yoga segments are completely separate from dance segments, and although you can alternate the segments to your heart's content in the matrix, you cannot integrate them. The yoga segments are less structured than your standard fare yoga DVD, but don't offer particularly innovative poses, and are short and few (you can't assemble much more than 30 minutes worth of yoga on this DVD). They're neat enough, but if it's yoga you want to do, you're better off buying a different DVD (try Shiva's Yoga Shakti, which also has the Yoga matrix and offers a multitude of variations on traditional poses, set to well-selected music, and offers the option of elimiating the ""instruction"" soundtrack and allowing you to practice to music alone). The ""Trance Dance"" segments are less useful than the yoga. The advertised ""free form dance"" is TRULY free form dance; the only guidance the DVD offers is footage of people in free-flowing clothing running in circles and waving their arms at White Sands National Monument (which is spectacular), while Shiva's [very soothing] voice encourages you to do the same. The idea of free movement and spontaneous creativity is a great one, and if you're a person who feels silly engaging in it without encouragement, even in the privacy of your own home, you might rate this DVD much higher than I do. However, I'm inclined to suggest that if your proclivity lies in this direction, you should purchase one of Shiva's music compilation CDs, and dance to it on your own. You'll probably feel much more spontaneously creative and less like you're aping the movements of the people on screen (and won't have a visual reminder of how silly you might look in what you're doing!). Bottom Line: a good idea and well-constructed DVD, but not a go-to or essential addition to a yoga collection.",1147651200,90,2530,4.831797235023042
2554639,4,B000F8DB94,"When I first wrote this review about 6 months ago, I did not have the priviledge of meeting Shiva and experiencing her Trance Dance first hand.  Now, I would agree with another reviewer, there is nothing like the open-hearted energy you receive in an actual trance dance experience, you can dance for hours and not feel tired, your whole body is soaking wet, all you hear is the music for hours afterward and it is a joyful experience that is like none other.

Now please don't misunderstand--this DVD has all of the new-found creativity that Shiva's other creations have and it is great, I guess now, to me it is more like seeing the movie when you have already read the book ~ just not the same.

This DVD has the wonderful Matrix, I think we are all getting spoiled on it!  There are preset practices for ""Prana Yoga"", ""Meditative"", ""High energy"" and ""beginner"".  I really enjoy Prana Yoga, the serpentine cobra that Shiva teaches here is wonderful for opening the shoulders.  The ""Jala Namaskar"" sequence is great for the abs,quads and knees, the ""Twisting Kriya"" really will put me in a trance and the ""Infinite Movement Meditation"" is perhaps my favorite--soothing for the mind, emotions and soul.  Enjoy fellow readers but try to attend  Shiva's actual Trance Dance whenever you can!",1147478400,6,1290,4.7792792792792795
8118815,5,B000F8DB94,"This video is beautifully done. The landscape is gorgeous, as are the models (who are also diverse). The music is perfect and Shiva's instructions and commentary are insightful and encouraging. I appreciate the fact that there are 6 pre-designed routines, or you can pick and choose what elements you want to incorporate into your custom-designed routine. I am new to yoga, and ,although I've heard of Shiva Rae for years, I have not seen her work. If her other programs are anything like this one:  wow!!",1512518400,,505,4.872093023255814
