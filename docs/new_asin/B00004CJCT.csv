1338898,5,B00004CJCT,"Director Peter Brook's adaptation of Shakespeare's towering play was made under the influence of Polish theater critic Jan Kott, who focused on the contemporary, existential aspects of the playwright's work. As a result, the film, which stars Paul Scofield as the eponymous monarch, seems less about the betrayal of an arrogant father by his grasping children, than about a Beckett character wandering the landscape of a meaningless universe. When Lear has decided it's time to divide his realm among his daughters Goneril (Irene Worth), Regan (Susan Engel), and Cordelia (Anne-Lise Gabold), he foolishly disinherits the latter for her honesty. The other sisters quickly dispense with their father's claims to dignity, and, traumatized by their cruelty, the ex-ruler is soon wandering the moors and ranting at the elements, in the company of his loyal Fool (Jack McGowran).

As another reviewer put it: ""The power of the text is given full rein in stunning performances, in particular that of Paul Scofield, an actor of breathtaking skill, emotional depth and humility. Full accolades must go to Scofield, with his craggy face, startling eyes and suitably moody performance.""  And I heartily agree. Scofield's performance is incredible.  This is one Lear you won't soon forget.
(This is a very difficult video to find -- some libraries still have it, and I found it there.  If you can find a copy, consider yourself most fortunate.  You'll find occasion to watch this excellent production by the Royal Shakespeare Company more than once!)",1085184000,23,1538,5.261224489795918
1338909,5,B00004CJCT,"I first saw this film back when it was on the art house cinema circuit--1973 or so--when I was still an impressionable youth. I was so taken with it I saw it 3 or 4 times while it was still running at the local cinemas. Since that time I've seen a number of productions of Lear, both film and stage, but have always felt that something was missing; that, while good, they never matched the power and profundity of this Peter Brook production. I wondered if this feeling was just residue from an overheated youthful enthusiasm, so I recently resolved to view the film again.  Getting my hands on a copy wasn't easy; it appears to have essentially disappeared from distribution, available mostly in used VHS format.  I eventually did secure a used copy in good shape from an Amazon seller.  I fired it up in the old VCR, and...it's not just as good as I remember, it's better.  Scofield is a complete virtuoso,  supple in his expression while tapping a deep, profound reserve of slowly building tragic suffering.  Honestly, as much as I enjoy Olivier, when it comes to Lear, Scofield simply overwhelms him.  In the scene on the heath during the storm, when Lear goes mad, Scofield erupts with unearthly moans and howls that seem to come from some primal recess of the soul.  The austere black-and-white cinematography is stunning and it, along with the bleak landscape, adds to the pervasive atmosphere of loss, groundlessness and chaos.  It's still the best production of Lear I've ever seen.  Highly recommended, even if it means shelling out what seems like an exhorbitant amount for a VHS tape.",1263686400,7,1596,4.729241877256317

1338911,5,B00004CJCT,"When Ingmar Bergman stated Peter Brook was the most important dramaturge of the century, many people could have thought this was a cordial and showy distinction, but the unerring test of time has dictated its last word and seems to sustain with legitimate argumentation this affirmation.

Paul Scofield (1922-2008) (A man for all seasons), made probably his most extraordinary lifetime role with this enigmatic and emblematic personage of Shakespeare's genius.

Respect King Lear and Orson Welles there's a curious and worthy to tell fact. Lear was the first Shakespeare's work learnt by him when he was just a kid and finally it was his unfinished project when the death surprised him in October 10, 1985. Previously, in 1957 O. W. recreated King Lear under the direction of Peter Brook too but in theatre, as well as Laurence Olivier during the early eighties, but as far as I know, the powerful ambiance and primitive stages in which this existential drama was conveyed nurtured and provided of ferocious realism this outstanding adaptation. Of course, we should not ignore the mesmerizing adaptation of Kurosawa in Ran in 1985.

Sequences like the fury of elements, the initial statement of Lear, the disinheritance of Cordelia, the curse over Goneril, the painful dialogue with Gloucester in the middle of nowhere on that lonely shore and his last words hardly will be able to be erased from our memory.

Special kudos for the unforgettable Irene Worth as Goneril and Patrick Mac Gohan as Duke Cornwall.

A film that has become legend since its immediate release.",1228694400,6,1568,5.062015503875969
1338912,5,B00004CJCT,"Of all the excellent performances of King Lear available to watch, Peter Brook's version (with a stand-out performance by Scofield, with an incredible character arc that few actors could carry off within one dramatic piece) is by far the very best.

If you haven't seen Peter Brooks' King Lear, you've missed an experience of the play that will transform your appreciation of Shakespeare forever.  Pure genius.  Thought-provoking, disturbing, also oddly inspiring...and amazing cinematography that enhances the experience through the stark landscapes and use of light and shadow.

Highly recommended.

To the reviewer just above me - what is offered on this Amazon page is a VIDEO, not a DVD.  Brooks' Lear has (unfortunately!) not been officially released on DVD for the U.S. market and unfortunately the only DVD version I have found available is for Region 2 (PAL), which works in the U.K.  Get the video version offered here if you're after the best production values available at this time for those of us in the U.S. or Canada (or any NTSC [region 1] viewing areas).",1215475200,7,1077,5.045197740112994

1338915,4,B00004CJCT,"Schofield is a convincing Lear, investing the role with an intelligent balance of gravitas and confusion - a more rounded and less self conscious portrayal than Olivier's. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent - without doubt one of the strongest on film. Brooke's direction is well paced, intense and a sustained visually bleak metaphor for the text, which it should be noted is incomplete. From Cordelia's first speech, lines are cut throughout, which may facilitate the pace of the action, but which for purists may be less than acceptable. The austere intensity of the direction is well complimented by the black and white photography and occasional Beckettesque extreme close ups which lend to an existing atmosphere of brooding and almost menacing despair. The harrowing final scene is particularly well directed, cleverly avoiding easy sentimentality. This can now be bought on dvd as part of Universal's excellent 5 disc Shakespeare Collection.",1165536000,11,957,5.386666666666667
1338916,5,B00004CJCT,"I have never seen a better Lear - on film or in the theatre. This is such a difficult role as the King moves from pride and
folly to anger and bitterness, to madness, and then to humility and understanding.  Peter Brook films the play in the winter of England which adds to the bleakness of the tragedy. The visuals are stunning in black and white - an outstanding choice to
bring out the mythic nature of the play.  Outstanding...should be on DVD.",1139788800,23,448,4.385542168674699
1338917,5,B00004CJCT,"Shakespeare, Peter Brooks, Paul Schofield and Jack McGowan.  My God, this movie is good.  Will someone explain to me why it's not been released on DVD?  It sliced my soul when I first saw it over 30 years ago.  It continues to touch me deep down where the meanings are with it's relentless look at human despair and courage at the mercy of random fate.  ""We are to the gods like flies to wanton boys.  They kill us for their sport"".",1111795200,31,432,4.271604938271605
1338918,5,B00004CJCT,"You need to see this one more than once. The first take will leave you a little unimpressed. The second will peak your curiosity and the third will hook you. The actors steal the show. Their minimalist approach is extremely effective, but it takes a few viewings to relish the complexity of the characters. Scofield in particular is in his best form, despite what others may say. His portrayal of Lear's madness is the most convincing I have seen. The only criticism I have is that there are parts of the film that are hard to follow during the first and second look, if you are not familiar with Shakespeare.

This film is a classic and is one of the most underrated movies made.

7919724,5,B00004CJCT,"The best movie I ever have seen. Thirty-six years after viewing it (once) at an art house cinema, I recall Peter Brook's presentation of Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" more vividly than entire years of my life. I keep hoping that someday it will reappear on the art house circuit. If it ever does, drop everything and go see it. Will a DVD version ever appear? Probably not. (I just checked, something I do every two or three years, just in case.) Why expose people to an incomparable and utterly astounding work of art.",1453334400,,515,4.608695652173913
7919725,5,B00004CJCT,"If you love Shakespeare and haven't seen this performance, try to see it.  Because it is not released on DVD, you must either pay an expensive price for a tape or see if you can borrow it from a library.  It's worth making the effort.  The Danish winter landscape reflects Lear's own winter. The film is shot in black and white, a director's choice which both echoes the mood and spotlights the actors.  Needless to say, Paul Schofield is magnificent, as are the other players.  It should be a landmark widely available as Schofield's Lear has been lauded as the greatest by such actors as McKellan.  Both exciting and heartbreaking.  You owe it to yourself to see it.",1437609600,2,668,4.610169491525424

On a freezing winter day in early 1972 I took a train from Philadelphia to New York and sat through two showings of this and came home. This was the closest place I could see it. Not a lot of people have seen this film. It is an amazing film.

Bleak, black, a work of darkness and despair. Yes? Is the play anything else? I taught it for two years and only this film could make the experience tolerable. Strangely perhaps (?), it remains notorious for having almost ruined P. Brooks' future opportunies in the business. If I recall, it was dismissed for being too ""Bergmannesque.""

7919728,5,B00004CJCT,"This rare movie of Peter Brooks,made in the 80's, is rarely mentioned in the reviews about the cinematographic adaptations of King Lear. But the director is a genius and the interpretation of Paul Scofield as the ageing king that divides his kingdom between his two elders daugthers and disowns his younger daughter because she could not say that she loved him above all things is one of the best! Scofield plays a Lear that is in the beggining of the movie magestic but not so coleric as many later productions show him. The actresses that play the two elder daughters are superb, the younger daughter has more time in screen than in the other adaptations and the tender dialogues between the mad king and Cordelia are more emphatized here. The stark scenario and the black-and-white color make the movie even more pungent and the dramatic movements of the background (the people, that rarely can be displayed in the theater form) make scenes without dialogues very beautiful. King Lear is a very complex character and each actor imprints his own set of values when interpreting the old senile King that rages, cries and claims against the gods about the ingratitude of his daugters. The performances of Gloucester, Edmund, Edgar and the other minor characters, as well as the Fool and Kent are very good. But the very best is still the kind and dazed aspect of Lear that Scofield presents and that side is not present in other representations of this play. A pity that this DVD is only available in Region 2 format because I think the americans would like very much to watch a brilliant adaptation of this famous play of Shakespeare by the director Peter Brooks.",1331510400,3,1664,4.78125
7919729,5,B00004CJCT,"I saw this LIVE and more than forty years on, it reverberates vividly in my mind and heart. I've seen many great Lears but nothing matches Scofield. What a sublime actor he was -- his Richard II at the Hammersmith Lyric in the 1950s was just as definitive and he stands out in everything he did -- the power of that complex voice, his pacing of the text and his dominance of the stage were always so balanced and nuanced and he manages the rhythms of this greatest of all plays with such intelligence and command. His film performances (Crucible and Man for All Seasons) are excellent but minor in comparison.

It came at a time when the traditional stagecraft of English theater was being transformed by the impacts of East European directors and critics and the flood of almost cinematic presentations of Brecht and Ibsen. (Kozintsev's own Lear just reissued on DVD at an outrageous price) and the Kozintsev and Heifitz Hamlet films are in the same style and with much of the same power.) Scofeld perhaps lost some of the poetry of the play and he contrasts with Gielgud's mellifluity and Olivier's bombast but the depth and naturalism of the combination of voice, scene and text are almost literally unsurpassable.

Alas, there is no available US-playable DVD on the market so that this one is unlikely to sell well. I offer my assessment here mainly to suggest that anyone who loves or studies Shakespeare needs to chase down the various Scofield DVD/VHS offerings. This is the peak of Western drama and while there will be many excellent Lears to come, this one is a benchmark. It combines a different and slant on the play from the perspective of lit crit plus a deeply moving and thrilling experience. If you can play it on your DVD, I am sure you will share my opinion",1318636800,,1776,4.634920634920635
7919730,5,B00004CJCT,"The most distinguished King Lear that I have had the priviledge of experiencing. Scofield's portrayal of the King who ""knew himself only slenderly"" Is as compelling and cathartic an experience as any Shakespeare ever produced. This is the essence of great art. Not to be missed-a soul altering experience.",1311724800,2,305,5.244897959183674
7919731,4,B00004CJCT,"The great Ingmar Bergman never got around to directing KING LEAR, but if he had the results might have looked something like this. Peter Brook, whose original stage production was influenced by the ""theatre of cruelty"" theories of Antonin Artaud, transferred that bleak outlook boldly unto film in this stark black and white version which was shot entirely on location in Denmark. The extremely strong cast includes Irene Worth, Patrick Magee, Alan Webb, Jack MacGowran as the Fool and the inimitable Paul Scofield as the misguided Lear. Borrowing a page from Charles Laughton's 1956 Lear performance at Stratford, Scofield takes a quiet, smoldering approach to the character which clearly shows a man who is used to being in control so he doesn't have to shout. The famous mad scene is underplayed as Lear internalizes his rage and frustration at what has happened to him. Running water on the camera lens brilliantly indicates the dissolution of his mind. The blinding of Gloucester, done from his point of view, is harrowing. The staging of Kent in the stocks, Edgar and Edmund's final confrontation and Goeneril's brutal death, help to drive home this bleakest of all Shakespeare plays.

I first saw this movie when it first came out in the early 1970s in the wake of a rash of Shakespearean movies spurred on by the success of Zeferelli's ROMEO & JULIET. It was a slap to the face, a punch to the gut and I have never forgotten it. I always envisioned it as part of a double bill along with Roman Polanski's bloody color version of MACBETH which was shot on location in Wales and released the same year (1971). No one would leave the theater the same as when they came in. While Polanski's MACBETH is readily available, a Region 1 version of KING LEAR has yet to be issued. If you wish to see it, then you'll need to get an all region player. Then you can try out the twin bill for yourself in the comfort and sanctuary of your own home. This is certainly not a LEAR to everyone's taste but it is certainly the most cinematic especially when compared with the much better known Olivier version. The text has been shortened and altered but unless you're very familiar with the play, you wouldn't be able to tell. Once seen, Scofield's Lear cannot be forgotten so let's hope that a Region 1 release will appear before too long. This is a performance for the ages and it deserves to be better known. When you watch be sure and use the subtitles.",1276214400,7,2447,4.651270207852194
7919732,5,B00004CJCT,"Paul Scofield has made a habit of appearing in magnificent, but critically so-so adoptions of the Bard. No matter what the critics say, I found Branagh's Harry V of the highest order,  and Scofield's Charles VI second only to Brian Blessed's outrageous Exeter. But in this, there is no-one else. It is Scofield going slowly Troppo to Peter Brooks' bleak Black & White, storm lashed direction. Both are utterly enthralling to watch. I first saw this because the Australian High School syllabus used to force one to study Dead White Men like Willy Waggledagger for one's Higher School Certificate, and I was too lazy, and way too clever, to waste my time reading ancient tripe like this, so I went and saw the movie instead. I discovered a genius who spoke to the ages from 500 years ago. Now my children are encouraged to study 'texts', preferably by a minority feminist, to achieve understanding of the human condition. I weep for such foolishness.",1276214400,4,948,4.815950920245399
