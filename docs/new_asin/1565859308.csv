7796603,5,1565859308,"36 hours,  technical enough to give understanding without going overboard with molecular details.  Good graphics.  Nowicki is good,  not boring,  and chooses good examples.  Inside the cell,  between cells,  complex organisms, and beyond.  And lots about amino acids and proteins.",1518912000,2,280,5.8
7796604,4,1565859308,"Taught by a no-nonsense, serious professor.  He covers microbiology, biochemistry, and population studies very well, but there's not much on anatomy and physiology.  He has good vocal modulation and gestures, but his jacket sleeves keep shaking (which is a little bit distracting).  The illustrations are fine, but there wasn't much in the way of animations.  I think that in the future there will be much more animation used to teach physical science, biological science, human science, and engineering science.  At the end of the course, he gives a balanced treatment of the global warming controversy--he does say that the biosphere will most likely adjust to minimize the effect of human CO2 emissions; this is Le Chatelier's Principle, although the professor didn't expressly say that.  Anyway, I do recommend this course.",1515888000,,827,5.323076923076923

7796608,4,1565859308,The content is easily understood.  The illustrations are first rate.  The lecturer is in need of presentation criticisms. His mannerisms are distracting.,1438732800,,153,5.909090909090909
7796609,5,1565859308,We are fearfully and wonderfully made. There must be a designer for anything so complicated as an organism. The conclusion that it all started from a collection of chemicals that became animated by themselves seems to me to be delusional.,1434758400,4,238,4.975
7796610,5,1565859308,"Have used many Teaching Company programs and invariably love them. This was for my daughter 's high school biology class. The set of DVD's was complete and in perfect condition. We saved a huge amount of money on the purchase. The content was as we expected. After she finished, I continued to listen to them, as the subject matter is interesting. Only draw back is that with original purchases from the Teaching Company, there is excellent tech support, and if you wait, all of their courses are available at a huge discount. However, for an emergency, high content revision guide it was great.",1357084800,12,595,4.786407766990291
