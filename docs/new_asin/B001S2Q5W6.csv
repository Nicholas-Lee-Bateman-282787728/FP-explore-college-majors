3783113,5,B001S2Q5W6,"I loved this film! After seeing it I had to talk to some of the people behind it and learn more about how something like this can be pulled off. Bob Gebert, wrote, directed and appears in the film along side the producer and star Christina Mauro. Both were kind enough to talk to me about this incredible movie.

Really, really good movie. Whether you are a fan of independent films, time travel, or of romance, this movie has everything to keep you entertained.",1235520000,4,469,4.5058823529411764
3783114,1,B001S2Q5W6,Stupid boring (film?). A bunch of wannabe (actors?). The only thing that would have livened up this camcorder wedding would have been to play Billy Idol's White Wedding. This thing is so cheap that his time machine was a small chalkboard.,1454457600,,238,4.829268292682927

3783116,5,B001S2Q5W6,Amazing story. So cleverly done. If you like sci-fi/time travel you will love this movie. It is very complex though and you may have to watch it several times to understand the timeline. Cleverly written and edited with a great cast of relative unknown actors. The portrayal of real life situations is dead on. I really got a good feel of who real people act in real life. Just a light sprinkle of the future that keeps you wondering without giving too much away. Just the right amount of confusion too to keep you glued to the story.,1454025600,3,534,4.459183673469388

3783119,3,B001S2Q5W6,"What a refreshing, new story: A time traveler experiences a wedding reception across several small trips of specific length (11 minutes), each of which is generally further back in time than the last. Like Memento, with time travel. The cinematography is a nightmare. The acting is a nightmare. The side stories are not very interesting in the least. The ending is ultimately underwhelming. I'm pretty sure the whole point of the plot was to get the time traveler laid with some girl he sees 11 minutes at a time every few months or so for a total of like 88 minutes, like some kind of Michael Cera sci-fi movie. Still, overall, the need to see what happens in the next 11-minute block is thoroughly compelling enough to keep you watching. I'm hope ""Hollywood"" will buy this story, and put out something a little more polished.",1452816000,,827,4.710344827586207
3783120,1,B001S2Q5W6,Fairly certain all the current reviews are written by people associated w the film team/film crew or in the cast.  This film was flawed before it started shooting.  From the highly inexperienced and incorrectly cast to the dull plot - while full of potential takes a quick nose dive - and the same 10 people at a supposed indoor wedding - watch a different film instead (unless you worked on the film).,1452729600,,402,4.569444444444445
3783121,5,B001S2Q5W6,"Amazing it was filmed in one day.  It was free so well worth the money.

I almost turned it off in the first few minutes.  Once I realized what was going on, I became very interested and entertained.

3783122,5,B001S2Q5W6,"I constantly use this film as an example to my students of how great writing trumps EVERYTHING (big budgets, famous actors, CG effects, EVERYTHING) when it comes to making good movies. This is a gem of an indie film, a thinking person's sci-fi romance. The concept is unique for the done-to-death time-travel genre; the acting is solid and the dialogue natural; the script is tightly written and stays on point; the chemistry between the romantic leads is off the charts; and every limitation of the low budget is turned to an advantage. I can't recommend it enough (I should mention that I'm not James P. White, I'm his wife, so don't blame him for this review).",1404345600,,663,4.724137931034483

Be sure to pay attention to each character and what is said each eleven minutes in order to get the most out of this little gem. And, I recommend watching it a second time. Of course, you will do that anyway. Then you get to spend days, tying all the treads together. Enjoy it. I did!",1368835200,,385,4.1466666666666665
3783127,5,B001S2Q5W6,"I LOVE this movie.  I put it in the category of superb ultra-low budget films including Christopher Nolan's ""Following"", Kevin Smith's ""Clerks"" and Shane Carruth's ""Primer"".  Like ""Primer"", ""11 Minutes Ago"" is a time travel movie.  Unlike ""Primer"", ""11 Minutes Ago"" is also a comedy romance with a far less confusing story line.  Both stories contain plot lines out of chronological order, which is initially confusing, but if you like time travel stories, you're used to that sort of thing.

What makes ""11 Minutes Ago"" truly outstanding is that it was shot like an intricately well-rehearsed live performance.  Gebert brilliantly includes all of the camera crew as characters (ostensibly filming a wedding reception in the story), so that the movie is filmed in a real house from all angles.  This puts the viewer in the middle of the action, making the characters seem very real while totally taking on the main character's point of view.  What a fun and unusual movie!",1335312000,,972,4.9937888198757765
3783128,3,B001S2Q5W6,"11 Minutes Ago has a simple concept: a mysterious man appears at a wedding reception claiming he's a time traveler.  Is he telling the truth?  And why is a camera crew who seems to know everything about him following him around?

What ensues is an ultra low-budget foray into time travel mechanics, wedding politics, and true love. Pack (Ian Michaels) appears in the bathroom of an indoor reception for a rained-out wedding. A videography crew, led by Jeffrey (Bob Gebert), tracks his every move and knows everything about him.  We discover why shortly after Pack's appearance: he is indeed a ""time tumbler"" traveling backward (and sometimes forward) in time.  The crew already knows quite a bit about Pack because they've met him before, even though the audience that Pack is introduced to is ignorant of his circumstances.

It seems Pack is a scientist concerned about collecting air samples; the future is a polluted place and it is diminishing civilization's libido. Only an air sample from a certain place and time will do, and so Pack travels back in the midst of a party that boils over with intrigue.  All of these events are recorded by the videographers and a mysterious other camera. Between them, multiple stories unfold.

All this time travel can be confusing so Pack helpfully provides a chalk drawing of his 11-minute increment time tumbles and how they interact with each other.  In Pack's future considerably more time passes between tumbles, and we learn about his feelings as the plot progresses.

Oh right, his feelings.  Pack is in love with Cynthia (Christina Mauro), a gentle soul whose personality is revealed as she navigates the political and emotional minefield that is her boss' wedding party.  She deftly juggles lascivious bridesmaids, lascivious fathers, a drunk groom, and enough drama to launch its own soap opera.

11 Minutes Ago gets a lot of things right.  Pack manages to be both, awkward, and idealistic without being too cloying.  The videography trick cleverly provides an audience perspective without being too gimmicky.  And the various plot points are interesting, if sometimes unlikely.

The problem is that in a film like this with almost no budget to speak of, the actors carry the entire movie.  Some, like the loose bridesmaid, are mere stereotypes who are curiously ignorant about the presence of a videographer that is routinely referenced by the other characters.  Others are simply too stupid to be believable.

The biggest problem is Mauro herself.  The camera lovingly focuses on her every emotion, as if willing us to fall in love with her.  But the reality is that Mauro is just not a very good actress.  Her wooden delivery, endless whispering monotone, and one emotion (a slight smirk) makes it difficult to see Pack's infatuation with her. She doesn't seem to have enough charisma to justify Pack's considerable efforts to romance her in such a short timeframe.

Although 11 Minutes Ago's heart is in the right place -- time is meaningless when it comes to true love - it tries to pack too much in with an uneven cast.  It's cute, but with the right actress it could have been great.",1333152000,3,3142,4.927756653992396
3783129,5,B001S2Q5W6,"Shot in its entirety in one day.

48 years from now the atmosphere was unbalanced. An intrepid time tumbler, Pack (Ian Michaels) tumbles back to the now to obtain an air sample that can be replicated and save the world. But wait a minute; why do these people know him? Has he been here before?

In Packs 11 minute sojourns into the present he finds himself returning to the same wedding reception for some inexplicable reason. Will he accomplish his mission and in the process will there be time enough for love?

I've always been a fan of time travel movies but not particularly those where you go before and after yourself and I've seen quite a few of those. However this presentation captures your imagination and does a fairly good job of it. Don't expect popular places or popular people or even a slick presentation; it's that style of an independent movie that gives you the feeling it has been made just for you.

3783130,1,B001S2Q5W6,"After reading at least 5 reviews on every film I watch, it was a shock to see a movie about concentration camps and a hodgepodge of cities and streets, old propaganda footage, and narration in Italian, German and English.  Maybe the time traveler took all those wonderful characters and hid them in a dungeon.  Perhaps that is why this whatever it was made me half sick.  Maybe it became a masterpiece after 15 minutes, but that is way too long for me.",1318636800,,452,4.487804878048781
3783131,5,B001S2Q5W6,"I watched this on NetFlix, actually, and really liked it.  One thing to get out of the way -- you must watch this movie all the way through the credits; I didn't the first time, and misinterpreted the ending entirely.

Anyway, I'm a big fan of time travel movies in general, and I thought this one was really well made.  From the very first scene, you're kept off guard enough that you never really know what's coming next, which is a real accomplishment, considering how few times I can really say that.  Even Source Code was much more predictable than this.  And the movie is just plain fun as well.

I ended up watching it three times, and kept noticing new things that are hard to catch the first time, since cause and effect often occur out of order, like Pack's collecting a second sample of air from the back storage room.",1315353600,,829,4.421052631578948

With the proper suspension of disbelief, it is a very enjoyable 90 minutes and an interesting message on the power people can have over one another.

The concept, simplicity itself, is sheer genius (and I heard that it was shot pretty well in real time over a weekend); if you like the more light-hearted, good-humoured end of fantasy, if you like edge-of-seat, no-budget filmmaking, and if you know anybody who ever got married, you GOTTA see it!!

I'm not really a science fiction person but based on the reviews this film has been getting, I figured I'd give it a shot. I am SO glad I did. The characters are instantly like-able - and I was completely invested in the storyline within the first 11 minutes. :)
I'm floored that this was shot in one day - SO impressed with the camera work - The acting was great! ...I loved it!

3783145,4,B001S2Q5W6,"The dialogue in this film seems a little contrived but the acting is so damn good (particularly the lead female, Christina Mauro, and the drunk groom, Jeremy Juuso) it doesn't matter. Wish the actors could time travel to some other movies that were shot over months, rather than the day this one amazingly took, that way I could get back some enjoyment robbed of me by the studios. Hats off to the production team, actors, and director for making what must have been a complex shoot turn out so well. Great acting, great concept, really, really good film.",1270512000,3,555,4.673469387755102
3783146,2,B001S2Q5W6,"This movies story line had so much potential but then the acting an production was so bad I wanted my money back.
The story was about this guy from the future.  In his time the air is toxic and the birth rate is decreased to almost nothing. He comes back to now to get a clean air sample and he lands at this wedding reception. He is only aloud to stay in the ""now"" for 11 minutes.

It is boy meets girl and boy falls head over heals in love. It takes him 3 months to time travel so it takes almost 2 years to see her for a couple of hours.

The story line was interesting, but man the filming aweful and the lead actress couldn't act at all. To add insult to injury this chick had an a voice that made me want to put in ear plugs.

So needless to say, I wouldn't recommend this movie.",1270425600,2,785,3.9182389937106916
3783147,4,B001S2Q5W6,"I think one of the reasons independent films will never overtake studio films is because most independent films suck. I went into this one fully expecting such an experience. After all, this is a one-day shoot on no budget, without any name actors. To say that I was surprised is an understatement, I was shocked - this really is a good little indie! The story is tight, the camera work professional, and the acting superb, with a big nod to lead Christina Mauro, who has some more films coming soon I hope. I'm still trying to wrap my mind around how the writer managed to pull off science fiction with such a budget, and pull it off terrifically, I might add. Everything that normally is a detriment to low budget films was used to great effect and incorporated seamlessly into this one. Also, I've never seen a film where the philosophical implications of time travel have been handled so deeply and subtly, big budget or no budget. Highly recommend.",1266278400,10,953,4.644970414201183

3783149,5,B001S2Q5W6,This is an outstanding film.  Sci-Fi films are usually quite costly to produce since it usually requires creating a world but this was beautifully worked around.  The budget on this film was lower than low and the filmmakers managed to work around typical pitfalls by constructing this concept.  They shot it in one location with 4 cameras and included the camera and sound crew into the script in order to work in any potential issues such as booms and camera men being seem.  They managed to do this all in one day.  Just outstanding!,1264032000,4,536,4.659574468085107

The acting in this film is outstanding.  The actors are moment to moment and are truly interesting to watch.  Christina Mauro and Jeremy Juuso give outstanding performances.  The director and producer managed to merge theatre and film into one working with very little budget and time.  I hear the film was shot in 16 hours.  Wow!

It is closer to About Time in story with the production value of Coherence. I applaud the effort, skill and thought that went behind this venture. It would be nice to see the places this team could go and perhaps in the future once the skill has matured more, to remake this same idea, better. Still, it kept me entertained and interested at 11 minute intervals right up until the big reveal.

Terrible song choice at the end though. Completely ruined the mood!",1456790400,2,639,4.756756756756757

8339330,3,B001S2Q5W6,"This movie is what you think it is. Low-Budget, shot in one day on the same set with emoticon performances. The most believable acting comes from an actress who has only a few lines in a tirade but then is scuttled to the side like a prop that makes faces. That being said, I gave the film 3 stars for the idea and plot. 11 minutes ago probably would have made a better book. The story is a little hard to understand at first but then just as you start to understand the movie is over. There was plenty of room to expand on the plots and subplots as this is a movie about time travel but didn't. Instead you get a decent storyline that is all of 30 minutes of the film with another hour of rubbish that by the end of the film is not quite cleaned up. I'm a big fan of independent films and I commend the director on the camera styles and the idea that it could be shot docu-style because the cameras are already there, that is, they are part of the movie. This could've been a much deeper film with more intricate storytelling and better actors and actresses. The face of the actor is irrelevant. The quality of the acting is what is important and it just wasn't there.",1455235200,,1169,4.176991150442478

8339332,3,B001S2Q5W6,"I'll give it a 3 because it didn't have a two N half.  I liked the concept, and relationships of characters and it kept me wondering what was going to happen.  The reason I brought it down was the last thing said....Maybe if I go back and watch it again I will hear what I might have missed.  I did leave the room for a few min..[maybe 11, LOL]  while the movies played and fast forwarded, so I could have missed that point.  That seemed like a major point to leave one hanging.  So again it could have been me missing the point.  The group did seem to be fun, likable, believable - as if they would really be friends or interested in one another- and it made me like them and kept hoping for a good turn out.  Just the last thing the groom said, I was even hoping as the film played back it would reveal what I missed.  I will watch it again just to see if it was me.",1454803200,,868,3.9710982658959537
