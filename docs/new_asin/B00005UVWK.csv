7955634,1,B00005UVWK,Wanted to set-up my home theater.  But the disc is not made to do that.  It's a lame attempt 5.1 setup DON'T PAY MORE THAN 1 CENT FOR IT. Disc says it has 2-4-6 channel surround but the menu does not let you accsess it.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  I THREW IT AWAY AFTER 10 MINUTES..,1264118400,6,280,3.9464285714285716
7955635,5,B00005UVWK,"I found this DVD very useful, and saved time in setting up my speakers. It also gives out some useful information that I personally was not aware of.
I have a Pioneer VSX-1019AH receiver that includes ""Auto MCCACC Speaker Setup."" After setting up my receiver the Pioneer way, I used this DVD, and it actually left me with a very well tweaked speaker setup. What I did know before hand (advice from Pioneer) was to setup the front speakers as ""small"" in the receiver and my Blue-ray disc player in the Setup menu. This gives the subwoofer a chance of showing off its potential. For a beginner or advanced audiophile I recommend this DVD.
The music played is purely a personal matter and for me the technical part of the DVD was the most important.",1254614400,8,746,4.533333333333333
7955636,2,B00005UVWK,"If I could have listened to this DVD before purchasing, I would not have bought it.  This is called a DVD.  I was expecting video with sound, I was disappointed with this sampler 5.1 set-up disc. Before I buy a demo again I want to be able to listen to it.",1232668800,,256,4.0
7955637,1,B00005UVWK,"After reading the Title I was expecting a great DVD audio experience.  I put it in my car and could find where the set-up tests are hiding.  In addition, the 8 songs that are included are not very good and I usually like all kinds of music.  This Audio-DVD is far from the ultimate!  I would not buy this and I am sending it back.",1207785600,6,330,4.030769230769231
7955638,3,B00005UVWK,"Get this for a thorough setup of your systems speakers in the testing portion of the DVD.  The sample music portion was not impressive to me as a good demonstrator, but then that just be my taste in music.",1204243200,7,205,4.256410256410256
