8228023,5,B000XDPSFG,"My father grows giant pumpkins as a hobby. This video made a great gift, also turned out to be more informative than anticipated. Some good hints, tips, and Bill Foss not only signed the DVD box, but included one of his Giant Pumpkin variety seeds. We will be planting this in the coming season.

8228024,5,B000XDPSFG,"We purchased this video for my sister who loves growing pumpkins for Halloween and the entire family watched it with great enthusiasm on Christmas day. It was wonderfully entertaining, informative, and certainly one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. It is something you will want to watch again and again. It is great for any age. We hope there is a sequel in the works! Makes a great gift for any child or anybody even slightly interested in gardening or autumn fun.",1199923200,,475,4.734939759036145

8228026,5,B000XDPSFG,"I bought this as a Christmas gift and was concerned about shipping details, I emailed the company and had a response within the hour, the DVD itself looks well made and am looking forward to giving this as a gift and watching myself.
Very nice having a company this easy to deal with, especially around the hectic holiday time.",1194998400,2,327,4.559322033898305
8228027,5,B000XDPSFG,"This is a perfect example of what this type of movie should be.  It was informative, had more than a few funny moments and kept everyone's attention throughout the entire movie.  Even the several children that watched it with us enjoyed it thoroughly.

The music was very well done, appropriate to the scenes and entertaining without being distracting.  The camera work and directing were first-rate.  The minor details such as the clever way the credits and tags were created and incorporated were impressive.

The Minneapolis Star Tribune's critic correctly stated that it is a wonderful movie.  I hope that the directors create another film in the near future and I look forward to watching Bill's Big Pumpkins again and again.",1192752000,2,730,5.033333333333333
