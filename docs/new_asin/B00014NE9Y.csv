1970392,4,B00014NE9Y,"I have been watching ""Saturday Night Live - The Best of Chris Rock"" after seeing the four seasons of ""everybody hates Chris"" which was canceled as of May 2009. I think doing so gave me the retrospective of understanding the SNL part of his life.

Chris refers to SNL at the beginning of the DVD as ""Where I started"", and seeing the sketches we can enjoy when Chris shines (when he is getting upset or comment about something) - and - we can try to overcome the horror of Chris Rock (when he sings).

I think people who gave a low score to this DVD are not truly Chris Rock lovers, nor they are a true comedy lovers. They want to see ""the HBO specials Chris"", forgetting that this part of Chris personality grew after SNL and because of SNL. Watching sketches like ""the Dark Side with NAT X"", ""The Overacting Negro Ensemble"" and ""Perspectives"" makes so much more sense after watching ""everybody hates Chris"" and understanding the background of Chris and what he went through.

All I can say is don't be fooled by the fear from the few not so funny sketches and just enjoy the opportunity you are given to watch one of the best Comedians of our generation.

Chris Rock rocks!

PS
I gave 4 stars to the DVD because it is too short. Did Chris only did 71 minutes on SNL? I don't think so. So why not bring the true fans of Chris something to be proud of keeping? something that will cover this period of his work? I have no idea. Guys - Chris Kattan's SNL DVD was 30 minutes longer, this is so not serious to give us such a short DVD!",1255824000,3,1530,4.2620689655172415
1970393,3,B00014NE9Y,"First off, Chris Rock is funny.  Really funny!  I haven't seen him on SNL (I lost interest in that show a long time ago) but I was really looking forward to this DVD.

The best parts is when Chris Rock is NOT doing comedy sketches.  The comedy was not funny at all.  The only parts worth laughing at were lines not spoken by Chris Rock.  If this was the best Chris Rock did on SNL then I'd had to see what didn't make the cut.

But what was funny was his social commentaries and correspondent reports.  Chris Rock is the master at commenting on what is wrong with what goes on in this country.

If you rent or buy this then expect to not be entertained through most of the show.  But the rare funny moments are worth hanging out for.",1120867200,7,733,4.134751773049645

Chris had so much to say that that you could tell the show was holding him back. Still fresh and funny today.",1482364800,,276,4.12962962962963

8006321,3,B00014NE9Y,"Chris Rock is a top comic talent, and I did laugh out loud several times while viewing this Best Of Chris Rock SNL DVD. The Nat X segment is a highlight for sure, and his Weekend Update commentaries. Beyond that, though, I can't help but feel some funnier bits were left on the cutting room floor. Or why did my memory of his SNL stuff out-funny this DVD?  I think part of it is that SNL strives to be edgy, as do great stand-up comics like Chris Rock. But the line can be crossed into questionable taste  early and often. In the end, it can look like cheap laughs via shock value that wear thin quickly. Some of Rock's greatness does come through, but I got the feeling SNL never quite found a consistent platform for his brilliance. As far as these ""Best Of SNL"" editions go, ""The Best Of Chris Rock"" is medium grade bordering on low grade. Just okay, I regret to say. He's such a funny guy after all!",1378944000,,903,4.244186046511628
