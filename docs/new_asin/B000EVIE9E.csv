So in addition to viewing the DVD...I was able to compare it to my memory of the actual live performance from that tour.  I also want to note I have a very rare bootleg LP of this same concert, which was cut in stereo and has the same quality audio.

This era represents Queen at their peak....Night at the Opera was just on the verge of being released and Bohemian Rhapsody was already a single hit.  At this period in time, Queen had already begun to smooth out some of the rawness of their performances that was their trademark sound for the first 3 albums.  By this time, they mastered the art of penning power ballads as well as very lighthearted bouncy numbers.  This concert captures all that power and energy that Queen were famous for delivering.  Freddie was starting to hint towards the flamboyant style he would demonstrate over the next few years.

All in all, an excellent show.  If you never had the pleasure of witnessing an early performance by these guys.....you'll want to see this.  Disregard anything that followed in later years....this is Queen as they were in their prime...at their peak.

One sad note....One track was omitted from the DVD that was originally performed on the LP...""See What A Fool I've Been""  The B-side single version was included on the Queen II cd, but it doesn't even come close to the live rendition.

This DVD is extremely rare and has been out of print for awhile...perhaps the recording industry will see fit to rerelease it along with the missing songs...as to show the performance in its entirety.",1145232000,7,1635,4.6947368421052635
