8038950,5,B00065GX8M,"My kid loves this movie. If you liked the Mucha Lucha show, this is very funny continuation of the series. Exciting guest stars include Tim Curry and Penn & Teller, though my kid could really care less :) I only wish more episodes of this show were available. I've only been able to find the one 6-episode disc and this movie.",1445299200,,326,4.360655737704918

8038952,3,B00065GX8M,I don't like it because their Spanish speaking confuses me little bit. It was funny but the dyalic is the problem.,1436832000,,114,4.476190476190476
8038953,5,B00065GX8M,This was a fun movie.  The best part was the extras at the end where you got to see all of the hidden items throughout the show. We had to watch the whole thing over just to see if we could catch them ourselves.,1398556800,,211,3.7954545454545454

8038956,5,B00065GX8M,"I taped ""The Return of El Malefico"" when it was on tv but I wanted to have the dvd instead.  This dvd features non-stop action.  See Rikochet, Buena Girl and The Flea save the world from El Malefico.  This is an excellent dvd chock full of extras.  My favorite extra on this dvd is the pilot for Mucha Lucha.  I hope that box sets are released for all three seasons of Mucha Lucha.  This is one cartoon that always makes me laugh.  In case you didn't know, Mucha Lucha is created using Macromedia flash.  If you are a Mucha Lucha fan, this is a must for your dvd collection!",1119571200,3,574,4.201834862385321
8038957,4,B00065GX8M,"Fans of the Kids WB series ""Mucha Lucha"" can't miss this feature-length adventure. The evil El Malefico has broken free, and it's up to Rikochet, Buena Girl, and the Flea to stop him by gathering up three magical artifacts from different parts of the world. Will they get to Las Vegas in time to save their parents, the other Luchadores, and the world?

I found it not too scary for the little ones, not too boring for older kids, and the adults will enjoy the special guest appearance of Penn and Teller.

All in all, a great animated movie to watch together.",1106438400,2,560,4.480392156862745
