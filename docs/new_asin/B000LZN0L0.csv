I'd rate the video quality a 7 out of 10.  It's easy to tell these DVDs were copied from not-so-good-quality video tapes. Also, although it does have a main-menu guide, its sub-menu guide is very disappointing. You can skip through chapters, called Amalgamations, but you can't select the specific move you want. I had to write down the Minutes-location of each move so I could go back to study them. However, with over 50 moves, the QUANTITY of moves makes this discounted package a better deal than what I've seen so far..",1237161600,,677,4.737288135593221
