7902654,5,B000003KAS,"As a small sub-plot in the beginning Neelix, Paris & Kim create a hologram program, featuring bathing beauties and carribean music - Suddenly everyone is summoned to the deck for an emergency, an alien spacecraft has been encountered and Voyager transports three survivors (from a planet called Ilari) before their ship explodes, despite the doctor's and Kes' efforts one of them dies.
Kes comforts the dead man's wife (Nori), and the Ilari tell the crew that mercenaries must have destroyed their ship. Neelix becomes perplexed when Kes tells him they should spend more time apart, and everyone is surprised when Kes suddenly kills a representative from Ilari sent by the leader known as the ""Autarch"" and takes off with Nori and the other Ilari, Adin.
They go to military camp, where they take over and then kill the Autarch in front of his youngest son. Meanwhile ""Demmas' the elder son meets with the crew where they learn that Tieran, a two hundred year old political leader (who has learned to tranfer his mind from body to body) has taken control of Kes.

Kes is pushed to the back of her mind where she battles Tieren to regain control of her body, and the Voyager crew try to figure out how to save her.
Over all an enjoyable episode! Good acting, Interesting plot. It's funny to see Kes turn suddenly into a power-crazed (paranoid!) warlord. :p",1023408000,2,1354,4.761702127659574
7902655,5,B000003KAS,"This episode is one of the few that centres on Kes, the Ocampa female, who joined Voyager's crew shortly after the ship was stranded in the Delta Quadrant. Kes possesses latent telepathic abilities, a characteristic of her species, that are beginning to surface. In Warlord, the writers have created an interesting premise, one of intrigue, assumed identities and bodily possession. Despite adversity, Kes'forces her identity upon her captor Tieran, whose mind has taken possession of Kes' body.  Kes is determined to thwart Tieran's takeover in a battle of wills as the crew find a way to rescue Kes. Jennifer Lien delivers a great performance as Tieran, the alien Warlord, whose personality has possession over her mind and her body.",1007683200,,735,5.176470588235294
7902656,3,B000003KAS,"I'll admit that I absolutely hate Kes, and was glad to see the back of her, but this is a decent episode that centres around an evil politican  (aren't they all evil?) who takes over Kes' body so he can use it to get  control of his homeworld. The evil Kes character is wonderfully played out,  Jennifer Lien really does ooze power and authority when plaining the  villian.
All in all a good episode for Kes with a new twist to the 'my  bodies been taken over by an alien' storyline.",966902400,2,483,4.263736263736264
