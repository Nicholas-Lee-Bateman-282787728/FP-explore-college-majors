1783780,5,B00006L93S,"Our little grandkids that are preschool age loved this video.  Since they are always on the move, it was fun to watch them move to the music and actions of the children on the video.",1378512000,3,182,4.2
1783781,2,B00006L93S,"My 2 year old really loves the Toddler Tunes DVD, so I thought I would try the sing-a-long songs. I ordered other DVD's at the same time that arrived together, so opened them all up, and then realized the company sent me Pre-School Songs instead of the sing-a-long songs, so I am unable to return it now since I opened the packaging. I haven't watched the Pre-School Songs yet, I am sure it will be fine. But quite annoyed the WRONG DVD that I paid for was sent, and there is not a spot to contact the company on here for some reason. So I am giving this 2 stars for sending the WRONG dvd and for not being able to contact the seller.",1372982400,,634,4.120967741935484
1783782,3,B00006L93S,"There is nothing special about this dvd.  The sound quality and visuals are dated.  I was unfamiliar with the fact these recordings fall into the genre of Christian music. This fact needs to be clearly noted in the description. I would not have ordered the dvd if I had known this in advance.

There are two ""Christian"" songs included: ""Children, Jesus Loves You"" and ""Everybody Ought to Love Jesus.""  I am a preschool teacher.  I am also a Christian, but I do have non-Christian children in my student-body. Therefore, for my purposes the dvd is not appropriate for my viewing audience.  Thankfully, my disc skips, so I can return it.",1367280000,6,635,4.7272727272727275
1783783,5,B00006L93S,"Good songs to sing/teach in the preschool classroom.  Songs for the car, at home, even to wind down at night.",1352764800,5,109,4.45

1783785,4,B00006L93S,"There are 2 versions of this DVD. I specifically wanted the older version, which is what was advertised. When I got the DVD it was the new version with extra songs that I personally did not want. Oh well... . Shipping was fast",1266364800,2,226,4.27906976744186
1783786,5,B00006L93S,"I have a few different kids videos and the Cedarmont Kids video is the only one my 14 month old daughter will sit down and watch for the whole 30 minutes!  It sure is nice to pop in the DVD player when I need to wash the dishes or get something done around the house without worrying where she is or what she's getting into!  It's GREAT!  Good, wholesome kids songs!",1194393600,14,366,4.126760563380282
