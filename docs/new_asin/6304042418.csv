I went in apprehensive, but the editing of the movies was great and whoever did the voice overs should win some sort of award. I love the vintage black and white mixed with the off the wall crazy the dialogue. I would defiantly recommend this one.",1303862400,,301,4.206896551724138
7862404,2,6304042418,"You know who would make a great Hercules? Snoop Dog. He's so handsome, charming, magnetic, and suave. He could impregnate Hera and scream, ""You ho! Git outa my face ya'll bitch! You told me you was on da' pill!"" He is a classy guy with loads of talent and good looks. A great role model for inner city blacks. The producers could make a hip-hop Hercules with this charmer in the starring role. I'm sure some money-hungry producers named Irving, Seth, and Seymour would go for the idea. Destroying culture and morality means nothing to these people----money is their God. That's why the country is the mess it has become. By the way, is that Irving running to the bank? He dodged the draft in Vietnam as he lambasted capitalism----now he is a millionaire movie producer. Hmmm, detect more than a little hypocricy? They'll keep exploiting the blacks while lining their pockets and spewing forth their empty rhetoric about how they empathise with the plight of poor blacks. Yeah, right. If you believe that, I have a matsa ball factory in Harlem I'd like to sell you. And by the way, take that Christmas Tree down! Irving says it infringes upon his rights to have to look at a Christian symbol. He can get rich selling you Christmas gifts, but don't disturb his spiritual sensibilities by erecting a Christmas Tree unless you erect a menorrah right next to it. Remember that, you Christian schmuck.",1165795200,,1395,4.721311475409836
