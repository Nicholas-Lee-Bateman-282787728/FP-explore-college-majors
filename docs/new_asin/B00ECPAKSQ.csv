8603927,4,B00ECPAKSQ,"The tape came super fast! The flaws the tape had are a loose glass lid and the bottle for the solution had a squirt nozzle that barely worked, so I had to take it off and attempted the drops. When the tape stopped playing, I had trouble ejecting it, so I turned off my TV/VCR combo I inserted the tape in, and after turning it back on, I was able to eject it. After a few minutes of waiting for the player to dry up a bit, I put in a cassette to test the results, and to my amazement, there was a clear picture.
So overall, it is a good product.",1458777600,,545,3.875
