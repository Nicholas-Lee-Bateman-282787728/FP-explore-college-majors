8237902,4,B0010JR7GK,"Ohio Light Opera are to be congratulated on making this video of their production - and making it available for less than the price of a theatre ticket.
As a production it has enthusiastic and gifted performers, but not the finish say of Australia Operas Gypsy Princess, but would that other organisations would also video their productions, that the wider world can again see some of the nearly forgotten great works in the underrated musical comedy/light opera/ballad opera/operetta genre.
As a work it does not have the quality of his later works (try their CDs of  The Violet of Montmatre from 1930)for instance, or search for DVDs of Grafin Mariza,Gypsy Princess and Duchess of Chicago.
However I am talking about a composer whose combination of libretto and music, was amongst the best in operetta.",1221782400,,804,5.0
8237903,4,B0010JR7GK,"The Ohio Light Opera is a gem worth discovering. A cast of energetic, attractive, mostly young talents, adding to their repertoire over the summer holidays; so if you go in the last week, you can see 7 light operas (sung in English) over 5 days. I've been twice (from Australia). The acting in this DVD isn't as good as I remember from the live performance; they may have been over-conscious of their first videorecording. Anthony Maida is always good in comic roles. Joshua Kohl is convincing in the difficult Soldier's role. Lovely music and singing. And how could you not weep, knowing that mothers are still seeing their sons being sent to war, and hearing that they're not coming back?",1206230400,,690,4.758333333333334
8237904,4,B0010JR7GK,"This is a video of a stage performance, so, considered simply as a video, it is naturally second-rate. But you must set against that that this is a gifted young professional cast doing a rare work by one of the most brilliant composers of light opera. This was Klmn's second show, the tale of a young Austrian officer come back from war to tell his best friend's family that their son is dead. But when he is mistaken for the dead man, and finds himself unable to tell the truth, lest tragedy ensue, the pressure mounts on him until he is no longer able to bear it -- especially when he realizes that he and his ""sister"" are falling in love. This is an operetta, so it finally manages to pull a happy ending out of its hat, but it's a close thing.

This version by the Ohio Light Opera moves the action up from 1867 to 1919, in the aftermath of World War I.

I happened to see this performance live. One other member of the audience remarked, as we were leaving, that this was a work equal to ""Mother Courage"". I don't know that I would go so far, myself, but, for whatever it's worth, there it is.

Sung in English. Highly recommended.",1198972800,,1136,4.274418604651163
