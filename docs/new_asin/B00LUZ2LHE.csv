8668291,4,B00LUZ2LHE,"The commission of a new opera by Philip Glass to open the new Landestheater at Linz in 2013 was a bold statement of intent. Whether the expectations were met or not, I doubt the sprawling and largely incomprehensible Spuren Der Verirrten was what anyone had in mind, but it has to be said that the work fulfils its remit perfectly and often impressively.

As you're dealing with a Peter Handke script as the origin for the libretto of Spuren Der Verirrten (literally 'Footprints of the Lost'), I guess the question 'what is it about?' doesn't really apply. Or perhaps you don't need to look far beyond the title itself to grasp the essential theme of the work. It is indeed about the lost, and the opera takes a kaleidoscopic and somewhat abstract view of where we are as a society today, a lost society that has indeed just blindly followed in the footsteps of those lost before us. There are a few characters and motifs around this theme that weave through the three acts in a variety of short scenes to the extent that by the end of the opera the chorus are in the orchestra pit and the orchestra are on the stage. Everyone is lost and we don't know what's going on, but look, isn't it still wonderful?, Spuren Der Verirrten seems to say.

Well yes actually, it is. While this kind of narrative can prove puzzling to an audience, it's perfect for the abstraction of music, and perfect for how Philip Glass traditionally approaches such material. Spuren Der Verirrten is really no more abstract a piece than Einstein on the Beach, Glass unconstrained by narrative demands and writing music purely for the beauty of the theatrical experience alone. As such he's at his most lyrical, rhythmic and melodic here. It's almost like a 'Best of Philip Glass', with the flow of Einstein, the choral surges of Satyagraha, the swirling musical melodies of his Dance pieces and the pulsing narrative drive of Powaqqatsi (more so than Koyaanisqatsi). There's also something of The Voyage in the approach to a similar concept, and even some of the film soundtrack Glass of 'The Hours'. It's certainly a much more musically rich piece than the recent The Perfect American, but by the same token, it's not exactly anything new from this composer either.

The reason for the richness of melody and tempo is clearly a response to the variety of Spuren Der Verirrten as a theatrical piece and Glass gives this expression the perfect musical accompaniment. Finding a coherent narrative line in it all is partly down to the individual in the audience, but it's also a challenge for the director David Pountney to give a visual representation to abstract fragments of text, keep it flowing and make it all fit under one roof. The artistic, logistical and technical challenges are evident (and alluded to in the Making of feature on the DVD), but even though it inevitably looks a little cluttered in places, it does all come together remarkably well and provides Linz with a suitably grand, epic and ambitious work to open their new theatre. It might not be great, but it's an impressive achievement nonetheless.",1417564800,12,3092,4.764925373134329
8668292,1,B00LUZ2LHE,"A lot of Glass' music, I like: Aknaten, my absolute favorite.  I've seen many live productions (& of course the movie scores always sound right on with the story line (Mishima!!)  The live productions with Peter Sellers as Director always win.  I'm sorry to say, since I anticipated a happy journey into a new piece,he might have made sense of the P?l?o?t? if he were on deck; Lost I was and the music seemed almost unimportant. The staging and direction was typical of the German way of mounting operas: let's destroy theater, opera and use symbolism so vacant & unoriented, so stunningly without reference to life on the harmonic scale, so....well, lost. I never even lasted though the disc. Boo",1411603200,4,697,4.791666666666667
8668293,2,B00LUZ2LHE,"Before the arrrival of this opera I tried to prepare myself for it.  I read two reviews: one very tepid and information free from the NYT; and another, quite flattering, from AroundTown, both from last year.  Neither really prepared me for the work.  First: I was shocked when, upon opening the case, I found not even liner notes (think Kultur for minimalist packaging,  This went one better).  For a moment, I thought I had bought a used copy, but no.  This is Prime bought.

The cast of characters: they are named by the letters of the alphabet: A.B,C and so on.
Moreover, most roles are played by two singers during the same performance.  Glass aims to create a Total Work of Art, encompassing dance, mime, speaking, singing and special effects. There is much ado on stage at all times, But substance?  Well, From what I could gather, the title, which in reality translates as ""Traces of the Lost"" is about the banality and the joy of human existence.  Humanity is lost ""forever"" and yet its vitality ""celebrated"".  I got no such message.  Instead, I saw the painful workings on an old man who repeats himself musically, makes his actors do the same and creates a work which is no longer what it is supposed to be (opera).  It reminded me of an absurdist play, but without the ironic sense of the Absurd Ionesco's plays emphasize so well. Maybe it should have been called  ""The Sound and the Fury"".",1411516800,6,1401,4.596774193548387
