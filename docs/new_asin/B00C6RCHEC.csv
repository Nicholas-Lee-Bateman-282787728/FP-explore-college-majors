8577781,5,B00C6RCHEC,This is my second DVD with Tara. Love it. Learn the exercises from the first DVD and doing them when I have a brake at my work. This DVD offers more advance set of stretching and great upper body workout with resistant band. I glad that I bought it!!!,1497139200,,251,4.142857142857143
8577782,1,B00C6RCHEC,"This videotape sounds like it was recorded in a large gym over a speaker system.  To me, the sound is totally unacceptable.  I have Dara Torres' first video, and the Instructors are wearing the clip-on microphones on these, and the instructions are very easy to understand.  I returned this second one because I could not handle the poor sound quality.",1491177600,,352,4.833333333333333

8577784,3,B00C6RCHEC,This product was SUPPOSED to have come with a stretch band but it did not. I haven't tried the DVD yet; I'll have to find my own stretch band. Not worth the hassle of returning. I'm sure it'll be a good product once I've had a chance to use it.,1444780800,,244,3.9
8577785,5,B00C6RCHEC,Felt stretched and strengthened throughout the day after the workout. I can see myself doing these stretches in my personal workouts.,1408320000,,133,5.380952380952381
8577786,4,B00C6RCHEC,"I like the exercisers in this video, they are really well demonstrated and work great. The only problem I have is the workout portion includes all of the demonstration ""chit chat"" and wastes a lot of time. I would like a streamlined version of the workout minus all of the explanations. Perhaps a narrator like the first videos workout section. That's why only 4 stars.",1396483200,6,369,4.6923076923076925
8577787,5,B00C6RCHEC,This own takes you to the next level awesome stretches really opened my hips up for me and strengthed my back,1396483200,5,109,4.238095238095238
