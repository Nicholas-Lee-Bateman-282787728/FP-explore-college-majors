If you have not read the book, by all means read it!  It's an absolute delight.  I loved the book, reading it twice.  It sparked my interest in all
Twains work.  The movie?  An absolute tragedy.",1371513600,2,264,4.531914893617022
7907384,1,B00000F4X3,"This is like watching kids who don't fully understand the history of where they are, they just seems to be such idiots.  It was more about the actors than the places they traveled to.  Just silly and a waste of my time and money.  So..okay I watched it again since my first entry and I will say it is filmed on location and wished it showed more of the sights than the charaters. How ever because it was filmed on location the sight of women in Egypt in Burkas was interesting because the Burkas were all bright white muslin, like a white gauzy fabric and now , on the news, etc.  it always shows women in heavy black Burkas.  Additionally, Oscar Wilde raved about this book so I thought the VHS would be good.  Consequently I have ordered the book and hope I like Mark Twain's writing better than the screenplay.  Keep you posted.",1356048000,,831,4.357142857142857
7907385,4,B00000F4X3,"The acting in this rather elderly made-for-tv movie is good, not great, being some of the earlier work of stars Craig Wasson, David Ogden Stiers, and Brooke Adams, and some of the special effects aren't very special, but the spirit of fun and the exotic locales are true to Twain's book. I have enjoyed it immensely - several times.",1235692800,3,332,4.6440677966101696
7907386,2,B00000F4X3,"The producers of this film managed to take one of Twain's most enjoyable and hilarious books and turn it into a dull and lifeless ""movie of the week"".  Perhaps my expectations were too high, but the humour and spirit of the original work was completely lacking.  Not recommended.  Read the book, it's wonderful!",1012953600,5,311,4.830188679245283
