But the main point is, the DVD is suck. I felt like I got rip off. I wish I did not open it so I can return the DVD. It did not cover everything you need to know about Dermal Filler Injection. In addition, I personally do not like the way she did the procedures. She kept poking to the patients' (clients) skin like a sponge, caused bleeding, pocked through the skin, and leaking the material again and again. If you don't believe me, try it yourself. My strongly advice is ""Don't waste your money"". Finally, I decided to buy another book, which I like it so much. It is almost half the price of that DVD and it is great. I came in Hard Cover Copy. It gives alot of general knowledge, detail information, wonderful procedures, and able to access online to watch the procedures.  It is called ""A Practical Guide to Dermal Filler Procedures"", written by Dr. Rebecca Small. I just want to make myself clear, I have nothing to do with Dr. Small and her business. Good luck.

3644111,5,B001HT7YIY,"This video is one of the best instructional videos I have ever viewed! It's next to impossible to find a video on dermal filler procedures so when I saw it, I thought I'd give it a try. I was completely surprised with how good this video was. I learned more from this video than from a class that I took on the same subject. Also, it's nice to have to to review techniques and for reference. More than worth the price and I recommend it to anyone considering purchasing this video!",1241395200,11,481,4.2967032967032965

8309591,5,B001HT7YIY,This was the greatest book ever!!!! It was an accessory to my new purchase. You see I found this really cool website thebeautypharmacy.com and this book went hand and hand with the Dermal fillers I had purchased on this website. Oh ya and by the way you don't even need an RX to buy the Dermal Fillers. So I was very pleased to find this book for my new dermal filler purchase.

8309596,5,B001HT7YIY,As a professional I was really impressed by the details of the DVD The Complete Guide to Dermal Filler Injections. As well as it being a refresher for myself this DVD would be ideal for those starting out in the business or for a student learning about the different methods of injections from lip fillers to radiesse injection techniques.,1419120000,,339,4.762711864406779
8309597,5,B001HT7YIY,"I'm a certified dermatologist and I get so many clients who want to know what they can do to bring more youth to their skin. This guide helped me re-study dermal filler injections to help give temporary youth, and it also taught me things I didn't learn in school.

This is very informative while also being simple to understand, which is key since learning can sometimes be difficult.

It also teaches things such as lip enhancement/filler, restylane, and juvederm. It's a really great refresher!

I'd recommend it to anyone in the skin care industry. c:",1418947200,3,555,4.821052631578947
8309598,5,B001HT7YIY,"This DVD is one of the best I have ever seen on dermal filler procedures. The video is professionally shot and excellent value for money. It covered areas such as cosmetic injection techniques, how to inject juvederm and radiesse, how to use facial fillers for the lips, forehead, crow's feet, glabella, nasolabial folds, to name but a few. Great demonstrations on how to plump up lips, fill facial lines and reduce acne scarring. Without hesitation I would recommend this dermal filler training DVD to any skin care specialist",1415145600,2,527,5.0
