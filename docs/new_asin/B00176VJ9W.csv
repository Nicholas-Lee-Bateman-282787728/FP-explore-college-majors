8265133,2,B00176VJ9W,"Very low-quality. Just a camcorder plopped up on a tripod. Spends NO time on the actual training/hands-on part, maybe once for a couple of min and its vague, you need to stop it and refer to the Sequence Handout, which you need to print of copy to get it. Does not remember data on many occasions. Not worth $26 I assure you.",1455494400,,325,4.258064516129032
8265134,2,B00176VJ9W,"As a recently certified EFT Practitioner, I was hopeful that this video might offer a few new insights, tips, etc... However, I found Linda to be ill-equipped in producing an insightful, instructional video. Instead, this is video of a live workshop. And while one might gain some knowledge of the EFT practice, Linda's presentation seems scattered and amateurish. This is not to say that she is not effective as a therapist - instead, I find her ineffective as a video presenter. There are far better videos out there, particularly Getting Thru to Your Emotions with EFT by Phillip and Jane Mountrose.",1217376000,21,602,4.97029702970297
8265135,5,B00176VJ9W,"I have recently discovered EFT.  There are several books out there, and I have voraciously ordered most of them.  This DVD is one of the BEST resources I have come across yet regarding EFT!  I adore Linda Wallace in this DVD, she gave me a very clear understanding of how to make EFT work for me in a down to earth and practical and enjoyable way.  She comes off as very intelligent and ""normal""  LOL..... (sometimes EFT feels very odd, so to watch a video of a very together woman describe it makes it so much more palatable for me).  I HIGHLY recommend this DVD Workshop.  I wish she lived close to me, cause I would make an appointment with her today if I could.",1212624000,14,665,4.272
