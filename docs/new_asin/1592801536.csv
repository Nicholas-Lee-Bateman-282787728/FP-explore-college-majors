7953515,2,1592801536,"First, let me say that I think Martin Pring is very knowledgable and a true professional.  However, someone sold him a bill of goods on this one!  While Martin did cover a lot of material, the overall presenation was disappointing.

The DVD is simply a video recording of a seminar or class where Martin gave a lecture.  The DVD was taped in a small room with a live audience.  The back of the audience's heads were in view most of the time throughout the presentation.  Numerous times audience members would get up and walk in front of the camera.  Martin did show some slides of charts and gave a quick explanation of content of each chart.  He did offer an explanation of his thought process in deciphering the action/emotion of the moves as he worked through the slides.

My expectations may be the reason for my disappointment.  I expected to receive a professionally produced DVD that gave an explanation of Technical Analysis using various oscillators with an explanation of what the oscillator did and how to get the most of their use.  Also, I expected to learn various strategies for tracking and analyzing trends.  None of this was part of  the DVD.

In my opinion, this DVD was over priced and very disappointing.",1165622400,43,1225,4.690140845070423
