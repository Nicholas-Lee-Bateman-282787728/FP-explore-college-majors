1365815,5,B00004WICL,"I purchased this particular DVD to get ""Horton Hatches the Egg,"" one of my all-time favorites. However, any Dr. Seuss is fun to watch, so I highly recommend this DVD if you have young children, or adults who are young at heart.",1272499200,,227,4.428571428571429
1365816,1,B00004WICL,"Theodor Geisel.  Not Dr. Seuss.  We could not endure watching one complete episode except for the Looney Tunes, ""Horton Hatches an Egg.""  This is not  a ""for kids"" production in our view.  It is just a little on the crass side with the animation, the production, the writing (not charming and funny Dr. Seuss).  We found some of the material inappropriate for our kids, under 5. And Horton's trunk is drawn falic, especially in the scene where he sneezes - good ol' Looney Tunes.",1233705600,2,479,4.642857142857143

1365819,3,B00004WICL,I have only watched the Butter Battle video because I use it for a Cold War lesson in my classroom.  Pretty good,1179360000,,112,4.090909090909091
1365820,4,B00004WICL,"The Seuss cartoons here are naturally going to provoke outrage from the mamby pamby lovers of Barney and the New Zoo Revue who want all the kids to grow up skipping through daisies holding hands and singing ""We are the world"", but some things to consider.

The Horton cartoon is from the Looney Tunes folks, albeit in a rough Seussian style. I saw it myself as a child and was not traumatized by the fish shooting itself (NOTE-The fish isn't actually shown doing this act, he goes offscreen with a gun and it is implied), having seen similar scenes in other cartoons at the time (relax folks, your kids are stronger than you think-Tom and Jerry didn't turn anyone into axe-murderers and no one today is complaining about the equally gross antics of Itchy and Scratchy). If anything, the bird's callousness toward Horton and her egg concerned me more than anyhting else as while watching this as a kid.

Daisy head maysie, to me, is essentially a Seuss rewrite of The underground classic ""Boy With Green Hair,"" although her character seems a bit more self-assured.

Likewise, the Butter Battle book is straight out of Jonathan Swift's fable about the people going to war over how to break eggs, although its considered to be a cold war fable.

Yeah, Suess sometimes actually wrote for adults.",1171843200,22,1291,4.75
1365821,2,B00004WICL,Daisy-Head Maizie and The Butter Battle Book are excellent animated shorts based on the seuss books.  But Horton Hatches the Egg is the worst animated version of a seuss book I have ever seen.  My family was watching it with my 4 yr old and we were all very surprised when in the middle of it a fish character pulls out a gun and shoots himself in the head.  Not at all appropriate for kids!,1133481600,38,391,4.1866666666666665
1365822,3,B00004WICL,"Don't let the Cat in the Hat on the cover fool you: this grab-bag collection features a trio of relatively obscure animated Seuss tales, each of which deals in a more satirical, ""adult"" vein of humor than the good Dr. is commonly associated with.
I can remember watching the ""Butter Battle Book"" in a high school poli-sci class; Seuss's satirical Cold War fable is both amusing and chilling, and a good choice for older children and teens.
""Daisy-Head Mayzie"" was produced for cable network TNT and is based on a story published after Seuss's death. As ""Butter Battle"" does with the arms race, ""Mayzie"" sends up our culture's obsession with celebrity.
""Horton Hatches The Egg"" is actually a Looney Tune cartoon short, originally released in the 1940s and directed by Bob Clampett (not Chuck Jones as a previous reviewer asserts).  This item might actually be of greatest interest to animation buffs (such as yours truly), featuring as it does Clampett's trademark rubbery animation and adult-oriented humor.  It's also completely restored and uncut on the DVD version.
All in all, I'd recommend this collection for Clampett/Looney Tunes fans and adult Seuss fans.  It's probably going to be a little too far over the heads of the kiddies.",1076112000,63,1238,5.0
1365823,1,B00004WICL,"This video leaves much to be desired.  Especially the scene in ""Horton Hatches an Egg"" when a fish came out of the water and shot himself in the head.  Definitely not what I would expect from a Dr. Suess video.",976147200,29,210,4.225
1365824,1,B00004WICL,"Compiling two specials made for TNT, and Chuck Jones' 1941 ""Horton Hatches The Egg"" (From his early Disney-like peroid) to boot, it's nothing more than a thrownaway!

1365825,1,B00004WICL,"I am stunned that the Suess people would allow this version of ""Horton Hatches the Egg."" Why on Earth would you add a fish shooting itself in the head with a gun (with a very loud bang) in the middle of a video for children? This is NOT in the story.

Viewers expecting something similar in quality and creativity to ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" may be disappointed with this collection.

1365837,3,B00004WICL,"Pretty much, what everyone else said in the comments about a fish shooting himself in the head was true. Ironically enough, I didn't notice it until after right after my son's uncle had done the same thing to himself, to which my son started asking a whole bunch of questions that I didn't feel prepared to answer. We still will watch the first two shows simply because they are a childhood favorite of mine.",1393632000,,408,4.527027027027027
1365838,1,B00004WICL,"This DVD is unrated for good reason, it would never get a G rating in this day and time. In Horton Hatches the Egg a fish character pops out of the water, says that he's seen everything and proceeds to shoot himself in the head.  In an earlier review I read that the fish is just seen taking the gun under water.  That isn't true you see the blast (all though it isn't bloody).  This dvd has certainly done my kids more harm than good and I have thrown it away, which let me tell you is no big loss.

Horton is protrayed as a lisp ridden elephant who is so simple that he believes he has to keep his promise.  The wonderful themes of the book are absent from this production and I highly suggest you read the book to your children instad.  (P.S.  There is no Peter Lorre fish look alike in the book who kills himself).  Not to mention that Horton comes across as noble and doing the right thing.

Daisy Head Mazie leaves much to be desired.  It would hardly fall under the ""best"" of the Dr. Seuss movies.  As someone who has loved Dr. Seuss movies and books for my whole life this one just fell flat.  The moral is that fame is not important, but I don't think it evoked enough emotion for anyone to actually care what happened to Mazie.  (Honestly the Daisy was the only likable character)

Butter Battle book is just as I remembered it as a teenager.  It didn't harm my children to watch it, but they obviously didn't pick up on the cold war references.  There are milder themes that they could pick up on, such as fighting is usually pretty stupid and someone should stop things before the escalate, but this is no way makes having this dvd in my house worthwhile.",1393113600,5,1667,4.261146496815287
1365839,3,B00004WICL,I like this but was disappointed a little because there is an inappropriate scene where one of the cartoon characters took a gun and shot himself. Not very appropriate to show to children anymore.,1392336000,,196,4.794117647058823

1365853,4,B00004WICL,"Starting out as an editorial writer for his views on isolationism and militarism during WWII, Dr. Seuss' political cartoons of the 1940s are used in classrooms of general and higher education across the world. His works are referenced beyond the history class - into all of the Social Sciences as well as English and Lit courses. As a mother, there is a value of Dr. Seuss' works that are for children, and there are many more that are beyond the children section of your public library. It is similar to popular shows of our childhoos like Ren and Stimpy, Simpsons, South Park - animation does not appropriate tv for kids make. Neither does colorful pictures and sing-song paragraphs. Of course the tales in these movies is not intended for a younger audience 100%, but there is no shame on Dr. Seuss for his legacy. The political mindfulness and focus was the purpose of his tales, cleverly hidden within silly names, characters, made-up words, and unreal sketches. Why 4-stars then? Simply the audio quality of the DVD is not the best. I understand it derived from an original VHS format, but with all of the digital sound options and editing we have available to us these days, I was expecting the voices to be clearer, especially in a classroom setting.",1335312000,3,1258,4.748858447488584
1365854,1,B00004WICL,"My son loves the butter battle book so I got this despite the bad reviews thinking that it couldn't be that bad.....well it is. It's HORRIBLE!!! The first movie Daisy-Head Mayzie teaches bullying and is not for children at all! It teaches kids to hate what's different and sell out your friends and family to be famous. Of course it has a good moral in the end that family is more important but it's done in a very poor fashion. I'm glad I screened this movie before letting my son watch it. He will never watch Daisy-Head Mayzie! I can't believe other reviewer actually showed this to their children.

The Butter Battle movie, has weird voices and songs that are hard to understand at times. The animation seems to be a little bit choppy as well. I decided to let my son watch this movie because he likes the book so much but he hated the movie and had no interest in it. I don't blame him either.

Much like the Butter Battle clip the Horton movie has strange voices that are difficult to understand. The animation is better then that of other Dr. Seuss DVD's like Green Eggs and Ham but Green Eggs and Ham DVD is WAY WAY better! There is also a fish who shoot's himself in the head with a gun on screen for no real reason. Children can watch the fish shoot himself and that's why this is not a children's clip. I also hate how this movie teaches that it's okay to abandon your baby (aka the egg). My niece asked if all mothers left their babies while they were growing.

I really, really wish I would have listened to other reviewers and not wasted my money on this movie. We are huge Dr. Seuss fans and we're ashamed for Dr. Seuss that this was even put out. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!",1327276800,,1689,4.30503144654088

7925490,5,B00004WICL,"Some people have criticized a joke in ""Horton Hatches an Egg."" A fish with Peter Lorre's face sees Horton sitting on an egg while crossing the ocean attached to a ship. The fish, in Peter Lorre's voice, says, ""Now, I've seen everything. He then pulls out a gun and shoots himself. The gag is based on several other similar gags in other cartoons. The gag is funny if you know who Peter Lorre is (as most people watching the cartoon in the 1940s in a movie theater would). Lorre was know for the psychotic characters he often played. Children under 12 today would just find it bizarre and momentarily amusing and forget about it in two seconds.
Apparently some parents are afraid their children are so stupid that they are going to somehow get a gun and imitate the fish. It would be a great shame if anybody follows these parents obsessions with protecting their children and do not get this DVD because of it. ""Horton Hatches an Egg"" has an incredibly beautiful message of self sacrifice and love for children ever shown in a cartoon. One has to adore Horton's fantastic slogan, ""I meant what I said, and I said what I meant, an elephant is faithful 100%."" It is one of the great messages for children in any animated movie.""
I would recommend this DVD to any parent, ""100%.""",1505174400,,1276,4.528138528138528

""Horton Hatches the Egg,"" an exclusive

It has Daisy-Head Mayzie and Butter Battle Book.
Chuck Jones made ""Mayzie"" and ""Horton,"" you know.

While Ralph Bakshi made the original Lord of the Rings,
Here ""Butter Battle"" is one of his things.

Two cartoonists prestiged lend their talents to Seuss

They seem remastered, good fidelity.
Without Universal's films of vulgarity
No Jim Carrey here to yell, oh no no.
No cats making out with a gardening hoe.
No Paris Hilton to dance at a rave.
