5540419,2,B00B0LKPPS,"Ricky is the story of a ""lovable"" loser who tries to win back the girl of his dreams by enlisting the help of another girl and, well, we all know where this is going.  The story is pretty predictable and the jokes tend to fall flat, but there are a few good moments in this film.  When the main character bumps into his ex-girlfriends father at an Asian massage was a pretty hilarious scene.  Also, Ricky's failed auditions throughout the movie do offer a sample of Mark Markey's comedic talents.  But overall the film just doesn't flow well.  Ricky's ex is so horrible that she becomes a caricature.  Ricky is made out to be so clueless in an attempt to establish his naivety that before long you just stop rooting for him.  By the end of the film he just doesn't feel real anymore.  At best he is a complete idiot.  At worst he is delusional.  And the end of the movie was a total disappointment.  By then you start wishing someone would get a restraining order filed because it stops being funny and starts feeling uncomfortable.  Although we are suppose to be happy about Ricky standing up to the elitist who tormented him throughout the movie, you just feel like it is another example of a guy who really should have let it go a lot sooner.  But the soundtrack was exceptional and the acting was pretty good for an independent film.  Although Matt Markey (who wrote, starred in, and directed the film) didn't score a knockout with Ricky, he showed some comedic chops.  Ricky isn't great, but it does have its moments.  Just not enough of them.",1434412800,2,1548,4.494623655913978
5540420,5,B00B0LKPPS,"Writer and lead actor Matt Markey captivates the spirit of unanimously winning it all in this triumphant and heartfelt comedy about love and friendship. 'Ricky' is a date night must see filled with sparkling moments!!!

***This die hard 'Rocky' fan will charm your heart***

Aspiring actor Ricky McDown goes the distance to become the 'perfect' guy for the mistakenly 'perfect' girl Tracy, after kissing the canvas and losing her to Casanova Brad. Adorable boxer Janie rescues Ricky's down and out broken heart by training him to contend with far more than just fighting. Matchmaker Janie is saved by the bell as Ricky weighs in to even out the score to win his girlfriend Tracy back from the pretentious Brad . You'll cheer for the witty and lovable Ricky as he muscles through each jab of relationship revenge. Clinching every bet ever made against his odds. Proving he's a lover and a fighter.

This sentimental movie is packed with tough love punches for the soul. It will entertain you with its buoyant humor and inspiring heroism. Markey cleverly illuminates the premise of  'never judge a book by it's cover'.

'Ricky' is a gargantuan knockout of the park debut film for leading edge writer Matt Markey.",1392940800,,1210,4.911764705882353
5540421,5,B00B0LKPPS,"This is an awesome twist on the ""boy tries better himself to impress girl"" story. Funny, and great connection to the original Rocky. And the story is just a truly feel-good inspirational one! The hero is a a dude you root for from the outset. (And the fact that the lead actor is also the writer/director is cool.) Purchased this over on FamilyVideo before it was on Amazon. Great indie romantic comedy to add to your collection.",1384992000,,429,4.584415584415584
5540422,2,B00B0LKPPS,Some cute and clever ideas but the movie just doesn't work. Like his failed attempt at love this movie just flops. Not horrible for an independent flick but will definitely not ever watch again. The main character Ricky is likeable enough but absotively forgettable. Nice try but better luck next time.,1384041600,5,302,4.9411764705882355
5540423,4,B00B0LKPPS,"Are you an underdog, have you lost at love, do you find yourself behind the 8 ball most of the time, are you misunderstood? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then, I believe you will thoroughly enjoy 'RICKY.' We've all been in love at one time or another and most of us have 'Lost at Love' at one time or another. Ricky is no different. But, most of the time, when you ""Do"" lose at love, it leads you to your ""True"" love.
This movie will make laugh, that is for sure. You'll identify with a lot of the movie. The Hope of finding true love, getting by with a little help from your friends and staying ""Young at Heart"" are some of the themes that come to mind when I think of a review of this movie. And as John Aviildsen said (the Director of 'Rocky') it is a great homage to Rocky.",1374278400,3,794,4.063694267515924
8560333,1,B00B0LKPPS,"I actually don't hate this.  I haven't actually watched the whole thing though.  I dig stuff like this.  True indy.  This is the type of stuff that can come from the heart, and that's what matters to me the most.  And I also happen to be a huge Rocky fan as well so I gave this a shot.  I could only watch the first few minutes of it because the audio was so out of synch.  I scrubbed through the rest of the movie to see if it was like that through the whole thing and, sadly, it is.  Anyway I'm droppin this review not to be critical but in hopes that the folk involved will fix the audio or maybe give me a shout and I'll see if I can help them in any way cause I'd really like to check this out . . . with sound audio.  Pun intended.  Peace.",1501372800,,745,3.810457516339869

8560336,3,B00B0LKPPS,"Matt Markey did a good job with his written, starred, and directed film.  Getting dumped can happen to anybody but following up consuming All Co Hell and being exploited by lesbian exhibitionist lap dancers is absurd.  In process of helping Ricky improve himself to ""win back Tracy"", his long time friend Janie falls in love with him.  Ricky ultimately realizes what it was all about and engages himself to Janie after concluding his busymess with the pretentious uppities including Tracy's father who hasn't been getting anything at home.",1474243200,,539,5.1022727272727275
