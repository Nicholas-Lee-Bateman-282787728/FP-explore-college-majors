8341202,3,B001TH16HE,"Rather dated and silly idea. The only good thing is John Smith, who was a lovely man.",1477180800,,85,4.0588235294117645

8341204,5,B001TH16HE,"I originally caught June Blair in an episode of Bat Masterson on the THIS channel, which plays the entire catalog of MGM movies and TV shows. Great stuff! So I see this young girl and I say to myself that she seems very special and rather vivacious. Turns out she was Miss January(?) in Playboy of 1954(or so). I went to IMDB and looked up this young actress/model, and found this movie.  Wayne G's skinny on the movie

8341205,1,B001TH16HE,"This is indeed as bad as it sounds.  Disappointing however is the transfer - apparently not licensed, and taken from a bad VHS copy. Sad to see Jeff Richards, a budding MGM star of a few years earlier come to this.  It is 1.33 and fuzzy b/w. You have been warned.",1297036800,4,263,4.137254901960785
8341206,2,B001TH16HE,"or 2.5 stars. show kinda lenghty for the plots, has 3 ""fiery scenes literally, the last bein so brief. there's an ole mako shark scene. show just ok but a lil borin not that xcitin. the best scene, finally in midshow, is when the dr- ""flame throws the plane out.""",1246320000,,263,4.28
8341207,3,B001TH16HE,"When Jeff Richards and John Smith crash-land on an uncharted Pacific island, they encounter an atomic scientist, Alan Napier, who's fled from society with his three nubile daughters: Venetia Stevenson, June Blair, and Diane Jergens. Romantic complications quickly ensue. Curiously reminiscent of ""Forbidden Planet,"" this unabashed ""B"" movie -- in passable black-and-white -- avoids hokey humor and cheap titillation in order to tell a story that, while admittedly silly, holds a surprising amount of interest, even after the passage of 50 years. Those amenable to looking below the love-on-a-tropical-isle surface may note a homoerotic connection between Richards and Smith who are presented as close friends and whose ""beefcake"" qualities are often displayed in bare-chested footage. (Note the scene where Smith applies suntan oil to Richards' back.) Alan Napier, maintaining dignity throughout, achieved later fame as the loyal butler on TV's ""Batman.""",1245456000,4,954,5.773049645390071
