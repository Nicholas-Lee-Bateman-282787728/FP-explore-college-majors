8076305,4,B00003XAL6,"This review is for the DVD. I am in my 60s with chronic low back pain but I had no trouble doing this workout. But bendy people won't be challenged by it. A little too much choreography for me (I am really uncoordinated!) but for general flexibility, this might be a good choice for older beginners. Leritz has a likable manner and his directions are clear as far as they go. I would have liked to know more about proper form, and what I should be feeling where. I felt the hamstring stretch in my back until I tweaked my position on my own.",1475884800,,541,4.211538461538462

A bunch of my professional Broadway singer/dancer/actor friends use this video. Casts of ""Fosse,""  ""Rocky Horror"" and others love it!
