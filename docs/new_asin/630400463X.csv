A beautiful story of three sisters -- one a bit neurotic, one a bit naive and one a rebel  (Keaton, Spacek and Lange respectively.)

750314,4,630400463X,"The film is based on Beth Henley's play about the secrets and scandals of three sisters, the MaGraths. One of the sisters has shot her husband. The sisters are played by Diane Keaton, Jessica Lange and Sissy Spacek. The sisters  were once very Close, time and the tides has created a distance. Tess Harper, plays annoying Chick Boyle, the cousin who lives next door; Sam Shepard is an old lover.

 Babe, played by Spacek, shoots her husband. Keaton has not found a life because of some old wife's tale of a shrunken ovary. Langue went to Hollywood to find her fame and ended up in a psych hospital. She has come home because granddaddy is ill and babe shot her husband.  They are all a little strange, they live in Mississippi in the 1990's, and are ostracized because their mother committed suicide along with her cat.

Each has a life of loneliness they want to change. Each needs some get up and gumption. The girls are a unit and a family, and they will find a way. A fun, sometimes sad look at the lives of three women in a small, southern town.

I decided it was time to buy it and keep so I can watch it anytime I need a laugh or a reminder that I shouldn't take life too seriously.  The acting is great from the actors who only appear for a scene to the three sisters who always entertain with their unique personalities.
Sissy Spacek, Diane Keaton and Jessica Lange were perfectly cast in these roles.

750431,3,630400463X,"I found this film a little bizarre. Even though many of the words were familiar, the over-all effect was one of disassociation from the Pulitzer prize winning play.
It seems impossible that the two could have been written by the same person. Characters merely mentioned in passing in the play become major characters in new scenes, new locations, etc in the film. The result is a wonderful play fractured beyond redemption in this film.

Diane Keaton flailed and shouted, bounced from furniture to wall and back again like a hopped-up long haul truck driver. What's that about? It's certainly not the character she was hired to play. It was funny,really. Bad funny. You could actually see Jessica Lang, Cissy Spacek and Sam Shepard recoil from her, with a ""whats she going to do next?"" quizzical look on their faces. And the music score was just wrong, wrong, wrong.

Other than that, I loved this movie. :)",1285113600,3,907,4.8076923076923075

750435,5,630400463X,"Perhaps you have to be from the South to love this movie; however,I believe that the performances of Jessica Lange, Cissy Spacek, and Diane Keaton created the perfect storm to make this a terrific movie.  The southern accents were a bit suspect, but you can quickly leap the accents to the acting.  I did not see this movie in the theatre, and missed it when it first came out in video.  My daughter made a reference to hanging she and her cat on Valentine's day; thus, I was forced to see what this movie was about. Performances, successes and failures, beauty with abuse, and loyalty. Sisters hate each other, but ultimately sisters stick together.  Without the terrific performances of these three talented women, all of that tension and estrogen driven drama, Crimes of a Heart would flop.  But with them, and each female actor was strong, I alternately cried and laughed.  Don't let this movie disappear.  It is timeless.",1269648000,,926,4.786163522012578

It's interesting to read the readers' reviews and see who picks out their favorires among the three.  For my money, it's Diane Keaton and Jessica Lange tied, with Sissy Spacek coming in third.  Sam Shepard, although in a small role, helps a lot.

The script is a bit dated and some may be tired of the same old Southern cliches, but all in all, it's a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. The final scene with the birthday cake is worth the price of the film.  I have the hunch that Keaton ad-libbed with the size of the slices, which produced a wonderful last shot.",1266192000,,655,4.380165289256198

This movie is a bit on the dark side as it is about 3 sisters who are disfuntional in their lives (wait-who isn't??) But is shows how in the end, families are meant to take care of each other when the going gets tough. If you are into semi-dark humor/drama, then this is a movie for you. The characters are completely believable (I think we all have some of each of them in us), and the story line is easy to follow. Sissy Spacek,Diane Keaton, and Jessica Lange have great chemistry together~Too bad they didn't make more movies together. One regret, I wish I could have seen this in play form~I bet it would have been just as good.",1240099200,2,844,4.314465408805032
750490,4,630400463X,"Clever and witty, `Crimes of the Heart' is a film you just have fun watching; thanks in large part to the splendid performances by Jessica Lange and especially Sissy Spacek (who walked away with an Oscar nomination).

The film revolves around three sisters; Lenny, Meg and Babe.  Babe, the youngest, just shot her husband and so this tragic event brings Lenny and Meg together to support her.  Their local community is less accepting of Babe's actions, and even the sisters themselves.  They have constant fights with their own family members, especially the sharp tongued Chick Boyle (played by Tess Harper, who also walked away with a nomination).  As Babe's case gets examined deeper secrets are revealed that shake the sisters to their core, but all the while the experience brings them closer than they've ever been.

The film is elevated by the superb performances by most of the cast.  Oscar nominees Specek and Harper are sublime, each wrapping their steal claws around the biting screenplay and injecting their talent into every word.  Harper is quick witted and harsh with her delivery, while Specek is much more playful with her delivery.  Personally I feel that Spacek should have walked away with another Oscar, for her performance is beyond brilliant.  She manages to capture her characters naivety without ever making her weak or `dumb'.  I also truly enjoyed Jessica Lange who balanced out Spacek wonderfully, complimenting her co-star every step of the way.  She delved deep into Meg's own personal issues without ever overshadowing Babe's storyline.

Diane Keaton is talented, no doubt, but she is very hit-or-miss with me, and this was a miss.  She play's Lenny as if she were slightly mentally handicapped which takes away from the authenticity.  Yes, she is the sheltered and guarded, inexperienced sister but she plays Lenny almost too reserved for her own good.  Her later scenes are refreshing, but getting there was difficult for her.  She is the films one sour note for me, and the reason I give this a B+ and not an A.  It was very hard to watch her for a lot of her scenes; she made me uncomfortable in her awkwardness.  Thankfully Spacek and Lange work very hard to make up for her, but overall Keaton is an unforgivable mistake.

The film is nicely scripted (adapted from the stage play of the same name) and it feels fresh.  It is highly entertaining and engaging from start to finish, with clever dialog and plenty of funny moments.  It is also a very sweet and endearing film, but it is never once syrupy or saccharine.  The film is very light, which works in its favor, for it never bogs us down with too much emotional manipulation.

I highly recommend this film for it is truly entertaining from start to finish (in spite of Keaton).  I love Spacek; she is a wonderful actress who just knows how to hit her mark every time.  Throw in the luminous Lange and the biting Harper and you have a slew of noteworthy performances to elevate this highly satisfying film.",1230681600,2,2997,4.7933723196881095

750495,5,630400463X,"Typically films that blend comedy and drama don't come off very well.  They have a tendency to swing from one extreme to the other without establishing a happy medium. ""Crimes of the Heart"" is not like that at all.  The blend of comedy and drama is smooth and effortless.  Basically the premise is a look at the relationship between the quirky Magrath sisters in the small town of Hazlehurst Mississippi.  Elder sister Lenny (Diane Keaton) is an aging spinster with little experience with men.  Middle sister Meg (Jessica Lange) has had more than her fair share of men and scandals that result.  Youngest sister Babe (Sissy Spacek) has just shot her abusive husband and is facing a lengthy prison term if convicted.  It is this event that brings the sisters together where their idiosyncrasies and past resentments surface and set the stage for some amusing confrontations and revelations.  To me this film is synonymous with a warm hug as the atmosphere is very welcoming and familiar and as viewers we can really feel like a part of the Magrath sister's world. The performances are terrific and very natural. There's no impression of upstaging or attention mongering. The three leads act with each other as opposed to acting ""at"" each other.  Tess Harper and Sam Shepard complete the film with their supporting turns. This is a great film that gets better with additional viewings and interestingly enough becomes more compelling and entertaining.  Lots of fun!",1153267200,5,1463,4.959016393442623
750496,5,630400463X,"Crimes of the Heart is the screen adaptation of the hit Beth Henley play.  The McGrath sisters are an unlikely a set of sister.  Their family was once the pillar of society but now they have fallen from grace.

Lenny (Diane Keaton) is the oldest sister, Meg (Jessica Lange) is the middle sister and Babe (Sissy Spacek) is the baby sister.  Each is very different.  Lenny has become a spinster (well she was a spinster even before she was old.)  Meg has always been a free spirit and has fled the small southern town (well, she left a under a cloud.)  Babe had everything come easy to her and married a successful lawyer.  Also, there is cousin Chick (Tess Harper) who married above her station and is quick to point out the sisters faults.

As the film starts Lenny is celebrating her birthday, alone.  Babe returns to the family home after shooting, but not killing, her husband.  Meg also returns for a reunion under these unpleasant circumstances.  Of course, what follows is the sisters reopening old wounds.  Meg also opens up one of her own old wounds by reuniting with her high school sweetheart, Doc (Sam Sheppard or Mr. Jessica Lange).  But the big question is why did Babe shoot her husband (Beeson Carroll)?  She won't even tell her own lawyer (David Carpenter).

This is a brilliant comedy with great performance by all.  Sissy got the Oscar nomination but all three sisters were great.  This is a great look at the early eighties mores from a small town point of view.

750556,5,630400463X,"`Crimes of the heart' is a wonderful movie based on the Pulitzer Prize winning play by Beth Henley.

The story is about three sisters, Lenny (Diane Keaton), Meg (Jessica Lange), and Becky (Sissy Spacek), who reunite together after a long time when Babe (Becky) shoots her husband. Due to the fact that their mother committed suicide when they were young, the three girls have completely different personalities from each other. Lenny, the oldest, is a reticent woman having problems with relationships because she thinks low of herself due of her medical problems. Meg, the middle sister, leaves the family at a young age to pursue a career in Hollywood, only to end up in failure. Babe, the youngest sister, shoots her husband because of the abuse and loneliness through the years. As the days pass, the three sisters come closer again and face each other's difficulties.

This was a delightful movie to watch, due to many reasons. Firstly, the entire cast acted wonderfully. When you see names like Sissy Spacek, Diane Keaton and Jessica Lange, you know you are going to see powerful performances of the characters in the movie. They all acted faultlessly in their own way according to their roles. Secondly, Bruce Beresford did a great job in brining Beth Henley's award-winning play to the screen. Furthermore, the background music also added well to the movie.

I wouldn't recommend this movie to everyone, but if you enjoy watching dark-comedy movies, then you will like this one.",1111536000,4,1486,4.983870967741935

Diane Keaton plays Lenny, the oldest of the three, who seems to be the most sane sister of the three.  Jessica Lange can't seem to keep a man.  She just sort of jumps from one relationship to another and Sissy Spacek plays Babe, the youngest of the three, and she has just shot her husband, so she has a few problems there.  Yet it is that that brings the three together again for a bittersweet reunion.  Sam Shepard also shines as Doc Porter, a long time friend of the family.  I would classify this movie as being a 'chick flick', but a very well done one at that!

750559,5,630400463X,"The films I watch tend to be action films of the likes of Arnie, Stallone and Gibson et al. So it may come as a surprise that I say that I think this film is a real gem. So why do I think that? Well, for a start it's just a pure delight from start to end. Great acting, great directing, great storyline. It's a southern story played out with charm, elegance and humanity. It's really very diificult to say exactly why one likes this movie because it really is a special personal experience that covers so many things, from aspects of motivation, the way the characters reflect and even just their accents. I will never forget those simple lines ""oh babe why did you do it"" and the replies, or the ""she was just having a very bad day"" lines too. It's a very personal film, laid back, up-close, intimate, soft, a work of art. Brilliant acting, brilliant direction and brilliant script - lovely film.",1035417600,16,897,4.409638554216867
750560,5,630400463X,"Usually when I sense that the actors had a great time making a movie, the result isn't particularly noteworthy. (""Cannonball Run"" comes to mind.) But ""Crimes of the Heart"" is an exception. If Jessica Lange, Diane Keaton and Sissy Spacek weren't absolutely delighted to tackle the lead roles in this film, they are much better actors than I thought.
The material is reminiscent of Flannery O'Connor, who wrote some of the most humorous, offbeat Southern fiction extant.
The three sisters are so controlled by their visceral reactions that one wonders if any of them have ever had an intellectual moment. Although it would be maddening to have such people for friends, they're great instruments for movie comedy.
One final note: If anyone thinks Sissy Spacek is goofy-looking (as I used to), they will change their mind when they see her in this. She is absolutely gorgeous here.",1028073600,7,877,4.9727891156462585
750561,5,630400463X,"I'm so surprised to read a bad review of this movie. I love it and have watched it many, many times. As wacky as the characters are, they feel like people I could know or people I'd like to know. They're endearing. The movie makes you laugh and cry, and like someone else said, there are lines that just stick with you. ""I've had a bad day ... a really bad day,"" Babe says after trying to kill herself three different ways. Somehow this is funny! And the music? I loved it! Every time I watch this movie, I look forward to the theme song and that saxaphone music, especially the part where Babe plays the sax (she's really bad!) in her band costume. It's hilarious! Buy this movie. You will enjoy it and feel closer to your family because of the closeness of these sisters.",1013644800,5,773,4.301369863013699

Tess Harper as Chick and Sam Shephard as Doc round out a superb  cast.

7858081,5,630400463X,"Babe finally understood why their mother hanged that ol' yellow cat along w/her....so's she didn't have to be alone.  Guessing it helps if you either had sisters or family in the South.  Everyone I was ever blood-related to came from Joplin MO while I was born in San Francisco & lived my life on the SF peninsula.  Back there recently/my 3 cousins are my only living relatives.  They were a joy.  But grew-up w/parents born & raised there & I began to understand my ""Southern"" upbringing a long time ago.  Quite enamored w/this film...makes me wanna go live in my grandfather's big ol' 2-story white house & shop at the local Piggely-Wiggley.  Despite some reviews...the casting of the sisters couldn't have been been more perfect & I've always wanted to just take Sam Shepard in my arms.  'Sides my favorite 1945 movie is ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" staring Hurd Hatfield...""their granddaddy"" when he was young & inexplicably gorgeous.",1496534400,,938,4.855345911949685
