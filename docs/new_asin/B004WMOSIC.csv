4487613,5,B004WMOSIC,Mr. Suchet can't be beat as Hercule Poirot!  I think I've now bought most items available and enjoy them all thoroughly time and time again.  He is absolutely fantastic in this long running series.  I think Ms. Christie would have been very happy with this series in general.,1306540800,37,275,4.6875
4487614,5,B004WMOSIC,"David Suchet's Poirot on TV films are adaptations of Agatha Christie's novels--but so well done, both books and TV shows/DVDs have proved classic in their own right. Thus, I avoid comparison of novel to screen. No need, both excellent.
The star casts and guest stars are too numerous to mention. One can't fault acting a half-penny. This release comes hot off the screen of PBS Masterpiece Mystery after original ITV1 in the UK. All 3 adapted stories are each feature length, 89 min. -like going to the theater 3 times.
SUBTITLES ARE included. No bonus material.

Three Act Tragedy
A lovely Cornwall coastal location for a Poirot murder case(s). A parson (Nigel Pegram) one of many at a dinner party drops dead of apparent natural cause. A 2nd Yorkshire party-same guest list-has a 2nd death, the host Tallie (Art Malik-`Upstairs Downstairs'). Hercule helps Sir Charles (Martin Shaw-`George Gently') investigate. Egg (Kimberly Nixon-`Cranford') helps too, or is she suspect? Poirot reenacts the complex and connected deaths under stage lights.
Other stars: Jane Asher (`Wish Me Luck' `Alfie'), Kate Ashfield (`Silent Witness'), Tony Maudsley (`Doc Martin' `Foyle's War'), Anna Carteret (`Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont'), plus.

The Clocks
Five murders plus love at the White Cliffs of Dover, a wonderful backdrop. 1940s prior to WWII but Hitler threatens says Admiral Hamling (Goeffrey Palmer-`As Time Goes By""). The case erupts with the duel death of German mole Annie (Olivia Grant-`Lark Rise to Candleford') and Fiona (Anna Skellern-`Siren'). MI6 Lt. Race (Tom Burke-`Cheri') asks Poirot to help his naval investigation. Evidence implicates typist Sheila (Jamie Winstone) running from the murder site home of a blind lady (Anna Massey-`Darling Buds of May'). Evidence of 4 clocks stopped at 4:13, in flat #19 leads to a complex suspect list and more deaths. It's a wild and often funny neighborhood of characters you will enjoy. Cat Lady Hemmings (Beatie Edney) is a delight and has another best line while trying to encourage Poirot to set in a cat's ""damp"" favorite chair.
Favorite line after Hercule Poirot introduces himself to child Jenny; ""that's not a name, it's a noise.""
Also look for stars: Phil Daniels (Eastenders), Stephen Boxer (Garrows Law), Jason Watkins (`Little Dorrit' `Lark Rise to Candleford'), Lesley Sharp, Sven Hjerson (The King's Speech) and more.

Hallowe'en Party
A crime author friend (Zoe Wanamaker) asks Poirot to investigate the drowning of a child, participant at a Halloween party. She previously claimed to have witnessed a murder. All party guests & their lives are investigated to find this killer as well as the perpetrator of 4 more deaths. Beautiful fall scenes with spooky dark spots too. Amelia Bullmore (Mrs Dalloway), Timothy West (Edward the King), Deborah Findlay (Anglo Saxon Attitudes, Cranford), Sophie Thompson and Phyllida Law (Sis and Mom to Emma Thompson), Fenella Woolgar (Scoop), Julian Rhind-Tutt (Notting Hill, Stardust), are a few of the recognized cast.

It's hard to choose a favorite. Huge casts, excellent screenplay adaptations, awesome original novels by Agatha Christie, unchallenged perfection as Poirot by Suchet, delightful settings, sets, costumes, dialogue, and all that adds up to 5 gold stars. Buy to own, watch frequently. Excellent even after you know who-dun-it!",1305763200,106,3338,5.3282732447817835

4487636,5,B004WMOSIC,"I'm watching the Poirot movies more from the movie collections. This one was more the typical Poirot than series #5. If you like Japp, Hastings, and Miss Lemon, they aren't in these movies, but a SuperSleuth disk in set 4 explained that if they weren't in the book, they wouldn't be in the movie. At least, this was true when Acorn produced them.

The three here include Tragedy In Three Acts, The Clocks, and Halloween Party.

I saw the Ustinove version of the first one (I think that was titled Murder In Three Acts). The stories were similar. Usually, I like Suchet's portrayal better than Ustinov's but like the Ustinove screenplay better. This wasn't the case here -- I consider them close to equals, though Ustinov's was a little more light-hearted. But I think the more serious tone in the final line delivered by Suchet (identical between the two version) to be a better conclusion than Ustinov hamming it up.

The Clocks was a new story to me, and I thought the story was well written -- it even brought some philosophical elements that fit the story's pre-WWII setting but gave one thought for our modern times.

I read Halloween Party a few decades ago, enough to know the basic plot, but not enough to remember the conclusion. It is a little more disturbing than most of Christie's stories because children are among the victims. But again the story was well done.",1419465600,,1376,4.6735537190082646

Agatha Christie's Poirot, The Movie Collection Set 6, consists of three discs, each with one mystery by Agatha Christie the queen of mysteries. The three discs are approximately 267 minutes long; about 1 hour and 29 minutes each. They all star David Suchet playing Christie's favorite sleuth Hercule Poirot. Ariadne Oliver, a best selling writer of mystery novels and Poirot's friend, appears in Halloween Party. They have stereo sound and are in the 16 to 9 wide screen format. These are some of Christies most entangled mysteries, and one, The Clocks, approaches being a blend of  mystery and international intrigue.

The Three Mysteries are:

Three Act Tragedy, (1935) also published as Murder in Three Acts:

Act one begins with a social gathering and dinner at the magnificent house of Sir Charles Cartwright perched high above the sea on a narrow rock out cropping. Charles Cartwright was a famous film actor who had just decided to retire and fill his spare time with a sparklingly beautiful, very young girl who called herself ""Egg"". The Dinner was originally set for thirteen, including Hercule Poirot and his batman Hastings, until Sir Charles's secretary, Miss Milray, who had an eye for Charles, volunteered to join them in order to avoid the unlucky number of thirteen at dinner. Cocktails were served on an open tray and as soon as a drop of the drink touched the lips of the Reverend Stephen Babington he gasped, bent over contoured, and dropped to the floor, dead.

Act two takes place a week or so later, when during a similar dinner party, Sir Charles's friend and psychiatrists dropped dead after taking a sip of his wine.

In Act three, several days later, a nice old lady staying in the psychiatrists clinic dropped dead after taking a bite of a piece of candy from a box that arrived by messenger. Autopsies prove that all three killings were caused by the rarely encountered deadly poison nicotine, a pure liquid alkaloid which causes respiratory failure and paralysis, killing the victim almost instantly. As you may remember Christie was exceptionally good with rare, untraceable poisons. Poirot assembles all of the participants and names the responsible party.

The Clocks: (1963) The mystery takes place at Wilbraham Crescent, just before World War II. A dead man in a grey suit is found in the living room of a blind old lady who works for a near by photographer. The body was found by a typist-for-hire from the Cavendish Secretarial and Typewriting Bureau. There were five clocks in the living room but the blind lady insists that she has only one clock, a cuckoo clock. Poirot has volunteered to help a special section of the British Secret Service and was assigned to this case. He shares the spotlight with Colin Lamb, the son of an old friend. There are more killings and the authorities are stumped but Poirot solves the case, clears the typist-for-hire, and helps her find a husband, Colin Lamb.

Halloween Party (1969): The fatal Halloween party takes place in Woodleigh Commons, which is about 30 or 40 miles outside of London. A thirteen year old girl who had boasted of having seen a murder is drowned while bobbing for apples. Who could have done such a cruel thing? Ariadne Oliver, the famous mystery writer who was a guest at the party, calls on her friend Hercule Poirot to come to Woodleigh and solve the mystery. Amid a large and beautiful topiary garden a number of people have gone missing. Every topiary garden must have a topiary gardener to care for it and this one is always looming among the plantings. Poirot solves the mystery and the solution surprises everyone.

These are three delightful Poirot's by Dame Agatha Christie; they are must have for every collector of the best in British mysteries. Buy them and you will be able to enjoy them with family and friends many times over.",1391558400,4,3849,4.844748858447488
4487666,5,B004WMOSIC,"Now. This is my favorite above all of the Poirot's! I love it from beginning to end! There's so many shady people that you just KNOW are the guilty ones! Unsavory, nasty, pompous and downright despicable! And of course, my favorite Zoe Wanamaker is in it and all above her poor aching head, too! She's such a great character to watch, albeit a little overly pushy for Poirot's liking! But he tolerates her fancies with looks of exasperation and adoration at the same time!
He finds her ""amusing"" to say the least! I love their interaction! It makes the movie!
When the famous writer, Ariadne Oliver finds herself coerced into attending the Halloween Party with her friend, Judith, and then lassoed into staying, (even though she's coming down with the flu!) by the overbearing and manipulative Rowena Drake...You tend not to like her right off the bat! The old bat! Haha! Anyway, a child, Joyce, starts trying to impress Ariadne about a murder that ""she"" saw! Uh-oh! Silly girl! One thing leads to another and Hercule is called in by his friend Ariadne, to solve the murder!
The storyline leads you down primrose paths and beautiful gardens which hide the ugliness of at least six murders!
So many in such a beautiful setting...how can this be?? Hercule intends to find out and as he uncovers the suspects dirtiest secrets that have been buried as deep as the flowers around them, he becomes more and more enraged at their callousness! And the ending...OH!...Sweet, sweet! I say, ""Tear them up and toss their old bones out of the dirtiest recesses of darkness....like the soil around them and just like they've done to their victims!""
He does so with relish and it's as if the guilty almost feel that long sickle of Death itself, whipping about their head and body as they wince at his every revelation about them! Great Protector of Justice that Poirot is, he let's them have it full force! I so highly recommend this to everyone! Sit back and enjoy the fun of just watching Poirot at his finest! I do!!!",1389916800,4,2005,4.698863636363637
4487667,5,B004WMOSIC,"Another great collection of Poirot mysteries.  They're addictive to watch.  In this set, I liked Three Act Tragedy and Hallowe'en Party the most; they best illustrate the depravity and sheer waste behind the motives to take someone's life.  The Clocks was a bit too complicated and purposefully confusing (I haven't read the book it was based upon and after watching the film version don't really want to try wading through something that ponderous).  Still, Poirot (David Suchet) is fun to watch under any circumstance.",1389830400,2,520,5.154761904761905

4487684,5,B004WMOSIC,I purchased these as well as Set 1 to add to my Poirot movie collection. This collection of movies continues the exploits of my favourite detective from Belgium. They are well worth owning to enjoy at your leisure.,1371081600,,214,4.657894736842105

4487691,5,B004WMOSIC,"The numbers of reviews submitted for the various packages of David Suchet's portrayal of Agatha Christie's beloved Belgian detective Hercules Poirot is testament enough as to its popularity, with many going into considerable detail about each episode covered.

I'm not about to clog up the reviews with more of the same. If you know who Poirot is there's no need, and if you don't, many of these other great reviews will fill you in nicely. I simply wish to say that each meticulously portrays the time period (1920s to 1940s before the series reaches its end) as only British productions can, and with actors who do not overplay their roles in sticking as closely as possible to Agatha Christie's books.

As some have noted, the original episodes have more of an Art Deco and often brighter and less-brooding look to them with the semi-regular characters of his aide, Captain Arthur Hastings (Hugh Fraser), his secretary Miss Felicity Lemon (Pauline Moran), and Scotland Yard Chief Inspector James Harold Japp (Philip Jackson), each of whom more or less faded from Christie's books after entering the mid- to late-1930s.

These later episodes, some of which were produced by the A&E Network but still stuck flawlessly to the period in appearance, began to take on a darker side in their storylines (as did her books), with the only recurring characters being George, his valet, and detective fiction writer Ariadne Oliver (played by the brilliant actress Zo Wannamaker).

The only episodes not yet available on DVD are those of the final season, which were filmed the past year - Elephants Can Remember, The Big Four, The Labours Of Hercules, Dead Man's Folly, and Curtain. The last, which brings our favourite detective, now wheelchair-ridden, back to Styles (now a retirement residence), but where it all began, also sees his death.

I have them all to date, and can't wait for these to be broadcast and then finally made available on DVD.",1364428800,3,1942,4.963076923076923

The Clocks: Great choice of actors. (Anna Massey as Miss Pebmarsh was especially good.) However, there were some unnecessary additions and changes to characters, which complicated an already complated story.
Three Act Tragedy: Great story, and one that I don't remember all that well. So I can't comment on how true it is to the original text. I thought the actor who played Sir Charles Cartwright was a little stiff, however.

Actually the entire series6 was a failure as far as I am concerned . A different director? If so he doesn't have a clue about the character in general. Bring back Hastings every now and then. Also I am not comfortable with him having a man servant or a tleast the way he is portrayed. Having George dress him etc. Actually George could be a more valued character . Allow George to be a bit more involved with a bit more light hearted puns every now and then and eliminate the pompous way Poirot interacts with him.

4487728,5,B004WMOSIC,"Poirot Set 6 is a three-feature-film set. And for fans of the show it goes without saying that Poirot starring David Suchet is an exquisite treat; both for the mind, and the senses. Those looking for great films of intrigue done with style and story? Yes, these too should get the set toot sweet.

The delightful films have the fastidious little detective shuttle-bugging about - and he is almost as distracting as the finely woven threads of the stories' often brilliant tapestries. I admit to being smitten with good set design...here it is simply orgasmic. The era is everywhere. Sometimes you (I) must rewind the DVD as people spoke but they were not heard over some elegant piece of furniture, or wall hanging. This is good too, because there's hardly a proper mansteak in the set, and a girl needs visual stimulus, even in a good mystery...

Tragedy in Three Acts is the most visually exciting - era-wise. Here we find Poirot attending a swanky dinner party at his old friend's Sir Charles Cartwright (Martin Shaw) - who is a retired theater star, when viola! Faster than the butler can announce cocktails are being served in the main room, a seemingly natural death occurs. It is not until a month later, when the exact same style of death - with the same dinner guests attending - happens once more, that Poirot's little gray cells begin to twirl. The tie-up is wonderful. Guest stars include Jane Asher, Art Malik, and Kimberley Nixon.

Halloween is very atmospheric, the subject matter a tad disturbing. Poirot is called in to investigate the murder of a child...The local ""witch"" and gossip, has plenty to whisper about her hamlet. Though Poirot detests tales of the macabre, he is like the apple bobbing in the water, until...at last...Hercule has figured it out! The film has a famous female crime novelist Ariadne Oliver (Zo Wanamaker) acting the sleuth. Other cast members include Sophie Thompson, Deborah Findlay, and Amelia Bullmore.

The Clocks has the finest story of the three. Twists and turns that - if you are trying to sleuth alongside Poirot - you may want to rewind a couple key scenes. Everyone (more so than usual) is suspect! Poirot finds himself in the middle of a puzzle within a puzzle - and England's very security may be at the center! Anna Massey guest stars.

The fun part about these films is that if you pay close attention, the clues are there. They are not easy...But each tale is far from cookie-cutter prime-time fare.

David Suchet is Poirot mon ami. It is so lovely when an actor so snuggly fits a role. There have been many in entertainment. These roles where the actor is simply the character; no one else can be pictured; Bogart as Sam Spade in Maltese Falcon, Depp in Pirates, Laurie in House and so forth.

On another level, it is also a comment on actor Suchet's great gift.

The episodes in this new set are superbly crafted and beautifully photographed -- naturally they look better than ever in hi-def.  The detailed settings perfectly evoke the feel and mood of a previous era - a lost yet still with us world when an earlier war was fresh on the minds of most Brits.

The trio of baffling stories, ""Hallowe'en Party,"" ""Three Act Tragedy"" and ""The Clocks,"" are adapted from Christie's classic novels and do not disappoint.

Sir Charles was fun to be around, until one night, at a party at his cliffside house, one of his guests partakes of a dry martini, and moments later, hits the floor ... somehow Egg knows its murder, in spite of the assurances of Poirot, that it is not . . . .

The Clocks (4.5) - On the phone, Navy Lt. Race tells his sweetheart, that she will have to wait 20 minutes, and casually adds, and then you can have me for a lifetime; and now leaden regrets weigh him down; how was he to know her lifetime had less than 20 minutes to go.  She had been following a spy who had stolen a classified Naval map, when she was killed.  He finds a cryptic note in her handbag, an address?  In checking out possible addresses, a beautiful, but frightened girl runs out of a house, straight into his arms; she is hysterical - something about a dead man behind the sofa . . . .

Hallowe'en Party (5+) - The old estate was the perfect setting for hallowe'en; in days of yore, it was the site of a dunking pond to test for those believed to practice witchcraft, but these days, the grounds are better known for their fanciful gardens with pointed bushes like giant dragon's teeth; a spooky place indeed.

""Three-Act Tragedy"", based on the 1934 novel, ""The Clocks"", based on the 1963 novel, and ""Hallowe'en Party"", based on the 1969 novel, have all been set in the 1930s in keeping with the chronology of the television series. Common to the later years of ""Agatha Christie's Poirot"", the color palette is richer, the sets more lavish, and the photography is darker than the airy deco and modernist sets of the series' early years. I'm not a fan of the change. I find the new aesthetic uninteresting and rather onerous. And Poirot's new wide, pointy mustache looks sinister.

Some stylistic flourishes in ""Three-Act Tragedy"", such as the clumsy introduction of the cast of characters and the staging of some conversations as if they were on stage, are unwelcome. ""The Clocks"" is a good story, but an additional mystery having to do with rising tensions with Germany has been added, which I think overburdens the Christie plot. ""Hallowe'en Party"" was one of Christie's later novels and not one of her best. It's sordid and distasteful, but this may reflect sensibilities of the 1960s, the decade in which it was written. There are hints of the strange religiosity the writers have introduced in recent years, but the films in Movie Collection Set 6 are better than those in Set 5. The scripts are not the quality of the early years of the series, but part of the problem there is that Christie's novels are not all of equal quality. Poirot has recovered his good nature after some missteps in the last set. The films are:

Poirot is invited to visit to the home of his friend, the actor Sir Charles Cartwright (Martin Shaw), in ""Three Act Tragedy."" A bevy of Charles' friends from London and Cornwall also attend a cocktail party, where the local vicar, Rev. Stephen Babbington (Nigel Pegram), drops dead after sipping from his martini. No poison is found in the vicar's glass, and Poirot can see no reason to suspect foul play. -Until Sir Charles' best friend, the prominent psychiatrist Sir Bartholamew Strange (Art Malik), also drops dead at a dinner party at his home, this time after drinking port. Sir Charles and Miss Egg Lytton Gore (Kimberly Nixon), a young lady he is courting, assist Poirot in finding the murderer by process of elimination. There are a lot of red herrings, some ill-advised stylistic flourishes, and the killer's motive makes no sense, but reasonably entertaining.

A distraught Lt. Colin Race (Tom Burke) seeks Poirot's advice on a puzzling situation in Dover. While walking down the street there, Colin bumped into a hysterical young woman, Miss Sheila Webb (Jaime Winstone), running from a house where she had discovered a dead man on the floor. It was the house of Mrs. Pebmarsh (Anna Massey), a blind widow, who denies hiring Sheila or knowing the dead man. And Colin is preoccupied with his own grief. He is an agent of MI6, working on plans to protect Great Britain from naval attack, and his girlfriend (Anna Skellern) has just been killed in the process of uncovering a German mole. MI6 wants Poirot's help in recovering sensitive documents, and Inspector Hardcastle (Phil Daniels) of the local police reluctantly accepts it in the murder case. Poirot is in good form, but the plot was not improved by the addition of a second mystery.

Crime novelist Ariadne Oliver (Zoe Wannamaker) has been roped into carving pumpkins by her friend Judith Butler (Amelia Bullmore) in ""Hallowe'en Party"". They are attending festivities at the home of Rowena Drake (Deborah Findley), when one of the children at the party, Joyce Reynolds (Macy Nyman), tells Ariadne that she once witnessed a murder. When Joyce is found drowned in the apple-bobbing barrel shortly after, Ariadne seeks Poirot's help. The local police inspector (Paul Thornley) boasts of his department's modern methods and thinks Poirot should leave the case to them. But Poirot learns of 3 suspicious deaths in the village within the past 5 years which could have been the murder that young Joyce witnessed. The characters in this mystery are generally unpleasant and the solution sordid and over-the-top.",1309651200,67,4340,4.965612104539202
4487742,5,B004WMOSIC,"Agatha Christie's quirky Hercule Poirot knows that he is smart and that his grey cells reveal things to him that other people cannot understand, and he tells this to everyone. In this episode, the Belgian detective solves several murders filled with many complications. England's MI6 is trying to find a spy just before World War II because some people are giving secret information to the Germans. A woman sees secrets being taken and she is killed. Another woman, a typist, is summoned to a house for typing, but the owner, a blind woman, later says she never requested that she come. A man is found dead in this house with four clocks set at 4:13, even though it is 3 PM. One of the four clocks disappears. The police are unable to identify the dead man. Poirot tells the police superintendant that it is not important to find out who he is, but who he is. The superintendant does not know what he is talking about. A third murder, a woman, is killed in a phone booth. She had told a police officer that a woman testifying at an inquest was lying, but she did not say which woman. The MI6 investigator becomes enamored with the typist who had been having an affair with a man in room 413. Poirot reveals what has been going on.",1309219200,8,1230,4.446902654867257
4487743,5,B004WMOSIC,"David Suchet's Poirot on TV films are adaptations of Agatha Christie's novels--but so well done, both books and TV shows/DVDs have proved classic in their own right. Thus, I avoid comparison of novel to screen. No need, both excellent.
The star casts and guest stars are too numerous to mention. One can't fault acting a half-penny. This release comes hot off the screen of PBS Masterpiece Mystery after original ITV1 in the UK. All 3 adapted stories are each feature length, 89 min. -like going to the theater 3 times.
SUBTITLES ARE included.

Three Act Tragedy
A lovely Cornwall coastal location for a Poirot murder case(s). A parson (Nigel Pegram) one of many at a dinner party drops dead of apparent natural cause. A 2nd Yorkshire party-same guest list-has a 2nd death, the host Tallie (Art Malik-`Upstairs Downstairs'). Hercule helps Sir Charles (Martin Shaw-`George Gently') investigate. Egg (Kimberly Nixon-`Cranford') helps too, or is she suspect? Poirot reenacts the complex and connected deaths under stage lights.
Other stars: Jane Asher (`Wish Me Luck' `Alfie'), Kate Ashfield (`Silent Witness'), Tony Maudsley (`Doc Martin' `Foyle's War'), Anna Carteret (`Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont'), plus.

The Clocks
Five murders plus love at the White Cliffs of Dover, a wonderful backdrop. 1940s prior to WWII but Hitler threatens says Admiral Hamling (Goeffrey Palmer-`As Time Goes By""). The case erupts with the duel death of German mole Annie (Olivia Grant-`Lark Rise to Candleford') and Fiona (Anna Skellern-`Siren'). MI6 Lt. Race (Tom Burke-`Cheri') asks Poirot to help his naval investigation. Evidence implicates typist Sheila (Jamie Winstone) running from the murder site home of a blind lady (Anna Massey-`Darling Buds of May'). Evidence of 4 clocks stopped at 4:13, in flat #19 leads to a complex suspect list and more deaths. It's a wild and often funny neighborhood of characters you will enjoy. Cat Lady Hemmings (Beatie Edney) is a delight and has another best line while trying to encourage Poirot to set in a cat's ""damp"" favorite chair.
Favorite line after Hercule Poirot introduces himself to child Jenny; ""that's not a name, it's a noise.""
Also look for stars: Phil Daniels (Eastenders), Stephen Boxer (Garrows Law), Jason Watkins (`Little Dorrit' `Lark Rise to Candleford'), Lesley Sharp, Sven Hjerson (The King's Speech) and more.

Hallowe'en Party
A crime author friend (Zoe Wanamaker) asks Poirot to investigate the drowning of a child, participant at a Halloween party. She previously claimed to have witnessed a murder. All party guests & their lives are investigated to find this killer as well as the perpetrator of 4 more deaths. Beautiful fall scenes with spooky dark spots too. Amelia Bullmore (Mrs Dalloway), Timothy West (Edward the King), Deborah Findlay (Anglo Saxon Attitudes, Cranford), Sophie Thompson and Phyllida Law (Sis and Mom to Emma Thompson), Fenella Woolgar (Scoop), Julian Rhind-Tutt (Notting Hill, Stardust), are a few of the recognized cast.

It's hard to choose a favorite. Huge casts, excellent screenplay adaptations, awesome original novels by Agatha Christie, unchallenged perfection as Poirot by Suchet, delightful settings, sets, costumes, dialogue, and all that adds up to 5 gold stars. Buy to own, watch frequently. Excellent even after you know who-dun-it!

Blu-ray makes blood, coppers, and crime investigation better.",1308873600,3,3382,5.349624060150376
