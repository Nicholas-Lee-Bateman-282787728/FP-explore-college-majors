2307378,4,B0009ORTKG,"I just finished this workout and I have to say it wasn't what I expected. I am training for a 10k and I was looking for an alternative cardio workout. This video was less cardio and more drill oriented, in short it was a lot like basic training with traditional kickboxing moves blended with mountain climbers, pushups and squats. Billy even threw some flutter kicks in. I live on an Army base, so I see people doing this kind of stuff every day and being a personal trainer I've always chided the Army for the jerky, silly looking movements that make up PT time. This workout flows well, however, and you do sweat.

The resistance bands are a must, and you can't buy replacements in the store because they need to loop on your feet for kicks, punches and strength training. Billy works you to exhaustion, and my muscles are shaking despite my personal rigorous weight training workout schedule.

This is certainly a change from the Tae bo I've come to know and I still prefer the Advanced Get Ripped videos for nonstop cardio. If you need to break through a plateau and mix up your workout, this workout is rather original and is guaranteed to tone.",1150588800,,1150,4.550724637681159
2307379,5,B0009ORTKG,"I have been exercising 3-4 times a week with various TaeBo workouts for about seven years. I alternate through about 5 or 6 different advanced level workouts, and find they keep me in great shape. I am in my 40's and my blood pressure, weight, and cholesterol are all great. I would classify this particular workout as advanced. It has a section that uses the bands, although since I don't have the bands, I just use light wrist and ankle weights for resistance in that portion. Using the weights with this and other TaeBo workouts has helped to define my arm muscles (no tricep wiggle at all). There is also a killer section of push-ups, but the main thing I like about this one is the new leg exercise he does. You step forward like you are doing a lunge so both knees are bent and then move up and down using just your legs. Your upper body stays upright. It made my quads, hamstrings, and glutes sore for a week the first time I did it, but it totally gets me in shape for downhill skiing and bike riding. In fact, I have found those two sports quite easy since I started this DVD. This is a great addition to your other TaeBo videos, especially to add variety, strengthen legs, and define arms, but if I could only buy one, I'd still probably pick the Get Ripped Advanced workout. For me, those are still the most fun.",1149465600,89,1323,4.338709677419355

2307388,5,B0009ORTKG,"I have Billy bands from P24/7 but never used them  (always found them awkward ), until now.
This is an awesome workout that will burn your every muscle, in a good way. Try the bands, though you don't have to use them, but certainly increases the intensity. You'll sweat calories! Those 52 minutes go by so fast, there is an abundance of moves in this DVD, you won't get bored. Never thought I'd love the heat in my arms and but so much! The day after you do this workout, expect mad body aches, and I do Tae Bo 6 days a week. This is intermediate to advanced level of workout, especially if you add the band. Am not a fan of warm up, though I know I should( do a minimum of 60 mins par day, so atleast 2 DVDs everyday - crunch for time ).I skip first four minutes and start from the squats, sweating within 10 minutes
Five stars. Biceps, abs and lower body, all in this DVD",1468195200,,873,4.105263157894737
2307389,4,B0009ORTKG,"My skill level: I am pretty good about doing a home workout DVD about 5-6 times a week. I have tried several of Jillian Michael's programs, several in The Firm series, more Beachbody programs than I care to admit, and a few random ones for good measure (obviously Billy Blanks, prenatal workouts, and a few Bellydance). That being said, I am not athletic. I hate working out but do so because it is the healthy thing to do. I would classify my level as ""lower level advanced"". I am certainly not a beginner but by no means am I a super toned athlete.

As a way to kind of organize my own DVD collection, I wanted to go through and rate them all so I can quickly grab exactly the kind of workout I am looking for that day, rather than try to think ""hmm, is this the good ab one or the good thigh one?"". Posting them here on Amazon for all to benefit from. Here goes:

This review is for Billy's Bootcamp: Ultimate Bootcamp. This DVD only has one workout.

Time: Warm-up is 4 minutes, the workout is 45:45 and then the cooldown is 3 minutes for a total time commitment of 52:45

Skill Level: If you do each workout exactly as stated, this is an intermediate workout. That being said, many of the moves could be modified to be harder by adjusting the resistance level.

Equipment: Billy uses his ""Billy bands"" which are two resistance bands, each with a loop for your foot. Since I don't have those (nor plan on buying them) I tried modifying the moves to accommodate a regular band. Though I tried 2 different bands (a light and heavy band) I was not really able to modify them successfully. I then swapped out with weights (I used 15# but that was a bit ambitious) and overall that was an acceptable alternative but keep in mind you won't be getting the added resistance on your lower body.

Breaks: There really aren't any breaks- the closest thing to a break is a brief ""back to marching"" for a few seconds in between some of the moves.

Format:
After the warm-up, the actual workout starts off with some punches, squats, and kicks. By 18 minutes into the workout I was not even out of breath and thinking that this workout would be way too easy.

THEN we started with the bands. Around 22 minutes into the workout there is a resistance section with the bands that lasts around 16 minutes. As I mentioned above, I had to modify with weights. I was starting to feel a lot more optimistic. The overall pace is very rhythmic, with an obvious background beat and the cast members counting in sets of 8 throughout the whole workout. Once you get into the groove of things, the resistance section is actually pretty good.

By 40 minutes in we did some floor work and my glutes were SCREAMING.

As others have mentioned, this is not a very organized workout in terms of the commentary/prompts. Often the ""number of remaining sets"" is off and you don't always do the exact same thing on both sides. The cast members don't always know when it is time to transition to the next move. I also don't get the ""bootcamp"" theme- it seemed more gimmicky than actually similar to any kind of bootcamp. I much preferred Tony Horton's theme in his 22 Minute Hard Corps workouts where he uses actual vets in his cast.

Overall, I am all about efficiency with my time. I want the max amount of results in the shortest amount of time. If the workout started at around 22 minutes in, it would have been a 30 minute intense lower body/resistance workout and I would have given 5 stars. I just honestly don't feel as though the first 20 minutes gave me much. Next time, I'll try it that way and see how I feel.",1466899200,2,3585,4.392156862745098

2307415,5,B0009ORTKG,"I absolutely LOVE Taebo! I've been doing it on and off for the past ten years or more. I started with the original Taebo workout...you know the one I'm talking about,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Billy-Blanks-Tae-Bo-Instructional-Workout-Basic-Advanced-8-Minute-Workout/dp/6305608733/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Billy Blanks' Tae-Bo - Instructional Workout, Basic, Advanced, 8-Minute Workout</a>, only on video cassette. LOL I've since purchased that workout on DVD. In any event, I then got the Billy Blanks BootCamp three DVD set, which included this workout and two others, as well as the Billy bands (loooooove those bands!.) I found I loved the boot camp workouts even more than I did the original ones.  BTW you don't need the bands to do this workout...it can be done with or without them, or you can substituted the bands with wrist and ankle weights.

This particular workout, Ultimate BootCamp is a favorite, because I can get an intense workout in just about an hour, right here in my living room.  It's a great workout for those days when I'm too busy to make it to the gym--or too lazy.  LOL  I haven't done any Taebo workouts in over a year--I quit working out until this summer when I started running again. Now that the weather is beginning to get cooler I decided to break out the Taebo DVDs for those days when it's too cold to run. I was dismayed to discover that my copy of this DVD, as well as the Cardio BootCamp Live! DVD, are nowhere to be found. I refused to be without my workout and promptly found a copy of each here on Amazon. So as much as it disgusts me to have to pay for something I already own, I felt like I had no choice because I know that this DVD will get a lot of use over the next few months.

The bottom line is I love this DVD--so much so that I've bought it twice! It's a great workout for anyone who is looking an intense, heart pumping, sweat breaking, workout without having to leave the comfort of their home.  It's definitely NOT for beginners--as a matter of fact, having not done any Taebo myself in such a long time, I'll probably have to work myself back up to this level.  Happy shopping!",1410825600,7,2187,4.8133333333333335

I was so excited to get it again-love the bandwork-after all these years I still get so sore and sometimes have to take a break. I know Billy has some bad cueing sometimes and I'm honestly not a fan of his newer workouts-this one along with Basic Training Bootcamp,Get Ripped and Bootcamp1&2 are still my favorites. As far as his newer ones-I love CardioSculpt but many of his dvds that came out in the last 5 years are a waste-his older ones are still the best.

2307434,5,B0009ORTKG,"I love this video, it is truly the ULTIMATE BOOT CAMP!! After a workout, you can feel the effects all over...weight starts pouring off when you work out consistently.

2307437,5,B0009ORTKG,"I love the Billy Blanks Boot Camp DVD I purchased on Amazon. The package arrived earlier than expected and even though it was used, was in excellent condition.  I work out with it regularly and am very satisfied that I received a great priced for an awesome product.",1367712000,,266,4.541666666666667
2307438,5,B0009ORTKG,"I used to be intimated by this DVD when I bought it. I started to do it and was left behind but I find that it has helped me build the strength and endurance I need. I did not give up and kept trying to catch up. My results were very quick. I have been cutting quantity on meals because being over 40 has killed my metabolism! My body changed overnight and I have done so many changes and it was always a dead end. It was depressing me! I heard about problems losing weight, but I never had that problem before!

I found that I had to work out harder and this DVD did it. My body reacted quickly and the constant change in movements made my workout more successful all over my body. The first week I did it 3 times and I saw results! I saw the difference in my clothes and figure quick. I began to get compliments which I waited for after all my difficult sacrifices. Finally someone noticed my hard effort and work!

I know it's not perfect, the comment another reviewer made of the poor production could be true. I have other videos that looked super organized and everyone is together, but I have not seen results in my body like with Billy! Billy is acting like he is in a normal class and with normal people. It's all about feeling comfortable with your limits and Billy keeping you motivated to keep trying. Some in his class are more fit than others. It entertains me to see the others trying to keep up with him and their struggle expressions. I can relate to them! I love the simplicity and it makes me feel part of the team.

With diet and the video, I am losing 1/2 pound to a pound every other day. It helps BURN that stubborn FAT! He does make mistakes and lacks a little consistency, but it's real. You feel you are there. You see some of the people he has in his videos make mistakes and get a little tired. All this makes it a more real DVD than an un-real perfection body working out perfect with a perfect routine instructor. The laughter of watching the errors helps me feel its ok. His constant comments and change makes you focus on catching up and losing track of time. I never thought I could finish such an aggressive work out for 55 minutes! I am soaked every time more and more. I forgot to work out,was out of practice 15 years, it kept me moving, focused, and motivated. His goal was to get me moving and he did it.
I am excited and want to do it every day because I am looking better each day. I even lost my binging urges because I don't want to stop the progress of my great figure shaping up. Now I have two family members joining me because of my results. The results in my body have motivated me and I don't plan to stop. Love yourself enough to give it a try and reward yourself with great results :)",1365984000,4,2735,4.185958254269449
2307439,5,B0009ORTKG,"I have few Billy's body workout DVDs. This one I would like to recommend customers to purchase. For myself, a right music for exercise DVD is very important. Music is helping to cheer you up when you feel like to give up and stop doing the exercise. And this ultimate bootcamp will make you sweat a lot! No pain, no gain!

You need the bands for the first part of this dvd which I don't have. I'm sure if I had the bands I would be more sore than I am now. If you don't have the bands it's ok too. I would recommend it for someone who has been doing the Billy Blanks workouts for awhile. A beginner can do it as well but you will struggle. After a few times doing it you'll have it down though. You really have to push yourself, but will see great results.",1358208000,,602,4.025

Billy Blanks does it again, this one focuses more on arms also uses resistance bands but just as good w/o the bands. I like this one but i enjoy the punch combos over the push ups hammer curls etc. Also more squating than he normally does. If he had more of that i'd be totally satisfied. Over all it's still great, just depends on your preference.",1351382400,,426,4.271604938271605

2307445,5,B0009ORTKG,My favorite Billy workout of all time. Great for every body part but you have to do your own counting because he tends to lose count and do an uneven number of reps on both sides,1341187200,,178,3.9722222222222223
2307446,4,B0009ORTKG,"This is a great total body workout despite Billy's poor cueing and bad form, at times. It would be easy for a beginner to intermediate exerciser, to injure themselves if they don't use the correct form and not go as fast as Billy demonstrates with some of the routines. When I do this workout, I will go slower on some of the routines to make sure my form is correct.

I can never do all the 48 push-ups in a row but I try every time (hopefully one day I can).  Also, his counting is way off.  He'll say 1 more set, but it will end up being more like 3 or 4 more sets.  That can be frustrating when your first starting out, but once you do it a few times you know when he's going to do it and you can be prepared.  He also doesn't do both sides equally a lot.  Once you do it a few times you will need to adjust the routine a bit to make sure you're doing the right a left side of your body equally.

I am a dental hygienist and constantly have my arms in the air all day long so there is only so much intensity I can take on my arms, as I'd die at work w/ my arms up for 8 hours). So I actually do not even use the bands and still burned 550 calories in this workout. I do the motions, but I know my limits.

I go to the gym 3-4 times a week and combine cardio and strengthening, which is advocated by the Cardiology Asociation.  I wanted to add another cardio session between gym days or if I could not make it to the gym.

I read someone's comment who called it ""sloopy"".  It feels sloopy because you are not able to keep up, and you are not focusing on your technique.  Even without the bands, it's a challenging workout.  Who cares about the music, if you want better music make your own workout playlist; however, you should be focusing on the workout itself and the techniques that is what matters most.

My fiancee and I love the workout.  We agree that it is a total-body intense workout and we feel great before we start our day, and our bodies are and look tighter than even.",1307491200,5,904,4.463414634146342

That's the first time I ever did kick boxing and found it very fun. Well, I got this video, and it confirmed why I liked it so much. Billy is the best. This video will tone your legs, give you a great sweat, leave you tired but happy and make you wanna come back for more. It's no ride in the park, you have to work hard. I mean it.

One thing though, is that it is not for the true beginner. You should build a foundation first before you start this, and for those who have knee problems be careful because it has a lot of squats and lunges. But, hey, those exercises are great anyways, you will find them in this or any other exercise program because they burn a lot of calories and strengthen your legs.

I like the music, the set, the energy, the motivation that Billy gives you throuout the video. The only thing I would have improve is the warm up and add some stretches, but that's something I just do on my own. Other than that, Love it.",1296864000,,1089,4.037037037037037

The video is about 50 minutes, and you work arms, legs and abs.",1290038400,,350,4.318181818181818
2307466,5,B0009ORTKG,"I bought the boot camp set with the bands a few years back.  I like to do this video when I cant make it to the gym.  Its not extremely difficult but it makes me sweat and def gives you a great work out.  I do alot of intense bootcamp and kickboxing workouts so I would say if you need a good cardio and strength mix then this is a great video.
Make sure you have the bands, they make all the difference.",1285027200,,404,3.8433734939759034
2307477,1,B0009ORTKG,"First let me say that, if you can stand listening to Billy Blanks (who gets UNBELIEVABLY annoying), you will get a good workout. However, it will come at the cost to irreparably damaging your shoulders and knees. His shoulder exercises require lifting bands above the shoulders --something every orthopedist says you should NEVER DO; his leg exercises require constant squatting --another exercise that, if done too often and with repetition, will cause great damage to your knees. After a year doing these tapes, I required cortisone shots to remedy the bursitis to my shoulders and arthroscopic surgery on my knee.

USE THESE TAPES AT YOUR OWN RISK. My advice: good old fashion swimming, running, hiking and SAFE weightlifting will do the trick and cause minimal damage. These tapes will help you lose weight but cause a great deal of damage to your body in the process. Your choice.",1279497600,6,885,4.97972972972973
2307478,4,B0009ORTKG,"I read the other review where the person complained about the production and I can understand his points. Billy does alot of ""are you ready?"" and then doesn't switch the exercise....also he gets a little confusing with the counts at times. This is definitely not as smooth as other tapes.
That said....I have never been this sore after finishing a tape. The cardio pace is definitely slower than on the get ripped series which meant that I got through the whole 55 mins on the first try.... however....the muscle work is MUCH harder on this one.
I think this is a great compliment for the get ripped advanced workouts....just don't get too annoyed with the inconsistencies in Billy's Bootcamp camera talk.",1274140800,,705,4.8347107438016526

2307481,5,B0009ORTKG,"This dvd gets 5 stars because it's an awesome workout. I bought it about 1 1/2 years ago and it still makes me sweat. I rotate between this dvd and about 5 others so I don't get stuck in a rut, but I use this one when I want a really tough workout. The first time I tried it, I couldn't get through the whole dvd! You don't need the Billy bands to do this, I use 5 lb. hand weights (I started with 3 lb. ones). He starts with a couple quick stretches and push ups. Then comes more of a lower body workout with lots of lunges, squats, and kicks. Then he puts on the Billy bands and really works the arms. The killer is the push ups...you basically do 8 sets of 8 alternating between normal and on your knees. I still have trouble getting through these! After a few more arm and cardio moves, you work the glutes, which is a killer. Then come abs and a cool down. This is a full body workout that exhausts your muscles. As you watch the dvd you can even see some of the participants struggling with the workout which makes me feel a little better :)

Cons: Billy...man he bugs me. Something about his personality just gets to me. There's a small part where he's actually singing/rapping along with the cheesy music. But this is a pretty easy fix, I just turn the volume down and turn up the volume on my ipod.",1269561600,,1307,4.125490196078432

I knew bands were needed, but I thought it would still be a great workout without them. There was only one person on the DVD that didn't use bands, and there is no point in doing this DVD without bands. I did the whole 55 minute workout and wasn't even out of breath. Even with the bands, this workout is not kickboxing... not what Taebo should be! I sincerely wish I had saved my  money instead of buying this DVD!",1262304000,5,591,4.139130434782609

This DVD is an intense and demanding 55 minutes of exercise that is very challenging, but it is worth it. Combine it with the ab boot camp and you will be hooked if you take the time to build your strength. Don't be discouraged if you have to stop to get some water or take a break, just keep moving and keep trying.  You will be able to do it within 2 weeks and you will feel the empowerment that hard work and discipline offer you (that wasn't easy for me). Try ""basic training boot camp"" for three weeks before you attempt this advanced one and it will help build your strength and confidence.

A side not: if you are mad, frustrated or disappointed, this workout will help you release some of the anger and transform it into positive energy!",1261872000,2,864,4.3602484472049685
2307485,5,B0009ORTKG,"This video is great. The first day I did it, I could not walk for 3 days. Billy hits all the problems areas and especially those hard to reach areas that really make a difference in your form.  I have been using the video for three weeks and feel great.  My goal is to maintain and tone.  I have already heard many compliments on my tone arms.  My waist has much more definition too.  I you are looking to lose weight, you need to build muscle.  This is the perfect video to alternate with cardio or another video tape like Stott Pilates.

The music in the video is pretty korny, but I'm sure they save a lot of money without having to get rights to 60 minutes worth of songs (if that were the case we'd be paying $100 per Billy video).  Now that i am used to the routine, I put my ipod  on in the back for extra motivation.  My husband even started doing Billy's Bootcamp with me after seeing how challenging this video was (the man who countlessly made fun of Billy for years, and never tried it).  He felt it was more geared towards men anyway.  It was funny when he couldn't walk for 3 days either (mind you, he used to run 10 miles a day before he ran in competition).

It's a great video.  I highly recommend it.  I have been using Billy's tapes since I was 18 years old.  For someone who never exercised, he changed my life.  Now I am a health educator, avid hiker, snowshoer, etc. and always keeping busy.  His older tapes are too easy for my level of fitness now, but this video was just what I needed for the winter months without having to join the gym!",1261785600,3,1564,4.173913043478261
2307486,4,B0009ORTKG,"This is workout mixes cardio-style kickboxing and resistance band training.  This is a good workout if you want an ""all-in-one"" video workout.  It will touch all the major muscle groups and will give you some good cardio.  The video requires resistance bands (two) that should be long enough to put one foot in the bottom and then allow you to do rowing exercises with your hands above your head.  You can substitute light weights but you will want to slow the pace of the exercises down.  This video does not really target the abs very well so you may want to throw in some additional ab work.

The production, however, does feel sloppy. Some of the folks in the back will be out of step and it doesn't feel like there was a good editor involved. If this does not bother you then this is probably a good workout to put in the rotation.
This workout is aimed at an intermediate level exerciser.",1261699200,2,894,4.45398773006135

I did this straight through without the resistance bands.  I would reccomend always trying his videos without the bands first so you know what you're getting into.  The bands add a huge level of intensity, and if you're not familiar with the moves, you might not be able to keep up.

Anyway, there's a brief warm-up, as usual, then right into the workout.  Billy's got a great personality in this one!  You will see him go yell in some of the exercisers faces and make them scream at him, but not to be taken too seriously he remains smiling and motivational throughout.  This video really has it ALL for your body.  You get a mix of cardio, strength/toning for your upper and lower body. This is the most ""bootcamp"" style workout in the series in my opinion.  There is a serious push up portion, where he has you going back and forth between your knees and toes (sorry Billy, I had to do all of them on my knees, and I could still barely keep up!)  There's more at the end, where you do 4 push-ups, roll for 4 and 4 more push ups. Expect a lot of bicep, tricep, chest, and back work too.  For most of those exercises, you can substitute dumbells if you want.  There is a small section where you go down to the floor and do some butt exercises... my buns have never been on fire so bad in my life.  Talk about getting buns of steel.  Towards the end, there is a great ab section.  No rest here, he wants those abs contracted the whole time!

I kid you not, the day after doing this video, I ached all over, but that's the goal, right?  If I wasn't hurting I would think I didn't work hard enough!

Note:  Yes, Billy messes up his counts sometimes, and does things a little uneven, but it's not like it's so terrible that one side is going to be noticeably more toned than the other.  Billy is very intense, in the moment and wants to encourage you and explain the moves to you.  He must forget his counts at times.  It doesn't stop him from being an exceptional instructor!  Work with it.  The music is not crap... if you enjoy the music in his other videos, you will like this.  It's upbeat and has a good workout feel to it and it's not the same song throughout.  Enjoy Billy's spirit as I do.

I have been doing some other Tae Bo videos....mixed with some other types of videos....for many months now but was finally ready to step up to something that would really challenge me.

What I really love about Billy Blanks is that everyone in the studio there doing the workout with him is sweating their you-know-what's off.  I think that is a sign of a good video...when the healthy and fit people are sweating, you know that it is a good one.  I understand that they are under a lot of hot lights in a studio but I have seen many a DVD where no one is sweating and it always leaves me suspect.  In those DVD's I usually don't end up breaking a sweat either.  But Billy is always good for inducing sweat in his own people.....and me as well.

This video was it!!  It is hard and I barely got through my first try.  But I made it through and now it will continue to get easier from here.  It was 55 fast paced minutes. I really liked that he first fatigued your arms and then went on to lower body and even did some floor work and abs.  This workout is well rounded and although, as someone mentioned before, Billy tends to have a little inconsistency here and there....if you do his videos, you just know that is the way of Billy Blanks.

I now alternate this video with another (the advanced Power 90 cardio DVD I used to think was hard but now refer to as my easy workout) and get awesome workouts every morning without having to go out in the cold weather.  Yes, there are some production mishaps where exercises are done at different speeds on each side and commands are called out that aren't right, but so what?  To me, it feels more like a real class with a human instructor that might do the same.  Besides, if you do the workout enough, you'll know what's coming next so you won't be suprised.  I usually switch up the sides I do certain exercises on during the video so the moves that aren't the same on each side will even out over time.
The only thing I don't like is the lack of good cool-down stretching, but I just do that on my own afterwards.  Also, with a 54 minute runtime, it can be a bit tough to fit into my mornings, but I just get up earlier to make it work.
I was already working out regularly and was glad to find something that came close the the high-intensity aerobics class that ended recently at my gym.  I'm always drenched in sweat by the end and more than energized to start my day.  Give it a try, but GET THE BANDS!  They make a huge difference in the intensity of the workout.

2307533,3,B0009ORTKG,"My husband Terry wrote this review after doing the workout for 2 months.

I do this workout 7 days a week, and it is a pretty tough workout. I have seen definite improvements in my stamina and muscle tone. Having said that, this is one of the sloppiest made video workouts that I have ever used.

Billy is very motivating, but he presents this workout without being much concerned about precision or details. You will do one set of repetitions at one speed for one arm or leg, and sometimes the repetitions for the other arm or leg, at times, are either just left out, or sometimes done at a different speed. Billy, very annoyingly keeps saying ""are you ready"". Ready for what Billy? Nothing special comes up, you just keep doing the short routine you are doing. He announces that you are going to do squat thrusts, and you actually just do a set of squats. There is a difference Billy. A few times in the 55 minutes, He tells you ""two more sets"" and then halfway through the second set, he just starts a different sequence, without finishing the one you are on. You watch the people he is leading in the video look confused, and try to catch up with him. The sets are all counted out 1 to 8. Several times He will start something else at 4 or 6. Right in the middle of a set. You can see the others in the video getting confused for a few moments until they see what the heck he's doing. Many times you hear him say, ""one more time"", and you actually end up doing it two or three more times. The number of repititions are fine, just don't tell me we are going to do one more, when we are actually going to do three. It is confusing and sloppy. It appears that the people he is leading in the video, have never done this routine before, or if they have, he's changing it as he is going along, so they don't know where he's going this time. Sometimes the group starts together, most of the time they don't.

The music is crap. It barely qualifies as a rhythm track. It sounds like it was done with an electronic drum machine and someone trying to use a keyboard. Several times the music track changes right in the middle of a set. Very annoying.

After a few days of doing this workout, you find yourself getting really ticked off with how amateurish this production was done.

 As I said at the beginning, I still do the workout 7 days a week, but I find myself yelling at the TV when Billy says something like ""keep moving, hold that position"", while you are in the middle of an 80 second squat. Billy, I can't keep moving when I'm in a frozen position. I also get annoyed when he says ""walk it out"" and at that moment I'm on my back having just finished a set of leg lifts. Billy, I can't walk it out, I'm laying on my back.

I do have to admit that my anger at the sloppy production sometimes helps me a bit, because I use that anger to help me do a more strenuous workout.

All in all, It would be really nice if it was a professionally done video, but it is not. Instead, you get something that a high school class could have done much better. If you can ignore how poorly this was produced, you can get a very very good workout, and Billy seems like a really nice guy.",1170547200,79,3174,4.200328407224959
