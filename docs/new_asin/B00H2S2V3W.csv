6129576,5,B00H2S2V3W,My son bought this DVD and he loves it.  He recommend this if you love Tim Hawkins and John Branyan.,1395187200,2,100,4.0
8629298,3,B00H2S2V3W,"I was disappointed with this concert. I had seen Bob Smiley on Tim's Hawkins Rock Show Comedy Tour, and his comedy there was genius. However, I think Bob is best handled in small bites, not a full concert.",1499299200,,205,4.421052631578948
8629299,1,B00H2S2V3W,"I only laughed once.  Smiley has a lot of hostility that comes through in his ""comedy"" and his delivery was scattered and frenetic, as if it were his first time performing, which I know it wasn't.  He was funny as a sidekick on a Tim Hawkins DVD, but didn't do well on his own show.
Also, this DVD wouldn't play on my TV's DVD player, though it would play on a personal DVD player.",1498608000,,381,4.135135135135135

8629301,5,B00H2S2V3W,Great Christian comedian! I had never heard of him until I started listening to Mark Lowery on Pandora. He even gives a definitive message on the gospel. I just ordered his Uncaged DVD expecting more of the same.,1457913600,2,212,4.605263157894737
8629302,4,B00H2S2V3W,"Bob Smiley is very funny! He had a segment on YouTube, would love to get that...has been taken off...wonder if there's a DVD for that one. Would love to have it.",1439164800,,161,4.225806451612903
8629303,3,B00H2S2V3W,"Not as funny as other times, but still enjoyable. Somewhat hard to follow along.",1433289600,,80,4.785714285714286
8629304,5,B00H2S2V3W,"We heard of this guy from a Tim Hawkins' DVD and we were laughing just as hard as we do with Tim! He has a totally different style, but sooooo ridiculously funny!! Can't get enough! We could easily watch this over and over and over again.",1427241600,,238,4.195652173913044
8629305,1,B00H2S2V3W,"Terrible!  I've seen him live before and he was pretty funny, but this seemed like he was a beginner and was nervous",1418083200,,116,4.2727272727272725
8629306,4,B00H2S2V3W,Funny and entertaining. Bob has a way of taking every day life events and turning them into hilarious one-liners!,1410825600,,113,5.0
