I watch this  movie at least twice a day and I would personally reccomend it to  everybody.",957830400,,453,4.232558139534884
425410,5,630211702X,"This movie got such bad reviews in its theatrical release that I never saw it until one night stuck at a friend's, housesitting..and since I love Goldie Hawn I decided to pop it in.  I was NOT disappointed!  Goldie is at  her comedic best, but it is Kurt Russell and the cast of very talented kids  that provide the most laughs.  This movie is a hilarious romantic comedy  and you will love it.  It's not quite as funny as ""Foul Play"" but  very funny moments abound.  Get it, you won't regret it!",957744000,,496,4.304347826086956
425411,5,630211702X,"The first time I saw this movie, I had no idea Goldie Hawn was in it.  I surfed TV and came across this movie already in progress showing a rich,  arrogant evil looking woman  verbally cutting this poor carpenter(Kurt  Russell) to the quick. It was several scenes before I realized ""That  was GOLDIE HAWN???"" I didn't even recognize her!!  The most incredible  transformation I have ever seen.  She is a great actress no matter what  anyone says. One of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  And it really  adds to it to know Kurt Russell and Goldie are lovers in real life.!",941068800,,576,4.495145631067961

425413,5,630211702X,"Movie begins with an opportunity to view life of the too rich,too bored,to be happy couple that are accidently marooned on their elegant yacht, awaiting repairs. Goldie the wife decides to hire a local carpenter to build  new closets. Douglas is  the man she hires,then fires without pay.then he is  pushed overboard. When Goldie by accident also goes overboard her husband  leaves her to  her fate. Stricken with amnesia due to the fall a T.V.  broadcast alerts Douglas of her plight. He claims her as his wife to get  revenge. She is now deposited in his shoddy life as the reluctant and  doubtful wife,mother,cook and housekeeper to this misbehaving family.  This movie takes its audience through every  emotion  possible. Envy,empathy,laughter and a few tears. Great story and a happy  ending.",915667200,4,797,5.046153846153846

425477,4,630211702X,A fun movie with a good moral lesson. True happiness does not come from wealth and indulgences. True happiness comes from being engaged with life and discovering The gifts you have to contribute to life.

425480,5,630211702X,"Joanna Stayton (Goldie Hawn) is an obscenely wealthy, married socialite with nothing to do but languish in her large yacht, painting her nails in an array of skimpy bathsuits.

Then disaster strikes:

Joanna needs some additions made to her closet, and for this she calls Dean Profitt, a struggling, happy-go-lucky carpenter with four boys to raise, and no wife to help him.

After he's finished doing two days worth of work, Joanna complains that the wood is oak instead of cedar, and every carpenter who knows his salt should be aware that closets are made out of cedar not oak.

On these grounds, she refuses to pay Dean what she owes him, and when he protests, she throws him, and his tools overboard.

Dean vows revenge, but never dreams he'll get it...until Joanna has an accident, falling out of her yacht, and washing up on shore in Dean's tiny little town with amnesia.

And though Joanna's husband (Edward Hermann) is perfectly capable of reclaiming his wife, he chooses instead to seize the day, and go on a pleasure cruise with a group of starlets, clearing the way for Dean to get his revenge.

Bursting with plans to get back at her, he eagerly reclaims his ""wife"", and makes her the keeper of of his little shack, and the mother of his four rowdy boys.

He makes her sleep on the couch because of her "" bad back"", and insists that not too long ago she was big as a balloon, therefore she has to wear dresses that are hideous, and twelve sizes too big.

The story may seem predictable but it is, in fact, rather wonderful.

It's funny, it's bright, and it has a surprising amount of subplots to make it interesting.

There's even a legend about two lovers, and the sea which is where the title of this review came from.

The direction by Gary Marshall is excellent.

And the chemistry between Goldie Hawn, and Kurt Russell really makes the movie.

Edward Hermann really adds in his cameo role as the dissolute husband.

Wonderful movie. One of my favorites. Really a nice surprise!

About halfway through it got so bad that I had to start laughing and text my friend who also liked that movie like, what the hell were we smoking?!  So you can understand how relieved I was after watching this movie to know that it is still as great as I remembered it was watching it play on TV back when I was a kid.  Such a great cute and funny movie.  My favorite LOL part was the psychologist in the yacht when he goes ""well, I was hungry""  or something like that.  HA!",1517270400,,566,3.9646017699115044

425597,5,630211702X,"It's a true classic - a modern version of Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew"".  Goldie Hawn plays a spoiled, rude, and wealthy woman married to a spineless man.  she's used to ordering people around and treating them like dirt.
She meets her match in the blue-collar Kurt Russell, a carpenter hired to remodel the closet on her yacht.
I won't say more to spoil the plot, but highly recommend watching this if you've never seen it.  If you have, it's one of those movies you don't mind seeing again and again.",1516838400,,508,4.56043956043956
425598,5,630211702X,"The fact that they're remaking this timeless classic and switching the gender roles pisses me off.

425735,4,630211702X,"I've never had or ever met someone that had amnesia, at least not that I can remember; but in movies, sitcoms, soap operas, and cartoons it is a fairly common everyday occurrence with a lot of people apparently walking around the streets that can't remember who they are-- such as Fred Flintstone, Herman Munster, Felicia in General Hospital, Gregory Peck in Spellbound, and now Goldie Hawn in this movie. Most of the time people get amnesia when a large rock, frying pan, coconut or bowling ball hit them on top of their head, but this time Goldie Hawn is a rich heiress who (after earlier in the day stiffing worker Kurt Russell his money for building a rotating shoe rack in her closet) falls overboard from a yacht and wakes up in an Elk Cove hospital with amnesia from being in the ocean over night.
In Elk Cove, release of amnesia patients by hospitals and the police chief is not too stringent, and Kurt Russell's sole means of identifying Goldie Hawn to extract his revenge and gain her into his custody, is a small strawberry-like birthmark on her butt (which earlier in the movie the actress seems to proudly display by walking around and bending over showing her bare ass-- not that I'm complaining).
The rest of the movie is about the burgeoning romance between amnesiac Cinderella (Goldie Hawn) and Kurt Russell, who is a down on his luck widow father of four boys, but he has dreams of striking it rich by building and owning a putt putt golf course.
As implausible as the movie's plot devices are, it still is an enjoyable movie and a good date night film. I enjoy both Russell and Hawn as actors (in this and other movies) and the strong chemistry between the two helps overcome the weaker aspects of the film. Also, how did Edward Hermann get typecast into being a rich pompous buffoon who cheats on his wife in orgies with several beautiful floozies (Overboard and Intolerable Cruelty).
I must note the Randy Newman song Something Special that ends the movie; for some reason, this song always brings a tear to my eye and it would have been nice to place it earlier in the movie when Russell and Hawn fall in love at her pretend Birthday.
I also wish that the movie had opened with Russell and his four boys at the funeral of his first wife. This would have given the movie more emotional depth and resonance.
This movie actually deserves three stars but I give it four stars for the two main actors.",1500940800,,2418,4.560919540229885

The blu ray seems a bit clearer with better sound than the standard DVD we owned, but not worth buying unless you love the movie or you don't have a standard DVD copy.  The images are very clear.  The color is excellent.  The sound is vibrant.  Garry Marshall always does great directing for these romantic comedies.  There are no extras on this blu ray version.  This blu ray DVD is not authored with ""resume play"" so each time you stop it, it starts over from the beginning.

Not sophisticated, but okay for families with children over about 9 whose parents are not offended by PG to marginally PG-13 films.  One of the few comedies that most enjoy repeatedly, if not seen too often.  Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell seem to be having as much fun as the viewer is likely to have.

Comedy with a twist of karma & romance all wrapped into 1 movie.

A rich snob hires a carpenter (of course she has to snub his appearance) to ""fix"" her closet. Since nothing can appease her she complains about it & fails to follow through on the contract.
Well in a sudden change of circumstances after an accident,  the carpenter decides to get paybacks. He brings her to his home, where he & his 4 boys moved to sometime after his wife passed away, where she believes the boys are her children & doing crazy household chores.

Watch the movie to see the comedy & romance unfold.",1464048000,2,610,4.428571428571429

Needless to say, we had lots of blank Salem VHS tapes. Thanks mom! Anyway, I digress.  My daughter is now 16 and is on kick of watching 80s movies. She had never heard of this one so of course I had to find it and buy it for her (because who knows where all those piles of movie tapes went that I had years ago growing up).",1460937600,,610,3.959349593495935

426772,3,630211702X,"Classic kurt russell comedy from the 80's OVERBOARD
gets a new blu-ray reissue my MGM/20TH CENTURY FOX, tragically 20th century fox/MGM
did not want to spend the cash to get new interviews with Kurt russell, Goldie Hawn or Director Garry marshall
which is not surprising
otherwise there would be a making of retrospect featurette on the film
or an Audio commentary with Director Garry marshall at least
so there is only the usual Theatrical trailer of course
, the only thing MGM made an effort with is the picture quality & a new sound mix that's it
the HD transfer given for the film in 1:85:1 ratio is very Good but only just
it's slightly better quality than the old Digital remaster transfer from many years ago
so there's still some Grain & Dirt in the quality, but better quality than the old dvd version anyway which has a worse transfer
the sound mix/Audio mix is very Good in 2.0 master audio stereo mix, so it's better sounding than the old dvd quality
amazon are selling this for $10 which is a ripoff in my opinion considering there are no new extras
but the HD transfer is very good picture quality better than the old dvd so probably is worth $10
it's worth the cash to buy the blu-ray version, not the very old dvd version
4 stars for the film, about 3 stars for this new blu-ray based on new transfer & new sound mix",1459296000,,1333,4.4227642276422765

427081,5,630211702X,"A classic 80's movie that is reminds of me a bit of Cinderella. Goldie Hawn plays a rich hieress named Annie who is so spoiled and nasty that no one can stand to be around her. She was raised to be that way by her mother who basically babies her. Married to a man she doesn't love and who doesn't love her, her life is quite miserable even though she appears to have it all. Kurt Russell's character Dean is her prince but instead of being rich and living in a castle is a poor widowed carpenter with four boys. Though they detest each other at first fate intervenes and changes their lives forever. Annie falls overboard while on her yaht and ends up with amnesia and Dean comes up with the perfect plan that will allow him to get payback for her harsh treatment of him. However, neither one expects to fall in love with each other. What I loved most is that Annie learns what it feels like to struggle and what poverty really is. As Dean and Annie get to know one another he soon discovers that behind the rich girl facade Annie is really a nice person who can be quite caring. A very excellent comedy/romance that I never get tired of watching.",1451260800,,1147,4.290322580645161

427187,5,630211702X,This is a great Comedy! Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell this is a worthy Comedy tandem. Goldie Hawn played brilliantly the role of a spoiled money ladies. She used to live on all ready and spend massive money. Probably she would have lived in vain if she had not met a gruff but honest laborer. This workaholic brilliantly played by Kurt Russell. Of course he used a sophisticated method and he had a good laugh over a spoiled lady. But this was a paradox! Because this was only the beginning of this long-awaited love.,1444867200,,516,4.5

If you are looking for an upgrade in picture/audio from your DVD (or VHS) you'll be bitterly disappointed.  There is NOTHING here to recommend this purchase.

The picture/transfer is muddy and grainy.  The audio is a routine 2.0 mix.  Now, let's be real - this isn't a movie that had many uses for surround sound - however, it would have been a nice surprise.

Overall - just keep your old DVD/VHS copy and wait until these movie companies decide to release REAL upgrades.",1438646400,4,517,4.565217391304348

427577,4,630211702X,"Garry Marshall, brother of Penny and writer/producer of such fare as The Odd Couple, Happy Days, Mork and Mindy, and Laverne and Shirley (starring his sister), takes real life couple, Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell and throws them together as Joanna, rich snobby beyotch, and Dean, poor carpenter.  When a falling out occurs, Joanna takes her yacht and boogies.

Life throws Joanna a curveball as she's dumped over the side and suffers amnesia.  Dean comes to the rescue but decides to play a little payback convincing the now blank-slate of a mind ""Annie"" that she is Dean's wife.  Saddled with four young'uns of his own, Dean turns Annie into loving wife and mom.

The chemistry between the two is fortunately real as you know what's going to happen long before the end of the movie.  That's not really the point.  The point is that this movie is fun.  Hawn is her bubbly, lovable self while Russell is his own kind of charming.  Overboard will win no prizes for originality but you'll easily watch it again.",1433808000,,1008,4.714285714285714

Give a Rated (G) version.  Goldie Hawn and Kirk Russell are really good together and you can easily see why the fell for each other.  The movie is good but for me the language spoils it.,1417564800,,360,4.202898550724638

428157,5,630211702X,"I may have seen this movie a dozen times or more but it never fails to entertain.  Whether alone or with my children as they grew up ""Overboard"" was a guaranteed good evening.  It's a feel good movie that reiterates the adage that 'money can't buy you love' or happiness--a lesson I wanted my teens to learn.  Joanna, played wonderfully by Goldie Hawn may be a spoiled woman but it's 'Annie', the amnestic 'overboard' heiress that we come to love in the movie. She becomes the Mother we all wish we were: the staunchest defender of our children, the one who cuts the crust off their sandwiches & tucks them in every night.  As Dean, played by Kurt Russell grapples with his growing love for Annie he is also guilt ridden about perpetuating the lie about her identity.  Kurt Russell & real life 'life partner' Goldie Hawn are perfect together. This is not a 'deep' movie with intricate plot twists & complicated characters. If you want that watch Hitchcock.  This is  Garry Marshall at his best so pop the popcorn, get the fire going & enjoy!",1416096000,2,1041,4.564516129032258

428261,4,630211702X,"""Overboard"" (1987) is a solid romcom about a backwoods carpenter (Kurt Russell) who may or may not despoil a rich biyatch (Goldie Hawn) after she goes overboard on her yacht and gets amnesia.

The contrast between life on the yacht and life in the backwoods and the respective people thereof keeps the story from being one-dimensional. Both Russell and Hawn are in their prime here, even though Hawn was 41 during filming. She's a fun girl and looks great in a risqu one-piece bathing suit and, later, tight jeans. Roddy McDowall is his usual entertaining self as the butler of the yacht and Katherine Helmond plays the rich biyatch's mother.

The plot is predictable and, yet, you want it to play out the way you know it's going to. The movie's nothing great, but it's entertaining enough and, almost, inspiring in that it makes you believe in the power of redemption for ANYONE.

The film runs 112 minutes and was shot in Newport, Oregon, and California.

There are some vexing moral issues with its plot, however.  Kurt Russell basically kidnaps Goldie Hawn from police custody and holds her against her will. It seems likely he would have been arrested after the truth came out.  The issue of consensual sex is quite mirky since she was not in her right mind during the act.  Now I wouldn't change one scene in this classic flick, but there are issues to ponder here. You know that there are parts of this film where you're thinking, ""I dunno if this is right!""  No one in today's film industry would dare attempt make a movie like this that is so funny yet controversial.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: This 1987 screwball comedy OVERBOARD is an incredible study of star power, displaying how a few seasoned professionals can take a limp script and turn it into something unremarkable, yet completely palatable. Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn are truly the only reasons to keep watching this otherwise flaccid comedy, which feels static when it should zing and oppressive when it should soar.

Trapped in Elk Cove, Oregon while her yacht is docked for repairs, spoiled heiress Joanna [Goldie Hawn] hires strapping carpenter Dean Proffitt [Kurt Russell] to construct a new closet for her shoe collection. On-board, Dean bears witness to Joanna's bully behaviour, a shrill routine of snobbery soon turned on him. When Joanna is knocked off the boat late one night, she awakens in a local hospital, unable to recall the details of her life due to trauma. Dean Proffitt, sensing an opportunity to take back what's owed him, convinces Joanna that he's her husband and his squalid home with  four children is her family. Unsure, but unable to protest, Joanna is introduced to the ways of housewifery, while Dean Proffitt works to keep the scam going while tending to a few professional opportunities.

OVERBOARD is a gentle romantic comedy, directed by Garry Marshall in passive, unfunny manner that would come to define his career. The filmmaker is searching for a classic Hollywood feel for the material and scripted by Leslie Dixon, arranging a battle of wills between Joanna and Dean Proffitt, set loose inside an amnesia premise that's only moderately tended to. In fact, there's barely a reason for Joanna's misfortune at all, but who am I to stop the progress of monkey business.

The majority of the feature is devoted to Joanna's domestic deliverance, spotlighting her attempts to tame this family of undomesticated rapscallions while working inside a dilapidated home, a filthy backwoods abode Dean Proffitt almost seems proud of the situation. Feeds lies by the un-showered clan, Joanna is shoved into a life she doesn't recognise, faintly recalling her time with privilege, yet confronted with doctored photos of her life with Dean Proffitt, while facing four horrifying reminders of her once potent sexual prowess.

The comedy emerges from Joanna's mortified reactions and Dean Proffitt's frantic scheming, yet Gary Marshall is only interested in the surface elements of the sneaky imprisonment, turning rural Oregon into deep Kentucky to display a redneck wonderland of beer consumption, water barrel dunks, and working-class dreams of miniature golf. OVERBOARD moves along like it has somewhere to go, yet halfway through the picture, it suddenly dawns that this is it. Just some mild animosity, playful fibbing, and the slow dance of love, as the lead characters gradually move from shock to romance, with Joanna creating a home Dean Proffitt and boys grow to adore, finally receiving a sense of discipline that's been absent for far too long. With Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn out front and centre, OVERBOARD enjoys their easy chemistry and amusing comedic timing. Playing stereotypes, the actors serve up pronounced behaviour and bug-eyed reactions superbly. Kurt Russell alone is a convincing jumble of ambition and anxiety as Dean Proffitt nervously covers his tracks to keep Joanna disoriented. He's terribly fun in the role, finding the right he-man tenor to best accentuate Hawn's articulation of confusion. Her bookend scenes as a spoiled brat are colourful, creating a perceptible arc to the character and her frazzled sense of location.

Blu-ray Video Quality  OVERBOARD is another recent batch of generic catalogue titles released in the UK by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. Presented in its proper 1.85:1 aspect ratio for the first time, the image at first looks like it might be decent: the opening credits roll and the red-coloured font shouts ""Hey, check me out!"" And, just as soon as that happens, it stays like that: decent. There's a layer of grain sets in that never goes away, plagued the remainder of the movie and preventing any improvements in this 1080p image transfer from really being seen (providing they were there to being with, that is, it looks as if 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in the UK didn't put a whole lot of effort into this release). On the plus-side, it's still a lot better than the old inferior NTSC DVD release.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound mix is a competent blend of music and dialogue exchanges, with a frontal push for voices, though the actors sound a little bit on the thin side, lacking a substantial weight to reinforce their comedic efforts. Soundtrack cuts and scoring cues sound bright and eager, providing depth to the track and supporting mood when called upon. Atmospherics are detectable for outdoor encounters and bar scenes, but are limited by design. Low-end is minimal. In short: a good comedy film release and of course OVERBOARD is a fun throwback to the Screwball Comedy, one that not only went by unnoticed when first released, but that went by just as unobserved by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in the UK restoration experts.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Theatrical Trailer [1987] [2:00] It is such a shame that they could only come up with this Trailer, I would of thought with these two main major stars, they could have had some behind-the-scene documentary or better still, been able to interview Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell, especially as they are a real-life couple.

Finally, OVERBOARD is a really enjoyable fun rollicking film and enough if taken on its own unambitious terms. Hawn is a hoot, especially in the opening scenes, and she and Russell have great on screen chemistry. The film itself is a mishmash, a sort of warmed over sitcom that has just a hint of the smarmy in its main conceit. This Blu-ray image is very passable, but fans of the film will probably delight that at least it's framed correctly in its aspect ratio presentation. The performances of Goldie Hawn particularly and Kurt Russell who make the best reason for watching OVERBOARD and you will have endless hours of fun with repeat viewing, but it's certainly no masterpiece, but despite this I personally think it is a definite classic screwball comedy and Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell work so brilliant together and I have loved this film ever since its cinema release and I am so pleased I waited for this Blu-ray release, as both these actors are up there with my massive List of favourite actors and so happy and pleased to add it to my ever expanding Blu-ray Collection, especially with these two fantastic stars. Highly Recommended!

429147,5,630211702X,"The plot is about a rich, spoiled woman stranded in Elk Snout in her yacht due to engine issues.  While there, she engages Russell to do a closet remodel. Their relationship is contentious, and when he finishes the job, she stiffs him because he built it out of oak instead of cedar. He's shocked, because she never asked for cedar. In their argument, she throws his tools overboard and fires him.  Boat is fixed, and off she goes.  Shortly thereafter, though, she returns to the deck to retrieve her ring and falls overboard, suffering a small head injury or shock which drives her amnesia. Her jerk of a husband does not claim her, opting, instead, for a chance at freedom and promiscuity.

Russell sees a TV news article about her and decides to claim her as his wife and the mother to his three irrascible boys. He is a single father who works too much to discipline his boys, clean his house, etc., so Hawn finds herself in a pig stye with out of control brats.

Except they all fall in love with each other.

All situations must be righted, though, and the husband returns, and Hawn discovers she was duped.

This movie is very genuine, due not only to the real-life love relationship between Hawn and Russell but also to the casting of the kids and Russell's best friend.  It is sweet, light, and poignant, and it will keep you in the seat until the last waves roll by.",1379980800,3,1376,4.476

But, as they say, ""The rich are not like you and me"".  The developing story of how Goldie's character grows is sweet and I found myself more and more rooting for her.  But it is a bit sappy and predictable in its relationships and plot.  So if you are sick of the massacres and wars in the news and you want a bit of escape--and you are not demanding a lot from the script or the plot, then give it a try.",1368403200,,580,4.097345132743363

429719,4,630211702X,Goldie Hawn makes me laugh. I like movies that entertain and this one certainly is timeless. Dean Proffitt has an ulterior motive in rescuing rich Joanna Stayton from the psychiatric ward after she refuses to pay him for carpentery work he did on her yacht and ends up falling in love with her. They are from opposite ends of the financial spectrum without a hint of uniting. Fairy tale love if I ever saw it. My one disappointment is that there were no extra/deleted scenes to watch. Goldie and Kurt are the ultimate love sponges.,1361750400,,531,4.6

You're not supposed to take it that seriously, it is for a good laugh.  Lighten up.  The chemistry between Kurt and Goldie is intense.

Four because of the excellent chemistry between Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn; a genuinely funny premise (""riches to rags""); outstanding physical comedy with some spot on delivery; and Goldie Hawn is a fabulously beautiful lady.  Three because of predictability and contrivance; the four child actors get downright annoying; and (yet) another stereotypical depiction of the filthy rich.  (If you go by Hollywood all evil one percenters never work a day of their lives and exist in a setting of outrageous luxury while saying insensitive and silly things.)  So trying to decide how many stars to give OVERBOARD presented an interesting dilemma for moi.  Hawn's looks tip the scale.

Russell should do more comedy and Russell and Hawn should work together more; again, the chemistry is terrific and believable and fluid and natural.  I realize this film was made over a quarter of a century ago, but given the right project this pair could knock another one out of the park.  If you haven't caught OVERBOARD on cable, or rented it, give this comedy a viewing.  It will definitely be worth your while.

Goldie plays a duel role. First, as a wealthy heiress; disinterested in those around her, including the character that Kurt Russell plays (a carpenter).

Kurt vows to get even by taking her in, boasting to his friend that he will work off the debt she owes at the rate of twenty-five dollars a day.

But something good happens. Russell tells her that his four sons are also her sons and that she has been his wife all along. The laughs get bigger, the comedy expands as she grapples with the situation.

This is a classic Goldie Hawn movie with a lot of laughs and yet a serious message. She plays a pampered rich girl and she does it so well it makes me laugh. When she is taken home to Kurt Russel's messy house and unruly kids; it makes me laugh as she tries to control the chaos.

Of course, the basic theme of the movie is that money can't buy you happiness and that true happiness is with your family. And there are some minor themes of service and family running through this as well.

429977,3,630211702X,"Among the films I can easily remember growing up as a teen and seeing it played over and over on HBO, it was the 1987 film ""Overboard"" starring Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell.  And with a lot of talk about the upcoming remake starring Jennifer Lopez and Will Smith, it doesn't surprise me that the film is now being released on Blu-ray.

""Overboard"" is one of Director Gary Marshall's (""Pretty Woman"", ""Beaches"", ""Runaway Bride"") earlier films, written by Leslie Dixon (""Mrs. Doubtfire"", ""Hairspray"", Limitless"") that was a flop in the box office but pretty much became a cult film because of its popularity on cable and even 25-years-later, I still see this film while channel surfing late at night and I have no doubt in my mind that people of today's generation are enjoying this late '80s film.

VIDEO:

""Overboard"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:85:1).  First, its important for me to mention that a lot of  late '80s and also early '90s films were not shot with great film stock.  In fact, more than likely you will noticed certain catalog titles looking its age in HD.  For ""Overboard"", you will notice that there is a good amount of grain but also a lot of noise and also a look that is not exactly the most pristine and shows its age.

With that being possibly the bad news, the good news is that the film looks much better than what one would see on television, on VHS and on DVD.  The other good news is that there are many scenes that actually do look good and brings out the detail of the film.  While the opening title sequence may look its age, as the film progresses, it actually looks much better.  Granted, you will see white speckles from time-to-time but one thing where this film is fortunate is that most of it is shot outdoors and thus the sunlight really makes certain scenes come out vibrant.

So, if you really love this film, Blu-ray is the way to go!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Overboard"" is presented in English 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish Mono and French Dolby Surround.  The soundtrack is front-channel driven.  Dialogue and even the '80s synth music comes out quite clear.  Overall, it's a good lossless soundtrack but I chose to watch this film with stereo on all channels (set on my receiver) for a more immersive soundscape.

Subtitles are in English, Spanish and French.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Overboard"" comes with the original theatrical trailer.

JUDGMENT CALL:

One thing that I remember about this film is when I was a teenager was that I felt that Goldie Hawn was a hot actress and with her and Kurt Russell being a real-life couple, that the two had amazing chemistry.

Watching it in 2011, Goldie Hawn looks beautiful in the film and interesting to see how Goldie back then and her daughter Kate Hudson (today) look so much alike and yes, she and Kurt Russell have amazing chemistry and for the most part, despite the film is a popcorn romantic comedy and as many critics have called it an updated ""screwball comedy"" with a redneck attitude.

Some love it, some hate it but at the time, when one of the younger children spoke like Pee-Wee Herman, maybe today it seems a bit overplayed but heck, even back then...everyone tried to speak and laugh like Pee-Wee Herman.  Granted, parents probably may have not liked the stereotypical portrayal of the redneck family, especially with the young kids talking about a woman's bodyparts and looking at nudie magazines but the sex jokes and overall comedy was not for the refined movie-goer.

And probably that is why this film had so much success on cable.  At the time, Americans were more in-tune of what was coming out from the more younger crowd ala the Brat Pack talents during the late '80s and Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell were not an exciting box office pairing (their previous film ""Swing Shift"" back in 1984 also didn't do that well).  But like many Americans, once this film started showing up on cable TV, it was watched many times.

And the intriguing thing about this film is that if you bypass the critic reviews for this film, you will see so many people who actually gave the film high ratings within the last 25-years.  And personally, I don't think this film can be remade it today's society, especially with the kids talk about T&A so freely.  It's not going to happen.  So, I can only imagine the remake being tailored for modern sensibilities and it'll be interesting to see how far the remake will go.

But most importantly, what made this film work is because both Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn have great chemistry and the fact that they were a real life couple, the characters seemed real and convincing.  Because these two talents are in love, you can tell on film that the characters that they play are really in love.  It's all in the details and the emotions and it made this film quite enjoyable.

For parents who watched the trailer, bare in mind,  this is definitely not a family film.  Granted, the banality of naughty or misbehaved children has been overdone in movies but in the case of this film alone, these kids like to talk about women's boobs and their butt and read nudie magazines and speak profanity.  It was rated PG back in 1987 but wouldn't be surprised if a film like this would receive a rated-R in today's movie rating system (as one or two words of profanity easily gets a film an ""R"" rating).

As for the Blu-ray release, this is a barebones release and the PQ is not the greatest but its probably the better of any video version that has been released thus far.  If you are passionate about the film and still have that old VHS copy, then definitely upgrade to Blu-ray!

Overall, ""Overboard"" is a romantic comedy with likeable characters, a fun story and a typical happy ending.  By no means is it the best when it comes to romantic comedies but it is a cheerful romantic comedy with that '80s style and if you loved the film back then, no doubt you will love the film today!",1312156800,35,5930,4.596007604562738

It's like all the suns were aligned to make the perfect movie. It has a great script, an excellent director (Garry Marshall) and some of the best performers in the business. That's why it's almost impossible to believe that ""Overboard"" was a huge bomb, both commercially and critically when it came out in early 1988.

Kurt Russell / Dean Proffitt
Michael G. Hagerty / Billy
Roddy McDowell / Andrew
Katherine Helmond / Mother Edith Mintz
Edward Hermann / Grant Stayton

430087,3,630211702X,"I love Garry Marshall movies but didn't realise this was a Garry Marshall movie upon buying it. (I don't tend to notice these things.) I've had a bit of a thing for Kurt Russell recently, since watching both Escape From LA/New York, and hey, Goldie Hawn plays the ultimate ditzy blonde a lot of the time. My favourite kind of character quite frankly.

Overboard is a pretty simplistic storyline, but it definitely has that Garry Marshall magic (including Hector Elizondo appearing albeit very briefly and with a dodgy accent). Goldie, playing Joanna, is a rich snooty woman, who's married to a man obviously for his money. He wants kids, she does everything she can to not get pregnant. On their yacht, she wants her walk-in wardrobe done up it's just not up to her standards, so she hires a carpenter. Enter Kurt, playing Dean, a distinctly lower class, who gives Joanna every reason to look down her nose at him. He makes her new shoe racks out of the wrong wood, she throws him off the yacht, along with his tools.

She falls off the boat while looking for her precious wedding rings, gets amnesia, and wakes up in hospital/psychiatric ward, annoying every staff member until they want her off their hands as quick as possible. Along comes Dean, to regain the $600+ money she owed him, and quickly comes up with the idea she's his wife. She has no choice but to go along with this, as she has no recollection of anything, and he takes her back to his shack. Four unruly kids, and lots of chores, you can see the rest coming!

It's quite a sweet film, especially when 'Annie' (her new name) begins to settle in, and even begins to love the kids, and take care of them. There's the usual hilarious scenes, especially when she's been used to having everything done for her before.

Goldie and Kurt make an absolutely lovely couple in this. Where other real life couples have failed (not mentioning any names of course) they've managed to pull it off, and still keep their chemistry on screen. It does make you go all gooey inside. Aww[...] Even when they're arguing on screen, you can't help but laugh at them.

Overboard is predictable nonsense, but still it's fun to watch, and will leave you happy and smiling afterwards. Just what it says on the tin.",1207785600,4,2254,4.597014925373134
430088,3,630211702X,"The plot of Overboard is almost too trite to repeat: he's a carpenter and she's a lady and she marries him anyway. Sort of. Before this can happen, she has to fall off her yacht and end up in an asylum with a case of amnesia and he has to rescue her and convince her that they are married and inculcate the ways of rude and rural countryfolk into her. You can probably guess the rest.

What's surprising is that this is a lot of fun to watch. The stars themselves are very easy on the eyes and the chemistry between them is exactly like that of two happily married people. The scenery and the occasional dollops of music are pretty good too.

If you have a thing for romantic comedies, you might like it.

Goldie Hawn is pure perfection as the spoiled ""Joanna"" who is thrust into the domestic life and forced to be a mother to four unruly children and wife to ""Dean"" (Kurt Russell).  Although she has amnesia, Joanna, knows that her life is somehow different - wrong, ""I didn't marry well"" she says and she dreams of the good life (her real life).

It's gags and guffaws galore as Joanna slowly remembers who she is, but not before she's completely rocked Dean's entire world.  When he drivers her home (with her in the back of his truck) I almost peed my pants.  Like any good romantic comedy, you'll be rooting for this couple and lose yourself entirely in the fantasy of these two worlds colliding.

Besides being funny, this movie has heart.  The lead characters are multi-layered with depth and emotion - and both are easy on the eyes.

430126,4,630211702X,"All due respect to the previous reviewer, but this is not a ""sick"" film.  This movie uses exageration to comic effect and to make a point...in this case to give a rude, self-involved individual her comeuppance.  This type of story has been around since the dawn of story-telling.

It would have been different if Kurt had just picked up Goldie at the hospital and they'd had no previous relationship.  But she'd treated him badly and so she was reaping a little of what she had sown.

The truth is that many comedies are based on confusion, conflicts, misunderstandings, direct obfuscation, and yes, someone's pain. Think of ""Tootsie"".  Is this a sick movie because Dustin Hoffman fools people into thinking he's a woman, including Charles Durning, who wants to date him?  What about ""The Producers"", where two men try to [...] sweet little old ladies out of their money?  ""Singin' in the Rain""?  The leads make a fool of Lina Lamont.  ""Splash""?  Eugene Levy winds up in a body cast. Any of the Marx Brothers movies?  Poor Margaret Dumont is the confused [...] of jokes in almost all of them.

My participation in feminist issues goes back to the late 60s, so it's not like I believe a woman has to be married to be happy, but I'm also not so rigid that I get uptight every time a woman is the [...] of the joke.  Besides, Goldie hardly ""suffers"" in this film.  For a couple of days, before Kurt starts falling for her and cuts her some slack, she has to do some housework and deal with bratty kids.  If that's suffering, then most every mother in the world is suffering every day.

The fact is, this is a sweet-spirited movie.  The only person who really gets hurt is Grant, who deserves it.  It may not be to everyone's taste, but then, I don't get Jerry Lewis movies.  Different strokes for different folks.",1165276800,3,1810,4.544891640866873

It doesn't say much that his wife has passed away, because he's NOT looking in for a wife or mother (as SICK as that would be to FIND a wife/mother that way), but he is taking HORRIBLE advantage over.

During a boating accident where the heiresses husband is driving, she is thrown overboard & loses her memory.  While laying in a hospital, waiting for loved ones to claim her, Kurt Russell (the handyman) sees the story on the news about a woman who was found who doesn't know who she is.  He devises a plan to claim her as his wife - partly to get back at her for being so mean, and partly to help him care for his 6 boys (as their mother had died several years back).

The plan works, and Goldie (the heiress) is thrust into a lower-class life that she had never known.  She takes to it though, and comes to really enjoy being married to the handyman, and being the mother of his kids.  Only thing is, they aren't really married, and they aren't really her kids!

I don't want to ruin the ending for you so I'll leave those questions unanswered.  Suffice it to say that this is a great comedy that can be enjoyed by the whole family!",1124582400,,1228,4.318777292576419
430132,4,630211702X,"Somewhat of a cult comedy classic, Overboard features the comedic talents of true-life married couple Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell on full display. With an unusual plot, but a tried and true romantic device, Overboard remains an interesting and entertaining movie. If you like watching movies for fun, and not for symbolism or to find something that 'speaks' to you, then Overboard will fit in nicely with your plans...

Joanna Stayton (Goldie Hawn) is a spoiled and arrogant elitist who basks in the pampered lifestyle her wealth affords her. Taking a sabbatical on her yacht, she hires a carpenter, Dean Proffitt (Kurt Russell), to build her a customized closet on the oversized boat. But when Dean and Joanna get into argument over the cost of the transaction, she gets angry, refuses to pay, and sets sail for the big blue. However, when Joanna falls overboard at sea, she injures her head and washes ashore with amnesia...

Still steaming from their earlier encounter, Dean finds Joanna and quickly realizes what has happened. Out of a sense of revenge (or vigilante justice), he tells Joanna that she's his wife - and the mother of his four children, Charlie (Jared Rushton), Joey (Jeffrey Wiseman), Travis (Brian Price), and Greg (Jamie Wild). In exchange for being stiffed earlier, Dean works Joanna silly in order to make up for his monetary loss. Eventually, though, Joanna discovers her true identity - but things aren't so simple when she realizes that she's now in love with Dean...

Hilarious and fun in a family-oriented way, Overboard is one of those films you either love or hate. If you're into dramas and reality-based plots, Overboard isn't for you. Like the Seinfeld pilot Jerry and George create (where a judge sentences a man to be Jerry's butler), Overboard has a similar plot about a carpenter who gets stiffed for the money he's owed, so he unilaterally 'sentences' the woman to be his wife (butler in this case). In short, it's a bit loony. But in this instance it works.

With standout comedic performances by Goldie Hawn, Kurt Russell, Edward Herrmann, and various others, Overboard is a memorable and light-hearted romantic comedy you won't want to miss. Most of the humor derives from the circumstances (plus people's emotional inclination to want to see rich snobs get what's coming to them). Regardless of what aspects a viewer most prefers, Overboard has a little bit of something for everybody, and that's probably why it's built such a large following. Due to the fact that it's a really funny movie and quite a few people count it among their favorites, Overboard ranks as a definite must-see film...

430156,4,630211702X,"Imagine Goldie Hawn as a stuck-up millionaire boating along the coast in her yacht.  She has an obnoxiously wimpy husband played by Edward Herrmann and a mother who would have been a perfect fit as Mrs. Howell on ""Gilligan's Island.""  While she is lording over the crew she decides that she needs her closet remodeled and asks local carpenter and real-life husband Kurt Russell, playing Dean Proffitt, to do the remodeling.  Kurt plays a rather down-to-earth fellow who quickly learns to dislike Joanna Stayton (Hawn) as she complains about every single detail.  The encounter ends with Proffitt's tools and Proffitt himself in the ocean, and the yacht sailing away.

In a moment of movie irony Joanna falls off the yacht, hits her head and loses her memory.  Initially she continues to be obnoxious until Dean Proffitt identifies her as his wife Annie Proffitt.  When Proffitt initially brings Annie home she is unable to believe she ever lived in the messy, rustic Proffitt home.  At first Dean and his four children almost treat Joanna/Annie almost as a slave.  But as time progresses Annie slowly takes charge of Dean and the children, and Dean realizes that he is falling for Annie.

Of course we know there is a point where Annie will wake up to the fact that the tumbledown shack is not her true home and neither is she Annie Proffitt.  I knew the relationship could come to no good end as long as Annie did not know the truth, and the point where she learns the truth is one of the best, though saddest, scenes in the movie.  Of course there is a measure of predictability in how the movie ends, but it is all fun.

The pleasure in this movie is that it is entertaining from beginning to end.  Garry Marshall, who also directed ""Pretty Woman,"" has a knack for creating movies about characters that are just a bit larger than life, but close enough to be believable.  His sense of irony and humor border on the absurd, but keep far enough away that you continue to buy the fantasy.  The end result is a movie that is frequently funny and often touching, and at the end you realize you have come to like the characters and wish them well.

Also appearing are the always marvelous Hector Elizondo and Roddy McDowall, adding spice to the characters.  Even the lesser known actors get a chance to provide some very funny moments, such as the Coast Guard crewmen near the end of the movie.

This movie is a popcorn winner!",1100131200,6,2424,4.608391608391608
430157,5,630211702X,"Probably my favorite comedy movie of all time (starring Goldie Hawn & Kurt Russell), Overboard has it all!
A five star cast, hilarious dialogue, great comedic timing, and marvelous chemistry between Hawn & Russell easily adds up to more than five stars worth of fun.  Supporting cast members like Roddy McDowell, Katherine Helmond, and Edward Herrmann make more than the most from their roles, and really shine. The actors who portray Mrs. Berberich, the school principal, and Dr. Korman, the psychiatrist, really do their part to add comedic punch as well.
The movie opens with Goldie Hawn as JoAnna Stayton, a bored, pampered, demanding and imperious heiress--husband Grant is an equally shallow and pompous aristocrat.  They openly despise each other, treat the help like servants, are enamored with possessions over people, and are proof positive that money does not buy happiness.
Enter Kurt Russell as carpenter Dean Profitt, hired to build a new closet on the Stayton yacht.  When petualnt Hawn refuses to pay him for his work and knocks him overboard, Russell vows he will make her pay.  He soon gets his chance when JoAnna falls overboard herself and husband Grant is too preoccupied watching Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous (ostensibly to see if he made it onto a list of the top ten yacht owners!) to hear her cries for help and save her.
Once rescued and suffering from amnesia, JoAnna is taken to the mental ward of a local hospital where she terrorizes staff members with her fits and vicious snits.  Only too glad to be rid of her, they fall for Dean Profitt's story that this is his missing wife, Annie, and he is permitted to take her ""home.""
The Profitt ""residence"" turns out to be a down-and-out homestead reminiscent of the farm from Green Acres, complete with car parts and debris all over the yard, a limping dog in a cast, and four unruly boys demolishing everything in sight.  Watching Hawn acclimate to this nightmare is totally hilarious.  At one point she sighs...""So, this is my life....I didn't marry very well, did I?""  Too, too funny!
By movie's end, Hawn has transformed the unruly household into a happy family home, fallen in love with Russell and his children, and morphed into a real human being.  A funny, funny movie with a feel good ending, Overboard is highly underrated.  I urge you to watch it and share the humor!",1083888000,40,2356,4.8094059405940595

I had never even heard of such a movie but upon seeing that it starred Kurt Russell (One of my favorite actors. See ""Backdraft"" as well) and the movie had a very eccentric feel that I felt it was worth giving a watch. I was so incredibly suprised as ""Overboard"" turned out to be a really funny and absolutely hilarious classic comedy movie. ""Overboard"" is one of my favorite movies of Kurt Russell's and is a movie to rent.
 Starring Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn, it all happens when the heiress of a British aristocratic empire suffers amnesia after a boating accident and is lost at sea. A man however rescues her from the sea and 'rescues' her and brings her to his house where his four dysfunctional kids raise hell in her life and she tries to adapt to her 'new life' and a romance blossoms between the woman and handyman but a conman who is part of the aristicratic business is out to bring her back to her 'previous life' and as she recalls what she lost before the accident, she has to choose whether to go for the handyman (Russell) or her traditional aristocratic family business.
 I was completely suprised at how great this movie really was even when taking into account that Kurt Russell is one of my favorite actors. I'm not discounting Goldie Hawn either but it's just that I haven't seen enough of her movies to really have an opinion but she gives a great performance on ""Overboard"".
 I don't know if it is on the scale of being a must-have movie but it sure is great enough to warrant giving this movie a watch. I loved it.",1075161600,,1671,4.332268370607029

While I enjoyed this movie, I do not recommend it for kids of any age! A few scenes are a bit much and they go a bit overboard on some issues. A la Goldie bending over in a very revealing bathing suit or the kids talking about issues far above their age level.

There are some hysterically funny scenes in which I almost cried from laughing so much.

To understand why it is SO funny, you just have to imagine how a rich woman would feel if she was dropped off in the worst hell she could imagine.

The basic story is that Joanna Stayton (Goldie Hawn) is a demanding and pampered wife who stops off in a tiny Oregon town. She employs carpenter Dean Proffitt (who doesn't make any profit...), to revamp her yacht closets. When he completes the job, Dean asks to be paid and is told the job is not good enough (she wants cedar and he made them in oak!) and therefore he must ""eat"" the costs.

At a convenient moment, Joanna tosses Dean (Kurt Russell) overboard along with his tools and work belt. Then, Joanna falls overboard later when looking for her wedding ring and gets amnesia.

Dean finds a way for her to ""pay up"" for his carpentry work and the result is a hillarious story even a feminist would have to laugh at! The reason we don't feel sorry for Joanna is because she was so mean to Dean and didn't pay him for his work when he needed the money for his family.

This movie has the best last scene of any movie I have ever seen! No lies. I adore the ending.

The reason I like some movies so much is that they take items from the start of the movie and weave then so nicely into other parts of the story line.

Similar to ""Captain Ron"" in humor, but this was way more funny! I guess I didn't appreciate the swearing and other items that they threw in here and there, but the overall story was a hoot! This movie could have been a family movie if they had taken out various aspects.

The kids in the movie are a wild bunch to start with and change throughout the movie. Parents will relate well to this movie. However, I didn't like how Joanna treated the teacher although we can just say she was true to her character in that part of the movie.

One of the funniest movies I have ever seen.

This DVD is a must have if you prefer comedies that also make you feel a little warmth. The importance of motherhood is stressed as ""Roy"" cries, plaintively, ""I need discipline."" You'll watch it over and over again.",984441600,,353,4.619047619047619
430198,2,630211702X,"I found Overboard to not be the least bit funny.  I don't see how they can classify it as being a comedy.  It is just another run-of-the-mill ""comedy"" that is boring and not funny at all.  The movie is very predictable throughout the whole film.  The premise is good but the way the director and the cast carry out with it is horrible.  Kurt Russel is trying to play a different role in this movie and I think he should just stick with his usual.  Goldie Hawn does the best that she can with her role but I don't think anybody could make it great.  Overall Overboard is a senseless, predictable movie with failed humor.  2 Stars",978393600,,628,4.3076923076923075
430199,4,630211702X,"I was surprised at how this movie pulled me in and kept me interested until the end. While I do not consider myself a ""fan"" of Goldie Hawn or Kurt Russell, their performances in this film are first rate and the characters they portray get under your skin. This was probably one of Roddy McDowall's last films, and while the role is small, he is terrific.
There is nothing in this film to shock or offend you. People in this film ultimately do the right thing, and that is rare in films these days.",976665600,,497,4.297872340425532
430200,5,630211702X,"Maybe this movie seems better than it actually is because so many other comedies haven't worked and weren't funny. In any case, this one works, and manages to be funny all the way through, when it almost doesn't seem like it should be funny at all. It's light-hearted and low-brow. A poverty-stricken carpenter is determined to get his just payment from a rich and very snobby woman, who is amnesiac after an accident, and installs her in his shabby house as his supposed wife and mother to his large brood of brats. As nasty as she was, we can't help but feel sorry for her, and perhaps we find the story uplifting because although she really does land in an awful situation, she muddles through, right on to a happy ending. Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn appear to be having a great time as the mismatched couple, and the story and humour feel fresh.",973296000,6,850,4.525974025974026
430201,5,630211702X,"A spoilt heiress falls overboard a ship resulting in amnesia and then is claimed as the wife of a carpenter with three kids. Goldie Hawn sparkles in this loveable comedy which is predictable towards the end, but there are so many laughs along the way, it really doesn't matter. The cast also includes Kurt Russel, Edward Herrmann and Katherine Helmond.
A classic, recommended comedy which is charming throughout.",970790400,,412,5.073529411764706

Goldie in her stretch between Joanna and Annie is probably  some of the best work she's ever done. The chemistry beween the stars is so  THERE that you find yourself believing the entire thing! I highly recommend  this film to anyone and everyone. With the stuff the studios are turning  out lately,  Overboard stands as a true family film that all can enjoy.",965433600,,517,4.494623655913978
