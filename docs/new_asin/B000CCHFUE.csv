8097324,4,B000CCHFUE,"An intelligent, sad, slow moving film. It explores the rift between a smart, shy teen age boy, and his professor father, who he discovers is quietly helping a woman connected to the Red Brigade after she is involved in a terrorist killing.

The acting is generally quite good, and the film has some really moving moments, while raising interesting questions of family, morality, and the pain of coming to see a parent as a deeply flawed person.

On the down side, Jean Louis Trintignant is awkwardly dubbed into Italian, and there are times when the meditative pace feels needlessly
slow.

Certainly very impressive as a first feature. I look forward to re-seeing it at some point.",1430006400,,681,4.853448275862069
