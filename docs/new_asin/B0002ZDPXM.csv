Ding-a-ling-less was a huge surprise with it's great writing, story, directing, and acting.  I can't give away too much, but it is seriously sweet and heart-wrenching while being hilarious and not taking itself too seriously at the same time.

Amazing movie.  Should get more attention.",1285459200,,520,4.8522727272727275
8035323,5,B0002ZDPXM,"This is, without a doubt, a movie (as the box states) like no other.  While its language and subject matter may be initially off putting, if given the chance, this is one gem of a movie.  How director Onur Tukel manages to take such potentially offensive material and create something with such heart and genuine sweetness is nothing short of astonishing!

I was completely unprepared for much of what happened in the movie and that is a rare treat these days.

Actor Kirk Wilson deserves to be noticed and hopefully other films will follow.  The film centers around the most unlikely of heroes, Jack, a happy, normal, guy in a beautiful North Carolina town where everything is idyllic and life passes by blissfully.  Except Jack has no penis.  Wilson brilliantly elucidates the kooky innocence of his character through refreshingly clear candor and sets the wheels in motion for the telling of his tale of woe, innocence lost, madness and redemption.

This is a tough film to review without giving away too much, so I'll end by saying - if you're not easily offended, you will probably have your pants charmed off by this amazing little movie.  Get it.  Now.",1114732800,2,1159,4.778894472361809
