2796950,4,B000OIOS5Q,"Good Information, just spent a lot of reading about the author's personal journey and his motives.  Good info about nutrition and it's ability to reverse and or control the ""rotting"" disease.",1370995200,,191,5.161290322580645
2796951,5,B000OIOS5Q,This is a great book and I read it all the time.  My blood sugar is down and I am losing weight. The book is well written and full of all kinds of reference goodies. This book does not belong on the bookshelf it stays in my kitchen and bedside table.,1342310400,,250,3.9019607843137254
2796952,5,B000OIOS5Q,I have read the book and consider it to be very informative.  It is very simple to follow and understand.,1304208000,2,105,4.25
2796953,5,B000OIOS5Q,"I have read, Death To Diabetes, by DeWayne McCulley,and I have used the suggestions he made.  I followed the diet plan and an exercise program and lost 30lbs.  As my weight went down so did my blood count numbers, and dare I say, my blood pressure, also! Death To Diabetes is common sense, but well researched information. Don't let the fact that Mr. McCulley is not a ""medical doctor"" deter you from giving his plan a try.  After all, the ""medical doctors"" just want to perscribe drugs so that you can continue with your bad lifestyle habits and keep the pharmacutical companies in business.  Why would you want to take drugs when there is a natural way to end your dependence on them?  There is no simple way to change your life, but to do it. Eat to live, don't live to eat.  Eating the right foods at the right times, in the right proportions will help you become an all around healthy person.  Exercise must be a part of your life, not just when you are trying to lose weight. Let's face it, we are a lazy, over-weight, drug dependent nation; and until we accept the fact that our bodies cannot function properly with the lifestyle we have chosen, we will continue to be dependent on drugs to mask the problems in our lives.  I choose the freedom that Death To Diabetes offers.",1284249600,18,1282,4.448717948717949
2796954,4,B000OIOS5Q,"I found this video very helpful in the management of my Diabetes. The beginning was a little slow and the narration was somewhat lack luster, however there is some very serious information contained in this DVD.",1208217600,8,211,4.888888888888889
2796955,1,B000OIOS5Q,"Last thing we loose is hope.
I never thought that I was an idiot for having a hope, but after sleeping seeing this PowerPoint presentation on DVD; I realized that there are no magic cure for Type 2 Diabetes.
As I been doing during the past two three years I'll have care with my food and try to exercise while I can.
No more hopes for idiots.
Keep your money for your medications.
