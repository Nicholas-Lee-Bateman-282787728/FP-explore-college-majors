934954,4,6304797567,"Directed by Robert D. Webb and released in 1953, this saga of competing sea sponge divers was noted for its drop-dead gorgeous cinematography and a brilliant score by composer Bernard Herrmann--and these remain the great assets of the film to this day.

The story is pure melodrama given an exotic twist.  The Petrakis and Rhys families earn their livings by diving for sea sponges, but when the Rhys family, led by father Thomas (Richard Boone) resort to dirty tricks the Petrakis family, led by father Mike (Gilbert Roland) are forced to resort to risky dives at the dangerous 'Twelve Mile' reef; at the same time a love affair between son Tony Petrakis (Robert Wagner) and daughter Gwyneth Rhys (Terry Moore) further complicate the rivalry.  Needless to say, tragedy results.

Both Wagner and Moore were considered rising stars when the film was made, and although Wagner makes for an unconvincing Greek both give enjoyable performances as the star-crossed lovers caught Romeo and Juliet fashion between battling families.  Even so, the acting honors here go to Gilbert Roland and Richard Boone as the warring fathers with a special nod to Peter Graves as Arnold, an overly aggressive Rhys diver.  Several notable character actors, including J. Carroll Nash, Jay Novello, and Harry Carey Jr. round out the cast.

Although the cast is solid, the plot is more than a little predictable--but the chief thing is the photography and the score.  REEF was among the earliest productions made in Cinemascope, and everyone concerned was determined to make it as visually attractive as possible.  The result is some truly beautiful cinematography, particularly in reference to the film's many underwater scenes.  The score by Bernard Herrmann, who would later be best known for his work on such Hitchcock films as VERTIGO, also captures the beauty of the sea to remarkable effect.

Unfortunately, REEF seems to have fallen into public domain, and there are numerous DVD and VHS releases on the market.  In most cases they are abominable things: the cinemascope has been reduced to pan and scan, the colors are muddy, and the sound is poor.  There are, however, at least a few available that give you some idea of what all the 1953 fuss was about.  Although they are hardly renowned for the quality of their product, the Digiview Productions release is actually quite good; the Digital Gold release is also more than respectable.

934955,4,6304797567,"I believe there are only two movies about sponges, and the other is a comedy, Spongebob Squarepants. Beneath the 12-Mile Reef is the best serious movie about sponges. It's an adventure with spectacle, drama, romance, and enough suspense to keep you interested. Robert Wagner, in one of his earliest starring roles, is a Greek sponge fisherman working on his father's (Gilbert Roland) boat off the southwest coast of Florida. Peter Graves (Mission Impossible) pirates a boatload of their sponges and, to get even, Robert Wagner steals a dance with his girlfriend (Terry Moore), and that's when the action begins. Richard Boone (Hec Ramsey), as the girl's father, gets involved and soon lives are at stake. J. Carrol Naish and Harry Carey Jr. are also in the supporting cast.

Beneath the 12-Mile Reef got an Oscar nomination for spectacular underwater photography. The film is in Cinemascope and Technicolor, but unfortunately in this VHS version the colors are faded. This is supposed to be 100% correctible from the 3 technicolor black-and-white negatives, so hopefully the new DVDs being released will restore this classic adventure to it's original splendor.

Definitely a must for Robert Wagner fans, and worth a look if you like old color adventure films, oceanography (the antique diving suits are interesting), or Gilbert Roland.",1115078400,5,1336,5.238317757009346

934957,4,6304797567,"You'll notice that the online reviews tend to be for the movie ... the storyline, acting etc etc ... but without much to say about which version is best. Consequently, the same reviews appear in the listings for all DVD versions. This film seems to have fallen into the public domain and as a result there are quite a few DVDs out there from different manufacturers. I'm always uncertain about buying such discs because there's no telling what sort of quality print they were taken from. I got lucky. I bought the Digital Gold Collection version by Unicorn Video and it's a good, solid print. ASIN: B0000640V8. It is advertised as being digitally remastered and it shows. The print is as clean as can be expected for a non-studio release, the sound is just fine and it's shown in its full Cinemascope format. My only minor complaint is that the colour has a slightly washed out appearance which is instantly fixed by turning up the colour level on the TV set a few notches. I have no idea if the others on the market are equal to this but they certainly aren't likely to be much better. Get this version - you won't be disappointed.",1113523200,33,1132,4.5268292682926825
934958,3,6304797567,"A mushy rewriting of Romeo and Juliet in the context of the conflict between Greeks and Americans in Cuba, before Castro's revolution, centered on the fishing and commerce of sponges. The Americans impose some good zones to be their own, anyone else, particularly the Greeks, being excluded, expelled evn by force if necessary. The Greeks challenge this illegal zoning and are the victims of plundering and violence. Then we get a love affair between one young American girl, promised for marriage to an American man, and a young Greek boy. The love affair causes a lot of strife but ends well. No descent to any vault, no poisoning, fake or true, and no dying.

934959,4,6304797567,"As all of us movie buffs, I really hate it when scenes get deleted from a film.  The end of the fight between Tony's Father and Arnold has been deleted (where they begin to fight ""greek style"", and Tony's father makes Arnold eat a cigar).  It is a great character building scene, and it is a shame it is NOT on the DVD.  I personally would rather they include all scenes, even if they get a little fuzzy, as part of the heart of this movie had been removed.
However, there was a good side to the DVD as well.  Those of us baby boomers who grew up watching and loving the film on television never knew the true ending of the movie, as we could not see it in wide screen.  As I know the movie well, it was a pleasant surprise to see the entire picture when Tony brings his hook boat back into the greek harbor in Tarpin.  I will not ruin it for anyone, but it was a nice touch to the end of the movie that I am glad to know.  For those who have not seen the movie, it is a great one (considering when it was made), and has no bad or distasteful scenes, but portrays the life of early sponge divers.",1047340800,8,1096,3.9771689497716896
934960,5,6304797567,"I found this movie very entertaining because of the Florida locale (I've been to Tarpon Springs, one of the settings in this movie) and the stunning photography, especially the underwater scenes.
The story is a Romeo and  Julliete type, but also gives an account of an almost dead breed of divers  (Spunge divers).
My only critique of this video would be that it seems  that it is a colorized version instead of a true Technicolor version.  It  just seems to me that the color is ""off line"" with its subjects  in many scenes and is rather muddy on several occasions. This is just an  observation comparing this video with other videos I've seen of this  vintage (1953).
I highly reccommend this movie to everyone.  It is a  cheery but serious movie delving into the trials and tribulations of sponge  divers of the Florida West coast.

935170,5,6304797567,"I've had this film for many years as part of an old 4-movie collection called ""Into The Deep"" from a PD (public domain) outfit called Brentwood Home Video. I bought that set solely for the infamous Richard Jaeckel shark exploitation flick ""MAKO: Jaws Of Death."" I eventually got around to screening the other films and found BENEATH THE 12 MILE REEF to be an innocent sea-going love story that features some truly beautiful location photography, (in gorgeous early Technicolor & Cinemascope), both above and below the waves. I watched it recently with my wife and she enjoyed it too, but griped about the crappy picture quality. ""12 MILE REEF"" has been available for years but, while in proper widescreen, the prints are extremely faded, seriously hampering the enjoyment of the film. On a lark I searched for a better copy and, lo & behold, in late 2013 Fox released this old gem in a beautifully-polished, glorious new transfer that is simply stunning to behold, for both it's superior clarity and its rich, lush color palette. Comparing this version of BENEATH THE 12 MILE REEF to the others out there is like seeing it before and then after cataract surgery! THIS is the version to get if, like me, you love the film but have suffered with atrocious-looking washed out gunk versions... toss them and pony up for this edition. You will NOT be disappointed.

The script is just an oceanic variation on Romeo & Juliet. Still, the film is such a wonderful time capsule of the ocean and its wonders and features nice turns by some then quite young and not yet so well-known actors, including a very buff Robert Wagner (Hart to Hart). Wagner plays a headstrong young Greek sponge-diver who falls for the daughter (Terry Moore of ""Mighty Joe Young"" fame), of an Englishman (Richard Boone from ""Have Gun Will Travel"") whose family plies the same trade in the waters of the picturesque Florida Keys. When the Greek Petrakis family ventures into the ""off limits"" fishing grounds used by the Rhys family and other English families, in order to supplement their dwindling sponge catches, there's bound to be trouble! Wagner and tall & wiry young Peter Graves battle for Miss Moore's affections. There are fisticuffs & skullduggery on land to go along with the innocent, gee-whiz romance, and some tense underwater drama & action, too. Wow. This film just looks (and sounds!) marvelous here. If only all old films could get this sort of respectful presentation. Simply amazing. Be advised, this release of BENEATH THE 12 MILE REEF is a barebones, FOX CINEMA ARCHIVES DVD-r, much like the stuff from Universal Vaults and W-B Archives. As such, it may not work properly in older players or players needing firmware updates, so you have been warned!  There are NO bonus features, not even a trailer for the film, but to have the film in this clean, crisp, clear edition I'm willing to overlook that. What a sweet upgrade. 5 STARS!",1423180800,,2918,4.822355289421158

A very young Robert Wagner and Terry Moore provide the love interest, each coming from two rival families, in this tale of the sponge business in Tarpon Springs, Florida.

935218,1,6304797567,"Beneath The Twelve Mile Reef was the second or third Cinemascope movie. Cinemascope format was like IMAX format turned on its side - it was wide, rather than tall. Cinemascope movies were in color, and most movies were not in color in 1953. Scenes were typically breathtaking; actors were beautiful or handsome as appropriate. With all that, plot and acting were frequently deficient. BTTMR has more or less adequate acting, its scenes were originally beautiful, and its actors appealed to audiences of the day. That was enough to get it by.

The movie fell into the public domain a while back. Many grainy copies emerged. Also, televisions could not adequately frame the Cinemascope format, so copies were abbreviated laterally. As a result, all the elements that originally sold this movie were neutralized. The version I purchased on Amazon VOD was unforgivably poor, and of course the deficient plot remains. Indeed, the writing is less forgivable than the appearance.

At some point, it seemed to me that I had been watching this turkey for an awfully long time so I checked to see how much more I had to endure. The ROKU told me four minutes. Hmmm. Four minutes. Problem was the movie still had a half dozen plot lines unresolved. I continued the movie.

In four minutes, the bad guys showed up, there was a fight, then everybody kissed and made up, the meanest bad guy happily gave his girl to the youngest good guy, and the credits rolled. Four minutes. (Did I mention?)

The picture starts with Tony Petrakis diving with other Greeks for a cross that is under water. Tony is the one who fines the cross and returns to the surface as the winner. Tony and his father Mike celebrate his sons win with a Greek party. Mike and Tony are Greek American father and son sponge diving entrepreneurs who decide there going to the Florida Keys to dive for sponges. While diving they are greeted by Thomas Rhys family who wants no stinking Greeks diving in there waters. Therefore, the Rhys takes all the sponges that Mike and his family have gathered and steals them. While out celebrating there, conquest the party is crashed by Mike and Tony. Sparks fly between Tony and Thomas Rhys daughter Gwyneth Rhys. The two run off together into the woods. The next day Tom and Tony go out again and Tom has an accident.

Here are some questions for you. What happen to Tom when he went diving? What does the Rhys have against Tom and Tony diving in the Keys? What is the Rhys afraid that they're going to lose if they let Tom dive? Does anything happen between Tony and Gwyneth? What lengths if any does the Rhys go to keep Tom and Tony from diving?

My Thoughts On This Movie! If you can get through the first 10 minutes of the movie, you will be fine. The movie was filmed of the coast of Key West, in the FloridaKeys, in Florida. The movie kept my attention throughout the movie because of the underwater filming in the Keys. However, this movie had no leading lady so therefore I'm giving this movie just 5 weasel stars.",1389571200,,1670,4.454248366013072

It seems that someone over at the Fox made-on-demand program read the universally negative reviews of the CinemaScope (anamorphic widescreen) films which they had inexplicably released in pan-and-scan format (?!) and decided to ""do it right""...and did they EVER!  ""12 Mile Reef"" was one of the earliest CinemaScope films released (1953) anywhere and to see (and hear) it like this you realize just how good these films really were.  Originally in 4-channel stereophonic sound this MOD release is 2-channel, but that can certainly be forgiven due to the incredible looking 2.55 aspect-ratio transfer done with exceptional care on the part of the Fox restoration team.

Perhaps it's the suave Gilbert Roland, the main character and father figure, or the very early career screen appearance by Robert Wagner, but the film's intrigue has stayed with me for a very long time.  Maybe it's the uncomplicated, but interesting drama, well acted but saddened by the all too real life tragedy suffered by those engaged in unusual and exciting pursuits to make it rich.

935311,3,6304797567,"""Beneath the 12-Mile Reef"" is a classic dose of 1950s melodrama filmed in Florida. Starring a very young Robert Wagner as Tony, a Greek sponge fisherman (I swear I am not kidding,) who teams up with his father Mike (Gilbert Roland) to strip the coast of sponges while running afoul of the entrenched and evil Rhys family fishermen, who seem to believe they own the Everglades. With a backstory about how the dangerous 12-Mile reef killed Tony's brother, the film proceeds to puff up its running time with seemingly endless underwater shots of divers and fish. At the time the underwater photography was groundbreaking, though to modern audiences it simply screams ""blue.""

There is a surprising amount of choral singing and peculiar plotpoints to keep the movie loping along (forced cigar ingestion, sponge pirates, etc.,) although it is padded fairly heavily for a big budget production. Needless to say there's conflict, tragedy, boat arson, and an epic octopus battle that will be the one thing you remember long after the rest of the film is forgotten. The final pirate confrontation leads to a ridiculously instantaneous healing of all wounds and erasing of all bad blood between the warring sponge factions through the magic of matrimony: how much suspension of reality do you need to buy this?

While much of the film may seem contrived (and is,) it's enjoyable to see and doesn't require a lot of thought beyond trying to decide which cast member has the most ridiculous accent. The print, on the other hand, is a mess. It is frequently blurry and has numerous flaws. The soundtrack by Bernard Herrmann has been widely and deservedly praised, though it now registers as a bit too bombastic at points, and certain music cues are jarringly abrupt (which may be an artifact of the print or simply bad edits.) This is a little gem of 1950s filmmaking: although it's not deep (no pun intended,) it serves as a prime example of action-romance pictures of that era.",1356307200,,1966,4.883233532934132

935314,4,6304797567,"Beneath the 12-mile Reef, 1953 film

The movie starts by showing boats on an ocean. This is the Gulf of Mexico off the west coast of Florida. Sponge fishermen have a dangerous occupation gathering sponges from the ocean floor. [This explains why natural sponges are so expensive.] Their catch is auctioned off. The best sponges are in dangerous waters. They pay off part of a loan. There is a ceremony in retrieving a cross thrown into the sea. [Some tie a string nowadays to aid in its retrieval.] Sponges are becoming scarce, so they try a new area. They are successful, but meet their competitors and are ordered away without their sponges. They will take care of this by themselves. Will there be trouble? The arrival of the police creates calm. [Note the wearing of knives.] Are there bad feelings between the Conks and the Greeks? There is a fist fight.

Mike will fish the 12-mile reef for sponges. The harvest should be much better. But there was an accident. A too rapid rise from deep water causes ""the bends"" (nitrogen bubbles in the blood). Ice is used as an emergency treatment Is it too late? ""I'm sorry."" Will their sponges be stolen? A fire on the boat creates danger and damages their boat. Arnold assumed those sponges were from their area. Another man took most of the sponges. Arnold beats up Tony and tells him to stay away. Gwyneth goes to Tony. Can they get a load of sponges to sell and repair their boat? Tony talks to the money lender about supplies for sponge fishing. Gwyneth goes with Tony out to sea. Beneath the sea Tony harvests sponges. What will the octopus do? Another boat draws near - more trouble again. But Tony shows his good character in saving Arnold. ""He's alright.""

This is an interesting story about the sponge fisherman on the west coast of Florida. [But why do they all talk like Yankees?] I wonder if this movie was the inspiration for ""West Side Story""? Overall, its average but educates you about sponge fishing.",1301529600,,1963,4.635057471264368

.....The movie was shot on location in Key West and Tarpon Springs and was the third film to be released in CINEMASCOPE and the first to be shot underwater. The film received an award for the CINEMATOGRAPHER. The color was good and the underwater scenes were spectacular.

.....The second bad rap on the movie was to call it a ROMEO & JULIET love story which it was not.  It was a love story between a man and a woman from different backgrounds and did not have the passion or tragic climax of SHAKSPEARES CLASSIC.

....I think Director Robert Webb got a bad rap for his laid back direction of the love story.  I did not see it that way.  I think WEBB did a magnificient job of letting the love develop slowly from antagonists to lovers. Also he did a great job showing the hero worship of Tony (WAGNER) of his father Mike (ROLAND) Also the love of Tony's parents for each other and for their children.

.....I don't think the criticism of Wagner and Roland of not being ""GREEK"" enough was fair. I mean this was a movie and ANTHONY QUINN'S performance in ""ZORBA THE GREEK"" won this MEXICAN actor an Academy Award.

.....One of the most touching scenes in the movie was when Mike dies from the bends and a stunned Tony wanders off to find his fathers cap.  Gwyneth follows Tony at a discrete distance wanting to comfort him but afraid of intruding on his grief.  I think WEBB did a beautiful job developing the love story between these these two young actors who were both 24 and in the star development stage of their careers. As an aside, Moore was in the stable of HOWARD HUGHES harem of young starlets at this time and a jealous HUGHES kept close tabs on her to make sure she did not get involved with WAGNER.

.....The movie was loaded with strong character actors to back up the pairng of WAGNER & MOORE. GILBERT ROLAND who was once considered to be the successor of VALENTINO or GILBERT as the LATIN LOVER of the Silver Screen. J. CARROL NASH AS SOCRATES, RICHARD BOONE & PETER GRAVES who moved on to greater sucess in TV.

935418,2,6304797567,"Beneath The Twelve Mile Reef is a wonderful and thoroughly entertaining movie that deserves a full restoration.  Unfortunately it does not get that here. The DVD version I am reviewing is the release from A2ZCDS.com. It claims to be a remastered version.  I don't see any evidence of that.  The only thing that is correct about this print is that it is in the original cinemascope super-widescreen aspect ratio of the original theatrical release.  But the print on this DVD is badly worn.  The vibrant colors of cinemascope have become faded out and oxidized.  But worse still, the coloration oscillates constantly throughout the movie, constantly going back and forth between faded but accurate colors, to a brownish oxidized coloration.  If A2ZCDS.com made any attempt at restoration, it was a failure.  This movie deserves the UCLA digital restoration treatment to bring it back to life.

I find this movie totally enjoyable.  The actors are some of my favorites: the pretty and delightful Terry Moore, the ruggedly handsome and magnetic Gilbert Roland, and the terrific character actor J. Carrol Naish. Robert Wagner was not one of my favorites, but is quite good in his role here. Throw in the accomplished actors like Peter Graves and Richard Boone, and you have a lot of talent to watch.  The cinematography is excellent, and it's a shame that the original sparkle of the print is gone.  The location shooting on the Gulf Coast of Florida really adds to the enjoyment, but is less striking than it should be due to the faded print.

Conclusion: this is a movie worth watching.  I give the movie itself 4 stars.  However, the A2ZCDS.com DVD does not do the movie justice.  I am not familiar with the other DVD releases of Beneath the Twelve Mile Reef, but I like the movie so much that I may buy one of the other widescreen releases in the hope that the print quality does the movie more justice.",1231286400,3,1902,4.788343558282208

935422,5,6304797567,"Cinemascope is one of those long lost great film ideas. Started in the early 1950s it allowed people to see a wider part of the screen as it would virtually wrap around the audience giving them an almost 3d effect.

With the advent of multiplexes in the 70s and 80s and smaller screen sizes made Cinemasope obsolete. Many of these films were never released in their widescreen versions because VHS did not fully support widescreen showings of films.

DVD obviosly changed all that and it's nice to see this film back in its full widescreen mormat.

Because this was only the second or third film to use Cinemascope it is fairly short on plot and focuses more on showing the beautiful images of the Florida reef - so that people would get the full effect of the process (the closest thing we have today are IMAX features.)

The plot that exists is fine however - even if it is a traditional boy meets girl from the wrong social circle and spends the rest of the movie trying to win her heart and overcome the social obstacles that have been put in place.

The highlight of the movie is the beautiful underwater footage of the reef and the fish - in some ways this is close to a Discovery Channel feature.

There was a classic boat floating off the dock.  Seated on the dock surrounded by a half dozen young girls was Robert Wagner signing his autograph.  At the time I didn't know him but I did say ""Who in the world is this guy""  He stared back at me and didn't say a word.  It was late in the afternoon and the sun was shining in his eyes.  I still remember those piercing eyes.

At that time I had a Pontiac Convertible and by chance in the back streets of Tarpon Springs came upon Terry Moore.  She was driving a Jeep.  I enjoyed playing with her following her in my car.  It was an enjoyable experience which I will never forget.

Edward Cronjager was awarded an Oscar for his color cinematography (which is striking in the above-water scenes, too, on the boats and in a city park).

Yeah, yeah, there is a story, a sugar-coated lifting from ""Romeo  and Juliet."" Herein, the Montagues are immigrant Greek sponge-divers in Tarpon Springs, Florida (Robert Wagner as the Romeo). The Capulets are Anglo Americans who have claimed the best locations, forcing the enemy aliens to pick from the dangerous reef of the title. Terry Moore plays Juliet, spending less time in swimming stuis than Robert Wagner and not getting to wrestle an octopus as he does.

The hamming of Gilbert Roland as Romeo's dather and Richard Boone's as Juliet's is more fun than the attempts to portray passion of the young lovers. J. Carrol Naish, however, is pretty insufferable as the Greek (!) philosopher-in-residence, given the subtle moniker Socrates. Gilbert Roland is more convincingly Greek than Robert Wager, which is pretty faint praise. As the not-so-old-man fighting the sea, he is pretty good.

There have been multiple DVD releases (copyright protection was allowed to expire), but this one should not be faulted for the inferior other releases!",1143590400,21,1816,5.019933554817276
