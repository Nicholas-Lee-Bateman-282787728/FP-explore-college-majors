3718471,5,B001NGGBDU,Hard to get into at first then like the best rocking chair. I love the charactor she plays and I wish she was my neighbor!,1376524800,,122,3.92
3718472,5,B001NGGBDU,So suffice it to say I love British cop shows and this does not disappoint ...I would say that this season could stand on it's own but I think the best part are the relationships that develop throughout the season ..good writing ...great characters and gentle enough crimes or at least how they are handled ..rather like Inspector Lewis series but with a lady DCI,1375574400,,363,4.6
3718473,5,B001NGGBDU,"Truly enjoy this British show; have watched as many seasons as available and the acting is superb, there is no lag in the action, no real gore (as Americans are want to do) just an all round good show. Thank you.",1362009600,,212,4.195121951219512
3718474,4,B001NGGBDU,"Good plots, Caroline Quentin does better than most in acting the female lead. Up to par for made in the UK which is advert enough on its own.",1360454400,,141,4.071428571428571
3718475,3,B001NGGBDU,"Like Series 4, this doesn't measure up to the 1st 3 series for the show.  However, better than most every series produce in the U.S. of this genre",1353715200,,146,4.214285714285714
3718476,4,B001NGGBDU,"Blue Murder, is a police procedural/murder mystery from Britain's ITV. This is a terrific series that personifies a woman in charge.

Caroline Quentin stars as Detective Chief Inspector Janine Lewis, a woman with more on her plate than most. The series takes place in Manchester, and some of the accents are most pronounced.  DCI Lewis is in charge of mostly male detectives. In Series 4, there is a lovely female added who has no difficulty showing the males how good she is. the team loves and respects DCI. Lewis has a lot going for her but she is also a single mom of four children. She is pregnant in the first series when her husband leaves her for another woman. By Series Five, Lewis has learned how to deal, almost. She has a live-in nanny, but her two older children are teens, and the third chid, Thomas is always in trouble. The dad has moved to another country leaving Lewis to cope all on her own.

Her colleague, DI Richard Mayne, played by Ian Kelsey, is a friend and it is often suggested a romantic interest. He seems to be a comfort, and they are always joking. Lewis tells Mayne that he has the best a** in Manchester!  Lewis can count on Mayne, and that is important in this series.

The stories are well written and filmed. Many times, I think I  have figured out the plot, and then someone new or a missed clue is added to set me off track. Manchester, is a lovely city, gritty, full of crime, but, still, an involved and fascinating. It appears that Series Five was the last one of this series. I will miss the group, and most of all, DCI Lewis.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 10-09-12

3718477,5,B001NGGBDU,"We have seen all of the series in this wonderful British police procedural. Carolyn is in our top ten of talented British women actresses, and she delivers even better in this one. Good mysteries, excellent acting - just topnotch - and engaging characters are the basis. Only the occasional episode is not so hot - 95% are terrific - and find a U.S,. series you can say that about. Which is why I'm so annoyed with Amazon.  Every 5 - 10 minutes we get ""your video is reloading."" requiring a couple of minutes of waiting, which definitely gets in the way of enjoying the program. This problem is Amazon, and Amazon alone, as when we've gotten so annoyed with the reloading, we put on another streaming company (not allowed to say which) and found no problems at all. Go back to Amazon, and the reloading starts again. We bought this whole series from Amazon, and have yet to get through the second episode due to annoyance. We've also experienced this endless reloading with The Closer, another program we love and would like to sit back and enjoy.  When we call for help, we are always told it's our router, our TV, our high speed internet - never that Amazon streaming is simply abominable. I wish someone in charge at Amazon would hire a competent team leader for the streaming - Amazon does a lot of things well - it's amazing they can't pull this off. Since the future is in streaming, you'd think it would be a high priority - not just a place to stick someone's idiot cousin in charge so your mother doesn't have to support him (or her.)",1330041600,10,1543,4.487544483985765

3718518,5,B001NGGBDU,"Thoroughly enjoying the Blue Murder series.  It is similar to other British crime drama series, such as Scott & Bailey, but set in Manchester.  Love the very real feel of British crime drama and the supporting life events of the characters.  Everything is never tied up in a neat bow, and the characters have human flaws. Because of that, these dramas are so relatable to real life.",1473552000,,382,4.6716417910447765

3718550,5,B001NGGBDU,"Brilliant crime drama.  Great chemistry between Quentin and Kelsey.  Though her husband deserts her and their kids, this seems more like a family drama than many more traditional set-ups.  Richard acts as a part-time Dad and CID Lewis's team has the rough and tumble banter of a  second family.  Despite the marathon pace of her life, Lewis avoids self-pity and strikes a believable balance between Mom and Boss without becoming edgy and shrill -- at least most of the time.  She avoids being judgmental which keeps this series on a more humane level than some other cop stories, such as Law & Order, where the self-righteousness of law enforcement is hard to take.  Of the many offerings in the British detective category, Blue Murder rates high in warmth, humor, romance, and wit. On the whole a fast paced and engrossing series which was cut short way too soon.",1457395200,,864,4.797297297297297
