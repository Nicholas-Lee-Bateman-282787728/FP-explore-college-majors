7998595,5,B0000CABF0,"Corvette The Fastest 50 Years,there are two versions of the same Double DVD Boxset,one just  has DVD and Special Features dvd,the other set I later found out and also purchased includes a soundtrack music cd The DVD's has Some footage I have seen before, special features and some footage that is available out there, But there is some Cool Lemans 1960 Special Feature, featuring a little bit of the 4 corvettes racing Le Mans '60. W. Dr. Dick Thompson ""The Flying Dentist"", You have some interviews with Dick Guldstrand, Some Pics I have not seen before, Interview With Book Author Randy Leffingwell, It was pretty pricey when I first got at a FYE store For $[...]. at the time. But It was worth it, It's pretty Entertaining Fast Paced And Fun 2 set dvd, With A Timeline, The whole DVD set is a Short History Integrated with Corvette's. Which Makes Sense. It's a Different Treatment on the Corvette, And A Different Approach. Would Highly Recommend.",1236729600,2,950,4.757575757575758
7998596,3,B0000CABF0,"I bought this DVD really looking forward to learning more about Corvettes.  It starts out by providing the origins and history of how the Corvette came into being, which I enjoyed.  But after spending alot of time on the 53-67 model years and providing alot of good racing history, it skimps over the C3 and C4 leaving out a lot of good info.  There was also not alot of info on the C5.  So, I went to disc 2 for the year by year.  Each year is listed up through 2003, but each year has a history lesson of what was happening in the world.  I personally didn't care for it.  I wanted info on what was changed each model year, small and large.  Give me video or pics!!  I expected alot more.  If you like pics of vettes and video, you'll like it.  If you are new to Corvettes and want info on what's different about each year, find a book.  I was disappointed.",1098144000,7,859,4.13939393939394
7998597,5,B0000CABF0,"I am the director of the DVD and tried to abstain from rating our own product, but the system wouldn't let me. So how could I not give it 5 stars... :-)
We spent almost a year putting this project together - an 80+ minute, pop-culture-infused program, and 50 year-by-year videos to show you exactly what happened in the world, and in the world of the Corvette for every year of this incredible car's history. Bunch of extra treasures, too.
Hope you enjoy!",1070496000,7,455,4.493975903614458
