7911106,2,B00000ILFP,"Such a sad ending to the REAL Baywatch. I hated it when Shauni and Eddie left the show. They were the heart and soul of the show. River o No Return was the very last episode of Baywatch Erika and Billy appeared in and it made me cry because I knew I was going to miss them so much. The final scene especially when they had their beautiful wedding-made me cry my eyes out because it was so sentimental and beautiful and such a beautiful song by Linda Ronstadt and Aaron Neville. The best wedding song I have ever heard in my whole life. It's sad too because you know you'll never see Eddie and Shauni again. I missed them so much. The show was awesome when they were still there. After they left and the new cast members such as Pamela Anderson, Nicole Eggert and David Charvet came into the show--Baywatch began to suck ass and go downhill. It just wasn't the same awesome stories of saving lives and beautiful romance anymore--it was cheap stories that were only about the bodies and the bikinis. No real great stories anymore--just sex and bikinis. Pam and Nicole could not replace Erika, and David Charvet definitely infinitely could not replace my prince charming Billy Warlock!!!!!!! This show was so awesome until Eddie and Shauni and also Harvey, Ben, and Cpt. Thorpe left. The glory days of Baywatch at that point were finally over--sad.",1438214400,,1345,4.5850622406639

7911108,4,B00000ILFP,"This is a great DVD if you are a fan of the old early-to-mid 90s era of Baywatch.  Of course it became utterly useless when they released Season 2,3, and 4 (marked as Season 1,2 & 3 on the DVD packaging) on Region 1 DVD a couple years ago, and the 2 two-part episodes on this set are apart of those seasons.  But I still highly recommend it(if you can afford the absurd prices).  Why?  Nightmare Bay Pt 1 & 2(Season 2 premiere) and River of No Return Pt 1 & 2(Season 3 premiere) are strangely omitted from those releases.  Still not sure why.  Something about copyrights to these episodes.

What makes this so baffling is that River of No Return in particular is a very important episode in this era of Baywatch.  It introduces C.J. Parker first and foremost, and it may even introduce Matt and Summer.  I don't really recall.  More importantly it's the last episode to feature Eddie & Shauni which bridges the gap between Season 2 and 3 and even of more importance, it gives us closure to Eddie and Shauni as to why they aren't in Season 3.  Without this episode, the show goes from featuring Eddie & Shauni, then in the blink of an eye, they are gone with no explanation and C.J., Matt, and Summer are now at Baywatch which is how one would see it on the Region 1 DVDs.

Having said that, the value of this DVD is worth the asking prices (if you are a fan, of course).",1251849600,,1370,4.267441860465116

7911110,3,B00000ILFP,"Season 1 was great, gritty storylines, realistic credible characters and some great music montages. This disc features the Season 2 pilot episode called Nightmare Bay. Gone are Parker Stevenson, Brandon Call and Shawn Weatherly only to be replaced in this episode by Jeremy Jackson as Hobie, Tom McTigue as Harvey and for this episode only Andrea Thompson as Devon Connor. David Hasselhoff, Billy Warlock and Erika Eleniak remain from season 1. This was a good episode in places including a great rescue scene featuring Erika Eleniak (Shauni) saving a young girl from drowning and befriending her and her family. The rest of the show follows a monster in the bay storyline which turns out to be a mini-sub. The second side of this disc features the pilot episode of season 3 - River Of No Return. This episode sees the debut of a whole new cast of characters including David Charvet as Matt Brody, Pamela Denise Anderson as CJ Parker, Nicole Eggert as Summer Quinn, Kelly Slater as Jimmy Slade and Susan Anton as Jackie Quinn. This episode also features the marriage and departure of Eddie (Billy Warlock) & Shauni (Erika Eleniak) after a white water rapids adventure with Mitch, Hobie and CJ. Overall this DVD is one I would recommend, it's really the last parts of Baywatch you'll find before the show really lost any credibility it had and earnt the name Babewatch.

Cast includes: David Hasselhoff as Lt Mitch Buchannon, Billy Warlock as Eddie Kramer, Erika Eleniak as Shauni McClain, Monte Markham as Captain Don Thorpe, Richard Jaeckel as Lt Ben Edwards, Andrea Thompson as Devon Connor, Tom McTigue as Harvey Miller, Pamela Denise Anderson as CJ Parker, David Charvet as Matt Brody, Nicole Eggert as Summer Quinn, Kelly Slater as Jimmy Slade & Susan Anton as Jackie Quinn.",1115164800,5,1779,4.910299003322259
7911111,5,B00000ILFP,"At least Baywatch is in Dvd.
This Dvd contains 2 episodes one in each side of the Dvd of the 1991-92 season of the show.
The first one Nighmare Bay with Erika Eleniak(Shauni) follows an press investigation in the Santa Monica Bay about a Sea Monster which destroys boats on the ocean and a girl photographer is saved by Mitch Buchannon from a safe dead.
Shauni also saves a girl from drawning on the ocean after being pushed by her brother.
The second River Of No Return introduces Summer(Nicole Eggert) and his mom  when moving to California and they met Jackie's ex-boyfriend which wants to return to her life and they are helped by Matt Brody(David Charvet) a fellow Malibu student who wants to be a lifeguard.
Mitch's uncle is killed when escaping from 2 hunters that wants his gold boot treasure that is hide somewhere in the river.
So Mitch goes there for an answer and to locate the treasure.
He goes with Hobie and Eddie and Shauni and then they find C.J. Parker(Pamela Anderson) a local kayak fanatic which joins them into the rapids of the river.
After locating the secret location of the treasure they are captived by the hunters,they escape,are pursued by them and finally they lost the gold located on the kayak which broke.
Finally there is a rookie swimming contest on the beach to qualify for Baywatch,CJ Summer and Matt and his friends qualifies winning the race.
The Dvd transfer is good,clear and full screen ratio with clear sound. However no subtitles nor captions are avaliable.
I'm waiting to see more episodes transfered in special the ones with Jasmine Bleeth.
I wanna more episodes!!!!.",1022544000,5,1612,4.757142857142857
7911112,4,B00000ILFP,"Weard they didn't produce more DVDs of Baywatch. I'd like that. Specially a DVD with episodes that include Yasmine Bleeth. If you liked the series, then the DVD is for you. They took two episodes of Baywatch and made a DVD with them. I personnally loved this DVD since I am a Baywatch Fan. Erika Eleniak is in both episodes, Pamela and Nicole Eggert are in only one of them.
For Baywatchs fans, this DVD is a MUST.",1010361600,3,414,4.32051282051282

7911114,3,B00000ILFP,"Just swell.
I bought this DVD thinking that 'Nightmare Bay' was, as described, 'the feature-length movie that started it all'. Wrong. As I discovered upon watching it, and remembering back about ten years, 'Nightmare Bay' is actually the two-parter that started the SECOND season. 'Panic At Malibu Pier' was the real pilot film, and the one I was really after. I wouldn't mind so much, but it was neither the film I was after, nor was it very good. The second season was made with a small cast and lacked any of the glamour of the first or subsequent few seasons. 'River of No Return' is a bit better, being the start of the 3rd season and the story where Pamela Anderson, Nicole Eggert and David Charvet were introduced (and where Billy Warlock and Erica Eleniak bowed out).
So, if it's the pilot you're after, this isn't it. The only place I have found it is on Amazon.co.uk, on the VHS PAL format. That's okay for me, but most Amazon.com shoppers are probably live in the US and need NTSC. Hope this helped.",1009929600,8,1010,4.524590163934426
