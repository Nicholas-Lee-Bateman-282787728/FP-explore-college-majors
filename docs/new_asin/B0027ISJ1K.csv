3867689,4,B0027ISJ1K,"Kyle Rankin (Project Greenlight #2) directs a worthwhile giant bug flick here.  I saw previews on SciFi and caught the debut and it was WAY better than your typical SciFi fare in terms of effects, acting, cinematography...well...EVERYTHING.  Really a nice surprise if you dig giant bug flicks like I do.  PS-don't open the garage door.

Worth watching!",1250294400,,352,5.12280701754386
3867690,5,B0027ISJ1K,"This movie has it all. Icky bugs that eat half the cast, they say [...] a lot, and there is a gratuitous nude scene that has nothing to do with the plot.

A quite enjoyable Saturday afternoon romp reminding me of the classic creature features of the 50's and 60's. The acting is decent, and the plot moves right along.

There is, of course, no explanation whatsoever of why the creatures are there, but who cares? Lots of action, lots of banter between the characters, and some nice special effects.

No, not an academy award winner, but then again, I hate most movies that win those things.

Pure entertainment, I just wish they made more icky bugs like this one. A refreshing change from the serial killer/slasher/vampire movies that are passing off as horror. Highly recommended.",1250035200,,782,4.727941176470588
3867691,4,B0027ISJ1K,"Infestation is an above average creature feature, especially considering it made its debut on the sci-fi channel. Oh, I'm sorry, I mean the syfy channel. What was I thinking?
  The flick is along the lines of Eight Legged Freaks and Slither, a fun throwback to monster movies when there were still drive-ins. I think you should definately check this out when it comes out on DVD, if you didn't catch it on syfy.",1249689600,,411,4.616438356164384
3867692,3,B0027ISJ1K,"In INFESTATION, the earth has been overrun by cockroaches the size of Saint Bernards although we see the infestation only locally.  We are not sure whether the source is extraterrestrial or simply a mad scientist's experiment gone awry.  A young man Cooper (Christopher Marquette) wakes up wrapped in a cocoon. He sees giant bugs and has to fight to live.  He meets other humans who are also involved in survival.  Gradually, we learn about them as individuals.  Cooper is a sex-obsessed geeky type who is attracted to one good looking girl who spurns him and is attracted by another who for some ungodly reason finds him appealing.  The plot involves their seeking out the bugs' nest to kill the queen.  There are plenty of thrills and convincing special effects that bring to mind more than a passing resemblance to ALIEN and ALIENS, including one scene replete with the queen laying hundreds of eggs in her brood nest. Cooper is an unlikely hero who is surprisingly round.  The other actors are mostly unknowns.  The action does not give us time to question anything let alone plot credibility, and in a film like this, that is a plus.",1249689600,,1138,4.76530612244898
3867693,4,B0027ISJ1K,"I was fortunate enough to attend the US premiere of Infestation, a nifty science fiction story with just the right amount of comedy, terrific performances by stars new and old, and snappy dialogue. Although it was made on what amounts to a ""shoestring"" (less than $5 million), you'd never know it from the great cinematography (by Thomas Ackerman of Beetle Juice and Anchorman fame), silky (no pun intended) special effects (from newcomer/phenom Efram Potelle), and a crisp, fast-moving script (by director Kyle Rankin).

Chris Marquette (as main character, Cooper) is by turns endearing and heroic. At times seeming to channel Shia Labeouf (without the ""no, no, no, no, no's""), he comes across as both real and genuinely charming, and his transformation from phone rep (today's factory worker) to an against-all-odds hero holds the center of the movie. Ray Wise gets off some great one liners as his dad, Ethan, and Dale Simonton is memorable as a boss who's up to his ears with telemarketing slackers. (Oddly and disappointingly, Simonton's character simply disappears after a dramatic entrance.)

Of course, Infestation isn't perfect.  The underlying story has ""echoes"" from quite a few other films, and sometimes it's hard to distinguish between an ""homage"" and a copy.  For example, there's more than a bit of Alien (and Aliens) in the mix, both in terms of visual imagery and the presentation and organization of the ""things"" doing the infesting. Yet, Infestation comes across as a charming spoof that incorporates notions from a variety of science fiction films in a playful and knowing nod to serious stuff that's come before it. In addition, the groups' journey from the city to the scene of their final encounter wasn't as suspenseful as it should have been. If it had a bit more of the out-of-control sense of danger in Shaun of the Dead, I think it would have been a better film for it.

I can't review this movie without a nod to the ending.  Of all the ways Infestation could have, shall we say, landed, the final scene -- which I won't give away -- is pretty damn perfect.  I'll just let you experience it.",1248134400,24,2121,4.891364902506964

3867702,2,B0027ISJ1K,"Meandering plot, Halloween store decorations, and a lot of unnecessary ""comedy"" that falls completely flat are the biggest issues with this film. While mostly filled with bland boring scenes, occasional action delivered via practical effects and occasional CGI provide the only actual interesting part of the story (which the movie does it's best to ignore.) If you are interested in a well done low budget scary bug themed creature feature, try ""Stung"" or ""Mimic"" for a much better experience. **mild spoilers ahead** The ending was completely cliched in the attempted sequel grab, and completely cheapened an already shoestring experience.

Puzzling story telling in some ways.  I was mostly playing Dark Souls whilst this was on and I LOVED Linda Park... but why was so little done with such an amazing performer?  I almost made it to the end without skipping scenes (you know you've done it... hitting that right arrow...) but alas... towards the end... I sort of lost interest (I mean... there was effectively an entire cast change mid film just as the original crew was starting to play out the story lines that were started with the initial arc of the film... which are all then completely abandoned (I have no other description for it) in lieu of following the previously mentioned loser protagonist.

Creepy monsters, lots of narrow escapes, characters dropping like flies and some humor.  The special effects were good enough that they did not yank me out of the story.  The main character was really irritating, but he was supposed to be irritating.  It was not because of bad acting or dialogue.  He was written that way.  I did not love this movie, but I enjoyed it.

He helps to revive enough people (most are malcontents meant to serve as fodder for the bugs), and then they take off searching for loved ones.  Along the way, very little speculation is made of the bugs that have taken over.  What are they, where did they come from, what do they want; questions never answered.  (Supposedly, this was going to be part of a trilogy, hence the abrupt ending signifying nothing.  Considering nothing has shown up since.........)

Whether or not you'll like this movie depends entirely on whether or not you can stand the nonstop yapping by Chris Marquette.  Things pick up considerably once his father (Ray Wise) enters the picture.  It's a fun film.  The insects are well designed.

I can't understand why they didn't put this one out here in the states though because this is alot of fun. The story concerns people waking up and they are cacooned by big bugs and they must fight to survive. The film uses both effective cgi ( computer generated images) and old fashioned style electronically worked bugs , remember ET even used this and it's often better than cgi in some cases.  The cgi here is loads above what other low budget b movie sci fi flicks often are stuck with. They aren't a level but mostly they are close! the acting is fine and has the excellent ray wise leading off as the frustrated father of a slacker son. The son is the stories hero which is a twist.  The film jumps right into the story and due to this we don't get to the predisaster characterizations of some films: I really didn't mind though as this one is alot of fun. On blu ray , (this one is made in the uk) the picture looks great with no dirt , scratches or softness that older catalog movies can have. However some extra features may not come through because they are region b, which is why I want a all region blu ray player! It's just a romp in some ways and it does have a few extra features. I love b movies and this is close to a A movie in some ways , but like all of these types of movies the regular critic  (non b movie lover, might pick this apart in some ways) still  this one seems higher budget than it is!  unlike lets say some scy fy movies  you might enjoy but still effects wise are way behind this. So grab this one if you love bugs on loose movies or even fun ones like ""them"" (1950's) ""mars attacks"" or ""night of the lepus"" ,this is worth owning on blu ray. Even though the ending wasn't my cup of tea it didn't spoil the fun I had watching this film which takes place in colorado but was filmed overseas somewhere.",1304812800,2,1935,4.092348284960422

3867782,3,B0027ISJ1K,"Nonchalantly toss this one on the B-movie cult classic heap. And because absolutely no one demanded it, INFESTATION resuscitates the old killer bug horror genre. INFESTATION is hampered by a shoestring budget, yeah, and yet, bolstered by decent performances, crisp pacing, a sense of humor, and a balanced blending of CGI and practical effects, this is a surprisingly effective watch. No self-loathing for you the next morning should you give this one a chance.

Somewhere in Anytown, Colorado, smart-alecky office drone Cooper Flynn is about to get sacked from his call center gig, but that still won't be the low point of his day. No, it's what happens after that loud weird noise and the lights going out for everyone. Sometime later Cooper gains consciousness only to find himself cocooned and about to be eaten by a monster beetle. He gets past that and starts waking up and freeing several of his mummified co-workers. These few survivors look around and figure out pretty promptly that they've been plonked onto post-apocalyptic terrain. Because there are all these cocooned bodies festooning the city and, y'know, all the monster attacks.

The Japanese title for this movie is BIG BUGS PANIC - or ""Biggu baguzu panikk"" - which makes me smile (the Greek call it ""I epithesi ton gigantion entomon"" but that doesn't do anything for me). Watching INFESTATION, phrases may go thru your mind, like ""uneven tone"" and maybe ""That's gonna take a lot of damn pesticides"" or ""comedy jostling elbows with pathos and straight-up horror sensibilities."" In its taste of humor, there's this vague whiff of SHAUN OF THE DEAD, but I think only a vague whiff. The movie tag-line is ""Prepare for Global Swarming"" so from that you get an inkling of the campy. I do like the image of lead character Cooper strolling the deserted city landscape in his Chuck Bartowski outfit. He's kinda sorta cast in the role of savior to the world or at least vengeance bringer to the creepy crawlies what brought destruction to his city and its outskirts. There's a nest of these terrifying insects in the outskirts.

It's a blending of not-too-bad CGI and practical effects, and why not wallow in the white alien goopy ichor spurting out with each insect kill? The razzle dazzle looks pretty good for stuff created on a pauper's budget. Although you may have to overlook the rather skimpy evidence of city-wide devastation, and I do wish there were more diversity to the bug creatures other than giant beetles, flying insects, and hybrid human-spider things. But the beasties we do get look good.

There's no explanation for the bugs' origins, but this doesn't at all sink the movie. Military experiment gone wrong? An alien invasion? Insects on steroids? I dunno. It doesn't matter. INFESTATION is one of those straight-to-DVD efforts that surprises you by being better than it should be. No, it won't blow your mind, but it's a pretty enjoyable and fast-paced time-waster, and there's great energy and it does come up with a surprise here and there. The cast is okay, with special mention going to Brooke Nevin (""Sara"") who keeps it grounded and who never does fall into that typical ""damsel in distress"" trap. One downside is that Cooper Flynn frequently plays it cute with the jokes and there's a sense of detachment about him, and this tends to undercut the story's emotional heft. In those moments, the film feels more like a spoof. I'm giving 3.5 out of 5 stars for INFESTATION, straight-to-DVD and built for fans of cheesy, campy creature features like EIGHT LEGGED FREAKS, TREMORS, and ANACONDA. Except that this movie comes with eight to ten seconds of nudity. Cool.",1284768000,,3648,4.917207792207792
3867783,4,B0027ISJ1K,"The ""bug movie"" was one of the building blocks of early science fiction movies, with a film like Them! (1954) being one of the traditional classics.  Starship Troopers (1997) breathed some life into the largely neglected genre, which still had something to offer.  A Sy Fy original movie, Infestation (2009) may not have the intensity and scope of Starship Troopers, but it is a pretty entertaining ""bug movie"", with some interesting characters, effective special effects, sharp dialog, and some dark comedic elements, where a small group of survivors must face an unexpected alien threat.

Cooper (Chris Marquette) awakens at work, to find that he and everyone in his office, is covered with some kind of white cocoonlike webbing.  A small group of survivors soon discover that the city has been overrun by giant beetles and flying bugs, that seem to have killed or immobilized almost all human life.  With communications down, and no news regarding what has happened, Cooper and a few followers set out of foot to seek refuge at the home of Cooper's father Ethan (Ray Wise), an ex-military type, who has a bomb shelter.

The journey is a hard one, as various members in the party find that the bugs have claimed family members, and that the sting from certain insects can transform a human into a mutant bug like creature.  After Cindy (Kinsey Packard) freaks out, the group is attacked, and Sara (Brooke Nevin) is carried away by one of the winged insects to their gigantic nest.  With father and son, Albert (Wesley Thompson) and Hugo (E.Quincy Sloan), an anxious Cooper arrives at his father's home.

Ethan is your stereotypical right wing military type, and Ray Wise (Jeepers Creepers 2) plays him with a mirthful glint of madness in his eyes.  Wise adds an over the top element to the absurdity of the situation, as Cooper plans to find the nest, and attempt to rescue Sara.  The assault on the nest reunites the couple, who both get into the action hero mode for the final bug battle.  Smartly acted by Marquette and Nevin, the relationship between Cooper and Sara is testy, adversarial, and full of delightfully wicked banter.

Shot in Bulgaria, the film looks slightly washed out.  Against this palate, the alien bugs look a little too clean and shiny to be real, and the special effects that generate them are very well done throughout the movie.  There isn't much of an explanation for the alien's presence, and the resolution to the story seems a little too easy, and leaves things unsettled, but for what it is, Infestation is quite an entertaining ride, with some nicely executed action sequences.

The only significant extra is a dry but informative commentary track by director/writer Kyle Rankin.  Infestation is a rare gem from Sy Fy, with good production values, special effects, and a story that while not completely fleshed out, accomplishes quite a bit for being on a limited budget.",1283126400,,2906,4.885947046843177

I wouldn't call this film terrific as it has it's faults but it was very entertaining!  This film reminded me of the creature films from the late 70's, Empire of the Ants, Food of the Gods etc...

The films plot is based around a swarm of very large ""bugs"" invading a town.  The movie starts off normal with a guy going to work and is about to get fired for always being late and not taking his job seriously when a loud high pitched screech is heard and then he wakes up on the floor covered in webs.  He takes the web off his face and is sick immediately.  He revives a few people around him when he sees a gigantic beetle and he starts to fight it.

The bug infestation only gets worse and he revives more and more people.  This band of people then try to find out where these bugs are coming from and eventually find the ""source"" of the infestation.

This movie is really played for laughs but it does turn on a seconds notice.  One minute your laughing and then the next they jump right into some horror elements.  While the film is not gory it does have it's share of nasty effects and it is paced very well.

This movie will remind people of Alien 4, The Nest and the remake of The Thing in some places but it is still a very original flick.  If you want to have a good time with an old fashioned style creature film, you will definitely enjoy this film.",1264723200,,1565,4.190635451505017

3867798,3,B0027ISJ1K,"In this good monster flick, with humour and neat special effects & gross-out scenes, you'll watch giant bugs take over the world. Well, that's assumed; it's the world of Cooper (Chris Marquette) that you're focusing on.

He's a 'slacker office drone', as stated on the DVD case, and he  wakes up in a giant cocoon. Freeing some others, they fight back against bugs that either scamper; fly; or are human/bug hybrids. The fact that they are deaf does help the people in their 'sticky' situations.

Things start almost immediately without explanation; at least I didn't catch it if it happened. Ray Wise also stars as the father of Cooper and he plays the military-type well. The lovely Brooke Nevin stars as Cooper's love interest and the two of them are having fun in this flick.

Both are shown on the cover artwork of the DVD, but it's misleading. I WANTED to see Cooper brandishing a tennis racket and hitting the bugs or Nevin's character with the big gun and blowing the creatures away -- but neither of them took place.

Apparently, this was shown on SyFy (what?). I don't even watch TV or have cable channels; I guess that changed from the more sensible Sci-fi name.

Anyway, it was a good time user (not waster) and I just picked up my copy the other day. Fast-paced and cool...but the ending was almost immediate and disappointing. It opens the door for a sequal, which I'd like to have happen, but I didn't like the conclusion one bit.

Eventually, Cooper teams up with a handful of survivors (including hottie Brooke Nevin) as they fight off the hordes of giant bugs, with a good amount of tongue in cheek humor filling everything out in between.

3867801,4,B0027ISJ1K,"This is a recent movie but I don't remember seeing it as either a theatrical or DVD release. I came across it while researching another film and I'm glad I did. This is one nifty little flick. It's a monster movie plain and simple but it grabs a bit of this and that from here and there and puts it all together in an enjoyable fashion.

Chris Marquette plays a slacker who can't even cut it in his crappy phone sales job. But all of the sudden he wakes up covered in a cocoon and looks around the office to find everyone in the same situation. He frees a few people, including his boss who had just fired him and realizes they're far from out of the woods. The office is infested with these big, nasty bugs and a plan needs to be hatched to figure out how they're going to survive.

Like Night of the Living Dead, the bad stuff starts right away with no explanation as to how it all came about. Like John Carpenter's The Thing, some of the group have ""turned"" and some effort goes into figuring out who is still human. Like Aliens, the queen bug has to be found so she can be wiped out along with her brood.

Chris Marquette's character ""Cooper"" helps make this film. It's a decently written part and he plays it well. Brooke Nevin plays the love interest and the two work well together. The rest of the crew are good enough but rather 2 dimensional, with the possible exception of Ray Wise who plays Marquette's ex-military father. The character doesn't rise much above cliche but Wise is a veteran actor and brings a lot to the role.

This never gets too scary and the humor makes it a fun watch. The climax could have been more....climactical but it's what Eight Legged Freaks should have been and I'm seriously thinking of adding this to my library. It's a jolly good time.",1256515200,,1778,4.346385542168675

Love Mr. Wise in REAPER and loved him here too. He always pikcs good movies.
Enjoy!",1252195200,,276,4.12962962962963
3867805,3,B0027ISJ1K,"I'am not really an avid bug movie watcher, but I found this movie somewhat entertaining. There were a mixture of other sci-fy/horror movie scenes present in this movie. There was a scene toward the end that reminded me of, ""Aliens"". Why and where did the bugs come from was a bit puzzling for me. Maybe I'll watch it a second time to get a better understanding. I did enjoy watching Ray Wise, who always bring drama and humor to most of the movies I've see him in. What bothered me the most was the ending of the movie.  I won't say what it was, in order not to spoil it for the next viewers.  So if you like a little humor mixed with sci-fy, this movie may be for you.",1252195200,,669,4.138461538461539
3867806,3,B0027ISJ1K,"Infestation (Kyle Rankin, 2009)

The newest film from Rankin (The Battle of Shaker Heights) would really, really be a bad movie if it didn't come off as a spoof of Sci-Fi Channel Original Movies. That saves it, for the most part, but much of the time I was trying to figure out whether it was meant as a spoof or whether it was actually one of those movies that's just so abominably bad that it ends up with a veneer of greatness because of its incredible ineptitude. Either interpretation is possible. One way or the other, it's not nearly as awful as the usual Sci-Fi (oh, excuse me, Syfy) Channel dreck, and as such you may consider it worth your time.

Cooper (Race to Witch Mountain's Chris Marquette) is a layabout whose insane father (Twin Peaks' Ray Wise) has gotten him a job at what seems to be a telemarketing firm. That, of course, is not going to last long. As he is called inot his boss' office to get fired, however, a loud, high-pitched whine overcomes them both. When Cooper comes to, he's encased in webs. He digs his way out and finds himself confronted with a whole office in webs, and what looks like a very large rhinoceros beetle threatening him. He starts digging out other people, hoping someone will have an explanation (or a way to stop the bugs), but it seems everyone he gets his hands on is even more lackadaisical than he is. Still, they set off for Cooper's father's survivalist mansion in the mountains, hoping the old man will have some ideas.

Infestation walks a very, very thin line between stupid and funny. It never quite manages to stay on one side or the other, as the best movies of this type do, but there's enough of both to satisfy most every taste, as well as some gratuitous nudity, a dash of violence, and some competent special effects. Overall... not horrible. Worth killing a few hours with. ** ",1251331200,2,1846,4.517964071856287

It says ITS GOOD, or they wouldn't let themselves be linked to it! Seriously, this is one of the best budget films I've seen in years! This is along the nature of some of the ""bug"" movies from the '50s, but much better done and with a more cohesive plot.

8354814,2,B0027ISJ1K,"Campy, end of the world dark comedy.  Cheesy story line, sets and special effects.  Actually it was not all that funny.  The comedy generally involves the characters hitting on each other during the crisis.  On the plus side, it was reasonably well acted.  At least they gave it some effort.  It has a ""shaggy dog"" ending.  It was as if there was they left an opening for a sequel.  I hate that and that is why it only got two stars.",1506902400,,433,4.2592592592592595
