838236,5,6304296312,This movie is a very charming and delightful story that leaves one with a very nice feeling when it is over.  It brings up good points about the age old debate of tradition versus progress.  It gives an interesting look into rural Welsh life and overall it is a fairly clean movie.  I very much recommend it.,1192320000,3,308,4.368421052631579

Others have given a clear enough synopsis, suffice it to say that if you enjoy curling up with a cup of tea and good, light horse movie, this is it. There are things you'll need to overlook: Daniel J. Travanti as a Welshman (insert a smile here), a bit of sappy dialog, some incorrect equine terminology (a mare is foaling 'out of season'?), and the step-son Cliff Dean with his cheesy Boy George hat. But, all in all, the Welsh Cob ponies (that's what Gwen and her Grandfather are raising: traditional Welsh Cobs) are amazing to watch and the scenery is lovely. I love the muddy ponies (who rides perfectly groomed horses in winter?) who gives it an authentic feel that's reinforced through the inclusion of Welsh actors/actresses (also, all of the village scenes were filled from people from the Glamorgan area, where it was filmed).

840055,1,6304296312,"SPOILER ALERT: This review contains detailed descriptions of the plot of this movie.

I really hate to pan this so hard, because I wanted so much for it to be good -- but it's so bad that I have to be honest about it. I really figured I would love this film -- cute film about girl with horses in rural Wales, overcoming all odds to keep her farm -- what's not to love, right? Oh, so wrong.

I hardly even know where to begin criticizing this awful film, but before I launch into my criticism of the acting and the script, let's just cover the issue of FIRE in this film, because I expect readers of this review may be wondering about the phrase ""grossly irresponsible"" in the title of this review.

There are two fire scenes.

Fire #1: Uncle Alan and his stepson Cliff are attempting to fix an old generator. It starts sparking and billowing smoke. They run away yelling (the scene of them running away yelling, by the way, is probably one of the most badly acted ""running away yelling"" scenes in the entire history of cinema, but I digress...). The women come out of the house, everybody laughs. The thing is still exploding. This piece of machinery is inside a building constructed of, and containing, flammable materials. The thing is exploding with showers of sparks, huge flashes and pops, copious billowing smoke. And these four people, who supposedly LOVE this farm, turn their backs on it and WALK AWAY LAUGHING as the thing is still exploding.

No matter how confident these characters may have been that there would not be a fire hazard (although I literally can't imagine how they would acquire such confidence), they should have waited until it stopped and made sure it was safe. And it's not as though they even SAY anything along the lines of, ""Don't worry, there's no way that thing can start a fire."" They don't raise the subject at all! They just turn their backs and stroll away in giggles, arm in arm, as the thing continues to pop and flash behind them.

Are these people INSANE? I don't mean the four who walked away -- they're not people, they're fictional characters and cannot be held responsible for their actions. I mean the people who wrote, directed, and edited that scene! It's particularly shocking given that the film seems to be aimed at a younger audience. It's sloppy and irresponsible.

Fire #2: Of course the only smoker in the film is the bad guy, Gwilyn, (rather a coincidence, I'd say, given that about a quarter of Welsh adults smoke, but I digress...) who, while opening the gates to free the horses, litters a burning cigarette butt and starts a fire in the barn. The main characters arrive home to find their (ALLEGEDLY) beloved farm ablaze. The lackluster way one of them says ""Oh, no..."" when they notice the fire almost made me turn the movie off, but by then I was already planning this review and I wanted to see how they handled Fire Scene #2. Just really bad acting.

Anyway, one of them goes to call the fire department. The remaining three adults then spend an inordinate amount of time helping the old man out of the burning building, apparently unconcerned about the HORSES (seriously, it would only have taken ONE of them, or at MOST two of them, to help the man--the third one is seeming to just follow along behind). Then Cliff (the one with arguably the least connection to the farm) is the first and ONLY person to remember about the foal (the FOAL, which half the plot revolves around, because it's supposedly going to SAVE THE FARM and all that), and courageously goes into the burning barn to save the foal. Gwyn (the girl, the protagonist) is still apparently completely unconcerned about any of the horses (including the foal), and so she tries to stop him. Then Cliff goes in to save the foal, everyone yells at him to get out of there, even though the building is barely burning. Naturally, the very instant he escapes with the foal, a big fiery beam falls right behind him, and then the building explodes--no doubt, because the flame had reached the flammable liquid fuel PROBABLY USED TO POWER THE DAMN GENERATOR.

I was speechless watching this. I mean, great job showing that tossing a lit cigarette into a pile of straw is a bad idea (DUH), but total FAIL on showing that giant smoking sparking electrical generators are anything worth even a second glance. I have lost two of the most important people in my life due to a fire, and I realize that many others probably can watch these scenes without reading into them what I did, but I find the way fire was treated in this film to be very irresponsible and badly written.

Now let's address the issue of these characters and how they relate to the HORSES. I mean, the whole movie is supposed to be about horses, right? This girl who loves her horse farm and loves her horses... yeah, not so much, though, actually.

The horses are clearly nothing more than a business to Gwyn, who would have been a MUCH more believable character had she at any point demonstrated a LOVE FOR HORSES or even for any one particular horse. She never says anything of the sort - she just wants to run the horse farm because she's ""always wanted to."" Wow, how compelling, I feel so invested in the character (NOT).

Random stepson Cliff (the one who cared enough to save the foal) is the ONLY one who even pays any attention to the foal AFTER his daring rescue, saying, ""Thank God he's all right."" Nobody else seems to give a damn. You'd think that even if all they cared about was the business, they'd care a tiny bit that the foal on which, according to the plot line, the future of their business heavily rests, had survived the fire. Apparently not.

Other Notably Lame Scenes:

1. So, the horses escaped, because remember, the smoking bad guy let them out. So the girl Gwyn wants to just give up. Wow, such love for the horses... Then she goes from ""we'll never find the horses, let's just give up"" to ""we'll find them, I know we will!"" because uncle Alan imparts the amazing advice that her grandfather ""was a lot of things, but he wasn't a quitter."" Wow, how inspirational. :-P

2. So then there's the big ""looking for the horses in the snow on Christmas morning"" scene, which is astonishingly bad. And at the end of it, after ALL this romantic tension between Gwyn and Cliff for the entire movie, he says to her, ""You're the only sister I've got."" Huh? Sister? She's not his sister or anything like it. She's his mother's ex-husband's niece, a point which is made quite clear early in the film in order to allow for the romantic tension to build between them, providing the competition for the bad guy Gwilyn (who also fancies Gwyn).

3. Cliff leaves Gwyn alone after he gets a cut on his knee. Alan gets annoyed at him for this, and suddenly Cliff is a whiny baby all, ""What was I supposed to do?"" ... Uh--you were supposed to man up, dude. Then Cliff tries to turn it into a family therapy session instead of focusing on the major immediate problems (missing horses, missing Gwyn, impending grazing deadline, burnt barn, etc.). Naturally, Gwyn (who has supposedly been riding in this area her entire life) makes a totally bonehead decision which leads to her falling off the horse.

My advice is that if you want to see beautiful Welsh scenery, watch a documentary, and if you want to see a movie about people who love horses, watch a different movie. If you notice bad acting and inconsistencies and are bothered by that sort of thing, watch a different movie. I hope this is helpful to some, in the sea of positive reviews about how this is just such an adorable movie.",1365379200,14,7582,4.5469208211143695

It takes place in Wales and is the story of a young woman named Gwen who has just lost her grandfather who owns a Welsh Pony farm. Her uncle who hasn't been home in many years and lives in America is put in charge of her future. There is a golf course owner who really wants the farm land, but Gwen is dead set against selling. But what is Uncle Allen going to do? Sell? or let her stay? She thinks the farm's welsh pony stallion has what it takes to help the farm take off again.

It is a really enjoyable movie. Great for the whole family and horse lovers.",1356912000,19,636,4.0
840061,5,6304296312,"This may not be the kind of story that many may appreciate because it isn't high tech nor does it have the high action-packed scenes that many look for in today's movies.  Instead, the Winter Stallion is a nicely-paced, heart-warming story about a young teenage girl whose guardian grandfather dies, leaving the estate, including the farm and many horses, to her estranged uncle from America who, by the way, shows up late along with his step-son for the grandfather's funeral.  Much to her disapproval, it is her uncle who has legally been given the final say of whether to sell the farm or not.

Enter the greedy commercial developer who wants to buy the farm for his profits to open a golf course.  He tries crooked means and intimidation to convince her uncle to sell the farm.  I won't spoil it by revealing how it ends but suffice it to say, you won't be disappointed.  This is a movie about reconciliation, redemption, and holding true to what you dream and believe in.  It is a nice, moral family movie.  Shot in Wales, the scenery is beautiful and the acting is quite good.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1334016000,,1108,4.612244897959184
840062,3,6304296312,"My sister gave this to me in the VHS format for Christmas three or four years ago and I do watch it every December, but it is not one of my favorite horse movies. The film was shot in Wales and stars Daniel Travanti (Hill Street Blues, Adam). The main character is a young girl who is dealt a blow at the beginning with the death of her grandfather, owner of a horse ranch, but she is reunited with her estranged uncle (Travanti) who now deals with the strong will of his niece who wants to keep the farm while he wants to sell it. Along the way we get an idea of peoples' lives in the small village in the wild country of Wales. Near the end comes the important race which I thought was a bit odd looking, but I am not used to entrants dressed up in outlandish costumes. The most interesting part of the race was the revealing of an incident that happened to Gwen's uncle when he was young that left him with a fear of horses that at least helps the viewer understand why he wants to sell the ranch. All in all, though, it did not hold my interest as National Velvet or Sylvester did, or even Phar Lap.",1236211200,,1103,4.111111111111111
