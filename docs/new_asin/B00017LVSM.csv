1975991,5,B00017LVSM,"These films are even more amazing than the original Walking with Dinosaurs. The animation is absolutly stunning, and Nigel Marven is great in the believable way he interacts with the creatures.  True, adding a Human host does mean the Dinos get a bit less screen time than in the original ""Walking"" - but it's quality over quantity in this case, and there's still more Dino action to enjoy here than in all three Jurassic Park movies combined. This is by far the best, and most realistic portrayal of prehistoric nature ever, and I for one sincerely hope Mr. Marven takes on another prehistoric safari soon!",1080950400,5,607,4.780952380952381
1975992,5,B00017LVSM,"""Walking with Dinosaurs"" was a technical marvel, and the BBC keeps spitting them out.  This latest offering, ""Chased by Dinosaurs"", is no exception.  This time, the narrator takes a back seat to our host, Nigel Marven.
The DVD is split into five episodes, each taking on a different time in history.  In ""The Giant Claw"", Nigel tries to track down the owner of a huge claw in Cretaceous Mongolia, and what he finds is nothing like what he expected.  ""Land of Giants"" finds our host in Cretaceous Argentina, where he witnesses a true clash of titans.  And in the three part ""Sea Monsters"", Nigel takes to the water to observe the worst the prehistoric oceans had to offer.
Each episode is well written and well done, and as one reviewer mentions, the animation has truely improved since ""Walking with Dinosaurs"".  Perhaps the best of the offerings is ""Sea Monsters"", where each episode ends with Nigel and crew facing a peril of some kind, and the viewer wondering, ""What happens next?""  As with the previous video releases, this is the original BBC airing, with no cuts.
Included with this DVD are trailers for ""Walking with Dinosaurs"", ""Walking with Beasts"", ""Walking with Cavemen"", and ""Blue Planet"".  There are also fact files for each of the animals encountered in the series, as well as an extra program, ""The Science of Giants"", from the BBC series ""Horizons"".  All in all, an must have for your ""Walking with..."" collection.",1080777600,9,1431,4.831967213114754
1975993,5,B00017LVSM,"This is newest DVD addition to the BBC Walking With Dinosaurs series and is surprisingly good!

Like the best of Jurassic Park but without all the subplots, Nigel Marven is a Jeff Corwin / Crocodile Dundee like character who time travels to prehistoric times (how he does it is never explained but that is really irrelevant) and brings us right with him into the adventure.

He gets into all kinds of interesting confrontations with dinosaurs on land, air, and sea and tries stuff that no sane human would attempt. Although some of his bravado backfires on him, this makes the whole premise at somewhat more believable.

The integration of live action, animation, and CGI is simply amazing. Taking some 21st Century technology with him, one scene has Nigel in an ultra-light flying amidst huge pterosaurs. Another has him actually catching a small dino in his ""camp"".

This is certainly the lightest episode but at the same time perhaps most interesting one in the series. Highly entertaining and you might even learn something new too!

A must see for dino-fans!",1080000000,59,1063,4.916201117318436

1975998,5,B00017LVSM,"Just worth the 30 dollars for ""Chased by Sea Monsters"". Nigel dives into the 7 crazies seas of all-time and comes face to face with some of the most terrifying and meanest beasts of all time. Dont worry he manages to survive in one piece.

 The land of giants was good too with Gigonotosaurs and many others that pop onto the scene.
The giant claw was pretty good too with Raptors and the Asian version of T-rex but I think bigger.

Zoologist Nigel Marvin guides viewers through unfamiliar prehistoric landscapes and oceans, helping people to imagine what it might be like to travel back in time.

A cornor was broken and  the top  was cracked across with a hole. I am keeping it because I had to take the celophane off the cassest and the possiblity of being able to get Chase by dinosaurs. I also checled the padded envelope which had just been thrown on the porch. There was evidence that a hefty person steped on it  causing the break I would suggest that you inform your deliverer not to throw envelopes that can fit in the mail box on the porch floor.

1976028,5,B00017LVSM,"By now, this impressively engrossing BBC series ""Chased by Dinosaurs"" (hereafter CBD) has been well dissected by the other Amazon posters here.  Though I have not read all of them, or even all of the 5-star reviews, I think I would probably agree with the sentiments of the 5-star reviews: CBD is a mind-boggling, wondrous pseudo-documentary about dinosaurs and other extinct creatures.

CBD works not just because we encounter well-rendered spectacular creatures like the gargantuan 100-ton sauropod Argentinosaurus, or the mega-crocodilian Sarcosuchus, or the genuinely freakish herbivorous theropod Therizinosaurus - renditions every bit the equal of the BBC ""Walking..."" series.  CBD succeeds because our Australian host, the appealingly ebullient zoologist/adventurer Nigel Marvin brings an unforced natural realism to the proceedings.  Unlike his late, animated compatriot, the ""Crocodile Hunter"" Steve Irwin, Nigel treats his fantastic adventures matter-of-factly like any other wildlife documentary, with awe, yes, but also with cooler professionalism and authority (no knock against Mr Irwin, of course).  He employs known and tested wildlife capture and observation techniques (i.e. those he would use on modern animals) on prehistoric beasts as well.  For example, he puts a sock over the head of a bipedal ostrich-like ornithiscian Mononykus to calm it down and examine it.  For the most part, however, Nigel is not there to trap any beasts, as he did in ""Prehistoric Park"".  He is there just to observe and give his audience detailed and amazing information about the animals.

More tellingly, Nigel does not pretend to have all the answers.  In ""The Giant Claw"" episode, set in Mongolia and China, Nigel discovers 3-foot, wickedly curved claws that would put Wolverine to shame and thinks he is on the trail of a carnivorous dinosaur even more fearsome than T-Rex.  When he finally catches up to his quarry, called Therizinosaurus, he realizes that his hypothesis does not quite match up.  This illustrates the scientific guesswork and trial-and-error involved in paleontological studies of long-gone animals and how our perspective of them constantly shifts as we learn more about them.

After witnessing fantastic dinosaurs and crocodiles, what do you do for an encore?  Well, Nigel turns to the ocean to try to determine the seven deadliest ocean creatures of all time.  Oscillating back and forth through time from the Devonian era to the Oligocene era (I think), Nigel finds and rates truly fabulous water freaks, such as the killer-whale sized fish Dunkleosteus (with bear trap jaw), the ancient sea-serpent-like giant whale Basilosaurus, and a 20-foot spiral-shelled crab-like arthropod Orthocone.  Some of his choices are unexpected; Nigel finds an ornery two-horned Arsinoetherium, which looks like a rhino, is semi-aquatic like a hippo, but is actually distantly related to the elephant.  Again, Nigel employs modern equipment and traps to lure the sea beasts for their close-up.  Despite the seriousness of his quests, Nigel is not afraid to show his comic side.  CBD frequently shows him narrowly escaping being bitten or gored.  In particular, during the Megalodon (a sperm-whale sized shark related to the great white) sequence, when he initially fails to attach an underwater camera to its dorsal fin from a boat, he gets exasperated and calls one of the crew members who caused him to miss ""an idiot"" (he apologizes afterwards).  But generally, Nigel gets along with the people who aid his dangerous quests.  With their help, Nigel finally does get to the deadliest sea creature.  I won't reveal what it is, but it lives in what Nigel calls ""Hell's Aquarium"" and is certainly a sight to see.  As in the ""Walking..."" series and ""Prehistoric Park"", CBD has its cliffhangers and morbid humor, especially at the very end of ""Chased by Sea Monsters"".

In addition to Nigel's romps, CBD has two more conventional paleontology episodes; the first one concerns the discovery in Argentina of the (to date) world's largest herbivorous and carnivorous dinosaurs (Argentinosaurus and Giganotosaurus).  The second one explores the hypothesis by paleontologist Phillip Currie that carnivorous dinosaurs like Albertosaurus and T-rex were not solitary hunters, but formed cooperative packs.

In conclusion, if you are a paleontology, wildlife, dinosaur, prehistoric beast, or Nigel fan, give yourself a treat and watch CBD.  Both your emotions and your brain will thank you.",1334102400,,4488,5.4094827586206895
1976029,5,B00017LVSM,"It really is a great DVD for kids, even little ones, who are fascinated with dinosaurs.  The CGI is top notch, and Nigel Marvin is very engaging.  He takes the concept that he is on safari with dinosaurs in the distant past utterly seriously, and it is appreciated.  Kids can tell when an adult is patronizing them, and there is none of that here.  He really is great about it.  The stories are interesting and just the right length.  It's a good DVD for Mom and Dad to watch with the kids as well--at least the first dozen or so viewings until you have the dialog memorized, but I digress.

They don't pretend that meat eaters don't hunt/kill other animals, but it isn't graphically represented, or dwelt upon too heavily.  Our son gets the concept that ""meat"" is other animals, but we don't have to have a long conversation about killing or death.  It's the perfect balance of being factual, but not too heavy handed.

He even runs around the house with his little binoculars yelling ""I'm Nigel Marvin!"" after imaginary dinosaurs, so I think that tells you all you need to know about this DVD.  Excellent choice.",1319587200,,1114,4.575757575757576

He also gets almost eaten by the giant crocodile sarcosuchus imperator(giant flesh eating crocodile).This is in the episode ""the land of giants"".

  In the episode ""the giant claw"" he visits one of the most strangest looking dinosaurs the therizinosaurus a plant eating dinosaur with long arms and very long claws that it uses to defend itself against meat eating dinosaurs that try to attack it. The last episode is from chased by sea monsters and shows life in the early oceans with different kinds of sea creatures.

The dinosaur animation is awesome - BBC's combination of CGI with very realistic animatronics beats the pure CGI productions any day - but what truly sets this apart is how Nigel manages to give a human scale to these prehistoric animals in a fun and enthusiastic way.  It has my five year old son yearning to be a paleontologist and me feeling like a kid again.

BBC was one of the studios that really capitalized on this, especially wit their Walking With Dinosaurs series.  Part of this is the Chased by Dinosaurs episodes, which is 2.5 hours long, 1.5 hours of which is the Chased by Sea Monsters miniseries.  Starring in all of them is Nigel Marven, who adds a touch of British humor to the science and action of the show.  A nice feature on this DVD is the special features, which shows how paleontologists discovered that the big carnosaurs were pack hunters.  The show does deliver on entertainment value, with great CGI, lots of scenes of predators eating prey, and minimal screentime of humans narrating.

Also, they focused on dinsaurs other than the T.rex(except for slight mention when Nigel compars a Therizenasaurus claw to T.rex's)
I also liked the fact that it WAS NOT like Jurissic Park at all to wear people get eaten. I't 100% educational, and there still are cases when Nigel meeets up with a carnivore, and has to use his experience to escape.
I want to get on thing straight right now. If you ever read A.Burchfeild's review(The part that says Nigel just walked around and touched dinousarus)is just as much as a lie that Pteranodons are birds. The ONLY dinosur Nigel touched was a Therizenasaurus that he had to stalk up  cautiously on, to show the tranquiltity of this specific herbivore and then it didn't tend to be a carnivore at all.
The only thing i'm going to complain about(and it's not even enough to take away 1/3 of a star about) is that when Nigel runs away from a carnivore, his running is not how a person would really run if they were being chased by a attacking dinosaur.

Still,showing animals in that light has proven to create more of an interest in them. On the plus side, the choice of creatures is unusual in the fact that the best known make way to showcase others that were equally spectacular, but not so well known, broadening the range of extinct species.

1976073,5,B00017LVSM,"Chased By Dinosaurs - A Walking with Dinosaurs Special, and Sea Monsters - A Walking with Dinosaurs Trilogy are the 4th and 5th ""walking with"" programs.

Starting with Chased by Dinosaurs, as others have stated this is a two part program, one being ""Land of Giants"", and the other ""The Giant Claw"". On this release, ""Land of Giants"" comes first, followed by ""The Giant Claw"", but they were aired in the opposite order on television, and ""The Giant Claw is actually the first program.

That being said, this is one awesome documentary! It begins with Nigel already back in time (how he managed to get there is left up to the viewers imagination) and from there he carries out whatever particular challenge he's set for himself.

Sea Monsters is the same deal, only this time he's dealing with... Sea Monsters. He travels through the 7 deadliest oceans of all time, starting from the bottom and working his way up. Again, this has the same high production standards and is highly entertaining.

Some have complained about the fact that they've introduced ""talking heads"" into the ""walking with"" series and that it was a mistake. I completely disagree, I was a bit skeptical at first and didn't know how it would fare, but it turned out perfectly. Nigel Marven was the perfect naturalist for this, cause' he is a great actor. You completely believe that he is looking at dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures. This is also achieved by the top-notch effects. The CGI models are fantastic and look just as good as ""Walking with Dinosaurs"". (if not slightly better)

His interactions with these animals are perfect, and done very realistically I might add. Nigel has some close scrapes, but if the dinosaurs have their natural prey or Nigel is too hard to get to they won't bother.

Another complaint some have had is that there is too much Nigel and not enough dinosaurs. That is completely false; it is jam-packed with dinosaurs and all kinds of other prehistoric creatures. Hardly a minute goes by without some prehistoric animals. And it's like a nature program; they still have to show him tracking the creatures a little bit.

So, if you are considering picking this one up for whatever reason, then definitely do so. Another great addition to the ""walking with"" collection, highly recommended!",1157932800,4,2298,4.861892583120205

1976075,5,B00017LVSM,"I thought this DVD would be a lame remake of WWD. I couldn't have been more wrong. Here are a few things I loved about it:

1. It went beyond T. Rex. While T. Rex and friends are great to see, this DVD introduces some new dinosaurs that are really phenomenal, from the largest land carnivore ever, Giganatosaurus, to the largest sea turtle ever, Archelon.

2. While I thought having a human might be annoying, it actually is great because it gives the viewer a good sense of the scale of the dinosaurs. It is amazing to see how small Marven is next to the sarcosuchus, or supercroc. It adds a new level of depth to visualizing dinosaurs.

3. Great CG. Even better than WWD. The interaction with Marven was a tough feat to accomplish, but it is done superbly. Also, I like the fact that the dinosaurs have more colors, as they probably would have in real life.

4. Marven's narrating isn't half bad. He may not be Attenborough, but I think he brings the right attitude to the film and makes it more believable.

The only major drawback is that, because of the human interaction, there may be less overall footage of dinosaurs. This is particularly true for the sea monsters section. However, because this is not merely a half-hour special, but rather 150 minutes, you definitely get your money's worth.",1153958400,5,1301,4.5665236051502145

In Sea Monsters, he shows the scariest beasts of all time, which lived in the water.

 All of the footage in this tape is backed up by the fifty minute featurette, The Science of Giants.

1976078,5,B00017LVSM,"PUT SIMPLY -- AN AWESOME WONDROUS ESCURSION INTO THE DANGEROUS UNKNOWN!

OVERVIEW --

""Chased By Dinosaurs"",starring Nigel Marven is the most compelling and satisfying program about dinosaurs ever! Wondrous and awesome are just too small to describe this excursion into the dangerous unknown. This program has just one small problem, 218 minutes is just much too short for this program. I have seen this program frequently, but always in one sitting! AWESOME & WONDROUS JUST WON'T DO!

Where ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" and ""Prehistoric Beasts"" were awesomely realistic educational tools, ""Chased by Dinosaurs"" adds the two elements already present in the series, but now in the Mega-doses that Dinosaurs deserve -- EXCITEMENT & JOYOUS ENTERTAINMENT.

FOR PARENTS: there's NO CLOCK-WATCHING while this program is running.

 -*- SO WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

 -*- HOW IS THIS PROGRAM DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS IN THE SERIES?

The other ""Walking With"" programs are empirical, educational tools that have no equal, but young children, who traditionally are the biggest dinosaur enthusiasts, find them a bit difficult to stay focused on. This time travel format hosted by Nigel Marven is especially valuable for children, though I found it for myself to be the most compelling of the entire series.

The first episode [28 minutes] - ""THE GIANT CLAW"" serves notice that man and dinosaur will be sharing the same world and even the same frames on film. In the first 3 minutes, Nigel Marven is almost eaten several times in what look to be real man-meets-dinosaur encounters. It's just the beginning!

Episode 2 [28 minutes] - ""LAND OF THE GIANTS"" introduces us to the recently discovered, largest dinosaurs [so far]. In the world of dinosaurs, bigger is always more interesting. The Argentinasaurus weighs in at 92 tons and we see Nigel actually put the scales under the dinosaur, as a herd of Argentinasauruses passes by. You don't have to be a child to get excited over this!

The last part, ""Chased By Sea Monsters"", is ther real treat on this DVD. Because its scope and requisite length is larger, it is broken into 3 segments [28 minutes each]. Basically, using a time machine [a device that we don't see except for its results], Nigel Marven and his brave crew check out the 7 most dangerous oceans of all time. These are shown in order of ascending danger, the 7th most dangerous ocean shown first and the most dangerous shown last. The timeline goes back and forth, but it allows a very effective building of tension. Each paleo-ocean is filled with exotic and dangerous denizens of the deep that are more menacing with each new ocean. Young children can't keep their eyes off this segment and frankly neither can I.

 -----*- BONUS DOCUMENTARY: ""THE SCIENCE OF GIANTS"" --

This 50-minute special feature is about as good as it gets when it comes to dinosaur documentaries. ""Science of Giants"" examines a relatively new and previously unproven theory regarding the herding tendencies of the largest carnivores, previously assumed to be solitary creatures. We witness the efforts of paleontologist Philip Currie in his coordinated efforts to prove that ""megacarnivores"" actually hunted and lived in packs.

""Fact Files"" are also included within the Special Features that provide quick, basic info about the dinosaurs that are included in the series.

This is very interesting and it is quick and easy reference.

THE VERDICT -- MORE PLEASE! --

It doesn't get any better than this! Throughout the five-part, time machine sequences we have Nigel Marven in the same frames as the dinosaurs and every moment is spent entertainingly, usefully, and educationally.

FOR FURTHER VIEWING:

""Walking With Dinosaurs"" and ""Walking With Prehistoric Beasts"" are the most educationally significant videos of their kind. However, ""Prehistoric Beasts"" deals primarily with huge mammals and human ancestors making it inherently interesting to me. The lives of huge mammals are also followed, many of which are as large as dinosaurs.

There is also ""Allosaurus-A Walking With Dinosaurs Special"", based on a recent find. An extrapolation of ""Big Al's"" life and death is the focus of this treat, along with a documentary which explains how that extrapolation was made. For these, Kenneth Branagh is the narrator and he is very well-suited for the role.

""Walking with Monsters - Life Before Dinosaurs DVD"" hosted by Kenneth Branagh has recently been released, and I have just seen it. The special effects are the best yet, but intrinsically these are basically pre-dinosauric animals which are inherently less interesting. I would still give this program 5 stars, but it is not in the same class as ""Chased By Dinosuars"" when it comes to generating viewer excitement.

""CHASED BY DINOSAURS"" hosted by Nigel Marvin is a sort of Jurassic Park for Dino-education, and is simply the best program of its kind that have ever seen, by a very long margin.",1144195200,7,4947,5.091584158415841

Everything's happening fast.(Like in one sceen Nigel is driwing away from a Giganotosaurus, then flies in the next, then driwes again.)There are too many Nigels and less dinosaurs than usual.

1976090,5,B00017LVSM,"The BBC has come up with a worthy follow-on to Walking With Dinosaurs. The DVD includes two episodes of Chased By Dinosaurs (Cretaceous Mongolia and Argentina), three episodes of Chased by Sea Monsters (numerous time periods), as well as a documentary.

The effects are spectacular (especially when Nigel Marvin is putting out the scales to try and weigh an Argentinosaurus; at point I thought ""Wow, that looks real!"") and the diversity of creatures shown adds a lot of flavor to the series (my wife won't sit through it again after the tent scene in Mongolia).

No annoying paleontologist blurbs and cut-scenes, explaining stuff you already know.

Finally, there is the sheer fun of hoping that Nigel Marvin will get gobbled up by a Tarbosaurs, Sarchosuchus, or Liopleurodon.

BBC, please, may I have another!",1125446400,10,810,5.067669172932331
1976091,5,B00017LVSM,"My six year old son can't get enough of this DVD.  We don't have cable so we don't get to watch these great shows on TV when they actually debut.

This is fun, exciting, and sparks the imagination of not only the little one in our family.  Nigel Marvin is great and the special effects are wonderful.  After watching this DVD when we rented it, we went to the BBC website and played games that had to do with this program.  It was lots of fun and we got to catch sea monters of our own.

If you or your little ones love dinosaurs and creative shows, this is the one for you.  Money well spent.  A good investment for both entertainment value and educational value as well.",1123200000,7,672,4.1953125

1976093,3,B00017LVSM,"I've collected, I think, all of the BBC Dinosaur sets- even got the companion book to ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" but think this DVD is in some ways the most disappointing one of the series.

I liked the idea of a man doing the nature program bit and the dinosaurs did look very good (especially at a distance, some of the CG stuff didn't do as well up close as the animatronics did). The ultralight flight with the pteranadons was a little silly but sure looked good. When I got to thinking about it there were a lot of flaws for anyone past 12 or so years in age.

A good part of the time it didn't seem as if there was any indication of a film crew even being there, not at camp or anywhere else- Marvin was just talking to us. I guess someone noticed that because when they did the Sea Monsters segments you saw several other people as I think you really would in a genuine documentary.

Big, potentially dangerous creatures, yet this guy was always going around and patting the things on some body part or other, or grabbing a tail. No one ever carried any sort of weaponry, Mr. (Dr.?) Marvin used an airhorn to scare off some velociraptors in one episode (you heard a camera man off screen in that segment)and carried an electric cattleprod or a bright flashlight in his sea adventures. If time travelers were to walk with the dinosaurs they'd be carrying BIG guns because you couldn't count on being able to run away in a dangerous situation. Nice to look at but not as good as I'd hoped.",1121299200,3,1492,4.359712230215828
1976094,3,B00017LVSM,"This is one of those DVDs you can enjoy time and time again.  We bought this for our two children but we enjoy it as much as they do.  My four year old absolutely loves it and has learned so much from the program.  He can now name most of the dinosaurs and reptiles featured in the show on sight and will politely correct his playmates when they mistakenly refer to a Diplodocus as a Brontosaurus!  The host, Nigel Marvin, has that charming british style that definitely makes this DVD a top shelf addition to anyone's collection.",1111536000,13,530,4.43298969072165
1976095,5,B00017LVSM,"My 6-year old son has 4 of the recent dino DVDs created with computer-generated graphics:

* Chased by Dinosaurs (BBC)

* Allosaurus (BBC)

* Walking With Dinosaurs (BBC)

* Dinosaur Planet (Discovery Channel)

I have reviewed all the others, too.

The BBC productions are all far better quality than Dinosaur Planet.  But Dinosaur Planet has longer stories, and the dinos are given names and more personality, which appeals to kids.

Of the BBC productions, Chased by Dinosaurs is the best.  They are all exceptional.  You'd think somebody managed to go back in time and shoot film of real dinosaurs.  In fact, that is the plot of Chased by Dinosaurs.  The host, Nigel Marvin, is something of a ""dinosaur hunter"", ala the Crocodile Hunter series. He goes back in time and interacts with marvelous dinosaurs in 3 long episodes.  The animation is brilliant!  In one moment, Nigel captures a small bird-like dinosaur.  In another, a T-Rex nearly back into Nigel, who is hiding in the bushes.  The animation is just mind-blowing.

This is absolutely my son's favorite. He's old enough to know that Nigel Marvin didn't really go back in time.  But he's young enough to be absolutely delighted by the possibility.",1111017600,44,1208,4.925373134328358

1976097,5,B00017LVSM,"This ""Walking with dinosaurs"" special DVD is full of information about the great predators that thrived before our existence and even before dinosaurs. It's exciting and new and Nigel Marvin does an awesome job taking you through time on his adventure to get up close and personal with everything on land, in the air, and under water. He brings you to the largest land animal to ever exist(Argentinasaurus), to the biggest predator to ever walk the Earth(Giganotosaurus). Nigel dives into the the seven deadliest seas of all time from over 400 million years ago with the Giant Orthocones to as close as a million years ago with Carcharodon Megalodon, the greatest shark of all time, and all the way to hell's aquarium. This DVD is a must have. There are few other prehistoric documentaries that can get better this.",1100822400,8,815,4.870503597122302
1976098,5,B00017LVSM,"This thrilling DVD was a joy to watch.  Nigel Marvin is great, and his filmed ""adventures"" in time seem extremely real.  I had to sometimes tell myself that this was all scripted and not real.  Amazing effects and good ""acting"" on Nigel's part really made you feel that way.  I highly recommend this DVD, and would like to see more made.  Let's hope if this happens, Nigel will return, and not be replaced by someone extremely irritating and dim-witted like Steve Irwin, a.k.a the ""crocodile hunter"".",1085443200,4,500,4.767441860465116

But he doesn't like the cartoon friendly dinos, he wants the real thing. This movie is probably still a bit mature for him, but it's a rather toned down ""documentary"" that isn't terribly gory. The host is always running around trying to touch the dinosaurs or see how fast they run, and it's fun watching him interact with the dinos.
It's good at holding attention of both him and my husband, and the information seems to fit with most of the dinosaur films we've seen. It's a bit cheesy, but in a fun way.

I was originally put off because I loved Walking With Dinosaurs, and loved the conceit of having a window into the past that looked real. Chased by Dinosaurs injects a ""host"" who's time-traveled back to interact with the dinosaurs & act as the show's Attenborough-alike. Initially, I thought it undercut the realism of the Walking With Dinosaurs series - but over a few viewings, I've really grown fond of the series.

The last episode, where you go through the ""deadliest sea monsters"" is really fantastic.

This seems to have been removed from most streaming services - it used to be available on Netflix, but it's not anymore, and I couldn't find it anywhere. Happy to finally have a copy of my own.
