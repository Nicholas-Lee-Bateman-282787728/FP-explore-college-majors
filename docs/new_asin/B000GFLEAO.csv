2606868,5,B000GFLEAO,"I am very much looking forward to this release.

However, having said that, that art work is pitiful. Let's hope that is just a temporary picture because the actual cover is not yet available! Those three pictures were all used on the season 2.0 disks. Let's see something new!

In defence of the two separate releases: on the bright side it means those who do not live in the US of A (i.e. me) can watch the first half of the show before waiting for the whole season to air.",1152144000,,475,4.266666666666667
2606869,4,B000GFLEAO,"I love Galactica.  I am a fan of the original series, but I have to say I love this version better.  It delves into questions of morality and spirituality which the original series never did.  It explains how a man like Baltar can betray his race, instead of the mustache twirling villian from the original.

It has taken the best elements (and some storylines) from Babylon 5 and Space Above and Beyond and improved upon them.  Worth watching,  best kept secret.  BUT...

Why nickel and dime the fans?  If season 2 is twenty episodes long.  Package them in a single set and sell them.  I bought season one, but I refuse to purchase this fragmented set.  Why overpay for BG when say Fox figured out it could move entire seasons of the X-Files at a reduced price?

Wait until they put it in one package.  Buy the X-Files insead.  Its the superior show and you get more for your money.",1152057600,15,883,4.43125
2606870,5,B000GFLEAO,"I'm really looking forward to this DVD release. A lot of ""Battlestar Galactica"" fans have had negative things to say about Season 2.0, Volume 2. I agree with some of the criticism, but not all of it. The one real problem I have with this show is that most episodes are very predictable and many of the storylines just keep recycling themselves. Almost every episode in this season seems to revolve around Adama, Starbuck, or Apollo being in mortal peril...that gets kind of old after a while. However, in spite of that, this is still a great show. It's so FRACKIN' INTENSE! A lot of important things happened during this season involving Adama's clash with the commander of the Pegasus ship, President Roslin's terminal cancer diagnosis, Starbuck and Apollo's personal relationships and professional development, Gaius Baltar's rise to power, and the cylon's infiltration into what is left of the human race.

I don't want to spoil the season for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, but there are plenty of ""shock and awe"" moments to look forward to. Beloved characters will die, surprise relationships will form, and the season finale cliffhanger is unlike anything you've ever seen in the series before! NOTHING will prepare you for what happens during the last 15 minutes of the final episode!

I can't wait until the new season debuts this fall, but until then, I'm looking forward to catching last season's episodes for the second time with this DVD set.",1151971200,4,1454,4.90650406504065
2606871,4,B000GFLEAO,"For those already familiar to the series: This set of DVDs offers some decent bonuses- you'll find that it includes an expanded version of the midseason cliff-hanger ""Resurrection Ship"" with some deleted scenes incorporated into the show.  I liked this a lot, because watching the deleted scenes seperately from the show/movie usually loses some of the impact of the scenes.  This alone makes the two part season purchase worthwhile in my opinion.  The other extra material is standard- commentary and making of features.

In the second half of Battlestar Galactica's second season, you will enjoy the resolution to the arrival of the Pegasus in the climax of ""Resurrection Ship"".  The show also brings the resistance movement on Caprica into better focus, and makes the characters there more important to the overall story.  One aspect of season two that I am not completely sold on at this point is the expansion of the Cylon's internal structure, as expressed in the Cylon war-hero story.  I think I enjoyed the mystery and confusion behind their true motives.  It would be a shame for the arch-villains to become predictable and stale.

For those already addicted to this show, 2.5 will satisfy you to a point, but I believe the finale will only be justified by where the show goes in season 3.  Right now I am a little skeptical, and will even go so far as saying it approaches the hokey sci-fi clichs (granted, clichs that we all like to watch) that the show has so assiduously avoided so far.  One thing the final episode will do is set up a whole new string of story possibilities in the coming season/seasons; it is such a crazy ender that I don't see how they can possibly resolve the issues in the first episode or even entire season 3.  Maybe that's what the whole idea ultimately is about: creating more story possibilities.  The final cliffhanger is not quite as emotional as the assassination at the end of season 1, but it will leave you wanting more.

If you happen to be a new to this sci-fi phenomenon, I highly recommend you first watch season 1.  This series is not the typical sci-fi that is `plug and play' at any point in the series (ala most Trek series).  If you jump in midstream, you'll probably find yourself asking ""what the ____?"" and ""why do I care about this character?"".  This quality is one of the shows strong points, conflicts are not resolved every 50 minutes and tidily packaged so that the next episode will be back at square one.  Like real life the problems and troubles often follow the characters through their journey.  And I will add this - Battlestar Galactica manages to bridge the gap between `sci-fi' people and people who typically don't watch sci-fi.  I can say this with nearly complete certainty.  I am a sci-fi person in the military, and I have enjoyed spreading this show around- despite many initial and long term refusals.  Right now the tide has turned and most of my fellow officers and many men in the battalion are hooked on the show.  So give it a shot, you won't be disappointed.",1151884800,141,3044,4.680451127819549
2606872,4,B000GFLEAO,"Well, the second half of season 2 is finally going to be released. While it's true that the second 1/2 is kind of slow, I'm willing to be patient and see what season 3 brings us. Kind of like Babylon 5 season 1; it was slow and _seemed_ disjoined, until you started to look closer at what was happening and as the season progressed.

I understand that this DVD set will include the 1 1/2 hour version of ""Pegasus"", which is supposed to explain a lot more realistically why things go south between Adama and Cain.",1151798400,3,512,4.333333333333333
2606873,5,B000GFLEAO,"I've had some discussions with some of my friends about these last 10 episodes, and we've had our differences over the quality of the show. In any lengthy series there will be stretches where the going  appears to be a bit slow. I think the authors decided to slow down the pace of a few episodes to expand the characters a bit more. For a couple of weeks I didn't really feel the story was going anywhere, but that all changed and the plot thickened and accelerated simultaneously. Other than Pegasus, I don't think a single episode was as surprising or out-of-your-chair-biting-your-nails suspenseful as the season finale. All in all, an EXCELLENT season. I'm already on edge over season 3.",1151798400,,692,4.766666666666667
2606874,5,B000GFLEAO,"I love this show! In addition to being a great sci-fi series, it works perfectly well as a gritty drama. In the wake of the attempted genocide of the human race, a fleet of 50,000 survivors have left their homes in an attempt to escape their oppressors, the half human/half machine Cylons, in an attempt to find refuge on a little planet called Earth.
Led by President Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell), who is dying of cancer, and Commander William Adama (Edward James Olmos), the fleet was last seen about to do battle with... fellow humans? Yes, after the discovery that the Battlestar Pegasus has also been on the run in the 7 or so months since the Cylons attacked the 12 Colonies of Kobol, a disagreement about leadership has Adama and Roslin looking down the figurative barrel at Admiral Cain (Michelle Forbes), the commanding officer aboard the Pegasus and Adama's superior. The two-parter ""Resurrection Ship"" shows that the immaculate pair of Adama and Roslin can sink very low if they need to in order to protect the fleet. The two episodes also contain a huge revelation regarding the Cylons that may allow the humans to actually begin to have a chance at combatting their enemies.
As the second half of the second season progresses, the characters that we've grown to love (or in some cases, love to hate), are put through more trials as they deal not only with the Cylon threat, but also each other. Vice President Gaius Baltar (James Callis) has his loyalties divided due to the discovery of a captured Model No. 6 (Tricia Helfer) aboard the Pegasus. Of course, the twist is that they are divided three ways; to his fellow humans, to the corporeal 6 (known, possibly as a joke to a group of people who dislike the show, who call the show GINO, or Galactica In Name Only) as Gina, and finally to the mental 6 that he sees in his head. Capt. Lee ""Apollo"" Adama, the commander's son, is given more responsibility as his role as pilot and CAG is expanded to do gritty missions, including shutting down a black market ring. Of course, the now Captain Kara ""Starbuck"" Thrace acts tough as usual (but then, we wouldn't have it any other way), though her position as best pilot/biggest b**** aboard Galactica is challenged by one of the pilots she trained in season 1. And the love triangle of Sharon ""Boomer"" Valerii/No. 8 (Grace Park), Chief Tyrol (Aaron Douglas), and Karl ""Helo"" Agathon (Tahmoh Penniket) is further strained by the arrival of the cylon/human hybrid baby as well as the creation of a kind of ""love trapazoid"" when Cally (Nikki Clyne) begins to express her feelings for Tyrol. Even another love triangle forms when Lee begins to become the object of affection of Dualla (Kandyse McClure), much to the disappointment of her boyfriend Billy (Paul Campbell).
Unfortunately, these 10 episodes contain some of the weakest of the show's run.  Episodes like ""Scar"" and ""Black Market"" are only ok by comparison to some of the show's episodes, most of which are amazing.  Still, the weakest episode of Galactica is still 10 times better than the best episodes of most of what's on television these days.  There are many really good episodes in this set, including ""The Captain's Hand"", and ""Sacrifice"".  Also, the two-part ""Resurrection Ship"" is wonderful, as is ""Downloaded"", which is told from the point of view of the Cylons on the planet Caprica.  However, I must say that ""Lay Down Your Burdens, Pts. 1 and 2"" have ousted ""Pegasus"" as my new favorite episode(s).  While the season finale does share a slight similarity with the season 1 ender (the discovery of a planet), it is handled much differently this time around, and there are numerous other things going on.  By the year's end, another Cylon model will be revealed (taking the total to 7 known models and 5 to be discovered), a few characters in the military will be promoted, and, in the second part of the season finale (which is an extended episode), there will be more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at, especially in the last half hour.
The writers continue to impress as the characters are taken in great new and terrifying directions.  This show is unpredictable, and it revels in going places many shows fear to tread.  Every character is flawed in some way, and the people inhabiting the universe of BSG are some of the most human characters on television.  Sadly, we didn't see much of Ellen Tigh (Kate Vernon), the insane wife of Galactica's executive officer Col. Saul Tigh (Paul Hogan).  On his own, Tigh is a self-destructive alcoholic, but Ellen serves to take all his worse tendencies and amplify them, as well as planting ideas of ambition in his head (think Lady Macbeth crossed with 24's Sherry Palmer).  Ellen is despicable, but she is part of what makes this show great; she forces Tigh to confront his demons in the most twisted ways imaginable.
The stories are also amazing; the show is very much a product of a post-9/11 America, and that is reflected in the grim, survivalist nature of the fleet.  The humans once thought that nothing could touch them, but now their entire way of living has been obliterated, and they must scrape by living on crowded ships with meager rations to sustain them.  Furthermore, the lines of good and evil aren't drawn clearly; the Cylons view their actions as just and right.  Even though they claim not to condone murder, in this case, the ends justified the means.  And of course, no human is completely good or evil.  Even Baltar, who can't seem to pick a side, can't always be blamed for his actions, as he is certifiably insane.  That doesn't make his horrible decisions and actions right, but he isn't doing them because he is ""evil"".  In a clever twist, the writers even reversed the roles of religion on the show; most of the time in film and television, the protagonists are monotheistic (unless they live in a time/place in history where a polytheistic religion is practiced), but here, the ""good"" humans are the polytheists while the ""evil"" Cylons worship the ""one true God"".
Battlestar Galactica is without a doubt one of the best series on television.  While many people tend to look down on science fiction series as trivial and childish, this is anything but.  The messages that are found layered within the plots of the story accurately reflect the state of the world today.  If you don't want to take my word for it, look at the numerous mainstream critics who love the show, such as Time Magazine (which listed it has the best new show of 2005) and Entertainment Weekly, which is trying to get the show nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Drama (which, unfortunately, it probably won't get due to the academy's phobia of sci-fi; but then again, LOST won, so I guess anything's possible).  If you have yet to check this show out, buying season 1 should be a top priority for you!",1151366400,272,6843,4.722315436241611

2606883,4,B000GFLEAO,"I never really thought of my self as a science fiction fan, so I have to admit that my cousin forced me to watch the miniseries with him when I was visiting him (this was in 2008). I saw myself as more of a chick flick kind of person, so I couldn't believe how quickly I got into this story - if you don't see yourself as into this genre, this will change your mind. The writing, the actors, everything is so well done. After watching my cousins DVDs through the first half of season 2, I started buying my own so that I could catch up and watch them as they aired. I cant believe how much I squeezed into just a few months. Since then, Ive watched the series several times and love it as much as the first time I saw it.  I know this is a really cheesy thing to say, but it has made me think about what other life there could be beyond our planet. The other thing is that watching this has  led me to watch all things Edward James Olmos and Law and Order U.K., which stars Jamie Bamber. I don't want to say Battlestar Galactica has taken over my life, but it has definitely been more than a passing interest.",1456790400,,1109,4.059360730593608

2606929,5,B000GFLEAO,"Season 2.5 of the re-imagined ""Battlestar Galactica"" was an interesting mixed bag of experiences.  It contained a couple of standalone, throwaway episodes (""Scar"" and ""Sacrifice"") while also containing ones that really went a long way towards pushing the plot forward and revealing the underlying natures and motivations of the humans and Cylons (""Epiphanies"" and ""Downloaded"")

  This season also contained what was, arguably, the worst episode of the entire series:  ""Black Market"".  I have no doubt that the idea of Lee Adama having an existential crisis, while dealing with a real crisis among the seedy underbelly of Colonial society, sounded good in concept.  Unfortunately, the execution was extremely unsatisfying and did not help fans bond with Lee any further.  Luckily, BSG's showrunners realized this misstep and the new characters and plotlines introduced during ""Black Market"" were quickly forgotten.

  2.5 both began and ended in dramatic fashion.  The resolution of the strife with Pegasus and Admiral Cain comes to a head when they unite forces to try and take out a Cylon resurrection ship, the very technology that allows the humanoid Cylons to regenerate.  It ends with discovery and settlement upon the harsh, but habitable, world of New Caprica.  The relief of finding a livable planet comes to a stunning and shocking end in the final scenes of the season.",1374364800,,1380,5.270642201834862
2606930,4,B000GFLEAO,"This installment does a great job of illustrating differing perceptions, reactions and judgments of the Cylons by various key players and then spinning out intense and compelling story arcs from those attitudes.  These story arcs present a great mirror for us viewers to re-examine our own processes of how and why we judge cultures that differ from our own, and the possibility of finding our way to an attitude of ""fluidity"" about our cultural affinities.  The middle episodes ""Scar"" and ""Sacrifice"" felt a bit like ""semi-filler"" to me, although the latter clearly illustrates my point about ""culture fluidity"" in the previous sentence.",1368230400,,638,5.245098039215686

2606937,4,B000GFLEAO,"Ron Moore, one of the brains behind Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, took his darker view of sci-fi to the new Battlestar Galactica series with generally positive results. This isn't Star Trek by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, it's tough to compare BSG to any other sci-fi show. It combines an in-depth story arc, top-notch acting, realistic special effects, and a pseudo-documentary cinematic style to create a unique experience.

Unlike Star Trek, BSG tries to depict a gritty, realistic vision of humanity's future. In the first few episodes, a race of evil robots called the Cylons attack 12 human colonies, leaving only a few tens of thousands of humans left in the galaxy. The humans band together in a convey of ships to search for Earth.

Amongst the main characters, the acting ranges from good to excellent. In particular, Edward James Olmos as Admiral Adama is absolutely amazing at conveying the burdens of command. I first saw Olmos as Detective Gaff in Blade Runner and never could have imagined him as the star of a TV series, but he really shines. Mary McDonnell as Laura Roslin also wins plaudits as perhaps the most convincing female president ever portrayed on TV.

As much as I like individual episodes in Season 2, the meta-plot as a whole is somewhat ridiculous. Season 2 ventured heavily into pseudo-religious nonsense. I have nothing against religion, but the use of religious metaphors in BSG was always a bit too on the nose. Oddly, the show doesn't use religion to talk about morality, in the way that Star Trek was often a series of morality plays, but rather as plot devices. By Season 2, the president is running around looking for Earth based on religious prophecies. Meanwhile, everybody proclaims that the baby of a human and Cylon is the ""sign of things to come"" without ever explaining the baby's significance to the audience.

Unfortunately, the Cylons just don't work as the main villains. To put it bluntly, they're boring and not particularly threatening after the first few episodes. The idea of biological machines is never really explained satisfactorily - the Cylons appear to be exact copies of humans, even feeling human emotions, and act nothing like machines. Yet, they're supposed to be machines bent on conquering humans? The male Cylons are portrayed as boring and dull while the female Cylons are either slutty or overly emotional. In this season, the Cylons are shown to be a bunch of goofy religious fanatics and the threat factor is almost completely eliminated.

Overall, I love individual episodes of BSG, but I don't like the larger story or the Cylons. Individual episodes can have great character moments or engage in deep moral questions. However, when character and morals take a backseat, the series flounders. Still, it's definitely must-see television for sci-fi fans.",1356480000,,2837,4.989429175475687

2606944,5,B000GFLEAO,"One of my favorite television series of all time along with 'The Wire'
and 'Breaking Bad'.

Like 'The Wire' this is a complex, Dickensian study of human nature,
not afraid of asking big questions, and meticulously plotted like a
great novel, so that each episode is a chapter in a much larger whole.

Just as 'The Wire' used the overly familiar clich' world of the cop
show to jump off from and shatter our preconceptions, and 'Battlestar
Galactica' uses the sci-fi series, and the idea of human versus robot
wars the same way.

This is thinking person's sci fi, in the tradition of Arthur C. Clarke,
or Isaac Asimov. It's about why we are how we are, what it means to be
a human being, morality under constant pressure in times of war,
fathers and sons, impossible loves, metaphors for modern and recent
politics and real world situations.

My wife, far from a sci-fi fan was hooked after 3 episodes, and we tore
through 5 years of shows in just a few days. It's that addicting.

The acting is all at least quite good, and some cast members are
remarkable, creating characters full of depth, complexity and
contradiction. The writing is terrific, allowing the characters to
change and grow, but always in ways that make sense, creating seemingly
inexplicable conundrums, only to find surprising, sometimes shocking -
but ultimately logical and satisfying - ways to explain where they've
taken us. The special effects are generally very impressive for TV,
even if they're not really why you watch this show.

It also has some of the most tense episodes of television I've ever
seen, and some of the season enders left me completely wrung out and
blown away. I was sad to get to the last episode, just as one is sad to
finish a great book.

For me this was the series really seemed to start finding it's stride,
it's deeper, darker, more complex focus.  To be clear. it's
great from the get-go, but the themes started getting more
complex, heroes and villains more gray, and the series started
demanding more from the viewer.

Also, Amazon UK currently has a complete region free blu-ray box
set for about $100 with shipping.  It seems to have all the same extras
as the US box set.  Well worth considering as long as the price holds up.",1320796800,,2236,4.649746192893401

2606948,1,B000GFLEAO,"The special effects are great and the acting is not bad for the most part. What turned me away were the plot holes and the underlying theme. The theme seems to be, ""No matter how much the leaders screw up, they should remain in power because, well, just because.""

Admiral Cain is a good example of this (straw, camel's back). She did what to keep the Pegasus going? And Adama doesn't mention to Roselyn that maybe they should interview some of the Pegasus crew to see if what was said was true? But, then, Roselynn did leave that little girl on that one ship to die way back at the start of the series because, well, just because.

What's interesting is how they only hint at what Cain has done. And then when she tells her XO not to do what she sent him to Galactica to do, it is at this point that you almost accept her as part of the team. But then you watch Razor, and about halfway through you realize that she should have been pushed out an airlock.

If you don't get what I am saying, or just don't get hung up on such stuff, enjoy the show. It is quite good visually.
But if I had unknown Cylon agents on my ship, I'd go back to Anchorhead and sit there for a few days while they all died (with no hope of resurrection).

2606952,5,B000GFLEAO,"We return to the other half of season two with Admiral Cain on all of our minds.  I'm sure everyone misses the Adama-Roslin command unit.  It just doesn't work right, especially when crews get mixed up between the two ships.  The Pegasus crew is less than inviting.  The Pegasus crew actually tells the Galatica crew that are mixed in with them that they don't belong there and make their lives hell.  They actually come to the point where they're ready to fire on each other.

Season 2.5 deals with a lot of emotional issues from past deaths and deaths that occur during the season.  We lose at least one very well loved character.

We see the return to Caprica when ""Starbuck"" is authorized to go back as a rescue mission and is able to get to Anders.  Caprica isn't the only planet that we see, there's a planet that is habitable, but Roslin and Adama don't see it as a long term option for the fleet.  But with elections coming up, the fleet is not only voting for their new president, but also for their choices.  Roslin is with Adama on trying to push on to find Earth, while Baltar wants to stay and civilize the planet they have found.

In the end, they make a decision.  Baltar.",1250899200,,1187,4.389908256880734
2606953,4,B000GFLEAO,"I'm a latecomer to ""Battlestar Galactica"" and am just now watching it on DVD. Season 2 was split into two sections, with this DVD set containing the final 10 episodes of the 20 episode season plus a bonus episode.  Dubbed Season 2.5, it picks up with the crew of Galactica shocked at the discovery of the Battlestar Pegasus.  However, their initial excitement fades as they start to realize that Admiral Cain (Michelle Forces) is going to be a very tough new commander of the fleet.  As the newly reunited fleet faces their first incursion against the Cylons, loyalties are tested.  The season also considers the fate of President Rosalin as her cancer continues to spread and she seeks re-election as well as life aboard the various ships for the civilian fleet.

Season 2.5 is solid and includes my all-time favorite BSG episode - ""Downloaded,"" in which we get to see more of the Cylon society and learn the fates of Caprica Six and Sharon Valerii.  The season ends with a shocking two-parter that completely shifts the direction of the show.  This ending is a huge risk, but I really admire BSG's willingness to defy expectations and take the show in uncomfortable directions.  I can't wait to see how this situation is resolved in Season 3.  The set also includes an expanded version of the Season 2.0 cliff-hanger (""Pegasus""), which is interesting to watch.

On the other hand, Season 2.5 contains two of the weakest BSG episodes: ""Black Market"" (Lee is tasked with eliminating illegal black market activity) and ""Sacrifice"" (Lee has to intervene in a hostage situation aboard Cloud Nine).  Both episodes play like typical cop shows.  I like Lee, but these kinds of episodes make him into a boring, square-jawed hero.  On the commentaries, producer Ron Moore is refreshingly upfront with his disappointment with these two episodes.

The DVD features audio commentaries for most episodes; these are primarily the podcasts that the producers created for the SyFy Channel website.  In general, these podcasts are very good, although they are more informal and of worse quality sound-wise than what one usually expects on DVD sets.  Likewise, they sometimes let spoilers slip; in particular, do not listen to the commentary for the Pegasus (expanded episode) until after you watch ""Resurrection Ship: Part 2"" as it contains a huge spoiler.",1249776000,,2340,4.992268041237113

2606963,4,B000GFLEAO,"An interesting take on Sci-Fi, is BSG. At it's core are ultra-conservative  values and a fascination with the military. Buddy camaraderie, loyalty, family, military hierarchy, patriotism are endorsed and revered. Abortion is banned. The exiled humans follow their ""scripture"", an unabashedly fundamentalist Biblical plan which turns out to be literally true (!). Having their Scripture, humans can safely eschew mystical experience which is something that the ""Cylons"" have a mono-poly on. Let us also not forget that the plot is based on 12 human colonies trying to find Earth (ie, ""Zion"")!

On the other hand, intellectuals and scientists are demonized (cowardly, crazy and traitorous), as are unions and civil society advocates (power-hungry ex-terrorists) and any mental-emotional sophistication (likely to be manipulation by Cylon enemies). In other words, the show could have been (and perhaps was) written by a Dobson-Cheney surrogate in some military Psy Ops room or another. if so, the creators should get medals for it.

Because the show works. The drama and its protagonists suck me right in every single time. Great writing, directing, excellent acting, great selection of actors which, surprisingly for a 'fundamentalist' show, feature women in key combat roles. That was an excellent call; the Lt. Starbuck character in particular mixes macho posturing and femaleness in a weirdly unique and unflinchingly consistent way. So one roots for Galactica and her crew and is happy and relieved every time they blast their way through Cylon lines.

the director certainly does not spare viewers' sensibilities. The language is raunchy (what the frack!), violence is depicted graphically with no details spared, the creators of the show revel in all kinds of abuse and torture; the graphic nature of confrontations at physical, psychological and cultural levels is imo quite effective. BSG and its cousin Stargate represent polar opposites to the philosophical sophistication and enlightening aspirations of shows such as Star Trek or early Star Wars; they're the Sci-Fi equivalent of redneck pulp that catalyzes people's inherent fear of the ""Other"" rather than teaching them to be better, more 'enlightened', humans. Of what use is personal growth and happiness if there is a terrorist hiding under every rock? Unfortunately this is the kind of pulp i like.

2606966,5,B000GFLEAO,"As I live in New Zealand, we got a full - version Season 2.0 which has the entire Season 2 episodes (both the U.S. 2.0 and U.S. 2.5 combined.) But our full 2.0 version comes without the deleted scenes of 2.5, only those of the U.S 2.0; or the first half of season 2.0 from our perspective, and only the regular, unextended version of the episode ""Pegasus"". So, from the New Zealand fan perspective, Battlestar Galactica 2.5 is really not essential to the casual fan; but is certainly essential to the completist or very dedicated fan who wants all original material. The release is high quality. The acting and storylines of this new Battlestar Galactica (all of its' Seasons, spinoffs and material) is always slick and tense. Early Season 2.0 saw the stabilisation of the power struggle between Commander Adama and President Roslin which began late in Season 1, and the reuniting of the scattered fleet after the shattering impact of the Cylon assasination attempt upon Commander Adama (the Season 1 cliffhanger event) and subsequent allout Cylon attack and boarding of Galactica by the Cylon fleet in the opening episodes. Season 2.5 opens with a strong and united Colonial fleet and Galactica firmly but fairly under the Adama-Roslin rule. All that changes in the opening 10 minutes of the first episode when the Battlestar Pegasus turns up. The three - part opening sees a deadly power - struggle between both Battlestars for the title of Fleet Commander and a magnificent three on two mothership confrontation between Galactica and Pegasus vs two Cylon Baseships and their ominous Resurrection Ship. The assasination of Admiral Kain by the Cylons is all that settles the internal power struggle, clearly cementing Adama as Fleet Commander. After this volatile period, the fleet settles into a comparatively quiet time from external threats, having attained the plateau of relative safety with the destruction of Resurrection, and addition of the fearsome dreadnaught, like a big bully, a second Battlestar - Pegasus to the fleet. You get the feeling that the Cylons are possibly scared to tangle with the Pegasus. The only time they do of their picking, they used a trap; luring the Pegasus away from the relative safety of the fleet and Galactica, three Baseships were involved and they had the element of surprise in the episode ""The Captains' Hand"". The post - Admiral Cain colonial fleet saw Season 2.5 undertake episodes about internal struggles and issues, and an everchanging leadership of Pegasus. Ultimately, Adama Snr appoints his son, Lee Adama (Apollo) who had already made it as high as ""Major"", as Commander of Pegasus. The final phase of the series leads into a third powerstruggle for Season 2 - a presidential election between the encumbant, Laura Roslin, and her Vice - President, Dr. Gaius Baltar. This Baltar wins on a single issue - he promises permanant settlement of the Colonial Fleet on the newly discovered planet of New Caprica. This single event fundamentally alters the shape of the series, setting up for an almost telegraphed ""I told you so"" cliffhanger of Season 2 of the almost inevitable Cylon discovery and full scale invasion of New Caprica. After a brief standoff with the two Battlestars, caught very much unprepared, the Battlestars and small contingent of the ships of the fleet that remained in orbit with them jump away, leaving the vast majority of ships and people helplessly caught on the surface to be humbled under Cylon invasion and control after President Baltar surrenders. These catacalysmic events critically shape early Season 3, which of course begins on the surface of New Caprica with Colnel Tigh in charge of the resistance forces, and Baltar a mere puppet ruler under Cylon control, while Adamas Snr and Jnr prepare to retake New Caprica with the two Battlestars. The consequences of this scenerio unfolding fundamentally changes the whole series post - New Caprica. This is a cliffhanger with far more far - reaching consequences then the Season 1 cliffhanger. This single event is probably the biggest series landmark next to the destruction of the colonies in the Pilot Episode; for both the Humans and Cylons alike. The deleted scenes are actually very worthwhile, containing some cool scenes - unlike most deleted scenes in films and series which are obvious as to why they were cut. The main attraction for a New Zealand or other overseas buyer is the extended version of the episode ""Pegasus"". While this episode sadly doesn't contain any significant new material, this version features subtly extended scenes making a less rushed feel to the interactions in certain parts of the episode. Overall, Battlestar Galactica 2.5 is really not essential to the casual fan in New Zealand, as we have the aforementioned Season 2.0 which covers most of Season 2; but is certainly essential to the completist or very dedicated New Zealand fan who wants all original material. But to any American fan it is a vital part of the series, and both neccessary and worthwhile.

One does have to see the series from its inception to fully appreciate season 2.5-with that said, season 2.5 has all of the action, drama, and compelling interplay that make this show a hit. In these episodes, Galactica encounters another battlestar that survived the cyclon attack. The commander, Admiral Kane and her crew behave in contradistinction to the dignity of the galactica crew; indeed, Kane is characterized as ruthless, rigid, and inflexible regarding the cylons, and her plans for survival of the crew and humanity. Her performance and the characterization of her crew make for riveting television.

2606971,3,B000GFLEAO,"I was knocked out by the original miniseries and by most of season 1.  The first few episodes of season 2 as they finished off most of the story arcs from season 1 were also pretty good.  The rest of season 2 was disappointing.  There were a couple of real clinkers (did anyone like the Cylon filming the documentary episode?) and the series got noticeably darker and the main characters became less appealing.  A realistic approach, I suppose, but, hey guys, this is supposed to be entertainment.  You can't expect viewers to stick with you for five years unless the main characters are more appealing than these folks turned out to be.  But my real gripe with this series is the number of cavernous plot holes.  Here is a list off the top of my head, starting with the most glaring and then a few others:

1.  Why isn't the Pegasus (and its fighters) vulnerable to the Cylon's logic bombs?  The miniseries makes a big deal over Galactica surviving only because its computers were somehow not linked together and because it relied on other antique technology.  Other battlestars and fighters were destroyed in the Cylon attack because they were susceptible to logic bombs.  This idea comes up again in a season 1 episode where the Galactica has to temporarily link its computers and has only about 10 minutes to perform a calculation and jump to another star system before the effects of a logic bomb destroys it.  All of this is forgotten when the Pegasus appears.  The story is that the Pegasus escaped the initial Cylon invasion by jumping before it was destroyed.  Ok, but since then it has apparently been routinely fighting Cylon ships.  Why haven't the Cylons used their logic bombs on the Pegasus?  The producers could have dealt with this by telling us that the Pegasus's computers were configured like the Galatica's (although that would be a little lame because Galatica is supposed to have been unique), but apparently they couldn't be bothered.  Who cares about continuity?

2.  Does Gaius's Cylon detector work or not?  When Gaius comes under pressure from Adama to develop a Cylon detector, he develops one with the help of Number 6, using a nuclear device given to him by Adama.  Apparently it works, because it detects that Sharon is a Cylon.  But then it either stops working or Gaius decides to pretend it doesn't work.  Ok, but then why don't Adama and Laura Roslin pressure him to keep working on it, since everyone believes there are additional undetected Cylon agents in the fleet?  Shouldn't this be a top priority or at least mentioned at some point?  Related point:  If the Cylon detector isn't working and Gaius has abandoned trying to perfect it, why doesn't Adama demand that Gaius return the nuclear device?  Another related point:  How is Gaius able to smuggle the nuclear device to the Number 6 in hiding when we have been told that the fleet has nuclear detectors?

3.  Where does Starbuck get the yellow tape and the time to use it to spell out her name on the underside of the Cylon fighter?  In the episode where Starbuck crashes on a planet and comes on a crashed Cylon fighter, she is shown to be out of oxygen when she finally figures out how to access the oxygen line in the fighter.  But then how does she manage to get under the plane to spell out her name in yellow tape on the underside of the fighter?  Is she supposed to make a large number of trips while holding her breath?  Related point:  We are later told that the Cylon fighters are living things.  Is the one Starbuck finds dead?  If so, how can it fly for her?  If not, why doesn't it fly away?

4.  Why don't the Cylons do a better job of guarding the Arrow of Apollo on Caprica?  It becomes evident that the Cylons are well versed in the holy text describing the Arrow of Apollo and, apparently, believe in the truth of the text.  So, it's hard to believe they don't know what the arrow is, and that they leave it unguarded in a museum for Starbuck to easily find.  Related point:  Is it believable that Starbuck and Helo would spend so much time arguing about what to do about Sharon, rather than getting back in the Cylon fighter and getting the heck out of there?  Another related point:  In the next episode, how do they all get out of the Tomb of Athena?  The door closes on them and they are, apparently, transported to earth - or a vision of earth.  How do they get out of the tomb?  Another related point:  After all the time and trouble to get the directions to earth, why is there so little mention of it - only one or two passing references - in subsequent episodes?  Wouldn't this have been the dominant theme of conversation and shouldn't there be more discussion of how they can use the information from the Tomb of Athena to try to find earth?

5.  How does the Pegasus get supplies in the time before it encounters Galactica?  A big deal is made in early episodes about how pressed Galactica is for supplies and on how dependent it is on supplies from the civilian ships in the fleet.  How then does Pegasus, which has no civilian fleet, get supplied?  In fact, shouldn't there be some discussion of whether the fleet is actually producing food or other supplies?  In an early episode, food is very short; subsequently, that problem is forgotten - or solved in a way that is not explained.

6.  How can language, hairstyles, and so on be so similar to twenty-first century earth?  The show occasionally bows to the idea that the episodes are supposed to be taking place in another time or universe, as with the pyramid game, clipping the corners off of documents, and the use of the word ""frack.""  But how plausible is it that everything else is basically the same as in the current day United States?  I might buy that the soldiers on the Galatica are called ""marines,"" but that they should be nicknamed ""jar heads""?

Ok, I have got a lot more, but I'm probably at (or beyond) the limits of anyone's willingness to read this.",1207008000,2,5949,4.5423728813559325

2606975,5,B000GFLEAO,"(Get both Season 2 boxes if you are in for this.)

The makers of Battlestar Galactica (BSG), who proved they had a big enough brass pair to offer up a challenge to Star Wars and Star Trek, have blasted this series up there with the best of the best. It is fraking mind-blowing television and some of the best SF since Luke Skywalker trusted the force and Spock tried to fix a damaged warp core.

BSG is barely recognizable from the 1970s original series. Such is the scope of the makeover and development of the original storyline that all previous BSG series history has been declared void by the writers and the story has gone through a creative renewal. This reimagining was done to enhance the concept... and the reboot has paid off in aces.

The Cylons were created by man. They evolved. There are many copies. And they have a plan. In the past, there was a war. The Cylons left. Now they are back and they want revenge. They chase and try to kill humans of the twelve colonies across the galaxy.

BSG season 2 continues with the search for the Spear of Athena in the hope that it will point the way back to Earth. The religious elements become central to the story, especially the Cylon resurrection system, which becomes a target for a visually knocking out battle sequence. There are even crossover renegade groups starting to form in each camp. The new arrival of an important addition to the fleet and some of the most thrilling sequences yet seen for a show of any kind. BSG has also adopted more adult themes and has moved away from family viewing to allow for harder action sequences and higher intensity crises.

Season 2 takes place mainly on the deck of the Galatica, but also on Colonial One (the President's cruise ship), the planets Caprica, Kobal and New Caprica. There is lots of powerhouse acting. Commander William Adama (Edward James Olmos) maintains his position as one of the most memorable characters in television history (you can rank him up there with the likes of Captain Picard). Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell) as the President goes through some radical character dilemmas as does Starbuck, a woman in this version of BSG, whose background love relationships are as important as her action-woman persona. Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama (Jamie Bamber) ascends up the ranks and Dr. Gaius Baltar (James Callis) finds himself in an impasse between himself and the Cylons. Number Six (Tricia Helfer) starts a type of revolution. Colonel Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan) relationship with his wife has an impact on his career. Lt. Sharon 'Boomer' Valerii (Grace Park) is a powerful Cylon presence that makes an impact on the storyline. Can the Cylons co-exist with humans? ... Can they hybridize? This is but a small section of the interesting storylines and enormous cast that BSG has to offer... and yes important characters do die, so its edge of your seat stuff through and through.

The CGI is up there the best ILM can put out. One sequence in which an ejected pilot, Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama, observes the resurrection ship battle in the stars maybe one of the greatest SF action sequences of all time that would even make Kubrik's eyes go wide open. The real stars of the show are the screenwriters. It is their boat and they are taking us on what appears to be a voyage unparallel to anything else you have seen before.

BSG Season 2 keeps up the post-9/11 brain candy. The writers sometimes jab at the Bush administration foreign and war policies and then again seem to back them up. In Season 1 it was about the constant search for fossil fuels and battling for control of resources while freedoms get restricted in the fight against terrorism, modelling our own political struggles. In Season 2 its politics coupled with colonization.

The interesting religious confrontation involving polytheism (the human belief system in BSG) and monotheism (the Cylon belief system) has extended and even crosses over. The afterlife, or something like it, begins to emerge.

Season 2 is mostly about finding Earth, the Cyclon resurrection ship, elections, hybridizing and colonization. If you are a fan of SF or just high-quality television, then nothing should be holding you back. BSG could very well be the most important SF TV since Star Trek. It certainly has propelled itself out of this world and is in a dimension all of its own... except when Cylons appear.",1203897600,3,4382,4.785714285714286

2606977,5,B000GFLEAO,"Most people would be slightly weary of the idea of a new and re-invigorated version of the spectacle Science Fiction Drama series Battlestar Galactica (1978-1980) being up to the year in which the series became 'Galactica 1980', which lead to its thoroughly trashed downfall, was a bit of a surprise that a network had decided to re-fashion the show with a more updated and far more interesting story. Many fans would, should insist that this is a re-imagining not an intrinsic remake of a cheesy lovable, and to use a pun for a modern show, ""That 70's Show"". Many of the sci-fi fan-boys, and girls, were in need of a successful sci-fi drama series that had the ability to keep fresh interest and action with drama to top.

The show comes from that concept of a 2003 mini-series, a somewhat thorough and enjoyable close to 3 hr pilot. The principal point, machines are made by man, evolved, rebelled, and a war began.

Sci-fi rubbed off on this show, and it pays to respect it with homage's. With elements from novelist Philip K. Dick from his earlier works of ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" now known as the film adaptation ""Blade Runner"" along with the dark twisted parallel of the humanoid Cylons, and that mirrored `skinjob' reference. It also manages to match the dark allegory of P. K Dick' ""Valis"" a unique exploration of plethora's and universal metaphysics.

The virtuous and glamoured imagery bears the likeness of Kubrick' ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" with cross-cut scenes of Baseships in the sunlight of a nearby star, with a score to match. The score itself is very cinematic, in that it mixes and mingles with the imagery of the show to great exertion; continuously trying new techniques and new ways to give the eye candy. The score feels very dark, operatic and at the same time very tautly tense; it again has mirrored Vangelis' score in ""Blade Runner"" with the deep drum sound to hard hitting acoustics.

Battlestar Galactica is the best character drama that has the real dexterity of raw emotion; the acting shapes plot and vice versa. The characters are flawed and they should be, the situation creates the drama and evidently shapes the characters actions. It perhaps is the only show to bludgeon the scene with taut and well crafted dialogue and sharpest whit, measured writing that current shows like LOST and Heroes could benefit from. The dialogued scenes are spot on quality, the actors all themselves have unique range; perhaps currently the best acting troupe on TV. They have unique ability to play different parts of their personas during the course of a single episode, and still bring a sense of morality, logic and whit to the role; very much unlike a ""space opera"".

The acting troupe has characters including Edward James Almos' brilliant depiction of Commander/Admiral Adama; easily being a favourite. His slightly depressed attitude yet experience make him capable, if not slightly down heartened. His display as a commander of the pride of the fleet does show why he is the best person to have control of a superior vessel. He is quick to think, act and knowing what the cost is with the troubles of his confounded life. Two other characters change form and gender, the two now female, where the Galactica predecessor had two male characters, (when fans should not complain) Katee Sackhoff as Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace, is born into the role of a hard-headed female Viper pilot. As well as the other female candidate played by Grace Park nicknamed 'Boomer'.

One thing this show does well is giving the most unexpected outcome possible, real credit to the writers that show they have a lot of grenades to go certain ways and that their bold spontaneity will either be accepted or judge by audiences. The writers of this show are very clever, in that you might think they plan out the show years in advance a la ""Babylon 5"" or ""Lost"" however you could not be more wrong. The show is written by boldly engaging the big issues currently on TV. You wonder how does a rag-tag fleet survive in the most logical and pragmatic way, scripted to show you that the real evidence of this is present in stories inspired by recent history and current events.

Truth is that many aspects of futuristic life may well be reflected on the current stand stead of today's socio-political and ethical conflict, that's if we decide to create robots that want to kill us. The themes themselves also reflect the big issues: drama, love, personal betrayal, post-9/11 parables, death, rape, murder, greed, religious extremism, depravity and also the antonyms when the situation lightens up (there is humour). In addition, unremittingly keeps putting forth the notion of what is exactly human. It's about genocide, war and the abyss after the precipice.

The special effects are not the only thing that shows high production value, it would put some of the current Trek franchise to shame. Everything is luscious, from the pure spot-on script and unexpected plots to the character actions and the big explosions going on outside.
The imagery splits from sporadic to perpetual, the effects are full of ardour CGI and digital FX, 'in the mind of the pilot/documentary' shot sequences. The new breed of improved and scary Terminator influenced Cylon centurions and human-looking Cylon infiltrators who's brutal degradation towards mankind reflects the worst parts of humanity. Is it pure hate, spite, jealousy or maybe because they have found a god to kill for; sound familiar? Moreover, what you have been waiting for, yes it does have graphic scenes of a sexual nature, but it's not for everyone.

2606984,5,B000GFLEAO,"Battlestar Galactica is the best show on television! As for the second half of the second season - it contains some of the best, but also some of the worst (but the worst is still better than everything else on television).

This set starts off with an extremely strong beginning - these first few episodes, ""Pegasus,"" ""Resurrection Ship Part 1 & Part 2"" are probably Battlestar at it's finest. The Cain story arc will probably be remembered as the epitome of the show's greatness.

While the first few episodes are mind-blowing, the following episodes of the second season aren't as consistently strong as the first 10 were. We get episodes like ""Black Market,"" probably the poorest episode of the series. I didn't hate ""Epiphanies"" as much as most people did, although I thought it was a bit of a cop-out. Still, the good contained within this set far outweigh the ""bad,"" which by normal television standards is still brilliant. The highlights of this set include:

Pegasus: I prefer the version that is included with 2.0, because it is shorter and to the point...but this version has some interesting insights as well.
Resurrection Ship 1 and 2: The epitome of amazing television. This two-parter always leaves me breathless, no matter how many times I re-watch it.
Downloaded: One of the best of the series, an interesting look into the conflict from the eyes of the Cylons, and we come to realize that they are not as unified as we thought.
Lay Down Your Burdens 1 and 2: Doesn't match up to the finale of season 1, or the mid-season finale of 2, but is still very strong. Unlike the other finales, this one is very political, although of course is topped off with excellent drama. The ending will leave you...well it really changes from person to person.

2606992,4,B000GFLEAO,"Season 2.5 belongs in any BSG fan's collection - although you should buy the two-pack with the 2.0 set if you can.

Please note that there are a few spoilers in this review. Also, I have watched none of Season 3 yet, so keep that in mind when I complain about certain things. Disclaimer: The character of Apollo annoys me, so you can bet I'm biased here ;)

The show continues to be excellent, although it is hurt somewhat by some dissatisfying filler episodes and a conclusion that I found to be something of a letdown. That said, the wonderful character development that has become the series' hallmark continues throughout, though I find that there are several missed opportunities to learn more about existing characters. Most obvious is the way the imprisoned Cylon ""Number 8"" Sharon is used. Although she is the focus of several episodes, rarely do the writers take the chance to develop her character as an admitted Cylon. Instead, they focus on brief scenes of hardship or anger, then dismiss her character for large sections of episodes. I'm sure she will have plenty of time in Season 3; I simply think that character development could have been done easily in Season 2.5 in place of some of the filler.

Another missed opportunity is the need for a few new characters, especially among the chains of command of Galactica and Pegasus. It seems odd to see the same four or five people both manning watch stations and participating in raiding parties, investigations, and marathon drinking sessions. It's a shame that one or two other officers aren't introduced as watchstanders - it would have made character interaction more fun (and provided more potential Cylon candidates). Especially disappointing to me is the quick deaths of two Pegasus COs and the subsequent appointment of Apollo as the battlestar's CO. Although I admit I dislike Lee ""Fraternization is best with a 12-paygrade separation"" Adama and hope he turns out to be a Cylon, this seemed like a quick fix for the writers, who apparently didn't feel like developing a new CO of Pegasus (provided they could create one who wasn't a paranoid blowhard).

The season finale, while surprising, was quite disappointing for me - I felt that most of the character development and crucial scenes from the last 20 episodes were flushed down the toilet. Although I am hearing good things about Season 3, the ending of 2.5 didn't leave me nearly as shocked as the jaw-dropping conclusion of Season 1, and thus I do not anticipate Season 3 as much as I did Season 2. This doesn't mean I won't watch every single episode of Season 3, though. ;)

Otherwise, the show is great - there is no lack of screen time for Adama, Roslin, Balthar, Apollo, Starbuck, and even some of the junior Viper pilots, though Chief Tyrol fans may be disappointed at this great character's reduced role. Cylon ""Number 6"" is revealed to be an extremely complex character in the Cylon-centric ""Downloaded,"" especially when she herself starts hearing voices. Even some political posturing wasn't as bad as I had feared it would be: Admiral Adama casually notes that abortion, as much as the President supports it, could result in a slow death of the human race.

Most importantly, BSG 2.5 still lets the viewer decide on the morality of many issues as opposed to lecturing them - it is very similar to ""Patton"" in that way, a movie that simply portrayed events and left the righteous agonizing up to the audience (Certainly ""Patton"" must be a favorite of the writers - Roslin and Zarek quoted a scene word for word in Season 1). There is certainly no lack of heart-wrenching moral agonizing in BSG, and I love the show for it.

If you're new to BSG and are planning to watch Season 1 soon, you had best buy all three box sets at once. If you do it piecemeal, the wait between seasons will drive you nuts!

Overall: A few minor faults, but still a must-buy.",1185840000,4,3890,4.735598227474151
2606993,4,B000GFLEAO,"Elsewhere on amazon I have extended high praise for BATTLSTAR GALACTICA seasons 1 and 2.0; I still think by the second part of the second season the show remained quite intelligent, but it also had clear signs of losing its way a bit. The season opener, the two-part ""Resurrection Ship,"" is one of the high points of the series, allowing much breathing room for Michelle Forbes (who gets the best guest starring role of the season as a Col. Kurtz-like admiral) and the most gorgeous special effect of the season, a huge space battle observed by a marooned Apollo from a great distance. The season-ender, ""Lay Down Your Burdens,""  is equally fine, and undergoes what is for TV a very risky move by showing what happens if the fleet settles on a planet for a full year free from Cylon attack.

But in-between these high points the middle sags--you can tell everyone's been in space too long. There are stand-alone episodes that are pretty weak, and which always seem to waste perfectly good guest stars like Dana Delaney. Even worse, throughout the year the series writers seem to have run out of complex ethical problems for the characters to face and begin really reaching by going for things like state-supported assassinations, state-supported election-rigging, child-selling... it begins to seem a bit much. You can tell the writers really want to get that fleet to New Caprica to work out a new narrative model. There's still excellent acting work from the main cast, particularly Katee Sackhoff who gets a real workout for her character ""Starbuck"" in the one really fine stand-alone episode, ""Scar.""

This set seems to have cut down a bit on some of the nicer amenties of the previous BG season sets: there are no menus for episode scenes nor for episode summaries. Most bizarre of all, the commentaries are done by podcasts that have been done in the house of the series developer Ronald D. Moore, and you often find his comments overwhelmed by the sounds of dogs  barking, garbage trucks compacting, and vacuum cleaners running. Apparently when these podcasts were originally aired series fans e-mailed in to complain about the excess ambient noise, and he actually whines about these complaints on subsequent podcasts. The whole effect is pretty shoddy, and works against the beautiful attention to detail elsewhere.",1185148800,,2324,4.9512820512820515
2606994,5,B000GFLEAO,"Galactica is without doubt one of the best TV shows ever produced. it is a deeply moving experience on so many levels - spirtual, emotional and so forth. it delves into the very nature of what it is to BE and the nature of existence itself. I always feel that Sci-fi is the wrong category to put Galactica in as it is not some silly tosh where peoeple run around in romper suits with plastic guns and (obviously) prosthetic 'aliens'.

2606995,4,B000GFLEAO,"I don't even watch or care for television drama (the Sopranos is the only other drama I've followed in the past 10+ years), but I love ""Battlestar Galactica.""

After the Cylons (robots) wipe out almost all of humanity in a sneak attack, the ""Battlestar Galactica"" is the last remaining human warship and leads the few survivors on a search for the mythical Earth. The television show focuses on the President of the Colonies and the military leaders aboard the Galactica. The show has a gritty, realistic, military feel, but despite this, the show is much more than an action/military show: it expertly blends politics, morality, philososphy, and religion into its many plots and focuses on the many characters as they cope with the travails of humanity facing extinction.

Although still fantastic, Season 2.5 was not quite as stellar as the first season or season 2.0.  Although many of the plotlines progressed well, some of the episodes were too predictable, and the writers wrote themselves out of some interesting and tough situations with some radical actions.  Still, this season ended with a big twist, and I cannot wait for Season 3 to be released on DVD.  This is still the best television series around.",1184198400,,1215,4.9655172413793105
2606996,4,B000GFLEAO,"Not as good as the first season but still pretty smokin. My major complaints are that the show gets way too dark, to the point of being down right bleak. More humor is required to lighten things up a bit.

Also the show exposes its political colors on several issues like abortion, euthanasia, etc. No matter what one believes a good show will show both sides how the world naturally manifests theses and not make one side seem cardboard like by using these issues to make its own political point. The show then moves away from entertainment and into the realm of propaganda. This show has so much potential and it was disheartening to see this element come out so strongly, at least in several of the episodes.

Fortunately there were other episodes and elements to the show that had great worth, hence the still relatively high rating. The strongest aspects to the show are its acting, special effects, an interesting plot twists. Though if they kill off any more of humanity there won't be much more death they can deal. I think the show needs to use death more sparingly but still I liked this season very much overall.",1183680000,,1123,4.61

BSG is best when it gets epic, so I tend to find the two-parter episodes to be the best. Early in 2.5 there are the ""Resurrection"" episodes and the season ends with the ""Lay Down Your Burdens"" episodes--both examples of Battlestar at its best.

Everything that has made this series great--character and conflict first come to mind--is here, but the mystery surrounding the Cylons' motives deepens.

Most TV is not that good. But Battlestar has managed at least two excellent seasons. I can't wait for Season Three to come out on DVD.",1179619200,,708,4.603174603174603

Performance of Katee Sackoff, excellent and very difficult in my opinion.

It passes the original series in all these aspects but the original is safer for people of all ages to watch and enjoy. I am a father of a 14 year old who loves the original ( I was 14 when the original aired) and started to watch the new series with me.at first I thought the inuendo,s would ease up as well as the continuose exposure of illecet sex. For the most part I was wrong, it still continues and for that reason I don't let my kid watch it. It seems as though the average age of the writers is 15-18 years old, who are living out their wet dreams through this show. This would be a far better show if the writers and studio would be more aware of the kind of messages they are putting out to viewers( especially ones who are going through difficult part of life of going from child to adult). Be more responsible in the writing and content of this show. I would like to sit down with my kid and watch it without the awkwardness that seems to be so mainstream in todays society and media. For these reasons I give the show a 4 star due to the irresponsibility of the writers and studio. I know, you are saying, if you don't like it turn the channel. My point is if you clean it up, the popularity would increase not decrease.",1177891200,2,1363,4.166666666666667

If you liked Season one, all the same great stuff is still here - great acting, excellent writing, excellent dialogue.  In fact, this season does an even better job (mainly this is at the end of 2.0 and start of 2.5) of impressive story developments.  Season two brings us information on an entirely new type of Cylon ship (with a mysterious and important purpose), the revealing of more of the different human-cylon models (and thus the revealing of more traitors), and also huge developments with Guyas Baltar.  And most of all, 2.5 ends by setting up a whole new world of Battlestar for Season 3.  The only con is that Sci-Fi decided to break this into two DVD sets (which is fine if you're charging half the price!).  Otherwise, this is compelling television.  Definitely a must-see for sci-fi fans.

The special effects and battle scenes are fantastic.....and the acting and story line aren't too shaby either!  The only ""ding"" against the show per se is that the DVDs for season 2 were marketed in 2 parts and that's just silly.

2607011,5,B000GFLEAO,"The Good:

* Battlestar Galactica. This series is one of the best, most original offerings that television has produced. It is thought-provoking, briliantly acted, slickly produced and powerfully emotional. Other than gushing on and on (and without wanting to spoil too much), I can only say to the prospective viewer: watch this series. Start with the pilot movie of Season 1, not here, but get here; watch this series.

* Edward James Olmos. The man deserves special recognition for his role in this series. The acting, on a whole, is top-notch, here... but Olmos' Adama? Legendary.

* The Season Arcs. This season starts of really strongly, resolving the split command issue that 2.0 ended on. Then, it gears itself towards a thrilling Season Finale involving the inevitable split between Roslin and Baltar. Incidentally, the Season Finale is one of the bravest, riskiest things I've ever seen a television show do. I'm very interested to see how they pull things off in Season 3. This is a series that knows what drama is, and how to achieve it, and it always makes sure to enter and exit on high notes. And, speaking of Baltar...

* Dr. Gaius Baltar. What a complex character. Battlestar Galactica is a show that delights to play in the grey, rather than the black or white (you'd think, at least, that the race of living machines determined to extinguish the human race would be Evil... right? But even that is more complex in BSG). Baltar exemplifies the grey. He's a man who, for all of his intellect, never quite knows what he's doing. Like many of us, he's moved both by his better and his worser feelings, without really ever knowing where they will wind up taking him. His guilt and paranoia are ever-present, and his sanity is questionable. And yet, at times, he does try to do ""what's right."" It is heart-breaking when, at the end of this season, he does not stoop to question the morals of his political opponent (despite the fact that he actually has been betrayed).

The Bad:

* The Middle Patch. If I must come up with something ""bad,"" in order to fulfill my gimmick, I'll say that while the show enters and exits on high notes, this half-season looses just a tiniest amount of steam in the middle stretch of episodes. There were a few times when I thought that the show was sort of biding its time, waiting for the larger issues to mature (such as the pregnancy). Also, some of the ""filler material"" (such as the on-again/off-again ""romance"" between Starbuck and Apollo) felt a little rehashed and half-hearted. But really, I'm being a little picky, here. Overall, even the weaker episodes of BSG are still quite good compared to the majority of television.

The Ugly:

* 2.0/2.5...? Releasing half a season is an awful idea. I hope that the studio has suffered enough negative feedback (and not made so much money on it) that they go back to form and release a whole season 3.

* Waiting. It's horrible, having to wait so long to resolve the cliffhangers that this series creates. Having to wait so long before spending more time in the company of these wonderful characters.

Overall:

* Five stars, without question. There is nothing either so bad or so ugly about this series that can really take away from its amazing strengths: intelligent writing, wonderful acting, involving storylines, excellent production values, etc., etc., etc. One of the greatest television shows, all time.",1174176000,7,3407,4.787052810902896
2607012,5,B000GFLEAO,"I have been a fan of science fiction ever since I begged my mother to let me stay up past my bedtime to watch the original airings of Star Trek as a youngster.  I loved the original Battlestar Galactica series in the 1980s but this series, while playing off the original premise, is possibly the best Sci-Fi program I have ever watched.  Character driven and well plotted it is turning someone who watches commercial television rarely into a couch potato!  I can't wait (since I don't have cable) for Season 3 to become available on DVD.",1174089600,,537,4.572916666666667
2607013,5,B000GFLEAO,"I just recently discovered this show and been watching it from the beginning, starting with the 3 hour mini-series and the first season.

I was made aware of this show by continuesly reading about it in TV Guide...i kept thinking ""how annoying is this show""? Oh heck, i broke down and ordered it on Netflix just to check it out so i can say i gave it a try. Then....i fell hard for the show and it's characters.

I can't gush enough about it...i am undoubtedly annoying all my friends and family. Now my sister is starting to watch it, too.

All i can say is BRAVO....for the action, the effects,the storylines, but most importantly, the superb acting.

The commander is my favorite. He just steals every scene he's in, even if he doesn't speak a word! What would the show be without him? He centers everybody. Starbuck is one tough chick but underneath it all she has a tender heart and Apollo is just hot. They would make a great couple. Hehehe. Another thing i really like about the show is that the female characters are so strong. They aren't just there to dress up the scenery.

The girl that plays Cylon Sharon is a great character and i really feel for her even though she's suposed to be a machine. I don't want to close this review without mentioning the doctor character. How original is this guy? Incredible. And i really like the whole thing with him and the invisible sexy Cylon. Never a dull moment.",1173571200,,1414,4.465116279069767

2607015,5,B000GFLEAO,"Since cable is a waste of money, I wait for the DVD to come out. I'd heard BSG was good, but it has now exceeded every TV science fiction I have ever seen.

I read ""hard"" science fiction and prefer that it be as real as possible. That is, no magic. Things that happen have rational explanations within the limits of what we currently know as science.

BSG is a play. We have to suspend disbelief to watch a play more than we do when reading, since there is less room in a play (even on TV) for us to insert our own imagination than there is when reading. BSG is taking elements we all recognize from carrier warfare in WW II and building a scenario on that premise. We have been trained by nearly seven decades of movies to accept the activities in carrier warfare. Thn, using this accepted frame of reference, they are putting really good human-based stories into that premise. This requires top flight writing.

Good TV science fiction, to a greater extent than most shows, requires really good writing and an excellent cast doing the acting to be successful. BSG has this, and as Season 2.5 demonstrates, they are getting better as they go along.

Definitely worth watching.",1173398400,2,1177,4.537735849056604
2607016,5,B000GFLEAO,"This show is the best.  I really don't need to say more but I will.  This is by far the best show on TV right now and this DVD set is a credit to the series.  I will admit that some of the episodes of series 2.5 are a little lackluster and strained the overall product more than make up for a few less than stellar episodes.  Extras like the commentaries, extended Pegasus cut, Deleted scenes, and the R&D skits make this DVD buy worth every penny.  This is not a rent, it is most definitely a buy, keep, cherish and witch over and over and over and over.  OK maybe that's a little over the top but it is worth dropping a few bucks to get it.",1173398400,,642,3.9765625
2607017,5,B000GFLEAO,Absolutely one of the best Sci Fi series in years.  It's rare to find a sci fi series where the acting and direction is so good.,1173312000,,128,3.923076923076923
2607018,4,B000GFLEAO,"""Battlestar Galactica"" is the best show on television.  It's won a prestigous Peabody Award, and has been named by the American Film Institute as one of the top ten shows on television two years in a row.  The acting is superb, the directing outstanding, the editing inventive, the musical composition jaw-dropping, the art direction the best since ""Alien"" in 1979.

Season 2.5 contains some of the best writing and acting the show produced.  ""Resurrection Ship, Part 1 and 2"" contains some of the best acting ever done for the series.  The crisp, detailed characterizations of ""Epiphanies"" not only move the viewer but advance the story in ways which still reverberate through the show a year later.  ""Scar"" remains a major characterization advancement, ""Downloaded"" flipped the show on its head, and ""Sacrifice"" contained one of the two best guest-starring roles (for Dana Delany) on television that year.

The extras, however, are very thin and poorly done.  Ron Moore's podcasts are free to anyone who wants to download them on the Sci Fi Channel's Web site.  Worse, the podcasts contain bad sound, and contribute almost nothing to our understanding of the show.  Disc One, for example, contains only one commentary (to the extended version of ""Pegasus""). That commentary also reveals almost nothing. In fact, the commentators are so poorly prepared for their commentary that they don't know actors' names and cannot recall details they themselves admit are important.  There are long stretches of the commentary where there is nothing but silence.  I felt like I was listening to two fratboys sit around and giggle about their show, telling everyone how ""great"" it is and how ""great"" every actor is and how ""great"" the music is rather than an attempt to convey new information, educate the viewer about the creative process, provide insight into the production or make sense of the episode in the larger themes and direction of the series.",1171756800,,1944,5.078616352201258

I now own all the DVDs and am anxiously awaiting Season 3. This series rocks! Excellent acting, great special effects - it seems real and believeable. Character development and human drama are well done. The Cylons make perfect villans - are they heartless machines or sentient beings who have evolved above man? Edward Almos as Commander/Admiral Addama and Mary McDonnel as the Colonial President are awesome actors. They make this show.  Season 2.5 has some excellent action and drama. Adding the Pegasus to the fleet was a great idea. And Starbuck is starting to mature as a character and actor. Get me a viper and I'll join the fleet!",1171584000,,921,4.6503067484662575

2607021,5,B000GFLEAO,"I still like this series a lot. One thing I noticed on the show is how much they drink. I think if this were originally made in the U.S., various ""interest groups"" and ""boards"" would have put pressure on them to limit the drinking by the characters. I like the fact that the characters are total booze-hounds, because I think this is probably what would happen to people locked in a metal box, being chased across the galaxies by robot killing machines, and who have to worry about dying every day. The XO of the ""Gallactica"" is a total 'lush', and is entrusted with a multi-trillion dollar intergalactic battleship. OK...

Another thing I noticed is, in the future, women and men have the same mechanical/spacial/combat abilities. For instance, the best fighter (Viper) pilots are some women. I am ok with that, but I just would like to note it here. Actually, this entire series is kind of progressive from the point of view of showing women in high positions of power, and in combat, at least as strong as the men. There seems to be no divisions on ""Gallactica"" along racial, gender, or religious lines. Which is good.

2607025,4,B000GFLEAO,"Another split-season for BSG.  In this tail-end of season two, the story of the rag-tag fleet that comprises humanity edges ever closer thematically to 9/11 and the war in Iraq.  The last half of the season climaxed with the reunion with BS Pegasus and the legendary Commander Cain.  It's now revealed that Cain (excellent Michelle Forbes) is a brutal autocrat, and has molded her crew in her own image.  Commander Adama and President Roselin - reluctant allies until now - must solidify their position against Cain when it proves that she's very much a wolf in shepherd's clothing.  Meanwhile, Baltar's connection to the Cylons grows stronger - ironically when he discovers Cain to be holding a Cylon, another ""Six"" that has been brutalized on Cain's orders. Emboldened and yet beholden to the Cylons, Baltar will make his political move against Laura.  We also get more Cylon perspectives when joining Six and D'anna (Lucy Lawless) as they tour the ruined world of Caprica.  (The series actually inverts the Iraq parable in the next season with human beings running an insurgency while under the occupation of Cylons - apparently, we've become the Cylons, only when tragedy strikes, instead of changing the channel, the Cylons merely download to a new body.)  In between that, we have many stand-alone episodes - Starbuck competes against her fierce rival Kat as the two hunt an implacable Cylon; Apollo must deal with the growing criminal rot infecting the fleet; there's a do-or-die battle to destroy the Cylon's ""resurrection ship""; Dean Stockwell appears as another Cylon - he essays his Cylon as a very human amalgam, part statesmen, part businessman, part religious visionary.

This is a must-have unmissable set.  Despite carping about a season's price tag for half a season's worth of shows, I was consistently surprised at how much of the series was advanced in this season alone.  That isn't to say that it's been a perfect ride - we may just have been shown too much of the Cylons who at times prove boring, confusing or stupid instead of effectively manipulative as they were at the outset.  Too much of the plot revolves around multiple incarnations of the same Cylon.  That said, fans who reveled in last season's mix of gritty character development and top-notch effects won't be disappointed with this box.",1170201600,2,2324,4.989637305699482

I'm thinking of ditching all recorders and buying various tv shows on itunes so i can watch them on the Apple TV after I buy my HDTV.  This might be the best option for me.  If you love this idea, go to [...] and check out the Apple TV, which is coming out in the Spring.....

Long live the Colonies!!! :D

The pricing is like certain HBO series.  Few episodes for many dollars.  But hey, they know we are over a barrel and will pay.  Not like you can do without having a copy.  If you have not saw this series then start with season 1..  You will probably enjoy 2.5 more.",1169769600,,437,4.2439024390243905
2607029,5,B000GFLEAO,"Battlestar Galactica continues to be the best sci-fi television show on today.  This set of the second half of season two continues to break new ground and show that the ""reimagined"" Galactica surpasses the original in almost every way.  Those fans of the 70's version of this show should really give this show a try.  Although it may take a few episodes to get used to the changes I really think they will see that this is a totally different show and a great drama.  Right up to the fantastic two-part finale this show leaves you hungry for season 3.  If you like Sci-Fi you will love Battlestar Galactica.",1169337600,,608,4.541284403669724

You couldn't ask for a better cast, better scripts or a better storyline.  This show is one of the best on TV.",1168992000,,278,4.5
2607033,5,B000GFLEAO,My husband and I have been hooked on Battlestar Galactica since day 1 and season 2.5 does not dissapoint.  It has its high and low points- like most series- but wait till the end... it will knock you over.,1168560000,,205,4.256410256410256
2607034,5,B000GFLEAO,I am so glad that SciFi got this series instead of Fox (as Fox has killed a few other very promising series in favor of generic garbage). The story and character development is amazing. I'm not sure of any other series I've seen that has been anywhere near as compelling as this one has. We watch every episode on the edge of our seats and really caring about the characters.,1168473600,,375,4.371428571428571

2607037,5,B000GFLEAO,"This was a great season, although it came out way to late.  If they wanted to sell more DVD's they should have released it as soon as the season finished airing.  As with every season of the new battlestar the season ends on a cliff hanger.  A lot of characters really get developed in this set of shows.",1168473600,,304,4.206896551724138

2607046,4,B000GFLEAO,"If you've got Battlestar Galactica Season 2.0, 2.5 is a must buy, and Amazon's the place to do it.  Battlestar Galactica Season 2.0 was strong and Season 2.6 is maybe even stronger.

Season 2.5 picks up from the knife edge finale to Season 2.0 with the last two Battlestars which are supposed to protect what's left of the Human race about to go to war with each other.

Throughout 2.5 the human race has to battle not only the Cylons, which includes two of the best epic space-battles available on DVD, but also dangers from within. Dangers from the Cylons hiding on board the fleet, their sympathisers and people who think the fleet has gone soft on the Cylons, to some interpersonal trials and internal demons that keep the characters developing.

This Series has both action and depth of character that makes it more watchable and re-watchable than most TV Sci-Fi shows.

There are no weak episodes in 2.5. Each episode has well crafted multifaceted story lines that add to the episodes and the series main themes, building to a climatic finale that will leave you like me, hungry for Season 3.",1168387200,,1098,4.697916666666667
2607047,4,B000GFLEAO,"A lot of people gripe about the price of this boxed set because it only covers half of the BSG season, but if you really enjoy the show, and compare it to shows such as Star Trek The Next Generation, and 24... you really are not paying that much more for a quality show.

This is the BEST Scifi series I have ever watched.  The special effects, the acting, the casting, and the story lines are well concieved, and executed.  I will not complain about the half season set, or the price when I stop and consider the fact that I will be watching this show over and over again.

Don't let the price keep you from making the purchase.",1168300800,,629,4.216666666666667

2607049,5,B000GFLEAO,"This series is everything that Science Fiction should be.  Big, bold, and complex.  It treats the viewer with respect of free thought.  There is no clear cut right a wrong and everything has more than one point of view.",1168300800,,219,4.564102564102564
2607050,5,B000GFLEAO,If you love Battlestar Galactica but live in a country like New Zealand that has only ever aired the mini-series and season 1 then you rush out to buy the dvd's as soon as they become available.  I personally would like to see more deleted scenes in the box sets but overall a very enjoyable collection.  The series does go a little darker from season 2.5 onwards but this coupled with the character development is what draws me as a woman into the series.  Even if you are not a sci fi fan but enjoy a good drama then do watch this awesome show.,1168300800,,546,4.230769230769231
2607051,5,B000GFLEAO,"with Starbuck, the creators of the show have masterfully redefined the masculine women as ""strong feminine"".  The brilliance of the show spreads all across the board...but most interesting to me is the interaction of the strong and fragile Starbuck with the pretty-handsome Captain Apollo.  Apollo's leadership skills are admirable and his convictions fierce.  And the genius of the writing beautifully captures his pining for Starbucks' affection and his romantic nature as a subtle compliment to his masculine energy.  If you watch all the episodes and observe their story from beginning,  you'll notice that writers are ahead of the times and will appreciate how cleverly they address current gender-flipping issues.  The whole show is just... hot!",1168300800,,751,5.48695652173913
2607052,5,B000GFLEAO,"The new episodes included are packaged with tons of action and I think the rythm of the stories are faster and better written, although it isn't fair for me to wait for the new season 3 cause the last episode... what can I say! you really wanna know whats gonna happen next!

It's one thing to TiVo the programs, but another to just hand the friend or acquaintance the DVD as if it were a relic and say, ""You must watch this.""  This is a must-see for anyone who appreciates in-depth characterizations, not just sci-fi addicts.  The plot creates a world true within itself, regardless of how many times scientific laws are broken.",1168300800,,456,4.469879518072289
2607055,4,B000GFLEAO,"IMO, IT WAS ABOUT FREAKING TIME we got our promised extended cut version of the episode 2.10, ""Pegasus"".

We were promised it would air live, then told it would be in the 2.0 DVD set and then we finally got it here in the 2.5 set. Season 2.5 was relativly good, and Amazon managed to have it to me within two days of it being released. However, they still haven't gotten a good thing going extras wise, since they still have not included the gag reels, we can only hope that they learn, because just the podcasts and a couple of interviews as extras just aren't good enough.

FOLKS: 2.5 wasn't the best BSG we've gotten, it had a few bad points that even TPTB behind the scenes said they didn't like much, but it set us up for a heck of a season 3!",1168214400,,748,4.151724137931034
2607056,4,B000GFLEAO,"This series is great, but to split season 2 into to parts (2.0 and 2.5) is both annoying and greedy on the part of Universal.  I actually waited and researched for a long time before I bought 2.0 & 2.5 (hoping that a complete season 2 DVD set would become available, but no dice).  Atleast they included the season 2.0 Pegasus cliff hanger on this DVD set too...  I hope season 3 (when it is available) does not go down the same path.",1168128000,,434,4.204819277108434
2607057,5,B000GFLEAO,"I was very happy to discover that the second half of season 2 was as good as the first half.  I don't have much to add that is unique compared to what other people have said, but I wish that the Pegasus longer version was the ONLY version released.  With the first half of season 2, you get the broadcast version, and with the second half you get the ""better"" (longer) version.  I'm just not a big fan of redundancy.",1168041600,,416,4.175
2607058,5,B000GFLEAO,"Im not much a ""sci-fi"" person, but I have to admit that Battlestar Galactica is wonderful! Great story, great acting, and great special effects. I recommend this DVD, as well as the others in this series, to anyone....enjoy!",1168041600,,224,4.921052631578948

2607061,4,B000GFLEAO,"Excellent series with a first class story line, characters of substance and very effective use of special effects.

Also, nice to see a series that doesn't rely on special effects to carry the story. Looking forward with anticipation to the next series.",1167955200,,412,4.9
2607062,5,B000GFLEAO,"I think that Battlestar Galactica seasons one, two and now three (currently

2607087,3,B000GFLEAO,"Unfortunately, 2.5 marked the end of an awsome series.  Still worth watching for any fan, but doomed to disappoint.  The writers hit a wall; relying on formulaic convention from the first season and a half instead of creating new.

  They let some of the best relationships/interactions just disappear, jumping forward in time arbitrarily and ignoring fertile plot lines.  Even the believability faulters.  By the end, I was left with the feeling of disappointment from potential unrealized, even discarded.",1167955200,2,507,5.423076923076923

Although many grumbled at the decision to sell season 2 in two halfs, I actually appreciated it.  I rarely have the chance to watch the show week-to-week, and was more than happy to buy two sets at six-month intervals than wait an entire year to get my next ""B.G."" fix.  If you haven't seen the new series and are a fan of the old (like me) you owe it to yourself to put aside the ""Starbuck as a girl"" critisicms and at least watch the pilot mini-series.

I am enjoying this series, but the wait is tedious.  I'm not sure why the producers wait until the next year is almost ready to premier before making the last year available.  In my part of the country, this series doesn't air on the Sci-Fi Channel until 10 pm or 11pm, which is inconvenient to my schedule (I start work at 5am).  Having the DVDs makes it convenient for me and I can watch without the commerical interruptions.  I've gotten some of my friends interested in this series by lending them my DVDs and now they've become fans.

This said, ""Battlestar Galactica"", available only on the Sci-Fi Channel (cable) is more than worth seeing; it is mandatory for anybody who vaguely claims to be interested in science-fiction. So if you're coming to Season 2.5's DVD set, you have good taste and good sense, because I'm sure you already know the show by now.

If you hadn't already bought Season 2.0, what's the matter with you? There was/is an iTunes download, ""Battlestar Galactica: The Story So Far"" that will get you by, but this is a DVD set with a course pre-requisite. The whole series is/must be understood before you can get the full benefit of Season 2.5.  It's all good. No, it's all excellent. I've fallen in love with Bear McCreary's music, which can be listened to (on its own CD) in or out of context to the story, and knowing Season 1 and the intro TV movie as well I would consider essential to understand the characters' evolutions, devolutions and head games.

I was one of the skeptical ones--I hated the 1980's show because it devolved into the ridiculous, but I also wasn't sure I wanted to see the darker twist to this.  I'm glad I was pleasantly surprised.  All of season 2 resonates with what is happening in our ""world"" and our military; yet, the writers imbued each episode with something we could relate to without hitting us over the head with it.  The characters are complex, as human beings are; they have frailties and faults, as human beings do; but they have occasions where they rise above it all, as human beings do.  And, hey, the men are definitely not bad to look at.  (Okay, I had to put in something gratuitous after being soooo serious.)",1167868800,,765,4.507246376811594

2607161,5,B000GFLEAO,"Battlestar Galactica just continues to grow, change and evolve. The depths of its characters and mind-blowing special effects always seem to propel the story forward in directions that you never see coming. What makes this even more intriguing is that they've taken elements from the campy original series, granted wonderful at its time, and shook them to the core, discovered what was important about those elements and integrated them into a near flawless story arc.

2.5 follows the Galactica through its discovery of another Battlestar Pegasus and follows the intrigues, as politics and personal agendas threaten to tear the fleet apart to the discovery of perhaps, a new home world. All of this while the Cylons relentlessly pursue their creators, the last vestiges of humanity, for a reason only known to them.

What is so amazing about BG is that they always serve the story first, that this is a human drama set in a Sci-Fi setting and NOT a Sci-fi show trying to lamely disguise what it is, by trying to show occasional depth to two dimensional characters, hoping that flashing lasers and shiny cloths will be enough to distract from the lack true human thoughts, feelings, failings and triumphs.

Do yourself a favor and rent, purchase or borrow Battlestar Galactica from the mini series and go crazy. And, please, please, please if it's your hang up, get over Starbuck being a woman. Believe me, Dirk Benedict was never this much fun.",1167782400,,1445,4.938271604938271

Without giving it away for anyone like me who is buying the DVD sets to catch-up, I'll say that what I love about this half-season in particular is as follows:

First, flawed beaten up humans keep their dignity and morality.  Many of the episodes are morality plays without being preachy or predictible.

Second, I really can't predict where the story is going.  You think it's going one way, and then it goes the other.  And, the story really starts to move fast toward the end.  Where are they going with this?  Well, I'll have to wait for the next set of DVDs.

Third, keeping the Pegasus around a while was a great idea.  It made for some interesting stories that would not have been possible otherwise.

Fourth, I don't remember any painful-to-watch scenes of Dr. Boltar having auto-erotic experiences with the Number Six in his head.  I really hated that in the early episodes.  I'm glad that got toned down.

Fifth, we've got many characters being developed at once.  We even get some development of the beautiful woman who runs the communications on the bridge, something that Star Trek TOS and the original BSG never really got around to.

2607181,3,B000GFLEAO,"This second half of the second Battlestar Galactica season is still a bit on the dark side. The fleet is still running but it is also bedeviled not only by Cylons but also by civilians with radically differing agendas. Having the Cylons be experts at playing mind games does not help matters.

This season picks up a few of the story ideas from the original series, The PEGASUS and Adm. Cain are examples, but takes the basics of the ideas and goes in completely new directions. The Cylons still seem implacable enemies but occasionally there seem to be defectors...or are they merely fifth columnists?

Episode synopses follow:

Pegasus - The Galactica crew gets readings of a large ship approaching and launch a response in their belief that it is a Cylon basestar. Instead, it turns out to be the Battlestar Pegasus commanded by the legendary Adm. Cain. At first all rejoice to learn of this additional surviving (and potent) ship of humanity but things get tense quickly. As an admiral, the new arrival takes precedence over Adama. The admiral is a hard case also, who brooks no arguments and tolerates nothing not to her liking. She believes Adama has been too soft and orders the crews of the two battlestars to be integrated. This leads to friction and worse. The Admiral has her own cylon interrogator and rape is one of the preferred methods. When the crew chief learns of this, he and a lieutenant intervene with deadly results. The resulting summary court martial pushes Adama over the edge and he is willing to use force to get his people back. The episode ends with the fighters of the two ships headed for the opposite ship with blood in the eyes. This was the cliffhanger that ended the previous set. It is presented here with some small additions that do nothing to change or enhance the story line.

Resurrection Ship part 1 - As the last cliffhanger ended, the Pegasus and Galactica had launched vipers at each other in a very tense standoff. As this episode opens, all is confusion as the fighters on each side wait for instructions as to whether they are to attack the opposing Battlestar. When an unknown ship shows up on the screens and is presumed to be Cylon, the differences are temporarily put aside as all go for the intruder. The intruder turns out to be Starbuck who is back with vital intelligence about the mysterious Cylon ship. Upon interrogation of the prisoners, it turns out to be a Resurrection ship, used to recycle the consciousness of Cylons who have been killed. Adama and Cain temporarily put aside their differences to put together a joint strike but neither trusts the other. When Adama learns that Cain killed or abandoned the civilians who were with her, he is even more set against her. As the episode closes, the joint strike is being planned but each is planning to use the victory celebration to bring about the downfall of the other.

Resurrection Ship part 2 - The battle plans are made and each of the human commanders has made arrangements for the assassination of the other commander after the battle with the Cylons. Now it is time for the battle plan to unfold and take the fight to the enemy. The plans against the Cylons go well but the aftermath is not what is expected with the assassination plots. Things get messier when Baltar, the arch-traitor, reverts to type and lets loose a menace.

Epiphanies - The president finally seems to be on her death bed with the cancer ravaging her body. She is distrustful of Baltar and of the Cylon prisoner and orders the foetus she is carrying to be aborted. The Cylon present in Baltar's mind wants to stop this, of course. Meanwhile, there is a growing element within the fleet which wants to negotiate with the Cylons and looks to the military as the enemy. They conduct sabotage and acts of terrorism. As the president is about to die, the phantom Cylon tries to talk Baltar into further betrayals of humanity but, surprisingly, he refuses. He even manages to save the president and the Cylon foetus. He also manages to set humanity up for yet another betrayal.

Black Market - Shortages in the colonial fleet have led to a thriving black market operation. That such a market would evolve is inevitable but the situation is getting out of control. The president and the fleet finally step in when the commander of the Pegasus is murdered over a black market deal and Capt. Apollo is tasked to investigate the matter. In doing so, he endangers a woman he has become close to and learns more about her that he wishes.

Scar - The fleet finds itself desperately in need of strategic minerals in order to manufacture replacements for losses to the Cylons and is fortunate enough to find a system where those minerals can be mined. It means staying put for a while but the following Cylon fleet has been decimated and that gives them a bit of breathing room. There are still some to contend with in the local system, however. One of them is called Scar. He has a reputation for killing Viper pilots. The pilots must confront him, though, in order to protect mining operations. Much of this story is taken up with Starbuck engaged in a clash of wills with another pilot. Each considers herself to be the best and wants to prove it. Starbuck is facing memories of all of those who have been killed before and the up and coming hotshot is overfilled with bravado. Their personalities clash. Meanwhile, Scar is racking up more kills.

Sacrifice - When word gets out to the civilian part of the fleet that there is a Cylon prisoner aboard the Galactica, people are disturbed. One group, seeking vengeance, decides to turn to terror. They take hostages on one of the recreational ships and threaten to kill them all unless the Cylon is turned over to them. The hostages include several notables included Capt. Apollo, the President's aide and the wife of Col. Tigh. Everyone knows that negotiating with terrorists just causes more problems but things seem less clear cut when loved ones are the hostages. It's a mess and friendly fire makes things worse.

The Captain's Hand - The death of Admiral Cain and the Commander of the Pegasus have left a hole in the command structure of that ship. Admiral Adama appoints the senior surviving officer to command but he is an engineer, not a combat leader. He is good with machines but not people. This causes friction and problems that only get worse when two of the Pegasus's raptors go missing. When the new commander goes looking for them, they get bushwhacked. All of this takes place during the midst of a political crisis in which Baltar shows that he is able not only to betray all of humanity but also close associates as well.

Downloaded - This is a confusing episode. It has become time for the Cylon prisoner to deliver her baby. It's a bit premature but the modified aspects apparently make it quite hardy. This poses some ethical problems. What should be done with a newborn which is only half human and whose other half is of a species trying to wipe out humanity? How will the Cylon sympathizer react? How will the Cylon haters react? Is there a danger to the fleet? This little drama takes placed interposed with another taking place back on Cylon held Caprica. Number 6 and Number 8 are both downloaded and inhabiting new bodies. Both seem to be showing some sympathy for humanity. In a reversal that never gets explained, Number 6 has Baltar flashing into her head making snide remarks instead of the other way around. Both are view with suspicion by the other Cylons who have not been contaminated by close contact with humanity especially when they show some sympathy for the human resistance movement.

Lay Down Your Burdens Part 1 - Starbuck finally gets what she has been wanting. A rescue mission is sent to Caprica and she is the leader. It's a daring plan but they are counting on some help from Sharon, the Cylon prisoner. They face many jumps and expect to lose some raptors along the way and they manage to lose one on the very first jump. That divides the story line. Starbuck and her rescue team manage to find the last free humans but are attacked by Cylons before they can get back to their ships. Therein hangs the first story line until the next episode but, just as important, the wayward ship has found a planet. It is habitable, barely, and it is hard to find by virtue of being hidden in a nebula. This has big political implications. Much of the civilian part of the fleet is weary of life aboard ship. They want to be on a planet. Safety does not register in their minds. This gives Baltar's faltering campaign for the presidency a new boost when he comes out in opposition to the president and in support of settling ""New Caprica"".

Lay Down Your Burdens Part 2 - As the last episode ended, Starbuck and her rescue team are in a standoff with Cylons. It is just a matter of time until they are overrun. Miraculously, the Cylons just seem to give up. One of the rescuees declares a miracle and all head back to the fleet. Baltar's position on settlement has boosted his campaign. Now it looks like he might win even though all sane people know that would be a disaster. The situation is so grave that the powers that be even consider trying to steal the election. The bad guy, however, wins and settlement proceeds. Then comes a long blank of almost a year. The people on New Caprica are barely surviving while Baltar lives a life of luxury. The fleet barely has enough people aboard the ships to keep them running. That's when the Cylons show up. The fleet jumps, leaving most of the people behind, and Baltar is left to surrender. So ends the season with a cliffhanger.",1164153600,3,9649,4.622520420070011
2607182,3,B000GFLEAO,"Season 2.5 (God, they have decimals in the seasons now) of Battlestar Galactica is still better than much of what is on TV, but unfortunately the show began a downward spiral in 2.0 that continued in the second half of the season. Like many television shows, this series has begun to suffer from narrative ""selective amnesia"" that allowed the creators to remember what is convenient and dismiss whated they want to ignore -- even if the ignored plot points were crucial to earlier episodes. While this works in many shows, watching these tactics employed in a ""naturalist"" television program - even one that is science-fiction by nature - feels at best cheap and at worst downright unfaithful to its audience.

Additionally, grand episode and season long arcs are resolved unsatisfactorily, seemingly at whim, and characters go through massive transformations that are retconned away within the space of one, maybe two, episodes. And while this was once a show where getting shot by a bullet really hurt -- note that the LEAD of the show was in a coma in Season 2.0 for what felt like forever -- in the back half of the season Lee Adama was shot, wounded badly, and healed again in TWO STRAIGHT episodes. Oy! Naturalism, this ain't. Some may prefer the new slant of the show but I personally find it a little droll, a little smug, and a little been-there-done-that.

Final thoughts: If you're a fan, you'll most likely buy these anyway. If you're not a fan, check out the first season of BG (and NOT the miniseries) to get a handle on what all the fuss is about.",1163980800,7,1562,4.697080291970803

This flows right into a two-parter involving a special Cylon ship.  Tensions mount between the two Battlestars and the President.  In the end we have something far darker than the original series ever was.

Also in this half we learn more about Sharon's semi-Cylon baby, the President's health, the Caprica survivors, and have the presidential election.  All along the way there are very tough decisions to be made and they are handled in the style that has become familiar with this series.  We even get to see some very interesting footage of what has happened to the original Six who's body died on Caprica and the Sharon who shot Adama.

2607216,5,B000GFLEAO,"Battlestar Galactica had a full count of episodes in season 2 but decided to give fans and themselves a break halfway for a couple months. Inexplicably, the season is not in one big set but rather split in half at full price. It's one of those kind of unforgivable things that doesn't derail the season simply because the episodes are so great. While things in the middle section somewhat sag, they're bookended but awesome episodes that should appeal not only to sci-fi fans but drama fans in general.

The previous set ended with Pegasus, where the ship encounters another Battlestar, named the Pegasus. Initially relieved and excited about a 2nd ship, things turn worse thanks to the ship's Commander who is quite strict and deadset in her beliefs, even if it means going against fair judgment. This leads into the 2 parter Resurrection Ship where one of the Cylon ships holds an important secret that can help out the humans considerably if destroyed. At the end of the season we have Downloaded where we follow Galactica's Boomer and Six(the real one who's in love with Gaius)'s rebirth on Caprica and their feelings for their respective men. This follows into the 2 part season finale Lay Down Your Burdens. Starbuck decides to finally rescue her men and his friends from Caprica while the Presidential race heats up and takes a sudden turn when a habitable planet is located by accident. This eventually leads to a shocking finale that ends up changing everything.

A lot of shows when it comes down to season finales don't tend to change anything. They're just really big episodes that gets resolved in the premiere of next season and everything's back to normal. The finale here though ultimately does a heavy number on the crew and fleet. Not to mention the captivating 3 episode punch of Pegasus and both parts of Resurrection Ship. It's the middle section where it sags. It's not that they're terrible episodes(except Black Market which I suggest you avoid) they're just not as completely well-written as others. One episode though stands out. In Scar, Starbuck and one of her former trainees Kat gets into a big rivalry over who will destroy Scar, a Cylon raider who is quite the enemy.

While it is a bit too much for a shortened season, the episodes here are so good that you kind of go ""meh, oh well"" and meh you should since this is a show worth getting into.",1161129600,3,2376,4.734299516908212
2607217,5,B000GFLEAO,"People who have an opinion about BATTLESTAR GALACTICA tend to fall into three camps.  First, there are those who dismiss it because it is Sci-fi and as a result have no interest in it.  After all, those Trekkie types have no real aesthetic judgment and will like just about anything as long as it has spaceships, lasers, robots, and aliens (nevermind that BSG has neither lasers nor aliens).  Second, there is the extremely small but rather fanatical group of fans of the original show (widely referred to as TOS) who are adamant that the new show (or GINO as they love to refer to it--""Galactica in name only"") simply must be a horror because, well, STARBUCK is a guy in the new series!  There is a third and rapidly growing group:  those who consider BATTLESTAR GALACTICA either the best show on TV or at the very least among the best.  Within the latter group there is a not insignificent group who wonder whether it might not be the best show in the history of television.

The most important misunderstanding about BSG is that its appeal is primarily to the Sci-fi crowd.  It is one of those shows that absolutely destroys the limitations of genre.  That it is Sci-fi is almost irrelevant to its intrinsic importance.  Its being Sci-fi bears as little on its value as it does to Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS, Huxley's BRAVE NEW WORLD, or Orwell's 1984.  Imagine taking something like an IQ test.  You are given two columns.  Column One has listed THE SOPRANOS, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, THE SINGING DETECTIVE, BRIDESHEAD REVISITED, AND THE WEST WING (the early seasons anyway) and Column Two is STAR TREK, STARGATE SG-1, ANDROMEDA, and FARSCAPE.  The question is:  In which column is it more appropriate to place BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.  The correct answer is:  Column One, with other shows considered among the greatest achievements in television history.  Sure, it also belongs in Column Two with other Sci-fi series, but we are talking about which is more appropriate.

One of the most astonishing things about BSG has been the way that it has gotten better and better as it has gone along.  The miniseries that started things off was very good, but I wouldn't have described it as great.  Season One quickly entered the realm of greatness, but the first half of Season Two was even better.  And the shows on these discs, making up the second half of Season Two, are yet another step up.  And to show that sometimes you just have to trust the creative powers that be, while many fans were disappointed with the last few minutes of Season Two, with the series suddenly leaping forward a year to find a small human settlement on New Caprica, including many of the central crew members of Galatica.  Instantly some started crying that the show had jumped the shark (one of the least felicitous expressions in discussions of television).  Just as instantly with the start of Season Three, the sceptics have been proven wrong, as an already great show has gone to an even more spectacular level.

Even though this set collects only ten episodes, almost everyone is memorable.  A few are among some of the finest individual episodes I've ever seen of any show.  The three-episode sequence featuring Michelle Forbes as Admiral Helena Cain, commander of the previously missing Pegasus, are especially strong with Forbes doing an amazing job as the heavy-handed and amoral Cain.  The final episode contains one of the most intense and disturbing sequences I've ever seen, as Adama, at Laura Roslin's urging, tells Starbuck to assassinate Cain upon being given a code word, unaware that Cain has similarly instructed one of her security officers to assassinate Adama upon a similar command.  It is a scene of almost unrelieved tension.  I've rarely been so completely on the edge of my seat as when watching that for the first time, as well as horrified by the real politik driving the characters' motives.  The episodes also feature a terrible moment when Sharon is about to be ""questioned"" by some human interrogators who view rape as an appropriate method.  There is also a great Starbuck-oriented episode involving the hunt for an especially gifted Cylon raider named Scar and some great plotlines about the rescue of the remaining humans on Caprica.  The season winds down with a presidential election and controversy surrounding the discovery of a planet capable of sustaining human life.

More than anything--and this is what people who have not seen the series do not understand--this is a character and not a plot driven serial drama.  It does contain surprising and arresting story arcs, but the show is always more about the people who are participants in the drama than about the drama itself.  There has perhaps never been a Sci-fi series in which subtle facial expression has played such a crucial and central role.  The series does contain some amazing action sequences and some of the epic battle scenes can rival or surpass anything we've ever seen in the movies, but nothing can efface the centrality of the individuals--whether human or Cylon--at the heart of the story.

To the distress of many on the political right, the show is also amazingly topical.  Yes, the perspective of the show as a whole is leftist, but there is no propaganda and never, ever an easy answer to political issues.  Many pressing contemporary issues are taken up on the show such as the role of torture in a democracy, the grasping of more power by an executive than allowed in a constitution, abortion, resistance to occupation, the relationship of the military to the civilian in a time of war, and a number of other issues.  But the show never provides answers to any of these questions.  I think the creators would like to do one thing for those on the Right.  The Right in America is astonishingly simplistic in its thinking, frequently couching issues in clear cut, black and white terms.  What I think Ron Moore and David Eick want to do is to complicate things, to show that things really are not black and white but a series of grays on a dark, foggy night.  If there is a political message in BSG, that is it:  things are never as simple as they seem.  The show doesn't want to provide answers, but merely make us suspicious of easy answers.  Season Three has gone on to create a situation that is remarkably similar to the current one in Iraq, with Cylons as the occupying force and humans employing suicide bombers in resistance.

This is the best show on TV.  In both scope and ambition it has tried to do more than any other show I know and it has managed to do so magnificently.  As Matt Roush in TV Guide recently wrote, if you care about quality programming on television, this is the show you should care about.  The critical accolades have continued to barrage the show, with one critic after another proclaiming it the finest show on TV and even getting some amazingly prestigious awards such as its very own Peabody.  If you don't know this show, you need to.  It doesn't matter whether you like Sci-fi or not.  In fact, not knowing Sci-fi might be an advantage.  Sci-fi fans are often burdened by trite and sometimes silly loyalties (""Starbuck is a guy!"" is a prime example).  Those best in a position to love and care about this show are probably those who simply love quality TV regardless of the particular form that takes.  You really need to see this show.",1160870400,12,7370,4.752950432730134

2607219,2,B000GFLEAO,"It seems to me that this show barely qualifies as science fiction. It's a dreary & depressing, slow moving show with no humor (Star Trek had for example, the McCoy-Spock interaction).  It seems a large part of the episodes are  the characters standing around having banal conversations.
The action is a very small part of each episode.

The show has none of the exotic feel that we look for in Sci-Fi. What I always loved about sc-fi was the fantasy ans sense of wonder and amazement it created. This series has none of that. There is a total lack of imagination. The Cylons seems to be no different than humans. There is nothing eerie or scary about them at all. They also look like us, dress like us, talk like us, act like us.  Why bother with Cylons- they may as well be a band of renegade humans? One of the Cylons has a baby- yet the Cylons are referred to as ""mere machines""- but this inconsistency is never explained!

There is no indication that the humans are from a different civilization than ours. They also look like us, dress like us, talk like us, act like us. They even wear neckties!

 Sci-fi fans look foward to exotic alien environments. However, every planet they visit looks like Earth.  The show does not make  even a minimal effort in this regard. Maybe its the lack of a special effects budget. Please, at least when they are on a planet in another galaxy, at least once, show a second moon or a second sun, etc in the sky!

The special effects, in general, are nonexistent- The Battletar Galactica is a piece of junk- they use wired telephones!! Not even cellphones- I understand its an old ship, but please, it looks like something from the 19th century! Why would a ship that can travel at warp speed use wired telephones?!?

 The acting is terrible - the President is a whiny women who always looks like she is on the verge of crying and often speaks in an annoying whisper. James Olmos never changes his facial expression.

There is a reliance on irritating gimmicks- Balter is constantly talking to a women who no one else can see. i find this extremely irritating.  Also, they make no attempt to even explain this.

There is a total lack of background. No explanation as to how the Cylons came to be, why they attacked, what sort of civilization the humans have, their level of technology, their culture, etc.  There were whole episodes about a Presidential election. I can watch The West Wing for politics. I don't need it on a sci-fi show set it another galaxy!  There is a running ridiculous theme about the Cylons and God, but of course, this is never explained.

I would strongly recommend Firefly for those looking for real science fiction.  Its also ""gritty"" but does it with humor, has action, and is much more creative .",1160524800,6,2761,4.541414141414141
2607220,4,B000GFLEAO,"Having watched season 2.5 DVD(also Mini, 1 and 2)as well as listened to the commentary tracks by any measure this is one hell of series and one hell of  ensemble cast, one hell of a writing staff.

Keep in mind compared to earlier 70's Galactica this show aims at an adult mixed audience rather than 12 year old boys. That alone accounts for many of the differences between the two shows.

This is what TV should be. This is why one ""could"" be justified to pay for cable.

Never the less Battlestar Galactica isn't perfect!
It's characters and crews are equally flawed.

Battlestar Galactica in concept is based on an Aircraft Carrier and as such has problems in the Space environment.

  1. Ocean warfare for Surface Combatants is essentially 2D tactics. Even Submarines and aircraft are tied to the surface plane. In space no such  reference exists so all Combatants must use 3D tactics essentially all movement/attack directions are possible. ""Galactica uses 2D tactics don't wonder they lost the war""!

  2. To follow the Aircraft Carrier analogy. A carrier requires ""mission specific escorts"". Galactica on the other hand, other than her own ""Vipers""  has ""no"" screening protection. In short because of the value of the target the  civilian vessels are escorting the(high Value)Battlestars and the ""Presidential One"" not the other way around. In turn the Battlestars Vipers provide protective cover(CAP)for the entire fleet.

  3. Weapon systems: For some reason ""Vipers"" use cannons not missiles or  laser type weapons. While this was great in WW2, high speed aircraft and spacecraft tend to be shot down by overtaking thier own projectiles. And then there is the uses of ""small arms"" in pressurized spacecraft. Not a good idea. And whats the need for the marines in full ""battle gear"" (flack jackets, etc)while on guard duty on board ship.

  4. Nuclear Weapons tend to cause problems with electronics. EMP would likly ""disable"" all but the most ""hardened"" warship systems. This is to say nothing about radiation effects.

  5.  What is the problem with ""Networked Computers"" again? A closed system such as a ship's network needs an input device ""COM LINK"" (i.e. IO port or modem). The ships computers can withstand nuclear attack ""EMP"" but can be knocked out by a WiFi hotspot! ""Come on""!

  6.  Miracle Cures and Trek Science lessons. Over the 2 seasons I have noted the producers both disdain Star Trek yet in 2.5 recently they have used ""fussy science"" to write their way out plot dead ends.

  7. Tease Factor, while to be expected on network TV, Battlestar Galactica is a cable show, enough with the Backlighting and Cropping.

  8. After three years I would like to see a little more Character and plot development outside the the ""Battlestars"" and ""Presidential One"". To date only the the ""excellent"" Richard Hatch has given the viewers a alternative viewpoints to the Military and Political intrigues. Yes I did see the Brothels in the ""Black Market"".

  9. I am some what concerned about the almost callus disregard many of the Military Characters have for ""CIVILIAN"" Authority. While this has improved in BSG 2.5. in the case of Adama. Both senior officers Adama and Cain are poor leadership examples in this area. In both cases ""Junior officers"" moved to protect the ""CIVILIAN"" Authority. On the other hand
Mary McDonnell as President Laura Roslin and James Callis as Dr. Gaius Baltar haven't been ideal democratic leaders either.

10. I guess the ""biggest"" area that Galactica needs to work on is the total lack of a ""fraternization policy"" at first it could be forgiven considering the ""dire state"" of affairs but as the series goes forward this should be a serious concern for now Admiral Adama. I contend this was a serious flaw in Admiral Helena Cain command. Evidenced by her rather sadistic abuse of ""Six"". A more over a detailed investigation could provide evidence and cause.

All in all the show is perhaps the best SciFi/Drama on the air/cable today. Generally the acting is ""extremely good"".  Edward James Olmos has nailed his role as ""Commander/Admiral William Adama"".  Michael Hogan as ""Colonel Saul Tigh"" is playing a difficult role of the ""flawed Officer"". Borders on Bogarts ""Queeg"" in ""The Caine Mutiny"". Speaking of ""flawed Officers"" Michelle Forbes provides an equally knife edge performance as the strong willed(Kurtz like)Admiral Helena Cain.

Directing is very good. Althrough the camera work takes a bit of getting use too.  The show could use a ""senior"" military adviser to provide some balance to to an otherwise excellent production.

I Recommend the series whole heartedly!",1160265600,2,4620,4.99737876802097
2607221,5,B000GFLEAO,"Is there a such a thing as an overrated science-fiction show or movie? If there is, I haven't heard of it. The really successful sci-fi productions over the years (2001, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Wars--the original three) have generally lived up to the hype, and the obvious suspects (the Men In Black movies, the new Star Wars episodes) were so critically reviled that it's hard to say they're overrated. As you might guess, I'm gearing up to say that Battlestar Galactica is a very underrated series, and that this is inevitable because it is science fiction. However, science fiction is, in a lot of ways, the most inventive genre: with film-noir, or romantic-comedy, etc., there are very definite conventions which one expects to find in a movie of that type. Even with straight drama and comedy, the audience has expectations that it expects will be fulfilled. Science fiction is unique in that people might expect to see ray guns and aliens, but they won't be disappointed if they don't if the story is good, and the genre isn't saddled with the baggage that other genres (like the previously mentioned rom-coms) have to appease. For proof, look at those previously-mentioned productions. What do they all have in common? The answer is: nothing much.

Thus, Battlestar Galactica is a show that the middlebrow types might think is goofy or nerdy is, in fact, a gritty, intensely realistic drama that is surprisingly uncompromising in its dark tone while remaining hopeful about humanity. I seem to be in the minority when I say that I thought the show's first season was way too uneven, and the second season (both parts) was a more consistent and addictive experience. The second half of the second season, though, doesn't quite measure up to the first half. We'll get back to that later. One thing that Battlestar always does is that it starts and ends with strongly, and this set is no exception: along with an extended (and better) version of the cliffhanger Pegasus, the demi-season starts with the two-parter ""Resurrection Ship"", which pits Adama (Edward James Olmos) against the ruthless Admiral Cain (Michelle Forbes, in an excellent guest role) and pits both of them, in turn, against a well-protected enemy fleet. The clash of personalities, not the battle, is the focus of these episodes, and as such it is an extremely satisfying piece of television. The season ends strong as well: with episodes like ""The Captain's Hand"", in which Apollo (Jamie Bamber) has to confront an unstable superior officer; ""Downloaded"", where we get an entire show from the point of view of the enemy Cylons; and the 2+ parter ""Lay Down Your Burdens"", which introduces a whole lot of new story elements and lays the way for what will likely be an excellent third season. The finale's audacity alone is refreshing--it's the sort of bold plot deviation that rarely happens in TV anymore.

However, the middle is the problem. ""Epiphanies"", which covers the final hours of President Laura Roslin, is not bad if you're willing to get over the somewhat red herring-like plot twist, but seeing VP Gaius Baltar's (James Callis) reaction to a letter to him from Roslin almost singlehandedly rescues the episode. The loser of the set is ""Black Market"", which feels like a warmed-over script from another series (make sure to check out the commentary for this one--Ron Moore's criticism of the episode is fairly accurate). I personally liked ""Scar"" for its unflinching portrayal of the psychic travails of Kara ""Starbuck"" Thrace (Katee Sackhoff)--it's the most intense episode on the set. ""Sacrifice"" has a similar problem to ""Black Market"", except that it's a hostage situation. It plays out too many of the conventions of that situation, just about all it needs is a pregnant woman giving birth. Even in the weakest episodes of the season, though, there are generally a few redeeming elements--character moments and so forth--that make you keep watching.

This being said, I still count seven quite good episodes and three average-to-above average ones. Still a better ratio that most shows, right? It's ultimately excusable, too, because when Battlestar is good, it is just as good as virtually any other show on television, and sometimes better. For people who would lump this show in with Star Trek, it is really an anti-Star Trek--aside from the absence of Trek's overly optimistic philosophy, Battlestar is character-driven rather than plot-driven, with characters that have hidden agendas, traumas and struggles and stories that link directly to the present day and ask some uncomfortable questions about our national policies (like the War on Terror) and our society as well. People who say that it is too grim, though, miss the point. It is an epic of survival and a testament to the unbreakable spirit of humanity. In short, it's a habit worth acquiring.",1160006400,3,4860,5.012376237623762
2607222,5,B000GFLEAO,"Before you scoff at this remark please consider the evidence placed before you that shows Sharon Valerii has in fact fulfilled all the requirements of the Messiah to become the Saviour of Mankind.

From the start Capricia 6 has been advising humanity that the Cylons are carrying out the will of God and thus prepared the way for the coming Messiah just like John the Baptist did for Jesus.

Jesus was immaculately conceived, and thus was born without blemish, so he could take the place of the sacrificial lamb and in so doing restore humanities relationship with God. Sharon Valerii was also immaculately conceived and thus was born without sin.

Like Jesus, Sharon was raised amongst humans until her true calling was revealed to her. She then demonstrated her true abilities and revealed openly her true nature, volunteering to be the first test on the Cylon detector and even telling the Chief she was a Cylon.

When Sharon became aware of the full nature of her calling she became incredibly distraught and desperately sought an alternative even trying to kill herself. Jesus equally, was terrified of the path set before him, begging God for an alternative and became so distressed he began sweating Blood.

Eventually both Sharon & Jesus realized the path set before them was the only true path and they accepted their true calling. Jesus entered the Great Temple in Jerusalem, but the Leaders did not welcome him as a King, in fact they were corrupt and Jesus rebuked them for making the Temple a den of money makers and prophesied the destruction of the Temple (the Wailing Wall is now all that remains after the Romans destroyed it). After demonstrating a miracle by destroying a Basestar single-handedly, Sharon brought down the man who most clearly stood for the corruption of humanity, Commander Adama. Yet despite shooting at point blank range she chose not to kill him.

Sharon was then betrayed by those she loved most, and by those who claimed to love her in return. They put her in chains, beat her, tortured her, derided her, denounced her, spat on her and eventually murdered her in cold blood. (No comparison to what happened to Jesus should be necessary).

For all this, Death could not contain her, and Sharon Valeri was resurrected. On being reborn, Sharon was not filled with hatred and disgust for those that had betrayed and murdered her. In fact quite the opposite, she was filled with compassion for humanity and working with her prophet, Capricia 6, embarked on a greater calling to save humanity.

She has left humanity her Spirit in the Body of the second Sharon, who is now guiding Commander Adama. Adama now shows a growing level of humanity as he slowly embraces the wisdom of Sharon. It is easy to see the similarity between Saul's conversion to the great apostle Paul, and Commander Adama's transformation.

So with this evidence before you will you accept Sharon Valerii for what she really is?",1159833600,5,2933,4.85

I watched all twenty episodes in a row and was amazed at the great and subtle quality of the story and acting along with the realistic feel, (physics not withstanding) to this series.  I can groan when I think about how back in the seventies, my room mate and I thought the cheesy original ""Battlestar"" was ""soooo cool"" (Well it did have Jayne Seymour in her prime).

2607235,5,B000GFLEAO,"I'd say Season 2.5 was a mixed bag - some great episodes (Resurrection Ship, Lay Down Your Burdens) and some of the weakest in the series (Epiphanies, Black Market). Most folks don't seem to like Scar but I thought it was pretty good; on the other hand Downloaded seems very popular but I'd put it near the bottom of the pack - I don't think it really offered that much insight into Cylon culture. And Epiphanies - as much as I like the character of Laura Roslin, RDM brings in the deus ex machina to save her - but wait, isn't she the ""dying leader"" that's supposed to lead them to Earth, dying before they get there? It made me wonder if there really is an overall story arc (ala Babylon 5) or if this is just another X-Files redux where we end up with multiple plots going absolutely nowhere. Which is astounding after the early episodes of season 2 pointed so strongly towards them getting to Earth and the first glimpses into the Cylon plan. JMS had no qualms about killing or removing major characters in Babylon 5 where it was required even when they were some of the most popular (Marcus Cole, for example!).

All is forgiven though, thanks to Lay Down Your Burdens - easily the strongest episodes of season 2, particularly the ending which throws everything into the air. One can only hope that in season 3 we'll see the Galactica resume it's quest for Earth quickly!

Regardless of whether there is truly an overall arc ala Babylon 5, Battlestar Galactica is one of the best science fiction/drama shows ever made and I remain a true and loyal fan. Just 8 days till season 3!

One last comment - as regards the cost of season 2.5 and 2.0 DVDs. Get over it! If you paid $50 for season 1, with 13 episodes plus the mini, than $67 for season 2 (20 episodes) isn't unreasonable at all.

2607236,5,B000GFLEAO,"""Battlestar Galactica"" is a remarkable TV series -- the first season was a revelation to viewers seeking intelligent sci-fi programming, and an amazing refashioning of the campy '70s original.  Season Two got off to an uneven start, though, and while the 2.0 package (with episodes 1-10) was consistently engaging, it didn't quite have the cohesive wallop of the first season.  Some fans were starting to wonder if they'd already ""lost it...""

Fear not!  Season 2.5 is a stunning series of shows, beginning with the resolution of the near-civil war caused when the fleet under Galactica's protection merges with the fascistic military crew of the Battlestar Pegasus.  The layers of human civilization are further explored in a series of free-standing genre pieces -- a noir crime episode, an aviator's action tale, etc. -- and then the main plotline is resumed with a vengance.  Cylon psychology and the intricacies of their resurrection technology are tentative explored, with thoroughly satisfying results.  Can't wait for Season Three!

2607238,5,B000GFLEAO,"This new Battlestar Galactica 2.5 DVD boxset release is full of special features and bonus material to attract all viewers. The split season format is great. It airs as half seasons on Sci-Fi and they release it to match its airing schedule and system. There are so many special features, you could spend more time watching them then the actual episodes.

One of the greatest bonuses to the set is the much anticipated and greatly debated extended version of the episode `Pegasus' this special version is over an hour and a half long it was not aired in this format due to time constraints. It views like a feature movie. It has amazing special effects and amazing cinematography.

Other features include deleted scenes, which are broken down by episodes, include the producer's podcasts that aired on the Sci-Fi channel's website during the original airings, and the producer's video Logs and much much more. The deletes scenes are broken down episode by episode.

The bonus material, if not ignored, will help viewers better understand the choices made in preparing the episodes and the season for release.

This half of season 2 has many unique twits and turns in the plots and lives of the characters. We are also introduced to new human cylon models. As to the content itself, in this half of season 2 the central character is Sharon,with her actions developed alongside those of (spoiler alert!) those of a few different Cylon version of her. Byond Sharon's development on Batlestar Galactica and Battlestar Pegasus, which is presented as strongly intertwined with the fate of the whole human race, a great deal of the season deals with relationships - Professional and otherwise - and especially friendships. Striking interactions occur between President Roslyn and Commander Adama; in the complicated relationship between Starbuck and Apollo; with Sharon and, well just about everybody.

In the broader scheme of things, by this point in the series the complexities of guiding a free population while trying to avoid the Cylon army has taken it's toll on both military and civilian leaders of this rag-tag group of humans trying to find a new home on a lost planet called Earth.

The excellent character development in this half of the season can be attributed to very strong scriptwriting. The cliffhanger ending leaves you mouth watering and you desperately awaiting season 3 - which hopefully, after snagging this DVD set, you can finally get caught up in watching. The Sci-Fi channel has to date released 4 of 10 web episodes that have story line development between season's 2 and 3. Season 3 begins airing in the US and Canada on October 7th for the first time the episodes will air in both countries at the same time. We here in Canada will not have to wait days, weeks or months for the US show to finally come to Canada.

BSG is often called the best Sci-fi on television and Newsweek has gone so far as to call it the best drama on TV. With such high praise and the series consistently receiving great reviews - not to mention the special features and additions offered in the 2.5 DVD - how could this DVD box set not be worth every penny?

2607239,4,B000GFLEAO,"I've seen every episode so far, as I'm sure most fans of the show have. It is good enough to make you want to do that. I think I would have to say it is the great cast who carry this show, because anyone who watches will have to admit that it is primarily a drama first and foremost, but drama's are only good when they have good actors to pull it off. My biggest gripe though is that the SciFi and action are relegated to a back seat. It is not uncommon in this series for the story to be leading up to a full scale battle, only to then cut to a scene after the battle is over...or better yet have an entire space dogfight that is conducted via radio transmission but never actually seen. I can only hope season three might garner a better budget to allow for more special effects. Then perhaps this series can become something great, rather than just good.

Having said that, the series does give you some action and SciFi on occasion to add a little spice to the drama.

I'm sure people have debated to death the comparison's of this series to the original BSG series so for my two cents I will only tell you that there is no comparison. They aren't even the same show at all. In fact I wish they had chosen a new name for this series, and left the original on the shelf collecting dust...

While it is true that the show presents many characters with liberal views, not least among them the president Roslin herself, I also feel the show does a good job of presenting characters, such as commander Adama, who have conservative views, and it is interesting how these differing views enter into the drama and the war that they face. Invariably, whenever the humans stray too far in either direction they end up facing possible annihilation all over again..

I also was disappointed that the second season was split, but apparently since there were 20 episodes in season two and 13 in season one, the format for season two doesn't seem too unreasonable to me. I am looking forward to season three as rumors are it will be the best yet.",1158969600,,2036,4.35

Granted it won't look quite as good, nor does it have the extras that the DVDs have, but if one is just trying to share the show with new people... $67 is a bit steep for Season 2.

I know it's nice to have 2.0 out in the mid-season break, but I still feel like this is not a good value, and I don't imagine I'll buy this until they offer a Complete Second Season at a decent price point.  (Say maybe $45 or so)",1158883200,9,682,4.052238805970149

Then I was surprised and blown away by Richard Hatch's performance as Tom Zarek in season one and season two. He truly is an amazing actor and brings depth to the council of twelve.

For in-depth details about this season look at the reviews above. All I can add is the story so far is wonderful and headed in a great direction. I look forward to seasons 3,4,5, etc and even the spin-off ""Caprica"".

As a fan of the show, I did not want to spend money on the other seasons, but 2.5 is well worth it.  This season contains, in my opinion, the best episode of Battlestar Galactica thus far.  Though I'm sure season three will be phenominal.  The best episodes I speak of are as follow:

Resurrection: where Adama learns of the Admiral's true nature, haunting, but still human.  Both commanders of the warships learn that military might is not the only thing that governs a great leader.  Nearly resorting to the dirty work of assisnations, both commanders succumb to their humanity.

Scar: Frack, that Starbuck is one sly fighter ace.  Though a depressing episode as she drowns herself in booze while her wingman is high on uppers, this is one of the most intense episodes as the fligt squadron hunt for the notorious Cylon fighter, Scar.  This is an episode of tragedy and intrigue.  And Lee gets to see a bit of Starbuck's booty.

Lay Down Your Burdens:  By far the most shocking two part episode of them all.  Dr. Baltar, the decieptful vice president in league with a former terrorist, wins the presidential election after Colonel Tye riggs the election in Roslin's favor.  The entire fleet settles on a desolate world to jump start the human population again.  Tye and Starbuck are best friends?  Lee and D are hitched as they sale on the Pegasus?  Starbuck has long hair?  The only thing that could be any more shocking is if the Cylons finally conquer the last human civilization....",1158624000,3,1586,4.657039711191335

Now they release 2.5 basically 2 1/2 weeks before season 3?  Pretty quick for my taste.

2607249,5,B000GFLEAO,"Folks, I don't get all the hubbub over the release of the Season 2 DVDs in two separate packages.  Universal released the 2.0 package in the USA before the second half of Season 2 even aired, which was a very cool thing to do.  Now you're complaining because they are releasing the other half separately.  What would you have Universal do, release only a complete-season package and screw over the people who bought the 2.0 release???  And the price isn't all that bad.  They're still charging $45.00 for the Season 1 package, which is only 13 episodes plus the miniseries.

As for the show itself, I am totally addicted to this series.  This is the first and only series I have ever bought on DVD, just because it's worth watching again and again.  I'm just finishing up Season 2.0 again, and that is some of the best television ever made.  Period.  I admit, however, that Season 2.5 fell down a bit in quality in between the ""Pegasus Pt 2"" and ""Lay Down Your Burdens"" bookends.  The other S2.5 shows are still good, but they seem a little more ""television-y.""  Supposedly Season 3 is going to be mind-bogglingly intense, but that's what hype is all about, eh?

You know you are going to buy Season 2.5, so just go ahead and do it already!",1158105600,13,1240,4.506726457399103
2607250,3,B000GFLEAO,"I guess I am the exception. I'm not wetting my pants over the series as many are. I purchased the season 1 and 2.0 boxes but I think I will skip the rest. A while back I would have also posted a five star review. Having seen one-and-a-half seasons, I am generally about as annoyed as I am entertained or inspired. The series is all about style and is just so completely thin on substance. I call the new Battlestar Galactica (BG), ""FTV sci-fi"" (Fashion TV). There is definitely plenty to like about the show as its broad appeal demonstrates. I suggest, however, that people are so excited over BG as compared to the incredible amount of crap on TV today. I too was initially very excited with the series. It is well filmed and directed and pleasing to the eye.

Each and every character is significantly more well-rounded than the one-dimensional TV characters that are so common, but not that much more so. What I mean is that characters don't fall into the traditional politically and morally correct molds. For example, Laura Roslin is the even-tempered thoughtful leader and yet she surprisingly executes the enemy without batting an eye. But, once these character surprises are revealed, the characters are quite predictable as any other TV character is, just in the opposite way. That is to say, the producers of the show very simply have characters behave against the common TV stereotypes. But, that does not make for actually well-rounded complex characters as many have suggested. I too was pleasantly surprised at the change, but because they are not actually rounded characters along the lines of FireFly, this initial appeal wore off for me.

There is also an excellent teen-aged ""Smallville""-type soap opera plot which I too found very appealing to start. That said, there were also some interesting and fun plots/episodes. However, I find most of the episodes don't stand up at all to any kind of plausibility. It's sort of like watching a James Bond flick: don't question why Bond is not simply shot in the head; just go with it and have fun. By this I do not mean a geeky hyper-analysis of scientific minutiae. There is no alternate world vision. It is very much a 1990s TV drama set on a US aircraft carrier. Try it--call it the USS Galactica and set the fleet in the Pacific in 1943. The whole show still works. In ""Pegasus"", Adama shakes hands with Admiral Cain and they do it horizontally as opposed to vertically. This and about five other discrete items differentiates the world of BG from our own. There was such an opportunity missed to present really interesting plots related to the nature of human beings and artificial intelligence.

Apparently, these humans are an advanced space-faring race capable of creating profoundly advanced artificial intelligence, but the entire body of technology of their society is rooted in 1965. If you found the original BG series corny with their computers as a bank of flashing lights, the new series is an updated version of the exact same thing. Personally, I don't like the attempt at manipulation and speaks to my previous comment of style over substance. The suspension of disbelief required is quite profound. Really, the one and only aspect of the show that has anything remotely to do with science fiction is that everyone is riding on spaceships. If this is not a problem for you, then more power to you. Personally, because of the ""falseness"" of the show, the style lost its appeal for me by the end of season one. And then, I just became annoyed with the pretense of it all.

A lot of what I just said is rooted, I think, to a personal psychology behind this series. If you listen to the producer/writer commentaries, there is definitely something going on here. One of the producers was a former producer for Star Trek the Next Generation. The commentaries drone on and on about how this show is not Star Trek. In terms of style, the show tries to present itself with an ""Alien"" (Sigourney Weaver) grittiness as opposed to the antiseptic feel of Star Trek. But, it doesn't wash. It is a very false and veiled maneuver at budgeting. Whatever one might think of Star Trek, it did present a world vision where technology has solved the day-to-day needs of mankind, allowing a unified and unprejudiced mankind to concentrate on bigger and better things. The commentaries repeatedly speak of an intentional lack of techno-babble. I find the producers disingenuous as their comments clearly show a lack of vision and knowledge. That they are Hollywood hacks really comes across strongly, such that anything that might require a little more thought or effort to understand is just ignored. Listening to them speak, I couldn't help but think of Paris Hilton. And yet, at the same time, several times the producers express their pride at the scientific realism of the show, such as how the Vipers move in space and the documentary style footage of space-action sequences. In that case, even a rudimentary geeky critical look at the realism of the show demonstrates that apart from Vipers flipping end for end, there is absolutely not a single thing in the show that is scientifically plausible. I'm not sure what the producers are so proud of.

Politics is not very subtle in the show. BG is quite allegorical. Just remove the phrase ""the Colonies"" and replace it with ""the United States"" and everything fits precisely, including folding of flags. The over-confident ""colonials"" are all but wiped out by the Cylons. Several times it is explained that the Cylons are of the colonials own making and that all of this is the colonials own fault. Sound familiar? The Cylons' genocide of the human race is several times justified as horrible but understandable. Sound familiar? There are typical scenes of mistreatment of Cylon prisoners by colonials whose unjustified and uncivilized behavior are emphasized at length. Whereas, the entire genocide of the human race and continual shredding of individual colonials by Cylon centurions is glossed over. There is a continual and underlying sentiment that the colonials had all this coming. The parallels between the US and the Islamic world is quite obvious. From what I can see from the WebEpisodes, the colonials take on the role of Palestinians and the Cylons of oppressive Israelis in the occupation of New Caprica. The not at all subtle point is made such that the colonials actions inline with current Palestinian actions become justifiable now that the shoe is on the other foot. Where the show's sympathies lay is quite evident and understandable taking into account that the producers are British Hollywood types. If your politics are right of center, you will be very annoyed. If your politics are left of center, the show should be right in line with your thinking.

In terms of value, the DVD sets suck. I think the point has been made regarding the splitting of season two into two parts. I would note that suddenly a ""season"" has now been cut down again to 20 episodes from 22. Episodes are cut down a lot with so much recapping. It is almost a half-hour show instead of one hour. There is the plot recap, then the explanation of Cylons recap and then the show's theme. Again, if you listen to the commentaries, the producers are very concerned about minimizing channel surfers' confusion should they fall upon the show. I like the thin individual cases for the DVDs. The menus are confusing and not agile. The box is simple and made of thin cardboard; not at all durable. All-in-all the entire physical product is an exercise in cost-cutting and profit maximization. I rate the value of the DVD sets quite low.

In summary, yeah BG is a much better show than most of the reality junk out on TV now, but in my opinion it is hardly this great piece of fiction to get so excited over, especially for the price. I think my post has very much to do with the type of person one is. If you are more impressed with a person because they look good and dress well, you ought to love the show. If you are much more interested in what a person has to say, you will initially be turned on by the show's excellent good looks, but quickly lose interest once you see that there is nothing underneath. If you are annoyed with the show's childish attempt at allegory or its political slant, then you will be annoyed. From start to end, I find the whole show and its marketing one continual and organized attempt at manipulation. I don't like how all the people involved with the show look down upon me, the consumer and viewer. I choose to vote with my pocketbook and not buy the series.",1157673600,20,8594,4.7521768251841925

So now lets see if you have about 20 hours of Battlestar Galactica that comes to about $270.00.  So I think spending $70.00 is worth it.

This DVD set has all my very favorite episodes on it. The two episodes that reveal more about the Cylons (Scar and Downloaded) are both phenomenal. In Scar, we learn more about the Cylon raiders, which are not funny-looking vipers piloted by Cylon pilots (like in the first series) but the ship itself is a space-dwelling AI robot/cyborg that is downloaded and reborn when it is destroyed just like the human-form Cylons. In Downloaded, we get to see occupied Caprica and into Cylon society. It's fascinating and tour de force world-building.

My favorite episodes, though, are Lay Down Your Burdens (1 and 2.) In these two climactic episodes, so much happens that changes the plotline so much. I was astonished. It always amazes me how incredible the writers are in this series that they progress the plot and allow the characters to change so much with every episode that the characters' arcs over the course of these first two seasons are huge. BSG is probably the best show on TV.

I couldn't have been happier when the first half of season two was released prior to the TV premiere of the second half.  I missed a couple of episodes, so it allowed me the opportunity to catch-up before continuing the saga.  It's the best thing the studio could have done, even if it was also in their own interest.

Overall Season 2 was better than Season 1 from an 'action' perspective, but probably not as involving from a 'character' perspective. Loved some of the last episodes (Pegasus, Resurection Ship 1 &2, Scar and Download) ... and the last 2 episodes leave the way open to an interesting Season 3.

That said, one is beginning to wonder which of the protaganists (Humans and Cylons) really deserves to prevail. Both have very unattractive characteristics, the humans as a group seem irremediably stupid and trite,and often the lone voice for sanity is one of the major protaganists (Adama, Roslin etc). Some of the human protaganists (Tigh, Cain etc) seem either totally divorced from reality or martinets of the highest order, and totally disconnected from their circumstances.

The idea of AI's getting all metaphysical also seems a tad unrealistic. I mean the Cylons were made by humans, and it seems illogical for them to bother carrying this any further - especially given the logic traps that this would leave them in.

2607261,3,B000GFLEAO,"Season 2 got a little dull towards the end--particularly the episodes involving ""Scar"" and the Billy brouhaha--and let's face it, the deus ex machina of Laura's miracle cure was lame.

Overall, a fair season compared to season 1, which surpasses it easily, but gets steeped in building a new mythos and loses direction now and then.  Nonetheless the acting  and production is superb.

2607263,5,B000GFLEAO,"I love this show on every level; I have yet to see an episode that strikes a false note (OK,OK, the episode ""Sacrifice"" was a bizarre minor key).  The 5 star reviews above have very literately cataloged the show's pleasures:  excellent interweaving of backstory to frontstory; character development; special effects; true surprises.  The characters of Starbuck, Sharon and Helo are especially impressive - they, and the actors who play them, shade good into evil into good and sympathy into condemnation back into sympathy.

But I'd like to write about the amazing and slightly subversive politics of BSG!  The now anachronistic 70's disco version of BSG was supposedly a version of the Mormon myth -- planets populated by humans who spread out over the galaxy.  The 21st century version of BSG is equally subversive - we are actually rooting for the conservative candidate Laura Roslin, pro-life, born again believer (in the Greek Gods) and a kick-a#* militarist to boot!  The fact that the writers of the series pull this off in such a subtle fashion is extraordinary... think about it... Gaius Baltar is the anti-war, pro-choice, free drugs for everyone candidate!

We swallow so much pablum from network and, yes, even cable TV.  BSG is complex, challenging, and really, really fun.  If you haven't seen it, and you need a new addiction, I highly recommend it.",1155945600,9,1364,5.022222222222222
2607264,4,B000GFLEAO,"I agree with many reviewers that the new BSG series is excellent in many ways.  I'm impressed with the character development, visual effects, and imaginative stories.  Best of all, the characters portrayed are not perfect but are flawed, as we all are.  What would have happened to Voyager if Captain Janeway had a drinking problem or came onto Neelix in the turboshaft?

Regarding the cost of the BSG DVDs, the fair price is what the market will bear.  If one is willing to pay ~$70 for the twenty episodes of season two, then they deserve to be charged that much.  Clearly, Universal Studios is not a charity.  Their goal is to make money.  If consumers balked at paying the asking price of BSG DVDs, the price would go down.  Do you have the balls to hold out for a lower price?  For many, the answer is no.  That's why we pay over $3 per episode.  Frequently I wait a few months and pick up a used set of DVDs for half the price.  Patience has benefits.

I'm looking forward to the upcoming season.  Are these guys gonna make it to Earth, or what?",1155513600,13,1051,4.373056994818653

This show is simply amazing and I want to thank the producers for bringing this amazing saga to our TV screens!",1154131200,3,273,4.269230769230769
2607266,5,B000GFLEAO,"I love this show and was really disapointed when at the season finale i found out that it wouldnt becoming back in July like the other Friday lineup but that I would have to wait till October. October! I have been waiting for this DVD to come out since March so I agree with what others are saying about the cost. If you like the show and want the DVD you will cough up the money, if you don't want to then don't! Its you prerogative, but I for one don't care how much this DVD costs I will buy it anyway!",1153699200,4,505,3.9607843137254903
2607267,5,B000GFLEAO,"For anyone who is following this series, it is way beyond the original disco version.  The cost isn't that bad with pre-ordering. Myself, I record the series, but I find that the DVD collection is great as you can go back and find something you missed before.......no paid advertising to deal with, so all of those who are going to wait for the price to drop......you can always later buy someone else's used.",1153612800,,409,4.602739726027397
2607268,5,B000GFLEAO,"Kudos to who knows who said that. This is an excellent show and great entertainment, and I don't have an issue with the pricing. With values such as Amazon I can watch the show and still munch on popcorn at the same time. At some point you have to decide if the cost exceeds your desire to see the show. For me it hasn't. For those who complain, but still buy the DVD sets, it hasn't either. At some point, however, I'll stop putting gas in my car. That's another story and probably a truer example of one of the many ways we are truly being ripped off, but at least with BSG there is a great idea, with talented writers and Im getting great entertainment and I'm happy.",1152748800,5,670,4.2015503875969
2607269,5,B000GFLEAO,"I see (and have seen) many people complaining about getting ""ripped off"" by them splitting the seasons up.  But truly you are paying no more than if they released the whole series at once.  30 dollars for each would equal 60 dollars for the whole set which is about on par with (not all but) alot of the TV boxsets. Also consider that season 1 had only 13 episodes and the mini series and was retailed at 49.99 so an extra 15(ish)dollars for 20 episodes is hardly unreasonable.

That aside this show is wonderful.  Has a great mixture of diffrent elements that just keeps you hooked.  In my opinion it IS the best show on television.",1152489600,4,633,4.422413793103448
2607270,4,B000GFLEAO,"OK, the split thing is annoying.  I wouldn't mind it IF they were releasing a combined set as well, and don't rule that out down the road.  The only advantage to the way they did it was that those of us who were behind in the middle of Season 2 were able to get the first half and catch up.

Marketing ploys aside, this is still the best show on TV (with LOST a close second).  Sadly, many people are missing out because they don't realize this is nothing like the hokey 70s version of the series (or because they can't stand the fact that it isn't! LOL).  But the fact is, what we have here is a fantastic drama with one of the best assembled casts.  Great writing and pacing - effects that are simply too good for TV - and a compelling millitary drama that ""just happens"" to be set in space.  I urge those of you who like your shows gritty and honest, with action thrown in and twists aplenty - give BSG a chance!

As I mentioned in the title, the only thing I didn't like this season was the last 15 minutes of the last episode.  It took things in a totally different direction (kudos for originality) and it will remain to be seen in season three if they have painted themselves into a corner, or are setting us up for something truly great.  As it is, I might have ended Season 2 with the big event that happens 15 minutes prior to the ending (those who saw it know what I mean) and thus left it as a real nail-biting cliffhanger.

At any rate - split set and all - this is still the best show on TV and DVD!",1152403200,4,1513,4.077702702702703
2607271,5,B000GFLEAO,I agree 100% about this being the nickel and diming of consumers.  I bought 2.0 without realizing it was only .5 of a season.  How VERY lame and greedy.  I LOVE the show but intensely dislike this marketing ploy.,1152316800,13,212,4.384615384615385
2607272,5,B000GFLEAO,"I'm VERY annoyed by two things, but first, let me tell you, I LOVE BSG. I never thought I would find something I liked as Much as ANY trek, But this takes it. This series is GREAT.

What I am annoyed by is this;

They are ripping us off by making us buy season 2 in 2 separate packages. For myself, I have no choice; I must have it. So I will pay. But I think they shot themselves in the foot by pulling this stunt and ticked off a bunch of the other people that would be hard core buyers.

No doubt they will later release a boxed set, further penalizing us early adopters. I hope they at least offer a large box for free via mail in or something for us to box our sets together later (Like they did with LOTR)

The pother thing that annoys me is that I've been waiting TOO FRACKIN' LONG for this!!!!!!

Why did it take so long until they released these???????

Because they wanted to sell them to us, bit by bit on Ipod?

Well, I foxed 'em, (pun intended) I'm grabbing them via windows media Sony Giga Player and watching them on my PocketPC.",1152230400,10,1044,4.088235294117647
