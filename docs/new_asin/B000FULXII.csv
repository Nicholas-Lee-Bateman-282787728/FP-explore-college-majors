8126926,3,B000FULXII,This dvd is actually the short films from the game itself. It is not a movie. Fun to watch if you played the game though.,1451692800,,121,3.88
8126927,1,B000FULXII,"Very poorly done, extremely poor video and content.",1432598400,,51,5.5

8126929,5,B000FULXII,this is a very fun look back at the old starcraft world if you are like me you are a die hard starcraft fan watching all the cinematics is alot of fun and brings on so much nostalgia it is unreal if you are a starcraft fan you need this in your collection,1395360000,,255,3.830188679245283
8126930,3,B000FULXII,When the original DVD came out I felt the $25 price was exorbitant for what amounted to just regular cutscenes from the two games.  For those who would like to see the nostalgic tales on the TV without resolution problems this DVD is for you.,1253318400,,242,4.377777777777778
8126931,3,B000FULXII,"DVD left something to be desired.
DVD arrived in a very timely fashion.
DVD arrived in excellent condition.",1234569600,,107,5.0
8126932,5,B000FULXII,"A nice DVD for any starcraft fan who enjoys Blizzard's creative cinematucs.  This includes all the cinematic cut scenes from starcraft and brood war except it is missing one from starcraft.  There is one cut scene that shows Kerrigan sleeping inside her crysalis as she is being infested.  It was only a few seconds long but I do not think it is on this DVD.  Other than that, the video is high quality and it is a nice addition to any collection.",1231027200,4,447,4.414634146341464
8126933,2,B000FULXII,This is literally all the cut-scenes of the game. I guess I expected it would be higher resolution though - but it's the same old blocky looking video...,1210291200,16,153,4.5
8126934,3,B000FULXII,"I only bought this because I'm a huge fan of the game and because of the price. I mean, you can't beat a penny + $3 in shipping. That's a bargain! It seemed to be a good idea to put all cutscenes together to make it like a movie but I actually got bored through the first 15 minutes. The Broodwar cutscenes are better, of course. What I didn't like was the transition from one cutscene to another. Green lines covered the screen for the first 3 seconds. I liked the menus though. They're reminiscent to the actually game menu.
Storywise, you'll probably won't know what's going on unless you've actually played the game. The extras do provide backstories of each race. What I'm really hoping for Blizzard to do is to release a Starcraft 2 DVD. The cutscenes for the new game are incredible. Lets hope they catch on to this idea. Otherwise, the Starcraft DVD is more of a collectors item for the fan of the game but you can't beat it for the price that you can get it for.",1200441600,11,971,4.311475409836065
8126935,5,B000FULXII,"I Have not seen this DVD yet, but the cutscene's in Starcraft and Brood War were some of the best Game Movies i have even seen. and now they are digitally mastered and put on a single Limited Edition DVD. That is SWEEEETT!!",1197763200,,223,4.209302325581396
