3773343,3,B001R3YRIU,We haven't watched Dadnapped yet.  We bought the video because our son is an extra in one of the scenes - so naturally we had to buy it.  Hatching Pete is a cute movie and certainly acceptable and even entertaining for younger children.,1299628800,,236,4.465116279069767

3773346,4,B001R3YRIU,"First off, this review is for Hatching Pete ONLY! I still have not seen Dadnapped. I thought this was a really good movie. I happened to catch it on tv a few hours ago, so I decided to watch it! It has an awesome plot and a perfect comedy for the whole family. Cleatus Poole is tired of dressing up as the chicken mascot, so he asks his friend Pete to fill in for him. It turns out that Pete is a lot better, funnier, and awesome as the chicken than Cleatus ever was. Pete begins to bring out the spirit of the town and people begin to come to the basketball games just to see the chicken. I highly recommend HATCHING PETE!!!",1245024000,,625,4.0894308943089435
3773347,4,B001R3YRIU,"For those of us who remember, Disney used to piggyback movies a lot for theaters, especially in the 1970's, when you would see ""Lady and the Tramp"" with ""One Little Indian"" or ""Cinderella"" with ""One of Our Dinosaurs is Missing. It's kind of cool to have two recent wacky Disney Channel original comedies in the same package.

""Dadnapped"" is the wackier of the two. It's almost a tween version of ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" with an familiar cast of Disney Channel regulars in a zany caper.  Basically a young girl (Emily Osment) and her dad (George Newbern) bond because he, a popular kid's adventure series writer, is kidnapped. As is common with such comedies, the young characters are the most level headed and ultimately save the day, this time with trash, slime and dental floss for a gag-filled but nonviolent finale.

The actors are stars as far as frequent viewers of Disney Channel series are concerned. Most are given a chance to play roles outside the ones in which they are most frequently seen, particularly Jason Earles, who seems to be in more grown up role than on ""Hannah Montana,"" playing a character named, yes, Merv. Ooooooooo. When this movie was promoted on the channel, they drew attention to ""Phill Lewis as you've never seen him before,"" so part of the attraction was clearly seeing these transformations, though David Henrie of ""Wizards of Waverly Place"" is probably still eager for an opportunity to play a non-nerd.

""Dadnapped,"" being more or less a vehicle for the actors, is to my family a little less satisfying than Hatching Pete, which on the surface seems like a silly story about a teen who finds himself more popular in school from being inside a chicken suit at basketball games, but less popular as himself, is like the ""Spider-Ma""n situation. There is an opportunity for some richness of character and relationships within the plot. Hatching Pete also benefits greatly from the boy-next-door appeal of Jason Dolley, who also scored well for Disney Channel as a lead in Minute Men.

As in ""Dadnapped,"" various Disney Channel actors (a sturdy stable not unlike that of the early Disney days) have roles in ""Hatching Pete,"" but in this film, the roles offer them a little more character range as well as changes of pace.

Both films offer some bonus material, though somewhat sparse. ""Dadnapped"" includes what amounts to a tag scene touted as an ""extended ending"" and a quite nice flash animated comic book style adventure featuring the character the Dadnapped dad created. ""Hatching Pete"" includes a short documentary about the mascot, which, according to my daughter, was not among the many interstitials from the Disney Channel.

Plus, an enclosed code allows you to unlock two music videos starring Emily Osment and Mitchel Musso -- again very much following a Disney tradition in promoting musical careers like Annette and Hayley Mills. It will be interesting to see where each of these performers go on their respective paths.",1242604800,8,2972,4.908366533864542

If you're debating whether to get it or not I'd get it and not hesitate.",1399161600,,366,4.169014084507042
3773366,3,B001R3YRIU,"It really is a shame that Disney refuses to release films that are a little edgier for young adults, because sometimes, they really do come up with a good story. The problem is that by the time they are done dumbing it down and disnifying it, the once promising story becomes a joke. that only 10 year olds seem to get. Hatching Pete is one of these film that have a really terrific storyline. With a little more realism and a little less Disney, it would have been a really spectacular film. Hatching Pete features two best friends, Cleatus (Mitchel Musso) and Pete (Jason Dolley) who are complete opposites. Cleatus is so outgoing that he is actually his local High School's mascot, while Pete is a loner, scared of his own shadow. One day Cleatus is injured and Pete sees that as an opportunity to get close to the girl he is afraid to talk to, so he takes his place as the mascot. When one is infatuated with a girl, it will drive them to do anything, and Pete puts on a hilarious show, that even inspires his team, the worst basketball team in the state. Cleatus quickly becomes a school celebrity and a target of bullies, but once it's discovered he's not the one inside the costume, the question becomes who is the mascot? The story was a really good mix of comedy, coming-of-age drama, and athletic competition. At it's core, I really did enjoy this film, but ultimately all the Disney crap manages to diminish it's quality. As for the cast, it's you're usual Disney cast, filled with a lot of beautiful people, only a couple of whom can actually act, and the star of this film is Jason Dolley. I always wondered why Disney keeps putting this kid on show after show, but now I know, he actually has some talent. He was charismatic and showed terrific range going from one personality to another in a relatively short time. While Dolley was fun to watch and even gave me a few laughs, the rest of the cast wasn't much to right home about. Hatching Pete is a terrific film for kids and some young adults, and while it has a story that adults would like, the Disney factor makes it somewhat unlikely that most will - The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078",1394496000,,2167,4.447236180904523
3773367,3,B001R3YRIU,"I've yet to watch Dadnapped but I have seen Hatching Pete.  Hatching Pete was very unusual for a Disney movie.  It's about two friends Cletus and Pete.  Cletus is basically a user and gets Pete to be the team mascot at their school and doesn't bother to tell anybody he , Cletus, in fact isn't the mascot, but he continues to get credit for being the mascot.  Half way through the movie he starts to feel guilty, as he should for being a user.  I guess you could call it a love hate film.  Dadnapped might be good but Hatching Pete was a disappointment.",1392681600,,553,4.269230769230769
