8210338,3,B000EMGEU4,"Season 1 was not what I expected sides the only episode is on this dvd is the episode ""Killer"" which is not on volumes 1-3 of the show. So far the remaining episodes on this DVD are already on all 3 volumes of The Hitchhiker show series which I've got all 3 on DVD. Also any chance that the 1st&2nd complete seasons of The Hitchhiker show DVD will be back in stock to purchase on the Amazon website?",1512432000,,399,4.128205128205129
