8512938,5,B000YU44DU,Floorplay is the second instalment in this franchise the first instalment is Burn the Floor.  Burn the Floor - Floorplay is a journey.  It is a melding of both past and present and is choreographed by Jason Gilkison who is a wonderful choreographer. Jason describes this as a Dream come true. If you love So you think you can Dance this is 100 times better there are no amateurs most of the dancers have been dancing for a long time. For more info see [...].  The DVD is terrific and very exciting and will make you want to get up and dance!!! If you have a chance see them live Floorplay is touring at the moment you won't regret it!!,1254700800,,635,4.275
