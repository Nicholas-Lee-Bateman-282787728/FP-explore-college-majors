7998745,2,B0000CBY04,I got this because Parker Stevenson is in it. His character is kind of a jerk. The movie itself is interesting enough but the ending is horrible and pointless....I want my money back.,1399075200,,183,4.575757575757576
7998746,5,B0000CBY04,"I toured by motorcycle a few years ago much the area along the Murray River where this video was filmed. Subsequent to that tour, I purchased ""All the Rivers Run"" and enjoyed it so much that I purchased ""The Rivers Run"". The storyline and the scenery are even more meaningful if one understands the history and culture of Australia. I would also recommend music, books and videos by Ted Egan of Australia.",1393632000,,405,4.638888888888889
7998747,5,B0000CBY04,"6 hour 52 minute movie.  Was pleased to see it on disc. Like others would like to have seen the film remastered to a better quality. Also glad I did not have to pay $60.00 for it like I did originally (film lost in home disaster).
This movie has adventure, romance, suspense, drama, hopes and terror.",1389830400,,300,4.357142857142857
7998748,4,B0000CBY04,"Second part of a mini-series, 3  hours viewing time, filmed in Australia.  Haven't been able to discover what year this movie was made.  I'd guess probably in the 1990s.

The story about a couple with 3 young children, all the persons undergoing great stresses, is set in turn-of-the-19th-century Australia among European immigrants, a lot of whom are Irish.  It is as absorbing and interesting as any life story involving struggles with disastrous problems and crises can be, although it takes awhile (from my point of view) for the conflict and the characters to become compelling.  The viewer really begins to care about the characters and wants to know how everything is going to turn out only after two love plots that threaten the marriage begin to create emotional tension.

If you are in the mood to experience a good story with a few unexpected turns of plot and an unexpected ending, this movie would be an excellent choice.  Just prepare to take some time getting into it.

The movie is billed on its cover as a ""Family Classic,"" but this description gives the wrong impression of what this movie is like.  It's more like ""The African Queen"" than like a cosmetified ""Hallmark movie.""  Although there are children in the story, in my opinion the movie depicts situations that would be most meaningful and interesting for adults.  Children would probably be bored with it.  Since it does not contain bad language (at least not any that I recall), or nudity, or steamy sex scenes, it is in that sense like a typical ""family movie"" (--and thankfully so, for this adult).  There are kissing scenes, and there is one apparently intimate but discrete scene in which the husband and wife are together.

On the movie's cover, ""The River Runs"" is subtitled ""A Journey of Faith & Hope.""  Again, the billing gives a wrong impression.  This movie does NOT touch in any RELIGIOUS sense upon the virtues of ""Faith"" or ""Hope.""  In fact, the theme of this secular story--and when I say secular, I mean that religion is not even mentioned anywhere in it--is hardly about those specific qualities per se.  Rather, it is, overall, like most movies, a generalized morality story about well-intentioned, honest, ""good"" persons who struggle to endure under maddening, unfair pressures exerted by ""bad"" characters.  There is an underlying awareness of the good characters' strength of character, but no pronounced particular emphasis on Faith and Hope that I noticed.

Good story-telling in mildly interesting landscape and settings.  Not much expensive cinematic razzle-dazzle.

Would be very interested to see also the first part of the mini-series about the heroine's childhood, but that seems not to be available as a movie.",1371427200,2,2715,4.984444444444445
7998749,5,B0000CBY04,"Five stars to a concept worth discussing during Family nights. It allows you to think thru complex ideas.

DVD in great shape. It arrived faster than anticipated.",1364169600,,162,5.0

7998751,1,B0000CBY04,"I'm sorry I spent time watching this movie, always hoping that somewhere it would make sense, hoping the ""Journey of Faith and Hope"" would somehow lead to a happy family reunion, which almost happens, then is ""killed"" by an ending that makes no sense at all.  I hope I can get [...] bucks at my next garage sale for this piece of garbage!",1252454400,2,338,4.365079365079365
7998752,1,B0000CBY04,"I bought this DVD to revive the memories of a broadcast from my childhood years. It costs quite higher than an average single-disk DVD from Amazon and I still thought it is worth having it on DVD at home.

On first seconds of the film I was surprised with quality. The picture is quite grainy with dust pieces visible. The tape was not edited or remastered. Yet this is not the major disappointment.

This is only the second part or mini-series of the two. The one here starts when the main characters are alreay married with kids and running their boat. The whole chunk about Deli's arrival to Australia and childhood, as well as how she met Brenton was in the first part, not included here. Plus, the VHS-version reviews state that the American edition (as well as Australian DVD) was heavily edited from the original broadcast.

I guess, I wasted $18+SH on something which will stand on my shelf. What I want is a complete mini-series (both parts) and this edition sold here is not the thing.",1223769600,11,995,4.578651685393258
7998753,5,B0000CBY04,"Picking up where the first series left off. Most of the original cast are back for more adventures along the Mighty Murray River. Deli played this time by Nikki Coghill, John Waters returns as Brenton ""Teddy"" Edwards. Brillant, Captivating, Moving!!",1181347200,3,249,5.25
