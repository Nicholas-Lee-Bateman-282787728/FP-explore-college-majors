8375395,5,B002NTDXPU,i use to watch this show on tv and really like watching this show again in my home,1520121600,,82,3.611111111111111
8375396,1,B002NTDXPU,"I eagerly awaited this set because the blurb seemed to indicate that the episodes were not the same as the shows on the 2008 disc set which I purchased about 2 years ago---but no, the set I received didn't have any new items.  No episode was about a terror attack in an Israeli marketplace or the implosion of a Las Vegas Hotel.  I really thought I would be getting a new product instead of repackaged reruns---what do I do now?",1388448000,,428,4.3375
8375397,5,B002NTDXPU,"Showed a lot of different destruction, wasn't what I expected. I expected more man made demolitions but was entertained anyway.",1356739200,,127,5.4
8375398,5,B002NTDXPU,"If you like to watch things blow up, or smash into other things, this is the DVD set for you.  These 2 DVD's contain 10 episodes of non-stop action.  Lots of fun to watch.  No re-creations or dramatizations here, just the real footage of real events unfolding.  A spectacular collection with minimal comentary.",1268438400,7,310,4.7924528301886795
