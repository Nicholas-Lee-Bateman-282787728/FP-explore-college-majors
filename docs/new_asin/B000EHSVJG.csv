2520020,3,B000EHSVJG,"I've been waiting for some time for someone to finally release a copy of Day the World Ended in widescreen as it was originally released.  Unfortunately, Lionsgate did it WRONG.  Although they obviously used a real widescreen print as their source, for some reason of their own they formatted it into the wrong screen ratio for their DVD--using 2.35 to 1 instead of the original 1.88 to 1, which cuts off the top and bottom of the picture (in one scene, for example, you get to see a talking NOSE at the bottom of the screen).  This is part of a disturbing trend among DVD producers, who are apparently trying to cater to the widescreen TV crowd (which makes it even MORE unusual that Lionsgate went 2.35 to 1--as it will have to be letterboxed even on a widescreen TV!), at the expense of the original film formats (which sometimes results in people with half-heads and no feet).  At least She Creature is full screen (closer to the original 1.33 to 1 ratio), but the print is a bit dark.",1151539200,57,989,4.477777777777778
2520021,4,B000EHSVJG,"After suffering DVD bootlegs of these two titles these past years, it was nice to finally get both of these films officially, and on the same disc. I hafta say, the transfer quality is decent and offers crisper viewing of both films if you've only seen VHS transfers-to-DVD courtesy of Ebay as I only had, so I can't really complain.

There are definitely parts in both that are  washed out/speckled, but not so much that they're annoying. One of the cool things I appreciate about these Arkoff double features is BOTH FILMS are featured on ONE SIDE of the disc. There's none of that double sided nonsense which ultimately renders one unlucky playing side scuffed over time. Here, the movie art is screened onto the topside of the disc and once in, there's a menu to take you to either film.

For me at least, the main reason to watch these films is the monsters in them. The Paul Blaisdell (sp?) shoestring budget, classic monster creations are a pleasure to see despite not being featured as prominantly as this viewer would like. If you have trouble stomaching old-school cheapie monster suits, then stay far away, especially if you're an unshakable CGI accolyte cuz these rubber suits will make your eyes bleed and send you into seizures. But if you grew up on old FAMOUS MONSTERS issues and model kits, you could probably appreciate the creatures at least. The films:

""DAY THE WORLD ENDED"": I'd only seen a full frame of this flick, so it was nice to see it letterboxed or whatever that's called. There's parts of the pic's image (the sides, the top & bottom are the same) I'd never seen before in my old copy. The acting throughout is typical 50's...a little....err..... well....ALOT on the melodramatic end, but hey, if you're watching old school flicks, this shouldn't surprise you. I found the father ...the man whose house all of the survivors gravitate to, to be a little grating through most of his performance....in fact there's a point in the film when he demands his daughter basically marry the Richard Denning character to populate the new world which was not only laughable in that 'ooooooh uh uh, no he didn't' kind of way to almost feeling like nails on a chalkboard it is so painful to watch, despite it trying to play as a heartfelt ....uh....heartfelt....uh......anyway.....

""THE SHE-CREATURE"": Man...I love the suit design of this monster. Waiting for her to appear makes watching this mostly stilted movie  bearable. I didn't find it as awful as a few people I know....certainly no more awful than other drive in flicks that I get great pleasure suffering through, but it isn't all that great either. The Hypnotist is such an over the top wannabe-all-powerful- villain, he's a pleasure to watch....most of the time. The chick who's under his spell is a 50's hottie, though her innocent victim part got a little grating after a bit, I kept waiting for her to bite her knuckles in typicall 50's fashion. Her 'Hero' was a bit stiff throughout his performance (no pun intended hehe;-) But hey.....remember...it's all about waiting for the monsters.

OVERALL: They're drive-in movies from way back-I love this stuff. My friends sometimes wonder why I bother with them. There's a heavy does of nostalgia involved, but there's also the fact that I can spend 30 bucks at a theater these days and still walk out hating the movie. Here, for less than 15 bucks, I get two films...infinite cigarette and bathroom breaks and no one chopping it up on their cell phones one or two seats over. These fall somewhere between PLAN 9 and HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL in viewability if that tells you anything. For the price, they're definitely worth it. Now when does INVASION OF THE SAUCERMEN come out??????

NOTE: I give this entire package 4 stars for being a double feature and a value at its price. I'd give each film a 3 on their own. Since these are supposed to be reviews of the PRODUCT as well as films, I needed to take that into account. So don't none o' ya'll email me screaming about how awful you thought the films were but bought it because you expected a 4-star feature...lol!!!;-)",1145750400,156,4097,4.73632538569425

2520052,3,B000EHSVJG,"I bought this disc because The Day The World Ended is a classic from the era of massive worries about THE BOMB.  OK, the mutants look pretty cheesy in rubberized costumes, but the whole thing was shot in about 10 days, so what can you expect?  Seeing a young Mike Conners (Mannix) billed as ""Touch"" Connors (""Touch""?) and playing a despicable bad guy was enjoyable.  It's the classic story of a small group of survivors holed up and trying to outlast hunger and mutants after the Bombs fell.  The characters are a bit shallow but it's the idea of what the group will do to survive that is the real star.  This flick was re-made about 10 years later and titled ""In the Year 2889.""  Identical plot, with some updated effects is the only difference.  As far as the other film, ""The She-Creature"" is concerned...well...as I said, I bought the disc because The Day The World Ended was on it.

Watch both for a simulated trip to your  favorite drive-in! Upon ordering and viewing this twin-bill, I was impressed with Chester Morris' (Boston Blackie in the 40's) high quality performance in ""The She Creature"". Like Karloff, even in a low budget setting, he delivers first-rate goods. Talent is plain to see. Low budget, but a high result. Darn cool. Ditto for Denning in ""Day The World Ended"". But, is it just me? Shouldn't the title be ""THE Day The World Ended""?? For fans of low budget (but high fun) horror, this is a great DVD double delight.

2520087,2,B000EHSVJG,"Very poor transfers.  ""Day The World Ended 1955""  is formatted widescreen, problem is they matted it in a 4:3 standard block so what that means is watching this film on you widescreen television will have solid black bars on all 4 sides with the image taking up about 60% of your screen space.  Why they didn't just transfer this into 1.33:1 Full Screen instead of Widescreen inside a full screen box is beyond me. And yes you guessed it, this film is non-anamorphic.
  On top of this major blunder the film displays major damage, dirt, wobble and a weak soundtrack so do yourself a favor and pass on this garbage.
  ""She-Creature"" is in much better shape and takes advantage of a full screen 1.33:1 standard image and does not have as much artifacting as Day The World Ended.  Yet the film is very dark and over-contrasted at times very grainy.

Both of these films are great B-Movie Cheeze films from the 50's and compared to today's films could be considered great since the acting and script are decent even if the monsters are laughable by today's standards.

 Sorry folks I will go against the crowd on this one and tell you to stay away from this stinker of a release you will not be pleased by the substandard video image.",1408579200,2,1230,4.545454545454546
2520088,5,B000EHSVJG,"You know, sometimes you gotta watch some total schlock.  (Something I can't explain to my daughters -- they just think I'm punishing myself.)  And there's no denying these two choices are some prime schlock. Bomb-scare flick ""The Day the World Ended,"" with a small ragtag band of survivors (including a small-time hood and his sleezy stripper girlfriend) fighting radioactive monsters in a neat little house in an Eden-like valley, was remade with the exact same script and a different cast as ""In the Year 2889""; even that time, it was pure schlock, though a couple of the actors were slightly more talented.  Look for Mike Connors (later known as TV's ""Mannix"") going by his earlier pseudonym of Touch Connors in the former film.  ""The She-Creature,"" with a tenuous plot concerning reincarnation and million-year-old (which to this scriptwriter meant ""dinosaur era"") aquatic female predators of some quasi-reptilian form (actually a rubber suit built and worn by SFX man Paul Blaisdell, which despite representing some sort of reptile still has a formidably feminine rack), plus a sinister carnival hypnotist and the lovely helpless woman who he keeps in his bedroom-eyed thrall.

You need to watch stuff like these late-50s drive-in staples because 1)they're so much part of a bygone era; 2) they're always good for a chuckle (and a dozen grimaces); and 3) they make you appreciate the good stuff that much more.",1407456000,3,1415,5.108225108225108

2520097,5,B000EHSVJG,"On his way to becoming Hollywood's king of low-budget movies, in 1955 a young Roger Corman produced and directed ""Day the World Ended."" It was one of his earliest films. Dozens more would follow in the years to come. But in his 1998 memoir, Corman remarks that it was this movie that established him as a director in the science fiction genre (p. 31).

The film's opening title card announces, ""What you are about to see may never happen. . . . but to this anxious age in which we live, it presents a fearsome warning. . . . Our Story begins with . . . . THE END!""

Next we see an example of that now-familiar stock footage of an atomic explosion, and we hear the narrator, the great Chet Huntley. His voice has been modified to sound tinny with a bit of reverb, a convention that signals to the viewer that these words come from the Bible. The narration interprets the nuclear holocaust with words taken from 2 Peter 3:10 according to the King James Version: "". . . and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.""

As survivors of World War III emerge through the smoke, the narrator tells us, ""Man has done his best to destroy himself. But there is a force more powerful than man. And in his infinite wisdom, he has spared a few."" Those few soon begin showing up at the home of Jim Maddison (Paul Birch). Maddison and his daughter, Louise (Lori Anderson, pictured below) are safe, at least for the time being. Their house is in a valley protected by high winds, and by hills all around that contain lead-ore. Jim, a veteran of the U.S Navy, had long suspected that the worst would eventually happen. Ten years before it did, he carefully chose where he would live and stocked everything he would need in order for his family to survive. The lovely Louise has a fianc, but we soon discover that he is among the victims.

The survivors who take refuge at the Maddison's include a small-time crook Tony Lamont (Touch Conners, before he became Mike Conners of Mannix fame) and his girlfriend, an aging stripper named Ruby (Adele Jergens). A geologist named Rick (Richard Denning), who carries on his shoulders a man named Radek (Paul Dubov), follows them. Nearly dead, it seems, Radek has a bad case of radiation poisoning. Finally, a crusty old gold prospector, Pete (Raymond Hatton) shows up with his burro, Diablo, in tow. Thrown together by circumstance, the group spends the next several weeks waiting for the radiation to dissipate. Everyone stays inside for the most part, except for Radek who often wanders out at night, and whose high roentgen count leads Jim and Rick to wonder why he's still alive.

Eventually, they discover that Radek is some sort of partial mutant who kills and eats contaminated game during his nighttime ventures. As Rick describes things, Radek has survived because he's the victim of ""an entirely-new set of laws that we know nothing about."" But soon, Radek the hunter becomes prey. Stalking the valley is a full-blown mutant, actually Paul Blaisdell wearing one of the cheapest, most-pathetic monster suits in cinematic history. Soon after this monster with the huge head, bird beak, three eyes, and a 34-inch waist kills Radek, some of the other characters begin to kill off themselves or each other. Having grown impatient, Pete climbs out of the valley and onto the radioactive ridge. Tony, with his sights now set on Louise, stabs the jealous Ruby and throws her body off a cliff.

But Tony isn't the only one interested in Louise. With the monster psychically calling to her, she wanders into the woods. When Rick discovers that she's not in the house, he goes looking and finds her in a pond just out of the reach of the mutant, which seems to be afraid of the water. When Rick fires his rifle at the mutant, he discovers that it's bullet proof, and he is also forced to take refuge in the pond. Just then, it begins to rain for the first time since the war. Immediately the monster begins to cringe, and it quickly dies. Louise tells Rick that, for some strange reason, she feels sorry for the mutant. And since it ""spoke"" only to her, viewers are left wondering if the monster was in fact Louise's fianc! At any rate, as Rick and Louise return to the house, Tony plans to kill Rick so that he can have the girl for himself. At the last moment though, Jim, lying on the couch with a fatal case of radiation poisoning, pulls a hidden pistol and kills Tony. Afterwards, Rick, Louise, and Jim try to make sense of everything that's recently happened. Jim says of the monster, That thing was created to live in a poisoned world. The rain came, and it was pure. Louise: Man created it, but God destroyed it. He brought the rain and the fresh air. Moments later, Jim dies, leaving only Rick and Louise. The final scene shows the couple healthy and smiling as they hike out of the valley arm-in-arm, a post nuclear holocaust Adam and Eve.

Of all the nuclear-war films that have been made, it would be hard to find one that is more explicitly religious than ""Day the World Ended."" As my synopsis indicates, while the story acknowledges that humans are responsible for the event that brings them to near extinction, it also firmly places this event under the sovereign power of the God of the Christian Bible. Likewise, the end clearly asserts that humanity's ability to survive and even flourish in a newly-cleansed world is also the result of the providential care of this God. To underscore all of this, midway through, the movie includes a Bible reading. In the previous scene, Jim and Rick wander through the woods. The men are perplexed by Radek's strange behavior and by the question of what the fallout might have done to the environment. Jim asks his new friend, ""What can we do, Rick?"" An earlier scene revealed that Rick's brother, who was instantly killed in the nuclear attack, was planning to become a minister. Rick replies to Jim's question, My brother believed that the Bible gave strength and revealed a plan for everything. Jim responds, Then I hope I find it before I lose my mind. Back at his home, Jim holds a Bible and reads to the group:

. . . for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the Lord. And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible (Jeremiah 15:20b-21).

This raises a number of unanswered questions. Why has Jim made his way to the end of Jeremiah 15? Who does he assume that ""the wicked"" and ""the terrible"" might be? What sorts of applications is the viewer expected make? My last question leads back to Lou Rusoff, the author of the screenplay. But it's really not that complicated. According to the story, Jim just happens to have found and read a passage that promises him--or at least his descendants through Louise--eventual rescue from radioactive monsters and nuclear fallout, not to mention Tony. Yes, it is a greeting-card understanding of the Bible. It's also a very popular approach in Christian history and American culture.

In these ways, then, ""Day the World Ended"" assumes the existence and benevolent care of the God of the Christian Bible. Consequently, in this movie although humanity is responsible for World War III and the near extinction of life on Earth, the providence of God ensures that there are survivors. It also provides for a natural cleansing of the planet so that survivors then have the prospect of repopulating the world.

2520099,2,B000EHSVJG,"Spoiler warning...sort of

""The Day the World Ended"" from 1955 is a low-budget production signed Roger Corman. Who else? A diverse group of people are trying to cope with nuclear war, mutants and each other, isolated in a remote house in the woods. One of the newcomers turns out to be a gangster, while another is slowly turning into an evolutionary novelty, complete with three eyes and really huge claws... Well, you get the picture.

Since ""The Day the World Ended"" was done before the sexual revolution, the most we see of sex is a ""classical"" scene with two women bathing in old fashioned swimsuits which show very little, while The Monster is spying on them. There is also a ""striptease"" with very little stripping!

The gangster is shot at the end, all radioactivity is washed away by the rain, and so is the zombified monster-man (!). The heroes get in touch with other survivors by ham radio, and we can all start over again. Until the next cyclical Kali Yuga, I suppose. For, according to our man Corman, ""the end is the beginning"".  Not *as* bad as I supposed, but hardly a good movie either. Only two stars.",1389916800,,1120,4.613065326633166

This guy did not understand the hard scrabble history of American International or how that adds to the enjoyment of films like this for boomers. Indeed, he had trouble differentiating between a studio film and that of an independent. In other words, CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON has a much better costume and they are both black and white. Had he not been driving at the time, I might have strangled him! Roger Corman did more with less more often than anyone in the 1950's. This film is the best B picture of the decade besides Corman's use of telepathy; much in the manner of old radio, you can turn off the picture and the dialog will scare you to death.

With such B-grade material not warranting a full blown tinsel covered release there are still some things that can be done to make the punters want to buy it. I found the lack of subtitles a concern and although The She-Creature has closed captions they are incompatible with most if not all modern digital TVs so subtitles are preferable.  Of greater concern is the presentation in 1.33:1 full screen when both movies were shot in 2.00:1 and 1.85:1 respectively.  At least present these flicks the way they were shown in the cinemas before homes had TVs.

I picked this up for $8.00 which is what it's worth however I wouldn't pay the normal $14 for this release.

This is however the only release on DVD so beggars can't be choosers and at least the 2 movies are now on digital format even if in louse full screen. Purists should look out for a widescreen version in the future.

It's kind of fun to whatch these old monster flicks and see just how corny some of them are. Over all it isn't bad but the monster outfit realy needed some improvments. Given the date of this movie, I guess it isn't that bad but it could have been better. To bad that Stan Winston wasn't available back then. The most corny thing about the monster is the hands. More time should have been allouted for the hands used by the actor.

O well' I guess we can't have everything. Even so the movie is fun to whatch and laughable. It is kind of cool and the few bucks it sells for may just give you a fun time. It's listed as ""Super Scope"" which is a form of Cinema Scope but by a different company. Super Scope was in compatition with ""Cinema Scope"" which is a Twentyeth Century Fox photographic medium, but not invented by Twentyeth Century Fox. Super Scope didn't last very long but ""Cinema Scope"" is still in use today as Anamaphoric. As I have said in other revews, the 1.85 to 1 aspect ratio is a phony wide screen process. ""Cinema Scope"" is 2.35 to 1 Anamaphoric.

My IQ burgeoned fifteen points to almost three figures after viewing these cinematic masterpieces. I was even able to converse with my wife in more than my customary monosyllables after absorbing the erudite film scripts.

In retrospect, I and a buddy (Bob) took in the neuron-stimulating ""Day The World Ended"" at a showcase theater during our high school days in Coral Gables, Florida (yes, a few moons ago). When the actor Paul Dubov showed up at Maddison's (Paul Birch's) sequestered ranch house with a badly radiation-exposed physiognomy, Eddie Haskell-like-mentality Bob blurted out ""Old Omelet-Face has arrived!"". The theater's usher quickly appeared and we almost got eighty-six'd. A moment to remember about a great movie. ""Touch"" (aka Michael) Connors as bad-guy ""Tony"" was particularly impressive as a manic (not Mannix) hood intent on bad deeds. Adele Jergens supplied the almost mandatory (in not a few Roger Corman films) hootchy-coochy dance numbers. Again, a classic non-stop scientific thriller.

As for ""The She-Creature"", an aged Chester Morris as a hypnotist (not exactly reprising his 1940's B-movies role as Boston Blackie) almost put us under... but we came to in time to appreciate the profundity of this study in evil-intentioned mesmerism.

2520135,4,B000EHSVJG,"The day the world ended is a film I saw late at night and found it one of the most frightening I had ever seen, to the extent that I had nightmares about it and remembered scenes from it for the 45 years since I first saw it.  The plot:  a survivalist with experience - observations of horrible mutations after the H-Bomb explosion in the Pacific - has built a house protected by lead deposits and natural ridges.  But there is a kink in his plan:  a group of uninvited guests show up.  With only enough food for himself, his daughter, and her missing fiancee, the danger of hunger increases tension between the group that includes a scientist and a crook with his stripper babe.  But the scariest part is a man who survived in mutated form, with silvery atomic skin, who can walk through the radioactive mist to the outside world in search of the raw meat he craves, where, he assures the scientist, ""wonderful things are happening, but you will all die.""  The mutated man returns at night because he has enemies on the outside.  All the residents are unsure whether or not they will become like that man with the radiation that is sure to come with the next rains.

This kind of thing - of a infection from radioactive contamination that causes irreversible mutation - absolutely terrified me.  There is one scene where a man emerges from the mist with clawed hands and three-toed feet, weeping from hunger because ""the stronger ones"" won't share their hunts with him. He became an image of feverish nightmare for me.  Meanwhile, the daughter keeps hearing someone call to her, perhaps her missing fiancee, a presence who comes ever closer to the house.  Though she has fallen for the scientist, she feels somehow beholden to the mysterious creature, who when revealed is (admittedly rather campily) monstrous and invulnerable until the scientist realizes that it fears the uncontaminated.

This is really great fun and brought me back to my childhood terror of nuclear holocaust.  Radiation was such a mysterious thing then.  The acting is also unusually good for low budget scifi of the 50s, with Connors (or Minnix) as the thuggish tough, but also Denning, who was in many 60s TV shows.  Just this film is well worth the price of the dvd.  It is by far my favorite of the Corman legacy.

The other film, she-creature, is so ridiculously bad that I simply couldn't get through it, but then, I tried watching after the great Corman film.",1302480000,4,2440,4.674473067915691

I think the fault lies with Roger Corman, who always shot ""on the cheap"". Many many of his movies were shot full screen and then matted for theaters at 1:85.  DTWE is actually an original aspect ratio of 2.00 to 1, but it appears to be a true 2 to 1, since there was never a full screen print out there previously that shows a full screen image.  Another Corman movie, Kitten with a Whip, was also originally 2.00 to 1, but MGM put out a full screen vhs that was true full screen, as the dvd that came later was just that previous print remastered and matted, which lost information on the top and bottom.  I'm sure Lions Gate would have loved to put it out at 1:85, but they probably found that, while the original aspect ratio was in between the two favorite aspect ratios, the 2:35 produced the best result, overall, which is to say that neither would have been exactly true to the original apsect ratio, and I don't know of any dvd company that presents any movie at 2:00 to 1.",1295136000,3,1105,4.323671497584541

2520139,1,B000EHSVJG,"There are many films that would qualify for the list of all time worst, (1972's ""Asylum of Satan"" would be a superb candidate!) This film, however, beggars disbelief.

The career of Chester Morris is (like Rudy Vallee's singing), is one of the great mysteries of the entertainment industry. Utterly devoid of discernible acting talent, utterly devoid of charm, he managed, nevertheless, to put to service a jutting jaw, a permanent scowl and an inflexion-less voice in a long motion picture career.

That career, was largely over by the time ""She Creature"" was made, as were the careers of co-stars, Tom Conway, and Freida Inescourt.

The resulting film, is a mish-mash of re-incarnation, hypnotism and ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"" tropes against production values of ludicrous poverty, (the ""wealthy"" Tom Conway inhabits a beach side home where the paste board interior walls boast sparkle chips, making his office etc. look like the inside of a 1958 Los Angeles Savings and Loan).

Not to mention, that the script makes absolutely no sense, the dialog is embarrassing, the acting, (by all concerned, though Lance Fuller comes off best) abysmal, and the whole thing is ponderously dull.

No one on the production team seems to have had any idea of what they were doing, (many scenes are under-lit and actors routinely block out the key light of the player with whom they are playing the scene).

The final sequence depicts Lance Fuller and Marla English in a nighttime, moon lit garden, where, (absolutely no kidding here) they both cast their shadows on the cyclorama behind them ! You get the general idea. And unlike a bad film redeemed by campiness, (such as one featuring Acquanetta) this has no redeeming qualities.

One can only imagine what people like Inescourt thought making this. Given the hypnosis theme here, perhaps she and Conway were hypnotized into believing that it was still the 30's and that they were still at Warner Brothers.

These movies are true ""creature features"" and the creatures are the only reason to watch them. Were it not for the brilliant work of Paul Blaisdell these two turkeys would be nearly unwatchable.
The Day the World Ended is a well worn plot of survival after a nuclear holocaust filled with stock characters in stock cicumstances acting(?) in a stock manner. These were great drive-in movies because you really didn't miss anything by not watching until the end of the movie when the ceature finally makes his appearance and by then it was time to come up for air anyway. Unfortunatly this was not one of Blaisdell's best creations.
However, The She Creature is one of Blaidell's best and makes it worthwhile to endure the rest of the movie. The plot is best described as Bridey Murphy meets the Creature from the Black Lagoon and indeed the She Creatures design is often compared to that of the gill man. This comparison holds up well in still photographs, but when the two are shown moving, the paucity of Blaisdell's budget becomes all too apparent. One can only wonder what Blaisdell could have done had he had a decent budget to work with. The She Creature along with the big headed invaders from Invasion of the Saucer Men are two iconic creations of Blaisdell that he did on virtually no budget. We all owe Paul a debt of gratitude for making these low budget stinkers a lot more watchable.

I won't re-hash what previous reviewers have said, but Paul Birch was later used in Corman's BEST film, ""Not of This Earth"", which is, pitiably, not available on DVD or VHS. It is a thought-provoking film, so typical of the paranoia regarding the bomb back in he 50's, but the script by Lou Rusoff will not insult your intelligence. It's a film all sci-fi aficianados should have in their collection.  ""Day the World Ended"" is paired with ""The She-Creature"", which is a typical 50's  horror exploitation film, but isn't all that bad. Certainly, production values are low, but there's Lance Fuller (the bad Brack from ""This Island Earth"") looking handsome and concerned, as well as newcomer Marla English (gorgeous) and the reliable Tom Conway and Cathy Downs. Perhaps a trend-setter, a reliable old actor of the past, Chester Morris, plays the oily hypnotist. Directed by horror schlock veteran Edward L. Cahn, it's worth a look. One thing that was silly is that the cover art & posters showed the monster with huge breasts, rather daring for 50's sensibilities, but no such breasts appear in the film.

Let's focus on ""Day the World Ended"".  Snubbed at the Oscars, for whatever unfathomable reason, Rick Denning's performance was both sanguine and superb.  Paul Birch as the weathered rancher with a plan, not to mention a loaded Colt 45, commands respect.  Vincent Price must have secretly seethed when exposed to this level of persona and gravitas.  In his most secret of hearts he no doubt cried, realizing he would never be able to match what Mr. Birch was laying down.

Good copy, clean video, and some nice extras.

Step over Forbidden Planet, Star Wars sue for peace, and ET should just stay home if any of them try to stack up against ""Day the World Ended"".

They will not stand a chance.
Resistance was futile, but in every radioactive mutant's life...a little rain must fall.",1522713600,,959,4.7696969696969695

8110000,5,B000EHSVJG,"I have been looking for these movies for years and I was thinking they might be out of print. Then these two gems showed up. Yes, they were pricey but if you are a collectors of these old films, like me, then they were worth the price. The sound and picture quality was good on the one I received. These were great old movies.",1515369600,,326,4.109375
8110001,5,B000EHSVJG,"After the Atomic destruction a hand full of people find them selves in a valley that escaped the initial radiation. Naturedly the mix is of innocent and not so innocent women and men. This is not just any valley it was especially picked by a survivalist that expected the big one to be dropped and scoped out a valley with lots of lead around them.

Slowly encroaching on them is a strange mutant that has physic powers. Like the mutated monkeys on the atoll where they tested the bomb, this is probably the new generation of people replacements. Luckily he (it) still has a hankering for blonds in swimsuits.

There is also the possibility of contaminated rain bringing radiation to the valley.

One of the fun scenes in this Rodger Corman movie is when they throw a dummy off the cliff and you are supposed to believe it is a blond.",1506643200,10,834,4.509933774834437
8110002,5,B000EHSVJG,"I am a fan of the 1950 horror movies and had no problem adding this to my library of Cinema.  I always enjoy the special effects for the time.
No matter how hokey the FX (special effects) script or cinematography,or music.  Ah yes, the music put them all together and then I wonder why
as a child this era of cinema frighten me so as child.",1500336000,,340,4.136363636363637
8110003,3,B000EHSVJG,"This is funny at times, but worth a look.  See how special effects started out back in the day.  Mike Conners makes a rare appearance as a bad guy.  Well done there.",1487203200,,165,4.09375
8110004,4,B000EHSVJG,"Both of these 1950's horror films (one is sci-fi, the other supernatural)  succeed in their purpose of creating a really creepy atmosphere for their storylines, enhanced by classic black-and-white photography. The monsters are well done and add to the menace.",1484438400,,259,5.475

8110006,5,B000EHSVJG,"I love Day the World Ended, starring Richard Denning.
But then, I love old science fiction with a hero, a pretty girl who helps him save the world.
In this case, it's too late to save the world, but not too late for a hero to save the girl and live in a grand new future.
But then, I'm a sucker for old movies, like ""Them"", ""War of the Worlds"" the old one, ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" with Michael Rennie, etc.
So, I may not be the one to ask on this old movie. I just love the old sci-fi goodies, black and white or color.
Try it. You might love it, as I do.",1461369600,,563,3.8205128205128207
