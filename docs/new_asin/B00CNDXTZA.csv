8583744,5,B00CNDXTZA,Great film! It has some awesome footage of the Hlio Oiticica's Parangols and Maria Bethnia.  The film gives a great feeling for the context of the Tropicalismo movement and it's intersection between creative practices.,1518134400,,218,5.411764705882353

8583748,1,B00CNDXTZA,WARNING: for people in the US this DVD will not play on your standard DVD players. The copy I received was for Region 2 (Europe) and would not play on my devices (Region 1). I will be returning the product,1419897600,,205,4.15
8583749,3,B00CNDXTZA,"I would give it more stars but my pourtugese is not good and I was not given the option for subtitles. I feel very sure that any video released would give me that option, not to mention that the description was written in English, I kinda figured it a fair assumption that it would have English subtitles. I was wrong. $4 mistake, not the end of the world.
With that said, I was happy to see that amazon had it, though felt a bit let down.",1390953600,,439,4.116279069767442
