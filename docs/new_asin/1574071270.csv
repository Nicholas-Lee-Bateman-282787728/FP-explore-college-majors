7798611,1,1574071270,"Mixed messages, politics, creepy rhetoric. Naughty behavior is caused by government overreach? Lots of destructive children. Children who vandalize a church and destroy things in public in broad daylight. Angry Santa yelling at the one man who believes in him. What kind of whacko wrote this script and who thinks this is a good movie for children to watch? It's not written for children. The opening is odd news articles which children can't read. Later I thought it was a coming of age story about an elf and that maybe it was aimed at teens. But in the end it seems aimed at a small and select group of parents who can go along with the blah blah and who don't mind showing their children questionable movies.",1504915200,4,712,4.6141732283464565

7798613,2,1574071270,This movie is warped. On some parts it says really good things about Jesus being the real meaning of Christmas and how her parents taught her the real meaning. Then on other parts it says can't we celebrate both Santa and Jesus and makes out Santa to be real and lumps them together. It has a good meaning saying how the government makes parents scared to dicipline their kids so the kids are getting more naughty but saying they need santa to encourage them to be good. ahhhhhh it is just weird.,1387065600,4,496,4.4021739130434785
7798614,4,1574071270,Pop the popcorn. throw a log on the fire. Set your fault finding aside. You won't have to cover your kids eyes or ears and you can simply get lost in a story about a little girl trying to get her hometown back on track of being nice to each other. I have spent 8 bucks in the theaters lots of times for drivel and crass humor. This film is fun and tho not winning any Oscars the cast of amatures brings a message of hope into your home. You could do worse with your evening. You could do much worst to your family at most of the currently playing films out today. Summerime Christmas is a work of love.,1326412800,2,602,4.025
7798615,1,1574071270,"Poor acting.  Poor storyline.  Dumb.  Dumb.  Dumb.  Tries to relate Santa to God in a very weird way (of course).  In the end, parents who confirm to their child that Santa isn't real (Jesus is the real reason for the season) end up believing in Santa.  It is nice to see a family pray together, etc., but everything else is awful.",1324166400,3,331,4.327868852459017
