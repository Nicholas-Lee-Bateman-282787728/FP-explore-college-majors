8709275,5,B00V5GC3TO,"Jerry Wilson's review is spot on. The video is clear, concise, revealing and motivating. It's worth viewing multiple times and sharing Emeka's wisdom and influence with others. If the price seems too high, an audio version is offered at a lower cost. It's worth the extra money to see Emeka and the images he uses to convey his message. ALSO, if you're not familiar with him, check him out for free on Facebook or YouTube so you can get an impression of how beautiful and positive this man is.",1432598400,,493,4.550561797752809
8709276,5,B00V5GC3TO,"I recieved this DVD in the mail today and put this in My Computer Immediately. This was exactly what I need to listen to on a regular basis. Emeka Is straight to the point, The DVD is only 24 mins long with great bonus footage at the end. I would recommend this to anyone who is working towards being great at anything in life. I am a 2 time Iraq war Veteran, Married with 6 children. I allow the fact that Im married with 6 Children hold me back on the things I really want to do. Sometimes we need to hear someone tell you, you can make these things happen. Great DVD",1428710400,,569,4.04424778761062
