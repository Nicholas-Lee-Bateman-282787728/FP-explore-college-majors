7316353,5,B010SDQ98K,"Armed with one of the best written scripts in recent years by Juhi Chaturvedi,  Piku has been directed by Shoojit Sircar, who somehow  has the knack of picking uncommon themes and turning them into movie magic, case in point - Vicky Donor.
Piku is about parents and children. Particularly children who are taking care of their parents, as they watch them getting old and can never quite come to grips with that fact. Parents who become the focus of their life and cause them to stop paying attention to their own existence and paralyzed by it. Such is life....
This movie is much more than the bonds of family and certainly more than a father - daughter relationship showcase as the central theme. It hits so many other  notes , nostalgia,love, memories and constipation....
 I had several reservations about a film that was primarily based on going to the toilet for bowel problems but I was blown away right from the start and sucked in to the Banerjee household.
Bhaskor Banerjee ( Bachchan) is the crotchety old man whose life revolves around his own issues, mostly imaginary age related ones,  who has relegated every conversation and talking points to bowel movements. While he is not a burden, he adds stress and drama and the occasional embarrassment to his daughter Piku ( Deepika Padukone) at every possible turn. He is callous when he tells a possible suitor that she is not a virgin so that they would run away from her. It is almost impossible to handle a parent like that and that too when your parent is a shade of what they used to be. Their aging reminds you of the fragility of life and makes you mad that there is nothing that you can do to help them ease their discomfort.
Torn between her helplessness and inability to stay focused in life and creating a family of her own, Piku is slowly turning into  a tantrum queen with strangers and business associates. Piku indulges her father once more by  taking a road trip to Calcutta from Delhi. It would have been easier by plane but her dad insists that they do this by road.
But Rana ( Irfan) is the driver and the much needed intervention that both Bhaskor Banerjee and Piku need on this road trip. I cannot imagine the film without him. He is balanced and add an uniqueness that only an actor of this class can bring. Any other performer would have gotten lost in the crowd but he adds mellowness and takes the film on a unique turn.
The road trip from Delhi to Calcutta is an eye opener for all three of them as they all realize the importance of life, love and the steady hand of love, parenting and discovering that building relationships with our children is important.
Amitabh Bachchan rides away to even greater glory in this wonderful movie about a road trip. He is pitch perfect in his Bengali accent, perhaps channeling all those early years that he spent in Calcutta as a struggling actor in theater. He is just amazing after a long, long time. I missed you.
Then there is Deepika as Piku, her obedience and constant yielding to her parent who refuses to relent was a hard role. However she manages to add sensitivity and the sudden aggressiveness when she explodes at the world. You will love the way she gradually changes and becomes more peaceful when Rana enters her life.
This amazing tribute to aging parents and lovely children is heart wrenching and hopeful. I think this is one of the top ten films of the year.  Release date: May 8th, 2015",1437004800,10,3430,4.565853658536585

That the wonderful Deepika Padukone, Amitabh Bachchan and Irrfan Khan ended up in this movie was quite a waste of their talent. I suppose some will like it. She was constantly complaining, he was constantly going on with his sickening aliments or hypochondria (don't watch this while eating dinner), he didn't shine like he usually does. Family conflict, nothing special, nothing beautiful. I give it 3 stars simply for the actors, otherwise it would be 2.",1465603200,2,534,4.815217391304348

7316365,2,B010SDQ98K,This movie is about poop. Seriously 90% of the dialog is about constipation.,1452988800,,76,4.923076923076923
7316366,3,B010SDQ98K,"This was a weird experience for me. While I don't know much about Indian culture at all (I'm pretty much limited to the Bhagavad Gita), I've never seen a Bollywood movie, or any movie out of India for that matter. I only found out about Piku when doing a search on Tumblr and coming across a picture of Deepika Padukone, where I was immediately speechless. It turned out that she was in this movie, and I gave it a shot. It took a week and 3 sittings to get through it, but Piku isn't a terrible movie by any stretch; it's just very slow in narration and repetitive. It wasn't until the final 30 minutes that I finally started to care about one of the main characters, and when it was over, I didn't get any feeling of happiness or sadness- I just rated it and moved on with my day, not really thinking about it until I came to type this review. I -guess- I can see how some people may really like it, but for me, it's just too plain. Like, to the point where it actually hurts the movie. No chances were taken with anything here. It feels like a made for tv movie that could've been something special if given to the right director or with more to the script.

Piku is a young woman who works an office job and takes care of her father at home. He's getting up there in years, but still functions and gets through his day without a lot of difficulty except for in one category- his bathroom habits. The poor guy suffers from terrible constipation and has tried everything in the book to help with his bowel movements. As a result, he's getting more and more cranky, accusing people of petty things and states the obvious over and over, where even when someone knows his point, he'll turn it around and start up a whole other point. We've all been on the receiving end of one of those conversations before. Piku is having trouble juggling everything, since the stress has mad her irritable and causes her to scream at the men who drive her to work, so much so that no one wants to drive her any more. Her love life isn't doing too hot either, and she's taking calls from her dad while in meetings about what he can do to help with his problem. Eventually, they decide to take a trip to their old family home, after the owner of the driving company, Rana, gives in and takes them when no one shows up for the trip. It's a long journey there, with frequent stops. Very few people would have the patience to be in a car with Piku and her dad for even an hour with how much they argue.

Piku could fall into the road trip movie category, since the majority of the 'action' takes place on the road. The entire portion of the movie leading up to the trip could be used to establish the characters, but there's not much to them, and we essentially ""get"" them within a few minutes of being introduced to each one. Piku is a busy woman whose life is going nowhere, her dad Bhaskor talks about constipation 95% of the time (seriously), Rana clearly has a crush on Piku but is old enough to be her father and to me he never came off as sincerely being interested, and the other characters are just kinda there. Occasionally, when Bhaskor isn't talking about his problem, he'll throw a nice bit of dialogue out there, sometimes about marriage, yet it's nothing that deep. Plot summaries for this movie make it sound a lot more meaningful than it really is. The truth is that you could cut at least 30 minutes out of the film and pretty much have the same thing with way less filler. Aside from the nice moments in the last 30 minutes, I will say that you can get a good glimpse of the Indian culture here.

One thing that severely bothered me though, was the dialogue. As I said earlier, I haven't seen any movies from India before, so I don't know if this is the norm, but how they talk is very strange to me. Watch the official trailer for a good example, but if you can't, most of the characters here will speak a line of their dialogue in English, and then the next line will be in Hindi. Like, back-to-back, without anyone cutting in. Other times, they'll have a line with say, 10 words in it, and 4 words will be in Hindi while the other 6 will be in English, when they have the Hindi equivalent of those words! I couldn't figure out why they were doing this, and it was very distracting. Look, I'm not one of those people who complains about subtitles, but it threw me off when they're speaking English half the time to each other, then going into Hindi, then a combination of both. I work in a building with a lot of people from India, and when I pass them by while they're talking to one another, I've never heard them talk like they do in Piku.

I can't say that I didn't like Piku, but I don't like it either. It's a very vanilla movie without any key scenes to make it stand out. Again, apart from the last 30 minutes when one of the characters finally has some character (and brings up a very good point about dying while on life support), there's nothing here that makes me want to recommend it to anyone. At a little over 2 hours long, there are better movies out there, especially road trip ones. For a cute one with weird characters and situations but also a lot of heart, check out Kikujiro. Piku has a gorgeous leading lady, some beautiful scenery here and there, and a few lines of good dialogue near the end. That's about it. And if hearing about things like constipation turns you off, you need to leave this page immediately and delete this movie from your memory. I wish that one had more to it, like better interactions between Piku and Bhaskor. Maybe it'll be remade in 10 years with more of a point.",1452988800,,5614,4.293396226415094

There was room to make the characters deeper; they all stay mostly one-dimensional.  But, considering the topic, the movie is surprisingly more than watchable, no question thanks to the director's skills and well-selected actors.  I did not care much for the unnecessarily nervous tone and pacing of the movie throughout though.  The raised voices rarely calm down and even when they do, the director continues using different-angle cuts every couple of seconds to keep the viewers on their toes.

This was a study of parent/child relationships and family dynamics, which, regardless of taking place in India or Wisconsin, anyone that is part of a traditional or non-traditional family can relate. Amitabh Bachchan is a superlative actor. He doesn't miss a comic timing beat. Deepika Padukone as a put-upon daughter was wonderful as was Irrfan Khan, the plain-spoken business-owner/browbeaten member of another dysfunctional family. The entire supporting cast are memorable. And, if you've never traveled to India, this is an opportunity to see the shifting landscapes of crowded Delhi roads to Calcutta. Anyone taking care of elderly family members should watch this movie, because, like raising children from babies to adulthood, it all goes by like the blink of an eye.

Amitabh Bachan is not just an icon, I think he is the current spiritual living icon for the whole country , and his performance shows that it is well deserved. Deepika Padukone is a fierce actress with perhaps the most beautiful smile in all of the wide world wide of show business ,she also has serious acting chops. But, the glue that keeps it all together for me , was Irrfhan Khan, who I have seen in other movies ,however he somehow keeps this continual assault of gastric disturbances from becoming too silly and maudlin. Somehow he projects an extraordinary depth and wonderment at this daughter father relationship which is truly hilarious. A comic gem behind a wide eyed observor. He also somehow holds the humanity of the whole work in the palm of his hand , connecting each character to one another in a way that otherwise , I do not think a lesser actor could havd done.

7316431,5,B010SDQ98K,"Not your typical Bollywood fare. Does it have an actual story? Not really. You get to watch the characters unfold under certain circumstances. Irrfan and AB dazzle (no surprise), but Deepika! Never expected her to hold her own next to those two, but she does, extremely well! You want to give her a hug, shake her, and hide from her, all at the same time! Any one who has grown up with grandparents will watch this movie with great fondness- The kind that comes from the thousand little irritants being far enough away in the past for you to see them as being amusing eccentricities. The movie flows- It's effortless watching. My only grouse with this and every other Indian movie: Please hire decent translators. The kind that know the difference between a weekend meal and a vegan meal. The kind who can use proper grammar and spelling. There will be a lot lost in translation: Basic grammar and spelling should not be.",1440547200,3,921,4.656441717791411

7316446,4,B010SDQ98K,"""Piku"" is surprisingly different from the average Bollywood movie. Soojit Sircar impresses again after ""Vicky Donor"". In ""Vicky"" the Delhi Punjabi vs. Delhi-Bengali dynamic was used to highlight differing attitudes towards sperm donation. In ""Piku"" it is used to induce comic (and gastric) relief.

Amitabh is delightful as an obdurate all knowing caricature of an older Bengali gentleman. You forget that he's Amitabh and very quickly begin to bristle at his character's antics. Irfan puts in another solid performance as a Delhi native who is perplexed by the father daughter dynamic and exhibits minor resentment and self pity. Deepika also carries her role as a frustrated, frustrating and yet loving daughter torn between living her life and living for her father.",1438992000,6,769,5.355371900826446

7316451,5,B010SDQ98K,"The legendary Amitji, talented Deepika and the charisma personified Irrfan. All in one movie, arey vah!
This is quite possibly their best work yet, and I have seen a number of their work. Piku, on the surface is a movie is about constipation, Bhashkorji's challenge (Amitabh Bachchan); yet its underlying theme is one that resonates with everyone, dealing with not only the aging of our parents but our own mortality. I'm getting a double dose in my personal life with aging parents-in-law as well as parents, and let me tell you that I thought I was patient until now. Over time I have learnt that they can't help it, as the parents themselves come to grips with the aging process. And that is why I love this movie, the storyline manages to capture the points of view of Piku, the child, Bhashkor, the parent and Rana, the outsider looking in- with such impressive balance. The scenes and cinematography are breathtaking, especially in Kolkata. The scenes slowly seep into you and the storyline tugs at your heart string, at your own volition. You find yourself falling in love with each character because of their flaws, rather than despite them. I absolutely recommend this movie again and again. One of the best movies of the year.",1438473600,6,1236,4.780373831775701

8723106,1,B010SDQ98K,"From the DVD cover I thought this was going to be a fun Indian road trip movie, but it's not. Basically the movie revolves around a 30 year old woman who for the first part of the movie is hated by numerous taxi drivers since she is rude to them and insists they speed and other things which results in a lot of crashes. She has an elderly 70 year old father who is just a selfish, sexist, rude, man with self entitlement issues. He treats his daughter like a slave and demeans some other guy who I guess is hired to be his assistant or something throughout the whole movie. The cleaning lady quits, since he keeps accusing her of stealing, and follows her mopping the floor with dirty feet around the house. She tells the daughter she will only return when he is gone. The vile old man also has constipation issues which he likes to talk about. For some reason he is also pregnant, seriously he's wearing one of those fake pregnancy bellies, I don't get the joke of that as him being pregnant is never referred to by any character including himself in the movie. He decides to visit his own home on the other side of India but refuses to fly, catch a train, bus or anything sensible. His daughter books a taxi, but the driver doesn't show up and all other drivers don't answer their phones when the boss rings them, so the boss decides to drive them himself.

So the driver shares in the abuse and put downs along the journey there, but points out to the daughter this isn't acceptable behaviour and if she's waiting around for him to die before getting on with her life she'll be 50 by that point. Really the father is just so unlikable, such as at one point he says women are for the bedroom at night and cooking in the day. That pretty much sums him up. I know unfortunately there are people like this out there in the real world, but I don't really need to watch a character like this for two hours.

Annoyingly the movie itself takes four minutes to get going, before that we've got logo after logo for every company in India I would imagine, and then opening credits. There is no intermission of Bollywood dance numbers in this one, which you may see as a plus or a minus.",1496016000,,2179,4.31219512195122
