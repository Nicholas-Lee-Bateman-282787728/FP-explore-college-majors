Disk one begins with a top (I don't even remember what now) and you press play.  The person answering that topic tells about four or five sentences regarding that topic and the DVD brings you back to a list of topics and the insanity ensues.  I prefer a disk that I can put in my player and sit back and watch in relaxation.  By the format of the first DVD, you have to keep pressing play to go forward.  I don't know if the other two DVDs are any better, if they are let me know and I will try watching them.  I didn't make it through the first DVD before my frustration kicked in and had to turn it off and watch something I didn't have to press ""GO"" on after every five sentences.

4241661,1,B0041ETK2A,"For those who so vehemently rail against the 'intelligent design' concept, and in particular rebuttal to the respondent named ""Juscz,"" who so completely tries to portray the concept as hocus-pocus, yet puts forth evolution as a ""scientific"" explanation of the origin of life-- you don't seem to recognize that although you claim to be 'objective,' and claim only to accept science-based theories, you refute ID while having no evidence against it, and promote Darwinism as though it has been proven by the scientific method.
For the record, I know the this planet has taken millions, billions of years to become what it is; and I am aware that evolution is a fact- we've seen more than enough evidence of it. HOWEVER, Darwinian's claim that evolution is where life started is complete fantasy. There is ZERO evidence that evolution explains the origin of life on earth. None. So by your logic (to use the term loosely), evolution should not be allowed in a science classroom either, as an explanation of where life began. Your absolute insistence that Darwinism is a superior explanation for the origin of life on this planet shows you are biased by your worldview, at least as much as anyone else is. So the fight to keep ID out of classrooms is actually an endorsement of atheism-- NOT a neutral stance as you claim it to be. You can't call apples oranges when making a comparison. The ONLY 'fair' and genuinely scientific way to describe the origin of life in a classroom is to say ""we don't know.""

4241676,5,B0041ETK2A,"If I could select one video for students everywhere to see, this (three-part) video would be it.
At a time when the theory of Darwinian evolution is exclusively, blindly ascendant, The Intelligent Design Collectiona high-quality production narrated by a number of top-credentialed scientistscalmly and inexorably dissects the insufficiencies of a 19th-century theory whose scientific postulates are woefully inadequate in explaining both the origin of life (something Darwin never attempted, despite the title of his major opusOn the Origin of the Species) and its infinite variety.
As things are among the scientific establishment, any hint of questioning Darwinianism can ruin a scientific career. The top echelons of the scientific community are as blinkered to irrefutable scientific advances in the field as was the Catholic Church toward the new heliocentric theories of Copernicus and Galileo in their day.
But if Darwin were now here to see what progress scientists have made in understanding the wondrous intricacies of molecular biology, he doubtless would acknowledge that his theories about natural selection were quaintly outdated.
For as he said himself: ""If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down.""
Alas, as The Intelligent Design Collection shows, the If contingency Darwin spoke of has now been demonstrated, through a range of academic discoveries in biology, chemistry, biochemistry, geology, and astronomy.
We now know, for example, that all the tens of thousands of irreducibly complex cells functionin the words of molecular biologist Michael Dentonas micro-miniaturized factor[ies] containing thousands of exquisitely designed pieces of intricate molecular machinery, made up altogether of one hundred thousand million atoms, far more complicated than any machinery built by man and absolutely without parallel in the non-living world.""
Such a system, as biochemist Michael Behe demonstrated in Darwins Black Box (1996)and reiterates in these videoscould not have evolved slowly, piece by piece.
The three videos on offer hereDarwins Dilemma, Unlocking the Mystery of Life, and The Privileged Planetcomprise a compelling dismemberment of Darwinianism, for anyone with eyes to see.
The geological, biological, and biochemical evidenced presented here  persuaded even Professor Dean Kenyon an erstwhile, leading Darwinianto abandon his much-admired attempt, in Biochemical Predestination (1969), to explain how life might have originated as a result of chemical bonding between amino acids in proteins (even without specific genetic instructions) and become one of the leaders in the Intelligent Design (ID) movement.
If you're open to evidence concerning the origins and processes of life on earth, youll find these three videos incrementally, armingly persuasive.",1434758400,4,2930,5.861826697892272

I am intrigued by the debate between creationists and evolutionists, as both bring something to the table. It is worth hearing differing interpretations of the geographic, astronomic and historical evidence. I believe that the scriptures of the worlds religions have elements of truth that shouldn't be ignored.

It would seem to me that a 'true' scientist, whether secular or religious, should do their best to consider and weigh all evidence and be willing to go where the evidence leads. For if truth is what they seek, they should not be close minded or afraid to follow the crumbs to where they lead. Too many times I have heard both sides disregard each others arguments simply because it challenges their world views.

It seems the more the sciences uncover, the more complex and mysterious life becomes. If there is a divine creator or simply evolution void of one, evidence will continue to lead us in the direction of truth.

4241759,5,B0041ETK2A,"When rituals lost their meaning, many people threw out the deeper faith that inspired the rituals and apparently thought that denying God meant they had discovered the fraud of ""the man behind the curtain."" The Intelligent Design series addresses the questions of life and the universe head on, in a thoughtful, documented manner. By the end of Darwin's Dilemma, the blind faith in accidental creation and evolution as the sole driving force behind life falls apart just as surely as a priest's incantation. It's particularly telling to hear the Professor of Biology who actually wrote the textbook on evolution used by Yale come to the conclusion that what he had believed all his life could not stand up to hard questioning - and even more interesting that Yale, in a most unscientific spirit, refused to address those questions or let him change the book. Now THAT'S faith in an unproven doctrine.
  None of these three documentaries use the word ""God"" and they certainly don't promote any religion. What they clearly illustrate, step by step, in a truly scientific manner is that there is TRUE design in everything from the universe down to the functioning of a cell - and to have a design that works you have to have a designer. Evolution does not provide that answer. Darwin himself was quite aware of the Cambrian explosion and said ""I have no satisfactory answer.""",1365811200,3,1372,4.884120171673819

I enjoy science tremendously, but am classically under educated by the American public school system.  I am newly homeschooling a worn down 2nd grader who was thoroughly surprised by school keeping him out of our home from 8 am till 4:30 pm (as was I). We love homeschooling now!  He loves these documentaries...the graphics, photography and the discussion, but they are extremely complex for him. We only review together 10-15 minutes and discuss (I have viewed each of these documentaries numerous times with my spouse ...we agree the argument for Intelligent Design is consistent and very, very compelling).  We participate regularly in a regional homeschool group of mostly middle schoolers, who visit local state parks and fossil sites for hiking, observation, and sometimes quite formal presentations on anything geology and biology.  I could not answer, and nor could the presenters at universities and state parks, his questions about specifics he observed in the natural world in terms of evolution.  My son questions evolution and is pro God and Creation by special miracle.  I had no descent knowledge in either evolution or creationism....I'm a little old now, but wow, my son made me realize that I had never discussed or reviewed these concepts in my public school, my university, my church, with my parents or with friends...yikes!!  These DVDs are modern and well done.  They present a series of current leading scientists discussing their professional pursuits of research that have completely debunked evolution; one scientist has even renounced his own publication and is now in favor of ID. As if evolution needs to be debunked since there is not a single fossil record proving evolution and life in any perspective is so interrelated and complex... evolution cannot stand on a single concept.  Additionally, these programs provide the questions that Darwin, himself was troubled by and that he documented in his famous writings.  The Intelligent Design documentaries also include Darwin's own words of specific examples of evidence or conditions that would be needed to prove or disprove evolution. These scientists address many of those questions and required evidence.  This is a somewhat complex, abundant, and satisfying starting point for choosing one's further pursuits.

I've visited a few websites that harshly critique these films, and the majority of the criticism against these videos (particularly this video) is that they just present 'creationism' in disguise, and that they are not original material.  These critiques don't have much substance in my opinion.  Whether or not the videos are creationism in disguise has little to do with whether or not they are true, and I would also note that Darwin was not the original proponent of evolution.  Having said all of this, I don't believe anyone will be converted to Christianity (or even away from evolution) by an intellectual argument, so I wouldn't spend too much time trying to memorize every argument presented.  There will usually be a counterargument, which will have a counterargument, which will have another counter... etc.  Eventually, you have to make a decision on what to believe, based on faith, in either case.

For the record, I do NOT regard myself as an atheist.

Although I am a biologist by profession, allow me to make it clear that I do not like to try and defend evolution against the sorts of arguments posted by those coming from the intelligent design/creationist camp. This is because intelligent design/creationism (which certain individuals regard as a more viable explanation for the emergence of new species than the theory of evolution) does not constitute science. Thus, to even begin to defend evolution against intelligent design/creationism is to suggest that this allegedly alternate assertion, intelligent design/creationism (believed by some to be a better explanation than evolution for the emergence of new species), is a scientifically legitimate position. This sort of defence does a disservice to the evolution and, indeed, all of science.

First, here is, from the Dover trial, Judge Jones' (an avowed conservative Christian and appointed by then President George Bush [himself an intelligent design supporter] to preside over the Dover trial) final decision as to why intelligent design is simply another name for creationism (and hence a non-scientific assertion that should NOT be taught in the United States public school system); note that Judge Jones says that the validity of this decision should be, ""... readily apparent to an objective observer, adult or child."":

*****************************************************************************************
""For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the religious nature of ID [intelligent design] would be readily apparent to an objective observer, adult or child. (page 24)

A significant aspect of the IDM [intelligent design movement] is that despite Defendants' protestations to the contrary, it describes ID as a religious argument. In that vein, the writings of leading ID proponents reveal that the designer postulated by their argument is the God of Christianity. (page 26)

The evidence at trial demonstrates that ID is nothing less than the progeny of creationism. (page 31)

The overwhelming evidence at trial established that ID is a religious view, a mere re-labeling of creationism, and not a scientific theory. (page 43)

Throughout the trial and in various submissions to the Court, Defendants vigorously argue that the reading of the statement is not `teaching' ID but instead is merely `making students aware of it.' In fact, one consistency among the Dover School Board members' testimony, which was marked by selective memories and outright lies under oath, as will be discussed in more detail below, is that they did not think they needed to be knowledgeable about ID because it was not being taught to the students. We disagree. .... an educator reading the disclaimer is engaged in teaching, even if it is colossally bad teaching. .... Defendants' argument is a red herring because the Establishment Clause forbids not just 'teaching' religion, but any governmental action that endorses or has the primary purpose or effect of advancing religion. (footnote 7 on page 46)

After a searching review of the record and applicable caselaw, we find that while ID arguments may be true, a proposition on which the Court takes no position, ID is not science. We find that ID fails on three different levels, any one of which is sufficient to preclude a determination that ID is science. They are: (1) ID violates the centuries-old ground rules of science by invoking and permitting supernatural causation; (2) the argument of irreducible complexity, central to ID, employs the same flawed and illogical contrived dualism that doomed creation science in the 1980s; and (3) ID's negative attacks on evolution have been refuted by the scientific community. ...It is additionally important to note that ID has failed to gain acceptance in the scientific community, it has not generated peer-reviewed publications, nor has it been the subject of testing and research. Expert testimony reveals that since the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries, science has been limited to the search for natural causes to explain natural phenomena. (page 64)

The one textbook [Pandas] to which the Dover ID Policy directs students contains outdated concepts and flawed science, as recognized by even the defense experts in this case. (pages 86-87)

ID's backers have sought to avoid the scientific scrutiny which we have now determined that it cannot withstand by advocating that the controversy, but not ID itself, should be taught in science class. This tactic is at best disingenuous, and at worst a canard. The goal of the IDM is not to encourage critical thought, but to foment a revolution which would supplant evolutionary theory with ID. (page 89)""
*****************************************************************************************************

Now, before I go any further, I know that there will be those among you who will insist that alleged intelligent design and creationism are NOT equivalent terms.  The last time I checked, the Discovery Institute (which is the organization that produced these DVDs), I noted that it contends that intelligent design is NOT the same thing as creationism.

This is a lie (see Judge Jones' ruling above).

Remember, it is the Discovery Institute that produced this three-DVD 'Intelligent Design' set and they contend that intelligent design is a legitimate scientific assertion throughout this series.  Thus, I shall mostly address this general and most fundamental assertion in my review.

Indeed, please be informed that 'intelligent design' and 'creationism' are equivalent terms.  If you don't believe this, just watch the NOVA (for television)  production of the now famous Dover, Pennsylvania trial (science versus intelligent design) that aired on PBS about 4 years ago.  This program captures the gist of the Dover trial and shows why the conservative Christian judge (appointed by then President George W. Bush) ruled, at the trial's conclusion, that 'intelligent design' IS just another word for creationism (also note the dishonest manner by which the proponents of alleged intelligent design tried to cover up this fact; why does God need people to lie for Him?; do some folks think He is so weak?).

This conservative Christian judge also noted that, because it calls upon supernatural causation and also because it is NOT subject to falsification, 'intelligent design'/'creationism' cannot qualify as science.  Thus, the teaching of intelligent design/creationism in the public classroom is disallowed as it violates separation of church and state.

You can watch the NOVA program about the Dover trial on-line at the following link:

[...]

So why is intelligent design/creationism put forth in this 'Intelligent Design' three-DVD set not science (mind you, I am NOT saying that  it may not be true; rather, I am asserting the obvious; intelligent design cannot qualify as science because it does not meet certain criteria required for an assertion to be regarded as scientific in character)?

Simple.

Creationism asserts that, in the beginning, the God of the Bible called upon His alleged supernatural powers to will a material universe into existence out of nothingness. The Bible calls this a miracle (see first miracle of the Bible), which, by definition, is a supernatural act, and, hence, an act that should forever remain off limits to scientific/natural world-based understanding.

Supernatural acts are disallowed in scientific explanations. That is, by definition, a scientist cannot assert something akin to the following:

""And because we presently cannot find an adequate natural world-based explanation for the observed phenomena, this is proof that supernatural forces are at work and it is thus proof of the hand of the God of the Bible at work.""

No, a scientist can NEVER make such a claim and still call her/his assertion scientific in character (consider how we never would have discovered pathogens, such as bacteria and virsues, if we had simply assumed that all diseases were exclusively the result of the will of God).

Thus, a basic assumption of science is that natural forces (as opposed to supernatural forces/miracles) underlie all observed natural phenomena. To assume otherwise is to enter the realm of any number of theologies (Christianity being one of these) that allow for superntaural forces to be regarded as viable explanations for natural phenomena.

But theology is not science.

And before I go any further, allow me to assert that, for all anyone knows, intelligent design/creationism and its supernatural forces may be the ultimate truth with regard to explanations for the origins of species and life itself: but because this viewpoint calls upon supernatural forces it cannot, by definition, be regarded as science.

Thus, the responsibility is upon organizations such as the Discovery Institute (i.e., the folks who produced these intelligent design/creationism DVDs), to come up with a scientifically testable alternate explanation for the emergence of new species/evolution (please do not confuse evolution with abiogenesis, which is the emergence of the first living organisms on a planet; this is potentially an aspect of biology that does NOT constitute evolution [evolution being the emergence of new species from previously existing examples]).

Of course, IF intelligent design/creationism IS scientifically supported, this is in complete contradiction with what is arguably the most fundamental assertion of the Bible. Specifically, a natural world-based/scientific explanation of intelligent design/creationism (which, as per the Bible, asserts that all species were created in one day via God's willing them into existence) would indicate that God's alleged creation act was NOT a miracle/supenatural act.  This is so because biblical miracles, by definition, are off limits to natural world-based/scientific explanations.  Indeed, to remain miracles, they must forever be unexplainable via scientific/natural world-based means.  For this reason, I would think that anyone, as a Christian believer, would NOT want to regard creationism as an alternate scientific explanation to evolution for the emergence of new species.

Unlike theologies (such as Christianity) which profess to do so, science does not claim to KNOWINGLY put forth ultimate truths. In this sense, then, science never PROVES anything. Yes, you read that correctly. Science does not prove anything (despite the fact that we often hear, in popular media and such, things akin to, ""Scientists have proven..."").  Science either DISPROVES or, for the time being, FAILS TO DISPROVE some interpretation of how the natural world functions. In this sense, then, all scientific claims are held to be potentially wrong. Therefore, in science, we never say something akin to the following:

""And thus, this proves that thus and such was, is, and shall ever be, amen.""

No, that is the language of theologies that implore one to think without questioning, without doubting.

And yet doubt is the very cornerstone of the discipline of science (think of how the priest/minister/preacher does NOT encourage the congregation to doubt the existence of God; that stance is just NOT GOOD for the business of running the church).

So, to summarize, the Discovery Institute must do the following to have others take them seriously in what I assume is their quest to supplant evolutionary theory with creationism as a scientific explanation for the origin of species:

1) Present a testable model by which scientists can garner natural world-based experimental results (i.e., data) to show that species originated by the supernatural powers of the God of the Bible

2) Suggest hypothetical, natural world-based experimental data that would disprove intelligent design/creationism (evolution, for example, could be pretty much dismissed as a legitimate scientific theory if we could show, say, that mutations never occurred and what we thought was a mutation was really no change in the genome at all; to date, no such data have been found and thus evolution persists as a viable SCIENTIFIC explanation for the emergence of new species).

Thus, let the experiments that support this assertion of intelligent design BEGIN!  To date, no scientific data in support of this alleged intelligent design has ever been published in a peer reviewed scientific journal.

I will be happily proven wrong if one can demonstrate otherwise.  Indeed, there is the greatest Nobel prize waiting for the individual who can debunk evolution as a legitimate scientific assertion.  And if one can supplant evolution with an assertion (i.e., intelligent design/creationism) that is supernatural in character, then the scientific world will literally be turned on its ear as it will be necessary to REDEFINE science to include supernatural data in its explanations.

Mind you, my basic argument is as follows:

Intelligent design/creationism cannot pass for science because it calls upon supernatural forces, which are disallowed in science.

Again, I am NOT saying that this alleged intelligent design/creationism is NOT true (for all anyone knows, it may be the ultimate truth).  Rather, intelligent design/creationism CANNOT be considered science as it calls upon supernatural forces and is not subject to either scientific analysis or falsification.

I am not at all bothered by anyone asserting that her/his religion is the one true faith insofar as such an individual does this in a respectable-towards-others manner. But, as a biology educator and researcher, I am keenly aware of two things. First, evolution is an EXTREMELY useful and experimentally well-supported concept. It integrates the various disciplines of biology (think ecology, genetics, physiology, taxonomy, etc.) in a way that is completely consistent with experimental results. Secondly, evolution also enables those working in the medical field to develop new drugs to combat disease as pathogens evolve to become resistant to formerly effective drugs.

Programs such as these DVDs dumb down science education in the United States. Our nation now ranks 52nd in the world with respect to science and math education. The sort of pseudoscience asserted in these DVDs is a major reason for why this is occurring.

The fossil record looks nothing like Darwin's ""Tree of Life.""  Frankly, I have no idea why people get upset when difficulties are pointed out with Darwin's theory.  It's old, musty, Victorian stuff.  Just last week, some scientists observed neutrinos going faster than light.  If that is true, Einstein is due for some serious updating.  But nobody got all hot under the collar and screamed, ""You can't attack Einstein!""

The second DVD, ""Unlocking the Mystery of Life,"" deals with the incredible nanotechnology inside bacteria and human cells.  The computer animation alone is worth the price of admission.

The third DVD, ""The Privileged Planet,"" explores the tantalizing, uncanny relationship between Earth as a home of intelligent life, and Earth as an ideal platform for studying the universe.  As Einstein pointed out, ""The most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible.""

The DVDs are loaded with interesting information.

Today Evolutionary Theory is taught as dogmatic fact, despite it being built like a house of cards upon the simple scientific understanding and research data of Darwin's time. At the publication of Darwin's theory, it was assumed that as more time went on, the relatively new field of paleontology would soon uncover vast fields of intermediary, in-between forms, but that is not the case. We now have millions of well-documented fossilized lifeforms that are complete and discernible as to species, etc., with some most being identical to current lifeforms on earth or extinct lifeforms such as the dinosaurs. There are no fossil records anywhere on earth of billions and billions of transitional life forms necessary to evolution to prove it as fact, not theory.  And today we know that living cells are not merely simple protoplasmic black boxes that magically create order out of disorder and bring life out of unknown chemicals and their interactions, but incredibly complex, ordered micromachines and mechanisms that service the cells according to the stored information with in the DNA.

These videos illustrate that point in compelling illustrations and interviews with well qualified non-religious scientists  and  do a good job of highlighting some of the compelling evidence against the religion of evolution, for that is what it is, a belief system of cosmology for people to live without the need for a Creator. However, the incredible complexity and interdependency of all biosystems, be it predator and prey or reproductive diversity makes it difficult for a rational person to blindly believe in the evolutionary theory.",1502150400,6,2294,5.273972602739726
