8274167,4,B0019K4YNY,"Good short documentary that exposed a ""small""event in our history that really relates to the ""big"" issue of slavery. Slavery is still very emotional to us just a few generations hence and you can see it in many of the personalities in this film. I guess that is why we do not see enough history re. slavery in the Wester Hemosphere. The far ranging mix of personalities and characters here help tell a very interesting story. I wish more ""Projects"" such as this have the same attention as there are thousands of events and stories to be told.",1316563200,3,542,4.540816326530612
8274168,5,B0019K4YNY,"Wow...this was better than the theatrical production of ""Amistad"". ...cause it is all true and happening today.

A wonderful story of a white American woman not connected with academia or government who researched a long-forgotten story of the early 1800s ... a story with pirates, slaves, , treasure hunters, the early, struggling US Government and the bloated red-tape of today's Federal and State government (La Florida)when it comes to discovery and salvage of sunken ships.

A part of US and World history not typically taught in schools is well vetted in this film. The interesting stakeholders who appear on film seem sincere and motivated by truly higher-level motives. Very inspiring and emotionally touching when the description of conditions aboard the Guerrero and other slave ships are described.

Also a story of hope...of the almost 600 slaves being carried to Cuba illegally by Spanish pirates in 1827, 92 returned to Africa (albeit Liberia) as free men. America is full of hidden history...or what currently could be described as real mystery stories of our past.

Whatever your race or political bent...you will be fascinated by this film...a movie sourced from a past that should not be forgotten and enabled by regular , everyday people (though adventurous ones).

Buy this film...you will not be disappointed.",1316217600,8,1330,5.254716981132075
