Anyway the whole DVD is too superficial but I enjoyed it anyway.",1060819200,4,121,4.304347826086956
7929473,3,B000051S7A,"This is a solid, well produced 52 minutes of dialog on the life and origins of Marilyn Horne.  Fans of the great diva will enjoy this chatty glimpse into her early years, and it is always interesting to view Ms Horne at her informal best, laughing at things that few of us are fortunate enough to have experienced. Those who want to hear her fabulous mezzo-soprano voice put through its rather formidable paces will be greatly disappointed, however, as there is not a single complete song or aria anywhere on this disc.  There are many two-minute snippets of Ms Horne singing, and you get a glimpse of what is surely one of the two or three greatest voices of this century.  But you never get to hear anything complete, start to finish, which seems a terrible waste.  Surely 20 minutes of Ms Horne in recital could have been added to flesh out this disc.  That said, buy this disc and enjoy it for what it does offer, which is a funny and heartwarming look at the life of a true SuperStar.",981244800,18,989,4.441988950276243
