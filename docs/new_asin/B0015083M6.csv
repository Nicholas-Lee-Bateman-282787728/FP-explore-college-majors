3136551,3,B0015083M6,"""Black Orchid"" is a milestone of sorts. It marks the last of the historical episodes of ""Doctor Who"", and it's fitting it was released at the same time as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Time-Meddler-Episode-17/dp/B0017XOFFU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - The Time Meddler (Episode 17)</a>, which contained the first ""pseudo-historical"" adventure.

The plot here is basically silly. The Doctor and crew ends up in 1920's England. There's a girl who somehow ends up looking exactly like Nyssa. Ok. That makes sense, I guess. Sort of.

After suspending as much disbelief as one can, the plot kicks into gear and it's... it's... meh. Nothing special. It's a short, two-part story which is probably for the best. It's not bad, exactly, just not anything great.

What is great on this DVD, however, is the actors sitting around talking about the show during the commentary. It's hilarious, especially hearing them say how much the episode basically sucked. They were trying to be polite at times, but it wasn't happening. Loved it. :)

Also of note is a series they've started doing where they talk about the ""Doctor Who"" comic strips, this time focusing, of course, on the Peter Davidson strips and how hard it was to make the Doctor look right when drawing him.

This is worth buying if you want a cheap ""Doctor Who"" episode. It's slightly entertaining, but nothing great. I wouldn't use it to introduce someone to the series or anything like that, but it's perfectly acceptable.",1220140800,2,1543,5.385892116182573
3136552,5,B0015083M6,"The use of ""twins"" in this story was a nice change for Peter Davidson's doctor role, and the setting was a good represintation of the 20's.",1219363200,,139,4.384615384615385
3136553,4,B0015083M6,"""Black Orchid"" is like a trip back in time. Well, obviously so in that the Doctor and his three traveling companions wind up in 1925 where a series of mistaken identities and coincidences conspire to have them taking part in cricket matches and fancy costume balls as the guests of a certain Lord Cranleigh only to come under suspicion for murder. And this is the BBC, mind you, so all their expertise with period dramas comes to the fore in this relatively short ""Doctor Who"" storyline to convincingly authentic grand effect. But it's also a brief return (or the last belated gasp?) of this long-running show's original premise, wherein strictly science fiction stories alternated with strictly historical ones (not counting the Tardis, which lands the characters in a past time and so gets the ball rolling). This latter type of story gradually began to take a back seat and apparently saw its last with ""The Highlanders"" in 1966--until this story a full sixteen years later. No anachronisms, no aliens, no robots, no Cybermen, no lasers nor spaceships are to be found. Just a very terrestrially human and somewhat tragic threat.

Which is somewhat refreshing but also borders a tad on the dull side. It's a welcome change to see the Doctor along with Tegan, Nyssa, and Adric enjoying themselves for a change, living it up in good old 1925 fashion. After all, the vague suggestion (at least in my mind) was always that this is how the Doctor and company occupy themselves most the time, and the death-defying adventures come along ever so often in the meantime. Too much of a good thing could get tiresome, of course, which is why ""Black Orchid""'s noticeable brevity betrays a canny wisdom here on someone's part. The belatedly appearing threat is less than earth-shattering but still very real all the same, giving just about the right amount of dramatic tension to the tale. The only actual downside really is that the whole plot is set up like a fine specimen of the British ""whodunit"", only the cat is unfortunately let out of the bag virtually from the get-go, leaving even the minimally attentive viewer with little doubt as to who actually did the murders. Leaving a little mystery here, maybe even leading one to wonder if the Doctor isn't somehow inexplicably the culprit, might've added nicely to the suspense and made for a somewhat more memorable story. But so it goes. ""Black Orchid"" keeps to the low-key from start to finish, and that is both its strength and its weakness. Anyway, as a brief respite for both the Tardis crew and us viewers, it's quite topping in its own manner.",1218758400,4,2595,4.805369127516778
3136554,4,B0015083M6,"I'm sorry to say that ""Black Orchid"" is one of the few misfires from the Doctor Who DVD restoration team.  Not that there's much wrong with the story itself -- that's a genial little 45-minute murder mystery set in the 1920s, with lots of moments where the cast just gets to enjoy themselves (cricket matches, dances, buffet tables).  Indeed ""Black Orchid"" is reflected heavily in this past TV season's ""The Unicorn and the Wasp"", another '20s-era skeletons-in-the-family-closet comedy.

The problem with the DVD release then is in the usually reliable extra features.  Peter Davison, always the alpha male in the audio commentary booth and generally very funny and insightful, just doesn't have great fondness for the story and takes to mocking it relentlessly.  This approach worked well for his commentary on leser-appreciated stories such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Time-Flight-Episode-123/dp/B000TSTEOQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - Time-Flight (Episode 123)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Warriors-of-the-Deep-Story-131/dp/B00142UZ9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: Warriors of the Deep (Story # 131)</a>, but for poor little ""Black Orchid"" one feels sorry for the whole affair and wishes Davison had given it a chance to breathe.

Reunited in the booth with Davison are his fellow TV cast members.  Janet Fielding (Tegan) holds her own as usual, trading barb for barb with Davison.  Fielding's distaste for the story is somewhat surprising, as ""Black Orchid"" is one of those few instances where the character of Tegan actually smiles and appears to be enjoying herself -- dancing throughout much of Part One and even flirting a bit with an older police constable.  Sarah Sutton (Nyssa) gently leaps to the story's defense -- indeed ""Black Orchid"" was one of the rare moments she was allowed to dominate the screen as an actress across parts of three seasons on the show; here she plays a duel role and impresses as her innocent doppelganger Ann Talbot.  Matthew Waterhouse (Adric), soon to be written out of the series, had nothing to do in the story but eat, and in the  booth is a light foil to Davison, attempting to praise trivial aspects of the story while Davison laughs at him.

The production notes option is also surprisingly light.  The first such option I've seen not written by either Richard Molesworth or Martin Wiggins, the new text commentator on the block stops dispensing information early in Part Two and chimes in only occasionally the rest of the way only to mock the story (while not telling us, for example, how the impressive in-studio fire stunts were performed).

The rest of the included featurettes are nicely done.  The recurring ""Now and Then"" segment seamlessly contrasts clips from location filming against how the areas look today, played over with a 1920s soundtrack.  Seven minutes of deleted scenes are impressively portrayed, with existing material screened in sepia and only the ""missing"" segments aired in full color.  Finally, the nifty new ""Stripped for Action"" segment features several talking heads from Doctor Who Magazine describing the early 1980s ""Doctor Who"" comics, examples of which are unfortunately not included on DVD-ROM.",1218412800,6,3329,5.652610441767068
3136555,5,B0015083M6,"""Black Orchid"" is not your typical Doctor Who story.  Not only isit the first (and only) historical story since the beginning of the Troughton era, but it's the only historical story that isn't set in a particularly eventful time, or with famous people.  No Marco Polos or French Revolutions here ... just a country house in 1925. A country house inhabited by a young woman who looks exactly like Nyssa, a mysterious Amazonian servant, and hiding a variety of secrets in the attic. A fancy dress ball, a secret doorway, and a body in a cupboard round out the pleasures.

The story is more like a cozy mystery than a Doctor Who adventure, but that isn't a bad thing.  At least not in my opinion.

In the opinion of the cast, it WAS a bad thing.  The commentary track on this disc is among the best in the series.  The entire regular cast is there (Davison, Sutton, Fielding and Waterhouse), and one suspects that they've just come from the local pub because they are having a marvelous time. Aside from Sarah Sutton, (who enjoyed her dual role)  none of them much cared for the episode, (for reasons having to do with both the writing and some miserable weather during location filming), so they don't have very much *good* to say .. but they have a blast all the same as they talk about the costumes, the weather, the dancing, the cricket match, the acting by the guest cast, and the script.

The episode is a two parter, so even if the storyline doesn't grip you, you won't suffer for very long.

Extras, besides the commentary track and info-text include a short  documentary on the location filming, some examples of the restoration done on the original film, a Blue Peter episode that briefly mentions costume designs for the story  and (part of a new series of extras), a look at the Fifth Doctor in the Doctor Who comic strips.",1218067200,2,1833,4.554878048780488
3136556,4,B0015083M6,"If it weren't for this story, I would be left scratching my head and wondering why the hell these four individuals (they were barely a TARDIS team) would hang around each other for so long. Adric just becomes an obnoxious brat with the Fifth Doctor, Tegan just wants to go home, and Nyssa gets shunted to the sidelines every damn time. With the Sixth Doctor and Peri, there were moments in every story where you could tell they were close friends, which is absent with this team.

Except for this story.

Black Orchid, a two-parter that's a bit of a diversion, but it was needed, in my opinion, before the emotional-roller coaster known as Earthshock. A light-hearted adventure that you can sit down and relax to after doing a long shift of work, or even if you've come from a night about the town (like I did on the day I bought this.) The Fifth Doctor and Nyssa, the best Fifth Doctor combination, both get to shine here, Nyssa with Sarah Sutton's double role with Ann, finally giving Nyssa something to do in a story, and the Fifth Doctor, who shows off his amazing cricket skills, bringing a team back from a pathetic score (though I don't think even the Fifth Doctor could help England against Australia!)

And where the TARDIS crew get along? The scenes at Cranleigh Manor are easily some of my favourite of the Fifth Doctor era, where Tegan shows Nyssa some of the Earth dances and cheering on the Doctor in cricket, and Nyssa just looks more amused than ever at these bizarre rituals. Not to mention where they both gently mock Adric about his constant eating (how large are Alzarian stomachs anyway?) Adric for once is actually likeable.

Surprisingly, there are no science fiction elements whatsoever, a throwback to the early Doctor Who days where sci-fi and history genres went hand-in-hand, it's more like a murder mystery, a whodunit, where the Doctor becomes trapped while getting ready for the costume ball at Cranleigh Manor, and someone takes his place wearing the clown costume, ""Attacking"" Ann, and killing a servant who tries to help her...

All in all, one of my favourite Davison stories, and one you can watch and just enjoy.",1212624000,22,2149,4.704787234042553

3136558,3,B0015083M6,"In this short adventure with the fifth Doctor, the Doctor and his over full TARDIS end up in the Edwardian English country-side for this almost purely historical (the first story to due so possible since the 2nd Doctor meets the Highlander, please correct me if I'm wrong on that score).

The Doctor lands the TARDIS at an Edwardian train depot, where he is mysteriously expected by some local chaps for a game of cricket. Only happy to oblige, the Doctor tags along with Adric, the boy genius, Tegan, the walking mouth, and Nyssa, the smart & cute orphan from Traken. This case of mistaken identity leads the crew into a manor mystery Agatha Christie-style and a fancy-dress ball. Nyssa meets her Earth-twin and a twisted ""monster"" who may not have her best interests at heart.

As is the way of things in the 5th Doctor's era, the incidental companions end up learning of the Doctor's true origins or of the TARDIS. This plot device has been replaced in the new series by the Doctor's psychic paper, so he doesn't have to waste precious story-time with answering questions about ""how he got there.""

What keeps Black Orchid from being a neat historical adventure?
As is the way of things in the 5th Doctor's era, the incidental companions end up learning of the Doctor's true origins or of the TARDIS. This plot device has been replaced in the new series by the Doctor's psychic paper, so he doesn't have to waste precious story-time with answering questions about ""how he got there."" This nearly pointless visit to the TARDIS takes away from the mystery of the period. Another mistake is the overly ambitious make-up team that in the lack of an alien, they must compensate with latex.

What makes Black Orchid work? The beautiful location footage, which is always a staple of the series, the cricket game footage is really charming and are the costumes of the period and the fancy-dress as well.
Some of the dialogue is clunky, but overall consistent with the theme.
The story is a short 2 parter (thus the low selling price) which the new series has proved is the way of things for the 21st century viewer, so this one may be more accessible for fans who are just discovering the original shows.

As far as the extras go, the cast is really down on this particular story. Their personal experiences relayed during the audio commentary are some of the most negative & abrasive you will hear tied to a DVD, but train-wreck fascinating.

Possible Doctor Who drinking games.

3136562,5,B0015083M6,"A lot of people are down about this story, but Peter Davison has always been
one of my very favorite Doctors because I was introduced to DW while Tom Baker was
in the part and then continued on with the 5th Doctor so in many ways Davison is my Doctor.
And even though this is only a two-parter it's a wonderfully under appreciated story that combines
the best and first rate historical adventures of Doctor Who and quite possibly actually the last purely
historical story in the whole series...
I think it is fun and classically done even if the actors on the commentary don't care for it themselves and
think it is a poor story because of lack of any science fiction element I for one think it is excellent and
a breath of fresh air BECAUSE it lacks any science fiction element other than the Tardis and the Doctor
himself of course.
Just the characters relaxing and having a good old time which is rarely seen in the show... The Doctor playing cricket
while Tegan cheers him on and Nyssa and Adric are left wondering what it's all about are my favorite scenes
because rare was it that we got a chance to just see any set of Doctor Who characters just enjoying themselves.
Indeed all of the first episode is mainly just that - and for me character development and seeing that people in Doctor
Who are 'human' is just as important as anything else... in fact I would say more important.
Sure, it's an adventure show but you have 50 years and hundreds of stories of adventure... just once in awhile give
the characters a break and just have them go back in time and enjoy being back in time without necessarily some catastrophe
of hidden plot they have to fix by an alien species.
If YOU had constant access to an impervious time machine that was infinite inside wouldn't you want to just
take a holiday out away from all the adventuring and relax and go attend a party in the 1920's Gatsby style
or go to a beach once in awhile or just visit Spain or some distant star that was a resort?
Why must nearly EVERY episode since the William Hartnell era have something to do with science fiction!?
After all they do live and travel in a TIME MACHINE for God's sake! It's really too bad that pure historical
episodes went the way of the Dodo after this episode because I find them very very charming...
So this lists among my favorite Doctor episodes of all time just because it is such a rare outing
and no the Shakespeare Code or the one with Charles Dickens or the werewolf story or
any of the newer ones do not make the list because there is still some element of sci-fi there.
It's too bad that Doctors 9, 10 & 11 never saw any pure historical stories... maybe with some luck

3136563,4,B0015083M6,"An offbeat, unusually short (just two parts) period piece, ""Black Orchid"" is one of the strangest Dr. Who episodes of all, but not for the reasons you'd expect.

  (Mild Spoilers)

  A very odd little episode, this one finds Peter Davison's Doctor and his companions at a masquerade party in 1920's England. Bizarre and dastardly events ensue, but they remain grounded in the realm of the mundane; this is the series' first (and last) purely historical episode since the 1960's.  I think it's a surprisingly fun entertainment; the cast is allowed to interact in a relaxed fashion and its refreshing to see the stakes a bit lower than the typical Whovian ""world-in-peril"" plot. My only beef is that the Doctor isn't given enough sleuthing to do; in an episode obviously partly inspired by Agathie Christie it would have been appropriate to see some serious detective work. This definitely isn't for newcomers to Dr. Who, and I can understand why a lot of fans hate the episode, but if you like Davison's Doctor and are open to seeing a quirky spin on the show's premise, this one's a lot of fun.",1387843200,,1094,4.756613756613756

3136568,3,B0015083M6,"Not one of the more fondly remembered stories of the series compounded by the fact you're only getting two episodes from a time when they had far less experience doing either hour-long or non sci-fi Who stories.

Thankfully, there are a few selling points to recommend this title. One of these is the remastering team once again doing an amazing job on restoring the visuals. The outdoor scenes almost look like they were shot on 35mm film now, as opposed to 16mm that was likely used for most of the series's outdoor moments. They could have easily done a cheap job just to get it out there for completionists, but they brought their A-Game to this story and it shows.

Extras include a rather amusing commentary track by the cast, who have less than fond memories of shooting the story (especially the gals, who had to wear some semi-revealing costumes outdoors during an English October), and manage to have a laugh at its expense looking back. Also is another chapter of the interesting ""Stripped for Action"" series focusing on the comic book/strip at the time when it changed over from Baker to Davison's doctor. Interesting of note here is the interview with Dave ""The Other Guy Responsible for Watchmen"" Gibbons, who had an impressive run as the artist, and who apparently had a great deal of trouble at first capturing the Doctor's likeness, as previous Doctor's were easily caricatured, where Davison's face required far more subtlety. Some Blue Peter, info-text, a look at the restoration process, Now and Then showing how the locations have changed, and a really odd but interesting addition where Barry Took reads angry fan letters over the shows rescheduling at the time. I think the story and extras would have likely done better going into a two-disc set with ""Visitation"" rather than devoting a whole DVD package to it, but it's clear that the DVD producers were doing their best to give fans some value for their money.

The plot here is basically silly. The Doctor and crew ends up in 1920's England. There's a girl who somehow ends up looking exactly like Nyssa. Ok. That makes sense, I guess. Sort of.

After suspending as much disbelief as one can, the plot kicks into gear and it's... it's... meh. Nothing special. It's a short, two-part story which is probably for the best. It's not bad, exactly, just not anything great.

What is great on this DVD, however, is the actors sitting around talking about the show during the commentary. It's hilarious, especially hearing them say how much the episode basically sucked. They were trying to be polite at times, but it wasn't happening. Loved it. :)

Also of note is a series they've started doing where they talk about the ""Doctor Who"" comic strips, this time focusing, of course, on the Peter Davidson strips and how hard it was to make the Doctor look right when drawing him.

This is worth buying if you want a cheap ""Doctor Who"" episode. It's slightly entertaining, but nothing great. I wouldn't use it to introduce someone to the series or anything like that, but it's perfectly acceptable.",1220140800,2,1543,5.385892116182573

3371050,4,B0015083M6,"""Black Orchid"" is like a trip back in time. Well, obviously so in that the Doctor and his three traveling companions wind up in 1925 where a series of mistaken identities and coincidences conspire to have them taking part in cricket matches and fancy costume balls as the guests of a certain Lord Cranleigh only to come under suspicion for murder. And this is the BBC, mind you, so all their expertise with period dramas comes to the fore in this relatively short ""Doctor Who"" storyline to convincingly authentic grand effect. But it's also a brief return (or the last belated gasp?) of this long-running show's original premise, wherein strictly science fiction stories alternated with strictly historical ones (not counting the Tardis, which lands the characters in a past time and so gets the ball rolling). This latter type of story gradually began to take a back seat and apparently saw its last with ""The Highlanders"" in 1966--until this story a full sixteen years later. No anachronisms, no aliens, no robots, no Cybermen, no lasers nor spaceships are to be found. Just a very terrestrially human and somewhat tragic threat.

Which is somewhat refreshing but also borders a tad on the dull side. It's a welcome change to see the Doctor along with Tegan, Nyssa, and Adric enjoying themselves for a change, living it up in good old 1925 fashion. After all, the vague suggestion (at least in my mind) was always that this is how the Doctor and company occupy themselves most the time, and the death-defying adventures come along ever so often in the meantime. Too much of a good thing could get tiresome, of course, which is why ""Black Orchid""'s noticeable brevity betrays a canny wisdom here on someone's part. The belatedly appearing threat is less than earth-shattering but still very real all the same, giving just about the right amount of dramatic tension to the tale. The only actual downside really is that the whole plot is set up like a fine specimen of the British ""whodunit"", only the cat is unfortunately let out of the bag virtually from the get-go, leaving even the minimally attentive viewer with little doubt as to who actually did the murders. Leaving a little mystery here, maybe even leading one to wonder if the Doctor isn't somehow inexplicably the culprit, might've added nicely to the suspense and made for a somewhat more memorable story. But so it goes. ""Black Orchid"" keeps to the low-key from start to finish, and that is both its strength and its weakness. Anyway, as a brief respite for both the Tardis crew and us viewers, it's quite topping in its own manner.",1218758400,4,2595,4.805369127516778
3371051,4,B0015083M6,"I'm sorry to say that ""Black Orchid"" is one of the few misfires from the Doctor Who DVD restoration team.  Not that there's much wrong with the story itself -- that's a genial little 45-minute murder mystery set in the 1920s, with lots of moments where the cast just gets to enjoy themselves (cricket matches, dances, buffet tables).  Indeed ""Black Orchid"" is reflected heavily in this past TV season's ""The Unicorn and the Wasp"", another '20s-era skeletons-in-the-family-closet comedy.

The problem with the DVD release then is in the usually reliable extra features.  Peter Davison, always the alpha male in the audio commentary booth and generally very funny and insightful, just doesn't have great fondness for the story and takes to mocking it relentlessly.  This approach worked well for his commentary on leser-appreciated stories such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Time-Flight-Episode-123/dp/B000TSTEOQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - Time-Flight (Episode 123)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Warriors-of-the-Deep-Story-131/dp/B00142UZ9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: Warriors of the Deep (Story # 131)</a>, but for poor little ""Black Orchid"" one feels sorry for the whole affair and wishes Davison had given it a chance to breathe.

Reunited in the booth with Davison are his fellow TV cast members.  Janet Fielding (Tegan) holds her own as usual, trading barb for barb with Davison.  Fielding's distaste for the story is somewhat surprising, as ""Black Orchid"" is one of those few instances where the character of Tegan actually smiles and appears to be enjoying herself -- dancing throughout much of Part One and even flirting a bit with an older police constable.  Sarah Sutton (Nyssa) gently leaps to the story's defense -- indeed ""Black Orchid"" was one of the rare moments she was allowed to dominate the screen as an actress across parts of three seasons on the show; here she plays a duel role and impresses as her innocent doppelganger Ann Talbot.  Matthew Waterhouse (Adric), soon to be written out of the series, had nothing to do in the story but eat, and in the  booth is a light foil to Davison, attempting to praise trivial aspects of the story while Davison laughs at him.

The production notes option is also surprisingly light.  The first such option I've seen not written by either Richard Molesworth or Martin Wiggins, the new text commentator on the block stops dispensing information early in Part Two and chimes in only occasionally the rest of the way only to mock the story (while not telling us, for example, how the impressive in-studio fire stunts were performed).

The rest of the included featurettes are nicely done.  The recurring ""Now and Then"" segment seamlessly contrasts clips from location filming against how the areas look today, played over with a 1920s soundtrack.  Seven minutes of deleted scenes are impressively portrayed, with existing material screened in sepia and only the ""missing"" segments aired in full color.  Finally, the nifty new ""Stripped for Action"" segment features several talking heads from Doctor Who Magazine describing the early 1980s ""Doctor Who"" comics, examples of which are unfortunately not included on DVD-ROM.",1218412800,6,3329,5.652610441767068
3371052,5,B0015083M6,"""Black Orchid"" is not your typical Doctor Who story.  Not only isit the first (and only) historical story since the beginning of the Troughton era, but it's the only historical story that isn't set in a particularly eventful time, or with famous people.  No Marco Polos or French Revolutions here ... just a country house in 1925. A country house inhabited by a young woman who looks exactly like Nyssa, a mysterious Amazonian servant, and hiding a variety of secrets in the attic. A fancy dress ball, a secret doorway, and a body in a cupboard round out the pleasures.

The story is more like a cozy mystery than a Doctor Who adventure, but that isn't a bad thing.  At least not in my opinion.

In the opinion of the cast, it WAS a bad thing.  The commentary track on this disc is among the best in the series.  The entire regular cast is there (Davison, Sutton, Fielding and Waterhouse), and one suspects that they've just come from the local pub because they are having a marvelous time. Aside from Sarah Sutton, (who enjoyed her dual role)  none of them much cared for the episode, (for reasons having to do with both the writing and some miserable weather during location filming), so they don't have very much *good* to say .. but they have a blast all the same as they talk about the costumes, the weather, the dancing, the cricket match, the acting by the guest cast, and the script.

The episode is a two parter, so even if the storyline doesn't grip you, you won't suffer for very long.

Extras, besides the commentary track and info-text include a short  documentary on the location filming, some examples of the restoration done on the original film, a Blue Peter episode that briefly mentions costume designs for the story  and (part of a new series of extras), a look at the Fifth Doctor in the Doctor Who comic strips.",1218067200,2,1833,4.554878048780488
3371053,4,B0015083M6,"If it weren't for this story, I would be left scratching my head and wondering why the hell these four individuals (they were barely a TARDIS team) would hang around each other for so long. Adric just becomes an obnoxious brat with the Fifth Doctor, Tegan just wants to go home, and Nyssa gets shunted to the sidelines every damn time. With the Sixth Doctor and Peri, there were moments in every story where you could tell they were close friends, which is absent with this team.

Except for this story.

Black Orchid, a two-parter that's a bit of a diversion, but it was needed, in my opinion, before the emotional-roller coaster known as Earthshock. A light-hearted adventure that you can sit down and relax to after doing a long shift of work, or even if you've come from a night about the town (like I did on the day I bought this.) The Fifth Doctor and Nyssa, the best Fifth Doctor combination, both get to shine here, Nyssa with Sarah Sutton's double role with Ann, finally giving Nyssa something to do in a story, and the Fifth Doctor, who shows off his amazing cricket skills, bringing a team back from a pathetic score (though I don't think even the Fifth Doctor could help England against Australia!)

And where the TARDIS crew get along? The scenes at Cranleigh Manor are easily some of my favourite of the Fifth Doctor era, where Tegan shows Nyssa some of the Earth dances and cheering on the Doctor in cricket, and Nyssa just looks more amused than ever at these bizarre rituals. Not to mention where they both gently mock Adric about his constant eating (how large are Alzarian stomachs anyway?) Adric for once is actually likeable.

Surprisingly, there are no science fiction elements whatsoever, a throwback to the early Doctor Who days where sci-fi and history genres went hand-in-hand, it's more like a murder mystery, a whodunit, where the Doctor becomes trapped while getting ready for the costume ball at Cranleigh Manor, and someone takes his place wearing the clown costume, ""Attacking"" Ann, and killing a servant who tries to help her...

The Doctor lands the TARDIS at an Edwardian train depot, where he is mysteriously expected by some local chaps for a game of cricket.

This case of mistaken identity leads the crew into a manor mystery Agatha Christie-style and a fancy-dress ball. Nyssa meets her Earth-twin and a twisted ""monster"" who may not have her best interests at heart.

What keeps Black Orchid from being a neat historical adventure?
As is the way of things in the 5th Doctor's era, the incidental companions end up learning of the Doctor's true origins or of the TARDIS. This plot device has been replaced in the new series by the Doctor's psychic paper, so he doesn't have to waste precious story-time with answering questions about ""how he got there."" This nearly pointless visit to the TARDIS takes away from the mystery of the period. Another mistake is the overly ambitious make-up team that in the lack of an alien, they must compensate with latex.

What makes Black Orchid work? The beautiful location footage, which is always a staple of the series, the cricket game footage is really charming and are the costumes of the period and the fancy-dress as well.
Some of the dialogue is clunky, but overall consistent with the theme.
The story is a short 2 parter (thus the low selling price) which the new series has proved is the way of things for the 21st century viewer, so this one may be more accessible for fans who are just discovering the original shows.

As far as the extras go, the cast is really down on this particular story. Their personal experiences relayed during the audio commentary are some of the most negative & abrasive you will hear tied to a DVD, but train-wreck fascinating.

3371059,5,B0015083M6,"A lot of people are down about this story, but Peter Davison has always been
one of my very favorite Doctors because I was introduced to DW while Tom Baker was
in the part and then continued on with the 5th Doctor so in many ways Davison is my Doctor.
And even though this is only a two-parter it's a wonderfully under appreciated story that combines
the best and first rate historical adventures of Doctor Who and quite possibly actually the last purely
historical story in the whole series...
I think it is fun and classically done even if the actors on the commentary don't care for it themselves and
think it is a poor story because of lack of any science fiction element I for one think it is excellent and
a breath of fresh air BECAUSE it lacks any science fiction element other than the Tardis and the Doctor
himself of course.
Just the characters relaxing and having a good old time which is rarely seen in the show... The Doctor playing cricket
while Tegan cheers him on and Nyssa and Adric are left wondering what it's all about are my favorite scenes
because rare was it that we got a chance to just see any set of Doctor Who characters just enjoying themselves.
Indeed all of the first episode is mainly just that - and for me character development and seeing that people in Doctor
Who are 'human' is just as important as anything else... in fact I would say more important.
Sure, it's an adventure show but you have 50 years and hundreds of stories of adventure... just once in awhile give
the characters a break and just have them go back in time and enjoy being back in time without necessarily some catastrophe
of hidden plot they have to fix by an alien species.
If YOU had constant access to an impervious time machine that was infinite inside wouldn't you want to just
take a holiday out away from all the adventuring and relax and go attend a party in the 1920's Gatsby style
or go to a beach once in awhile or just visit Spain or some distant star that was a resort?
Why must nearly EVERY episode since the William Hartnell era have something to do with science fiction!?
After all they do live and travel in a TIME MACHINE for God's sake! It's really too bad that pure historical
episodes went the way of the Dodo after this episode because I find them very very charming...
So this lists among my favorite Doctor episodes of all time just because it is such a rare outing
and no the Shakespeare Code or the one with Charles Dickens or the werewolf story or
any of the newer ones do not make the list because there is still some element of sci-fi there.

  (Mild Spoilers)

  A very odd little episode, this one finds Peter Davison's Doctor and his companions at a masquerade party in 1920's England. Bizarre and dastardly events ensue, but they remain grounded in the realm of the mundane; this is the series' first (and last) purely historical episode since the 1960's.  I think it's a surprisingly fun entertainment; the cast is allowed to interact in a relaxed fashion and its refreshing to see the stakes a bit lower than the typical Whovian ""world-in-peril"" plot. My only beef is that the Doctor isn't given enough sleuthing to do; in an episode obviously partly inspired by Agathie Christie it would have been appropriate to see some serious detective work. This definitely isn't for newcomers to Dr. Who, and I can understand why a lot of fans hate the episode, but if you like Davison's Doctor and are open to seeing a quirky spin on the show's premise, this one's a lot of fun.",1387843200,,1094,4.756613756613756

Thankfully, there are a few selling points to recommend this title. One of these is the remastering team once again doing an amazing job on restoring the visuals. The outdoor scenes almost look like they were shot on 35mm film now, as opposed to 16mm that was likely used for most of the series's outdoor moments. They could have easily done a cheap job just to get it out there for completionists, but they brought their A-Game to this story and it shows.

Extras include a rather amusing commentary track by the cast, who have less than fond memories of shooting the story (especially the gals, who had to wear some semi-revealing costumes outdoors during an English October), and manage to have a laugh at its expense looking back. Also is another chapter of the interesting ""Stripped for Action"" series focusing on the comic book/strip at the time when it changed over from Baker to Davison's doctor. Interesting of note here is the interview with Dave ""The Other Guy Responsible for Watchmen"" Gibbons, who had an impressive run as the artist, and who apparently had a great deal of trouble at first capturing the Doctor's likeness, as previous Doctor's were easily caricatured, where Davison's face required far more subtlety. Some Blue Peter, info-text, a look at the restoration process, Now and Then showing how the locations have changed, and a really odd but interesting addition where Barry Took reads angry fan letters over the shows rescheduling at the time. I think the story and extras would have likely done better going into a two-disc set with ""Visitation"" rather than devoting a whole DVD package to it, but it's clear that the DVD producers were doing their best to give fans some value for their money.

8256821,4,B0015083M6,"Classic Who is always fun to watch. This story displays the interactions between the companions well, especially when they came up with different ways to deal with a problem. (Not always a good way!)",1429488000,,199,4.882352941176471
8256822,5,B0015083M6,"Although there are only 2 episodes to the story, it is well done and doesn't feel rushed. Personally, I find this story one of Peter Davison's better appearances as the Doctor.",1428019200,,176,4.709677419354839
8256823,5,B0015083M6,Good to get this now becoming rarity DVD!!!!,1426550400,,44,4.625
8256824,4,B0015083M6,"Reasonably good story with good commentary, so-so extras except for the location visits, which I like.",1426377600,,102,5.4375
8256825,3,B0015083M6,"This story was an oddity but a refreshing one. Yeah, there were some problems and I can get why Peter Davison didn't get for it, but it's refreshing to see the TARDIS crew get a break and have one and realistically, there would probably be quite a few TARDIS trips like this. Tegan's likable, Adric's inoffensive, and Sarah Sutton gets more opportunity to actually act.",1421020800,,369,4.6923076923076925
8256826,1,B0015083M6,"This is only about the disc itself.  I was not aware this is not a american accessible disc, it will not work on your dvd player.
I looked at the description again and it does not state this.",1421020800,,191,4.026315789473684
