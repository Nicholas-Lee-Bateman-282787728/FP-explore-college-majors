Mulford's stories, they strived in changing Cassidy's image, which was both original and influential --- the hero, played by William Lawrence Boyd, was mature and a man of his word --- the plots were solid with a sudden burst of climactic action in the last reel, usually a frantic chase backed by tension building music.

William ""Hopalong"" Boyd  - Producer
Lewis Rachmil  - Producer
Charles S. Belden  - Screenwriter

Hoppy's interaction with California Carlson (Andy Clyde) is always a shot in the arm with his down-to-earth humor and sentimentality, theses scenes are pure Americana! Boyd, with his silver hair, black clothes and white horse (Topper) rode into our lives and we've never been the same since --- your children and grandchildren will enjoy this clean wholesome entertainment --- Hoppy always wore two silver white handle six shooters, never drank or smoked, when the good guys always won and the moral to the story was fair-play -- outstanding role model.

Hats off and thanks to Les Adams (collector/guideslines for character identification), Chuck Anderson (Webmaster: The Old Corral/B-Westerns. Com), Boyd Magers (Western Clippings), Bobby J. Copeland (author of ""Trail Talk""), Rhonda Lemons (Empire Publishing Inc) and Bob Nareau (author of ""The Real Bob Steele"") as they have rekindled my interest once again for B-Westerns and Serials --- If you're into the memories of B-Westerns with high drama, this is the one you've been anxiously waiting for --- please stand up and take a bow --- all my heroes have been cowboys!

7814754,3,6301757890,"Completed during the final year (1948) of Hopalong Cassidy feature film-making, this effort unsuccessfully blends humour with a customary action element, relating of quarrels among a crusty schoolteacher and two rival saloon owners, with Hopalong (William Boyd) and his two sidekicks, Lucky Jenkins (Rand Brooks) and California Carlson (Andy Clyde) finding themselves trying to mediate the various conflicts while Hoppy and California fill in for the schoolmarm (Anne O'Neal) who has been kidnapped as punishment for breaking saloon windows with apples. Produced by Boyd for United Artists and filmed in California's picturesque Inyo County, the work fails to maintain a consistent tone and, although the cast provides good performances from veteran supporting players Byron Foulger, Earle Hodgins and Cliff Clark, tepid direction from generally reliable George Archainbaud, along with very sloppy editing, leave their markings; there is, however, a nifty score by Darrell Calker who composed for many ""B""s, and always adroitly.",1119225600,,1028,5.769736842105263
