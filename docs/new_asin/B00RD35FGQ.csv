8694916,5,B00RD35FGQ,I had seen this on PBS years before and always wanted my own copy. I now have it. It's a thorough investigation into the life of LHO and sticks to the facts. Doesn't dabble in conspiracy theories and conjecture. Solid reporting and a well done Documentary!,1488240000,2,256,4.586956521739131
