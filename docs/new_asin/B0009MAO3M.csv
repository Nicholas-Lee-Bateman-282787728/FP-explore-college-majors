2300665,4,B0009MAO3M,"This DVD is filled with wonderful and touching stories.  Like Basho's poetry that accompanies the stories, the drawings are simple yet rich.  A practically still shot of the father Takashi after his mother-in-law has embarrassed him (no spoilers, you'll have to watch it) conveys as much emotion as Bill Murray or Clint Eastwood have ever done with one of their trademark looks.

I would strongly recommend the Japanese language track for all audiences though.  As talented as the casts that Disney has assembled for the Ghibli imports are, this one especially demands to be heard in Japanese.  The rhythm and mood of the stories while accessible to all are very much Japanese and as the aforementioned Bill Murray might find, are lost in translation with English dialog.",1124409600,5,771,5.039370078740157
2300666,5,B0009MAO3M,"Created after an idea of the popular Japanese comic book author  Isaichi Ishii, this movie tells nine amusing and moving episodes from the every day life of a ""totally normal"" Japanese family.

Mischievousely, ""My Neighbours, The Yamadas"" describes the problems and quarrels that raise from marriage and generation conflicts. Thus, the author paints the lively and colourful portrait of a family who is an explosive mixture of eccentric, yet highly sympathical individualists.

At the same time the wonderfully drawn movie doesn't lack depth. The poesy of every day life which filters through the lives of the Yamadas is summed up at the end of each chapter in an haiku (most of them by Basho). Being a basic part of Japanese culture and spirituality, these short poems fit the respective characters' philosophy excellently.

A deeper symbolic dimension opens to the viewer in the partially grotesque/surrealistic scenes of the movie. A flashback shows us the Yamadas as honeymooners riding a gigantic wedding cake. Long married, they try vehemently to get the upper hand in the daily quarrel over the TV programme and both fight virtuousely in Japanese fencing style over the remote control.

""My Neighbours, The Yamadas"" premiered extremely successfully in 2000 at the Anime-Festival in Annecy (France).",1119052800,28,1305,5.315533980582524

2300847,5,B0009MAO3M,"Studio Ghibli's other director (other than Hayao Miyazaki) is Isao Takahata.  Isao Takahata has not only been responsible for the animated features Grave of the Fireflies, Pompoko, and Only Yesterday, but he has also been the producer on some of Hayao Miyazaki's film projects such as Kiki's Delivery Service, My neighbor Tototro, and Spirited Away.

My Neighbor the Yamadas directed by Takahata is a very humorous and refreshing film. The movie is based on a newspaper comic strip in Japan, and it consists of moments of comedy in daily family life.  Think the animated Charlie-Brown-type mixed with Japanese-family-life-type and you may have some idea of My Neighbor the Yamadas. (Btw, I love the symbolic and visual wedding sequence in the early part of the film.) I enjoyed My Neighbor the Yamadas and really like having it in my Studio Ghibli collection, although I suspect the film may not be up to the high expectations of some people looking for a flashy fantasy adventure or dramatic adventure-type Studio Ghibli film.",1402012800,,1027,5.06508875739645
2300848,4,B0009MAO3M,This is an old movie and it's really weird in my opinion but it's got a nice message and I kinda dig it. ;D,1394755200,,107,3.5
2300849,5,B0009MAO3M,"This movie is definitely coming from left field, but it does so with beautiful fervor.

As many reviews will tell you, the movie is not one linear narrative. Instead, it is an episodic foray into a family's life. It seems almost ""Seinfeldian"" at heart. It presents itself as the movie about nothing, but, as the movie progresses, it emphasizes the dynamics between the family members. There is an overworked sweet mother that does her best to keep the family as a unit. There is a father who strives to be the kind of figure that his children and family can look up toward. There are the kids who are progressing through the changes in life the best they can. Story-wise, the movie demands that the themes in each episode be connected but not to the point of a homogeneity. Each episode arc allows a platform for another arc to be viewed.

It's a different viewing experience than the other Ghibli movies, but it definitely is something that succeeds in its narrative attempts. I could imagine some ghibli fans being disappointed in the looks of the movie and the narrative elements, but the movie often fluctuates in price. If you catch while the price is down to 10 or 12 dollars, I think you will be pleased by the end regardless of where you stood at the beginning.",1393286400,,1269,4.58590308370044

However quality of the product was not 100% OK.

2300894,5,B0009MAO3M,"A largely unsung Ghibli film, Isao Takahata's My Neighbors the Yamada's was the studio's first feature film to be produced completely digitally, boasting a unique style that resembles chibi cartoons splashed with watercolor. The vast majority of Ghibli films are done in the same style that was made a staple of Japanese animation by Takahata and Miyazaki in films like Laputa: Castle in the Sky, My Neighbor Totoro and Princess Mononoke. These films are epic in scope and My Neighbors the Yamada's is simply not. It is about a very typical Japanese family and their daily lives. If it bears any resemblance to prior Ghibli movies, there are shades of Totoro's family drama present, but here that focus is taken to its logical conclusion, a combination of affirmation and conflict that for better or worse is how most of us spend our lives.

The father, Takashi, is brash and foolish, short of temper and utterly impatient. He is a man of values, and the family does not seem to share them. I love a scene where he is the only one to be excited about the winter's first snow, while the entire family cannot take their eyes off of a snowstorm on the television, too absorbed to notice Dad setting up a camera on time lapse to record their frivolities. Takashi's wife Matsuko seems to have lost her mind from the incessant grind of being married to someone with which connection is difficult. We see her listening to classical music and zoning out often. She is largely unable or unwilling to perform the kinds of household tasks families generally expect of mothers, though there are always two sides to these issues. Her elderly mother Shige is a hilariously headstrong character. Sassy, confident and having little regard for common etiquette, she is an essential Grandmother. At one point she tells off a group of potentially dangerous bikers, and she is constantly at odds with her son in law and his mad, fruitless campaign for blind respect. Though by no means perfect she can step up to the plate when necessary, especially when her grandchildren are of concern. Noboru is the teenage son, who despite the seriousness with which he regards his studies and himself is still an adolescent and therefore severely emotionally volatile. When we see him going bananas over what sounds like a totally mindless conversation with a girl, we are reminded that he is the family member in the most difficult age bracket. His counterpart is his sister, the precocious Nonoko, the family's youngest and quietest member, who along with Shige is often one of its most competent players. I am often reminded in The Yamada's about how the perspectives of the elderly and the very young are among the most valuable, not an uncommon thread for Ghibli films. While the majority of the adult Yamadas freak out in the car about forgetting Nonoko at the shopping mall, she handles a difficult situation beautifully and with a level head; she believes it is the rest of the family who has truly gotten lost.

The Yamada's spend the greater portion of the film's countless vignettes forgetting things, and more importantly dealing with one another being forgetful. At times they seem a group of near incompetents whose only commonalities are their shared last name and their tendency to forget: bookbags, manners, the reason they left the room to begin with. In essence, they are a family. Takahata strikes a balance with the characters synergy, and we find a little bit of ourselves in each of them. At times this film is hilariously real and blunt, reflective of dynamics shared by most families, and Takahata does a good job of making these complex dynamics more or less accessible to an all ages audience.

Remember, this is a family film of Ghibli standards. The sentiment pushed hardest is that despite all their dysfunctionality, the Yamada's prevail through their togetherness. For every uproariously funny moment in The Yamadas (they are not few), there is another profoundly sad, and for every heartrending moment there is another heartwarming; the film rarely stops for breath. A magical scene: Father calls home, he is caught in the rain and asks his wife to bring him his umbrella. She audibly tries to defer the responsibility to someone, anyone else in the family, and ultimately no one wishes to help Dad out. ""FORGET IT, ILL BUY ONE!"" ""PICK UP SOME PORK TOO!"" ""OK, FINE!!""The next minute is essentially silent, Dad in the grocery store collecting his umbrella and then after brief deliberation the pork too, slow and forlorn. Surrounded by women, he glances at none of them. Walking home in the rain, he meets up with his wife and kids, on their way to meet him.

Please also remember that this is an animated film of Ghibli standards as well, and is consistently visually engrossing. The film both leads off and concludes with speeches at weddings, and the first is interspersed with a colorful, imaginative montage of magic and adventure, the daydream of Nonoko about the brave, legendary Yamadas. Within the first five minutes it should be readily apparent that this film is just as capable of the visual magic that has always been characteristic of Ghibli, and although Takahata pulls this fantasy and magic out when he needs to, The Yamada's is an animated film still mostly rooted in reality. That Takahata decides to concern himself largely with the mundane here is an incredible gesture; he draws out the magic in the ordinary.",1356393600,,5432,4.875541125541125
2300895,4,B0009MAO3M,"Studio Ghibli is known for producing sublime works of art that combine awesome stories with beautiful animation. My Neighbors the Yamadas is not that well known among the SG canon but it should be (and you can usually tell what is popular by the number of reviews something has. As of writing this, this film only has 33 reviews while Spirited Away has 911). Told in the form of cartoon sketches (think the Garfield or Cathy comic strips), the film revolves around the Yamada family. There is the husband - Takashi, the mother - Matsuko, the grandmother - Shige, the children - Noboru, the 13yo son and Nonoko, the 5yo daughter. They even throw in the family dog - Pochi.

What is the story about? Well now that is harder to describe. Because this is told through comic strip style, there is no one main story. There are a series of stories all revolving around the Yamada family. Through these stories you will get glimpses into Japanese domestic life and Japanese society. It's almost like being an anthropologist when watching this because there are so many interesting details that one encounters.

I do admit the film wore on a bit too long for me, because some of the stories were better than the others. In particular, the one about losing one's child at the department store was hilarious and is a highlight of the film. Ultimately you will be watching a film about a Japanese family that loves each other. I do recommend watching other Studio Ghibli works first, esp the Takahata ones. Takahata represents the more realistic side of Studio Ghibli. This is the side that I feel is not as well known as the Miyazaki fantasy side. But it should be as known because it's just as good.",1352505600,,1689,4.626666666666667
2300896,4,B0009MAO3M,"This is really like a series of short, continuing funny, quirky little antecdotes about the Yamada family. It involves everyday situations, but presented in a cute, charming manner. The animation style looks a little crude, but it actually complements the story with well-done simple line drawings. This film was adorable. I wish I knew the Yamadas.",1345680000,,349,5.25

2300918,5,B0009MAO3M,"For those that have enjoyed other Studio Ghibli feature length films you should first note that this is far from the same style of art and story structure, but carries with it the same heart warming feelings. Going into my first viewing of this, I was not previously aware of the dramatic difference in style, as well as the fact that instead of one continuous stream of storyline it is broken up into nine short stories or vignettes of the Yamada's day-to-day life. These are done in a sketchy water-color style that invokes an essence of traditional Japanese art that I found rather beautiful and each episode is caped off with a traditional haiku (by Basho or Buson).

These short stories of the Yamada family shows us how sticking together through the rougher trials of life we are able to overcome anything and that we should never forget that our family and the ones we love are really the most important part of life. Some of these lessons shown within a traditional middle-class Japanese family might be initially lost on those outside of Japan, but if given a chance you will see how these core family values are really an integral part of families the world over. You might not get all the haiku poetry or references to some Japanese folk-lore, but I believe these stories are easy to relate to for anyone who has ever known a hard working father like Takashi, a loving mother like Matsuko, or has ever experienced the quarrels between a brother and sister like Noboru and Nonoko, who are all backed by Matsuko's mother, Shige, who like many grandparents are the real glue that holds a family all together.",1318896000,,1616,4.670175438596491

2300921,3,B0009MAO3M,"My Neighbors the Yamadas is a film produced by Studio Ghibli and directed by Isao Takahata.  Unlike other films produced by Studio Ghibli, My Neighbors the Yamadas presents a series of vignettes instead of one continuous story.  The vignettes feature a Japanese family of a father, a mother, a son, a daughter, and a grandmother.  The film is based on the manga Nono-chan by Hisaichi Ishii.  My Neighbors the Yamadas also has the distinction as being the first completely digital film released by Studio Ghibli.

The animation was done in such a way to look like watercolor pictures instead of cel animation, and this technique gives the film a completely different look and feel than other films produced by Studio Ghibli.  The storytelling is also much more on the humorous side, but the stories still have a tone of sincerity to them.  Content-wise, there is nothing objectionable for children to see.  However, I think kids younger than seven or eight years of age might have a harder time appreciating the stories and humor present in the film.

My Neighbors the Yamadas was released as a single disc, rather than in the two-disc sets of other Studio Ghibli films.  There are three special features included on the disc.  The first is a ""Behind the Microphone"" documentary, which lasts for about five and a half minutes.  This documentary includes interviews with Jim Belushi, Molly Shannon, Daryl Sabara, and Liliana Mumy.

Next, there are the original trailers for My Neighbors the Yamadas.  This featrure runs for sixteen minutes, and plays all the trailers back-to-back.  The trailers have their original Japanese audio accompanied by English subtitles.  The final feature on the disc is the original Japanese storyboards.

My Neighbors the Yamadas was an entertaining viewing experience, but this is probably one of the few Studio Ghibli films that I wouldn't want to watch more than once or twice.  However, if you are a fan of Isao Takahata, or want to own all of Studio Ghibli's releases, then this DVD should be added to your collection.",1257206400,6,2051,4.964809384164223
2300922,5,B0009MAO3M,"Let me start by saying I am a bit biased because I am a big fan of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio who put this movie out (Disney handles all the USA distribution and the translation into English). That being said, I think anyone could like this movie, as the family humor is universal. The animation is entirely done on computer but has a watercolor look to it. The movie is based on a Japanese comic. James Belushi and Molly Shannon head the English translation cast and they do a good job. If you like you can watch it in Japanese with English subtitles. ""My Neighbors the Yamadas"" is different than many run of the mill Japanese animated films. There are no giant robots or Samurai, etc.  There is no violence and this movie is good for any age, and my whole family enjoys it. This may be hard to find as a rental, and I always like to watch a movie before I buy it. But if you can't find it to rent first, you will likely not be disappointed if you just buy it, if you are a fan of clean family humor.",1253923200,2,1019,4.198979591836735
2300923,2,B0009MAO3M,"Let me start this review by clarifying a few things.  First off, I'm a huge fan of Studio Ghibli.  Secondly, I read the reviews before I saw this so I knew exactly what I was getting.  In other words, one shouldn't expect a sweeping cohesive narrative or a beautifully animated feature film such Spirited Away or My Neighbor Totoro.  So, I didn't have any preconceived notions about what this film would be: I was expecting a collection of short skits about a (somewhat) typical Japanese family and that's pretty much what this is.  So, I feel like I'm judging this objectively on its own merits and not on unfair expectations. Now, on to the rest of the review!

Despite my low rating, there were some positive things which I enjoyed.  Firstly, the haiku poems that separate each skit are nicely written and fit well with the themes.  Secondly, there were funny and cute moments to be found, especially the scene where the couple are fighting over the remote.  I especially like the way in which you feel that you can relate to this family.  They seem very realistic (albeit a bit exaggerated for humorous effect).  I mean, come on, who hasn't argued with their spouse/significant other over who gets to pick what to watch on TV?

Now, the reason this gets a low rating is for several negative things which I felt detracted from the overall experience.  Firstly, I felt that the movie did not focus enough on the humor.  There are narrations which make me feel like the movie is trying to offer proverbial ""words of wisdom"" or life coaching advice (marriage is like a boat in a storm, etc.) and it almost feels tacked on and unnecessary.  I understand that they were trying to integrate both into this movie, but I don't think they quite pull it off.  Obviously, this is a matter of opinion and some people might like this approach and find it charming.

Secondly, the skit style makes this whole 1 hour and 44 minute movie lack a cohesive feel.  I found that this makes the movie rather boring and hard to pay attention to.  In fact, we ending up turning it off halfway through the first viewing.  I finished it at a later time, but still didn't find it any more interesting.  Perhaps if I had a greater understanding of Japanese culture I might've understood the subtler humor involved, but alas, it was lost on me and I felt quite bored.

Thirdly, the art style is very minimalist.  I don't automatically count this as a negative point since some people may like such a style.  I am personally neutral to it.  The reason I list this as a negative though is because at times the art is SO minimalistic that it takes you awhile to realize exactly what something is supposed to be.  In fact, many times I had to use context clues to figure out what an object was.  For example, when the father pulled out a pack of cigarettes I didn't even realize it was a pack of cigarettes until he pulled out a stick-like item and stuck it in his mouth and then said ""I need a light"".  In another scene, I didn't realize that the square thing was actually a remote until the couple started fighting over the tv.  Now, this confusion didn't happen often and I quickly figured out things but I'm just pointing out that the art style does have its problems, especially since its even less defined than your average cartoon.

Lastly, I think this film has a problem with pacing.  At 1 hour and 44 minutes, it goes on a long time to have nothing but loosely related skits.  If they had cut out some of the more dull parts and made this maybe a 30 minute short it might have been more interesting and engaging.  As it is though, it feels like it drags on and on.

I understand that this film was based on a comic strip and was never meant to be a feature film with a cohesive plotline, and for an adaptation of a comic I think it does fairly well.  However, it's really too boring to recommend to anyone except the most die-hard of Ghibli enthusiasts, those with a better knowledge of Japanese culture, or those who already enjoy the comic itself.  In fact, if it weren't for the fact that I'm trying to rent every film Studio Ghibli has made I probably wouldn't have ever watched this.  So, my definite advice is that those who are interested in seeing this should really rent it first (available through Netflix) instead of running out and buying it just because it has the Ghibli name on it.  At least that way, if you don't like it you didn't spend your money on an expensive Ghibli DVD.  Overall, after my viewing experience I really can't give this more than 2/5 stars.",1252368000,10,4557,4.464328899637243
2300924,4,B0009MAO3M,"The first 20 some odd minutes of this movie is a boring half-funny Home Alone clone, but later on when the stories are shorter and move at a faster pace, things get good and downright hilarious. I didn't care for the animation at first either, but when I realized the movie actually plays out like many newspaper style comic strips, I realized it works perfectly.",1218931200,,363,4.6
2300925,4,B0009MAO3M,"As Ghibli rolls on becoming one of the biggest hits overseas after 'Princess Mononoke' it was time for something completly different. Isao Takahata takes the wheel with 'My Neighbors The Yamadas'. It's a simple story of your average family in peaceful suburbia. Takashi and Matsuko are a quirky couple trying to provide as best they can for their loathing teenaged son Nauboro their innocent daughter Nonoko and their slick mother living with them. They go through a series of events such as losing a family memeber at the mall to fighting over the remote control. Through all the arguements, and fast paced days this nutty family always manages to stay together not wanting to get at each others' throats.

Isao Takahata is known for his realism in his directorial role, but this time he gets as real as it can possibly get. Though the animation is extremly cartoony and these characters have crazy imiginations, this film is all about the little moments that make up average family life. As you watch it you will pick out moments that you can sware happened in your neighbors or your friends or even your very own family! The english voices were perfect for each character. Jim Belushi and Molly Shannon are fantastic in the roles and they have such strong if not loopy chemistry in each scene they share. 'The Yamadas can be compared to the famous sitcom families with the events that take place and the antics involved. The movie is a bit slow, but the content really keeps you in your seat waiting to see what crazy adventure is next! It is also a landmark film for Takahata because he defineltly beleives life is not as fun without the laughs and this film keeps you smiling from begining to end.",1214438400,,1702,4.6923076923076925
2300926,4,B0009MAO3M,"Ghibli's 1999 animation work by Isao Takahata one of the founders of the animation giant introduces different animation style from the one previously held by Ghibli and pre-Ghibli works. Ghibli animation works(particularly of Hayao Miyazaki) are featured with vivid real scene structure but this one is roughly sketched animation. This gives collection of 4-panel cartoon series a new life by putting maximum use to the original cartoon style comics. The story is typical sazae-san style post-war Japanese home drama
having a salaried office worker as a father, a housewife as a mother, a junior high school student having trouble with his studies and a happy-go-lucky elementary school girl and a picky grandmother. It occasionally introduces old kids' heroes during 60s such as Masked Rider(not what we call Kamen Rider but a robe masked hero known as Gekko Kamen) just as Takahata did in Only Yesterday. It is entertaining but some scene needs a bit of understanding of modern Japanese culture.

Verdict: Nice animation experiment

2300967,3,B0009MAO3M,"We were very excited to try this DVD. We love animation and cartoons, and I particularly am interested in Japanese culture, and we really love what Studio Ghibli puts out. However we were fairly disappointed in this DVD.

My Neighbors the Yamadas is a series of short stories about the Yamada family daily life. Some of the happenings were cute or somewhat funny, but my son (who watched it with me) and I agreed that most of it was boring. I did like the little bits of Basho's haiku that was included between clips, and some of the discussions of food and daily life was interesting. The drawing and artwork wasn't enticing nor most of the stories.

Nothing attention grabbing here. My son walked away part-way through and went back to his games, and I went back to work while we let the DVD play through to the end - it just couldn't hold our interest. Hmm...I'll definitely try more of their movies, but I'll read reviews here next time before picking up just anything. This studio's films tend to be pricey too, and never marked down, and it was a disappointing purchase.

To be fair, I will try and watch it again. I think if I watched it having no expectations, I might like it a little better.",1201046400,5,1201,4.474885844748859

The visuals support the vignettes' dialogue. I enjoyed watching the wedding morph into the bobsled race and the ship in the first vignette.  However, these visuals need stronger color-the picture tends to be very pale and a little difficult watch for a long period of time with out a dark room.",1182902400,2,615,4.828571428571428

STOP.

This film is totally unworthy of the Studio Ghibli name.  Heck, it's barely worthy of the Jim Belushi name.  To start with, it's not a real movie:  it's a collection of skits.  Dad tosses the ball around with Junior.  Dad has a fight with Mother-In-Law.  Mom and Dad fight over the remote control.  Blackout.  Next skit.

Now, some of these skits connect.  I found myself laughing four or five times, and for about ten minutes I actually thought the film was cool.

For the rest of its running time, though, it's real hard to sit through.  Probably half the skits leave you scratching your head thinking ""Huh?"" and the rest could have been written by Joe Piscopo.  Do yourself a favor:  watch ""Howl's Moving Castle"" again.  Or ""Kiki's Delivery Service,"" or ""The Cat Returns,"" or ""Spirited Away,"" or ""My Neighbor Totoro.""  They're brilliant.  This film, unfortunately, is a mess.",1169424000,10,1060,4.9147727272727275

2300997,4,B0009MAO3M,"The movie itself it about the typical 'every day life' of a Japanese family. Be warned: If you don't know something about it, you may become bored after a short time. The movie is divided into different chapters about the protagonists, featuring all members of the family. The animation style is IMO far away from the 'typical Anime style', yet it is still Anime. The whole movie is drawn in the same style like shown on the cover, sparse pencil strokes, very clean backgrounds and pastel colors. The movie is very quiet and features sequences where nothing happens but portrays the typical life of a Japanese family and is quite funny for those who know something about Japanese life - I am married with a Japanese and lived there, so I know some ;-)

The movie is far away from Myazaki's rich, colorful and fantasy movies. So, please don't expect something like this. But the movie has it's own unique style and is entertaining. Recommended to watch with somebody who knows something about Japanese culture.",1167782400,5,1009,4.765714285714286
2300998,5,B0009MAO3M,"This release from Studio Ghibli focuses on realism in theme and abstraction in art. Instead of the breathtaking naturalistic watercolor backgrounds and almost lifelike animated characters, ""My Neighbors the Yamadas"" [...] delivers breathtakingly stylized abstract forms and deceptively ""simple"" animation. But on closer inspection the animation reveals a true complexity and beauty nearly equal to that of other Ghibli films. Just watch the backgrounds as the Yamadas float over cities and water; or as they luge in matrimony over an icy landscape that suddenly morphs into a gigantic spiraling wedding cake. Not only that, the expressions of the characters, especially of the father Takashi, posit multitudinous and indescribable meanings. And all with simple lines that speak directly to human experience. When the family realizes that they've left their daughter, Noboru, stranded in a shopping mall, Takashi's face exposes a million ineffable feelings. Also, the family dog retains an almost stoic indifference to the Yamada's comings and goings. Again completely revealed in expressions (this cartoon dog doesn't talk).

The film doesn't really have a straight narrative, but it does tell a story. A series of somewhat disjointed vignettes paints a picture of the workaday life of a disfunctional but normal family. Nothing and everything happens to them. They embody family principles and values familiar to anyone who's lived in one. The difference comes with culture, and the Yamadas live fully within their Japanese culture. The mother, Matsuko, remains home and goes about her domestic duties (which include peeling the embedded Takashi out of his almost catatonic slumber, finding ways to avoid cooking, and appropriating the television channel Samurai-style). Shige, the grandmother, also lives with the family. She helps out when she can, and usually provides the family a traditional moral background. But she also acts like a little girl when disputing park territory (in one scene she beautifully and literally regresses in the eyes of her rival). She also reveals her bravery against a gang of motorcycle thugs that terrorize the neighborhood. At the beginning of this scene the animation becomes eerily realistic, visually expressing the true to life tension of the confrontation. In the shadow of Shige's bravery, Takashi is reduced to hero fantasizing. He imagines himself as ""The Masked Rider"" saving his grateful family from kidnappers. Familar feelings of inadequacy emanate from his forlorn posture. In this way the segmented story reveals depth of character and the inner lives of the characters. Again the focus remains on family. And the film includes tongue-in-cheek parodies of family life as well as touching scenes of togetherness that never border on sappy. Calling it a family comedy greatly limits its true scope.

Though most will likely identify with the universal themes that this movie deals with, some of the cultural aspects may throw non-Japanses viewers. References to Japanese food, culture, ideals, idioms, and language abound. This film was made for a Japanese audience. But this also doesn't limit its appeal in any way. Nonetheless, those with no background in Japanese language and culture may find themselves lost at times, albeit infrequently.

Overall, the film expresses a steadfast resilience in the face of life's vicissitudes. Near the end, the choice of the song ""Que Sera? Sera?"" is particularily revealing in this aspect. As the Yamadas freely float off into the sky on umbrellas (dog included) the song and the visuals emphasize the fact that we are what we are, regardless of disappointments and frustrations, and that all remains okay regardless. Somehow we manage to get through this absurd thing together. It also strives to remind us not to take life too seriously. Troubles come and go but in the end that's really what it's all about. The highly stylized animation, the multi-dimensional characters, and the themes make this a very enjoyable film.",1144454400,6,4013,5.376788553259141
2300999,5,B0009MAO3M,"Hohoukekyo Tonari no Yamada-kun, or My Neighbours The Yamadas, is quite a departure from the usual oeuvre of Studio Ghibli.  The work of director Isao Takahata (Hotaru no Haka, Heisei Tanuki Gassen), this 1999 release is done in a rough, less sophisticated art-style harkening back to yonkoma (four panel) comic strips, which is actually where it came from.  The colours are softer and fuzzier as well.  This look at life's funny moments through the eyes of a Japanese family and their dog works well because despite the Japanese trimmings, the Yamadas of Japan could also be the Smiths and Jones of the US and the UK as well.  BTW, the first word of the Japanese title, ""hohoukekyo"" is a Japanese onomatopoeia for the chirp a songbird makes.

The family consists of Takashi and Matsuko Yamada, the older child and boy Noboru and young daughter Nonoko, Matsuko's mother Shige, and Potchi the dog.  Note-although both parents call Shige ""okaasan"" or ""mother,"" Shige and Matsuko speak in an Osakan dialect whereas Takashi doesn't, hence I draw my conclusion that Shige is Matsuko's mother.

Matsuko's quite useless and lazy when it comes to housework.  She scrambles to bring the laundry from the rain, only to find out she'd never put it out to begin with!  And she has the tendency to cook the same thing days on end, or to prepare shabu-shabu (a hot pot where one puts in sliced vegetables or meet and pulls them out to eat when cooked).  As Shige mutters, that's one way her daughter doesn't have to cook.

Noboru seems to be a typical teenager, studying hard, having problems at school, and with the expected generation gap between him and his father.  And it's heartening to see him joyful after he gets a phone call from a girl and is happy with joy.  Ah, the spring of adolescent love.

Takashi is a hard-working salaryman who longs for respect.  In one episode, he calls home to see if anyone can bring him an umbrella, only to hear various family members give excuses.  Mad, he hangs up, buys an umbrella at the supermarket, and emerges into the rain, only to see the rest of the family decked out in rain gear or umbrellas coming out to meet him, Matsuko with a spare umbrella for him.  They walk home together.  However, when he comes from half-tired after a long day at work and is starving, Matsuko, too bothered to cook, gets him a cup of coffee and a banana before she resumes her place watching TV.

Apart from a series of funny misadventures and observations of family life, it's hard to garner a central theme.  However, ""the ups and downs of life"" as seen on the DVD package is enhanced in a scene where Takashi, speaking to a young couple during the wedding reception, is accidentally handed a shopping list instead of his notes by Matsuko.  He goes on an impromptu speech thus to Ichiro and Kazuko which comes from experience with his own dysfunctional family:  ""life is full of surprises. ... But...you have to accept life as it comes.  Acceptance is the key to surviving the worst situations without losing heart or breaking up. ...Even the worst behavior can be accepted and forgiven if there is no malice.  In fact, must be forgiven so one can go on with life.  It's not necessarily bad to resign yourself to a situation.  In fact, it's essential.  A must for a happy family.  A must for facing life and getting on with it.  Though it may sound negative, acceptance is the only way out of totally unacceptable situations.""  Or better still, it's summed up by a Japanese rendition of Doris Day's ""Que Sera Sera"" sung by the Yamadas.

The Japanese folk tale origins-of finding Noboru via the story of Momotarou (Peach boy) and Nonoko a la Kaguya Hime. (Princess Kaguya) may be lost on foreign audiences, as well as the haiku from Matsuo Basho and Buson.  Nevertheless, this is an enjoyable portrait of the Yamadas.

""I know why we're so peaceful.  Because all three of you are nuts. ... If any one of you were normal, it'd throw off the balance.""-Noboru to his parents and grandmother.",1141948800,12,4007,4.652916073968705
2301000,5,B0009MAO3M,"This quirky comic strip family is lovingly brought to life in Houhokekyo tonari no Yamada-kun (My Neighbors the Yamadas). Mom (Matsuko), Dad (Takashi), Grandma (Shige), Noboru and Nonoko, and family dog Pochi are presented in a series of vignettes, from Matsuko and Takashi's wedding (complete with a dream sequence comparing marriage to a bobsled run and being tossed on stormy seas), to a forgetful day (blame the ginger!), to a hilarious nighttime encounter with motorcycle punks. The animation style is very low-key, taking its visual cues from pen-and-ink comics and a pastel wash. Less is more, as the mere outline of shoji screens and sakura (cherry blossoms) suffices to paint a minimalist picture of modern Japan. Poetry by Basho rounds out each clip. This is a wonderful introduction to Japanese culture, from proper dining etiquette (DON'T dump your rice into your soup :-), to Japanese homes (noren, airing out futons, place settings, traditional food such as miso, tamago, and tempura, changing into slippers when entering homes) wedding ceremonies, and more.

 Some reviewers have mentioned that the stories lack cohesiveness, but I greatly enjoyed this unusual portrait of family life that looked at parent-child relations, marriage, salarymen, and the power of imagination. Although Disney dubbed this with an all-star cast (James Belushi, David Ogden Stiers), I didn't listen to the English dub, so I can't comment on the English cast (I prefer to view anime in the original Japanese with English subtitles to practice my Japanese listening comprehension). A vast departure from other Takahata Isao films (like Grave of the Fireflies), but an enjoyable one nonetheless, particularly if you are already familiar with elements of Japanese culture.",1140652800,20,1762,5.380434782608695
2301001,5,B0009MAO3M,"I really enjoyed this film and was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked. The animation is intentionally sparse and minimalistic, in order to mimic the comic strip. Even though Studio Ghibli used computers for all of the visuals, the movie still had that old-school feel. But it does not look cheap! The director was definitely going for a specific look and feel, and at times uses clever devices to convey a certain mood(think Furi Kuri but more raw). Rather, it reminds you, if you are a fan, of what you enjoyed of the Peanuts animated series, the simplicity, the lack of pretension, the innocence of the characters. Even the score(ah the score), at times feels Vince Gauraldi-esque. I'm not into J-Pop(if the opening tune can be considered J-Pop), but the female vocalist on some of the songs is amazing. The story plays out like a sitcom, with a bunch of episodes about the Yamada family's daily life and inner workings. This one works for all age groups, if you relax and just take it as is, silly, funny and full of heart. After a lot of highly stylized(sp?) animation, I found this one a refreshing change.

The style is more like a comic strip and not the brilliant colors and art of some of the other Studio Ghibli releases. The choice of voice talent, Jim Belushi as the father in particular, is excellent and I think the humorous situations and problems faced by the family transend cultures. While the story and characters are quite humorous, there is additional appeal for people with a knowledge of Japanese culture. What appealed to me in that respect was the clever and subtile use of classic Japanese images, particularly those taken from Hanafuda cards. (I must admit that my wife, who is Japanese, noticed these before I.) Also incorporated are Japanese folk tales to explain where their children originated as well as other litte bits of Japanese culture, some of which I caught while others were first noticed by my wife.

I watched it and what a good movie it was. With all these simple made characters I fell soo much in tune to because I can relate in those funny situations. If you like a good humorous anime that deals with everyday life in a family. This movie is perfect. I would recommended it for anyone that wanted a funny anime to watch. A must see!,1130889600,,475,3.9479166666666665
2301004,5,B0009MAO3M,"My neighbors the yamadas portrays suburban middle class life as it is in Japan or any other part of the globe for that matter. Directed by Isao takahata, this experimental studio ghibli film is unlike any of their previous films. A collection of short vignettes, showing everyday life of yamadas family, My neighbors the yamadas wears a newspaper comic strip look. It lacks all the usual detail, fine lines and photorealistic backgrounds of other ghibli films without losing any depth or appeal. Digitally achieved watercolor wash look works just fine for the style of the film and makes it visually striking and different from any other work studio has ever done.

My neighbors the yamadas is filled with humor, satire, grief and quite possibly everything else a middle class experiences. Everyday life incidents you can relate to and situations you can identify with, mentioning any of which here, may spoil the fun for those who haven't seen the film.

Lets look at the dvd now. My neighbors the yamadas happens to be the only studio ghibli film released by disney as a single disc dvd. Presented in anamorphic widescreen, picture quality of the disc looks absolutely crisp and flawless and so is the sound. As usual, both English and Japanese tracks, rendered in dolby digital 5.1 are available on the disc. English dub featuring the voices of Jim belushi, Molly shannon and others doesnt disappoint and is quite decent.  Bonus features include a ""behind the microphone"" featurette (approx 6 minutes) showing the english dubbing process and original trailers and tv spots which run a little more than 15 minutes. Fans of rough animation would be delighted to see the first trailer, which shows one complete segment from the film in line drawings without any colors filled. Movie has been rated PG for mild thematic elements.

Only disappointing thing, few may find, about this disc is the storyboards. Unlike all previous ghibli releases, there's no entire storyboard version of the film here. Instead, for some strange reason, it is a gallery of tiny sketches which you cant even enlarge. Inspite of it all, a worthwhile disc and a great buy too, just for the main feature itself.

With an experimental film like my neighbors the yamadas, studio ghibli has once again proved how versatile their artists are and how simple, yet unusual and globally appealing, their choice of subjects could be. My neighbors the yamadas is a simple and beautiful, fun-filled film without any sugarcoating or modern day formulas.

A great disc to watch and own.",1128470400,9,2547,4.9811764705882355
2301005,4,B0009MAO3M,"If you are expecting a My Neighbor Totoro or Kiki's Delivery Service, you will be disappointed.

This movie is similar to the '70's ""Wait 'til your Father Gets Home"" cartoon that was on in prime time.  It's about a japanese family and it will give you a good feel of what life is like for a normal japanese family (well, a not-so-normal family 8-).

It's funny and touching.  A fun movie but most young kids probably won't get it or like it.",1126828800,4,441,4.341463414634147
2301006,4,B0009MAO3M,"Of all the movies Studio Ghibli has produced, MY NEIGHBORS THE YAMADAS could probably be the most unconventional of them all.  This family comedy feels like a very jarring change of pace for director Isao Takahata, the man who gave us a heartbreaker in GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES and a decidedly foreign yet compelling drama in POM POKO.

For one thing, the feature is not--I repeat, IS NOT--plot-oriented.  It comes across as a series of individual skits involving the titular family in their day-to-day life.  The lack of a narrative may put off people beforehand, but doing so could very well deprive you of a most delightful--and refreshingly original--viewing experience.  Watching how the Yamadas interact and go about life is every bit as poignant, funny, and off-the-walls as real family life can be; not only are we treated to disputes on who gets to watch TV, but we get to see stories such as the youngest sister, Nonoko, getting accidentally left behind at a shopping mall and all the trouble her parents go to in order to find her.  The movie also relishes in silliness and surrealism--especially in the sequences where Mr. Yamada imagines himself as a superhero rescuing his wife and mother-in-law from crooks and the showclosing ""Que Sara Sara"", where the family floats through the sky on balloons.  All these random events unfold at a roller coaster pace.

What I enjoyed most about the movie was the way it looks and sounds.  For YAMADAS, the animation is produced in a newspaper comic strip style, which, given that this is what the movie was based on, is an ingenious match for its nature.  Simplistic scribblings straight out of a serial fill the screen with a charm that is utterly irresistible.  The catchy, tuneful score adds to the essence of the whimsical atmosphere.  Employing bits of famous classical pieces on the soundtrack (such as Mahler's First Symphony, Mendelssohn's Wedding March, and Leopold Mozart's Toy Symphony) is a very inspiring touch.

There was only one thing about the movie that I found very confusing:  at the end of most of the ""segments"" present in the film, we see what appears to be a quote taken from various poets.  I was also unclear about the ""pachinko"" references, and the scene where Mr. Yamada is throwing cards down for his family left me puzzled.  This is obviously a film steeped in Japanese culture--and one that is more likely to be understood by a Japanese speaking audience.

Which brings me to the biggest problem I have with the Disney dub:  while English script writers Eric Garcia and Leo Chu earn points for attempting to remain as faithful to the original material as possible, they do so in exchange for making any effort in presenting this story to a wider audience who would be otherwise unfamiliar with the heavy references to Japanese culture.  That alone makes MY NEIGHBORS THE YAMADAS the weakest of the Disney-Ghibli dubs I have heard thus far.

This is not to say that the dub isn't worth watching, however--on the contrary.  While the script lacks coherency in places--although the writing is very amusing and very entertaining overall--I have no problems with Disney's selection of actors to record the voices.  The incomparable James Belushi takes on the role of Mr. Yamada with exuberance and enthusiasm, and Molly Shannon voices his wife, Mrs. Yamada, with just the right mixture of sweetness and no-nonsense demeanor; the scene where Mr. and Mrs. Yamada argue over who gets to watch the TV is delivered with dead-on comic timing and believability--making this moment one of the dub's best moments.  Young child performers Daryl Sabara and Liliana Mumy play the Yamada siblings, Noboru and Nonoko, whose interactions are so natural that you'll swear that they recorded their lines together--which, as a matter of fact, they did!... well, for the cookie scene, anyway.  Tress MacNeille, a multi-talented voice actress best known for roles in shows such as TINY TOON ADVENTURES and ANIMANIACS, has been cast in many of the Studio Ghibli English productions, and it is a treat to hear her another--she nails the crotchety old Grandma Shige to a T and beyond.  David Ogden Stiers makes a brief appearance in the movie as well, narrating the titles of the various ""segments"" in addition to the verses displayed at the end of each episode.

Most of Disney's Studio Ghibli DVD releases have been two disk-sets, but this one is a single disc set; perhaps this is just as well, because while the visual and aural aspects of the presentation are impeccable as always, there is little in the way of extras--all we have is the same behind-the-microphone featurette we have seen on the other DVD releases (save POM POKO, which, for some reason, didn't have one), storyboards, as well as trailers and TV spots.  At least this is consistent with the other releases, however, so I really can't complain.

Steeped in heavy references to Japanese culture and atypical of animated features mainstream viewers are used to, MY NEIGHBORS THE YAMADAS may have a hard time finding its audience; the film was not a great success in Japan, and at this point it is hard to tell whether it will suffer the same fate in America.  However, it is highly unlikely that folks seeking creativity and something different from the norm will go wrong by discovering this delightfully inventive and charming film.",1125532800,3,5357,4.907982261640798

8063253,3,B0009MAO3M,"Yamadas is a series of slice of life comedic sketches that are very Japanese in context and humor. The animation are art style are mostly minimalistic with impactful changes when the vignettes take outlandish or dramatic turns. Pacing is very much an issue since scenes feel incredibly stretched as you'd wait for something to happen, something to stop happening, or to eventually get to a punchline before moving on to the next incredibly slow vignette. For the runtime of this movie (1hr 44min) you can watch a few episodes of a comedy slice of life anime like Chuunibyou, K-on!, or Maid Dragon.",1519430400,,597,4.862745098039215
8063254,5,B0009MAO3M,"I have an unpopular opinion:
Spirited Away is such a moving film. Nausicaa is a visual masterpiece. Pom Poko is charming beyond words, and so much fun. My Neighbor Totoro is a mesmerizing vision.

And My Neighbors, the Yamadas is my favorite Studio Ghibli movie of all time.

A good portion of what sets Yamadas apart from other Ghibli films, is it is decidedly un-Ghibli. A studio known for grand storytelling, captivating characters, and stunning visual imagery...adapted a gag manga to the big screen. And they did a fine job, indeed. There is no great, overlying story, just slice of life bits of an odd family, not quite what youd call functional entirely, but not completely off the rails. They come off as genuinely human, like most Ghibli characters (even the ones that are notlooking at you, Calcifer), but UNlike many of their other films, they get to be human. Not on some grand adventure, but losing a child in a department store, or getting a girlfriend. On actual human stuff we can more easily relate to, with a sense of humor.

Come for the Ghibli quality, stay because its enjoyable to defy expectations sometimes. And who doesnt enjoy a good laugh?",1517616000,6,1166,4.762376237623762
