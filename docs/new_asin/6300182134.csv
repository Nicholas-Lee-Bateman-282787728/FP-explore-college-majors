This is a must have for any Olivia fan.
You see Olivia performing at her peak in the '80s.
She is so full of energy and shows why she is so loved all around the world.
Why they didn't release this on dvd is beyond me.
The song listing is very good, sort of a greatest hits.
Any Olivia fan will truly be happy with this concert video.",1234224000,,484,5.554054054054054

7804075,5,6300182134,"This is a commercial release of a concert which was broadcast on HBO, where I saw it.  After listening to the original recordings of the songs in the concert, I can only say that those at the live concert got a show with 200% more energy and vitality than any of the recordings.  Olivia was great! Her backup band, led by Tom Scott was also outstanding, and genuinely seemed to be enjoying their time on stage.  Olivia performed all her greatest hits up to that point in time, so the concert serves as a ""Live Greatest Hits"".",992476800,10,525,4.391752577319588
7804076,5,6300182134,"This 18 year old rare masterpiece is super...in qualityand condition...but the real star is 'The One and Only OLIVIA'...Shewas 33 at the time of taping the concert in Utah...And her performance was perfect....First, her class, total presentation, followed by her appearence, staging, 'that Olivia look' and delivery - were all outstanding! Now, three friends and I will have the rare and great opportunity to see her 'live in concert'. All of us are 25 year ONJ fans, excited to say the least and yesterday I received notice that I have been given a 'Backstage Pass', following the concert for a 'Meet and Greet'....A thrill of a lifetime!",954374400,14,639,4.981308411214953
