As she becomes a woman she falls in love with a man she knows she can never have. Throughout her life's journey she faces obstacles of rival jealousy and searches to be loved and accepted. During her journey whatever obstacle comes her way she strives and tries to figure ways around it and how to succeed. This movie is a great drama. All the actors & actresses did an awesome job making you seem it was real. The actual storyline is so believable and well written, that it makes you feel like it is a true story. The set & costumes are amazing and appear very authentic. I also watched the added bonus footage and the director & creator did an awesome job re-creating old Japan and the hanamachi village.",1216857600,,816,4.375
