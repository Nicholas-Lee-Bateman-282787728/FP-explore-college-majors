8469675,5,B005F79QM6,Great movie with a suspenseful story. Great independent film! The actors are really good and the story is intriguing.,1484179200,,117,5.2105263157894735
8469676,5,B005F79QM6,"I really liked this movie a lot. Anyone who liked Goodfellas will love this movie. I loved Kris Lemche in Joan of Arcadia and in an odd way, identified with his character in this movie, just due to facing a lot of hardships over the past few months.  His meltdown was visceral for me and brilliantly played. A definate must watch",1413072000,,329,4.39344262295082
8469677,5,B005F79QM6,"I've been wanting to see this film for a long time now because I am a HUGE fan of Kris Lemche. I love him, he is incredibly sexy. I didn't even realize it was out on dvd until I saw recommendations. I ordered it immediately and it took 3 days to arrive in the mail, which I was super excited about. Amazon always seems to get what I want in the mail at a fast pace. I will continue ordering from Amazon for a long time :) btw, this movie is incredible. YOU MUST WATCH IT. Very good, cannot even think of a word to explain the greatness of this film, def needs more attention to the public eye <3",1330905600,3,595,3.966666666666667
8469678,5,B005F79QM6,"A very entertaining crime thriller that avoids an ""indie"" feel, and could easily be a studio release.  The production values and performances are very good under any standard, and absolutely amazing in light of the ultra low budget for this movie.  A good ensemble cast, but Chris Lemche is particularly attention grabbing when on the screen.  The website directorslive named this movie as one of the top five underground movies of 2011.",1325635200,2,437,5.041666666666667
8469679,5,B005F79QM6,Great Effort which came out ahead of its time.  Maybe it can be re-released as the real times have caught up with it.  Charlize would have been good addition-of course that's always true.  Be sure to check out Mamet's House of Games.  Hope these Guys put together another movie and keep their edge-amazing to think they got this out the door for under a half Mil.,1325116800,2,363,4.454545454545454
8469680,5,B005F79QM6,"Green Guys was an excellent movie! All of the actors did a great job. The theme and energy was prevalent throughout the entire movie. Levi played by Darrel did an awesome job at portraying his character, he kept me on edge. I look forward to more movies from this group of actors.",1323993600,,280,4.403846153846154
8469681,5,B005F79QM6,Very good drama with an up to date theme. Along the lines of Madoff and Petters. Darrel Davenport played his character with great poise and professionalism. Very good direction for a low budget film.,1323648000,4,199,4.882352941176471
