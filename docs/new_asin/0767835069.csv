15639,5,0767835069,"Up until this film I did not have a very positive view of Barbara Streisand's acting ability.  Despite my tendency to hold on to my opinions past their time, I have changed my mind in a dramatic way. This film  undeniably proves that Streisand is a very talented actress. Nolte on the  other hand has always had great potential, even if it hasn't been realized  in every film he appeared in. No need to worry, in ""The Prince of  Tides"" he is tremendous.

This wonderful drama contains  elements of horror and suspense but its strength comes from the romance  that blossoms between the psychiatrist Susan Lowenstein, (Streisand), and  the failing football coach, Tom Wingo, (Nolte).  These two have a chemistry  which draws them together against their will and sucks the audience along  for the ride. Additional complexity, derived from the fact that they are  both married, also enriches the experience.

Because the story is  ostensibly about the struggles Tom goes through as a result of his Sister's  latest suicide attempt, the film often travels back in time. Lowenstein  needs Tom to fill in the blanks about his sister's life so that she can be  better treated. Unfortunately Tom is almost as reluctant to recall his  childhood events as his comatose sister.  This is not at all surprising  when we eventually discover all the details.

We slowly learn,  along with Lowenstein, about a severe and traumatic family history. Three  children, of whom Tom is one, are spiritually imprisoned by an abusive  father and a manipulative, ambitious mother. Their only comfort is in each  other, which is expressed perfectly whenever their parents fight, by their  escape underwater where they hold hands in a ring of love. In the present  though, even this bond has been sundered. Tom's older brother is now dead  and his sister has lived away from him in New York for many years.

There are many sub-plots running through the story. Tom's inability  to deal with his wife, Susan's problems with her son Bernard and her famous  violinist husband, Tom and his Sister's repressed memories and his mother's  attempts to keep it all hidden. Overall it is undeniably a rich and  compelling film. It serves as an example of how good drama can be.",958003200,8,2237,4.8773333333333335
15640,4,0767835069,"Unfortunately, Barbra Streisand got a hold of an absolutely classic Pat Conroy novel and sensationalized her role to position herself for an oscar. While the main storyline is intact, so much of the novel is missing from the film that the viewer is truly cheated. I am not a fan of Babs, but I will give her credit for an excellent acting and production job. It's sad, however, that it had to come at the expense of this momentous story.
There is no one that could have been casted for the part of Tom other than Nick Nolte. He is fabulous and portrays the role of the 'southern male' as well as anyone could. Anyone with a heart for the South should read the book, and then see the film, if it comes on cable.",954460800,3,710,4.266666666666667
15641,5,0767835069,"With one word.....superb!
This is, without a doubt, the greatest motion picture I have ever seen!  Pat Conroy, the books author is a genius in his telling of the southern tale of Tom Wingo, and his New York City romance  with psychiatrist Susan Lowenstien.  Nick Nolte is by far, the best actor  to come out of Hollywood in decades.  This man could have played Rhett  Butler.  Maybe it's because of my love for my native South Carolina, and  the romance I see in New York City, that attracts me to this movie, which I  have watched close to a dozen times.
Barbra Striesand is excellant as  Susan Lowenstien, and her son (by Elliot Gould), who plays Bernard does a  great job as well.
I enjoy just about every aspect of this film, the  intro, the flashbacks, the south in the summer, all of it!  Though the  South Carolina scenes were filmed in the coastal town of Beaufort,  according to Conroy's book Tom & Sally actually reside on Sullivan's  Island, just outside of Charleston.  This area is the most gracious and  beautiful on the planet.  Maybe it's because I come from South Carolina.
Favorite Scene:  The Shrimp Boat shown after Tom and his children go  shrimping with Tom's father, Henry.
Note:  The movie could sure have  bettered itself by cutting down on the overuse of language, in my opinion.
GOD BLESS !

15642,3,0767835069,"I think few people who, like me, had read the book by Pat Conroy would be satisfied with the movie version.  On the positive side, it was well acted, well cast and the script did not stray too far from the novel.  However, so  much was left out that the power and drama of the novel were lost.  Particularly disappointing was the fact that Luke and Savannah, two of the  main characters in the book, barely featured in the movie.  Focussing so  much on the romance between Tom and Lowenstein, only a secondary storyline  in the novel, may have made the story more straightforward but also more  ordinary.  Nick Nolte was great as Tom and I did enjoy the movie, but after  reading the book and knowing what the film could have been I feel a bit  disappointed.  Probably this book would be better adapted for a  mini-series, where more time could be allowed to develop all aspects of the  story.",947203200,4,893,4.459627329192546
15643,4,0767835069,"Though Barbra Streisand kind of gets in the way of her own movie, The Prince of Tides does have some expertly compelling sequences, most chillingly the flashbacks that seriously do justice to Pat Conroy's epic  novel.  Dealing most significantly with the inner child, and the  revelations that can free us, the book and the film successfully engage you  with a rich sense of time and place.  The characters who populate the film  sometimes seem from two different worlds, but I think that is part of the  point.  Kate Nelligan and Jason Gould will surprise you with unusually good  performances, and of course, Nick Nolte does some of his best acting ever  in this film -- the role suits him; even its grander touches seem so - so -  Tom.  The score, by James Newton Howard, swirls symphonically around the  action of this movie, and is achingly beautiful.",945388800,5,856,4.741496598639456
15644,5,0767835069,"...brilliant movie,well made and acted besides the stunning photography. Still thought provoking after 6 viewings. And a film that directed itself apparently for all the attention the academy paid its  director. Nolte does the star turn as does Streisand who was loath to take  on the psychiatrist role but was eventually persuaded by the producers. She  was also reluctant to cast her son Jason who eventually won her over. Kate  Nelligan deserved the nomination for the abusive and exploitative  mother. What a bitch...! An adult movie with adult themes,not for the  faint-hearted.",935971200,,583,5.282608695652174

This movie profoundly helped heal my life when I first watched it over 20 years ago, when I was in therapy and trying to remember memories of my childhood pain.  This movie is able to hit on so many different emotional levels, it appeals to anyone facing emotional pain and always helps me to humbly face my humanity.  I adore all of Pat Conroy's books and I am so sad he has passed, but so grateful he left us his legacy.  Beautiful movie, I can't imagine anyone but a sociopath, brought to tears !

I give this movie two stars only for those reasons. Otherwise, this movie rots. If you are a fan of the book, you should go running in the other direction. The movie should have been named something else because it is an insulting betrayal to the book. First, I read the book and then watched the movie. Huge mistake. IN THE BOOK TOM WINGO ISN'T EVEN THE SO-CALLED PRINCE OF TIDES, LUKE IS! What an egregious affront in a long line of offenses.

""Rather it works its way out of our consciousness over time."" The grip of pain and the liberation that comes when it is released is the theme of The Prince of Tides, directed and produced by and starring Barbra Streisand.

In an Academy Award-caliber performance Nick Nolte plays Tom Wingo, an ex-high school football coach struggling with a failing marriage and middle-age malaise. After his twin sister tries to kill herself in New York City, Tom travels there to see her. Dr. Susan Lowenstein, her psychiatrist, wants him to shed light on their family life. As Tom talks about the past, he reveals a terrible family secret which lies behind his depression, his brother's untimely death, and his sister's suicide attempts.

In adapting Pat Conroy's bestselling 1986 novel for the screen, Streisand has shifted the emphasis from the toxic Wingo family to the brief love affair between Tom and Dr. Lowenstein. Nonetheless, the film does convey the ways in which we are deeply shaped and influenced by our families.

However, in this case it was the equivalent of taking ""The Lord of the Rings"" and turning it into a romance between Aragorn and Arwen with the rest of the novel just being occasionally referred to.

They even change who the Prince of Tides is in the movie!!

This movie may satisfy Streisand fans who have not read the book, or perhaps other people who haven't read the book.  If you read and remember the novel fondly, you will find this movie wanting.",1459209600,,638,4.56140350877193

15797,3,0767835069,"Not as good as I hoped or wanted. The movie is extremely well done. Well acted and directed and Conroy also wrote the screen play. I guess my objection is with Conroy both with this film, this book and some of his others, like the Great Santini. While he does a great job of honestly describing his horrific childhood experiences, I don't care for his Pollyanna, whitewash type endings. It is essential that we come to terms with our issues but that doesn't necessarily mean giving a mea culpa to those responsible all the time, especially if they are not repentant or own their crimes. The ending line that ""In families, there is no crime that can't be forgiven"" is particularly disturbing. I don't think that's true at all. And I think Conroy's tendency to always wrap things with a Rodney King-like bow, doesn't work very well and ruins the impact of his truly courageous work. But looking at Streisand is always pleasant.",1457913600,,925,4.680981595092025

15876,3,0767835069,"The book The Prince of Tides is my all time favorite and  has been since the first time I read it 15 years ago. I finally broke down and watched the movie,  I did enjoy the movie, it was actually better than I thought it would be, Nick Nolte did an excellent job playing Tom Wingo and even Barbra Streisand was a good fit for the character of Lowenstein. However, as I expected this book did not even compare to the movie. I feel like this movie was more about Tom's relationship with Lowenstein, where the novel  was more about the three siblings backstory and childhood. There is so much more to this story then what is portrayed in this film, I have lived in North and South Carolina in small coastal towns my whole life but would have loved for people who haven't had this pleasure to see more of the area in which these children grew up in, would have loved it to have showed more what it is like for kids to grow up on the coast. So many good characters were left out, Luke and Savannah who were big parts of the book we're hardly in the movie at all. I would have loved to see more of these characters in the movie as well as some of the other colorful characters Conroy created brought to life  like Grandpa Wingo and Taletha. I wish someone would remake this movie and add some of these characters and some of the exciting and hilarious scenes from the book, like them breaking into the aquarium and rescuing the porpose,some of grandpas stunts like water skiing and walking up and down the street carrying his cross, Taletha taking the kids coffin shopping would have made a hilarious scene for the movie, they siblings carrying the turtle into the Newberry House, they even took out the backstory of Callanwolde and the way that scene went down was was much more exciting than the book, I could go on and on naming scenes i would have liked to see added to this movie, too bad I'm not a big Hollywood screenwriter lol. The book is so wonderful, through the whole story it seems like you are either laughing or crying, I did not get the same emotions from watching this movie. All in all I would recommend this movie to anyone, definitely worth watching but if you have read the novel be prepared for a little bit of disappointment. I'm only giving this movie 3 stars however it may have scored higher if I was not such a fan of the book. if anyone with the means and ability to do so happens to read this please please please do a remake of this movie based more on the book, they could do so much more than they did with the original version with all the advances we have had in film in technology since the first movie was made, I guarantee if someone went about transferring this story to film the right way it would be an absolute huge a hit!",1434067200,4,2757,4.296153846153846

15901,2,0767835069,"""The Prince of Tides"" is my favorite novel.  This movie has very little to do with the book.

Taking this story out of South Carolina and putting it in New York city was the worst idea in the history of Hollywood until some genius decided to take ""Sex and the City"" out of New York city and move it to Abu Dhabi.

This is also the movie that exposed the severe limits of Nick Nolte's acting abilities.  The only thing worse than his laughably fake and inaccurate southern accent is his ""performance"", which is nothing more than a lesson in how to overact.  He somehow managed to take the Tom Wingo character from the novel and turn him into a completely unsympathetic jerk.

If I hated the movie so much, why 2 stars instead of 1?  Simply put, there are two scenes in this movie worth watching.  The opening scene of the Lowcountry marshland and the last scene showing Nolte driving a car over that same marshland.  Everything in between is simply horrible.  The last person in the world who should have directed this movie was Barbra Streisand.  She is undeniably one of the great talents of our time, but this was a mis-match.  It should have been directed by someone who is from the south and who understands the south.  And Tom Wingo should have been played by a southerner - or at the very least an actor who has mastered the southern accent.

Skip this piece of garbage and read the book.",1424563200,,1394,4.437007874015748

15912,3,0767835069,"Beautiful visuals and an excellent Nick Nolte, just can't make up for the fact that the main character, Luke, who IS the prince of tides, has been pretty much eliminated from the film, to give the character of Lowenstein - a supporting one in the novel, a much bigger role. So the storytelling is confusing. You could easily come out of this film wondering who the prince of tides actually was. It's obvious that the novel has been carefully thought through and adapted, but it's also obvious that Streisand has re-configured the narrative to place herself front and centre. Nobody expected the entire book to be on the screen, but more of everyone else, and a bit less of Streisand, would have made this film much better, and silenced the most critical critics. Streisand is a truely great singer, and a talented director, but I think it could easily have been a better movie.",1416700800,2,877,4.701298701298701

15948,4,0767835069,"I read a review when this movie was released. It claimed that the direction was schizophrenic. Well I decided to see the film and prove that critic wrong. He was right. It was in so, so many ways a great film. The flashback of the rapes handled deftly. It could have been perfection, though...with a little editing. The movie poster needed to be edited. We had ""A Star is Born"". It made money but wasn't very good. This movie is not a love story. The ""love story"" was a contrived by-product of a harrowing psychological tragedy. What we get is Barbra in Daddy's arms again. Enough already. After crossing what are questionable ethical boundaries and having sex with Mr. Wingo, there is this cheesy romp to the cabin in the woods to somehow legitimize this ""relationship"". Edit: Barbra and Nick f**k like animals in the doorway. Cut: to Barbra crossing the street knowing he'll return to his wife. No romp in the woods! The movie would stay hard and dead serious. Also, the pan away in the last frames. ""Lowenstein, Lowenstein"" Bullcrap, Bullcrap  How many Fanny Brice, Yentyl, Daisy Gamble, Dolly (I think) pan aways have we seen. It lost it's appeal. And she's only there by proxy, ""Lowenstein"" Those are the two major reasons I can see that the Academy snubbed her. It was definitely a time when harder movies were in vogue. She got in her own way even when she attempted to get out of her way. It could have been a great film that wasn't a Streisand star turn. She has star turned enough. Barbra's part could have been smaller and much more effective. She might have come across as a temptress, a slut, desperate, but she would have won an Oscar and made a truly Great film for its time.",1407628800,,1690,4.540983606557377

I recently read the book The Prince of Tides and was swept away with the story Pat wrote. A must read. I decided to watch the movie again and it made so much more sense to me after the book.  There is a greater understanding of the personalities and the complexity of the story.  I would rate the movie a 5+ now that I know as the great Paul Harvey used to say "" The rest of the Story""!

15960,5,0767835069,"This Film so reminds me of the Book, that I find it quite palpable and entertaining in it's own right. Although the story is condensed, the most influential elements in the Book remain alive. That is to say the need for forgiveness, which is a Theme that has never been so profoundly probed in film before, I do not sense. Ms. Streisand's Direction and attention to Detail is quite astounding, as this Story is one of balance and harmony amidst tragedy and loneliness. The Musical Score is brilliant, as are the performances. I am thankful that Ms. Streisand opened the door to so many more female Directors, but I am also so very pleased that she chose to Star in it as well. Oscar Worthy Performances and Cinematography enhance the Passion that comes with learning how to forgive, and why. My Thanks to Pat Conroy, the Author of the Book, and Co-Creator of the Screenplay, as well!

I'm a big Pat Conroy fan Nick Nolte a former college football player was exactly the way I imagined Pat Conroy would be his accent, his southern charm, athletic good looks.

The film is more about Nick Nolte character's memories of his childhood, considering that Barbara's character is trying to figure out why Nolte's character twin sister is suicidal.

Speaking of Streisand, she does an excellent job in this film as a supporting actress, but her contributions off the set proved more valuable. The musical score is just right, there were many times where the lighting in the scene amplified the beauty of the shot, and the flow of the film was top notch.

Overall, I can't say enough great things about this movie. Being one of those movies that reveals itself as the story finalizes, it is worth watching multiple times.",1397433600,2,727,4.627906976744186

I realize that when making a movie out of a book, it is not possible to leave everything in the movie...mainly due to time constraints.  However, when key points/characters in the book are downplayed or changed in the movie, it takes something away from the story.

literally any movie I want ranging even way back in the 40's  and that is outstanding in my book. I prefer to order CD's and DVD's, but if they do not have it in DVD form then I will buy it in VCR form and then I can transfer it to a DVD. I have ordered new and used CD's and DVD's and have never had a problem with either one.

I cared for the characters and I felt for their terrible situations. Susan Lowenstein (Played By The Great Barbra Streisand) saves Tom Wingo and by the end of the movie the two are able to return to their troubled, yet bearable lives.

While the book no doubt is fuller and even better, I feel the movie more than held its own (Granted, I Have Yet To Read The Book). I loved the supporting characters like George Carlin and Gould, the real-life son of Barbara Streisand. Streisand was incredible! She showed that she can indeed direct a top tier movie with a top tier cast. I only wish that they had made a cinematic sequal (Like They Did For Godfather & Jurassic Park) because I wanted to know what happens to the characters 10 & 20 years later. What are Tom Wingo's daughters like in the 21st century?

See this movie on DVD and I'm certain most people will like it. I did.

16079,3,0767835069,"of ""Funny Girl"", Barbra Streisand has never been happy with anything less than an epic.  And here we have a Streisand-directed epic.  Her films (when she has a starring role and holds all of the cards) are long, drawn-out pieces that have the tendency to mystify an audience.  ""Prince"" is no exception.

So many unnecessary scenes flog us, beat us up, wear us down.  But it's Barbra.  There is NO connection between her and Nick Nolte, his last good role beofre the DUI and the mug shot heard 'round the world.  He's good enough, but my god I want to slap him in the face for going through all of this soap opera turmoil regarding his twin sister and toying with the idea of leaving his wife and children....

for Barbra.

She screams, she jolts around, she sighs, she moves.  She's supposed to be beautiful, and while she is no classic beauty (was Norma Shearer?) she at least has the decency to photograph and light herself well.  Sometimes too well.

The casting of George Carlin as the gay neighbor is way off base.  First, he isn't gay (in his personal life) and second, he is over-the-top gay and not so very funny for having been encouraged to act that way.  I'm surprised that Sreisand, ever the perfectionist, would have allowed this.

It's a long film, like all Streisand STREISAND films.  She's the star, we bought the ticket, and we'd better sit down, shut up, watch it, and to hell with the popcorn.  It's STREISAND!!!!

It's a magnificent attempt to bring a so-so bestselling novel to the screen.  But like the so-so bestselling novel, this is a so-so film.  And it is sooooo soooooo long.",1337126400,,1603,4.577464788732394
16080,5,0767835069,"This movie is absolutely stunning from beginning to end.  It is cinematography at its very best...  Most everything has already been said here, but I am amazed at the reviews that say the movie varies from the book...  Of course, a movie can never include all of the description and detail of a book, especially one written by Pat Conroy, but Ms. Streisand does a remarkable job of following Mr. Conroy's story and portraying the emotion and deep impact of the events.  It is an abomination that Ms. Streisand was not nominated for an Academy Award as Best Director or Best Actress when the movie received so many other awards.  How does one make a movie of this caliber and not receive a nomination for directing?!?

I have never been a fan of Nick Nolte, but his sensitive performance in this movie is beyond incredible. Another reviewer stated that he lit up the screen, and he did...  He IS the Tom Wingo in Pat Conroy's novel. Together, Nolte and Streisand are perfection... and this is one of my top favorite movies of all time....",1335312000,,1037,4.603260869565218
16091,3,0767835069,"Directed by Barbra Streisand, who becomes Nick Nolte's Psychiatrist and eventual love interest, this cardboard cut out of a psychodrama does occasionally manage to rise above the category of dull and contrived. With so many predicable twists in its Freudian laden tropes, little is left to the aware viewer's imagination.

Nolte is a Southern divorcee and gentleman to be, running away from a cramped married life made even more miserable by a hidden family past involving a rape and murder, and a sister who mentally did not manage to survive it all. Streisand, using all of her Jewish New York savvy, business charm and a tool kit full of Freudian 101 psychoanalytic techniques, plus a predictable bad marriage, manages to both seduce and cure her handsome troubled Southern client. And in the process he is able to help his sister return her life to a semblance of sanity and normalcy.

Although the acting is much better than the script, which is thin, with a plot packed full of painfully predictable mini-Freudian psychodramas, it is nevertheless and interesting movie. Nolte at least gets to stretch his acting skills out well beyond the normal ""silent hard-drinking tough guy"" roles he is so used to. Three Stars",1327363200,,1220,4.9754901960784315

16094,5,0767835069,"The 1992 awards speak to the excellence of this work of art: 7 Oscar Nominations, including Best Picture, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Original Score, Best Art Direction, Best Actor (Nick Nolte), and Best Supporting Actress (Kate Nelligan).  Why Barbra Streisand was snubbed for a Best Director nomination is a mystery, but she was nominated for a Golden Globe and by the Directors Guild of America.  Nolte also won the Golden Globe for his exemplary performance.

Nick Nolte is in top form as coach Nick Wingo, a man in trouble with the present and tormented by his past.  His talent lights up the screen.  The acting doesn't skip a beat as the other characters in the movie come to light: Barbra Streisand, Blythe Danner, Kate Nelligan, Jeroen Krabb, George Carlin, Jason Gould and Brad Sullivan are all at the top of their game.

Streisand's character, Dr Susan Lowenstein, helps Coach Wingo discover himself by forcing him to face his past.  Along the path, Wingo also opens Lowenstein eyes to aid her in viewing her own personal demons.  And, of course, love ensues.  The relationships are intricate and story is dynamic.

Streisand also worked long and hard to bring some of the world's best musicians together to record the original soundtrack and her efforts paid off immensely.  The music is nothing less than brilliant from beginning to end.

Bottom line: if you're looking for an uparalleled drama with a great cast, unequaled storyline and superb direction, you don't have to search beyond ""The Prince of Tides"".",1285200000,3,1538,4.988235294117647
16095,5,0767835069,"I remember seeing this movie on the big screen shortly after its Christmas 1991 release and being instantly captivated by every scene.  The Prince of Tides was so well done that it held my full attention throughout all 2+ hours.  As a viewer I experienced a vast array of emotions such as compassion, inspiration, sadness, shock, and wonder.

I liked everything about this movie.  First and foremost, the acting was superb.  Nick Nolte deservedly won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama.  (He should have won the Academy Award for Best Actor as well IMO.)  Nolte's portrayal of the very complex yet down-to-earth and likeable Tom Wingo was nothing short of magnificent.  Don't be surprised if you shed a tear or two after the last flashback scene, when Tom's defenses finally crumble as he lets himself experience the childhood pain he had kept locked up for so long.  Barbra Streisand also delivered a wonderful performance as devoted psychiatrist Dr. Susan Lowenstein.  Strong and self-assured, she has no problem standing up for herself when confronted by Tom's tantrums; sad and vulnerable, she allows the layers of her own insecurities to peel away as she falls in love with him.

Other noteworthy performances include those of Kate Nelligan, Blythe Danner and George Carlin.  Oscar-nominated Kate Nelligan brilliantly portrays Lila Wingo Newbury, the high-strung and status-hungry mother of Nolte's character.  Nelligan is stunning as a young mother in the flashback scenes and looks convincingly older in the present setting (kudos, makeup and wardrobe crew).  Blythe Danner was perfect as Tom's frustrated wife Sallie, a character deserving of compassion in her own right.  Comedian George Carlin plays Eddie, the gay and caring neighbor of Tom's suicidal twin sister Savannah.  Carlin is commended for conveying his character's sexuality with a bit more subtlety than flamboyance and for playing his dramatic scenes as wonderfully as his comedic ones.

In addition to the superb performances, The Prince of Tides contains one of the most memorable scores in a motion picture.  James Newton Howard's background music in a number of scenes creates just the right touch.  Its careful, creative blend of instrumentals enhances the film's various moods - awe, heartache, romance, etc.  (I highly recommend purchasing the soundtrack, which also features Ms. Streisand's heartwarming single ""Places that Belong to You,"" not included in the movie itself.)  The cinematography in this film is simply incredible.  Wondrous scenery of lakes, rivers and marshes, as well as sunrises and sunsets, will take your breath away.  Indeed, producer/director Barbra Streisand is to be praised for all the work she did behind the camera as well as in front of it.

It is a pity that this DVD contains no documentaries surrounding this Oscar-nominated movie, but the movie itself more than makes up for the absence.  The Prince of Tides is a pure joy to watch, an emotional experience like no other.  For viewers who were raised in a dysfunctional family, the film is particularly meaningful:  it will inspire you to let go of past hurt, learn from it, grow stronger, and set yourself free to love yourself and live a happier life.",1282780800,3,3243,5.1393129770992365

16098,3,0767835069,"This film, while good, just doesn't tell the same tale that its namesake novel did. The film includes the bare bones of the original story, yet little in the way of its power and grace, mostly because far too much is cut out and replaced with the romance that was mainly subplot in the book. The novel was not a romance so much as the telling of a life, whereas the film is a romance with the man's life story used as a reason for the lovers to meet and fall in love. I feel that this is yet another film that makes the mistake of assuming that the viewer has already read the book. Far too many films based on novels do that, and while in this particular film the assumption doesn't completely ruin it, its still a bad thing.

What is mainly, and I feel, sadly, missing are Tom's (the main character)flashbacks of his childhood. Whereas in the book we are shown so many beautiful, terrible, and awe-inspiring scenes of this man's past, those scenes are reduced to a mere handful in the film. These flashbacks are so very important to the story that without them, there's something and obviously missing. The viewer who hasn't read the book won't really know what they're missing, but they should feel it. We never really get to know Luke, the strong and wild older brother, beyond two or three scenes of violence. A beautiful and painful scene from the book, where Luke and Tom go to New York to see their sister Savannah, is sorely missing here. It shows us that Luke is truly gentle and caring, not really meant for or understanding the cruelty of the world. We also miss an integral scene about a Jewish neighbor that explains why Savannah pretends to be Jewish, and shows her kindness and empathy. His death, a major plot element in the novel, is barely touched upon in the film. I also feel that the way the role of Luke's tiger was pared down was wrong. The tiger represented Luke's wildness, his fearlessness, and again, showed his discomfort with humanity. Luke would rather have been with the tiger that he understood than man. I'm trying not to spoil the novel for those who haven't read it, but the tiger played a much, much larger part in the novel.

The cast redeemed much of the film for me. If it hadn't been excellent, I think this film would have bombed. Nick Nolte did a fabulous job portraying Tom's special mix of wit and simplicity, his sense of humor, and his deep, deep pain. He caused me to fall in love with Tom as Susan did. Barbara Streisand was also great as Susan Lownstein. If she wasn't, I don't think I could have watched the film, since she was given so much screen time. Melinda Dillon as Savannah was perfect, giving us the feeling of fragility, madness, talent and grace that was evident in the novel; Kate Nelligan as Tom and Savannah's selfish, grasping mother was excellent, and Blythe Danner was also great, though not used enough.

My major gripe with the film was the gross enlargement of Susan's (Savannah's psychiatrist, played by Barbara Streisand, and who also directed and produced the film) part and her relationship with Tom. It just wasn't that important in the novel, though I don't think I would have minded it if it wasn't there in place of Tom's flashbacks and his relationship with his siblings. I didn't really want the film to be a romance, and that's what is. It's not bad, but it's not ""The Prince of Tides"".",1265241600,18,3368,4.518032786885246

I've never heard of a psychiatrist quite like this one: she spends months trying to figure out what's wrong with Nolte's sister, by talking to Nolte? This doesn't happen in real life.

16106,2,0767835069,"I can't help but wonder how good this film may have been had it had another director, maybe one more attentive to the nature of the story.  Instead, actress/singer/director Barbara Streisand helms this picture, and she does a lot more damage than good.  Instead of creating a film that is rooted in raw emotion and heartbreaking tragedy she turns this film into a longwinded soap opera with over-the-top acting and `romance novel' style dialog.  In fact, the last quarter of the film is so ridiculous that I seriously wanted to vomit amidst all the saccharine facileness.

The film tells the story of Tom Wingo, a southern `good ol' boy' who is troubled by a dark family secret, a secret that has pushed his sister to attempt suicide.  While she lies in a hospital room, Tom ventures to New York and meets his sister's psychiatrist Susan.  Tom is apposed to his sister seeing a shrink, but the more he sees Susan the more he begins to open up, about his life, his wife, his mother and eventually uncovering the family secret that has haunted him for so many years.

The idea behind the film is a good one in my opinion (I have not read the book, although I don't hear good things about it so I don't think I will) but the handling of the material really sidelines the film in my opinion.  Instead of taking a raw and emotional approach to the film, the soap operaish delivery makes light of the tragedy surrounding the film and ultimately turns the serious subject of abuse, suicide and murder into a joke.  All of this weighty material is more or less just a backdrop for Tom and Susan to fall in love and in the end the film makes their relationship the weightiest subject; expecting the audience to swell up with tears at the prospect of them having to leave one another as apposed to the audience being emotionally responsive to the turmoil boiling within Tom's past.

The acting doesn't really help the matter.

I am not a fan of Nick Nolte.  I never have been and never will be.  He has really only delivered a few (countable on one hand) good performances, and this is not one of them.  His over-the-top delivery of Tom's emotions is comical to say the least.  He has one good scene, when he finally breaks down and exposes his past.  It's the only scene where his emotions seem real, and it's the only respectable `scene' in the film (which ends up getting ruined by the overly sentimental `cry in my bosom' closing).  Streisand is better than Nolte, but too clichd.  The only good acting comes from the supporting cast, notably Blythe Danner (who is sorely underused) and Kate Nelligan (who received an Oscar nomination for her performance).  They are not enough to save the film, but they at least prove to add some interest to their scenes.

In the end I can honestly say that `The Prince of Tides' is a missed opportunity, which I think is what makes the sting of the films failure hurt all the more.  It could have been so deep and haunting but instead comes off vapid and hollow.",1219968000,,2993,4.526022304832714
16107,4,0767835069,"I haven't read the book, so my review is based solely on the movie.
I avoided watching it for a long time because I had read so many conflicting reviews. I now realize that every negative review I read has one or both of the following in common: The reviewer hates Barbra Streisand, or the reviewer thinks that, if the movie doesn't follow the book exactly, the movie is bad. Occasionally, someone will mention something else, such as a dislike of Nick Nolte or of George Carlin, but most of the negative reviews are based in those first two biases.

Fortunately, I admire Ms. Streisand, and I understand that a movie must, by its very nature, differ from the book it is based on. In some cases (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-Fidelity/dp/B00003CXGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High Fidelity</a>, for example--wonderful movie, terrible book), the movie is better.

In this case, the author of The Prince of Tides co-wrote the script, so he had every opportunity to make sure that the story he was telling was true to his book, even if it wasn't a blow-by-blow exact replica.

I am so glad I saw this movie. I feel as though my life is enriched because of it. From the opening moments, I knew I was in very capable hands. The acting, directing, photography, dialog--everything in this movie is among the best there is. There is not one false step in this movie.

A lot is said in finely nuanced facial expressions and through body language--the kind of acting that is a notch above ordinary fare. Some of the topics dealt with are quite intense, and yet somehow Barbra Streisand as a director manages to handle them deftly, neither overdramatizing them nor underplaying their significance. This movie deserved every Academy nomination it got, plus one for director, and should have won far more than it did.

16110,4,0767835069,"I have not read Pat Conroy's book but I plan to.  You will note that he wrote this screen play.  This movie was quite intense.  I did have a problem with the psychiatrist (Barbara) sleeping with her patient.  Barbra's wardrobe would have been professional, had the skirts not been short. I also had some problems with the way Nick Nolte's character was played.  I lived in South Carolina for 20 years and found many of Nick's traits to be outlandish and not typical of a southern man.  Yet, Tom Wingo (played by Nick) wasn't just playing a southern man; he was playing a severely traumatized man.

I gave this movie a 4 star rating because I was awestruck by the way in which Barbra Streisand played various facets of the psychiatrist role - cool and professional at the beginning, tough as nails to protect the life of her suicidal patient, quiet and analytical with Tom, asking the right questions, putting the pieces together (Savannah's ""splinter that festers"") and, finally, showing so much compassion.  The scene where she held Tom when he cried was priceless. In this fantasy world, Barbra held the person who was hurting.  People who hurt that badly need to be held.  This probably doesn't happen a great deal in real life because of professional boundary concerns or sexual harrassment worries.  There are many Barbra Streisand movies I have not seen, but her acting in this movie showed so much versatility.  I don't think any another actress could have portrayed love, compassion, sorrow, and loss with such intensity.",1201219200,,1529,4.838461538461538

16122,4,0767835069,"Barbra Streisand's second film as a director is also her most successful, most well-liked, and by far her most oscar-nominated.  It isn't hard to see why, as the film tackles the near-universal topic of dysfunctional family life, and how it ends up effecting other families as time goes on.

At the same time, this film has many controversies and flaws to it.  Many fans of the novel condemn Streisand for totally changing the story around, and attempting to make the movie more about her character, Susan, when originally her role was not quite as central.  It is also (agreeably) criticized for implying that revealing a secret repressed with just magically make everything better.

As far as flaws go, most of them come in the form of bad casting and unrealistic performances.  The biggest miscast was Barbra's son, Jason Gould, as her son, wannabe football player Bernard.  He comes across far too dorky and does not have the proper body to be completely believable as a football player.  The other major problem is Barbra Streisand's performance as a psychiatrist.  It has to be said that the way she acts is extremely unprofessional behavior for a psychiatrist.  Real psychiatrists don't get confrontational, talk to their patients like they are stupid, yell at their patients, and certainly do not become friends with/date their patients.  But you could argue that that is just something you need to suspend disbelief on.

Those flaws mentioned and ranted about, there are plenty of strong aspects to the movie.  For one, the photography is just stunning, with some stunning scenery, sunsets, and even Barbra Streisand herself, looking very lovely, and difficult to take your eyes off of.  Another strong point, perhaps what saves this production, are the fantastic performances.  Nick Nolte, Kate Nelligan, and Blythe Danner especially give truly raw performances as complex, emotional, and not always likeable people.  But nobody, not even Streisand and her son, gives a terrible performance.  Finally, the storyline is very involving and heartbreaking, and even the romance between Nolte and Streisand, while a little more prevalent than it should be, is very touching.

Though nominated for many Academy Awards, it isn't hard to see why it won zero.  When watched today, it has the feeling of a Lifetime tv-movie, and I'm sure the Academy felt that what could have been a raw, educational look at psychiatry and coming to terms with your past was made into not much more than a soap opera.  But still, this is a very engrossing film that, love it or hate it, will stick with you.  Not destined to be a classic, but good nonetheless.",1195257600,2,2643,4.988584474885845

Barbra Streisand directed, & her first rule was ""Any shot I'm in is MY shot, so make sure I dominate that scene"". Melinda Dillon was OK, but Gwyneth Paltrow would have been far better. Of course, it's such a big, rich book that a mere commercial theatrical release could never do it justice, however, looking at this film dispassionately, Tom Wingo was the only character I cared about.

The cynical, distant Nick Nolte goes to NYC after his twin sister (played by Melinda Dillon) there tries to commit suicide. He begins seeing her psychiatrist (Barbra Streisand) and through flashbacks we learn about the demons of his family's past - all of which he's learned to suppress his whole life. Conveniently Nolte's wife (Blythe Danner) takes up with another man while Nolte is falling in love with Streisand; at the end he returns to his wife though he still loves Streisand. Nolte is excellent in his role, and as is often the case when he's on screen, his persona dominates every scene he's in; Streisand is fairly bland in comparison. The movie begins to show its weaknesses after Nolte and Streisand fall in love: where the movie should be exploring their love and ""obligations"" in a hard, meaningful way, it only goes soft and paisley romantic. Why Nolte goes back to his wife, why she even wants him back, is hardly touched on; instead we get the throwaway lines, ""You love her more,"" says Streisand; ""No,"" replies Nolte, ""just longer.""

I remember finding it a fascinating film at the time which even prompted me to read the book and discover the writing quality of Conroy.  Unlike most such situations when I am disappointed by movie adaptations of great books, I found both genres to have their own beauty.  This past weekend I was loaned a copy of Prince of Tides and I spent a leisurely 2 hours enjoying this masterpiece for a second time.  Flashbacks are beautifully interspersed with real time discoveries.  Characters to love, hate, envy, pity and laugh with abound.  What impresses me most about this film is the impeccable way you find yourself switching from the lifestyle of the coastal south to the frenzy of New York City.  All cinematic elements combine to take you back and forth in time and location as the characters experience their pasts and make new memories for the future.  Nolte was brilliant.  Streisand was lovely as an actress and obviously gifted as director.  Blythe Danner was touching and talented as always, and the passage of time reveals the beauty both inner and outer she has bestowed on her daughter Gwyneth Paltrow.  Buy this film and plan an evening of enjoyment whether you are male or female, young or old.  The passage of time has done nothing to dim the quality of this film.

The biggest thing i have against this movie is what people say about it, it is not a chick flick, nor a ""Tear-Jerker"" Yes it is very emotional, but the story is not about the love between the two main characters, it is about the redemption of Nick Nolte's character. This film is in my opinion the best film of Streisand's for any man to watch. It has managed to discuss something that most men have a hard time discussing; Their emotions!!

I played this for my father, who is forty-six, and it is his favorite film. Anyone who is beyond sterotypes and can respect the story, and the man's situation, and not afraid of a little love and emotion, should love this film.

This is Nick Nolte's best film, and he has not done anything after this that even comes close. That goes for Streisand, Krabb, and George Carlin. They are well casted, and their performances make this film a very memorable one.

This film is not for anyone who thinks women are the only ones who watch love stories, and guys are the only ones who enjoy the Terminator.",1113696000,,1303,4.485232067510548
16147,4,0767835069,"In only her second directorial effort (after ""Yentl""), Barbra Streisand proves to be a masterful storyteller with an almost exaggerated romantic sensibility and an unfettered preoccupation with psychoanalysis.  She obviously found the perfect vehicle in Pat Conroy's epic novel about Tom Wingo, a Southerner whose failing marriage and career reflect a deep suppression of an abusive childhood, the memories of which are triggered by his twin sister's suicide attempt. That the story revolves around a man's personal crisis versus a woman's may strike some as odd given Streisand's particularly female perspective, but she actually makes Tom's complex personal journey resonate with greater sensitivity as a result. In fact, the emotionalism Streisand invests in her musical performances is very much in evidence here, and her lush, almost Baroque style fits the contours of this soap opera very well.

The 1991 movie is helped immeasurably by a galvanizing performance from Nick Nolte, who captures all the layers of pride, regret, anger, sadness and humiliation in his character. He propels the storyline with the unbridled passion of an actor sinking his teeth into a juicy part as only a female director could define it. In fact, Streisand steps back to play the subordinate role of Dr. Susan Lowenstein, the pricey New York psychiatrist treating Tom's sister, Savannah. Granted, she does make herself rather beatific even in her high skirts and flimsy blouses, but such expectations come with Streisand as she basically plays Tom's savior. At the same time, it is probably her most subtle work onscreen even with the touches of excess that often detract from her performances. She also hands out plum parts to both the wonderful Kate Nelligan, who gets to age convincingly as Tom's upwardly driven mother with a dark secret, and Blythe Danner, dependably effective as Tom's conflicted wife. Both especially excel in their revelatory conversations with Tom, the dialogue insightful without delving too much into psychobabble. Credit should be given to Conroy and Betsy Johnston, who wrote the superb screenplay. Melinda Dillon has little to do as Savannah except look traumatized, which she does well. And in a not too subtle display of nepotism, Streisand's son, Jason Gould, sullenly plays the doctor's son, a musician-in-training who is coached on the finer points of football by Tom.

The movie is not without flaws. First, there is a critical scene where Tom confesses to Lowenstein (as Tom calls her) what exactly happened in his childhood that none of the Wingos have been willing or able to share with anyone else.  Because of Streisand's effective juxtaposition of the long-ago violent crime with the present-day therapy session and Nolte's superb work, this is an especially powerful sequence. It feels climactic in nature given the depth of the catharsis we have been presented at that point, but the problem is that it comes about 45 minutes before the end of the movie. It is around this point that the story shifts to an inevitable affair between Tom and Lowenstein following a tense, pretentious dinner party with Jeroen Krabbe holding court as her psychologically abusive husband, a world renowned violinist out to humiliate Tom. Consequently, we are given a flagrant detour into Lowenstein's own catharsis, which brings up valid questions about her character's professionalism in even having an intimate relationship with a patient. This part of the story is Streisand at her most self-indulgent as both director and actor, as we follow these two smitten people on gauzy romantic walks and sweaty lovemaking by candlelight. Luckily the film recovers toward the end before any serious damage is done. Special mention should be made of the beautiful cinematography by Stephen Goldblatt, who perfectly captures the burnished aura of the lowlands of South Carolina, and the symphonic, often swooning score by James Newton-Howard. It's an impressive accomplishment to translate Conroy's lengthy, often florid narrative into a cohesive movie that retains the major themes of its source material, and Streisand has done a splendid job in pulling it all together.",1111017600,5,4175,5.292609351432881

16149,1,0767835069,"Ok, ok, the scenery is beautiful, Nick Nolte is a great actor, but I still can't understand why this movie was so highly acclaimed.  I thought it was a pain to watch.  Plus, the ""moral"" of the story seems to be ""Have an illicit affair...it's good for you, and it's good for your marriage.""
  My other gripe about this film is that much of it seems centered around the glorification of Streisand and of the character she plays.  The film seems to be singing out, ""Look at me. I'm hot. I'm brilliant. I'm irresistable...and I heal people.""  Yep, this character's only flaw seems to be that she didn't pick a husband as perfect as herself. I take that back--she can heal people, but not her son.
  Anyway, I have a list of films labeled ""don't bother"" but I had to put this one in a new category: ""don't watch. seriously.""",1105228800,7,819,4.413333333333333
16150,5,0767835069,"Streisand's semi-controversial adaptation of THE PRINCE OF TIDES may not have completely satisfied fans of the book, however, the general public fell instantly under the film's hypnotic spell - and turned it into a surprise box office smash! The decision to keep the film's focus in the present rather than the past results in the elimination of most of the novel's lengthy backstory. However, the well-condensed script (written by Conroy himself and Becky Johnson) manages to seamlessly fill in the missing information, and allows all central characters to reach a level of character development that is unusually high for a mainstream Hollywood film. As the film progresses, these characters seem especially real, and they are embodied by an absolutely flawless cast.

As anyone who has read the book can attest, the characters of Tom and Lila Wingo would seem to be extremely challenging (if not almost unplayable) roles, both of which are brimming with contradictions and hidden emotions. However, Nick Nolte and Kate Neligan find the perfect balance in their portrayals, which earned them both well-dissevered Oscar nominations. Blythe Danner, Jason Gould, and Melinda Dillion all also turn in memorable performances, even though Dillion's Savannah (a lead character in the novel) has precious little screentime due to the film's structure. Barbra also gives an affecting portrayal, however, the director's chair is where she really shines this time. With it's moving storyline, compelling characters, and breathtakingly beautiful cinematography, THE PRINCE OF TIDES is film that will continue enchant audiences for years to come.

About the DVD: The picture quality and sound are excellent, although it's disappointing that the many extras (which included a featurette, deleted scenes, a gag reel, and Streisand's full-length commentary track) that were included on Criterion's special edition laserdisc release are not found on this DVD.

In 1991, I was appalled by Ms. Streisand's miniskirts and in particular her pink sweater cut SO low in the back. The wardrobe wasn't appropriate for one Dr. Lowenstein. The wardrobe was clearly a vehicle for one reluctantly aging pop star.
Also, the music was so loud, so epic at times that I literally had to cover my ears. In one scene Blythe Danner left the room, but you could still see her reflection in a picture on a wall, waiting for her cue.

The storyline is excellent, with appropriate twists and turns and twists.
The problem with the film is this: it builds itself as a large, cinematic film, with it's grand music and it's seamless editing, and long sequencing.  And the film simply is not that: the music and editing are especially innapropriate, tinting the film to grand cinema, while it is actually rather dark and trimmed.

This is a love story with plenty of treakle but more than an ounce of vinegar as Tom and Lowenstein hit things off, become lovers, but ultimately part company forever to resolve their differences with their respective spouses.
Columbia Tristar has given us a truly awful looking print of this film.  Colors are muddy and undistinguished.  Everything takes on an orange characteristic that is unbecoming to the story.  Night scenes suffer from low contrast levels.  Aliasing, shimmering and edge enhancement are all present throughout the print.  Fine grain elements and regular wear and tear have not been cleaned up for this presentation either.  Flesh tones are inaccurately rendered, either too orange or too pink.  There's a considerable loss of fine detail throughout, presumably because of noise reduction equipment used in mastering the print.  The soundtrack is dated, strident, unnatural sounding and very tinny.  It's 2.0 but almost sounding mono in spots while presenting the music at very boisterous listening levels that intrude on an otherwise very subdued audio presentation.  No extras - big surprise.  Columbia's penny pinching started with this release.  You can see where it's lead to by examining my reviews of ""The Awful Truth"" or ""Talk of the Town"".

16157,5,0767835069,"Actually, the sentence in the title is not mine; the author of the book Pat Conroy was so grateful for the film that he gave the director such a name...
Conroy must have realised limitations of a film in comparison with the book. ""The Prince of Tides"" book is rather thick and to make a two-hour movie out of it is difficult. The film ""Cider House Rules"" was also criticised of being too thin in comparison with the book -- and, in fact, the author John Irving himself wrote the script.
Romantic side is highlighted over a complex, dark family story, with Streisand enjoying the starring female role to the full. She does so alongside the great performance by Nick Nolte, who plays Tom Wingo, a teacher from American South hiding much of his painful past until he gets familiar with New York psychiatrist Susan Lowenstein (Streisand).
The film love story between Wingo and Lowenstein is one of the most memorable of the past decades, yet the picture also encompasses deep social undertones -- suicide, hypocrisy, lack of family understanding. There is a couple of memorable scenes; the most special one comes when Wingo finally lets the demons of the past out -- this is acting at its best on both Nolte's and Streisand's part. Although some other films also attempted something similar (e.g. ""Good Will Hunting"", with Matt Damon and Robin Williams), it never was so powerful as here. The ending is bittersweet, not typically romantic but ultimately inevitable and logical for the story.
Beautiful cinematography and great musical score to a large extent made this film to achieve five stars in my book. I know I will keep on returning to ""The Prince of Tides"" video.",1043452800,19,1667,4.791666666666667

The truth is that you just can not build the story lines because of time restraints, etc in a movie that you can throught the printed page. I agree with several other reviewers that if this work were a miniseries it may have been able to follow several very good story lines from the book that were left out or only made mention of in the movie.(I think it would have been a great series).
All that being said, I still think it is movie worth the time of watching. It is touching. It is funny, It will pull you into the lives and loves of the main characters. The story line is true to the novel, although it is not as full as I would have liked. I thought that Nick Nolte was wonderful as Tom Wingo the story teller of the book. He captures well the southern fire of the lead character. In my estimation, this is the best acting job that I have seen Barbara Streisand do. She was passionate and compelling. The supporting cast was also very good. The movie contrast well the power of love's ability to build up and to tear down.

This is a wonderful film, one that dances back and forth in time, that does an unusually good job at translating a complex and convoluted story to the screen quite magically, and one that is not only plausible but also breath-taking in its import and seriousness. One comes away recognizing the growth in Nolte's character and applauding the way the whole story fits together and is so believable.

The Prince of Tides is NOT just about the love story between Tom and Susan, it is also about growing up in the South and living amongst a dysfunctional family of abuse and social problems. There was absolutely nothing about Luke in the movie. Which by the way is the REAL Prince of Tides. Tom Wingo (Nolte) is NOT the Prince of Tides as stated in the movie.

Yet, while the book was a spellbinding page-turner, I found myself squirming through much of the film, especially once Barbra Streisand's nails began taking on a life of their own.  The character she portrays is quite secondary in the book, yet here is a central focus, as could be expected.  That said, Nick Nolte is fantastic in a role that earned an Oscar Nomination, and the supporting cast is uniformly fine throughout.  Also, as a director, Striesand does capture some moments of pure blissful perfection that made this an Oscar worthy best film nominee in 1991.  But, there are crucial elements of prose missing from the plot, and I found myself confused by unncessary devices like therapy sessions that showcase la Streisand in place of the story that needed to be told.  Martin SCorcese would have OWNED this film had he directed it.  Streisand, on the other hand, manages to inspire and cajole, but ultimately falls flat when trying to make sense of the characters.  To be sure, she is one of the few Legends when it comes to filmmaking and acting, but ""The Price Of Tides"" pales by comparison to other noteworthy efforts like ""Yentl.""

16172,4,0767835069,"The events of ""The Prince of Tides"" play out in such a fashion that one tends to forget how soapy and melodramatic they really are. What begins as one man's emotional awakening to the events of his past in an attempt to help his sibling generates into a run-of-the-mill romance easily found in the pages of any Harlequin novel. And yet, through acting zeal and its abidance by the rules of tearjerkers, this film actually pays off in a weird sort of way.
At the center of the story is Tom Wingo (Nick Nolte), a middle-aged Southern football coach with a wife and three children. The film's calendar art opening sequence serves to show his childhood in an appealing light, yet his adult life is anything but enjoyable. His wife is estranged from him, put off by his humorous approach to serious situations and by his unwillingness to discuss the pitfalls of their marriage. When his mother, whom he clearly despises, informs him that his sister Savannah has attempted suicide again, he heads off to New York City, where he will meet with her psychiatrist, Dr. Susan Lowenstein (Barbra Streisand), to help her unlock the pain in Savannah's subconscious.
The story's change in setting and story is the decision point for audiences, who can either accept the drama and enjoy it, or groan at the segue from the suicide angle to a romance storyline. Once in New York, Tom begins revealing events from his childhood to Lowenstein, who listens with a caring ear, perhaps more caring than the ethics of her career would allow. As their relationship begins to deepen, Tom reveals more to her, including a carefully guarded secret known only by his two siblings and mother, as well as his feelings for her.
A heads up of what to watch for in this movie: its well-structured plot, which, despite its melodramatic subject matter, weaves a fine web of love, hate, revelation, and the courage to overcome hardships. The romance that eventually takes flight between Tom and Lowenstein is run-of-the-mill, from their shared family discord to their realization that it cannot last forever. Even still, these aspects are given some vitality: Tom agrees to help her son become a football player, and later antagonizes her haughty celebrity husband at a dinner party in one of the film's most memorable scenes. The bittersweet ending has been done countless times before, but it's helped by the fact that we have come to like the characters and can appreciate, if not comprehend, their situation.
Even more interesting is the way in which Tom slowly begins to break down. As his resolve begins to fade, he breaks into new emotional ground, letting go of the hardships he has been holding inside all of his life. His family life is revealed in gritty detail, all of which provides reason for the attitudes he holds to presently. And when it comes time for him to break down and face his torments, we believe in his emotion because of his experiences. This is the kind of character we can come to care about deeply, through his many realizations and reawakenings.
Kudos to the cast, which is stellar all around. Nolte shines as Tom, giving a powerful performance full of convincing emotion and forceful dialogue. Streisand's role as Lowenstein is good enough, better than most give her credit for; she gets the job done in front of and behind the camera with serviceable results. Add to this a supporting cast that includes Blythe Danner as Tom's wife, Kate Nelligan as his mother, and Streisand's own son, Jason Gould, as her character's son, and you have a truly becoming cast that adds zest and freshness to the script.
Some may not think that this is enough for ""The Prince of Tides"" to work, but in a way, it is. With a story that jumps from place to place, much like that of a soap opera, the cast is able to chew on the material with terrific gusto, making the changes of pace, setting and story easier to stomach. It's not a completely original piece, yet there is an appeal in its cliched romance, and a strong depth of feeling behind its characterization and human story. On this, the movie is a success.",1008028800,14,4091,4.73109243697479
16173,4,0767835069,"I loved the book, I loved the film. I think Streisand beautifully captured the essence of the book's emotional intensity. For me,the scenery in the film was exactly as I'd imagined it based on Pat Conroy's descriptions. HOWEVER, having waited eagerly for the DVD, was very disappointed to find no special features of note (unless you call trailers and filmographies 'special features'). I know I've seen a 'Making of...' somewhere before and assumed that it would be included in this addition. As thrilled as I am to own this movie on DVD, don't buy this thinking there are extras. You'll be disappointed.",1006300800,3,605,4.9411764705882355
16174,1,0767835069,"i have little good to say about this movie.  as a therapist myself, i feel the therapist in this movie was repugnant...totally unethical in sleeping with her patient...obviously an emotionally disturbed woman.  to analyze it just a bit, i can't help but think that it was the writer's fantasy that their therapist have sex with them...any good therapist would tell you that what barbra streisand's character did would ultimately prove very destructive to the patient.
yet this movie stated that it was okay for her to have sex with him...because he ""wasn't really her patient.""  well, for starters, it's equally BAD THERAPY for her to have sex with...a patient's brother...but the fact is, she was treating him LIKE a patient, giving him real sessions and asking him personal questions about himself.  in short, he WAS her patient, and there's no excuse for what she did...it violates all boundaries:  professional, personal and emotional.
and i say this movie is immature because clearly the people who made this movie and acted in it had no idea of the real emotional effect such a relationship would have on a character such as nick nolte's.
i've worked with patients who have had sex with past therapists, and let me tell you...in the best of cases it proves very disturbing to them in the long run.  it's not a subject to be treated lightly, because it's not, despite what it might look like, a romance.  in fact, it's much closer to incest.
sick, sick movie.  and scary (but perhaps not surprising) that it became so popular in america.
and by the way, even if it is a fantasy (a normal one) for people to want to seduce their therapists, it doesn't mean for ONE SECOND that it would be healthy IF THEIR THERAPISTS GIVE IN TO THEIR PATIENTS' WISHES!  the whole point of therapy is that the therapist understands this...and keeps their boundaries, modeling healthy boundaries and limits.",1005264000,17,1892,4.8328173374613
16175,5,0767835069,"This movie is for any Streisand fan to watch. The casting of Barbra as a New York psychiatrist is excellent as Nolte as a football coach who comes to New York to help is sister who tried to commit suicide. Tom played by Nick Nolte falls in love with Barbra's character Dr. Lowenstein, both are married but not happily. I'll save the ending for the movie. The music, the acting including Barbra's son Jason Gould is high caliber. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a well done movie, this is one heck of a movie.

16176,5,0767835069,This movie is certainly a triumph for Barbra Streisand as a director. The entire cast is superb. Streisand should not have acted though in this movie - some of her scenes are pathetic.,1000252800,,184,4.606060606060606
16177,3,0767835069,"I loved Pat Conroy's book, The Prince of Tides.  I looked forward to the film version.  Nick Nolte was an inspired choice to play Tom Wingo.  I have no qualms with the rest of the cast.  I, too, wish that more of the story (of Luke especially) could have been told.  But, I have no major problem with the screenplay and the direction served the script fine.
My problem is that Streisand as producer and director should have read the damn book a little closer when it came to the character of Lowenstein, the psychiatrist.  She was described as upper-class, slim & dark,  cultured, refined & immaculate.  Now, Barbra may be interesting & intelligent....but classy and refined she ain't.  Not with footlong violet fingernails that would rival the Dragonlady's.  Maybe if I hadn't read the book, it would have worked...but I doubt it.
Casting in a movie is half the battle.  And that her ego allowed her to cast herself in this role says more about Barbra's delusions than it does her talent.  She told the story well, but the great love and understanding between Wingo and Lowenstein just wasn't believable for me between Nolte and Streisand.
Too bad, because she handled the rest of the movie pretty well.  I only wrote this because Barbra did a lot of bitching at the time that she was overlooked at Oscar time for Best Director.  I truly feel that had she cast that role to someone else and JUST directed, she would have made the list.  But, she had to make the movie a Barbra Streisand movie starring Barbra and thereby sank it rom potentially great to just a good film. Ego will get you every time.  3-1/2 stars.",988243200,2,1615,4.574912891986063
16178,5,0767835069,"Who ever watched the move ""Prince of Tides"" should now know how damaging childhood abuse is; how much mental damage the silence can do and; how  abuse influences the lives of the abused.
The ones who lived through  childhood abuse felt the pain while watching and know how the silent fear  grinds away the worth of life itself.
To get out of such numbing  self-denial victims must talk and live the shame and guilt with the once  who caused it.
My compliments to Barbara Steisand for her courage to  direct such a sensitive subject with indescribable excellence. My deepest  respect to Nick Nolte for playing this very intense roll with brilliance.
A new book entitled ""Haunting Shadows from the Past"" By Sieglinde W.  Alexander, will be released on  Oct. 1. 2000. This book describes in many  details the devastating effect of child abuse in our lives.",966816000,2,853,4.780821917808219

7789039,3,0767835069,"Enjoyable and interesting movie but a rather unrealistic situation with the therapist -- perhaps if she'd been more of an ordinary psychologist and not quite so Barbra, exuding glamour and wealth. (How would the sister afford this kind of woman?) Nick Nolte is fascinating to watch. I thought the flashback scenes were not quite as raw as they could have been, to portray the level of trauma. I don't mean that I needed to see more gory detail, but it often felt more like a play than real. And Nolte's healing came a little too quickly -- he would surely be more screwed up than this as an adult.",1517270400,,597,4.486238532110092
