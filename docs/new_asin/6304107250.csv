781876,5,6304107250,"A comedy movie that never ages, for me. Edwards and company give a shout out to Laurel & Hardy at the beginning, and if Laurel & Hardy inspired this movie, hats off to them. I was never a huge fan of their's, but this movie, in company with Darling Lili, gives Blake Edwards two spots on my list of all-time favorite movies. The set decorations, sets, locations, costuming, cinematography and so on are just top-notch.
 I'm not a Tony Curtis fan, but he does a fairly credible job. Natalie Wood, Jack Lemmon (especially), Peter Falk, Ross Martin and even Keenan Wynn make this movie a joy every time. It is long...very long...but there is not very much I would want to see cut out of it. I have soundbites of it for ringtones. Maybe that says I'm a movie-nerd. Ok, but this is one for the ages. I thought perhaps it only appealed to a few people, but when a classic movie theater had it on some years ago, the whole audience laughed till they cried, applauded, and generally had a great time.",1508544000,2,992,4.420765027322404

782124,4,6304107250,"The Great Race features a 22,000-mile road race from New York City to the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The year is 1908, and participants in the race include mortal enemies The Great Leslie (Tony Curtis) and the villainous Professor Fate (Jack Lemmon). In the tradition of movie heroes and villains, Curtis is always dressed in white, Lemmon in black. Another participant in the race is Maggie Dubois (Natalie Wood), who has convinced a newspaper to sponsor her so she can cover the event for the paper. Professor Fates car  the Hannibal 8  is equipped with a cannon, smoke screens and assorted other gadgets that he employs to eliminate most other competitors. Everything boils down to a two-car race, with elaborate sight gags along the way.

The movie is reminiscent of Around the World in 80 Days, made nine years earlier. Both films feature a race that traverses many countries with adventures happening at every step of the way. While  80 Days played it mostly seriously, director Blake Edwards pulls out all the stops to make The Great Race a rollicking hoot every mile of the journey. Not every gag lands, but most do, among them a huge pie fight, inspired by the 1927 Laurel & Hardy short Battle of the Century. Unfortunately, Lemmon plays his role like a live-action cartoon, with an over-the-top exaggerated performance that wears thin quickly. At 157 minutes, the movie is far too long, allowing for stretches when nothing significant is happening and the momentum of the race is slowed.

There are no bonus features on the unrated widescreen Blu-ray release.",1486944000,,1565,4.890566037735849

It's pure comedy that the whole family can watch without fear of bad language or torrid sex scenes.  Jack Lemmon is the consummate comedian playing both Professor Fate and Prince Hapnick.  Tony Curtis plays the role of the Great Leslie, and Natalie Wood is the perfect fem fa-tale.  Peter Falk and Keenen Wynn are the perfect minions for both Lemmon and Curtis.  Dozens of wonderful supporting actors such as Vivian Vance, and Larry Storch keep this film rolling along.  This is a long movie, complete with an intermission, but on a fall or winter weekend evening, break out the popcorn and gather the family around to laugh and enjoy this ultimate comedy!",1472860800,2,795,4.72463768115942

It's really hard to believe now that the 4 lead characters in the show are now gone. Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, Peter Falk, Natalie Wood. They left us a piece of cinematic history that will live on for decades.
With 2015, it celebrated it's 50th Anniversary Edition and the DVD version, here, is just fabulous! The sound, the picture, the menus, all of it. The price is right on this one, too!
It's a long, long race between two nemesis' ""The Great Leslie"" and ""Professor Fate"" from New York To Paris! What ensues is a slapstick comedy of high speed hijinks!!
If you have never seen this one before, or are fans of the 4 lead characters or the many other notable stars of the 1965 era, you have to get this movie for your library!!

Whatever technical mishap occured it should have been corrected by the time of my purchase.  Shame on you lazy movie company executives!  After the initial audio problems clear up the movie kicks into gear and is a classic comedy, a tour de force. Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, Peter Falk,  Keenan Wynn and the lovely Natalie Wood all give wonderful performances.

The best food fight in the history of cinema - more than 4000 pies met their end - Animal House doesn't come close.
Jack Lemmon and his interaction with the pack of Pug dogs in priceless.
While criticized for its forced slapstick humor... it's one of my guilty pleasures.

Sure the reporter and some characters may be a little annoying, the whole feminism plot, the film could have probably done without since she seemed to always need to be rescued by a man, or used the fact the various driver's treated women they were attracted to a certain way to be given transport and so on anyway made that kind of pointless.  As the film starts you can't help compare it to the old TV shows (like this movie those were decades before my time and I'm going by the reruns I watched on TV as a kid).  You've got the good vs evil as white and black possibly based on racism thing going on), with The Great Leslie, his car, his clothes and everything else about him being white with him clearly being the good guy, and Professor Fate and his side kick dressed in black, their car is black and other inventions are black.

The film takes a long while to get to the actual race (and even then it's pretty quickly down to just two cars), before the race we have Professor Fate trying to kill The Great Leslie with his plans constantly backfiring.  Of course Roadrunner cartoon style, he and his sidekick never die from large heavy objects landing on them, or explosions.  Nor doe Leslie when a cannon is fired into the back of his car (for reasons I can't fathom as they are trying to rescue Professor Fate at the time).  As we would see in probably the most famous car race franchise of the 80's the Cannonball Run movies, there is a pointless to the race mass brawl scene in the middle of the race. The race contestants as well obviously inspired the Wacky Races cartoon with the journalist clearly Penelope Pitstop, and Professor Fate clearly Dastardly and Mutley.

There are obvious green screen moments throughout, the times the film was made/set obviously had a domestic violence tolerated a bit more such as the sherrif does nothing when the dancer's jealous boyfriend throws her into a few tables, you've also got a fair few coward punches thrown by men on other men looking the other way as they stop to let a lady walk through too.  But you can accept watching these things for the outdated time they were in, perhaps explaining to kids watching it with you that that sort of thing isn't acceptable by a real man today.  Plus like the Roadrunner type scenes at the start, no seemed to get hurt by any of the brawl scenes.

The movie is a lot of fun though, part of the fun is the obvious that looks so fake factor at times. Plus stuff like the fact the hero who always wears white, never gets his outfits dirty at all. There's also scenes where guys take off their shirts, even Leslie in a sword fight one in a castle, where it's interesting to note society's expectations of a hero were different back then, in the fact that if this was made today, Leslie would be ripped with stomach muscles and a well toned body, whereas he has slight muscular arms and a physic that looks like a regular guy who doesn't live in a gym.  Although the domestic violence and things like that are seen in the bad light as they rightfully should be today, there are some aspects such as healthy body image that they probably had the better outlook on back in those days. The Great Race is interesting to watch and notice things like that and talk about with the other people watching it with you.

I really liked the main two cars too, I'd love to come across a die-cast toy version of them somewhere.",1449273600,,3629,4.398507462686567

783619,4,6304107250,"This review is for the Blu-ray edition, so technical stuff first. Visually, this one is a knockout. Starting with the opening credits, the crisp clarity is astonishing. Unfortunately, there's a problem with the sound, which early on suddenly fades to hard-to-hear. We had the volume cranked up to Eleven, and still had to click on the English sub-titles for a while. As for the film itself, it does hail from that period of way over-long comedies, such as THOSE MAGNIFICENT MEN and THE HALLELUJAH TRAIL. While I'm more of a fan of the last two, all three would have been improved with some judicious trimming. Apart from that, there's much to enjoy in this gem, starting with Jack Lemmon's performance. The film is dedicated to Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy, but seemed to take its inspiration more from the old Warner Brothers Cartoons. Mr. Lemmon appeared to be channeling Wile E. Coyote, and had him down pat. Tony Curtis was also at the top of his game, and one of the few male stars of that period who could get away with wearing a spotless white fur collar for the whole movie. And Dorothy Provine, in her one song and scene, was a delight, and made me wonder why she wasn't a bigger star. That leave's us with Natalie Wood, in what probably should have been the Marilyn Monroe role. Miss Wood did make a few other comedies in the 60s, but she just wasn't an inherently funny actress. My heart started to sink during her first few dialogue scenes. But she then redeemed her performance by throwing herself whole-heartedly into the physical comedy, where she more than held her own. So ... all in all, overly long but still a wonderful comedy.",1430611200,10,1643,4.610921501706485
783695,5,6304107250,"I enjoyed this movie a lot when it was first released.  It is a long movie and consequently doesn't get shown on TV in any format.  While I bought the Blue Ray version I did not perceive any great benefit from the high resolution.  The movie is colorful and would likely be as attractive in the older format.  This is a pleasant frenetic comedy, made when Tony Curtis, Natalie Wood, Jack Lemon and Peter Falk were at the heights of their powers and youth.  Blake Edwards directed it and it's pretty much what you'd expect from his style.  If you want great drama and deep meaning look elsewhere.

784315,5,6304107250,"THE GREAT RACE [1965] [Blu-ray] The Movie with the 20,000 Mile or One-Million-Laugh Guarantee!

Crank your engines! With a roar, a splutter and a pop (and more Academy Award winning Best Sound Effects), and see drivers wheel westward in a wacky turn-of-the-century automobiles for a New York-to-Paris race (westward across America, the Bering Strait and Russia). Ahead lies 20,000 miles, a barroom brawl, a sinking iceberg, 2,357 pies in the face and incalculable laughs.

Blake Edwards turns a marvellous cast loose, on a round-the-world highway booby-trapped by some of the funniest gags ever. Jack Lemon and Peter Falk are nasty Professor Fate and his dim henchman Max. Tony Curtis is their good-guy nemesis The Great Leslie. And Natalie Wood is a cheroot-puffing suffragette reporter Maggie DeBois. All scored to the music of four-time Academy Award-winning composer Henry Mancini. And ravishingly brought to you in a brand new digital transfer, plus a revitalised digital audio from restored elements. The Great Race is great fun!

FILM FACT: The Great Race won an Academy Award Oscar for Best Sound Effects for George Groves and was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Song ""The Sweetheart Tree"" with music written by Henry Mancini. The Great Race was also nominated for the Golden Globe Awards for Best Picture, Musical or Comedy and Best Actor, Musical or Comedy for Jack Lemmon. At the 4th Moscow International Film Festival, the film won the Silver Prize.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: The Great Race [1965] is Blake Edwards' loving tribute to the slapstick films of old, and is dedicated to ""Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy"" but it owes more to the style of earlier silent comedies with a dastardly villain, a spotless hero and outrageous and thrilling stunts.

Tony Curtis is the hero, ""The Great Leslie"" is a daredevil and adventurer who enters a 1908 road race starting in New York City and going west to end at the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Leslie wears only immaculately white clothing and his teeth gleam in the sunlight. In pursuit are Leslie's arch-nemesis Professor Fate [Jack Lemmon] and his henchman Maximilian Meen [Peter Falk]. Fate always wears black including a black top hat and thick moustache. His car, the ""Hannibal 8"" and is fitted with the latest and most devious devices such as a smoke screen and even a cannon. No old-timey chase comedy would be complete without a damsel in distress and here it is Maggie DuBois [Natalie Wood], an early feminist, who sets out to cover the race and ends up shuttling between the attentions of the Great Leslie and the clutches of the evil Professor Fate.

Director and co-writer Blake Edwards had just made two of the most popular comedies of the early sixties The Pink Panther [1963] and A Shot in the Dark [1964] which featured Peter Seller's clumsy Inspector Clouseau. With The Great Race, the director wanted to salute the source of that slapstick on a grand scale. ""This is a kind of cartoon I've presented with real-live people,"" Blake Edwards remarked. ""There is a humour in this now that was somewhat inherent in The Pink Panther and A Shot in the Dark but there is almost an unbelievable humour in that you allow things to happen to people, that they could not survive in a million years, for the sake of a laugh. You never explain it. You simply go back and they're all right and you start it again. It's much stylised and yet that's the difficulty of it, to keep the wild style and still maintain enough believability so that you become involved.""

Not content just to recreate silent-era comedy, Blake Edwards changes genres with the racers' locations. Their trek through the American West turns the film into a parody of Westerns. When they arrive in the mythical European country of Carpania, Professor Fate's resemblance to the goofy Prince Hapnik [Jack Lemmon in a dual role] sparks a spoof of The Prisoner of Zenda [1952].

Blake Edwards' fought with the producing studio Warner Bros. throughout the making of The Great Race and the result doubled the cost of what was already a large and expensive film. The film was popular, but not enough to make back its cost and began a string of films for Blake Edwards that were failures at the box office but subsequently became cult classics such as The Party [1968] which I think is the worst and most atrocious Peter Sellers films I have ever viewed and not at all funny. The Great Race has also developed a steadily growing cult following and has inspired other comedies, most notably The Beatles Yellow Submarine [1968], whose lead villain also has a henchman named Max, and Hanna-Barbera's cartoon television series Wacky Races that replaced Max with a sniggering dog named Muttley.

While Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis don't have as many opportunities to play off of each other in The Great Race, they capture the same great goofy rhythm they did in the Billy Wilder classic Some Like it Hot [1959] a feeling that's simultaneously loose and precise. Peter Falk is the perfect partner to Jack Lemmon, letting him chew up scenery while he draws plenty of his own attention by never playing exactly straight. Though she is slightly miscast, mostly because she can never let loose quite as thoroughly as her co-stars, Natalie Wood is nevertheless charming, funny and manages to hold her own.

There are a lot of people with mixed feelings about pie fights in films, with the exception of Laurel and Hardy's Battle of the Century [1927], which may be impossible to top, but Blake Edwards stages one so epic that it's impossible not to be impressed and it took five days to film, and 4,000 pies, to film this infamous classic scene. Quite an undertaking, but ultimately funny, because Tony Curtis wanders freely among the flying desserts without getting a single smudge on his white costume, until near the end of this section of the film. All those pies for one long joke  wow! The silent film comedians would totally approve.

But theres great news for Warner Home Videos archive edition Blu-ray, is a peerless mastering effort. This is becoming something of a habit for the Warner Archive Collection, and one definitely championed by yours truly. I just sincerely wish Warner Archive Collection would invest in more titles like The Great Race, especially from its vast catalogue. Could we hope in the future for titles like Around the World in Eighty Days, Silk Stockings, The Student Prince, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Marie Antoinette, Goodbye Mr. Chips [1939], The Prisoner of Zenda [1937], Pride and Prejudice [1940] and so on, and so forth?

Blu-ray Video Quality  The Great Race appears in an aspect ratio of approximately 2.40:1 on this Blu-ray Disc. The film barely showed its age via this excellent 1080p encoded transfer. Sharpness almost always came across well. A few wide shots displayed a minor amount of softness, but those issues appeared infrequently and they usually seemed connected to various effects and camera techniques that made them inevitable. The vast majority of the film displayed terrific delineation. I detected no signs of jagged edges or moir&eacute; effects, and edge haloes were a non-factor; some appeared due to process shots, but again, those were unavoidable and they didn't stem from transfer-related issues. Grain seemed natural, and print flaws failed to appear, as this remained a smooth, clean image. Colours looked truly marvellous. Race boasted a vivid and broad palette that favoured many bright and lively hues, and the Blu-ray replicated them with vivacity. The tones always looked accurate and distinct, and they showed no signs of bleeding, noise, or other issues. Black levels also seemed very deep and rich, while shadow detail was appropriately heavy but not overly dense. Even some day for night shots came across with nice definition and clarity. I felt delighted with this impressive presentation.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Despite its age, the 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack to The Great Race appeared strong nonetheless. The sound field showed an emphasis on the forward speakers, and it generally presented a nice array of elements there. Music offered pleasant stereo separation and presence, and effects cropped up in the correct locations. Those elements also seemed to blend together well, and the pieces moved cleanly across the spectrum. The surrounds didn't add too much, but they provided some good reinforcement at times. A few of the louder sequences benefited from rear elements. For example, a plane swooped nicely from front to back, and a few other scenes followed suit. The sound field seemed ambitious and active for its age. Audio quality appeared good for a film of this vintage. Speech seemed a little thin and tinny at times, but I expected that given the films period. I felt dialogue consistently sounded accurate and distinct, and I heard no issues related to edginess or intelligibility. Effects were similarly clear and concise, and they lacked notable signs of distortion. They also boasted good oomph at times; for example, explosions and blasts kicked in some solid bass response. Music seemed bright and lively, and the score also showed nice depth. I heard no indications of source noise or other concerns. Overall, the audio for The Great Race fared quite well.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature Documentary: Behind-the-scenes with Blake Edwards The Great Race [1965] [1080p] [2.40:1] [15:24] This vintage documentary includes some interesting behind-the-scenes footage from several major sequences, including the pie fight, the barroom brawl and the initial entrance of Prince Hoepnick. Though formatted as a 1080p encoded image, the source appears to be standard definition.

Theatrical Trailer: [1965] [1080p] [2.40:1] [2:51] The most interesting feature of this Original Theatrical Trailer is how it uses clips from the stars' previous films to set up a contrast with their characters in The Great Race.

Finally, Blake Edwards will probably always be best remembered for his collaborations with Peter Sellers on The Pink Panther films, with Audrey Hepburn on Breakfast at Tiffany' and with wife Julie Andrews on Victor Victoria. But The Great Race is ripe for rediscovery by a new generation of filmmakers who can ignore the film's commercial disappointments and appreciate the sheer craftsmanship with which Blake Edwards staged gag after gag, letting his performers do whatever they did best and surrounding them with a visual canvas that amplified their gifts. Warner Archive Collection has given the film the first-class presentation it deserves and The Great Race is everything you could possibly hope for on Blu-ray; sparkling with deep, richly saturated colours, superbly rendered contrast, and a dazzling amount of fine detail evident from beginning to the end. Also outstanding is Dorothy Provines He Shouldn't-A, Hadn't-A, Oughtn't-A Swang on Me! nearly knocked me off my chair. Wow, thank you Warner Archive Collection! Highly Recommended!

Watch it if only for the berry-pie throwing scene.  Must have been fun to film, especially for the actor who played the character who doesn't get a spec of pie on him, even though he is in the middle of the action.

Jack Lemmon does a great ""evil"" character.  Peter Falk is the perfect foil for Lemmon's character.

The content, including period featurette, is identical to the DVD that long preceded it.  Interestingly, according to biographical sources, Natalie resisted starring in this comedy and only did so in exchange for her casting in the subsequent drama, ""Inside Daisy Clover"". Indeed, she even attempted a hushed-up suicide near the end of production. Nor did she appreciate working with Tony Curtis, her co-star in 1964's ""Sex and the Single Girl"" . She didn't enjoy the famous pie fight, either, which took three days to film and, contrary to modern practice, employed actual pies rather than shells filled with shaving cream. As with her role in  ""West Side Story"",  Natalie's singing voice on the lovely song, ""The Sweetheart Tree"", for which this film is also best known, was also dubbed, I believe. Of course, I still enjoy just looking at Natalie, but this latest viewing also increased my appreciation for Jack Lemmon's talent. If you share my lifelong infatuation with Ms. Wood, whose own life was tragically abbreviated, you're already familiar with this film and, doubtless, would enjoy it in blu ray format as much as I do.",1413417600,4,1469,5.159663865546219

The idea is to win The Great Race, a transcontinental automobile race, at any cost, even if it means cheating, and if you are not winning, it just means that you aren't cheating hard enough. A parallel story involves a romantic tryst between Jack Lemmon and Natalie Wood. Monsieur Lemmon learns firsthand the limitations that mother nature imposes and how extraordinarily difficult it is to hit  a moving target.

It's a wonderful mix of hero vrs. villain,good vrs. evil, man vrs. woman, romp during an early 1900's America to Paris car race ( an event that actually happened). In it, you'll recognize several silver-age adventure movie scenarios, all wrapped up in a wonderful comedy and romantic story. The stars are fantastic in their acting, and the fun just keeps going. If you're an old movie fan, this will have you laughing out loud. If you're not an old movie fan, you'll appreciate it for the acting and the story.

Picture: excellent.

Sound volume very low, but clear.

Subtitles:  English only.  Of special note, these subtitles are easy on the eyes, appearing wholly within the blacked out area beneath the widescreen picture in white bold type.

Menu:  does not have chapter options.

Special Features:  (1) ""Behind the Scenes with Blake Edwards"" - This feature was apparently made shortly after the film came out.  It is narrated and runs about 15 minutes.  (2) ""Movie Trailer.""",1410652800,7,590,5.105263157894737

Natalie Wood is along for the ride as a reporter aspiring for a job in a man's world as Women's Rights is a sub-plot.

Musical numbers occur before a bar room brawl in which Denver Pyle appears. The route goes to Alaska where they are stranded on an ice berg before they end up in Europe where Lemmon's character is a look-a-like to local royalty.

Would Marilyn have been a good choice for the lady reporter role if she had lived? Wood appears to be 28-years-old while Monroe would have been 40ish.

A plot to replace the royalty detours the racers and a big food fight follows before they make their way to Paris where love is proclaimed and a sequel is offered up as an idea in case there is more $ to be made.

Absolutely correct. There's no difference from the dvd. No chapter list or thumbnails. Same set up and font as the plain dvd, which is of pretty darn good quality to begin with. I had waited and hoped for a much better treatment of this wonderful classic. It's a pretty slipshod release. I was disappointed too. However, I do love the film itself and I dare you to find me a better pie fight in any other film !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

There's no doubt  that the movie itself is Just Brilliant
But the quality of this Blu Ray is the same with the DVD of it
I have received the blu ray of this film on Sept 9th, 2014 expecting a usual blu ray picture quality
But the fact that I found is very very disappointing as there's no difference than the DVD at all
It seems not to be remastered nor any special care given to transfer this film to Blu Ray
I just can't understand why they realese this on Blu Ray in such a poor picture quality
I really want to return it but I can't as they would not accept as it's a movie.",1407715200,4,3760,4.336219336219337

With all four of these iconic stars together in one movie it was hilarious and wonderful. Natalie didn't make many comedies, but she was great in this, and she was at her absolute most gorgeous.",1407542400,2,338,4.25
785224,5,6304107250,"God, I love this flick.  Saw it in the theater when first released and had a hard time from wetting myself laughing so much because of the brilliant (for me) comedy and acting.  I hope Warner has finally corrected the flaw on their 2002(?) DVD wherein for the first half hour or so the dialogue levels are so overwhelmed by the music and foley (please, please, please say they've fixed it!). Don't remember that prob on the laserdisc issue. Honestly, it really doesn't matter anyway as I've been waiting so long for the Blu-ray issue and I'll take it any way I can get it.",1407542400,6,572,4.438095238095238
785225,5,6304107250,Possibly one of the best slapstick movies ever plus being really long (and that's good) and in color!  This would be similar to the old silent and I think it is dedicated to Laurel and Hardy.  Thrilled this is finally on bluray.  The early 20th century the cars are going to race from New York to Paris--remember comedies don't have to make sense.  They float across the extreme North Pacific on an ice sheet.  Natalie Wood (a Russian American) is great in a comedy plus she gets to use her Russian in one scene.  You will be delighted seeing Vivan Vance in a very good supporting role.  Dorothy Provine who made a few good movies in the 60s great as a dance hall singer in the western scene.  Since they are traveling round the world there are lots of chances for various genres of humor.  Really funny is the bakery throwing contest where the Great Leslie wearing all white doesn't get hit until the last of the scene.  The Great Leslie is Tony Curtis (the good guy) and Jack Lemmon shines in black clothing as the bad guy.  Small children can safely watch this movie.  This is for a family but since there is an intermission you can easily pause it to take a bathroom/snack or meal break.  Don't miss this one!,1407369600,5,1213,4.40990990990991

785229,5,6304107250,"I don't yet own this bluray, but I own the DVD. This is one of the funniest movies ever made! There are so many sight gags and one liners that I cannot even begin to list them all. Natalie Wood.is hilarious as the suffragette, Tony Curtis is the quintessential good guy, Jack Lemon is the doomed-to-fail bad guy, and Peter Falk is Professor Doom's (Lemon) evil but lovable sidekick.

I watched this movie (the first time) against my will when I was 15. My parents insisted that I would love it. They were right! Good comedy is timeless. When I taught Senior English, I showed clips of this movie as part of a unit on satire. The kids  loved the clips and begged me to show the entire movie. They loved it! When they found out that Jack Lemon and Tony Curtis had done another movie together (Some Like it Hot) , they begged for that one, too. They didn't even complain about the outside-of-class essay requirement that I added to the unit as the price of watching the movies in class.

785325,4,6304107250,"Consider the comedic films of Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, Laurel and Hardy and Charlie Chaplin. Now think of the adventure movies we so admired at the Saturday matinees with Tom Mix, Bob Steele, John Wayne, Tyrone Power as Zorro, Stewart Granger, Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Mix them together, along with the requisite romance and elegance and you have The Great Race.

Wonderful villains Prof. Fate (Jack Lemmon in a terrific comedic turn) and Maximilian (Peter Falk in a scene stealing role) versus the heroic Leslie (Tony Curtis) and the opportunistic Maggie (Natalie Wood) spear every convention is high-spirited action. The list of supporting actors could not be better with Keenan Wynn, Arthur O'Connell, Vivian Vance, Dorothy Provine, Larry Storch and Ross Martin, among others.

From westerns to castles, from New York to Paris via Russia and Salzburg (filling in for a mythical kingdom) there are gags galore. The plot is simple: to promote car sales a race from New York to Paris pits a car made especially for The Great Leslie against the auto-mo-bile devised by Professor Fate, Leslie's arch nemesis. Hitching a ride is the journalist Maggie Dubois, who is also a feminist. Along the way there are fist fights, sword play, kidnapping and perils worthy of any matinee serial.

The current DVD is just so-so. This movie could have used some re-mastering; it is like a very good VHS tape, but still serviceable. There are only a few original tunes for the movie, the well-known ""The Sweetheart Tree"" dubbed for Natalie Wood and Dorothy Provine's ""He Shouldn't-A, Hadn't-A, Oughtn't-A Swang on Me!"" are the standouts. This movie is nearly 50 years old now and viewing it recently, I couldn't help but think that it has not aged, the gags are still as funny and movie still as enjoyable as when it first was viewed. Compare this to the very worn ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" that is two years older and there is no comparison!

Beautiful cinematography. Lots of laughs and silliness on a grand scale. Perfectly cast. Jack Lemmon steals every scene he is in. The man was a brilliant actor. He could do over the top stuff like this and later on do very touching dramatic stuff as well. Can't think of a current actor quite of his calibur. I won't say that this is a perfect film... it does slow down a bit in a couple of spots and probably could have bee edited down and made into a tighter movie, but its an enjoyable spectacle and deserves to be seen by more people.",1393113600,10,876,4.158823529411765

I guess seeing a lot of things when you're a Senior in high school lose a little luster when you approach retirement age.  Some of the gags are shamelessly telegraphed.  Some are too long or are repeated, but it brings back a lot of fond memories and still brings a lot of smiles and some downright guffaws.  All the principals are excellent, particularly Peter Falk.  On the beginning credits it says ""For Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy"".  Too bad Blake Edwards didn't use a little more of their subtlety in his execution.  It is still good fun.

Jack Lemon is fiendissly funny and of course Tony Curtis can't do no wrong, let alone get dirty...I wonder how many takes it took for him to walk thru the pie fight and not get hit.  Peter Falk (pre Columbo) is the perfect foil to put Lemon's wicked ideas into action. And Natelie Wood as the love interest finishes out a great cast.

a story of an around the world race in 2 motorcars right after the turn of the century.  Women are fighting for right to vote among other things and Natalie Wood's (at her most beautiful) character convinces a newspaperman to allow her to participate and report on the event.  Of course this is strictly a man's world, and the Tony Curtis character (the Great Leslie), though loving women, sees her independence as an invasion on his right to be the best.  Enter Jack Lemmon, Professor Fate, who has been trying to one up Leslie (completely unsuccessfully) for years!!!  Peter Falk as Fate's lackey is outstanding.  Many prominent film starts of the era also have cameo roles.

Once my wife figured out what movie our daughter wanted to watch, she called the movie Daddy's Silly Movie.  (And the name stuck.)

About 4-5 years ago, my wife got me a copy of this DVD.  Our family fell in love with this movie all over again!

We absolutely LOVE this movie.  And now that the kids are grown & about to move on with their lives, I had to order a copy of the DVD for each of them to have.  We have even made boyfriends & girlfriends watch this movie through the years...

786312,5,6304107250,"The Great Race is, in my opinion, unequivocally one of the best comedies produced in the sixties.  It stars movie greats  Jack Lemmon; Tony Curtis; Natalie Wood; Peter Falk; and Keenan Wynn...and has a fine supporting staff with actors Arthur O'Connell; Vivian Vance; Dorothy Provine; Larry Storch; and Ross Martin.  In the race from New York to Paris, you'll encounter 20,000 miles of hilarious situations involving a bare-knuckled barroom brawl; staged Indian attack; sinking iceberg;  kidnapping; and a sword and pie fight.  You'll enjoy watching Professor Fate (Jack Lemmon) and his henchman Max (Peter Falk) in their many failed attempts to destroy the Great Leslie and his car the Leslie Special, via his (Professor Fate's) numerous hair brained inventions...including his own four wheeled motorized monstrosity the formidable Hannibal 8, which has a cannon and assortment of other gadgets.  Maggie Dubois (Natalie Wood) is a cigar smoking suffragette, who enters the race both as a competitor and journalist hired by the New York Sentinel to cover the race.  Maggie initially makes herself out to be the ultimate independent woman uninterested in romance and hard to get, though eventually succumbs to the charms of the Great Leslie (Tony Curtis) and the two fall madly in love.  Special attention should be given to Jack Lemmon in his dual roles as Professor Fate and lush lookalike Prince Hapnik, who's kidnapped by his political enemies and replaced with Jack Lemmon's Professor Fate.  From the nasty-loathsome Professor Fate to the giddy-inebriated Prince Hapnik, proves Lemmon's adaptability to transition from role to role...and as far as I'm concerned makes him deserving of top billing in The Great Race!  The two best comedies of the 1960s, without question, is It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and The Great Race...and are two DVDs you seriously need to consider buying.  Blake Edwards hit it out of the park with his killer comedy...and gets this reviewer's 5 star rating!",1363996800,,1989,5.2037617554858935

I like the actors, I don't think there's one movie with Tony Curtis that I don't enjoy at least to some degree. The cast are all great comedic actors but they are wasted, this movie is a total flop. It appears to be patterned after the slapstick comedy style, it's reminiscent of Perils of Pauline, one event failure after another with seemingly no connection between them except that there is a car involved (in at least one of these events even the car is gone!). There are generous inconsistencies throughout the film, and everything that Natalie Wood's character does in the film is done with deliberate deceit, lies and cheating. I found that very tiring. I especially disliked one scene about 3/4 of the way through the movie where Natalie leaves a lake (where she was bathing) iand appears to be completely naked in full frontal view, but as she approaches the camera you can see she is wearing a nude-colored corset-type covering. The song ""The Sweetheart Tree"" is a lovely song, but there is no connection whatsoever made in this film between the song and the movie, it's use is a total mystery. This is not a family film.

The acting is excellent in my opinion, Jack Lemmon as Professor Fate along with the antics of his sidekick Maximillian (Peter Falk) are where the laughs are in this film as they bumble around trying to one up while simultaneously eliminate ""The Great Leslie"" (Tony Curtis).

The score by Henry Mancini is fitting as well as stirring with several songs evoking images that I still carry to this day, namely the track entitled ""Push The Button Max"" which I still hold as the penultimate sneaky villain music.

I don't think I can adequately do this movie justice with words, to me it is and always has been a movie that has been very near and dear to my heart and even though I have grown older, my appreciation for this movie has only gotten deeper esp as these actors whom I spent my childhood watching many many times, slowly disappear from this world.

I highly recommend this movie as a comedy with some stellar acting, some lighthearted vaudevillian comedy in the spirt of Laurel and Hardy, a wonderful and evocative soundtrack by Henry Mancini and some absolutely beautiful vintage Hollywood cars, the please by all means sit back, relax and enjoy almost 3 hours that is....""The Great Race""",1355097600,,1491,4.679389312977099

A suffragette reporter and Leslie's evil nemesis Professor Fate (Jack Lemmon, The Apartment) join in for a GENUINELY HILARIOUS, SLAPSTICK-FILLED ROMP, DEDICATED TO THE LAUREL AND HARDY.  THIS IS A QUALITY, HIGH-BUDGET COMEDY WITH SOME OF THE BEST ACTORS OF THE PERIOD, AND IS AS GOOD TODAY, AS IT WAS WHEN IT WAS FIRST RELEASED IN 1965.

Professor Fate (Lemmon) and his sidekick Max (Peter Falk, television's Columbo) have been attempting to one-up the Great Leslie's stunts in vain. Finally, Fate worms his way into the Great Race competition, eager to unseat Leslie for the first time. Also joining the two is suffragette Maggie Dubois (Natalie Wood, Gypsy), a brash and confident reporter for the New York Sentinel. Her car doesn't last long so she hitches a ride with Leslie, until an iceberg incident and Fate's kidnapping undoes her hesitantly romantic bond with Leslie. Slapstick comedy keeps the plot jumping from one destination to another, leading all our heroines and arch nemeses to Carpania, a small Russian-esque town. There, a Baron tries to make use of Fate's resemblance to the crown heir Prince Hapnick (also played by Lemmon) for his own evil desires. A daring rescue and pie fight later, our competitors are on their way to the final showdown in Paris.

Normally, I'd give a 3-star  review, maybe even a 4-star if I was feeling generous, but here I'm not reviewing the movie by  itself but the quality of the final product.

Once again, Warner Video has provided us a product of shoddy value. Though the quality of the video is top-notch, the 10 first minutes or so of the quality of the audio track is of very poor, showing several moments of muffled music, instances when the volume fades in or out unexpectely, along with a few occurances when you can hear some very audible snaps and cracks.

786643,5,6304107250,"When I was growing up, this was one of our favorite family movies of all time. We were always quoting from it. It got to the point that when Professor Fate, pretending to be Prince Hapnik, sits up in bed and exclaims, ""What? Leslie escaped with a chicken?"", we couldn't even hear the line because we started howling with laughter ahead of time in total anticipation!

""The Great Race"" is timeless. Released in 1965, it never grows old because it's a broad comedy done in the format of an old-fashioned melodrama. Jack Lemmon is inimitable as Professor Fate, a total Snidely Whiplash character, dressed all in black, complete with nefarious gadgets to further his evil schemes. Peter Falk is his faithful minion, Max Meen, who frequently makes mistakes, including breaking off part of Professor Fate's frozen mustache.

On the hero side, dressed all in white, is Tony Curtis as Leslie ""The Great Leslie"" Gallant III. Heroes aren't usually as interesting as the villains, but Curtis does a great job of wringing every good-natured joke out of his character. His major domo is Hezekiah Sturdy - love those descriptive names!

And tying it all together, Natalie Wood playing Maggie Du Bois, the over-the-top suffragette, dressed to the nines in gorgeous gowns with a waist that couldn't have been more than 18 inches around.

Great comedy. Totally PG. The incidental music is terrific. Directed and co-written by Blake Edwards, one of the great comic movie minds. He just passed away in December, 2010. His five Pink Panther movies, with Peter Sellers, are other family favorites.

1.  Cast & Crew.  This is just a list of the actors and the names of their characters.
2.  ""Behind the Scenes with Blake Edward's 'The Great Race' "". I enjoyed this 20 minute short about the making of the movie. The movie's race is for the 20,000 miles from New York City to Paris. And, according to the narrator, ""such a race actually took place in 1908. But any resemblance between that event and the round-the-world hi-jinks in this unique motion picture is purely co-incidental!""
There are lots of outtakes from the movie, plus rehearsal footage and promotional events. Locations used included Vienna, Austria, where the Hofburg Palace, home of the Hapsburgs, was used for Prince Hapnik's ballroom scene.
Then on to Salzburg, where they filmed in a storybook castle in the middle of a lake, including using it's real dungeons.
Last location was the great city of Paris, where 2,000 extras were outfitted in 1908 clothing for the crowd scenes.
3.  Theatrical trailer. For ""The World's Greatest Comedy!"" A little hyperbole, maybe, but I'm not arguing much.
4.  Awards. ""The Great Race"" won the Oscar for Best Sound Effects, by Tregoweth Brown.

786720,5,6304107250,"This movie is just funny start to finish. It kind of helped I did not know, until near the end, that professor Fate was being played by Jack Lemmon. The character he plays here, professor Fate, is completely unlike any character I've seen him play before. Lemmon plays a second character in the movie, a European prince who's a dead ringer for professor Fate. Perhaps I still didn't know it was Jack Lemmon! In modern language the film might be said to be a vehicle for the star. Or perhaps a method of hyping up a star in order to sell the movie he's in? Younger audiences might not know who Jack Lemmon is and may enjoy the film even more. I think modern audiences could easily identify with the film.

I enjoyed the similar film 'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, World' but not nearly as much. I must see 'Those Magnificent Men and Their Flying Machines!

The film came out in 1965, when I was only a year old (200 reviews for a movie that came out in 1965!). The action takes place around 1920 but the action could easily have been set in any period. One issue that raises tension in the movie is that Maggie, the female lead, is a vocal women's libber. A suffragette, who, just like professor Fate, seems to be in a rivalry of sorts with the Great Leslie. He finally responds to her nagging by proclaiming, ""You're talking about some convenient feminist utopia with all of the advantages and none of the responsibilities"". It's not something you hear too often in a film. By the end of the film the two rivals begin a love affair.

There was a big scene near the end that seemed to drag out too long. Perhaps it was necessary, and perhaps it fit in perfectly with what I will say is an otherwise perfect movie. The film is almost 3 hours long. The big scene takes place just at the point where the viewers attention might start to wander and so it was perfectly placed? Maybe it should have even taken place a little sooner.

This is a perfect movie. Here's an idea: Bring this film back to theaters. It's just so funny. It would even be something new.",1341532800,,2051,4.347258485639687

786722,5,6304107250,"What's great about this movie is that it embodies the true essence of motion pictures... an escape from reality. Nothing about it is realistic and that's why it's fun everytime I watch it. The acting at times is ridiculous, but so are the characters and there is no other way to portray them. Legend goes that Natalie Wood was paid so poorly for her role that Jack Lemmon gave her half his salary just to keep her in the picture. I can't imagine this film without any of them.

The Great Race will never get it's due but that is a loss to everyone who takes life too seriously to enjoy some silly fun. I mean, come on, Natalie had on a different fantastic outfit in just about every scene. I will watch it over and over again everytime I need to escape. R.I.P.

The only flaw in the movie was the pacing due to the lengthy insert of the Prisoner of Zenda spoof, leading to the Mack Sennett pie fight; which I should add was a wonderful homage to Stan and Ollie. Notwithstanding that interruption in the flow of the story this movie should have won all the Oscars available for 1965. But 1965 was a dour year.  Viet Namm was just a huge Buzz Kill.

786778,3,6304107250,"Coming off a string of monster hits that included Breakfast At Tiffany's (1960), Experiment In Terror (1962), The Pink Panther (1963), and A Shot In The Dark (1964), producer/director Blake Edwards (1922-2010) could almost write his own ticket for his next project which turned out to be The Great Race (1965), an adventure/comedy extravaganza.

Set in the year 1908, and loosely based on actual events, the film is built around the rivalry between daredevil Leslie Galiant (Tony Curtis), and the wealthy, attention starved Professor Fate (Jack Lemon).  The film opens with a running series of incidents where Fate and his assistant Max Meen (Peter Falk) attempt to sabotage The Great Leslie's stunts, while failing in their own attempts at daring feats.  This part of the film is similar to a segment in A Shot In The Dark, where a series of attempts are made on Inspector Clouseau's life.  After a string of setbacks, Fate, and Leslie become involved in a race from New York to Paris.  Leslie's automobile is the `Leslie Special', while Fate's car the `Hannibal 8', is customized to perform dirty tricks.  Also entered is Maggie DuBois (Natalie Wood), a suffragette who has managed to obtain the assignment of covering the race for a newspaper.

The contest gets off to a rough start, as due to Max's dirty deeds, half of the racers make an early exit.  It's not long before Ms. DuBois's car also goes down, and she ends up being picked up by Leslie, and his mechanic Hezekiah Sturdy (Keenan Wynn).  The saloon of a small western town, is the scene of a big production number featuring Dorothy Provine as a showgirl, that finishes with a huge brawl.  Romance begins to bloom between Leslie and Maggie, as the race continues north to Alaska.  The Leslie Special and the Hannibal 8 are both stuck on the same ice floe, as the racers drift eastward across the Bering Strait towards Russia.  Upon landing, the race continues across Asia, until the racers are detained in the Russian province of Carpania, where heir to the throne, Crown Prince Hapnick (Lemon in a dual role), just happens to look just like the Professor, and Fate finds himself a pawn in a scheme to take over the government.  After much intrigue, a daring prison rescue, a spirited sword duel with an unscrupulous baron (Ross Martin), and a huge pie fight, the racers finally head down the home stretch.

When you have someone as talented and beautiful as Natalie Wood, showcasing her prominently makes perfect sense.  After being elegantly attired in the first half of the film, the shapely Ms. Wood is scantily dressed for much of the remainder, which tends to take your mind off of racing.  Ms. Wood was reportedly not enthusiastic about doing the film, but she is clearly one of the best things about the movie.  Tony Curtis brings nothing but class to his role, displaying charm, warmth, and athletic ability.  Curtis and Wood have great chemistry together.  Peter Falk steals most of the scenes he is in.  Jack Lemon seems miscast as a villain, and things only get worse when Prince Hapnick is introduced.  The intrigue in the palace is a muddled mess that slows the film to a crawl, with the drunken Hapnick being a most unlikeable nobleman.

Fueled by Fate's ingenious schemes, The Great Race gets off to a strong start, but the competitive fires cool during the crossing to Russia, and meander badly, before finally getting back on track.  Although at the time it was the most expensive comedy ever made, The Great Race was not a roaring success.  Blake Edwards seems to have overreached just a bit, as his story has lacks focus and has pacing issues.  At 160 minutes, it is just too long to keep an audience engaged throughout.

Composer Henry Mancini had tremendous success working with Blake Edwards, and his score does help to keep the film lively.  The image quality of the DVD is very good, showcasing the film's rich colors, elaborate sets, period costumes (by Don Feld and Edith Head), exotic locations, and sweeping cinematography.  An example of epic filmmaking from a bygone era, The Great Race follows in the wake of It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World (1963).  It may not be completely enthralling, but there are some genuinely funny moments, some stylish and creative scenes, and lots of the glamorous Natalie Wood and the dashing Tony Curtis, making for great viewing for the TCM crowd.",1311724800,,4369,4.795727636849132
786779,5,6304107250,"I used to enjoy watching this movie as a kid at my grandparents house. I was so glad to find it on Amazon and purchase it!! Now I can enjoy it with my husband & children!

786780,1,6304107250,"I've never seen this movie before but based on the reviews posted here I thought it would be a foregone conclusion that I would also love it (I am a huge fan of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines).  Unfortunately, I couldn't have been more wrong.  I watched this 2 hour and 40 minute movie in stunned silence (I laughed exactly once).  I kept glancing at the clock throughout, and for good reason; it took almost an hour before the alleged race even started!  They wasted the first hour establishing a supposed rivalry between Professor Fate (Jack Lemmon) & Leslie Gallant III (Tony Curtis).  This could have been accomplished in less time and to a better degree than showing one failed attempt after another to ""get"" Leslie (this reminded me of a bad Roadrunner cartoon).  It didn't help that Jack Lemmon affects not one but two phony laughs (both grated on my nerves instantly).  The race was also sidetracked by several lengthy musical interludes that had absolutely nothing to do with the matter at hand, as if stalling for time was a good thing in a ponderous epic like this!  I won't even address Natalie Wood's manic performance.

What I did like was seeing Vivian Vance & Arthur O'Connell as her harried husband.  Keenan Wynn was also fun as Tony Curtis' sidekick.  But that was about it.  The pie fight, the barroom brawl, all made this just another clich&eacute; riddled movie that never once tried to elevate the sophomoric material to a level even remotely approaching humor.
I can't believe how much I hated this movie: not a keeper and I'm almost sorry I wasted the 2 hours plus watching it just this once.",1306627200,5,1668,4.6552901023890785
786781,5,6304107250,"This movie is long overlooked as a hilarious and engaging film, unfortunately overshadowed by other (understandably) luminaries as The Pink Panther/A Shot in the Dark, and Dr. Strangelove.  However, Edwards - always fascinated with the battle of the sexes - takes on women's rights and liberation, set against another type of competition.  The duel between Tony Curtis and Natalie Wood mirrors the duel between Curtis and Jack Lemmon - each wants to win, although the means and objectives are obviously different.  Lemmon's performance is one of his best, alongside Mister Roberts and The Odd Couple.  I especially love his portrayal of the permanently-inebriated prince - absolutely hilarious.  The movie also uses a top-notch cast in several cameos and individual scenes: Dorothy Provine, Larry Storch, and Ross Martin to name a few - as well as a great supporting cast in Peter Falk, Keenan Wynn, and Vivian Vance.  Sure, there's some slapstick, but Edwards treats it with his usual deftness (his command diminished considerably with later Pink Panther sequels), and this only adds to the picture.

I grew up on this movie in the middle 70's, as it was usually on KTLA or KTTV in Los Angeles on the weekends.  My dad and brother got me hooked on it, I then got my friends hooked on it, and now I get to have my son watch this in a while (he's only 8.  A little young for understanding all of the intimate/bawdy scenes and dialogue), however, I'm sure he'll like the pie fight.",1306540800,2,1479,4.837301587301587

It does not have the modern special effects that seem to dominate the box office these days, but it is great fun and very entertaining. Tony Curtis is well cast as ""The Great Leslie"", and Natalie Wood is wonderful as the ""liberated heroine"". Jack Lemon steals the show with his portrayal of ""Professor Fate"" the dastardly villain.  Peter Falk who plays Fates sidekick Max, also has some hilarious moments.  This is old time melodrama at its very best. This movie is a mix of ""Around the World in 80 Days"", and ""The Prisoner of Zenda"", but is a lot more fun. One of my favorite scense is the pie fight near the end. Classic comedy. This has to be Blake Edwards' best movie ever.",1295481600,3,770,4.401408450704225

786846,4,6304107250,"When Blake Edwards'""The Great Race"" was first released, it took its share of critical abuse for being a pale imitation of classic slapstick comedy, but since then, the state of comedy has devolved to such a state that the film looks better than ever.  It's an epic (obviously, with a two-hour, forty-minute running time) comic adventure in the ""Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" mode, but it actually holds up better, thanks to a sterling cast, including Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, Peter Falk, Keenan Wynn, Ross Martin, George Macready, and a host of comedy pros, and gorgeous, sweeping photography.  Throughout the course of the film classic movie conventions are parodied--horror films (Professor Fate's domicile), Westerns (including a great barroom brawl), ""Orphans of the Storm"" melodramas, and finally, ""Prizoner of Zenda"" adventures.  It's the last that really resonates, with one of the cinema's best swordfights between Ross Martin and Tony Curtis.  The rest of the film, though, belongs to Jack Lemmon, who channels Vincent Price as Professor Fate and then Jerry Lewis as the imbecile prince in the Graustark sequence.  Curtis is good, but he plays it essentially straight, which means he gets a bit swamped by the comic avalance of Lemmon, Falk and Wynn.  The heroine is Natalie Wood, a really terrible actress who somehow developed a cult following.  That said, this is probably her best film.  This DVD contains no new documentaries, but the original ""Behind the scenes"" featurette is fun, and the widescreen presentation is terrific.

786910,5,6304107250,"My wife and I, as well as my daughter and son think this is the best comedy ever made.  The slapstick, gags and characters are timeless.  I was 15 when this movie first hit the theaters.  I remember the Saturday matinee when I first saw it.  I laughed so much that my face hurt for hours after the show.  My daughter who is a Notre Dame graduate in chemical engineering, has a fast track management career with her company, is now a married and very smart sophisticated lady, yet she knows virtually the entire script.  This is a wonderful family movie that can be introduced to your kids at pre-teen age and it will live with them for the rest of their lives.  It is important that they are old enough to understand the many plays on words to fully appreciate it.  Most important, it is good for younger people to be exposed to this type of humor instead of the often cruel personal attack and insult type of humor that is the basis of too many of today's comedies.

It took until 2002 for the DVD to be made from the remaster of the original 1965 film, including audio upgrade to 5.1.  I think the DVD is technically very good, but I still am anxious to buy a BluRay version if one is ever made.  If anyone knows of any plans to make a BluRay version, please comment hear to let us know.  Or if anyone is in a position to contact or influence decision makers, please urge them to move ahead with the project.  This is certainly a film that should be kept alive by making sure it remains in the most contemporary formats to facilitate any possible future format improvements.

If your family has not seen this film, I urge you to view it as a family.  It makes a wonderful family activity that in sharing the humor may even help bring you a little closer to one another.  I know everyone does not have the same sense of humor, but I cannot imagine anyone actually disliking this film.",1271376000,2,1885,4.3125

The homing pigeons, the fake Indians, the suffragette movement, the fight in Boracho with Texas Jack, the organ music that continues to play after Fate has lifted his hands off the keyboard, Potsdorf, etc.  I am surprised that no college-aged pranksters or filmmakers  have replicated the pie throwing scene and filmed it for You Tube: my kids tell me that it is only because no college age people have seen this movie besides them  Too sad.",1258329600,,1077,4.549222797927461

This movie has a lot of positive aspects.  The photography is great and the music is too.  Natalie Wood was one of my first crushes and she still enchants me.
Jack Lemon and Peter Faulk are great together and you can ignore Lemon's overacting, because that was the effect they were going for- like one of the villians in the old silents.

However, over the years I have grown less and less fond of this production.  The movie bogs down seriously in the Pottsdorf sequence, and when Tony Curtis engages in the sword fight with Ross Martin, you now wish he had kept his shirt on- the middle age spread is a bit obvious.

""The Sweetheart Tree"" is a total throwaway.  It really slows things down, and I still am unable to fathom why it was included.  It used to be that they would pad movies with songs and dances to fill them out to a decent running time, but this thing runs long anyway.

It's a bit hard to see who the humor in the movie was targeting.  I remember as a child that I thought it to be a laugh riot, but now it doesn't seem as funny.  The pie fight wasn't that funny originally, and now it's just a reason to hit the ""scan"" button on the remote.

787111,5,6304107250,"My lifelong friend and I believe this to be one of Jack Lemmon's finest performances, one that he obviously totally enjoyed.  Our favorite scene occurs when, after surviving the trek across North America, and crossing on a melting iceburg, barely making their way to Asia, they arrive in a Russian village.  With the townspeople standing there to greet them, but in stoney silence, Professor Fate says ""Obviously they don't know who I am.""  He stands in the car and with a drammatic gesture declares ""I am Professor Fate!"".  This is met with more stoney silence,(a truly hillarious moment) whereupon he and Max start fumbling in an English-Russian dictionary to find the words to say.  Maggie Dubois (a recent hostage in their long trek) reveals ""I speak, read an write English, French, and Russian."" and stands up and greets the suspicious crowd in their native tongue, which results in a rousing reaction.  Only Blake Edwards could have made this movie what it is, a timeless piece of filmmaking, based loosely on a factual event.

I have five kids, and it wasn't until my last that I found an immediate soul mate with my sense of comedy.  She can't get enough of this movie, and we share the hillarity together as often as we can stand it.  There is a great line in every scenario - we just love the exchanges between Fate and Max (""Where are you??!!""  ""Behind the rock!""  ""Which rock?""  "" This rock, you idiot!!"")

They just don't make movies like this anymore.  It doesn't get any better.",1219881600,,1493,4.714285714285714
787112,5,6304107250,"""The Great Race"" remains one of my all time favorite light confections.  This crazy comedy has the wonderful Blake Edwards absurdities and screwy jokes that we enjoyed in an age prior to the bitterness and darkness we seem to enjoy wallowing in today.

The stars of the movie are fabulous.  Jack Lemon is great as the melodrama-style villain Professor Fate and Peter Falk is eternally memorable has his feckless and long suffering assistant, Max.  Tony Curtis gets the staring role as the spotless hero, The Great Leslie.  His teeth glisten, his white clothes are dazzling, his hair is in place, and his white car never seems to pick up dirt.  Keenan Wynn is his silent, strong, and able assistant, Hezekiah.  Of course, the glory of the movie was the beautiful Natalie Wood as the suffragette and reporter, Maggie Dubois.  She left us far too soon.

The story is inspired by the real 1908 Great Race from New York to Paris.  The Suffragette movement tied in nicely with the rise of women's liberation in 1960s America, so that is in the story, too.  Neither the race nor the women's issues is handled all that seriously.  They are merely plot points to hang the jokes on and around.  The wonderful melodrama of the magnificence of The Great Leslie and the dastardly (is that word used anywhere outside of melodrama?) Professor Fate is the engine that drives the movie.  Fate hates Leslie and will stop at nothing (Nothing!) to beat him.

There are jokes about Fate's car (the Hannibal 8) and its secret weapons that never work and Leslie's car, the Leslie Special) that can withstand anything and never even get dirty.  One of my favorite sections of the movie takes place on the ice flow.

Max: ""We got to do something!""
Fate: ""Oh, don't worry. Before this iceberg melts and we drown like rats, we're going to do plenty""
Max: ""What?""
Fate: ""We're going to starve!""

Then this exchange between Fate and Leslie discussing the rate of the ice flow melting:
Leslie: ""You had better keep this to yourself""
Fate: ""Of course I will keep it to myself"" then after Leslie walks away he says to himself (us):
Fate: ""Until the water reaches my lower lip! Then I'm going to mention it to somebody!""

And the movie features the largest pie (and most colorful) pie fight ever filmed.  Those are real pies and the crew devoured hundreds of leftovers!  The movie also has some wild west fun, sword fights, and a delightfully goofy race through Paris.

A wonderfully silly movie that is still wonderful entertainment.

Enjoy!

Strongly recommended.

787187,4,6304107250,"The second pairing of Tony Curtis & Jack Lemmon is a good, funny movie but not quite up to the level of their first, Some Like It Hot. Tony Curtis is our hero, The Great Leslie, dressed in white, teeth gleaming, never dirty. Jack Lemmon is our villain, Professor Fate, dressed in black, always scheming, always failing hilariously. Natalie Wood is our heroine, Maggie Dubois, lovely, emancipated & sexy. Our supporting cast has Peter Falk, Max Meen, Professor Fate's henchman, dumb & prone to failure; & we have Keenan Wynn, Hezekiah, The Great Leslie's assistant, loyal & obedient.

Does this all sound trite, hackneyed & done before? Possible, but never done with tongue so much into cheek. Lemmon actually has two roles, Professor Fate & Prince Hapnick, the latter being an exact look alike (different mustache), a drunk & more inept than Max. These two characters are involved in a minor subplot where Gen. Kuhster (George Macready) has them switched so that the Prince will abdicate & make him Chancellor of Potzdorf.

This movie pays homage to the history of Hollywood & its films. There are touches of the Keystone Cops, Robin Hood, Dick Dastardly, a western barroom brawl & many more. The sword duel between The great Leslie & Baron Von Stuppe (Ross Martin) is lifted directly from The Adventures of Robin Hood, even to the point of showing the shadows only dueling. One can even see some of the Roadrunner & Wile E. Coyote in the film. Jack Lemmon is completely over the top as Professor Fate, in fact, all the characters in the movies are caricatures, complete exaggerations of the real thing.

The movie is directed by Blake Edwards, one of Hollywood's most versatile  directors who had a knack for comedy. His list of credits include acting ,writing, producing & directing. His directing credits include: Operation Petticoat, Breakfast at Tiffanys, The Pink Panther & most sequels & The Wild Rovers. His passion for comedy & Hollywood's history is very apparent, including the pie fight scene (a la Three Stooges) near the end of the movie. EVERYONE gets hit with a pie including Natalie Wood. Through it all The Great Leslie remains spotless, the pies are flying fast & furious & yet he doesn't even get a ricochet crumb. Well, that is, he finally gets one in the face at the end of the scene.

The film is actually done in two parts, there is an intermission. The first half of the film is mostly farce, the second half is more like a traditional costume adventure movie, though the pie fight scene reverts the movie to a farce. The only complaint I have is that the movie is too long, it clocks in at 160 minutes. The movie has been beautifully remastered, there are subtitles in eight languages & a behind the scenes documentary.",1211068800,2,2745,4.758403361344538

787273,3,6304107250,"I'd have to say that I was a little disappointed when I viewed the DVD.

We've owned the VHS for years and my daughter has practically warn it out. She is going to college in the fall and I wanted her to have the DVD version and the fact that it was widescreen was even better. I didn't know that it had won an Academy Award for best sound until I read the DVD case. That would become my biggest disappointment in the DVD.

Having watched the VHS version soooooo many times, we knew pretty much every piece of dialogue and sound effects and thats why we were so sad to see that there were effects that were left out. When Professor Fate is in the sub and Max blows into the communication tube, there is suppose to be wacky sound that is so harsh that Fate is blown over. But in our DVD version, Fate is blown over without the sound effect. The scene looses a unique element towards the comedic impact.

We still love the movie and Jack Lemmon steals the show. Blake Edwards has become my daughter's favorite director (at least for his early slapstick comedies).

(Update) My daughter is now out of college and one of the few graduates to be working her dream job, which happens to be in NYC and she still has the DVD. So, when the rest of the family was desperate to recite all those GREAT lines (You rise! You shine!), we turned to the Instant Videos here on Amazon.

How can you not enjoy a Blake Edwards film with a cast including Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, Peter Falk, Natalie Wood, Larry Storch and Denver Pyle?

Tony Curtis plays ""The Great Leslie,"" a daredevil who escapes every stunt unscathed.  His foe, played magnificantly by Jack Lemmon, is ""Professor Fate,"" also a daredevil, but always plagued by misfortune.  They embark on a race around the world (New York to Paris) accompanied by their assistants (Peter Falk and Keenan Wynn) and a beautiful female reporter played by Natalie Wood.

Watch for the fabulous costumes that Natalie Wood wears.  In particular, the endless selection of furs that she wears during the winter scenes in Alaska.  This film also includes one of the greatest pie fights ever filmed.  You can only imagine how many times they had to stop shooting to allow Tony Curtis to change into clean clothes.

787391,4,6304107250,"Two films were made in 1965 that both catered to the current interest in turn-of-the-20th-Century history and wacky humor: The Great Race and Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines. The former was also a spoof on slapstick humor, like the Keystone Cops, and early melodramas that featured heroes in white hats and villains in black. Most of the slapstick, along with the black duds, come from villains Jack Lemmon and Peter Falk. Tony Curtis provides the white hat, and Natalie Wood offers a bodice bountiful, along with the most costume changes ever seen in a single film. Director Blake Edwards is known for his off-the-wall humor, as evidenced by the Pink Panther series; but here he tips his hat to the icons of the silent era, as well as snubs his nose at the cliches: barroom brawls, pie fights, booby-trapped cars, sword fights, escapes from castles, mistaken identities, crazy racing machines, daredevil feats, crazy flying machines - it's all here.

Most of the Wild West section was based upon the famous Errol Flynn - Olivia de Havilland movie Dodge City. I would recommend that film to anyone who likes watching ballroom fights, stampedes, train wrecks, gun fights, attempted lynchings, etc. These types of events were handled much better, and were far more entertaining, in the original. The Great Race if fun, but Dodge City is more fun. As a matter of fact, I'm sure the Great Leslie was based upon Errol Flynn - who else? He's just been ""modernized"" to a turn-of-the-20th-Century hero. He's good; but nothing compares with the original.

The basic plot of the Great Race is a loosely historical auto race, set at the turn of the last century, from New York to Paris in order to prove who the greatest manufacturer of automobiles is. It is also to prove who the greatest daredevil is: The Great Leslie (Tony Curtis) or Professor Fate (Jack Lemmon). The course offers many interesting locales, including the Old West, Russia and a generic Bavarian kingdom with an emperor that looks like Professor Fate, also played by Jack Lemmon. Natalie Wood plays an emancipated lady reporter wanting to be accepted by men on their own terms, but ends up torn between her desire to compete with The Great Leslie and to swoon in his arms. Keenan Wynn plays The Great Leslie's assistant, who has no time for an emancipated woman, especially one he believes has been planted by Professor Fate to cause them to lose the race. And Peter Falk plays Professor Fate's assistant, who is not above sabotaging the other competitors' vehicles, or doing anything else devious or underhanded in order to win. It's all a lot of fun.

It's amazing how many parallels there are between Ken Annakin's Those Incredible Men and Blake Edwards' The Great Race. One might almost think they were looking over each other's shoulders and stealing from each other. But there is quite a different flavor to each. Those Magnificent Men is strongly British and very realistic, whereas The Great Race is strongly American and very tongue-in-cheek. As wonderful as both films are - especially for art, costume and other technical departments - it's hard to believe that the only Oscar either of them won was for sound effects, which went to The Great Race. But, when you consider that they were competing against The Sound of Music and Dr. Zhivago, maybe it's not so hard to believe. In their own right, though, they're both still wonderful.

""The Great Race"" along with ""It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World"", ""Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines"" and others from their time remind us how great comedic writing used to be.

Right from the beginning, the character establishment vignettes set the tone for the classic conflict of good and evil between Tony Curtis' ""The Great Leslie"" and Jack Lemon's ""Professor Fate"". The movie is a non-stop comedy that has some of the finest moments in comedic film. Featuring wonderful appearances by such character actors as Arthur O'Connel, Vivian Vance, Larry Storch, and Ross Martin (as the unforgettable Baron Rolfe von Stuppe); the Great Race still holds up well after 40 years.

Though lacking the all star cast that that 1963 comedy had, ""The Great Race"" is every bit as funny and ranks up with ""It's A Mad,Mad..."" as one of the greatest slapstick comedies ever made.

Daredevil The Great Leslie (Tony Curtis) is loved by all: talented, handsome and kind, he is the ideal man for many woman and his stunts have made him a millionaire. Everyone loves him. Well, almost every one. Enter Leslie's arch nemesis, Professor Fate (Jack Lemmon). Along with his not very smart henchman (to put it mildly) Max (Peter Falk), Professor Fate will stop at nothing to top Leslie and become him. However, every attempt goes hilariously wrong. But he then hatches a scheme that he knows won't fail. He will complete against Leslie in a 20, 000 mile race from New York to Paris and beat him, thus winning the respect of the world. Also competing is beautiful suffragette newspaper reporter Maggie DuBois (Natalie Wood), who captures the eye of both Leslie and Fate. Everything culminates into a nonstop laugh riot, including the greatest pie fight in the history of entertainment.

""The Great Race"" is a classic comedy that is guaranteed to make anyone laugh. I highly recommend it.",1122508800,,1302,4.756637168141593
787471,5,6304107250,"Whether you prefer comedy, romance, or just plain swashbuckling fun, ""The Great Race"" has it all.  This film is one of the most enjoyable adventures I've ever had the pleasure to see.

Tony Curtis plays the famous Leslie --- The GREAT Leslie --- whose hair is always perfectly combed, whose clothes are always a pristine, unblemished white.  He gets kissed by all the pretty ladies, and his teeth and eyes glint with the requisite *bling!* sound.  His Houdini-style daredevil-dom has made him a famous man and his accomplishments make him formidable.

Enter the nemesis, Professor Fate (played by Jack Lemmon) ---  a man who dresses in black, wears a sinister mustache...and whose schemes to outsmart The Great Leslie consistently fail.

When Leslie proposes a long race --- from New York to Paris --- Fate and his sticky sidekick Max gleefully enter, determined to beat Leslie at his own game.

Natalie Wood plays a determined sufragette eager to emancipate women from mental slavery --- ""out of the kitchens, and off the pedestals!""  She invades a newspaper office in order to secure a way of reporting the race from start to finish.  Her own determined schemes get her entangled in the life of The Great Leslie in more ways than one!

And so, from New York to Paris, we follow our hero, heroine, and arch-enemy through many adventures, including a barroom brawl, a melting iceberg, a foreign prison, a duel with sabers, and the best pie fight in film history!

From the opening credits to the humorous ending, this film provides fun for anybody.  Tony Curtis and Natalie Wood create good chemistry, Jack Lemmon is equally brilliant in BOTH his hilarious roles, and the supporting cast is fantastic.  I highly recommend this film!

787472,4,6304107250,"As the other reviews say, The Great Race is simple, silly, fun -- evil plots that go disastrously wrong, a barroom brawl, even a pie fight.  Hero all in white, villain all in black.

Unlike most 60's comedies, it wears well.  I think it's really a parody of the tiresome ""hey I'm funny"" school of 60's comedies starring idiots like Buddy Hackett or Terry-Thomas.  Jack Lemmon's villain is so (deliberately) overdone that it's a parody all by itself.  The rest of the leads are primarily actors, not comedians or comic actors, and they get all the best laughs.  This is not to say that Lemmon and Falk's riffs on Laurel & Hardy, or huge brawls, or melodramatic swordplay, or pie fights, aren't funny.  But they aren't the soul of this movie.

Time has not been kind to 60's movie comedies.  ""Those Magnificent Men,"" ""Mad, Mad, World,"" even ""Cat Ballou"" are tedious, almost embarrassing.  ""The Great Race"" makes the short list of those that can still make us laugh.",1117411200,3,963,4.678571428571429
787473,2,6304107250,"In theory I should have loved this Blake Edwards film. I'm a big fan of slapstick comedy. And I understand what type of movie Edwards was trying to make but ""The Great Race"" seems to be too many things at once. And that hurts it.

 The first half hour or so of the film reminds me of the wilde coyotte/road runner cartoons. We see Professor Fate (Jack Lemmon) try out his inventions just to see them one by one fail. The opening scenes are built around a single joke at the end. It's set-up punchline, set-up punchline, set-up punchline. And this goes on for a half hour. That's wasted film. They didn't have to show us the same thing over and over. We're smart, we get the picture. We understand who these characters are from the very beginning. Because we know what Edwards is doing. Tony Curtis (The Great Leslie) is the hero. How do we know? Because he wears white, women like him and when he smiles his teeth sparkle. Jack Lemmon is the villian. How do we know? Because he wears black and has a mustache. Remember all the villians in those 1920 comedies always had a mustache. So it's all very easy.

 I going to let you in on a little secret, but you have to promise not to tell anyone. I'm actually not a big Blake Edwards fan. You may find this odd but I find that I enjoy his more serious films more. I think ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is a great film. I enjoy ""Days of Wine & Roses"", and I like ""Victor\Victoria"". This is a comedy I suppose but I always think of it more so as a musical. I never really had too much with his ""Pink Panther"" movies. I enjoyed the first two ""A Shot in the Dark"" and ""The Pink Panther"" but I think Edwards made too many sequels. He tried his hardest to cash in. I don't like ""A Fine Mess"" or ""Switch"" either. So I guess I'm not the right audience for this movie.

 ""The Great Race"" starts off with a caption ""For Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy"" is those names mean nothing to you, you too are no the right audience for this movie. As I first started watching the movie I wonder how is this even related to Laurel & Hardy's comedy. Then I noticed Lemmon and Peter Falk (Lemmon's trusted sidekick Max) are Laurel & Hardy.

 As I said ""The Great Race"" wants to be too many things at once. It wants to be a slapstick comedy\adventure\romance and I think if they had more time secretly it also wants to be a musical. Edwards has too much on his plate. The movie never quite sets a proper tone. And I have to admit, no matter how mad people get, I didn't find the movie all that funny.

 But this is not to say the movie is a complete dud. It's not. I like Lemmon's performance as Prince Hapnik. It's a little over the top, and too cartoonish, but in a movie like this he fits right in. I also enjoyed Natalie Woods' performance, who spends much of the second half of the film in her underwear (wink, wink). And if you're going to make an old-fashion comedy like this you just gotta have a great pie fight. And I like the score by Henry Mancini, who's music is always pleasing. But that about does it.

 I see I'm the odd man out here, everyone seems to like this movie. But if I went along with the parade I wouldn't be honest with myself. I'm simply think the movie is too long, not funny, and tries to do too many things at once. I don't hate this movie, but I don't like it either. I'm sort of in the middle of the road.

 Bottom-line: Not a very funny Blake Edwards comedy. Goes on way too long and combines too many different genre without setting a proper place. One of the best things about the film is Natalie Woods in her undies.",1116028800,5,3565,4.192982456140351

It is turn of the century madness where invention and challenge were the entertainments of the era. Lemmon will have you laughing with his eccentric behavior and constant harassment of his sidekick Max, which my son has compared to two kids playing at imaginary adventures inside a clubhouse,as he pits himself as a perennial loser against the perfectionist performance of Tony Curtis as our purified hero. There are added attractions such as Natalie Wood and a great supporting cast including Ross Martin as the Baron. The film attempts to re-create the colorfulness of 1900 in the scenery and travels the globe in the process respective to the film's plot of a world circling auto race during the time of automobile infancy.

IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD and THE HALLELUJAH TRAIL make up two of the big three. The other is THE GREAT RACE, Blake Edward's 159 minute slapstick excursion, restored on DVD in complete roadshow fashion, with overture, intermission, entr'acte, and exit music. And yet, for a film of this type, it is less about the race than about the rivalry between Professor Fate (Jack Lemmon) and the Great Leslie (Tony Curtis). There is precious little racing, and though the film is far from boring and has much going for it (the finale to Part One is brilliant) one can't help but wonder what it would have been like if the other entries in the race regrouped after being snuffed out and made their mad dashes for the forefront. That would make it THE GREAT RACE. Also, the lack of other challenge leaves a depressing side effect; the film seems mildly unfinished and undernourished, like 2 hours and 40 minutes of a 3 plus hour movie. And yet, the film has so much going for it that to ignore it is rather unfair. What there is  (I should note that due to the previously noted flaws, the chapters on the disc make it a more pleasing experience) is very well made, and one can appreciate what they put into it.

787590,4,6304107250,"THE GREAT RACE may not be a masterpiece--but it is a perfect choice for a cold and rainy night: stylish, frothy, and often flatly hilarious, it makes for ""comfort viewing"" at its best.

One of the movie's several charms is that it draws heavily from Victorian cliches that still linger in the public mind, gives them a gentle comic spin, and then drops them into the tale of an early 1900s auto race from New York to Paris by way of Siberia.  Add to this a heap of favorite character actors, a big budget, flamboyant period costumes, and the biggest pie fight ever filmed, and you have a movie where there is always something to enjoy on the screen.

The great thing about THE GREAT RACE are the performances, which are very broad but endowed with a sly humor.  The comedy accolades here go to Jack Lemmon and Peter Falk as the notorious Dr. Fate and his bumbling sidekick Max--wonderful bits of acting that will have you hooting with laughter in every scene--and Dorothy Provine scores memorably in a cameo as Lily Olay, the bombshell singer who presides over the most rootin'-tootin' saloon this side of the Pecos.

But every one, from Tony Curtis and the lovely Natalie Wood down to such cameo performers as Vivian Vance, get in plenty of comic chops as the film drifts from one outrageous episode to another: suffergettes crowding a newspaper, the biggest western brawl imaginable, polar bears, explosions, daredevil antics, and a subplot lifted from THE PRISONER OF ZENDA agreeably crowd in upon each other.  True, the film does seem over-long and may drag a bit in spots, but it never drags for very long, and it's all in good fun--and the production values and memorable score easily tide over the bare spots.

The DVD bonuses aren't anything to write home about, and the film has not been restored per se--the color seems a bit faded here and there--but the print is remarkably clean and the widescreen format is an essential.  This would be an excellent selection for a family movie night--or for any evening when you're alone and feeling a bit blue.  Break out the popcorn, curl up on you sofa, and... as Dr. Fate would say... ""Push the button, Max!""

A local critic here in Minneapolis compared Race with Magnificent Men in a somewhat unfavorable vein.  One evening I found myself casting about for a movie to see and found nothing more interesting than The Great Race available; I went in with that review somewhat souring my attitude.  When I left the theatre almost 3 hours later my ribs literally ached from having laughed so hard and often.

Jack Lemon and Tony Curtis are absolutely hilarious in their roles as Professor Fate and The Great Leslie.  Natalie Wood and Peter Falk are equally delightful in their supporting roles as a reporter and Professor Fate's not-very-bright henchman.  One of the other pleasures this movie offers is spotting all the movie and TV stars in small roles.  Keenan Wynn, Vivian Vance, Larry Storch, and Ross Martin are among the faces you might recognize.

And I still enjoy it in spite of its flaws I couldn't detect when I was younger -- it's just too darn long, the Prisoner of Zenda takeoff needs to be edited more tightly, and the Maggie DuBois character is just plain annoying. But when it's funny, it's hilarious, with one of the most underrated punchlines in film history (the response to the line ""Leslie just left town with a friar."").
So I'd love to be able to recommend the DVD, but I can't give it more than a passing grade.
First, the pluses. It's nice to have it presented in a roadshow format, with an overture, intermission and exit music. And it's past time this movie was released in widescreen (you can see the stack of pies before the fight breaks out, where I've seen cropped versions that leave you wondering where all the pies came from). The digital transfer produces a clean, sharp picture. And I'm not a stickler for pristine sound, so the remix of what is, after all, a nearly 40-year-old movie is serviceable enough. The performances (save Natalie Wood's) are quite good. And I've always thought this was one of Henry Mancini's best scores, especially the theme that plays over the beginning and end of the race.
But the minuses are huge. The movie cries out for commentary, if not from Blake Edwards, then at least from Tony Curtis and Peter Falk. The making-of feature is from 1965 and is representative of the studio hype of the time, but it adds nothing to the enjoyment of the film. A documentary about the making of the film (and the real-life 1908 race New York to Paris race that inspired it) are sorely missed. And I hope whoever screwed up the sound cues during the opening credits (cheers for Professor Fate???) had their mustache snapped off.
If you like the film, buy it. The price is right and this is likely to be the only DVD edition we're going to get. If you're only mild about the film, never mind. There's nothing here to change your mind.",1043625600,3,2024,4.487804878048781

""Race"" is at once a headlong adventure and a spoof of old silent melodrama, with Lemmon as the black-clad and black-hearted Professor Fate, Curtis as the spotless hero The Great Leslie (a professional daredevil), and Wood as Maggie DuBois, suffragette and would-be reporter (a character clearly modelled on Nellie Bly).  It also includes a send-up of Anthony Hope's swashbuckling novel ""Prisoner of Zenda"" in which Lemmon takes on a secondary role, as the cackling, far-too-fond-of-wine king whom Fate is coerced into replacing on the throne.  Peter Falk as Fate's assistant Max steals every scene he's in (the man should have gotten the Best Supporting Actor Oscar), and such veterans as Keenan Wynn (as Leslie's assistant Hezekiah) and Ross Martin (as a sinister but suave nobleman) add their high-octane skills.

Directed by Blake Edwards (Mr. Julie Andrews and director of movies like The Pink Panther and 10.) this film is the hilarious story of to aristocratic racers racing from New York to Paris. Set in the year 1908 at a time were classic cars were really classic cars the movie has slapstick, special effects, wonderful period costumes and the most important element of all - humor.

This movie was made in the in style of not taking itself seriously enough to break the fourth wail. The fourth wall is when a character in a movie looks into the camera and allows the audience to interact with him or her. Either with the eyes or actually speaking to the camera while performing in the scene in real time. There is also a magic charm about the good guy (Tony Curtis) smiles and an animated `sparkle' appears in his teeth.
Jack Lemon is the one who is having the most fun. As you'll read in my other reviews, you'll discover that my favorite actor of all time is Mr. Lemon. He plays the incredible evil Professor Fate. He play is way over the top down to his mustache and evil his walk. The most creative part about Jack was his other character he played as the drunk and obnoxious Prince of Bulvergaria.
Natalie wood plays an overbearing reporter, Ed Wynn plays Tony Curtis' (The Great Leslie) right hand man and mechanic and a stellar performance by Peter Falk as Professor Fates bumbling sidekick. There is also a reoccurring role by Viviane Vance. Also another great villain performance was by Mr. Ross Martin of TV's The Wild Wild West fame. He wields a mean foil and saber!
The DVD extras are great. The original behind the scenes look and some interesting cast and crew notes. The DVD and the movie are great examples of movie making at its best.

His chief competition is Jack Lemmon as the inept Dr. Fate, the villain with many tricks up his sleeve, most of which never work.  Along with them in the race is Natalie Wood as Maggie DuBois, a feminist newspaperwoman out to prove that women are men's equal.  Their adventure takes them through the Old West and an old fashioned bar room brawl, on an iceberg, and through the Court intrigues of a mythical European country about to crown a new king who looks very much like Dr. Fate.  Director Blake Edwards throws everything he can into this comedy, with tons of sight gags and physical humour.  His biggest asset in the film is Jack Lemmon.  Lemmon goes over - way over - way, way over the top in his characterization of the villain, the kind of villain found in silent films, all dressed in black with the sinister moustache to boot.  With his wicked laugh and constant shouting, he's not exactly subtle, but he gives the film the edge and energy it needs to sustain the drier, less interesting parts surrounding Curtis and Wood.  Lemmon is well assisted by Peter Falk as Max, Dr. Fate's poor assistant. The rest of the cast is fine, including Vivian Vance as Wood's boss' wife, another feminist.  It's rare to see Vance in a theatrical film, although she has few scenes to shine.  I admire the film and those involved for trying everything and anything and playing it with much energy.  Not every scene works, and not all the gags work, but the film is worth a look, if only to see Lemmon like you'll never see him in another film.

It's silly, it's frothy, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and half the cast have their controls set to Ludicrously Over The Top mode.  But who cares?  It's one of the most enjoyable films that I've ever had the pleasure to watch.
The film would be worth the price of admission just by the acting talents of Jack Lemmon as the dangerously devious Professor Fate and Peter Falk portraying the Henchman of Evil, Max.  Constantly trying to out-act each in the Insanely Evil department, there are portions of the film where their scenery chewing simply can't be measured by conventional science.  Tony Curtis and Natalie Wood are far more subdued in their performances and as a result their scenes are slightly less entertaining.  Of course, anything less than those two actors jumping around like orangutans would have seemed subdued in comparison, so we almost welcome the change in pace.
There are only a few portions of the film that don't quite work for me.  I didn't find the main romance between Tony Curtis' Great Leslie and Natalie Wood's modern woman to be much in the way of entertainment.  It's certainly expected, given the script is satirizing the type of movie where the good guy always gets the girl.  Yet it never felt quite plausible, just gratuitous and hastily tacked on, as if the romance was only happening because the story conventions said that it had to happen.  Neither one of the characters seems to be all that interested in their romance either, which at least gave them something in common with me.  I realize it seems odd to criticize an outrageous and off-the-wall comedy for not portraying a realistic romance, but all of those scenes are played so seriously and so straight, that one has to wonder if perhaps the joke is that there aren't any jokes.  I couldn't understand the need to break away from the hilarity of the main story into an uninvolved, lackluster, and pseudo-heartwarming subplot.  Whatever the reasons, it generally failed to entertain me.
And speaking of non-entertainment, I'm afraid that thanks to the DVD chapter breaks, I'll never sit through an entire performance of that musical number again (He Shouldn't-a, Hadn't-a, Oughtn't-a huh?).  Fortunately, these minor irritations only take up the smallest portion of the film.  The poorer scenes never go on for very long, the merriment from the rest will more than make up for anything that fails to amuse.
THE GREAT RACE is definitely worth a DVD purchase.  The restored picture is absolutely gorgeous and the sound quality is terrific.  The Behind The Scenes featurette is cute, featuring a fair amount of raw, backstage footage and also a cheesy 1960's narrator reading a script that could have been penned by Professor Fate after a night on downers.  Definitely a film to enjoy again and again, THE GREAT RACE will be a welcome addition to your DVD collection, and one that is just perfect for a rainy Sunday afternoon.",1024012800,9,3076,4.791666666666667
787773,5,6304107250,"The DVD version of ""The Great Race"" is long overdue. It's silly and fun; reunites Lemmon & Curtis; it's an homage to all the great slapstick that EVERYONE loves. What's wrong with having fun?  I truly believe that Blake Edwards deserves more consideration that he's been given. Anyone remember ""Operation Petticoat"" or ""The Pink Panther""? We're talking about a career of almost 50 years...and Hollywood doesn't take him seriously. Anyone remember ""Victor/Victoria"" or ""That's Life""? How about ""Breakfast at Tiffany's""? These are all films that are respected and admired, but Edwards seems to be on the back-burner when awards are handed out. It's a shame; Edwards has given us no more than pure entertainment, well-presented. His most nominated film is ""The Great Race"", so purely devoted to period detail, though it received no Oscar nominations for sets or costumes (it was nominated for Cinematography, Sound, Music, Song, Editing, and won for Sound Effects). Indeed, Mancini's score was gorgeous; the song, ""The Sweetheart Tree"" has become a standard/classic. The Oscar should have gone to Peter Falk. I saw this as a kid in its initial release, and, when I told my friends how much I liked it, my teenage peers told me how shallow I was, that I should see ""The Pawnbroker"" or ""Ship of Fools"". Well, for God's sake, I was a kid (and I did see and admire those films) but the pure, grand display of craziness that Blake Edwards presented to me has never been forgotten. I've gotten older, and have been subjected to a whole bunch of stuff in the meantime, and I've waited for the DVD release of ""The Great Race"". Let's not forget that Blake Edwards also directed ""The Days of Wine and Roses"" and ""Experiment in Terror"". He is not frivolous nor is he simple. He does crazy comedy as well as riveting drama. His comedies are wonderful, but none as totally overwhelming and enjoyable as ""The Great Race"". See and enjoy!!",1023321600,151,1920,4.853658536585366
787774,5,6304107250,"Blake Edwards ""The Great Race"" (1965)(was loosely based on a real 1908 auto race) is 160 minutes of WideScreen (Enhanced for WideScreen TV's) TECHNICOLOR action packed comedy staged in the 1908 world of the automobile race.
The major difference is this race is 20,000 miles in length orignating in New York City to Paris, France.  The main characters & arch enemies are ""The Great Leslie"" (Tony Curtis) dressed always in white, driving the ""Leslie Special"".  This customized automobile is also white!!!.  His nemesis rival ""Professor Fate"" (Jack Lemmon) dressed entirely in black!!  His auto is the ""Hannible 8"" also in black.  The love interest & newspaper suffragette (Natalie Wood) provides the balance to this diabolical race.
This movie builds all the characters perfectly & include all of the necessary gimmicks throughout to include; a massive Western barroom brawl, elaborate Royal Ball, swash buckling sword fight, a Royal Prince coupe attempt & a 2357 pie fight to name a few.
The extras include a 45 minute behind the scenes featurette.
The picture 2001 digital transfer & the 5.1 dolby sound are the best there is!!!  This movie is a true family film and is one of the all time most lavish, funniest, wildest comedies ever (If not the last from the great Warner Brothers Hollywood productions).  The movie even has entrance, intermission and exit music to give the old flavor of the big Hollywood films.

The new print is GREAT!But Warner has made a huge mistake on this DVD.The problem, and it is a major one, is with the new Dolby Digital soundtrack. In some scenes in the beginning of the movie the dialogue is barely audible. And during the opening credits when everyone boos Professor Fate and cheers The Great Leslie, someone switched it to everyone cheering the villain and booing the hero. The French audio track has the original soundtrack which correctly has the boos for Fate and cheers for Leslie. This is a MAJOR mistake! Warner should recall this DVD and  restore the soundtrack to the way it is supposed to be. For fans of this movie, it ruins what would otherwise be a great DVD.",1023321600,60,815,4.506756756756757

My only complaint is the mistake that has been made in the soundtrack at the beginning of the opening titles.  As the screen flashes a title card for each star, as if for an old melodrama at the cinema, the audience's reaction on the soundtrack is supposed to be booing for Jack Lemon's bad guy character, cheering for Tony Curtis' heroic character, and whistling for Natalie Wood's.  Unfortunately it is recreated incorrectly on the DVD with cheering for Lemon, booing and whistling for Curtis, and whistling for Wood.  I'm not sure how this happened, as the mono French soundtrack on the DVD has it correct!

But no other movie gave him as much freedom to go so madly, joyously, deliriously over the top - and not just in one role, but two. The structure of this Blake Edwards celebration of slapstick gives the actors plenty of breathing room, and no one breathes more deeply than Lemmon. Whether chortling Dr. Fate's signature line (""PUSSSHH ... the button, Max!""), looking down in cross-eyed vexation after Peter Falk removes half his mustache, blowing chicken feathers out of his mouth in dizzy triumph moments before he falls flat on his face, pontificating in the most ridiculous Scots burr since James Finlayson read the riot act to Laurel & Hardy, hanging onto a flagpole above a New York city street and cackling with mad abandon, mincing around as a bibulous fey potentate, or just mugging with his trademark gesture - chin down, put-upon grimace on his face, brow cocked, lids at half-mast, eyes staring disgustedly up at an angle - Jack Lemmon is protean: a one-man traveling carnival of comic invention. Is it broad? Absolutely. Subtle? Not much. Funny? No one funnier. This was the first Jack Lemmon movie  I ever saw, around the age of 11; I thought he was the cat's meow.

787863,5,6304107250,"This has to be one of the all time classic comedies -- chock full of yocks. The Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, Natalie Wood combination is a real treat which stands the test of time and is as fresh today as when it was first released.

Set in the early 20th century, the flick concerns an ongoing competion of two dare-devils who continuously try to top the charts. Tony Curtis is 'The Great Leslie', who always wears white, is superbly competent in every thing he tries, and who's shining white teeth sparkle in the sun.

Jack Lemmon portrays the dastardly 'Professor Fate', who is always trying to top (or undermine) the stunts of the Great Leslie ... and who's efforts usually wind up in a farmer's mud pond with his side kick, Max (Peter Falk). ""Well, there's another one the Great Leslie can try on for size! ** collapses **""

Natalie Wood is Maggie DuBois, an attractive cigar smoking suffrogette whose goal in life is to free women of 'the drugery of being either servants or saints'. ""Out of the laundry rooms and off the pedestals!""

After a number of short skits where we are introduced to the players (and the hilarious results), the three become contestants in a vintage car race from New York to Paris via Alaska. One situation after another develops leaving us laughing as Professor Fate tries to win the race his way -- by cheating.

Situations develop in the American West, Alaska, the Bering Sea, Russia, Middle Europe and finally Paris -- and the pie fight has to be on of the best I've ever seen. Timing and situation development is perfect here.

The ending comes as a surprise (sort of) so I won't ruin it here -- see the movie.

This film will make a great addition to your growing library and is suitable for viewing (and enjoyable) by all ages. It's not a terribly deep movie, but it is very, very entertaining as a number of plots develop at the same time.

I haven't seen the DVD yet (as it's not yet released) but look forward to owning it. I do have the VHS version and am wearing it out thru use.

Get it. Enjoy it. ""Push the button, Max!""

mishap, and a beautiful woman for the guys to watch (like Natalie Wood). :)
  One interesting thing to me is Peter Falk, who played Max in this movie. I only knew him as ""Columbo"" (a detective with the tan rumpled trenchcoat on TV), but I never saw him before in any other movies, until now. Peter Falk, in this movie, was younger and he was nice looking then! :)
  Of course, I LOVED Jack Lemmon in this movie, and he even played a duel role as Prof. Fate and a drunken prince! I liked his handlebar moustache by the way. :) I never knew he can act so well in both this movie and ""Some Like It Hot"". :)

787866,3,6304107250,"I don't have the patience, or the bladder, for many of the roadshow-spectacles of the 60s. There's something obscene about not just the profligate wasting of money, but the very concept of 2 1/2 & 3-hour comedies. And THE GREAT RACE shares many of these defects. The big-bigger-biggest aesthetic is completely at odds with what great comedy is all about; too many of the gags here fall flatter than a pancake as a result. Precision timing is tossed to the wayside so that we can get an eyeful of the money being spent at every opportunity: the opening dedication to Laurel & Hardy may be well-meant, but the 150 minutes that follow make such sentiments ring hollow when you consider the combined budget of EVERY short and feature Stan & Ollie made is less than what this white elephant cost to produce. Still, THE GREAT RACE ain't ALL velvet curtains and Busby Berkeley pie fights. The late Jack Lemmon, nicely abetted by Peter Falk, makes this elephantine epic worth investing in a beaded seat-cushion to sit through. His dual turn as Professor Fate and the Prince of Potsdorf is deliriously, enthrallingly over the top. Rarely did Lemmon throw caution to the wind like this; you'll wish he did it more often after watching him release his deranged comic muse out of its cage. Subtle it ain't, but that's the joy of it. And as soon as the plot extricates itself from his crazed grip to return to Tony Curtis and Natalie Wood, you'll appreciate his mustache-twirling bombast twice as much. Rarely mentioned when cineastes gather to collate the Jack Lemmon canon, THE GREAT RACE is nevertheless his finest comic turn; it's only due to Lemmon and Falk that you can refer to this overlong mess as a comedy at all.

This isn't a smart or sophisticated film, but rather a slapstick romp of epic proportions. It's loaded with sight gags and funny lines and you have to keep your eyes and ears open to catch it all.
Curtis, Lemmon and Wood are excellent as the classic hero, villain, and damsel in (not so much) distress, but perhaps the most notable contributions come from some of the other players. Most notable in this regard is Peter Falk, who is outstanding as Professor Fate's (Lemmon) assistant, Max.
The beginning sets the tone. The Great Leslie (Curtis) and Fate are arch rivals, and they don't much like each other, either. Of course Fate always comes out on the short end of everything. Enter Wood as ""emancipated"" Maggie DuBois (the setting is the beginning of the 20th century) and the race is on.
Though it is long, the movie has lots of great sequences. The opening exhibitions by Leslie and Fate, the beginning of the race(where Max has sabotaged other cars), the saloon fight in Boracho, floating on the iceberg, the duel, and the pie fight, just to mention some of them.

Memorable scenes abound throughout the  movie:Professor Fate with his thumbs stuck in the periscope, the barroom  brawl with Texas Jack (gotta love Larry Storch) while Dorothy Provine sings  ""You shouldna hadna outna swang on me""...I still know all the  words!, the Ice Float and Pie Fight rank as true classics.  Perhaps best  remembered for Jack Lemmon's playing Professor Fate ""Why you thimble  headed Gurkin"", ""Id like to see the Great Leslie try that  ONE"", and ""rise and shine, YOU rise YOU shine"" have become  standard one liners in my family's daily banter! The list is as endless as  some of the laughs....buy it and enjoy it for what it is...entertainment!",940377600,9,915,4.64375
788004,5,6304107250,"I lost track of how many times I have seen this film. Fate's evil character combined with his  (and Max's) incompentence score points with me.  ""Genius Max, positive Genius. What's next?""  ""Car  number 5, the engine falls out!""",937267200,4,227,4.894736842105263
788005,5,6304107250,"I only hope that someday I get to meet Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis or Peter Falk and ask them if they had as much fun making this movie as it seems.
I've introduced several people to this movie and now they're all  big fans. The comedy is broad and slap-stick by today's standards, but that  can be a plus: the movie makes no pretenses and simply has fun with it all.  The characters are as good/evil and (literally) black and white (right down  to the glint in the Great Leslie's eye) as can be, and that's the  point.
A tip: If you'll be watching the movie for the first time, be  patient with the setup. The back-and-forth between Leslie and Fate is  establishing the characters, but most first-timers expect the whole movie  to be like that. Wait for it. The fun really begins when the idea of the  race is first introduced in the boardroom.",935884800,3,842,4.380645161290323

7861897,3,6304107250,"Absolutely one of my favorite movies .. but this Blu-ray version is a huge disappointment. Warner Brothers clearly took NO TIME and made NO EFFORT in this Blu-Ray transfer: it is the DVD on a higher capacity disk. I looked at my old DVD version and notice no difference in picture quality. In fact, the sound on the Blu-Ray version seems to be mixed down to mono, not the stero of the DVD or the wonderful, bright sound I remember from the theaters.

For $16, I was not expecting a Criterion version (say... when WILL Criterion do a release of this one??); but I was expecting something much, much more.

5 stars for the great movie, 0 stars for the Blu-Ray. If Amazon would have allowed for 2.5 stars, that's would have been my grade.",1522540800,,735,4.437037037037037
