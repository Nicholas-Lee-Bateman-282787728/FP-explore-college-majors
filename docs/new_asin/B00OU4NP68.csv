6761385,1,B00OU4NP68,"I saw this show on PBS and it was great.

The music and video were wonderful on the TV show.

Having said that DO NOT BUY THIS  DVD.  IT WILL NOT PLAY IN A U.S. BLU RAY PLAYER WITHOUT
SKIPPING.

IT IS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING AND UNBELIEVABLE THAT AMAZON WOULD ALLOW IT TO BE ADVERTISED AND SHIPPED
TO U.S. CUSTOMERS

What a shame and rip-off to be selling a DVD in the U.S.  that is NOT compatible with U.S. BLU RAY PLAYERS

The Blu-Ray DVD that I receive apparently is not designed to work on DVD players that we have here in the U.S.

I ordered this DVD on January 2 and in the meantime, Amazon has posted a warning about this incompatibility issue with U.S. players.

I received the DVD yesterday and I want to let everyone know that the warning about not working on U.S. Blu Ray players is correct.

I am not sure why Amazon is listing and selling this product to U.S. customers.

I would hope that all future orders that are being shipped to U.S. customers would be cancelled and this product withdrawn from sale
in the U.S.",1423008000,3,1027,4.291666666666667
6761386,4,B00OU4NP68,"First things first: amazon and some of the reviewers of this disc are wrong, wrong, WRONG when they state that this disc is a Region-B-only disc that will not play in most Blu Ray players. Had anyone at amazon actually examined the product they are selling, they would have seen that the disc is region-free: i.e.: it plays in regions A, B & C. On a personal note, I have tried to advise amazon of their glaring error by providing links to just about every other commercial site out there, all of which show CORRECTLY that the disc is Region-free. But amazon in its great wisdom refuses to change their ""Region-B-only"" warning because they 1. can't be bothered to traipse down to their own warehouses to physically examine the product (which CLEARLY says on its back that the disc is playable in regions ABC), and 2. choose to believe a couple of reviewers whose very reviews put the lie to the idea that the BluRay isn't coded to play in Region A.

UPDATE 2/29/16: Here we are a YEAR later, and amazon still has a disclaimer on this product that INCORRECTLY says it is a Region-B only disc. It is not. It is an All-Region BluRay.

Now that that's off my chest, the review:

The 2015 edition of the Vienna Philharmonic New Year's Concert saw Zubin Mehta back on the podium after an eight year absence. Mehta has mellowed a bit in that time, and the program seems to reflect that.

The orchestra plays with its usual style and finesse, though the fireworks are kept to a minimum. There's a lot of beautiful legato playing to be had here, which is enjoyable to hear when so many ensembles feel the need to punch and pull at music these days. In a word, ""tradition"" is on display, and that's a good thing. Bucking tradition, I noticed quite a few women seated at the orchestral desks this year. Brava!

The BluRay sound and picture are top drawer. Thankfully, the concert is included in its musical entirety without the contributions of Julie Andrews who serves as host for the PBS day-of broadcast. It works much better as a concert than as a TV event. The PBS version destroyed the sense of programming that one gets from the full concert version, and it's easier to stay involved without Ms Andrew's verbalizing between each number. Unbelievably, the PBS version stupidly cut Suppe's ""Morning, Noon & Night in Vienna"" that opened the concert, along with an additional 20 minutes of music. That's all included here.

If this concert has traded in the sense of occasion that was its hallmark for so many decades - morphing into a 21-st century classical music ""event"" - at least it still feels like an old, trustworthy friend, even if nothing in recent years can compare with the frisson one felt during the appearances of Karajan, Maazel and others. Only George Pretre in his 2008 appearance has come close to matching that special feeling. That said, Mehta is definitely an improvement over the 2014 concert with Barenboim and the 2013 edition with Welser-Mst, though Mehta makes a huge miscalculation in trying to control the audience's clapping in the Radetzsky March - he tries to break the clapping down into small groups of people, and the audience is basically having none of it.

The ""Boulevard"" bonus feature - which takes the viewer on an extended tour of Vienna's Ringstrasse - is well worth watching, as are the two ballet sequences.

BTW - I had no problem playing this BD in either of my Region A machines. I reiterate: the disc is coded for ALL regions, so ignore all the warnings - including those from amazon - that it's a Region B-only BluRay. It isn't.

Further BTW - I live in the USA and I purchased my disc through amazon.usa, the very site that is incorrectly informing consumers that this BluRay won't play on their Region A machines. And yet as if by magic, the BluRay does play in Region A players.

6761387,5,B00OU4NP68,"I just received this Blu-ray today from Amazon.  It states on the back of the box that it is region A/B/C, meaning it will play on virtually any Blu-ray player in the world.  I put it in my PS3 and another Blu-ray player (not region-free), and it played perfectly.  The program runs 1 hour and 55 minutes - at least 30 minutes longer than the PBS broadcast.

6761457,5,B00OU4NP68,"My mother both played (piano) and sang Strauss for us when we were children, so it could be said that we were raised on a diet of Strauss! She passed on aged almost 102 in 2009 and Strauss was the music of choice for her funeral service. Needless to say, for me the DVD was a reminder of her in so many ways. Musically and visually I found it a delight.  ( With especial thanks to the dear friend who sent this gift.)",1427414400,,417,4.024096385542169

8684967,5,B00OU4NP68,"Zubin Mehta conducted the Vienna Philharmonic New Years Concert on January 1, 2015.  Mehta was 79 years old at the time and looks easily 20 years younger.  His conducting exudes youth and vibrancy, and is a joy to watch!

If Mehta's tenure as music director of the New York Philharmonic (1978-1993) was lack luster and resulted in some poorly played live concerts and recordings, none of that is evident here.  Mehta brings this concert to a rousing start with a great ""Morning, noon and night in Vienna"" (Suppe), a nice and novel choice for a concert opener.

Blu Ray quality is excellent: sound, either stereo or surround, all I could ever desire.
There is some flicker on one Blu Ray player during playback, but fine on either of two other Samsung or Onkyo Bluray players.

If you like Strauss Polkas and Waltzes and other Viennese light music written in the 1850-1900 time frame, you can't go wrong with this.",1484611200,3,913,4.710691823899371
