Well you do get the 2D version and a hand drawn prototype and some 3D stills.

But 16.88 for a music video???

Good to learn what NOT to do with 3D and that it was done with CGI is just crazy as you generally need a bad camera and operator to get that kind of 3D.

Render it with less camera angle to tighten up the parallax and it makes a nice 99 cent video for itunes.

Caveat emptor - the people who sell this should be ashamed.",1458864000,,504,3.9019607843137254
