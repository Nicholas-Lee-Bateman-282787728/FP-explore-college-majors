8559081,5,B00AY6FRJE,"I really wish there would have been more you could have shared with all of us but I realize how painful memories can be and sometimes sharing just what we can, is hard enough. I will say that though I did see no physical abuse, clearly your father had some deep seated issues regarding sexuality. I do think he had some Pedophilia tendencies but they were latent, meaning (at least as far as you know) they were not expressed physically but certainly one doesn't have to be a scholar of psychology to clearly see you were mentally and emotionally scarred and his desires were manifested through his constant ""videotaping"" and recording you doing things that were suppose to be a private matter. He obviously used this ""videotaping"" as a means to hide his desires for you in a way that wouldn't get him caught by the authorities. I can see him also justifying the use of videotaping you so that ""you could see"" in 20 years. (although, clearly he didn't bother to tell you about any of the other videotapes he saved through the years. While videoptaping ones children is not a crime, I think his obsession with it and seeing you without clothing or bent over or even on the toilet is quite disturbing...and obviously, as we all see in one video...you were clearly not amused and I believe perhaps you knew on some level what he was doing was ""abnormal behavior for a father."" I hope that you've been able to move on from these ghosts but as a survivor of childhood sexual abuse myself, I know that it can be quite difficult to just ""get on with one's life."" These memories are always with us...and I believe it's the devil that uses these past events to slice into the very happiness we are trying to create for ourselves so that we can at least in part, live a happy, productive, emotional and spiritual life. I pray you are doing better. Thanks for sharing with us.",1395532800,,1865,4.520710059171598

8559084,5,B00AY6FRJE,"I saw this painstakingly crafted flick at the Mill Valley Film Festival a few years ago. Unforgettable. Marina's done some very important work here, artfully.",1357862400,,158,5.36
8559085,5,B00AY6FRJE,"Haunting, provocative and relevant, ""The Marina Experiment"", a highly acclaimed short documentary, is deserving of a wide audience. Marina Lutz evokes a lonely and suffocating childhood almost entirely through the use of expertly-edited still photography and audio from a vast family archive left behind by her own father. The hypnotic result leaves audiences deeply unsettled, conflicted and often polarized. Equal parts art-piece and personal document, this smart film enters the conversation about child sexualization and abuse with surgical precision, revealing the devastating results of being the subject of one's own father's voyeuristic obsession. With original music by Mick Harvey.",1357776000,,691,5.98989898989899
