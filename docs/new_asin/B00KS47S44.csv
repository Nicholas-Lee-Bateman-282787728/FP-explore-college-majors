8661105,5,B00KS47S44,"There are some pieces of music that move me to the core, because they interact with my own agonistic relationship with the Divine.  Golijov's The passion of St. Matthew; Rosinni's Stabat Mater; Verdi's Requiem; Adams'  El Nio come to mind.  And now, I must add this stunning work which had me in tears from its first powerful words.  This is perfection, and if anyone dares call me ""exaggerated"", I must answer i call it as I feel it, not for the musical bedbugs, who dislike my superlatives. What makes it even more astonishing is its source:
Minnesota!  I can hear the furious howls from fundamentalists of all stripes.  I plan to buy several copies to give to friends.",1426982400,2,671,4.6440677966101696

8661108,5,B00KS47S44,"A ""parable"" is typically a story or tale that is meant to be didactic. Generally, these tales illustrate universal truths. However, not all parables seek universality, but rather explore relational similarities. Robert Aldridge and Herschel Garfein's Parables is one such example that does not seek world-wide consensus of issues of spirituality and humanity. Their Parables, rather, is a celebration and exploration of self-and-other through faith. Aldridge and Garfein's Parables teaches us that the best way to know ourselves is to know another.

Aldridge's music is generally described as ""American,"" yet this oratorio transcends nation-state, drawing from a diverse palette of musical textures and motives. Indeed, the musical materials point to the distinctive characteristics of various peoples' exploration of humanity through ""song."" Importantly, the Hebrew, Arabic, Greek, and Latin languages are used in the libretto. Garfein's interpretation of the Torah, Qu'ran, the New Testament, and Sufi mystic poetry, combined with his sensitivity to many issues inherent in each culture's faith, as well as the respect and use of these people's languages is such an important way to experience the text. Such reverence adds depth and illuminates the stunning and penetrating melodic contours and rhythmic intensity of Aldridge's score.

All the more impressive is the production of this oratorio. All comes together miraculously, from the soloists to the University of Minnesota musicians, to the filmed images, to the cinematography, as well as the costumes of those on stage. Indeed, this superb musical experience is a blessing. To expand upon Garfein's use of Rumi: ""Who could be so lucky? Who comes to a lake for water and sees the reflection of moon.""",1407283200,2,1759,5.5353159851301115
8661109,4,B00KS47S44,"When Leonard Bernstein wrote his unique and iconoclastic ""Mass"" for the opening of Kennedy Center it was viewed as brash and theatrical; also a bit controversial for its implicit criticism of traditional Catholicism.  This bold new theatrical  ""interfaith oratorio"" by Robert Aldridge strikes me the same way and in a mostly positive vein. I am familiar with Aldridge's appealing ""American"" style mostly through his Clarinet Concerto and the stunning opera ""Elmer Gantry"" on the novel of the same name. ""Parables"" takes source material from some sacred writings - all parables - from the three major monotheistic religions; Christianity, Judaism and Islam and does not hide from the fact that they have been at odds with each other frequently throughout the years. Aldridge's source writers are of the highest respectability: Job, Jesus, the Sufi poet Rumi and related writings. The oratorio is semi-staged with singers and dancers portrayed as believers from the three faiths and who sometimes quarrel and fight and sometimes coexist in accord. It is also a nice touch (a necessary one, maybe) that the makeup of the chorus is diverse as well. Robert Aldridge's music is consistently approachable, engaging in the best ""Bernstein way""  His writing does sound very 'American' and -in this case - does hold a message of unity. The staging also uses some short video clips that support or dress the text.  The texts are certainly a message of tolerance and unity and in recognition of common ground. ""Parables"" might be seen as a 'message' work and I suppose it is. Aldridge's score is compelling though; bouyant and 'entertaining' in spots and quite lovely in others.  I also think it succeeds as ""just"" an auditory experience, without the trappings.  Robert Aldridge is a name to know and I do recommend this as an important modern choral work on contemporary religious themes.",1407110400,2,1877,5.117647058823529
