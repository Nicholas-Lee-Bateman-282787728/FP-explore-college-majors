7453228,5,B015X2I50Q,"Order this Bluray for USA and Canada.
A well produced, modern documentary with the likes of Brian May, Gene Simmons, Joe Satriani, Lars Ulrich, Phil Collen, and many others who sing the praises of Ritchie Blackmore. The common theme here is the mystery of how Blackmore...the extraordinary guitar talent of our time...is often ignored in the American public eye.
To fans & many of his peers: Blackmore is God. Even Jimmy Page has been on record admitting that he could not touch Blackmore when it comes to soloing. Blackmore came up through the British music scene ranks at virtually the same time and place as Clapton, Beck, and Page. Same cred. Yet, for some reason (especially in America) there exists this elitist attitude that only acknowledges the same old lame guys over & over again. You know...Keith Richards...yet again? Put Blackmore to play in the same room - and Richards wouldn't know whether to poop - or go blind.
Rolling Stone Magazine is the worst culprit...smugly attempting to determine who matters for all. Then they stoop to putting Kim Kardashian on their cover! No wonder Ritchie Blackmore avoids the limelight.
The unique element of this documentary however - is Blackmore's participation. Plenty of candid humour, and stories by Ritchie and his peers. Many interview extras as well.
Very Enjoyable.
I just hope that Ritchie's next wife is into hard rock.",1454112000,19,1380,5.004347826086956

7453234,5,B015X2I50Q,I really enjoyed the story of Ritchie Blackmore! It was very informative and Ritchie had quite the life through the years. The only gripe I had was I wish there was more music on it. I love Ritchie's guitar playing both with Deep Purple as well as Rainbow. I would definitely recommend this DVD who's a fan of Blackmore. You won't be disappointed.,1478649600,2,347,4.523809523809524

7453236,5,B015X2I50Q,"Deadly serious, this doccumentary is the best you will get about Ritchie. Of course, you will only get the music side of things. No personal or family details (only where he was born and the name of his parents and meeting Candice).

No kind words for Gillan here!! lol.

From the current line up of Deep Purple, Morse and Glover give interviews (but Morse is clearly no at easy).",1475280000,,380,4.492753623188406
7453237,5,B015X2I50Q,"Anytime you get Ritchie Blackmore to sit down and do a great interview(s) is a good thing - because he rarely does and shies away from that kind of thing. He does not play the political game for anyone. I found this DVD excellent overall. I think Ritchie could have let a few comments stay as water under the bridge. There was really no need to dredge up the bad vibes of the past, but that's just a small niggle. If you're a RB/DP/Rainbow/Blackmore's Night fan, then you can't go wrong getting this one.",1473811200,,504,4.372340425531915

the extended interviews are very interesting to watch for sure
anyway full 3 stars for this new blu-ray, well more musicians could've been interviewed,
Ian Paice, Roger Glover, Bruce payne & Colin Hart could've been interviewed

Great interviews, funny at times. Constant beering will make you thirsty so be prepared.
Sorry to say once they start interviewing the wife I lost interest. It was almost 2 hours long with pausing and beer breaks. A rock classic. Good Job.",1471910400,,514,4.988372093023256

7453248,5,B015X2I50Q,"Well done documentary on one of my favorite guitarists. I once worked for the Swiss band Krokus. And in 1982 we toured with Rainbow. I learned quickly that Ritchie wasn't very friendly, but it wasn't a concern. I didn't have to deal with him so it wasn't an issue. I do remember being at a truck stop early one morning somewhere in America where we'd stopped for fuel on our journey to the next town. Seems the Rainbow busses had also stopped for fuel. When I was returning to our tour bus I noticed Ritchie on a ladder used by the attendants to wash windshields. He had moved one close to the bunk area of our bus and had climbed up and was beating as hard as he could to wake up anyone sleeping on our bus. Needless to say, the Krokus guys were rudely awakened! He did have a good sense of humor!",1461801600,6,798,4.188311688311688

He Never Smiles, never seems happy even though he says that he is on the inside.. ironically his wife is so outgoing and engaging... (also gorgeous by the way.).l can't believe she's attracted to a guy who is such an opposite.. guess that's what Fame and money and creativity will get you...",1458432000,,481,4.2967032967032965

7453266,5,B015X2I50Q,"First, ...if you really like Blackmore, and are aware of his historically unique method of improvising electric lead guitar solos; then I say to you that you should not hesitate to get a hold of a copy of this documentary.  I have kept up with all Deep Purple related materials since 1970, and did not really think this film would have much material that I had not seen previously in a book, or on a DVD.  I figured it would probably have as much of Candice in it, as Ritchie himself.  I was wrong!

This is exactly what you want to see if you want to hear/see RITCHIE addressing everything from Mark ONE in the 60's, up to present day activity with a rather limited amount on Blackmore Night even mentioned at the end.  He does bring up the Lord Sutch / Gene Vincent / Jerry Lee period a bit, but not as much as the Purple/Rainbow periods.  No surprise there, but it is all new video, new interviews, new photos that you see.

Now, he does NOT go into in-depth discussion of his methodology of discerning Baroque Classical scales with reference to lead breaks, and solos.  A guitarist from Def Leopard does a short demonstration, but not Ritchie.  What Ritchie does give you is a closer image of who he is, what he is like, ...his personality through constant narration of images from his life.  He knows himself pretty good, I think.  He must be the Boss in any endeavor he pursues.  He gets the lion share of the income of his current project, which cannot possibly be as much as he made during the ""Renaissance Period"" of creative, progressive music in the 70's; but that music is not in vogue today.  You can turn on any radio station in your town, and not hear a Deep Purple song all day in 2016.  You could not do this in the 1970's.  ALL three was on the radio in the Seventies was pretty good progressive music from the bands that were highly respected then, and now by knowledgeable music fans.  Today, we live in the ""Dark Ages"" of popular music with literal noise being sold as music to many consumers, and with Baby Boomers largely preferring acoustic songs with pop vocals dominating the airwaves.  That's where the money is, and Ritchie has quite a few mouths to feed each month.

Of course, his acoustic music is FAR superior to what is played on radio stations in America today, but in this documentary; one is able to detect his appreciation for just how good his electric creations of the past were as well.  If the 2016 Rainbow shows do well, financially, I expect he will add some performances.  But, in this video, you get to actually hear him talk about the people/music/experiences of his life in about as much depth as you are ever going to hear him speak.  I watched it twice immediately

Be sure to watch the bonus ""Interviews.""  You get to see new video of many folks that you NEVER expected to see in this show.  I was so pleased to see about five of them comment at least one time during this documentary, and Interview section.  (Not Gillan, but everyone else!!)

Sorry to add this, ...but I really, really like Steve Morse, and love his work in Mark Eight!  But, Blackmore is definitely the best lead guitar player in captivity today.  In Hard, Melodic Rock - he is the BEST there ever has been.  His personality is that of an English gentleman with a warped sense of humor; and I like him much.

This video is not as long as the Tom Petty video.  It does not include as much music as the Jeff Lynne video, and it does not go into the extreme depth that the Eagles documentary; but ""The Blackmore Story"" is very, very good!  (I bought the documentary without the Rainbow concert.)

If you want an extremely good concert performance, I recommend ""The Black Masquerade"" from 1997.  Doogie White version of Rainbow was phenomenal!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Masquerade/dp/B00DPH7QFM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Masquerade</a>",1455753600,22,3913,4.6725146198830405
7453267,4,B015X2I50Q,"I watched this the other night and enjoyed it. I grew up a HUGE Deep Purple and Rainbow fan. No question the man is an absolute icon. One thing I did notice.....I assume this was made after Ronnie James Dio's death (i'm still heart broken!) and not only did Blackmore not have ANYTHING nice to say about RJD, but actually knocked him a little bit. I found that, on a personal level, to be tasteless.",1455062400,5,399,4.333333333333333
7453268,5,B015X2I50Q,"Finally,Ritchie gets the credit he deserves,and this DVD is a very enjoyable look at his life and career thru his eyes,as well as some of the Great talents of the 20th century! So nice to finally hear Ritchie's side of the story,and to hear the likes of Steve Vai,Joe Satriani,and Steve Morse tell how Ritchie's guitar playing inspired their playing thru the years. If your a fan of Deep Purple,Rainbow,or just a fan of Ritchie,this DVD is a must-have!!! Highly Recommended!!!",1454803200,11,476,4.888888888888889

Scenesters tells the real story of the late '80s Hollywood Rock scene proving that the Los Angeles music scene of the '80s wasn't designated only to the Sunset Strip which catered to the over-present glam ""hair"" metal movement. There was a huge alternative rock movement in LA long before the term ""alternative rock"" and grunge existed!

He even admits to being hard to get along with and being uptight as young as 5 years old. It's got video clips from all the stages of his career.
