8561168,5,B00B1YFOUK,"Id you are a fan of the series, you will find this movie to be (in my opinion) better than the original, now don't get me wrong A's the anime was great, but this movie manages to take the story and condense it to be a more personal story to Hayate herself, also manages to pull at your heart strings even more. I will not spoil the changes that make it better because I believe its worth the view, its a joy to the eyes how the updated animation and the movie budget shows in this.",1366502400,5,481,4.020833333333333
