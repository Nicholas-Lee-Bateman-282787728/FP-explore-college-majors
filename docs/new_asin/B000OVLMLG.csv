8187000,1,B000OVLMLG,"I like documentaries, but this one is a waste of time. The creators try very hard to make this a triumphant soul searching film but in the end Im not sure of the lessons anyone learns. Sure they meet interesting people along the way but definitely not enough to keep the movie going. They have money problems in the middle of their trip and are unsure they can go on, but I didn't feel sorry for them. I mean they weren't riding across America to raise money for cancer or to raise awareness about a social problem. They were riding for their own benefit; whether that be spiritual or making $$$ from the movie. In the end the movie is a road trip across America, with stops at McDonalds, uninspiring jabber between friends, and meeting local people in small towns. Sure, fun when you do it, but boring to watch a movie about it.",1229385600,,829,4.3896103896103895
8187001,1,B000OVLMLG,"This is a self-infatuated movie about three 22-year-olds who quit their jobs in a vaguely-defined ""corporate America"" to cross the country.  Most of the film is of them talking amongst themselves about how they're running out of money, and about the ""deep"" experiences they are having on the trip.  Along the way they visit plenty of interesting people, but since we don't see more than a minute or two of each, it's hard to get much out of the visits.  Additional footage features excitement such as a couple of Segway crashes (some staged), dogs chasing the Segway, and carrying the Segway over a barbed wire fence.  I have no doubt that the trip was eye-opening for the participants (who seem to have had no relevant life experiences or travel up to this point: never seen a cow before, I'd reckon), but it doesn't make a very interesting movie.",1199318400,9,848,4.70945945945946
8187002,5,B000OVLMLG,"An amazing and honest capture of the road from coast to coast.  As someone who has traversed the United States several times, I can tell you Josh and Hunter have nailed it.  The cinematography is breathtaking, and the story flows from city to city.  The interviews and quotes from the people, are interesting, and give you a real feel for America.",1180483200,3,347,4.655737704918033
8187003,5,B000OVLMLG,"I got to view this film at the Vail Film festival to a standing room only crowd.  If you are looking for something to make you feel good about America and at the same time examine your own desires for exploring something that you have always dreamed of doing this is the film for you.  The music keeps rapping in my head, ( its worth the watch just for the music), and the visual images captured on screen make this one flick you must add to you list of MUST sees.",1179964800,3,464,4.087912087912088
8187004,5,B000OVLMLG,"Fresh... inspiring... hopeful... funny.  This is a great documentary... the antithesis of Borat in that is shows you what MOST of America is REALLY all about - pursuing your dream, making connections, being happy.  I highly recommend this!!!",1179878400,5,241,5.315789473684211
8187005,5,B000OVLMLG,This is actually a really cool documentary.  It shows the diversity and strengths of our nation.  A compelling true story that is enjoyable to witness.  I highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys well made independent films.,1179878400,,227,5.081081081081081
8187006,5,B000OVLMLG,"10 MPH is great fun and heart-warming. If you're a city dweller, you deserve a taste of what the rest of the US is like. The only thing better than actually seeing this film is that you can't help being happy for the filmmakers that they got to put their vision, talents, and sense of adventure to such good use. They embody this line from Howard Thurman, ""Don't ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.""

One thing that really made me want to see 10 MPH was this comment by Sam Chaffos, Documentaries Programing Director for the 2006 Vail Film Festival: "" . . . the moving experience shown in your film transcends the screen and infects the audience in a way that I don't know can be properly expressed through words. Maybe it's just where I happen to be in my own life at the moment, but I doubt it. The deft editing and subtle power of the courage, friendship, humour, and adventure conveyed in 10 mph is unlike almost any documentary I've seen, and I thank you personally for exposing so much. It amounts to an unbelievably powerful piece of art.""",1179878400,8,1141,4.382075471698113
8187007,5,B000OVLMLG,"These guys have achieved something I think many of us dream about but rarely act upon. They gave up their run of the mill corporate jobs, risked serious debt, but with courage took a massive risk and it's paid off. I really admire their bravery. Their take on life whilst travelling across the USA is refreshingly eye opening. The people they meet along the way give a view of life that is rarely heard of - or at least over here in the UK! Very inspiring film that makes the viewer take a look at their own lives too.",1179792000,6,518,4.242424242424242
