8300557,5,B000CBG5RE,"Zelia and her crack band celebrate a yearlong alliance by recording one of their ""rehearsals"" at the Cultural Center in Rio.  Beautifully filmed and edited (except for some frontal shots of Zelia where the camera seems to shake), this DVD was recorded one years after the CD of the same name.  It's fascinating to hear how the songs evolved after a year of working together.  So many highlights, I can't even begin...but will simply mention that Zelia is in top form and wearing a beautiful dress!
Just check it out--you'll be glad you did!  Maravilhosa!!!

Beleza, Zelia!!!!!",1214352000,,576,4.896907216494846
