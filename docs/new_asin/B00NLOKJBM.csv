8678939,5,B00NLOKJBM,I like those old movies that have action without all the excess blood.  Today movies seem to need excessive violence because of poor writing.,1443916800,4,141,4.875
8678940,3,B00NLOKJBM,"There seems to some pretty good reviews for what I thought was just a hair above average calvary-Indian story.  Not a bad flick, but not a great one.  The cast seemed to either underact or overact their role.  The storyline was decent and moved right along, but I never got a feel for the movie.  Great music soundtrack though, it helped the film a lot.  When I comment on the acting I mean like Toni Gerry as Little Deer seemed more like a giddy schoolgirl than Indian maiden and Edward Platt's over the top jealous commanding officer Roland Dane.  The story, while familiar, was entertaining and John Ericson was good as the idealistic Lt. Niles Ord that everyone respected.  Storyline - Chief Black Eagle has been a thorn in the army's backside and raising trouble.  Lt. Ord believes he can bring in Black Eagle peacefully, but his new commanding officer wants him dealt with hard and that brings on the battles.  The new commander is also very jealous of anyone that looks at his wife (Lola Albright) that he sets out to ruin anyone that does--and he knows that she was seeing Lt. Ord before they married.  Sylvia Dane enjoys taunting her husband.  Lt. Ord rescued a young Indian girl who is hot after him.  He has problems from every direction.  Entertaining and well worth the watch for western fans.",1427587200,6,1306,4.626086956521739
8678941,4,B00NLOKJBM,"You feel in the mood for a cliche ridden old style western? Look no further. Here we have young Lieutenant John Ericson in conflict with his martinet CO Ed Platt, and having problems with said CO's wife Lola Albright. OK so far? Add great battle scenes with Cavalry and Indians, an Indian Maid in love with our hero Toni Gerry, a grizzled sergeant with a heart of almost gold, Walter Barnes, and some gorgeous location photography all on a beautiful Cinemascope transfer. Admittadly the colour wavers a bit but De Luxe often did in the cinema. There are hints of a heavenly choir too. So, have I made the situation clear? Nothing new but this is a well made western, no frills, but for the Western fan this works. Recomended. And please Warner ARchive give us the full treatment for ""DRAGOON WELLS MASSACRE"" now there is a heavenly choir to die for, so to speak.",1420156800,8,862,4.567741935483871
