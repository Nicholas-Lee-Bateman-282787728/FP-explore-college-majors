8674472,4,B00MT6VXMM,"Japan's remake of the Korean film Haunters, Monsterz stars Tatsuya Fujiwara as the nameless villain of the film; a man who, since childhood, has been able to completely control anyone he sees with just a stare.  So far he's only used his ""gift"" for petty theft, to get money to live on ... until one day, in a crowded park full of people all frozen still from his stare, he spots a guy unloading a moving truck who has not fallen under; the only person ever, it turns out, whom he can't control.  He becomes obsessed with Shuichi (Takayuki Yamada), who himself seems able to mystically heal super-fast from any injury he receives, and before long Shuichi is dodging various attempts on his life, realizing he's the only one who can take this man - now turned killer - down.  Monsterz has more character depth than Haunters, bonding the leads as abnormals in a ""normal"" world, but fares the same in terms of light comedy, a few great set pieces, and a tense confrontation in the end.  Intense stuff!  ***1/2 stars",1423267200,,1012,4.569060773480663
