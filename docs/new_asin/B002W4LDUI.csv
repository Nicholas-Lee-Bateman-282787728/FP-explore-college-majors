8688854,4,B002W4LDUI,"When we received this DVD, we were a little confused as most of the text on the packaging is in Spanish. However, we were pleased to see that we didn't receive the wrong item...it seems that the Spanish goes along with the style of the DVD. We were not too fond of the flashy parts between scenes/stunts, but the BMX content was very cool. Very cool stunts, and a few gnarly crashes. Definitely worth the price!",1329091200,,411,4.421052631578948
