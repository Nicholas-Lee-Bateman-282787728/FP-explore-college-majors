8073775,5,B000A36KA6,I use this and it's great for beginners. It is a bit slow so if you are not a beginner then I'd say get something else.,1354838400,,119,3.6153846153846154
8073776,2,B000A36KA6,"As all of the Pilates studios in my area require a large part of my rent to attend, I decided to venture out and buy a couple of Pilates DVDs instead.
More than Mart Pilates is an easy, gentle workout. The exercises don't really incorporate the benefits of the reformer, and while the instructor frequently emphasizes that the aim is repetitions, not exhaustion, you might find your mind wandering off and wishing for something a bit more challenging.
Having taken classes, I luckily knew of modifications to many of the exercises to make them more challenging. But, if your only access to Pilates is these DVDs, check out some (free) Pilates websites and use their modification tips. Or, simply purchase a more challenging DVD - this one fails to live up to the hype.",1336867200,,768,4.7388059701492535
8073777,2,B000A36KA6,"I've done mat pilates for at least 2 years.  This video is not really mat pilates.  This is also really slow and some of the moves I felt were easy for intermediate.  The only thing I remotely liked for me was the cardioflow part.  This video is not bad for someone starting out, but not for me.",1316563200,,295,4.12280701754386
8073778,5,B000A36KA6,I have all three of these DVDs. The work outs are challenging and the video is calming. Sarah Picot does a great job. I worked out with these DVDs for one week and the next week at work two colleagues commented I looked more tone and generally happier. I also sit up straighter... and my pants are tight anymore!,1246147200,,312,4.305084745762712
8073779,1,B000A36KA6,"I was looking for a more advanced pilates floor workout that I could do at home, when I bought this tape.  I've been doing pilates for several years and have  found it difficult to find more advanced at home tapes.  This was a bit of a disappointment.  It is reformer exercises done on the floor without the reformer.  It is like trying to row at home on the floor, without a rowing machine.  Pretty pointless, and you don't really get much of a workout.  I have done other pilates workouts that incorporate reformer exercises but these are done with a resistance band to simulate the reformer, which is much better.  This workout does not incorporate a resistance band.  I would not recommend this tape.",1219881600,3,704,4.612903225806452
8073780,5,B000A36KA6,"I have been doing Pilates for several years. Now, that I have small children ,I can't get to the studio as often as before. I really enjoy the DVD it is easy to follow and effective. It really makes working out at home achievable and I can really feel the results.",1161820800,3,264,4.196078431372549
8073781,5,B000A36KA6,"I have been training with a personal trainer on Pilates equipment for almost two years now (reformer, cadillac, chair etc.) and I'm always bummed when I have to miss a workout with her. Now I feel I have the perfect substitute! The 20 minute cardio-workout is a great time-saver too, especially when I'm travelling.",1132099200,4,315,4.851851851851852
8073782,5,B000A36KA6,"I don't usually write reviews but I feel compelled to spread the word; this workout is an excellent value.  I own many fitness and Pilates videos.  I have also used a Pilates Reformer with a personal trainer.  This DVD is the first workout I have seen that has someone actually perform the exercise on the reformer, then show the mat move.  The production quality is excellent and the cueing is right on target (and not in the least annoying).  If you have never tried Pilates mat work this DVD (or the beginner version) would be very helpful.  If you are already familiar with Pilates mat work, this would be an excellent addition to your library.",1129766400,8,648,4.591304347826087
8073783,5,B000A36KA6,"This is such a great workout! I love it!

I just started doing Pilates and absolutely love the Pilates for You videos. I started with the Beginner, and then moved to the Intermediate. Unlike others I've seen, Sarah Picot explains each of the steps very clearly - so, I'm able to follow along.

I've already started to see the difference - I'm getting in better shape! Thanks for such a great series!! I'm really enjoying them!!",1129507200,2,427,4.605263157894737
