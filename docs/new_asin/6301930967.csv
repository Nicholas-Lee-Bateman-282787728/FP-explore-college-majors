I first ""ran into"" Chris Elliott when he was a semi-regular on the David Letterman show years ago.  Every time he was on, he would just steal the show!  David L. is funny, but honestly Chris was soooo much funnier whenever he was on, he made Dave look bad in comparison.
Chris also was *the* perfect voice for Dogbert in the old Dilbert TV series.
The fact that he's been reduced to playing Raymond's brother's future brother-in-law on Everyone (Everybody?) Loves Raymond is a crime against humanity!
But I digress.  I'm supposed to be reviewing ""Action Family"" and ""FDR"".
I found this tape, used, at Blockbuster several years ago for $5.  Having never seen it, but absolutely LOVING Chris Elliott, I bought it and, boy, that was the best $5 I ever spent!  I can't tell you how many times I've watched my tape.  I now have a friend converting it to DVD for me so I can have this gem forever.  I can't believe it's out of print!  This tape deserves a much wider audience than it's been given.
The other reviewers here sum it up pretty well.  I especially love the person who said he laughed so hard he wanted to hurl.  Yeah, it really is that funny!
""Action Family"" is hysterical -- a combination of silly 70s family sitcoms and overly dramatic Quinn Martin-style 70s cop/detective shows.  The opening pays homage to The Brady Bunch, but the remainder of the sitcom portion of the half-hour is more slanted towards The Partridge Family, complete with a blonde mom named Shirley and an ending homage to The P. Family with Chris playing Keith Partridge that will have you grabbing your sides while tears run down your face.  It is brilliantly ""filmed"" in two media ... video for the indoor/family/comedy scenes and film for the outdoor/gritty/detective scenes.  The detective half of this flick is played so straight, so deadpan, that again you will find your face soaking wet and your sides in serious need of medical attention.  If you used to watch Mannix back in the day, you will really enjoy Chris's take on the detective genre!
As for the second half-hour of this tape, the ""FDR: One Man Show"" ... oh my gawd, I do not even know where to begin.  Words cannot describe how completely off the wall this is.  Chris plays the wheelchair-bound Franklin Delano Roosevelt with such kitsch (?) chutzpah (?) ... there's no English word for it, but I bet there's a perfect Yiddish word to describe this flick!  Let's just say that Chris Elliott doesn't let historical facts get in the way of his telling the story of FDR's life, and he's a genius at portraying a terrible actor.  Make no mistake, Chris Elliott is *not* a bad actor -- he is a great actor who can play a terrible actor like nobody's business.
It's a shame this is out of print, and that the used ones being sold on Amazon are going for over $40!  Yikes!  If you don't own this tape, please do yourself a favor and find some way to get your hands on it.  I promise you will not regret it!!!",1088467200,4,3056,4.508166969147005
7816951,4,6301930967,"I saw this ""program"" several years ago shortly after it had aired on Cinemax's ""Comedy Experiment.""  At the time it was made, Elliot was just an off-beat side kick of David Letterman.  ""Action Family"" was a 30-minute cross between a cheesy 70's style detective show ala ""Barnaby Jones"" and a sitcom complete with canned laughter.  All the interior segments of the show were done in the sitcom foremat while the exterior scenes were shot with bad film to give it the old detective show look.  The concluding scene brought all the characters together to watch Chris Elliot and his family perform a song in the vein of the Partridge Family.  Anyway, my brother had recorded ""Action Family"" and we must have watched the tape 10 times before it was lost.  It was one of the funniest things I had ever seen on television and the loss of the tape was truly a tragedy.  Now I come to find out that it was put out by the studio, but is no longer in print!  If anyone knows how to get a copy of this tape or wants to sell one, please let me know.  Perhaps the studio will re-release it???",976147200,,1078,4.376884422110553
