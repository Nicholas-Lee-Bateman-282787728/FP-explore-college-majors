2430212,5,B000BNV8NY,I generally purchase items by looking at other customers review.  I totally agree with this video.  I actually broke a sweat!  It's easy to do and fun at the same time.  Great product!  I look forward to purchasing other videos by Denise Austin,1140998400,8,244,4.5813953488372094
2430213,5,B000BNV8NY,This is a great workout if you are just starting to work out or if you just want something you can do indoors during inclement weather.  I love this DVD and it is easy to stick with it.,1140652800,6,185,3.8684210526315788
2430214,5,B000BNV8NY,"Denise Austin has never been my favorite, mostly because of her nonstop chatter. However, this is a great workout! I love walking workouts and have always been a Leslie Sansone fan, but I get a little bored with her same-step workouts. This workout is totally different.

There are three one-mile segments. The first is an Easy Walk which I really enjoyed. The second in a faster-paced cardio walk and the third is a walk and tone and she uses weights. This workout uses lots of different moves than any of the Leslie workouts and the time went by so fast it doesn't even feel like you are working out. You definitely will sweat, though.

I highly recommend this dvd for anyone wanting a nice walking workout.",1140393600,24,709,4.619047619047619
2430215,5,B000BNV8NY,"This is an excellent DVD! It is professionally done and very effective. I love the fact that you can customize your workouts. It truly offers something for everyone. Everything about this workout dvd is great. I won't go into detail about the three exercise segments and the stretching section as other people have done a great job of that but I got this DVD yesterday 2-14-06 I used it and I was so pleased that I had to write a positive reveiw. If you are unsure if you want to purchase this then please take a chance and get it, I doubt very seriously you will be disappointed!",1139961600,15,580,4.37962962962963
2430216,5,B000BNV8NY,"To put it bluntly, I hate working out. I've never had luck with workout dvds/videos in the past, and my workouts have consistented of mainly taking walks in my neighborhood. Other dvds I've found difficult to copy and follow, and unpleasant to do. But not this one!

I actually enjoyed this workout. I felt the ""burn"", and I can do this on a regular basis without getting bored or sick of it, because it's not unpleasant to do. That includes the walks and the stretching. It's very clear and easy to follow, so no frusteration there. This is one of the few workouts I've ever done where I actually felt good DURING the workout, not just after the workout!

Even the most die-hard workout and excersize haters, and even the most inexperienced beginners, can do this and stick with it. I highly recommend trying this to anyone who's failed with other workout videos in the past.",1138147200,33,876,4.608974358974359
2430217,5,B000BNV8NY,"This is my first walking DVD, I usually get my cardio from step, low impact aerobics or kickboxing but always kind of wanted a walking DVD.  This is an excellent choice.  Denise Austin and friends lead you through 3 one mile programs.  You can choose the easy walk, fat blasting interval walk or power walk and tone where light weights are used for basic toning moves for the arms, each program running 15 minutes long.  All three programs are simple but fun, there is no better exercise than walking!  Plus you don't just stand there and walk in place, you will walk up and back, to the sides of the room, and do other simple low impact moves such as step touches, knee lifts, etc.  The programs are short enough that you can do 2 or even all 3 at once if you want.  I usually do my strength training before my cardio and find these are great as add ons.

Denise does a good job here, she is pleasant and encouraging, she is still ""Denise"" but toned down a bit here.  If you are looking for a walking DVD, and there are lots out there I would definitely recommend this one.",1137801600,16,1074,4.2772277227722775
2430218,5,B000BNV8NY,"This was the first indoor walking video I've purchased, and I have to say I'm very impressed with intensity of the workout.  My first thought was ""oh, this will be easy"", and although the ""Easy Walk"" is pretty easy, the ""Fat Blasting Walk"" really makes me feel like I am getting a good workout in a pretty short amount of time.  I will definately be buying more of her DVD's!",1137283200,7,375,4.3428571428571425
2430219,5,B000BNV8NY,"Firstly, let me get this out of the way.  Denise is still Denise.  She is still bubbly and has not toned down her 'effervescent mannerisms', so if this is what bothers you most about Denise, then shoo.  Navigate away from this page right now.  Don't go looking at the Denise Austin workouts if you don't like her.  She is not going to go through a personality change for any of her workouts, and this one is not an exception.

Right, now that's cleared up, here's what you get on this DVD.

1. 15 min mile - Easy Walk
2. 15 min mile - Fat Blasting Interval Walk
3. 15 min mile - Power and Tone Walk
4. 10 min Stretch

EASY WALK - This is fantastic for those just starting out exercise, or for those who have injuries.  At the moment I am using this workout because I have very bad soreness in my lower body and cannot a high impact workout, but I am pleased to say that with a bit of effort on my part (in other words, responding when Denise says, ""Pump it out!""), I do get a thin film of sweat over my hands and some parts of my face.  Denise uses leg lifts and side steps to keep the workout interesting - it is not just marching in place for 15 minutes - she even does some tweaks to simulate uphill and downhill climbs.

FAT BLASTING INTERVAL WALK - This walk alternates short bursts of intesnity with regular walking segments.  She'll have you doing your regular marches, sidesteps, leg lifts, knee lifts and arm movements for a short while, and then she'll add a high(er) impact - burst of intensity.  In cases where the transition between the walking and intensity intervals is very large, one of the exercises performs a low impact modification which you can follow if you have week knees or are building your fitness level (or heck, even if you're just feeling a bit lazy one day).  There are no weights used in this routine, but if you want to increase the intensity, it might be a good idea to add ankle or hand weights if you like.

POWER AND TONE WALK - This is my favourite walk, as it uses hand weights to make the routine efficient and effective.  Of course you can choose not to use weights if it is difficult on your joints to do so, but for my liking it is the toning combined with the cardio that give this routine its own special flavour.

STRETCH - If you have the ""Shrink Your Female Fat Zones"" book, or are currently subscribed to Denise's ""Fit Forever"" online plan, you will recognise a lot of these stretches.  Denise takes you through stretches for the calves, hamstrings, the achilles, the hips, triceps, inner & outer thighs, quadriceps, and probably a few others in there that I can't remember at this moment.  While I do not believe that this stretches you out as thoroughly as the Standing Segment on ""Tamilee Webb's Total Body Stretch"", it does a good job of stretching the areas of the body that you worked during the walks.

The DVD is beautifully produced; filmed on set rather than on location.  The walk takes place in what looks to be a ceramic courtyard with archways looking out onto a red sandy desert (well, more like looking out onto a big picture of a red sandy desert).  The timing in the first workout is excellent, though in the second and third workouts it can get a bit off-beat here and there, but the advantage with walking over aerobics is that it doesn't really matter too much.

I have no excuse for exercise now, I can do these when I am injured and when I am pressed for time.  That, and when I hop back on the treadmill for a longer walk, or if I am going on an outdoor walk, I can use some of the toning arm movements that I have picked up from this workout to keep things interesting and boost heartrate and increase my calorie burning potential.

I would, however, be very interested in any feedback from someone who can compare this with  Leslie Sansone's 'Walk Away The Pounds' series.  I cannot compare this with any of Leslie's workouts simply because I have never done them - and I have achieved great results with Denise and find her very motivating, which influenced this purchase more than looking for a perfect indoor walk DVD.  Even then, I find myself incredibly pleased with this buy.

Cheers!",1136764800,97,4166,4.395045632333768
2430220,5,B000BNV8NY,"I prefer walking outdoors, but that's not always possible given northeastern Ohio weather. Several years ago, I bought an indoor walking workout VHS tape by Denise Austin, and used it so much it's now worn out in spots. So, I ordered her new 3-mile walking workout on DVD -- and I couldn't be happier. Each one-mile segment can be played on its own, or you can run all three plus a stretching segment. All are excellent; I get a great workout without having to get down on the floor, and just about every muscle in my body gets involved when the all the segments are completed. Agreed, Austin is almost too enthusiastic and bubbly, but she knows her stuff and really puts you through the paces. For the first time ever, I'm looking forward to doing my daily routine INSIDE the house (well, at least a couple of days each week).",1136678400,9,827,4.483443708609271
2430221,5,B000BNV8NY,"Circulation is what heals your body. ~Denise Austin

This walking program is divided into four sections. You can easily customize the walks so this works for anyone from beginner to advanced. If you want to take it easy and walk for 15 minutes, you can choose Easy Walk and then cool down with the 10-minute Stretch. For a super-energizing walk, play all four sections at once.

1. Easy Walk

Denise Austin has created three 1-mile programs to energize your body and clear the mind. The brisk pace and the addition of weights in the third segment guarantees a fat burning workout. By raising your arms above your head in the first Easy Walk, you increase the intensity.

The first section begins with walking in place. Then you work your way into walking back and forth, side to side and taking side steps. This section puts you on the fast track to lifting, toning and shaping your entire body.

2. Fat Blasting Interval Walk

This is a total body workout because in the second section Denise introduces you to interval training, which makes the walking even more fun.

3. Power Walk and Tone

This is perhaps the most fun I've had walking at home and the addition of weights in the third section makes this an especially effective aerobics routine.

4. Stretch

The creative stretching routine with a chair completes the workout and by this time your mood has been brightened and your mind is clear. I felt especially energetic and renewed after this amazingly fun workout. The spacious setting, customizable workout and fun routines makes this one of my favorite walking workouts.

This is an easier workout, very good for people like me who are recovering from an illness and have lost a lot of strength and stamina.  It allows you to gradually rebuild your strength and stamina.  Also, it is good for people with agoraphobia who want to walk, but find it difficult to go outside.  I fit this category, as well.  All in all I'm very happy with this video.  It also provides a nice alternative to stationary biking.",1488844800,,535,4.186274509803922

2430265,5,B000BNV8NY,I love this DVD. It is in 15 minute segments and the level is moderate.  One segment is weights and two are aerobics. I needed hip replacement surgery so I was able to sit and still do the weights segment. This is my second copy of this DVD. I wore out the first one. I have several Denise Austin DVD's and love all of them.  It is great for beginners and seniors like me (I'm 73) who want to do aerobics at a moderate rate.,1465516800,5,424,3.976470588235294

Though, I can't help but question, at times, if Ms. Austin and Leslie Sansone have similar educational backgrounds, as both of them do not seem to grasp what ""one more"" means.  Denise Austin does talk a bit more than I would like to fathom (thus the reason I could no longer tolerate Leslie Sansone workouts), but at least D.A. can move on to the next step while rambling on.  Overall, this workout is not difficult while resulting in a decent sweat (when you do all 3 programs together).  I like the combination of cardio with a little weight toning incorporated into it.  After enduring numerous L.S. yacking, uncoordinated workouts through the years, this D.A. workout is my pick most days of the week.",1436313600,,768,4.6940298507462686

She mixes up the moves more, and works in some strength training easily. This DVD is the new essential in my weight-loss workouts arsenal. I couldn't be more pleased with it. Denise makes it so easy and fun to get through three miles, sweating and smiling.

Note the tall girl on Denise's left - she seems to have a sour ""I can't believe this is supposed to be fun"" expression at times, haha.",1429315200,,515,4.364583333333333

You get a solid workout with weights (in the third mile section) one that will challenge you but is quite easy to do. I love its length, right around 45 mins which is perfect for me. I truly wish she would make another. Her queing is pretty good although there is one section where she is a bit off but the rest of the workout makes this forgiveable. Definitely worth a try.",1394668800,,454,4.290697674418604

2430333,4,B000BNV8NY,"If your a beginner, this is for you! I just recently started exercising again and this is working for me.",1392940800,,105,4.3
2430334,4,B000BNV8NY,"I enjoyed this walk - I was sweating - partly due to wearing my fabulous waist trimmer belt I've mentioned in earlier posts which I bought from Amazon.  Mostly because this is a fast walk.  Denise is very bubbly and energetic.  I find her tone very soothing which I enjoy - it doesn't annoy me (and I noticed my husband doesn't mock it when he hears it)  The first time I did this, I definitely noticed how much she doesn't give you a heads up on what's coming but if you do this a few times, you become familiar with her routine.  Like I always say, as long as you're moving - don't worry about it.  I noticed I was constantly joining in her next move on the ""second"" count, not the first one; once I saw what she was doing.  But that is ok.  I was still moving.  She will go directly from a kick back in to a side step or walk, but just keep doing the kick back until you are ready to join in.  I like the cool down at the end of each mile, she keeps you walking while stretching the upper body.

Another thing I noticed, Denise has a walk I've never seen done before but what dawned on me is that she is ready to burst out in to a dance - knowing that makes it fun.  The girl likes to dance and that is fun!!!  The colors of the outfits (which changed with each mile) were pleasant spring colors - I enjoyed these along with the background.  The stretch after the 3rd mile feels very good.  Now, when she goes in to her power walk - don't worry about if you aren't on the same foot - as long as you are doing it - you are still doing the same thing she is, just different foot - You know the walk forward, tap, walk back - hop and repeat ....well, I was constantly on a different foot - LOL But I went with it - No big deal.  If you find yourself not in sync with her - don't try to hurry and correct it - just go with what you are doing and join in when ready - No big deal  The moves are easy - it would be tough to get lost.

One of the moves I really like in the first mile, is when she does the knee ups - she has you raise your arms about chest level - finger tips touching and you try and touch your hands with your knee.  Man, I felt this in my quads and glutes!  I'm adding this to my Leslie routines!!

Side Step Tip:  Heads up on move that's coming:  When she does the side step - she will say ""side step"" which means step to the side 1 time.  When she wants to step to the side for a count of 2 moves - she will say ""side walk"".
  In the first mile - I do like the way she swings the arms around for these steps - it feels good.

I enjoy her bubbly energy - I really like what she did with the arms in this dvd.  If the weights are not something you want to do - just use your arm weight - as long as you are moving your arms or go with a 1 lb weight.  You are not really getting toned from the weights but you are getting your heart rate up.  Each mile is about 15 minutes.  I like Leslie Sansone walks also - the difference with these two ladies is Denise has more variety, especially for the arms and of course, is soft spoken.

This walk gets me ready for my day and makes me want to do something else

While I'm working out - I'm always sipping on my lemon/cucumber/mint drink.

Every morning I have been drinking 8 oz of Cranberry Water called Flush Fast from the book Fat Flush Plan and I've noticed it does keep me regular so:  More Energy!  WooHoo!!!",1389657600,,3374,3.888726207906296

2430349,3,B000BNV8NY,"I bought this video recently.  So far I've done the easy walk, and played through the others.  The Easy Walk is indeed easy, almost too much so. Its easier than all the Leslie Sansones I have even. I'm quite overweight and out of shape and never really broke a sweat, but its nice there are starting points like this that exist out there.  Having skimmed through the other tracks though I think it will still be okay, the other two walks seem to have much more to them and at a higher intensity. Also there is a custom feature where you can set which of the workouts you want to do which is a great feature.

Speaking of features I have a question about the dvd that is frustrating me (one reason I'm writing a review now rather than waiting a few more plays).  On the back of the dvd it says ""music only option"" yet I can not find how to set this. I've looked through all the tracks and the custom options, but I don't see how I can pick music only.  I am finding Denise's voice a bit grating and overly perky and I'll get far more use out of this if I can find how to set that option.  That's one of the reasons I bought it actually.  Anyone have any luck with this?

Edited - I've now done the second walk, power walk, and the intensity is just where I need it to be and its not a bad walk, but Denise's cueing is kind of fuzzy, and sometimes she's off beat or the people following her are doing something differently than she is (ie they just walk, she's swaying her hips in a salsa way).  And boy am I wishing that music only option worked.  Her voice is really irritating and fake sounding and she keeps repeating the same stuff over and over. ..you can do it..etc.

Edited - Tried to play it again, I really do like the work out but argh, her chattering voice drives me crazy. Finally put it on mute while listening to a podcast.  I'd love to buy more of her dvds but only if they have a music only option.",1364688000,2,1913,4.110215053763441

2430351,5,B000BNV8NY,This is an excellent exercise DVD.  Denise Austin starts out with an easy walk and advances to faster pace exercises.  She does an excellent job and I highly recommend this DVD,1363132800,,176,4.645161290322581
2430352,3,B000BNV8NY,I have several indoor walking videos and thought this would give me a little variety.  There is no clear instruction from one movement to the next and I find her phony enthusiasm distracting.  Leslie Sansone is by far the best in the indoor walking video market especially for those new to this form of exercise.

2430357,2,B000BNV8NY,"I should state two points to frame this review: I purchased this DVD more or less on impulse when I first began working out after a lengthy break and I am more familiar with the Walk Away the Pounds series, this was as a trial.

I must be honest, I am not so keen on this workout. Divided into three 15 minute segments each progressively harder than the previous  I found that I was never too challenged and it was difficult to follow the moves as they changed because Denise's pacing is off. I even tried to add heavier weights to the second workout but even that was too easy.

Unlike the extras in the WALP series the women working with Ms. Austin seemed devoid of personality (enthusiasm) and were also poorly paced at points.

This DVD would be an alright choice for someone who needs a very light workout or is just beginning but at this time I have taken it out my rotation.",1356652800,2,881,4.321212121212121

One of the great things about this workout is that everyone of the three workouts is LOW impact.  The first one is probably way too easy for all but beginners.  I like to combine the cardio walk with the power walk (which uses weights) and it does make me sweat.  I am a 42 year-old, intermediate exerciser and this workout offers a challenge if you do at least two segments in a row. Definitely worth the investment!",1330387200,,498,4.311827956989247

You can create a custom workout by adding segments that you want so you don't have to click the remote all the time. It's very neat concept. I like walking some days to give my body and feet a bit of rest after doing a more intense workout.

During that time, I realized that my workouts were probably too intense and that I needed to slow things down a bit.  Enter my old Denise Austin videos!  I had forgotten how much fun Denise's workouts are and they are very safe and effective for losing weight and getting fit.  I have to admit, after tackling some really intense workouts (TurboFire, Calorie Explosion), this workout seemed like a breath of fresh air, if not a bit silly for one at my advanced level.  But you know what?  It works.  I felt refreshed and energized after doing this and the entire workout is equivalent to a 3 mile walk.  That burns a significant amount of calories.  I am definitely going to switch up my workouts and incorporate some easier, more fun routines.  I'm so glad that I have rediscovered Denise Austin -- I know people complain about her perky attitude, But I love it.

Or just an easy walk and one fat blasting walk if I am shorter on time. Other than sweating you don't think you are doing much, but your muscles tell you other wise.

Caloric Burn: Unfortunately this dvd missed the mark for keeping your heart rate in the fat burning zone. I wear a bodybugg to measure my daily caloric burn and I mention this only so you know I'm basing this statement on scientific measurement rather than simply perceived exertion. I  not only measure exactly how many calories I burn just during a workout but also calories burned per minute during the workout. While this dvd offers a great alternative to rainy days for walkers, this walking dvd burned the lowest amount of any walking dvd I have (or most fitness dvds of any kind for that matter)...rather than burning MORE calories than when I walk outside like I typically do, I burned far lass. (it's VERY gentle in comparison to other fitness dvds) That doesn't mean you should skip it though...it is a gentle workout and sometimes that's needed in your workout rotations. If you have been doing strength training and are sore you can easily pull this one out and do something for yourself which is, afterall, better than nothing.  However, if you only want a small set of fitness dvds and are not a beginner, you may want to look to some alternatives (I will list a couple at the end of this review for you.)

Cueing: Excellent. You always know what to do and what's coming up.

Instructing: Denise leads the group and her background team is a nice variety of shapes to motivate all. They are smiling but aren't shouting out...a good team that follows along well.  The addition of others in the dvd adds visual interest and also makes everything easier to follow. Since they aren't all tiny and in shape it offers motivation that all can do this.

Set: Unfortunately this walking dvd, unlike most others, is set in an empty room. While that's the norm for fitness dvds, many other WALKING dvds I have utilize clips from canyon scenery etc so that those who are used to walking around scenery get an even BETTER view while being indoors and working out this way...and those who always do fitness dvds indoors get some views.<smile>

Energy: Very Very low...I have some other Denise Austin dvds that I like a lot but her whispery voice and energy level on this one seemed more like she was trying hypnosis to gently put you to sleep while working out...I kid, but it was close to it. I LOVE positive trainers (such as Bob on the Biggest Loser) so don't get me wrong...I don't go for a trainer yelling at me but want a postive workout...however, she seemed tired, delivered instruction in a wispery tone that we were shown how to use when I taught Kindergarten art class...she also seemed to need to fill each second with words. Now that may sound picky but let me explain...rather than counting or leaving some spaces of silence, she wanted to talk each second ( and I mean EVERY single second of the dvd) which is GREAT except she often couldn't come up with someting new to say so at these times she'd say ""great"" and ""that's it""  Problem was...she said these two phrases a million times a minute.  <grin>  So much so that, at some points, she actually said ""that's it. Great. Great. That's it. Great. You got it. That's it. Great. That's it.""  I know you think I'm kidding...but I""m not. If this were a fraternity game where you had to do a shot each time Denise said these two phrases you'd be drunk in the first 2 minutes. Nothing and I mean nothing gets on my nerves in life...but I have to admit, this did...so one thing now does. <giggle>

Overview: Unless you've never worked out before or have a physical need for a slow gentle workout, skip the first set altogether. You'll burn more calories dancing or walking around the house cleaning. Very slow and too few upper body moves to get your heart rate up to a fat burning zone equal a VERY gentle workout that did little to keep my attension...I'll admit, I love walking dvds but this first set bored me enough that I nearly gave up on the dvd...HOWEVER, the second and third set are better. While they still won't ""blast away fat"" by any means as the title dictates since you aren't burning many calories, they are more interesting and I think it's a GREAT idea in the third set to also do toning. So it's for sure a ""keeper"" for that reason.

Alternatives: Kathy Smith's Matrix Method Power Walk is a great calorie burner and offers great flips from canyon shots to indoor views but the moves keep it so interesting. It's one of the best and you will burn some fat with that one. If you hate Kathy Smith don't shy away from it...I have given other Kathy Smith dvds one star for bad cueing and lots of yelling out but this one hit a bullseye in offering 5 stars on quality and cueing as well as a great workout. Also try Leslie Sansone's 3 mile Weight Loss Walk. She is a great instructor with great energy and this one also offers higher caloric burn than you'll get walking outside, unlike what I found in my Denise Austin comparison vs. outside walks.

Conclusion: A great walking dvd will burn MORE calories than outside walking because, even though you lose the incline of streets or paths, you gain upper body movements and fast moves and create interest as well. While this didn't meet that objective for me, it's still a dvd I will keep for gentle workout days. Don't expect high calorie burning or ""fat blasting"" as advertised since the calorie measurement was low, but the walking with toning is a great offering in addition to a gentle workout if you are sore.  However, if you don't ever need a gentle workout or are not a beginner, you might try the alternative dvds listed above in my humble opinion for better results and more excitement.

If you are a beginner? This is probably a pefect way to start gently!",1255996800,8,6041,4.537683823529412

Her footwork was always ""off"" compaired to the other ladies exercising.  Also, it seemed as though she was making up the mooves as she went along. I had a little trouble following her the first few time because there were several time during the workout that she didn't tell you what was coming next.  She could have done with a lot less ""That's it, Good"".  Must have said that a hundred times.",1232755200,,565,4.394230769230769

The first one is easiest, the second has some intervals where it's more challenging and the third has some weights. A real beginner could do the first mile and progress through the second and third miles over time.

However, this is my first experience with Denise Austin, and I found her to be very condescending and annoying. I thought she was not genuine at all and talked to me like I was 5 and in pre-school. I don't know if she is always like this but she just isn't my style.  Also I found it a bit too easy of a workout, and I thought it was poorly cued, as well. I think I could get used to seeing the next move coming, and the moves themselves aren't complex or difficult, but she doesn't give you a lot of instruction in what's coming next or how to do it.

2430392,2,B000BNV8NY,"Denise Austin's Blasting Away the Pounds is basically a low impact exercise video with a focus on walking, with some weights thrown in for good measure towards the end. It's broken down into three 15 minute segments, with an additional segment dedicated to stretching exercises.

All in all, the actual production values were very nice. The music couldn't have been more pleasant, the dancers more upbeat, or the backdrop prettier. However, I just couldn't get past the host. I've seen my share of robotic-but-perky hosts but this chick has them all beat. Ever-smiling, throwing out pep talks in her husky voice, and bouncing around like an Energizer Bunny, it's like she had a smile surgically implanted onto her face and had the ""perky switch"" set to ""Extra High"".

And what she says to motivate viewers couldn't be odder. ""You're burning burning butter! You're burning butter!"" Burning butter? When another Amazon reviewer said she couldn't get through the workout because she couldn't keep from laughing, I knew exactly what she was talking about. This is just the goofiest host I've ever seen! I was almost on the floor five minutes into the video-- not from exhaustion but from hysterics. Needless to say, I don't think this was this exercise video's intended effect!

As for the routines themselves, it's a mixed bag. The first 15 minute routine (Easy Walk) is okay, but just a little too boring and repetitive. (It's just marching back and forth, side-stepping, and raising and lowering arms). The 2nd routine (Fat Blasting Interval Walk) is much better, but there's this one move in it--the Power Walk-- that feels off tempo, poorly matched to the music, and therefore hard to follow or ""feel"". The last routine (Power Walk and Tone) is the best of all three and combines more intense footwork with upper body work using weights. Unfortunately, once you eventually get to it, it's a case of ""too little, too late."" This one segment may be good, but with so many other flaws in the rest of the video, you may wonder whether purchasing it outright is well worth it.

I personally don't think it is. However, if you insist on checking it out then I suggest that you try (rent) before you buy. Who knows-- you may find the host's quirks oddly charming and one or more of the segments useful enough to use on a consistent basis (especially the Fat Blasting Interval Walk and stretching segment).

people who want to walk their way to toned muscles, or weight loss.
There are several routines to pick from, this DVD starts with a basic exercise routine that anyone can follow, to a medium routine, to a more
intense routine using small hand weights. Each routine also incorporates arm exercises & deep breathing, so it's a pretty well rounded program.
 Each routine equals one mile, so you can keep track of how far you ""walk"".  This program doesn't take up a lot of space, you can do it in your living room or family room, it's more stepping/walking in place, and if you do a couple of the routines, you get a pretty good workout.  Denise Austin is really good at describing how & why you do each exercise, and what muscles are affected and the benefits of doing them.  Each routine is about 15 min. long, so you can figure how long you want to exercise.  This is a really good program for beginners or anyone who wants to walk, even when it's impossible to walk outdoors.",1203033600,3,1041,4.457894736842105

If it's walking you want, I'd buy the DVD ""Get Moving"" with Chris Freytag of Prevention magazine.",1168992000,12,398,4.5

If your gonna buy a denise austin dvd get the ""personal training system"". On that dvd the workout are worth doing and really help you burn calories and fat . I have that one and most of the time do the workout with the sound off.  LOL",1167868800,8,390,3.8625

It says its 3 complete 1 mile workouts. But Denise indoor walk is divided up into 3 separate workouts, so it stops after each one. I feel like I'm just doing 3 short sessions and not really maintaining any intensity. I much prefer her daily shows on the lifetime channel and for a longer challenge...Leslie Sansone's 4 mile super challenge. I had read the poor reviews on this dvd but being a big fan I thought I'd give it a try...but unfortunately its just too easy.",1157932800,7,643,4.193548387096774
2430434,4,B000BNV8NY,"At first I was somewhat surprised at how ""easy"" this DVD seemed. I'm an intermediate exerciser and so I expected a little bit of a challenge. However, the longer I've had it the happier I've become that I got it because it has certainly come in handy on days that I'm not up for a more challenging workout. I think even the most advanced exercisers can appreciate the relaxed, fun nature of this DVD,and we can all use a good indoor walk video. The best part about this DVD is that you can do as little as 15 minutes or as long as 45, and you can always pick up the pace if you want more of a challenge. It's hard to find an excuse not to at least squeeze in 15 minutes to walk a mile, even on busy days. This DVD takes away the excuses!",1155772800,17,737,4.020408163265306
2430435,5,B000BNV8NY,"While there are three complete 1 mile programs on this DVD, I prefer the EASY WALK session. It has a lot of arm movements which really helps those of us who make our living sitting infront of a computer, with minimal arm movements.

The EASY WALK session is easy to follow, but until you've done it three or four times, you may find yourself a little mixed up. Now, I can follow along with my eyes closed, not that I do mind you.

What I like to do is do four of the EASY WALK sessions back to back, that allows me to get in a four mile walk and break a sweat.

The FAT BLASTING INTERVAL is okay, but it reminds me of an aerobic work out, not a walking work out.

As for stretching and warming up, there's a ten minute stretching routine you can do before or after any work out.

Update: I recently incorporated the the third session. It uses hand weights and I've found that it really helps me increase the intensity. In fact, my 70 year old mother-in-law did this series during a recent visit and she now wants a copy of the DVD.",1154563200,13,1031,4.135

2430437,2,B000BNV8NY,"I think Denise Austin does a decent job in some of her other videos, but this isn't one of them.  She lacks any type of warm up in this one and often looks like she's just trying to make up steps in order to fill the time slot.  The moves are not well choreographed and very awkward.  Some may find encouragement in the times Denise gives the camera a bug eyed stare and says ""We're burning butter.... yeah"" but I found it annoying.  I think there are much better workouts for the money out there.",1153180800,13,497,4.2

I have tried several cardio tapes of Denise's but I just can't seem to keep up and I get discouraged and end up quitting.  I enjoy walking so when I seen this tape I thought I would give it a try.  So far so good!  Another good thing about the video is you can customize your workouts. I would recommend this tape as great way to start you on the fitness track!,1151884800,8,455,4.195402298850575
2430440,5,B000BNV8NY,"I love Denise Austin videos.  I have tried others and never been as happy with the workouts.  For some reason, Denise Austin can keep things entertaining and motivating time and time again.  I am very out-of-shape, and just started using the ""Easy Walk"" and stretch portions of this DVD two days ago.  After the first day, I could really feel it in my arms, since it also works your upper body during the walks.  The DVD is also versatile, allowing you to mix & match workouts to completely customize the type and amount of exercise that fits your needs and schedule.  Because of this, I think it is something that will be useful and not get boring for a really long time.",1149638400,9,672,4.467213114754099

The workouts get the heart pumping without strain or shortness of breath. This DVD is wonderful.  Also it is terrific for walking indoors when walking outdoors isn't possible.

Denise Austin is encouraging and pleasant.  I find her workouts and I have done many (Fat burning Yoga, Yoga Buns, Pilates, Kickboxing Etc) stimulating and encouraging.  The only criticism I have is that she doesn't include women or men in the videos who are ""weight challenged""  All those shone with her are very fit, slim people.",1148774400,6,633,4.869158878504673

Also, this dvd requires much more space than I have, though I've always had plenty of room to do a Leslie Sansone workout (Leslie has excellent cueing and is easy to follow).  I don't think I have gotten a good workout once when doing this dvd, mainly as I spend much of the workout trying to follow along.  Denise does use some arm movements that were new to me, which I am happy to incorporate in to my workouts for variety's sake.  All in all, very disappointed after doing Leslie Sansone workouts for 2 years.",1147305600,16,609,4.45945945945946
2430443,2,B000BNV8NY,"Okay, so this was my first Denise Austin experience, but does she really sound like this all the time?

I had a hard time staying on cue the first easy walk segment because I was laughing so hard.

Denise does better on the high impact stuff.  The workout itself was good, but we just couldnt' past her personality.  I guess she was at least better than the ""Crunch"" Pilates workout squad and their beloved ""elegant arms"".",1146873600,9,422,4.5131578947368425
2430444,3,B000BNV8NY,"This is a reasonably good and gentle workout for someone who is a beginner to exercise or otherwise out of shape, as an occasional change of pace for someone who normally does other forms of exercise, or for someone who likes to walk a lot but is sometimes stuck inside on bad weather days.

For those who are very much out of shape, many of the movements can be omitted or done with less intensity to keep the routines within your fitness level.

A few annoyances:

I find her voice and manner of speaking unpleasant. But not so bad if you get used to the DVD enough that you can follow along with the sound turned down.

The routines seem to flow poorly. I think that's mainly because there's no set number of times that each movement is made before moving on to the next one. You might make one movement twice before moving on, another one 4 times, and other one 8 or 10 times. That makes it difficult to get comfortable enough with the routines to be able to follow along without always staring at the screen 100% of the time to find out where you are, and guarantees that you will occasionally be suddenly trying to catch up or shift *here* when you were expecting to still be *there*.

Also, certain of the movements that follow each other don't have a good transition between them and it's not immediately obvious how to make a smooth shift between the movements.

I also dislike her insistence that doing things like occasionally moving your arms up and down slowly (with no weights or other resistance) will ""tone"" anything. It won't. Helps to burn a few more calories I guess, but does nothing for improving muscle tone at all.

As to the DVD presentation, as opposed to the content, I haven't figured out yet if there's a way to start from the beginning yet skip the safety warning and the quick ""Denise spiel"" at the beginning. Doesn't seem to be a way, as fast forward is disabled during these segments. That's kind of annoying.

Overall though, a useful addition to your workout library unless you are already advanced. Even for non-beginners, there are plenty of ways (not specified or shown on the DVD) to increase the intensity a bit to make it more challenging. I've never seen any other ""walking"" exercise DVD's, so I don't know how this compares to others.",1145491200,17,2276,4.534146341463415
2430445,5,B000BNV8NY,"This is my favorite Denise DVD.  I wish she would make other indoor walk DVDs as well.  This is the type of workout that you can do everyday because walking can be done everyday.  I like to alternate using this DVD with my treadmill and walking outside as well.

There are three different workouts to this DVD.  The first one is very basic and Denise really takes the time to alert you of what's going on, moreso than she does in some of her other DVDs.  But even with it being basic, anyone at any fitness level I hope would enjoy it.  The second one involves small bursts of energy and the third involves light weights.  Each walk is equivalent to one mile and is 15 minutes long.

There is also a ten minute stretch component.  I love the stretch component!  All you'll need is a chair.  Sometimes I'll even do one of Denise's other DVDs but do this stretch component because I really like it and I hope you will too.  I rate this DVD a perfect 5 stars.",1144886400,14,956,4.2444444444444445

The second segment is the interval training with steps that get a little confusing if you have two left feet as I do, but it still is a pretty good workout. I love the third segment with light weights and walking. Anyone can do this workout and break a sweat. Yes, Denise Austin talks a lot, but if you have children you know how to tune annoying voices out. I also liked that she had women of all shapes in the video.

I thought I was in good enough shape that getting sore was out of the question.  I will definitely include this workout as part of my weekly routine.

It is especially good for someone who may have a problem with stress on their joints - it is a lot more comfortable walking in your home than on hard and/or uneven surfaces outside.
