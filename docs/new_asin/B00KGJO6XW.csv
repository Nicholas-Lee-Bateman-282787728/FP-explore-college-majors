6425604,2,B00KGJO6XW,"You know you're in for a bad movie when in the opening scene you see the leg of a crew member in the shot. A divorced father takes his son hunting and they run into a bunch of sasquatches. There is a native element (the tribes medicine man made a deal so the bipedals don't kill tribal members) to the movie.

The are some pros - decent cinematography, Zach Galligan (far removed from his ""Gremlins"" days) and it's only 80 minutes long.

The cons - Bad acting, inconsistent story lines, jumbled script, lame effects (someone needed to take away the fog machine), continuity. The DVD ""menu"" (only the option to play the movie) is one of the worst I've seen. I have poor quality bootlegs that are better. The movie seemed to have started on a serious tone and then got incredibly jokey/hokey. Apparently bigfoot knows to get inside a police car to honk the horn & turn on the siren (in this scene the sheriff tells, he thinks the person in the car is the dimwitted deputy, to ""settle down"" while the hood is open. Problem is he says this prior to a car horn and siren to make him say ""Settle down."" I guess it was too much trouble to fix it in post, or do it correctly in post.

You know it's going to be bad when the hammy head of Troma, Lloyd Kaufman, didn't want to be in the credits.",1461456000,,1285,4.258196721311475

6425611,1,B00KGJO6XW,"If Edward D. Wood, Jr. were alive today, this would have been his worst movie. There are a lot of good drama movies featuring Bigfoot, many of which I have reviewed here on Amazon. This is not one of them. In fact, this movie is painful for any reasonably intelligent person to sit through. I am convinced that the dumb-as-a-stick deputy in the movie was also the author of the screenplay. I am astonished that anyone reviewed this film positively. Even the basic premise of the relationship between the Native American tribe and the ""nightbeasts"" (aka, Bigfoots) is flawed. And frankly, the unfortunate trend for low budget film makers to substitute Bigfoot as the 21st century's Freddy Kreuger is disgusting. So the only way to survive this movie is to first turn it off, second put your finger down your throat and barf to make an appropriate statement of its artistic value, and then thirdly, throw the DVD in the trash and go order a worthwhile Bigfoot movie like ""Exists"" from Amazon.",1442966400,,990,4.761627906976744

6425623,5,B00KGJO6XW,"I always seem to find myself thoroughly bored with the most awful Sasquatch movies and other horror films out these days. I remember when summer blockbusters were actually good entertainment but I guess those days are long gone. Have you also been lied to by Hollywood about ""exciting"" and ""frightening"" horror movies that fall flat after you have forked over your hard earned money and given 2 hours of your life you'll never get back? You should pull up a chair and grab a bag of chips to watch Nightbeasts. You will not be disappointed! I enjoyed this movie, from beginning to end, with the deceptively quiet start that displays good storytelling to the very gory end with an all out man vs. beast war. I was deeply impressed by the positive light cast on the Native American characters and the mysticism of the storyline. I do wish the ending could've been a bit longer because I feel that there was a little more story to be told but, otherwise fantastic job!",1438300800,5,964,4.6104651162790695

6425630,2,B00KGJO6XW,"Wow, was that awful! I just didn't see what the good reviews were about. The acting was terrible, it relied too heavily on old cliched jump-out scares, stereotypical characters (the redneck back-woods deputy, the angry sheriff, etc.), thin and unlikeable characters, and really bad dialogue. The plot was also really convoluted and contradicted itself: the sasquatches were supposed to be sensitive to sunlight, yet there are a couple seen stalking around in daylight....  I did like the monsters costumes, and they were a little different than your run-of-the-mill bigfoot suits you usually see (although they sounded sort of like pigs snorting for some reason!). Also the background mythology about the monsters was nice. For those couple reasons I give this one two stars instead of one. Unless you are a die-hard bigfoot film fan I wouldn't bother with this one.",1421539200,2,866,5.185714285714286

6425644,4,B00KGJO6XW,"Campy and oddball, this is a film fashioned in the style of 80's campiness with flickering background lighting, way better music, and with the help interesting characters to round out the overall quirkiness of the story: a deputy who reminds you of Forrest Gump, a sassy ex-wife with a mean streak, who, for several minutes in the film, you wish she'd get her slender ankles bitten by one of the  Nightbeasts.

The movie reminds me of 80's monster movies, sure it's campy and bloody, that's why I loved it! Zachary Galligan is great too, of course he was great in Gremlins and Psychic, and he was solid in this one too.
I really like the look of the ""Nightbeasts"" or Sasquatch/Bigfoot creepers. I would love to see a sequel to this one too. Give it a go, if you like 80's monster horror flicks with great action and one liners with a classic story, pick it up!",1415923200,6,571,4.153153153153153
6425649,5,B00KGJO6XW,"First, this is an independent movie. I feel it's important to say that because it was not made with a 100 million dollar budget like most Hollywood blockbusters. It did not come from Universal, Warner Bros or 20th Century Fox. Usually, independent films are populated with no name horrible actors. They are usually filmed like somebody's crappy home movie on a video camcorder. And they usually consist of several 20 something actors contemplating the meaning of existence and they're usually BORING with a capital B.

None of that is the case here. It appears SOME money has been spent on this film, at least more than the usual indie movie. The star is veteran horror actor Zach Galligan who gives a rock solid performance as Charles Thomas in the movie and really anchors the film dramatically. Zach is really good in the movie. Other roles are fleshed out by Apesanahquat (who was in Northern Exposure and Bagdad Cafe) and Audra Wise (Nip Tuck) Both actors are really good in their roles.

The movie looks and sounds amazing. (Be sure to pay attention to the lighting effects.) The Cinematography is on a par with what you see in big budget Hollywood movies and even has the widescreen CinemaScope look of a true blockbuster. The pacing of the film moves and the creature effects are totally believable. It is a great story and the only one to include Native Americans as part of the Bigfoot mythology. It is also suspenseful and scary in places but does not forget to have a little humor here and there as well. I absolutely love this movie. It is an independent film miracle that I would recommend to everyone that likes Bigfoot and films about Bigfoot. Nightbeasts is quite the accomplishment for an indie movie.",1415664000,20,1719,4.745819397993311

8658471,2,B00KGJO6XW,"NOTE: The producer made this film available to me and asked me to write a review.
It is very low-budget, but I don't feel that is an excuse.  I've been the festival director for 2 film festivals for the last ten years. A lot of low and no-budget films have crossed my path and many are incredibly well made.

There is an earnest nature to this film that helps move it forward but the missteps are many.  The acting is rough. Zach Galligan is good but the supporting cast is inconsistent. The camera use is erratic, at times it is amazing and other shots are hard to understand.  Some reviews watched it as a comedy, and it has some good humor moments, but it did not feel like the movie was made to be a full comedy.

All the above being said, it looks like this is a first-time filmmaker and I would like to see more from them.  Wes Sullivan has a good grasp of story-telling and could benefit from the knowledge gained making this film.

If you are a bigfoot Sasquatch completist you'll probably want this in your collection.",1478217600,,1027,4.345549738219895

This is certain to be classic in the horror realm, and a horror writer, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Now, when you watch this, keep in mind this isn't a Wes Craven film, it doesn't have millions of dollars behind it. It is an Indie film, and that is what I loved so much about it. The story-line is impressive, not the run of the mill rip off that is going around right now in Hollywood, where they can't seem to come up with an original idea to save their lives. I enjoyed it. I think many others will too!",1475366400,,626,4.097560975609756
8658473,4,B00KGJO6XW,"Treehouse Pictures offered me the opportunity to screen this film and I had a fun time watching it. The creatures were pretty cool and it had a decent story. The only critiquing I could come up with would be, retakes of some of the lines, but I realize budget is always an issue. Otherwise, I liked the film.",1474675200,,308,4.327586206896552
8658474,2,B00KGJO6XW,"NOTE: The producer graciously made this film available to me and asked me to write a review.

I enjoy independent movies, and I can appreciate the problems that independent filmmakers have in working with miniscule budgets. Still, as films like ""El Mariachi"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" show, you can make good movies for very little money. ""Nightbeasts,"" like the aforementioned films, was clearly made on a shoestring budget, but the difference between them is like night and day. ""Nightbeasts"" is a horror film with an interesting story concept, some humor, both intentional and otherwise, but sadly little else going for it.

""Nightbeasts"" stars Zach Galligan, who received top billing in the two ""Gremlins"" movies but has done little since. Galligan plays Charlie Thomas, a down-on-his-luck divorced father trying to bond with his pre-teen son on a weekend hunting trip in the Pacific mountains. Unknown to them, a group of Bigfeet are on the loose, terrorizing local residents, campers, and tourists. It seems the Bigfeet made a bargain with the local Indian tribe years earlier to let the Indians alone and instead go after everyone else in the vicinity. Charlie and son Tim, along with a handful of other survivors, try to take on the creatures.

Although Nightbeasts is billed as a horror film, its not in the least bit scary. Its also not exciting, suspenseful, or dramatic. For creature movie monsters, the nightbeasts themselves are almost laughably bad. The Bigfeet walk, run, and move just like regular people, and they look exactly like what they are, a group of stuntmen wearing gorilla suits that have been painted white. They are usually shot from a distance to try to conceal the shortcomings of the costuming, with an occasional prosthetic headshot thrown in (the close-ups of the snarling heads are actually decent).

The film was written, directed, and produced by Wes Sullivan, who has to get most of the blame for the overall amateurish production. While I understand the lack of an effects and stunt budget, the net result is that the action scenes are completely mishandled and sometimes impossible to follow. Theres a lot of hand-to-hand combat between people and Bigfeet, most of which occurs off camera, while there are at least a half dozen instances of people shooting at the edge of the screen, followed by a cut to a shot of a dead Bigfoot or two on the ground. Even the jump scares, staples of low budget horror films, are mishandled. In one scene, viewers clearly see a cat walking in from the edge of the screen, followed by a musical cue as the cat jumps into a persons lap. And, needless to say, the small budget means theres very little blood or gore here.

While the technical work in Nightbeasts is bad, the acting is no better. Galligan is competent, as are a couple of the other cast members, but numerous roles are played by people who seem to have no acting experience whatsoever. Even a casting call at a local community theater should have produced better quality performers. Wooden line readings and overwrought emotions abound. Further, the directing of some of the scenes seems totally misplaced, with actors displaying emotions completely inappropriate for the scene.

The only partially saving grace in Nightbeasts is its sense of humor. There are a few good jokes (when asked to name his favorite comedian, one character replies Richard Nixon). Its hard to say whether the film is intentionally funny or not in some scenes or merely a case of so-bad-its-good, but I did laugh a few times. The funniest character by far is an exceedingly inept deputy named Clarence (played by an actor with no other film credits), who resembles Gomer Pyles much dumber brother.

Although Ive reviewed a number of books and other products on request on Amazon, Nightbeasts is the first film Ive been asked to review. I appreciate the honor, and I appreciate the effort that went into this movie, even to the extent of procuring the presence of noted shlock entrepreneur Lloyd Kaufman to play a bit part. However, the movie simply lacks professional level competence in many areas. Those who enjoy laughingly bad horror will find some things amusing here, but others will probably want to see some other beasts instead.",1474329600,,4255,4.934357541899441
8658475,4,B00KGJO6XW,"As a Bigfoot enthusiast, I lean more toward documentaries and factual sightings and encounters. I was offered an opportunity to review a free digital copy in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. At first, I declined since I'm not a blood or gore horror fan, but I was told this was more of a thriller type film. I do agree. This is a fun little film with suspense instead of the usual blood and gore, which I did appreciate. Zach Galligan was fine as the lead and there was a lot of campy fun. I did like the Native American plot points (the rap at the Pow Wow was fun) with authentic casting. Production values were quite good for a low budget movie. Nice cinematography, mood lighting, fog and great locations. While it wasn't scary for me (my all time favorite is still ""The Legend of Boggy Creek""), it was enjoyable and the bad guy got what he deserved. Really like the fact that story was emphasized more than shock value.",1471219200,,934,4.436046511627907
