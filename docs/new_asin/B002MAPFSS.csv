8373780,5,B002MAPFSS,"This is a review of the film, not the quality of the recording (which is very poor).
Whilst I would not describe this film as a comedy, it is a fun film with some great throw away lines and finely judged performances from the actors involved.",1499558400,,242,4.282608695652174
8373781,1,B002MAPFSS,"I had purchased this movie based on my wife's childhood memory of having watched it with her father and enjoying it. The transfer to DVD is the worst I have ever seen from beginning to end. There is a mildly interesting storyline ""banker saves town from outlaws"" but the town itself looks like the town from Blazing Saddles i.e. cardboard cutout  buildings, with the major difference that it was supposed to be funny in Blazing Saddles. There are also so few people in the town it is amazing that Richard Crenna's banker would bother trying to save it.",1401408000,,552,4.63265306122449
8373782,4,B002MAPFSS,"Sometimes, a film's title can lead to expectations that it will be something that it isn't.  SHOOTOUT IN A ONE-DOG TOWN, a made-for-TV Western that first aired in January 1974, is just such a film.  Given the title that it has, and that it is directed by genre favorite Burt Kennedy, whose films SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL SHERIFF and SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL GUNFIGHTER are arguably the best examples of comic ribbing of the sagebrush genre, one would expect this film to be likewise: a comedy western.  But it really isn't anything of the sort.

In this film, Richard Crenna plays the role of a banker in a small, sun-baked Southwestern town who has been tasked to guard a $200,000 deposit after the courier (Michael Ansara) who had been carrying it has been shot.  The townsfolk, however, aren't particularly comfortable in the notion of having all this money being stored around, especially given that the gang of robbers (led by Richard Egan) that were responsible for Ansara's murder is approaching to claim that money.  Crenna thus is forced to act alone to save both the money and the town from what could very well turn out to be a massacre.

Despite its being a TV movie shot on a fairly modest budget, SHOOTOUT IN A ONE-DOG TOWN is quite well directed by Kennedy, with its principal influence being the 1952 Western classic HIGH NOON, by placing Crenna in the Gary Cooper role, and Stefanie Powers (as his wife) in the Grace Kelly role.  There are also modest references (with less violence) to ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, THE WILD BUNCH, and LAWMAN in the film's screenplay, written by Dick Nelson and Larry Cohen (the latter of whom also wrote the script to Kennedy's 1966 film RETURN OF THE SEVEN, and later wrote and directed the 1974 horror classic IT'S ALIVE).  The handsome cinematography by Robert Hauser (A MAN CALLED HORSE; SOLDIER BLUE) was done on location in one of the many Western towns framing Durango, Mexico; and the film boasts prominent appearances by such memorable Western genre actors as Michael Anderson Jr., Gene Evans, Jack Elam, and Dub Taylor.

I agree with the one reviewer here that the quality on this DVD isn't all that good, which is why this film could use as professional a restoration as has gone into a lot of other films.  But just in terms of the quality and the story of the film itself, SHOOTOUT IN A ONE-DOG TOWN should be seen as one of those rarities: a very good small-screen sagebrush saga.",1393286400,,2435,4.652680652680653
8373783,2,B002MAPFSS,"Enjoyed the movie, a favorite in the past; however the quality was quite poor.  It was grainy and too dark.",1372204800,,107,4.35
8373784,2,B002MAPFSS,"This movie has a great cast, but this copy is the worse I have ever bought from Amazon.  I will not buy another product from Synergy Entertainment.  The color is very dull.  The quality of the production takes away from the viewing of this movie. It is not clear and crisp, it has lines and is distorted.",1339459200,,304,4.298245614035087
8373785,5,B002MAPFSS,"I remembered this movie from TV and was glad to see it available from Amazon.com. This movie has a great cast, most of whom are members of the Burt Kennedy (the director) Stock Company. A previous reviewer mentioned that this was duplicated from a bad print. Yes, there is a scratch in the middle of the film at the beginning but the scratch disappears after a while. This was a TV movie for God's sake! We are lucky that this wasn't duplicated from a 16mm print. I guess if you like a movie well enough (and I liked this one!), you are willing to put up with some scratches.",1306195200,4,575,4.284403669724771
8373786,1,B002MAPFSS,I have been on the lookout for this for some time now now and what a huge disappointment. Whilst the movie is quite entertaining the transfer from film to DVD is abysmal and one of the worst I have ever encountered. Absolute rubbish and a total disgrace!,1264291200,6,254,4.425531914893617
