622078,3,6303307884,"Marengo Films has done a nice job with its Bela Lugosi double feature - pairing two of the horror icon's better Monogram efforts, ""Invisible Ghost"" (1941) and ""The Corpse Vanishes"" (1942). Though the print quality of ""Corpse"" is a notch below the sharpness of ""Ghost,"" it remains superior to most public-domain dupes. Decent sound quality to boot. Neither Lugosi film is a classic, but you could do a lot worse when it comes to low-budget horror.",1027296000,14,446,4.881578947368421
622079,5,6303307884,"Being a huge fan of the work of the great Bela Lugosi, I was pleased to see this new arrival from Marengo Films, a new company to this genre. The Invisable Ghost from 1941 and The Corpse Vanishes from 1942 were films Bela made after his famous role in Dracula.  In Ghost he is under the spell of his insane and domineering wife.  Bela carries out a series of stranglings and is as always, super creepy.  The Corpse Vanishes is another classic Lugosi film, Bela plays a crazy scientist that uses human blood to keep his dying wife alive.  These two films are a great pairing and a must for Lugosi fans.  I look forward to see other films released in this genre from Marengo.",976579200,15,673,4.352
622080,2,6303307884,"The oddities of this Monogram semi-horror film begin with the title!  The ""ghost"" in question is NOT invisible, and is not really a ghost.  Also, the shadow of an ape appears on the main title card.  (Don't ask me, I'm only the reviewer.)  The various plot twists contain no supernatural or science fiction elements, and yet are even less plausible than those of other Monogram horrors.  The director, Joseph Lewis, displays almost none of the talent he showed in his later films.  Only the presence of Bela Lugosi makes this one worthwhile.  The role of ""Dr. Kessler"" is a Jekyll/Hyde character, so Lugosi is playing a normal, likeable guy during most of his screen time, which makes this one of his more unusual roles.  Also, Clarence Muse is good as the butler.",976147200,4,764,4.734848484848484
622081,5,6303307884,"The title almost gives it away. ""The Invisible Ghost."" What  other kind of ghost IS there? While there are some genuinely creepy moments  in this black and white thriller, the plot is so hare-brained you'll need  multiple viewings just to absorb the details. Let's see; Bela Lugosi  believes his wife died in a car accident, but his gardener (!) actually has  her stowed in the back barn. When wifey staggers out in the rain and  ""haunts"" Lugosi, he falls into a trance and murders whoever's  handy, then ""wakes up"" remembering nothing. Throw in a cigar  chomping (and utterly ineffectual) police detective, the poor fellow who's  unjustly convicted of the murders and sent to the electric chair (!), the  casual way Lugosi and friends react to multiple homicides, and a  psycho-therapist who suggests Lugosi's murderous trance is, in fact, a  fairly common psychiatric disorder, and you've got one of the more whacked  movies in cinema history. I loved it!",968025600,9,957,4.981012658227848
622082,1,6303307884,"Bad film, which wastes the talent of Lugosi. Film is obviously low budget(where were you for this one Universal?), and some scenes are too dark. A better film is Killer Bats(a.k.a The Devil Bat).",962236800,4,195,4.764705882352941
622083,5,6303307884,"Bela Lugosi was an extremely intense actor. In ""Invisible Ghost"" his face expresses sadness and pain and then metamorphoses into a determined expression of malace and evil. It is amazing to watch. A tour de force of acting.

In another scene, he expresses compassion and warmth in tending to his injured butler. Sweetness incarnate.

Compassion, warmth, sadness, pain, menace and the depiction of taking pleasure in evil.
Bela Lugosi expresses all of these qualities in this film.

The very last scene, wherein he learns the solution to the mystery, shows us facial expressions that show a variety of emotions. I don't want to spoil the ending so I won't give details.

If you like Bela Lugosi, or want to know something about him and his range as an actor, I highly recommend this film.",946512000,,787,4.850746268656716
622184,5,6303307884,"WOW! To see this delightful film in crisp, pristine detail for the first time (and perfect sound, yet!) is a revelation. I hadn't noticed how detailed the set dressings are. Loretta Young's beautiful sister. My man Bela Lugosi--no matter what the script or dialogue he had to work with--he never ""walked through"" his part; he's never let me down. And the creative camera-work of the great John Alton! Silly premise? Relax, suspend disbelief, and have fun...",1491609600,5,457,5.026315789473684
622185,3,6303307884,"This is a comedy gone wrong.  The director and actors seemed to think they were in a spoof but then you really had a serial maniac killer on the loose.  When the cute boyfriend gets executed for a crime he did not commit,  his twin brother shows up to continue the romance-- they should have stuck with romantic comedy--it had some pretty funny elements in it;  but you can't get around the ending where the romantic lead's Dad is getting led off by the police.  They could have fixed it, like they did in ""Arsenic and Old Lace"",  by revealing, at the end, that the daughter was really adopted.",1491350400,,594,4.4036697247706424
622186,5,6303307884,"This is one of my favorite 1940's Lugosi films, and it is a great treat to see such a fine print of it.  The commentary tracks are informative and enjoyable, so I am completely satisfied with the purchase.",1490140800,3,205,4.394736842105263
622187,3,6303307884,"Invisible Ghost stars Bela Lugosi (Dracula) as Charles Kessler, a kind and wealthy physician who lives in a huge gothic mansion with his daughter, Virginia (Polly Ann Young) and servants. He is still mourning the loss of his beautiful, but unfaithful wife (Betty Compson), who died in a car accident several years earlier. In one of the films weirdest scenes, on the anniversary of their wedding, Charles pretends his wife is alive and his butler (Charles Muse) serves the imaginary Mrs. Kessler a meal by candlelight as Charles chats with her.

But unbeknownst to Charles, his wife is still alive, in a state of amnesia, and is secretly being cared for on the very grounds of the mansion by the gardener (Ernie Adams), who inexplicably believes its best to keep the fact that shes alive a secret. She periodically appears under Charles window and her reappearance hypnotizes him into becoming a homicidal killer. A number of murders occur, a police investigation ensues, and suspicion falls on an innocent person. The plot gets more involved as a series of loony events takes place, including a psychiatrist being called in to check on the sanity of everyone in the house.

Director Joseph H. Lewis contributes rich atmosphere to this Monogram programmer, but don't be misled by the title; theres nothing supernatural about the plot. After his phenomenal success in Dracula, Lugosi was typecast for the rest of his career and forced to take roles in low-budget horror films and thrillers. His presence and often hammy performance are the only elements saving this routine film. With its numerous twists and turns  all in just over one hour  its an overly ambitious effort, distinguished by better-than-average camera movement and moody black-and-white photography.

Bonus features on the unrated Blu-ray release include audio commentary by film historians Tom Weaver, Gary Rhodes and Dr. Robert J. Kiss, and trailers.",1490054400,,1918,5.134615384615385
622188,5,6303307884,"I was born in 1949 and grew up in the early years of television.
One of my favorite childhood memories was ""Shock Theater"",
a cheesy collection of old black and white horror films that came on at 10PM on Saturday night.
No DVRs back then.
I actually had to stay awake to watch these films.
Way past my bed time, but it was Saturday night.
I'm in my sixties now, and reliving my childhood on Blu-Ray.
Nobody cares if I fall asleep in the middle of a film.

The ""Shock Theater"" mainstays were Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, The Invisible Man, and The Wolf Man,
all produced by Universal, the pre-eminent horror studio of the 1930s and '40s,
But there were not enough of these.
To fill out their schedule, ""Shock Theater"" eventually threw in a lot of B-Movie horror films from Monogram, PRC (Producers Releasing Corporation) and the smaller independents (a lot of these featured Bela Lugosi).

1941: Ten years after ""Dracula"", Bela Lugosi was no longer a major star at Universal.
That year Universal cast Lugosi in the first Wolf Man film, but only in the relatively small part of ""Bela the Gypsy"".
In 1941 Lugosi signed a contract to star in nine films for poverty-row Monogram Pictures.
""The Invisible Ghost"" was his return to leading man status, however tenuous.

The ""Monogram Nine"", produced 1941-1944:
Invisible Ghost, Spooks Run Wild, Black Dragons, The Corpse Vanishes, Bowery at Midnight, The Ape Man, Ghosts on the Loose, Voodoo Man, Return of the Ape Man

The ""Invisible Ghost"" Blu-Ray features an entertaining audio commentary from film historian Tom Weaver:
""Welcome to the cockeyed world of Monogram horror movies, with plots and dialogue so wacky, so dream-like, that you can't be faulted for thinking that no vintage Hollywood horror movie could be this senseless, this ridiculous,
But oh yes they are, particularly the ones that starred Bela Lugosi.""

The Internet Movie Data Base (IMDB) notes that director Joseph H. Lewis' ""ability to elevate basically mundane and mediocre low-budget material to sublime cinematic art has gained him a substantial cult following among movie buffs.""
There is no better example of this than ""The Invisible Ghost"".
The pacing and cinematography are way beyond what you'd expect from Monogram,
but I can't say the same for the screenplay which is truly horrible.
A guilty pleasure among classic horror movie fans.
Nicely restored picture,
English SDH subtitles.

BELA LUGOSI HORROR FILMS ON BLU-RAY
Universal has always been good about issuing their major titles on DVD and Blu-Ray,
but until recently, if you wanted to watch most of the other studio's films,
you had to settle for bare-bones DVDs from companies like Alpha Video.
Recently several of these films have found their way onto Blu-Rays from companies like Kino, VCI, Olive Films, and even the prestigious Criterion Collection.
Improved picture quality and a reasonable selection of bonus features, not usually associated with cheap Public Domain B-Movies.

622257,5,6303307884,"This movie made me sad. A mediocre little Monogram programmer was actually given some subtext by Bela's sympathetic and genial performance as the respected Dr. Kessler, who was driven mad by his wife's abandonment.
Given the time period and Lugosi's reputation for horror we know he had to play the part of the bad guy, but it's hard not to wonder what Lugosi might have done had he been given a role like Sam Dodsworth (with a suitably immigrant back story, of course)
By the time of the making of Invisible Ghost Lugosi is pushing 60 and is still a tall, charming, courtly man who came into his own with a rare un-actory realism in the scenes where he was interacting with Doctor Kessler's staff. These scenes stood out for their naturalness and sincerity. Lugosi's  on-screen interactions with Clarence Muse as his butler, Evans were enough to make me wonder if the two men weren't very good friends off camera as well. Muse played his role with sympathetic gravitas and natural human dignity which was often not allowed to black actors at the time. He was a delight and it was refreshing to see his sane character on the screen in the midst of the overwrought, but mediocre acting of the so many of the other characters.

The plot? Well, what there was of it involved missing, presumed dead wives who were living in a gardener's shack for years. Every now and again this woman would pop up and set her husband off into a homicidal, somnambulistic trance---yeah, I don't get it either, but Monogram wanted to make their Boogie Man kill people...so here we are.

Polly Ann Young, was, of course, in the spirit of all the Young girls, lovely and with a lovely low voice like her sister, Loretta. Her love interest irritated me from his rude, pushy entrance into the Kessler home when Polly Ann, as Virginia Kessler, the Doc's daughter, specifically asked him NOT to come over. After that, nothing he could do could win me over. I know that was considered the way a ""real man"" conducted himself, to show that nothing could stop him from getting what he wanted...even if the person he loved gave him a direct request about HER OWN HOME!!! But, sorry. Blowing off someone because you think ""you"" and what you want are more important is an ugly trait. Virginia should have dropped someone so indifferent to her requests like a hot rock. Fortunately fate took care of that for her and we were then treated to his marginally less skeevy twin brother
The love interest and a murdered maid were the real creepy characters in this movie to me. Bela and Clarence Muse were delightful in their onscreen time together..",1467244800,,2608,4.6529284164859

Her punishment was to lose said boyfriend in a car accident not far from home.  Loony as a bedpost, she is secreted in the basement of a building by Kessler's gardener.  Periodically, she turns up outside the house to give her husband the evil eye while the sight of the duplicitous wretch puts him into a stupor of rage, forcing him to seek out necks to strangle as he thinks of hers, forever out of his reach.  Someone should have schooled him in the art of anger management.  Alas, he didn't have far to go to find victims.  Let's just say the man was hard on his domestics.  Things take a turn when the twin brother of the man who was accused and executed for the crimes turns up wanting answers.  Dr. Kessler helpfully allows him to say in his home.

What he doesn't know is that she survived in a mentally damaged state and one of his sevants has been keeping her hidden out of pity and loyalty.  She escapes occasionally at night and when Lugosi sees her he goes into a hypnotic state and murders.  Incidentally, the actress who plays his daughter is Loretta Young's sister.  The resemblance shows.  What doesn't seem to be addressed much is that an innocent man is accused, arrested, tried, convicted, and executed for one of the murders.  No one, not even his brother, seems to be particularly indignant about this INJUSTICE.  Capital punishment is another term for legalized murder and an innocent man cannot be said to get a fair trial when he IS innocent.

This movie would have easily achieved five stars, (targeted specifically, of course, at black-and-white B-horror film fans like me), except for the fact that this flick ends pretty abruptly, catching viewers a bit off-guard. It's as if some assertive studio bean-counter waltzed into the movie set and informed the director, midway through the film, that his budget for this one had just been slashed. It's not a hateful finale but I was surprised at the lack of traditional ceremony near the end and viewers will additionally notice that this 1941 movie is a bit abbreviated at sixty-four minutes, (not all that uncommon for the genre.)

THE STORY: (The setting) Mysterious murders have been occurring in the neighborhood of Mr. Charles Kessler (Bela Lugosi), amiable patriarch of a moderate estate.

Kessler's lovely daughter, Virginia, is about to be affianced to a promising young man, Ralph Dickson, who had once involved himself in a previous tryst with a young lass who had since gone to work as Mr. Kessler's flashy and concupiscent house maid, Cecile Mannix (played by Terry Walker), all this history being unknown to Virginia and others in the household. This is one domestic gal who is not going to be put off by Dickson's desire for a new love -- she confronts him with the issue but he is not in the least inclined to take her back.

Mr. Kessler himself is a bit wacky: his wife had run off with her paramour a couple years before. The amorous two were soon thereafter involved in a spectacular car crash and it was believed that they were both instantly killed. But unbeknownst to all but Kessler's Gardener, Jules Mason and his wife Mrs. Mason, Mrs. Kessler had actually survived and had since been kept alive, housed, and secured in a secret basement cell of Jules' gardening shed. Maintaining a belief that his wife was dead, (whom he unexplainably still loved), Mr. Kessler engages in speaking directly to an empty chair each year on their wedding anniversary as if she was there dining across the table from him.

[The plot thickens!] Lugosi freaks out at times when he inadvertently spots his wife on the grounds, (she intermittently overcomes Jules' clearly inadequate security precautions and goes out strolling in her night-clothes), and he falls into a sort of trance, effecting a Frankenstein-ish, arms-extended gait when this happens. As a result of his mesmerized condition, he stalks into the maid's room and strangles her, (and thus, the viewer learns who's been pulling off all the nasty murders in the neighborhood!)

This particular murder generates two items of relevance for the young fianc, Ralph Dickson: 1. his problem concerning the maid's extortion becomes moot, and; 2. he immediately becomes the chief suspect in her murder since the butler, Evans (artfully played by Clarence Muse), had overheard an argument between them and was triggered to reveal this fact to the police when questioned. Poor Ralph is subsequently arrested, convicted, and executed! But soon thereafter, Ralph's identical twin, Paul Dickson, shows up to look into the accusations against his now-dead brother and he's taken in by the Kesslers as a welcome house guest.

Lugosi spots his wife on the grounds again and this time he strangles Jules - but Jules revives for just a moment after all others thought he was dead, only to look up and see the faces of both his wife and Kessler hovering over him. It's a very edifying moment when Kessler tasks him: ""Jules..! Did you recognize the man who tried to kill you?!?"" Ha! Jules' eyes bulge a bit, he sucks in his breath at the image of Kessler, and THEN he conks out for good.

So what happens next? A new cook is hired, (Mr. Kessler experiences difficulties in keeping domestic help), Kessler spots his wife again, and then guess what? You'll have to watch the movie to find out as I'm stopping here to avoid spoilers. That's the oddest part about this movie - it takes forever to set up the plot scenario and then it closes out quite hurriedly.

One aspect of this film which I especially treasured was the casting of Clarence Muse in the role of Mr. Kessler's butler, Evans. He has a notably major speaking role here and his delivery, as always, was stellar. Muse often provided comic relief as he did in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherlock-Holmes-in-Washington/dp/B0000APVBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherlock Holmes in Washington</a>&nbsp;where he played George the Porter in an uncredited but key role.

Muse possessed a particular talent for conveying great dignity as a domestic worker or, in other period stereotypical African-American film roles.

In summary, I award this Lugosi landmark movie a high ranking among its peer films but be prepared for the lightning-quick ending.",1268524800,,5123,5.182587666263603

622357,2,6303307884,"Invisible Ghost was released in 1941 10-years after Bela Lugosi became a star on the rise starring as Count Dracula in the horror classic Dracula. Fact of the matter is Lugosi never really fully capitalized on the success of Dracula and while his career did sort of go downhill after Dracula he was still making movies under Universal and having a pretty good career, but he never had a character quite as Iconic as Dracula. He starred in quite a few movies with Boris Karloff in the 30s, but around the 40s is when Lugosi hit Poverty Row, which was a slang for low budget studios.

As much as I love Bela Lugosi for me Boris Karloff is the king of the horror genre, but even for those who prefer Lugosi his career never quite took off like Karloff's and let's be honest; Lugosi was a better actor than given credit for, but he doesn't have the range Karloff did. By the time of the release of Invisible Ghost, Lugosi was starting to hit hard times. He did star in a few movies for major studios, but in general he was reduced to a small role that was beneath him and in a lot of the movies it was a role that essentially any actor could have played. Lugosi appeared in the RKO release of The Body Snatcher with Boris Karloff in 1945 and by this time when Lugosi had a role in a movie under a major studio it was either a cameo or in the case of The Body Snatcher he was just sort of there and had no lines at all or in this case very little dialogue. So that shows you how Bela Lugosi went from this greatness to struggling for roles, which was really quite a shame.

Even when Bela Lugosi would get a starring role in a movie by the likes of Universal like The Ghost of Frankenstein, by that point the series was now seen as a B-movie rather than an A, but even with a movie like Ghost of Frankenstein being seen as a B movie it's still light-years ahead of Poverty Row. Despite the fact Lugosi was reduced to Poverty Row he was still making some enjoyable movies. The best way to describe this movie for a modern audience is if there had been VHS and or DVDs Invisible Ghost would have been a movie that went DTV.

The screenplay by Al & Helen Martin is quite poor; while not the worst script out there it was poor with weak characters and an even weaker plot. Nothing is explained plot wise and the characters were rather boring. Lugosi plays Charles Kessler and we find out his wife left him for another man we also find out she was in a car accident and the guy died, but she lived. For some reason the Gardner keeps her hidden and she sometimes wanders off and when Kessler sees her he becomes hypnotized and kills people.

The reason the Gardner keeps her hidden is he doesn't want Kessler to see what she's become since it seems she has some brain damage. Wow great explanation. And why exactly does Kessler become hypnotized and go on a killing spree? Well your guess is as good as mine. Truth is by a certain point of the movie I wasn't really paying full attention so if a reason was given I must have missed it. The biggest flaw with the movie is we know Kessler is the killer and it take away from the movie.

And what I find funny is people are being killed in the house and yet not one person suspects anyone else and nobody bothers to lock their doors. I don't know about you, but if people in my house are being killed I'm gonna be suspicious of the other people and make sure my door is locked. Invisible Ghost really is just an idiotic movie.

Director Joseph H. Lewis fails at brining any suspense or any tension. In fairness he doesn't much to work with. Making something out of this script would be no easy task. But the one good thing I can say is the actors aren't half bad. For such a low budget flick the acting wasn't bad well some of the actors were poor, but some were fairly decent. But even with that Joseph H. Lewis never is able to get much going.

Over the years the horror genre has had many great suspenseful and scary movies, but there's just something about horror from the 30s and 40s that has never been captured again. These movies often had this really eerie look that was loaded with atmosphere and again over the years many horror flicks have had that, but not like they did in the 30s and 40s, but Invisible Ghost really has none of that at all.

Many have called Invisible Ghost the so bad its good movie and I suppose you can make a case for that, but for me this was just so bad it's well bad. There are moments that are fun in how bad they are, but in general I was just bored. Invisible Ghost only runs at about 65-minutes, but personally it felt a lot longer. It's quite a shame Bela Lugosi got stuck making movies like this and it would get even worse for him in the 50s. To go from starring in Dracula and movies along side Boris Karloff is a huge drop in the acting food chain.

I can see how this movie would appeal to some viewers, but for me it was just mostly a waste. You can find so many better horror flicks from this era that it's best to just skip this. The only reason to watch it is if you are a big Lugosi fan like I am. Lugosi was excellent, but he has such lousy material to work with there's only so much he can do.",1229040000,3,5185,4.177

622359,4,6303307884,"Bela Lugosi was compelled to make a number of poor films during his down and out years, but 1941's Invisible Ghost should not be counted among them.  While this is the first of Bela's infamous ""Monogram Nine,"" it's actually a pretty interesting film, and one that allows Bela's star power to shine in several of its many facets.  This talented actor could be quite the charmer in the right cinematic environment, as he proved in Dracula, and the role of Charles Kessler in Invisible Ghost provided him with an opportunity to showcase the warm, genteel aspect of his nature alongside the legendary horror prowess that made him famous.  Of course, Kessler's a little bit odd - he does, after all, enjoy a serious dinner with his wife on the anniversary of their marriage, despite the fact that he has not seen her since she left him (and supposedly died) several years earlier - but he's a most sympathetic character with a wonderful daughter, a respected position in the community, and a most amiable personal nature.

Unfortunately, Kessler's home is quickly becoming a house of horrors.  The first victim is the new maid, and her death complicates matters a great deal.  We the viewers know who killed her because we watched the murder as it happened.  Circumstantial evidence, however, leads the cops to charge Ralph Dickson (John McGuire), who just so happens to be the serious boyfriend of Kessler's daughter Virginia (Polly Ann Young), with this murder most foul.  As additional murders follow, you can only wonder who will be next and when the authorities will figure out what we already know - the true identity of the murderer.  You might think that your foreordained knowledge of the murderer would make Invisible Ghost a boring affair, but it really doesn't - largely thanks to Bela Lugosi's incredible performance (and a certain plot point I found rather shocking).

Joseph H. Lewis also deserves a lot of credit for making this film rise above its B-movie origins.  As director, he maintains the gloomy atmosphere throughout, and he also gives us some unusual but wonderfully effective camera angles - including a truly memorable one through the flames of a fireplace.  The lighting also wonderfully accentuates the whole effect of several Bela Lugosi close-ups (and no one has ever done close-ups like Bela Lugosi did).  I will go so far as to tell you the butler didn't do it, but said butler (played by Clarence Muse) deserves special mention, as well.  Rather than serve as stereotypical grist for the Hollywood mill, this African-American character was presented with seriousness and respect - quite a rarity for films of this particular era.

It's just unfortunate that the rest of Lugosi's films for Monogram lacked the kind of script and talent Invisible Ghost provided - this first of Lugosi's ""Monogram Nine"" is far and away the best of the lot.  I would place this high on the second tier of Lugosi's most impressive performances.",1148169600,2,2953,4.923387096774194
622360,5,6303307884,"For those who love to pop in these little ""B"" programmers on a rainy night with a bowl of popcorn this one with Bela Lugosi will certainly do the trick.

A good story and a nice cast you've probably never heard of offer ""B"" fans a real treat in this atmospheric mystery that's strictly for fun. There is some good pacing by director Joseph H. Lewis so the story never lags in its meager 64 minutes. The cops don't seem as dumb as often portrayed in the programmers and when the plot takes a wild turn it doesn't seem hokey but simply part of the story.

Lugosi's wife is thought dead but unbeknownst to him is actually being hidden away after a car crash left her mind a mess. He still loves her and pines for her in the house they lived in. His pretty daughter Virginia (Polly Ann Young) lives with him and is about to marry when her husband-to-be is arrested and convicted for one of the muders which have been occuring at the house.

Lugosi, of course, is the real killer, going into a trance every time his wife sneaks out, and making it only as far as the house. The attractive maid who has the hots for Virginia's boyfriend gets it first, then the gardner. When Virginia's fiance pays the ultimate price for a crime he did not commit, his twin brother Paul (John McGuire) shows up and romance blooms between he and Virginia despite the murders.

The cops are trying to figure out who could be doing the killings and Lugosi senses something may be terribly wrong when he awakens from a trance in his daughter's room. He comes to before anything horrible happens but begins to suspect the unthinkable.

It's best not to ask how or why Lugosi's wife only gets loose at night or why her appearance sends him over the edge. This genre of ""B"" was only meant to be a fun distraction and it succeeds. It is miles ahead of some of Lugosi's Poverty Row stuff during the same period and rates high for fans of ""B"" horror and mystery films.",1147219200,3,1934,4.361111111111111
622361,3,6303307884,"As I write this review, there are at least ten, separate DVD releases for the film, The Invisible Ghost (1941), some double features, some stand alone releases, which is usually a good indicator that the movie has fallen into the public domain, meaning the original copyright for the film has since lapsed, and now anyone can broadcast or release the film, if they have the means.  The most famous case of this is Frank Capra's It's A Wonderful Life (1946).  Ever wonder why it's shown on every stinking channel all hours of the day and night during the holidays?  Well, it is a classic, but also none of the TV stations that broadcast it have to pay a penny to anyone for showing it...but I digress...written by Al and Helen Martin and directed by Joseph H. Lewis (Pride of the Bowery, The Mad Doctor of Market Street), The Invisible Ghost stars Bela Lugosi (Dracula, White Zombie), in one of a number of poverty row films he starred in during his `exile' from the major studio system.  Also appearing is Polly Ann Young (Murder on the Yukon), John McGuire (The Prisoner of Shark Island), Clarence Muse (Huckleberry Finn, Show Boat), Terry Walker (Dangerous Lady), Betty Compson (Mr. & Mrs. Smith), Ernie Adams (Pride of the Legion), and George Pembroke (Bluebeard).

As the film begins we see Charles Kessler (Lugosi) sitting down to dinner alone...or is he?  He's seems to be having a conversation with the empty chair across from him (he even tells the butler to serve the empty chair first)...nutty, perhaps, but then we learn this is an annual event, marking Kessler's wedding anniversary, only Mrs. Kessler (Compson) is unable to attend due to the fact she ran off with another man some years ago, leaving behind Charles and their daughter Virginia (Young), and died in a subsequent car accident, or so is the common belief.  Well, turns out she ain't dead, but secretly stowed away in the cellar of the gardener's shack...why?  I had a hard time understanding (and I saw the film!), but it has something to do with her having amnesia.  Since her leaving there's been a rash of unexplained murders, which only happen at night, of the household staff (strangulations), but little in the way of clues as to the murderer.  Virginia's boyfriend Ralph (McGuire) makes the scene, just about the time the current maid gets it, who he apparently had a past history with, and now he's on the hot seat, fingered by the inept authorities for her death.  His brother Paul (also played by McGuire) shows up, and another person dies (the gardener), proving that, while good help may be hard to find, it's even harder to keep...from getting killed!  Things eventually come to a head during a dark and stormy night as those left try to get to the bottom of things...

There really isn't much of a mystery here although it seems like the film was touted as such within the promotional material, as we know who the killer is fairly early into the film, along with the motive.  Another thing the film does not have, despite the title, is an actual ghost, which was disappointing as I do like a good ghost story, but whatever...given how much we know early on, there seems to be little in terms of the story to keep the audience interested, but the movie does have a few things going for it, like creepy atmosphere and Lugosi himself.  There's a scene in the film where Lugosi's character's in the maid's room, and the camera is positioned in such a way that it looks like he's coming at the audience.  He has a smile on his face, but it's not of the `Let's be friends' type...no, it's more of the sinister `I going to throttle the life out of you' type.  This, to me, was the highlight as few could pull off this kind of thing as well as he did.  Another interesting aspect with regards to the film was that of Clarence Muse's character of the African American butler Evans.  I was half expecting some sort of goofy, buffoonish, caricature prevalent in films about the time, but that wasn't the case here.  His character was actually a capable one, lacking any speech impediments, one that seemed to garner a certain amount of respect despite his position within the household.  Actually, Muse was quite an accomplished individual, holding a law degree, and thought of as a pioneer in the black theater movement.  As far as John McGuire playing the dual roles of the brothers Ralph and Paul Dickson, there wasn't, as far as I know, any mention of them being twins, but I think this was done because it was probably cheaper to just have one actor play both roles.  The one aspect that really stuck me as odd was the fact that while there were a number of murders in the house, no one within the house seemed all that put out by the fact a murderer was running around.  I don't know about you, but someone gets murdered in my house, I'll be commencing to freaking out...the characters seemed not so bothered that household servants were being knocked off (and the murderer may be lurking about), but more so by the inconvenience of having to fill another, vacant position.  Also, the story is filled with aspects that are the way they are only because they're written in the script that way, and not because they developed naturally.  All in all the good canceled out the bad, so I was left feeling pretty neutral by the end.  Had the movie not had Lugosi, I wouldn't have even bothered...I haven't seen all of Lugosi's poverty row films, but of the ones I have seen, White Zombie (1932), Bowery at Midnight (1942), and The Devil Bat (1940) are among the better ones, in my opinion.

This Roan DVD release features a decent looking, fullscreen (1.33:1) picture, presented in its original aspect ratio.  The print does have plenty of flaws, but it is watchable.  The Dolby Digital mono audio comes through well enough.  There are a couple of extra features on the DVD, including a Cast & Credits listing, and text relating a little about the films background, which is also the same material print on the back of the DVD case.  As I said, there are at least ten different DVD releases of this film, and I couldn't speak towards the quality of these other releases, so buyer beware.

He seems to be truly in love with his or maybe obsessed is a better word.  His deliberate stalking of his victims, creeping up from behind or as they sleep is just fun to watch.

There doesn't seem to have been any reason for Paul Dickson to be an exact twin of Ralph's, as nothing was made of this fact outside of the initial reaction of Kessler's daughter, Virgina.

A good Role for Bela, one where he was the real murderer as opposed the red herring he would play in many other films.",1119484800,,2093,4.492063492063492
622396,3,6303307884,"Bela Lugosi plays a poor sap who's wife ran off with another man, only to die in a fiery car-crash. Or did she? Wifey seems to come back nightly, haunting Bela through windows on stormy nights. This somehow puts him into a trance, sending him somnambulantly walking about, looking for victims to smother with his bathrobe! I guess he takes his spousal frustrations pretty seriously! INVISIBLE GHOST is a misleading title, as there are no ghosts, invisible or otherwise. It is however a good vehicle for Lugosi to be the sympathetic character, even though he's the killer! Check it out...",1112054400,2,587,4.88
622397,3,6303307884,"Lugosi's horror movies of the late thirties and forties for Monogram pictures weren't particularly memorable or ingenious, but they served their purposes and were reasonably entertaining. In this movie, Lugosi is haunted by the ghost of his dead wife, and every time he sees her, he is put in a murderous trance. The plot is kind of hokey, but there are a few atmospheric scenes, and the acting is surprisingly good for this kind of movie.
The DVD from St. Claire Vision is in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio. Unsurprisingly for a public domain horror movie, the picture is plauged with scratches, and it is consistently blurry (although if you're shopping in the bargain bin, like I did, you should know what to expect). There are no extra features, which is also unsurprising.",1092700800,,779,4.864661654135339
622398,3,6303307884,"We are told that Bela Lugosi's wife died in a car wreck while fleeing with her lover.  Even so, Bela is devoted to her memory, and obsesses in grief.  When the fickle spouse returns by night, she stands alive and silent beneath Bela's window.  Under her hypnotic spell, he falls into a trance, and commits murder.  Sound confusing?  Join the club.  Among other things, the woman's mysterious power over Bela is not explained.  Lugosi's poverty row horror thrillers are best for fanatic cheap horror fans.  (Count me as one of these).  The script and other production values put low budget limits on one's viewing pleasure.  At least the DVD is more technically tolerable than the low grade VHS tape that previously haunted our movie shelf.  The dark and stormy night in the old mansion is an overworked cliche that is still fun to watch.  Bela is only passively menacing in this one.  He is a pawn, and not the instigator.  This is a change from the usual mad doctor tampering in God's Domain.  The other cast adequately goes through the motions.  It's an agreeable way to spend 60+ minutes.

622399,4,6303307884,"I don't know that I would recomend Marengo as a quality DVD company, but this double feature from them is pretty good.
First one must consider that MONOGRAM PICTURES was a poverty row studio that rarely kept many negatives around. Most prints existing today were made from negatives struck from the studio's 1940s release prints.  This means they are another generation away from the original negatives.
THE CORPSE VANISHES is the weaker of the two picture wise.  It is soft and people's faces are a bit washed out.  There are always film scratch lines present, but they are not very distracting. The film is clean of splices and the sound is clear. As of 2003, this is the best quality transfer available for this title, about the same as the ROAN copy.
THE INVISIBLE GHOST is much better. It is quite sharp with good contrast, and almost no scratches. The sound is even better. The title card is from a 1950s re-issue by Astor Pictures and that part looks grainy & dark.  But don't let that dismay you, the actual movie is good. It is also similar to the ROAN copy.
If you are a fan of these low budget, erie atmosphere films, you will thoroughly enjoy this DVD!",1051833600,14,1164,4.555023923444976
622400,3,6303307884,"Actually ""The Invisible Ghost"" does refer to a character in this 1941 film, but then the only thing that matters is Bela Lugosi's name on the title card.  Lugosi plays Charles Kessler, who we meet having dinner with his wife on their wedding anniversary; the only problem is that according to daughter Virginia (Polly Ann Young), her mother was killed in a car accident several years earlier as she was about to run off with her husband's best friend.  But Kessler still worships his wife and on their anniversary he convinces himself he is having dinner with his beloved.  Sounds plausible enough, but the truth is that Mrs. Kessler (Betty Compson) survived the auto accident and is being kept in the gardener's shed by the caretaker, Jules (Ernie Adams), who keeps assuring the poor woman that she will be taken to her husband and daughter ""soon.""  Meanwhile, there have been a series of strange murders in the neighborhood and when the maid is struck down the suspicion falls on Virginia's beau (John McGuire).  But, of course, that is not close enough to home to really ruin the rest of Virginia's life and sooner or later the local cops will figure out the truth of what is going on here.
""The Invisible Ghost"" is the best of the nine Poverty Row productions Lugosi made for Monogram after his fall from grace at Universal Studios.  The problems in the script (you can usually find the body after a car crash for starters) are compensated for by the work of director Joe Lewis, who shows a lot of cinematic flair for a B-film director making a quickie (e.g., filming the fireplace during the exposition).  This film is rather face paced and gets a lot in for only 64-minutes.  The other advantage it has is that Lugosi's performance is better than the plot; I mean, come on, you know who the murderer is before the movie begins, and it is just a question of waiting for all the pieces to be forced into place by the time the film ends.  This is not a suspense film, but more one about atmosphere and mood.  The insane wife, befuddled daughter and falsely accused beau are all above average performances as well; if you were just listening to them you would not know this was a low-budget horror film.  There are times when I think this is Lugosi's best performance, but I am probably more comfortable claiming it is one in which he plays his most sympathetic character.  But if you do not have a strong stomach for stupid plots, then you would want to pass this one bye.",1038960000,,2475,4.574660633484163
622401,5,6303307884,"Although not technically or artistically superior, Invisible Ghost is a winner for Lugosi fans. He plays Charles Kessler, who employs a butler, a maid, a cook and a gardener. There is a series of murders which cannot be solved. Controlled by his estranged wife, who is in a lost world herself (hidden below a storage room by the gardener), Kessler commits the murders in a trance with no memory of them in his normal state. Lugosi is very pleasant and unknowing of what is happening to him/others. This film is very satisfying to Lugosi fans but may be boring to general classic horror fans.

7843185,4,6303307884,"Actually, it's a decent poverty row thriller. Think of the story more as Gothic Horror, as it's really in that vein. I actually wonder why  that choice wasn't made as the story screams it-- ghosts of the past, a mystery, lights going out, even a set of twins (for no real reason whatsoever except the studio was too cheap to pay another actor). Lugosi gives it his all, as always. The supporting cast is good-- especially Clarence Muse as the butler. As a black actor in the 40's, he gives the role such intelligence and dignity, that I wish  I could see him in more stuff. The title is a bit nonsensical but I suppose it was needed to see it as a Lugosi horror movie. Too bad. Under better hands this could have been a classic",1526169600,,727,4.299270072992701

I enjoy this film and have seen it several times in my years watching old ,new and classic horror. This is a Lugosi must see and own for collectors. Kino did a very good job on the clean up of this version I appreciate the effort. The story is well known and the company that made it was not Universal but Monogram a poverty row out fit. Both Karloff and Lugosi would spend time at these bottom of the barrel studios but they would come out with the occasional classic . Invisible Ghost is a classic for Bela and it is one fun ride for classic horror fans.
The extras are a commentary by Tom Weaver and company. I felt it was a little flat. The film has an interesting story and will keep you watching with or with out the commentary. I recommend this version to fans of Lugosi for the nice presentation of a minor gem.",1492992000,2,1058,4.1911764705882355
