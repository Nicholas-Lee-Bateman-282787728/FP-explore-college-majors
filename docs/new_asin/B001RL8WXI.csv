3777038,1,B001RL8WXI,"This is a rather peculiar item. It's pretty hard to resist the title,"" The Terminators "" combined with this box art. But if your expecting an army of humanoid robots like the ones on the cover you will certainly be disappointed. There isn't much of a lot/story to this. Just a lot of disjointed stuff happens. Taking place in a future time, soon enough to still have cell phones, yet far enough that lifelike androids serve man and seemingly have replaced humans in at least one military function. For some reason or another (its hard to figure) these cybernetic musclemen have turned on us and dropped a big bomb on a major U.S. city. Now we follow  a group of simple small town folk as they try to survive the onslaught while trying to get to a space station to turn the androids/cyborgs off. Why this is their job and no one else is trying to get there is a mystery. The other
conflict comes when it is learned that any of the humans may actually be robots themselves and they must deduct who is friend and who is foe.
  The major problem with all of this is the tiny shot on video budget and look of the movie, and the most disjointed editing I have ever seen. I really had a hard time telling where on character is in relation to another. Very confusing. A lot of characters just don't behave logically or even how a human being would react at all. Several characters display bizarre actions and decision making. At times it is actually hard to tell what people are saying. That certainly doesn't help. And I am not revealing any ""spoilers"" when I say that the movie has no end, resolution or climax. The movie simply stops, as though the film broke or, more than likely was never finished. And that is the overall feeling you get from this film. Unfinished. You feel from time to time that something is missing and often there is no motivation for characters to behave as they do. Likewise, conflicts are introduced and never resolved.
To be fair. The special effects, all digital, are quite good. Not incredible but certainly much better than you would expect from a cheapie such as this. There is a boss robot that does look like the ones on the cover art. But it is only one. The rest are all just musclemen in tanktops. Some, but not all, are played by the same actor, suggesting an assembly like production. The commentary is also very strange and it is almost impossible to make out what they are saying.",1302220800,3,2416,4.461538461538462
3777039,2,B001RL8WXI,"The special effects are good to great.  The acting and the characters are also good to great.  However, the movie runs out of steam as the end approaches, and many plot threads are left unresolved and unexplained.  The movie ends with a dull, boring whimper.  No explanations, no real climax.  It is almost a three-star movie.  I would watch it again knowing its limitations.

Paul Logan is perfect as the Terminators; you don't think a movie called ""The Terminators"" would have just one Terminator, do ya?  A. Martinez is also perfect as the Sheriff; he is strong and calm and protective of the others.  The various female characters are more heroic than any of the young males, though the movie has far too many major-minor characters.

The ""Filmmakers' Commentary"" track is people having fun talking about the movie.  It is almost worth another star.",1279065600,,853,4.854166666666667
3777040,3,B001RL8WXI,The item was scratched upon arrival and fell out during shipping. Item fell out of its hub,1278460800,,90,4.352941176470588
3777041,2,B001RL8WXI,"Low budget violent blood fest.  There,  I've said most of it. Urban locations, probably Los Angeles warehouse district etc.  Scanty FX.  Seeing once is enough.",1267315200,,159,5.24
3777042,2,B001RL8WXI,"I must agree with many other reviews on this one.  My nine year old has really gotten into the series and it rekindled my enjoyment of T1 and T2.  After recently seeing Terminator: Salvation, I was really hopeful for a similar action packed joyride, that provides plot development between T3 and Salvation.  I'll refer to this film as T4 which is actually a low-budget attempt to cash-in on the Terminator legacy.  It could have been sooooo much better if there was at least a reference to Sarah and John Conner.  Instead, we're led on a journey that begins with Skynets sudden awareness and decision to eradicate humanity.  Okay, let's accept this, maybe we need to see the rise of the human reaction and resonse to Skynet and the army John Conner will ultimately organize and lead.  Instead, the acting, plot, scripts and low-budget special effects provide a series of random destruction, two-dimensional characters, most of whom you're glad to see 'hasta la vista, babied'.

The film presents Skynet and the benefit it has provided humanity - principally a cyborg (apparently only one model exists which probably saved the cost of hiring other actors or support technological special effects) which perform menial tech or labor tasks on a global scale.  Other than this 'benefit' to humanity, modern life shows no other technological advancement beyond the ubiquitous cell phone.  With Skynet's sudden awareness (we could call it Order 66 for a Star Wars analogy) the cyborgs suddenly turn on humanity.  It's a strange rebellion, with cyborgs hunting and killing humans one at a time. A nuke does destroy LA, but you would think the cyborgs would be organized like a mass army and there would be different machines other than the generic cyborg and space shuttles to destroy humanity.  If you saw AI: Artificial Intelligence, the Mechs are fully a part of the social infrastructure as are many other technological advancements (same with the incredible Blade Runner).  Terminator: Salvation gives a much better sense of this blend of new and existing techology as well as the diversity of Skynet's evil machines.

In T4, a small group of surviving townsfolk collect around the town sherriff to run through a maze of pitiful 1970's backlot warehouses and a scrubby desert to escape the few cyborgs bent on twisting their heads off.  Suddenly, Jeremy London (what happened to his career? maybe a new agent would help) arrives with a super-gun which stuns the cyborgs with its pulse blast.  He is really there to monitor the Sherriff who turns out to be a 'good-guy' cyborg.  Of course, the Sherriff who saved the lives of his companions suddenly can't be trusted.  London reluctantly assumes leadership of the group, and gathers them to an abandoned shuttle.  The survivors are picked off as they gather scuba tanks to fuel the shuttle.  This gets them into space, where they successfully evade a fleet of Skynet attack shuttles, and land on Skynets main control space center.  With the true personality traits of the selfish, riff-raff survivors coming to light, we can sit back and enjoy their destruction.  We can also thank the quality of our education system that the teenager who just achieved her GED, can hotwire a van as well as figure out Skynet's computer system and shut it down.  Whew, just in time.

Credits suddenly appear and you're left with some, albeit litte, concern about the fate of the survivors and what part they may play in the Terminator series.  Apparently none at all as Salvation picks up where Skynet has reinvigorated itself and advanced the volume and variety of machines to destroy humanity.

So why would I even give the film two stars, I suppose more for the mental exercise of trying to connect the series of films and some sort of loyalty to the overall concept.  It would be great to have a complete remake of the rise of Skynet.  My fantasy film would show a Society that has visibly grown dependent on cyborgs and related technology.  With Skynet's sudden awareness, humanity would be systematically destroyed, but for an unknown reason, Skynet must preserve some of the species which prevents it from committing total nuclear annihilation.  The Jeremy London character could be the one who needs to preserve and transfer a piece of critical information to John Conner - perhaps the voice tapes Sarah Conner made for John in Salvation), or a missing piece of technology prevents Skynet from developing the T2 Terminator or can render it harmless (notice the fluid metal and indestructible character doesn't reappear in Salvation - how would humanity resist an army of these cyborgs).  Maybe he is the one who provides the frequency code that allows Conner and army to save his father and destroy the LA Skynet branch.

Come on Hollywood, pull together the funds and make a film that has a meaningful relation to the Terminator series and provides the joyride we movie-goers had come to expect.  Then we can pretend this film never happened.",1266537600,2,4982,4.92814371257485
3777043,1,B001RL8WXI,"This has got to be the worst movie of all time. Acting sucked, special effects sucked, dialog sucked. I mean, this movie sucked big time. Don't waste your money or your time. The person that rated the movie with 5 stars needs to be in a funny-farm. Something wrong with you dude...

Don't buy this movie. Don't even watch it on late night TBS. It really does suck. I'm just trying to figure out how I can get my 2 hours back that I wasted in my life watching this trashed out movie.",1253145600,3,482,4.182795698924731
3777044,4,B001RL8WXI,"The acting, script, and graphics were an absolute laugh. If the producers were trying to produce a serious action flick then I'd have to rate it one star. I missed the first 30 minutes of the movie but will watch for it to come on again so I can see it from start to finish. I think the spaceship battle was spliced from a 80's video game for the weapons fire, the pull here to disable the threat plot (TR5 Main Control On-Off) device was awesome (needed a blinking neon sign to make it better), and the robotic walking by the terminators was perfect. Apologies to anyone that takes this movie seriously but it was so bad it was great!",1250640000,2,635,4.3
3777045,1,B001RL8WXI,"I knew going into this that it wouldn't be a great movie. I expected a B-movie but instead was 'treated' to a D-movie. Honestly, I had high hope with the decent cast and cool looking cover (though all they do is clone the same robot image over and over). Very misleading though. What I got was nonsensical action, a choppy plot, aweful story and fairly bad acting. The special effect make Ray Harryhausen""s work look smooth and refined.

I wish I could find some redeeming qualities but I can't.  It is a poor attempt to cash in on current hot trends and Terminator: Salvation which just came out. If I can keep you from wasting 90 minutes of your life and $5, then I'll have done you a service that I wish someone had done for me. Avoid!",1243382400,3,738,4.340579710144928
3777046,2,B001RL8WXI,"Terminators is the latest in Asylum's fanfiction line of `everyone else is doing it, why can't we' movies. The plot is part Battlestar Galactica (the android at the end is a Cylon) and part Terminator. They got a weightlifter to run around and be a killing android monster. There are supposed to be hundreds of these things, and I can almost buy they all look like the same guy but why are they all dressed exactly the same? The `acting' in this movie is bad, but so is the plot, the script and the directing, so why be picky? The special effects have picked up a bit from Asylum's early days, which isn't saying a lot. They still could be a lot worse.

The ending really left a bad taste in my mouth, to be honest. I can forgive a lot about a movie if the end at least makes sense, but this one is left me scratching my head. Who is a robot and who isn't? Why does.... Well, I can't say that without giving away the end, but the way the main robot is defeated doesn't really make sense.

Look, it's obviously a cheesy D rate movie. Have your eyes open going in. I always get a little peeved at the reviewers that snark ""THIS WAS THE WORST MOVIE EVER"", I mean, looking at it, you know it's not Oscar material. But if you are looking for a very cheesy movie to enjoy with a few friends, and a few adult beverages, it is a fun choice. Still expect to laugh, not be dazzled with sci-fi greatness.",1241308800,21,1393,4.174721189591078
3777047,3,B001RL8WXI,"Theasylum has done it again with a great cast: Jeremy London,A Martinez and Paul Logan.
Terminators is solid sci-fi action and pulls no punches in any respect.
The characters are natural,and never let us down as far as a moving plot goes.
Paul Logan(Ballistica) as our AHNULD robot is fitting and carries the menace thru-out.
Jeremy London(7th Heaven) comes into picture late,But really saves the day with a spiffy rifle and tech knowledge that brings more science  into The fiction plot.
A Martinez(One Life To Live),Where have you been ? Does this journeyman hero turn with a secret. Lots of violence by Logan,And some great effects in outer space.",1240876800,3,650,4.963302752293578

8338192,3,B001RL8WXI,"One cannot watch a low budget movie and expect Academy Award winning material. Compared to a lot of resent independent films Ive watched lately, I think acting, directing, filming, writing and special effects in The Terminators are surprisingly good. If the ending was less confusing, I would have given this movie 4 stars. Spoiler Alert: I've got to say the TR5 Main Control switch was very unspectacular",1467849600,,405,5.059701492537314

8338197,4,B001RL8WXI,"This film has been unfairly derided by people trying to measure it against Arnold Schwarzenegger's legendary Terminator movies. If that is to be the measure, then nearly all other sci-fi movies will get one or two stars. This film, The Terminators, is fun to watch. It has some good visuals, and the story-line holds together quite well. It is worth your time.",1382918400,,360,4.82258064516129
8338198,1,B001RL8WXI,"This is basically a movie about everybody in the world running away from one muscle-bound guy in a wife-beater shirt. Unbelievably bad dialogue, ""special effects""--even lighting. In one scene, with almost everyone dead, the survivors stumble through rough country in a desperate search for safety and transportation--but in the background, I glimpsed a freeway with traffic streaming by at a normal pace... I'm about two-thirds of the way through this film right now; and there are no ""Terminator robots"" as pictured on the packaging. It's this one muscle-bound ""Terminator,"" multiplied; and every once in a while, he's shown bloodied up; and Makeup's painted steely robot-features on an arm or hand. Ridiculous. I'm sorry for whatever circumstance led an actor of A Martinez's calibre to do a film like this.",1370390400,2,809,5.27906976744186
8338199,1,B001RL8WXI,"Ugh! The first 10 minutes of dialogue is like watching a bad high school.play. Most of the ""actors"" in this movie watched other bad actors, and emulated them here. You will just crack up at the scenes where they are trying to be serious and say to yourself ""can I sit through the rest of this joke?""
I only.made it through 30 minutes. If you're hard up and desparate to watch any old Sci-Fi flick; good luck.",1369267200,,408,4.311688311688312
