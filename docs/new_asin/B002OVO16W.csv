8376452,4,B002OVO16W,Great seasonal music for anyone to enjoy. A performance from Chanticleer can always be expected to please and this is no exceptiong. Love this group and all their musical performances.,1359417600,,184,5.166666666666667
8376453,1,B002OVO16W,"the music was not popular songs, most were music I had never heard before, I would not buy this again.",1262822400,,102,4.15
8376454,2,B002OVO16W,"This is in no way up to the standards of the groups previous DVD releases.  This is music that most Chanticleer fans already own...and yes, the music is sublime... but be aware that the video is an hour-long movie of three logs burning.  Gimme a break!  Better still, give yourself a break and buy the CD.  Just to recap... audio is awesome... video is of interest mostly to pyromaniacs.",1260489600,6,387,4.565217391304348
8376455,5,B002OVO16W,The perfect thing for the Spare the Air days... a crackling fire to look at and the superb voices of Chanticleer.  Lifts the spirits and warms the toes!,1260403200,2,152,4.428571428571429
8376456,5,B002OVO16W,"Beautiful music?  Never out of style.  Music by Chanticleer?  Like fine wine.  It just keeps getting better.
This essential choral collection forces you to savor the beauty of the holidays.  Put your feet up, pour yourself a glass of your favorite something and prepare yourself for pure beauty in sound.  Chanticleer would never attach themselves to anything banal and this album is no exception.  These are holiday chestnuts --- but not ""chestnuts roasting on an open fire.""  There are many beautiful moments here to be savored.  In a sea of overdone holiday tunes, here is one that is worth adding to any holiday collection.  Satisfying.  Soulful.  Chanticleer.",1260230400,5,664,5.102803738317757
8376457,5,B002OVO16W,"I first saw this on the Today Show...I thought, something different!  I am thrilled you have it-I've spent two shopping trips looking for it.",1260057600,3,141,4.875
8376458,1,B002OVO16W,"I ordered this DVD thinking it would be another perspective of their live performance.  I was disappointed to to see that this is essentially a ""CD"" recording with video of a fireplace.  Don't be fooled, there is no video of actual performance.  I would recommend their other DVD, Christmas with Chanticleer - An Orchestra of Voices, which I would give 5 stars.  Otherwise buy any of their recorded Christmas CD's and listen in front of your own fireplace.  At least you'll feel the warmth of a real fireplace.",1259107200,25,510,4.75
