8619648,3,B009IBFFL6,"If you are person who are expecting to ""read subtitles"" to enjoy this film, DON'T. It is one of THE WORST translation of Japanese to English ever, from basic incorrect spelling and poor sentence structure, and they didn't even name each characters correctly with correct name.

That being said

  1: It was something different. It didn't quite follow ""usual pattern of love/comedy drama"" which was nice.
  2: Only 9 episode of 45 min each.. I am glad, they didn't drag it on.
  3: It is clearly better than 2010 Movie version, the movie version ruined the original series.",1468195200,,572,4.76530612244898
