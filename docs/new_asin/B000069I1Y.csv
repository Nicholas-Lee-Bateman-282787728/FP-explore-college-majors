7965803,1,B000069I1Y,"This so-called gangster movie called ""Rest In Peace Cuervo Jones"" is The Dumbest movie I've ever seen. Bad acting, Bad writing, Bad editing, and of course, VERY BAD ACTORS/ACTRESS
If U Want To See A Real Gangster Movie Like ""Paid In Full"" (By The Way, That Movie is very decent than this movie) DO NOT WASTE YOUR GOOD MONEY ON THIS DUMB... FLICK!",1047427200,2,346,4.507936507936508
7965804,3,B000069I1Y,"The movie is about Cuervo Jones guy that is marked for death by a police officer, who thinks that Cuervo is folling around with his wife. Another storyline featured a killer that killed with pencils. The latter storyline isn't followed as much and slows down the film. Another issue features guys that look exactly the same adn you get confused about who is who. Aside from that the movie is good with an original ending featuring Cuervo.",1045267200,,438,4.701298701298701
