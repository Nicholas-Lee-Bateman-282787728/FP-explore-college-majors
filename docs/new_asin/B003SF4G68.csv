Nor will I ever forget its product -- hands-on work and conceptions of grad school students orginally from Auburn University (Alabama)but lately going global.
It's all about letting people of the community shape homes, public buildings, to their desires & needs, not imposing constructions outsiders think they need - perhaps preserving their communal ties in the long run.
I'll see it again, for sure...",1300060800,7,550,5.261363636363637
