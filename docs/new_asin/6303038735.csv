558596,2,6303038735,"I ordered this directly from Amazon and I was immediately disappointed.  It came in a thin cheap case and appeared to be the same quality as the $1 DVDs you find in the deep discount stores. No menu, it just starts and is a poorly edited black and white film.
  This is advertised as Jane Powell's 2nd film.  Her singing is wonderful and so her acting, except when she starts to cry.  I also liked Ralph Bellamy, Arthur Treacher, and Ruth Tobey. The film has it's cute moments although the plot is thin. It's about a 15 year old girl in a boarding school that thinks that her older sister is a Broadway actress.
  I would recommend it to a Jane Powell or Arthur Treacher fan, but buy one of the cheaper dvds and save your money.",1217635200,14,728,4.2700729927007295
558597,2,6303038735,The movie is cute...long on singing short on plot.  The problem is the poor quality of the DVD...it was not digitally enhanced and it was like watching an old newsreel...skipped and sputtered in spots and was painful to watch.,1214438400,8,226,4.794871794871795
558598,3,6303038735,"This film is comparable to ""Dance Girl Dance"" in that it dealt with themes not usually found in musical offerings. The other common trait is that both feuture Ralph Bellamy, an actor of versatility whose training came from the stock company tour circuit.",1205798400,,254,4.930232558139535
558599,2,6303038735,"Nice early Jane Powell musical. Good cast and very ""delightful to watch. Could be more enjoyable if print was restored.  Not great, but fun.",1197417600,,140,4.833333333333333
558600,3,6303038735,"Fans of the gorgeous Jane Powell will be the ones who'll most enjoy this 1945 musical gem from 'Poverty Row' movie studio Astor Pictures/Hunt Stromberg Productions.  It was Jane Powell's first starring role in a movie, and her promising talent is evident for all to see here.

Powell plays aspiring music student Sherry Williams, who idolizes her older sister Josephine (Constance Moore), a big musical comedy star.  After being encouraged by visiting Broadway producer Arthur Hale (Ralph Bellamy), Sherry plucks up enough courage to visit her sister in the city, and ask about starting in showbusiness.  Imagine her shock when she discovers that Josephine earns her money as burlesque cutie-patootie ""Bubbles Barton""...  Sherry decides to get Josephine out of the burlesque scene by having Arthur bankroll a musical for them both to star in.

There's a fun role for the ever-reliable Arthur Treacher as the trusty butler Jeffers; and the cast also features Louise Beavers and Ruth Tobey.

Here in her very first movie musical, Jane Powell displays the pert, easygoing nature that would endear her to a generation of moviegoers.  There are some snappy musical numbers arranged and performed by the Morton Gould Orchestra (""In a Shower of Stars"", ""Once Upon a Song"", ""Through Your Eyes...To Your Heart"", ""I'm Only Teasin'"").  The following year, Powell would sign a contract with M-G-M and go on to star in a series of legendary movie musicals that are still being enjoyed today (""Two Weeks with Love"", ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"", ""Royal Wedding"").

DELIGHTFULLY DANGEROUS is a very popular and frequent title on the Public Domain video circuit.  This current edition from Alpha Video Classics features a sharp print with good contrast and deep black levels.  The mono sound-mix is distorted and harsh in some parts but the dialogue is easily heard.

(Single-sided, single-layer disc)",1180483200,2,1890,5.198019801980198
558601,4,6303038735,"A very young Jane Powell is the appealing leading lady in DELIGHTFULLY DANGEROUS, in which she plays the younger sister of a brassy showgirl (Constance Moore).  Ralph Bellamy plays the love interest who gets himself entangled with both sisters.  Fans of Powell will be the ones who'll most appreciate this 1945 gem from the 'Poverty Row' film studio Astor Pictures.

The following year, Powell was signed to a contract at M-G-M and began a string of fine musical comedies, commencing with ""Holiday in Mexico"" and culminating in 1955 with ""Hit the Deck"".  Fine support is provided by Morton Gould and his orchestra (musical numbers include ""Once Upon a Song"", ""Through Your Eyes...To Your Heart"" and ""I'm Only Teasin'"")",1149379200,8,718,5.059322033898305
558602,5,6303038735,"This was Jane Powell's second movie following her successful debut in ""Song of the Open Road.""  Morton Gould's original music plus Johann Strauss' timeless classics provide ample melodies for this light hearted musical romp.
In the opening scene, Jane dreams she is performing in concert before a huge audience with Morton Gould and his orchestra.  Jane sings the lilting A SHOWER OF STARS. Jane plays a young girl at a boarding school, whose older sister (Constance Moore) comes to see her in the school's musical. Jane sings the cheerful ONCE UPON A SONG while balancing on a tightrope holding an umbrella.  Her sister's escort (Melvin Douglas) is a theatrical agent who immediately becomes interested in little sister's talent.  Jane is devastated when she learns that her sister's big Broadway  show is actually a burlesque review.  (Constance sings TEASIN'). The complications that follow take some careful undoing.
A highlight of the film takes place in a beautiful garden restaurant where Jane sings the enchanting THROUGH YOUR EYES TO YOUR HEART accompanied by Mr. Gould and his orchestra  Her lyrical voice lends itself well to the artfully crafted songs of the film.
The talents of the two sisters are united for the film's finale with a lavish production called ""Mr. Strauss Goes to Town"" alternating classical numbers with pop.  A full orchestra, chorus and elaborate staging make this a memorable conclusion.  Five stars for the musical numbers.",970531200,20,1458,5.170212765957447

558723,4,6303038735,"The incredible vocal talents of Constance Moore and Jane Powell drew my attention to this gem on Amazon streaming, and even though it's an old black & white with the usual inherent issues, the storyline is strong, and moves along at a decent contemporary pace with enough conflict to retain my interest clear to the end.
Don't dismiss all musicals of that era as simple lighthearted fare, Ralph Bellamy plays his usual likeable character with typical frustration, and manages to redeem the character of men in general while doing so, but the finale steals the show!",1402617600,,565,4.895833333333333

558727,2,6303038735,"I only watched about 10 minutes of this movie and got tired of it right away.  Too much mindless chatter and characters were not believable enough.

558771,5,6303038735,Jane Powell is an American treasure!  I think she must be all of 15 in this film but she has the presence and voice of a seasoned pro.  The story is a little silly and I would have loved to see more of Louise Beavers.  But the opportunities to hear Jane Powell sing outweigh the faults.  I suppose I'm naive but I think sometimes its nice to see a film that's delightful.,1369872000,,371,4.111111111111111

558774,3,6303038735,"Just got this DVD from AMAZON today. The 18 year old Jane Powell was cute as a button (and now, at age 79, she's probably STILL cute as a button. The movie was nice, but Constance Moore -- who played Powell's sister in this movie -- was a little too old and a bit loose-skinned -- for a dancer. The price was low and Reel Enterprise -- who probably converted this to DVD probably did not have a good original.  There was junk on the screem, vertical black lines and a constant RE watermark on the screen. Worth the cost?  The movie: yes.  The actual video:  Probably.  But's it's a keeper.  One I will watch every year or so.  Jane Powell has a beautiful voice and is easy to look at,ALWAYS.
