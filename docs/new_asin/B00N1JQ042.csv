6605383,5,B00N1JQ042,"We have written about What Calls The Heart before when we reviewed the first movie from the series. We don't have The Hallmark Channel so we have to wait for the movie to come out on DVD.

The kids were off yesterday so I sat down to watch this beautiful series starring Lori Loughlin from Full House.

The mining town has been trying to rebuild itself since the mining accident took many of the men and life is trying to get back to semblance of normal.

Fans will be happy to see that Elizabeth and her Mounty Jack are taking their relationship to a new level while Elizabeth's younger sister drops into town.

What I love most is how sweet, quiet and lovely this series is. It reminds me of my childhood and the shows that were on TV while I was a child.

This is a show you can watch with your whole family without fear that a curse or slang word will be dropped. There will be no uncomfortable, sexy scenes that you hope are over your kids head while you squirm in your seat waiting for the scene to end. No my friend! This is a lovely show where girls are modest and men are gentlemen. Even when they are thinking of ""courting"" a woman or trying to use her in the case of this particular movie (there is a bad group of thieving men), the scene doesn't take on a despicable overly sexist position and the woman does get the last word with a slap on his cheek.

Thanks Michael Landon Jr and Hallmark for continuing to make family friendly movies and shows that you can watch even if your kids are awake!",1413244800,,1507,4.2334494773519165
6605384,5,B00N1JQ042,"As the series comes to it's close for the first season for When Calls the Heart on the Hallmark Channel, we find our favorite characters on the verge of making some tough choices. In the DVD release of Change of Heart, which includes episode 9 and 10 from the series, we find Elizabeth Thatcher and Jack Thornton finally being able to do what we, the viewers, have been hoping for all along, their first official date and the acknowledgment of those feelings we see just below the surface each time these two find themselves in close proximity of one another. Jack works with Abigail to make preparations to impress Elizabeth and show her just how fond he is of her and to let her know how serious he is about their courtship since their first date took place in the saloon. Jack has definitely stepped up his game and impressed Elizabeth.

But just as Jack believes his personal life is finally moving forward, he receives notice that his request for transfer that he put in when he first arrived in Coal Valley has been approved. Now he is unsure what to do. If he refuses the transfer, it may end his career as constable for the mounties, but if he takes the position, he is unsure how it will impact the courtship he has with Elizabeth and if she will even want to wait for him.

Elizabeth's sister Julie arrives on the stage as a surprise to Elizabeth in hopes of finding out what living out west is truly like. She wasn't planning on finding a wounded man, Nathaniel, in a cabin while out riding, in need of medical attention and secrecy to his condition. He convinces her that he's been trying to get away from being part of the Tolliver Gang that his brother has been forcing him to be a part of. He simply wants a better life away from being a wanted man and trying to start over fresh in hopes of starting a marriage and family if he can find the perfect woman.

Mr Gowan attempts to further his business partnership with Abigail Stanton who runs the cafe in town. Jack tells Abigail that he has discovered that the mining accident that killed most of the men in town, including her husband and son, may not been an accident. It may have been caused by Mr. Gowan cutting a few corners and he hopes to find the evidence to prove it. Abigail takes it upon herself to be the one to do it if she can find a way into Mr. Gowan's office. Soon all three paths will cross and fate may claim more than one life in the process, but it will forever change all of their lives.

I received When Calls the Heart: Change of Heart compliments of Word Films and Edify Media Group for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review and the opinions contained here are strictly my own. This has been one of my favorite shows on the Hallmark Channel this year and I love that it is available on DVD. Michael Landon Jr is executive producer on the series inspired by the novels of Janette Oke and is definitely one the entire family can enjoy together. It inspires us that in the face of adversity, hope can still be found in banding together with family and friends. If you LOVED Little House on the Prairie, I would encourage you to check out this series. For me this one easily claims a 5 out of 5 stars.",1412899200,3,3234,4.358208955223881
6605385,5,B00N1JQ042,"Constable Jack Thornton is finally ready to admit his true feelings for school teacher Elizabeth Thatcher. He approaches her after class with a dinner invitation, making it clear that he is intending this as an act of courtship. Immediately following the invitation, Elizabeth's sister Julie arrives in town with a mountie escort. Jack suddenly finds out that he has been granted another post in response to a request he had put in when he first arrived in Coal Valley. He tries to tell Elizabeth of his transfer at their romantic dinner, but cannot bring himself to tell her. Jack confides in Abigail Stanton about his suspicions that Mr. Gowen is responsible for the mine explosion. Adventurous, dreamy Julie finds an injured man, and secretly takes care of him. Jack finally tells a devastated Elizabeth of his transfer. After Jack leaves town, Julie brings the injured man to Abigail's, where the ladies nurse him back to health. Julie falls for the man, much to Abigail and Elizabeth's concern. On his way to Cape Fullerton, Jack meets up with a group of mounties that are searching for a group of outlaws. When they tell him that they found one of the outlaw's horses near Coal Valley, Jack immediately turns around and rushes back to make sure that Elizabeth is safe. He returns to find that the mountie that had replaced him has discovered that the man that Julie had found is an outlaw. Elizabeth and Julie had been taken hostage by the outlaws, and Jack and Patrick must do some scheming to be able to free the girls and capture the outlaws. Before Jack leaves to escort the men to trial, Abigail gives him a file that she had taken from Gowen's office. Jack promises to try to get an investigator to come to Coal Valley. His last stop in town is a visit to Elizabeth, where he tells her how concerned he had been, and that he cares that she is safe. He leaves her with, ""I'll see you soon."" This dvd includes episodes 9 and 10 of the Hallmark tv series. Would definitely rate this series higher if I could!! :-)",1412553600,11,2022,4.60387811634349

  Rules of Engagement is a very tender, compassionate story.
  Jack and Elizabeth are getting along very well, until  someone from Jacks past comes to town.
  A new character Bill who is investigating the mine cave-in, who is very attentive to Abigail. They work together to expose what happened at the mine.
  Rules of Engagement stops at a cliff hanging scene so I know their will be more and I look forward to it. Really did enjoy this DVD and look forward to the next one.
  Michael Landon Jr. and Hallmark make the best movies. Get this series for your DVD library. It will be well worth your time and money. This is a 5-star DVD. Highly recommended.

6605526,5,B00N1JQ042,"I have been watching What Calls The Heart on Lifetime and love it. What I love most is how sweet, quiet and lovely this series is. It reminds me of my childhood and the shows that were on TV while I was a child.

This is a show you can watch with your whole family without fear that a curse or slang word will be dropped. There will be no uncomfortable, sexy scenes that you hope are over your kids head while you squirm in your seat waiting for the scene to end. No my friend! This is a lovely show where girls are modest and men are gentlemen.

In this episode Rosemary, Jack's ex-fiance is looking to make him hers again and will do what she has to in order to get her man back.  While Elizabeth meets a young man whose educational abilities surprise her so much that pays a visit to his mothers home to tell her how gifted he is (as if a mother wouldn't know). Elizabeth also has a decision to make on her future.  Abagail has her hands full as she and Mr. Avery work on making the mine accountable for the loss of the men of the town.

There is so much going on with this episode that I don't even know where to start so I will leave you with this:

  Jack proves he is a wonderful man with a huge heart.
  Elizabeth knows where she needs to be
  Abagail is stronger than many woman on TV
  Mr. Avery used to be on General Hospital. Hello Frisco.
  and Rosemary needs to get her butt out of dodge!

Thanks Michael Landon Jr and Hallmark for continuing to make family friendly movies and shows that you can watch even if your kids are awake!",1417651200,,1545,4.096666666666667

6605528,5,B00N1JQ042,"No surprise here, we like the series so well we check each episode as you can see!

Janette Oke's engaging novel about a young society woman going West to teach children in a mining town was the inspiration for this series. When you combine her inspirational writing with talented Michael Landon Jr. directorial genuine know how, you discover true family entertainment!

In this latest episode we see new development in Mountie Jack Thornton and Elizabeth's relationship. I found it endearing that both writer and director chose to play it lightly thus providing parents the opportunity to view this DVD with any age children. Rest assured however that this duo knows exactly how to pull the audience in with a winning formula: Engaging characters, great plots, beautiful costumes and colourful scenery.

Judging from my family's reactions, this series is getting better all the time and will surely join the ranks of other families all time favourites such as Little House on the Prairie, thus proving that great directorial skills might well be an 'all in the family' gift!

5 Stars!

6605529,5,B00N1JQ042,"Another feel good, clean DVD in the When Calls the Heart series, Rules of Engagement provided a relaxing evening of entertainment.  My family really likes this series inspired by the best-selling book series by Janette Oke.  There's a nice mix of good guy versus bad guy with hints of romance between Elizabeth, played by Erin Krakow, and Jack, played by Daniel Lissing.  Elizabeth is a teacher. The classroom scenes add interest both in content and in seeing a one room schoolhouse for my homeschooled kids.  There's a bit of jealousy in this film when an old flame shows up in town.  I'll let you watch and see who and how that turns out.  One of my kids mentioned during the film that Elizabeth and Jack should just tell each other how they feel and talk about it.  A good lesson for real life, too.

I received this dvd in exchange for an honest review from Edify Media.",1416614400,7,874,4.522292993630574
6605530,5,B00N1JQ042,"Webster's dictionary defines the meaning of the word engage: as a verb, to mean occupying the attention or interests of a person or persons; to secure for aid, employment, use, hire, etc.; to attract and hold fast; to bind as by pledge, contract, oath or promise; to betroth; and to bring (troops) into conflict; enter into conflict with.

In the DVD When Calls the Heart: Rules of Engagement from the Hallmark Channel and Word Films, all of these definitions apply to the characters we find in Coal Valley as Season 1 comes to a close with the final two episodes of the show. Does true happiness exist for anyone in Coal Valley? That is the question, Elizabeth Thatcher (Erin Krakow) pens in her journal of this DVD. As the town's school teacher of Coal Valley, we find her wondering what the outcome will be for the relationship between her and constable Jack Thornton (Daniel Lissing). Jack is crowned the town's hero for the apprehension of the Toliver gang. Just as Jack returns from Cape Fulton, an unexpected surprises awaits him from the stage. A woman claiming to be Jack's fianc, Rose Mary Levoe, a theater actress from New York. After 2 years of being away from Jack, she realizes she can't live without him and comes looking for him. But love is persistent in her eyes and no matter what Jack tells her, she believes until he conveys his feelings for Elizabeth, hope still awaits in the wings for her.

Inspector Bill Avery (Jack Wagner) arrives from Capital City to investigate the Pacific Northwest Mining accident that claimed the lives of 46 miners six months ago. He is hoping to build a case against the mining company for neglect thanks to the details Abigail Stanton (Lori Loughlin) has provide to Jack. But Mr. Gowen, owner of the mine reminds Abigail that unless she drops the investigation and claims against the mine she might not like what his lawyers will be forced to reveal, one that just might point the fingers at her instead of at the mining company. But Abigail and Mr. Avery will not take to threats from Mr. Gowen or his employees.

Tensions mount as the circuit judge Jedidiah Black (James Brolin) arrives to oversee the case that could spell disaster either way you look at it for the town of Coal Valley. If the mine is responsible, it would mean the mine would close and the men would be out of work and unable to support their families. If Abigail is found responsible, it might mean the end to her cafe in Coal Valley and in the eyes of her friends whose husbands deaths would be on her hands. Will Jack Thornton find a way to reveal his feelings to Elizabeth just as she receives a lucrative offer as the first woman teacher in Briarcliff Teaching Academy back on the East Coast, a true dream job for her? Viewers will just have to wait until Season 2 begins, but until then we can relive all the greatest moments in this DVD series!

I received When Calls the Heart: Rules of Engagement compliments of Word Films, Hallmark Channel and Edify Media Inc for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation aside from a free DVD for my honest review and the opinions expressed here are my own. This DVD is the 6th and final one in Season 1 and includes the TV Series episodes number 11: Rules of Engagement and number twelve: Final Adieu on this one. This is such an exceptional series that families of all ages will come to love as much as The Little House on The Prairie. Micheal Landon Jr. brought author Janette Oke's novels to life and this one for me easily gets a full 5 out of 5 star rating!!!",1416182400,2,3553,4.538221528861154
6605531,5,B00N1JQ042,"This is the episode that many fans have been looking forward to through the entire series. Jack and Elizabeth finally admit to each other (and themselves) that there is an attraction that goes beyond friendship. Of course there are twists and turns throughout the storyline, but these are one of the things that make this series so intriguing to the fans. Julie finds herself attracted to a man who may not be what he seems, and Mr. Gowen is showing an unusual interest in Abigail. As usual, the production qualities are above far, and the story engages the viewers interest...and leaves us wanting more!

DISCLAIMER: I was given the above mentioned DVD for review purposes only from Edify Media.  No monetary compensation was received.  The opinions expressed here are my own.",1414454400,4,777,4.916030534351145
6605532,5,B00N1JQ042,"This soon to be released episode was once more just the ticket for our little family. We have enjoyed this historically accurate rendering of the Canadian frontier particularly because of Michael Landon Jr.'s excellent directorial work and of course Janette Oke's writer skills.
Let me add the now familiar characters of young teacher Elizabeth and Canadian Mounty Jack Thornton emerge as stellar models for any youngster and their sweet story is simply beautiful! Supporting cast such as talented Lori Loughlin who plays the part of widow Abigail Stanton only enhances the whole set up along with beautiful scenery and great costumes.

Faith based, each episode reminds us of the good in people, of what is truly at stake when we relate to others in His name. This Hallmark presentation is definitively 5 stars in our opinion
and I hope you will enjoy it as much as we did.

6605533,5,B00N1JQ042,"When Constable Jack Thornton comes back to Coal Valley from delivering the Tolliver gang to justice, he finds an unwelcome surprise. The stage that had taken Elizabeth Thatcher's sister, Julie, back home, brought his ex-fiance, Rosemary, to Coal Valley, with intentions of marrying him after her 2 year absence. Elizabeth is shocked, having never heard of Jack's previous engagement. Ivestigator Bill Avery arrives in Coal Valley to build a case against the mining company for the mine explosion that had claimed the lives of 46 men.  Rosemary quickly captivates everyone in town, and ignores Jack's polite ways of trying to tell her that their relationship is over. Elizabeth  tries to avoid Jack, but he finally confronts the issue, telling her that he has decided to stay in Coal Valley instead of taking the Cape Fullerton post that he had been offered, saying, ""This is where I belong."" Rosemary, determined to win Jack back, uses all of her charms to do so, leaving Elizabeth feeling like a dull school teacher who doesn't stand a chance against a talented actress. Elizabeth receives an offer for a prestigious teaching position back east, and discusses it with Abigail. Rosemary overhears them, and tells Jack that Elizabeth is leaving Coal Valley. Jack tells Elizabeth that he will support her, whether she decides to stay or go. Elizabeth's class presents her with a card to tell her how much they love her. Elizabeth then reveals to the class that she has decided not to leave Coal Valley. Rosemary finally admits that she has no chance of getting Jack back. Bill Avery brings a judge to Coal Valley to bring judgment against the mining company. Jack takes Elizabeth for a walk, where he finally tells her ""You're the one - you're the ONLY one."" He then asks her not to leave Coal Valley. Elizabeth smiles and places her hand in his with, ""I'm not going anywhere, Jack. This is where I belong."" Jack cautiously steps closer, and the couple finally share their first kiss.  :-) A lovely way to end the first season!!! This dvd contains episodes 11 and 12 of the Hallmark tv series.

The plot was a bit predictable this time, but the acting was so good and the setting so good, we enjoyed it anyway.  It's just a feel good, neighborly kind of cast.  It makes you want to come back again.  I'll be watching any future When Calls the Heart DVDs I get a chance to watch.  I suggest you check this one out.  It's a great film DVD.

My daughter, Amy, said, ""I love these movies. You should watch them. I like them because they're not all yucky romance, they're sweet romance.""",1413331200,6,624,4.228813559322034

  Jack and Elizabeth have become closer and have started a new deeper relationship.
  Julie finds someone to like/love, but is he who she thinks he is?
