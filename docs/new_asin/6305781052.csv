1072310,4,6305781052,"A retired, conservative New York City policeman and a drag queen manage to  overcome some significant barriers between them, to form an alliance for  their mutual benefit in ""Flawless,"" written and directed by Joel  Schumacher.  In his apartment building, Walter Koontz (Robert De Niro)  suffers a stroke while coming to the aid of some neighbors who are trying  to elude a gunman; two people are killed in what turns out to be a matter  concerning some money stolen from a local drug dealer.  Walter ends up with  his right side paralyzed, barely able to walk, and his speech impaired;  which is one of the major obstacles he must learn to overcome.  He is  encouraged to try singing lessons in an effort to learn how to speak again.  To that end, he enlists the help of a neighbor, with whom he had  heretofore been at odds, a drag queen named Rusty Zimmerman (Philip Seymour  Hoffman).  ""Busty Rusty,"" as he is billed at the club where he works, is  saving for a sex-change operation, and can use the extra money, so he  accepts the job.  This leads to an unlikely bond between Walter, a man who  values his independence, and Rusty, a tortured soul who wouldn't wish his  life upon anyone.  Rusty can identify with the sense of isolation Walter is  feeling from being unable to do for himself any longer; he understands his  self-pity, and helps him try to get past it:  ""I've been to that pity-party  myself,"" Rusty tells him.  Meanwhile, the tension throughout the building  remains high; the drug dealer is convinced that his money is being kept by  one of the residents, and the constant presence of his hired goons becomes  a menace to everyone who lives there.  Ultimately Walter and Rusty become  involved in it, which leads to a climax that pointedly illustrates the  magnanimity of the human spirit.  De Niro, as expected, turns in a  sterling performance here; he is so physically convincing, shading Walter's  disability with such finesse, that you forget that this is an actor playing  a role.  There is no De Niro on the screen; this is, in fact, a man named  Walter Koontz.  Hoffman, as well, turns in a brilliant performance, imbuing  Rusty with every nuance; he aptly conveys his subtle anxieties and the  rancor that surrounds him, and with which he must live, every day of his  life.  Skipp Sudduth does a good job, also, as Walter's friend, Tommy, who  must work through his own confusion in dealing with Walter's situation, and  the people with which he now finds him involved; before the stroke, drag  queens were definitely not a part of their immediate circle of friends.  The supporting cast includes Barry Miller (Leonard), Christopher Bauer  (Jacko), Daphne Rubin-Vega (Tia) and Karina Arrovave (Amber).  Schumacher  has deftly crafted a character study that examines diversity and proffers  the rewards of a symbiotic existence.  The message is that no one is  flawless; we're imperfect creatures living together in an imperfect world,  and if we can only get beyond ourselves and our prejudices, we just may  find that gold at the end of the rainbow.  ""Flawless"" is not without it's  own flaws, either; some of the scenes involving the other drag queens and  some of the criminal elements are somewhat overplayed at times, but that's  a minor complaint.  This film is deeply felt without being sentimental, and  sheds some light on the human condition.  It holds up a mirror to all of  us, and asks the flawless among us to step forward.",961891200,8,3468,4.790816326530612
1072311,4,6305781052,"`Flawless' is an offbeat story about Walter Koontz (Robert De Niro) an ex-cop who suffers a stroke and loses partial ability to speak.  In an effort to regain some of his speech capabilities it is recommended to him  that he take singing lessons.  So he decides to ask his neighbor Rusty  (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who is a female impersonator, to give him singing  lessons.  This is an unlikely pairing because Walter is a belligerent  homophobe.
This film was written and directed by Joel Schumacher.  His  story, though peculiar, makes some powerful points.  This is a story about  hatred, bigotry and reconciliation.  Walter learns through his disability  who his friends really are, and who they are not.  It seems that the people  he hates treat him a lot better than the people he thought he loved.  Ultimately, he is able to look past his prejudices to find the human  elements that make him and Rusty not so different after all.
This was an  excellent character study of both main characters, giving a lot of insight  into the motivations and lives of each.  Unfortunately, the story meanders  too often to irrelevant characters and scenes that don't really contribute  much (like the Gay Republicans).  Schumacher would have been better to  concentrate on the relationship between Walter and Rusty rather than  digressing so frequently into Rusty's relationships with his friends.
De  Niro was outstanding in this film.  Not only was he excellent in the  emotional portrayal of a man having to deal with a sudden debilitating  stroke, but he was very realistic in his portrayal of the physical  disability itself.  The combination of his struggles to do the simplest of  tasks and the obvious look of anguish and frustration on his face was  poignant and affecting.
Hoffman brought a lot of emotional energy to his  part, and his imitation of a drag queen was passable, though somewhat  forced and unnatural.  Wilson Jermaine Heredia, who played Cha-Cha, the  winner of the Flawless contest, was a much more convincing queen.
I rated  this film a 7/10.  This is a good film that helps us understand that the  remedy for the fear wrought of our differences is understanding, not  hatred.  In that respect it makes an important contribution.  If cross  dressing and blatantly gay themes put you off, perhaps you should defy your  inclinations and see it.",958348800,67,2362,4.943589743589744
1072312,4,6305781052,"The tone of this film is pretty difficult to nail down. Some scenes are played to be genuinely touching, others seem purposefully maudlin, and still others are Jarmusch-like in their comedic detachment from the rest of  the movie.
From scene to scene, you never really know where the movie is  trying to lead you from an emotional point of view, but you can usually see  where it's going plotwise: DeNiro's character (very) gradually learning to  accept Hoffman's, while a sleazy crimeboss tries to recover his  money.
This movie is like two movies in one, and some viewers will like  one part of it, and others will prefer the other. The problem is that the  intertwining of these two ""separate"" movies does not necessarily  result in a single good movie.
But maybe Joel Schumacher, the director,  was being more subtle than I am giving him credit for: maybe by mixing the  two genres of ""heart-wrenching melodrama"" with ""where's the  money"", he was suggesting a parallel between his plot and his two main  characters, one a gun-toting former security guard, the other a drag queen.  Again, maybe that's reading too much into it, but it seems possible.
A  lot of people seem not very impressed with DeNiro in this film. His  performance is, I guess, an average one, and maybe the fact that you don't  really expect ""just average"" from him is what makes it seem a  little worse than it is. He's certainly not difficult to watch, and I'm  sure he got the mannerisms of stroke victims just right, but there isn't a  lot of range or depth in his performance. (Perhaps that's impossible to  avoid? It's hard to say.)
Phillip Seymour Hoffman, however, is amazing.  You can really appreciate his performance in this film if you've seen him  in something else: Magnolia, Happiness, or Boogie Nights, for example. He's  great in all of those, but his role in this film is in such stark contrast  to those other films that you can't help but be amazed by his range.  Compare the scenes in which he first takes on the thugs to the one where he  discusses a recently-deceased relative. He nails both of them, and keeps  his character consistent. You can't ask for more than that.
Even though  the basic plot is outlandish, you can suspend your disbelief through most  of it, until the end, when it turns into Rear Window versus a cheap slasher  film. You'll see what I mean if you get that far.
One other performance I  thought was excellent that nobody else has mentioned, was that of Daphne  Rubin-Vega, a Tony Award-nominated actress who is relatively new to movies.  Her role is small, but she owns it. Her shift from disenchantment to  enchantment is really a pleasure to watch. You see her whole story in her  face before she even says a word.
Since this is a review of the DVD, I'll  just say that the picture quality is more than acceptable, and some of the  darker scenes look great. There are virtually no extras (just the trailer,  I think).
So the bottom line: Is the film worth seeing? Sure, especially  if you're a PS Hoffman fan. But, be warned, you need to go with the flow  when it comes to the emotional tone of the film.",957830400,5,3128,4.606170598911071
1072313,5,6305781052,"No, this isn't a perfect movie.  No, it won't change any small minds.  Yes, it is a fantastic ode to friendship and heroism of many kinds.  Though this movie has none of the heavy-handedness of message movies, it has two  very clear messages:  friendship comes through seeing similarities not  differences and sometimes it takes heroism just to live your daily  life.
Phillip Seymour Hoffman is a revelation in this movie.  Robert De  Niro is impeccable.  Even Barry Miller (remember him from Fame?) does a  great job in what should be a throwaway role as the devious hotel  clerk.
But there is more going on here than amazing performances.  Rusty,  Hoffman's character, frequently calls on great divas of film ""Okay,  baby, Michelle Pfeiffer going after a Dangerous Mind,"" for courage.  It was supremely fitting that he mentioned Grace Kelly in Rear Window when  he has to climb the balcony fire escape.  Not only is Rusty, like Lisa,  trying to prove herself to her man, Schumacher is drawing a great parallel  between the two films, both essays on the idea that the loneliest place is  in a crowd.  Both films take place in New York apartment complexes where  people spy on each other through windows and live in constant  dis/connection with their neighbors' lives.  Both films examine the most  horrible fate - being alone.  And though Flawless lacks the tension and  artistic beauty of Rear Window, its resolution is even more fulfilling.  It  may be trite, but it is true - Stick Together.
Watch this movie for the  acting, the incredibly sharp dialog, the longing behind these lonely  characters' eyes, and the final triumph of these two unlikely  companions.
Oh yes, and if you are gay (or just happen to have a gay  person's wit), get out your pen and paper.  Those one-liners are  unbelievable.",957312000,10,1805,4.841584158415841
1072314,2,6305781052,"One thing is for certain...one day in the distant future, whenthis film is revived in some obscure gay theater, Robert DeNiro WILLroll over in his grave. This film may possibly qualify as one of the pantheon of ""so bad it's actually funny"" movies, but I'm not entirely certain about that. Give it another five years on video to really let the bad performances, bad writing, bad direction, and bad concepts start to ferment. This film was clearly written by a Screaming (untalented) queen, if not directed by one. How DeNiro got roped into this is a mystery only some Far Eastern Oracle could ever hope to answer. I think he did it because he lost a poker bet with somebody. As it is, he should be hung with a feather boa for this celluloid transgression. I dare not guess at Phillip Seymour-T's reason. This was not drama, because it was too improbable and campy. This was not satire, because how do you satirize drag queens? They are already larger than life.  This was definitely comedy, at the very end. But I don't think the film started out that way, and that's a very scary thought, indeed. Rent or buy this only if you, yourself, are a drag queen(in which case you'll love it) or if you hate Robert DeNiro and really wish to see him in the throes of a totally embarrassing career move (in which case you'll REALLY love it).",957139200,5,1330,4.518672199170124
1072315,3,6305781052,"I enjoyed watching this movie, in the sense that it moves along, and for Phillip Seymour Hoffman's performance (he was better than I have ever seen him). Then again, he got the good lines, and because De Niro, playing a cop  who has had a stroke, can barely speak, he works double time for both of  them. Unfortunately, other than that, and the gracious way Robert De Niro  lets himself be upstaged consistently by Hoffman, there is little here of  interest and not much reality.  Were they going for ""La Cage aux  Folles""?  See that instead--the origional.
 Seeing two people work  out their oppositional attitudes is always interesting, but this movie is  top heavy and out of balance-- and the deck is stacked against De Niro. His  performances should always be perfect--isn't that what we expect?  He  doesn't seem to be ""into"" this as an actor. It's puzzling.  Perhaps he was trying something ""new"" again. What the heck is  going on with him?
  It's sort of cute, in parts, but not terribly real,  I am afraid.  Fun if you want to see a lot of drag queens yelling at gay  republicans... that was my favorite scene.  Dressed outrageously in full  drag, the ""ladies"" really gave it to these poor suited up guys  who are half out, half in the closet, concerning the annual Gay Pride  Parade in New York City.  Is this something that really happened?  I have  no clue.  Amusing to watch however. Very huffy. Sorry if this sounds  politcally incorrect.  It may well be, but it's the movie's problem, not  mine.
The subplot, concerning hidden drug money, is sloppily handled. The  ending is entertaining, however, and of course, love and acceptance of  other people's differences conquers all.",956793600,2,1692,4.743944636678201
1072316,5,6305781052,"As usual, DeNiro gives a fine performance. Outstanding is Philip Seymour Hoffman as a drag queen. The movie teaches us not to judge others too quickly.

1072579,5,6305781052,"The story line of people learning to overcome their pre-conceived ideas about each other to forge new relationships and a new sense of community is solid. I didn't feel that any of the scenes were extraneous - they showed Walt's life and his friends, Miss Rusty's life and her friends, and the events that caused their lives to collide.  There wasn't a bad bit of acting in the whole movie.

But what set my little Rent-head heart aflutter were Daphne Rubin-Vega (the original Broadway Mimi Marquez) and Wilson Jermaine Heredia (Angel Dumott Schunard of both stage and screen).  Especially Wilson.

Daphne gives a good performance as Tia.  When we first meet her she is sweet on Walt (DeNiro) while Walt only has eyes for Karen (Wanda De Jesus).

Wilson is fabulous as Miss Cha-Cha.  This role is not merely Angel 2.0.  As with Angel, Cha-Cha's style (with the possible exception of Cha-Cha's pageant look...which gives a nod to the Rent fandom) does not involve changing Wilson's body shape through things such as padding or cinching and that's where the resemblance ends.  Cha-Cha is sweet, flirty, frequently dressed in shorts with tight or midriff baring tops, absolutely rocks the boy-short bleached hair, and she's sweet on Walt.  Cha-Cha's interactions with Walt are major indicators of how Walt's attitudes (and world) are changing.  This is a performance to not miss out on.",1494374400,,1383,4.969565217391304

They are both such wonderful actors.  They both did a great job with their characters in this film.  It's amazing watching this film from 1999.  So much has changed in society since then.  But it was great to see that friendship can happen even between people who are very different.

Keep in mind that a central part of the movie is that Robert de Niro's character had a stroke.  As such, he is difficult to understand.  I would recommend that you turn on closed captioning.

A sad, almost derelict NY City cop (DeNiro) nearing the end of his service is shot, barely survives, and his recovery is strangely helped along by his transvestite neighbor, the only person who exhibits any altruistic interest in his well-being.  DeNiro's character of course is disgusted at first by this odd neighbor, but throughout the story he begins to understand the neighbor as a human being.  Abandoned by his fellow cops, his daughter, and society in general, DeNiro's character breaks through prejudices to arrive at a concept of self-sacrificing love and tolerance.  A really good morality tale, as well as an excellent psychological study.",1461024000,,767,5.112

1074795,5,6305781052,"I watched this movie because it had De Niro in it and I had never seen a movie that I didn't like that had him in it. After it first got going I was beginning to think I was not going to like it because of all the profanity in it. But then I got to thinking about the kind of characters that was playing--a bunch of thugs and criminals. So that kind of language would have been second nature to them and without it then the movie would not have been very realistic.

I am not a prestigious person because I was a nurse for over 30 years and worked with and had patients from all walks of life--different races and different genders, so the transvestite part of the story didn't bother me. I love all types of people. When it comes down to it, we are all human and people with the same feelings.

It was nice to see Walter (De Niro) slowly loose his prejudices  and discover that his perception of people were all wrong. I loved what a good part that Philip Seymour Hoffman played as Rusty, the transvestite--I think he did a very good job of acting. As a nurse, I also thought that De Niro played the part of a stroke patient very realistically. The only thing that puzzled me about the movie was that no one ever mentioned if Walter had any family, and if so, where were they when he really needed them? I was also surprised that a retired cop would live in such a dump--didn't cops get enough pension to live better than that?

The end of the movie was a surprise and I thought was very climatic! I loved the end! It could not have ended any better.",1457395200,,1551,4.177257525083612

When the once highly decorated police officer Walter Koontz [Robert De Niro] suffers a stroke while attempting to aid a neighbour, an unorthodox form of therapy is prescribed to help him overcome a resulting speech impediment. The suggested therapy becomes even unorthodox when Walter asks his neighbour, Rusty [Philip Seymour Hoffman], a flamboyant drag queen with musical talent and the past recipient of Walters ire, for help. The unlikely arrangement soon mellows Walter into a grudging friendship in writer/director Joel Shumachers Flawless, which features supporting performances from Wilson Jermaine Heredia [Rent], Barry Miller [Saturday Night Fever and The Last Temptation of Christ] and Chris Bauer [Face/Off and TVs True Blood].

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Joel Schumachers Flawless potentially could be real disastrous film, but like a butterfly turns into a totally enjoyable and entertaining film and one because of the warmth and humanity of Robert De Niro and Philip Seymour Hoffman, who give the two leading characters something you can believe in. Part of the reason is Philip Seymour Hoffmans late 1990s breakthrough, as one of Americas premier character actors. Flawless joins same brilliant genre as The Talented Mr. Ripley and Magnolia in cinemas at the end of 1999 to announce him as a considerable talent working at the height of his powers.

A drag queen [Philip Seymour Hoffman] saving up for a sex change and a stroke victim who happens to be a retired cop are not your average Hollywood heroes. But the performances aren't average either. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Robert De Niro exceed all expectations, which for them are saying something.

Joel Schumacher has made some very disappointing films like [Dying Young and Batman & Robin] and some surprisingly good ones lie [Falling Down and A Time To Kill]. He started life as a costume designer, before becoming a writer for films like [Car Wash and The Wiz] and eventual a director. Style is obviously important to him. He works in the mainstream and yet has an edgy reputation, as if secretly yearning for low-budget independence.

Walter Koontz [Robert De Niro] an ultraconservative, retired security guard lives in a cheap rundown hotel in New York's Lower East Side, in the bad quarter of New York and it is his neighbourhood. He knows everyone and, since his wife passed away, feels comfortable there, except for those gay people in the room upstairs, who make such a racket with their music and nonsense.

One night there are shots and sounds of fighting on the floor above. Walter Koontz takes his gun and goes out to investigate. A drug dealer's heavy mob is tearing the place apart in search for some stolen money. Already, a prostitute has been killed but Walter Koontz who suffers a stroke while trying to help a neighbour in trouble, doesn't make it because he collapses on the stairs from his stroke and is rushed to hospital. He ends up with paralysed vocal cords and in turn refuses to leave his apartment for therapy.

Rusty [Philip Seymour Hoffman] lives in the apartment looking down on Walter Koontz's apartment, where he rehearses his club act with the other girls (guys). He has a sharp tongue, a dazzling wit and a deep desire to become a woman, but beneath the gay repartee and camp high jinks, he is very lonely and sad. Walter Koontz struggles to come to terms with his stroke, agonised by its debilitating effect on his ability to walk and talk. In desperation, he goes to Rusty for singing lessons, and this hard-core conservative policeman is very reluctant to ask for this drag queens help, but in the end realises all negative attitudes on both persons part, will not solve their out spoken views on each other.

Rusty confides to Walter Koontz that he has hidden the gangsters' money in a dressmaker's dummy so he can now afford a sex-change operation. Walter Koontz recovers sufficiently to dance at his regular bar with a hostess whom he had previously snubbed. That night, hearing Rusty being beaten by the thugs, who suspects him of having their money, he finally intervenes. Walter Koontz and Rusty fight off their thug attackers and shoots them, but Walter Koontz is wounded and is rushed off to the hospital and Rusty gets into the ambulance and does a good deed, but that is you will have to watch the Blu-ray disc, as it will spoil the ending.

Flawless is a film that is about performances from two fantastic leading men and no so much about the story or the plot itself. This is a film about how a relationship grows between two very different people, who have opposing stereotypical attitude and how they both work together to overcome their very different problems. Robert De Niro is back to his best after some very average films and the acting from Phillip Seymour Hoffman is just totally outstanding and should have received some kind of Award. I have seen Phillip Seymour Hoffman in other films such as Boogie Nights and Magnolia and was impressed then, but this is definitely his best to date. I have always loved this film 100% ever since I had the inferior quality NTSC DVD and I think you will to. Dont miss out, go out and purchase this Blu-ray disc, you will not be disappointed.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The films theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1 is faithfully rendered in this beautiful 1080p transfer. Sharpness is  very good, compared to my inferior NTSC DVD, except when focus is deliberately distorted for physiological effects. Colours are likewise well rendered with believable skin tones and nice detail in hair and clothes in close-ups. Black levels are good to fair due to some inconsistencies in the contrast applied to the imagery, and there are occasional bits of dirt and dust that can be momentarily distracting. But despite some slight negative anomalies, it is still good for a film that was released in 1999.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound mix doesnt get the most out of the New York City locations remaining mostly front centric, apart from occasional music cues in the drag club and Robert De Niros dance club. Dialogue has been nicely recorded and exists in the centre channel. There are no problems with hiss or any other aural anomalies. But due to some quiet moments in the film, I had to turn up my volume, especially when Robert De Niro was mumbling at the start of the film after his stroke, when he was talking to Phillip Seymour Hoffman, but despite this Olive Films has made a good effort.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Theatrical Trailer [1999] [1080i] [16:9] 2:28] This is the original trailer for Flawless.

Finally, Robert De Niro and Philip Seymour Hoffman remain the best reasons to check out this 1999's culture-clash drama Flawless. Flawless to me really gripped my heart, as it was intended to do, as it is a definite rollercoaster ride of emotions. The main actors do a brilliant fine performances with the material at hand, but the script could of done a needed far more fleshing out in order to truly become something memorable, but despite this, I love this film and so pleased it was released onto the Blu-ray disc, as it was well worth the wait. Fans of the main stars, as well as the other actors, can enjoy a well above average Blu-ray rendering of this film and despite its gay theme, it will bring a joy to your melting heart, especially with all the stunning acting performance. If you haven't seen this film, then I think it is well worth picking up. I can see myself revisiting it in the near future again and definitely showing it to my friends, who may be similarly unaware of its existence. Highly Recommended!

1075145,5,6305781052,"In this surprisingly delightful film we meet Walter Koontz (De Niro) who plays a police officer / hero who has a stroke which partially paralyzes his one side. He loses his ability to speak and it is recommended that he take singing lessons. After trying to leave the building and realizing that it will most likely to be easier to do this in his own building, he calls upon his neighbor Rusty (Hoffman) who is a drag queen / female impersonator to help him. What you learn in the first few moments of this film is that Walter hates gays and is a terrible rude homophobe and Rusty is equally unforgiving in his insults at the ex-cop.

They hate each other and that is what sets this story to be a wonderful character study, and ultimately, a story of friendship, tolerance, compassion and understanding. As the film unfolds, Walter realizes who his true friends are (and are not) and Rusty shares his life in a way that Walter realizes that lifestyle choice or sexuality does not make a person that different after all. He begins to move past his prejudices to see the common ground between them and begins to care deeply for his new friend building mutual respect. Rusty is a caretaker, and seems to be the mother/father figure of many friends and genuinely cares for Walter, and gives from the heart. The story is touching as their relationship grows. Of course, this is also a ""cop film"" with action aspects. The local drug dealer is after someone who stole his money and believes it is hidden in the building, so a side story is playing out where he is terrorizing the other tenants in the building.

I felt that the film would have been complete in just the relationship between Walter and Rusty, but director Schumacher wove in many different elements which also framed the story, but also distracted from it at times. Hoffman played the queen very well and had lots of passion for the part and De Niro was brilliant as the victim of a stroke. He is excellent in playing roles with any sort of disability or impediment and this role was very believable and affecting.",1422230400,,2073,4.584905660377358

Even with high expectations, I was completely blown away by this movie, and especially the performances of Philip Seymour Hoffman and Robert DeNiro.  And that is saying a lot, considering that these talented actors are right at the top among their peers during the last twenty years or so.

I loved the movie, the way the characters were written, and the transformation that occurs between them.  As they get to know each other, the outer appearances and bigotry disappear, and they become true friends....almost ""sisters"".  When you watch the movie, you'll understand the reference to them being ""sisters"" (in quotations).  I won't say anymore, except that this movie is a gem, and I highly recommend it to anyone.  There is plenty of humor and drama, and the characters are very sympathetic.

I watched ""Flawless"" via instant video rental, and would like to purchase the DVD, but apparently it is now out of print.  The only copies available are from marketplace sellers, starting at almost $50.00 for a used copy.

Seymour Hoffman talked about how he found the personna of Rusty, the drag queen. He read all he could, and he met with several transgendered women. He studied their habits. He was a 5ft 10 in 200 lb man with a very deep voice trying to fit into the body of a female. Watching the film, you forget this is a man, Seymour Hoffman, he has become Rusty, and that was his greatness. He became the character. Although he concluded that Rusty was ugly, not to me. She became a woman with soul and guts, someone looking for love.

Learning to sing would help in his recovery, and he hires Rusty. It begins as a rocky relationship and ends up as friendship. This is a poignant film with a wacky charm.

We will not see the likes of Phillip Seymour Hoffman again, what a sad, sad day. Bless his soul.

1075834,4,6305781052,"Don't miss this movie because of the reviews. Watching Phillip Syemour Hoffman is worth your time!  The story isn't Perfect, but it's definitely believable.

Phillip Seymour Hoffman was, as the title says, Flawless in his performance as a drag queen hoping to afford a transsexual operation in order to become the woman (s)he truly is inside.  The range of emotion demanded of Hoffman's portrayal shows his acting to perfection. I kept forgetting it was Hoffman, and sympathized with the character, Rusty - to my mind a definite indicator of an actor disappearing into the character.

Unfortunately, Robert DeNiro, one of my favorite actors, just couldn't do the necessary facial contortions and vocalizations to convince me of a stroke victim. Perhaps, his portrayal IS the way a stroke victim really is, but it doesn't reach me on a visceral level that allows his struggle to elicit my sympathy for him. I'm so involved in watching him work/act, I can't see his character.

The drag queens worked it to perfection, while the cops didn't seem to be vested in their portrayals.  --- watch it and judge for yourself.

1075904,2,6305781052,"I say that for the sheer fact that I'm torn as to how I really feel about it.  The concept and the actual execution are far removed from one another and create a divided feeling.  I don't even know how to review this movie.  Where do I start?  The bad or the good?

Eh, we'll start with the plot.  You have a homophobe who is rather rude and still seemingly suave or whatever named Walt.  He's an ex-cop, former hero, living in a slum-like apartment who sleeps with a whore although he considers her a lady and for some reason that validates him paying her for sex.  He lives in the same building as Rusty, a drag queen who does live performances with his friends and sings rather loudly and flamboyantly in his apartment.  When some thugs get their money stolen by some prostitutes who happen to live in Walt's apartment building, he tries to play hero and winds up having a stroke and is now paralyzed to an extent and needs therapy.  At wits end and near suicide, he concedes with therapeutic advice and decides to get singing lessons to help with his slurred speech.  Ashamed to have others see him, he asks Rusty for his help since he basically views Rusty as beneath him.  Rusty, saving for surgery to change him into a woman, needs to cash.  While they start off on odds, they form an odd friendship and both grow because of it.

Yada-yada.

Ok, so as a story, I like it.  It has a lot of promise, and parts of the script are really moving.  That said, the portrayal of Rusty and his drag queen friends is rather one-note and insulting and they convoluted gangster scenario leads to redundant sequences that take you out of the film.  The final action scene in particular is a mess and shouldn't have been in the film at all.  I also take issue with Philip Seymour Hoffman's atrocious performance.  I am a person who considers him one of our finest actors and have supported him for years despite accusations of him being a total ham on screen.  I love his 90's work and consider him to be a fantastic actor with under-appreciated range.  This particular performance is dreadful.  I mean, a true embarrassment.  His mannerisms are so clich and over-exaggerated and his awful speech is beyond annoying.  I understand he is playing a character, but he came across as one who has no idea of how to play this character, and with Hoffman's obvious flamboyancy you'd think he would have nailed this one.  The script doesn't help much, since it gives Hoffman some of the worst dialog in screen history.

Yet, I actually felt that Robert De Niro delivered a stunning performance that wasn't only technically great but one that was emotionally stirring, and he handles his arc to perfection.  He also isn't saddled with god-awful dialog, so that is a plus, but he also builds a character far more effectively than Hoffman.

UGH, so I'm torn, but obviously leaning more on the side of `this film is a disaster' since outside of the concept and De Niro the film really is.  Leave it to Joel Schumacher to mess something like this up!",1345766400,,3029,4.524861878453039

DeNiro is particularly affecting as the ex-cop who suffers a stroke and must consequently struggle to rebuild his life. Being an American movie the script of course follows predictable character arcs and has exactly the kind of ""redemption"" storyline whereby we can accurately predict plot movements after the first fifteen minutes. There are no surprises, but the quality of the acting makes this a must-watch item. DeNiro is truly excellent with his under-stated performance and the direction is equally under-stated, which results in a well-paced unfolding of events.

Being a Hollywood movie there of course has to be a love story sub-plot, and whereas the script was reasonably true to life with regards to the protagonist's development of friendships with his voice coach drag queen and his former colleagues, it's unrealistic from the moment when the ""hooker with the heart of gold"" imposes herself into his life. As the voice coach observes early in the movie, ""there's no romance without finance"" but according to Hollywood - and presumably based on countless viewer feedback surveys - we expect romance without finance and therefore that's what we'll get. Basically there's no escaping the Hollywood machine, but if you can ignore the contrived plot and the hackneyed themes, this is a great movie because of the riveting performances and the deftly handled direction.",1300492800,3,1550,5.296747967479675

He then receives singing lessons from his upstairs drag queen neighbor to help him with his speech. The bulk of the story deals with thugs looking for money that someone in the cop's and drag queen's building stole.
 ""Flawless"" is a cute comedy/drama and what makes the film so memorable are the amazing performances by its leads. However, Phillip Seymour Hoffman steals the picture from DeNiro with his intense and convincing portrayal of a drag queen. Everything from Hoffman's facial expressions to his voice to his mannerisms makes the viewer think they are really watching a real-life drag performer on the screen. Hoffman's portrayal is one of the best I have ever witnessed.
 The movie has been pretty much forgotten by its gay audience that it was targeted for. This is obvious as the film is now out-of-print and Amazon has none in stock.

In this movie, all the same threads are still there. One can imagine that they young Taxi Driver has become a cop (because he liked guns and he is straightforward and a vigilante in Txi Driver). It also sounds as if he is still living in the same apartment (see Taxi Driver), and the second half the movie is very similar to Taxi Driver. Here is De Niro the gallant hero up to rescue another Jodie Foster but this time it is Rusty the Drag Queen. Now the question is why would de Niro would do a movie that resembles more or less a ""whatever happened the young taxi driver?"". It seems to me the movie Flawless is telling us that he ended up a cop and won many medals, and he still braving the odds and attacking bad people. except that he has a change of mind about the ""scum of society"". He seems to be more accepting of homosexuals in Flawless and this is a character development that the director of the film wanted us to see compared to Taxi Driver.

5 - I really liked/loved it
4 - I liked it
3 - Could've been better/worth a look
2 - Just didn't live up to the potential
1 - Simply awful

True this film has some (and others would say many) flaws in it, but just about every movie does. One of the biggest would be the whole drug dealer plot. So why do I give this movie 5 stars? For many reasons.

1) I enjoy the performances; DeNiro and Hoffman are superb in their roles and work well off each other. I even like the supporting roles, even if they are over the top at times.

2) I like the main story and theme; how two very different people can connect. Walter and Rusty share one thing in common, lonliness, a desire for companionship (in love and in friendship).

3) I think it's well made, production wise. The music works well and the look of the cinematography gives it a grimey yet hopeful feel. The sets and costumes are also good.

4) And the final reason for the rating is writer/director Joel Schumacher. After his disaster with the Batman films he did, and others people may have not liked, Schumacher has returned to basics with simpler projects. He's wokring his way back up in the film ladder; Phantom of the Opera was his return to the bigger budgeted films, and he did well with that.

1076157,2,6305781052,"What do you get when you cross a stroke-ridden security guard with a flamboyant drag queen?  The punchline is Flawless, one of the low points of the holiday movie season so far. Appropriately for a Thanksgiving release, writer-director Joel Schumacher has served up a big, steamy Butterball with all the trimmings. He should have called this one Shameless.

  After spending most of the decade alternating between bloated Batman sequels and pallid John Grisham adaptations, Schumacher has wisely decided to retrench with  a smaller scale, character-driven drama. The problem is, he's neglected to supply the characters. Robert De Niro stars as security guard Walter Koontz, a neighborhood hero who suffers a stroke while trying to intervene in a drug deal gone awry. As part of his recovery, Walt's physical therapist suggests he take singing lessons. Reluctantly, the homophobic Walt approaches his neighbor Rusty (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a drag performer who keeps a piano in his apartment. Needing money for his eventual sexual reassignment surgery, Rusty agrees to take on Walt as a client.

  No doubt De Niro and Hoffman were both attracted to roles that, on the surface, cry out for major award nominations. But neither of these talented actors is given much to work with beyond superficial showiness. As he did in Awakenings, De Niro nails the technical specifics of his impairment, right down to the muffled, sidelong manner of speech generally associated with stroke victims. But Walt is so ill-defined before he is stricken, pretty much all we know about him is that he's gruff. Hoffman's performance dances around the edges of caricature - hands flitting about, voice dripping with honeyed sarcasm - but his raw emotionalism lends Rusty a depth not provided by the screenplay.

  If Schumacher has ever conjured an authentic moment on screen, I've missed it. Even his best work is convincing only as movie-land fantasy, and Flawless is no exception. Everything that happens is dramatically rigged, worst of all the ongoing drug money subplot, which is about as gritty and believable as an old episode of Police Woman.  It's a sure sign that Schumacher didn't trust his central story to hold an audience's interest.

  In addition to Walt's singing lessons, there are life lessons to be learned, of course - be yourself, let your freak flag fly, and you'll find the people who accept you for what you are. It doesn't hurt that in Walt's case those people happen to include a cute young tango dancer who inexplicably has the hots for a middle-aged, semi-paralyzed ex-security guard. Eventually even Walt's crusty poker buddies bond with his new drag queen pals, although we aren't shown how or why. It's all meant to be very feel-good and life affirming, but the net effect of all these bogus epiphanies is not unlike that of traditional Thanksgiving overindulgence.

1076160,3,6305781052,"The movie was enjoyable and entertaining. I felt that most stereotypes got used a great deal and that the story was a bit strange. De Niro did an excellant job of being an old dog that hates new tricks and hates Gays. His role was believable and his vocal trainer ( Drag Queen ) was totally over the top but since I have known a few that are just as over the top as him, I was able to suspend my disbelief and enjoy the film. The film quality was good and it had some good comic moments. I realize that the message was meant to be deep however I felt the movie was lacking soul. I never got drawn in to the point I forgot it was a movie, not even for a few minutes. It's an enjoyable movie for an evening sitting in front of the tube but not one you would strongly suggest friends rent or see particularly.

Two very special and talented actors hold down the story. DeNiro plays a homophobic cop who is trying to recover from a debilitating stroke; he starts by taking singing lessons from his neighbor, played by the incomparable Philip Seymour Hoffman, a pathetic drag queen who is trying to save up enough money for a sex change operation.
Well. You can imagine the looks DeNiro gives him, the comments, the eye-rolls, as Hoffman vamps or slumps around in a kimono or wig or feathered scarf. Really, really good stuff. You suspect DeNiro will emerge from this encounter as a more tolerant man, and you would be correct - but that's not the end of the tale.
There's another whole plot line about drug deals and stolen money that comes up against the gay community and the drag queens, prostitutes of all three sexes, the cops (both honest and dis) - and when the goons come to call, you fear that these people you've come to care about will come to a sad fate.

1076282,4,6305781052,"To me, the premise of this movie was simple: Pair up two ""misfits"" who need acceptance, and find this acceptance in each other. And it does work, for the most part.
Robert De Niro is a grumpy, homophobic retired cop who is humbled and mortified after a stroke makes him semi-parilyzed, and slurs his speech. He tries to shut himself off from the world, and from his ""old life"" as a cop with a heroic past. The other half of this odd teacm is Philip Seymour Hoffman (who gives an AMAZING performance). He plays an overweight drag queen who obviously has a lot of emotional scar tissue from a life full of rejection and heartbreak. He's a wonderful character--full of funny one-liners and a self-depreciating wit. But underneath his sarcastic humor is a lot of raw pain.
The two start out as antagonistic neighbors, until De Niro is ""desperate"" enough to ask for singing lessons from Hoffman. The singing lessons will help him improve his slurred speech, and Hoffman is an accessable voice teacher--it's just too inconvenient for De Niro to travel any farther in the slippery snow.
So, these two start a tenuous friendship. And we see that they have a lot in common--both feel like rejects. De Niro cannot accept his disability, and feels like his ""old"" life is over. Hoffman just wants to be accepted, and finds that getting some understanding an acceptance from a person like De Niro is an interesting concept. Both need to be understood as they are *now*. And by the end of the film, they both realize that they can have this acceptance.
There's also a sub-plot involving an evil gangster looking to recover his stolen money, but the main point of the film (in my opinion) is in these two main characters, and their ""odd couple"" relationship.
The story is a little flawed; I felt something was missing at the end. The sub-plot with the gangsters was OK, but not that compelling. It was needed to move the story's conflict and drama along, but it wasn't as important as the two main characters.
I really enjoyed this film. The performances were wonderful, and I liked its message--that compassion is something that we all need to give, and to receive. And that we all need to stop being so hard on ourselves, and also on others.",1048982400,6,2228,4.657360406091371
1076283,3,6305781052,"I really, really wanted to like this film. I love Philip Seymour Hoffman, and I love Robert DeNiro even more; however, my passion for those two actors just couldn't carry me through this film happily.
While Hoffman does play a fairly good drag queen, and while DeNiro does a good job portraying a stroke victim, this film is rife with awful stereotypes. Folks who've been in The Family Scene will chuckle at a few good lines and inside jokes, but there will also be substantial groaning at tired old cliches and even more tired old reparte. Gay culture is no longer the hush-hush sub-sub-culture it once was - the straights are onto the lingo for the most part, and stuff that was once Known Only By Gay Folks is common knowledge. Trouble is, this movie seems to think it's all still very mysterious.
Additionally, there are no gay men in this film who are not queens or Gay Republicans in Suits, and the only lesbians (seen for all of perhaps 15 seconds) are large butches. Granted, the film isn't about lesbians, but still - how about giving fair time to non-polarized gay and lesbian folks? What about the outdoorsy, down-to-earth gay guys, or the lesbians that don't have the once-requisite haircut? Let's be real, here, people. A lot of gay folks are Just Folks, too.
The stereotypes don't end at the gay & lesbian folks, though - nope, we also have Skanky Prostitues; Sleazy, Corrupt Desk Clerk of Seedy Apartment Building; Filthy, Brutal Drug Dealer and His Thugs; Hooker with the Heart of Gold; and sundry other people we have all seen before (and have seen done better, too.) Even the several storylines have been done before - take your pick.
Despite all of its faults, however, ""Flawless"" is a fairly enjoyable film (note the three stars, instead of one or two,) largely because Hoffman and DeNiro try to rise above the cliches swarming around them like mosquitos and just play the parts as they felt they should be played. If only the script writers had given them better material, this really could have been entertaining. I'm very fond of Jason Isaacs, who is nearly as sexy in drag as he is out of it. There were a few laugh-out-loud moments, but overall, I was waiting for it to be over, something I seldom feel in movies. Alas.",1030924800,13,2244,4.64070351758794

wasn't only the apperances of those two but the fact that Robert DeNiro-THE Robert Deniro(!)-starred in it and Joel Schumacher directed it. More than anything,I was amazed that  a film with such star power could be released so quietly by a major studio(MGM).
So I finally copped the DVD of ""Flawless"" and let's  just say that it's now no big secret why this film was swept under the rug so quickly.
""Flawless"" is the tale of a retired homophobic cop(DeNiro) who after attempting to save a girl from getting murdered is paralyzed and must take speech thearpy from his much hated,
flamboyant,gay drag queen neighbor(Phillip Seymour Hoffman).
So overall,it seems like this movie is supposed to tackle themes of tolerance and homophobia. But...
The script is not there and ""Flawless"" is anything but.
""Flawless"" comes off very cheesy and unformed. It's a wonder why such a prestigious an actor as DeNiro would work with such a flubbed script. And one can't help but notice the tired,striking gay male sterotypes.(Come on,four ""queens"" singing Slyvester's ""You Make Me Feel Mighty Real""...that's not sterotypical?)I thought this movie was supposed to challenge prejudices about homosexuality.
If that's not all,the movie drags and is rather unintresting in many parts.
The 2 star rating is for DeNiro because I'm a DeNiro fan and he can make even a stunted film like this work at times and because
Phillip Seymour Hoffman gives an entertaining performance as struggling drag queen,Rusty Zimmermann. Plus(as I noted above),
Nashom Benjamin of The Ones does a good performance as Rusty's
drag queen pal,""Amazing Grace"" and I saw that friend I mentioned
too!
Other than that,""Flawless"" is a very FLAWED,mediorce,semi-entertaining film that should be kept under the rug.",1025222400,2,2013,5.042042042042042

This is 1 of the worst films I've ever seen - I'm actually proud of myself for staying awake throughout the whole movie.
I only bought this movie because the bloke I bought it off said he'd sell it to me for a specaial price (He must have seen me coming (I'm a complete muppet) & I don't think he could have sold any copies).
I'm actually thinking of using the dvd as a drinks coster.
It's a [bad,bad,bad] movie, its got 1 hell of a rubish storyline - I cant say this strongly enough it was ""bad"" - If your going to throw your money away throw it in my direction. It's the sort of film I wouldn't even give to my worst enemy.
Robert Deniro usually stars in some great films, I think he must have done this film because he lost some sort of bet or for a laugh or maybe he was fed up of staring in good film & wanted a change.
Heres some advise for Mr Deniro ""READ THE SCRIPT BEFORE YOU SIGN THE CONTRACT""..

The movie is about a homophobic cop who gets a stroke and he takes singing lessons from the drag queen living above him. The drag queen wants to be a ""real woman"" and spares money for the operation. That's not much but there is something that makes the movie so good you'll never forget it.

1076389,4,6305781052,"I rented this video by mistake -- literally.  I had chosen another film but when I got home the wrong film was inside the box.  I had never heard of this 1999 movie but it was starring Robert DeNiro and Philip Seymour Hoffman, who I just seen play a wonderful character role as the writer in State and Main, and so I decided to watch it.
The theme is interesting.  Robert DeNiro plays an aging former security guard who lives in a run-down apartment house peopled by some weird and interesting characters.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is cast as the drag queen across the courtyard who taunts the homophobic DeNiro who amuses himself by paying for women he meets at a sleazy dance hall.
Then DeNiro has a stroke.  When he is released from the hospital his helplessness makes him contemplate suicide.  His physical therapist recommends singing lessons to help his slurred speech.  ""At least you'll be able to have phone sex"" says the therapist.  As Philip Seymour Hoffman is a singing teacher, these two fine actors are thrown together for some excellent scenes.  Usually drag queen characters play comic roles but his is a very serious part, as is DeNiro's.  I understand also that DeNiro visited rehabilitation centers and worked with a physical therapist in order to get the speech and physical problems of a stroke victim correct.  This authenticity comes through in his outstanding acting.  There's much to say in this film about courage and compassion. The chemistry between the two actors make it all very real.
It's too bad that the rest of the film is of the Grade B variety.  There's some silly plot about a drug deal and hidden cash and some bad guy gangster scenes that are overacted and feel like the amateur hour.  There's too many stereotype characters who live in the apartment house.  There are too many subplots. The problem with this film is that it can't decide if its a comedy or a drama.  It's strongest in its dramatic moments but then seems to fade off and become just too busy and distracting.  DeNiro's and Hoffman's performances are so good, however, that it's worth watching just for that. There's much food for thought here and good issues raised about physically challenged people.
So for those of you who don't' necessarily demand  perfection in every video you see, I give this film a modest recommendation.  I know that I enjoyed it in spite of the fact that it was not ""flawless"".",981936000,25,2408,4.717703349282297
1076390,1,6305781052,"I think this is one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune to see...One would think that a film with this amount of potential (in the form of the two leading actors Robert DeNiro and Phillip Seymore Hoffman) that it could eek out an OK film but it is not the case.
I could go on thinking of different ways in which to express my general displeasure regaring this film, but it might be more productive to give specifics
1.  Hoffman is the WORST drag queen I have ever seen on film.  It was as if he was afraid to seem too good at it, thus allowing the public to label him as a closet queen.  He is a much better actor than that (one need only see his work in The Talented Mr. Ripley and Boogie Nights to know that).
2.  DeNiro as a man who has had a stroke...we don't care that he had a stroke, that he grows a person.  One never learns to care about him, thus one does not care about the film.  If it was the case that one is to be a resistant viewer, our lack of carring would be the point.
3.  The subplot of the drug money--only serves to detract from the main story...as the waifish little drug-addicted girl dies in the beginning, we also don't care that she is dead either.  We also don't really feel the depth of the friendship that she is to have had with Hoffman's character.  So, is he only concerned with the drug money that will let him become a woman or does he actually give a darn that she was killed?
If you purchase this film, it is at your own risk.....",978393600,6,1482,4.065292096219931
1076391,2,6305781052,"If this movie had stayed focused on a small, human story of how two very  different people in need reach out to each other, it would've been  gorgeous.  But in its execution, things go so wrong so quickly that I have  to believe the script was only one-eighth written when filming  started.
Philip Seymour Hoffman is very talented and watchable  (interestingly reminding me so much of a woman I know), but that's about  the only good thing I can say.  Robert DeNiro walks through his role, but  that doesn't matter much, since his Walt Koontz is just a stereotype  anyway.  Like many of the other characters, Koontz is so much more a  function of the uninventive plot than any real study of attitude or  behavior.  On the other hand, Rusty's three friends were actually  stereotypes who didn't have any plot function.  They were, it seems, the  road company from ""To Wong Foo"" wandering onto the wrong set.
This to me was the movie's downfall.  I could've even gone along with  the tacked-on subplots if these characters had been more genuine and  complex.  But as it was, Rusty was the all-knowing earth mother (by virtue  of being gay, I guess), Koontz was the bigoted, misogynist white cop (by  virtue of being white and male), all the minorities were fringe people with  criminal tendencies (prostitutes, drug dealers, and thugs), and all the  gays (at cross-purpose, it would appear, with the movie's message) were  childish and self-absorbed.  I was shocked, e.g., when Rusty's friends  reacted to a near-deadly ordeal by pushing to get their own names and faces  on the news report, because one of them just won a gay beauty contest.  You  can't tell me that's not outrageous stereotyping.
Already irritated by  this, I had little patience for the more minor messes in continuity,  purpose, and tone, which I'm going to rant about now.  Why does Tia care  about Koontz?  Why are we supposed to care about him?  What is the point of  Rory Cochrane's character?  Damn it, does Rusty live above Koontz or below  him?  In the final scenes, are we supposed to be anxious for Rusty's safety  or amused that he looks like a Monty Python  housewife?  Why did people  yell at, and thereby warn, their attackers before they shot back?  The  climax would've been resolved much quicker if some basic human instincts  had been brought into play.  And what was that interminable outtake-thing  at the end, followed by the chirpy credits?  It felt like the wrap-up to a  70's comedy show.
All in all, this was a great central idea that very  quickly shot off the tracks.  Philip Seymour Hoffman and Robert DeNiro  should try it again in another movie.",966816000,3,2643,4.740576496674057
1076392,5,6305781052,"This film is a fine blend of superior acting and great humor about subject matter that could, in less capable hands, be tragic or worse yet, maudlin.  Joel Schumacher, director of *St. Elmo's Fire* and *Batman and Robin*,  among others, does a really excellent job here.  Nothing needs to be said  about the skills of veteran actor Robert DeNiro.  Philip Seymour Hoffman, a  young actor who has rightfully come into his own in the past decade, gives  one of his best and most insightful performances.
DeNiro is Walter, a  decorated hero of the NYPD, who suffers a stroke that affects him  emotionally as well as physically.  His doctor suggests singing lessons to  help him improve his speech.  Rather than be seen in public any more than  necessary, Walter asks Rusty (Hoffman), another tenant in his apartment  building who coordinates a drag queen stage show, to give him the lessons.  The fun begins immediately, as these two have had a mutual dislike for each  other from their earliest encounters.
Critics have said, among other  things, that:  (1) the dialogue between Rusty and Walter is cliche-ridden  and (2) the film seems to say that all gay men in NYC are either drag  queens or ""log cabin Republicans.""  Rubbish!  Walter's comments  to Rusty at the beginning of their relationship are the usual things you  would expect to hear from a homophobic male.  Rusty's comebacks are as  often as not laugh-out-loud funny, as well as very wise, and they  definitely show his strength of character.
As for the alleged limited  depiction of the NYC male homosexual population, it is really a matter of  ""birds of a feather flock together.""  The movie doesn't pretend  to give an overall view of the gay/lesbian population in NY or anywhere  else.  Rusty and his friends spend a lot of time rehearsing their nightly  stage show, giving the show, and gathering with their friends at favorite  drag queen hang-outs--probably perfectly typical behavior for this  specialized population group.  And it is clear in the one confrontation  between Rusty's gang and the ""button down"" gay Republicans that  the latter group finds the drag queens' appearance and mannerisms  unacceptable.  Who's to say that others in the city's gay community  didn't/don't feel the same way?
It is said that upon his first reading of  the script, Hoffman recognized that Rusty wasn't really gay, but a  transexual--a woman trapped in a man's body--a tough concept for either gay  or straight people to grasp.  Though ""straight"" himself, Hoffman  benefitted from the character coaching of the real drag queen celebrities  who took the roles of Rusty's best friends and his partners in producing  the night club act.  The result is an unforgettable performance in which  Rusty proves to be the best person of all to help Walter learn to cope with  a body he has come to despise.  Rusty, who is making plans to have sex  change surgery, knows more than almost anyone else could what it is to be  trapped in a body that doesn't fit the person inside it.
The film is  alternately deeply moving and uproariously funny as Walter and Rusty come  to really understand and bond with one another.  There are not many movies  that have tackled the idea of a gay man and a straight man becoming true  friends.  This film handles one possible scenario for that topic in a way  that is stylish, uplifting, and unforgettable.
If the story's premise is  the tiniest bit contrived, so what?  That has been so of a lot of excellent  books and movies, and it hasn't hurt the story one bit.  It is inherent to  fiction that it be a bit contrived.  This film leaves you hoping that some  day there will be a more enlightened world in which life imitates the art  in this film.
Cheers to Schumacher, DeNiro, Hoffman, the rest of the  cast, and anyone else who helped this delighful story come into being on  film.  Forget the critics, be bold, and give this film a viewing.  You'll  be glad you did.",965952000,37,3952,4.779433681073026
1076393,2,6305781052,"A small film filled with laudatory intentions and high-powered star performances, ""Flawless,"" is, regrettably, better in its individual parts than as a whole. This most opposite of opposites-attract  love stories features a homophobic stroke victim and a less-than-gorgeous  drag queen who forge an unlikely friendship as neighbors in a rundown  apartment located in a crime-infested section of New York City.
In the  early part of the film, writer/director Joel Schumacher fills in the  backgrounds of this retired cop and this struggling chantreusse, drawing  parallels between their seemingly alien worlds, intercutting, for instance,  between the subdued ambience of a straight dance club and the raucous  atmosphere of a no-holds-barred transvestite stage performance. As the two  neighbors brush up against each other in occasional random encounters in  hallways and elevators, we see the seething hatred that comes from the fear  of the unknown and the inexplicable that routinely divides human beings one  from another. Then Walter Koontz is felled by a stroke which leaves him  paralyzed on one side and virtually without the ability to speak. On a  doctor's advice, Walter swallows his pride and asks Rusty to give him  singing lessons to help him regain his speech.
Thus, the stage is set for  a couple of characters who intitially feel they are worlds-apart in their  lives, interests and values, to discover the common humanity that lies  beneath the surface and actually ties them together. The stroke, as the  great leveler, makes Walter, in particular, cognizant of the struggles  Rusty has had to undergo as a result of his very noticeable  ""difference.""
If ""Flawless"" had stuck to this  two-character format it might have been a more powerful film. Two elements  weigh it down, however. One is the overly familiar and predictable arc the  film travels; we simply know well in advance where this story is taking us.  More serious are the constant diversions in the form of superfluous  subsidiary characters and obscure subplots that keep pulling us away from  the movie's center of gravity - which are the dynamite performances of  Philip Seymour Hoffman and Robert DeNiro who invest both their tricky roles  - one dealing with a physical handicap, the other the flamboyance normally  associated with the drag queen stereotype - with a subtlety and humanity  that could easily have been lost in a welter of method-actor hamminess and  hyperbole. Instead, both actors - especially Hoffman - rivet our attention  in a way that few of the other elements in the film do. Particularly  annoying are a routine drug-dealing subplot and an ""action movie""  denouement of astounding inappropriateness and stupidity. In a way too, the  film is rather schizophrenic in its portrayal of gay people. On the one  hand, the drag queens are all made to seem fun and likeable, but, on the  other, they also all fit the cliche of homosexuals often presented to the  outside world. In fact, the film expends no effort in according similar  sympathy to ""straight acting"" gays, particularly in a scene in  which the queens are confronted by a group of gay Republicans in suits who  want the ""ladies"" to tone down their flamboyance for the upcoming  gay pride parade. Thus, in attempting to make an important observation  about elements of homophobia lurking in the gay community itself,  Schumacher, ironically, becomes guilt of the same crime  himself.
""Flawless"" is worth seeing for the performances of the  two lead actors, for its admirable call for tolerance and understanding and  for its occasionally incisive encounters between these two very appealing  misfits. However, for a far less contrived, far more convincing examination  of this subject, check out the Cuban film from a few years back, the  delicious ""Strawberry and Chocolate."" That film achieves the type  of thematic unity and gripping emotional power ""Flawless,""  despite all its good intentions, never really manages.",964483200,6,3986,5.214849921011059
1076394,3,6305781052,"Flawless is set up as a comparison of Rusty and Walter--both feel trapped in bodies which, for different reasons, do not feel like ""home.""  Both are involved in unhealthy relationships, and are forced to deal with  that cold truth each in his way.  From those parallels COULD spring a truly  moving story of self-discovery and broadened awareness of common  humanity.
What happens instead seems to be that Flawless sinks into a  celebration of drag--of caricaturing roles both expected and unexpected,  without concern for the subtle humanity of the persons behind the masks.  Are all New York Police officers sensitivity-challenged jocks?  Are all  hispanic New Yorkers drug addicts and gangsters?  Are all women helpless  pawns to the whims of the men around them?  Are all gay men either bitchy  drag queens or stammering Republicans?  (We won't even begin to examine the  view this film seems to have of transgenderism.)
DeNiro and Hoffman,  excellent character actors both, offer performances which, extracted from  the banality of this script, would have been career points.  Their  relationship is what this film SHOULD have been about; the dead canary and  the kicked-over motorcycle should, in my view, have been left on the  cutting room floor.  If you can sit patiently through the mind-numbing plot  tangents, you may just glean enough from Flawless to feel it was worth your  time.",964051200,5,1394,5.143497757847534
1076395,3,6305781052,"I will keep this simple.  See this movie because you must see every movie that Philip Seymour Hoffman has appeared in.  I first experienced him in ""Happiness,"" and I don't remember when I have been so deeply  disgusted by a character.  It was a difficult movie to watch and it was  very refreshing to see that Philip could play a light and funny character  like the drag queen in Flawless.  The chemistry between Philip and Robert  DeNiro is touching and surprising.  See it.",963878400,4,475,4.626506024096385
1076396,4,6305781052,"This movie is not exactly your typical Hollywood factory trash, it's a movie that shows substance.  In one flick, to deal with issues such as social decline, racism, gay movements and being handicapped (brilliantly  performed by DeNiro), is a true achievement.  It's a movie that makes you  think, no matter how ""anti"" anything you may be - it shows you  that in the end if you strip away the fassade everybody is just the same: a  human being with feelings and needs.  Great performance also by Philip  Seymour Hoffman.",963532800,2,520,4.764044943820225
