Scream of the Bikini is a loving parody of those movies in the 60s and 70s made in strange countries, with strange plots and strange dubbing.

Every flaw of those 007 class films is highlighted here, and the result is indeed comic, but even so it's a hard film to watch all the way through. Farce that's as concentrated as  this works best as a Saturday Night Live skit. A feature-length dose of it is too much for a solitary viewer, but if you're having a few rowdy friends over, ""Scream Of The Bikini"" might be just the thing.",1474675200,,501,4.273684210526316

Beautiful women, where? The females in this one all have the figures of teenage boys (think Julie from the Love Boat). At least bad 60's movies were shot on film and not video, and as for the acting, no one in this mess could play in a toothpaste commercial.

5425531,1,B00AHRIK76,"This mock film re-done, trying to emulate the great 60's aesthetic of cinema fails miserably. While watching this, it only confirmed to me my love of the actual 1960's mod-era / pop-art-aesthetic-sensibility and it's subsequent subculture from out of which it spawned. There is something quite ground-breaking that took place in the 60's; from films to music to politics, everything changed. Wherein, the notion of the great campy spy film birthed itself with memorable renditions of 007 James Bond and Peter Seller's, the Pink Panther.

This film's only saving grace is it's reverie of that era, nothing else.

If I may comment of the speech or inflections thereof, back then Americans spoke quite diferently than today, there was a certain whimsy
in their voices and they all enunciated dramatically. These actresses put on a sort of pseudo British pretention that lacks that whimisical
way that young people used to inflect there words and sentences, like as if everything was a wonder.

Essentially, that's what the 60's was, a huge wonder. A sensation that will never be replicated or dare to be imitated, and that goes for most modern re-makes, from Boogie Nights (70's) to Vinyl (HBO). Anthropoligically the young people today, the actors and actresses, are just wired differntly - no depth of character, or depth of charm, or depth of demure seduction. Most young people today are stunted, they look and act literally like children imo.

You wanna see some beautiful women, crack open an old Playboy or Penthouse from the late 60 and throughout the 70's and early 80's, stare into their eyes and tell me if that isn't what the definition of sexy sophistication really is.",1470614400,3,1679,5.007168458781362

5425544,3,B00AHRIK76,"I am probably the only person who did NOT initially ""get the joke.""
I am a big fan of 60's ""Euro-spy"" films.  The kind like ""Danger Death Ray,"" ""Double 007,"" ""Secret Agent Super Dragon, and of course the ""OSS 117"" Series.  The ones American studios bought, dubbed, and independent channels showed on rainy Saturday afternoons.  SO when I saw the description of this film I was suckered in.  Turns out I was the only one who did not realize this is a satire, trying to be in the vein of ""Airplane!"" and the Naked Gun franchise.  And not a bad one either.

The problem is that this movie is more a caricature than a satire, and that is the problem.  It is hard to do GOOD satire of a movie genres.  For every Airplane! there are a dozen ""Silence of the Hams,"" ""Alien Trespass,""  and the classic example of what not to do, ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavar .""  This film, unfortunately, has to fall in this last group.  It just did not make it.

As stated, it is a broad caricature of a movie style.  It has a good cast, and good working knowledge of the subject, but as a caricature it is too broad to sustain its Hour and forty minute length.  We get the joke early, and there are no more jokes after that.  Each introduction of a character or plot point is not a new joke.  It is simple an explanation of the first joke, which we all got and laughed at then, and chuckle at now.

This is NOT a cheap film.  A lot of work and talent went into producing it and it is a shame they writers or director did not see that he SNL skit idea went on way too long.  Which is equally a shame becasue this genre could use a good satire.",1427846400,2,1619,4.131410256410256

5425552,5,B00AHRIK76,"Im astonished at the lack of pretentious, cerebral reviews of Scream Of The Bikini here, so allow me, please. In a sense, this film tries to prove the thesis of Mel Brooks The Producers. The filmmakers clearly, very purposefully made every bad choice you could while making a movie bad script, bad acting, bad direction, bad set design, bad score, bad dialogue looping, including purposefully choosing a bad genre of film  the cheesy, campy, 1960s, foreign spy exploitation film  and literally did everything you can possibly do WRONG courageously, authentically, and with a straight face  on purpose (for 97% of it, at least. The restraint is heroic, but the occasional wink to the audience lets you know that this is not a science experiment, relax, and enjoy the silliness). This is not a parody in the Airplane! sense, but actually a very intelligent, almost-art film where every detail is as precise as it is poorly executed. Theyve clearly done their homework. These aren't jokes  this stuff is real. Every trope and clich of bad, cheap, careless, cash-in, inept filmmaking is here down to the inane, pandering, out-of-place popular songs performance scenes that are always shoe-horned into those films. The songs are absolutely, authentically the kind of awful songs they used in 1960s cinema  done perfectly straight. Its a tightrope act and remarkable that they were able to stay on the right side of authentic and not give into the temptation of broad, more Airplane!-like parody.  Its so much fun to watch a group of people who clearly understand how to do all this stuff right, obvious students of film, comedy and acting, forcing themselves to go against their every instinct. The irony becomes that bad reviews here are as correct as the good reviews. Yes, this is a horrible film, but its horrible on purpose. Obviously the best are the bad reviews that don't understand that its NOT actually an authentic 1960s bad movie (that so bad, its good) because it shows just how on target the filmmakers got to doing everything wrong RIGHT. For the reviews that say they understand that its on purpose, but its still bad, then, yes, again, that was the point  and Mel Brooks point, as well: man at his absolute worst is often at his absolute funniest. Scream of the Bikini, (and I cant believe Im actually about to write this sentence) is a mirror, a reflection of yourself, theres no wrong answer  you will get out of it what you bring into it, your expectations, your filmic knowledge and intelligence, your sense of humor, your disgust and contempt. There are 7 billion people on the planet and a film that can work on 7 billion different levels is fairly astonishing. Silly farce? Brilliant, knowing subtle indictment of whats wrong with art and civilization? Field guide for what not to do for student filmmakers? Really bad 1960s film? Total tease that doesnt deliver on boobs? Yes, all of the above and more  and less. The challenge of this film is that it asks its audience to participate. It isn't about getting it or not getting it. Its about the simple, sheer giddy enjoyment of watching really brilliant people make the worst possible choices, knowing they are more than capable of making the best choices, and throw the game on purpose  and heres the magic trick  so everyone ends up winning.  Plus, the medium is the message, blah blah, blah",1408752000,20,3363,4.829565217391305

The plot is a simple one, that is enhanced with random side bars along the way to introduce more comedy and ridiculous moments.
This is one of those movies you can watch multiple times and be able to notice additional items that you may have missed the first time through.  Classic Good vs. Evil with a twist.

So, to decide if you want to watch this movie, you need merely ask yourself how much you want to actually pay full attention to a movie right now.  This is amusing background noise but actually watching it full on may be asking a bit much of your attention span.

This is a rather insane farce made to resemble just about every espionage movie in the 60s.  It has:

* Unnecessary female skin
* Perplexingly placed shower scenes
* Cheesy special effects
* Non-sensical dialog
* Plot lines that don't ever really come together at all
* Did I mention unnecessary female skin?
* Really terrible sync of video and audio

It's an amusing few minutes but sitting here on my own I couldn't really get into it.  With a group of semi-drunk friends all making fun of it together... this movie would ROCK.

So, then we see these two adorable beauties running through the forest in high heels chasing down a bad guy in order to save the world and blah blah.. and by the way, they're also super models.  So, the point is the journey not the destination here for this movie.  I loved the photography, the cheesy opening titles, the forced music montages, the peculiar dialogue...  My favorite moments were all the ""hmmm"" and eye blink sound effects and grunts or ooos coming from the two main girls or other odd characters.. and forced laughter.. and recurring riffs like the droning guy saying ""The Helsiniki Accord!""... Just a great time is the SCREAM OF THE BIKINI ...you can watch with your family or like me, with my teenage daughter... you'll find yourself just smiling for the longest time... it's really fun.... I like the two main actresses very much and hope to see them in more movies... kudos to the filmmakers for making something so bad so GREAT!  5 stars",1483228800,,1428,4.5390625
