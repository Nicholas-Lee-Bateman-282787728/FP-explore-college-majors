8488594,1,B000HWYHF0,"This DVD is twenty minutes long but can be summed up in three words, cry it out.  That is basically the method that this video ""teaches"" parents for getting their babies to sleep.  Frankly I don't see why anyone needs to pay $30 and spend 20 minutes learning how to do that.  Since I'm not keen on letting my little guy cry it out I was looking for something a little more progressive.  The No Cry Sleep Solution is a great book, but since my husband isn't a reader and I want us to be on the same page I was hoping this DVD might be helpful.  I was wrong, it wasn't.  It was a waste of money.  If you are looking for ideas other than cry it out, read The No Cry Sleep Solution.",1159315200,,678,3.977777777777778
