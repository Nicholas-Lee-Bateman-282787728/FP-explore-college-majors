7843197,3,6303257577,"It is a wonderful video and my 4 year grandson who lives in Seattle had seen it before and loved it.  The only problem is that there are several places where the sound skips.  It does not bother him and he has it now, so I did not return it.",1128816000,,241,3.8
7843198,5,6303257577,"I bought this video 5 years ago for my son's who were 2 and 4 at the time. Being so full of energy it was hard to find a video that could hold their attention long enough for them to sit down and give me a break.  ""Kid Love Trains"" was a Winner. Being a favorite for them for years it is now a favorite for my 3 yr. old daughter today.  Same video I purchased from Amazon in 1999, the picture is perfect after so much use.
*Big Bonus* For Parents who find children video's with singing in them tend to get on their nerves after hearing it over and over and over again well this one doesn't, I enjoy hearing the songs on this video.  Hope this review helps.  It is aggravateing when you buy a video that turns out to be disappointing.",1078358400,3,733,4.0344827586206895
7843199,3,6303257577,"This 30 minute video features lots of different kinds of trains and has a few interesting extras like a train snow plow and footage of track being laid. However, the music in this video is an acquired taste. My 2 year old doesn't mind, but if you plan to watch this film along side your child be prepared for some pretty hokey stuff including white-guy rap, a Sheena Easton wanna be singer, a fake Swedish accent and more. I do like the last song on the video about the caboose, however. There are some very amateurish ""special effects"" like showing sequences backwards and splitting the image into panes. Big deal. Try to find this at the video store or library if you are curious before you buy.",1049846400,2,697,4.496062992125984
7843200,2,6303257577,"My 24 month old LOVES trains and everything about them.  He does not, however, like kiddie music.  With a title like ""Kids Love Trains"" I thought it would be a hit with him.  Not.  About 10 minutes into it, he grew tired of the music and asked for a different video.  The music detracts from the train footage and the things that he wants to hear and see.  My child's all time favorate train video is ""Choo Choo Trains, Close Up and Very Personal,"" which is also the one I would recommend.  If your child wants to see and hear trains, there are better videos out there.  If your child loves kiddie music and trains are a sideline interest, this is the video for you.",1009065600,5,666,4.272
