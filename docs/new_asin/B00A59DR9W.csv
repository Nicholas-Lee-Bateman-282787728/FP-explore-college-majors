It looks like you're watching an old projector movie in elementary school that is very blurry and the picture is flickering the entire time.  Also, I did not know that this was a made-for-TV type of production; I thought it would be more of a documentary, but I was wrong....my bad.  I don't recommend this to anyone solely because of the lack of quality.",1484179200,,412,4.616438356164384
8546848,5,B00A59DR9W,I have not watched the movie yet so I can't give you an opinion but it does come highly recommended if you're a Macdonald - however if you're a Campbell I would not recommend you watch it because you could become quite unhappy with your Scottish ancestors!,1405036800,,256,4.468085106382978
