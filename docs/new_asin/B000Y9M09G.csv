3022649,4,B000Y9M09G,"Star singer Anna Netrebko has a beautiful lyric soprano voice and is a pleasing actress. What she is not, however, is prodigiously gifted with coloratura skills. In this production of Bellini's masterpiece, she is enchanting to listen to and watch as long as one is prepared to ignore smudged fioriture, the absence of true trills, and the presence of scooped topmost notes. Whether she could benefit from more schooling, should she choose to continue in this repertoire, is an open question.

""I Puritani,"" was written for four spectacular singers, but, Netrebko apart, the Met has not cast this production from particular strength. Eric Cutler in the nearly impossible role of Arturo is a commanding figure, though he is undermined by an unpleasing, frequently nasal vocal production.  True, he hits his notes, but his voice is not markedly beautiful. Similarly, John Relyea looks his part, but his rather gravelly voice gets in the way of any memorable impact. As Riccardo, Franco Vassalo is competent, but also in no way memorable. In sum, this production, for all the raves it has received, is hardly the night of four supreme stars expected in performances of this opera.

Further, the camera locations for this DVD performance are sometimes questionable. We, the viewers, are at moments in the wings or seemingly onstage with the singers, facing the conductor and looking out at the house, for no discernible purpose, except perhaps to give the bored among us the illusion of some few minutes of personal operatic fame. Even worse are the backstage visits conducted by Renee Fleming in Barbara Walters mode, asking dumb, unnecessary questions. The appeal here, I suspect, is the same as the one to diners in a fancy restaurant who, it is thought, like to watch the chef through a window open to the kitchen, or even worse  cooking at their tableside. The idea that the production and stars should remain onstage and the audience in its seats probably was thought too non-interactive for contemporary multitaskers.

On the other hand, valuable among the special features of the DVD is the relevant between-scene commentary from the broadcast booth (thank God!) with the witty and charming Beverly Sills who shares her insights about this opera along with anecdotes of her own performances in it. Sills' remarks and the beauty of Netrebko's lyric singing, I'd argue, are the endearing features of this otherwise ordinary DVD.",1198800000,23,2430,5.080200501253133
3022650,4,B000Y9M09G,"I read with surprise the rave reviews of this performance. While it has to be agreed that many aspects of Netrebko are wonderfully suited to this role, there are also critical shortcomings which are probably not obvious to audiences who are not well acquainted with the demands of Bel Canto. First on her plus points - she definitely looked the part, which is not often so, and while many viewers don't mind whether the singer looked the part, many also do, and this will keep these people happy. She has a lovely voice and a good acting ability - which certainly brings the role to life - again something not to be taken for granted. Thirdly she has star appeal, which will bring greater audiences to this sadly and unfairly neglected masterpiece by Bellini (even if its not Norma or La Sonnambula, it certainly deserves a revival).

However, viewers must also be aware that Bel Canto also requires the singer to have a good coloratura ability. This is unfortunately sorely missed here in Ms Netrebko's performance. Indeed audiences who are well acquainted with this work will have picked the glossing over of running notes and other obvious faults Ms Netrebko should have overcomed.

Perhaps it is wise of her to have appeared in a video recording rather than an audio one, where these faults would have been accentuated in the absence of her glamorous personality and great thespian skills. For it would have brought up very unfavorable comparisons with those who have managed the coloratura successfully - the legends of the past like Callas, Sutherland, Sills or even Freni, just to name a few.

Nonetheless, in times like ours, a greatly welcomed release.",1198713600,38,1661,4.862190812720848
3022651,5,B000Y9M09G,"It is amazing how (IMHO) a relatively sedate so-so opera could be transformed into an electrifying performance due to the brilliance of  Netrebko. Not only is Netrebko's voice incredible, and physical appearance mesmerizing, but she is also a consumate actress, skillfully playing to and looking right into the on-stage cameras, in the process producing a DVD I know we will all return to many times. For the record, I saw this performance twice in its simulcast HD version as well as live at the Met.",1197763200,14,501,4.894117647058824
3022652,5,B000Y9M09G,"This performance which I saw in HD broadcast, is superb in all respects.  Puritani, though quite beautiful, is quite a static opera. Musically, what creates momentum is the profligacy and haunting quality of its melodic content, and the underlying rhythmic diversity present throughout the work. Thus much depends on the conductor.  He has to let the melodies soar but keep taut control of the rhythms, flexibility without slackness. How Bellini came to use so much polonaise in dealing with Scottish Puritans is a puzzlement, but it works very well.  Mr. Summers, whom I had never heard of before, is very good and he succeeds admirably in not letting matters wilt while never rushing anything. Besides its admirable set pieces, Puritani is full of little musical moments, almost throwaway beautiful two- or three-bar melodic phrases that make one comprehend the great respect with which Bellini was regarded by both Chopin and Wagner. A conductor cannot underline all of these, otherwise the performance becomes one of fits and starts, but they need to be noticed, with subtlety. Mr. Summers understands this very well and executes accordingly. It is ironic how much this opera, considered pre-eminently a singers' work, depends, to be truly effective, on the person silently wielding the baton.

 Of course, there is the very dramatic ""mad"" scene Bellini provided for Elvira, pretty much out of nowhere, but even that is anchored by one of the most beautiful melodies ever written.  Anna Netrebko is marvelous throughout, and excels in Qui La Voce and its aftermath. It's quite a haunting, dramatic performance that will long be remembered. You will gasp.  The rest of the cast performs admirably, Mr. Cutler providing solid technique, poise and feeling in one of the highest tessitura tenor roles around.

The production is handsome and simple.  The direction is smart, and in the case of Netrebko, brilliant. This is a DVD I will get and I'm sure I'll return to several times.",1196640000,68,1981,5.089506172839506

3022679,2,B000Y9M09G,"Despite the tremendous effort put into the performance by Anna Netrebko as Elvira, this recording should under no circumstances be released commercially.  Indeed, there are many other MET performances not available in commercial DVDs that fare much much better than this!

I am not being harsh to Netrebko, but the remark by Renata Scotto about her being the 'best Elvira' around these days is simply as far off as Scotto's bizarre early-year comment of 'forget about Callas; now is Scotto'.  And the problem is not limited to Netrebko's problematic coloratura.

There are many incidences of Netrebko acting out of character in this performance.  Her inability to conjure up poignant emotional portrayals throughout is a marked one - she is half smiling when Elvira should be dismayed, startled, or even mad. All in all, she is Anna Netrebko throughout; not Elvira the heroine.

For other characters, I must say that the singing qualities are below the required level of the MET in general,and even the conducting is barely average.

The only saving aspect is the sets and costumes, which the MET undoubtedly invested heavily in.",1314748800,4,1129,5.103260869565218
3022680,3,B000Y9M09G,"The amazon review is spot on, except that lead tenor Cutler seemed to be straining at fortes, even in his opening aria.  My goodness, that Netrebko is is a beauty!  ...And she can sing.  She loves to act and pulls a couple of moves during the mad scene that are startling, so I won't spoil them for you.
  Recorded sound, conducting, and old-fashioned sets are all satisfactory, if not extraordinary, as the lead review indicates.
  A couple of less-than-essential observations:  John Relyea sang well but evidently never took any acting lessons.  Also, he seems to had several cavities on his right side filled the very day of the performance.  You can tell that the Novocaine hadn't worn off at curtain time because most of the time he only opens the left side of his mouth!  This mannerism makes him look like a cross between a real person and a cartoon while he sings.
  Lastly, am I the only one to notice how old and unattractive many of the Met chorus are?  I first noticed this in the Met ""Les Troyens"" DVD from the '80's, but they seem to still be there for this recording a generation later!  They sing but don't act, and they must be jealous as all Heck of Netrebko.  The labor union must be very strong at the Met to force these folks on the company decade after decade.
  Worth watching, but all subsequent viewings will be with remote in hand to focus on Netrebko almost exclusively.",1314489600,,1397,4.52
3022681,2,B000Y9M09G,"I have avoided this DVD, since in the retail shop I've heard horrific remarks from viewers who bought this.  With a subsequent release of this opera sung by Juan Diego Florez and Nino Machaidze, I started to compare the two.
This review will not be a 'comparative review' as such.  Just that, with a ready DVD comparison, all the pros and cons show up FAR MORE easily than viewing this with a single shot.
My unhappy report is that this performance is hopelessly subpar (in comparison to ANY available MET operatic DVD) in more than one respect.
Firstly, the conducting is not up to standard.  The tempo was far too mechanically fast.  The bel canto style was submerged and suffered with such relentless tempo.
Then the singers themselves.
Two lead male performers offered far less than any provincial standard of vocal performances, one (the tenor) by being made to perform under no small physical ailment, the other (the baritone) with an entirely unsuitable voice type. The result is that it is a grave strain to the ears whenever these two protaganists perform, and each has such a significant role in the opera that their shortcomings become glaring.
Many reviewers raved about Anna Netrebko's Elvira.  I wish I could be in a similar boat, but alas, she failed to excel over Nino Machaidze either in stage presence or vocal capabilities.  Her one and perhaps only saving aspect is her acting, but again, her acting, though spectacular, is not entirely in sync with the scriptural requirement, and I actually find Machaidze's far less pronounced portrayal much more believable and artistically convincing.  As for singing, while Machaidze's timbre is a trifle too 'bright' for Elvira to be ideal, Netrebko's is a trifle too 'dull'; and this added onto Netrebko's smudged passage works and imperfect intonations that really are far from flattering.
As for looks, I find Machaidze's Elvira more vulnerable and fragile, if not as vivacious, as Netrebko's.  In short, the former is more in character as Bellini's heroine.
All in all, if you want ONE modern DVD for this work, get the Bologna performance instead.",1309219200,7,2112,4.963172804532578
3022682,5,B000Y9M09G,"There are many memorable scenes.  Anna Netrebko is the indisputable star.  Her enthusiasm is sufficiently contagious that it brings out the best of Eric Cutler, John Relyea, Franco Vassallo, and even conductor Patrick Summers.  The performers have a field day with A Te O Cara, the mad scene, Credeasi Misera, and the Riccardo-Arturo duet.  They all know they did a super performance.  Whereas Elvira is a plum role,  Arturo is exactly the opposite - a torturous and thankless role.  No tenor in his right mind would want to sing Arturo.  To his credit, gutsy Eric Cutler does more than a credible job.  Eric's reward?  Bellini lets him keep the girl.

Anna Netrebko possesses a natural stage instinct.  Performing in front of a large audience, she is also fully cognizant of the cameras.  She performs not only with her voice, but also her face.  Her eyes speak volumes.  When Eric Cutler sings the beautiful A Te O Cara to her, her eyes are fixated toward the stratosphere, vividly displaying her passion toward Arturo.  Her facial expression and body language is synchronized with her singing.  This is the stuff that great sopranos are made of.  Her performance brings back old memories of live performances by the great Anna Moffo and Maria Callas.  The pleasure of watching Callas is 30% vocal and 70% magnetism. One remembers a Callas performance forever.

Anna chooses to deliver a dynamic and powerful performance - reminiscent of  Moffo & Callas.  Elvira is a teenager.  There is so much energy in Anna's Mad Scene.  She explodes with teenage energy.  She runs all over the stage while singing Qui La Voce, and even rolls over in front of Patrick Summers.  She jumps up a bench in her long dress with total disregard for falling.  How many Elviras can do that?.  The audience love her.  She is Elvira!!

The background scenery is 30 year old.  I love it.  Leave it alone for another 30 years.  The color balance is superb, unlike most opera DVDs.  The sound is top notch.

The interview with Renee Fleming brings cute and light moments.  Anna has an excellent sense of humor.  Renee admiringly asks how she manages to make everything appear so natural.  She responds by distorting her face, like a teenager, to demonstrate how not to do it.  What a treat !!  The reigning prima donna of opera making faces in front of a camera to be seen all over the world.  My admiration for her jumps another notch.

I have four DVDs on Puritani.  The four Elviras are Netrebko, Machaidze, Gruberova, and Cantarero.  Netrebko's performance is the most memorable.  Machaidze exhibits super-charged chemistry with Juan Diego Flores in the third act, but the color balance of the DVD stinks, due to poor lighting.  Gruberova has a sweet and delicate voice, but lacks stage magnetism.  Canterero never has a chance.  That opera is poorly directed.  The singing and acting appear to be more about Nazis than Puritans.

This is one of the most outstanding opera DVDs in every respect.  I would buy it at any cost.",1307318400,2,3003,4.778864970645793
3022683,3,B000Y9M09G,"This is a very decent production, I wish I saw it on stage. I am not sure if it is worth adding to one's collection though, because as great a singer and actress Anna Netrebko may be, she does not have a coloratura voice that is critical for this role. She pulled off a great Violetta in 2005 La Traviata, but in La Traviata less coloratura is required by all means. To sing Bellini though the soprano should ideally be a specialist in bel canto, which Ms. Netrebko is not (and she doesn't have to be! She can be perfect in lyric and even dramatic roles).

In this particular production, Ms. Netrebko's acting is wonderful and her singing is decent, but it cannot be compared to that of Joan Sutherland or even Edita Gruberova. There is no video recording with Dame Sutherland (to my knowledge), but there are at least two with Ms. Gruberova, so I certainly would recommend that rather than this one. The tenor there will be much better, too. Here the tenor has a suitable type of voice, but he is not singing well.",1268870400,6,1015,4.427807486631016
3022694,4,B000Y9M09G,"Real estate agents like to say ""Location, location. location"" not knowing that they are parroting what Rossini said about opera ""Voice, voice, voice"". Now I learn that the original formulation was ""Delivery, delivery, delivery"". Demosthenes said it about oratory. Let's stick with Rossini's answer here.

How are the voices?

Netrebko has an absolutely gorgeous voice. She is a real pleasure to listen to - as long as the music isn't too fast. She is a lyric not a coloratura. So on the long sinuous phrases she sounds great but on those tricky little notes she just isn't quite agile enough. Her voice sounds rather more slowly than that of a real coloratura. A singer with a voice that sounds rapidly will be able to sing a turn or other ornament in a way that a standard singer just can't. A real coloratura like Diana Damrau would just whip therough all those passages where Nebtrko slows down and articulates each note separately. I've seen Puritani live twice with Sutherland and Sills. Netrebko is a very fine singer whose basic voice is at least as good as their's but its not the kind of voice that usually sings this music.

Cutler has approximately the right kind of voice. This was originally a Rubini part. It was probably done with some kind of falsetto high notes. Rubini interpolated an F above High C when he sang it in Palermo. That note has been called the ""Palermo F"" ever since. About the same time as Rubini, Donzelli and Duprez had begun to sing the high notes ""from the chest"". That's the way we are used to hearing opera tenors today. Unfortunately extremely high roles like Arturo are almost impossible to sing from the chest. For example on Sutherland's second recording of Puritani, Luciano Pavarotti sings the High F in a full unmixed falsetto. It is startling. We have the regular lucious full blooded Pavarotti lyric voice until we get to the F where it sounds like they brought in some whimpy countertenor. The young di Stefano has an even more beautiful voice than Pavarotti, but much more trouble with the very top. He doesn't try the F. Most often Arturo is sung by by high note specialists like Gregory Kunde, Pierre Duval, or Juan Suarez. The only major mainstream tenor who regularly did Arturo on stage was Alfredo Kraus. I heard him - alas he was spread on top. Many high note specialists have unattractive voices or limited musicality. Cutler is in a way the worst of both worlds. He has an unattractive voice and he has trouble with the high notes. He doen't even try for the F. He has enough problems with the C.

John Relyea simply doesn't have have a very attractive voice. On the two Sutherland records she has Nicolai Ghauirov and Ezio Flagello both of whom are fabulous. Relyea's voice is kind of rough and gritty when you want sonorous and creamy. Franco Vassalo is better than Relyea but it still isn't particularly competitive. The best baritones in the world have sung this part. That said he does have decent flexibility and excellent high notes. As you might expect the great Riccardo-Giorgio duet isn't very good.

What about the orchestra? Who cares. Puritani is famous for its bel canto singers. The originators of the four major roles came to be called the ""Puritani Quartet"" - Grisi, Rubini, Taburini, and Lablache. We remember their names almost two centuries later. I'm trying right now to forget Cutler and Relyea.",1259020800,2,3376,4.73469387755102
3022695,5,B000Y9M09G,"This MET production is an adorable performance of Bellini's I Puritani. Anna Netrebko plays Elvira in the most tender fashion possible. Her mad scene in Act 2 is breath-taking and outstanding. Her performance of the aria ""Ah vieni al tempio, fidele Arturo"" towards the end of Act 1 is so tenderly performed, its articulations so moving that it impresses me each time I listen to it again. I rated this DVD FIVE STARS because the MET with Anna Netrebko truly outperformed this time. Even if one has other performances of this opera the present one is a valuable addition to the collection of any opera lover. As to the criticism of others on this item, it may very well that Anna Netrebko lacks a good coloratura but (mainly because I am not a PRO) I fail to see where in this opera is coloratura so much required. Elvira is not Mozart's Queen of the Night and it  would be useful when the PRO's are commenting about the coloratura to indicate which parts in this opera require the latter so one may compare with other performances and get a more balanced conclusion. Based on my amateurish view I could not identify any less than perfect performance because of lack of coloratura.",1257033600,,1180,4.619047619047619
3022696,5,B000Y9M09G,"The Metropolitan Opera in New York shows on DVD's last opera Bellini. The differential of this recording is the soprano known for his performance. Not imagine Anna Netrebko as a coloratura soprano, singing operas Belcanto. I already admired her Manon, has praised his Traviata and has put her on the shelf The Woman, the Voice. I Puritani was a surprise.
Anna Netrebko is in tune with what's most modern opera. This assumes a beautiful voice, his is lyrical, sweet, enters the ears with pleasure. Performance scenic impeccable, it incorporates the persongem, his youth and vigor to run that risk. The last attribute is physical: the opera singers do not accept more plump and static on stage. Netrebko radiates a beauty that enchants the big guys and let the ladies dying of envy. But not a soprano who specializes in belcanto can make a good Elvira?
Who hears the coloraturas of Joan Sutherland, Edita Gruberova's or Beverly Sills will balk with Netrebko. His are all there, not with the agility that the three ladies mentioned above printed to Elvira, but the rewards are greater than the losses. His aria of madness is madness even. Hit the stage and throws her hair in the pit, all singing in a thankless position and still manages to keep the voice. Her Elvira is virginal fragility, either in voice or expression. Steal the scene and makes the other characters look small on size talent.
The other singers are not the same level soprano. Franco Vassalo is weak as Ricardo. His voice vibrates too much, it strives to achieve the other notas. Thomas Hampson and Sherrill Milnes are infinitely superior in that role. Eric Cutler is a Arturo median nasal voice and an interpretation without charisma.
The production of Met is classic, sets and costumes of the time, all correct and in place. The interviews are interesting and captions. The direction of innovative video offers angles, sometimes interesting, sometimes esquisitos. A conducted by Patrick Summers is conservative, bureaucratic, although correct. The chorus of the Met has a standard of excellence and this presentation was no different.
I Puritani has a name in this recording: Anna Netrebko. It loads the opera on the back, beyond the limits and the only difference in a recording that without it would be like okra aged, dull. Why it is worth having this DVD in the collection.

Anna Netrebko carrega nas costas I Puritani de Bellini.

O Metropolitan Opera de New York apresenta em DVD a ltima pera de Bellini. O diferencial dessa gravao  o soprano chamado para a rcita. No imaginava Anna Netrebko como um soprano coloratura, cantando peras do Belcanto. J admirei sua Manon, j elogiei sua Traviata  e j coloquei na prateleira sua The Woman, the Voice. I Puritani foi uma surpresa.
  Anna Netrebko est sintonizada com o que h de mais moderno em pera. Isso pressupe uma bela voz: a sua  lrica, adoicada, entra nos ouvidos com prazer.  Atuao cnica impecvel, ela incorpora o persongem,  sua juventude e seu vigor permite que corra riscos. O ltimo atributo  fsico: a pera no aceita mais cantoras gordinhas e estticas no palco. Netrebko irradia uma beleza que encanta os marmanjos e deixa as senhoras morrendo de inveja. Mas um soprano que no  especialista em belcanto consegue fazer uma boa Elvira?
  Quem ouve as coloraturas de Joan Sutherland, de Edita Gruberova ou da Beverly Sills vai torcer o nariz com a Netrebko. As suas esto todas l,  no com a agilidade que as trs senhoras acima citadas imprimiram a Elvira, mas  as compensaes so maiores que as perdas.  Sua ria da loucura  uma loucura mesmo. Deita no palco e joga os cabelos no fosso da orquestra, tudo isso cantando numa posio ingrata e ainda consegue manter a voz. Sua Elvira tem a fragilidade virginal, seja na voz ou na expresso. Rouba a cena e faz os outros personagens parecerem pequenos diante de tamanho talento.
  Os outros cantores no esto no mesmo nvel do soprano. Franco Vassalo  fraco como Ricardo. Sua voz vibra em excesso, esfora-se demais para atingir as notas. Thomas Hampson e Sherrill Milnes so infinitamente superiores nesse papel. Eric Cutler faz um Arturo mediano, voz anasalada e uma interpretao sem carisma.
  A produo do Met  clssica, cenrios e figurinos de poca, tudo correto e no devido lugar. As entrevistas so interessantes e legendadas. A direo de vdeo prope ngulos inovadores, s vezes interessantes, s vezes esquisitos. A regncia de Patrick Summers  conservadora, burocrtica , embora correta. O coro do Met tem um padro de excelncia e nessa apresentao no foi diferente.
  I Puritani tem um nome nessa gravao: Anna Netrebko.  Ela carrega a pera nas costas, extrapola os limites e  o nico diferencial em uma gravao que, sem ela,  ficaria como quiabo envelhecido, sem graa. Por ela vale a pena ter esse DVD no acervo.

However, if you are new to opera and  are looking for a fun fresh introduction to Coloratura/Bel Canto, you can purchase this ''Modern rendition'' of an well know opera. Think of Sutherland as the standard to aspire to, but Ms Netrebko looks/sounds good and conveys the idea of the plot. I keep watching it and enjoy it very much, particularly as Ms Netrebko incorporates unusual stage tricks and always looks very, very  beautiful.

I was overwhelmed by her beauty, her acting ability, and of course that glorious voice.  Then about 2 weeks later I caught the performance in a live simulcast ""Met goes to the movies"" and was even more impressed because the cameras were able to focus on close-ups with important facial expressions.  And now, lo and behold the performance is out on DVD!

The entire cast is superb.  Patrick Summers leads the orchestra flawlessly; obviously he is thoroughly familiar with Bellini's beautiful music.  Netrebko sings Bellini with no apparent effort and she is enjoying every minute of it.  The 'mad scene' is not rehearsed, she does what she feels comes naturally.  Yes she actually lays on her back on the stage with her head hanging into the orchestra pit and sings full throttle!  It works; the ovation was thunderous.

Standing out besides Netrebko is John Relyea as Giorgio.  A magnificent voice.  He role is sung with compassion and he is very comfortable with the role. You want to close your eyes and let the music and the voices transport you but you do not want to miss anything on stage!

3022703,2,B000Y9M09G,"This 2007 DVD is puzzling. With Juan Diego Florez scheduled to sing Arturo at the Met in the near future, why did the Met choose to film this production, with the WORST tenor who has ever sung it at the Met since its 1976 inception (Luciano Pavarotti sang it then, and it has been downhill ever since)? Eric Cutler is absolutely awful as Arturo; when he goes to sing his high D-flat in his opening aria, the camera is on the soprano, Anna Netrebko, indicating that maybe Cutler missed the note and they had to edit something in later. Elsewhere, his singing is more unpleasant than any Arturo I have heard in performance or recording.
As for Netrebko, her interpretive skills are excellent, and she is a very charismatic performer. Most of the other reviewers have covered this in detail.
The other members of the cast are variable. Franco Vassallo, the Riccardo, is also about the worst Riccardo I have heard. The 1976 Met production featured Sherrill Milnes, and since then Paolo Gavanelli and Thomas Hampson sang the role (Pablo Elvira and Matteo Manuguerra also sang the role with distinction elsewhere) much better than Vassallo does here. Vassallo's mouth vibrates excessively, with the inevitable forcing and spreading of the tone. His range does not extend to the top (interpolated) notes of the role, and in general he sounds like a comprimario. John Relyea, as Giorgio, does sing out of the left side of his mouth, but in general sings with feeling, and is not a liability.
A further word about this performance. For some reason, the Met chose to open some cuts, but introduce others that create musical imbalances. In Act 1, Riccardo's cabaletta has both verses, but then near the end there is a jarring cut to nearly the end of the piece, and it does not work. At the end of the Elvira/Giorgio duet there is only one verse, and then the end of the number is also hacked up, including the orchestral part. Sometimes singers request cuts to save their voices, but why cut the orchestral part? Similarly, much of the opening orchestral/choral music is cut.
Unfortunately, this recording reflects the outdated philosophy that an opera only needs a prima donna. I hope that Florez records the role of Arturo soon with a good soprano so that there is a more balanced recording available.",1209859200,16,2293,4.778337531486146
3022724,2,B000Y9M09G,"The telecast of Fille du regiment set a very high standard for opera in genral and for the Met specifically. They returned to their old ""star-driven"" stand and sing production for Netrebko. The chorus was static and uninvolved, the baritone was loud and unsubtle, the tenor was tall, handsome and VERY nasal and the young bass has started to sing out of the side of his mouth. There must have been dubious cuts and the only acting and movement were done by Netrebko. Hers is a beautiful instrument, but not really suited to this kind of music.
I hope the Met keeps going in the new direction of energized and logical porductions. This was a true disappointment.",1209600000,6,661,4.6581196581196584
3022725,2,B000Y9M09G,"What a waste of money. Do not buy this DVD. Two of the males sing and act awful,John Relyea and specially Arturo sung by Eric Cutler is really a third class tenor or less. He does not sing, just shout. In some moments you think his throat will come out. Is absolutelly unpleasant to listen him singing. Is not a partner for Netrebko at all. Franco Vasallo as Riccardo sings very good. The Orchestra an Chorus are very good too.

Netrebko as always, sings and act very good but this is not a role for her voice. As another reviewer said she has not the coloratura required. If you are used to listen this role sung by Sutherland and Gruberova............ there is no comparison at all. Before buying this DVD I read many reviews, even the 2 stars. I decided to buy it because of Netrebko but never thought it was going to be as disapointing as it is.  The Metropolitan Opera managers and Deutsche Grammophon should be ashamed to have produced the opera with that cast and the DVD, even with Netrebko singing.

If you want a very good I puritani's DVD. Buy the one sung by Gruberova at the Barcelona's Liceu. To listen buy the Sutherland-Pavarotti (it is a masterclass about how Puritani should be sung). Is absolutelly great and you will appreciate the beauty of this opera.

Estn inmensos ella y Franco Vassallo, y no tan bien Eric Cutler, que tiene una voz un poco nasal de ms, aunque las escenas con Anna estn cargadas de emotividad y de buen hacer, que quizs supla un poco ese dficit que a m me parece sentir.

3022727,2,B000Y9M09G,"Agree with Mrs. Silvia Costa about the bad choice of the male singers.  I also think that there is a lack of talent and creativity in most of the MET productions including this one.  The outdated painted scenaries are a real shame.  Whereas European productions are experimenting these days with new concepts of opera staging (some of them quite good and some others quite unfortunate) Americans seem to be stuck into a rather rigid and old fashioned concept of staging.  This is a clear example that money and excess does not necessarily buy good taste specially if they do not go hand to hand with new ideas.  About the great diva:  I certainly love Anna Netrebko, particularly her mad scene that is quite breathtaking.  However I cannot take out of my mind the legendary performances of other great divas such as Maria Callas and Edita Gruberova in the same role.  Anna Netrebko is spectacularly beautiful and elegant in the role though.",1203984000,16,940,4.795031055900621
3022728,4,B000Y9M09G,"Several reviewers have criticized Anna Netrebko because her coloratura skills do not match those of Maria Callas. Joan Sutherland,  Beverly Sills, or Edita Gruberova. On that point, I have to agree. Although Netrebko does an exemplary job of sustaining long notes at the end of phrases (a Bellini specialty), she doesn't display the trills and ornamentation skills of a true coloratura soprano. If the ability to sing coloratura is of primary importance to you, then this production will be a disappointment. However, I am willing to rely on ""I Puritani"" CD's to hear Elvira in her full coloratura glory because Netrebko brings so many other fine qualities to the role. Those qualities include: a full-bodied dark and dusky voice that, at the same time, is gentle and supple; superior acting ability; a charismatic stage presence. These combine to make for a performance that is both dazzling and haunting. Sadly for the other players, the stage often feels empty when she's not on it.

The male performers don't fare as well, but I think it's partly that Netrebko's stage presence is so strong that The Met needed to dig deep and find three males who could keep pace with her. Unfortunately, none of the three do. As Riccardo, Franco Vassallo has a strong baritone voice, but he doesn't convincingly express the pain of a rejected suitor. Eric Cutler fares better on the acting side as Elvira's true love, but he struggles with the high tessitura of the tenor role. (Nevertheless, he and Netrebko have good stage chemistry even though her voice dominates the duets.) As Uncle Giorgio, John Relyea's bass is too gravely for Bellini's melodic score.

The orchestra, conducted by Patrick Summers, does a superior job bringing out the melodic beauty of Bellini's score. Unfortunately, only Anna Netrebko does it justice vocally (and this, despite her not being a coloratura specialist).

The DVD has many special features. The highlights are Renee Fleming interviewing Netrebko between each act and a wonderful set of interviews with the late Beverly Sills in which she discusses (with her characteristic warmth and humor) her own experience playing Elvira.",1203379200,40,2154,5.093484419263456

by a lack of the style of bel canto, an early 19th
century specialty in ornamentation for expressive effects.
Anna Netrebko is beautiful and acts well, but did not sing
the part in the bel canto style. Listen to singers like
Maria Callas or Joan Sutherland to hear how the part should
be sung. I saw two wonderful bel canto specialists sing this
part, Beverly Sills and Edita Gruberova. Netrebko is simply
not on that level and needs to learn the style.
  Patrick Summers was a stylish conductor, though the other
singers were average. Best was John Relyea the basso.

People not used to hear opera probably did not notice the weakness of the male voices, but I think that all opera's lovers are asking themselves ""Why did not the MET choose better ?""; ""Which criterium was used to select the male voices ?"".
Unfortunately, what could have been a memorable production is just a very disappointing one.
Nevertheless, Miss Netrebko's beautiful voice and acting make this an interesting DVD, which I rate with 3 stars, the mean of five stars for Anna Netrebko, Arturo*, Giorgio **, Riccardo ***, Chorus and Orchestra ****.",1200096000,11,867,4.938356164383562
3022732,5,B000Y9M09G,"I first saw this Met's production of I Puritani on HD screening at the movies. The video quality wasn't very good and rather dark, and there were a few technical glitches like the end of the last scene was cut off. I was amazed, in comparison, that this DVD is sharp with excellent video and audio quality. If your intent, watching this production, is to hear the 'Elvira' of this or that soprano, forget it and turn it off. If you want to see and hear Netrebko's Elvira, keep it going and you'll be in heaven. As with her other DVDs, Netrebko steals the show, theatrically and vocally. In her duet after the mad scene, she outsings Cutler, as she's been doing all along with all the other tenors. Netrebko's voice size is getting larger without affecting her lyricism, legato, flexibility and color. Netrebko's mad scene is a case in point what grand opera is all about: theater using music to convey drama. Without theater, historically, there would  be no opera. Opera was conceptualized by the opera founding fathers as the means to serve the theater. Greeks invented the theater with its chorus, etc., and the Florentines added music for dramatic effect. That's why, thematically, the first operas, like Daphne and Orfeo and many others later, were based on Greek dramaturgy. All opera aficionados talk about the voice, the Goddess of opera, and that's true. On the other hand, if the voice is expressed with body language- theater, acting- the dramatic effect can be profound. That's where Netrebko comes in. Some said that lying on her back, with her hair flowing over the orchestra pit was a cheap trick. I'm sure she didn't ask for it, but stage directors use her unique physicallity and athleticism to enhance drama that we haven't seen in a long time. On the strength of Nerebko's merging theatricality and vocalism in the mad scene, this DVD deserves five stars and is highly recommended.

According to other reviewers, her trills aren't the trilliest, and her fioriture(?) isn't the best, but my goodness, are we lucky to have such a talent performing for us.  Thanks to the Met for these telecasts and DG for releasing them.  And may I add that Ms Flemings interviews with the late Beverly Sills and with Ms Netrebko put a human-face and touch on the opera telecasts that no operaquiz ever did or ever will.",1199404800,24,704,4.579365079365079
3257146,4,B000Y9M09G,"Star singer Anna Netrebko has a beautiful lyric soprano voice and is a pleasing actress. What she is not, however, is prodigiously gifted with coloratura skills. In this production of Bellini's masterpiece, she is enchanting to listen to and watch as long as one is prepared to ignore smudged fioriture, the absence of true trills, and the presence of scooped topmost notes. Whether she could benefit from more schooling, should she choose to continue in this repertoire, is an open question.

""I Puritani,"" was written for four spectacular singers, but, Netrebko apart, the Met has not cast this production from particular strength. Eric Cutler in the nearly impossible role of Arturo is a commanding figure, though he is undermined by an unpleasing, frequently nasal vocal production.  True, he hits his notes, but his voice is not markedly beautiful. Similarly, John Relyea looks his part, but his rather gravelly voice gets in the way of any memorable impact. As Riccardo, Franco Vassalo is competent, but also in no way memorable. In sum, this production, for all the raves it has received, is hardly the night of four supreme stars expected in performances of this opera.

Further, the camera locations for this DVD performance are sometimes questionable. We, the viewers, are at moments in the wings or seemingly onstage with the singers, facing the conductor and looking out at the house, for no discernible purpose, except perhaps to give the bored among us the illusion of some few minutes of personal operatic fame. Even worse are the backstage visits conducted by Renee Fleming in Barbara Walters mode, asking dumb, unnecessary questions. The appeal here, I suspect, is the same as the one to diners in a fancy restaurant who, it is thought, like to watch the chef through a window open to the kitchen, or even worse  cooking at their tableside. The idea that the production and stars should remain onstage and the audience in its seats probably was thought too non-interactive for contemporary multitaskers.

On the other hand, valuable among the special features of the DVD is the relevant between-scene commentary from the broadcast booth (thank God!) with the witty and charming Beverly Sills who shares her insights about this opera along with anecdotes of her own performances in it. Sills' remarks and the beauty of Netrebko's lyric singing, I'd argue, are the endearing features of this otherwise ordinary DVD.",1198800000,23,2430,5.080200501253133
3257147,4,B000Y9M09G,"I read with surprise the rave reviews of this performance. While it has to be agreed that many aspects of Netrebko are wonderfully suited to this role, there are also critical shortcomings which are probably not obvious to audiences who are not well acquainted with the demands of Bel Canto. First on her plus points - she definitely looked the part, which is not often so, and while many viewers don't mind whether the singer looked the part, many also do, and this will keep these people happy. She has a lovely voice and a good acting ability - which certainly brings the role to life - again something not to be taken for granted. Thirdly she has star appeal, which will bring greater audiences to this sadly and unfairly neglected masterpiece by Bellini (even if its not Norma or La Sonnambula, it certainly deserves a revival).

However, viewers must also be aware that Bel Canto also requires the singer to have a good coloratura ability. This is unfortunately sorely missed here in Ms Netrebko's performance. Indeed audiences who are well acquainted with this work will have picked the glossing over of running notes and other obvious faults Ms Netrebko should have overcomed.

Perhaps it is wise of her to have appeared in a video recording rather than an audio one, where these faults would have been accentuated in the absence of her glamorous personality and great thespian skills. For it would have brought up very unfavorable comparisons with those who have managed the coloratura successfully - the legends of the past like Callas, Sutherland, Sills or even Freni, just to name a few.

Nonetheless, in times like ours, a greatly welcomed release.",1198713600,38,1661,4.862190812720848

Not only is Netrebko's voice incredible, and physical appearance mesmerizing, but she is also a consumate actress, skillfully playing to and looking right into the on-stage cameras, in the process producing a DVD I know we will all return to many times.

3257149,5,B000Y9M09G,"This performance which I saw in HD broadcast, is superb in all respects.  Puritani, though quite beautiful, is quite a static opera. Musically, what creates momentum is the profligacy and haunting quality of its melodic content, and the underlying rhythmic diversity present throughout the work. Thus much depends on the conductor.  He has to let the melodies soar but keep taut control of the rhythms, flexibility without slackness. How Bellini came to use so much polonaise in dealing with Scottish Puritans is a puzzlement, but it works very well.  Mr. Summers, whom I had never heard of before, is very good and he succeeds admirably in not letting matters wilt while never rushing anything. Besides its admirable set pieces, Puritani is full of little musical moments, almost throwaway beautiful two- or three-bar melodic phrases that make one comprehend the great respect with which Bellini was regarded by both Chopin and Wagner. A conductor cannot underline all of these, otherwise the performance becomes one of fits and starts, but they need to be noticed, with subtlety. Mr. Summers understands this very well and executes accordingly. It is ironic how much this opera, considered pre-eminently a singers' work, depends, to be truly effective, on the person silently wielding the baton.

 Of course, there is the very dramatic ""mad"" scene Bellini provided for Elvira, pretty much out of nowhere, but even that is anchored by one of the most beautiful melodies ever written.  Anna Netrebko is marvelous throughout, and excels in Qui La Voce and its aftermath. It's quite a haunting, dramatic performance that will long be remembered. You will gasp.  The rest of the cast performs admirably, Mr. Cutler providing solid technique, poise and feeling in one of the highest tessitura tenor roles around.

The production is handsome and simple.  The direction is smart, and in the case of Netrebko, brilliant. This is a DVD I will get and I'm sure I'll return to several times.",1196640000,68,1981,5.089506172839506

I am not being harsh to Netrebko, but the remark by Renata Scotto about her being the 'best Elvira' around these days is simply as far off as Scotto's bizarre early-year comment of 'forget about Callas; now is Scotto'.  And the problem is not limited to Netrebko's problematic coloratura.

There are many incidences of Netrebko acting out of character in this performance.  Her inability to conjure up poignant emotional portrayals throughout is a marked one - she is half smiling when Elvira should be dismayed, startled, or even mad. All in all, she is Anna Netrebko throughout; not Elvira the heroine.

For other characters, I must say that the singing qualities are below the required level of the MET in general,and even the conducting is barely average.

The only saving aspect is the sets and costumes, which the MET undoubtedly invested heavily in.",1314748800,4,1129,5.103260869565218

My goodness, that Netrebko is is a beauty!  ...And she can sing.  She loves to act and pulls a couple of moves during the mad scene that are startling, so I won't spoil them for you.
  Recorded sound, conducting, and old-fashioned sets are all satisfactory, if not extraordinary, as the lead review indicates.
  A couple of less-than-essential observations:  John Relyea sang well but evidently never took any acting lessons.  Also, he seems to had several cavities on his right side filled the very day of the performance.  You can tell that the Novocaine hadn't worn off at curtain time because most of the time he only opens the left side of his mouth!  This mannerism makes him look like a cross between a real person and a cartoon while he sings.
  Lastly, am I the only one to notice how old and unattractive many of the Met chorus are?  I first noticed this in the Met ""Les Troyens"" DVD from the '80's, but they seem to still be there for this recording a generation later!  They sing but don't act, and they must be jealous as all Heck of Netrebko.  The labor union must be very strong at the Met to force these folks on the company decade after decade.

3257178,2,B000Y9M09G,"I have avoided this DVD, since in the retail shop I've heard horrific remarks from viewers who bought this.  With a subsequent release of this opera sung by Juan Diego Florez and Nino Machaidze, I started to compare the two.
This review will not be a 'comparative review' as such.  Just that, with a ready DVD comparison, all the pros and cons show up FAR MORE easily than viewing this with a single shot.
My unhappy report is that this performance is hopelessly subpar (in comparison to ANY available MET operatic DVD) in more than one respect.
Firstly, the conducting is not up to standard.  The tempo was far too mechanically fast.  The bel canto style was submerged and suffered with such relentless tempo.
Then the singers themselves.
Two lead male performers offered far less than any provincial standard of vocal performances, one (the tenor) by being made to perform under no small physical ailment, the other (the baritone) with an entirely unsuitable voice type. The result is that it is a grave strain to the ears whenever these two protaganists perform, and each has such a significant role in the opera that their shortcomings become glaring.
Many reviewers raved about Anna Netrebko's Elvira.  I wish I could be in a similar boat, but alas, she failed to excel over Nino Machaidze either in stage presence or vocal capabilities.  Her one and perhaps only saving aspect is her acting, but again, her acting, though spectacular, is not entirely in sync with the scriptural requirement, and I actually find Machaidze's far less pronounced portrayal much more believable and artistically convincing.  As for singing, while Machaidze's timbre is a trifle too 'bright' for Elvira to be ideal, Netrebko's is a trifle too 'dull'; and this added onto Netrebko's smudged passage works and imperfect intonations that really are far from flattering.
As for looks, I find Machaidze's Elvira more vulnerable and fragile, if not as vivacious, as Netrebko's.  In short, the former is more in character as Bellini's heroine.
All in all, if you want ONE modern DVD for this work, get the Bologna performance instead.",1309219200,7,2112,4.963172804532578
3257179,5,B000Y9M09G,"There are many memorable scenes.  Anna Netrebko is the indisputable star.  Her enthusiasm is sufficiently contagious that it brings out the best of Eric Cutler, John Relyea, Franco Vassallo, and even conductor Patrick Summers.  The performers have a field day with A Te O Cara, the mad scene, Credeasi Misera, and the Riccardo-Arturo duet.  They all know they did a super performance.  Whereas Elvira is a plum role,  Arturo is exactly the opposite - a torturous and thankless role.  No tenor in his right mind would want to sing Arturo.  To his credit, gutsy Eric Cutler does more than a credible job.  Eric's reward?  Bellini lets him keep the girl.

Anna Netrebko possesses a natural stage instinct.  Performing in front of a large audience, she is also fully cognizant of the cameras.  She performs not only with her voice, but also her face.  Her eyes speak volumes.  When Eric Cutler sings the beautiful A Te O Cara to her, her eyes are fixated toward the stratosphere, vividly displaying her passion toward Arturo.  Her facial expression and body language is synchronized with her singing.  This is the stuff that great sopranos are made of.  Her performance brings back old memories of live performances by the great Anna Moffo and Maria Callas.  The pleasure of watching Callas is 30% vocal and 70% magnetism. One remembers a Callas performance forever.

Anna chooses to deliver a dynamic and powerful performance - reminiscent of  Moffo & Callas.  Elvira is a teenager.  There is so much energy in Anna's Mad Scene.  She explodes with teenage energy.  She runs all over the stage while singing Qui La Voce, and even rolls over in front of Patrick Summers.  She jumps up a bench in her long dress with total disregard for falling.  How many Elviras can do that?.  The audience love her.  She is Elvira!!

The background scenery is 30 year old.  I love it.  Leave it alone for another 30 years.  The color balance is superb, unlike most opera DVDs.  The sound is top notch.

The interview with Renee Fleming brings cute and light moments.  Anna has an excellent sense of humor.  Renee admiringly asks how she manages to make everything appear so natural.  She responds by distorting her face, like a teenager, to demonstrate how not to do it.  What a treat !!  The reigning prima donna of opera making faces in front of a camera to be seen all over the world.  My admiration for her jumps another notch.

I have four DVDs on Puritani.  The four Elviras are Netrebko, Machaidze, Gruberova, and Cantarero.  Netrebko's performance is the most memorable.  Machaidze exhibits super-charged chemistry with Juan Diego Flores in the third act, but the color balance of the DVD stinks, due to poor lighting.  Gruberova has a sweet and delicate voice, but lacks stage magnetism.  Canterero never has a chance.  That opera is poorly directed.  The singing and acting appear to be more about Nazis than Puritans.

This is one of the most outstanding opera DVDs in every respect.  I would buy it at any cost.",1307318400,2,3003,4.778864970645793
3257180,3,B000Y9M09G,"This is a very decent production, I wish I saw it on stage. I am not sure if it is worth adding to one's collection though, because as great a singer and actress Anna Netrebko may be, she does not have a coloratura voice that is critical for this role. She pulled off a great Violetta in 2005 La Traviata, but in La Traviata less coloratura is required by all means. To sing Bellini though the soprano should ideally be a specialist in bel canto, which Ms. Netrebko is not (and she doesn't have to be! She can be perfect in lyric and even dramatic roles).

In this particular production, Ms. Netrebko's acting is wonderful and her singing is decent, but it cannot be compared to that of Joan Sutherland or even Edita Gruberova. There is no video recording with Dame Sutherland (to my knowledge), but there are at least two with Ms. Gruberova, so I certainly would recommend that rather than this one. The tenor there will be much better, too. Here the tenor has a suitable type of voice, but he is not singing well.",1268870400,6,1015,4.427807486631016
3257191,4,B000Y9M09G,"Real estate agents like to say ""Location, location. location"" not knowing that they are parroting what Rossini said about opera ""Voice, voice, voice"". Now I learn that the original formulation was ""Delivery, delivery, delivery"". Demosthenes said it about oratory. Let's stick with Rossini's answer here.

How are the voices?

Netrebko has an absolutely gorgeous voice. She is a real pleasure to listen to - as long as the music isn't too fast. She is a lyric not a coloratura. So on the long sinuous phrases she sounds great but on those tricky little notes she just isn't quite agile enough. Her voice sounds rather more slowly than that of a real coloratura. A singer with a voice that sounds rapidly will be able to sing a turn or other ornament in a way that a standard singer just can't. A real coloratura like Diana Damrau would just whip therough all those passages where Nebtrko slows down and articulates each note separately. I've seen Puritani live twice with Sutherland and Sills. Netrebko is a very fine singer whose basic voice is at least as good as their's but its not the kind of voice that usually sings this music.

Cutler has approximately the right kind of voice. This was originally a Rubini part. It was probably done with some kind of falsetto high notes. Rubini interpolated an F above High C when he sang it in Palermo. That note has been called the ""Palermo F"" ever since. About the same time as Rubini, Donzelli and Duprez had begun to sing the high notes ""from the chest"". That's the way we are used to hearing opera tenors today. Unfortunately extremely high roles like Arturo are almost impossible to sing from the chest. For example on Sutherland's second recording of Puritani, Luciano Pavarotti sings the High F in a full unmixed falsetto. It is startling. We have the regular lucious full blooded Pavarotti lyric voice until we get to the F where it sounds like they brought in some whimpy countertenor. The young di Stefano has an even more beautiful voice than Pavarotti, but much more trouble with the very top. He doesn't try the F. Most often Arturo is sung by by high note specialists like Gregory Kunde, Pierre Duval, or Juan Suarez. The only major mainstream tenor who regularly did Arturo on stage was Alfredo Kraus. I heard him - alas he was spread on top. Many high note specialists have unattractive voices or limited musicality. Cutler is in a way the worst of both worlds. He has an unattractive voice and he has trouble with the high notes. He doen't even try for the F. He has enough problems with the C.

John Relyea simply doesn't have have a very attractive voice. On the two Sutherland records she has Nicolai Ghauirov and Ezio Flagello both of whom are fabulous. Relyea's voice is kind of rough and gritty when you want sonorous and creamy. Franco Vassalo is better than Relyea but it still isn't particularly competitive. The best baritones in the world have sung this part. That said he does have decent flexibility and excellent high notes. As you might expect the great Riccardo-Giorgio duet isn't very good.

What about the orchestra? Who cares. Puritani is famous for its bel canto singers. The originators of the four major roles came to be called the ""Puritani Quartet"" - Grisi, Rubini, Taburini, and Lablache. We remember their names almost two centuries later. I'm trying right now to forget Cutler and Relyea.",1259020800,2,3376,4.73469387755102
3257192,5,B000Y9M09G,"This MET production is an adorable performance of Bellini's I Puritani. Anna Netrebko plays Elvira in the most tender fashion possible. Her mad scene in Act 2 is breath-taking and outstanding. Her performance of the aria ""Ah vieni al tempio, fidele Arturo"" towards the end of Act 1 is so tenderly performed, its articulations so moving that it impresses me each time I listen to it again. I rated this DVD FIVE STARS because the MET with Anna Netrebko truly outperformed this time. Even if one has other performances of this opera the present one is a valuable addition to the collection of any opera lover. As to the criticism of others on this item, it may very well that Anna Netrebko lacks a good coloratura but (mainly because I am not a PRO) I fail to see where in this opera is coloratura so much required. Elvira is not Mozart's Queen of the Night and it  would be useful when the PRO's are commenting about the coloratura to indicate which parts in this opera require the latter so one may compare with other performances and get a more balanced conclusion. Based on my amateurish view I could not identify any less than perfect performance because of lack of coloratura.",1257033600,,1180,4.619047619047619
3257193,5,B000Y9M09G,"The Metropolitan Opera in New York shows on DVD's last opera Bellini. The differential of this recording is the soprano known for his performance. Not imagine Anna Netrebko as a coloratura soprano, singing operas Belcanto. I already admired her Manon, has praised his Traviata and has put her on the shelf The Woman, the Voice. I Puritani was a surprise.
Anna Netrebko is in tune with what's most modern opera. This assumes a beautiful voice, his is lyrical, sweet, enters the ears with pleasure. Performance scenic impeccable, it incorporates the persongem, his youth and vigor to run that risk. The last attribute is physical: the opera singers do not accept more plump and static on stage. Netrebko radiates a beauty that enchants the big guys and let the ladies dying of envy. But not a soprano who specializes in belcanto can make a good Elvira?
Who hears the coloraturas of Joan Sutherland, Edita Gruberova's or Beverly Sills will balk with Netrebko. His are all there, not with the agility that the three ladies mentioned above printed to Elvira, but the rewards are greater than the losses. His aria of madness is madness even. Hit the stage and throws her hair in the pit, all singing in a thankless position and still manages to keep the voice. Her Elvira is virginal fragility, either in voice or expression. Steal the scene and makes the other characters look small on size talent.
The other singers are not the same level soprano. Franco Vassalo is weak as Ricardo. His voice vibrates too much, it strives to achieve the other notas. Thomas Hampson and Sherrill Milnes are infinitely superior in that role. Eric Cutler is a Arturo median nasal voice and an interpretation without charisma.
The production of Met is classic, sets and costumes of the time, all correct and in place. The interviews are interesting and captions. The direction of innovative video offers angles, sometimes interesting, sometimes esquisitos. A conducted by Patrick Summers is conservative, bureaucratic, although correct. The chorus of the Met has a standard of excellence and this presentation was no different.
I Puritani has a name in this recording: Anna Netrebko. It loads the opera on the back, beyond the limits and the only difference in a recording that without it would be like okra aged, dull. Why it is worth having this DVD in the collection.

Anna Netrebko carrega nas costas I Puritani de Bellini.

O Metropolitan Opera de New York apresenta em DVD a ltima pera de Bellini. O diferencial dessa gravao  o soprano chamado para a rcita. No imaginava Anna Netrebko como um soprano coloratura, cantando peras do Belcanto. J admirei sua Manon, j elogiei sua Traviata  e j coloquei na prateleira sua The Woman, the Voice. I Puritani foi uma surpresa.
  Anna Netrebko est sintonizada com o que h de mais moderno em pera. Isso pressupe uma bela voz: a sua  lrica, adoicada, entra nos ouvidos com prazer.  Atuao cnica impecvel, ela incorpora o persongem,  sua juventude e seu vigor permite que corra riscos. O ltimo atributo  fsico: a pera no aceita mais cantoras gordinhas e estticas no palco. Netrebko irradia uma beleza que encanta os marmanjos e deixa as senhoras morrendo de inveja. Mas um soprano que no  especialista em belcanto consegue fazer uma boa Elvira?
  Quem ouve as coloraturas de Joan Sutherland, de Edita Gruberova ou da Beverly Sills vai torcer o nariz com a Netrebko. As suas esto todas l,  no com a agilidade que as trs senhoras acima citadas imprimiram a Elvira, mas  as compensaes so maiores que as perdas.  Sua ria da loucura  uma loucura mesmo. Deita no palco e joga os cabelos no fosso da orquestra, tudo isso cantando numa posio ingrata e ainda consegue manter a voz. Sua Elvira tem a fragilidade virginal, seja na voz ou na expresso. Rouba a cena e faz os outros personagens parecerem pequenos diante de tamanho talento.
  Os outros cantores no esto no mesmo nvel do soprano. Franco Vassalo  fraco como Ricardo. Sua voz vibra em excesso, esfora-se demais para atingir as notas. Thomas Hampson e Sherrill Milnes so infinitamente superiores nesse papel. Eric Cutler faz um Arturo mediano, voz anasalada e uma interpretao sem carisma.
  A produo do Met  clssica, cenrios e figurinos de poca, tudo correto e no devido lugar. As entrevistas so interessantes e legendadas. A direo de vdeo prope ngulos inovadores, s vezes interessantes, s vezes esquisitos. A regncia de Patrick Summers  conservadora, burocrtica , embora correta. O coro do Met tem um padro de excelncia e nessa apresentao no foi diferente.
  I Puritani tem um nome nessa gravao: Anna Netrebko.  Ela carrega a pera nas costas, extrapola os limites e  o nico diferencial em uma gravao que, sem ela,  ficaria como quiabo envelhecido, sem graa. Por ela vale a pena ter esse DVD no acervo.

However, if you are new to opera and  are looking for a fun fresh introduction to Coloratura/Bel Canto, you can purchase this ''Modern rendition'' of an well know opera. Think of Sutherland as the standard to aspire to, but Ms Netrebko looks/sounds good and conveys the idea of the plot. I keep watching it and enjoy it very much, particularly as Ms Netrebko incorporates unusual stage tricks and always looks very, very  beautiful. Then again; I always go back to the real ''I Puritani'' with Dame Sutherland/Duval or Pavaroti.",1247011200,2,613,4.666666666666667
3257195,4,B000Y9M09G,"I was thrilled.  I went to the Met (1st time) in 2007 to see Anna Netrebko in 'I Puritani'.  I was overwhelmed by her beauty, her acting ability, and of course that glorious voice.  Then about 2 weeks later I caught the performance in a live simulcast ""Met goes to the movies"" and was even more impressed because the cameras were able to focus on close-ups with important facial expressions.  And now, lo and behold the performance is out on DVD!

The entire cast is superb.  Patrick Summers leads the orchestra flawlessly; obviously he is thoroughly familiar with Bellini's beautiful music.  Netrebko sings Bellini with no apparent effort and she is enjoying every minute of it.  The 'mad scene' is not rehearsed, she does what she feels comes naturally.  Yes she actually lays on her back on the stage with her head hanging into the orchestra pit and sings full throttle!  It works; the ovation was thunderous.

Standing out besides Netrebko is John Relyea as Giorgio.  A magnificent voice.  He role is sung with compassion and he is very comfortable with the role. You want to close your eyes and let the music and the voices transport you but you do not want to miss anything on stage!

3257200,2,B000Y9M09G,"This 2007 DVD is puzzling. With Juan Diego Florez scheduled to sing Arturo at the Met in the near future, why did the Met choose to film this production, with the WORST tenor who has ever sung it at the Met since its 1976 inception (Luciano Pavarotti sang it then, and it has been downhill ever since)? Eric Cutler is absolutely awful as Arturo; when he goes to sing his high D-flat in his opening aria, the camera is on the soprano, Anna Netrebko, indicating that maybe Cutler missed the note and they had to edit something in later. Elsewhere, his singing is more unpleasant than any Arturo I have heard in performance or recording.
As for Netrebko, her interpretive skills are excellent, and she is a very charismatic performer. Most of the other reviewers have covered this in detail.
The other members of the cast are variable. Franco Vassallo, the Riccardo, is also about the worst Riccardo I have heard. The 1976 Met production featured Sherrill Milnes, and since then Paolo Gavanelli and Thomas Hampson sang the role (Pablo Elvira and Matteo Manuguerra also sang the role with distinction elsewhere) much better than Vassallo does here. Vassallo's mouth vibrates excessively, with the inevitable forcing and spreading of the tone. His range does not extend to the top (interpolated) notes of the role, and in general he sounds like a comprimario. John Relyea, as Giorgio, does sing out of the left side of his mouth, but in general sings with feeling, and is not a liability.
A further word about this performance. For some reason, the Met chose to open some cuts, but introduce others that create musical imbalances. In Act 1, Riccardo's cabaletta has both verses, but then near the end there is a jarring cut to nearly the end of the piece, and it does not work. At the end of the Elvira/Giorgio duet there is only one verse, and then the end of the number is also hacked up, including the orchestral part. Sometimes singers request cuts to save their voices, but why cut the orchestral part? Similarly, much of the opening orchestral/choral music is cut.
Unfortunately, this recording reflects the outdated philosophy that an opera only needs a prima donna. I hope that Florez records the role of Arturo soon with a good soprano so that there is a more balanced recording available.",1209859200,16,2293,4.778337531486146

The chorus was static and uninvolved, the baritone was loud and unsubtle, the tenor was tall, handsome and VERY nasal and the young bass has started to sing out of the side of his mouth. There must have been dubious cuts and the only acting and movement were done by Netrebko. Hers is a beautiful instrument, but not really suited to this kind of music.

He does not sing, just shout. In some moments you think his throat will come out. Is absolutelly unpleasant to listen him singing. Is not a partner for Netrebko at all. Franco Vasallo as Riccardo sings very good. The Orchestra an Chorus are very good too.

Netrebko as always, sings and act very good but this is not a role for her voice. As another reviewer said she has not the coloratura required. If you are used to listen this role sung by Sutherland and Gruberova............ there is no comparison at all. Before buying this DVD I read many reviews, even the 2 stars. I decided to buy it because of Netrebko but never thought it was going to be as disapointing as it is.  The Metropolitan Opera managers and Deutsche Grammophon should be ashamed to have produced the opera with that cast and the DVD, even with Netrebko singing.

If you want a very good I puritani's DVD. Buy the one sung by Gruberova at the Barcelona's Liceu. To listen buy the Sutherland-Pavarotti (it is a masterclass about how Puritani should be sung). Is absolutelly great and you will appreciate the beauty of this opera.

3257224,2,B000Y9M09G,"Agree with Mrs. Silvia Costa about the bad choice of the male singers.  I also think that there is a lack of talent and creativity in most of the MET productions including this one.  The outdated painted scenaries are a real shame.  Whereas European productions are experimenting these days with new concepts of opera staging (some of them quite good and some others quite unfortunate) Americans seem to be stuck into a rather rigid and old fashioned concept of staging.  This is a clear example that money and excess does not necessarily buy good taste specially if they do not go hand to hand with new ideas.  About the great diva:  I certainly love Anna Netrebko, particularly her mad scene that is quite breathtaking.  However I cannot take out of my mind the legendary performances of other great divas such as Maria Callas and Edita Gruberova in the same role.  Anna Netrebko is spectacularly beautiful and elegant in the role though.",1203984000,16,940,4.795031055900621
3257225,4,B000Y9M09G,"Several reviewers have criticized Anna Netrebko because her coloratura skills do not match those of Maria Callas. Joan Sutherland,  Beverly Sills, or Edita Gruberova. On that point, I have to agree. Although Netrebko does an exemplary job of sustaining long notes at the end of phrases (a Bellini specialty), she doesn't display the trills and ornamentation skills of a true coloratura soprano. If the ability to sing coloratura is of primary importance to you, then this production will be a disappointment. However, I am willing to rely on ""I Puritani"" CD's to hear Elvira in her full coloratura glory because Netrebko brings so many other fine qualities to the role. Those qualities include: a full-bodied dark and dusky voice that, at the same time, is gentle and supple; superior acting ability; a charismatic stage presence. These combine to make for a performance that is both dazzling and haunting. Sadly for the other players, the stage often feels empty when she's not on it.

The male performers don't fare as well, but I think it's partly that Netrebko's stage presence is so strong that The Met needed to dig deep and find three males who could keep pace with her. Unfortunately, none of the three do. As Riccardo, Franco Vassallo has a strong baritone voice, but he doesn't convincingly express the pain of a rejected suitor. Eric Cutler fares better on the acting side as Elvira's true love, but he struggles with the high tessitura of the tenor role. (Nevertheless, he and Netrebko have good stage chemistry even though her voice dominates the duets.) As Uncle Giorgio, John Relyea's bass is too gravely for Bellini's melodic score.

The orchestra, conducted by Patrick Summers, does a superior job bringing out the melodic beauty of Bellini's score. Unfortunately, only Anna Netrebko does it justice vocally (and this, despite her not being a coloratura specialist).

The DVD has many special features. The highlights are Renee Fleming interviewing Netrebko between each act and a wonderful set of interviews with the late Beverly Sills in which she discusses (with her characteristic warmth and humor) her own experience playing Elvira.",1203379200,40,2154,5.093484419263456

Maria Callas or Joan Sutherland to hear how the part should

People not used to hear opera probably did not notice the weakness of the male voices, but I think that all opera's lovers are asking themselves ""Why did not the MET choose better ?""; ""Which criterium was used to select the male voices ?"".

I was amazed, in comparison, that this DVD is sharp with excellent video and audio quality. If your intent, watching this production, is to hear the 'Elvira' of this or that soprano, forget it and turn it off. If you want to see and hear Netrebko's Elvira, keep it going and you'll be in heaven. As with her other DVDs, Netrebko steals the show, theatrically and vocally. In her duet after the mad scene, she outsings Cutler, as she's been doing all along with all the other tenors. Netrebko's voice size is getting larger without affecting her lyricism, legato, flexibility and color. Netrebko's mad scene is a case in point what grand opera is all about: theater using music to convey drama. Without theater, historically, there would  be no opera. Opera was conceptualized by the opera founding fathers as the means to serve the theater. Greeks invented the theater with its chorus, etc., and the Florentines added music for dramatic effect. That's why, thematically, the first operas, like Daphne and Orfeo and many others later, were based on Greek dramaturgy. All opera aficionados talk about the voice, the Goddess of opera, and that's true. On the other hand, if the voice is expressed with body language- theater, acting- the dramatic effect can be profound. That's where Netrebko comes in. Some said that lying on her back, with her hair flowing over the orchestra pit was a cheap trick. I'm sure she didn't ask for it, but stage directors use her unique physicallity and athleticism to enhance drama that we haven't seen in a long time. On the strength of Nerebko's merging theatricality and vocalism in the mad scene, this DVD deserves five stars and is highly recommended.

 When one views opera, it should be from the visual perspective of the audience. The hard work of the on-stage performers should not be sabotaged, by anyone or anything. That, unfortunately, happened, several times, in this recording.

 Where to start? First, when one views opera, one should not be subjected to having to view he machinations, in the orchestra pit. The orchestra is there, SOLELY as a sonic-aesthetic support, for the actors and singers and should always be heard but NEVER seen or accentuated or act as a deterrent to or distraction from the action or continuity of the opera. Yet, every act was preceded, by a mandatory visit to the orchestra pit, to watch the musicians and/or conductor perform.

 Second: At least a half-dozen times, during highly dramatic portions of the performances, whoever did the video editing (no name provided) or the directing (Sharon Thomas, stage director and/or Gary Halvorson, director) caused the mood, which was painstakingly created, by the performers, to be intentionally broken, via idiotic changes in camera perspectives. Several times, as a performance reached a peak level, the point of view of the camera was changed, from focusing on the front of the performer, to either:
  1) the view, as seen by the chorus, i.e. looking out, at the backs or sides of the performers, into the orchestra pit and audience or
  2) the view, as seen from the wings, at stage right, i.e. looking across the bodies of the performers, across the orchestra pit and into the audience area, at stage left.

 The worst of these atrocities was when Elvira (Netrebko) collapses, in anguish, then sprawls, face-up, at the foot of the stage, with her head hanging, slightly, over the front of the stage. Initially, the camera angle is the correct one: focusing on her, from the perspective of the audience. Then, suddenly and without reason, that perspective is changed, 180, to that of what the chorus is seeing, looking out, over her body, into the orchestra pit and into the audience, destroying the mood of the scene.

 Clearly, these actions were intentional and I have to wonder if the video editor and/or one or both of the directors did this because one or more of them:
  1) had a strong dislike for or jealousy of Netrebko or for some or all of the other on-stage performers and/or
  2) had some need to disrespect and attempt to denigrate the work of the on-stage performers and/or
  3) had some lover, in the orchestra pit, who needed to be highlighted, regardless of the cost to the overall production.

 Lastly, whoever assembled the order of the components on the two disks did a disservice, to all viewers and performers. Opera, as well as any performance, should not be interrupted, with extraneous activity or other, unnecessary activity. Yet, at the end of the very short first disk, which carries the performance only as far as the finale to scene 3, we are subjected to an mandatory bonus interview. I fast forwarded through that, thinking it would not go on, for long. Surprise! It filled the rest of that 1st disk, causing an unnecessary break in the continuity of the performance. Then, again, in the middle of the 2nd disk, we are subjected to another bonus interview and behind the scenes look, all to no value, other than to disrupt the continuity of opera and the its mood. Again, fast forwarding, I found the rest of the opera, only to be first subjected to another, gratuitous, unwanted trip, to the orchestra pit.

 These so-called bonus sections should be left where they belong: at the end of the performance, for those who want to spend time viewing them, after the fact but they should never be used to abuse or break up the performances and destroy the continuity and texture of the opera.",1480550400,4,4024,4.857979502196193

8231592,2,B000Y9M09G,"Callas and Sutherland, Caballe and Gruberova sang this beautiful opera with great talent, superb legato lines and  effortless tessitura, along with enchanting trills and whistle stop high e flats. Netrebko is from the Gierergev school of singing. The Russian operas are what she is best at , and I see she is back again this Fall in yet another Russian piece after her moderate success in Eugene Onegin last year. She is a lyric soprano, on gthe light side, who now has no more top, and for I Puritani not the kind of flexibility that would warrant a high e-flat, which she never gives to us. Her ""Vieni Arturo,"" so difficult, she races to  the high C and retreats very fast into another transposition down, as she does in all of the opera. (Hear her Anna Bolena for more of the same.)

Her Russian instructor was Giergev and he knows very little about Italian opera, as his La Forza del Destino shows. Anna Netrbko has the same bad ideas in her head as this overrated conductor has. She stomps about the stage like a high school kid, and she never connects with a fellow singer, except to raise her eyes when he hits a note on pitch or when sh does.

Avoid this DVD and buy the Callas cds or the Sutherland ones. As for DVDs, I hope Diana Dyamaru will come out with an I Puritani and La Sonnambula, the latter having been done this year without HD coverage. She is fabulous. Wait for her, and no need to wait for the cds. They are out there to be relished.
PS
Ruth Anne Swenson, a great coloratura soprano, should have recorded this opera and done it for video back when. I have a tape of her I Puritani from the 1990s and she was wonderful and vastly underrated.",1401926400,4,1664,4.375404530744337

After I watched it, I tohought to myself: ""Romanticism as a movement only subsists in these operas, which are really hopelessly outdated"".  that off my chest, I must say I liked it, though Nebretko is simply not in a league with her predecessors in the role (listen to the definitive Callas recording.  I also saw both Sutherland and Sills in live performances).  But her superb acting skills save the day for her. I must admit that after her defense of Putin, her star value diminished precipitously in my eyes.  No matter, she is the Met's newest diva, and I expect her very breath to be recorded for quite some time.",1389398400,2,688,4.516129032258065
