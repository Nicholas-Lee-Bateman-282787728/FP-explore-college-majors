I suppose it is ok as an introduction to one way of viewing the history, but like all history, it is really just a collection of repeated opinions.

8157425,1,B000KJU1FA,"There are a lot of incorrect information in this video, i.e. they mentioned that God's language is Hebrew; Hebrew language is a few thousands of years old, and God created this world millions of years ago or even more. I have a feeling that it was made as an Ad for the Kabbalah Center in LA. An israeli Kabalistic/Cabalistic rabi, Dr. Michael Laitman, mentioned that Kabbalah is two kinds: white kabbalah, and black kabbalah. He also confirmed that kabbalah practiced in US is the black one.
The origin of kabbalah is Egyptian. Ancient Egypt had the same tree of life, and kabbalistic teachings way before the birth of Judaism. An Egyptian wisdom keeper mentioned that who wrote the old testament/bible were the followers of Aton in old Egypt, and they created the hebrew language.
Kabbalah is similar to any esoteric teachings such as in Hinduism, Gnoses, Taoist, Sufism....Even in Christianity you will find these teachings encoded in the New Testament.",1400457600,2,956,4.98125
8157426,1,B000KJU1FA,"I'm a big fan of history documentaries, but not when they do such a poor job of providing context and meaningful discussion of the topic. It looks to me like Secrets of Kabbalah was slapped together to capitalize on the fact that a few Hollywood celebrities have gotten interested in Kabbalah; certainly it's far from being a thoughtful or informative discussion of this ancient branch of Jewish mysticism. That's too bad, because the ""could've been"" documentary would've been worth watching. The only real reason to pick this up would be to check out the substantial set of interview clips with scholars on Kabbalah and Judaism, but even so I'm going to give this a 1 star overall.",1391904000,,682,4.837606837606837
8157427,5,B000KJU1FA,"I saw this program on the History Channel and just had to have it in my library.  If you are Jewish (my husband is) and have an interest in Kabbalah, you will be iintrigued by this documentary, especially if you are new to Kabbalah.  Nicely done product.",1383091200,3,254,4.382978723404255
8157428,1,B000KJU1FA,"I'm not sure what ""historian"" or ""scholar"" authored this documentary.  For instance, it states King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella expelled Jewish people from Spain.  They actually reclaimed Spain from the Muslims.  Look it up.  This documentary is in disparate need of a fact check.",1382313600,3,281,5.318181818181818
8157429,5,B000KJU1FA,arrive on time  great  if  want to know about kabbalah especially spiritual and  Torah  go hand in  hand  better undrstanding,1360281600,,125,4.95
8157430,4,B000KJU1FA,"I am reviewing this material strictly from the perspective of wanting to know a little more about the Kabbalah.  I have friends who study this and who often speak of it but before now didn't even have enough knowledge to entertain a discussion on the subject.

I feel that this video (at least) has given me a starting point for that.  I read the other reviews and they seemed quite critical as far as the specifics, however I think if you are coming from a place where you know next to nothing of jewish mysticism then this is as good a starting point as any.

I was entertained and satisfied with this video.  Perhaps it is a ""101"" class (to some) but I think it did its job.  It kept my attention and made me want to study a little further on the subject. They clearly state that you can spend a lifetime studying this material without fully understanding all of it, then why would this be a bad place to start?  Since awareness of any spiritual knowledge is but one lesson leading into another, I would not be so critical of this particular DVD.  For those of you who like this type of subject matter along with The History Channels support, then you should like this DVD. I recommend it.",1232150400,17,1192,4.361990950226244
8157431,1,B000KJU1FA,I watched this dvd on the history channel and I have to say it is so far from the truth it is funny.  It leaves out the most famus of all time Rabi's and shows the modern day story as if Beurg is the only one trying to spred the word of kabbalah and that is false as well.  Dr. Laitman who studdied under Rabi Ashlag the son of the Bal hasulam has Kabbalah classes every day of the week and for free all materials used are free and he has embodied the true message of Kabbalah and alturisum by doing so.  Any time you put a price tag on the studies of Kabbalah you deform the true messages that kabbalah has and sends.  this dvd is a waist of time and money if you wish to see the truth about kabbalah go to [...] and see first hand what ture kabbalaist are doing and saying.  who knows you might become one too.  G-d bless and thank  you,1184803200,18,838,3.9523809523809526
