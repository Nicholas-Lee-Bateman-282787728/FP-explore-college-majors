8572576,5,B00BQI45H4,"I have watched this one several times now and think it one of the best that Nova has ever put together and that's saying something.  I remember seeing their first episode on PBS back in 1973 and have been following the series ever since.  I'm happy that Amazon provides the newer ones on Instant.

  This one deals with the exploding meteor that caused damage in Chelyabinsk on Feb. 15th, 2013.  Nova put together the show in less than a month and a half and, in that short time, managed to put together an excellent program that combined expert interviews, lots of video from Russia on the event, and an in-depth story of how the scientists managed to learn more from this meteor strike than any other in the history of the planet.

  They explain in great depth what they're doing and why and, for anyone who likes seeing the nuts and bolts of science in progress, this is a real treat.  It was not the ending of the research; if you want more you should go online to find out more, but it certainly got things started on this important and perhaps deadly phenomenon.

  Kudos all around.",1421971200,,1090,4.472081218274112
8572577,5,B00BQI45H4,"Without reading the description on the back of the DVD case or on Amazon, one might think this was a DVD about meteor strikes in general or the threat in the future. These subjects are covered briefly, but the main subject is the meteor strike in Russia on 15 February 2013.
There are many film clips from cameras in buildings and on car dashboards that show the meteor, the trail in the sky and the resulting shock wave which came 3 minutes later.

The NOVA crew does an outstanding job in explaining meteors, why there was such a violent shock wave and why it could have been so much worse. They even go into the reason why so many citizens in the area do have dash board cams.

This is an interesting film that would appeal to anyone who wants to learn more about these events and space itself. It is 60 minutes long and has English subtitles.",1394150400,3,846,4.348101265822785
8572578,2,B00BQI45H4,"We've all seen numerous short clips of the meteor that recently exploded over Russia. It was interesting to learn scientists' best estimates of its size and speed, as well as the results of analyses of its composition. But that should only have taken 20 minutes - TOPS!",1387065600,2,269,4.74468085106383
8572579,5,B00BQI45H4,"This movie is amazing.  The information is current, in formative and fun.  It not only tells what happened it tells what we can expect to happen in the future.",1379980800,,159,4.448275862068965
8572580,5,B00BQI45H4,I was very interested in the close encounter with a meteor in Russia.  Just a little over 100 years ago a similar thing happened in the same area of the world,1371945600,,158,4.096774193548387
