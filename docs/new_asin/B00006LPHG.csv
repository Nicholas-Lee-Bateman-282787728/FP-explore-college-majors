1786072,5,B00006LPHG,"The 2002 edition of Summerslam was, without a shadow of a doubt, the best pay per view of 2002. Every match was awesome and delivered in a huge way, in my opinion, this may very well be the best Summerslam ever, here's my breakdown of the PPV and I rate at a bust of five stars.(1-5)
Kurt Angle vs Rey Mysterio
*****
-Maybe the best opener ever. Rey and Kurt gave it everything they had. There was techncial wrestling, luche libre wrestling and submission wrestling all wrapped into one. This match just goes to show that even though Angle and Rey have completely opposite styles, they both can deliver one hell of a match.
Chris Jericho vs Ric Flair
****
-A great match wrestled by these two, a very well wrestled submission match. Jericho and Flair both used their trademark submission holds and at the end, ""The Nature Boy"" takes the victory by making Jericho tap out to the Figure 4 Leg Lock.
Edge vs Eddie Guerrero
****
-Another great mid-card match. Both of these wrestlers have similar styles as they both use technical and high flying offense. This match was a terrific bout and certainly once again proves that both individuals deserve to be main-event wrestlers.
WWE Tag Team Championship:
Lance Storm & Christian(c) vs Booker T and Goldust
****1/2
-This must have been the greatest tag team match this year! Booker T and Goldust work so well as a team and have good chemistry. The Un-Americans worked well together as well. This match literally had the fans on their feet as both teams put on an amazing match.
Test vs Undertaker
****
-A great brawling match, both Undertaker and Test were so intense in this match. The Undertaker came out on top with the Tombstone Piledriver to get the win.
WWE Intercontinental Championship:
Chris Benoit(c) vs Rob Van Dam
****1/2
-These great matches are what the WWE is all about. These two had a great match and clashed their styles together to make an amazing Intercontinental Title match. With RVD's unike high flying style and Benoit's technical style, this match is probably the best Interconinetal Title match in quite some time.
Non-Sanctioned Match:
Shawn Michaels vs Triple H
*****
-A tremendous showdown between these two! There were tables, chairs, and ladders! Both men brutalized eachother and Shawn Michaels proved that he is still ""The Heartbreak Kid"". HBK dove off ladders and beat Triple H to a bloody pulp and picked up the victory. This match makes Hulk Hogan vs The Rock from Wrestlemania look like Albert vs Hugh Morrus.
WWE Undisputed Championship:
The Rock(c) vs Brock Lesnar
****
-An okay match but this match pales in comparision to the prior match. Brock destroyed The Rock with suplexes and mauled him the entire match it seemed. When the bell was rung, there was a new WWE Undisputed Champion and the dawning of a new era because Brock Lesnar came out on top after he delivered the F-5 to The Rock.
-All in all, Summerslam delivered in every way and I strongly encourage people to buy this DVD-",1034294400,8,2971,4.737451737451737
1786073,4,B00006LPHG,"What follows is my rundown on all the matches of the 2002 SummerSlam (the 15th SS for those counting), SPOILERS ahead, by the way. And ranting. Each match is rated out of 10.
Match 1: KURT ANGLE vs REY MYSTERIO (9). I was a little apprehensive about RM being booked against a non-Cruiserweight, but Kurt Angle proved me wrong selling the high-flying moves flawlessly. There's some fantastic fast-paced action in this and great spots from Mysterio's 619, West Coast Pop and Tumbing Senton, to Angle's amazng German suplex reversal of Mysterio's jumping bodyscissors. Great action and, for me, the match of the evening. ANGLE WINS w/ the Ankle lock, making Mysterio tap out.
Match 2: RIC FLAIR vs CHRIS JERICHO (2) Awful finish to an abysmal match. [What are the WWE bookers doing with Jericho- he has lost 5 of his 7 PPVs this year and only won the other 2 cheaply]. I don't know one person who considers Ric Flair a good wrestler- how can a quote, unquote legend get away with using only 2 moves for 30+ years? This is an atrocious match and further adds to Jericho's decline (through no fault of his own). I didn't think he could sink any lower than jobbing to John Cena, but here's proof: FLAIR WINS (which is, to be honest, a goddamn disgrace) as Jericho taps to the Figure Four. The first-ever Undisputed champion is plummeting due to pathetic match booking.
Match 3: EDGE vs EDDY GUERRERO (8.5) Scientific wrestling at its very best here courtesy of Guerrero, who uses an innovative series of moves to methodically wear down Edge's shoulder (even Frog Splashing the damn thing!) EDGE WINS w/ the way too over-used Spear. (The constant use of it in run-ins have made me sick of it). Good work from both guys- Edge for his selling and Guerrero for his scientific wrestling.
Match 4: THE UN-AMERICANS (LANCE STORM & CHRISTIAN) vs BOOKER T & GOLDUST (6) Good Tag team psychology from the Un-Americans in this decent match. STORM & CHRISTIAN WIN when Test does a run-in, flattening Booker T w/ the Big boot. (Anyone else miss Storm's Canadian Maple Leaf single-leg crab? He hasn't used it in ages)
Match 5: ROB VAN DAM vs CHRIS BENOIT (7.5) Not as good as their recent RAW match, but pretty damn good nevertheless. Very stiff contest. Benoit's series of Northern Lights suplexes to break down RVD's arm are memorable, but VAN DAM WINS THE IC TITLE in the end w/ the Five Star Frog Splash.
Match 6: TEST vs THE UNDERTAKER (6) While big men matches aren't my thing, this is one of the better types of those matches. 'TAKER WIN w/ his seldom-used Tombstone piledriver.
Match 7: SHAWN MCHAELS vs TRIPLE H (7.5) Impressive return for HBK who delivers an Elbowdrop from the top of the ladder and a Splash through a table to Triple H. JR and 'The King' do a great job of hyping HBK's back injury which really helps sell Triple H's offense. His backbreaker on a chair is quite cringe-worthy. SHAWN WINS w/ a double leg pick-up and roll through reversal of the Pedigree. (HHH's shoulders aren't even down by the way). The post-match action is the real shocker, though, as HHH works over Michaels' back w/ his trusty sledghammer.
Match 8: BROCK LESNAR vs THE ROCK (7). Lesnar is OK, but I'm still waiting for him to live up to his CONSIDERABLE hype. The real shock of this match is the Nassau Colisseum fans' booing of The Rock! BROCK WINS THE UNDISPUTED TITLE w/ the F-5. I was hoping he'd pull out a 450 Splash (which I've heard he can do quite well). Big cheer for Lesnar as he captures the gold.
THE VERDICT: Apart from Flair's match there were no VERY bad matches at this year's SummerSlam. Mysterio & Angle's match was outstanding, and Edge & Guerrero's was also pretty good. The only bad thing was seeing Jericho slipping further down the WWE ladder. A 'face turn might be a good remedy, but he can't go on losing to rookies and pensioners (!)",1034035200,,3840,4.582848837209302

1786075,5,B00006LPHG,"The most anticipated WWE Title match in Summerslam history:  Rock vs. Brock.  This match lived up to the hype and then some.  From top to bottom, the whole card was a classic in the making.  The final two matches themselves are candidates for match of the year.  Not only was there an Undisputed Title match, but there was the long awaited return of HBK!  Shawn Michaels returns to the ring in showstopping fashion to do battle against his former D-X running buddy, Triple H in an incredible non-sanctioned match.  This match blows away Rock vs. Hogan from Wrestlemania X8 as HBK proves that he is the icon that can still go.  Also on the card is Kurt Angle vs. Rey Mysterio:  an excellent opening match.  Ric Flair vs. Chris Jericho.  Edge vs. Eddie Guerrero.  Test vs. The Undertaker.  Lance Storm & Christian defend the Tag Team Titles against Booker T & Goldust.  Another classic as Rob Van Dam challenges Chris Benoit for the Intercontinental Title.

1786077,4,B00006LPHG,"Well the only reason I this was such a good PPV to me was the HBK/HHH match.  I never thought it would be as good at it was, but it surpassed my expectations BIG time.  The other matches on the show were also pretty good to, like the Angle/Rey match.  The crowd really got behind Brock in his match against that overrated people's champion, the Rock.  I was loving every minute of it.  Anywho, I suggest you buy this DVD when it comes out because it is one of the best PPV's this year for the WWE.",1033776000,,497,4.082474226804123

This is the most complete and accurate review of this DVD you will find. I hope you find this review helpful; remember to vote helpful or not helpful. (Note-Each DVD I review has a ""Match of the DVD"" award somewhere in it.)

WWE Summerslam 2002
Summerslam is WWE's second biggest PPV and almost always delivers. This year's is no exception. A new era would begin tonight, and a broken man will try to reclaim former glory. Summerslam 2002 is one of 2002's best PPVs.

Rey Mysterio VS Kurt Angle
This was Rey Mysterio's first PPV match for the WWE and it was amazing. Kurt Angle brings out the best in Rey. Rey starts out the match by sneaking behind Angle and attacking him. The match is non-stop action from that point. There are tons of near falls in this one. Amazing ending as well.
RATING- 10/10

After this the two GMs, Stephanie McMahon and Eric Bischoff, meet in the GM office to discuss the nights events.

Ric Flair VS Chris Jericho
Well, you can't have two awesome matches in a row. This match isn't horrible; it's just your average Raw match. Jericho uses Ric Flair's own Figure-4 on Flair, which is pretty nice.
RATING- 6.5/10

Edge VS Eddie Guerrero
Edge hurts his shoulder early in the match and Eddie targets it. This is a very solid match between two great superstars. Edge hits a huge top rope face buster on Eddie. Eddie also hits a sick Frog Splash onto Edge's arm.
RATING- 7.5/10

WWE Tag Team Championship
Lance Storm & Christian(c) VS Booker T & Goldust
I am one of the only people in the world that liked the Un-Americans. I thought they were some of the best heels of the entire roster. Either way, this is a solid match up. Goldust is getting little reaction, but Booker T is on fire with the crowd. There is a lot of cheating and such, but you should expect that. Cheap Ending.
RATING- 7/10

Intercontinental Championship
Chris Benoit(c) VS Rob Van Dam
Chris Benoit, along with Eddie Guerrero, had just defected from Raw to Smackdown. Chris Benoit took the Intercontinental Title with him. Eric Bischoff is determined to get it back and here we are. I am not a fan of this match. It is extremely slow and RVD seems to be out of his element.
RATING- 7/10

Undertaker VS Test
Test can be a very solid wrestler when he wants to be. Undertaker is almost always good. Tonight, luckily, Test was on the ball. These two put on a great big man's contest. There is interference, but it doesn't last long thanks to Undertaker.
RATING- 7/10

Non-Sanctioned Match (Match of the DVD)
Shawn Michaels VS Triple H
What does Non-Sanctioned mean? It means that WWE expects so much carnage from this match that they are pretending it isn't even happening. This is Shawn Michaels' first match since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-WrestleMania-XIV-DX-Raided/dp/6305277060/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE WrestleMania XIV - DX-Raided</a>, in early 1998. No one was expecting what happened in this match. Trash cans, tables, steel chairs, and a ladder are used it this brutal contest. Triple H bleeds all over the place. Michaels puts his life on the line to give us one of the greatest matches of all-time.
RATING- 10/10

Between the final two matches, a segment involving Trish Stratus, Lillian Garcia, and Howard Finkel takes place. I don't find it funny, but I'm sure some one will.

WWE Undisputed Championship
The Rock(c) VS Brock Lesnar w/Paul Heyman
The Rock rockets to the ring to start the match. Each man gets an equal amount of offence in the match. The crowd is going insane for both Lesnar and The Rock. Heyman gets Rock Bottomed through the announce table. Brock Lesnar even uses the Rock Bottom. I thought the ending was too anticlimactic and the match was too short.
RATING- 8/10

Brock Lesnar VS Hollywood Hulk Hogan- Smackdown 8/8/02

RATING- 7.5/10",1211673600,,4317,4.833333333333333
1786125,5,B00006LPHG,"While Summerslam is a pinnacle in WWE's PPV line-up, this one will probably stand out as one of the best of them. 2002 was the best year for WWE. Both Smackdown and Raw had the best talent in the world and equally balanced. I don't think 2002 WWE will ever be repeated.

Rey Mysterio VS Kurt Angle: An awesome match. Angle and Mysterio always put on the best show and this match was no different. Angle wins but Rey showed alot of guts.

Ric Flair VS Chris Jericho: I never knew i'd be so happy to see Jericho back in the WWE. Will it bring back fans? Probably not. Flair actully wins this match in a time where he lost mostly ever time he stepped in the ring. A great contest.

Edge Vs Eddie Guerrero: Not a fan of Edge or Guerrerro. Ive watched Guerrero's matches of late and learned to like the guy. Edge wins but this match wasn't much.

Lance Storm @ Christian VS Booker T @ Golddust: Decent tag match but nothing you wouldnt see on Raw.

Chris Benoit VS RVD: A rare match. Very good match and weird these two never again fought for the intercontinental title.

Undertaker VS Test: Filler. I found the ending to be stupid because after Test shoves the ref, he does not call for the bell. Sometimes they do, sometimes they dont. Taker wins with a tombstone for good ol USA

Shawn Michaels VS Triple H: I really liked the video package before the match. It was an amazing street fight and close to one of there best encounters. I found it annoying JR and The King kept on pointing out that Michaels had a broken back; HBK wins with a roll-up. Triple H sledgehammer shot at the end is sicking and beliveable. Funny how this one time match turned out to be five years running now for HBK. No complaining though, he is one of the greatest wrestlers ever.

The Rock VS Brock Lesnar: Where the Rock turns heel but then again, he does ditch WWE for Hollywood. A decent match with the outcome known before it was ever.

They also include Lesnar beating Hogan on Smackdown for an extra. A really good PPV and highly recommeded to any WWE fan.",1196035200,2,2037,4.3254593175853016
1786126,5,B00006LPHG,"This is by far the best PPV of 2002. Eventhough 2002 gave us the first ever elimination chamber at Survivor Series. SummerSlam takes the cake. There is not a singe match on this DVD that is not worth watching. Great DVD for all wrestling fans to have in their collection.

Sunday, August 25, 2002

Rey Mysterio vs. Kurt Angle

What a great opener!! These two can really go. Fast paced action. Counter after counter. This match could have went both ways very easily. Kurt Angle is one of the greatest pure wrestlers of all time. Rey Mysterio was so great at this time. This match was magic and worth every min.
4.5 Stars

Ric Flair vs. Chris Jericho

Another great match. A great follow up after the Kurt Angle and Rey Mysterio match. Ric Flair can still go people... Chris Jericho is one of the best in the squared circle. These two went back and forth also.. This was another match where you had no idea who was going to win..
4.5 stars

Edge vs. Eddie Guerrero (R.I.P.)

Who doesn't love Eddie. Once again another great match that followed two great openers. Edge and Eddie work together like magic and stick like glue. This match was so eye opening and very very fast paced. Edge and Eddie had so many pinfalls in this match to wear you didn't know who was going to win. So far 3 out of 3 in the first 3 matches on this PPV.
4.5 Stars

WWE Tag Team Championship / Lance Storm & Christian (The Un-Americans) vs. Booker T & Goldust

Now this is the only match on the card that didn't live up to the other matches on the card. I guess cause it was a tag match. Tag matches are normally good when all the wrestlers involved have great chemistry. I can say that the Un-Americans in Christian and Storm really sold their role in this match. Booker T & Goldust did everything they could do to keep this match exciting. I can say that this is the worst match on the card. Plus Test came out and interfered in the match.. Waste of time.
3 Stars

Intercontinental Championship / Chris Beniot vs. RVD

This was one of RVD's greatest matches in WWE in my opinion and with a work acholic wrestler in Beniot made this match awesome. Once again.. Pinfall after pinfall made this match very unpredictable. (Get the pattern) Hold after hold really made this a great match.
4 Stars
Note: At this time in wrestling there was only this Intercontinental Championship between both brands Smackdown and RAW. Which means that if you were a smackdown wrestler a RAW wrestler would have to wait for a PPV to challenge you for a title shot. In this match Chris Beniot represented Smackdown and RVD represented RAW.

Undertaker vs. Test

Now we all know that Test is not PPV material. Just cause the Undertaker is involed it is a must see. Anything the Undertaker does is worth watching. This was one of the only perdictable endings on the card. The was great b/c of Undertaker. Test at this time was apart of the Un-Americans. So when taker won this match he went in the crowd and pulled a USA flag from a fan and brought it to the ring spreading it high in the sky. Showing USA pride. Great ending.
4 Stars

Non-Sanctioned Match / Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels

**THE VERY BEST MATCH ON THE CARD AND OF THIER FUED** These two put on a classic match. Shawn Michaels came out of retirement to face Triple H who at this time was at the top of his game. Shawn had not wrestled a single match in 4 YEARS. We all know the *Showstoppa* and he brought his A game this night. This match was great. Triple H went after the injured back the entire match. At one point when we thought that HBK had no more to offer he kept on coming and kept on getting back up... Move after devestaing move HBK's heart kept pumping. These two tore the area down. HBK won this great match. The ending is very hard to witness. If you are a HBK fan I would turn away. But if you love the Game then this is for you. Triple H delievered the most horrirific sledge hammer shot to Shawn Michaels right in his injured spine. Great match for the ages.
5 Stars

WWE Undisputed Championship / The Rock vs Brock Lesner

Here comes the pain!!! The Rock is not a great wrestler, put in the ring with a great wrestler The Rock shines. The Rock really knows how to sell the beating. He will be labeled as one of the best besides Ric Flair and Shawn Michaels. This match was really interesting. Brock Lesner on a hot streak after Killing Hulkamania on Smackdown he was ready for the Rock. This match went back and forth and surprisingly enough.. Brock Lesner wins this match and becoming at that time the youngest WWE Champion in wrestling history. (Randy Orton is the wrestler that broke Brock's record)
5 Stars

I loved this PPV. I enjoyed this because all these matches had the suspense, the wrestling, and the best match ups. There was not a single flaw on this DVD nor PPV. The bonus footage on this DVD was ok also not to mention.",1194480000,,4866,4.358011049723757
1786127,5,B00006LPHG,"This summerslam is without a shadow of a doubt one of the best I've seen. All of the matches have their good in it but if to pick one, The Game versus HBK. This match honestly almost brought tears to my eyes. Not because I felt bad or anything, but because the match was so dam good it makes you think of how things were before stuff started to change and get all d#%ked up. The Brock and Rock match, that was for sure a good one but I think Rock should have gotten thrown around alot more. A whole lot more. I mean hey even seeing the Booker T and Golddust match made me feel warm inside. This is wrestling!",1186876800,4,608,4.033057851239669
1786128,3,B00006LPHG,"The sad thing about collecting wrestling DVD's is that you can buy the same matches over and over. In this case, the main event is on Brock's DVD; the HHH/HBK Street Fight is on the ""Vault"" set, so the only reason I bought this one was because of Benoit/RVD. What amazed me other than the match itself was that for as good as it was, it was neither on 'Hard Knocks' OR 'One Of A Kind.' I don't like over-hyping things, so I'll put it another way: That one match was worth what I paid for it.

BONUS: Chris Jericho was on it as well. Since WWE doesn't seem to want to put out a DVD on the first Undisputed WWE Champion, I have to collect the PPV's from 2001-2004

BONUS: Edge vs. Eddy Guerrero. Always good to see these two. Admittedly I wasn't a big Edge fan until I saw the 'Ladder Match' DVD, but Latino Heat was the MAN!",1184457600,,823,4.105590062111801
1786129,5,B00006LPHG,"This was one of those PPV's that honestly didn't have a bad match on it and had alot of matches that would go down as ""lost classics"" due to them being overshadowed by the main event matches on the card.

Rey Mysterio vs. Kurt Angle - This is the defination of what a opening match should be...it was completely off the hook and went past the call of duty of being a match to get the crowd hooked.  This was fast paced & high impact with Mysterio & Angle giving you everything from technical to lucha wrestling.  Awesome opener & if you watched Mysterio's ""619"" DVD, there is a funny story behind the opening of this match.

Ric Flair vs. Chris Jericho - It didn't top the opener but did a good job in following it up as a great match with each man working on getting each other in their submission finishers along whenever they weren't busy chopping the hell out of each other.  Again, great followup match here.

Edge vs. Eddie Guerrero - They had a good technical ""no frills"" match here that they would top at Unforgiven the next month.  Great storytelling with Eddie working on Edge's arm thoughout the match selling the fact that he knew he injured his arm months earlier.  This was a ""lost"" classic encounter between the two that would have been perfect to put on Eddie Guerrero's DVD.

Tag Team Champions Un-Americans vs. Booker T & Goldust - This was a great tag team match here with Storm & Christian pulling out all the classic heel tag team tactics here while Booker & Goldust meshed well together as the ""odd couple"" of the WWE.  Booker & Goldust came so close to gaining the belts only to have it slip out of their hands again.

Intercontinental Champion Chris Benoit vs. Rob Van Dam - This was a RAW vs. SmackDown match that ended up being another ""lost classic"" match that was DVD quality for either Benoit or RVD's DVD sets.  It's a shame they never did a rematch or had a longer series after watching this.  RVD not only tried his arial assault but also did mat wrestling that is rarely seen in his WWE career and we all know whenever you have Chris Benoit in a match with someone he doesn't have to carry, you get a quality match.  This was a 5 star quality match.

Undertaker vs. Test - This was one of Test's best matches in his career as he was able to brawl with Undertaker & held his own weight in the ring.  Typical heelish interfearence with the Un-Americans but that didn't top Taker from getting the win in the end & cementing his babyface turn.

Non-Sanctioned Match: Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H - This was HBK's big return after his last match at WrestleMania XIV around 4 years earlier. The way the match was structured allowed HBK to go beyond a normal match performances as weapons were utilized as well along with ladder & steel step spots. HBK made one of the greatest comebacks of all time here and Triple H was the perfect ""dancing partner"" in this match.

Undisputed Champion The Rock vs. Brock Lesnar - The match was absolutely solid from start to finish but the bigger story here was just how through midmatch that the crowd turned on The Rock & were behind Brock Lesnar. This was one of those matches where you knew the result going in but it didn't take away from the great match. Brock won the belt in the end & ""The Next Big Thing"" had arrived (then soon left but that's another story...LOL!)

Overall, this is a quality PPV here & I highly recommend this as it was one of the best events from 2002.",1182211200,,3442,4.392125984251969

1786131,5,B00006LPHG,"This is a PPV card that didn't have a bad match on it. It was solid from top to bottom. We see the long awaited, 4 year return of the Heartbreak Kid Shawn Michaels and the arrival of The Next Big Thing.

Kurt Angle vs. Rey Mysterio
This match is a perfect demostration of what an opening match up should be. This match was just off the chain and it did everything to get the crowd pumped. I felt Angle was a little ruthless here in this match and toying with Rey. Angle and Rey did a good job countering each other moves. Angle and Rey had an outstanding match and it was just off the page. 5/5

Chris Jericho vs. Ric Flair
A very good follow up to the opener but doesn't quite top it. Flair and Jericho works on each other's leg to try and lock in their submissions. Even at times applying their opponent's finishing submission move on one another. Jericho also got dirty at times and using his wrist tape to choke the Nature Boy. This match is much better then their Unforgiven encounter. Again, just a great following match up to the opener. 4/5

Edge vs. Eddie Guererro
Another great match up as we see Edge selling his injured arm and Eddie taking every second to add more punishment on it. One sick spot to look out for is Eddie pulling off an arm breaker on Edge off the top rope. These two would up their game in their Unforgiven match & thier No DQ Match on Smackdown but this a still an awesome confrontation between these two talented superstars. 4.5/5

World Tag Team Championship
Lance Storm and Christian (C) vs. Booker T and Goldust
This was a great tag team match. Some good tag team chemistry among the Un-Americans and the unlikely team of Booker and Goldust. The Un-Americans worked really well together and pulling off the classic heel double teaming moves. This would've been the tag team match of the year but this match doesn't come close to the classic Tag Match at No Mercy between Kurt Angle, Chris Benoit and Edge, Rey Mysterio. Still one great tag team match nevertheless. 4/5

Intercontinental Championship
Chris Benoit (C) vs. RVD
This was a Smackdown vs. RAW match to see which brand would gain the IC Title. Benoit's technical, mat based style meshed in very well with the high flyiing style of RVD and this match became one of those ""lost"" classics that should have been on The Intercontinental Championship DVD release. This is one of those matches that nothing they did went wrong and it just flowed all the way through and it became one of the best Intercontinental Champions Matches of all time. I rank this match on the same level with the Summerslam '91 IC Title Match between Bret Hart and Mr. Perfect. 5/5

Undertaker vs. Test
A very good showing from Test and Taker here. They seem just so intense and poised to destroy each other out of repect of their home country. They have a great brawl with classic heelish interference from the Un-Americans. In the end Taker gets the win and to my knowledge this was the first match Undertaker won with the Tombstone Piledriver since Wrestlemania X8 earlier in the year. 4/5

Non-Sanctioned
Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H
This had to be the greatest comeback match ever in professional wrestling. Shawn didn't wrestle since his last match 4 years ago at Wrestlemania XIV and Triple H did a good job in giving Shawn his respects to perform like he did 4 years earlier. Michaels was selling his back all the way through and Triple H using various chair shots and applying moves like the abdominal stretch to add more punishment and torque to the back of Michaels. But with the match structure having No DQ and No Count Out, Michaels was able to go beyond and bring out weapons such as tables and ladders to refresh everybody's mind of what the showstopper is capable of. Shawn didn't miss a step one bit here and this became a tremendous match. 5/5

Undisputed Championship
The Rock (C) vs. Brock Lesnar
Michael Cole said it best, ""This Is The Most Anticipated Main Event In Summerslam History."" The fans was the most electic here throughout the night and turning on The Rock mid-way and getting behind Lesnar as the match went on. The Rock was selling his rib injury and Brock was using his big powerhouse moves and a few submissions to wear down The Rock. This is a match that everybody knew what the outcome was going to be but that doesn't take away from the match at all. The match was just solid from start to finish. An awesome championship match. 5/5

I HIGHLY recommend this event. This is one of the best events from the year of 2002.",1173312000,,4522,4.511599511599512
1786132,4,B00006LPHG,"WWE didn't put on a better PPV until Wrestlemania 20 in 2004. Probably the best deal you can find on a wrestling DVD, this one has some great action.

Kurt Angle vs. Rey Myserio Jr.: Incredible ppv debut for Misterio, and one of  Angle's best matches of the year, which is saying something, because he had many. Not too much in the way of psychology, but as a fast paced, urgent match, it succeeded. Definately one of the best PPV openers since '97 (Canadian Stampede.) I give it: ****1/4

Chris Jericho vs. Ric Flair: Fun little match, but one of the weaker ones on the card. Jericho plays his classic ""greatest-of-all-time"" heel to perfection against one of the greatest of all time. I give it: **3/4

Christian & Lance Storm vs. Booker T & Goldust: Nothing much to it, but still a pretty good tag, considering the Raw tag division of the time (and since.) I give it: **1/2

Edge vs. Eddie Guerrero: I loved this match when it happened. It had a great psychological element to it, in Eddie unrelenting on the arm of Edge. Match started out a fast paced back and forth match, slowed to an intelligent and calculated assault from Eddie, Eddie made a mistake, and that's that. Great storytelling that moved the storyline forward, the only match on the card that actually did that. I give it ***1/2

Chris Benoit vs. Rob Van Dam: Great match, Benoit carried it of course. RVD, though, to his own credit, played his part well also. For once in his career he sold his injuries (kind of) and wasn't too spotty and botchy in his execution. This was Benoit's return PPV singles bout since early 2001, and he showed no signs of ring-rust. A classic example of a carry-job. I give it: ****

Test vs. Undertaker: If there were to be a throw-away match on the card, this would be it. This was at the peak of Test's WWE tenure, in-ring wise, and Undertaker just dropped the title the month earlier. But more importantly, he was fresh from his best character of his career, an incredibly well recieved heel, and in my opinion one of the best characters in WWE history. Too bad he was forced into face-position. Decent match. I give it: *3/4

""HBK"" Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H: One of the most anticipated matches in the last 10 years of wrestling, HBK made his WWE return after a four year sabatical to take on story-line and real life close friend, Levesque. Build up was lacking and somewhat dissappointing, but the match that resulted is still considered a classic to this day. A bit overrated upon reception, this was a dynamic match none the less, filled with drama, action, blood, and the occasional high-spot. HBK, surprisingly, hadn't lost a step and HHH stepped up his game, though he was at a career low at the time, to deliver the second best WWE match of 2002(second to Benoit/Angle vs. Mysterio/Edge at No Mercy). I give it: ****1/2

The Rock vs. Brock Lesnar: Lesnar was a rookie at the time and many were skeptical of his ability to carry a promotion as it's champ. Besides, the most competitive match he had at the time was against RVD in a rather one-sided affair a month earlier. But all doubts were laid to rest with this match and his resulting feuds with Undertaker, Big Show, and, climatically) Kurt Angle. The match was a masterpiece in main-event wrestling. The Rock was ""squashed"" in this bout, so to speak, though he did get a good amount of offense in on the Next Big Thing. Big match feel, a competitive presentation, and a rabid crowd result in the best PPV main event of 2002. I give it ****

All in all, Summerslam 2002 is a priceless DVD, with a good amount of extras and some AWESOME wrestling. BUY IT NOW.",1160956800,5,3626,4.522137404580152

1786153,5,B00006LPHG,"SummerSlam 2002 was one of those events that didn't have a bad match on the card & most of the matches here turned out to be high quality encounters that would be overshadowed by the two main events where a legend returned to the ring & a youngster reached the pinnacle of his short career.

Kurt Angle vs Rey Mysterio. This feud was based off the fact that Mysterio pinned Angle in a six man tag & Angle wanted revenge for it. This really got hot from the get go with Mysterio surprising Angle from the crowd, leaping into the ring with a springboard head scissors to start the match. Kurt regained his momentum by catching Mysterio in one flying move too many before really getting aggressive with his offense of suplexes & countering all of Mysterio's offense. The crowd was all over Angle from the start till the end allowing Rey to regain control with his somersault plancha to the outside, springboard leg drop & even doing his 619 & west coast pop before Angle was able to catch Rey one more time & deliver on what he promised to do going into this event. This was an awesome match to start the show as the crowd was hot while Kurt's wrestling style mixed with Rey's high flying style.

Ric Flair vs Chris Jericho. Over the past few weeks this match had gotten very personal between these two with Flair being busted open by Jericho to Flair destroying Jericho's band instruments. Both men were aggressive with their series of chops to start things off before Jericho was able to control the match by suplexing Flair & even attempting high risk moves including one to the outside where Flair was on the guardrail. From there both men attempted working on the other's leg to set up their submission holds including a battle of the figure four & the walls before a judgment call involving the referee & a low blow ended up being the deciding factor. This couldn't top the opening match but these two were able to follow it up as best as they could & was actually a better match than their future Unforgiven match a month later as it didn't come off as a filler.

Edge vs Eddie Guerrero. Two of SmackDown's brightest stars at the time clash here. Edge started off the match at a quick pace including delivering a one man flapjack. However it was one move that caused Edge to reaggravate his previously injured shoulder in the process which ended up being the focal point of this match. Eddie was relentless by attacking the arm & shoulder at all times with hammerlock slams, series of armbars & even delivering a frog splash specifically on the injured shoulder. Edge was able to mount offense but continously kept favoring the shoulder including doing a high risk move that ended with him landing on his shoulder before being able to change things in three seconds. These two would go on to top this performance in their next series of matches but this was definitely a quality performance as it showed a different side of Eddie Guerrero as well as showing the heart of Edge.

WWE Tag Team Champions Christian & Lance Storm vs Booker T & Goldust. WWE tried to make this Anti-American angle work but it was just not the same as it was in 1997. Booker & Goldust dominated the early stages of this match as the crowd was behind them non stop before the momentum started to switch in favor of the champions. Christian & Storm were able to use every classic tag team strategy in the book including frequent tags, isolating their opponents & even attempting dirty tactics such as ""con chair to"". Booker was able to get the hot tag & take control back before it was one ""Un-American"" that ended up being a factor in this one. This was a great tag team match as it featured all the classic tag team tactics with the crowd just being hot from start to finish.

Intercontinental Champion Chris Benoit vs Rob Van Dam. The only interpromotional match on the card as Benoit won the title from RVD weeks prior on RAW before jumping over to SmackDown with Stephanie McMahon & Eric Bischoff watching this match in the same office. This started off as a stalemate between both men as RVD was using his ""educated feet"" with a series of kicks including Benoit suffering a busted lip in the process just to get a hold of RVD. Just as Angle was earlier, Benoit became ruthless with his technical wrestling before focusing on RVD's shoulder by ramming it into the ring post, delivering northern light suplexes & series of unique stretches to set up the crossface. RVD went hold for hold with Benoit including getting Benoit in his own crossface at one point while still pulling out his offense of kicks, rolling thunder & split-legged moonsault. Jim Ross was on point at the end of the match by calling this ""one hell of a wrestling match"" as I consider this a lost classic in not just both men's careers but also for the Intercontinental title.

The Undertaker vs Test. This was the second match of the night that involved a member of the ""Un-Americans"" facing off against the American Bad Ass while it should be noted that Test had scored a pinfal victory over Taker weeks prior. Taker came out aggressive from the start by going to the air while Test was able to change things with the unwilling help of the referee. Test brought the fight to Taker on the outside including sending Taker into the steel steps & grounding him in the ring before Taker build enough momentum to not only executed his trademark ""Old School"" & chokeslam but also take care of some outside help from Test. This was one of Test's best matches in his career as it didn't go too long but he brought the fight to Taker while Taker held his own with the aftermath involving ""Old Glory"" being quite the sight to look at.

Non-Sanctioned Match: Shawn Michaels vs Triple H. This was the big return for Shawn Michaels as this was his first match since WrestleMania XIV & to show the seriousness of this one, he wrestled in his jeans & cowboy boots. HBK started off in control after a thrown towel while showing us flashes of greatness from HBK. However Triple H was able to recover with a very high impact back breaker that really changed the direction this one was going. Triple H continued to punish the back with anything he could get his hands on such as a steel chair that busted Shawn open to even using Shawn's belt & buckle as a weapon but HBK just wouldn't stay down. The frustration grew within Triple H not being able to put Shawn down that allowed HBK to respond with one hell of a superkick with a chair that heavily busted open the game. From there, Shawn was able to regain momentum by introducing more weapons such as a trash can, using the Spanish announcer's boot, returning the favors with the belt, using the steel steps, a steel chair before introducing a ladder that brought a smile on Shawn's face. A table was introduced with Shawn delivering a splash from the top rope to the outside while delivering an elbow drop from the top of the ladder inside the ring. Triple H was able to recover & even bring the steps into the ring before Shawn had one last surge that made the difference in this match but not before Triple H left with the last laugh. This was the match that made Shawn return as regular performer as opposed to this being a one night only but judging from this performance, you would think he didn't miss a day while Triple H certainly can rise to the occassion in a match that I consider to be their best match in their series despite all of their other matches throughout the next two years.

WWE Undisputed Champion The Rock vs Brock Lesnar. This was the match that was regarded as the most anticipated bout in SummerSlam history & with the tension going into this match, you knew it would be something. Rock ran straight to the ring unloading on Lesnar before Brock changed things with one belly to belly suplex. Brock was able to target Rock's ribs that were injured the week prior by delivering suplexes, back breaker, going to the floor & dropping Rock ribs first on the barricade, using a chair to the ribs with even Paul Heyman getting his cheap shots in each time Rock tried to regain momentum. Rock was able to come back with a back suplex with both men doing stereo kick-ups at one point. Rock then began focus on Lesnar's knee with the sharpshooter before Paul Heyman would pay for getting involved one too many times with a Rock Bottom on the announce table. Both men really kicked it into higher gear pulling out stereo Rock Bottoms with the crowd going from split to even turning on Rock to cheer Brock despite Brock being the heel. However, in the end Brock Lesnar made history by becoming the youngest WWE Champion in history but this match lived up to all the hype going into it as it was just an intense battle from the opening bell till the end with the highlight being the crowd switching sides.

DVD extras include the Brock Lesnar vs Hollywood Hulk Hogan match from SmackDown, post-match interviews, an interview on Byte This with Shawn Michaels, promos, making of the SummerSlam commercial along with the commercial itself & the training regiments of The Rock & Brock Lesnar.

Overall, this is one of those events that is worth going out of your way to see as this event has gone down as the last classic SummerSlam event of them all.",1136332800,,9250,4.520310633213859

1786155,4,B00006LPHG,"SUMMERSLAM 2002 is an interesting time capsule to revisit.  The WWE had a rough spring season in 2002, but their summer season catapulted their programming back to greatness.  Until the WWE chooses to release a SUMMERSLAM anthology, everybody should check this out.

(1) Kurt Angle vs. Rey Mysterio
---This was when Mysterio had debuted a month ago, and was giving Angle one hell of a bad time.  On this night, the two rivals gave an energizing match that had the Long Island crowd (and me) going nuts.  Mysterio took some nasty suplexes and slams, but also delivered some high-risk moves to kept the match exciting.  Angle was flat-outn vicious when grappling with the cruiserweight.  Of all the matches scheduled for this PPV, WWE couldn't have picked a better opener.
""8.0 out of 10""

(2) Chris Jericho vs. Ric Flair
---Get used to chops, because you're going to see and hear them A LOT.  Jericho is a superb athlete who always gives a good show on his end of a match.  Flair is hit-or-miss with me, but back in 2002, he could still perform quite well.  I guess you have to take Flair's matches with a grain of salt (like Hulk Hogan).  Overall, an average match that wasn't too long, running at nearly 10 minutes.
""6.0 out of 10""

(3) Eddie Guerrero vs. Edge
---This match didn't need storylines to make it a good showcase, but I don't think they quite delivered on this PPV.  These two would have a better showing at UNFORGIVEN, & eventually a classic match on SmackDown a few weeks later.  But the problem with this one is that Guerrero focused on Edge's arm for way too long, which slowed things down to an unforgiving slow pace.  There was still some some slams exchanged between the two opponents, and I don't think either Edge or Guerrero gave each other much time to protect their falls.  But in the end, this was a sign of better things to come.
""6.5 out of 10""

(4) Tag Team Championships
Christian & Lance Storm (champions) vs. Booker T & Goldust
---Think of every Tag Team Match cliche you can think of, and this match probably had it.  Seriously, other than Goldust's unorthodox style of wrestling, there was not one ounce of originality in this title bout.  The bad guys used corner double-teams that irritated frustrated more than entertained...the illegal good guy rushed in instead of letting the referee do his job...the same guy was tagged in, but the referee didn't see it, and forced the wounded good guy to compete even more...THE LIST GOES EVER ON!  Now, because the match wasn't too long --- and because Booker T and Goldust were very good here --- I wasn't too upset.  But change the faces, and we've all seen this match before somewhere in our lives.
""6.0 out of 10""

(5) Intercontinental Championship
Chris Benoit (champion) vs. Rob Van Dam
---Benoit won the title from RVD, and then defected from RAW to SMACKDOWN.  Now both men were under enormous pressure to bring the gold back their TV shows.  This one had classic written all over it, but it's not the kind of classic you're expecting.  If you're hoping for a fast-paced, hard-hitting, action-packed showdown between two ECW veterans...think again.  If you're willing to see Benoit and RVD in a slower, more technical and submission-style matchup...you're in for a treat.  I can't tell if the crowd was just bored, or if they were politely engaged in the strategic contest --- I really can't tell.  Benoit really impressed me with his creative submissions and stiff suplexes; I wish RVD got a tad more offense in, but then again, this wasn't his usual style.  I really enjoyed this one after a couple viewings, but some fans won't like seeing RVD with a grounded kind of performance.
""8.0 out of 10"" (If you compiled an average of scores for this contest, you'd probably get a ""7.0"")

(6) Test vs. The Undertaker
---I feel this match was totally pointless, but still good.  The Undertaker finally became a good guy again, and took the fight to the cocky Un-American.  Test is a quick and strong athlete, who was sadly underappreciated during his time with WWE.  These two have done better in other matches, but when this match picked up, it got going.  Long two-counts, interference from Christian and Lance Storm, and a fast-paced finish held this one together.
""6.5 out of 10""

(7) Unsanctioned Match
Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H
---Man, this Street Fight got pretty brutal and unforgiving.  Backs were cracked on weapons, faces were busted open and shed blood, and bodies were damn sure broken after this one.  But what kept this one from greatness (as most have praised it to be) was that there wasn't much of an 'exchange.'  In other words, Michaels and HHH didn't have back-and-forth action.  Instead, they had periods one got to dominate the other for a few minutes, and then vice versa.  Where were the reversals, the counters, or instinctive punches?  Then again, this was advertised as a ""Fight"", nothing more.  Street Fights like these bring out the sadist in each of us, and we love it!
""8.5 out of 10""

(8) Undisputed WWE Championship
Brock Lesnar vs. The Rock (champion)
---The hype and the training led up to what Michael Cole called ""The most anticipated main event in SummerSlam history.""  I couldn't agree more.  These guys worked hard to prepare for this stellar final contest.  Lesnar and The Rock gave a spectacular battle of wits, speed, strength, and endurance.  Even Paul Heyman's role in the match was very well-done.  Add a wild, intense Long Island crowd to the mix (they loved every minute of this one), and you've just witnessed the best main event in SUMMERSLAM history.
""9.0 out of 10""

Now, the overall PPV is good, but the Bonus Features bring this DVD up a grade.  The commercial footage is entertaining, the Shawn Michaels interview clips are nice, the Hogan/Lesnar match from SmackDown is a welcome addition, the post-match interviews are excellent, and the training footage of The Rock and Brock Lesnar is amazing.  This is one of WWE's best DVDs as far as Extras go.

Match One-Rey Mysterio Vs Kurt Angle-Rey had only recently debuted in the WWE and he had made quite an impact and Kurt got jealous. This match was a good technical and high flying match with Rey and Kurt doing what they do best. There wasn't any outside obstructions or anything used to wreck the match it was just a straight up one on one great match. My rating 8.87/10.

Match Two-Y2J Vs Ric Flair-This was the trademark style match of Ric Flair which we've come to love to watch. There was a little bit of dirty play but its what it was meant to do. I believe these two should definetly have a rematch as they did very well in the ring together. Hopefully Flair gets one last title reign with any title and Y2J gets a title shot as they both deserve it. My rating 8.68/10.

Match Three-Eddie Guerrero Vs Edge-These two are great contenders to be World Champs in the future as they are great wrestlers,have a great work ethic and always do the best they can. The match itself between these two who were feuding was good quality and a good length. There was a couple of finisher attempts and kickouts from finishers and it made each man look very strong and willing to win at any cost without cheating. Give these two a great big push in their feud. My rating 8.70.

Match Four-World Tag Team Championships-Lance Storm and Christian(C)Vs Booker T and Goldust-This was a nice match as it had two very good teams going at it. There was lots of action and a few little comebacks after being dominated. There was interference at the end but it didn't make it worse as it is what it was about for one of the teams. My rating 7.73/10.

Match Five-Interpromotional Match-Intercontinental Title-Chris Benoit(C)-This was an awesome match and these two always put on a great show. There was high flying action from both men and technical brilliance like always from Chris Benoit. The match was a slightly longer length then any of the previous matches but it was well worth it as it was a great match. I believe these two are another couple of wrestlers who should really be pushed towards the Undisputed Title. My rating 8.90/10.

Match Six-Test Vs Undertaker-Before this match Undertaker was a heel but he turned face after the Un-Americans which include Test were attacking people. People have said this match was boring but I liked it. It was Taker fighting like always for America as he is the ""American Badass"" and Test fighting for the Un-Americans. It had interference but it was worthwhile and it didn't affect the result anyway. My rating 7.89/10.

Match Seven-Street Fight-Shawn""HBK""Michaels Vs HHH-This is the battle of the former DXers. These two are two of the best wrestlers around not just the current time frame but ever. This was Shawns first match back since his back injury which forced him to retire after Wrestlemania XIV back in 1998. These two put on a show and it was a bloody brutal brawl which most people expected. Hopefully this continues for a bit until they finish their feud seeing who the best wrestler is once and for all out of them. My rating 9.52/10.

Match Eight-Main Event-Undisputed Title-The Rock(C)Vs Brock Lesnar-Lesnar had only been in the WWE for five months and he had already made a huge impact and won the King Of The Ring which gave him this title shot. This match had the hard task of being after the HBK and HHH match as it had a fairly inexperienced wrestler in it called Brock Lesnar. The match was a fairly big brawl with the two wearing each other down with submission moves. The end was good with lots of finisher attempts and counters. Hopefully these two get a rematch but not at the main event spot unless Lesnars skills increase. My rating 7.80/10.

This show was a good show and it should show in the results as it got 68.09 out of 80 which is a great result and the percentage for that is 85.11% which is a great mark for it. The grade given from the percentage is an A- which means this is a great DVD and a must have for any wrestling fan. It had many different types of matches and styles with no real bad matches. I believe its a must have for any wrestling fan present or past.",1119657600,,4753,4.591666666666667

SUMMERSLAM 2002:
Kurt Angle vs. Rey Misterio: 8/10
This was a very good opener. A very exciting match and certainly a great performance from both men.

Ric Flair vs. Chris Jericho: 7.5/10
This was better than I expected. Another exciting match that was far from predictable had a lot of near falls. Good stuff.

Edge vs. Eddy Guerrero: 7.5/10
Another good match. It seems that they stepped it up for summerslam. An enjoyable match to watch.

Tag team championship:
Lance Storm & Christian vs. Booker T & Goldust: 6/10
Not a great match however it was not terrible. Well what can you expect from the likes of goldust? Not much. Semi-boring however this was watchable.

Intercontinental championship:
Rob Van Dam vs. Chris Benoit: 7/10
To be honest I actually expected more from this. In my opinion the first three matches were better than this. It just didn't seem very exciting and seeing as they are two of the best in the business my expectations were very high. However don't get me wrong, this was not a bad match by any means.

The Undertaker vs. Test: 6.5/10
I didn't expect this to be an amazing match however it wasn't so bad. A bit boring at times however the end is exciting and better than I thought.

Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H: 10/10
The best street fight I've seen since the 2000 royal rumble. Both men really shine here. Very hardcore brawl. Shawn's high-flying moves make the match very exciting and I guarantee you that you will be at the edge of your seat for this whole match. Amazing stuff.

Brock Lesnar vs. The Rock: 8/10
Not a bad main event. It seemed that what was happening outside the ring was the main attraction. Heyman going through the announce table and Shane o Mac getting destroyed on the outside. The match was good also. Very enjoyable ending with lots of finishers and reversals.

SCORE: 60.5/80 (76/100)
According to the key, I have rated summerslam as 'Great', a first-rate PPV and certainly worth your money. This is very true. There are no terrible matches on the card and they are many top class matches that you will certainly like to see in the future again.",1118880000,,2948,4.335753176043557
1786189,4,B00006LPHG,"A very good PPV event.  Worth buying. Here are the matches and my ratings of them:  (out of 5 stars)

1) Kurt Angle v Ray Mysterio - A very good match, not great.  Alot of quick hitting moves from Ray and submission moves from Kurt.  I've got to hand it to Ray.  He doesn't back down from anybody.  Kurt has his hands full.  A good technical match that should have been longer.  rating - ****

2)  Chris Jericho v. Ric Flair - I liked this match.  ""The Nature Boy"" looks fantastic!  A nice old school match with hard hitting shots.  The right person wins this match.
rating - ***1/2

3) Edge v Eddie Guerrero -  A great match.  Alot of technical moves and submission holds. Very physical.  The wrong person wins though.  rating - *****

4) Chris Benoit v RVD (Intercontinental Title Match)- A very good match.  Two great wrestlers go at it. Benoit uses all his moves.  RVD is relegated to leg kicks and flips.  The wrong person wins.  rating - ****

5)  The Un-Americans v Booker T & Goldust (World Tagteam Title Match) -  A good match with some nice moves.  What THE HELL is Dustin Rhodes doing?  Goldust?  PLEASE!  Dusty Rhodes needs to have a talk with his boy.  Dustin is a great wrestler who can throw-down with ANYONE.  Why is he acting like a S&M alien?  He has too much talent to be wasted like this. A shame.  Anyway, Dustin shows some great technical moves while getting beatup.  The right team wins.  rating - *** (would be higher if not for the exruciating commentary by ""The King"" and Jim Ross)

6)  The Undertaker (AKA - American Badass) v Test - A good match.  Some nice hard hitting action.  Test is a very good wrestler who should get more recognition.  The wrong man wins this.  It was a good piece of propaganda (if you can somehow stomach the nausiating verbage from Jerry Lawler and Jim Ross.  I can't........ PUUUUUUKE) rating - *** (Again would be higher but Lawler and Ross ruin it with their inane talk)

7)  Shawn Michaels v HHH - The return of Shawn Michaels after a 4 year absence.  A very good match. Does Shawn bleed at EVERY freakin' match or what?  A great hardcore match with great aerial moves and blood flows freely.  Check the ending.
rating ****1/2

8)  The Rock v Brock Lesnar (World Champion Match) - A fantastic match.  THE match of the night, but not long enough.  The crowd is split between Rock (30%)and Brock (70%), which adds excitement to the match. The Rock knows how to put on a show.  He is ALWAYS fun to watch.  Some great moves. The wrong guy wins.  rating - *****

An extra match with Brock and Hogan is also on here.  This is real fun to watch as the fans are really pulling for Hogan.  The king is dead!  Long live the king!

What a way to get started! Fantastic match.  Not a single boring spot to be found here.  Two professionals doing what they do best.

Chris Jericho vs. Ric Flair

Also could've been the opener.  Great match.  Only thing stopping this was an abrupt finish.

Edge vs. Eddie Guerrero

Again, a very good match.  Nothing bad to report on this.  Good ring psychology too.

Intercontinental Championship

Chris Benoit vs. Rob Van Dam

A dream match! Contrasting styles that blended perfectly.  I really hope these have another someday.

Tag Team Championship

The Un-Americans vs. Booker T & Goldust

I'm glad the un-americans angle was scrapped quickly.  Very poor taste since it wasn't even a year after 9/11.  As for the match, very good with the crowd really getting involved.

Undertaker vs. Test

A lot of people said this was boring.  No way.  Good big man match.  Taker never really gets respect.

Non-Sanctioned Match

Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H

First meeting between these two.  HBK takes a serious beating in this!  It almost looks real.  Match of the year.  Amazing!

Undisputed Championship

The Rock vs. Brock Lesnar

I can't believe the crowd booed the people's champ!  Just plain stupid.  Shows what they know since Brock screwed all the fans 2 years later.  Match felt rushed but was great.

Ric Flair v. Chris Jericho

  This was another great match.  Jericho and Flair make for a great rivalry.  Y2J wins nerly every PPV match he's in.  Another win to the book. 9/10

  Edge and Eddie can put on a great show at anytime.  Edge continues to dominate Eddie.  8/10

  This was another great match.  Test & Regal lower it though.  Booker puts on a great show but the Un-Americans retain. 8/10

Chris Benoit v. RVD  IC Title

  This was a great high-flying match.  Benoit puts Rvd in a lot of Sumbission holds but RVD reverses the Crossface and hits a Froggie to win the IC Title. 9/10

The Undertaker v. Test

  This is the first bad match of the night.  Test & Taker are leftovers from that whole American/ Un-American thing.  Taker gives the Americans and win. 2/10

1786195,5,B00006LPHG,"Summerslam 2002 was a great effort by all involved with the WWE.  It was probably the best PPV of 2002.

1. Kurt Angle vs. Rey Mysterio

Great way to kick off the show.  This was Mysterio's first PPV match in the WWE.  Unbelievable match.  It is a mix of styles between these two, but if anyone can adapt to another's style, its Angle and Mysterio.  There are a lot of near falls and reversals in this match.  The crowd was really into the match.  Watch Mysterio flip over the ref and nail Angle with on the outside floor.  Second best opening match of a PPV of 2002.  (9/10)

2. Chris Jericho vs. Ric Flair

This match was a bit of a letdown.  These two developed quite the fued on RAW, but the match did not live up to its expectations.  This should have been a no DQ or cage match.  (7/10)

3. Edge vs. Eddie Guerrero

This match was not thrown together until the previous week on Smackdown.  Okay match, but they needed a little more time to build up the fued.  The two would go onto to have a great match at Unforgiven and Smackdown.  (7.5/10)

4. Lance Storm & Christian vs. Goldust & Booker T (World Tag Titles)

Again, this was another great fued.  The Un-Americans angle came off pretty good.  Good effort by all four men.  Test and William Regal both make appearances in the match.  Good spot with Booker T double scissor kicking Christian and Strom.  (8/10)

5. Chris Benoit vs. Rob Van Dam (Intercontinental Title/Interpromotional Match)

Technical classic between these two men.  I was not sure if RVD could put on a good technical match, but he did.  The two worked well together.  The end is a bit of a surprise.  (8.5/10)

6. Test vs. Undertaker

Very good match.  The match was one of Test's better matches in a long time.  There are a lot of near falls in the match.  Storm and Christian make appearances.  (8.5/10)

7. Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H (Non-Sanctioned)

This match was in essence a street fight.  It was Michaels first match in the WWE in 4 years.  He did not lose a step.  A lot of credit has to be given to Triple H becuase he put on a great show as well.  He was so evil in the match.  There is a lot of blood and high spots in the match.  Tables, ladders, and chairs are all used throughout the course of the match.  One of the better matches in the last couple of years.  In my opinion it was the number two match of the year, only behind Rock and Hogan from Wrestlemania 18.  (10/10)

8. The Rock vs. Brock Lesnar (Undisputed Title)

At this point I was not a huge fan of Lesnar.  I did not think he could put on a good match, especially having to follow the match ahead of him.  But, I was wrong.  Rock and Lesnar put on a heck of a match.  There are great reversals and many near falls in the match.  Good spot when The Rock, Rock Bottoms Heyman through the announce table.  A lot of the crowd booed The Rock throughout the match.  Great Summerslam main event.  (9/10)

I recommend this DVD be added to your collection.  All of the matches are worthwhile, except for Flair and Jericho.  The match between Triple H and Michaels in one of the better ones you will see in a while.

Edge V Eddie  **** 1/4 I thought this was better than thier no holds barred match on Smackdown!(were they used ladders). This was a singles match.

Shawn V HHH  **** 1/4 great match and doesn't put all matches of 2002 to shame as stated by other reviewer.

 This was a great opener. Easily the 2nd best match of the night. Counters left and right. Kurt and Rey work really well together. Kurt Angle makes Rey Mysterio tap to the Angle Lock after a long fought battle. ****

 Chris Jericho vs. Ric Flair

 (Walls of Jericho vs. Figure Four)

 This match had great psychology escpecially on Flair's part. Despite his appearance he can still work the crowd. After Ric Flair applied the Figure Four it was all over. ** 1/2

 Eddie Guerrero vs. Edge

 This match was better than worse. Edge's arm slowed the match down. It was still good. I liked the No DQ Match on Smackdown better. Edge hit the Spear on Guerrero for the win. ***

 Booker T & Goldust vs. Lance Storm & Christian

 This match was exciting. After the long period of isolating Goldust from the Book Man was smart. It looked like Booker T had Christian done with the Outside Crescent Kick when an even deadlier kick ended the book, Test's Big Boot. Sadly yet unbelieveably, the referee didn't spot Test leave ringside and made the 1-2-3, having the Champs retain the titles. ***

 Inter-Promotional Match

 Intercontinental Championship

 Chris Benoit vs. Rob Van Dam

 (Stephanie McMahon vs. Eric Bischoff)

 This was great match. As if SummerSlam couldn't get any better. RVD was put in the Crossface at least 20 million times, at least. Even though Chris Benoit is the best wrestler of all time he was no match for the Five Star Frog Splash making RVD a three time champ. Backstage after Eric Bischoff gloated to Stephanie she gave him an evil ""i'm gonna take over the world"" laugh leaving me to think RVD would join Smackdown. *** 1/2

 Test vs. Undertaker

 I didn't think this match was that bad. The action picked kind of early. Despite interference from the rest of the Un-Americans, the Tombstone Piledriver marked Test's grave. ** 3/4

 Non-Sanctioned Match

 Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H

 One of my most anticipated event since 1998. HBK's return. This match stole the show as the Showstopper was resurrected from the dead. HBK put an almost perfect match had it not been for the finish. This is on the best of 2002 WWE Macthes list. A quick roll up was enough to put away the game. **** 9/10

 Undisputed Championship

 Brock Lesnar vs. Rock

 Lesnar has arrived! This match had everything. Heyman ROCK BOTTOMED through the announcement table. Nip tups. Counters. I hated how the Rock was getting booed though. The F-FIVE will be known as one of the most feared moves in wrestling history for it has put everyman down in Lesnar's path, the newest member... The Rock! ****

1786198,5,B00006LPHG,"I started watching WWE Wrestling mid 2001(before JUDGEMENT DAY)and from then on KURTS been my favourite wrestler, he was a heel(bad guy)alot of the time.

REY V KURT -
first opinion
In my opinion the best match of the night. The online quality was bad compared to the DVD I bought. The first part of the match is a classic(it makes my hair stand on the back of my neck), Rey is on fire as well as KURT for a minuit. kurt dilivers a sweet belly to belly and something that looks like a german back suplex but not quite(Snow plex, Al Snows move). REY gave 100% and so did KURT but he wasn't peforming his best. After the match STEPH MC MAHON was impressed and told someone to tell ERIC BISCHOFF to TOP that match.

CHRIS JERICHO V RIC FLAIR - This was better than I thought. It was quite fast paced until they were doing the quite lame submission moves at the end.

EDDIE V EDGE - GREAT match. One of the best of the night. I hated how EDDIE worked on EDGES injured arm, I fast forward the part were eddie has edges arm when on the mat and the match does not look boring. It is good when Eddie does the frog splash on the injured arm and how Michael Cole reacts to it.

BOOKER T, GOLDUST V LANCE STORM, CHRISTIAN - good. Nothing special

CHRIS BENOIT V RVD -
A great match. It needs to grow on to you.

UNDERTAKER V TEST - Okay match. a better match with Test is against Edge at Survivor Series 2001.

SHAWN MICHEALS V HHH - Great match involving tables, ladders and chairs and more. SHAWN shows some great athletesisem when going for a roll up. This in my opinion is overated. People are givin this the top score, if it was out of 5 I would give it 4.3/5. The reason because there's not alot of wrestling involved but alot of weapons used.

ROCK V BROCK - This started good and towards the end the crowd were on thier feet when there were some good countering. That was what another reviewer said but I think it's all good, I fast farward when Brock does the boring bear hug.

I own KING OF THE RING 2001(1 great match, you guessed it the street fight), SURVIVOR SERIES 2001(1 awesome match, elimination tag and the rest are good or very good, it depends how long the matches go on for)and WRESTLE MANIA X 7(atleast 5 great matches with 2nd TLC)and this beats them except MANIA X 7.",1091059200,,2281,4.213302752293578

Giving the belt to Brock was a great move as he is the champ as I speak right now. You won't be disappointed with this one.",1069804800,,578,3.865546218487395
1786210,4,B00006LPHG,"This was a very good pay-per-view.  Though the Rock -n- Brock rivalry was extremely overrated, a good main event none the less.
Triple H and HBK in the Unsanctioned Street Fight stole the show.  What a match!!!!! Triple H and HBK put on one hell of a show.  Their second best effort against one another behind the Survivor Series Elimination Chamber Match.  I say get this DVD for that match and the main event.  It was nice to see Paul Heyman get Rock Bottomed through the Announcer's table.  A good Pay Per View.",1068422400,,514,4.473118279569892
1786211,5,B00006LPHG,"This is one of the best pay per views I've ever seen.
Kurt Angle vs. Rey Mysterio: A great match. Kurt Angle worked very well with Rey's high-flying style. Both men gave 100%. A very solid opener. 9/10 stars
Ric Flair vs. Chris Jericho: Really added to the opening of Summerslam. I love the feud between these two and Ric Flair's constant ""Woo!""'s during the match. Good wrestling for both of them. 8/10 stars
Edge vs. Eddie Guerrero: An okay match; nothing special. This is a good match to get up and go to the bathroom. 5/10 stars
The Un-americans vs. Booker T & Goldust: This was a pretty good match. Entertaining to watch, Booker T with a good spinarooni (as always). The Un-americans pulled off the win for the upset to retain the World Tag Team Titles. 7/10 stars
Rob Van Dam vs. Chris Benoit: The RAW vs. Smackdown! match. A pretty good match throughout. RVD's showed just how much agility he had and Benoit had some pretty solid moves himself.
RVD takes the win and the Intercontinental Championship for the superior brand of the WWE. 8/10 stars
The Undertaker vs. Test: Basically the two wrestlers left over from the American/Un-american feud. A good match. Both wrestlers were a little sloppy, but entertaining to watch. After Taker won, he played to the audience by going into the crowd and holding up the American flag. 7/10 stars
Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels: This is my absolute favorite match of all time. The non sanctioned match and Shawn's comeback match. These two men couldn't have impressed me more. A very long match, these two using practically every weapon that was under the ring. Very good in-ring and out-ring action. I thought Shawn Michaels' roll-up pin was a bad way to end the match, but everybody forgot about that when Triple H destroyed Shawn's spine with his sledgehammer. Followed by very hilarious announcing from J.R. as Triple H left the ring. 10/10 stars
The Rock vs. Brock Lesnar: A very great, very entertaining match with great effort put forth by both men. They really put on a great show. 10/10 stars

I do agree that Brock Vs. Rock was a bit overhyped! True, it was a good match but not great plus everyone and their mother knew that Brock was going to win due to The Rock going to film another movie so it wasn't a big surprise there. Let me go back to the start of the card:
Kurt Angle Vs. Rey Mysterio - Awesome opener. Rey was his usual high flying self but Kurt proved why he's one of the best and most underrated workers in WWE as he can work with nearly anyone of any style!
Chris Jericho Vs. Ric Flair - This was more of a ground match. Nothing spetacular but it didn't suck! Nice to see Flair in the ring as he still has it.
Edge Vs. Eddie Gurrerro - Good match between a future star in Edge and a man that has proven to be a consistent worker in Eddie! Love the Frog Splash on the arm! It looked sick!
Booker T./Goldust Vs. Lance Storm/Christian - Nothing great here other than give Storm and Christian more heat for their tag title reign.
Chris Benoit Vs. Rob Van Damn - One of the best I-C matches ever! It reminded me of the way title matches used to be.
Undertaker Vs. Test - I don't think there were too many surprises here. Just a basic slugfest.
Shawn Michaels Vs. Triple H - Probably the surprise of the night as I didn't except this match to be as good as it was! HBK still has it!

Kurt Angle def. Rey Mysterio This was a great match! Great enterance by Rey with a springboard hurracanrana! Many great moves by both men. Counters, high flying moves, and a whole lot more! I'll give it 8/10 stars
Ric Flair def. Chris Jericho This was a fair match. Not too much to say about it. It seemed both men tapped at different times. It was a very confusing match. I'll give it 7/10 stars
Edge def. Eddie Gurrero This was a highflying, technical, and brutal match. Edge's broken shoulder really weakend him in the match, but he pulled it off. 8.5/10 stars
Tag Team Champions Christian & Lance Storm def. Booker T & Goldust An ok match. The ending was full of crap. They should of ejected Test from the ring! He ruined what should of been a good match. Still, before the ending, it was pretty good. 6/10 stars
Intercontinental Championship: RVD def.(c)Chris Beniot This match was awesome!!! A brutal and highflying match. Great moves and counters by both men! 10/10 stars
Undertaker def. Test A pretty good fight. A more technical match then the edge vs. eddie match. They had nice powerful moves in it. If you love technical and powerful wrestling styles, this is the perfect match 9/10 stars
Non Santioned match: Shawn Michaels def. Triple H This was the best match of the night!!! A hardcore, street fight type match where you can do anything. Both men fought with all they had. The best Hardcore type match I have ever seen! This is a must see match 10/10 stars
WWE Championship: Brock Lesnar def. (c)The Rock Another great match that was about 15 minutes. I thought it would be longer but it was definitly worth watching! The best part about it, PAUL HAYMEN GETS ROCK BOTTOMED THROUGH A TABLE!!!!!!!!! 10/10 stars

1786225,4,B00006LPHG,"This was a good event overall with two great matches and action throughout the near three hours.
Mysterio-Angle: Possible the best opening PPV ever.  Great, great match.
Y2J-Flair: It wasn't the second coming of Flair-Steamboat WrestleWar 89, but still not a bad match with a, shall we say, unusual (but still effective) ending.
Guerrero-Edge: Another interesting match.  They would go on to have a better match a few weeks later on SD!, but this was still another solid match.  No complaints here.
Tag Title Match: No matter how many times I hear Ross say that the Un-Americans made him physically ill, I still get a kick out of it. Probably the least memorable match on the card.
IC title match: I hope this isn't the last time these two are in the ring against each other.  Good match to me (the crowd didn't really get into it-I'll address the fans again later).  I liked it.
'Taker-Test: Test kept up with the Dead Man and the match went back and forth.  The Un-Americans involvement was predictable, but the tombstone 'Taker used sure wasn't.  Good ending to okay match.
HBK-HHH: This match ended up as runner up for Match of the Year, and I have no disagreements with that (or the actual Match of the Year). It's been years since I heard a crowd groan over a back breaker, but when The Game did it to Michales, you could here the crowd voice its concern.  I should have seen the ladder being involved (HBK was in an IC title ladder match in '95, HHH in '98) and the table part was interesting as well. Very interesting ending including HHH smiling despite being covered in blood after the sledghammer shot.
Rock-Brock: Yes, I like the Rock and no, I don't like to see him lose; but what the happy hell did he do to deserve the reaction he got in this match?  I thought they would have rioted if he would have won.  The monster won probably because their is no other way this match could have ended.

1786228,5,B00006LPHG,"Times haven't exactly changed in the WWE as of now, but the WWE was and still is at a transition point.  With The Rock only working a few dates a year due to his blossoming Hollywood career, Austin, who at the time walked out on the company and has only worked one match since re-emerging in the WWE, and declining rates amongst other issues, Vince McMahon wisely pushed younger superstars and or WCW pushovers (i.e. John Cena, Booker T) while bringing back ""living legends"" (i.e. Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash).  One of the better moves that Vince made in 2002 was calling up Brock Lesnar from his farm wrestling promotion, OVW into the big league and pushing Brock as ""The Next Big Thing.""  It led to an astronomical championship match with the hype the size of Hulk Hogan vs. Andre The Giant of WMIII: Rock vs. Brock.  And oh yeah, Shawn Michaels in-ring return at Summerslam was the story of the night.  All in all, a very good pay-per-view, the best since the WWE brand extension.  A rundown of the matches:
1. Rey Mysterio vs. Kurt Angle.  Impressive PPV debut by Rey Rey which cemented his position as a higher-echelon star on Smackdown.  Highly energetic opener that kicked off Summerslam just right. (5/5)
2. Chris Jericho vs. Ric Flair.  Why McMahon nudged Flair to wrestle again is beside me.  Flair has wrestled for 25 years or more and with time and age, Flair has become just as slow as Kevin Nash.  But Jericho compensated nicely to make this match just an okay one. (3/5)
3. Edge vs. Eddie Guerrero.  Edge's mat technique really improved as a singles performer and against one of the best technical lucha libres in the business, Edge performed with flying colors.  When he returns from injury, Edge is ready for superstardom. (4.5/5)
4. World Tag Team Championship: Lance Storm & Christian (Champions) vs. Booker T & Goldust.  Nice pace to this match which elicited a pretty good crowd reaction.  Pretty good. (3.5/5)
5. Intercontinental Championship: Chris Benoit (Champion) vs. Rob Van Dam.  Being a technical mark, this match looked like the Super Bowl or the World Series on paper.  The best technician in wrestling, Chris Benoit against one of the most radical high-flying martial arts-based wrestlers ever seen, Rob Van Dam.  Benoit had taken great control of the mat throughout the match, but RVD gets the duke with his aerial-based attack prevailing in the end.  (5/5)
6. Undertaker vs. Test.  Taker takes down Test and the UnAmericans in what was a match that hit par.  Surprisingly good pace.  (3/5)
7. Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H.  Hands down match of the year. Great storyline considering HBK hadn't wrestled in four years prior to Summerslam and his ties on and backstage with Triple H.  It was the best Trips had wrestled since returning January 2002 and Shawn Michaels?  Well, let's just say he started where he last left off.  Superb match that worked on all elements. (5/5)
8. WWE Championship Match: The Rock (Champion) vs. Brock Lesnar. This match despite the hype was a tough act to follow, but it was a pretty quick bout, clocking in at about 12-14 minutes.  The big highlight was Rock getting booed during the match, which gave Vince the idea to make Rock turn heel when he came back earlier this year before No Way Out and to turn Brock into the next Stone Cold Steve Austin. (5/5)",1053648000,,3313,4.716521739130434
1786229,5,B00006LPHG,"The 2002 card for SummerSlam was probably the greatest line-up in the event's history.  And, the DVD was well packaged for its collectors.  Of course, the highlight of the night was Shawn Michaels versus Triple H in a non-sanctioned street fight.  There are extra features that build toward the match, including HBK's appearance on Byte This.
In addition to that match, other classic matches include Kurt Angle and Rey Mysterio in the opening contest, Edge against Eddie Guerrero, and Rob Van Dam and Chris Benoit in a rare inter-brand encounter.  (For those keeping count, note that the RAW roster won every inter-brand pay-per-view match in 2002.)
Don't discredit The Rock and Brock Lesnar's match, which as predictable as it may have been, served its purpose and marked a tremendous effort by both men.  Likewise, the World Tag Team title match between champions Lance Storm & Christian against Booker T & Goldust was a great match.  The remaining matches between Undertaker and Test, as well as Chris Jericho and Ric Flair would have looked better on a less-impressive card.
The extra features include a match between Brock Lesnar and Hollywood Hulk Hogan, and post-match interviews with Kurt Angle, Booker T & Goldust, Rob Van Dam, Eddie Guerrero, and new Undisputed WWE champion Brock Lesnar.  It has a special (albeit useless) look at the making of the SummerSlam commercial, and the commercial itself.
This year was a rare occasion in which SummerSlam outshined WrestleMania, the Biggest Event of the Year. The only way this DVD would have been better was if they found a way to edit out the time-filler among Howard Finkel, Trish Stratus, and Lillian Garcia, or if they included the post-match promo The Rock cut.  Regardless, this event was definitely a credit to the WWE record books.",1052524800,,1795,5.0

Rey Mysterio vs. Kurt Angle.  This was one of the reasons i bought this DVD.  I thought this match would be good and it was.  Kurt locked on the ankle lock outta nowhere for the win.  **** (outta *****)
Ric Flair vs. Chris Jericho.  This match was ok, I am not too big on this fued.  But the match was pretty good.  Ric Flair wins with the Figure 4.  **
Edge vs. Eddie Guerrero.  Awesome match.  These two really showed their stuff in this match, and it was great.  Edge barely wins with the Spear.  *****
Tag Team Titles: Storm and Christian vs. Booker T and Goldust.  I've only watched this match once.  It was ok from what I remember.  The Un-Americans get the win thanks to Test.  **1/2
IC title: RVD vs. Benoit.  I didn't think this match would be good, but it was.  Benoit did an amazing job and RVD threw in his good moves and you had a good match.  After a LONG fight, RVD wins with the 5 Star Frog Splash.  ****
Undertaker vs. Test.  This match was nothing big.  The only good thing from this match that I remember, was Christian and Storm getting chokeslams, and Test getting the tombstone and Taker winning.  Nothing big.  **
Non-Sanctioned match: HBK vs. HHH.  Just like everyone says, this match stole the show.  This match was amazing, and proved HBK still had it in him, with the Sweet Chin music with the chair, a elbow drop off a ladder, body splash thru table, etc.  This match was awesome.  HBK wins thanks to a roll-up. *****
Undisputed Title: The Rock vs. Brock Lesner.  This match was better than I thought it would be.  These two put on a pretty good match.  I was rather surprised that most the ppl went nuts when Brock won the title.  But the match was pretty good.  ***
The extras include 5 post-match interviews, Brock and Rock's training methods(my fav.), HBk on Byte This, Brock vs Hogan bonus match from SD, The HBK Story, The ""F-5"" video, and the Summerslam commercial, as well as the making of it.

1786231,5,B00006LPHG,"Summerslam 2002 was easily one of the best Summerslams of all time. Every match on the card was decent. Here are the matches and how I thought they were:

1. Kurt Angle vs Rey Mysterio 8/10 Perfect opener for this event. It was filled with fast paced action and got the crowd on its feet.
2. Ric Flair vs Chris Jericho 7/10 I don't get why everybody thinks this match isn't that good.  Yeah, there were a good amount of chops and a few of the moves got a little messed up, but other than that, it was a very decent match.
3. Edge vs Eddie Guerrero 8.5/10 Excellent match.  Nice Bumps taken and overall, a great wrestling match.
4. Tag Team Title Match Booker T and Goldust vs the Un-Americans 6.5/10 Pretty good match.  I think this match is a little overrated. All these men are great superstars and very talented, but I really think they could of put on a better match. It was still better than the average Raw match and certainly watchable.
5. Intercontinental Title Match RVD vs Chris Benoit 9/10 Awesome Wrestling Match.  Technical, High Flying, Brawling, everything. I'm just letting anyone know that if you saw their match on Raw a few weeks before this, its not quite as good as that one.  I thought their raw match topped this one because, believe it or not, there were some slow parts in this match. Even though it didn't top the raw match, it still lived up to the hype.
6. Undertaker vs Test 8/10 This was another match that is very underrated.  Many say that having 2 big men in a match will never be that good. But the Undertaker and Test proved them wrong. And when the Undertaker stood on the turnbuckle after the match and held up the American flag, every fan rose to their feet. It was a classic moment in wrestling history.
7. Non-Sanctioned match Triple h vs Shawn Micheals 10/10 This match blew me away. I'll admit, I'm a Triple h fan. But I didn't care that he lost. It was great to see Shawn in the ring again.  He proved that he can still be the show stopper. This match might not only be the best match of 2002, but the best match of all time.
8. WWE Championship match The Rock vs Brock Lesnar 9/10 Great Main Event. Not only was it a great match, but the cheering shifted back and forth. Sometimes for the Rock and sometimes for Lesnar. It really was a great match.

1786250,4,B00006LPHG,"This ppv was outstanding because of the quality of the matches and the buildup surrounding them. Kurt Angle defeated Rey Mysterio with the ankle lock in an awesome opening match that was one of the top five matches of the year. The Ric Flair-Chris Jericho match was only good because it had Y2J in it. Ric Flair stunk the place out as usual, but won the match with the lame figure-four. Y2J should be in main-events, not suck-matches with geriatric people. Edge's victory over Eddie Guerrero was a very good match and really seemed to launch a long entertaining rivalry that produced many great matches. The tag-team championship match was extremely good. The Un-Americans pulled off the victory over Booker T and Goldust by cheating, which gives these matches their suspense. One question...why the hell is Booker T stuck in the Tag-Team division again??? Rob Van Dam and Chris Benoit put on a five-star classic for the IC title, and Rob Van Dam actually won the contest. Once again...why is another awesome wrestler not on the top of the card? Test...yes Test...the worse wrestler of all time..fought the Undertaker, who kicked major ... in making this a very good match. In his first ppv match since returning to face, Taker lit up the New York crowd and pinned the Canadian goofball Test. The best match of 2002...no the best match since Austin-Rock at X7...Shawn Michaels-Triple H/Non-Sanctioned. The Showstopper and the Game put every match of 2002 to shame.

HBK makes an impressive comeback after a 4 year absence and Brock goes on to prove, why he is the next big thing.  I've read alot of other reviews and I have to agree with them about the Rock.  I can't believe that the rock comes back after a movie and wrestles for about 3-4 months and then walks out to do another movie and keeps doing it in that fashion.

1786255,5,B00006LPHG,"Being one of a growing number of fans getting sick of shock tv just for the sake of shock wrestling tv, it thrills me to see such fabulous wrestling at such a time of desperation. This is either proof that the WWE has given up shock tv(e.i. the HLA, and necrophilia Katie Vick angles) and gone the route of good old style wrestling, or this is the best assemblage of talent on the planet. Either way, after recieving this on X-mas I have viewed it every day. I can honestly say that I haven't even watched Summerslam '97, Wrestlemania 17, Wrestlemania 10, or Final Four In Your House that much. Time to stop boring you with my opinions on business, so now to the real Shizzz:
The Matches:
Rey Mysterio Jr. vs. Kurt Angle
  This was the best ppv opener since Bret Hart vs. Owen Hart in '94. Kurt Angle really made you want to hate him for picking on such a small guy, and Rey-Rey made you stick behind him all the way. Some great spots and good technical wrestling make this the best high-flying match of the year. 5 out of 5
Ric Flair vs. Chris Jericho
  With too little and too poor build up, this match was not expected to be all that great. Suffice to say, we expected correctly. The match was great, though, for a simple technical-chop-fest. Ric Flair is getting too old, and Chris Jericho just doesn't seem to care, but when he is facing such a legend he seems to be a little bit interested. 3 out of 5
Edge vs. Eddie Guerrero
  As far as sheer wrestling goes, the best match of the night. This fabulous psychological warfare would be THE match of the night if the croud were into it more. Eddie Guerrero follows up his string of great matches with possibly his best all year {close to Eddie vs. Edge no holds barred(smackdown) and RVD vs. Eddie ladder{Raw}) This match only starts a fued that would last 4 one on one 5 star matches. Edge IS the future of the WWE, but the future is when Eddie dies. 5 out of 5
Lance Storm & Christian vs. Booker and Goldy
  Great match for a tag match. The work-rate of Lance Storm is unbelievable. The heat was on the un-Americans as they continue their rediculously cliched gimmick. Booker T.(to quote a fellow reviewer) being ""taught another lesson""(c'mon WWE, this guy's gold!) 3 1/2 out of 5
Chris Benoit vs. RVD, IC title
  An all around great match with fabulous high-flying and techniical reversals. Chris Benoit never lets you down in a ppv invironment and neither does RVD. You have to see it to believe it. This match is many people's favorite on the disk, but i have to stick with Eddie vs. Edge. 5 out of 5
Undertaker vs. Test
  Undertaker had a great heel run as champion just a few months before this event. And now he's facing Test? WTF? No offense to Test but Undertaker deserves a more over opponent. Match has it's moments, but the best moment is Undertaker holding up the American flag(almost lifts it up-side-down) after beating Test. Who the heck thought to put a freakin' arm bar from Test half-way through the match? Jeez... 2 out of 5
Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H
  The croud was HOT for this match. whew!!! What a great emotional rollercoaster! This match isn't so great for it's in-ring action(oh, but there is some great action!) but for the crowd interraction. The crowd was behind Michaels as he fought against all odds to wrestle ""one last time""(bull...) and the fans in Ney York were against HHH as he tried to ""Cripple Shawn's [behind]."" Some of the best high-spots in a few years and the most memorable moment of the night(Shawn pulling out the ladder as the crowd goes absolutely NUTS!) Out-of-nowhere finish reminded me of Shawn's classis title defenses in '96. 5 out of 5
Brock Lesnar vs. The Rock, Undisputed Title
  Despite some early bumps by Lesnar, these two put on a quality match which saw....The Rock get booed for the first time in ... a few weeks. He had been booed while facing Ric Flair on Raw, and at Wrestlemania against Hogan(stupid fans.) Lesnar should have been the face going into this match, but i guess it wouldn't have been good for business, right? Well let's all not forget to boo him when he comes back for Wrestlemania 19, because he put on one of his most emtertaining performances in years. You could see those heel like tendencies that made him the best bad guy ever in '98 and'99 in this match. Lesnar is a very promising young star, but you know who is a better rookie? Christopher Nowinski. With all this build up, I was expecting a flashback of Wrestlemania 15(shuddeer) but instead got a match as good, if not better than the main event at Wrestlemania 17.
4 1/2 out of 5
Extras:
hmmm, there were extras? Just kidding, these extras were alright but not any reason to buy the DVD over the VHS alone. Shawn Michaels on Byte This is funny to watch 4 months after the match. I absolutely love the training videos of Lesnar and the Rock, The post match interviews kinda, well, ya know...like a vacuum. You can tell the wrestlers are too tired to think, and just wanna go home. grade: 2 out of 5
Final Analysis:
  You must buy this DVD if you consider yourself a true wrestling fan, even if you quit watching the WWE. It's sure as heck better than any WCW, NWA/TNA, or most ECW ppvs. This one will be viewed many more times, for until I stop watching wrestling.

1786272,5,B00006LPHG,"Summerslam 2002 was one of the great PPV's that WWE put on this year.  I had three favorite matches from this DVD.  Chris Benoint vs RVD, Shawn Michaels vs HHH in non-sanctioned match, and The Rock vs Brock title match.  The only reason Rock was booed out of the building was because he was heading to hollywood to do movies.  The HBK vs HHH match will definetly be a match of the year candidate and even maybe be the match of the year.  There were some other matches but didn't compare to those three especially Jericho vs Flair.  Why would they even put Flair against young talent like Jericho.  That is way beyond me but other than that this PPV is definetly a buy on DVD.",1038182400,,675,4.309523809523809
1786273,4,B00006LPHG,"Summerslam is my favorite PPV of the summer! Right now the WWE has put out some really lame PPVs in 2002. Such as Wrestlemania X8 and King of the Ring. But now the WWE PPVs have gotten back on track, thanks to Summerslam 2002! I gave my reviews on the matches down below.
Kurt Angle vs. Rey Mysterio
Great opener with a ton of high flying moves from Rey. Angle did a great job with this match also.
Chris Jericho vs. Ric Flair
Okay match with a lot of knife edge chops to the chest from both men. I still think that Flair needs to retire, he usually makes his matches long and boring.
Edge vs. Eddie Guerrero
This match started out fast paced, but when Edge injured his arm the match got boring.
WWE Tag Team Championship
Lance Storm & Christian vs. Booker T. & Goldust
Okay tag team match. I couldn't figure out why Lance and Christian where at this PPV. Why was Lance at Summerslam and not at Wrestlemania!? To me Christian and Lance are pathetic wrestlers who don't deserve to be at WWE PPVs. Booker and Goldust saved this match from getting a bad review, even though they lost.
WWE Intercontinental Championship
RVD vs. Chris Benoit
Pretty boring. RVD was really good in this match, but Benoit made the match boring with his Crippler Crossface adn other boring submission moves.
Test vs. Undertaker
Why was Test at this PPV!? Test is also a small star who dosen't deserve to be in WWE PPVs. A lot of people said that this match was slow, but to me this was a fast match with great action. Towards the end of the match the action was even greater.
Non-Sanctioned match
Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels
GREATEST MATCH OF THE WHOLE NIGHT! Forget the Hogan vs. Rock match at Wrestlemania, this match between HBK and HHH was 100 times better than then the pathetic match between Rock and Hogan at Wrestlemania! At first I was dissappointed of this PPV because it didn't have no TLC matches, but I was wrong! HBK and HHH put on a great performance with tables, ladders, and chairs!
WWE Undisputed Championship
Rock vs. Brock Lesnar
Great match, but a little bit short. This was a good match, but the crowds reaction on the Rock ruined the match. I couldn't understand why everyone hated the Rock, knowing that he was the babyface in this match. This was a short and decent match, but Paul Heyman getting rock bottom through the announcers table was pathetic.
Overall this was a good Summerslam, even though some of the matches where boring. I suggest you get this on VHS or DVD, along with Summerslam 2000 and 2001.",1037491200,3,2508,4.4901531728665205
1786274,5,B00006LPHG,"If you're a true wrestling fan then you need to get this video right now. Do like I did and order it off Amazon.com and they will ship it right to you. Believe me, it's worth it a lot. Shawn Micheals takes on Triple H in a non-sanctioned match, meaning that there are no rules, no count outs, no time limit. If you think the match between The Rock & Hollywood Hulk Hogan at Wrestlemania 18 was something, then wait until you see HBK vs. Triple H. These two men beat each other up with chairs, ring steps, ladders, a sledgehammer, a leather belt, tables, and garbage cans. This has to be the best match this year so far. It's bloody, violent, and truly unforgettable. The brutal and distasteful sledgehammer attack following the matchup is NOT for the faint of heart. But this match is truly a classic.  Also, The Rock takes on Brock Lesnar for the WWE Undisputed Championship. This match was also enjoyable, especially the part where Paul Heyman is rockbottomed through the spanish announce table by The Rock. The Rock was booed an awful lot in this match. I don't really know why. But the fans seemed to be more behind Lesnar than The Rock.  The other matches on the card were O.K. but nothing compared to the double main event. Buy this video. It's worth your money. It was certainly worth mine.",1036800000,,1297,4.491525423728813
1786275,5,B00006LPHG,"In keeping with tradition, this year's Summerslam delivered.  Unlike the recent trend in the WWF(E), this event avoided using any gimmick matches but rather focused on all singles matches plus one tag-team title match.  From top to bottom every match was enjoyable with the Mysterio/Angle, Michaels/HHH, and Rock/Brock match as the obvious standouts.  Even Undertaker and Ric Flair in their old age gave very good efforts against Test and Chris Jericho respectively.
As far as WWE DVD's go, this one is excellent compared to their recent releases.  The extras are well chosen and fun to watch (just watch some of the extras from DVD's released during the Invasion angle.)  My only problems with this DVD is that their is some minor pixilazation during the crowd shots and that the WWE is still editing out theme music.  Once again Edge's theme was replaced with his old theme and Ric Flair's music was taken out in favor of generic music.
Besides these minor complaints, this is a great show and deserves a place on the shelf of any WWE fan.",1035763200,,1041,4.820224719101123

Rey Mysterio v. Kurt Angle 8.5/10
great action,great opener everyone will love this one for sure. but you can download this match on Kazaa.
Ric Flair v. Y2j 6.5/10
could have been much much better, i was really looking forward to this one.
Eddie Guerrero v. Edge 6/10
some people loved this match alot, it was ok but nothing we haven't seen on Smackdown.
UnAmericans v. Goldust & Booker (tag title) T 6/10
another disappointment some people loved it but just like a RAW match.
Taker v. Test 5/10
big man slugfest,another disappointment .
Benoit v. RVD (IC title) 5/10
their match on RAW before benoit left was tons of time better, plus u can download this on Kazaa.
HBK v. HHH (unsanctioned match) 10/10
match of the night , no doubt about it! match of the year candidate and most likely The Match of the Year 2002! Table,Ladder,Chair , blood , a grueling war with a not so happy ending. (another u can download on kazaa though)
Brock Lesnar v. Rock (WWE undisputed) 9.5/10
great buildup great match, intense and action packed! Wmx8 flashes in the Rock's head as he is booed again even though he's supposed to be the Face. great match.(downloadble on kazaa 2)

Providing commentary for the Raw brand matches is JR, Jim Ross and The King, Jerry Lawler. Providing commentary for the SmackDown! brand is Michael Cole and Tazz.
Kurt Angle VS Rey Myisterio ~ Fantastic, high flying fast paced action with a great in ring story being told and tremendous crowd reaction.
Chris Jericho VS Ric Flair ~ Good hard worked wrestling match form both Jericho and Flair with a really good controversial ending.
Edge VS Eddie Guerrero ~ Brilliant from top to bottom. Crowd excitement for  Edge and great heat and ring psychology be Guerrero. A solid match up with two of WWE's up and comers.
WWE Tag Team Championships: Booker T and Goldust VS Lance Storm and Christian ~ Fast paced, exciting tag match. Great pops for Booker and ""sick freak"" and great heat for the Un-Americans.
Undertaker VS Test ~ Not like Taker and Test's usually snooze fests this is a good hard hitting, brawler match up. Focussed on the Un-American angle this turns out to be a very enjoyable match.
Inter-promotional Raw VS SmackDown! WWE Intercontinental Championship: Rob Van Dam VS Chris Benoit ~ This is just an amazing technical display with all of RVD's signatures this is a really, really good match.
Un Sanctioned match: Triple H VS Shawn Michaels ~ You have to see it to believe it. HBK after a 4 year broken back absence come back and shows why he is the Showstopa! This match will have you cringing every time Shawn bumps. A great match, a great triumph for Shawn, a great ending and great commentary from Jim Ross.

1786279,4,B00006LPHG,"As the former reviews have stated, it was a cool PPV, i too was in attendance, and was happy to say, at WM in Toronto as well, so I got to see prolly the 2 most anticpated matches of the Year, Rock/Hogan, and HHH/HBK....
About the PPV, I don't know about the DVD, most WWE DVD are pretty well put together, i wouldnt be surprised if there was Alt Comentary from HHH OR HBK, or interviews, i would Say its either gonna be that or Rock/Brock, although HBK's 1st match in 4 years was a little more important, well see though, its worth 4 stars just for the matches...
As for the matches, angle/Mysterio was the Best Match in my opinion, i am not really a Rey Fan, but he is ALOT more impressive Live, and THATS the truth...
I was hoping To see Benoit win, as hes my Fav, but after the 3rd Time RVD got out of the Crossface i knew he was gonna win...
Edge/Guerreo i missed, i was [going to the bathroom], getting snacks and talking to these 2 kids from Upstate NY about recording Techniques i use when i record to Analog...it was predictable anyways...
Taker/test produced the best moment of the night, Taker kicking his as and wrapping himself in an American Flag...
HHH/HBK...just awesome...
But yeah, Rock/Brock, quite honestly, it will suck that the DVD Wont show the 15 minutes or so After the PPV went off the air, Basiclly, 95% of the Nassau Colesium Booed The High Holy Hell out of the Rock, what a GREAT moment, man there was nothing better then standing 1st row off the floor, and hearing the crowd Boo teh Rock Straight out of the WWE to hollywood to film some other movie...which brings me to my last point, the last Image Shown on the Screen in Nassau was a sign a fan made, and it was genius, it said, ""hey Rock...Welcome to YOUR Helldarado"" with a picture of a Tombstone with Rock's Name on it...as a pun on teh fact he was leaving the next day to film some movie...whomever that was...genius....
anyways, well worth the price of my ticket, and now what i am sure will be a Great DVD of it...so if u want to relive the night, id pre order it now!!!  :)",1034380800,,2063,4.28974358974359

7972021,5,B00006LPHG,"Summerslam 2002 is without a doubt one of the best PPV's of the 2000's.  From top to bottom, this card delivered in every way you can imagine.  Aside from what I personally thought was a disappointing main event, there was nothing bad about this event at all.  Here's my review -

1. Kurt Angle vs. Rey Mysterio
I rank this in the top 10 best opening matches of all time.  This is one of many reasons why Smackdown was THE show of the 2002-03 era.  Onto the match itself - Mysterio's PPV debut for WWE saw his high flying lucha libre style match with the amateur wrestling background of Angle, and it made for one hell of a match.  9/10

2. Ric Flair vs. Chris Jericho
Another entertaining bout.  I like this one better than their rematch a month later at Unforgiven.  These two always bring it, and this was no different.  8/10

3. Edge vs. Eddie Guerrero
Call me crazy, but these guys delivered epic matches every time they wrestled each other.  Their series of matches in 2002 are some of my favorites of all time.  I feel like if Edge didn't have that neck injury in 2003, his first World Title would have come that year instead of in 06.  As I said, this match is awesome - Edge always brings his A-game, and Eddie - well, Eddie was, and always will be, one of the greatest performers to ever lace up a pair of boots.  Awesome match.  10/10

4. WWE Tag Team Championships - Un-Americans vs. Booker T & Goldust
I had no problem with the Un-Americans.  My only complaint is that the timing for the creation of the stable was...well, it was too soon.  Anyways, the match was a very good tag team affair.  Certainly not the best, but it's definitely way above average.  Man, who knew Canadians could draw that much heat?  8/10

5. WWE Intercontinental Championship - Chris Benoit vs. Rob Van Dam
An absolute five star classic (no pun intended).  Match of the night so far.  These was a brutal wrestling match that saw these two guys do one simple thing - beat the hell out of each other.  Highly recommended match  10/10

Just for the record, since everyone who does a wrestling review from 2000-07 says something about it, what Chris Benoit did was unjustifiable.  That being said, he made that mistake, and he'll live with it in hell.  In my opinion, Vince McMahon should not pretend that Benoit never existed.  That's childish in my book, and Benoit is an important piece of WWE history, as well as wrestling history.

6. The Undertaker vs. Test
I always thought WWE had big things planned for Test.  It's a shame he was never used to his full potential during his time in the company.  That being said, this was a pretty good match that continued the Un-Americans storyline.  It was a stiff, but entertaining big man contest (similar to Test's match with Kane at No Mercy 2001).  On a side note, this is a PPV match where The Undertaker didn't lose his bandana.  How's that for a rarity?  7.5/10

7. Non-Sanctioned Fight - Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H
If you're trying to introduce someone to professional wrestling, or if you're trying to become a wrestler yourself, watch this match.  Not only is this match a bloody and violent war, it's also some of the best storytelling in a match in WWE history.  HBK proved once again why he's the Showstopper and one of the very best in all of professional wrestling, and The Game proved once again how he's one of the most dastardly heels on television.  Required viewing.  11/10

8. WWE Undisputed Championship - The Rock vs. Brock Lesnar
Disappointing match, in my opinion.  I'm pretty sure people will disagree with me, but hey, that's what the internet is for - to bitch about small stuff!  Anyways, the match wasn't that good.  It might be because it was taking place after one of the greatest matches of all time, or it might be because the match just flat out was not that good.  Brock wins the gold here, and his rise to stardom followed it, which isn't that bad, because Brock put on classic matches following this one.  6/10

As you can tell, I saw the event as an unbelievable card, with every match delivering, sans the main event.  I give SummerSlam 2002 five stars.  Watch it!",1331856000,,4137,4.490591397849462

7972023,4,B00006LPHG,"Want a surefire great wrestling show? Well pick this one up right away, there's something here for everyone.

1. Kurt Angle vs. Rey Mysterio= Great way to start off the show. Fast paced opener, with some great spots and counters. Angle's near untouchable when it comes to wrestling ability, and this was Rey's first PPV appearance, so he had something to prove. And he certainly proved something. The crowd was into this one, and you will be too. 4 out of 5.

2. Chris Jericho vs. Ric Flair= The worst match on this show by far. Chop chop chop chop chop chop chop chop chop barricade slam chop chop chop Figure 4 Leg Lock. There's the match, now you can skip it. 1 out of 5.

3. Edge vs. Eddie Guerrero= Good in ring psychology from this one. Granted we got even better ring psychology from the Benoit vs. RVD match, but this wasn't bad. I enjoyed this, nothing earth shattering, but a good match. 3 out of 5.

4. Christian/Lance Storm vs. Goldust/Booker T(WWE Tag Team Championship)= This match is just there really. There isn't anything exciting going on, and there isn't anything dreadful going on. It's worth a watch, but nothing more. 2 out of 5.

5. Chris Benoit vs. Rob Van Dam(WWE Intercontinental Championship)= Fantastic match. The mat work, ring psychology, submission holds, suplexes and everything else are all top notch. Seeing RVD's name in this might make you believe you're getting a quick paced high flying match. Don't expect that, or you will be disappointed. But if you enjoy good submission wrestling and good mat based wrestling, this one is a treat. 5 out of 5.

6. The Undertaker vs. Test= Basically, if you read my review for the Tag Team Championship match, you can apply the same thing here. Nothing great, nothing terrible. Just there. 2 out of 5.

7. Unsanctioned Street Fight- Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels= This match might not seem like an awesome match to some of today's newer fans who weren't watching wrestling in 2002, but back then, this was something else. You had Shawn Michaels, a guy who was out for 4 and a half years with a back injury, who everybody thought we would never see wrestling again, deliver a match of this caliber. It was unheard of. He hadn't wrestled a match in 4+ years, and he looked like he had just wrestled the night before. That fact alone, coupled with great spots and in ring action, make this an automatic 5 out of 5.

8. The Rock vs. Brock Lesnar(WWE Undisputed Championship)= The hype for this match was tremendous. Did it deliver? Yep. But it didn't exceed expectations. Still, a very good match nonetheless, and a new star was born. 4 out of 5.

Worth checking out for a good handful of matches, really only one bad match on this card.",1280448000,,2706,4.574380165289257
7972024,4,B00006LPHG,"Summerslam 2002 turned out to be one of the best Pay-Per-Views I have watched. I am only 14 years old, so I didn't know the outcome of any of these matches and it felt like this was actually happening today.

Rey Mysterio vs Kurt Angle-
What an opening match! This is about as good as an opener as you'll ever get. Rey Mysterio snuck up from behind Angle in the beginning and quickly created an aerial attack. Back and forth action for the rest of the match until some nice moves at the end for the win. Great Opener.
5/5

Ric Flair vs Chris Jericho-
Wasn't that great to me. Raw didn't put on a great show at all, and this is just the beginning. Jericho dominates the entire match with Flair having his moments, but ultimately, the match was slow and ended too fast. Not a very great match.
2.5/5

Edge vs Eddie Guerrero-
Great match. Edge hurts his shoulder early and Eddie attacks. Throughout the entire match Eddie goes after that shoulder and eventually hits a sick Frog Splash on it that could have ended the match. A couple false finishes and a fair ending. Both superstars hit some pretty nice moves in this one
4/5

WWE Tag Team Championship
Lance Storm and Christian (UnAmericans-c) vs Booker T and Goldust
Let me first start off by saying, I cannot stand watching Goldust. He is probably one of the worst characters to ever grace the world of pro wrestling. But once you get past that, the match itself isn't bad. It is a great tag team match with interference at the end, but it adds to the match in a good way. Booker and Goldust work well as a team and so does Lance Storm and Christian. Only tag match of the night, and it was close to a great match.
3.5/5

WWE Intercontinental Championship
Chris Benoit (c) vs Rob Van Dam
The only interbrand match, RVD from Raw and Benoit from Smackdown, Chris Benoit held Raw's IC title and RVD had to get it back to Raw. This match is a rare match and reminds you of old ECW days. Chris Benoit kept the match on the ground throughout and controlled most of the match. He applied 3 Crossfaces but RVD just kept fighting. For every move RVD attempted, it seemed like Benoit had a counter. Great ground match until the end when RVD finally turns it around. Great match.
4/5

Undertaker vs Test
I didn't really like this match. It was short and interference was made by Lance Storm and Christian. The only reason Test wasn't DQ'ed was because Undertaker pulled them into the ring. Taker cleaned house, chokeslamming them both. Test attempted a chair shot but the Deadman kicked it into his face and hit the tombstone. Not a very got Big Man match.
2/5

Non-Sanctioned Match
Shawn Michaels vs Triple H
What a match! This is the reason I got this DVD and it was amazing! Let me first say that the video before the match is awesome, but anyway, Triple H controls the beginning of the match, working on the back of Michaels. Michaels comes back after a sick Sweet Chin Music and dominates for the rest of the match. Triple H is a bloody mess and HBK picks up the big win. After the match, something happens, I won't ruin it for you. Many weapons were used such as chairs, trash cans, trash can lids, tables, ladders, fire extinguisher, and steel steps. Match of the night. Simply flawless.
Beyond 5/5

MAIN EVENT
WWE Undisputed Championship
The Rock (c)vs Brock Lesnar
First off, before this match they had a really stupid promo with Howard Finkel and Trish Stratus. Just skip through that. Anyway, The Rock and Brock Lesnar put on a great show with some great moments outside the ring and the end was great. Many attempts at finishers occured but were reversed. The Rock hit his Rock Bottom, but Brock broke out. Brock hit a ""Brock"" Bottom and Rock broke out. Many reversals off finishers before Lesnar finally hit his F-5 to become the youngest Heavyweight Champion in the WWE's history. The only problem with this match is the constant interference by Paul Heyman. It took from the match and had me yelling at the TV.

The WWE put some great extras on here. Including post match interviews with Kurt Angle, Eddie Guerrero, Booker T and Goldust, RVD, and Brock Lesnar.

7972025,5,B00006LPHG,"I would put this PPV up in the top 10 of all PPVs that WWE has ever done. Great from beginning to the end.

1. Kurt Angle vs. Rey Mysterio: This match was about 15 minutes of fast paced action. Both Rey and Kurt excel at fact action and there was not a part in this match than nothing happened. Rey proved why he should be a main eventer. Kurt locked in the Ankle Lock a few times before Rey finally gave up. Nice beginning as well. Showcase of two of the greatest Smackdown stars at the time.
Match Rating: 8.5/10

2. Ric Flair vs. Chris Jericho: At 50+ years at this time, Flair proved he could still pull off a good match. I can't say it's a Flair classic, but it is enjoyable. Jericho also puts on a good effort in this match. Flair wins after a Figure Four. I feel this was a clash of two of the greatest personalities.
Match Rating: 7.5/10

3. Edge vs. Eddie Guerrero: One of the matches in their series of underrated classics. This would later be beat by their performance in a Hardcore Match on Smackdown. This fued was one of the better fueds of 2002. As for the match, it was a great 12 minutes, and the action was never slow.
Match Rating: 8/10

4. Lance Storm and Christian vs. Booker T and Goldust: In my opinion, this is the weak link of summerslam. Does that mean it is bad? No. I can't say much about this, but Test interferes and  helps the Un-Americans win. Lance Storm and Christian would later lose the titles to Kane and Hurricane. This match however, is good.
Match Rating: 7/10

5. Rob Van Dam vs. Chris Benoit: This is an underrated classic. Both men put on a good match and proved the Intercontinental Title is worth something other than a mid-card title. Frog Splash after Crossface after counter. Two very contrasting styles that mix well together. The show picks up here, as if the atmosphere wasn't great before. After this match, the show kicks into high speed.
Match Rating: 9/10

6. The Undertaker vs. Test: The atmosphere is great here. I wouldn't call the match great. But, I would say it is enjoyable. There were a few mentionable points in this including where Test shoves the ref into the ropes as Undertaker is going for old school, and where the Un-Americans get involved. Undertaker wins with a tombstone.
Match Rating: 7.5/10

7. Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H: The real question before this match was
""could Shawn still perform at the level he once had."" The answer is real simple. Of course. This match was nothing short of phenomenal. I would put this match into the top 25 matches of all time. Both athletes would learn from this match and go on to have good matches in the future. In my opinion, this should have been the main event.
Match Rating: 10/10

8. Brock Lesnar vs. The Rock: I don't know why, but this seems like a squash match to me. But it was still great. Something I rarely hear myself say. Anyway, Rock sells Lesnar's offense perfectly and got him over as a monster. The one problem I've had with this match is that I feel Brock was pushed way too quick. That really isn't a problem with the match, just an overall complaint. Anyway, Brock uses some nice heel tactics in this one. Not as good as the previous Triple H/Shawn Michaels encounter.
