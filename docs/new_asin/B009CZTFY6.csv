5317109,5,B009CZTFY6,I just got this box set for my dad for X-mas at Best Buy for $19.99. Just giving you all a heads up.,1355443200,4,100,3.391304347826087
5317110,5,B009CZTFY6,"get this particular issue rather than buy those bootleg versions selling at exorbitant prices.
for 60 episodes this is a good bargain with good quality picture remastered from original prints.
a great collection for all western afficionados.",1355184000,,241,5.54054054054054
5317111,5,B009CZTFY6,This Marathon release offers outstanding video and audio quality.  Ageless Gene Barry stars offering his characteristic mix of being cool with sophisticated wit. Packaging is odd and bulky.  Inside the big box are four four standard sized DVD boxes.  A great value and a wonderful old western series has been resurrected.,1354492800,3,321,5.254901960784314
5317112,5,B009CZTFY6,"Being a child of the late fifties and early sixties, this is a show that I fondly remember. I purchased this set at a very affordable price and was pleasantly surprised by both the picture and sound quality. In fact, the quality is as good as any vintage western TV release that I have yet seen. If you wish to see more unreleased TV shows from this era made available, I would highly recommend that you buy this great DVD set!",1353283200,,427,4.283950617283951
5317113,5,B009CZTFY6,"TGG Direct recently signed an agreement with MGM-TV to issue DVD collections of two of the most popular ZIV-produced programs of the 1950s - ""Bat Masterson"" and ""Sea Hunt.""  We were originally told that full-season sets of both shows would likely be offered by early November 2012.  As of this writing, however, this 62-episode ""Bat Masterson"" collection is the only one that has actually been made available.  I have purchased this set and have watched several episodes and can attest that the product is excellent and is a terrific value for the price.  The episodes are uncut and were evidently digitized from properly-preserved 35mm master prints.  The audio and video quality are exceptional for the age of the show.  The collection includes 8 discs in four boxes and the menus are very user-friendly. As a longtime fan of all of the ZIV shows, I eagerly anticipate TGG Direct's other offerings from its MGM-TV licensing agreement.  I recommend this set enthusiastically!",1352937600,25,976,5.0625
5317114,5,B009CZTFY6,"Always rather enjoyed Gene Barry's take on the legendary lawman BAT MASTERSON...  In a way, this suave and self-assured hero was something of a pre-Bond, taking on fatcat villains and their henchmen with both sly charm and macho fearlessness.  Bat a la Barry was both a rugged man's man and a dashing ladies' man, Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang a few years ahead of time, but operating in the old West.  Apart from the pleasures of the show itself, I'm happy to report that the transfer quality of these 60 some-odd episodes is quite spectacular, as they are mastered from the original 35mm negatives.  And although this nifty ""Marathon"" box set doesn't contain every installment of the three-season series, it does have the pilot and most of Season One, and remains one heck of a great value.  Highly recommended!",1352592000,5,807,4.776978417266187
5317115,5,B009CZTFY6,"Considering what is being charged for other classic Western TV series this could be the value of the year! You get 63 episodes of this classic show starring Gene Barry. It's not the complete series. Its about 44 episodes short but for $27 this should not be a big deal. I played several episodes from the 8 discs in this set and they all had outstanding picture and sound quality and were all the full broadcast length. (about 26 minutes). You have to wonder why it will cost you around $100 to get 60 episodes of ""Gunsmoke"" when it's possible to get 63 episodes of this show for under $30.",1352246400,16,590,4.372727272727273
5317116,4,B009CZTFY6,Audio and Video quality are excellent.  This release contains 62 of the 107 episodes.  This collection is distributed by TGG Direct and copyrighted 2012 MGM (who owns the show).  The MGM logo is on the packaging so this is an official release and the picture quality shows it.,1351641600,31,276,4.708333333333333
5317117,2,B009CZTFY6,"It is great to see these shows being released at long last. I hope lots more are soon to follow,but sea hunt and bat masterson are cool for starters. Very very cheap considering running time. Surely this is a dream? I hope this is an official release and that lots more will follow soon.",1351123200,5,287,4.333333333333333

5317119,5,B009CZTFY6,"I was born in 1983, so this show was never on television. I only came across it from my men's studies I've been doing for 10 years. Bat presents a great male role model, a historic virtue of masculinity which no one really remembers. Every episode is a scuffle to which Bat helps solve, but it's how he goes about it, and how he presents himself in the face of danger which really makes this show magical.",1469750400,,405,4.2727272727272725

todays children or even their parents wouldn't know who Bat Masterson was.",1375056000,,303,4.410714285714286

5317139,2,B009CZTFY6,"you have a great imagination.  This series has absolutely NOTHING to do with the real Bat Masterson.  The Wyatt Earp series comes

5317142,5,B009CZTFY6,"4 Stars for a quality western plus 1 star for all of the wonderful memories
 it has brought back to me. Gene Barry was made for the role-just like
Burke's Law and The Name of the Game.  Black-n-White was the venue
of the 1950s but that is how wonderful those memories shall always remain.
It would not be Bat Masterson in Color.  The same applies to Miracle On 34th
Street and It's A Wonderful Life.  With today's technology, I have a better image
better audio quality.  I can now watch this series without commercial interruption.
My old Admiral TV lacked good sound-n-picture quality, when we used the old
rabbit-ears antenna.  When we used the roof-top antennas, the quality was so
much better.  It was a sight to see...the rooftops flooded with antennas.
There are some 107-108 episodes in this series...I aim to make another purchase
to complete my collection.
The Bat Masterson TV Series has a great formula...a character who dresses like
a dude, atypical of a good-guy, with a cane and derby hat.  The pretty woman
who cling to Bat Masterson's looks and charms each week on national TV.
That theme song is one the best I have ever heard for a western.
After this series ended in 1961, my memories remained buried until 2011.
The theme song kept repeating itself over-n-over-n-over again in my head.
That was the resurrection of my old favorites like Hopalong Cassidy, The Lone
Ranger and Bat Masterson.
I'm not concern about the authencity of the presentation of the old TV series.
Simply, it was just good entertainment.",1362873600,6,1528,4.761363636363637
5317143,5,B009CZTFY6,The quality on this DVD was OUTSTANDING ...I wish they would do more of the old western TV programs with the great transfer they did on the Bat Masterson series,1360972800,3,160,4.366666666666666

5317145,5,B009CZTFY6,I really enjoyed this western collection alot. i grew up watching prgrams as these. Gene Barry was great in this.,1360108800,,113,4.7
5317146,3,B009CZTFY6,"It was not as good as I recalled from my childhood.  It is okay, just not as good as The Rebel or Have Gun Will Travel.",1360022400,,119,3.576923076923077
5317147,5,B009CZTFY6,"I was over the moon when I saw this boxset was coming out, as up 'till now, my only source was a desperate pirated copy from China, as I thought it would not come to main stream until I was 150 years old.

This is a must have for any Bat Masterson fan, even when the series comes out in January 2013 (hopefully). The stories will be the same, but to own the 24 Hours boxset will enhance your TV Series collection, and stop the craving, at least for a while, to see the series again.

Bat Masterson's trademark was his gold-knobbed cane, a derby hat, a custom built six shooter and his across-the-waist draw. He was unpredictable, surprising and one of the most colourful marshals and gun-fighters, but never killed unless he had to, and at all times was considered a threat. He was always found where trouble was, or maybe trouble found him. Liked by most men (and especially women), his enemies hated him with a vengeance.

During his life he was an indian hunter, buffalo hunter, army scout, law enforcer and a gambler. His stories are legend, but historians have recorded two versions of how he won the ""Oriental"" gambling saloon.

The American West would not be the same without the exploits of the one and only Bat Masterson, who was one among many to tame the Wild West, but shares the honor of which only a handful are remembered to this day and beyond. Gene Barry's portrayal of 'Bat' was to-a-tee, from his derby hat to his boots.

Although the series will be out next month, I still recommend this boxset to any Bat Masterson fan, old or new alike, and I give this set five stars. I was as inspired by the boxset as I was when the series was on TV back in the 1960s.",1356220800,4,1676,4.37620578778135
