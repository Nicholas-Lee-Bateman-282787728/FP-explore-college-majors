3076148,2,B001242YLG,"This is a great old movie with a wonderful cast. The video quality is about average for movies of that vintage (1935), but constrained by the source material. Unfortunately the producers of this video took advantage of their primary non-English speaking audience and did not pay attention to synchronizing the audio and video elements. If you do not speak English and rely on subtitles, you may not notice that the lips do not move in synchronization with the audio dialogue. I could only recommend this to fans of the genre or of the starring actors who want this movie on DVD rather desperately.",1232236800,5,597,4.805825242718447

3076150,5,B001242YLG,"Classic and very entertaining adventure film(starring Gary Cooper,Franchot Tone and Richard Cromwell and directed by Henry Hathaway) about British Empire building in India and the making of a boy into a soldier and a man. Cooper and Tone are buddies who are put in charge of Cromwell - the inexperienced son of the regimental commander(Sir Guy Standing). Cromwell gets himself captured by the enemy,and,in an unsuccessful attempt to rescue Cromwell,Cooper and Tone are also captured,tortured and imprisoned. The film's exciting climax focuses on the attempted escape of Cooper,Tone and Cromwell. It is sad to write here that superlative adventure films such as ""The Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" are no longer being made. In view of that fact,we should all be grateful that these wonderful(and,admittedly,some not so wonderful) films are available today via the various Vault Collection Series!",1444608000,5,890,5.456521739130435

3076152,5,B001242YLG,"Gary Cooper is a Canadian who has joined the Bengal Lancers. The film tells the story of a British Military unit in Northern India who must protect British interest in India. The movie was made in California and many of the ""Indians"" in the film were native Americans and some real Indian migrant workers.  The acting is great and I enjoyed the story even if it did support British imperialism. The movie has many of the standard collection of British Actors who always do a great job is being British.  I enjoyed the movie.  I remember visiting the fort used in the movie when I was a boy. I took a long time but I finally got to see the movie so many adults were excited about.  This is one of the reasons I liked the film.  Gary Cooper has that talent that makes any move he is in enjoyable.  Cooper is tasked with training two new officers who have just joined the outfit.  One is the son of Colonel Stone, the commanding officer of the fort.  When his son is captured by the enemy Cooper and the other new recruit, against orders go to the rescue.  It was this movie that gave us one of the most remembered lines in movie history,  ""We have ways of making men talk."" Cooper as always is the Hero.  It's a great movie.  I recommend it.",1438992000,4,1239,4.2703862660944205

3076156,5,B001242YLG,"One of my all time favorites, Henry Hathaway's classic adventure tale has just thrilled me again for the umpteenth time. I have been watching this film for a lifetime and it never loses its appeal. The story is tops, the acting sensational, and the photography (especially the shots of the Bengal Lancers doing their thing) is spectacular. Gary Cooper and Franchot Tone are great together and Sir Guy Standing is a standout as the salty old colonel.

8243715,5,B001242YLG,"I love this film because I remember seeing this as a child many years ago on television. Just recently though I learned that  Hitler loved this movie as it showed how an empire with a force of 200,000 men controlled a nation of 300 millions. He wanted to emulate that, probably in Russia. The movie takes us back to the era of the Raj and whilst that period evokes mixed emotions for many, particularly Indians nonetheless it has a good story line and entertains. The transfer of a 1935 film to DVD is very good and the soundtrack is the same. Considering its age, this film holds up well, with some dark humour and of course some dashing action. It is truly a classic and worth looking up. The actors are old for their roles, but that was normal in those days. Of course the film is VERY accurate in depicting the Indian soldiers especially the resplendant Bengal Lancers, and its a shame that modern cinema doesnt make films like these nowadays. Although the pageantry is likely still there, there are no longer the actors of the caliber of Cooper and others of his ilk. Overall its a great movie, with an especially moving finale where a warhorse is decorated instead of his deceased owner!",1501113600,2,1193,4.5488372093023255
