2604262,3,B000GB5M3S,"Kyra Sedgwick turns in a fine performance as a woman obsessed with having a perfect child.  But somehow, the film just plods along without becoming as disturbing as it should have been.",1172880000,2,185,4.78125
2604263,4,B000GB5M3S,"""Loverboy"" is a creepy, little-seen drama that marks the directorial debut of Kevin Bacon and stars Kyra Sedgwick. I wanted to see the movie because I like Kevin Bacon and it's always interesting to see actors trying to direct, I knew little about the synopsis, and whether you love or hate this movie...I doubt you'll forget it afterwards. This is a creepy movie, that could be creepier in different hands but Bacon takes a film that has echoes of movies like ""The Virgin Suicides"" and every other ""mother who loves son way too much"" movie and saves it from becoming a soap opera. Sedgwick gives a dynamite performance as Emily, a woman who desperately wants to have a child. Being neglected as a child by her Romeo & Juliet-like parents (played by Bacon and Marisa Tomei), she wants to have a perfect child whom she can be with for the rest of her life. When she finally conceives a baby with a man (Campbell Scott) during a one night stand, she moves as far away from other people as she can and begins to raise her son Paul whom she dubs ""Loverboy."" As Paul gets older, he begins to want to go to school. But the outside world overwhelms Emily and she desperately tries to keep her and her son together. A movie with incestual overtones and one of the more haunting endings I've seen out of a film from 2006, ""Loverboy"" is not a film that will appeal to the masses. The film is not perfect, but it is good and Bacon is a good director who worked with a great cinematographer on the film. The movie has a lot of atmosphere to it and features some beautiful cinematography and art direction. The script is very well written, because it does come very close to going over-the-top. This material is difficult to handle without it becoming a farce and it's handled really well (after all the screenwriter's last name is Shakespeare, so it better be good right?). As for Sedgwick, she gives an incredible performance that didn't gain a lot of notice. She narrates the entire film and as a person who is not incredibly fond of voice-over, I was surprised to find how creepy it is. Sedgwick doesn't just act in this film, she gives a PERFORMANCE. She really gets into the soul of the character and doesn't make her unbelievable for one second. I'm not sure what message the film is trying to send, if it is trying to send, but it hits home during the ending. The movie has a lot of famous (and good) actors in it including Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, and Oliver Platt to name a few. As I said, not a lot of people will like this movie. But IT IS well done and worth the watch. I guarantee you'll be thinking about the ending days later.

2604264,3,B000GB5M3S,"Kevin Bacon's debut as feature film director has gifted actors as the cast: in addition to Kyra Sedgwick who plays the overprotective mother, the film has cameos from Matt Dillion, Campbell Scott, Oliver Platt, Sandra Bullock, Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon himself. No wonder someone thought of ""Six Steps to Kevin Bacon"" game.

Kyra Sedgwick plays Emily, a possessive mother who would not let her only son Paul or her ""Loverboy"" go outside the world she created for him. But as Paul grows up, he refuses to stay where he is now, disobeying his own mother. He wants to go to school (Emily wouldn't allow that); he wants to live like any other kids in the neighborhood, and so on, but the mother who loves her son too much sees things differently.

That much I knew before watching the film, but `Loverboy' proved to be also another thing to me. Kyra Segdwick's character is at times treated with upbeat touch especially when she is trying to be pregnant, and her character is interesting to see at first with some humor in her. She is not particularly sympathetic, but the script at least attempts to delve into the inner darkness or loneliness behind her beauty and confidence, and it succeeds to some extent when Campbell Scott briefly appears before her in a hotel room.

But here is another thing I didn't expect, and that's frequent flashbacks where Emily's childhood is depicted. The film reverts to the days when Emily was a lonely ten-year-old girl (played by Kyra Sedgwick's own daughter Sosie) over and over again, and the portraits of Emily's swinging-70s parents (played by Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon). The repetitious scenes never convince us why the husband and wife who love each other so much should neglect their own daughter, or why she must seek for help in her neighbor Mrs. Harker (effective Sandra Bullock).

My impression is that for all its short running time (that is less than 90 minutes) `Loverboy' tries to show too many things in it. We don't need slant camera angel or Kyra Sedgewick's sexy dress here (do we?) when it is her character that really matters. The film's tone is often inconsistent (some scenes are a bit too silly to me) with its intricate narrative style, which should be more simple. I really like Kyra Sedgewick with her acting (or overacting) in this film, but its story can be more effectively told in the right order.",1168214400,3,2368,4.740291262135922
2604265,1,B000GB5M3S,"How could Kevin Bacon or the screenwriter give any dignity to this character?  She was horribly abusive in how she imprisoned her son - not to mention that she damn near succeded in her attempts to kill him.  What she did to that little bird has haunted me for weeks - and not in the way great art does.  Bacon leaves the question open: Did she brutally murder the bird because he took her son's affections away from her?  Or, was it a mercy killing?  Nice try.  When you're flush with cash like she was, there are vets around to check broken-winged birds out.  Even if you don't have a dime, there's the ASPCA.  Her son honors her at the end, like she was some model maverick. If only someone had done her in - but slowly, like the tortures she'd inflicted on the defenseless - instead of her deciding on her own that her job was done here.  I have a high threshold for pain and intensity in movies, but not when the filmmaker is asking us to revere the lowest scum.",1165104000,10,967,4.240437158469946
2604266,3,B000GB5M3S,"Since I pretty much agree with the others' assessment of the good acting but storyline faults, just wanted to add that we had issues with the sound.  The soundtrack often drowned out the soft-spoken narrative by Kyra Sedgwick and other actors - when compensating for their quietness, the music would then blast out anything they had to say.  Never saw where the subtitles were accessible, so we missed the nuances in the dialogue.  Otherwise a decent flick, but the sound/dialogue mix was frustrating.",1161043200,2,501,5.0120481927710845
2604267,3,B000GB5M3S,"Sometimes even when a movie is competently made and features fine performances, you have to wonder - ""Why was the story ever written and what should we feel about it?""

That's the problem with Kevin Bacon's LOVERBOY.  Starring his wife Kyra Sedgwick (THE CLOSER), this film is a tragic, bitter look at a mother's obsessive love for her son.  An overly theatrical narrative by Kyra lets us know right away about her sexual promiscuity, moving from city to city and even using the sperm bank to mother ""the perfect child.""  When a chance encounter with a handsome businessman finally results in her conception, she gives birth to Paul (whom she calls LOVERBOY).  Paul is a bright, sensitive child and well played by Dominic Scott Kay.  But mama's love is unusually abnormally obsessive; she doesn't want to share him with anyone and ultimately makes him almost a prisoner.  Little Paul, however, wants a father's love and wants desperately to be normal.  Much of the action takes place inside a car and it isn't long before you can pretty much predict where the film is going.

Sedgwick gives a dark, disturbing performance, but she's not likeable and attempts at justifying her behavior don't really condone her actions.  There are a lot of ""cameo"" style performances from Blair Brown as a neighborly neighbor; Matt Damon as a handsome fisherman who tries to give Paul some masculine attention; Campbell Scott as the father whose one night stand produces Paul; Sandra Bullock as a mysterious neighbor lady whose relationship with Kyra is never fully realized; director Bacon and Marisa Tomei are seen in flashbacks as Kyra's weird, hippie parents; and Oliver Platt is a school worker with interests in Kyra's odd behavior.  Bacon captures some wonderful images and the movie is certainly earnest in its presentation, but it's such a downer I can't fully understand what the movie's purpose is.",1160092800,6,1892,4.974603174603175
2604268,4,B000GB5M3S,"Kevin Bacon directs this bizarre story adapted by Hannah Shakespeare from

Victoria Redel's novel about maternal obsession providing his wife Kyra Sedgwick with a role to spotlight just how fine an actress she truly is.  The story is disturbing but vitally interesting.  There are problems with the film, the most annoying one being that the dialogue is practically inaudible due to the miking and, more so, due to the musical score which covers all the lines to the point of making the movie seem like a silent movie with music from the pit!  Such a shame, because it SEEMS like this is a good script with a lot to say.

Emily (Kyra Sedgwick) is damaged goods, a woman neglected as a child who is determined to have a baby and raise it on her own, lavishing the child with all the affection and attention she desperately missed.  After numerous attempts to get pregnant from any available man, she finally succeeds impregnation with Campbell Scott and gives birth to Paul (Dominic Scott Kay) who becomes her entire reason for living.  She sequesters Paul form the world, gives him everything a child could want - except association with peers.  Her obsession grows to the point of mental illness and the results are devastating.  Along the way Emily and Paul encounter people who seek to intervene in their lives: these people are played with great style by cameo roles of Sandra Bullock, Oliver Platt, Kevin Bacon, Marisa Tomei, Matt Dillon, Blair Brown and even some of the Bacon's own children!  It is a star cast obviously committed to Kevin Bacon's vision of this star vehicle for Sedgwick.

The pacing, cinematography, and acting are all first rate.  If only the ugly and senseless music hadn't submerged the dialogue (oddly enough the score was written by Michael Bacon!), this would be an Oscar contender.  Grady Harp, September 06",1158796800,17,1840,4.840255591054313

2604289,4,B000GB5M3S,"First, I am not sure why Sandra Bullock is solely credited for this movie, she appears in it for all of about 15 minutes.  She has closer to a cameo appearance than that of THE star.
Secondly, this is an odd movie with quite an underlying darkness throughout it. Odd doesn't make it bad, just...odd.  Kyra Sedgwick is very good in this role; her obsession with getting pregnant with the perfect child and subsequently with raising the child is believable and very disturbing.  Her real life daughter, Sosie Bacon, plays the child version of her in the flashbacks to her youth and her real life husband, Kevin Bacon, plays her very disturbed father in the same flashbacks.  He is almost unrecognizable in this role.  All do a very good job of being extra weird in this film.  I keep referencing how odd/weird the movie is, but it is one of those odds that you just can't quit.  So odd that you (or at least I) had to see through to the end just to see if it could make sense.  It doesn't really but the perfect child balances out the weirdness.  He accepts that he and his mother are ""different"" with no apologies but he is very vocal about how he longs to just be a normal boy and live like normal boys live.  A point which more than irritates his mother.  I think since she was little more than a slight distraction for her father as a child, it drove her to become obsessed with being her and her child being the entire world to, for and with each other.  When her son, Paul refuses to accept that, it pushes her just over the bat-sh*t crazy line of demarcation.  The film ends much the way the movie has progressed (no spoilers here) her making really odd plans for the two of them but the curve ball of normalcy shows up when she expects it the least.  Watch it and see for yourself.  It would be interesting to watch with a small group of six to ten people to see their reactions.  Just roll with the crazy as it is the unseen character in the movie.",1463529600,2,1955,4.300546448087432

2604348,2,B000GB5M3S,"Together, for the first time since starring together in the 1991 Slacker Hit ""Singles"", Kyra Sedgewick, Campbell Scott & Matt Dillion head a B+ cast of old Box Office Draws to bring us this uneven and ultimately unsatisfying melodrama..

I really like everyone in the film, and I think everyone did what they could with an uneven and unemotional script. Sedgewick is one of those actresses who is very talented and very underrated, but she has a habit of picking bad movies - especially if husband, Kevin, is directing it. This may not be his fault though, since the material he was working with was flat, but it is the director's job to overcome those objectives and tell a coherent, competent & interesting story that allows viewers to empathize with at least one of the characters in the film... I didn't feel any empathy, and it felt like a bad CBS Sunday Night Movie from the mid 90's... and I didn't catch many of those for obvious reasons.

I didn't hate ""Loverboy"", but I expected more substance and depth, especially from a cast like this.. The DVD cover also quotes the LA Times blurb: ""Fatal Attraction for our time"".... Okay, I dunno about all that..",1344124800,4,1162,4.663414634146341

2604351,4,B000GB5M3S,"""Loverboy"" bears no relationship to a classic comedy of the 1980s, that starred Patrick Dempsey as a young man pursuing older women as a means of paying his college tuition.  This film is based upon Victoria Redel's 2001 psychological novel about a neglected girl who smothers her child with constant attention because she felt unloved.  ""Loverboy"" is a portrait of a loving obsession taken to its darkest end.

Kyra Sedgwick is excellent as she plays Emily in the film ""Loverboy"".  Emily, as a child was ignored by her parents, played by Kevin Bacon and Marisa Tomei.  Emily's parents were solipsistic, living like  newlyweds whose honeymoon never ends.  Unfortunately their rapt attention to each other leaves little love for Emily.  Emily's parents die in a suicide pact, leave her financially independent, and advise her that ""It would do well to find a passion"".

Emily decides that her path to happiness is having her own child, as a single mother.  Having a child, her entire focus is upon her young son Paul (played brilliantly by Dominic Scott Kay).  Despite a fairytale existence of constant play and adventure, Paul matures rapidly and begins to question why he is denied what he sees other children experience.  His questioning leads to rebellion and stress.

""Loverboy"" is an excellent movie, but it is not for everyone.  The plot and characterization develop psychologically.  This film is not action packed nor suspenseful.  It is not comedic nor romantic.  ""Loverboy"" causes one to meditate on the meaning of marriage, family, and parenthood.  I recommend this film only for viewers willing to look deeply into its implications and analyze its social ramifications.",1283040000,7,1681,5.117647058823529
2604352,5,B000GB5M3S,"I rate this movie 4.75 out of 5.  One half a point is for Sedgwick being so hot... so that leaves it an 4.25 on the normal scale. (Sedgwick is very very hot)  But since I couldn't give it a 4.25 or a 4.75, I gave it a 5 to compensate for all the people who gave it a 3.  I just can't give it a 4.  In my opinion this is film... something beyond a movie.

The writing and acting for both Sedgwick's part, and her son (in the movie)'s part were both very very good.  Though some of the supporting parts are not up to the level of the lead parts, the plot was good, and movie absolutely held my attention.

This is a memorable movie in spite of being almost silly in parts... .  The movie is about Sedgwick's life as a child and about her life with her son.  The scenes with her parents in childhood are not done in a serious tone.  It's not comedy, but less than serious style.  I don't know the right word to describe it; but it probably disqualified the film from any kind of an award.  But that is the film.  Maybe I just didn't get that dimension.  Or maybe it just didn't work as visualized.

SPOILER ALERT!

She had a lot of empty pain and loss in her childhood.  She clung to the little bit of closeness that a neighbor provided, and one day, that neighbor was just gone.  That might not send everyone over the edge, but things like that absolutely do send some people over the edge.  She couldn't handle the separation from her son because she was already a mess.

MORE SPOILER ALERT:  DO NOT READ THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE FILM !!!!!!!

The question is....  why was he on the ground?  Did he put himself there, or did she put him there.  I hate it when authors leave such things open, but I also love it.  If you don't like the final final scene, then perhaps you could reconsider it in the light of answer B.  Maybe she put him there.  And maybe he knows that (which he would).  So, as he looks back on his life, he knows his mother was a little nuts, but that his mother did love him deeply.  Good thing to know, to hang on to, in that painful aftermath.  Is that such a horrible or unrealistic ending?",1281312000,4,2123,4.1048780487804875
2604353,4,B000GB5M3S,"This is not the first Bacon/Sedgwick film about a disturbing slice-of-life topic.

Both Loverboy and The Woodsman give the audience much to ponder afterwards. Disturbing topics often overlooked.

While I admire Bacon's grit in showcasing hard-to-look-ats in society, I did not have an easy time with this film. Which I suppose is exactly the point.

Many times I found myself angry, even disgusted with Emily's smothering attempts to fill the voids in her childhood. I found myself alternating between cheering Paul's growth of independence and very definite spurts of outrage at Emily's behavior. Add to the mix the loneliness and ignored needs of the child Emily - my thoughts and feelings were all over the place. You must ask yourself - is this an accurate snapshot of how neglected children might parent their own?

Again, as in The Woodsman, one has to step back and remind themselves not to judge too harshly, asking ""how would I have dealt with this if that were my story""?

Much to think about.
Anger, compassion, sadness, gladness - a curious, mixed reaction to a film that while I cannot say I enjoyed, I certainly could not walk away from.",1259193600,4,1429,5.366071428571429

2604356,5,B000GB5M3S,"I rented this movie on a whim because I remembered the trailer being pretty interesting. Let me just say that I was not disappointed. Kyra Sedgwick was brilliant as Emily, and I was really able to identify with her. As a mother of a two-year-old boy, I found the first three-fourths of this movie to be oddly inspiring. Possibly due to my young age of 21, I've never wanted to be the typical soccer-mom so I found Emily's eclectic style of parenting to be rather appealing. For example, the splatter-painting Paul's room, camping out in the backyard, the 'roam abouts', etc. One of my absolute favorite scenes is where Emily plays an invisible flute in the rain as Paul conducts (if anyone knows the name of the song, please let me know). On the other hand, Emily's obsession went off the deep end towards the end of the movie and you can actually see her just going over the edge as Paul pushes for more independence.  All of that being said, I think that it's much easier for a mother to sympathize with Emily rather than condemn her in the end. This has definitely become my favorite movie just because it is so different, and so sadly beautiful. I also picked up the book a few weeks ago, and it was wonderful as well.",1185840000,10,1222,4.455357142857143
2604357,4,B000GB5M3S,"I had no idea this movie was based on a novel.  Had I known that, I would have read the book first.  It was a very dramatic film but is not a complete downer.  It had a bittersweet ending which took me by surprise, although the first segment of the ending is predictable.  I would have preferred to have the ending the same way it happened in the book, but Kevin Bacon decided to change it to show the beauty and value of the relationship between Kyra Sedgwick's character and her son Paul.

Basically, this story is about a woman who grew up being neglected by her parents and demonstrates what can and does happen when the child grows up.  Neglecting children is often worse than physically abusing them.  One of the strange things about humans is that whatever terrorizes and tramatizes us in childhood, becomes a source of attraction later in life.  In this film we see a woman who was tramatized by neglect from her parents (physically, emotionally and mentally).  Her parents always put her down, embarrassed her, showed her hardly any affection.  Her parents were so close to each other yet so far from her.  As the little girl becomes a woman, she becomes a loner or an outcast and is eccentric.  When she has a child by some random man she hooked up with, she becomes close to the child, yet so far from him.  So far from him in that she doesn't care about his true feelings and doesn't care about him as a person and this is the same thing which traumitized her as a child (neglect).  All she is wants from him is love... forever.",1181001600,6,1540,4.414893617021277
