8710490,5,B00VKWIHN4,"Great Training aid I love Rhys's ""Gentleman Warrior Self Defines System"" the techniques are easy to masters with close ups, narration, slow motion, various angles and step by step guides, his style is also very effective. Rhys also mentions in an interview that his style is based on various martial arts he studied in his life especially Kempo Karate that he was taught for over 10 years by a British police office (and British police do not use guns so rely a lot on there fighting skills) who is also his current grandmaster. Rhys also teaches various fighting stances against various street attacks including knives, Guns even from different angles e.g. front and back (if you were at a cash point and someone put a gun or knife in your back) bottles, clubs, grabs, chokes, punches and kicks, I can't wait to get his next training DVD'S ""Gentleman Warrior Defense System Volume 2, Tonfa, Tonfa Single and Double for Realistic Street Self Defense"" and ""Gentleman Warrior Self Defense System Volume 3, Kubotan and Torch for Realistic Street Self Defense"". God Bless and stay safe (With this DVD you will).",1439856000,,1107,4.862433862433862
8710491,5,B00VKWIHN4,A well put together self defence DVD which shows a variety of different scenarios where self defence can make a difference. The demonstrations and the slow motion help a lot so you can see exactly how to use the techniques and learn. Nothing is rushed here.,1439856000,,257,4.608695652173913
8710492,5,B00VKWIHN4,"Some great stuff here, you can tell Rhys's knows his stuff. Most martial arts these days don't go into as much detail as this for street self defence, but Rhys fills the gap very well. A great buy.",1428796800,,197,4.2105263157894735
8710493,5,B00VKWIHN4,"Fantastic Training Video, exactly what I was looking for, being a lady martial artist. I love this DVD because it shows you in depth on how to deliver the techniques and the self defense application against various attacks including, Guns, Knives, Bottles, Clubs, punches, kicks, grabs and chokes. and Rhys explains every technique and skill very well with narration, slow motion, various angles and close ups. I also have his second DVD of the ""Gentleman Warrior self defense Series"" (""Tonfa"") I would highly recommend to.",1428796800,,523,5.1647058823529415
