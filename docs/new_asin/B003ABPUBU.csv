8392949,1,B003ABPUBU,My husband and I watched this movie together.  He lasted 15 minutes; I watched it for 30 minutes.  This should never have gone anywhere but the trash.  It's the epitomy of a low-budget film in that it's boring to the point that the confusing plot wasn't worth trying to figure out.,1327968000,5,281,4.470588235294118
8392950,1,B003ABPUBU,"I can easily explain how this was ""underrated"" enough to go straight to DVD ... it's crap!  I realize it's a low budget film, but I've seen many low budget films that are well written and well acted and this is not one of them.

I was bored but kept watching the film, expecting to find that it was really some kind of science fiction story with time warps, after the line of dialog:  ""He must be about my age now.""  How is that something that any normal person would say?  What universe does this story take place in?  People behaved in completely weird ways that weren't explained - I couldn't relate to any of it.

The best thing I can say about this movie is it was short.",1283299200,6,676,4.1937984496124034
8392951,5,B003ABPUBU,"I've watched this a couple of times now, and can't get over how under-rated it must have been to go straight to DVD. For an independent movie I could easily see this doing well as any of the film festivals - either way, it's a really well made, understated movie - I highly recommend it.",1280448000,4,287,4.236363636363636
