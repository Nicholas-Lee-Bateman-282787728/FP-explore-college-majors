I believe their are two solutions to this problem. A socially responsible one, and a personally responsible one.

Until the social responsibility develops, I'm preparing my kids to be personally responsible. I should not have to. A kid should have the right to attend school without having to defend himself or herself. There are so many skills to learn without have to spend time, energy and money on self defense. But its the world we live in.

Bullyproof is not about learning to beat someone up. It is about learning to deal with bullies in a way that gets parents and teachers involved, teaches and helps a child practice verbals skills to end the bulling without physical confrontation whenever possible. At the same time it preserves a child's personal right and responsibility to defend him or herself if psychically attacked.  The child knows what to do and how to act in a situation that other wise leaves them uncertain and at risk to hurt someone else or risk being hurt themselves.

The physical self defense technique are designed to ""control"" the attacker without injuring them. If the techniques are practiced and applied, neither the victim or the bully should be injured if the bully attacks.

Bullyproof teaches kids the ""rules of engagement"" so dealing with a bully is done in a deliberate and thoughtful manner.  I have found practicing these techniques (both verbal and physical) with my two small boys is a rewarding experience as parent and lots of fun for the kids.",1360022400,,1537,4.843511450381679
