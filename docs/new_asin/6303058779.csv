I got tired of telling people about all of the great golf shots I've hit over the years so I had this film crew follow my around for 36 holes to capture the greatest shots in the history of the game. I'm not going to lie, I put on a freakin clinic on this video. There is this one shot where I ride a motorcycle and while going 89 mph, hit a 295 yards drive that splits the fairway. I do all kind of things on this video. There is one shot where I tee up a 12 pound bowling ball and drive it 187 yards with a pitching wedge. This video also follows some of my greatest tournament moments under alises I have like Tom Watson and Jack Nicklus. I am the inspiration for many young golfers because I'm so much better than most people at the game. One day J abs and I were driving in Bartlett and stopped at Ferret Oaks for a quick 18. These two guys wanted to play us in best ball and wanted to bet us their wives they could beat us. It was truly hilarious. We both goofed around for 8 holes playing one handed, hitting the ball with a pencil or with a ferret chasing us. So we're behind and these tools want to double up and include their homes. We really didn't care what we won because it's all in proving that other people aren't anywhere near your equal. I have nice homes and hot women around me all the time. These dork's wives wouldn't mean a thing to us and neither would their tiny 5 bedroom home. This was simply a chance to do a favor to these guys by letting them know that the Nook and J Abs were 84 times the man they could ever be. Well, we won the rest of the holes by hitting 10 straight aces and they asked if we could let the bet slide. We simply asked them, ""do you realize you just witnessed how far below us you are?"" They just nodded their heads and started crying. Sometimes you have to learn the hard way, but you will learn where you are in comparison to us.",1128038400,,1910,4.015748031496063
