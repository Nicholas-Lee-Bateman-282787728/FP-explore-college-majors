7842023,4,6303218717,"Baseball - Inning 9, Home (1970-1994) is two hours, twenty-six minutes and fifty-five seconds long and original aired on September 28, 1994. Inning 9 starts off like the past eight innings following year by year time frame, but later in the seventies it skips entire years. 1980-1984 are non existence in this inning and the series ends year wise 1992 not 1994. We start off with the Baltimore Orioles winning the World Series, Curt Flood losing his case in the Supreme Court about the century old reserve clause and slumming attendance in the game. Great players like Jackie Robinson and Roberto Clemente pass away. Hank Aaron was more relieved then excited about breaking Babe Ruth home run record. Game 6 of the 1975 World Series is probably one of the most exciting games in baseball. Marvin Miller finally abolishes the reserve clause. George Steinbrenner buys the Yankees from CBS and becomes one of the most hated men in baseball history and literary brings down the Yankee Empire. Pete Rose breaks Ty Cobb's records of most lifetime hits and winds up getting banish from life from baseball for gambling. The owners try collusion to try to keep their stars. Babe Ruth curse is still with the Red Sox in the 1986 World Series. Kirk Gibson with bad knees hits a home run in the bottom of the ninth inning of the first game in the 1988 World Series to help keep the Dodgers alive and win the World Series. In 1992 the World Series becomes a World Series when the Toronto Blue Jays win. The series end with some final thought about the game. Since Inning 9 did jump around a bit and found it confusing when it did; I can only give Baseball - Inning 9, Home (1970-1994) a B+

7842024,5,6303218717,"By the time you get to the final ""innings"" of Ken Burns' celebrated ""Baseball"" documentary it is so strange to see the game played in color, you are so used to the black & white photos and film of the earlier volumes.  We are now up to the point where we clearly remember Hank Aaron breaking Babe Ruth's home run record and Carlton Fisk's body language keeping the ball fair in Fenway Park.  This is also the period where the players finally break the reserve clause because of the example of Curt Flood and the efforts of Marvin Miller.  The highpoint of this documentary was when Jackie Robinson joined the Major Leagues, so it is fitting that Robinson's funeral is covered in this episode.  ""The Modern Era"" also deals with skyrocketing salaries, the egos of players like Reggie Jackson and owners like George Steinbrenner, drug use by countless players, the banishment of Pete Rose for gambling, and other elements that threaten the National Pastime.  But it also has Ken Griffey Sr. & Jr. hitting back-to-back home runs and children playing the game on the local sandlot.  By the time he concludes his epic documentary, Ken Burns has brought us full circle.  Bottom line: You should watch ""Baseball"" every spring and give yourself hours of happy memories.",986083200,,1260,4.805555555555555
