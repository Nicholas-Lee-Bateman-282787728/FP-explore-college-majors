6583120,5,B00MIA0HJE,"The Jeffersons  How exciting. Everyone is always complaining about the cost of shout factory and other producers of the greatest old shows. If we want these wonderful old programs that our fit for the whole family to enjoy we are going to have to pay for them. We complain that they are not released or when only half of the seasons are released we complain about the extras and the price. Welcome back Kotter, WKRP, The Bob Newhart show, Annie Oakley and of course the one and only Batman 66. Lets stop complaining and say thank you for giving us TV we can enjoy with our grandchildren and not have to screen every minute. Welcome George, Weezie and Florence I can not wait to sit back and eat popcorn and icecream with the family and laugh and laugh. Thanks SHOUT Factory and Amazon. SGT. Bilko and the Jeffersons all in the same month. WOW.  Lets start trying for the Beverly Hillbillies, Green Acres and Petticoat Junction complete series.  Thanks. I would rather pay the price for classic TV on dvd then for cable and shows that are awful.",1407456000,18,1044,4.542553191489362

6583122,5,B00MIA0HJE,"This is an excellent tv series! The theme song alone will have you dancing and singing to its tune BEFORE you even have time to see the 1st episode!

It's basically about this man named George Jefferson, who has worked his way up out of the ghetto and into a high-rise apartment on the Upper East Side of NYC. He's the successful businessowner of a chain of dry cleaning businesses and this tv series follows him, his family and their sarcastic, witty maid's comical situations.

I highly recommend it! While it's dated as in from the late 70's and early to mid-80's, the jokes are timeless and so are the great messages!

Buy it today because you'll find yourself hysterically laughing!",1407456000,9,687,4.661157024793388

6583129,5,B00MIA0HJE,"Note: I saw every episode save one with XFinity On Demand.

All two hundred-and-fifty-two episodes of the iconic television series THE JEFFERSONS are finally available for free with XFinity On Demand. A spin-off from ALL IN THE FAMILY, THE JEFFERSONS quickly established itself as a separate situation comedy, with loveable characters and good clean family fun. George, Louise, and Lionel Jefferson truly moved on up 'To A Deluxe Apartment In The Sky.' Every episode has side-splitting comedy, and

Unfortunately, these days, the series would be seen as racist and offensive; but who gives a rat's tail what those people think? Only an idiot with a brain the size of a cottonseed would think there is anything offensive in this series. The show is great fun. One of the funniest episodes where Florence dresses up as Aunt Jemima, and begins talking like Prissy in Gone With The Wind, but looks more like Mammy from that classic photoplay. And that's just a taste of the rip-roarin' Good Times to be had watching the show. Again, I repeat, there is NOTHING offensive in this series. The only episode I skipped is the one where George's friend is now a transwoman, whatever that is; it's disgusting.

I highly recommend this series.

Some people complained about the video quality. It`s not crisp but it wasn`t so abd that it was jarring. It`s basically what I expected it to be.

Its grainy and the closer you are to the tv, you can see how blurry it is,  almost as if it were transferred from vhs tapes. I have several of these later episodes that i taped from cable and attenna stations that are more crisp and clear than most of the episodes presented on this set. Even the first 6 seasons are of better quality on the original dvd releases than what you will find in this box set. Thank goodness i only spent under $50 on this set. Thats all its really worth.

What makes it worse is when they try to incorporate drama and be 'relevant' in social justice.  It's garbage.  If you want the best balance of comedy, with some drama, all rolled into a classic tv show from the 70's, spend your money on something worth your hard earned dough, like MASH, which has depth in characters and social relevance.",1450742400,,489,4.329670329670329

6583233,5,B00MIA0HJE,"Norman Lears groundbreaking sitcom THE JEFFERSONS (1975-85) remains a classic TV comedy. After premiering in January 1975, CBS brought The Jeffersons back in the fall of that same year, running it on Saturday nights before shifting it to Mondays in January of 76. While the show took some time finding its audience (CBS kept shuffling it around the schedule during its first few seasons), The Jeffersons continued to keep the laughs on coming as it further settled in, developed its ensemble cast and premise of an African-American drycleaner named George Jefferson (Sherman Hemsley) whose success enabled him to move on up to a deluxe apartment on Manhattans East Side.

Having grown up on the re-runs and later seasons of the program, I can say that Ive grown quite fond of watching the series on DVD, especially now that Shouts 11-season DVD box set completes the entire run of the series. The ability to rewatch the program as an adult, at my leisure, on disc makes the purchase of the box especially worthwhile, and The Jeffersons is one of those shows thats perfect to pop in the player and watch an episode or two for a few laughs. The timing of the cast and the various comic situations were perfectly exploited during the shows long run, and while the programs cast made it a groundbreaking sitcom in its time, few other shows have ever surpassed it for sheer belly laughs and overall fun. No other series, for me, has been able to tap into important social and economic themes like race and class while maintaining its sense of humor the way George and Weezie did over its decade-long run.

DVD BREAKDOWN: Shouts terrific box-set offers 4:3 full-screen transfers from the original videotape masters stored at Sony. Extras are contained on a bonus disc, featuring the All in the Family episode that introduced the characters; an episode from the short-lived 1981 spin-off Checking In which tried (and failed) to launch Marla Gibbs maid Florence into her own show; the pilot of E/R, a sitcom that featured Elliott Gould, guest starred Sherman Helmsley and sported a young George Clooney in the first of his two ER series stints (the second decidedly more successful than this one); a retrospective featurette; and a booklet with an essay from critic Tom Shales.

One of the best TV-on-DVD box-sets of the year, this is a must for Jeffersons fanatics, even if you may be forced to leave the beans burning on the grill picking up the set at its current price.",1425427200,5,2465,4.808962264150943
6583234,5,B00MIA0HJE,"So far, so good! I watched this as a kid and of course didn't realise until many years later, how politically incorrect the George Jefferson character was and how much 'reeling in' Weezy (Louise) had to do lol. Still so very funny, this series, after almost 40 years. Just don't take Mr. Jefferson TOO seriously when he 'offers' his insight into women and interracial couples (geez!) and maybe you won't feel like killing him lol-this definitely wouldn't see the light of day in today's tv landscape which is sad in a way. TV has lost some of its authenticity and edge I think because of this. Product came in on time and as described.",1425254400,7,635,4.578947368421052

6583237,5,B00MIA0HJE,"I love the Jeffersons!!! I love them soo much!!! This is such a classic show and it stands on its own for many reasons!  I remember first watching the Jeffersons when I was little when it was in syndication and fell in love with it instantly. I just loved the chemistry that Sherman Hemsley and Isabel Sanford had! They really carried this show along with Marla Gibbs and the rest of the supporting cast!

This show is so funny and filled with lots of laughs that comes naturally. It did have its serious moments too that made you think, feel, and laugh all at the same time. Some people would compare this show to Cosby for certain reasons, but the Jeffersons and Cosby were not the same in my opinion. I like Bill Cosby but I felt the Cosby show wasn't as funny as the Jeffersons. It makes you wonder why the Jeffersons lasted longer than Cosby.

Thanks to Norman Lear for creating the characters of the Jeffersons on All in the Family and giving them their own spinoff show! I never thought that the rest of the seasons would be released on DVD, but thanks to Shout Factory for stepping in and finishing what Sony had started!

All the episodes are uncut and restored as they should be! The bonus material adds to this set nicely. Also thanks to Shout Factory for deciding to release the remaining seasons individually for people who already have the first six seasons.

Either way Shout Factory deserves a lot of credit for releasing shows that we thought would never see the light of day or be complete. Maude for example is own its way in a complete DVD box set which I can't wait to own too!!!",1422057600,12,1600,4.428571428571429

6583240,5,B00MIA0HJE,"What needs to be said about this classic show? From the 70s to the 80s, this show ruled TV sets across America as Americans couldn't get enough of George, Weezy, Florence and the memorable cast of the Jefferson's. Too many memories and too many favorite episodes, but I always loved the exchange between Mother Jefferson with Louise and George with Florence. The series actually started off more serious and dealt with heavy topics, but as time passed on the show became lighter.

It's a shame it took Sony YEARS to release Seasons 1-6 and then suddenly stopped. Sony has never treated the Jeffersons with proper respect. They never allowed the cast to have a final goodbye and this show deserved that opportunity. It was too important. It's also sad all the main cast (except Marla) has passed on because I would have loved their commentary. Thankfully, Shout Factory has rescued the Jefferson and has released this boxed set. I already have Seasons 1-6, but I purchased the box set anyway and its worth it. No complaints...just glad to see the cast again and full of life.",1421366400,16,1074,4.774193548387097

6583259,5,B00MIA0HJE,"Before reading my review I did want to say I am white fan.

I love The Jeffersons Sherman Hemsley always cheers me up. I used to drive me ex husband crazy when I watched this show because I would laugh so loud really loud I hardly every laugh out loud when watching TV. But Sherman Hemsley always makes me laugh. Sherman Hemsley is one of two actors that always cracks me up. The second is Roseanne Barr.

*Spoiler*
This is such a classic show. I love scenes with Sherman Hemsley & Marla Gibbs. In season two it cracks me up when Florence tells George to ask her how she got to work and he says I know how you got to work you flew over on your broom. That is my favorite scene from season two. It's from the episode Florence Tries To Kill Herself.

I also love it when George calls Tom Willis a Honkey.

All though I am thrilled Shout Factory is releasing the complete series I just wish they would individually release seasons 7-11 so I don't have to re-buy the same six seasons again. I also hope they will lower the price. After all Bewitched has the same number of discs 33 and its $29 on Amazon. Please lower the price Shout Factory. I could handle paying $100 for the complete series. The series has dropped from $219 to $155 please lower it to at least $100 Shout Factory. This is one of my all time favorite shows.",1413331200,24,1322,4.234126984126984
6583260,3,B00MIA0HJE,"When are you releasing individual seasons for those who already have seasons 1-6.  I don't want to spend money on the seasons I already have.

6583261,5,B00MIA0HJE,"The five stars rating I'm giving here is for the show, since this product has yet to be released as of the date of this review.  But instead of wasting your time with another comment on how great the show is - I have to presume you also feel this way, otherwise you wouldn't be reading the reviews of this product - I wanted to comment that years after I first discovered The Jeffersons, I was surprised to learn that the actress who played Louise Jefferson (Isabel Sanford) was, in real life, 20 years OLDER than the actor who played George Jefferson (Sherman Hemsley).  I don't know how old the characters George and Louise were supposed to be on the show, but I'm sure if there was an age difference it was a few years at best, and if anything George would probably be older than Louise.

Of course, in real life there are married couples where there's a significant age difference between husband and wife, but you don't expect to see it on TV where the actress playing the wife is just about old enough to be the mother of the actor playing her husband, but the characters are similar in age.

The fact that Isabel Sanford didn't ""act her age,"" as it were, yet I never thought she was trying to ""act young,"" is a testament to her ability and talents as an actress.

(EDITED TO ADD: During later seasons, random bits of dialogue in various episodes indicate that Louise was, indeed, younger than George.  And, adding to this whole ""age ain't nothin' but a number' thing, there's a 1980 episode where George's 50th birthday is celebrated - whereas in real life Sherman Hemsley was 42 on the day that episode aired.)",1411689600,8,1618,4.48639455782313

6583273,5,B00MIA0HJE,"I was only a child when I discovered ""The Jeffersons"" on daily syndication and it became, for me, the best African/American sitcom ever, even bigger than ""The Cosby Show"" (which I never watched).

 Finally, with all the TV trash that proliferates our television screens with talk shows, court shows and those miserable reality shows (I mean how many times can you watch people eat worms or make fools of themselves on those stupid sing shows or whatever they are called?).

 Now this box set is an example of what television use to be like. Here we have a beloved sitcom that ran on CBS from 1975-1985, won Emmys (deservedly for Isabelle Sanford) and became one of the most beloved series ever. In this one set we get all 253 episodes  uncut and cleaned from their original prints.

 This is s 33 DVD set with bonuses including the famous ""All in the Family"" episode called ""The Jeffersons Move On Up"" that served as the pilot for the show, an exclusive documentary on ""The Jeffersons"" , an episode  of the ill-fated Marla Gibb's spin-off called ""Checking' In"" and a special episode of ""ER"" which features Sherman Hemsly  playing George Jefferson.

 For the ardent fan of the sitcom be on the look out for the October release of Norman Lear's boigraphy which will feature how Lear created the series and how he made it into a classic!",1410912000,36,1334,4.6581196581196584

6583275,5,B00MIA0HJE,This is a very funny show. Ive watched it since I was a kid and its rarely gone off the air until recently unlike the show its a spin-off on which is also very funny. Thats just a little bit ironic since George Jefferson can be thought of as the black Archie Bunker. There are a lot of good not to mention funny episodes in this show and you should get it like I did.,1410393600,5,367,3.9066666666666667
6583276,5,B00MIA0HJE,Love the series and have seasons 1-6 when they were first released..I would love to get this but the price HAS to come down. I am sorry but what are we paying for? There is nothing speical here. Just all 11 seasons crammed into an outer box..... Most series get a release for 50.00  As I once said ....who cares about the special boxes. I would rather have all the discs thrown in those spindle boxes and pay cheaper then spend 206 for this and its nothing special either. If you don't like the spindles buy one of those case logic books which store 350 DVD al lin seperate cases and throw the spindle out....They need to STOP doing this. With the popularity of TV SHOWS on DVD today people own so many series ( I know I have over 100 Full Series) but will not fork out 206 for one show when I know a cheap version of it wil be out later or if this goes down at least 100 bucks.  They get you all around..They release season sets and then a complete series so if you want to save space on a shelf you re-buy the whole show. Double Dipping is too much!!,1409270400,5,1052,4.101941747572815
6583277,5,B00MIA0HJE,Thank you shout factory you guys are awesome. It's completely worth $206 considering it's like 11 seasons. I would buy it at $300 because I love the show....,1409097600,3,157,4.642857142857143
6583278,5,B00MIA0HJE,Once again Shout Factory comes in and saves the day! Finally after Sony just stopped caring about their older shows Shout Factory stepped in and saved the Jeffersons from being a incomplete series. For complainers this is a complete series set not a season set plus shout is a smaller company which means they need their titles to make a profit just as much as bigger companies. Now all they need to do now is get the rights to Sherman Hemsley's other sitcom Amen and Marla Gibbs show 227 and that would be triple great for me and fans of those shows.,1408579200,9,551,4.411764705882353
6583279,5,B00MIA0HJE,The rating is for the show itself!  I do agree that it stinks for us people that own the first six seasons that we have to rebuy them again but it will be nice to have the entire show.  And just a quick note to those of you complaining about the $160.99 price for the complete series.  If you take into consideration that there are 11 seasons that breaks down to less than $15.00 per season and that is actually pretty cheap for a complete season of a tv show these days.,1408320000,,471,4.0978260869565215

for each of the season 7-11. Still a fair price after waiting all the time! Shout! Factory now says they will be a slight delay in the release date from Nov. 18th until Dec. 9th. After waiting all this time I don't mind that. I've already pre-ordered my copy.
I hope a lot of you will order copies. This will be a wonderful Christmas time gift for a lot of people I'm sure.

No other company has taken the leap to reproduce this great TV Classics! I for one am thankful SHOUT dose this. If it wasn't for SHOUT FACTORY I wouldn't have many of the TV classics in my Video library that I do have. This box set is ddifficultto find and cheapest from 3rd party sellers. Yes, they want a lot of bones for it but in my opinion all three bones I spent was worth the purchase. Get it if you want it and can afford it. Appreciate the fact someone put it on DVD for us to enjoy. In my opinion the quality isn't bad for an original copy that hasn't been messed with. The audio and video is good for something from the 70's and 80's and arrived as expected. My DVD's worked with no issues on my blu ray.

I did not see this til 5 months later as I was laid up in a hospital anyways I need a number to contact to get a replacement disc as this one episode either skips and freezes up or does not play at all and I tried it in several players. Otherwise all the other discs are fine and I love this show. They don't make programs like this anymore.,1522195200,,446,3.966666666666667

8672590,5,B00MIA0HJE,"I loved George and Weesy Louise Jefferson. The rags to riches story parallels my own in many but not all ways. I went from a lower middle class life to enjoying my time in a deluxe apartment in the sky. The Jefferson's gave me hope growing up that I as a black autistic man good build a life for myself better off materially than life in the ghetto.

The comedy was good and the social commentary was fine too. Some shows were extremely good and heart wrenching while still fun and funny. The stories have a very dated 1970's feel to them which is not a bad thing. The Jeffersons share an America that could exist if racism in its current and past forms went away for good. Some would say George has a racist chip on his shoulder and any black man who has moved on up understands that George is just a clear eyed realist.

While George Jefferson is played somewhat over the top he still rings true where it counts. His wife Louise Weasy is the moral compass that keeps George from fully indulging his hyper vigilant excesses.  The cast is rounded out by Mr. Bentley a lovable Brit across the hall and the multi racial Willis Family! It is stupid weird how I have the same arrangement in my life for real but that's a story for another day! This is an awesome opportunity to own the Jeffersons on DVD without commercial breaks to be seen whenever you want which is why I buy DVD's.",1511481600,3,1380,4.32046332046332
