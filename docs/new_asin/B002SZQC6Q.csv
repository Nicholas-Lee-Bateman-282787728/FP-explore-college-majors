8379729,5,B002SZQC6Q,Great way to get both tales. I have a region free DVD player and this is the way to go for those of us who like international cinema. The price for the two is lower than the price for each here in the states. Same extras and the lot and good transfers just like here. This set is a fun one for Who fans and the only ones with the robot Kamelion in them. Good fun entertainment.,1488067200,,377,3.909090909090909
8379730,3,B002SZQC6Q,"While the DVD is fine, and I enjoy these episodes, this box set didn't specify that it was Region 2. Lucky one of my devices can run region 2. Others won't be so lucky. Other box sets specify if they are region 2 only, this one should too.",1458345600,,239,4.0
8379731,5,B002SZQC6Q,"A good combination of stories involving The Master and the morphing android Kamelion. . Kamelion was pretty lousy due to the issues they had with the robot in real life but the concept worked well since Kamelion could morph into another character played by a real actor so they didn't have to actually use the troublesome android very much.

The first story is ""The King's Demons"" which takes place on Earth in 1215. It's only a two parter but is well written and keeps your attention. The Master is fiddling with historic events and the Doctor is there to stop him, The extra feature on the Magna Carta is excellent also.

The second story a four parter called Planet of Fire which takes place mostly on the planet of Sarn with a little in the first episode taking place on Earth in 1984. This is an excellent story with several significant attributes that add to the story. It was one of the rare on-location episodes that took place outside of the UK. It also sees the departure of Turlough as well as explaining his back story. The next companion Peri is also added during this story. There is also a revised Director's Cut"" as part of the special edition of this story with some unused footage being used as well as now CGI effects.

Overall this a a great addition to any Doctor Who collection.",1452729600,,1300,4.523404255319149
