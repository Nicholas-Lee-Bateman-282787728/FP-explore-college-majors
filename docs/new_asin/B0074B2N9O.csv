5053974,3,B0074B2N9O,"Twilight Zone Fan Favorites and Twilight Zone More Fan Favorites.  Classic series, classic episodes, but what gives?  ""Eye of the Beholder"" and ""Living Doll"" are constantly listed among many top 10 lists on the internet.  Google ""Top Ten Twilight Zone Episodes"" and you're likely to come across those two episodes again and again and again.  So where are they here?",1415318400,5,365,5.033333333333333

5053976,1,B0074B2N9O,Had to buy a all region dvd to view this product. This and A LONG HOT SUMMER were not for Australian region to view.,1397606400,,116,3.875
5053977,4,B0074B2N9O,I like it one because some of these are favorites of mine. Many of Rod Serlings epidsodes had a commentary that is even relevent to today. That's why I gave it 4 stars. Writing like this is absent today because the emphasis today is more on entertainment and less on giving food for thought to the viewer.,1389571200,2,305,4.368421052631579
