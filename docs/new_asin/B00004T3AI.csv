1349636,5,B00004T3AI,"I saw I remember Nelson on TV many years ago, and never saw it again until I got this DVD. It is a strong, well-acted series that is a study of heroism, and is very historically accurate. I liked how four different people had their views of Nelson shown. I found the quality of the DVD very good.",1413244800,2,296,4.120689655172414
1349637,3,B00004T3AI,"The story is long on his personal life, the wife/girlfriend and short on naval history. Having said that, I thought the final scenes were really well done-the destruction of the french fleet in the action where Nelson was killed. A lot of detail of the working of the individual gun crews on the lower decks during the battle--this was great stuff!",1379721600,4,348,4.721311475409836
1349638,3,B00004T3AI,"I had excepted more of a story line rather than a straight documentary.  I think it would be difficult to keep students' attention in such an ""informative only"" format.",1357776000,2,168,4.793103448275862
1349639,5,B00004T3AI,"This superb series chronicles various aspects of Nelson's life as he might have been seen by those close to him as well as the common seaman.  Brilliantly acted by stock BBC actors at the time in the early 1980s you won't find a better quality production.  Sure, it might be lacking some hi-tech stuff for today, but the acting and screen writing is superb.

The series mostly touches on Nelson's latter period just before and including Trafalgar.  We see him through the eyes of his first wife, Sir Hamilton, Captain Hardy and finally just a common seaman at the great battle.  These individuals enable us to see different sides of the great hero's life.  What this series shows was that Nelson was a lively, socialable person who enjoyed diversion and sensual delights.  The rigors of naval warfare in the Napoleonic period had certainly taken its toll on his first marriage which is touchingly seen in the first episode.

How Nelson met Emma Hamilton is the subject of the 2nd episode which takes us back a number of years in time to the mid 1790s.  Here we find England was trying to support the duchy of Naples against the Napoleonic tide of invasion in Italy.  There is a devastating portrait of the petty Bourbon King and Queen who ruled the duchy in this period.  We also meet Sir Hamilton and through him see how Nelson get to know Emma.  Those who are use to the more elegant portrayal of Lady Emma Hamilton a la Vivian Leigh from the 1930s might be in for a shock here.  This Emma is a bit more pleasantly plump, but is more sensual and earthy and probably  a more accurate look at her.  We certainly get to see the interesting relationship that developed between the three of them.

How Nelson and Emma were seen by one of his naval captains is the subject of the 3rd episode in the series.  The domestic bliss at Merton comes across as rather odd to the stiff-necked Captain Hardy.  Here we meet as well one of Nelson's syncophants who seeks to use the great man's name to advance his own personal designs to obtain a royal peerage.  Hardy is disqusted by this, but here again we see a human side to Nelson as he reveals his debt situation to Hardy.  We learn also the innovative tactics that Nelson will employ against the French in the upcoming Battle as well.

The final epsisode is probably the most impressive and moving of the series.  How a common seaman lived below decks on HMS VICTORY and fought as a gunner during the great battle.  Here we see how Nelson appealed to these poor, common wretches and inspired their actions at Trafalgar.  Again, no state of the art special effects here, but the clousterphobic conditions and the suddenness of death at the hands of random solid shot crashing through the decks is brilliantly shown.  The last scene shown many years later is particularly moving.

This is a brilliant little series.  Here we see how great men of their times have all the same follies as the rest of us.  We see also how others seek to latch onto them regardless of the circumstances in order to shine in their light as well.  Nelson was a brilliant naval strategist, and an inspirational leader.  We see him in all his faults and glory here.  There is no better portrayal of the man and the period out there.  The DVD should tack on a Nelson Bio and some BBC production notes but that is a minor quibble.  Nelson/ Emma fans should enjoy, as well as fans of the Age of Sail.",1322697600,14,3412,4.504885993485342

1349641,1,B00004T3AI,"I got this DVD expecting a film depicting Nelson the war hero depicted by those closest to him. What I got was a film showing how Nelson was a amoral adulterer who happened to be good at naval combat. The film only depicts his life after the battle of the Nile, which leaves out much of his career, and the vast majority of the film consists of his tattered home life, his sexual exploits with his mistress, or him trying to excuse his actions to the captain of his flagship. I did enjoy the combat scene they did have, as it did have an effective depiction as to what life was like on the ship for the average seaman. Over all the acting was good, but the content left much to be desired for those looking for a military history, but you like your soaps this may just be for you.",1234051200,9,780,4.172185430463577
1349642,1,B00004T3AI,Theatrical and not very historic.  More like a soap opera than a profile of his life and exploits,1220659200,3,97,4.388888888888889

1349644,4,B00004T3AI,"Very accurate portrayal of portions of Nelson's life.  The Battle of Trafalgar tape is the best battle renactment I have ever seen.  The quality of the tape recording, however, is poor.  Rather than using the standard speed for each of the four one-hour episodes, the production is recorded in extended play.  At that speed, the entire series could have been put on one two-hour tape (holding six hours of information at the slowest speed).  This was a disappointment considering the price of the recording.",1041379200,19,507,4.988095238095238

When he was using another appendage for his thinking, chaos ensued.
This presentation visualized this condition perfectly.
His life and his legacy are brilliantly depicted in this film.",1486166400,,267,5.090909090909091
