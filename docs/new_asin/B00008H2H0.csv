1847097,5,B00008H2H0,The Life and Passion of Jesus Christ / From the Manger to the Cross is a DVD with two films. The first one is a French silent film from 1905 and depicts the life and death of Christ. The film is done using Pathecrhome. An early technique used for tinting films. The second film is a 1912 American Silent film directed by Sidney Olcott. The difference between the two films is huge. The second one is filmed on location and not on a stage. Gene Gauntier plays the role of the Virgin Mary. In the 7 years that has passed between the two films the early film industry has advanced rapidly and from a stage play it has truly turned into the modern film that we know and enjoy. A very thoughtful and spiritual film. A very price worthy DVD that I highly recommend. 5/5.,1343433600,,764,4.275862068965517
1847098,2,B00008H2H0,"This is a silent film. I read that it's one of the best. I seen some of it. And graphics wise it's good. There are two movies on one disc. And the first one is really old, 1905. It's ok. The second one is better in picture, and there are words to be read not annoying so. But often. Great acting. If I could I wouldn't by this one again. Yet, I am a half glass full kind of person and the music is good very short for a little over an hour. It's what they did back then. I would look for a better one if I were you.",1333756800,,515,3.690909090909091
1847099,4,B00008H2H0,"(3 1/2 *'s) Primitive, coming from 1902 and 1912, these two early Jesus movies are a meditation.  Because the details aren't fussed over like modern renditions, the audience can actively go along with the journey.  The first film has fine costumes and sets, and it should be said that the actor looks more like Jesus than any film before or since.  (If you take the passage that ""He bore no resemblance to draw us to him...an appearance which made men turn away,"" to light.)  There is earnestness in the first film, which uses skillful appearances and disappearances of angels, stars, and Jesus Himself.  The second film is more praiseworthy.  They use less stage settings and use terrain suitable for a biblical landscape.  The acting is far more impressive with Jesus's passion, Magdalene's appearance, and Mary's humble radiance--above most silent films.  A quiet contemplation, both movies are a spare start to cinema meant to make a difference.  It also is draw those who wish to see the genesis of cinema.",1176163200,3,1011,4.93491124260355
1847100,1,B00008H2H0,"Even though this film is a collectors item and over 100 years old I can not give it away fast enough.  I changed my mind after I purchased it wanting to return it.....rather pricey...but being curious I opened the package and watched it.  I really wanted to like it.  But I will give this treasure away.

I will keep my newer Jesus films.  I was conned by the kinder reviews of others.",1142640000,3,385,4.291666666666667
1847101,5,B00008H2H0,"This DVD contains two wholly remarkable films based on the life of Christ, two of the earliest feature films ever made; as such, this DVD should be of great interest to silent movie fans as well as Christians.  Each film showcases its own remarkable style of cinematography, but both surely communicated the message of Christianity very effectively to their original audiences.  It is amazing that both of these films actually survived all these years, yet not only did they survive, they look absolutely fantastic, much better than any other silent film I have ever seen.

As I write this, The Life and Passion of Jesus Christ is celebrating its centennial.  Begun in 1902 and completed in 1905 by Pathe Freres in Paris, this film, which runs some 44 minutes in length, is made up of 31 fascinating tableaux chronicling the life of Jesus from His birth to His ascension.  The quality of the film, restored from two 35mm original prints, is nothing short of astounding.  You won't find any characters' faces bleached out, and there are no serious jumps or foreign artifacts cluttering up any of the shots.  You really wouldn't know you are watching one of the oldest feature films in existence by the look of the presentation; in fact, you might find yourself scrambling to verify that 1905 is the correct date of the film when you see parts of it presented in color.  You need not fear that Ted Turner has gotten his hands on this print, however, as Pathe Freres actually came up with a technique to apply up to four colors to prints way back in 1903 - what you see here is basically the very same thing audiences saw a century ago.  This film is so old that it doesn't even feature any dialogue cards - just title cards introducing each of the tableaux.  As such, parts of the story may be hard to follow for anyone unfamiliar with the life of Jesus.  The acting itself features a lot of gesturing; Jesus is continually pointing toward the sky, for example.  After performing a miracle, he is also liable to extend his arms in a manner that brings the phrase Ta-da to my mind.  One has to be impressed by the special effects of this film - angels actually materialize and dematerialize on screen, for example, and Jesus walks on water.  I would never have believed it possible to do such incredible special effects way back in 1905.  Of course, a more mundane approach is sometimes used.  To make sure audiences get the point about the cock crowing after Peter's third denial of Christ, a rooster gets tossed into the frame at the appropriate moment.  The most curious part of the film is the birth of Jesus, though; Mary and Joseph both kneel beside an empty manger, and then the baby Jesus just magically appears a few seconds later.

From the Manger to the Cross is the more modern of these two films, debuting in 1912.  What makes this movie really special is the fact that it was actually filmed on location in the Holy Land.  It also stands as one of the earliest American-made feature films, clocking in at some 75 minutes in length.  The video quality isn't quite as good as that of the earlier film, but it is still pretty darned amazing.  You do see a little bit of a bleached look from time to time, but there is no problem seeing the actors' facial expressions.  This film does feature dialogue cards, with the entire content coming straight from the Bible.  This helps communicate the message of what is being presented on screen, making this film a perfect tool to put in the hands of missionaries of that era.  This is a much more naturalistic film than The Life and Passion of Jesus Christ; you won't see many special effects, for example - only the reaction of characters to such miraculous events as the appearance of an angel.  I did find it somewhat strange that the movie ended when it did, though.  I fully expected the story to cover Jesus' resurrection, but the film does indeed live up to its title by ending with Jesus' death on the cross.

My only complaint about this DVD is its lack of source materials on the two films.  All you get is an insert containing an excerpt from the reminiscences of the actress who played Mary the mother of Jesus in From the Manger to the Cross.  There's a lot of good information there, including an account of angry Arabs preventing the crew from filming its final scene on location, but I was rather disappointed to get no sort of documentation at all about the first and more intriguing film of this DVD pairing.  Still, this is an amazing DVD that should strongly appeal to silent movie enthusiasts - the superior quality of such old films is miraculous in and of itself.  Christians will appreciate the story being presented, of course, but some may also find these silent movie treatments rather boring.",1115078400,19,4771,4.596221959858323
1847102,3,B00008H2H0,"I can't believe anyone compared this film to Mel Gibsons film.
This is an old film without words. My opinion. The 5 star
ratings must not have bought this film.",1086912000,3,160,4.366666666666666
1847103,4,B00008H2H0,"It is interesting to note with all the attention being paid to Mel Gibson's PASSION OF THE CHRIST, that this film version was made around 100 years ago (started in 1902 and finished in 1905). THE LIFE AND PASSION OF JESUS CHRIST was produced in France as a series of 31 tableaux and utilizes the famous Pathe hand stenciled color process. Anyone familiar with the story of Jesus will easily follow it while those who aren't won't have any real difficulty. There are no gospel quotations here only title cards which preface each segment and some of the most remarkable sketched and painted scenery ever seen which are based on the drawings of Gustave Dore. The sets and costumes are equally impressive. The performances are not performances but actors striking a series of poses (especially Jesus) which is fitting for a series of tableaux. The condition of the film is truly remarkable. I have never seen a film of this vintage look this good. A remakable find and a welcome addition to the ever growing list of silent films available on home video.

The second title on this disc, FROM THE MANGER TO THE CROSS, has already been out on VHS as part of Kino's FIRST AMERICAN FEATURES series. It's main asset is that it was filmed on location in the Middle East. Originally made by the Kalem company in 1912 it was reissued and retitled with an overabundance of Biblical quotes by Vitagraph in the late teens. A sincere and fairly restrained look at the life of Christ (although the Crucifiction scene is quite realistic), it tells its story simply with an animated segment at the very end. While it didn't leave me with a sense of wonder like the first film did, it is likely to have more appeal to those who are just starting out with silent film. It is also of historical significance as one of the earliest surviving American features. Both titles have excellent organ scores by Timothy Howard and are ideal for anyone interested in silent cinema or the life of Jesus. Experience a PASSION that's almost a century old and still going strong.",1081728000,25,2042,4.6722222222222225
1847104,5,B00008H2H0,"The Life and Passion of Jesus Christ is a stunning film. It was begun in 1902 and completed in 1905. It equals or surpasses any other film I have seen from this period.  It depicts various scenes in the life of Christ, from the Annunciation to the Ascension. Each scene starts with a title card briefly describing the following action. There are no dialogue titles, which means the film assumes a fairly good knowledge of the Bible. Anyone coming to the film with no prior knowledge of the story of Christ would find the film in places quite hard to follow. For example, when the Marriage of Cana is depicted and Christ turns the water into wine, it would be hard to judge that he was doing this unless one knew in advance.
There are 31 scenes or tableaux in the film which runs around 44 minutes and many of them resemble the paintings of Renaissance art. The scene of the last supper is reminiscent of Leonardo Da Vinci's famous fresco. But the film is far from static, including lively crowd scenes and quite violent action, as in the scene of the slaughter of the innocents. It has a good deal of spectacle, and for its time, fine special effects showing Christ walking on water or angels appearing as if from nowhere. Best of all this film showcases an early example of Path's stencil colour process, whereby various colours were applied to the individual frames of film. The result is quite beautiful to look at. The print of Life and Passion of Jesus Christ is excellent. For such an early film, it is marvellous that such a clear and detailed print has survived.
The second film on this DVD, From the Manger to the Cross (1912), shows how quickly filmmaking had progressed during the few years since the making of the Path film. It is more sophisticated, with a more naturalistic style of acting. It was filmed on actual locations, rather than on stage sets, and provides some fascinating glimpses of Bethlehem, Jerusalem, the Pyramids and the Sphinx. It runs around 70 minutes and is one of the earliest American feature films. It is thus of considerable historical importance. The main fault with From the Manger to the Cross is that it has far too many titles. Each scene uses Biblical quotations to describe the action and to provide dialogue. This sometimes works well, but is overdone, so that the viewer must spend too much time reading rather than watching. I enjoyed this film less than the earlier one, but it is still a fine film setting the standard for the many Biblical epics which would follow. The tinted print of From the Manger to the Cross is good, but not as pristine as the Path film. It shows some wear and tear and is somewhat soft lacking some detail and clarity of image. Both of the films on this DVD have fine organ scores. The music follows the action and the mood of the films and is well played on a church organ. This DVD is excellent value, including two of the most important early films about Jesus Christ. It should be of interest to both silent film fans and more generally those who enjoy Biblical films.",1050192000,77,3049,4.563868613138686
1847132,5,B00008H2H0,"As I haven't seen a Jesus movie yet that is 100% exactly like the bible describes in matching the time period, or including every chapter and verse of the scriptures, I still enjoyed this move. It is a classic. I bought the DVDS a couple of years ago.",1430352000,,251,4.25

1847140,3,B00008H2H0,"I only ordered this DVD due to the fact that a distant cousin of mine, Robert Vignola, played the part of Judas Iscariot & I feel he did a very good job.  The film was good but the music was a bit annoying..most of it sounded like marches or a waltz.  Did not feel it was appropriate for this type of film.  The actor who played Christ was also very good.  Some of the scenes, such as the Pyramids,  were pleasing especially since this film was made in 1912.
Sorry, but I would not recommend this DVD.  As I stated..the music wasn't appropriate in most of the scenes so that's the reason I only give it 3 stars.",1395619200,,611,4.135593220338983

1847146,4,B00008H2H0,"this one of the few movies addressing this subject with the respect and dignity it deserves. of course due to the time constraints and practicality they had to select certain events in the Lif of the Lord to include in the film and probably that is why they produces the film in two parts. in the first part certain events were highlighted and in the second part other events were highlighted. when watching a movie I like to keep track of the dialogue, the artistic content as well as the accuracy of depicting the facts and this film scored well in these accounts. the acting was acceptable though I did not like portraying the Lord dancing in the wedding of Cana. all in all the format and the time frame were very well managed for the modern viewer who might not be too religious to enjoy it.",1367452800,2,796,4.421768707482993
