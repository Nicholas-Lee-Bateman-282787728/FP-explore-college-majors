Other than this oversight, the film was richly  rewarded with many well deserved Oscars including Best Picture and a Best  Actress award for Vivian Leigh's wrenching and pleasingly theatric  submission as Blanche.

100033,3,0790729377,"Released in late 1951 and directed by Elia Kazan based on Tennessee Williams play, A Streetcar Named Desire stars Vivien Leigh as the neurotic Blanche DuBois, who moves in with her sister (Kim Hunter) in the French Quarter of New Orleans where she is antagonized by her brutish brother-in-law, Stanley (Marlon Brando). As she seeks a relationship with one of Stanleys friends (Karl Malden) her reality crumbles around her.

The story is thematically rich and I enjoy evaluating and interpreting it. For instance, Blanche represents the dying Southern aristocracy, its airs of sophistication, its morality and delusions of superiority, whereas Stanley Kowalski represents the simple primal world of working class immigrants and the moral decay of modern society or, at least, its veneer of morality (which is the root of legalism). But the way the conflict between Blanche and Stanley plays out shows that Williams doesnt advocate either side, which leaves the audience uncertain on who to support. While Blanches initial arrogance shouldnt be condoned and deserved rebuked, I squarely side with Blanche as Stanleys ongoing (and increasing) assaults become less and less justifiable.

What Blanche did or didn't do with the Dubois estate is a legitimate issue of contention and the truth needed to be pursued, aggressively if necessary; but most of the other issues Stanley has with Blanche are basically none of his business. After all, everyone has shameful skeletons in their closets, even Stanley, but hes too oafish to likely ever admit it. One critic erroneously criticized Blanche for being a pedophile, but he obviously doesnt know the definition of the word. Pedophilia refers to a persistent sexual fascination with pre-pubescent kids. The worst Blanche can be accused of is ephebophilia, which is an attraction to those in their later teens, 17 and up. This condition is balanced out by her serious romantic interest in Mitch (Malden).

People rave about Brandos acting in Streetcar, but there are far better examples of his genius, such as The Young Lions (1958), One-Eyed Jacks (1961), Mutiny on the Bounty (1962), The Missouri Breaks (1976) and Apocalypse Now (1979), to name a handful. Marlons portrayal of Kowalski is undermined by the needlessly antagonistic nature of the character. In other words, the performance might be excellent, but the character is so distasteful its hard to appreciate it.

This is one of the main eye-rolling problems with the story and the movie: The characters are too one-dimensional and unbelievable. Blanche is the drama mama with airs of sophistication, Stanley is the animalistic brute, Stella is the blindly loyal wife and Mitch is the infatuated dumbaxx. Leighs depiction of Blanche is so over-the-top and artificial it wouldve received a Razzie if the film were released a mere decade later. And Im not blaming Vivien; she did the best she could with the melodramatic script.

Even worse, you have ridiculous elements, like the idea that Mitch was never able to see Blanche in the full light of day, so to speak, even though he took her on a date to the pier. The whole dimming the lights component is absurd and poorly executed, especially in light of Viviens obvious beauty, whatever her age. In reality, Mitch would (and should) be worshipping at her feet for eternity, regardless of any skeletons of her past.

Then theres the preposterous explanation of the suicide of an off-screen character. In the play the reason was that he was caught in a homosexual affair, which is interesting and works (particularly considering the time period), but they changed this for the movie due to the moral codes and they failed to pull it off, to be nice.

BOTTOM LINE: The movie is thematically rich and has a great cast, but the execution is seriously problematic. The storys not compelling, the characters are aggravatingly one-dimensional and there are too many eye-rolling elements. If you want to see a good Tennessee Williams movie check out 1964s The Night of the Iguana or even 1960s The Fugitive Kind (the latter has its problems, but its better than this). The ongoing praise of A Streetcar Named Desire is a good example of the emperor having no clothes.

The movie runs 122 minutes (125 minutes re-release) and was shot at Warner Brothers Burbank Studios in California, with the bowling scene done in Los Angeles and the opening railway station filmed in New Orleans.

I get chills just thinking about it. And Marlon Brando as that ***** Stanley Kowalski...that final confrontation between the two of them still haunts me. He's magnetic: animalistic, erotic, alluring, repugnant... And the two of them together is electric.

This is my favorite play, so I was thrilled to see it come to life so magnificently, and under such great direction.

Also... Not to wax on about Vivien Leigh, but I can't get over her performance as Blanche. Her final break breaks ME. I...I honestly think she's one of the most talented actresses Hollywood has EVER seen. It seems almost unfair that such immense talent could be packaged in such an exquisitely beautiful form, but she did it as Scarlett and did it again as Blanche. Amazing.

Also, anyone who says that Vivien Leigh won Oscars for playing basically the same character is ignorant AF. Aside from their accents and geographical origins, Scarlett and Blanche couldn't be further apart.",1465084800,16,1119,4.973262032085562

If the alternative was not having this film version at all, I can live with the changes.

Marlon Brando is just amazing - raw, sensual, and just beautiful.  And, if even possible, Vivien Leigh is even better.  She is astonishing.  You just can't take your eyes off her.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: `A Streetcar Named Desire' originally garnered most of the drama prizes awards when it was playing on Broadway. But with director Elia Kazan and a simply superlative cast have fashioned a motion picture that throbs with passion and poignancy. Indeed, through the haunting performance England's great Vivien Leigh gives in the heart-breaking role of Tennessee Williams's deteriorating Southern belle and through the mesmerising moods with the help of Elia Kazan and with his brilliant techniques that you view on the screen, this picture has now become a fine, if not finer, than the stage play. Inner torments are seldom projected with such sensitivity and clarity on the screen.

Blanche DuBois is an aging schoolteacher who leaves her hometown under mysterious circumstances and stays with her pregnant sister Stella in New Orleans. Stanley Kowalski, Stella Kowalski's brutish husband, resents Blanche DuBois's presence and accuses her of squandering the family inheritance. Stanley Kowalski sets about tearing down the fragile world of illusion with which Blanche DuBois attempts to surround herself.

Of course, the first factor in this triumph is Tennessee Williams's original play, which embraced, among its many virtues, an essential human conflict in visual terms. The last brave, defiant, hopeless struggle of the lonely and decaying Blanche du Bois to hold on to her faded gentility against the heartless badgering of her roughneck brother-in-law is a tangible cat-and-dog set to, marked with manifold physical episodes as well as a wealth of fluctuations of verbally fashioned images and moods. And all of these graphic components have been fully preserved in Oscar Saul's film script and availed of by the brilliant director Elia Kazan in his cinematic tour-de-force.

No less brilliant, however, within his area is Marlon Brando in the role of the loud, lusty, brawling, brutal, amoral Polish brother-in-law. Marlon Brando created the role in the Broadway stage play and he carries over all the energy and the steel-spring characteristics that made him vivid on the stage. But here, where we're so much closer to him, he seems that much more highly charged, his despairs seem that much more pathetic, and his comic moments that much more slyly enjoyed.

Other actors from the Broadway cast of the stage play, Kim Hunter as the torn young sister and wife, Karl Malden as a timid, boorish suitor, Nick Dennis as a pal, and all the rest fill out the human pattern within a sleazy environment that is so fitly and graphically created that you can almost sense its sweatiness and smells. Alex North's incidental music deserves prominent commendation, too, as do all of the technical aspects of this film which Charles K. Feldman has produced.

Needless to say, the filming of `A Streetcar Named Desire' was more problematic than the stage production. Vivien Leigh clashed with Elia Kazan over her interpretation of Blanche DuBois and also had problems connecting with her fellow cast members who were trained in the ""Stanislavsky Method."" ""In many ways she was Blanche DuBois."" Marlon Brando said in his autobiography, Vivien Leigh was memorably beautiful, one of the great beauties of the screen, but she was also vulnerable, and her own life had been very much like that of Tennessee Williams's wounded butterfly...like Blanche DuBois, and was beginning to dissolve mentally and frayed at the end physically.

While in production, `A Streetcar Named Desire' began to encounter resistance from the film industry's self-regulating production code office with references to the sexuality of Blanche DuBois's deceased husband were removed and the harsh original ending was altered, with Stella rejecting her husband rather than remaining by his side. Still, the film encountered controversy during its release and Warner Bros. deleted an additional five minutes of material, it was later added back in a 1993 restoration, which included dialogue references to Blanche DuBois's past promiscuity and visual evidence of the lustful relationship between Stanley Kowalski and Stella Kowalski.

All the troubles were well worth it in the end because `A Streetcar Named Desire' is now considered a landmark film in terms of the ensemble performances. Elia Kazan's direction and the evocative art direction by Richard Day. The derelict New Orleans tenement is given a convincing presence through the accumulation of image details, such as crumbling stucco and bricks, peeling wallpaper, streaks of dirt on the walls and the dramatic courtyard staircase with wrought iron railings. In collaboration with Harry Stradling's evocative textures of light and shadow, the sets provide crucial atmospheric support for the actors' naturalistic performances. Plus the Composer Alex North's haunting film score, which unfortunately was only nominated for Best Music, Score of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture.

Blu-ray Video Quality  This Blu-ray has a stunning 1080p encoded transfer, with an aspect ratio of 1.37:1 that was achieved with many of the original film's black-and-white elements. It is typical of the fine work Warner Home Video has done with some it prestige titles like Citizen Kane and Casablanca. Fine detail is more variable, struggling a bit in wider shots, and faring better in close ups, yet film grain looks intact with no evidence of excessive noise reduction measures. Dupes and other image manipulations (one standing out more than others), made in the original edit, can be starkly obvious next to the sharper and tighter extra supplements material. But the transfer ultimately proves faithful to the source elements, even though those elements may not always look the most perfect.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  `A Streetcar Named Desire' is presented on Blu-ray Disc with a 1.0 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack. Considering that `A Streetcar Named Desire' is more than sixty years old, the sound quality is still impresive. Sure, there are modest limitations in fidelity, but the track is a very strong performer. Alex Norths music comes across with good sense of character. Most signs of background hiss and noise have been cleaned up in the mastering process, which leaves a generally smooth quality to the soundtrack. Dialogue is always crystal clear and easy to understand.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Actor Karl Malden, and Film Historians Rudy Behlmer and Jeff Young: features supplements producer Laurent Bouzereau hosting and we get comments from co- star Karl Malden [Actor], Rudy Behlmer [Film Historian] and Jeff Young (all recorded separately). Jeff Young got to know Elia Kazan quite well when Jeff Young was an executive of Paramount Pictures and has some good anecdotes about the director Elia Kazan. Rudy Behlmer contributes more of an overall historical perspective and Karl Malden is able to give an actor's viewpoint, on both the stage and screen versions. Some of Karl Malden's comments about Marlon Brando in his early career are quite surprising, and there are some wonderful anecdotes shared about the original Broadway run, including some great stories about the ""mother hen,"" the original star Jessica Tandy. This is an extremely worthwhile and informative piece that should appeal equally to scholars and film fans alike.

Special Feature Length Profile of Elia Kazan: A Director's Journey [1994] [480i] [4:3] [1:15:30] Written and directed by film critic and film historian Richard Schickel, and narrated by Eli Wallach, the documentary traces Elia Kazan's career from his beginnings as a stage actor to his work as an award-winning film director. An extensive interview with the director himself provides much of the film's structure and content, following a predictable pattern that alternates between the interview and material from the films. As it focuses almost exclusively on his directing work, there's little examination of Elia Kazan's controversial actions related to the Hollywood Blacklist of the 1950s. Nevertheless, it provides a fitting tribute to a very talented director. We also get a very interesting insight into the journey Elia Kazan journey from his native land where he was born and eventually ending up directing top quality Hollywood and New York films that have won endless plaudits. This is a definite documentary not to be missed.

Special Feature Documentary: A Streetcar on Broadway [2006] [480i] [4:3] [22:00] This feature documentary describes with the development, production, and reception of Tennessee Williams's Pulitzer Prize-winning play how it made its journey to the silver screen. Contributing to this documentary, we get intimate information from the likes of Elia Kazan [Director], Karl Malden [Actor], Rudy Behlmer [Film Historian] and Richard Schickel [Author of ""Elia Kazan: A Biography""] provide most of the interview material, but also includes an archival interview with Kim Hunter [Actress].

Special Feature Documentary: A Streetcar in Hollywood [2006] [480i] [4:3] [28:08] A continuation of the previous feature documentary which describes the play's next phase as it moves from the stage to the silver screen. Once again contributing to this very interesting documentary, we again get insightful intimate information from the likes of Elia Kazan [Director], Karl Malden [Actor], Rudy Behlmer [Film Historian] and Richard Schickel [Author of ""Elia Kazan: A Biography""] and Kim Hunter [Actress].

Special Feature Documentary: Censorship and Desire [2006] [480i] [4:3] [16:20] With this particular documentary, we get details about the National Legion of Decency's objections and moral outrage to some of the sexual contents in the film, and the ultimate edits made in order for it to be ""morally objectionable in part"" as opposed to be completely condemned. It also informs us how the director's sleight of hand was instrumented in making subtle changes to allow the censors to pass the film. This interesting feature also provides helpful side-by-side views of the edited and original versions of key scenes. Contribution to this documentary is Rudy Behlmer [Film Historian], Karl Malden [Actor], Kim Hunter [Actress] and Robert Townson [Record Producer]. We also get to hear how Alex North [Composer] and how he had to re-score the film music, as the censors thought certain scenes were too provocative with his original score. But luckily by accident they found a can of film with all the censored scenes and were carefully restored to the original restored version.

Special Feature Documentary: North and the Music of the South [2006] [480i] [4:3] [9:14] This fascinating documentary gives an interesting insight into the composer Alex North and how he gave the film its distinctive film score. Contributions comes in the form of Robert Townson [Record Producer] of Varese Sarabande talks about the work of the award nominated composer Alex North, and shares how he got involved with producing and releasing Alex North's abandoned score to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Oddysey with the help of Jerry Goldsmith [composer, which you can now hear the full score on a CD Album. We also get to find out that Robert Townson got to know Alex North personally in his later years before he sadly passed way.

Special Feature Documentary: An Actor Named Brando [2006] [480i] [4:3] [8:52] Fellow performers and historians talk about the impression the actor made in the theatre and film industry and through his work on the Academy Award winning film A Streetcar Named Desire. We are also informed how Marlon Brando [Actor] personality is so different from his screen persona and how he hated the character he played in the film. Contributing to this documentary, we see Elia Kazan [Director], Karl Malden [Actor], Richard Schickel [Author of ""Elia Kazan: A Biography""] and Kim Hunter [Actress].

Special Feature: Marlon Brando Screen Test [1992] [480i] [4:3] [5:05] Here we get to see the young Marlon Brando with Warner Bros. Test shots. Also segments from Marlon Brando's screen test for Rebel Without A Cause. But we also get intimate shots of a well-dressed Marlon Brando, who is obviously very self-conscious. Sometimes you get no audio sound at all.

Special Feature: Outtakes [1951] [480i] [4:3] [15:38] Here we get to see a series of unused film clips from A Streetcar Named Desire' that is somewhat sort of interesting, but without any context and hard to understand, especially as they are not in any set order and some are very short in appearance, but you also get a lot of repeat outtakes, especially with a voice over with the director Elia Kazan.

Special Feature: Outtakes [Audio only] [1951] [1080p] [16:9] [17:01] Similar to the film outtakes, which is difficult to discern the context from seemingly random snippets of audio recordings and all the time you listen to this, you get a colorized still image from the film. To be honest I cannot understand the point of this section.

Theatrical Trailers: We get to see three trailers, starting with Warner Bros. [1951 Release] [480i] [2:34]. 20th Century Fox [1958 Reissue] [480i] [2:08]. United Artists [1970 Reissue] [480i] [1:48].

BONUS: A Special Collectible Deluxe Limited Edition DigiBook: The nicely produced book packaging that includes cast and crew biographies, background on the production and numerous photographs.

Finally, A Streetcar Named Desire is a cinematic classic that has been beautifully rendered in high definition. Warner Home Video Blu-ray delivers a strong presentation of Elia Kazan's award-winning adaptation of the equally acclaimed Broadway play. This All Region Blu-ray release comes with awesome Special Features, that have been transferred from the 2006 special edition inferior NTSC DVD, making the purchase of this Blu-ray release, which is well worthwhile for those looking to upgrade 100%, as well as for first time purchasers of this Blu-ray disc. Very Highly Recommended!

100579,5,0790729377,"One of my favorite Brando/Kazan collaborations. Brando starred in Kazan's 1947 Streetcar Named Desire. Still one of the greatest performances of all time. He reprised his role in the film version in 1951. His combustible Stanley Kowalski has never been equalled. Seductive, brutal, vulnerable, childlike, Brando displays incredible emotional range as he struts barks, cries, begs, et al. If you haven't seen it, get it. If you have seen it you'll be watching it over and over again. A true classic. It never gets old.",1423612800,,517,5.094117647058823

100583,5,0790729377,"Tennessee Williams' 1947 play, ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" won the Pulitzer Prize and the New York Drama Critics Circle Award. The 1951 film of ""Streetcar"" was almost as celebrated.  Elia Kazan directed the Broadway production and the film.  Three of the four principals, Marlon Brando, Kim Hunter, and Karl Malden, starred on Broadway and in the movie.  Only Vivien Leigh, who replaced Jessica Tandy as Blanche DuBois, did not act in the Broadway production; Leigh had performed Blanche on stage in London.

Williams' script, the acting, direction, cinematography, and music make ""Streetcar"" a moving, lasting film. The play tells the story of a fading Southern belle, Blanche DuBois, who is forced by circumstances to come stay with her sister Stella and her husband, Stanley Kowalski, in a shabby apartment in New Orleans' French Quarter. Stella has had a promiscuous sexual past after the death of her husband many years earlier.  She flees her native town in search of one final chance at happiness. The play explores the tension between the romantic Blanche, and the crude, earthy, Stanley. The film builds in force as Stanley destroys Stella's dreams, in the form of a possible relationship with Stanley's friend Mitch, and Stella's sanity and liberty.

The film is best-known for Marlon Brando's performance as Stanley. Brando becomes the character in all his crudity while giving Stanley a vulnerable side as well. Although the performance defined his career, Brando did not win an Academy Award for his portrayal of Stanley in ""Streetcar."" Each of the other principals, Leigh (best actress), Hunter (best supporting actress) and Malden (best supporting actress) received Oscars. Leigh's performance as Blanche is highly charged and sexual in its own right. It almost matches rather than opposes Stanley's raw sensualy. Kim Hunter's portrayal of Stella shows her strong sexually-based attraction to Stanley. Malden's performance of Blanche's would-be suitor, the mama's boy Mitch, is a gem.

The scenes on the New Orleans streets in the French Quarter are highly effective in the film as was the lighting and the music.  Before its release, ""Streetcar"" faced a battle with censors. Blanche's hysteria and nymphomania and the homosexuality of her young husband were toned down. The climactic rape scene was kept in while its portrayal was only suggested. The ending of Williams'  play was changed to suggest that Stella was leaving her husband while in the play the family stays together as Stella tries to push from her mind Stanley's rape of her sister. With the changes, this film remains an excellent realization of Williams' play.

I have been revisiting Tennessee Williams after reading a new biography by John Lahr, ""Tennessee Williams: Mad Pilgrimage of the Flesh"". (2014) Lahr's book offers many insights into both the play and the film of ""Streetcar"". I have seen the play on stage and read it several times over the years, but oddly this was my first time with the movie. The copy I had was poor with several scratches and stops. It was a library copy which undoubtedly had been through many hands and many machines. I was glad for the opportunity to see it. Those with an interest in American theater or American movies will want to see this film of ""A Streetcar Named Desire"".

100704,5,0790729377,"This is a review of the Blu-ray edition. It restores the material censored by the Breen Office and the Legion of Decency. The PG rating is absurd; the material justifies a PG-13.

The story has a dark humor I hadn't caught before. Stanley's passion for food is as strong as his lust for women. When he eats, he stuffs his face. Kazan (who also directed the play) properly keeps the focus on Blanche, without letting Stanley's presence overwhelm her.

It's hard not to feel sympathy for Stanley. He's oversexed, rude, and brutish -- but not stupid. If it's true that rape is an act of violence, not sex, that is what Stanley commits on Blanche. He knows from the start that she's not the delicate, ""virginal"" creature she pretends to be, and resents a slut calling him a greasy Pollock. His attack seems to be revenge for a phony ""high-toned"" woman belittling him -- especially one who's trying to seduce him. (The film alters the play by having Stella leave Stanley as ""punishment"" for what he did to Blanche.)

The transfer is magnificent (apparently from the negative), with deep, almost perfect blacks, and retains the photography's air of decay and desperation. The supplemental material (//in addition to// the commentaries) comprises several hours on Kazan's career, the making of the film, the play's production, etc. I also appreciated Alex North's score more than I had previously. It might not impress on the first hearing, because his ""sleazy"" music has become something of a clich&eacute; -- but he was apparently the first major film composer to write such a score.

A terrific movie with classic performances, especially Malden's.",1408320000,2,1644,4.945652173913044

100707,4,0790729377,"I actually saw this movie in 1951.  It was considered a little racy then, but nothing like today's more explicit exploits into the private parts of human life. Still, a great movie depicting life among Les Miserables.",1407369600,2,217,4.864864864864865
100708,3,0790729377,"So there are generally two things you take away from A Streetcar Named Desire.  One is the fact that Vivien Leigh doesnt just chew the scenery as Blanche du Bois - she swallows it only to regurgitate it, eat it again, and bring home a doggy bag.  The other is that despite the fact that you cant understand Marlon Brando even when hes yelling, his portrayal of Stanley Kowalski is even more exquisite when held up next to that of Leighs over-dramatic performance.

Basically, the rapidly-becoming-unhinged Blanche moves in with her sister, Stella (Kim Hunter) and Stellas husband, Stanley, in New Orleans after being fired for sleeping with a student (she initially told Stella that she was allowed a brief hiatus to recollect herself after her nerves were getting the better of her).  It probably also helps to mention that Blanche feels responsible for her husbands suicide (one of many parts of the play that was omitted for the film was that Blanches husband was discovered having a gay affair).

Stanley is your typical brutish oaf.  He likes to drink and play cards with his buddies, and he thinks nothing of roughing up his old lady, with the typical apologetic Dont leave me afterwards.  (The famous Stella!  Stella! should come to mind about now.)

Stella is your typical battered woman who cant leave her man.  Shes attracted to his physical outbursts, and they have that kind of volatile relationship that they keep going back to, knowing full well that someone is going to get potentially irreparably hurt in the long run.  And, of course, she ultimately ends up pregnant with his baby.

Blanche is, in no uncertain terms, a slut.  She asks random young men that she has just met if theyll let her kiss them on the mouth, and she flirts with any man who even looks in her general direction.  She even hooks one of them in - a friend of Stanleys named Mitch (Karl Malden), who is in love with her - that is, until he discovers truths about her past that she tried to keep hidden from him.

Unless you were familiar with the play, or had access to an internet connection, you probably wouldnt have gathered from the film that Stanley, in the end, rapes Blanche in an ultimate power-play while Stella is off having his baby.  (Damn softening of the material to be less controversial.)  This results in Blanche have a complete and utter mental breakdown and being carted off to the loony bin with Stella vowing, baby in arms, that she will never go back to Stanley again.  But who can be sure?

The films ending differs from that of the original ending of the play, which features Stella being wordlessly consoled by Stanley as her sister is hauled away.  In that sense, the ending to the film is preferable but also predictably Hollywood.  Of course we want to see Stella throw that douche to the curb, but in reality, would she?  She was never strong enough to leave him before, and now she has his baby...during the 50s when women didn't work as often.  Something tells me she isn't going anywhere.",1406505600,2,3009,4.646502835538753

100743,4,0790729377,"A Streetcar Named Desire is a play written by Tennessee Williams in 1947 turned movie in 1951. Directed by Elia Kazan, the play hit the silver screen with a star-studded cast; Stanley was portrayed by Marlon Brando, Vivian Leigh beautifully filled the role of Blanche, Blanche's sister Stella was brought to life by Kim Hunter, and finally Karl Maden breathed life into the character of Mitch. Although the movie version of Williams' play did follow the plot spot-on there were some major differences in the beginning and end when compared to the play. Also, in the movie there was a lack of detail of location of characters during scenes, so at times it was difficult to follow. Also, a major difference between the play and the movie is that the play ends as a true tragedy, where as in the movie not every character is tragic.

In Williams' play the opening scene shows Blanche walking on the sidewalk trying to find Stella and Stanley's house; however, in Kazan's movie, the opening scene shows Blanche trying to find the correct streetcar in order to get to Stella's house. So the movie provides a little more detail about Blanche's journey to Stella and Stanley. SPOILER ALERT!!! Another great difference between the play and the movie is the ending. In Williams' play the ending is tragic because Blanche is being taken away for ""relaxation"" but in reality she is being instituted because she has ""gone off the deep end"" after the incident with Stanley and Stella stays with Stanley even after being told what Stanley done to Stella. However, in the movie Stella leaves Stanley after Blanche is taken away, leaving the audience to wonder what happened next. This leads to the overall genre of the play and movie- tragedy- because Blanche is taken away after being a victim; however, Stella's differing actions in the movie in comparison to the play shows that she has finally realized her situation as being Stanley's wife is not good, so she is no longer a tragic character.

In conclusion, the movie is a good follow to the play, however, certain different aspects allow the movie to shine on its own.",1401753600,2,2110,4.793956043956044
100744,4,0790729377,"A Streetcar Named Desire, directed by Elia Kazan and released in 1951, is quite similar in detail to the 1947 play written by Tennessee Williams. This film stars Marlon Brando as Stanley, Vivian Leigh as Blanche, Kim Hunger as Stella, and Karl Malden as Mitch. The movies general conformity to the original play is a major plus for someone who likes to read the book first. However, the acting in this film simply does not do the characters of the play justice, especially on the platform of drama.
 For those who read the play before seeing the movie, the small number of changes seen in the movie is really satisfying to the viewer. We often tend to get frustrated when we see details in movies that deviate from the story we originally read and liked. A change made in the movie (SPOILER ALERT) includes showing Blanche in the opening scene of the movie actually board the streetcar named Desire where in the book/play we do not see this part. Given, this detail is not very significant, is still noted. A major detail in the film that deviates from the book is in the closing scene where we see Stella leaving with her baby and hear Staley frantically calling her name in the background, indicating that she leaves him. In the book/play, Stella stays with Stanley instead of taking Blanches side.
The story of A Streetcar Named Desire is a drama. Even though the plot of this movie keeps its dramatic qualities (due to the content), the acting seems to fall short of dramatic quality in some places. I personally found the acting a bit dry and boring in climatic points in the movie. Dramatic scenes feel forced in this film amongst all of the starring actors. Needless to say, the acting falls short of my original expectations of the starring characters.
An interesting storyline and talented acting and directing are required to make a good movie out of a written play. With drama, the director of the film or play is often the most important factor. In this movie take on A Streetcar Named Desire, Kazan does a pleasing job for many literary junkies who like to see what theyve read come to life accurately by keeping the plot of the movie close to that of the original play with the exception of a few small changes and the alternate ending. Even though the acting in this movie is not spectacular, the events in the plot keep it interesting.
Although the acting in 1951 A Streetcar Named Desire directed by Elia Kazan falls short of my personal expectations, this movie is still enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this movie- especially to someone who has read A Streetcar Named Desire- because it is very similar to the original book/play. For those who have not read the play, this film is still something easy and interesting to watch.",1401753600,,2753,4.6646090534979425
100745,3,0790729377,"Director Elia Kazan led the rendition of the Pulitzer winning opus, A Streetcar Named Desire. The cast was well picked, particularly with the young and vibrant Marlon Brando as Stanley. Where this was the best aspect of the play. the proclivity of the play for not including important details and lines weighed heavily against any headway the play may have made. A number of scenes were removed from the play in the film adaptation. Kazan admitted himself approximately four minutes were removed. The aim of the director is to make the viewers enjoy the movie and most people who did not read the play would not understand the importance of the scenes or lines. Namely, a number of Blanche's monologues helped the reader understand the importance of these scenes or lines. Namely, a number of Blanche's monologues helped the reader understand the conflict within Blanche and her thoughts on her present situation. Lastly, the infamous pre-rape line ""We've had this date from the beginning"" that Stanley used in the play is not uses in the movie. Proceeding from this point, the camera was positioned over Blanche's shoulder, and the scene was portrayed as much more animal-like in the movie as compared to the play. The plot, however, was maintained and the direction of the play fit well with the book. If you are looking for ""near point"" rendition, then you may not look here, but if you are looking for an okay approximation and movie filled with quality acting, A Streetcar Named Desire is surely worth the money.",1401753600,,1517,4.883720930232558

100766,5,0790729377,"I recently participated in a local production of Tennessee Williams' stage play, A Streetcar Named Desire.  While I had seen the movie years ago, this experience and my own older perspective on life gave new meaning to the play.  I resisted rewatching the movie while we in the midst of the play production, but when we finished the local run, I made a point of watching Vivien Leigh and Marlon Brando's take on this American Classic.  Williams' words are powerful, no matter who delivers them.  You watch Blanche slowly descend into madness, gradually understanding what drove her there:  ""the boythe boy died"".  All the deaths at Belle Rive, trying to maintain a genteel lifestyle with the fiction of ""gentlemen callers"".  Your heart goes out to her.  Yet, Stanley deserves our sympathy as well.  A working stiff with a Southern-bred lady for his passionate, loving wife who has everything he wants until Blanche inserts herself in their lives and destroys their happiness as well as her own.  I learned that some lines were not included in the movie because of the censorship of the day, but it still stands as a powerful commentary on that most basic of human emotions, desire.",1393891200,,1181,4.86

I could hardly sit through this movie because of Vivien Leigh's over-the-top acting.  She wimpered and simpered to the point of irritation and beyond.  If I were Marlon's character, I would have kicked her out the first day.  Also, Marlon's character was a brutish piece of eye candy that no woman would put up with.  He was a complete jerk with the worst table manners you could imagine.  The acting of these two characters was so over-the-top that I could hardly stand the movie.

There are no easy victories, or easy resolutions  or even hard ones that are clearly spelled out, even for the typical high school kid.  You see it because you've heard that one of the great actors of all time, Marlon Brando, gives one of the best performances of his life as Stanley Kowalski: the hard-headed, dim-witted, abusive husband stuck in postwar New Orleans poverty.  But Vivian Leigh's performance as Blanche DuBois, Kowalski's antebellum sister-in-law, blows you away every bit as much, perhaps even more.  This is American cinema not just at its height, but at a remarkably early pivot point in its history.  Way ahead of its time, it transforms the silver screen to grey:  From the glamor-at-any-cost Hollywood of old to the gritty, seedy underside  of poverty and of humanity and a new kind of realism seldom seen before on the screen.  It's also an intense, can't-miss psychological drama with vast potential to entertain, provoke, and talk about long after the closing credits.",1381968000,,1120,4.878306878306878

Apart from the fact that its poignant message about domestic violence and mental illness (and a woman's, no less!) is extraordinarily before its time, the brilliant dialogue, casting, etc. are terrific and horrifying. Due to certain pressures of having to appease the forces that be, certain aspects were changed from the original: (spoilers:) including the ending, and details regarding Blanche's young husband's sexuality. These would have made for a more powerful experience, but Vivien Leigh and Marlon Brando's smouldering, deranged duality and Kazan's filming is enough to make for a momentous film.",1381449600,3,799,5.666666666666667

Then again, it is directed by Elia Kazan, who can never leave excellence alone but is compelled to damage it.  For no understandable reason, Kazan cuts scenes mercilessly, destroys speeches, re-arranges events.  What he does to Williams' extraordinary play is even worse than what Mike Nichols and Taylor/Burton did to Albee's brilliant ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?""  Even this film version of the play, which purports to restore what the Hayes Code censors excised from the film, is virtually worthless.  Blanche's escapade with her student, the whole tale of discovering her husband's homosexual relationship with an older friend (to say nothing of his subsequent suicide), Stanley and Stella's raw lust and magnetism for each other, and the rich and vulgar quality of the language of ""The Quarter"" are all missing.  And what's the point?  But the biggest atrocity occurs at the end of the play.  Instead of the ending Williams' wrote, Kazan changes the whole play by having Stella leave Stanley.  Good grief! Could any action short of having Stella kill Stanley be any more absurd?

See a full-blown stage production rather than buying this film, despite the excellence of the cast.",1342828800,7,1290,5.1
100948,5,0790729377,"It's quite interesting that even though Marlon Brando's heroic performance as Stanley Kowalski is recognized as one of the most influential pieces of acting on the silver screen, he was the only one of the four main actors not to win an Oscar for ""A Streetcar Named Desire"". While Vivien Leigh, Kim Hunter, and Karl Malden all picked up Oscars, Brando's went to Humphrey Bogart for ""The African Queen"". But throughout time, of the two, Brando's has been the more revered and respected.
 Elia Kazan doesn't tinker around much with Tennessee Williams' classic stage play, but instead, he keeps it straight to the text. The dialogue is nearly the same as it was in the play itself, and all Kazan does is give life to the characters and the locations. Shot in beautiful black-and-white, ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" deals with the harsh realities of forgetting the past and throwing away dreams.
 The best scenes in the movie of course involve Marlon Brando, without whom the film could not have worked. As Stanley Kowalski, he plays the wife-beater/alcoholic straight as it should be played. At times he can be the most charming man in the world, and at others he can be the most dangerous. One of my very favorite scenes in the film is the miserable birthday party that Stella (Hunter) throws for Blanche (Leigh). As Blanche asks Stanley to tell a story, he sits there, licking his greasy fingers, at which Stella gets angry and demands that he wash himself and help her clear the table.
 At that moment, Stanley smashes his glass to the floor, frightening his wife and sister-in law. He begins a courageous and male-domination speech that I could probably quote for memory: ""Now that's how I'm gonna clear the table. Don't you ever talk that way to me! Pig, Polack, Disgusting, Vulgar, Greasy. Those kinds of words have been on you and your sister's tongues too much around here. Who do you think you are, a pair of queens? Just remember what Huey Long said, that every man is the king, and I'm the king around here. And don't you forget it.""
 With that one speech, Stanley is already defined as a character as intimidating as Darth Vader himself. And some of the scariest moments in the film include his drunken scenes and his final confrontation with his sister-in-law.
 Of the many great things in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", after Marlon Brando, my next favorite is Vivien Leigh's performance as Blanche Dubois. After her spellbinding performance in ""Gone With the Wind"", Leigh retook her claim as the great actress of the time with another performance as a Southern Belle. You could have dyed Scarlett o' Hara's hair blonde and put her in a time machine that went into the 1930's and there wouldn't be a difference in the world between her and Blanche.
 The character of Blanche Dubois is already flawlessly written, but Leigh gives her the power of Scarlett o' Hara. Her scenes with Karl Malden as Stanley's best friend Mitch are quite interesting as she tries to impress him with lies. She likes to keep the light out of her face to make her seem younger. But in time, Mitch sees through her fabrications and finds her to be a desperate alcoholic.
 Karl Malden and Kim Hunter give their supporting characters of Mitch and Stella excitement. Every time they appear on the screen with Brando and Leigh, they are not minions to the lead actors, but their counterparts. Their supporting performances are what make ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" one of the best ensembles ever assembled at the movies.
 But what does the film symbolize? For me, it stands for the passion between characters who feel unchallenged. Before Blanche came along, Stanley was content. He had a nice life with a pretty wife, a good job, and good friends. When Blanche arrived at his door, his life turned upside down. I believe that he had a physical/sexual attraction towards Blanche and he couldn't control it at the very end.
 And while he does feel this physical bond with her, Stanley begins to see her as a fraud. He begins to antagonize her, even going so far as to buy her a ticket back to Laurel (Oriole) as a birthday gift. He looks to himself as the king, and that everyone is at his command.
 Blanche sees throughout time that her past with her ex-husband and affair with a 17-year old boy come back to haunt her. These two events will trigger the ending of the film, which is incredibly painful, as she is lead away to a mental institution, but not before uttering ""I have always depended on the kindness of strangers"". Your past will always be with you, whether it haunts you or teaches you lessons.",1341187200,2,4583,4.696139476961394

Brando portrays Stanley Kowalski, a violent brute who calls himself ""the king around here"", and is very upset when his wife's, Kim Hunter, sister Blanche comes to stay.  Blanche is a emotionally unstable woman trying to cover up the horrors of her past through her high class attitude and elagant clothing.  All of this leads up to one of the most horrifying endinds captured on film.  This is one of the greatest movies of all time and I would recommend it to anyone.",1337644800,3,751,4.659090909090909

Blanche DuBois is played by Vivien Leigh, Stanley Kowalski is played by Marlon Brando, Stella Kowalski is played by Kim Hunter, and Mitch [didn't get his last name] is played by Karl Malden. Each one gives a superior performance in an intensely emotional movie.

Blanche has ""lost"" the family home, and so comes to ""visit"" her sister Stella and her common, rather crude, enormously sensuous husband Stanley Kowalski. In fact, she has nowhere to go, and stays on for months. In the meantime, she flirts with the most promising of his poker buddies (they went through the war together, and now they work in a car parts place together), Mitch. Stanley and Stella are living in a grimy 2-room apartment in New Orleans, so having Blanche and her trunk full of delicate finery and her need for privacy, and her long soaks in the bathtub ""to calm her down,"" gets to be rather a nuisance. She's nearly got Mitch to propose marriage when Stanley hears some pretty nasty gossip about Blanche, tracks it down to confirm it, and then tells Mitch what he has heard.

OK, that's plenty enough information for your imagination to run with it. Better still, let some fine acting run with it. Without saying any more, I must say that I would not have had half the patience with Blanche that Stella had.",1336867200,2,1530,4.516245487364621

100954,5,0790729377,"""A Streetcar Named Desire""  is the film that catapulted Marlon Brando to movie stardom.  Though he had appeared the year before as a disabled veteran coping with a return to civilian life in ""The Men,"" it was this adapation of the Tennessee Williams play that cemented the Actors' Studio alumnus as one of the most influential screen perfromers of the 1950's.

Elia Kazan, who also directed the Broadway play, infuses the drama with raw emotion which is far more theatrical than ciinematic.  What holds the viewer is the first-rate performances: Brando as the brutish Stanley Kowalski; Vivien Leigh as the fragile Blanche, more at home in her memories of better times than sharing a residence with her sister and husband in a crowded New Orleans apartment; Kim Hunter as Stanley's long-suffering, ever-patient wife Stella; and Karl Malden as Stanley's pal Mitch.

Along with Brando, Hunter and Malden starred in the Broadway play.  Leigh, who played the role of Blanche in the London production, won a Best Actress Oscar.  Hunter and Malden, too, won Oscars for their supporting performances, but Brando lost the Best Actor prize to Humphrey Bogart, who won for ""The African Queen.""  The movie received an unprecedented 12 Academy Award nominations in all.

The movie portrays a culture clash between Blanche DuBois, a fading relic of the Old South, and Stanley, a blue-collar, earthy member of the immigrant class.  Blanche is a Southern belle whose pretensions to virtue, culture, and art mask her nymphomania and alcoholism.  When Blanche arrives at the house of sister Stella, Stella fears Blanche's arrival will upset the balance of her relationship with husband Stanley, a primal, rough-hewn, sensual man who dominates Stella in every way.  Stella tolerates his offensive crudeness and lack of gentility largely because of her sexual need for him.

The new digitally remastered Blu-ray edition contains the original restored version of the movie, which was never seen because of Legion of Decency censorship.  Special features include commentary by Karl Malden, outtakes, Marlon Brando's screen test, full-length documentary on Elia Kazan, five featurettes, and a 40-page book containing photos, film facts, and behind-the-scenes production details.",1333238400,10,2255,5.333333333333333

100997,5,0790729377,"A Streetcar Named Desire is a stunning film which shocked the censors in 1951 with the powerful acting by both Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh. Set in sultry New Orleans, Marlon is a working class man who has a run down but stable life with his wife, Stella, in a tiny two room apartment. Suddenly his wife's younger sister, Blanche, shows up. Blanche is from southern gentility, dresses in fancy dresses, and expects men to act in a gentlemanly way. Stanley likes to drink, gamble, bowl, and throw things when he gets upset - which is fairly often.

It's clear right away that things are not going to go smoothly between the two, and poor Stella is stuck in the middle, struggling to defend her sister and her husband from each other. On top of that she is pregnant. She's both upset by and enthralled by her husband's passion, running from him and to him in the same breath.

Fairly quickly we realize that Blanche is not all she seems to be. Despite her claims of high class morals, it seems that she's quite willing to drink heavily, seduce any man who gets near her, and become lost in angst over her husband who committed suicide. This happened many years ago - when she was only in her teens - but the experienced affected her immensely.

The interplay between the sisters is just as powerful as the scenes with Marlon, and this is one of the few movies on the AFI top 100 list which actually passes the Bechdel test of having two meaningful female characters in it. There are both a censored and non-censored version of this film, and the ending is meaningfully different, so it's well worth searching out both of them and watching them to see what happens. I would rather not give away spoilers here!

It can be easy to think of a movie about a rough marriage as ""typical"" in modern times, but for 1951, this was something rarely seen on the scene. I'm sure for many families it was not strange at all, to see this kind of anger and angst in a family. Perhaps for some it was even a bit reassuring, to think that others went through what they did, and that not all families had a golden-glow life of all smiles that Hollywood tended to portray.

Interestingly, background stories about this movie indicate that Marlon stayed in character throughout filming - even when not on set - and that it greatly upset Vivian to have him be that way. So perhaps her looking down at him on film is a reflection of how the woman herself felt about his acting technique. If that's the case, maybe his technique was quite effective, to get each one of them to give the most authentic performance possible.

While I appreciate the acting immensely in this movie, it's not a movie I would personally want to watch repeatedly. There is too much seething anger and despair for me, and there's already enough of that in the world.",1324512000,3,2818,4.494140625
100998,5,0790729377,"""A Streetcar Named Desire"" (Warner Bros., 1951) was director Elia Kazan's seventh film.

A troubled Southern belle, Blanche DuBois (Vivien Leigh), arrives in New Orleans to live with her sister, Stella (Kim Hunter), and brother-in-law, Stanley Kowalski (Marlon Brando). The seemingly genteel and delicate Blanche is shocked by the decrepit state of her sister's French Quarter flat and by the brutish manners of her husband. She quickly latches onto one of Stanley's friends, the comparably well-mannered Mitch (Karl Malden), and sees in him a safe harbor in the storm. Stanley resents Blanche's intrusion and haughty demeanor and soon discovers the secrets of her sordid past, which he reveals to Mitch and Stella. Mitch rejects Blanche and she descends into madness. In a rousing climax to their game of ""cat and mouse,"" Stanley rapes Blanche and she is subsequently dispatched to a sanitarium.

Elia Kazan directed Tennessee William's Pulitzer Prize-winning play on Broadway where it had a two-year run and adapted the play to film. Although a few scenes were shot on location in New Orleans, most of ""Streetcar"" was filmed in studio.

Nominated for twelve Academy Awards, ""Streetcar"" won Best Actress (Leigh), Best Supporting Actress (Hunter) and Best Supporting Actor (Malden). Kazan had been nominated for Best Director and Brando for Best Actor. Although he didn't win an Oscar, Brando's performance was a stunning tour de force and revolutionized film acting. Jessica Tandy played the part of Blanche on Broadway but Leigh was brought aboard for the film version due to her draw power. Although Leigh won an Academy Award, her portrayal is a bit over-the-top. Malden is great and Hunter is okay. Alex North's jazzy score is wonderful. The cinematography is good but the viewer tires of seeing Leigh's fading beauty through a cheesecloth. Richard Day and George Hopkins deservedly won the Oscar for art direction.

As an interesting aside, William's choice of a Polish American character for the role of the brutish brother-in-law was no accident. The working-class, ""dumb Polak,"" stereotype was quite prevalent throughout America in the 1950's and it would peak in the 1960's and 1970's. Surprisingly, Polish American academia has not addressed the ""dumb Polak"" phenomenon in a substantial way.

This package contains two DVDs; one for the film and the other for special features. Commentary is provided by Rudy Behlmer, Jeff Young, and Karl Malden.  Very little of the commentary is devoted to scenes from the film, most is a discussion of the personalities involved with the play and film.

Special features include: ""Elia Kazan: A Director's Journey,"" a wonderful 1995 documentary of the filmmaker narrated by Eli Wallach. Also included are five documentary shorts: A Streetcar on Broadway, A Streetcar in Hollywood, Censorship and Desire, North and the Music of the South, and An Actor Named Brando. These documentaries basically rehash the same information provided in the commentary but the clips of Karl Malden and Kim Hunter are priceless. Also included are film and audio outtakes and a Brando screen test. Censored by the film industry at the time of its initial theatrical release, this DVD presents ""Streetcar"" in its original version.

""A Streetcar Named Desire"" is considered a cinematic milestone and is ranked # 45 on the American Film Institute's 1998 listing of the 100 Greatest American Films. This is a nice DVD package of a very important movie which elevated Kazan to the ranks of America's finest directors.",1313625600,6,3538,5.227513227513228
100999,5,0790729377,"I've studied the play, but never saw this film until I bought a copy of the DVD recently.  It won four Oscars.  It was the first time three acting Oscars were ever awarded for the same film.  Interestingly, Marlon Brando who was nominated lost to Humphrey Bogart in ""The African Queen.""

Vivian Leigh is so elegantly moving in this play.  Several decades ago, I saw Sandy Dennis play the role at the Robertson Theatre in Chicago.  What an amazing performance!  Leigh's Blanche is not quite so fluttery and vulnerable as Dennis was onstage, but the character moves magically through the events to the last frames as she descends into madness.  I recently watched the documentary&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-the-Bleep-Do-We-Know/dp/B0006UEVQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What the Bleep Do We Know!?</a>.  In that, they made a comment that a nervous breakdown is the failure to adapt to changing circumstances.  I thought that hit the nail on the head as far as Blanche's character.

Marlon Brando's performance is a great one.  He listens so completely that we feel we can see the character's thoughts as they bubble up in the expressions on his face.  There is one moment at the birthday party right before Stanley explodes where he becomes completely still, soaking in the situation that revolts him.  He holds that for four or five seconds before banging his fist on the table.  His contrasts are superb.

Karl Malden won the supporting Oscar as Mitch, the aging best friend who wants to find a girl.  Malden does an excellent job.  Kim Hunter's role as Stella is likewise gold.  Those moments where we see her drawn to Stanley so strongly, as if by magnetism or hypnosis, are stokes of genius.  Director Elia Kazan and screenwriter Tennessee Williams also had Oscar nominations.  Richard Day and George James Hopkins won the Oscar for Art and Set Decoration Black & White.  Lucinda Ballard was nominated for costume design, which was won that year by Edith Head for ""A Place in the Sun.""  The film was nominated for Best Picture, which went to ""An American in Paris.""

2/06: Take a delicate, pretty flower. It's all about ""Oh Dahling,"" ""Precious things,"" and the likes. Enter an animal who tears it all up and smashes it all into pieces. That's what happened between Blanche DuBois and Stanley Kowalski. A Streetcar Named Desire is a fast, furious film that redefines the word acting. It is an important film in terms of acting, emotions, character work, and censorship issue. Marlon Brando, in this film, makes a name for himself as the most influential actor for the next generation of actors that would come and take what was so evident of Brando's style. Vivien Leigh tops herself in A Streetcar Named Desire, over what she had done in Gone with the Wind. Never again acting will be this good as compared to what Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh have done in A Streetcar Named Desire. This is all about naked passion, raw emotions, and fire in clash with sensitivity, pretentiousness, and airiness. In the end, A Streetcar Named Desire is truly revered for setting standards of what a film is supposed to be all about. All in all, A Streetcar Named Desire contains an outstanding cast giving tremendous performances with a brilliant story that is marvelously directed by Elia Kazan.

7/11: A Streetcar Named Desire is a landmark film because it is about a changing of guards between Old Hollywood and New Hollywood through Vivien Leigh and Marlon Brando. Obviously, the cast was intimidated by Marlon's presence, and Vivien stayed with him mightily throughout the film to the point of giving the third greatest acting performance in screen history. Finally, it's Marlon who steals the film and becomes an overnight superstar based on his raw animalism and indescribable method acting. It's unlike any kind of acting seen before the film, and he should be rightly credited for single-handedly changing acting as it was known before that time. A Streetcar Named Desire is an important film for this reason alone. Every time I see it, I see greatness, and I see nothing else but Brando and Vivien's titanic performances. All in all, Elia Kazan does something so remarkable in A Streetcar Named Desire that we all forget that it was supposed to be a theatrical play.",1310774400,4,2230,4.881266490765172

101003,5,0790729377,"I have seen this movie over the decades of my life as I grew from a naive and innocent teenager to a blossoming twenty something, then a mature thirtyish, the wisdom of my forties  and now an aging baby boomer.  In each part of my life I saw this movie through different eyes.  Now I have come back to it once more, with much life experience, heartache and losse and have an even deeper appreciation for this brilliant movie.

Elia Kazan manages to make the transition from the stage play that he directed to this scintillating movie version with almost all of the original cast intact.  The casting of Vivien Leigh as Blanche Dubois was the only change, due to the necessity of having a marquee name to get the movie made.  Karl Malden and Kim Hunter were Broadway stage actors and unknowns in Hollywood.  Marlon Brando had only made one previous film, ""The Men"", but was also still unknown to movie audiences.  Of course, all that would change after the world saw his mesmerizing, fiery, sexually raw, intense portrayal of Stanley Kowalski.  In the hands of a lesser actor, Stanley Kowalski could have come off as a two-dimensional, cardboard cartoonish caricature of a neanderthal brute.  However, in Brando's hands, he comes across as a multi-layered, complex, ambivalent, mercurial man who can change in a heartbeat from a wife-beating drunken brute to a lost, needy, vulnerable, childlike man who has a surprising tenderness at the most unexpected times.  This is the genius of Brando.  One never knows quite what to expect from one scene to the next and this adds to the already tense, tightly wound, emotionally charged atmosphere.

Vivien Leigh's Blanche Dubois is a faded southern belle, desperately clinging to a lost past, an aristocratic upbringing on the family estate Belle Rive, a life that is dead and gone forever.  Blanche has created an artificial world of fantasy and illusion to hide how lonely and desolate her reality has become.  She has never gotten over the trauma of falling in love with a young man who betrayed her love.  She turned on him cruelly and he killed himself. Blanche is still haunted by this tragedy and has never really been able to get beyond it.  She seems to be a woman incapable of coping with life's tragedies and losses, the setbacks and difficulties that one encounters along the way.  She must pretend to be that ageless southern belle, but in reality she has stooped so low as to seduce a seventeen year old student, causing her to be fired from her job as an english teacher.  After the loss of Belle Rive she took up residence at a second rate hotel and essentially prostitued herself with a long line of strange men, until finally she was asked to leave.  She has fallen a long way, but is determined to keep up the fragile facade of her past, holding a tenuous grip on reality.

Stanley is Blanche's nemesis, the one who discovers the truth about her past. It's interesting how my view of Stanley and Blanche has changed over the years.  I can now understand why Stanley unmasked Blanche and ended her chance of marrying his best friend Mitch.  After the scene in which Stanley beats Stella in a drunken tirade and causes her to run to the upstairs neighbor, but finally come back home, the next morning he overhears a conversation between Blanche and Stella. He hears Blanche describe him as ""common"", a ""survivor of the stone age"" and say that she has a plan to get them both out of there.  Once Stanley realizes that Blanche is a threat to his very survival, to his territory, his family, then there is no question that he will do whatever he must to destroy her.  The battle lines are drawn between Stanley and Blanche and Stella and her conflicting loyalties are caught right in the middle. However, as I watch this movie today, I see that it is inevitable that Blanche will lose this epic battle.  She is no match for Stanley, who is tough, uncompromising, strong, determined and outraged at this woman who he sees as a two-faced, pretentious hypocrite without a job, money and totally destitute.  I also believe that Stanley is aware enough to realize Blanche's precarious mental state.  He senses that she is on the edge, a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  All he has to do is help it along.

I no longer see Blanche as a victim.  I feel empathy for her plight and her slow descent into madness.  It's not a pretty site.  However, I can also see that her lies, constructed out of her own necessity to keep up this sham existence, have also caused pain and hurt to others. I can understand Stanley telling his friend Mitch the truth, rather than stand by and watch him make a fool of himself. I don't believe that Mitch or anyone else can ever save Blanche from her fate.  At one point in the movie, after the birthday party for Blanche in which Mitch has failed to show up because of what Stanley told him, we see Stanley and Stella arguing heatedly.  Stella asks what will Blanche do now if Mitch won't marry her.  Stanley utters a line which seems to be a precursor of Blanche's fate.  He says - ""Oh, her future is all mapped out for her"". He gives her a ticket back to Oriole and Blanche is devastated and Stella is angered at this callous gesture.

When I watched this movie earlier in my life, I actually felt as someone else did here in their review. I wasn't sure if Stanley raped Blanche or not.  That scene that passed for a rape back in 1951, seems somewhat ambiguous now.  I never read the play and now I wish that I had done so a long time ago.  It would have cleared up a good deal of my confusion.  I totally understand the constraints in which the creators of this movie were working back in the days of strict censorship.  There are controversial and taboo subjects in this story and some of it had to be removed or at least watered down. I have researched the play online and know the actual story as Williams originally wrote it.  Stanley does rape Blanche in a final act of domination and control.  In doing so, he pushes her over the edge and the last vestiges of her sanity are destroyed.

What I have also come to understand, is that Tennessee Williams didn't write a story about good versus evil, right versus wrong.  This is not a morality tale.  This is reality versus illusion.  Stanley represents the modern world in all its raw coarseness, survival of the fittest.  Blanche represents a bygone world, a halcyon existence that has faded into the past, a world of frivolity, elegance, gentility and grace.  She cannot adapt to this new world and retreats into a world of make-believe.  After the scene in which Mitch angrily confronts Blanche and leaves, having found out the truth for himself, we see Blanche alone in the darkened apartment. She has gotten all dressed up with a tiara and ballgown and is conversing with imaginary guests, retreating into a long ago night of partying at Belle Rive. She is once more the southern belle, humming along to imaginary music.  Her reverie is interrupted by Stanley arriving home from the hospital.  The two of them will spend the night alone there together.  The final confrontation will inevitably take place in the ugliest possible way.  Their destinies will collide one last time and, when it is over, Blanche will have gone completely out of her mind.

The original ending was changed at the insistence of the censors, but I believe that they didn't achieve what they intended. Somehow Kazan filmed the ending in such an ambiguous way with Stella running upstairs to the neighbor vowing that this time she won't ever go back. It isn't convincing, not with what we know of her relationship with Stanley.  I always felt that she never really left for good.  Now that I know the real ending, it's almost as though I knew what Tennessee Williams had in mind without ever reading the play.  The censors just succeeded in muddying everything, clouding it with doubt.  That's why the ending never really made sense to me.  I think that people will come away with their own ideas about the ending.  The triumph is that this movie got made at all.  The basic story is still intact, the actors stayed faithful to their characters and Kazan's brilliant direction made it all come together in the end.

Truth has a way of coming through even when some are determined to try to cover it up.  The censors didn't really change the ending.  They didn't take away a powerful story of passion, betrayal, deceit, lust, brutal truth and a climactic battle that ended inevitably.  This movie has stood the test of time and is as powerful and unsettling and relevant today as it was sixty years ago.  Everyone owes it to themselves to watch true greatness.",1297468800,9,8684,4.613029315960912

101005,5,0790729377,"I wanted to see what the hype about Marlon Brandon was all about in this movie. Boy, was I rewarded. He is phenomenal here and greatly overshadows everything else. Vivian Leigh, who plays the crazy Blanche Dubois, was a much bigger star at the time this was made in 1951, but her performance pales next to Brando who is modern, vital, unpredictable and could just as well have been something out of 2011 as almost 60 years ago. Stella is next best, doing very well showing her lust. The young Karl Malden is also good. The extras get a bit tedious, but I was fascinated by the one about censorship and the hurdles this innocent play had to overcome with the Hollywood code and the Catholic ""Legion of Decency."" You will laugh at what was deemed immoral back then, and marvel at the side by side views of what was cut compared with the restored version. We have come far.",1295222400,,870,4.44375
101025,5,0790729377,"""A Streetcar Named Desire"" has always been one of my very favorite films from the 1950's. Highly regarded as a film that changed the way movies were made both in story content and visually, ""Streetcar"" has held up extremely well for a movie that is now nearly sixty years old.

 Tennessee Williams wrote the original play that the film was based on and many critics regard this work as William's best. The movie deals with a washed-up sounthern belle named Blanche who is proned to alcohol. She visits her sister Stella in New Orleans where upon meeting Stella's husband Stanley it is evident that a strong sexual bond exists between Blanche and her newly discovered brother-in-law.

 The film is known not only for William's powerful and moving script, but for the powerhouse performances of all the leads, especially Marlon Brando who exudes not only moodyness, but extreme sexual tension for Blanche. Despite the fact that the viewer knows he will ""get his way"" with her you somehow feel she is getting what she desires.

 All the leads received Oscars, including Vivien Leigh who played Blanche, but unfortunately the Academy overlooked Brando. Kim Hunter (Stella) and Karl Marldan (Mitch) also walked away with Oscar gold and the film itself was nominated for Best Picture.

 Like most early 1950's films ""Streetcar"" was made in full screen so that is the format you will get upon viewing the DVD. The bonuses on this two disc set are flawless and they include three minutes of extra footage dropped from the original version, commentaries, documentaries, and more.

 Come, sit back, and watch ""Streetcar""...a movie you will watch over and over!

 In 1984 ABC aired a remake of this film starring Ann-Margret as Blanche, Beverly D'Angelo as Stella, and the sexy Treat Williams as Stanley. That version, although a made-for-TV film, is much more explicit, especially the rape scene. Ann-Margret actually suffered bruises from doing that scene. Unfortunately, like many films made for televison this eighties telefilm is not available on DVD, but several years ago it was out on VHS format.",1285804800,4,2093,5.017341040462428

It's said that John Garfield refused the role of Stanley as he didn't want to be outshone by the female lead. Marlon Brando proved that fear very wrong. He's just brilliant as the animalistic Kowalski. It's an overpowering and unforgettable performance. For Miss Leigh, playing Blanche was typecasting. The actress had bipolar disorder and years later fantasized that she really was the tragic DuBois.

Although it isn't shown, we know what he does to Blanche. This violent act pushes her off the precipe of fantasy (where Blanche has been precariously hanging for perhaps many years) and right into full-blown insanity.

101032,5,0790729377,"So much has been said about ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" that any more praise might seem like a case of gilding the lily, or painting the peacock. But the film remains, and will remain, one of cinema's crowning achievements. I would place it in a Top Ten List of movies.

It's a given that Vivien Leigh (Best Actress winner here) and Marlon Brando (lost to Bogie for ""The African Queen"") gave outstanding performances, two of the greatest pieces of acting Hollywood ever saw. Leigh's Blanche makes me almost forget there even was a Scarlett O'Hara. Watching the phony, dependent, boozing Blanche DuBois cling so tightly to this facade she's made and then become unmasked is great to behold. What a showcase for Leigh. Brando is absolutely amazing in this role; he screams and thrashes and sneers and makes a ruckus... and then as Stanley he can turn on a dime and be a vulnerable, wounded little boy. This is such a fascinating part, so dimensional and multifaceted. And I'm sure that this performance changed the way actors viewed and created their craft.

Another thing comes to mind: Stanley Kowalski in this film is one of the sexiest characters ever to grace the screen. He may be a slob and a brute, but this man is the ideal: the raw, seething, beautiful bad boy.

Naturally, Kim Hunter and Karl Malden are super (both received supporting Oscar statues). These are acting professionals, clearly.

Every time I view the film I fall in love (and pity) with Blanche and Stanley all over again... even though she's a delusional house of cards and he's a bumptious wife beater. They seem real. We've known or met people like them. And they are the focus of the conflict in this story. And conflict is what it's all about. These two opposing forces come together and cause an inferno. This is a tragedy, nearly Shakespearian. There was actually an opera made that was based on this play, in 1995. If any play/film begs for an opera I suppose this would be it. It's so fiery, and also so melancholy.

I don't know specifically what Tennessee Williams was trying to say; however I can speculate, and I believe that he might have meant that gentle people have a tough time of it in this world-- it's a rough and tumble place, often unappealing, ugly, vulgar and loud. That's just one theory, and it may not even be valid. But of course many people have studied the play and come up with different theories on its meanings and its symbolism... from the use of light to the names of the streetcars we hear in the opening scene. Bottom line, there's much meaning here about people and the world.

Elia Kazan's direction is wonderful; I enjoy his work (East of Eden, On the Waterfront, Gentleman's Agreement, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Baby Doll, A Face in the Crowd, etc.) His films are often very earthy, and they tackle issues and subjects other directors would scamper away from timidly. This is his masterpiece, for my money.

The whole atmosphere of ""Streetcar"" is excellently rendered. Stella and Stanley's home is delightfully decrepit in its way; everything seems in a state of disrepair. This is a winner of set design and artistic touches; the place could be a haunted house if there were no characters present. There's a claustrophobia in the film that adds to the tension (this story is as tense as it gets)... the tiny apartment is guaranteed to generate some visceral goings on. Elia Kazan had a set created that had moveable walls so that as the film progressed, the walls slowly seem to close in on Blanche. The movie just oozes and drips with tension and suspense, Southern gothic stuff. A feeling of impending doom seems to bubble beneath the surface.

The sets and the props and even the sound effects-- train sounds and such-- are terrific. Every little detail adds to the film's brilliance and its tumultuous mood. And then there's the sultry score by Alex North, which basically screams sex (and/or violence). Not only is the music loud and bawdy at times but it also has a tinge of the tragic in it. Just the opening credits alone are enormously charged simply from the music itself. But also it should be mentioned that the more quiet and subtle parts of the music are also very effective.

Watching the movie again, I am also taken with the lighting. Whether we notice it or not, it has a large effect on the drama. Careful and meticulous choices were made, if I'm not mistaken, and it shows. It affects us, it manipulates our emotions, and it adds to the scathing drama.

What a pleasure it is to watch ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", whether it's the third time or the thirtieth. Even though it's such a sad tale (especially the fate of Blanche), it's an extraordinary film. It got an impressive twelve Oscar nominations (won the three acting awards, plus B&W Art Direction/Set Design).

Somehow it never gets old, never fades (like certain Southern ladies do). Watching ""Streetcar"", you get caught up in the brutal and gripping melodrama. It's a moving, wonderful movie experience unlike any other.",1272499200,6,5014,4.712328767123288
101033,5,0790729377,"I remember seeing ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" for the first time.

It was like witnessing a revelation.

The characters are compelling, the story is multi-level, and the cinematography is stunning.  Stanley Kowalski's animalism is matched only by Blanche DuBois' inexplicable cruelty.  Williams and Kazan collectively animate the sometimes profound differences between men and women and the result is an epic struggle, almost biblical in proportion.

Cut to the chase:

In the end, Blanche is reduced to nothingness.  Stanley destroys her, or rather, what little remains of her fragile personality.  There is no communion or communication between them.  Even though Blanche is his sister-in-law, Stanley does not conceal his feelings of absolute hatred for her as he violently finalizes their relationship.  Unlike the very subtle Blanche who would give anything to rid the world of him, Stanley does not hide his burning desire to destroy her.

""I've always relied on the kindness of Strangers,"" is a phrase cloaked in deception.  It is a spoken by Blanche, as if in a language completely foreign to Stanley.  And, it is the inevitable ending to this modern tragedy.

""A Streetcar named Desire"" is a still a very powerful film which will polarize many viewers along the lines of gender.  It is an exceptional story which holds up well after over fifty years.",1266883200,2,1358,5.165137614678899

The only problem i have is that i actually had no idea that Stanley had raped Blanche in the end. I learned that from watching the special features on disc 2. I guess in that era they really couldn't show much as far as a rape scene, but I really had no idea. So when the sent Blanche away to be committed, i really didn't quite understand why, or what pushed her over the edge. But knowing everything, it makes the film even better.
Second issue i have is the crap quality of the dvd itself, i realize its an old film, but the sound quality was completely unacceptable. I had my brand new tv turned up nearly as loud as it goes and i still couldn't understand everything as it was muffled. eventually i just put the subtitles on as i was afraid i'd miss something.

I had not seen this in years and it was a delight to watch--especially with the uncensored director's cut that contained scenes and gestures blocked by the censors at the time.  A streetcar of any other name would not have smelled as sweet.  This movie, its rich and sometimes hazy black and white tones, won three Oscars for acting alone.  It is not hard to understand why when you see the young Marlon Brando portraying Stanley Kowalski, bad boy, and Kim Hunter playing Stella! Stella! Stella! his pregnant wife with abused spouse syndrome.  Vivien Leigh, the Brit who has nailed Southern womanhood famously and truly almost steals the show.  Karl Malden is excellent as Blanche Dubois' confused and emotionally drained suitor.  We feel he truly loves her in spite of what she is, but any chances they had were interfered with by Stanley who is vindictive because Louisiana's Napoleonic Code will bear no fruit for him in the wake of the demise of the Belle Rive, Dubois family estate.",1245888000,,1090,4.7967914438502675

Also the play's lovers speak of how the ending is different, which after listening makes more sense to me than the movie's ending.

101072,5,0790729377,"Considered by many to be one of the great American staples; `A Streetcar Named Desire' is in all honestly one of the greatest films of all time.  It truly lives up to the hype and delivers one of the most satisfying and gratifying cinematic experiences anyone can wish for.  With dynamic acting, solid writing and daring direction, `A Streetcar Named Desire' is truly desirous.

The film tells of the conflict between disturbed Southern Belle Blanche DuBois and the simple yet brutish Stanley Kowalski.  When Blanche travels to see her sister Stella she never imagined the trouble she would not only cause but ultimately find herself in.  She immediately begins to butt heads with Stella's husband Stanley, their ideals and personalities at complete opposite ends, but she attempts to make things work, for as long as she can.  The film does a marvelous job of depiction a true loss of one's grasp of reality as we see Blanche and everyone around her sucked into a loss of hope.  Blanche arrives at her sister's New Orleans doorstep after losing her home (their childhood home) under circumstances that Blanche is not quick to relay.  Blanche seems to be placing up a faade to hide a past she is most ashamed of, but what sort of woman is she really?  Stanley, determined to deliver a reality check to everyone, searches out the truth despite the harm it may cause (it can be stated that Stanley receives the biggest `reality check' of all).

The film dramatically and effectively approaches these characters with a stark realism that makes their every movement and action all the more poignant.

I adore films of this nature, as many who read my reviews already know, for it delivers an emotional shock to the soul, and those connections make me feel invested in a film.  `A Streetcar Named Desire' is quite frankly one of the best examples of brutal honesty captured on film.  There is no sugarcoating here, none whatsoever.  Everything is stripped bare and delivered in a frank yet morally ambiguous nature; so much so that we become a major player in the films unraveling.

And then there is the acting; tour de force across the board.

Let's get the easy out of the way.  Kim Hunter and Karl Malden both deserved the Oscar's they won for their wonderful supporting turns here, adding layers with each scene to their characters but also to the leads as well.  Hunter is flawless as Stella, giving her a naivety that beautifully centers her character, grounds her into her surroundings and into our hearts.  That smoldering descent down the staircase is probably the single best scene in the film and makes for the one of the steamiest and most passionate scenes in cinema; ever.  Malden is also effortlessly captivating as Mitch, the clueless suitor who finds a light in Blanche that others cannot see.  His desire to have that someone is so passionate that when Stanley snuffs out that passion we are heartbroken; betrayed even.

What is so wonderful about the casting of Vivian Leigh and Marlon Brando is that their styles are so distinct that they complement the very conflict erupting within their characters.  Leigh is a very mannered actress who mirrors the actresses best suited for the stage.  The fact that this is a stage play adaptation works in her favor.  She reminds me of Julianne Moore in her delivery.  One could say that she appears to be acting, and in this case it works brilliantly.  Marlon Brando is a much more natural actor, his delivery appearing fluid and relaxed.  He's far less controlled or restrictive in his performance.  You can liken him to Russell Crowe.  When these two actors share the screen it is such a blessing, watching them battle one another in more than one way.  It is the definition of inspired casting, and watching these two performance work to outdo one another is a treat to the viewer.

The fact that Brando is the only actor in the bunch to lose the Oscar is a shame, since he was by far the best performer here.

In the end I will wholeheartedly recommend this masterpiece of a film.  It gets better and better every time I watch it, and truth be told it is truly one of the best films to ever be labeled the best of anything.  Sporting one of the greatest ensemble casts, one of the most powerfully riveting scripts and some of the most inspired direction of it's time and any other, `A Streetcar Named Desire' is a knockout on all levels and deserves to be rendered as such.",1233100800,4,4433,4.698186528497409

There life is a roughly passionate one which intensifies when Stella's southern belle sister Blanche DuBois arrives.  Blanche, portrayed so beautifully and truly by Vivien Leigh, that her husband Sir Lawrence Olivier once commented on how it almost broke her to play this role.  Blanche is mentally unstable, broken by the world and by distorted ideals.

Blanche has a rough background and is hesitant to share the truth of her visit with her sister and brother-in-law Stanley.  She tells Stella and Stanley she lost the family mansion, Belle Reve, because of problems with deceased family members that ultimately resulted in financial losses aka Belle Reve.

By: Kevin Green

""A Streetcar Named Desire"" was a brilliant depiction of a marital angst triumphing over sibling affection. Although Blanches' (Vivien Leigh) performance was a bit too theatrical for the big screen it was still a performance well worth her academy award. Blanche's only tie to reality, Stella (Kim Hunter), broke away from her and hence allowed Blanche to fall deeper into insanity.

Marlon Brando displayed a very natural performance as Stanley befitting of an Oscar. Mitch (Karl Malden) provided a good opposite to Stanley as a well-mannered gentleman. Overall, ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" is a deeply passionate film that expresses realistically the common emotional tribulations a person may go through some time or another.",1227139200,,780,5.429752066115703
101099,4,0790729377,"Elia Kazan's adaptation of ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" is magnificent and ahead of its time with the issues it addresses.  His interpretation of Tenessee Williams' classic play is powerful and dramatic.  Kazan employs a fantastic cast.  Marlon Brandon plays an impeccable Stanley with intense emotions and a strong disposition.  Blanche is also portrayed very well.  Vivien Leigh brings Blanche fragility and vulnerability and she interacts with the other characters flawlessly.  Though her emotions are slightly over the top, this brings life to her character.  Overall this rendition of Williams' classic is a must see and is highly recommended",1226966400,,645,5.520408163265306
101100,3,0790729377,"This film explores the women's mental problem through the character named Blanch.  At the climax, Stanley raped Blanche and revealed what she had done in the past.  Finally, Blanche broke down mentally and was sent to mental hospital.  The climax of this film is when Blanch was mentally broke down, so the beginning of this film is when her mental problem was revealed to audience.  Audience will know she had some mental problem when Stanley asked her to give him paper about selling her house.  She did not respond his question, and Stanley tried to find papers by himself from her bag.  She was so upset and looked awkward when he tried to find papers.  You will probably think that she had some mental problem.
  When I saw the scene that Stanly tried to find paper, I thought Blanch was strange and she may have mental problem.  At the climax when she mentally broke down, I could easily understand why she looks strange and wired at the beginning.  The actor of Blanch gives you some clue of her mental problem at the beginning and lead smoothly to climax.
  This movie make you think what is wrong with Blanch at the beginning.  You never know why she was strange and what happened to her in the past.  You have to wait until the climax to know the truth.  The structure is really looks like the one of the mystery.  I read many mystery books and films, and I feel this film have same structure.  For example, in the film of Da Vinci code, you do not the truth at the beginning of the story.  You do not know who the culprit is.  You will know the truth at the end.
  I recommend the movie to the people who like mystery.  You will really enjoy reasoning what is the truth by watching this film.",1226793600,,1703,4.387820512820513
101101,3,0790729377,"""A Streetcar Named Desire"" is a classic portrayal of what both money and alcohol can do.  The movie also reflected on many taboo topics such as homosexuality, domestic violence and rape as well as Blanche's affair with a young man. This movie was way ahead of its time and opened the eyes of its audience as well as movies to come.  Brando's acting was intense, for his emotions kept the entire performance alive.  The acting of Stella and Blanche was good but their characters were much less dramatic then Stanley's, even Blanche's character did not compare for me. The movie has a good plotline but might be lost today because of its out datedness, the music in the background might just put a younger audience to sleep.

Blanche is the main character, a delicate and anxious young woman who has come to live with her sister Stella and her sisters husband Stanley to lead a new beginning.

101144,5,0790729377,"After seeing a performance of Tennessee Williams' gripping play ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" at a local event, I immediately bought the award-winning film. I was unsure how a brutally powerful story about the demise of one woman's reputation could be translated into a film, but I was not disappointed. This two-disc set restores some of the ""objectionable content"" that almost derailed the film's production, and the movie is as enjoyable and thrilling as the play itself, with the exception of an ending that was tweaked to appease 1950s sensibilities.

The performances are simply stellar. Brando is both hilarious and frightening in his breakout role as Stanley Kowalski, and Vivien Leigh turns in a graceful and haunting performance as Blanche DuBois, the Southern belle whose attempts to right her world when she moves in with her sister Stella and sister's husband Stanley go hopelessly awry.

In streetcar, he plays Stanley to the tee.  You don't catch him acting at all.  You whole heartedly believe him as this animal of a husband and you despise him for what he's doing to an obvious delusional woman.  I even feel for Stella being caught between two different people she loved.  I agree the material is stunning for its time and I continue to be impressed with Kazan's direction.

101146,5,0790729377,"Elia Kazan's ""Streetcar Named Desire"" is a wonderful interpretation of William's classic play.  Like many of Tennessee William's plays ""Streetcar"" depicts the moral ruination of the post-civil war South.  Blanche Dubois, in particular, is tragic and represents a ""belle idee"" gone hopelessly wrong.  We learn how she has tried but failed to hold the old family home and honor intact.  As a school teacher in Oriole, Mississippi she has failed in the most terrible way possible.  She has not only prostituted herself but has seduced young school-age boys.  As a consequence, despite her faded aristocracy, she has been run out of town and wound up on the doorstep of her sister, a woman quite content to reach for the gutter.

Her Pollack brother-in-law, played by Marlon Brando, is so miserable that he's great.  He takes every opportunity to insult his freeloading sister-in-law and--with his wife in the hospital having a baby--he plumbs the depths of his own depravity and rapes the frightened and increasingly confused Blanche.

Blanche, who had a fleeting opportunity to marry the naive Karl Maldon, sees her opportunity torn away from her when Maldon learns the black truth of her Oriole history.  Blanche retreats into madness.  She finally meets her aristocratic savior in the form of an elderly physician who arrives to take her to a mental institution.  ""No one"", as Ray Charles sang, ""is saved.""  The film is beautiful in its horror.

Her commitment is evident in this complex portrayal of a southern belle who looses the battle for sanity. Marlon Brando, Kim Hunter, and Karl Malden all turn in deeply personal performances making this film ahead of its time. Their work in Streetcar is a rare window into the development of American film acting at a time when this unique, highly naturalistic style, popularized by the Actors Studio, revolutionized cinema.",1214438400,,769,5.416666666666667
101149,5,0790729377,"There is really not much one can add by way of commenting on the magnificence of Miss Leigh's performance here. Perhaps Mr. Williams said it best when he told her that she brought aspects of Blanche's character to the surface, that he, himself never imagined.

That is not in any way to minimize the interpretations of Jessica Tandy, (who originated the role on Broadway) or, of Judith Evelyn, (and Miss Evelyn must have been superb as, in a sense, she too, was born to play Blanche.)

And despite the superb musical score, art direction, and performances of the rest of the cast, this is Miss Leigh's picture.

Blanche's complexity defies easy analysis. Does she represent the collapse of the Old South? (yes to a degree) but, more particularly, she represents a type of lady, (which Mr. Williams knew well and whom the feminists would prefer no longer existed--but in fact does--and not just south of the Mason Dixon line) who requires the protection and security of the plantation culture from which she sprang.

One can easily imagine her on the shaded portico of Belle Rive, in gauzy chiffons, and protected by a gallant (though tolerant) husband, while she spends her days enrapt in the dream world which so enthralls her.

Indeed, one may see her as the ""flip-side"" of Scarlett O'Hara--this time the Southern Belle who didn't triumph--how fascinating that the same actress played both roles.

Perhaps Blanche was not destined to triumph but she is far from being a fool. Notice how Williams cannily has her refer to Hawthorne and Poe, not to mention her having been to college. Then, too, a seemingly minor, but very telling detail is her wearing of reading glasses.

Yes, she represents the world of the intellect and the world of culture. Who else, for pity's sake, in that crumbling tenement would have any idea what she means in her reference to ""Della Robbia blue...""?

Certainly not Stella, about whom Thornton Wilder rightly carped, does not seem in any way to be from the same lineage as Blanche, her temperement not at all in keeping with the daughter of an aristocratic house, (not even a renegade daughter who realizes she is slumming, and knows why she crossed over the bridge).

Indeed, excellent actress though she is, Kim Hunter is far too proletariat to believe as ever having been a part of Belle Rive, and seems quite at home with Stanley.

However, we musn't make too much of this, since she was in the original, and Mr. Williams in using Miss Hunter, seems to be saying something profound about the differences between her and Blanche, (note the facial expressions Blanche makes whenever Stella speaks admiringly of Stanley--particularly at the bowling alley--it's clear that Stella's temperament baffles her.)

Then there is their respective choice of mates (which speaks volumes), for Blanche, a sensitive poet, for Stella, the cretinous Stanley. It's too bad that we don't even get to see a photograph of Blanche's deceased husband, Allan, which might have served as an interesting visual contrast.

All of which suggests, these two sisters really don't seem to understand each other very well, and their mutual attempts to come to terms with what they do share, constitutes some of the film's most touching passages.

And Blanche for all of her imagined, and/or real superiority is a woman with a stained past--for she has fallen too, though as Miss Leigh herself averred, these lapses with soldiers and 17 year olds had little to do with the corporeal, and everything to do with the search for security and protection. For Blanche, and when seen through the unreal pink light of a Chinese lantern, even a callow teenage boy can become her knight in shining armor.

For his part, Mr. Brando is very effective, though his character is painted with a very broad brush, and it is a testament to his talent, that his Stanley avoids caricature, (though at times he comes uncomfortably close, seeming to anticipate Archie Bunker). Nonetheless, some of his lines are both priceless and hilarious, ""...I met a dame once who said 'I am the glamorous type' I said, 'So what!'...""

A splendid though shattering film. Kudos to all involved.",1213747200,2,4159,4.896159317211949

101153,5,0790729377,"The music at the beginning of ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" sends jolts through me that stir my emotions like a violent wind whipping flames through my soul every time I watch this DVD. That may sound dramatic, but it is truly how I feel when I hear the music of ""A Streetcar Named Desire."" To me, it is not merely the music of a film's score or music that is representative of a single film, but it is the music and the representation of an entire era - an era in which unmatched cinematic history was created. It is the awareness of the stage production that came before the film and the lives lived by those involved in creating the unrivaled work of art that ""Streetcar"" was and still is. We shall never again see the likes of Marlon Brando, Vivien Leigh, Karl Malden, Kim Hunter, Elia Kazan, Tennessee Williams, and others who brought ""Streetcar"" to life.

Marlon Brando is breathtaking, both physically and artistically, in this film. He plays the role of Stanley Kowalski, the brutish brother-in-law of Blanche DuBois, performed, shiningly, by Vivien Leigh. Stanley, the brute, is a character whose value system is quite contrary to that of Marlon Brando who portrays him in this film. Marlon reportedly once said that Stanley Kowalski exhibited ""everything I loathe in men.""

Early on in the film, Stanley meets his wife's sister, Blanche, and takes an immediate disliking to her. Then, throughout the remainder of the film, he works to systematically break her already fragile spirit, driving her further toward insanity - a state of mind she has teetered on for some time already. Stanley is not a man completely devoid of human feelings, however. Despite his egocentric tendencies, his crassness, and his crude behavior, he loves and cares about his wife, Stella, and is loving, tender, and needful where she is concerned.

In one scene, after Stella and Stanley have fought, Stella goes to stay with their upstairs neighbor and Stanley, revived from a drunken state with a cold shower forced upon him by his poker pals, stands haplessly (his clothes dripping wet)at the bottom of the stairs, tearfully, his face wrought with pain and his hands grasping the sides of his face, calling for his wife, ""Stellaaaaaa!"" It is a cry heard around the world and a scene replayed over and over again by fans, reviewers, and talk show hosts for a long time afterward. Stella succumbs to her feelings for Stanley and his need for her in that moment. She makes her way, slowly, to the bottom of the stairs where Stanley has, tearfully, fallen to his knees. She falls into his arms and covers his face with passionate kisses as he lifts her up and carries her into the house. ""Don't ever leave me,"" he says.

Soon after his reconciliation with Stella, Stanley is back to his usual ways and his torment of Blanche is ongoing and relentless, culminating in a scene later in the film in which Stanley physically, emotionally, and sexually assaults Blanche while Stella is away at the hospital, preparing to give birth to her and Stanley's baby. Blanche is driven over the edge by the act. Stella returns from the hospital after giving birth to find her sister in an even more fragile state than before and makes the decision to commit Blanche to a mental institution. Stella's heart breaks for her sister as her sister is taken away and she lashes out at her husband, Stanley, whom she faults for her sister's circumstance. Despite this, Stella's final words in the film ring unconvincing when she tells Stanley never to touch her again and when she vows to never go back home to him again.

""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" written by the incomparable Tennessee Williams under the unparalleled directorial expertise of Elia Kazan, is among the greatest of the greats in films and filmmaking. Each time I have seen it, it has left me with a longing -a wishing to have been there to see the stage production and to have had a part in the creation of this film masterpiece, to have known the players, and to have watched them work in putting together this, one of the best pictures ever made.

For those considering purchasing this two-disk DVD set, it not only contains the film version of ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" but it also contains outtakes and commentaries, including a touching tribute to Marlon Brando by the wonderfully talented Karl Malden. Marlon Brando's screen test for ""Rebel Without A Cause"" is also on one of the disks as well as other inclusions that I was pleased to find.",1193875200,5,4477,4.748071979434448
101193,5,0790729377,"Brando's force-of-nature performance in Kazan's ""Streetcar""--an electrifying mix of brute physicality and smoldering sexuality--made Stanley Kowalski's infamous bellow a permanent part of pop culture and Brando a household name. But the undeniable strength of this film, adapted from the smash Broadway play by Tennessee Williams, is driven as much by the witty, vivid dialogue and ensemble acting as it is the lead actor's Method work. Leigh, Hunter, Karl Malden, Ruby Bond, and Nick Dennis are all terrific, and Alex North's atmospheric jazz score enhances the tense, combustible interplay. Winner of five Oscars, this ""Streetcar"" offers an incredible ride.",1182729600,,659,5.73469387755102
101194,5,0790729377,"Tennessee Williams rightfully takes his place as one of the premier playwrights in the history of the American theater. The relentless turning out of high quality pieces (and other short literary expositions) on subjects that in an earlier day before the 1950's would have not found nearly so receptive an audience.

I saw the movie version of Streetcar long before I read the original play so that, of necessity, the role of Stanley on the page evokes the powerfully strong, sexual and primitive role performed by Marlon Brando and the equally powerful performance by Vivian Leigh as the coquettish down on her heels Blanche Dubois. There are however, important differences between the story line presented in the movie and in the original play version. Some of the more explicit graphically sexual scenes and latent homosexual allusions did not pass muster with the censors of the times. For one familiar with the story from the stage or theater it is well worth going back and reading the original play to get a feel for the tensions that remain unexplored in the other media.

A reading of the play also makes clear something is missing from the productions and that is the sense that the characters are sleepwalking through life with their own private illusions that prevent them each, in the final analysis, from having more than a surface understanding of the others in the claustrophobic little home they inhabit. Blanche will pay, and pay dearly, for not understanding Stanley better as she tries to live the illusion of a fallen, aging Southern Belle. In any case, whether on stage on the screen or on the page this is a great American classic.",1180051200,,1654,4.882562277580071
101195,5,0790729377,"The unfiltered primacy of 27-year old Marlon Brando (in only his second film) cuts through the feverish, Baroque-style histrionics that define Tennessee Williams' near-poetic masterwork. Brando's mastery over the characterization of Stanley Kowalski comes from a precocious ability to undercut the testosterone-driven braggadocio with a rough-hewn sensitivity tied to Stanley's need for Stella. Directed on all cylinders by Elia Kazan, the 1951 adaptation of the Broadway hit has a somewhat stage-bound feel since most of the action takes place within the environs of the Kowalskis' downscale apartment building in New Orleans' French Quarter. However, screenwriter Oscar Saul seizes on the sexual themes of Williams' play and brings a refreshingly adult view to them (at least for the early 1950's), as Kazan guides the principal actors to powerhouse performances that demand our attention.

The relatively small-scale plot focuses on faded Southern belle Blanche DuBois, who comes to visit her younger sister Stella from Mississippi where she held onto a fantasy of gentility and respectability growing up on the family plantation, Belle Reve. Hoping for a safe haven in New Orleans, Blanche is disappointed to see that Stella has married Stanley, an unruly blue-collar worker. Conflict ensues almost immediately between Blanche and Stanley with Stella stuck in the middle. Gradually, Blanche's self-delusions peel away her sanity until a harrowing incident takes her over the edge. Even though Brando dominates every moment he has, Vivien Leigh affectingly counterpoints with one of her most definitive performances as Blanche, the true protagonist of the piece.

Intriguingly, 56 years later, the contrast between Leigh's florid, more ornately theatrical approach and Brando's fearlessly instinctual work comes across almost too extreme with the actress looking all the more pretentious by comparison. Only in the shattering climax do they truly seem on equal ground. The real surprise, especially in the now-unexpurgated version, is Kim Hunter, whose comparatively subtle performance as Stella maintains a delicate balance between supportive sister and lust-driven wife. In a marginally smaller role, Karl Malden is ideally cast as mama's boy Mitch, who gets caught up in Blanche's lies only to be victimized by them. Harry Stradling's evocative cinematography and especially Alex North's jazzy musical score add substantively to the atmosphere of the heady melodrama.

The two-disc 2006 DVD set is a treasure trove of extras. Even though it lacks a direct connection with the scenes, the commentary track provides historical context with tracks recorded separately with 94-year old Malden and film scholars Rudy Behlmer and Jeff Young. The first disc also includes a number of trailers for Kazan's classic films, including three just for ""Streetcar"". Disc two has an informative 75-minute 1994 documentary on the director, ""Elia Kazan: A Director's Journey"" and five featurettes focused on various aspects of the movie - its birth as a Broadway play, its translation to film, the struggles with censorship and the Hayes Office, North's music, and of course, Brando. There are rare outtakes included, though the best surprise is a four-minute screen test Brando did for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rebel-Without-a-Cause/dp/B0007US7EO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rebel Without a Cause</a>.",1178496000,5,3439,5.819444444444445

We, viewers, are blessed that such an ensemble (Kazan, Brando, Leigh, Malden and Hunter) rescued forever one of the peaks of US literature.

101197,5,0790729377,"Great Tennessee Williams play with many autobiographical ingredients. Fantastic acting from everybody. The story is meant to be about Blanche (Vivian Leigh), but Brando completely captivates the audience; it's hard to get one's eyes away from him. Steamy, sexually charged story, but also with a second side, less passionate, and hidden in the background. This other side of the story is actually the mystery that envelops the main character: Blanche. You will have to find out about her, if you don't fall under the spell of Brando (stanley), and eventually miss the original story.

The play develops as a very ambivalent convergence of visions: violent, rude and macho Stanley meets the dreamy and weak Blanche. They play their parts around the pivotal role of Blanche's sister, Stella (who could be also us, the audience). Of course, crude realism, animal instinct love, wins the day over any abstract considerations. But both sides have their ambivalences too. Blanche, as well as Stanley, are not clear cut characters. This convergence of opposites takes place in both of them as well. But that's what lies underneath, if one has interest enough to dig into them.

Elia Kazan did a great job creating the muggy and highly heated atmosphere of French Quarter New Orleans. Sets, music, direction... everything is perfect. One great film that feels like being at the theatre.

A lot of good extras come in the second dvd: Kazan's career documentary; a short about Brando; and extras about the Broadway show and the movie itself. Great package. Mandatory for any decent film collection.",1172707200,,1588,5.1

101199,5,0790729377,"""A Streetcar Named Desire"" is one of those rare movies that combine the best actors/actresses in the business with an amazing director. Vivien Leigh, Marlon Brando & Elia Kazan.

The whole cast deliver the performances of their career's and Kazan shows why he is a genius in the field of direction. This movie swept the Oscar's, winning 3/4 of the acting awards. The only loser was Marlon Brando, who lost to a screen legend at the top of his game, Humphrey Bogart.

The best thing about this movie is the stunning cast. Vivien Leigh plays Blanche in probably the greatest performance in the history of cinema. Kim Hunter is simply breathtaking as Stella and Brando is stunning as Stanley.

The actors here do a great job in bringing a sense of sincerity to their chracters that lacks in most movies today.

Shot to amazing effect in black and white this adaptation of Tennessee Williams' classic stage play is directed by the amazing Elia Kazan (""On The Waterfront"", ""Gentlemans Agreement""). These stellar combinations make this film essentially a classic and basically perfect.

You can't help but feel sorry for poor Blanche, sympathise with Stella, laugh at the escapades of Eunice and detest the evil soul that is Stanley.",1169510400,,1227,4.908212560386473

I must have watched Streetcar a dozen times, before I noticed Tennessee Williams' almost invisibly crafted moment of Blanche's triumph. Streetcar puzzled me for years, because I couldn't understand why  Williams would let the Stanley's of this world claim such a brutal victory. Then one day, I was watching for the millionth time and I saw IT! Stanley's defeat and Blanche's (and by extension the pregnant Stella's) salvation. An American Masterpiece.",1166745600,2,606,5.183673469387755
101201,5,0790729377,"Brutal Brando, I love Marlon Brando. but he was too mean in this movie. No heart or feelings for poor Blanche. Blanche was an outcast. The subject of her rejection was an indication of her being the way that she was. What Blanche did was by all means  wrong and it couldn't be excused. You could see the beauty in her despite her heavy burden. Blanche was too hard on herself. She was always wanting approval from others. Not knowing how graceful, refined, and beautiful she was. I agree she was a little frayed around the edges and she took refinement to another level. But still she showed signs of the proper up bringing and breeding. Blanche had fallen from grace.

The cast was outstanding. Wright King one of my favorite actors never quite made the grade in movies. Kim hunter made some progress on the screen. Kim's movie acting was limited to a certain degree. Perhaps these people were stage actors. Mitch who was to be Blache's savior was excellent as well. Karl Maulden was a fine actor.

They tell me John Garfield was up for the part of Stanley. I think Marlon Brando was the best choice. John Garfield could be rough. He had a tough guy attitude. But I don't believe he could be as brutal as Brando.

I could not handle the last part in the movie. It was hard to see Blanche reduced to what seemed like a fleeing animal. The way she ran and fell to the floor. The matron perhaps envious of this delicate women; wanted to put her in a straight jacket and have her nails cut. Poor Blache, but the doctor an older gentlemen understood Blanche's personality. He knew what would work for Blanche. She was a lady and well mannered at that. So he treated her like a lady. To see him tip his hat, take her arm  and escort her out to the waiting car was touching.

My favorite part in this movie was the first scene. The sight of the train making it's way to New Orleans. The cabs pulling up just in time to load pasengers. This reminded me of days gone by. Then out of the smokey steam came Blanche.

This is a very sensitive movie. A study of the lost and lonely with no where to turn.",1156982400,4,2092,4.321428571428571

One problem is that Blanche DuBois is simply too pretty for the role.  We don't understand, on a gut level, why this beautiful girl would worry about hiding behind dim lighting.  The script makes it clear that she is supposed to look ""old"", and yet she doesn't.  That's a fault of the film.  It makes her final passionate scene with Karl Malden incomprehensible.  He holds her up to the light, she looks very pretty, and yet we are supposed to believe that she looks terrible in bright light.  For that I blame the director, Elia Kazan.  What in God's name could he have been thinking of, and why did he mess up so badly on that important detail?

Another important fault of this film is that Stanley Kowalski's attack on Blanche isn't set up properly.  Are we just supposed to believe that he is an animal, and chalk it up to that?  Sorry, not good enough.  We should have seen it coming.  Again, another big mess-up by Kazan.  When the script has the characters doing something that doesn't ring true, there's a problem.  We needed to see that attack being led up to.  We needed to think ""Oh my god, I know what he is about to do.""

Stanley Kowalski is actually the good guy throughout most of the movie.  All of a sudden it turns.  It's incomprehensible.  Somewhere between the writing, directing, and acting, somebody dropped the ball somewhere.  The Stanley Kowalski who attacks Blanche is not the same man who appears earlier in the film.  He's not an ""animal"".  He's not set up that way for us. Blanche is the snob, and Stanley is okay, but that is turned on its head at the end.

Insanity is a nice little copout.  We can make our actors do anything, and just say okay, they went nuts.  Very touching, but not very realistic.  How does someone go insane?  What stages do they go through?  Blanche's descent into insanity, into an inability to tell reality from fantasy, should have been more realistic, more researched, more consistent with the way it actually happens.  It does happen to people, people who are extremely bipolar, people who are schizophrenic.  More research should have been done, to show what the descent into insanity actually does look like.

I have high standards, but that's a good thing, I think.  Still, I've given this film five stars.",1149897600,5,2534,4.5432372505543235

101224,5,0790729377,"Without putting the adaptation into historical context, (because I haven't researched the movie's history or the play itself), I have to say A Streetcar Named Desire is one of the most realistic and honest acted (by all involved) films around. Brando himself seems to disappear into the role of the down-to-earth Stanley. Stanley and Stella make the quintessential Orleanian couple, for their time, as they live foot-loose but deeply in love with each other, and they know each of the other is the only one for them. They quarrel now & again but the fights are usually either rooted in fun or serve as foreplay. Things change for them when Stella's hoity-toity sister Blanche shows herself and begins living with the couple. Stanley clearly doesn't enjoy Blanche's elitist attitude and how it's beginning to rub off on Stella; or maybe more precisely awaken Stella as she may have been before her time with Stanely. It would be interesting to know the time when Stanley and Stella met. I can imagine Stella being just as aggrivated if one of Stanley's relatives suddenly began staying in the apartment with no prospects and no plan to leave anytime soon, but in this case, Stanley is at his wits end when Blanche's story (of the past several years before showing up) doesn't check out and Stanley exposes Blanche's past. Let's just say it's a sorted past and whatever the road she traveled to get to the point where she hopped from hotel to motel, depending on the kindness of strangers , she's a bit used and a little lost in the mind to say the least. We do know some of her story about Stella leaving Blanche in a troubled situation at home as kids for New Orleans, but it comes off as patronizing Stella and more than a little selfish...the very thing Blanche believes of Stella! As a matter of fact, I can identify with Stella somewhat in that respect. Blanche meets a would-be gentleman and the entire situation blows up in many areas; with Stella & Stanley, Stella & Blanche, Stanley & Mitch, Blanche & Mitch...it's a regular royal rumble of sorts. Throw in some card playing buddies and a close-knit, cheeky neighborhood and 'Streetcar' stands as maybe the best adaptation from a play out there (with Glengarry Glen Ross way up there also).",1147392000,,2248,4.737244897959184
101225,5,0790729377,"*WARNING: May contain spoilers.*

A Streetcar Named Desire is a fascinating film for a lot of reasons. It's very difficult for me to compose my thoughts on this film, as there are just so many things happening on so many different levels.

I suppose I'll begin with the element that really makes the film what it is: the one and only Elia Kazan. For some reason these days, Kazan's films seem to get labeled as outdated and heavy-handed. I can understand why one might think that about Boomerang! or Gentleman's Agreement (though I think those are both very good films, especially the latter), but there is certainly nothing outdated or heavy-handed about A Streetcar Named Desire. It is one of the subtlest and most well crafted films I have ever seen.

The story concerns aging southern belle Blanche DuBois (Leigh), who moves to New Orleans to stay with her younger sister Stella (Hunter) and finds a culture clash at every corner, especially with Stella's ""unrefined"" husband Stanley, who is played by a very sexy Marlon Brando.

It is extraordinarily interesting to see the juxtaposition between Vivien Leigh and Marlon Brando. Leigh is an old-fashioned, classical actress of the highest order, charming the audience with her sunny disposition and perky smile, though she definitely has a dark side. Then we have Brando, a young, up-and-coming user of the rising art of method acting. It is one of the most interesting on-screen interactions one is likely to see.

What is also very interesting is watching Blanche's slow spiral into insanity. All of the elegance and wealth she grew up in is gone, and she has done unthinkable things to survive. Now she is stuck in a New Orleans slum with a sweaty simpleton yelling at her. Pair that with the tormenting suicide of a past lover, and you have a recipe for madness.

Being based on a Tennessee Williams play, the film takes place in essentially one location, that being Stella and Stanley's apartment, but Kazan utilizes the New Orleans locale to perfection, and the combination of his direction, the gorgeous, glowing black and white cinematography, and Alex North's sultry, jazzy score gives the film a consistently surreal, almost dreamlike atmosphere.

But more notably, the New Orleans atmosphere gives Kazan the perfect opportunity to play with the story's sensual aspects, and he occasionally even delves into pure primal sexuality, such as in the famous ""Stella!"" scene. The film is so subtly steamy and wrought with sexual tension that it pushed the boundaries of censorship back in its day. This also may be due to the fact that it alludes to some very controversial subjects. This is another point at which the film's subtlety becomes a marvel of cinematic engineering. Was Blanche's lover homosexual? Did Stanley rape Blanche? There are no solid answers to these questions - it is left for the viewer to decide.

But as I first mentioned, the real virtuoso behind this film is Elia Kazan. Some people may still be upset over his actions during the Red Scare, but it is undeniable that he made some extremely good films. A Streetcar Named Desire is one of his absolute finest masterpieces. It was very much ahead of its time, and it remains one of the most intense, subtle, and well-made dramas in the history of film.",1146700800,8,3284,4.893884892086331

They both know ""Death--the opposite is desire"" and the struggle to win is as riveting now as when the film was first shown.

But the audiences with whom I have seen this film have come to see the brutish Brando tear his T-sirt and cry Stella, but have all left discussing one of the greatest performances ever committed to film, that of the great Vivien Leigh.

She not only drifts out to madness is a sea of words, but she is alternately cruel and vulnerable as she does so. It is truly harrowing to watch this intelligent creature struggle so hard to find the salvation she seeks in this squalid New Orleans of the 50s.

Brando has claimed that Leigh was the perfect Blanche--and, as such-the film becomes about this tortured creature (whose very worst punisher is herself)perhaps more than the play ever was. The Pulitzer radio broadcast indicates that even the original Blanche (Jessica Tandy) was unable to make the Williams text as organic.

101230,5,0790729377,"Elia Kazan's marvelous adaptation of Tennessee Williams award winning play is enhanced with some truly impeccable acting performances.  Amazingly Marlon Brando who cemented his place in cinematic history with his portrayal of the brutish, volatile and sensual lout Stanley Kowalski was the only main player denied an Academy Award.  Vivien Leigh, Karl Malden and Kim Hunter all garnered Oscars for their roles.

Leigh playing neurotic and fading Southern belle Blanche Dubois arrives in New Orleans complete with her fragile disposition to stay with her nurturing sister Stella played by Kim Hunter in the seedy French Quarter of New Orleans.  Blanche hiding a sordid past had been run out of Laurel, Mississippi, fired from her teaching position for having an affair with a 17 year old boy.

Blanche received a warm reception from Stella but then Stanley enters the scene.  Brando's hackles are immediately raised when he learned than Blanche had mortgaged the family estate Belle Reve and frittered away the proceeds depriving Stella of her share.  Although Stella and Stanley had an often violent relationship they were deeply in love.  The inevitable clash between the coarse Stanley and the genteel Blanche drove a wedge into their relationship creating major histrionics.

Blanche desperately wanted to start her life anew and Stanley's buddy Mitch played by Karl Malden had potential to be her life preserver and possible husband.  Stanley however informed Mitch of Blanche's shady past and those plans became aborted.

The inevitable climax occurred when the pregnant Stella rushed to the hospital to deliver leaving Stanley and Blanche alone in their tiny apartment.  Stanley being Stanley successfully pushed Blanche over the edge with his actions, reducing her to a delusional shell of herself and needing to be institutionalized.

Kazan's choice of the sordid settings of the Kowalski's apartment certainly magnified the fall from grace suffered by the psychologically fragile Blanche.  The curious choice of the name of the apartment Elysian Fields, the mythical resting place for the blameless dead, provided foreshadowing for the drama that was to unfold.  The legendary acting performances chronicling a myriad of, at times, dysfunctional interpersonal relationships were an impressive sight to behold, richly deserving of all the accolades.",1128556800,,2357,5.472375690607735
101231,3,0790729377,"There are three reasons for watching ""A Streetcar Named Desire"": Brando. Brando. Brando.

Marlon Brando's bestial heat still flares off that black and white celluloid like the flashpots from the third row of a KISS concert. It is obvious why his work in this movie has been lauded, critiqued, dissected, imitated, codified and ultimately iconicized - it's absolutely astounding! To this day, few have captured that feral rawness and ""natural-ness"" that he exuded; an actor boldly pioneering a new style, a bravura ""Method"". The screen becomes all too two-dimensional when he is not onscreen.

On the other hand, Vivien Leigh's acting style, though lauded by film aficionados as a symbiotic, diametric marriage of intensity with Brando's, is just plain hard to watch and truthfully quite embarrassing at points.

For modern viewers, she cannot seem to ""convince"" with her old-school ""presentational"" style, clashing irreconcilably with Brando's ""method"".

The icy romance between Leigh and Karl Malden's character only serves to pound home the truth that sexual mores have moved too far from filmic 50s etiquette, to be in any way considered vital or even interesting to modern viewers, even though, for its day, much censorship was brought down upon ""Streetcar"". So we are left with an inordinate amount of yapping that Leigh inflicts on Malden; enough to make any man turn to drink, drugs, other women, other men, football, synchronized swimming or forsaking humanity and leaving for outer space like Chuck Heston in ""Planet Of The Apes"".

During Leigh's incessant rambles, strewn passim to illustrate her neuroticism, one continually wonders whether one is missing innuendo which was considered innuendo Back Then but which is now simply naivete, or whether there was any innuendo courted at all and it was as innocent and puling as it sounded. Ultimately, it is too taxing to pretend filmic sophistication and dissect character motivation - on a pure enjoyment level, Leigh delivers only to historians and Serious Critics.

Surely, 'The Play's The Thing' and the story is as vital now as it was then (that of the estranged sister - Leigh - with the profligate and promiscuous past attempting to excise her demons by immersing herself in a new life with her sister and brother-in-law - Kim Hunter and Brando), but the manner in which this tale is purveyed has dated, the only vital remaining aspect being Brando.

Williams is a genius in psychology and how human systems create insanity in  all the nuances of the collision between the gross and the fine, the male and female elements, gentile and vulgar, the delicate and the course, the inward and outward.  What female or sensitive male has not experienced this collision and been unable to explain it? But human systems create and maintain insanity and this video shows it the best. Stanley overheard Blanch downputting him to his wife Stella as ""common and vulgar, like an ape"" and he became vindictive, aiming to be rid of her.  This story unfolds around that plot and her grips on reality dissolve accordingly.  Initially hypersensitive and convalescing from a young marriage ending in suicide, Blanch is again confronted with sorrow in adapting to her brother-in-law and her zvengalized sister.  As Stanley becomes more ruthless, she seeks protection more from ""Mitch"" his buddy.  Then Stanley finds out that in her town of ""Oriel"" she was a prostitute.  Female psychology shows that early female promiscuity is often just a seeking of protection from the male element, and an inability to ""just say no"" is from fear of reprisal and lost protection.  But society doesn't see it that way and she escaped Oriel to her sister's domicile.  She wants Mitch for the same reason ""just to finally relax--I am so tired of fearing."" Such women go from man to man for protection, and since it doesn't work regress more with time and as they are labeled whorish their sink into insanity is next. She was thrown out of the first town because of her affair with a 17-yr old boy, duplicated in a scene with the newspaper boy who was superbly kind, gentlemanly, respectful and gentle (in direct contrast to Stanley) and so here again, she kisses him as a link to gentile reality, and confirmation as a lady. The most ruthless and cruel contradiction is when Stanley rapes Blanche and soon after commits her to a mental hospital.  The ""kind doctor"" arrives and takes her away on his arm, and she seems in love, ""always dependent on the kindness of strangers.""  The viewer is left to wonder what happens next--does she link to the kind elderly father doctor, and does Stella really reject Stanley for good, transfering her love to her baby?",1126137600,4,2366,4.76039119804401
101253,5,0790729377,"There are so many superlatives in this movie, it is difficult where to begin. This was one of the first Tennesse William's plays to be cast to screen and was an instant success. Marlon Brando was born in Nebraska, the state that brought Montmogory Clift. At 23, he brought Stanley Kowalsky to screen and transformed it. He was educated at Libertyville High School in Illinois and then sent to Shattuck Military Academy. There he was expelled for indiscipline - that had been his plan. He went to the dramatic workshop of the New School for Social Research in New York in 1943, and studied with Stella Adler, yet he never filled the role of a determined, dedicated actor. On the contrary he boasted of the chanciness of his career, his laziness, and a deep indifference to acting as art or vocation. But he got parts in I Remember Mama (1944), and Truckline Cafe and Candida in 1946. He was amazingly beautiful - there is no other way of saying it, or denying its vital thrust in what happened. He had huge eyes, a wide, deep brow, an angel's mouth, with the upper lip crested. And he could speak, softly, like breathing, so the mouth scarcely moved. But he was as male as a wild animal, hunky, husky, sensual, and incoherent or rhapsodic, depending on which style worked best with the young woman of the moment. Irene Selznick, the producer of A Streetcar Named Desire, had thought of John Garfield or even Burt Lancaster for Stanley. But she had seen Brando in Ben Hecht's A Flag Is Born in 1946 and had been ""galvanised by his power... however risky, he was bound to be interesting."" Elia Kazan, the director, wanted Brando because he knew the actor's radiance would keep Stanley from being just a villain, the trampler upon Blanche Dubois's fragile bloom.

It was left to the playwright, Tennessee Williams, to decide. Brando went to see Williams, who was living on Cape Cod. When he got there, both the electricity and the plumbing were out. The actor repaired them both, and then did a reading, with Tennessee taking the other parts. It was 10 minutes before they called Kazan and Ms Selznick and told them yes. Williams wrote to his agent, Audrey Wood: ""It had not occurred to me before what an excellent value would come through casting a very young actor in the part. It humanises the character of Stanley in that it becomes the brutality or callousness of youth rather than a vicious older man. I don't want to focus guilt or blame particularly on any one character but to have it a tragedy of misunderstanding and insensitivity to others. A new value came out of Brando's reading which was by far the best reading I have ever heard. He seemed to have already created a dimensional character, of the sort that the war has produced among young veterans.""

There was a latent sense in which Blanche was a male surrogate, the spirit of refinement and gentility, confronted by a far more brutal and modern male force. Kazan was a director of the new breed that needed to find himself in the work. So he identified with Brando's Stanley and a crude upstart vitality reducing the pretentious lady to his own level. The play surpassed its text in production, and in some profound way 1947 was ready for every fantasy that was appealed to.

As Kazan saw it, Brando had changed the play - audiences like Stanley more or as much as Blanche (it was only later that Streetcar became a play about Blanche). A kind of rutting force was let loose, a feeling of native American force. Brando was seen on stage half-naked (he had a flawless torso then), discarding a sweaty T-shirt, alive, urgent, unruly and golden. People of both sexes fell for him at the same moment as a classical male persona had been explored or layered, and only Brando could have held the human beast and the brooding angel in balance. It began to be possible for the American hero to be beautiful and not just handsome.

There are so many sections about the movie that show the brute force and mean side of him compared to Blanche. Every time he is tampered with by his wife or Blanche, the way he retaliates is ruthless. Though it may not be as realistic in the present day world with women having more power, even women appreciated him and his acting style. The younger generation may not understand the movie, which is sad, as it is not about political correctness but the reality of those times and how petty people can be. Though that form of racism does not exist anymore, calling people ""Polacks"", it hurt people a lot. It was the introduction of Brando to the screen with a bang. He was one of the few, who despite quite a few failures could stick on and reinvent himself in different roles later in life. As Jack Nicholson said, ""Now that he is gone, we can all aspire to go up one step in the acting ladder."" It was unfortunate that he did not get his oscar for his role in this movie and it went to Humphrey Bogart in the African Queen. That movie comes nowhere close to this in class and is close to being forgotten. Though Brando won two richly deserved oscars, this movie was one of his crowning achievements.

There are so many dialogs in this movie that have been repeated in other movies that it speaks for itself as something that trascends time. Though the transfer is not great, this is one of the great american classics and should be cherished. Kudos to all the actors, director Elia Kazan, Tennessee Williams for the screenplay and the overall production. I hope that they release a 2 disc version of this classic.",1122422400,6,5505,4.567813765182186
101254,2,0790729377,I won't go into how amazing this movie is. We all know that. What gets me is how little respect Warner Bros. pays to the classic films that built their studios. Here you have one of the best films of all time and they release it on a DVD with virtually no extras and a VERY sub-par transfer. From the moment the Warner Bros. logo pops up you can see how unstable the image is...not to mention a large amount of dirt and debris running through every scene. The sound quality isn't much better (I actually had to turn the subtitles on for some of the pivotal scenes).Isn't this film worthy of a restoration? I've run across this same problem a lot with this company's releases. I guess they know that people will buy these wonderful movies based on the reviews of the movies themselves and don't feel any need to fork out cash to ensure the quality of their products.,1109980800,145,865,4.37888198757764
101255,5,0790729377,"""I've always depended on the kindness of strangers,"" is a very difficult line to read convincingly. Recent years have brought us a plethora of *Blanches DuBois*. Just ask Jessica Lange or Ann-Margaret how hard that line is to read - neither of them came close to convincing us of it. But Vivien Leigh - the ethereally lovely and vastly skilled actress who brought us the immortal Scarlett O'Hara - utters the line in such a way that makes the heart ache. Leigh, who won Best Actress for her performance, plays the seminal Blanche. She is flighty, unstable and riddled with neuroses, and the very apex of Tennessee Williams' dysfunctional but immense creativity. Her character is strongly contrasted by that of Marlon Brando's crude, Neanderthal-like Stanley Kowalski, and both of them, perhaps because of their personal parallels to their characters, excel at these playing parts. This re-release restored several minutes of sexual tension to the film that had been hacked out by the censors, notably filling out Kim Hunter's Oscar-winning role as Blanche's beloved sister, Stella.

I have seen this movie many times and never tire of it. Although Brando would make other fine movies, he would never make one better. Vivien Leigh is also amazing as the fragile Blanche who is sinking into madness. Even with the stagey set, which looks like a set, the characters explode on the screen.

It seems to me that you do not compare Brando's performance and this movie to other films but rather to other great American artistic works: Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue"", Toni Morrison's BELOVED, ANGELS IN AMERICA, for example. A truly great movie.",1094515200,4,706,4.786885245901639
101259,5,0790729377,"Ok, the acting doesn't get any better...undisputed fact. I find the BIOPOLAR Stanley hilarious, along with everything else people have said for over half a century.  Brando even said in his autobio that Jessica Tandy would get mad at him during the play because audiences would laugh at him as he tormented her, diminishing her character, and she blamed him. Guess she had to blame somebody.

But Marlon Brando, in all his genius, depth, brilliance, talent, etc, etc, etc, just plain cracks me up, in his movies and to confirm his sense of humor, in his autobio.  I was laughing so hard I couldn't even read the part in his autobio when he was talking about his visit on the set of ""The Godfather"" from a cocked eyed mob boss.

He said, ""The first thing I noticed about him was that one of his eyes looked to the left and the other to the right.  I didn't know which one to look at, so, trying not to offend him, I alternated between them.""  This simply cracked me completely up.  But when he quoted the mob boss during a tour of the set as saying, ""I don't know how you keep from goin' nuts Marlo, with all these people and all these wires and everything,"" Brando wrote, ""I agree, the whole thing is really cockeyed, isn't it?""  Then I looked into his cocked eyes and realized what I'd said.  I spun around, trying to divert his attention to something on the set and to get a glimpse of his reaction peripherally.  For a moment he blinked and I thought I saw a hurt look flash across his face, but the moment passed, and I babbled a mouthful of mush to fill the air with words, not knowing what in the world I was saying.""  I am still trying to imagine a big bad cocked eyed gangster with a hurt look on his face due to ""Marlo's"" slip of the tongue.

This was the funniest part of his autobio to me, although the man cracked me up through the entire reading as he does in his movies, serious or not, he makes me smile.  He just has an amazing effect on me and I think it's deeper than just his unparalleled acting ability because I'm not all that impressed with actors.  I'm gonna keep searching until I find out what it really and truly is about him that, as he says in his autobio about him almost getting strangled to death at the premier of Guys and Dolls, ""turns crowds into mobs"".

I know his courage has a lot to do with it and my attraction to strength and courage is an obvious connection, but I still think there is more and I'm gonna keep digging.  His movies are revealing (he spilled his guts in Last Tango In Paris while playing the harmonica), as well as in his autobio, but there was more to this man than we will probably ever know, more than he probably ran out of time to find out. Head's up for us to forever examine our own lives because there is obviously more to us than meets the eye, as Eva Marie Saint said when Brando asked her in On The Waterfront, 'what more do you want?'...much more, much, much more!",1094256000,5,2932,4.265342960288809
101260,5,0790729377,"For its high-powered acting more than anything else, Elia Kazan's screen adaptation of Tennessee Williams' stage classic A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE has lived on in movie history. Though Marlon Brando, as Stanley Kowalski, didn't win an Academy Award for his breakthrough performance here, once again history tells a different story from what those old-fashioned geezers at AMPAS imply by their awards, and Brando's performance here has become something of a screen legend (as has the recently-deceased actor himself).

Brando is remarkable, to be sure. He goes down to pre-human levels and dredges up a performance that is terrifying as an unsparing portrait of male dominance and machismo. It certainly set a standard for screen acting (Robert De Niro, in his early years, did a similar kind of acting, to equally electrifying effect). But, for me, Vivien Leigh---who won a well-deserved Oscar for her performance here---really makes this movie as the protagonist of the film, Blanche DuBois. This character is one of the most fascinating and complex characters ever conceived for both stage and screen. How to describe or even interpret her? She is certainly the stark antithesis of the animalistic Stanley, being refined and proper (and a little pretentious) where Stanley is brutish and sloppy. She has had a difficult life in the past, especially regarding romance, and yet she retains her romantic ideals, seeking a tough yet kind man who will whisk her away from her troubles. She is, above all, a magnificently conceived and immensely compelling character, and Vivien Leigh---best known as Scarlett O'Hara in GONE WITH THE WIND---brings all of her complexities and contradictions to seemingly effortless life. It's a truly great performance (Pauline Kael considered it one of the greatest filmed performances ever), and her tension-filled scenes with Brando are the high points of the film. Kim Hunter is no less impressive as Blanche's caring sister Stella, and Karl Malden matches up convincingly with Viven Leigh in their scenes together. (Both won Oscars too, in supporting performance categories.)

Elia Kazan and screenwriter Williams (adapted for the screen by Oscar Saul) haven't quite been able to shed the staginess that often mars many a screen adaptation of a stage work, but that hardly seems to work against this particular film. Besides, who will complain when a screen adaptation is so engrossing and has such classic performances? Blanche's final line will haunt you just as it must have haunted many a theatergoer when the play premiered onstage. A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, to this day, remains a powerful study of shattered dreams and unspoken romantic and sexual desires, as well as a master class in great screen acting. Highly recommended.",1092873600,8,2766,5.26984126984127

This is Blanche's last resort for help as she has faced numerous hardships such as loosing her parents, her job as a teacher, and an undisclosed secret.  These difficulties have left deep scares in Blanche's psyche and left her in a fragile state with neurosis and delusions.

101294,5,0790729377,"Whether or not you like Elia Kazan as a person--think he's a ..., what have you--his talent for direction is undeniable. And he shows this in the film adaptation of A Streetcar Named Desire. With the same aspect as such films as Wuthering Heights is, it's uncoth, it's dark, it's moody, it's creepy. But with reason. Some things just look better in black + white. To think of this in colour is unspeakable, even. This, along with On the Waterfront, rank as Kazan's best work. Both with Marlon Brando.
But dare I speak my mind? As much as I agree Brando is a very talented actour, and that his performance as Stanley Kowalski is excellent, a certain word comes to my mind...overrated? Now, perhaps it's because I prefer more of the traditional acting technique myself over method. Although you're not, in essense, ""in character"", it takes a real talent to pull it off. And in a nest of respected, seasoned methods, the one traditional gives, by far, the most outstanding performance. Vivien Leigh as Blanche DuBois is, not only the greatest acting in her career, but quite possibly by any female in the history of cinema. As stated before, she's purely technique. But the eery circumstances surrounding her life at this moment made her Blanche, and not with purpose. Although in a shallow perspective, Blanche is an overdramatic nympho whom many want to slap, I won't let it stop at that. Tennessee Williams remarked on how her Blanche was everything he had intended to bring to the role, and more. This I agree. Having read the play beforehand, and realizing that it would undoubtedly difficult to bring to life, I was persuaded by the 'closing credits' that Viv is one of the greatest actresses in cinematic history, at least to my knowledge. And because of that, she ranks as my most favourite. Above Katharine Hepburn, above Greta Garbo, above Joan Crawford. She can't be surpassed. And perhaps it's becuase I too, oddly enough can sympathize with the character. Sure, I'm not an aging, tormented nyphomaniac-of-a-southern belle, some of it is all to eery. Nothing is greater than the line ""I've always depended on the kindness of strangers"". Damn..in a twisted way, it's the hero of the epic tale--one who can surpass all time and place with what they represent. Can't be better.
Karl Malden also gives a great performance as Mitch. Having liked him as an actour [and Mitch as a character], I was satisfied with what I watched. I didn't care much for Kim Hunter, although she's not neccesarily bad. The art direction is everything that it should be, and it's Alex North's finest hour. Should've won best picture.

I see now that my initial reaction to the film speaks to the depth and brilliance of Ms. Leigh's performance. ""Streetcar"" has become my favorite movie. The acting is superb. I was blown away by Ms. Leigh's performance and can't imagine another actress in that role. The fact that ""Streetcar"", set in the 1940s, filmed in black and white, having little or no set changes can keep viewers glued to their screen is a true testament to the actors, Mr. Kazan, and of course, the great Williams.

101298,5,0790729377,"For various reasons, I have never liked either the play or the film on which it is based but remain fascinated with the human experiences which Tennessee Williams examines. The character of Stanley Kowalski (Marlon Brando) dominates the narrative but his wife Stella (Kim Hunter) really is the stronger person. Pregnant, she is visited by her sister Blanche Dubois (Vivien Leigh) who arrives with enough emotional baggage to keep a regiment of psychotherapists busy. She and Stanley have an immediate and ambivalant chemical reaction to each other. To her, he is a lower animal, unworthy of her sister; to him, she is a posturing, pretentious bitch. Under the brilliant direction of Elia Kazan, Leigh's performance suggests how fragile, vulnerable, and desperate Blanche really is. As for Stanley, to invoke a weary aphorism, what we see is what we get...except that he seems vulnerable without his wife's love and support. Both on stage and in the film, there is no doubt of the powerful sexual attraction between Stella and Stanley. Williams invests the character of Blanche with ephemeral qualities. In some respects, she is an elderly Scarlett O'Hara who reluctantly endures her sister's boorish husband because she has nowhere else to go. Her personal ""streetcar"" has reached the end of the line.
The acting is consistently outstanding. Of course, we know early on that there will be a major confrontation between Blanche and Stanley. Oscar Saul collaborated with Williams on the screenplay which carefully prepares us for it. When it finally occurs, we feel sympathy (if not pity) for Blanche and her relocation to a new home in which, perhaps, she will receive the kindness she so obviously craves. There is great emotional power in this film. Also, I think, sadness with regard to the resolution of Blanche's association with the Kowalskis. With all due respect to Leigh (who received an Academy Award for her performance, as did Hunter and Karl Malden for theirs), I would have preferred Jessica Tandy whom I was privileged to see in the Broadway production. Tandy captured -- in ways and to an extent which Leigh does not -- certain nuances of Blanche's illusions and delusions which are indelibly poignant.",1059696000,7,2217,5.093406593406593
101299,5,0790729377,"The fim version of the play is absolutely outstanding. It completely and fullheartedly deserves the Awards it got, and by far. Marlon Brandon is fascinating as an animal of violence and desire, and Vivien Leigh is an astonishing embodiment of a fallen southern belle who tries to escape her lost past and cannot, turning her obsession about her past of failure into an absolute neurotic inability to accept change in the world. The use of music is quite convincing to signal the shifts from the present experience to the recollections of the past mistakes and guilt.

The violence and the sensuality of the present are always striking and powerful. It is moving and cruel, emotional and mind-raking, sensual and frightening. Desire, the desire to be in complete osmosis with another human being, is beautifully depicted and enacted by the dialogue, the acting and the physical rendering of the feelings, the fears, the hopes, the deceptions of the characters. But the ending is changed and the meaning of the film is different from that of the book.

From the triumph of sensual and sexual desire, from the necessary destruction and institutionalization of Blanche in order for life and its desires to survive and live on, like a show that has to go on, we shift to an opening in Stella that could lead to more independance and autonomy for her, for women. But this opening is ambiguous since it can only come from a distanciation from desire in the objective realization of it, that is to say the baby.

When the baby is born, when desire has produced its fruit, women can move on to a higher level and men can be pushed back into a more refrained and cultured attitude. Can they? Maybe. At least they may, in a long process that is foretold in this ending, at the end of this film. We can wonder whether it is a way to satisfy the demands of Hollywood for a film that can reach the wide public (and the three odd minutes that were cut off in 1951 go that way), or it is a sign in Tennessee Williams and Elia Kazan that new social evolutions were entering the wider social picture.

That we cannot know for sure. But this film shows how a ten or twenty second change at the end can change the meaning of the play and can open completely different vistas in our consciousness.

101331,5,0790729377,"Tennessee Williams's play of sultry passion set in the French Quarter of New Orleans is a masterpiece flawlessly rendered by the magnificent cast in this classic Elia Kazan directed film.  I first laid my eyes on this wonderful work of art over a decade ago, while in my mid-twenties.  The stark human drama that unfolded before me on the screen literally had me enthralled.  I could not find sufficient words to say enough about it then, nor can I even now, I fear.  Yet as it is in my ultra-indulgent nature to do, I shall, amidst all this rambling, try to do this film fair justice -
This is the harsh and burning tale of an emotionally fragile woman, Blanche DuBois (Vivien Leigh) who goes to find shelter under her younger sister Stella Kowalski's (Kim Hunter) roof in New Orleans after losing their inherited southern plantation estate.  Marlon Brando is Stella's rough, sexually volatile husband Stanley. Driving this fervent tale is the war of wills that is waged between Leigh's fading Southern Belle and Brando's blue collar brute.
After having recently viewed this movie after so many years away from it, I was much struck by the distinct transformation that my own reaction to this story had undergone over the years - as if living in the world a decade longer had completely altered my perspective.  Watching this in my twenties, I saw a madly impassioned play depicting unheeded fervor and unrequited yearnings - a fierce romance.  It had been impossible to take my eyes off Brando, his presence on the screen and the power of his performance were so palpable.  I even found some of his cruel outbursts, his pointed darts aimed with such cold precision, amusing.  I saw Blanche's off-hand remarks, likening Stanley to animal or bluntly telling her sister that he's ""common,"" more as unfair and underhanded attacks rather than what they actually were:  desperately wrought defenses against a heartless, malevolent force.  It's far more heart wrenching to view this movie now - it disturbs me to the quick, and on some deep intangible level.  Perhaps at 25, I was not yet mature enough to fully appreciate or understand the meaning of this brilliantly insightful play.  Indeed, my viewpoint of the movie is no longer so one-dimensional.
This film, when viewed as a whole, encompasses a great many ideals - the acting for one, not only by Brando, but by the entire cast - is shear mastery.  Forget her stints as Scarlett O'Hara or Anna Karenina; Vivien Leigh's Blanche DuBois is bar none the performance of her life!  Her haunting portrayal of the deeply disturbed starlet hiding behind her thin veiled illusions and lyrical genteelness is brilliant.  The sexual tension between Blanche and Stanley is riveting to witness - to this day, there's never been an actor anything like Marlon Brando.  With mumbled speech and brutish force, his innate mode of sexual energy is unequaled. He belts out a flawless performance here, and it passes me why it did not earn him an Oscar.  Kim Hunter as the down-to-earth sister and Karl Malden as Blanche's momma's-boy suitor each won well-deserved Oscars for their respective supporting roles.
I can now with equanimity say that I see this amazing play for what it is:  a revelation of life's dark truths.  ""Death...the opposite is Desire,"" says Blanche as she throws up for the taking the last shreds of her sanity.  She had come that way on a Streetcar Named Desire via another called Cemetery. True that human beings from the birth of desire, en route to the grave, grasp in vain for the beauty and innocence of their youth.  True that the meek of this earth are easy prey to the ruthlessly cruel.  True that illusion and romance are deft sanctuaries from the harshness of reality. Tennessee Williams hauntingly captures these truths in this wonderful, atmospherically alluring play.",1048032000,23,3834,4.882716049382716

Although the restored footage fills in many details that were left out of the original release, and is truer to the original Tennessee Williams play, I couldn't help but feel disapointed and cheated that I could not watch the original full screen version.

101334,5,0790729377,"In ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski gives what is clearly the best acting performance not to win an Academy Award (he lost to Humphrey Bogart in ""The African Queen"").  Vivien Leigh as Blanche DuBois, Kim Hunter as Stella Kowalski, and Karl Malden as Mitch all won in their respective acting categories.  Years later, with ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" this same thing happened, with both of the ladies winning that time around.
Tennessee Williams' play is one of the major works in American drama, especially after the Second World War, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for drama in 1947 (with Jessica Tandy as Blanche the only cast change from the film; although I should point out Leigh opened the play in England on stage).  Although Brando's performance is riveting, representing the new ""modern"" method of acting at its best, the play is really about the mental and moral disintegration of Blanche, a neurotic former Southern belle whose genteel illusions are no match for the brutish realities of her brother-in-law, Stanley.  The fact that Hollywood changed the ending to reflect conventional morality remains one of the great sins in movie history, but I have always thought the fact Brando's legendary stage performance was essentially preserved on film offsets that in the final judgment.  Leigh's performance is often seen as an extension of the Scarlett O'Hara role that made her famous, but of course now we know her personal life was as tortured as the character she was playing.
I heard an argument once that ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" was, at least on some level, a reponsible by Tennessee Williams to Eugene O'Neill's play ""The Iceman Cometh"" (then again, I have heard the same argument made, more forcefully to be sure, regarding Edward Albee's ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"").  O'Neill's classic play deals with the human need for illusion and hope as necessary weapons against despair.  If you are teaching American drama in the 20th century, then using these plays in any combination you might like could be quite provocative for your students.
Personal aside: I was in New Orleans once and actually saw the bus named ""Desire,"" which had replaced the city streetcars.  There was certainly an odd little moment.
Most significant line:  It does not seem right to talk about romantic lines with any of these characters, but there is a line that is one of the greatest character epitaphs ever.  Of course, this is at the end where Blanches says to the doctor, ""Whoever you are, I have always depended upon the kindness of strangers.""  I have usually found that at some point in a play there is a line that defines the character so well it could serve as their epitaph.  This line is as clear an example of what I am talking about as you could ever hope to find.
If you like ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" then check out these other films on the AFI's list of 100 Greatest Love Stories: #48 ""Last Tango in Paris"" and #89 ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?""

It completly changes the tone and subject of the movie!  Let me tell you something: this play was supposed to be about Blanche's tragedy.  Changing the ending takes that element away.  You can no longer call it a tragedy, and all of the sudden now the movie is about Stella.
Coming from someone who absolutely LOVED reading the play, I think this new ending is a complete cop out.  Well, it is.  I know it was forced on the studio from people who didn't think the original ending was ""appropriate.""
My advice: read the play.  It's better.  Actually, the movie is also really good as well....except when it gets to the ending.
All in all, I was really disappointed with how it ended.  Should've stuck to the original ending that was in the play.  I would've given it 5 stars had it not been for the ridiculous ""forced"" ending.

101336,5,0790729377,"I think this is my favorite film, so I have to add my impressions, even tho everything that could be said about it has already been said. A wonderful film, filled with incredible performances. Vivien Leighs ""Blanche"" is as fragile as that glass in Tennesse's Menagerie. She won the best actress Oscar for her interpretation of Tennessee Williams alter-ego, Blanche DuBois, the Southern belle on her last stop. She takes the role that Jessica Tandy famously originated in the stage production, and makes it her own. Her performance would have been enough to make this movie a milestone, but the fact there's two groundbreaking performances in it only adds to it's power and legend. Marlon Brandos ""Stanley Kowalski"", which he originated on stage, was a revelation, then and now. A new kind of acting was brought to the general public. Cast with top New York ""method"" actors,(Kim Hunter & Karl Malden received best-supporting actor Oscars)it was a once in a lifetime production. That Brando did not receive the award, (I believe Humphrey Bogart won that year, for ""The African Queen""), does not take away the lasting effect Brandos role had on cinema. It has been said that Tennessee Williams found much humor in Blanche, his most famous creation, and, often during the stage performances, would cackle maniacally at her (his) remarks, and her final line... one of the most famous lines in entertainment history, ""I have always depended on the kindness of strangers"", always struck him as incredibly funny, to the annoyance of many.(He wrote her, I guess he's entitled.) Maybe his own proximity to madness was a little too close to Blanche's. All said, from the moment she enters the movie, emerging from the steam of the dark New Orleans train station, to her final, lost exit, it is the beautiful and tragic Vivien Leighs Blanche who pervades this film. She and Tennessee were just too gentle for this world.",1023235200,19,1908,4.947040498442368
101337,5,0790729377,"This 1951 award-winning film was directed by Elia Kazan and based on a play by Tennessee Williams.  Set in New Orleans shortly after WWII, it starred Marlon Brando, then just 27 years old, in the performance that set his career in motion.  Cast as Stanley Kowalski, the rough loudmouthed husband of Stella, played by Kim Hunter, he struts around in a torn tee shirt, his body all muscle and sweat, and there's a raw animal magnetism to his performance.  When Stella's sister, the tragic fading beauty Blanche Dubois, played by Vivian Leigh, suddenly comes to live with them, the tension mounts.
Filmed in black and white, most of the action takes place in a cramped two-room apartment, and in the street directly outside.  The dialogue leads the viewer to understand the characters on an ever-deepening level, and the facial expressions and physical actions heightened the emotional realism. Brando smashed dishes and threw a radio out a window and often acted like a caged animal.  The screen sizzled with raw passion during the romantic scenes between him and Hunter, where he reveals just enough tenderness to give him added appeal.  I understand that a few minutes of footage in the scenes between them were added to the video, which had previously been censored out, and I could see the difference this made. All the casting was excellent, and Karl Malden, in a supporting role as Brando's buddy who courts Blanche was great.  I couldn't help thinking about Vivian Leigh in ""Gone With The Wind"", which had been made a dozen years before, and felt the role of Blanche was just perfect for her. In ""Streetcar"" she's actually 38 years old with lines beginning around her eyes and slightly loosened skin.
Even though some of the dialog was a bit mumbled, and some of the scenes just a little more talky than they would be today, I loved the fact that the action came from the internal conflicts and acting abilities of the characters, and didn't need any modern special effects to add to the realism.  ""Streetcar"" is a small work of art and has certainly stood the test of time.  Highly recommended.",1020038400,5,2100,4.795013850415512
101338,5,0790729377,"I cannot express how happy I was when I discovered this cinematic slice of tenessee flavoured pie. Streetcar is my bestest play and I was like a pig in muck when I found that Elia Kazan had directed it, then like a pig in a sewage works when I found that Brando and Leigh were portraying my most loved characters and then when I finally watched it and loved it the pig had died and left behind precious bacon for all.
Never has so much inspired and inspiring acting been placed together, expert casting creates streetcars characters closer to the text than i ever could have hoped. Brando is pure masculinity, but manages to show that persicuted little bunny hiding below as only he knows how. Our Viv manages to make Blanche as mad as trimmed pig while still creating the utmost sympathy from the audience, the rest of the cast are also jolly fine and not pig like at all.
The set is just magic, it looks just like a house occupied by our local witch, dingy, dirty and foul beyond belief but with that hint of something that makes you think someone has tried to make the best of a bad job, just how it should look. Kazan makes the New Orleans setting perfectly dank whilst retaining that exciting naughiness, the sounds that resonate continually throughout are expertly placed and really give great atmosphere and are like a symbiot to the poetic dialogue. And oh mother that dialogue, poetry thy name is Tennessee Williams, never have I left a film spouting so many of the lines, i assure you i was 'hey stella'ring for days after, and await the day i am given the oppertunity to express ' i have always depended on the kindness of strangers ', that day will come if i have to succumb to madness to achieve it.
Do you get the feeling i like this film, my only problem is with the DVD thingy, its not a superb picture considering other Kazan and Brando classics have had good restorations, and the sound isn't put to effect ( I could think of several places where a good remix could have added tp the experience, blanches funny turns to name a few ) extras could fill a baby pigs stomach. But we have to remember this is from Warner bros and they aren't renound for quality DVDs ( although they did a stonking job on rebel without a cause, so why not this)

What an extraordinarily thrill, therefore, to report that ""Streetcar"" not only holds up but frequently delivers those thunderbolts of excitement that one can only describe as truly great cinematic moments.  Not only the acting of Brando, Leigh, Malden and Hunter but the choices of director Kazan as to camera angles and lighting as well as his vivid use of the wonderful jazz score of Alex North make this a must-own for DVD afficianados.
That being said, I can only rate the DVD itself four stars.  It can't be helped.  ""Streetcar"" is in need of the restoration process used so successfully in recent years with such marvels as ""Rear Window."" That, and the lack of any bonus features detailing the importance of this film as a major player in the 1950's assault on Hollywood's Production Code, make the DVD, but not the film, fall short of greatness.

This word applies to the performances of Marlon Brando, Vivien Leigh, and all the actors who participated in this film.  It's dominance in the acting categories at the Oscars is testimony to this fact.  Each actor portrays a character so feasilbe, and so real, it's difficult not to get wrapped up in the film.  Reguardless of gender, you can relate and really feel for each character.  A Streetcar Named Desire is probably the first REAL movie, with realisic characters to come out of Hollywood at the time.

Leigh's Scarlett was so courageous, fearless and gutsy. In Blanche, it's like watching Melanie without her steely backbone and elegant courage. Several Leigh biographers describe how Leigh casually underwent shock treatments throughout the filming of ""Streetcar,"" because her emotional state had deteriorated to an alarming degree. In a somewhat sadistic touch, Director Elia Kazan had the identical male actor who portrayed Melanie's son in ""Gone With the Wind"" (you can see him briefly in the playroom scene where Rhett puts Bonnie Butler in his lap and tells her they're going to London)play the military man who helps Vivien from the Streetcar at the very beginning.

101409,5,0790729377,"""A Streetcar Named Desire"" (1951) is one of the few masterpieces of American cinema - a true work of art.  The story unfolds in New Orleans where former teacher of english, Blanche DuBois (Vivien Leigh) comes to live with her sister, Stella (Kim Hunter) and brother-in-law, Stanley Kowalski (Marlon Brando) in their small, run down apartment in a poor section of town.  When Blanche and Stanley meet for the first time, the sparks begin to fly almost immediately, setting the tone for the entire film.  Blanche's intentions to leave behind her unsavory past and begin anew (having been run out of her town of Oriole) are at odds with her brother-in-law's determination (intensified by his suspicion that Blanche has duped Stella out of an inheritance) to expose her social airs and genteel manner as a cover for a life of depravity and immorality.  The conflict between the two characters builds to a shocking and pathos-filled climax resulting in the disintegration of the last fragile thread of Blanche's sanity.  The film's star, Vivien Leigh, gives the greatest screen performance of her life, moving the viewer to feel her character's despair and regret, particularly when confessing to her newly acquired beau, Mitch (Karl Malden), one of Stanley's buddies, the reason behind her husband's suicide when they were both teenagers.  Marlon Brando is unforgettable as brutish, antagonistic, slur-speeched Stanley.  His presentation of beer & sweat stained, animal-like masculinity is quite sensational even today, 50 years later.  Kim Hunter is equally as brilliant in her role of expectant mother, Stella Kowalski.  Her valiant attempts to keep peace between her husband and sister prove futile and eventually she, too, is dragged down into a quagmire of disillusion and resentment.  The film contains several messages, but perhaps the most striking sentiment is that a careless, unkind word spoken can cause irreparable damage and lead to tragic consequences, ruining many lives in the process.

Vivian Leigh's portrayal of Tennessee Williams's languished  southern rose is one of the most memorable and haunting performances of the  American cinema.  Seldom in the history of film has there been such  excellent casting.  Leigh of course won the Academy Award for best actress,  but she was not alone.  Karl Malden won for best supporting actor and Kim  Hunter for best supporting actress.  Marlon Brando could easily have won  for his raw animal portrayal of Stanley Kowalski.  Credit should also go to  Elia Kazan for the artful mastery of his direction.  In short this is one  of the most celebrated movies of all time, a classic, period.  But no  mistake should be made about where the primary power comes from.  It's from  Tennessee Williams's Pulitizer Prize winning play, a work of theatrical  genius second to none in the history of the American theater.  Williams had  the gift of understanding and the ability to project the melancholy  self-delusion and sexual/social angst of the feminine psyche onto the  stage, and to do it with objectivity and compassion.  (Cf. Laura in The  Glass Menagerie and Maggie in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.)

Brando's  interpretation of the animalistic Kowalski, typified by his screaming up  the stairs, ""Stella!"" in tight t-shirt and bellowing voice, and his crude  way with women, electrified audiences and established him as a star.  A  string of cinematic successes followed, highlighted by his work in On the  Waterfront (1954) for which he won an academy award.

I want to add that  we are driven by Desire until this silly dance concludes and we arrive at  the Cemetery.  In a beautifully observed bit of accidental irony, those  names-""Desire"" and ""Cemetery""-are the names of streetcars that ran back and  forth on the same line in New Orleans, giving inspiration to Williams's apt  and unforgettable title.",963273600,15,2235,4.943089430894309

TENNESSEE WILLIAMS is the greatest playwright of all time, capturing in a few well-chosen words the whole plight of the human  condition...Vivien Leigh is almost TOO REAL as the fragile, traumatized,  fading beauty caught in a trap of merciless reality and unfulfilled  dreams...Marlon Brando is SUPERB as the brute Stanley who drives Blanche to  her demise, yet somehow you sense a chemistry between them that is  fascinating and the hidden sensitivity of the actor behind the vicious  character he plays to perfection...Kim Hunter is PERFECT as the sensual,  sensitive wife who loves her sister but cannot resist her husband's  electrifying sexuality...Karl Malden is EXCELLENT as the somewhat bumbling  puritan captivated by Blanche's exquisiteness but too ignorant to  understand her neediness...The plot is powerful and moving to tears, but  it's worth it for the experience. Cannot recommend enough...Buy this  film!",954460800,16,1007,5.509803921568627
101417,5,0790729377,"Elia Kazan,s perfect casting of Vivien Leigh makes this a milestone for sure. Brando repeats his great performance from the stage.
What better casting is it than to cast a psychotic actress playing ...same.

101418,5,0790729377,"I'm a little late, but I read the response from  ""A Viewer From Los Angeles"" to Rolf Seluchins re: a letterboxed version of Streetcar.  ""Viewer"" states that the aspect ratio of 1.37:1 was standard for  this film.  However, on Turner Classic Movies last night (3/4/00), they  showed a letterboxed version.  What gives?  I, like Rolf, would like this  version, not the fullscreen.  Can anyone offer any insight?",952214400,,409,4.985074626865671
101439,5,0790729377,"This is the movie that redefined acting. Marlon Brando gives one of the best performances ever given by any actor in the last century. Vivien Leigh also shines in a particularly difficult and un-likable role. Karl Malden  and Kim Hunter are also great. The story and screenplay are memorable, but  what leaves the impact are the perfectly-staged scenes between Brando and  Leigh, every time Brando is on, the screen explodes. Deffenitely one of the  all time greats and a great example of what great ensemble acting can do.  See this movie. From a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 10!",952041600,2,585,4.696078431372549
101440,5,0790729377,"Vivien Leigh gives one of those rare performances that can truly be said to evoke pity and terror. As Blanche DuBois, she looks and acts like a destroyed Dresden shepherdess. Not since the days of Lillian Gish silents has an actress shown this quality of hopeless, feminine frailty; Leigh would have been great as Shakespeare's Ophelia! Blanche's plea ""I don't want realism, I want magic"" is central to streetcar. When Brando's Stanley cuts through her pretentions and responds to her flirting with a direct sexual assault, the system of illusions that holds her together breaks down, and he's revealed as a man without compassion.... Elia Kazan's direction is often stagey, but who really cares? Here we are watching two of the greatest performances ever put on film (some of the best dialogue, too). When Blanche says ""It's Della Robia blue"", we know just how good Tennessee Williams could be. He adapted this play himself, with additional adaptation work by Oscar Saul; the music is by Alex North and the cinematography is by Harry Stradling. When I first saw this movie, I was much too young to fully understand or appreciate it; after just seeing it again I have to agree that the acting is capital. Leigh does an astonishing job in the acting department in a role which is EXTREMELY difficult to pull off and make believable. Brando does a great job as Stanley the slob and both Kim Hunter and Karl Malden are excellent. While this film will definitely not appeal to everyone, it's realistically earthy in many respects and reminds the viewer just how talented the beguiling Vivien Leigh really was!",947721600,2,1605,4.882783882783883
101441,4,0790729377,Great film but why only the hacked version for television. The dvd has a lot of special features except the WIDESCREEN version?,940982400,4,127,4.818181818181818
101442,4,0790729377,"Although I thought Humphrey Bogart did a great job in THE AFRICAN QUEEN, he was nothing compared to Brando in A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE!!
This is a great movie, with a great story and beautiful setting behind it, but what  made this such a spectactular movie, for me anyway, was Brando's INCREDIBLE  performance.  The man was a true genius, still is actually.  Everyone else  who acted in this won an Oscar (that was nominated for one I mean) so why  was Brando left out?  Who knows...either way, he gave one of his best  performances ever in this absolutely brilliant film.",938649600,3,573,4.66
101443,5,0790729377,"For those who know Marlon Brando only from his recent fiascos, such as The Island Of Dr. Moreau, it might be hard to believe that not only was he the greatest actor of his generation, but his acting set the standard and style  for many of his contemporaries and most of those who followed over the next  10-20 years.  Take a look at Streetcar (and, while you're at it, his Terry  Malloy in On The Waterfront), and there can be no question of his  greatness.  But what is most amazing is that, while this is one of the  greatest performances in the history of cinema, it does not overshadow the  other three leading performances.  In fact, Vivien Leigh's Blanche du Bois  is also arguably one of the greatest performances ever captured on screen,  and Karl Malden and Kim Stanely are just as perfect in their supporting  roles.  Elia Kazan was always an actor's director, and this was never more  apparent than in this film. Even the censors could not dilute the power of  Tennessee Williams' play (as they would a few years later with the  adaptation of Cat On A Hot Tin Roof), but it will always be the acting that  will keep the viewer mezmerized.",926467200,6,1149,4.5

If that sentence doesn't set you up for the rest of this review, I don't know what will. I came to watch it after so many references to it as a classic. There was no street racing. There was no car named desire. The hot guy on the cover does NOT race in the streets. It is however a DRAMA. Every moment is rife with emotional tension and romance. It's not what I expected but it sure was a wild ride.",1520640000,,496,3.9207920792079207
