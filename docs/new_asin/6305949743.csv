1102684,3,6305949743,"Though overexposed after the whole Titanic thing, Kate Winslet is an awesome actress.  Even though Titanic was great I will discount her  peformance there because of the overkill.  So instead, look at her roles in  Jude the Obscure, Hideous Kinky, and Sense and Sensibility.  She is a  beautiful and excellent actress.
And we all know about Harvey Keitel.  By  far one of our best actors.  Hands down on that.
Both Winslet and Keitel  took a big chance on this film.  It is quite the movie and both actors took  big risks in this film.  I do not want to give anything away, but they both  went over the top.
The story is very original and raises many issues  about cults, spirituality, sexuality, feminism, family, and whats really  crazy.
This is not a film for the lighthearted.  This is not a Saturday  night date movie.  This is the type of film you need time and a lot of  attention.
Kate Winslet really steals the show with her beauty, her  acting, and her courage to take on a role like this.
If you have time and  a rainy day check this film out.",966211200,2,1054,4.408376963350785

During the 3 days that they're there Ruth and P.J. sleep with  each other (numerous times), and P.J. begins to be deprogrammed by Ruth.  It is a very interesting plot.  Kate Winslet mastered the screen again,  and Harvey Keitel was also brilliant.  I suggest this movie to anyone who  likes to be shocked and thrilled.

1102797,4,6305949743,"I was never a great fan of Campion's movies. Though moving and compelling, I'd always felt she was too didactic, too emphatic, too stark in her metaphors, too obvious. Until reading what appeared to me to be utterly benighted reviews, especially of The Piano, Holy Smoke and An Angel at my Table. (I mean among the 2-3 star reviews)

In these movies she explores the idea of integrity, specifically feminine integrity. As opposed to the more thoroughly explored idea of masculine integrity. The lone hero: the against all odds hero, the self absorbed artist hero, the driven scientist hero. Campion's female ""heroes"" (sic. because ""heroine"" has an entirely different connotation) - are driven by their own sense of worth and value - In Holy smoke the erotic and religious mysticism are played off each other as fundamental passion. In The Piano the erotic and musical inspiration are played off each other. In ""Angel"" an utterly unconventional woman feels driven to express herself through her writing, and is mis-diagnosed as schizophrenic and incarcerated in an institution. (Because she can't conform to conventional expectations.) The main difference between the conventional male hero and Campion's female heroes is that the conventional male hero is OPPOSED by social elements. Campion's female heroes are REPRESSED, denied, discounted.

Female erotic drive and yearning: As religious and mystical revelation (Holy Smoke). As music and piano playing and composition (The Piano). As writing (An Angel AT My Table) - And in each movie there is denial and repression from an outside force, usually male, but more generally from petty bourgeois sentiment and complacency. And, of course, fear.

My takeaway from all three movies is that whether or not we regard the principle female as ""attractive"" or not, Campion offers us insights into women with deep and powerful drives. And the conventional societal, fear driven, repression and denial of those drives and passions.

Campion does not provide a pleasant evening of mild entertainment. Her movies are disturbing and fierce and provocative. As they should be.",1419811200,,2114,5.282738095238095

She decides to stay in India with her new life.  Her girlfriend traveling with her is appalled and rushes home to tell Ruths parents what it happened.

The mother is convinced that her daughter has been brainwashed.  So she lures her daughter back with a false statement that the father is dying.  When Ruth gets home she finds that they have hired a deep programmer P.J. Waters (Harvey Keitel) to correct the situation.

Things do not quite go as planned and we go along for the ride.

This little ditty, written by Anna Campion and Jane Campion, is more like a story written by Steve Barry.  It starts out very logical and very serious; slowly but surely it becomes more farcical until it reaches a hilarious off the chart situation.

The first delight is the nostalgic trip through the 70s-80s religious/ psychological explorations which many of us experienced.  The core of the film takes place in an isolated cabin in the outback, where it becomes unclear who is deprogramming whom.

1102976,3,6305949743,"Holy Smoke (1999)'s strong point is its originality, that will be
understood as such mainly  by HK's niche of movie fans, as
compared to the general public. This suggests that his style of
movie is an acquired taste. The directors have taken on many
risks in this work, mainly in regards to its commercial
potential.

The script, as a concept, has the right ingredients, the right
structure, with many right decisions, such as that touching on
the filming locale (Australian landscapes and its desert)
reinforcing its natural beauty.

Here, Kate Winslet, plays Ruth, (who is no match for Harvey
Keitel's acting, playing PJ Waters .) He is a self-professed
exorcist to those under the mindcontrol of cultists.

Although, KW's physical charisma is admirable, she seems to
struggle a bit in relaying visually a depth occasionally over the
90 minutes. Overall, she delivers in terms of the role, but quite
less naturally than HK.

So, this will be a difficult film to watch, and an unpleasant one
at that, by many viewers, partly  from the controversial aspects
that are touched upon, but mainly from the mature subject matter
shown.

Of course, the story would not have been the same without
presenting those elements,  and neither would the sensationalist
aspect be as effective without the extensive eye-candy, (from the
sparseness of clothes that is the case  in much of the movie, by
the actresses.)

At the same time, the story is paradoxical. Intuitively, at the
outset of the picture, viewers  guess that the story will
reinforce their self-righteousness in regards to the superiority
of  Western and North American culture - only to see it the
protagnosist fall  into a jumble of moral, ethical, professional
and personal chaos. That is, Keitel's character ""loses it"" time
and again, falling prey to human weakness of character.

In sum, on the one hand, viewers may find the artistic aspect
relaxing, ( in the way of Claude Monet's and Renoir's paintings,
for ecxample) from the Australian scenery and calm pacing of the
story. On the other hand, given that this DVD is a niche-movie
(not for the masses) it may be indigestible to most of the
general public, except the fans.",1358553600,,2181,4.956043956043956

1102979,2,6305949743,". . . of Kate Winslet, of Pam Grier, of a great soundtrack, of an intriguing premise, of the beautiful landscape of Australia, of the initial compelling scenes in India . . . I could go on and on about the many missed opportunities here.

Kate Winslet's character, Ruth, starts out as a wide-eyed Australian girl who becomes mesmerized by an ashram in India and its leader.  Her family becomes concerned and concocts a plan to bring her back to Australia and rescue her with the help of a professional deprogrammer.  Somewhere along the line, Ruth is able to emotionally overwhelm the deprogrammer and manipulate him.

Great premise, right?!  Unfortunately, the whole thing is undone by the uneven tone (is it a slapstick comedy? a melodrama? a character study? an erotic film? - it's all of the above! and it doesn't work!) and so many other problems. Ruth's family is cartoonish.  Harvey Keitel, as the deprogrammer, devolves into a complete mess and - by the end - a scary weirdo. Ruth's character was completely inconsistent - maybe the movie was trying to show her evolving over time, but it was all such a mess that I didn't buy it.  The Ruth/deprogrammer relationship was convoluted and unconvincing.  The dialogue was simply laughable at times.  The ending didn't make much sense from all that we'd seen happen - it was like they hit the 2-hour mark and slapped an ending on.

And seriously - has any man ever watched a woman pee down her leg and thought ""God, that's sexy!""  Really?!  Perhaps that was the first sign that the deprogrammer wasn't all there, either.",1341100800,2,1573,4.742647058823529
1102980,3,6305949743,"The opening to Holy Smoke!- a visual intoxication of India showcased to Neil Diamond's ""Holy Holy"" - is among the best openings to a movie I have ever seen. The subsequent few minutes of the action in India, before detouring to Australia is also very well done, and together captures the atmosphere for a very endearing movie that may have wonderfully portrayed the spiritual struggle of the main character, played admirably by Kate Winslet. Instead it turns endlessly neurotic, parading out an endless display of the various charaters' idiosyncrasies, thus extinguishing the fire this movie might have had into a depressing puff.",1327449600,2,630,5.186274509803922
1102981,1,6305949743,"Kate Winslet is a fantastic actress.  The DVDs of ""Enigma,"" ""Sense and Sensibility,"" ""The Holiday,"" ""the Reader,"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" are on my shelves, and I know that I will be watching them all again and again for years to come.  And I know she'll gift us with many great performances in the future. (and I loved Harvey Keitel's performance in ""Pulp Fiction"" and while ""Bad Lieutenant"" was grim, it was at least interesting).

But ""Holy Smoke!"" totally misses the mark.  The idea of Kate Winslet being brainwashed by a cult and then getting locked in a house for three days with a deprogrammer with issues of his own could have been such a great story...if only they had played it straight as the utterly serious and tragic subject that something like that happening would be in real life.  Instead the movie descends rapidly into weirdness and improbability.  I lost patience with the film the night that Keitel's character shows Winslet's a cheesy movie about cults.  We're asked to believe that on viewing just a few minutes of this single film, Winslet's entire faith in her religious leader is shattered.  Somehow, I think it takes a lot more to break the faith of someone caught up in the clutches of a cult.

But it got even worse after that.  How worse?  Well, right after Keitel destroys her faith with a single film, she's apparently so distraught that she burns her clothing and he finds her naked outside of the remote house they're staying in.  She kisses him and tells him she doesn't feel loved.  That's not so hard to believe if we accept she'd really have a crisis of faith at that point.  Keitel's character resists her and walks away...so far so good.  But what apparently changes his mind is when --I'm not making this up-- she pisses herself.  I don't have a clue as to what that was supposed to mean since the movie was a ""serious"" project and not some piece of twisted fetish erotica (maybe it emphasized how completely vulnerable she was but blech!)  And that apparently does the trick, she and Keitel make the two-backed beast and let me say, it ain't dreamily erotic like Winslet's seduction of David Cross is in ""the Reader""...just coarse and unpleasant.  After that, it descends into even more weirdness until the deal is sealed with a wildly improbable happy ending.

The only thing I can think of when I consider this movie is ""Wow, Kate Winslet really, really, REALLY wanted to avoid being typecast as a standard Hollywood star after her role in the monster-hit ""Titanic"" (a movie that I hated because of the terrible script)...and there's no movie too strange for Harvey Keitel.

The movie's only redeeming features is that Kate Winslet looks lovely then as she doesn now (and curvy unlike so many anorexic ""super models"") and does a convincing Australian accent.  Oh, and the scenery in Australia where the film was shot is beautiful, but that's hardly worth subjecting yourself to this film.

I can only hope that when Kate Winslet, who I adore, recalls this film, she winces and her next project will either be a worthy ""serious film"" like ""the Reader,"" a joyful romp like ""the Holiday,"" or even better something like the gem ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.""",1249516800,3,3228,4.737030411449016

Truthfully there isn't a lot to spoil, and my la-dee-da summary up there is my own sub-comment on the painfully linear presentation of Holy Smoke's stick figure plot. With this cast and director maybe I expected too much but what I'm here to report is that ultimately I found Holy Smoke to be flat as the featureless Outback terrain in which so much of it was shot. It did hold my attention through to the end, so that's something, but even for the purposes of a short review trying to describe what happened in the movie is a challenge.

1103063,2,6305949743,"When your big breakout film is `The Piano', which is possibly one of the greatest films ever made, there is a big weight on your shoulders to create something of equal magnitude your next go around.  Campion proved herself a very interesting and unique visionary director with `The Piano', but `Holy Smoke' seems like a giant step backwards.

Please note that this is very hard for me to say, beings that I worship the ground Kate Winslet walks on.

`Holy Smoke' deals with a very deep and poignant premise; a young woman being brainwashed by religion and her family desperately seeking to free her from her mental bondage.  The premise really could have given birth to a fantastic character study and marvelously rooted importance, especially with Winslet and Keitel onboard, but instead it proves to be a missed opportunity.  The film, although sporting a weighty subject, feels empty; lacking in substance.  It almost makes light of a very tragic subject, and while Winslet tries hard to bring an air of honesty to her performance the script ultimately bogs her down to where her character comes off uninteresting.

Ruth Barron, after visiting with friends in India, finds herself under the spell of a certain cult, uprooting her life for a new.  Her friends and family are worried, obviously, and hire a deprogrammer, PJ Waters, to break that spell.  Waters has some issues of his own, issues that in my opinion get in the way of the heart of the story.  We seem to focus more on his relationship with Ruth (as troubled as it may be) instead of the real reason for his entrance into her life.  She is to spend three days with him, and in those three days he is to attempt to bring her to reason.

`Holy Smoke' has its moments, moments where Winslet breaks away from the confines of the script and actually relays to the audience the weight of this subject.  You can see in her eyes the deception and then total plunge into confusion as her newfound beliefs come crashing down on her.  Sadly, these moments are few and far in between.  The sub-plots involving Waters and even Ruth's family take center stage and crowd out the real root of the story.

Campion loses her grip on this one, but she still has `The Piano' to reference when considering her talent.  Winslet delivers a fine performance, but the script barely gives her room to truly shine.  Many consider this her finest performance, but I consider this more her greatest character, and had that character been written better it could have proved to be her greatest performance.  Keitel, an actor I usually enjoy, is rather uninspired here and delivers a tragically overrated performance.  Yes, Winslet is really the only redeeming factor for this film, and she can only redeem so much on her own.",1219708800,5,2760,4.7343096234309625
1103064,4,6305949743,"The typical neurotic or psychotic schizophrenia of the western world suddenly confronted to the other side of the conscious controlling and tyrannical psyche of the Christian mental delinquent. One day they meet with those who do not believe in reason but only in hypnosis and meditation. But do not think these manipulators are the criminals. They are just revealing that the subconscious or the unconscious can take over and become the central axle of our psyche, not because we would be losing our minds but because it IS the central axle of the human psyche.

Twenty centuries of Christianity, on the western side, more generally thirty centuries of Semitic religion on the Jewish, Christian and Moslem sides have shifted our psyche from the natural central axle to re-center it onto what we call consciousness, reason and logic. We have just repressed the rest under the name of unconscious and subconscious, even the ID of Sigmund Doctor Freud. It is obvious to anyone who has some sense that all other traditions that are five or ten thousand old are more human than our short lived one (or ones) but we don't know. We have forgotten how the basic and fundamental element of our Semitic traditions, the famous Genesis is the total and systematic rejection of the previous principles to replace them with a new one, the vision of the sole God and his spirit creating everything from nothing.

When we can meet with the older tradition we get berserk, mesmerized and even hypnotized and we accuse that other tradition to manipulate our minds though we have willfully castrated and destroyed the deeper side of our awareness of life. This film is nothing but the revelation of the depth of this western alienation and self-amputation and at the same time the absolute impossibility to let go with our artificial beings and enter the meditation that would make us merge with the living force of the universe and not the survival instinct of our mechanized, scientized and technologized petty umbilical enjoyment of the city ghettos in which we live. Out worse invention was Scientology that turns this artificial life and thinking of ours front side back by grafting the mental depth of Asian philosophy onto the antagonistic existentialism of psychoanalysis. Mark my word. The Chinese and the Indians right now, and some others along with them, are doing just the reverse and they will take over the world because they will still be rotating around the real axle of humanity and life, the mental force as opposed to reason and logic.

We will understand that and react when it will be too late because we cannot cope with the idea that we had had it all wrong all along and that the real stuff is still alive in Asia and is coming of age after a long hibernation. That is not going to be ""Good Morning Vietnam"" but both ""Good Night Western Hemisphere"" and ""Good Morning Far East of the Rising Sun"". The film is trying to make us believe we still have a chance. It is full of beans. We don't even have one tenth of a chance. We are looking in the west for the generation of leaders who are going to bring us to that consciousness:

If we are lucky the USA will choose the right man in November, not the one who knows how to win wars, but the one who believes in change, not because he is going to bring that change, but because he will have to be able to welcome the change that is coming all by itself.

1103070,5,6305949743,"Synopsis: While on vacation in India with a girlfriend Aussie Ruth Baron (Kate Winslet) experiences a profound spiritual awakening and decides to stay with her new guru and his community of believers. Tricked by her Mother under the false pretense that her Father is dying, she returns home only to find a professional deprogrammer, PJ Waters (Harvey Keitel) has been hired to bring her back to her ""senses."" Whisked away against her will to a secluded farmhouse in the Outback, a three day confrontation ensues between the two. By the end of the allotted time you're left to wonder who's deprogramming who.

I had no expectations concerning the film `Holy Smoke' yet it still took me totally by surprise. Kate Winslet not only demonstrates once and for all how talented an actress she is but displays a sensual side that left me speechless (well nearly anyway). Harvey Keitel also delivers an excellent performance perfectly capturing the subtly of a man slowly moving beyond his clever facade to reveal his true nature within.

`Holy Smoke' is definitely a movie in a genre of its own making. What begins as a journey to spiritual self-realization slowly evolves into a psychological tale of sensuality, eroticism and obsession. Add to the mix several intermittent epiphanies reminiscent of a `60's psychedelic voyage through inner space and you have before you a unique one-of-a-kind film. Expect the unexpected when watching for just when everything has fallen apart and lays in shambles the story returns its audience back to the spiritual path and reconciles the combatants for an unexpected conclusion. This film is surely a shamanic tale in a twentieth century setting encompassing the eternal cycle of birth, death and rebirth. Truly an amazing accomplishment, thank you Jane Campion (director) for this absolutely brilliant film, I love it!",1178668800,8,1850,5.142857142857143

1103132,3,6305949743,"I always enjoy watching Kate Winslet because she accepts daring roles and gives her all in very uninhibited performances. She is one of those young, very talented and oh so beautiful actresses, who isn't afraid to risk being taken seriously by appearing nude. Keira Knightley is another terrific young lady in this category. In this film, Kate plays a wayward young woman, Ruth, who has fallen under the spell of a religious cult guru in India. Her family tricks her into returning to Australia and then hires an expert cult ""exiter"" to deprogram her. In a role very unlike his role in Campion's ""The Piano,"" Harvey Keitel looks very much in shape and turns in a decent performance as PJ, the deprogrammer. PJ is very impressive as he demonstrates to Ruth that he is very knowledgeable about her idol and his teachings. Unfortunately, the time spent on this display of his religious prowess is entirely too brief. Rather than focusing on Ruth's deprogramming and taking the time to make her transformation believable, the film begins to concentrate primarily on their relationships. To me, it would have made for a more interesting film to delve into the reasons why Ruth and PJ believe what they do. Was PJ in a cult earlier in his life? If so, what brought him out of it and drove him to become a deprogrammer? Why was Ruth initially so drawn to this guru that she packed her bags and moved to India? Is she philosophical, or is she as gullible and shallow as the film makes her appear? Instead of exploring these, the film takes the easy way out, and both Ruth and PJ change very abruptly after only a little conversation. Both are allegedly strong-willed; yet, both too easily forego their convictions. Ruth watches a video about cults while catching glimpses of PJ being fondled by her sister-in-law. Suddenly she breaks down. Are we supposed to believe it had never occurred to her she might have been drawn into a cult? She seems entirely too clever for that. Or, perhaps she has lost faith in her deprogrammer and begins to see him either as a common man or even the object of her jealousy? Neither seems likely, and I'm not certain the Campions knew either as they wrote the script. In fact, the entire movie seems as though it cannot decide what it wants to be: a comedy, drama, romance or something else. Ruth never really seems to love PJ until after he professes his love for her, and even then it is not convincing. Perhaps they are two of a kind, motivated by a search for love (or fulfillment of some sort). Who knows? The film starts out well, but becomes fairly unpersuasive by its finale. Ultimately, it is a good premise that goes astray, though you might want to watch it for good performances from Kate Winslet and Harvey Keitel.",1167177600,4,2751,4.639344262295082

I won't give it away or add any spoilers but Harvey Keitel was perfect in the part of the 'deprogrammer' and Kate Winslet was very good as the 'brainwashed' cultist. I also liked the Neil Diamond music and how it was used in the movie.

1103134,4,6305949743,"Kate Winslet plays Ruth Barron, a young Australian woman who goes to India and becomes smitten with the touch of a charismatic guru, so much so that she changes her name and forsakes her family to stay in India and attend to and worship the guru.  Her parents become alarmed.  Her mother goes to India to trick her into coming back to Australia so that she can be deprogrammed by a professional from the United States that they have hired (P.J. Waters as played by Harvey Keitel).

What director Jane Campion does with this once familiar theme is most interesting.  She puts the deprogrammer to the test, so to speak, and initiates a struggle of will between the deprogrammer and his young charge.  The key scene arrives as Ruth comes naked into P.J.'s arms in order to test his professionalism (and her sexual power).  I don't know about you but I think a naked and passionate Kate Winslet would test any man's motivation and make him think twice about what he really wants to do.

The psychological idea behind the story is this question, What is the nature of the guru's hold on his flock?  Is it spiritual or is it profane?  Do the young women who follow him desire him as an alpha male or is it spiritual deliverance they seek?  Naturally Ruth believes the latter and the deprogrammer the former.  But what is the deprogammer's motivation?  Is this just a job for him or does he feel he is helping to free his clients from some kind of mental slavery?  Or is he just another sort of phony guru himself?

Keitel in black hair and black moustache and devil's mini goatee dressed in black with a menacing look and a lot of physical energy (despite being 60-years-old when this film was released) contrasts sharply with Winslet's youthful beauty and beguiling voluptuousness.  Strength of character is something Kate Winslet brings to any role, even including her outstanding performance as Ophelia in Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet (1996), a role that is usually played wiltingly.  Here one senses that her strong will and determination are going to be quite a match for the deprogrammer who gives himself three days alone with her to break her attachment to the guru.

Two questions: One, if he is successful, will that just mean that she has transferred her allegiance from the Indian guru to him?  Will it mean that his psychological strength is greater than that of the guru in far-off India?  Two, in what respect is such a forced confinement with someone who is in physical control going to lead to a variant of the ""Stockholm syndrome"" experienced by some women held hostage, e.g., flight attendants on hijacked planes, and the famous case of Patty Hearst?  Will the captive become enamored of her captor?

Campion handles this most interesting theme by focusing on the sexual and carnal nature of the relationships.  The test of will between P.J. and Ruth becomes a question of Can she seduce him and thereby strip him of his professionalism?  The movie is candid about sex and sexuality in a way that emphasizes the power dynamics of sexual relationships.  There is some full frontal nudity and the sex scenes are steamy beyond what one usually sees in an R-rated film.  (If seeing Kate Winslet naked might offend you, I recommend you close your eyes.)

Harvey Keitel did an outstanding job in a very demanding role and was entirely convincing (despite being a little too old for the part); but as usual Kate Winslet completely took over the film with her commanding countenance, her superior acting skills, her great concentration and her mesmerizing charisma.  If there is a better, more captivating young actress working today, I don't know who she is.

Her role here might be compared with her performance in Hideous Kinky (1998) in which she goes to Morocco to find enlightenment among the Sufis.  That is a more charming film, and she is outstanding, but this one gives greater range to her skills.

Notable (and watchable!) as a counterpoint to Winslet's Ruth is sexy and sleazy Sophie Lee as Yvonne who is so taken with P.J. that she fairly begs him to make love to her.  Also impressive is Julie Hamilton as the woebegone and stumbling mother.

Of course I would say see this for Kate Winslet, and if you are a fan, you sure don't want to miss Holy Smoke since it includes one of her best performances; however, what really impressed me is the original and daring conception and direction by Jane Campion who is best known for The Piano (1993), a film that received an Oscar nomination for the best direction and starred Holly Hunter, Harvey Keitel and Sam Neill.

So see this for Jane Campion who is not afraid to show human nature in the raw.",1142380800,27,4658,4.70406905055487

1103137,5,6305949743,"I was in a cult, and also went through remarkably similar experiences to both lead characters. The ambiguity, moral breakdown and personal journeys of the two main characters in 'Holy Smoke' are familar territory to many like me. When I watched it, I felt ripped apart (in a good way) at the hands of a brilliant director. But then I *was* in a cult. And I did undergo a long and gruelling period of emotional adjustment and explorative drifting with no moral direction. Finally, I found that to 'be kind' is a more profound achievement than it appears, and that love can drag you into the 'wrong' places for absolutely the right reasons. In Holy Smoke (misleadingly bad title, Jane), Campion has made a hidden masterpiece, but only for those who have actually been there - I don't know why she understands, but she does. If you haven't visited similarly dark and oddly liberating places, the film is unlikely to affect you. This isn't a film for anyone with a fixed moral stance, but it will speak volumes to anyone who has ever had their boundaries totally stripped away.",1114905600,8,1073,4.682539682539683
1103138,3,6305949743,"""Holy Smoke!"" did not turn out to be the movie I was given to expect based on the title and opening scenes, which was disappointing because I was rather interested in seeing the movie I thought I was going to see.  Granted, since the director of this 1999 film is Jane Campion, I should have known what the conflict was going to be, but I am almost always thinking ahead when watching a movie and this time I saw a fork in the road where they was not one to be seen.

As we saw in ""The Piano,"" Campion's heroines tend to be women who have to travel to some new place to find out who they really are.  In ""Holy Smoke!"" this transformation has always taken place for Ruth Baron (Kate Winslet), who has found a spiritual awakening with a guru in India.  Despite the fact that this is communicated to us by a collage of images of richly saturated colors while Neil Diamond sings ""Holly Holy"" it appears to be a meaningful transformation, even if the guru is not even a second rate holy man.  But as far as her family back in Australia are concerned, Ruth has fallen in with a cult, and so her mother is dispatched to New Dehli to bring her daughter home with a false tale that her father is on his deathbed.  Instead she finds a deprogammer, PJ Waters (Harvey Keitel), brought in from the States at some expense to bring her back to the fold.

I should have realized that Ruth's faith could not run deep, but the animosity of her family towards her new life and new beliefs is based on racism more than religion.  Consequently I was anticipating that Ruth was going to have the better of Waters, and was expecting a debate that represented the clash between East and West.  Instead, ""Holy Smoke!"" comes down to a battle of the sexes.  Ruth and her deprogrammer are sequestered in a halfway house in the Outback where Waters plans to break Ruth in three days, and their initiate discussions strongly suggest that she can give as good as she gets.  In fact, we never doubt that Ruth is smarter than Waters and her entire family put together.  He lets her walk about outside and play with rocks, which turns out to be just one of many mistakes that he makes in underestimating her.

Then, suddenly, Ruth is standing there naked in the night and all discussions on the relative merits of competing belief systems is completely forgotten.  I knew that Ruth was going to turn the tables on Waters, but I did not think it would debunking his machismo.  Such a confrontation is certainly worth the having, but setting it up with the notion of deprogramming is just the wrong way to go.  You can make a comedy about deprogramming, or you can have a serious film about it, but using it as nothing more than an excuse to put these two people in a shack in the Outback seems a waste.

Ironically, Ruth reveals herself to be such a strong personality that it seems odd she would give herself body and soul to anyone, let alone a guru in India.  In contrast we have to believe that Waters' partner in the deprogramming (Pam Grier) must be the key to the operation because his arguments are rather insipid and his ability to withstand either Ruth or her sister-in-law (Sophie Lee) is nonexistent.  He really does not present much of a challenge for Ruth, and the worst he looks the less impressive her achievement, and the less we think of this film.  It is only Winslet's performance that redeems this film and makes it worth the watching, but then she was why I checked it out in the first place.",1101168000,5,3479,4.41471048513302

How the characters get from point A to point F is beyond me and certainly not motivated by what was shown on the screen.  If this movie was designed to question the roles of men and women in religious circles, question physical vs. mental domination in relationships, or question choices vs. others' perceptions of those choices, it would have been a worthwhile use of kodak film.

1103140,4,6305949743,"Jane Campion rides a slippery slope: an Australian woman (Winslet) visits India and becomes indoctrinated with a cult. Sounds like a sombre enough subject, but not in the hands of Campion.
We are served instead a slightly more doozy fare: a part satire, part romantic comedy, part drama and part...ahem...soft porn. There's a good deal of nudity here, and if you are a Harvey Keitel fan, that could be reason alone to grab a copy of this. Truth be told, Keitel is in fact almost embarrassing, especially towards the tail of the movie, which he spends mostly wearing a dress (don't ask.)
Visual splendour of other forms abounds as well. The film sports some gorgeous shots of the Australian outback and Indian pilgrimage towns. Not that any of this really does much to the bizarre ""deprogramming"" dialogue.
If anything saves this movie it has to be one of a couple of things:
(1) Kate Winslet, who is not only very beautiful and sensual, she also lends a great deal of comic credibility to her role.
(2) The second thing that no reviewers here seem to have noticed is THE mindblowing SOUNDTRACK!
Overall the movie is somewhat of a mess with a highly implausible denouement twist, but its probably a worthy ride for Winslet/Keitel fans.

1103203,2,6305949743,"Jane Campion, of ""The Piano"" fame, directed and co-wrote this film, which I can't neatly categorize as drama, melodrama, comedy, or horror parody. I suspect Campion may have thought she was cranking out a ""cult classic"" about cults, but the movie is too filled with nonsensical plot holes and character inconsistencies to really grab a mass audience or even a dedicated tribe of a few.
I was prompted to rent the DVD after the return of Elizabeth Smart, the young teenage girl from Utah who was alleged to have been kidnapped. Upon her surprising return, there were suddenly rumors of brainwashing and cult activity. Being a child of pop culture, I instantly thought, ""Hmmm, isn't HOLY SMOKE sort of about that same thing?""
The film does focus on a young, determined woman (Kate Winslet)who leaves her home and family behind to trek to India. Accompanied by a schoolmate, Winslet falls under the spell of a guru. She stays behind to practice her newly acquired faith, and her friend goes back to the Outback to alarm family and friends about Winslet's embracing of all things Asian. One instantly gets the feeling that these are people who are opposed to curry, saris, and meditation on principle.
The heroine's family comes across as a ragtag lot of dopers, drinkers, adulterers, asthmatics, bigots, and Bible Belt-ers. They are a sorry group, and Campion exploits their flaws and foibles. Obviously, these are people who should not be judging anyone else's call to God, but they do, and their meddling naturally goes awry.
Pooling together their meager resources, they hire a world-famous American deprogrammer. He's embodied by Harvey Keitel, and his performance is best described as fearless and intense.
The relationship between ""cult buster"" and ""cult hostage"" walks a fine line between parody and paranoia. I can't believe such treatments are actually utilized--they seem to blur ethical lines and inflame Amnesty International concerns.
When all is said and done, this is a movie that exasperates and confounds. It seems to be three separate films stitched together: 1) an earnest treatise on who has the right to judge anyone's religious or ethical allegiance. Aren't we all free to worship and believe as we see fit? 2)a battle of the sexes, very derivative of ""Swept Away"" or ""The Night Porter."" 3) a comedy of manners in the style of John Waters's recent efforts or Baz Luhrman's early work.
It's a big, ambitious mess. If you really want to see a movie about cults and people who need rescuing, rent ""Ticket to Heaven,"" starring Nick Mancuso, Meg Foster, and Kim Cattrall. If the premise of brainwashing is what grabs you, there's nothing better than ""The Manchurian Candidate."" (Or, if you just want to laugh at that cinematic device, go for ""Zoolander."")
The one thing I can say about ""Holy Smoke"" is the image of Mr. Keitel wearing lipstick and squeezed into a red minidress will haunt me for months to come. I might need a deprogrammer to expel that very surreal and disturbing image from my mind.

1103207,3,6305949743,"The movie with the flip title of Holy Smoke, from the Academy award winning filmmaker Jane Campion (The Piano) has great cinematography, a good script and excellent performances by Harvey Keitel and Kate Winslet  (The Titanic), but the story lacks something in its resolution.
Kate Winslet plays a twenty-something who leaves her family in Australia to become a follower of a guru in India.  Her family in the outback is nuclear, and large, but they are somewhat frayed around the edges.  Kate is very emotionally intelligent, uninhibited, sensuous, sexy, beautiful and full of life and love.  (Hint: I'm in love with her!)  She went to India with a friend looking for a higher love and more meaning to life than she found with her family in the outback.  She feels and believes she has found it with her guru.
Kate's family, especially her narrow and close-minded mother, is terribly disturbed about this.  To them travelling to India and following a guru are as screwed-up as one can get.  Of course, her mother thinks she's doing drugs.  Kate's mother in particular is a psychological basket case.  She is blind to the fact that her daughter is bursting with life and freer than the whole rest of the family put together.
The family hires a professional cult deprogrammer, an old, very hard looking (like Charles Bronson ) and very macho Harvey Keitel to deprogram Kate.  The general deprogramming process consists in kidnapping the person for several days and assaulting their most cherished beliefs until they give them up.
In going to India and following the guru, what Kate did was no different than going on a pilgrimage or retreat and having a religious conversion.  By comparison, her life would have been several orders of magnitude more controlled had she joined a convent.  One of the things Kate's family is so upset about is that she considers herself married to the guru.  (She has had no relations with him.)  This is no different than a Catholic nun who considers herself a bride of Christ, which is what all vowed nuns consider themselves.
I don't believe in differentiating between cults and the so-called legitimate religions, but nothing about Kate's new lifestyle and beliefs has any of the characteristics of what we popularly associate with cults.
I found the initial abduction scenes very disturbing.  To see such a free spirit being captured like an animal is emotionally wrenching.  Legally, it's kidnapping.
It feels all the worse because the kidnappers think they are doing a great good and because the parents are authorizing it.  What they did is in the same moral category as murder, murdering your own child, but in this case it is murdering your child's spirit.  The process, as depicted in the film, is beyond emotionally abusive.  One feels rage at such a violent attempt to destroy a person's soul.
Throughout, the persistent and indomitable Kate tries several creative means to try and escape.  Soon after Harvey Keitel has Kate sequestered, he starts have sexual relations with her.  This occupies the longest part of the film.  Harvey Keitel makes a colossal fool out of himself.  Near the end, Harvey Keitel's girlfriend, an African American career woman, shows up unexpectedly from Houston, Texas.  Her arrival and actions are not blended in to the film credibility.  When she arrives, she finds Kate nude on a coach and puts two and two together.  She appears only a little bit upset at Harvey, and intellectualizes by telling him that he could ruin the girl.
The film is full of ironies and paradoxes.  The family believed Kate was under the control of the guru, but Harvey Keitel abducted her after freely returning to the outback to visit her family.  At the beginning Harvey Keitel tells Kate how he followed a guru when he was a young man and was sexually abused by him.  That is exactly what Harvey does to Kate the next day.  At the end, when Kate's mother and aunt realize that Harvey has been abusing Kate, they get so desperate, they pathetically dig an old crucifix out of a closet and try to recite the Our Father.  (This is the only indication of western religion in the film.)  Kate's mother, ever pathetic, can't remember the words.  Kate is the one who should be praying for her family not the other way around.
 Harvey Keitel's job was to break Kate.  In the end, it was Harvey Keitel who broke down.  I can't call it a triumphant victory.  Kate didn't break Harvey Keitel; he broke himself.  All Kate did was survive.
The images of the outback, especially the deserted highways running are wonderfully.  The are different enough from anything else as to appear surreal.  I love he idea of a place where you can drive for hours without seeing another vehicle, where you can drive like a nut or on the wrong side of the road and no one will know or care.
I'm not sure if I should recommend this movie or not.  See it if you're a Kate Winslet fan.  To me she looks quite different in every movie.  In The Beach (skip it -it's garbage), she looks very elegant and pure.  For Holy Smoke, she must have put on thirty pounds.

The story seemed to lag in places, and other times it simply lacked a story at all! Events occured that simply did not make sense! In one scene Kate kisses a girl, but it's never explained, except that she's basically drunk, and dillusional!  In another she goes out in the desert stark naked and starts to urinate on herself! In the next scene she is haveing sex, but the next day she hates him again! It was a well established fact that she was basically a loon, but that was all that was established!
The story starts after too many events have already occured. It is explained that Kate and another girl went to India, but the reason is never given, and that she got involved with a cult, while the other girl went back home to Sydney. Kate's mother then goes to India to retrieve her, but her mind is gone. Her parents then bring in a man who's job it is to bring Winslet back to reallity!  But then, she starts a bizarre relationship with him, although in reality this is highly unlikely since the man is at least twice Winslet's age!
By the end of the film they both are laying together in the back of a pickup riding on a desert road, their destination is not explained, but in this film, nothing else is either.
Kate is usually such a good actress, and she would be in this too, if there had just been a good story! Believe me this movie is not worth your time!",1001894400,6,1516,4.242214532871972

It was rather unexpected. The womanly, voluptuous and talanted Kate Winslet (who again does some nude scenes, as she seems to do in many films) plays a woman who travels with a friend to India and comes under the influence of some kind of a cult leader and stays in India. Her family creates a story about her father dying to convince her to return to her home in Australia. The plan works, and when she returns to Australia she finds that the family has hired a professional ""cult deprogrammer"" (Harvey Keitel) to make her come to her senses. Winslet and Keitel are both outstanding in their roles, and as their characters spend a lot of time together, you discover that Winslet has conquered this seemingly unconquerable man. He falls in love with her, and by the end of the film, he is chasing her through the desert wearing make-up, a red dress, and telling her that he wants to marry her, and they can even return to India to be with the Baba (by whom she was taken in in India)! It is a touching story in a sense, with this strange relationship developing between them. After Keitel goes a bit crazy and her family wants to kill him, she embraces him, and they seem to share a silent understanding about their love. She and her mother go to India, and Keitel's character returns to the US and has a family with his business partner, but they keep in touch... very pleasant ending for a sometimes disturbing picture.",992131200,4,1583,4.406143344709897

1103286,2,6305949743,"It's hard to deny that Jane Campion is an inventive director. But one could ask the question, ""Has she gone too far?"" with this one. Kate Winslet stars as Ruth, an Australian woman who gets caught up in the mysticism of a India guru. On a simple trip as tourist, she ends up making life-altering decisions and plans on wedding the guru, and living a life in the ""cult"".  Her family, of course, do not want this to occur and will do anything, no matter the cost, to get her out. They turn to help in a deprogrammer named PJ, played by Harvey Keitel.  Needless to say, they get Ruth home - she is violent at first, hurt, that her family can't see the freedom and beauty in her new spirtitual endeavor. Finally, she submits her mind and religion to the deprogrammer and he begins his oddysey to change her (for the better?).  From the movies exclamation Holy Smoke! - we can tell that Campion is painting a rather odd comedy with a bit of drama and the usual Campion vignettes, female power and sexual power.  Kate Winslet is a powerhouse as Ruth, and to add to her magnetic performance - she masters an Australian accent with the ease of Meryl Streep. But, it's hard to take her seriously. Why does she seduce the deprogrammer, to prove the power of reversal? It's interesting to watch the film switch roles between guru-influenced and deprogrammer. Harvey Keitel is sensational as PJ, the womanizing religion-stomper. He submits to Ruth's power, when he should be trying to overthrow her.  The movie lacks the elegance and the intelligence of THE PIANO, but we can't expect Jane Campion to keep dishing out classics such as that. Here, I think she toyed with the idea of making a goofy comedy out of a serious subject. She works it well, but at times it feels pointless, drags on, and loses its fire. Winslet's Ruth becomes tiresome and Keitel's PJ just becomes ludicrous with the flow of the movie, and if anything watch the movie to see the acting of Keitel and Winslet, seeing them together is remiscent of the acting competition of Holly Hunter and Harvey Keitel in THE PIANO. If she could have found a way to keep the fire going all the way to the end, instead of taking the easy way out and making it a goofy farce, the outcome would have been a lot more powerful and interesting instead of feeling like a waste of time.",985219200,10,2325,4.5
1103287,3,6305949743,"I know Jane Campion films are very artsy, but this one appears a little more Hollywood than The Piano.  I should say that the acting by most the cast is top notch.  I especially enjoyed the performance by Juie Hamilton who plays the mother.  Winslet does a great job portraying the subtle effects of being brain washed by a cult.  She (and Campion) keep the experience from being a solid, obviously negative thing and make it believable that a smart teenage girl could be sucked into such a mess.
Keitel's character is increibly complexed.  A rock star ego'd de-programer from the U.S. with all the American cowboy attitude that other countries seem to expect from us.  His hair is horrible colored black with a personality like nails on a chaulkboard.  He has a few scenes in this film that are incredible, including a near touching scene with Winslet's sister-in-law who he makes easy sexual prey of.
If you are looking for some rare Winslet sex scenes, this is the movie for you!  It's always surprising what actors will do if the film is artsy enough.  And once again, we see more or Keitel then we really need to.  If you're looking for something as good as The Piano, you may want to pass this up and save yourself the disappointment.  It is a movie you will remember for a while and it is thought provoking.  I do have to say that it does seem to lack the solid direction of Campion's past films, but a great cast makes up for this.",984441600,4,1439,4.471264367816092

All of the characters were shallow; the romance got annoying and unconvincing; there was not enough background and context to tell us why Ruth was searching for herself and how the family seemed to manage to have all the reveling and laid back lifestyle while no one seemed to be holding a career or full-time job.  Some of the colors appeared to be computer-enhanced and exaggerated, as in scenes of India in the earlier part of the movie.  Except for zoomed in shots of the moon rising and the sun setting, and some panoramic shots of the outback in fiery late afternoon light, most of the shots were exhaustingly and boringly typical of Jane Campion.",983577600,6,812,4.869565217391305

Later it seemed to lose focus and start to meander in different directions but I'm not sure that that wasn't meant to reflect the fact that the main characters are also losing *their* focus along the way, their originally strong and assured viewpoints becoming bent by coming into contact with each other.

1103290,2,6305949743,"Jane Campion and Jan Chapman - two great forces behind one of my all-time favorite movies (""The Piano"") as well as Harvey Keitel (who was SO wonderful in that aforementioned movie), plus Kate Winslet (surely one of the greatest actresses of her generation who has given truly memorable performances in such great movies as ""Hideous Kinky"", ""Titanic"", and ""Quills"") - put them all together with this mindlessly meandering and abominable script and you get one big waste.
At first, I was excited to watch the movie.  Kate Winslet, after all, going to India, after all - my most favorite of countries.  She dis-identifies with her native Australian culture and falls entranced to a Guru.  Her parents want their wayward daughter to come back and they exhibit no shame in their lies and manipulations to accomplish this.  Also, to ""de-convert"" her, her parents pay $10,000AUS to hire an expert to ""un-possess"" her, thus Harvey Keitel is flown in from the U.S. to do so.
After the deceived Winslet returns home, she is taken by force (the leading up to and actual portrayal of this deception and how much of a unforgiveable violation of human freedom it is is very painfully delivered and is probably the most meritorious aspect of the movie) and must spend 3 days in the middle of the desert in a camper/shack with Keitel.  For a little while the focus is on the pitting of each character's mental resolve versus the other and Winslet is honorable in this, having been kidnapped against her will.
But then the movie falls apart totally and becomes directionless.  The movie transforms from being about righteous indignation and the violation of human rights to a ""let's see how badly we can psychologically mess each other up"" game between Winslet and Keitel.  Both characters, though Keitel's  more severely than Winslet's, inflict incredible cruelties upon each other.  (The characters were just too unbelievable despite the great acting - even Keitel and Winslet could not triumph here.)  The ending was pat, soft, and absurd - it was as if the writer had a beginning and end on the mind but exerted no ethics and threw away any degree of plausibility and self-respect in constructing the middle.
As far as the visual aspects of the movie, they were good overall.  There were some beautiful shots of sunsets on the Australian Outback as well some very grim, real, and truthful shots of lower-class Indian urbania (the film was actually shot in both Australia and India).  The red hues and heat of the Australian outback matched the intensity and (passion?) of the action set therein and the darkness and blues of the colors in India contributed to the mysteries Winslet encountered in that place.  I must object, however, to the portrayal of Indian beggers in the movie - I, myself, have been to India and have been approached by beggars and, in reality, they were nowhere near as violent and aggressive as those in the movie.  Very poor taste, here.
I give this movie 2 stars.  The presence of its two leading actors and the decent production and direction command at least that.  But the movie remains ""poor to fair"" due to its perversion of its virtues it tried to establish early in the plot as well as to its bathetic script which even Keitel and Winslet could not save.",981244800,8,3274,4.809269162210339
1103291,3,6305949743,"Alright, so the other reviews on this page either love or hate this film. I did neither. I was just bewildered, because it was obvious that Jane Campion was trying to make a 'different' film. Sadly for her, she took on way too many ideas, issues and themes to address in one movie, and no matter what one might think, 'Holy Smoke' is an unmitigated disaster due to this. To say that this film has no direction is an understatement. I wouldn't say that Campion made a mistake with this movie, but I do agree that it deserved to be a critical flop.
Kate Winslet as usual is excellent and radiant, and the cinematography here is spellbinding - excellent work. Also, the opening scenes in India are fab, and very well researched. The scene where Ruth's third eye opens is both comic and breathtaking, but all of this translates to nothing. Campion sets solid groundwork, and then forgets to take off. Instead, she shifts the focus from the true meaning of spiritual enlightenment, to one of the battle between the sexes, and this is boring. Harvey Keitel is insufferably horrendous as the 'exorcist'. And Ruth's entire family (I hate the way they made the entire family seem dysfunctional - a cheating father, a lunatic mother, a sex-straved sister, a gay brother - as if that was a 'deficiency', and a retarded brother) literally 'rapes' her to hand her over to therapy. This grips you in the beginning, but all of Kate's acting cannot veil the fact that her character is weakly written and confused.
The VHS version of this film is strikingly close to the DVD version in terms of color transfer. The shots of the Australian outback, Indian streets, and the images of Kate Winslet as an Indian Goddess who enlightens Keitel are all beautiful and well done and look splendid on film. The thoroughly unbelievable climax though, sinks whatever hope you might have had of this film recovering and you end up pitying Campion. What were they thinking? This is no 'Hideous Kinky', and I am thankful for that. That was a classy, direct film with heart. This is an empty, yet pretty shell. Good to look at but not worth anything. I cannot believe Kate Winslet let herself be wasted in such a role. She deserves much, much better.",981244800,6,2217,4.658163265306122
1103292,3,6305949743,"The burning question about ""Holy Smoke"" is what were Jane and Anna Campion smoking when they wrote this muddle.  Ruth (Kate Winslet) is a confused young woman who goes to India on vacation and falls in with a religious cult.  However, Ruth is not the only one who has an identity crisis.  This entire film has an identity crisis.
The film starts out straightforward enough and seems to be a drama about deprogramming cult victims.  As it progresses, it veers willy-nilly into various genres using elements of farce, film noir, camp, satire and sexual perversion to name a few.  Director Jane Campion (Best Writing Oscar and nominated for Best Director for ""The Piano"") seems to think that to cook a great stew, the chef must include every food known to man.  What this produces is a jumbled mess, with a disconcerting lack of continuity and cohesion.
Lost in this poorly crafted story are some interesting ironies.  The first is how critical the Christian world is of religious cults when all religions, including Christianity are cultish.  The second is how the people who are purportedly doing the saving are often more messed-up than the lost souls they profess to be rescuing.
Other than the discombobulated story, Campion's direction is excellent.  She has a wonderful eye and brings numerous beautiful shots and interesting perspectives to the screen.  For instance, she shows great nuance in defining characters by their feet, with numerous close-ups of foot garb and bare feet.  This is a unique perspective, which adds something about the character we wouldn't ordinarily see in a film, but that we would notice if we were actually there.
The acting is also excellent.  Harvey Keitel has made a career out of playing dark and outlandish characters, so he is the perfect choice.  His character requires someone who can be both tough and pathetic and Keitel excels at both.  Kate Winslett is something of a mystery.  After coming out of nowhere to hit the big time in ""Titanic"", she seems determined to slink back into obscurity by playing odd characters in minor films.  Her two films after ""Titanic"" were ""Hideous Kinky"" and ""Holy Smoke"", both third tier vehicles (the two films together grossed less than $4 million compared with ""Titanic"" at $600 Million in the U.S. and $1.2 Billion worldwide).  She also seems to have an indelible clause in her acting contract that requires every film to have a frontal nude scene no matter how out of shape she gets.  To say that she is Rubenesque in this film is the kindest of understatements.  Despite these peculiarities, her acting is outstanding as always.  Her character is very complex and she plays her enigmatically, where you can never be sure if she is the victim or the manipulator.  Why she doesn't hold out for roles that are more substantial is beyond me.
This film has a number of good points that are diluted by an overly ambitious director who throws too much excrement against the wall.  I rated it a 5/10 on the strength of the acting and Campion's photography.  It probably would have worked as a film noir satire of deprogramming if she refrained from making the family so farcical.  This is a film that most people will either love or hate.  I did a little of each.",979776000,3,3237,4.810126582278481

She is very, very good as lost soul Ruth who, having been tricked into returning to her home in Australia by her family who fear for her when they discover she has got involved with a cult in India, finds herself having to clamber her way to back to sanity after having been brainwashed by an Indian guru and then, to make matters worse, gets too involved with her Exit Counsellor JP Waters, played by Harvey Keitel (not bad but could be better).  Although I already liked her as an actress my admiration for Kate Winslet as increased considerably after this.
The film itself is clever, quirky and original and I love the fact that Jane and Anna Campion have added comedy to a potentially purely-serious story.  But when the film starts to move into darker waters it becomes slow and patchy and the intensity isn't there enough to be completely clear.  And PJ's sudden declaration in the desert supposed to be the explosion of his mounting change of attitude (you're also not that clear as to whether this is a tactic or what - could have been a clever part of the story but isn't clear enough to be certain) just isn't convincing enough and thus annoying.

1103395,4,6305949743,"I can safely say this is the strangest movie I've seen in a goodly long time.  In a way, it's more bizarre than surreal classics like Eraserhead, because it deals with real people and the strange things they do with and to one another.
Kate Winslet plays Ruth, a callow young Australian who gets involved with a cult on a trip to India.  Her talk of reincarnation and living in light baffles her parents, who are convinced she's been  brainwashed (though Ruth's 'conversion' seems more of a whim than a rebirth).  So they hire PJ Waters (Harvey Keitel), a 'cult exiter,' to talk her down.
Waters is all American swagger, dyed black hair, all-black wardrobe, snakeskin cowboy boots.  He simmers with smooth arrogance; he expects no trouble from his troubled teen charge.  He spirits her away to an isolated hut, and all heck breaks loose.
Refreshingly, this isn't a movie about faith and religion.  I was  none-too-eagerly anticipating long discussions about God.  Instead, the conversation veers into sex and gender roles, exposing PJ's arrogance for the chauvinism it is, letting Ruth give him harsh lessons in female empowerment.
None of this makes too much sense -- the conversations are non sequitur, events unfold contrary to one's expectations.  But it's fascinating and hilarious, so that's forgivable.  The important thing to remember is that you're watching a *comedy*; don't make the mistake of taking the proceedings more seriously than did the filmmakers.
If nothing else, watch it for the cinematography.  Campion knows how to set up a shot; the whole film is infused with Australia's glowing oranges and reds.  In short, a beautifully shot, funny film, a bit nonsensical, sure to spark controversy and discussion.  Definitely see it if you've got an open mind.",974851200,16,1774,5.030821917808219

Unfortunately, half way through the film I turned it off.  The movie's story line was completely wasted, as were the talents of Kate Winslet.  Harvey Keitel's performance was, to say the least, stale, and Ruth and PJ's relationship was unconvincing.

The story is a very interesting one and could have been developed into something great.  Visually it is stunning.  However, after a fairly good start developing some eclectic characters the movie degenerates into something nearly unwatchable.  Don't think I am saying this because the nudity or profanity (of which there is a lot) offended me.  It is just that the story line goes nowhere.  Characters seem to behave in ways that are contradictory to their development. Storylines go nowhere.  Keitel's character makes no sense whatsoever.

1103398,1,6305949743,"HOLY SMOKE was looking good for the first 30 minutes or so of the film.  I had just watched Kate Winslet in HIDEOUS KINKY the night before, so I wasn't really prepared for the comedic tone of HOLY SMOKE.  Actually, I think HOLY SMOKE would be a better film if it hadn't been treated as an off-the-wall comedy and had instead been depicted as quirky drama.
So, at first, I was intrigued by the unfolding story of Ruth (Winslet) looking for a rock to cling to in India, in a cult led by the dubious guru known as Baba.  When her nervous mother showed up on the scene with asthma and fears of pestilence, I was hooked.  Then Campion ripped Ruth out of India (right when it was getting interesting) and plopped her back in Australia with her dysfunctional family and P.J. (Harvey Keitel), the cult reprogrammer.  The remainder of the film consisted of little more than Ruth and P.J. going at one another, both verbally and coitally, while Ruth's family fretted farcically in the background.
At the last minute, Campion tried to imbue the story with some kind of credibility by glossing over the subject of kindness and how important it is in our emotional development, but it was too little, too late.  By then, Winslet had urinated down her own legs (what was that supposed to be about?) and Keitel was babbling and wearing an ugly dress, lipstick and cowboy boots.

Yet, we are impressed by her self-centeredness, which he tries unsuccesfully to hide behind the flowery words of hindu mysticism.  She is brainwashed.
Her deprogrammer shows himself no less brainwashed.  Instead of a guru, he worships youth and especially young women.  He does not love them, but seeks them as some kind of antidote to aging and meaninglessness.
Besides this main theme, I found it interesting that Campion is not afraid to demystify the feminine.  Instead of portraying the woman as free from fault and the man full of fault, she creates more complex figures that defy political correctness.",972345600,5,790,4.894736842105263
1103400,4,6305949743,"I indeed recommend this film - for any an open mind out there that would revel in the twining of such view, or in the depth of such color ~~ as what is found in this movie...
And so, for that prodigious elite who've read this far, I'll bestow upon you a premise and an opinion:  This is a story of Ruth, a young woman who, while in India and in a moment of reverie, wholeheartedly gives away her body and soul to the cult of Chidaatma Baba, no less even to Chidaatma Baba himself.  Her family back in Australia, when they learn of this, invest their every available extreme of effort, time, and money into restoring her to sensibility.  For the task they hire an American, P.J. Waters, a reputed cult exiter.
Now, I must say that I've rarely seen two more excellent actors pitted so fatefully against each other than in this instance, with Kate Winslet as Ruth, and Harvey Keitel as P.J.  Ah - and it's a perfect dance of chemistry!
As he strives to free her soul, which shakes the core of her beliefs - she strives to free his body, which shakes the core of his passion.  And they both deliver - and succeed ultimately in tearing each other apart.
Yet there is no loss of hope - no desolation of feeling to be found at the end of this unique, exhausting film.  I actually found myself lifted higher - an ascendant plane - a scope of optimism - (oh - I could go on, but I'll spare ya, this time...)
What really sucked me in - drew me entranced, like air, no matter, into whatever course upon this drama meant to take me - was the music:  Opening with Neil Diamond's HOLLY HOLY, and continuing absolutely flawlessly through every note of every song on the whole balance of this soundtrack.  I mean, really, how can anything be less than beautiful art to the ears and to the soul than the music of both Alanis Morissette and Neil Diamond on the same soundtrack?  And here you have Kate Winslet and Harvey Keitel in the same movie!
Indeed, Ruth's theme is HOLY HOLLY, her battle-cry YOU OUTA KNOW, while P.J.'s is I AM, I SAID - And Ruth, shouting the lyrics as she speeds down a barren Australian highway, actually adds more passion (a feat I'd never before dreamt possible) to Morissette's YOU OUTA KNOW.  How wonderful!
A long time ago, when I was still but a child, Neil Diamond did his own rendition of Leonard Cohen's SUZANNE.  One disappointment in this film was that they did not use this beautiful song, for in the end it was fitting for our heroine and hero's bemusement as their humanity betrays them -  As they struggle to ascend from depths of shame and vulnerability, with Ruth naked and pleading, with P.J.'s plaintive ""Be Kind"" as he grovels after her wearing a red dress. Suppose that any good life, like any good movie, may be splotched here and there with pain, and with humility.
And it's the stuff of such poetry - for among other heart-wrenching stanzas, in the brooding SUZANNE, he sang: ""And you want to travel with him - Ah, you want to travel blind - And you think that you may trust him - For he's touched your perfect body - With his mind...""",972086400,12,3067,4.380281690140845

1103402,2,6305949743,"The subject of cult deprogramming has been dealt with in serious terms by any number of filmmakers, but director Jane Campion seems to be the first to approach it from a satirical perspective. The employment of such a mocking tone could easily open an artist to charges, on the one hand, of anti-religious bigotry and, on the other, of treating too lightly the real devastating consequences - for both the `victim' and their family - of a person's involvement in either the cult itself or the deprogramming that comes after. For the sheer audacity of her vision then, the Australian filmmaker - along with her co-writing sister, Anna - deserves a certain amount of acknowledgement and praise. Unfortunately, `Holy Smoke,' after a rather promising first half, falters badly, becoming, in the final analysis, mannered, unfocused and, above all, pointless in both its tone and message.
The first half of the film is fitfully amusing as we are introduced to Ruth (Kate Winslet) and her colorful Aussie family, the Barrons. It seems that Ruth, on a vacation to India, has fallen under the spell of a hypnotic guru and her disapproving family has devised a scheme to haul her back and submit her to the methods and wiles of PJ Waters (Harvey Keitel), the world's most successful cult deprogrammer. So far so good as Ruth's `mum' (played by the delightful Julie Hamilton) hops aboard a plane to India to find her daughter and bring her back to Australia and, consequently, her senses. Mum's fumbling attempts to comprehend this alien, exotic culture provide the heartiest laughs in the film. Unfortunately, once Ruth and PJ are locked away in an isolated cabin in the outback for a bit of one-on-one deprogramming, the film completely loses its way, abandoning the eccentric members of Ruth's family and forcing us to observe, almost exclusively, these two far less interesting characters. For a while the film does raise a few pointed issues. We wonder, for instance, what kind of people fall prey to these brainwashing spiritual leaders; then we ask ourselves, if the alternative of returning to a presumably empty existence is really so much better. We contemplate as well whether the deprogrammer really has the answers - or is he, in addition to restricting the freedom of choice of this adult individual, himself compensating for some internal emptiness he fears to acknowledge? Sadly, such morally ambiguous themes go largely unexplored, as Ruth and PJ lock horns in an increasingly bizarre and decreasingly funny battle of wills. Soon, Ruth is wandering aimlessly around the compound stark naked (funny, usually it is Keitel who does the full frontal nudity thing in his films!) and PJ is allowing her to dress him up in women's clothing and daub his face in lipstick and makeup. As the Campion sisters lose their grasp on the themes they have so brilliantly set up, we become more and more uninterested in the story's outcome. Ruth never becomes a full-fledged character in her own right. We are given virtually no inkling of what kind of life she led before her trip to India or of what exactly led to her feeling of spiritual emptiness. PJ, predictably, violates his own professional ethics code by falling in love and sleeping with his patient, an act that has not the comic thrust to compensate for its queasy distastefulness.
Thus, despite a promising beginning - and some very good performances by a gifted cast - `Holy Smoke' leaves the audience pondering the why and wherefore of its existence. If one is going to make a comedy out of such touchy material, one had best figure out a clearer destination and map out a better strategy to get there.",970876800,11,3656,4.898387096774194
1103483,4,6305949743,"In this sometimes whimsical but always entertaining film, veteran film director Jane Campion tries to do more than she actually does, ie: create a modern feminist classic, but it's ok, because she was aiming high, and the arrow lands right about on the bull's eye anyway. At least I think it does! I can't be completely sure.
Holy Smoke! is a bit of an off-centered and whimsical film, mixing silly-esque comedy, drama and a pseudo-documentary style together in a way which doesn't always make sense, or even necessarily work very well.
The film bears some resemblance to 1999's ""Hideous Kinky,"" which featured another knock-out performance by Winslet, and which also dealt with issues of identity and religion and the implications of being a completely ""free-spirited"" woman, ie: how in focusing solely on finding enlightenment for ourselves, we may be cutting ourselves off from the very thing that fills our lives with meaning and maturity, ie: our relationships with others.
In Holy Smoke!, Winslet plays Ruth Barron, a headstrong, Australian teenager hungry for meaning in her life. While Ruth is away in India, her family learns that Ruth may have fallen prey to a religious guru. In order to suppress their fears, they hire ""famed American cult deprogrammer"" PJ Waters, played by Harvey Keitel.
Once Ruth gets pulled back to Australia and meets the ultra-macho PJ,sparks fly like crazy!  Waters is being paid by Ruth's  family to ""deprogram"" her, and is thus in a position of  authority over her. But she's not a stupid girl, and by no means is she a weak one! She fights back with all her might from having her identity, and the truths which she feels she has discovered in her travels, taken from her.
Isolated from the world at large and Ruth's family for three days in a shack in a remote part of the Australian outback, a battle between the two ensues. For power, for each other, for themselves. In the process, an unlikely relationship forms between them which both know can't last for long, but which is explosive in its power to change them both forever.
By the end of this gender-bending shocker, PJ, (who Campion obviously wants us to see as taking on the ""female"" role, he is, after all, in a dress, and wearing lipstick,  which Ruth had put on him), has surrendered fully to Ruth,  only to be scorned. He has been seduced, raped in a sense, of his  identity, his hard metallic shell, and he lies, covered in  dust and blood, a soldier wounded in battle. He sees a mirage of Ruth, waving to him in the heat of the desert sun. Is she his savior? Or is the search for a religion/spirituality external to onesself always the giving up of one's own power? Campion seems to ask these, and other questions, but answering them proves more difficult, chimeric.
As Ruth says in a postcard one year after their tryst, ""Something happened out there, didn't it?"" ""Yes,"" PJ responds, ""and in case you didn't notice, it almost killed me."" And she finally says it, ""I don't know why, but I think I love you."" Respect and love were the unlikely offspring of their tearing each other apart. They were both involved in the war, between each other, between the sexes, and they have forged a bond which can't be broken upon surviving it and coming out the other end.
In the end, Ruth is shocked and disgusted at the *power* which she finds bottled up inside her, the power which she throws shamelessly at PJ in a desparate attempt at showing that she too is strong, she too is OK, she too knows ""the Truth."" Through her journey with PJ, she realizes that his words to her, ""Be Kind,"" were all she was looking for, and how miserably she had failed in doing just that. It is in this way that she comes one step closer to being the independent, caring woman she has wanted all this time to be.
By all means, this is a feminist film, and it may catch some people off guard with its extreme portrayals of vulnerability and power. However, the intensity and depth of this film is taken down a notch every now and again with bits of comic relief provided by Ruth's hilarious dysfunctional family, especially early on in the film.
The voluptuous Winslet is positively luminous in this film. She lights up the screen like there's no tomorrow. Men and women alike will be transfixed.",970531200,3,4271,4.656498673740053
1103484,5,6305949743,"In a word this film is extraordinary.  The actors Ms. Winslet and Mr. Keitel, together with the director Ms. Campion are to be commended for delving so deeply into such provocative material.  Ms. Winslet especially continues to astound and proves that she is like a young Meryl Streep for the wild, dangerous, and brave choices she makes. Go back and rent HEAVENLY CREATURES after this, skip TITANIC, and get ready for her performance as the Marquis de Sade's chambermaid in Q.
The supporting cast of mainly australian actors are extremely funny and touching in some all-too-brief scenes. One hopes all of the parties will make another film together....soon. Reward yourself with a first rate, thoughtful, fiercly independant film. Nothing about this film is predictable.  Desire and obsession in the australian outback.  Py jimminy, what more could ya ask for mate?",970444800,4,866,5.164285714285715
1103485,5,6305949743,"This is a strangely beautiful film- a film as mesmerizing as the religious  ecstasy that touches Ruth and the romantic love that seizes PJ. The Campion  sisters are making an interesting comparison here, a comparison from which  the movie takes its name:  that there is a similar captivating force in  both romantic love and religion, and that both are like getting smoke in  your eyes.  Rationality becomes secondary to overwhelming conviction.
This film had so many finely wrought moments that I occasionally  exclaimed out loud, ""Brilliant!""  One such moment is when Harvey  Keitel's character, PJ Waters, the cult exiter, swaggers into the film via  the Sydney airport with his tight jeans, black shirt, cowboy boots, and  sunglasses.  We see a gaggle of people surrounding the luggage carts as  they make futile attempts to dislodge them from one another.  The crowd  separates as the gum-chewing PJ approaches and effortlessly extracts the  carts, artfully twirling them toward grateful and awed travellers. We  understand instantly that this is a man to be reckoned with.
Yes, I  cried watching this film.  But not only for the pity I felt for Ruth and  P.J., but for the film's general excellence.  Acting like this made me  wonder at the whole of film making, made me feel proud at human  accomplishments.  Winslet gives us a Ruth that is rich, multi-layered,  powerful and vulnerable at the same time.  Keitel is a courageous actor:  you'll know what I mean when you see the red dress.  These are first-rate  performances, and I feel grateful to have witnessed them.",968112000,4,1576,4.996124031007752
1103486,1,6305949743,"Wow, what a truly bad movie. I was shocked to read the critical acclaim over this film after suffering through it. A surprisingly bad movie  considering the top talent: Director Jane Champion, Actors Harvey Keitel  and Kate Winslet. Unless you have some deep desire to see Harvey Keitel in  a dress I'd recommend you steer clear of this awful film.",967507200,5,348,4.766666666666667
1103487,4,6305949743,"One either likes the Chapman and Campion films or one doesn't.  That may seem a simplistic statement, but I cannot discern a demographic pattern.  Women I thought might like their films don't and while some men do, many  don't.  Chapman/Campion films are provocative, off-beat, and pure works of  art. Think of it -- ""Sweetie"", ""Angel at My Table"",  ""The Piano"", ""Portrait of a Lady"" and now ""Holy  Smoke"" -- what a lineup. If you didn't like their earlier films, you  probably won't like this one. Harvey Keitel, and Kate Winslet do an amazing  job of acting in this film. It could not have been easy dramatize a number  of the scenes as there are embarrassing moments for both.
Winslet plays  Ruth Barron, a young Australian girl who has found religion in India. Her  alarmed parents send for a cult deprogrammer -- an older man named  P.J.Waters played by Harvey Keitel. Most of the film centers on how PJ goes  about trying to deprogram Barron.
Campion has a wry sense of humor, and  much of this film is probably tongue and cheek. For example, picture Pam  Grier (PJ's partner-deprogramer) singing the ""Our Father"" at a  critical moment preceding an apparent miracle! It's probably fruitless to  try to decode Campion's films completely. Like any work of art, they speak  to different people in different ways. To me, they are inspirational. And,  I love her films because they are about women and their quest for love,  fulfillment, acceptance and salvation.
Does PJ succeed in breaking Ruth  and/or restoring her by exposing the shallowness of her new-found  convictions? Does Ruth succeed in retaining her faith or does she find it?  It is said an inward spiritual change is often accompanied by an outward  sign.  This is a complex film about inward spiritual change, faith,  salvation, miracles and love. In the end both PJ and Ruth undergo a  sea-change. It may be they are saved by each other or by divine grace.",967334400,3,1924,4.801223241590214
1103488,5,6305949743,"This is a movie about power, sexuality, and courage.  Ruth (Kate Winslet) goes to India and joins a cult, then is brought back to Australia by her  mother and the family calls in Harvey Keitel to ""deprogram her"".  At the first, the deprogramming makes us uneasy.  Ruth (Kate Winslet's  mother) tells her that her father is dying (he's not) in order to get her  back from India, and then all sorts of emotional blackmail is used to get  Ruth to go through the deprogramming.  Harvey Keitel's character is not an  attractive one.  He is American and arrogant, and we watch him laying out  his program in order to crush Ruth's spirit.  Ruth has more strength to her  than we thought possible!  What's more, strength is related to her ability  to throw herself whole-heartedly into ways of thinking and being that more  conventional people are afraid of.
This movie really moved me, because it  seems to be a comment on strength and weakness of character in a way that  I've never seen described before.  The events are weird and not realistic,  but they throw light on patterns of relationships between people that is  the most real thing I have ever seen on the screen.
The sexuality part  between Kate and Harvey was disturbing and fairly raw.  It confronted  full-on the issue of power and sexuality from a female perspective, which I  fully appreciated.  Thankyou Jane Campion (and sister who helped write  this)!  This is an area of experience that is common and yet taboo, carving  out a sexual identity for a strong, free woman.
I was worried about Kate  faking an Australian accent, but she did a superb job.  Everything was  (except for Kate) as usual, exaggerated Australian, which I think may have  turned off some non-Australians who don't really get the poetry of our  country.  I loved the filming of the desert.  Brilliant.",967161600,3,1835,4.7507987220447285
1103489,2,6305949743,"Starring Kate Winslet as a young Australian woman whose family hires Harvey Keitel to ""deprogram"" her beliefs when she joins a cult in  India, this video held the promise of an offbeat and interesting story.
I  sure was disappointed.  The story was too contrived.  And very very  silly.
Winslet's Australian family are just too much to be believed.  Dysfunctional to the core, they are there to provide comic relief in this  film which can't seem to decide if it's a comedy or a drama.  There's also  supposed to be romantic chemistry between the 61-year old Keitel and the  25-year old Winslet.  But I couldn't help giggling in disbelief at their  supposed passion. And we glimpse very little of the actual cult.  Winslet  is kidnapped by her family too soon to explore that important aspect of the  film.  All the centuries and variety of religion in India are never dealt  with.  Just because it is different, it is labeled ""cult"".
The  performances by Winslet and Keitel are good however.  Both of them are  accomplished actors and do their best with their roles.  And the  cinematography of the Australian outback is also done well.
But, after  all, the essence of a good film is the story which was much too talky as  well as being silly.  I found myself dozing off and wanting to ""fast  forward"" it to the end.
My recommendation:  forget about it.",967075200,9,1354,4.695278969957082
1103490,3,6305949743,"I really meant to give it 3 1/2.
Well when I first went to the video  store to rent the movie, I didn't expect it to be a classic because I've  read some of the reviews and they were mostly negative. Maybe was because  of the subject matter of the film or the twist and turns some people might  of find it disturbing. But when I finished watching this film, it was  really interesting and really had enjoyed it.
First I have to say that  this movie the most original I've seen. It has a lot of subjects to discuss  about. To, sexual seduction, power, control, and sexual politics. And the  film really great cinematography.
The story in itself wasn't that moving,  but I have to say that some scenes were quite funny, shocking, and  interesting. But the main reason to watch the film is for the lead actors,  especially Winslet. Kate Winslet (Ruth) mesmerized me like never before.  She once left me in doubt after seeing Titanic (who some who don't  recognize the lead actress, is the one who played Rose in Titanic), but now  she proved to me that she's one of the best actors of our time. And for  Harvey Keitel (PJ), he was ok for being a screen veteran. But the story  here is really Winslet, she was so engagingly gorgeous that she stoled  every scene she was on. She truly was overlooked by the Academy this  year.
The film itself was average. It was somewhat shocking, but  sometimes the screenplay was lacking. At times we couldn't really see what  was into the minds of Ruth and PJ.
But I really only recommend this film  within the peformances itself.",966297600,,1562,4.448763250883392
1103491,4,6305949743,"I am a big Harvey Keitel fan but even I never expected to see the big HK getting gussied up in Kate Winslet's clothes and make-up.  That pushes this  movie a bit over the top toward movie's end as the two stars get more and  more entwined.  I did like, however, the whole idea of a film's turning the  religious deprogramming experience on its head, where the deprogrammer and  not the ""religious fanatic"" strikes the viewer as the crazy  person.  Experience Winslet's extended family in the movie (Keitel's  employers) for even a little while and you will easily understand how the  religious, withdrawn life would have enormous appeal for her.  I couldn't  stand that family!

This film is sort-of a romance between the characters  played by Keitel and Winslet.  Its not like its writer-director's (Jane  Campion's) ""Piano"", which also starred Keitel, but the romance  element is there.  Who convinces whom of his/her beliefs?  Well, you'll  have to see the film to find out that but there is nothing that takes the  expected route in this film.  I enjoyed Keitel even more in the recent  ""Finding Graceland,"" where he manages to convince me by film's  end that he's Elvis Presley.  I have yet to see Winslet in a role where she  fails to deliver a full blast performance and this was no exception.  I  thought she looked great in her one nude scene.  The movie is 4 stars for  me, instead of 5, because it was even a bit too weird for me. Normally, I  love weird.
