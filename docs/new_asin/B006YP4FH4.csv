8506515,4,B006YP4FH4,"Delivery fast, movie was excellent however, when i watched this movie i had to keep lowering the volume because i kept hearing an annoying static noise thru out the entire movie. but i did love this movie. I know this is not the sellers fault i think that this was just a faulty copy.... i don't blame this seller at all.",1406332800,,321,4.278688524590164
8506516,4,B006YP4FH4,This was a good movie and the cast was right on the $. It was a clear remake of Italian Job but I found it wonderful.,1398988800,,117,3.5384615384615383
8506517,5,B006YP4FH4,"I started watching it on the long flight from Asia and couldn't stop (and you know Bollywood movies are anything but short). The movie is definitely a notch above the usual Bollywood fare - action takes place actually in multiple international locations (Russia, New Zealand), there is no excessive silliness, fine actors, and great dance routines! I looked for the soundtrack the next day I landed... The only downside is that the idea/plot are not original (but who remembers all plot details of Italian Job from many years ago anyway?).",1375401600,,539,5.0
8506518,2,B006YP4FH4,"Abhishek Bachchan is one of my favorite Bollywood actors, but this was not a good movie.  A song that was on youtube was cut from this movie. There's no good songs from the movie either.",1360281600,,186,4.314285714285714
8506519,2,B006YP4FH4,"5/2/2012  THE ITALIAN JOB WAS A GREAT MOVIE.....THIS IS NOT ENJOYABLE AT ALL...WATCH Abhishek's ""GAME"" INSTEAD. MUCH BETTER THAN PLAYERS ...This is at best a MEDIOCRE copy of the original. This pains me greatly to say because I am a big ABHISHEK FAN. All these people have done great work in the past except for Bips and I don't count Sonam she's young maybe she will improve in the future. For God's sake don't ask her to dance until she gets a better choreographer and some much needed practice..That was painful to watch dude.

Whats missing from this movie BESIDES oh let's say chemistry, sparks, humor, style, scenery, character acting, dialogues, wit, charm, well nothing .... You name it, it's missing.  Mark Whalberg's part is perfect for  Abhi. He's not a bloated gym boy and usually has great intensity. Dum Maaro Dum , Yuva, Guru, Sarkar, Sarkar Raj,Bluffmaster,Game, etc. He's proven, when allowed, he can do intense action and romance not to mention comedic timing. I love a nice set of muscles but this kind of crook is about finesse and brains. So why did he seem lame and bored in this??? Two words answer it all : BAD DIRECTING.

  Imran khan's great and would of been perfect for the part played by Seth Green in the original and would of made that part his own. There are no parts written to SHINE in this drek. The written women's roles were pathetic .  CHARLIZE THERON'S ROLE was totally unfulfilled by a very inexperienced Sonam.  Maybe Preity, Priyanka, Deepika, Vidya Balan, Anushka Sharma, Rani, or Aish could of saved this. They all have the power of seduction and the experience to know when to let it out and when to pull back and when to fight with a director. I would of flat out walked away from this guy like his hair was on fire and I was a giant can of hairspray. Who am I kidding I would of fanned the flames till half of me was gone and he was nothing but smoke... lol. I should of never reviewed this a second time just to make sure I didn't miss something . Pissed me off even worse.

  EDWARD NORTONS' ROLE FOR EVIL GUY ...Vijay Raaz would of been perfect with his rugged mafia avatar he used in Delhi belly or Ajay Devgan with his handsome self (lucky Kajol). Irfan Khan... he's fantastic at playing seductive evil to the edge maybe they could of fought it out with the director and been allowed to make the part their own.  Well you get the idea. If all you can think of is how you would recast a movie while it's playing , you know it's in trouble from the get go. This is such a dissapointment. Anyone who didn't figure out the supposed little extras from the beginning had to have been at the concession stand (lucky devils).&nbsp;

Bipasha Basu while pretty is too wooden in her expressions and her dialogue is always flat sounding. Her vocal range never seems to change even when she's mad, sad , terrified ,happy,sarcastic, miffed, erotic...wooden WOODEN WOODEN !!!! And would someone please save her from her Botox addiction. Her expression's are even waxen now. Just because she looks good in jeans and a tank top does not mean you should use her for everything action. The closest she came to acting was in Race and Saif Ali Khan can get the goods out of anybody. Dum Maaro Dum she shows smatterings of almost putting all her chips on the table only to fold yet again.  Omkara her dancing is okay but she never channels her inner self outward she seems constantly concerned with where her body is...like a model...smile pose move ...smile.. pose... move...repeat.  Place her side by side with 38 year old Aish , Bips will lose every time. Aish can make you feel her pain, her delight, her impish side or her siren song. Bips will always be just another model until she LEARNS to let it ALL out and just freaking go for it. Dance like nobody is watching, laugh like you don't care if you've got spinach in your teeth.  Look at Humko Deewana Kar Gaye. It's great pure melodrama as it's supposed to be . She's Wooden except that cute wink at the granny character.

 Sonam Kapoor : Heads up Sonam. Abhi  has lived down his fathers legend. We don't google his Daddy we google HIS movie list. He's capable, talented and very hot. She's gorgeous no problem there. I'm going to assume that she's relatively smart but she's not a natural at finding the character in herself. A little of some inner toughness was visible in Delhi 6 .  She does okay in that Jane Austin remake of Emma. She was more fashionable in Thank You than a good actor, the role being very simplistic didn't help. Study Vidya Balan in Parineeta or check out Kuch na Kaho's ending, Aish's character is finally going postal, finger in the soon to be ex-husbands face. Her facial muscles match her voice. Sonam's obviously gorgeous but she is riding on her fathers coat tails. He can channel passion, humor, rage, brutality, whatever he needs he will find. Something a director USUALLY points out to the actor. So you think you can dance Sonam...Watch Katreena Kaif. She's a tall woman so apples to apples here. She might have a bad Hindi accent but nobody cares. She's practiced dancing till her feet bleed and it shows. Period. She knows talent is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. Sonam needs to sweat for a living for a while. Theater roles maybe. Non stop hard work or switch careers.

 Niel Nitin Mukesh is in desperate need of evaluating what he did right in some of his other movies and start getting his presentation down. One shot Nandu. New York....Just saying . More sinister, more passion, less grim face intensity and more of the expression and eye work . He too started showing some actual acting chops for a few minutes at a time then to just come to a dead stop. They all looked bored. For this role channel your inner Malkovich or Norton . Inner psycho or raging punk. Whatever . Pick one and apply it.

 I have seen and loved Abhishek's ability to stay in character while acting in comedy (BUNTY AUR BABLI, Dostana, and now BOL BACHCHAN)  Dramas (KUCH NA KAHO & Kabbi Alvida Naa Khena, Delhi6, Dhaai Akshar Prem Ke (Walk in the clouds bollyversion) ) and action(DHOOM 1&2,Sarkar,Sarkar Raj,Dum Maaro Dum,Game etc) way better than this mediocrity .  He is transferring gold via a hoist and he has to hang from it. Not bad in theory but well it's bland compared to his other work and compared to the boat chases and sinking houses of the original it's just plain sad. The gold is handed over like loaves of bread when the hoist breaks and those shelves would weigh over 150 kilos each. They must of all been doing some serious bench pressing lately. There are only two fight scenes, one mediocre and  one at the very end that is  at least blissfully short and believable even if the director couldn't let it be at all thrilling. Aggghhhhh!!!!!!

  Bobby Deol wisely has himself killed off very quickly. Smart man. He was the only bright spot in this movie for emotional add in.  There is none of the funny dialogues that Seth Green had in the original copy as the real computer whiz was on the good guys side , and the Hndi version of handsome Rob (Sikander Kher) does not get whitty dialogue or funny visuals and while he is handsome his part is written as STALE as DAY OLD BREAD. So yep ...hmmm ..NO witty dialogue for anyone at all for the whole movie..wow who'd they tick off. This screen play could of been written differently bollywood style and been great. A dialogue writer could of been hired it desperately needed one. Totally different action scenes could of been written in. This is an action movie with not much real action or suspense of anykind. Like a dinner without any spice at all. The train scene and a couple of car chases,ramming a house is it. They could of saved a fortune  on filming in other countries because you don't really get shown hardly any scenery anywhere, Did they have the scenes and then cut them out and if so what on earth for .. Wellington is not showcased either a few street scenes of Auckland and a couple of quick outside shots of Russian federal buildings that you could of gotten off of Google.

 Let me save you from yourself...and some money. Watch something else ,anything else but the boredom and irritation that this will cause you. MR DIRECTOR YOU REEK AT REDO'S .  I WILL FORGIVE A DIRECTOR ANYTHING BUT BORING ME TO TEARS. Abhis Other movies were listed above. Yuva has both Abhi and Ajay Devgan who's also in Singham, great entertainer. Wanted with Salu was entertaining. The first Tamil film I've ever seen I found on Netflix the other day, ""VETTAI""(hunt). It's about one cowardly brother who gets conned into becoming a cop in an extremely violent area  and one heroic younger rogue brother who constantly saves him with great action and whit. Both well played by Madhaven and Arya respectively. Don't worry Madhaven gets his brave on later. Now THAT had a pretty good evolving script, action and some cute guys doing a lot of stylish ass whooping and some very fun battle of the sexes stuff with their prospective brides . You can bet I didn't spend the movie recasting that one.  Great humor and adventure. IT did so well they are doing a redo in Hindi. THIS REDO SCRIPT OF THE ITALIAN JOB WE ALL COULD OF LIVED WITHOUT.",1335916800,,9209,4.538043478260869
