4990529,4,B006I1931W,"With the release of this film/movie 'Motorcycles' are starting to reclaim their name. Unlike ""Internal Combustion Engines"" (ICEcycles), the motorcycles in this documentary are run solely on electricity, and motors. It mainly documents two teams preparing, and competing in the first 'Isle of Man' TT race for electric motorcycles. The film starts with a trailer type preview of upcoming events with flash-forward of what the viewer is about to see. The main story begins with Michael Czysz and his wanting to start a USA grand prix motorcycle racing company after seeing a New Zealand built motorcycle (ICEcycle) 'Britten V1000'. The story then shifts to the UK and tells the story of Cedric Lynch, his building electric motors, and his own electric motorcycle. There is archival BBC footage on him in 1980, and then it tells how he and a friend started Agni Motors an India based company. It then shifts back to Mr. Czysz, as his business begins to fail, and he hears about the TTXGP. He and his team then begin to design and build their electric motorcycle, four months before the race was to be held. Back in the UK Lynch and his team hear about the race with about nine months to design and build their bike. It then cut back and forth between the teams, their different ways of building race bikes, and the problems they have during the process. There is then interviews with local people on the Isle of Man about the up coming event, and the process they have to go through to close the public roads which (both the ICE and Motor) races are held on. It then interviews the various other teams about the race, the time they've had to get prepared, and the obstacles they had to go through. It explains that the riders of the electric bike were also going to be racing in the ICE bike races also, however on different bikes. Next it describes the safety precautions and checkouts that the motorcycles have to go through before the race. On the first of the qualifying races, the Agni team finishes 1st, while the MotoCzysz bike along with several others fail to finish. After the race there are several bar room/drinking scene interviews. On the final qualifying race Agni makes 1st place. The MotoCzysz bike finishes with the rider pushing it along with a foot as he rides, because it had run out of electricity, and it's regenerative breaking hadn't worked. In the TTXGP race the MotoCzysz bike burns up its three motors in about a mile into the race, while team Agni finishes 1st, followed by team XXL in 2nd, and team Brammo in 3rd. The other teams that finish and the ones that didn't were also interviewed. Then there is the announcement that one of the competitors died while racing. The film then takes a look at the 2010 TT Zero race, the successor of the TTXGP. There are interviews with the 2010 teams, and slight explanation why some of the motors last year had failed. On the first qualifying round of 2010 the MotoCzysz again have their bike run out of power, on the last qualifying race they come in 1st, with team Agni finishing 2nd. The 2010 TT Zero race ends with MotoCzysz placing 1st, as team Agni places 2nd, and team ManTTX finishing 3rd.

The movie ends after the 2010 TT Zero race. The credits roll for about 40 seconds, then there is a team Agni interview. In the ""Special Preview Edition"" (Amazon item number B006I1931W) the credits continue after this interview. But in the 2013 release of the movie, there is additional footage of the 2011, and 2012 races, which is accompanied by the original audio from the 'Preview Edition', the added clips (adding up slightly over two minutes) with text commentary, end where the music and credits ended for the 'Preview Edition'. In this 2013 release additional music starts as the credits continue after these scenes. The new scenes text commentary, tells that ""Team Agni did not return in 2011"", then of the MotoCzysz team finishes 1st and 2nd, with Kingston University 3rd in 2011, getting the University prize. The 2012 race section tells how MotoCzysz finished 1st and 3rd, and gaining the 100 miles per hour/average prize. with a new company Mugen Shinden finishing 2nd, and the only other finisher being on the TGM motorcycle. The new scenes final message before the credits resume, is two sentences about team Agni, and that ""Cedric will be back."" The credits are the same, even though footage from 2011, and 2012 was added, the credits don't mention this footage, or all the teams involved in the newer races, as it does for the 2009 and 2010 races. When trying to watch both on a computer, I did get a error on the ""Preview Edition"" that I did not get on the 2013 edition. The error was between the decoder and the video card, however it worked fine with the same hardware and different software. The earlier ""Special Preview Edition"" version of this film didn't have any bonus features, however this 2013 release version has several including;

Bonus Features:
* Footage from ""2011 Race"". Bike/Helicopter cameras, with audio commentary by MotoCzysz  racers Mark Miller and Michael Rutter of entire 14 and a half minutes of the race.

*Footage from ""2012 Race"". Helicopter camera, with brief bike cameras. Text description in first and last minute of race, of which 5 and a half minutes are in this video.

* MotoCzysz  Three Minute Build. Not quite three minutes, 2:37 in length. Two minutes of speeded up footage of the sketches, printing of parts, team constructing the 2009 bike, and then thirty seconds of bike coming out of trailer and driving away, at regular frame rate, then black screen with movies web address.

Extended Interviews/Deleted Scenes
* ""Team Agni"" interview. 24 and a half minutes of an interview, standing outside near a white vehicle. Lynch talks about his father which helped build one of the early computers. Then about leaving boarding schools, and being self taught, his early work, and his motors. Then how they got put into cars and motorcycles. Lastly about India, and the name of the company.

* TT Tea with Guy Martin. 2 and a half minute discussion about whether milk should go into tea first or last, then 10 seconds of Tea making tips and web address for a UK tea company.

""2011 Trailer"" Theatrical. 2 minutes and 6 seconds of advertisement, with clips from the movie.

The film is basically about two teams and their struggle with the problems they have in building their race winning motorcycles. It is a story of technology, persistence, heartache, and victory. In the end they both win, and they force their competitors to improve as well. The races themselves are more of a backdrop to the interviews rather then the main features of the documentary. The problems they are dealing with and the parts that breakdown are generally shown, as the viewer is told what went wrong, and how they are going to fix it. Despite the lack of rating for the film, several of the interviews are disappointed team members, mostly engineers and technicians, as they swear each time something new goes wrong. With them however this film would probably get a 'R' rating in the USA. Through out the movie the competitors don't hold grudges about being beaten earlier, and at various times they help out one another, as they struggle to reach the common goal of just finishing the races. I think the reason that the movie was delayed from 2011 'Special Preview Edition' to the 2013 release, is that the director wanted to see the 100 mile an hour/average being broken by an electric motorcycle, and have it put into the film. However, these added scenes seem to be an after thought, rather then anything else, even the credits weren't updated for the 2011-2012 footage.",1373760000,,7673,4.745127436281859

4990531,5,B006I1931W,"I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary, especially the inner workings of the Moto Cysz team at their base in America. The soundtrack made the already good movie 3x better and it fits the high technology being documented. I would have liked to have seen more than the small clips from the 2011 and 2012 races though as they represent big leaps forward. Perhaps a sequel?

Its so awesome to know the end of oil is approaching. These extremely fast bikes are a welcome change to the whole industry. When people see how smooth, relaxing, and extremely fast these electric bikes are, no one will miss the black poison oil from the past age and the corruption and wars that surrounded it. If the next documentary by Mark Neale and Ewan McGregor isn't a sequel to this great movie, I hope its about a new era of electric bikes in MotoGP. If you're thinking about buying or renting this movie on Amazon, I highly recommend it.",1372550400,,917,4.591463414634147
