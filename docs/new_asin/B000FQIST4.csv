2582267,4,B000FQIST4,"As written in the other reviews, this is the first 6 episodes of Season 1 of Yu-Gi-Oh GX.  HOWEVER, the show was NOT cancelled, as someone mentioned in their review.  The first season had 52 episodes.  It went off during the summer (replaced by Pokemon), but returned in the Fall with Season 2.  It's currently playing here in the USA on Cartoon Network at 5:30pm EST.

Now, do I love this one as much as the original YuGiOh? No, not as much! Oh, how I miss little Yugi, Joey, Tristin and Tea...at least there's the recent Capsule Monsters series to tide me over.  However, this series is very entertaining and fills the void left by the Original series.  If you are as big a fan of YuGiOh as I am, then you'll find a place in your heart for this show. Some episodes can be redundant, but the show and it's ""cast"" still pull you in like Yugi and his friends did.

My biggest complaint for this DVD release is that some cartoons, like YuGiOh, that have 52 episodes a season, I say they need to make either 2 disc sets that contain 13 episodes (this would mean 4 volumes would complete the series/season).  Otherwise, they need to release these volumes FASTER.  At this rate, we they will finish releasing Season 1 of GX about the time Season 3 starts (and YES, they are working on a Season 3 for NEXT Fall...5 episodes made so far, already).  FURTHERMORE, WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REST OF THE VOLUMES FOR THE ORIGINAL YUGIOH SERIES.  They stopped after volume 2 of Waking the Dragons series (Season 4) and who knows if we will see any volumes for Season 5 (the Final Season).  Come on 4Kids!",1159056000,8,1586,4.40893470790378

8125697,5,B000FQIST4,"Seriously. There better be commentary on this DVD set and some other stuff too.

I don't want to discourage people from buying this but you have a better chance of finding a torrenting site and getting these. Hell, goto Hulu, sign up, no need for a debit card and just locate them all there for free. Sure you have some commercials, but who cares!

Also for the idiots that think Yugioh GX and Yugioh are the same, please go look up Wiki's. You clearly buy with out looking up into your products... You make Amazon look bad when you expect something like this.
Yugioh GX is based 10 years after Yugioh! the series. After everything that has happened but before Yugi puts the Puzzle in the tomb. (if you didn't figure that out I don't think you ever will). This show is based on mostly on the Adventures of Jaden. So don't get this confused. This series by itself is amazing so don't get them confused again.

Like I said, don't waste your money on something you can go on Hulu and watch. Also Hulu+ is only $7 month.",1389744000,,1016,4.365079365079365
