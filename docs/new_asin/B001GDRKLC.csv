Have not ordered it yet---not sure it is in English---although it was when on Netflix.  Have added that question on comments.  Julia is very attractive and a wonderful singer and the songs are very fine---good lyrics as well as tunes.  And, ladies, Keith Baxter is a very handsome leading man--in this 50's when this was made.  And the character he plays makes a wonderful, understated hero.",1373328000,,484,4.771084337349397
