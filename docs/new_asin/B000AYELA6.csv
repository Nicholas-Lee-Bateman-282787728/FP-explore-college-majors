2397563,5,B000AYELA6,This is a superior series set during WWII. The acting is perfection and the plots are great. It is unnerving to think how close Hitler came to destroying England but the saying that England owed so much to so few (heros) was  absolutely true. A lesson we need to rremember today.,1141862400,8,279,4.470588235294118
2397564,5,B000AYELA6,"This 4 episode series 3 is every bit as good as the preceding first and second series.  The acting by Michael Kitchen is, of course, excellent as is the acting by all the actors.  The screen play is well done and you can really like the primary characters and get good views into their lives.  Foyle is a soft spoken detective who sometimes seems to be ""put in his place"" by a haughty  person, only to actually come out on top with his quiet wit and come backs.  The plots present some interesting and not widely known aspects of the war in Britain.  I would recommend this entire series to all.",1140566400,6,595,4.315315315315315
2397565,5,B000AYELA6,All three sets of Foyle's War have been an excellent view of life under true war conditions.  Mr. Foyle's vulnerability and nobility are evident in each and every episode.  We hope that the few episodes not now in a boxed set will be so rendered shortly.,1137283200,7,254,4.5
2397566,5,B000AYELA6,"I loved this program and all that went with it - my daugher who is a freshman at Dordt College loved it also - worth every cent and more. The stories intriguing, the film work is gorgeous - and the characters have depth and intelligence.",1135555200,12,237,4.288888888888889
2397567,5,B000AYELA6,"This series just keeps getting better and better.  I loved Series 1 and 2 and didn't perceive that there was anyway Series 3 could be any better.  I'm pleased to say that I WAS WRONG!  Series three is awesome.  The characters are more intriguing maturing in a most realistic manner with the stories being even more fascinating.  A fine example is ""A war of Nerves"" that episode truly kept me on the edge of my seat.  Likewise, ""A French Drop"" is spectacular!
If you're into ""Good"" mysteries, you can't get any better than this.  So buy this disc; you'll love it!",1135209600,21,562,4.5049504950495045
2397568,5,B000AYELA6,"I usually find murder mystery dramas a hit-or-miss affair but Foyle's War has renewed my faith in a genre that has largely been done to death in recent years.

Foyle's War is superbly written with great acting from all the main characters (as well as supporting cast and guest stars) - in particular, of course, Michael Kitchen as the rather sobering Christopher Foyle.

Foyle is a rather complex detective, with an inner turmoil of morality and upholding the law (though upholding the law is his final prerogative). For exmaple, there is an episode where a warden has been caught looting from a bombed house and a new emergency law means that the thieving warden will be hanged as a looter. The warden cannot believe, in his niavity, that his crime deserves  punishment of such gravitus. Through Kitchen's subtle facial expressions, we can sense a conflict between the severity of the warden's inevitable punishment and the duty to uphold the law, especially in the cruel time of war. To me, that makes great acting - not what the character says, or how it is said, but what the character says in silence.

War fever England is recreated realistically with actual historical facts incorporated into the fictional story (such as internment camps for German citizens).

Each episode is approx 100 minutes long (uncut versions) and are complex enough to have ample replay value.

If you like intelligent, well written dramas with great acting I highly recommend Foyle's War.",1133222400,,1472,4.963414634146342
2397569,5,B000AYELA6,"Foyle's War season 3 was a long time coming (or at least it felt like it!) and I am happy to say that it measures up in every way to the excellent standard already set.

To get the nitpicking out of the way first, the picture quality seems a little less pristine than in the previous release, with the dark scenes, and even a few of the daytime scenes, a little grainy. Minor matter. Also, the ""making of"" documentary on disk one was nothing of the sort, merely a roughly narrated ""day on the set"" coverage of the making of one scene in particular. It is interesting to watch, but a true ""making-of"" would be very welcome at this point in the series. Also a minor matter.

Nit-picking mode: off.

What continues to impress me about this series is the meticulous attention to detail and to historical accuracy. Each story is built around actual events, from which the mystery naturally springs. Season three finds the stories becoming more graphic (yes, that pinkish stuff all over the walls is brains), and evolving somewhat from the cozy-mystery-in-a-large-estate of season one to a grittier (dare I say more realistic?) type of mystery. And yet the show brilliantly manages to maintain that charm and humor that have made it so popular.

The best episode of the lot is the first, The French Drop, guest starring the wonderful Ronald Pickup and the equally wonderful Samuel West (Hornblower fans will recognize both). A fantastic episode with an expertly maintained sense of tension. Has to be watched again to be appreciated! And there is plenty of humor, with Sam doing a bit of sleuthing on the side, and Sgt. Rivers selling raffle tickets for an onion.

Of the remaining three episodes, the fourth, A War of Nerves, is the most unique - there is no murder until nearly two-thirds into it, and there is never any question of whodunit, or why. But in its own way, this episode might be one of the most brilliant, exploring a vast range of human emotion, from the terror and futility of those who have the job of disarming unexploded bombs, to the love and fear of a girl anxious to marry her beau before the war takes his life, to the desperation of a father willing to do anything to protect his daughter. And underneath it all is the ugliness of greed.

Through each new challenge, DCS Foyle remains his enigmatic self, and Michael Kitchen maintains his character with perfection, allowing us to see more and more of him at every turn, and yet still shrouding Foyle in mystery. Acting simply doesn't get any better.

The DVDs offer more extras than the previous two seasons, all of which are welcome. The ""story behind the story"" is really the meat and potatoes of the series, and crucial to fully appreciating each episode. Also, cast reflections (all text) are entertaining and sometimes insightful reading.

I could wish for more special features, a true ""making-of"" or an interview with Michael Kitchen would be a good start, but their lack in no way affects the greatness of this set. I am amazed at the quality of this series, absolutely unmatched in television today.

Now...looking forward to Season Four!",1132531200,19,3118,4.716911764705882
2397570,5,B000AYELA6,"""Foyle's War"" is as much an exploration of the era in which it takes place as it is a series of murder mysteries. Writer/creator Michael Horowitz based the stories on real institutions and circumstances of World War II, as they were experienced by the 2 generations of Englishmen and women whom we see in the films. The attention to detail in dress, speech, and production design is extraordinary. Series 3 takes place in 1941 and incorporates the Women's Land Army, the early years of Special Operations Executive, and the military's pioneering burn treatment centers into the mysteries. Michael Kitchen stars as quiet, perceptive Detective Superintendent Christopher Foyle, a widower and veteran of the First World War, who feels he should be contributing more to the war effort in spite of his great success as a crime-solver. Sergeant Paul Milner (Anthony Howell), a veteran who lost one leg and perhaps his marriage, is Foyle's right-hand man. And Samantha ""Sam"" Stewart (Honeysuckle Weeks) is Foyle's spirited, youthful driver. ""Foyle's War"" is a wonderful trip back in time, where ever-popular murder mysteries are set against the intriguing background of a world at war.

The DVDs (Acorn Media 2005): PBS cut these episodes down to 85 minutes for American television. The DVDs contain the full 100-minute versions, which truly are better.  There are 4 DVDs, with one episode per disc. Bonus features on Disc 1 are: ""The Making of Foyle's War"" (24 min) which follows one day of filming ""Enemy Fire"" on an RAF airstrip in Buckinghamshire, including filming the crashing spitfire. ""Production Notes: Anthony Horowitz"" (text) comments on history and characters. This was also on the PBS web site. ""The Truth Behind `The French Drop'"" (text) discusses the SOE that was created by Churchill in 1940 for purposes of sabotage and subversion. In ""Cast Reflections"" (text), 6 cast members comment on their characters and the series. There are also ""Cast Filmographies"" for 6 cast members.

""The French Drop"" finds Foyle still dissatisfied with being a police detective and trying to get a transfer to Naval Intelligence. He's distracted from his discontent when a young man is found blown to bits in a book depository, apparently a suicide. The only clue to his identity is an engraved gold pocket watch, which indicates that he is William Messinger, son of Major General Giles Messinger (Ronald Pickup) of MI5 and an agent himself for the super-secret Special Operations Executive (SOE), specializing in ""the arts of ungentlemanly warfare"". Foyle tangles with William's commanding officer Colonel James Wintringham (Samuel West) and interdepartmental rivalries in the intelligence community to unravel this complex case in which no one seems to be who they say.

In ""Enemy Fire"", the Royal Air Force has requisitioned Digby Manor, the stately home of Sir Michael Waterford (John Wood), to use as a burn treatment center under the administration of the unorthodox Dr. Jamieson (Bill Paterson). Dr. Brian Wrenn (Jonathan Slinger), a surgeon at the center, has become frustrated by a rash of petty accidents that appear to be sabotage. Meanwhile, DCS Foyle's son Andrew (Juilan Ovenden), an RAF Spitfire pilot, is showing signs of battle fatigue from constant sorties and sleep deprivation, exacerbated by an incompetent mechanic, Gordon Drake (Shaun Dooley). Violent and predatory, Drake makes enemies left and right. So it's no great surprise when he's found dead. In Foyle's words, ""It seems half of Hastings decided to do away with him at much the same time.""

""They Fought in the Fields"" refers to the volunteers of the Women's Land Army, who kept Great Britain in meat and potatoes throughout the war in exchange for a pittance wages. Two Germans airmen bail out of their plane as it crashes in the English countryside and are picked up by Detective Foyle and Sergeant Milner. On the nearby Jackson farm, Rose (Paula Jennings) and Joan (Jenny Platt) of the Women's Land Army assist elderly Mr. Hugh Jackson (Nigel Terry), while their outspoken tenant, pole selector Barbara Hicks (Stella Gonet), takes a dim view of men. Mr. Jackson is found murdered in his home, and another German parachutist is found dangling from a tree. Sam joins Rose and Joan on the farm in search of clues to Jackson's murder. And Foyle suspects something is going on between those 3 Germans at the POW camp where they have been incarcerated.

In ""A War of Nerves"", Foyle's undercover investigation into stolen black market supplies is interrupted when Assistant Commissioner Rose (Corin Redgrave) insists that he investigate left-wing activist Raymond Carter (Peter Capaldi), who has come to town for a meeting of ""The People's Convention"". Unexploded German bombs are falling all over. When Captain Hammond (Dugald Bruce-Lockhart), Jack Archer (Samuel Oatley), and Ernest Jones (Fergus O'Donnell) of the bomb disposal unit enter an abandoned machine shop at Talbot's ship yard to diffuse one of them, they find a stash of cash and decide to keep it. But Earnest is abducted, Commissioner Rose is putting pressure on everyone everywhere to incriminate Raymond Carter, and all roads seem to lead to the shipyard and its owners, the brothers Talbot (David Westhead & Matthew Flynn).",1130976000,44,5258,5.1582649472450175
2397571,5,B000AYELA6,"&#65279;Series 3 of the excellent series Foyle's war was first telecast in the U.S. on PBS on 11, 18, 25 Sep. and 3 Oct. 2005 and was released on DVD on 1 Nov. 2005. However, watching the DVDs of all series is preferable if one wants to see the unexpurgated episodes. Here are the first telecast dates for series 1-4 of Foyle's war:
  series 1: telecast UK Oct.-Nov. 2002, US in Feb. 2003 (on Masterpiece theater, with Russell Baker introducing)
  series 2: telecast UK Nov.-Dec. 2003, US in July-Aug. 2004 (on Mystery)
  series 3: telecast UK Oct.-Nov. 2004, US in Sep.-Oct. 2005 (on Mystery)
  series 4: was filmed in spring 2005 and will be telecast in 2006
The PBS broadcasts in the US are edited for a 90-minute period, which includes the Mystery (or Masterpiece theater) opening-closing sequences, between-program promos, etc. This means that each episode is really only 85 minutes long at best. Region 1 DVDs (U.S., Canada), in contrast, are about 100 minutes per episode, as are the region 2 DVDs (Europe--see www.amazon.co.uk): specific values for the 4 episodes on series 2 are (for region 1) 98.5, 97.9, 98.3, 98.3 minutes. Thus in the U.S. for the proper, more nuanced episode watching Foyle's war on DVD is essential and preferable to viewing it on PBS.

Note: In a 28 Sep. 2004 interview with creator-writer Anthony Horowitz, he was asked: ""Do you realise that the show is edited to pieces when it's shown on Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in the states?"" Horowitz replied: ""Yes we're very sorry about that. It's not something I'd choose to do. It's American networking. I'd advise all American fans to get their hands on the English DVDs to see them in full."" I note here that American fans need only get the *American* DVDs to see the episodes in full. Also, if you first watch the shortened PBS telecast, you may later wonder about some lengthier scenes when you watch the DVDs.",1126137600,196,1898,4.762195121951219

2397689,5,B000AYELA6,"This series went from 10/10 to 11/10.  I cannot really fathom what just happened, it should be impossible to exceed the level of brilliance from season 2 (or series 2 for those UK folks).  But the show I didn't think could be improved upon just raised the bar.

It seems there is a bit more nuanced cinematography, which helps with the show tremendously.  It's subtle, but it seems like there is more experience behind staging and shooting as well as the angles and close ups.  Perhaps the budget increased with this season and they got some more talent?

Acting has also gone from great to magnificent.  Micheal Kitchen is so dry yet believable in his modern (1940s) Sherlock Holmes style.  I love it when he pauses with his 'ummmmm', you know when he does that he's not buying what the other person is saying!  The main cast has also improved from Honeysuckle (yes, that's her name) to Anthony to Julian.  They are all terrific.  No longer is Foyle's son annoying, but he's suddenly human and the viewer starts to have compassion for him.

The series is set during WW2, and while the special effects shots of the bombings and such aren't much to look at, the crew has paid particular attention to every other detail.  This is history.  Even if you aren't too terribly interested in Foyle's cases, the effects of the war on the people in Hastings and beyond are believable and well portrayed with good accuracy.  I find myself fact checking quite often and the crew gets it right every time.

Foyle is like a WW2 Sherlock Holmes, and when he solves cases, the episode is usually over.  We often see him present some circumstantial evidence to the culprit and they confess.  But it works.  By that revelation, we are done with our viewing.  It's not Law and Order where the viewer follows the trial and verdict.  To wrap up the episode we just get the ""Yes I did it!"" effect.  And episodes are about 1 hour 40 minutes long, so each is like a movie in itself.

Along with Downton Abbey, this is one of the best British drama series I have seen in recent years.  It is free to watch for Amazon Prime subscribers.  I actually get the discs from my local library since it's more convenient.  But whatever you do, you should be watching this series.",1355961600,,2244,4.533665835411472
2397690,3,B000AYELA6,"On the last episode of this season I got bored of the formula. There is almost always a hidden family relationship in all of these mysteries with the smug policeman there to betray his icy demeanor as he sticks it to the bad guys. I mean really this paints such a picture of the incorruptible loner that is beset on all sides, hogwash.  Also it's hard to believe the bad guys would just own up to their crimes outright, were there no lawyers or law courts at all back then? It makes me glad to be in the time I am now, at least the police need something more firm than intimidation and innuendo and cannot just arrest people without the review of either a court or direct red handedness. Foyles War is apt: it's really a silent war with himself we are seeing.

Foyle is not a convincing character as a gumshoe either he fits the bill of a patrolman or prison guard to me, wooden. I do like the central premise of this series ,crime happens and needs to be dealt with in a time of war. It's what keeps this series going really. Without it it would be so much more bland. I hope it ends for good sometime, I need to try a different way to fall asleep at night rather than watching this. I'm done with Foyle and his war.",1343347200,,1217,4.174468085106383

2397694,5,B000AYELA6,"I really can't add anything useful to these fine recommendations.  It is a wonderful series and highly worth owning. However, I have noted a few dismayed remarks regarding the so-called ""closed captioning"" problems. I could not get my captions on either and finally researched this thorny problem. The Acorn Media people said the captioning needs to be set on the TV as there is nothing on the discs themselves to allow access. I also came across the statement that if you are using a HDMI cable then you can not access the closed caption feature. Try using the standard cable and see what happens. Fortunately this problem is solved on the series 6 set. They have menu selected subtitles.  Let's hope for more of this fine series. And shame on American television! I am tired of ""reality"" shows and CSI ad nauseum.

2397739,3,B000AYELA6,"The series seems to be losing its focus on the mysteries and seems to be developing more as a historical show that happens to feature a detective.  The attention to detail (as far as the mysteries are concerned - overall the attention to historical detail is very well-done) and the creativity of the plots are slipping, being replaced with more 'humanistic' stories.  It's more about the characters and less about the plot at this point.  Which is fine if you enjoy that sort of thing, but hard-core mystery fans will be disappointed.

The French Drop - Admittedly this episode felt forced, an excuse to show how Foyle is still trying to get more involved in the war effort and, through no fault of his own - in fact, because of his sense of duty! - gets relegated to the police once again.  I wonder about the end of this episode and the choice that Foyle makes, but the mystery itself was well-done.

Enemy Fire - A little over-done in the lesson department, otherwise a good solid episode.  I think it would have been much better off without the personal involvement of Foyle's son and more of his issues, as well as the over-dramatic Milner bit, but it was still decent.  The supporting cast of characters was brilliant and alone are worth watching for.  The connections made to solve the murder are, perhaps, a bit far-fetched but work out.  The unrealistic resolution to Foyle's son's dilemma is disappointing.

They Fought in the Fields - This episode ended with a whimper - the whole set-up was pretty well-done, with the mystery surrounding the downed German planes, but it just didn't add up to much.  In the end, everything seemed so very boring and uninspired.  The girls on the farm were stereotypical and irritating.  Sam was overly melodramatic and predictable.  Rose was... everything annoying in a stereotypical character.  The bits of the plot that weren't far-fetched were too predictable.

A War of Nerves - This episode was a bit confusing in its complexity.  I can't say too much without giving away the plot, but there were multiple storylines that intersected... sort of.  Sometimes one thing led to another, but other times that same thing led to something completely different.  I still feel some parts of it are a little unresolved.  And don't even get me started on the wholly unsatisfactory ending!",1213574400,4,2328,4.798994974874372

Two series of Foyle's War have run in Australia on the ABC, I would think 4 episodes would be around 1/3 of a series.

8080789,4,B000AYELA6,"The long-running and critically acclaimed ""Foyle's War,"" written and created by Anthony Horowitz, is built on a winning premise. During World War II, a time when most of Britain was banding together to fight the Germans, unscrupulous members of society were using the upheaval and confusion to hide their criminal activity. It was up to a committed but largely unappreciated police force to keep law and order.

Detective Chief Superintendent Christopher Foyle (Michael Kitchen) is one such individual, working in Hastings, Sussex with wounded soldier Paul Milner (Anthony Howell) as his sergeant and Samantha Stewart (Honeysuckle Weeks) as his driver. Most seasons are four episodes long, each one running at just over ninety minutes.

It's clearly a very expensive show to produce, especially in regards to the authentic detail of the costumes, locations, vehicles and wartime props. Horowitz clearly did his research on the period, and wartime events are incorporated into the plots  either as background details or basis of the narrative.

In ""The French Drop"" a man is found dead in an abandoned bookshop, the apparent victim of a suicide. But after meeting the man's parents Foyle is not so sure, and his investigation leads him to the Special Operations Executive, where spies are taught the art of dirty warfare.

""Enemy Fire"" is just as much an examination of the human cost of war as it is a murder-mystery, with much of the investigation occurring in a burns hospital for RAF pilots, and a subplot focusing on Foyle's son Andrew struggling with combat fatigue. The murder in fact doesn't happen until over halfway through the episode, and has nothing to do with what initially calls Foyle to the hospital: reports of vandalism in the building.

""They Fought in the Fields"" is perhaps the best episode of this season, concerning a murdered farmer and the crash landing of a German plane on his land. Are the two incidents connected? It doesn't seem possible, and yet it's too great a coincidence to ignore. Sam in particular feels the land girls working on the farm may know more than they're telling, and that it all has something to do with the farmer's wife  a woman who disappeared over a decade ago.

Finally, ""A War of Nerves"" deals with the terrifying work done by bomb squads, called out to defuse unexploded bombs across the country. As with ""Enemy Fire"", there's not much of a mystery here; in fact it's pretty easy to figure out what's going on as the story unfolds, and is more interested in the toll such dangerous work has on the human psyche.

If there's an overarching theme to season three, it's that Foyle and Sam both feel the sting of feeling useless and obsolete in the face of such sacrifice and dedication from others  yet each one comes to realize the value of their own contribution to the war effort. And as ever, there are plenty of moral conundrums to ponder with each new episode. Should parents know the truth about their son's death if it means compromising an important operation? Is it okay to steal from dishonest people profiteering from the war?

There are perhaps a few indications that writer Anthony Horowitz is getting a little fatigued: first of all, the previous seasons have had one complex mystery per episode; here (with the exception of ""They Fought in the Fields"") all the episodes contain *two* fairly simple mysteries, often completely unconnected.

One other thing grates, is that Foyle goes from a diligent, trained and observant police officer to a man who has almost clairvoyant abilities when it comes to solving crimes. This is exacerbated by the fact that in three of the four episodes he's set against a stuffy and obstructive superior, who needs to be taken down a peg by the time the credits roll. It can be tempting to turn your detective into a superhero (Sherlock immediately springs to mind) but Foyle worked better when he was largely overlooked and unappreciated.

Yet for all of that, ""Foyle's War"" is still excellent television. Michael Kitchen is fantastic as the calm, stoic and methodical detective, as is Howell as a man struggling to reclaim his life despite a debilitating injury and Weeks's portrayal of a nave but enthusiastic young volunteer. Julian Ovenden reappears as Foyle's grown son Andrew, and Ellie Haddington as the enigmatic Mrs Pierce.

It's a great WWII drama, one that remains concerned with the goings-on of ordinary people and the moral uncertainties of the period, painting a vivid portrait of a particular time and place, as well as the everyday heroes who fought to keep the home fires burning.",1478304000,,4598,4.923772609819121
8080790,5,B000AYELA6,"The quality of the ongoing series is amazingly well-maintained, and that must be a tribute to the continuing actors, especially of course, Michael Kitchen, who, as the series goes on, seems to do more and more with less and less.  This is more than understated British acting. Foyle continues to convince, as a man of deep feeling and empathy, deep moral seriousness, and unwavering patriotism, and all without coming across as a blimp or a prig.  It's simply one of the great TV characterizations.  Even when the plot structures get a bit baroque (no spoilers here!), Foyle unerringly gets at what's at stake.  I also like that as the series goes on, it is acquiring a kind of documentary dimension, to the extent that we are more and more reminded of how British civil society and the economy had to reorient itself in wartime, and how that reorientation made possible new opportunities for corruption as well as for heroism. We see how women entered the workforce, not just as nurses but as agricultural workers.  We see how the intelligence services tend to mess things up for the local police, and there's a tense story that combines the issue of unexploded bombs with industrial black book-keeping.  Anthony Howell as Milner and Honeysuckle Weeks as Samantha continue to shine.  Milner's character especially seems to be developing interestingly.  Great stuff.  I'm hooked for Season 4.",1476662400,,1392,4.9655172413793105

8080792,5,B000AYELA6,"Have enjoyed the cast of Foyle's War, as the story lines are very real and make you realize how awful war can be. The characters in each story are plucky, and honest portrayals of the home front and the other side. We forget people are people even the enemy has a life and is just trying to get through the war. The series shows the hysteria , the fear, the worry, and how many came home from the war. We forget war has it's casalties, and sometimes the ones who come home are still injured in mind and spirit.",1454544000,,510,4.161616161616162
