647196,2,630344265X,"EVER!!! first of all, Crockett didn't wear a cowboy hat. he wore a conskin hat and fought till the end with his rifle. in this movie, Crockett has a knife. 2nd of all, they use the same battle scenes over and over. they aren't even original. they took the charge scene from the 1959 Alamo movie, The Last Command! and if you look closely at Travis, he kills the guy the same way about 3 times. this movie is just plain horrible! i only give it 2 stars because it's about the alamo. but don't waste your time on this movie. it's horrible! you want a good Alamo movie, watch John Wayne's ""The Alamo"" or go to the IMAX theatre and watch, Alamo: The Price of Freedom.",1014854400,4,663,4.228346456692913
647197,4,630344265X,"I love this film, particularly gorgeous Alec Baldwin playing gorgeous Will Travis (one of my all time favourite heroes) although I do think Alec's Travis is a 'bit too nice'.  Will himself, although a handsome, red haired, dashing man, was a rake and a scoundrel with a reputed bad temper, none of which is evident in this portrayal of him. I found the film a very good adaptation of Lon Tinkle's book, which I also own and thoroughly enjoyed.  James Arness as Bowie and Brian Keith as Davey Crockett are also well cast - far superior to the gross miscasting of these two important figures in the original Alamo film of 1960.  Action sequences are great and the film is a basically factual representation - although I have not in all my reading on this subject, been able to discover a British officer serving with Santa Anna as did ""Colonel Black"" in this film.  Travis' death (as usual in movies) is also incorrectly portrayed; I don't think he wore a uniform either (the Laurence Harvey portrayal of Travis in the 1960 version is probably more accurate here).  I'd love to see a film of the life of Travis either - pity Mr Baldwin is getting a bit old for the role as he really is very good in this film.  I'd recommend the film to anyone with a love of American, particularly Texas history.  And yes, I'd love to see a film version of Stephen Harrigan's ""Gates of the Alamo"".",995500800,4,1379,4.492
647198,5,630344265X,"To be honest, I can very well say that this was my favorite movie, as a matter of fact today I have already owned it for 5 years. Although this movie was based upon one of the bloodiest battles of history, it has very little blood which makes it a good movie for young children, but does have a lot of action and adventure.  What's good about this movie is that most of the charectors are based on true people, which in my opinion is great.  Now I am not saying that this movie does nothave weakness's because it does.  In some scenes it gives mexico a very bad name.  As I am told hispanic children are tought to think thatmexicans are bad people, which is not true.  For parents, and Children I urge you to get this movie,  It's scenes are unforgetable, and it gives you a very warm feeling.",972777600,6,793,4.218543046357616
647199,3,630344265X,"When you're from Texas and have spent many years studying and knowing about the Alamo, it gets pretty hard to stomache some of the more historically inaccurate videos.  (i.e. the John Wayne version, et al.) They  simply don't sit right with you. The TV version of the Alamo we have here  isn't the best movie ever made. Nor is it the worst. Far from it in fact.  This version manages to get rough historical facts in order. The siege  lasts the right number of days, the attack happens at the right time, Wm.  Travis isn't a 50 year old man, D. Crockett isn't Fess Parker. Seeing as  how so much of the Alamo legend is, in fact, myth, demanding that a film  remain true to hard fact is ludicrous.  Sure, parts are embellished. Parts  are skipped over. Sometimes it's overly sentimental, but hey--we're talking  about a pretty sentimental subject in the eyes of some. It's not perfect,  but it's sure a step up from what we're used to. And until someone gets  together and makes Steven Harrigan's new novel into a movie, I think it's  probably my best bet for a ""pretty good movie about the Alamo"".  If you're an Alamo buff, I'd certainly suggest you see it. It's well cast  and weaves a pretty good emotional plotline, including a lot of points from  Travis' supposed life. Alec Baldwin does very well in the role, as do the  rest of the major supporting cast. If you're not an Alamo buff, then you're  probably not reading this review anyhow. I say we all probably take what we  can get, and this certainly could be a whole heck of a lot worse.",964137600,27,1545,4.45
647200,2,630344265X,"This movie was a made for TV film to help celebrate the 150th anniversity of Texas' Independence.  It is more factual than the other Alamo movies but it is too drawn out at times and still failed to get all of the facts  straight.  For its length, the characters are not developed too well.  Another problem is that the Hispanic soldiers at the Alamo are not  represented well.  There were many Tejano soldiers at the battle yet Juan  Seguin and Gregorio Esparza are the only two with much screen time.  The  final battle sequence was not too bad but if you look close enough, there  are too many single shot guns being fired more than once without them being  reloaded. The movie could have been better considering some of the talent  found in the film.",961113600,6,754,4.503703703703704
647201,4,630344265X,"The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory is a significantly better representation of the historic battle than its better known namesake.  The production values are quite good, considering that a substantial amount of the  fighting during the siege, including the climactic final attack, were at  night, a fact accurately depicted in this film.
There is still a good  deal of cliched heroism of dubious accuracy, and the acting is little more  than mediocre, but the producers and the director allow the event to be the  star of the show, minimizing the effect of these shortcomings.
Somewhat  understated in tone and a bit slow to develop, the movie's seeming early  weakness becomes its greatest strength as the events slowly build to their  finale.  The final battle is brilliantly filmed, using a variety of camera  angles, quick cut-aways, and the blinding flashes of gunfire in the  pre-dawn darkness to give the viewer a sense of the confusion and terror  the befell the defenders during the terrifying attack.
Thirteen Days to  Glory may not be Academy Award material, but it is a very noteworthy  attempt to accurately portray the events at the Alamo as they actually  happened.  The result is a fine mix of valid history and entertaining  filmmaking.  Recommended for anyone interested in this stirring saga of  Texican history.",946857600,13,1330,5.069444444444445
7847263,4,630344265X,I have all of the Alamo movies and I had this one on TV many years ago.  Just wanted it to add to my collection.  Since I bought this one a long time ago I have replaced it with a DVD.,1433116800,,184,3.4634146341463414

7847265,4,630344265X,I was impressed with the movie based on the story of the Alamo. It was one of those stories based on adventure and fighting for a particular way of life. There is a contest of wills and there is finally a showdown that has the most spectacular battle scenes that are just breathtaking and daring. If you like a hero or a villain this movie has all of those elements and it will leave you wanting more and expecting a final victory from our brave heroes.,1284249600,,453,4.27906976744186
7847266,4,630344265X,"A mini-series based on the book of the same title, this television rendition of the battle of the Alamo is not super high in production costs but well done none-the-less.  Don't look too closely at the exterior walls of the Alamo as the Mexican Army begins it's assault or you will notice that they change from scene to scene.  This is because a few battle scenes from ""The Last Command"" have been added.

Fun to watch and still inspiring.",1267142400,,439,4.531645569620253

7847270,4,630344265X,"Yes, this has faults, many glaring. But it was created for the Texas Sesquicentennial celebration and was aired during the time of year of the battle (if I remember correctly). It was made to be entertaining and appeal to the young people (Alex Baldwin; the young lovers-the girl was played by a former Miss Texas, I think; the marvelous Raul Julia, who practically stole the show), who have to study Texas history twice before they graduate there. As a fifth-generation native Texan (currently exiled in Georgia) I love the Alamo story and its various conflicting legends, understanding that because of the veil of history and the way that Santa Ana tried to obliterate the battle site we may never know the entire truth of the matter. What we can know are certain specifics. The actors portraying Bowie and Crockett were too old for the roles (characters aged 40 and 50, respectively) although they were old favorites of mine. One easily verified mistake both in this version and the John Wayne version is the age of the baby. She was too old in the JW version and too young in this one. Only in the Alamo IMAX version have I seen the child the correct age. I wish THAT version was available for purchase, as I would like to see it again and compare details. All in all, it is more historical than the Wayne version, which in one glaring clunker of a scene inverted the order of Alamo and Goliad--I suppose to give Wayne's son an extra line. If you want history, get a documentary. If you want something to show the spirit of the Alamo legend, try this--if you can find it.",1203897600,,1575,4.568904593639576
7847271,4,630344265X,"james arness is jim bowie,brian keith is davy crockett,alec baldwin is will travis,and in a move that most films about the alamo never do the late raul julia is santa anna.much smaller in scale than the movies,and useing footage from the film ""the lost command"",this is more about the effect of the seige than just the battle. it is a little slow ,but as the title says it lasted 13 days,and really i found it quite good. one draw back and the reason for only 4 instead of 5 stars is the over use of stock footage and the reuseing of some of the same footage over and over again,travis kills the same soldier at least 3 times and it is clear that it's just the same shot used again.

  with just that one little problem i have to say that this is a fine film and i do recommend it.",1145577600,,781,4.158940397350993
7847272,5,630344265X,"This is the most accurate version of the events of the Battle of the Alamo.  A TV Miniseries can go into far more detail than a feature film and this show is very detailed down to the finest historic points of interest.  I have done extensive research on this event and this movie does not overly embellish the facts that were gleaned from several recorded ""eye witness"" accounts.  Without being ""too Hollywood"" the interesting and tragic story is presented intelligently with a minimum of historical ""docudrama"" inaccuracies.  We are given a chance to feel along with these heroes their final moments.  Although we can only speculate the words that were spoken, this film presents a truly moving tribute to these brave, doomed men.",1023667200,5,732,4.91869918699187
