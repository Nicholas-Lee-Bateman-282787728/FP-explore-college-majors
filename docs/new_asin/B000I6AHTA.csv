2653382,5,B000I6AHTA,"It's perfect!  I like that the basic workout is simple and short for those times when I'm on the run and is great for a ""crunchtime"" workout. I am especially pleased that it has so many modifications further on in the program.

I really appreciated the demo models (who are working bellydancers) - I always get demoralized when I get a tape that has these rippling, 21 year olds who look like they don't have an ounce of fat on them and never have.  It was important for me to see a realistic presentation of what I can expect from following the program.

The insert is fabulous - I enjoyed reading about each dancer and what they've gained from the program.  It's also handy to take with you if you're going to be on the road and do not have access to the DVD.

I've been doing the basic workout for about 2 weeks and have been rewarded with more definition in my mid-section, my backbends are becoming easier (because my abs are stronger) and my belly rolls are much more visible!  I'm looking forward to seeing how it's affected my dancing in a couple of months.

Nit-picks:

1. The soothing voice-over.  At one point Gerson leads an exercise.  I'd prefer his voice instead of the lovely, even-toned voice over. I like the commanding tone of personal trainers ;-) But that's a personal preference.

2. When I play the DVD in my computer, the sound is warbly.  Plays fine in my DVD player.  It's probably my computer.

Summary:  You don't have to be a dancer to benefit from this workout, if your abs are 'less than perfect' in any way, then buy this DVD - you won't regret it!",1161561600,17,1579,4.411764705882353
2653383,5,B000I6AHTA,"I am Amustela - one of the three dancers featured in ""Core Training for Belly Dancers"".  I wanted to share that in preparing for the video we rehearsed the workout and did the workout at home intensely for about three months.  I continued to do the workout at home after the shoot until I had abdominal surgery.  My doctors were amazed at the speed of my recovery - especially of my lower abdominal muscles, and surmised that it was due to the fitness of my abdominal muscles.  I cannot guarantee that this workout speeds surgical recovery,  but it certainly seemed to do that for me.",1160438400,16,584,4.523809523809524
2653384,5,B000I6AHTA,"A physical trainer, the ""Fitness Pharaoh"" on the cover, over years developed a core training workout specifically for bellydancers, and describes it on this DVD.  There is a little diagram of the associated muscle groups before each section of the part that shows how each move should be done.  The background music (by Desert Wind) and the pyramid-desert at sunset theme could have been hokey if it weren't so beautiful and expertly done.  Three real dancers, not models, with very different ages and physiques are used in the demos, and they each do a short bellydance segment at the end.

I followed the recommended workout regime, and this has resulted in a difference in my midsection people can actually see, and some have commented on it.  It took months, but I am still seeing changes I like.  A few of the moves are challenging at first, but I was pleased that I could eventually increase the reps to mark progress.",1159747200,7,924,4.74375
8144221,3,B000I6AHTA,"2yrs husband has had lower back issues?  docs give us the total run around with no answers.  trying everything in the book to relieve, ease, or rid the problem.  he can do these work outs pretty easly.  prob got a month and a half left to see if its working?  they say you she notice results in 3 months",1366156800,2,303,4.067796610169491
8144222,4,B000I6AHTA,"I bought this DVD based on someone else recommending it for people who suffer low back pain.  I have issues with my sacroiliac joints, which causes lower back pain.  I can't really do any exercise without causing intense pain.  After having my son six months ago, my back pain got even worse.  My osteopath recommended doing some ab exercises as a weak core can contribute to my issues.  Well, I have only done this DVD twice, but I can say that not only has it not caused me more pain, I have felt better these past few days than I have in months!  Yes, it could be a coincidence, but I am at least pleased to have something I can do that doesn't cause me more pain.  I haven't done any ab work in five years and I can keep up with the basic ab workout well and only have a slight soreness in my abs that lets you know its working without overdoing it!  It's worth a shot for those who can't do much exercise.",1360800000,9,910,4.130681818181818
8144223,5,B000I6AHTA,"Gerson Kuhr (aka ""The Fitness Pharaoh"") has produced an excellent ""core training"" DVD, using dancers who are highly respected in this area as his ""fitness models."" Amustela, Nimeera, and (the late) Aliya are excellent ""real-world"" demonstrators, as they all have (or have had) demanding day jobs, a taxing performance/teaching schedule, and their own dance practices to keep up! They have each worked with Gerson over the years - and they have each credited training with Gerson as being a big factor in their strength and stamina.

As a dance teacher, I've used Gerson's ""Core Training"" DVD as part of the ""tools"" that I recommend for each student who comes to my studio. Each of us needs strong core muscles, and Gerson's DVD is one of the best that I've ever seen for this purpose!

I love that Gerson divides the exercises and explanations to address each of the four core abdominal muscles, as well as stretching, strengthening, and toning the lower back area. The exercises are well-done, effectively presented, and it is easy to work out with this DVD.

Once a person has assimilated and mastered each of these exercises, it is easy to integrate them into a more spontaneous and free-flowing workout regime. However, this DVD is an excellent reminder of the ""complete set,"" and is a great way in which to introduce (or re-introduce) a well-structured at-home workout practice, which will certainly yield greater strength, stamina, improved posture, and a more alert and relaxed carriage. A great purchase for our own library, and a great gift!

8144224,4,B000I6AHTA,"Being a belly dancer in the Washington DC area, I have heard about Gerson's work with other dancers in the area. When I saw that he had a DVD for core training, I decided to give it a go. Even though I have pretty strong core muscles, I've found that after 2.5 years of belly dance study, I still struggle with belly rolls and precise stomach isolations and figured that more intensive training of the muscles would be beneficial.

The production value of the DVD is good in quality. Aesthetically, it may not be your cup of tea. I honestly found the soundtrack (most of which I could only term as bland Egyptian ""elevator music""), the set dressing (a faux desert-and-pyramids scene), and the styling of the participants (costumes, etc) really goofy.

If you're able to put that behind you and take it with both a grain of salt and a sense of humor, you'll be privy to a really solid core routine that is thoughtful, effective, surprisingly fast, and well-explained (almost OVER-explained). It targets all areas of the core including the lower back, and Gerson (silly Halloween costume ""pharaoh"" drag aside) explains for the viewer why the strengthening of these individual areas will assist with your dancing.

He sets a realistic standard when he says that you should see an overt difference within about 3 months. You may indeed see toning and slimming of your abdominal area as you continue to use it, but that should be anticipated as a possible pleasant by-product. The strength you're building should be the intended focus.

I would most certainly suggest it as a tool for dancers to incorporate in their routine several times a week, as doing either the basic or advanced workout doesn't take terribly long and would probably be easy for most people to fit into their schedules.",1313280000,13,1786,4.788961038961039
8144225,5,B000I6AHTA,"I have never had tight abs or a ""six pack"", & after 3 kids & hitting 40, I didn't expect much. But I needed a little intensive help with core strength because I decided to take up bellydance about a year & a half ago. I thought the price was high, but I took a chance based on good reviews. I had been doing the Rodney Yee yoga for abs for about a month along with basic bellydance DVDs. I have to say that this is the most focused, streamlined, and rapidly effective abs workout I have ever done. I mean I noticed within a week the difference. It is quick to do, not boring, easy to remember (although the portable reference card is a nice touch). You can actually work up a sweat with this workout. How many abs workouts do that in 15-20 minutes? Truthfully, once you've done this a few times, you won't really need the DVD to do this workout, but you do need to see the way the movements are correctly done, by real dancers with REAL (woo hoo!) bodies, first. A refresher won't hurt either.

I do this abs workout 2 or 3 times a week after my other bellydance DVDs or after class. One of my best DVD investments!",1231286400,7,1115,4.162037037037037
8144226,2,B000I6AHTA,"I was a little disappointed, I thought it would be more bellydance than just another exercise dvd.  I did like it for core training, but I already had several, so if you are looking for a core training video and don't already have one then this is great one to get.",1190851200,7,265,4.196078431372549
8144227,5,B000I6AHTA,"I wasn't sure at first whether to buy this video. I wondered whether the exercises were all that different than the usual ab work, and if one actually winds up using it frequently enough to make it worth paying $30 for a twelve-minute workout.

I eventually decided to take the risk and buy it, and I have to say, I've been extremely pleased. It doesn't give an intense burn like a 40 minute ab video, but it is very focused, the exercises are unusual enough not to be boring (though crunches are in there too), and it does give the feeling of being tighter after doing it. I also really like that he has a pelvic tilt exercise (for the transverse abdominis muscle) and two lower back exercises to balance out the ab work.

Also, while I don't do it every day, I've found that this is the one video I turn to when I want to do *something* physical that day, but am too tired/don't have enough time to do an hour or something.

The enclosed booklet has descriptions of all the exercises with photos and muscle explanations. Brilliant!

This is not a video which promises magic weight loss or a complete transformation. But it is a good little ab workout, and you're likely to do it more often than the longer, more intense videos. Little by little, that work takes its effect. I should also mention that, pharaoh outfit aside, this video would be useful for *anyone* looking to slip a little ab exercise into their schedule. None of the moves are bellydance moves -- they're just ideal for dancers who need a powerful core.",1177545600,26,1522,4.483754512635379
8144228,5,B000I6AHTA,"I've been doing these exercises several times a week and have really seen a difference in my muscle tone and flexibility.  The basic exercises are excellent to start with, and once you've mastered them, the variations provide an additional challenging workout.

I like the straightforward instructional format.  The camera angles provide a clear view of the exercises, and the booklet allows me to continue my routine away from the TV or computer -- especially useful when I'm traveling.

This is one of the most useful and well-developed exercise DVDs I've tried.  I highly recommend it, both for the beginner as well as the experienced exercise junkie.",1173312000,8,654,5.132075471698113
8144229,5,B000I6AHTA,"Finally: a simple, effective DVD that can help anyone look like a belly dancer, with a sleek, toned midriff! Core Training for Belly Dancers

targets 4 abdominal areas plus the lower back, and the dancers who have used it have really seen results.

I have known the man behind the DVD -- Gerson Kuhr, the ""Fitness Pharaoh"" -- for some time, and have seen the impressive results he gets in his role as personal trainer for several dancers in the Washington DC area. My expectations were high when I heard that he was producing a DVD, but the DVD has exceeded my expectations.

I think the beauty of the DVD is its simplicity. It's a short, easy workout that works. The DVD begins with static stretches, then moves on to lower abs, internal/external obliques, upper abs, transverse abdominus, and lower back. There are two different workout levels, plus variations. The DVD comes with an illustrated booklet that explains the whole workout (very handy for travel, if you don't have a DVD player).

This is a high-quality production, with great lighting, a well-designed set, and superior videography and editing. The exercises are illustrated very clearly by three local dancers (Amustela, Nimeera, and Aliya) whose impressive abs have been developed through working with Gerson. There  are a few whimsical touches; I especially liked the titles that undulate, letter by letter, across the screen.

This is a great DVD!",1172361600,14,1417,4.983050847457627
8144230,5,B000I6AHTA,"I began doing the basic workout two and a half months ago when I started belly dance lessons. My instructor recently complimented me on my improved posture.  I know that my abdominal muscles are stronger, too, and most of the new dance movements I am learning are now easier for me to execute. This system really works for me.

  I really like the fact that the DVD features actual belly dancers performing the stretches and not fitness models whom few people can relate. The dancers are of three different body types and appear to be in three different age groups.

  Another plus is the section on optional exercises, where I can substitute exercises in four of the five core areas.  I like variety, and the optionals allow me to vary the workout so it never gets stale or old.",1165536000,7,779,4.553956834532374
