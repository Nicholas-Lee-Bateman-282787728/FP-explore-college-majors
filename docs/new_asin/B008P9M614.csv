5177533,5,B008P9M614,House is awesome. Now I can watch the shows in order anytime I want without commercials. It's cool watching them in order to see the character interaction. Much better than random reruns.,1357689600,6,187,4.875
5177534,5,B008P9M614,"Love the House, MD series. My wife and I are lovely all the season. We are addicitive to the show. Sad part is they ended the show earlier this year.",1356566400,4,149,4.0

5177536,5,B008P9M614,"This is a present for my husband, who is a huge House fan. As it was described, it came in shrink wrap in new condition. It was delivered early, as well. I suggest this product for any of you who love House...it's a great set!",1353715200,9,226,4.044444444444444
5177537,1,B008P9M614,"Universal Studios is the one releasing this product, not Fox. I'm no defender of Fox; merely seeking to direct anger to it's proper place. It's a way to package up all the unsold previous seasons and try and sell them again.",1348617600,32,224,4.487804878048781
5177538,1,B008P9M614,"I know Fox isn't known for their amazing box sets, but this is disgraceful. House was one of the most popular television shows on air, and their effort to do it justice is to literally box all of the season sets together in the laziest, half-assed way? Its an insult to the show and to the fans who were looking forward to a big box set release with more features; something more then a new box and an episode booklet. I really hope this is not the only attempt at a box set release. Its too basic, stripped down and rushed to be its only attempt.",1348358400,64,547,4.169811320754717
5177539,1,B008P9M614,"I have waited eight years to be able to buy the complete series set. The only thing you get with it that you wouldn't get by buying them individually over the years seems to be a cool box to hold them together. Seriously?! Where are the extras that should be released with the complete series set? An extra disc or two? SOMETHING?!
LOVE the show though and will rewatch lots of the episodes but am reconsidering buy the series set like I always planned. :(",1345939200,47,456,4.376470588235295

5177545,1,B008P9M614,"We definitely like the series, but several of the discs in two seperate seasons did not play properly and we had to skip several episodes in two seasons.  The disc would start out playing fine and then stall and not resume in season 4.  And in the FINAL season, disc 4 was defective.  Pretty bad to watch all the seasons and then miss details in the final season.",1527206400,,363,4.3088235294117645

5177548,5,B008P9M614,"Im only into the first season of this box set at the time of this review and so far 5 stars. It was shipped quickly and was new in a box set. The DVD menu is good and and I cant find any reason at this point to take away a star. The picture quality in the earlier seasons is before HD I think, so be prepared for that. However, I do expect that to improve in later seasons, if it doesnt Ill post accordingly. I am a long time fan of this show and have watched the complete series at least 10 times.",1526774400,,498,3.798076923076923

5177560,1,B008P9M614,I love this show and waited a long time to order it. The first season set of discs were fine. Got to season 2 and there were 2 discs that had a scratch that made them unplayable. On season 3 and so far 2 discs from this set are scratched. These were ordered new and completely wrapped. I would assume fault if there were a hint of doubt that maybe I did do something but these were babied as with anyone who truly loves House. Very disappointed that I paid for this and I have missed major parts in the story line.,1524960000,,514,4.049019607843137
5177561,5,B008P9M614,"House Complete Collection

Gregory House MD is a modern version of Sherlock Holmes, a character who is shown to be most observant and knowledgeable than his co-workers. The camera is the Dr. Watson to record the events. The location is the Princeton Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey. Everybody lies is his slogan. House acts and does what he wishes (as if he owned the business). Would his temper tantrums fly in the real world? Would his pill popping also be acceptable? [A nurse once told me she hated this show because it was so false to what she saw in her workplace. I told her Hollywood makes drama and entertainment, fictional reality.] This show has a very high amount of drama and personal conflicts. Is that its attraction? There is a recurring plot. A patient arrives at a hospital. There are conflicts about the diagnosis. Finally Dr. House correctly diagnoses the problem and the cure.

Watching this show is not a substitute for seeing a doctor for any problem. The important lesson here is that a problem cannot be solved until it is correctly diagnosed. Think of that when you read opinions in the newspapers or hear opinions on the radio or television. Do they really know what they're talking about? Or are they just putting out lies or half-truths to promote an agenda that they are being paid to do? How many people die yearly from a mistake in their prescriptions? How many people die each year from a doctors mistake? [These figures are not readily available.] For comparison there are about 31,000 deaths each year in 1994 from firearms in this country (about 1 in 10,000). Before the 1968 Federal Gun Control Law this figure was only half. Motor vehicle deaths are much higher (there are more of them in use every day). The actual rate is more informative than a simple count.
This Complete Collection has all 8 Seasons with 177 episodes. Dr. Kildare by Max Brand must be the original story about hospital drama. Andrew Holtz wrote a book about The Medical Science of House MD but this referenced the first two seasons.",1524873600,,2053,4.731843575418995
5177562,3,B008P9M614,"Everything is in fantastic condition. The only caviat is that each season is missing a CD, and replaced instead with a duplicate. Season 1 has two disc 4's, Season 2 has two disc 3's. Honestly a very mean move if it was intentional. The series is Five Stars, but I have to give this purchase Three Stars because it cheated me out of the proper full seasons with this bullcrap.",1524700800,,376,4.385714285714286

5177607,4,B008P9M614,"You know, actually the version of this set which is plain white with the show logo may have more ""artistic value"", but this version does have that cool shot with House playing a Gibson ""Flying-V"" guitar. As I recall, there was an episode with a scene that opened with him playing it. The only personal experience I've had with a ""rockin' doc"" was when I had a dentist who was a Clapton devotee. I'd met him while working as a sound man for his band.

Maybe it sounds silly, but I've always felt that although the British Invasion in rock got a lot of us imitating some of the stars' accents, none of us could have gone over there and fooled real Brits. So I figured it was the same in the other direction, so I was surprised when I saw Hugh Laurie on a talk show and, holy cow, he's a Brit. Because he does an American accent so well. The last English actor I saw do that was Jane Seymour on ""Dr. Quinn"", and she came across as a Bostonian.

Anyway, ""Anonymous"" did warn us that a guide to episode titles is not provided. I guess that depends on which version you get. These reviews seem to be a combination of reviews from both versions. The one I'm holding is the version Universal put out in 2012, ASIN # B008P9M614. That's the one with a lot of pictures on the box as I mention above. The one ""Anonymous"" had grief with must be the other one with a lot of white space on the box. You get a pretty good list of which episode is on which disk on the inner cover--front and rear--of each season box. You just have to take out the disc that blocks the view. Either that or temporarily slip out the paper cover insert. But there's no list on the actual discs themselves. AND there's that booklet that has a list, but no mention of which disc has which episode--just which season it's in.",1517875200,6,1786,4.234604105571847

So what does that mean?  Well, its got full 16x9, 1080P episodes that look beautiful and play perfectly on my system here in the USA.  The only thing you're going to notice is that the opening credits song is different.

5177628,4,B008P9M614,Nothing wrong visually with the Blu-ray set but they have changed the intro music on all the episodes. What used to be the intro to Teardrop (by Massive Attack) is now the end of Teardrop. It's not a big issue but I always looked forward to the intro scene with that music. Never really favored the end theme and not sure why they went to the trouble to change it. Not a deal breaker overall but enough for me to drop this to a 4.,1513555200,6,430,4.070588235294117

I can't speak for other versions, but the version I have has the theme song just as I have always seen it. My two theories as to the confusion about the theme song are, 1) Maybe some versions (from the UK, maybe) actually do not have the regular theme song, or  2) The theme song doesn't actually appear until the 2nd or 3rd episode, which I remember from watching the show a lot over the last few years, so maybe somebody watched the first episode and wondered why the normal theme song wasn't there and left a bad review. I, for one, would have been unhappy with anything other than ""Teardrop"", and I was willing to buy the DVD box set just to get the real theme song.

Instead, I'll reassure those that are thinking of purchasing these, especially those from the US, these truly are region-free. I was a bit worried, myself. But, they work perfectly on my nearly 6 year old player.

Lastly, I purchased my set from megahitrecords, who have 100% positive reviews. If you have a Blu Ray player, don't waste your money on the DVD set. When for approximately the same price, you can own the 1080p Blu Ray set. Which looks amazing on my 55"" 1080p tv. Hope this helps.",1494460800,7,895,4.559006211180124

None the less when your DVD player is not allowing it to play, then it's a lesson learned on( buy your country's region and don't mess around""",1493683200,2,275,4.2075471698113205
5177718,5,B008P9M614,"This documentary-style Medical Drama solves the big problem with ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Private Practice"" The problem of TOO MUCH SEX! I'm more interested in leaning about Medicine than I am in your sex life. Thus shows from ""Discovery Life"" are better. While it might be helpful to address why shows starting female doctors revolve around sex, I LOVE that ""House M.D."" can star a brilliant male doctor, because if that's what it takes to NOT talk about sex I'm all for it. House's two romantic relationships end. The writers have the common sense to take both of those females off the show, one of those relationships most likely lead to the shows cancelation. The show reminds me of a Crime Drama because of how much focus the put on the Mystery illness of House's patient. There is a lot less focus on character development, so when House's staff gets switched out, you feel nothing. When the series was nearing it's end, they developed the character of one of House's staff, why they didn't develop the one with the terminal illness is beyond me, because it would kept the focus on Medicine. There were only two episodes without cases, and that constituents a bad episode. I wish they would have ended the series with one final case, and the death of Wilson from cancer, because that's a really good reason to quit being a doctor, you couldn't save your best friend. Despite his horrible bedside manner House really does care about his patients, because most of them survive. If House can't save you, who can?",1493337600,,1512,4.731060606060606

5177764,4,B008P9M614,"I was never really a fan of Hospital shows, but it seems like I've watched them all over the years. As a kid my mom loved ""St. Elsewhere"" (and to this day I think I'm the only person that enjoyed that final episode) and like most kids of the 80's, what the folks wanted to watch, is what we watched. My wife loves these shows, and was there for episode one of ""ER"" and continues to tune in today to whatever hospital shows premiere; ""Code Black"", ""Chicago Med"", ""Grey's Anatomy"" even things like ""Call the Midwife"" keep her glued to the tube.

I prefer watching movies or old episodes of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000""?

Somehow, everyone that I know that loves these hospital shows missed out on ""House""? Why? I have no idea, but it was just a show that flew under the radar for them. When I began working from home, I wanted something that would play in the background, and after running through all of the ""Star Trek"" series' and ""Lost in Space"", I decided to pop on ""House"", and fell in love with the show.

If you're not familiar with ""House"", think of the show this way: Dr. House is equal to a medical version of Sherlock Holmes. Instead of trying to solve a crime, House tries to diagnose a rare disease in each episode. As a bonus, he's a complete ass to his patients and co-workers, saying things to the people around him that we only wish we could say and get away with. The dark humor, the sarcasm, and the supporting cast (which rotates and changes through the years) makes for compelling and entertaining TV.

While I feel that the show runs about 1-2 seasons too long, even the lesser quality episodes are worth a watch. If you are fan of any of the new Sherlock Holmes based shows; ""Sherlock"" or ""Elementary"", then give this show a try.",1470700800,,1752,4.414860681114551

5177781,4,B008P9M614,"I just binge-watched all 8 seasons in a concentrated period. I think Hugh Laurie is absolutely amazing as the disturbed and hilarious Dr. House and Sean Robert Penn as Dr. Wilson is a superb foil for his antics. Their relationship is as clever as anything you've ever seen in movies or other tv. The other recurring characters are rather tiresome after awhile especially Lisa Edelstein as Dr. Cuddy, whose acting involves rolling her eyes and biting her lower lip. ....for 7 seasons.  The ""romance"" between them is a joke and no sane woman would put up with him. Peter Jacobson as one of House's team flunkies does manage to exude more substance than the other actors.  The series formula wears thin with a weekly medical dilemma which House and team ALWAYS solve after throwing out boring medical terminology.  House is completely unbelievable because no medical professional could ever keep a job behaving as insanely as House does. Apparently he is a combination of a sociopath and Asperger's . He is without redeeming qualities except for his brilliant diagnostic skills.  Very, very rarely, the writers give him a glimmer of humanity, but in general he is destructive, selfish, narcissistic, cruel and addicted to Vicodin. Nonetheless, Hugh Laurie has unlimited ability to make House endlessly interesting and gut-wrenchingly funny.  You'll learn many new diseases and need to watch another series with a cheery, kind lead character as an antidote.",1463097600,,1453,5.113924050632911

Luckily, House MD was available in the complete series and I had the opportunity to watch all the episodes in order from season 1 to season 8. I love that every episode has you guessing until the end. Hugh Laurie definitely makes House MD worth watching.

The only issues are that you have to select your language every time (may just be my old blu-ray player) out of about 10 languages (Japanese is at the top and English is the second). There are absolutely no lists of all the episodes on the boxes nor on the menus - they are all just numbers (see picture included for picture of the menu) - so you will have to look them up or print off a list from Wikipedia or something if you really want the list of episode names. The menu is very simple and has no words, but rather just symbols. The book icon is the episode list. (see menu picture)",1440720000,129,820,4.222929936305732

All seasons are here with bonus content.
These disks were originally written for overseas so they have had their DRM country code shifted or removed entirely. Their IS an English menu, voice, subtitles option. They did omit the titles of each episode from the disks though. Each one is numbered only.
 Also the packaging has a couple issues. Mine arrived with the outside box in perfect condition but the little plastic tabs inside the disk cases that hold the disk trays like pages of a book are broken. What're you going to do though? The tray still holds the disk well enough to keep it secure and unscratched so I called it good enough.",1437868800,,717,4.6015625

I think I've seen most of the episodes, except (like most long-running TV series) when it gets weak toward the end. This is one of the best TV dramas made in the past several decades. For those unfamiliar with the series, the premise is ""Sherlock Holmes in a hospital,"" with varying, and varying numbers of Watsons to House's genius. A lot of it is Hugh Laurie, but the series never would have succeeded had there not been a variety of strong supporting actors.
As far as buying DVDs is concerned, to me the series was great to watch, but I didn't think it would stand up all that well to repeat viewings, so I'm giving that a pass.",1437177600,,758,4.270833333333333

5177882,5,B008P9M614,"This review is for the DVD version of House M.D. Amazon just recently combined the DVD and Blu-ray listings into one.

This is House MD in its entirety. This uses the original intro song for almost every episode (Teardrop by Massive Attack). Picture quality is excellent and what one would expect from a TV series today. My only issue is some of the plastic bits on the cases were broken off, thus causing some to not close completely. I did not think this was worth taking a star off, however. Other than that this is more than what I paid for. I would recommend buying this if Teardrop is a big deal to you, as it is to me.

Note:
There's a Blu-ray version of this with a different box that everything comes in. That is region free, however, and thus does not use Teardrop as the introduction theme. To my knowledge, this is the only version ""House M.D.: The Complete Series"" that uses Teardrop.",1426636800,5,897,4.430303030303031

5177908,5,B008P9M614,"In terms of pros, everything is there.  Every episode in stunning 1080p and sounds great.  There really isn't much else to add in that regard, no duplicated or missing discs.  So it's exactly what you're ordering.

There are a couple of nit-picks though.  There is no episode guide in this set, even the blu-rays themselves don't have episode names when you're playing the discs, only numbers.  So you'll need to know your House episodes when looking for a specific episode.  The special features are what you'll find on the individual DVD releases, nothing new here.

Each individual season is in it's own blu-ray case stacked inside the box, the only gripe I've got is that the blu-ray cases are kinda hard to close.  They're built exactly like those older plastic VHS cases.  You have to pull the cover of the case and pinch the sides to close it, kinda like a pizza box.  It's an odd choice to go back to.  It's by no means a big deal, just worth noting.

Also, this release does not feature the Teardrop by Massive Attack theme song, only the same theme song you'll hear on the Netflix releases.

Overall - I'm happy to actually have this entire collection in High Definition on a physical media. I've watched this show a dozen times and will probably watch it a few dozen more.",1420156800,89,1283,4.5701754385964914

The House MD Series box is VERY low quality cardboard. I already returned it once to get a replacement, but even the second one is damaged, compared to the first one being completely ripped.

Each season's case are all scuffed up.

The discs are decent. Many smudges and scrapes on the discs, and one disc even has the outer part (where the ink is printed onto the top) chipping away.

I'm pretty disappointed and I'm sure I can return this and just get the series in a completely *different* manner online. Buying this product was a gamble.

I'm guessing this box wasn't really a collectors item, but just for the media alone.

You can be sure these have been tossed around a lot or are definitely not new. I think customers have been buying, ripping them to a hard drive, then returning them.

The re-watchability is only moderate, though.  Because there is a bunch of mystery in each one, if you have a good memory they are only ok the second time.  Still, I obviously thought it was worth it.",1415664000,2,373,4.183098591549296
5177928,1,B008P9M614,"This review is of the boxed set of House, M.D. the complete series.  **This is NOT a review of the story, but of the physical properties**

I've been waiting a long while for the entire series of ""House, M.D."" to come out on DVD, and at a mind-blowing price of roughly $69 for a boxed set, I was stoked.

Then it arrived. The product was advertised as being ""new,"" however, even before removing the plastic surrounding the box it was easy to see scuffing and near-tearing at all four corners on the front of the box (like what one would see for ""normal wear-and-tear). I took pics of that. That alone, set me to checking the discs (along with having read some of the reviews about missing discs). Season 1 disc 1 had finger prints on it! The disc has ""circular"" scratches (as if maybe someone tried using a CD cleaner on it?) and notable smudges on the playing side, as well as partial prints (not mine, because of how I handled the disc when removing it). The rest of the discs for season one looks ""used,"" with some scratching on some, smudges on others, dust, etc. One of the other seasons (I don't recall which one right now) also looks ""used,"" though it lacked fingerprints. Same things-- scratches and smudges and dust. Season one disc has weird, very notable scratching around the center hole-- as in ""looks like a rental purchase.""

My laptop disc player is having some problems reading discs, but I figured I'd give it a try. This is the umpteenth time of trying, and I haven't made it but 15 minutes into the show, and even then there was a lot of ""skipping,"" and ""can't read"" errors, and many times of it just ""hanging.""

I'm quite disappointed, because even at $69 I was expecting it to be ""as advertised,"" which was just simply NEW discs, complete seasons in a new, no-frills box. What I've received is a scuffed up box, scuffed, scratched, smudged & dusty discs and there's no way for me to tell any time soon whether any of these discs will be readable.

I like the idea of a no-frills, all in one box set (which gets a one star, but not the ""hate it""), but this falls far short of advertised product (this is where the ""hate it"" goes). If I were buying this ""used,"" I'd expect the description to be ""Used: decent/good condition; has some scratches and markings."" So for this to be advertised as ""new"" is unacceptable.

Summary: BUYER BEWARE! I would NOT recommend getting this boxed set from any seller on Amazon. Since my purchase was sold by Amazon LLC, and fulfilled by them, and I'm a ""Prime member,"" I expect way better than this. I have rarely had a problem with any Amazon purchases, and if I had a problem, the seller was quick to remedy the issue.

This is out of character for me, but this is how disappointed I am: ""Amazon, I'd like my money back. And I expect products described as ""new"" to be just that. Be truthful.""",1415404800,23,2846,4.438697318007663

I bought this complete set; it was delivered with the shrink wrap intact, and yet there were two discs missing, and a couple that wouldn't play correctly. I probably should simply have returned the set, but I thought surely the studio would make things right. Boy, was I wrong! Universal studios was no help at all. Where do companies learn such incompetent customer service? They'll have a tough time selling me anything, ever again. The first problem is tracking them down; they don't make it ease to even figure out who to call, in case of problems. The reason is simple enough: They don't want to hear from you, won't reply to requests, etc. It's Caveat emptor! in spades: You're on your own, Bub! My advice to anybody that purchases anything out of Universal Studios, is that if your item doesn't operate properly. Return it as soon as you discover the problem. If you delay, hoping Universal will help you, your return period will expire, and you'll just be stuck with your problem. Universal isn't interested in hearing from you.",1407715200,15,1106,4.7357512953367875

Anyway, I love watching his antics, but mostly how he go about finding solutions to his patients problems, hated he had the drug problem, but that only added to the real world situations that can even happen to so-called pillars of society. It also showed the different aspects of how coping mechanisms come into play from the character himself, his friends, co-workers, employer and even the patients.  But most of all, he was passionate about medicine and he cared, even though he tried to make them think the opposite.  Hey, don't take my word for it, get them and judge for yourself, I truly recommend you do, you might become a ""House Fan"" too.

It's a little difficult to follow because Dr. House proves to be a genius although his personality might be offensive to some.  However, as I'm getting into the episodes I am learning that he's a very complicated personality and I'm seeing more in his personality that makes it extremely enjoyable.  It's definitely not boring, but it might be difficult for someone with no medical knowledge at all.  It might also be scarry to some.",1398556800,,505,4.825581395348837

5177998,4,B008P9M614,"The Product: House M.D. is a show that I tried to stay consistent with and watch every week, however life gets in the way and you miss one to many important episodes and then it doesn't become a priority or worth trying to keep up with. Then we have the issue of expensive crappy DVD releases, personally, I hated the cardboard type cases that the first few of these seasons were originally released in, if the button that holds the DVD's in place breaks then you're completely screwed, and $25-40 for each individual set is way to much, but buying all the seasons at one great price (me and my mother got it for slightly over or under $100 with tax) on sale, which was great, especially since they were all in the right type of cases, no individual slim cases or cardboard case, perfect nice plastic ones as it ALWAYS should be in my opinion, not only this, but this comes with all the original special features, which is a HUGE plus!

The Show: So, now we come to the show itself... Obviously this show is excellent or I would not have considered getting all the seasons at once, I LOVE Hugh Laurie as House, NOBODY could EVER have played him better, someone you were able to love and hate at the same time yet still care for regardless of the poor choices he makes, the absolute rudeness and disrespect and disregard he has for most human beings in general. I also especially love Dr. James Wilson, House's only true friend.

The other doctor's House worked with throughout the show I mostly liked or loved too, there weren't any that I absolutely hated or anything. The romance aspect (mostly all that involved Dr. Cameron) were really against this show, I mean romance is expected in all shows at some point in some way but it just was to much at times, and the worst thing about this series was that it NEVER in my opinion got better after season 3 I think, whenever House started being a ""jerk"" in the truest sense, not his regular, just an outright jerk, the show took the deepest and worst downhill it could have taken, and that lasted a couple seasons, then it picked up slowly and got much, much better.

This show while having a truly awful gap between great episodes (or season) for a while is still an excellent show about doctors, patients, medicine, and just one of the greatest TV show characters that has ever been born! The episodes always depicted a patient with an interesting or unique problem and generally with that came an even greater interesting diagnosis, great and memorable characters that we care about and love (or hate) and episodes you can fully invest and engage in with great anticipation, surely a show about medicine and doctors has never and will never again exist.

I recommend this show to anyone that loves great TV shows that like with books, you can't wait to see what happens next!

5177999,5,B008P9M614,The show is great and all the discs play but i was disappointed with the delivery. Wasn't Amazon's fault but it came a week later because of the incompetence of USPS. I ordered it on Friday and since i have Prime and Amazon made a deal with USPS to deliver on Sunday it came with them. This was the first time i believe that they used them and it came a week late because the post man couldn't read and kept delivering to the wrong address even though it was written correctly. On the tracking it said i actually had to go to them to pick it up. I took a half day and when i went to pick it up they said it was out for delivery! I checked online and it wasn't updated and they never answered there phone when i called to make sure it was there. Luckily it was a package so they didn't just leave it at the other house. Around the same time this happened they did the same thing with my license and since it was in an envelope they left it there and i had to pay to get a duplicate! Not all Amazon's fault but just warning people that they use USPS now.,1393891200,,1052,3.9669811320754715

It is hard to believe (as of this writing) it has been a little over a year since the last episode aired. The series is a medical drama but different than ones like St. Elsewhere or ER. Most of it centers on House, a maverick, antisocial doctor with great diagnostic skills who works with a team of three or so. It has been mentioned a number of times during the series that House likes the puzzle more than the patient but I'm not sure he would go to the lengths he does for every patient if he weren't a truly dedicated doctor.

  I liked House's daily verbal assaults, flouting of hospital rules and general hijinks. House kind of reminds me of what Chef Ramsey would be like if he entered the medical profession. You might think initially that House is easy to analyze but if you watch the entire series, especially with the series finale, you'll see he is a difficult act to follow. I won't spoil anything but I enjoyed the series finale, especially the last five and a half minutes.

The box set has all 8 seasons on standard-def DVD for, at the time I bought it, the incredible price of about $80. The box itself is very sturdy, not some paper-thin affair, and the cases each season comes in are the same as if you were to buy them individually. The only thing that stinks for me is that each season is on DVD and not blu-ray. While watching the show on my 51"" plasma, for instance, I see trails behind moving characters; but while it bugs someone with a complex like me, it certainly isn't a deal breaker. The show was filmed in wide-screen though, so you won't have to suffer through the gray or black side bars of a show filmed in 4:3. If each season were on blu-ray, while you'd have crisp HD, that price tag would probably not sink as low as $80, but the package itself would be thinner because each season wouldn't have to be stretched across 6 DVD discs.

There are a few episodes that get a little too serious for me but they always seem to come back to the good old House that I like to watch.  If you like the show - the complete series is a no brainer.

5178091,5,B008P9M614,"I had previously owned two of the individual seasons of House and tried to watch it while it was on, but the date/time was never great for me.  I loved the show from the beginning; when I got married, it fell to my watching priority list because my husband had never really watched it and by that time it was season 7 and he wasn't going to pick it up so late in the game.

Fast forward 3 years.  While browsing one morning, I see that the complete series is the gold box deal.  The price was great and since I missed the last 2 1/2 seasons (but heard they were fabulous), I really wanted to pick it back up.

The packaging is ok.  All of the seasons are individually housed; together they are kept in a box.  A number of the little plastic bits that hold the DVDs in the packaging were broken, so some of them slide around a bit.  I actually  have to store mine sideways to reduce disc movement.  That doesn't bother me a lot.  It's more annoying than anything.

The series itself is fantastic.  I started over at season one and found that I enjoy the episodes just as much as I did the first time I saw them.  Some I remember, some I don't.  Some I think I missed altogether the first time around.  My husband started watching it with me and he's hooked.  He is impressed with the attention to detail and character.  The plot lines are always interesting.  While each episode (at least the first few seasons) could, in theory, be watched individually, the writers do a good job of keeping short sub-plots woven throughout the series.  Most of them only last 5-6 episodes so they don't get tedious.",1370217600,,1599,4.31986531986532

5178095,5,B008P9M614,"Fair warning, this will contain spoilers from throughout the series.  If you have not seen it yet, read at your own risk...

House was witty, acerbic, arrogant, and could get away with saying or doing anything (at least in the early seasons) because he was the best at what he did.  It is how we all wish we could be at work from one time to another. Hugh Laurie played him perfectly.  The balance between the gruff Vicodin addicted doctor who did not care, balanced with the friend and co-worker who really did care deep down.  The diagnosis of the week aspect of the show did get repetitive, even in the first season.  It was basically trying to diagnose a mystery disease, being wrong most of the show, and then House dramatically diagnosing the case at the end of the show.  The real meat of what kept the show on the air for 8 years however, was the character interactions.  The patient cases were, for the most part, just a backdrop.

The show kind of fell into the trap of what a lot of ensemble cast series do.  As series regulars leave (or have a reduced role) others step in.  At the end of the third season House lost his original team, and basically had a competition throughout season 4 to replace them (which lead to Kal Penn, Olivia Wilde and Peter Jacobson becoming series regulars).  Of the original group Jennifer Morrison was the only one to truly leave the series and the other two shifted roles throughout the rest of the show, with Jesse Spencer's character (Chase) eventually taking over for House in the last episode.

The only story (that was not one of the diagnosis related stories) I did not like is how the show handled Cuddy's exit.  Lisa Edelstein decided to leave the show after season 7.  I think it would have been far more effective to have followed through killing her character off as opposed to her just leaving the hospital because of what House does at the end of that season.  Just having Cuddy up and leave went against everything that the character had done up to that point in her interactions with House.  I think it would have been more effective to have killed off her character, then developed a story where House had to deal with that loss, then done something to end up in jail (that actually made sense).

By the 8th season I do think the show had become somewhat stale.  I think having Foreman take over Cuddy's job really underutilized his character, and there were a lot of episodes that season where Omar Epps was only in the show for a couple minutes.  I think the character was always better as a part of House's team, than when they had him as the boss.  I think that the addition of Odette Annable (Odette Yustman for you Cloverfield fans who are in denial about her being married) and Charlene Yi, were good. Even though Olivia Wilde left the show that season (aside from appearances in the early on in the season and the last episode), the fact that Chase and Taub were still around gave it a sense of continuity.  I also really liked Wilson's cancer storyline.  It provided some really good moments without just killing him off in the final episode.  It was also nice how they brought in many of the characters from the past in for the series finale.  I would have liked to see Cameos of Chi McBride's character from season 1 and the Officer from season 3 in the final episode as one of the hallucinations.  But the fact that they got as many people back for the episode as they did was able to give the show a sense of closure.  Having House and Wilson ride off into the sunset at the end was the perfect way for the show to go out.

I have the individual seasons (the first 5 on DVD and the last 3 on Blu Ray), not this actual box set.  I know in the season sets, each one has some behind the scenes material and features.  Nothing too extensive on any of them, but good for what they are.  I do not know if those have been included in this set or if there is anything added to this one not in the individual sets.  I do think that Universal should put the entire series out in Blu Ray, but if that is not important to you, then I think this is worth getting.  However you get the shows, it is one of the better series that has been on TV the last few years, and is definitely worth the purchase.",1369958400,27,4260,4.345132743362832

And the 'tough love' approach of Dr. House is a nice slap of reality for those of us hoping for immediate good news. Morale: True news is best, and cures don't come easy.

The only downside is that, aside from different topics, the formats are too the same, the process' differ, but the presentation is consistent, predictible. At least as far as I have viewed - it's a long set, all interesting - I'm not going to rush through them (maybe Amazon could wait a bit before asking for a review...?)

The graphics and depictions of very realistic treatments may fascinate or make potential patients queasy. Whatever, they're true (I think) and a needed slap of reality. The CGI graphics for the internal processes are stunning and motivated me to really think what doctors have to face; we humanoids are real complex critters.

5178141,5,B008P9M614,"Let's face it, most of us, when buying an entire series, want it to be of high quality, reasonably priced, complete with all episodes and a minimum amount of extraneous ""additional"" features, i.e. pamphlets, photos and other stuff that may raise the cost of the purchase and which most of us don't want and won't read anyway. I mean, after all is said and done we just want to watch the programs.

I have throughly enjoyed this set. The discs were all there when I opened the set (you'd be surprized how often a disc is missing or duplicated leaving the set incomplete) and there was a very brief synopsis of each episode within the DVD case.

The subtitles were in English and Spanish and were ""almost"" verbatim to the dialog unlike some subtitles that I have experienced where the subtitle replaces whole phrases and words and really has nothing to do with what the actor had just said.

Disc one of each Season also included ""Special Features"" for which I can't tell you what the features covered as I don't watch them. Just wanted to mention that they exist.

Although there was a small pamphlet contained in the set it was not too burdensome to the reader. One part, ""House-isms,"" was very funny and I had heard them used, some of them many, many times, throughout the series. The main characters (House, Cuddy & Wilson) comment on their characters character and how they interact with each other. There is also a Season & Episode guide to help you find a special episode without having to open and search each DVD case. There is a section that addresses the ideas of how House was developed as well as how the characters were developed. There are also some quotes, from the famous and not-so-famous. The average time to read the pamphlet is about 20-30 minutes if you stop to think and consider what you've just read :-)

Bottom line: House, The Complete Series is well put together and worth the cost. I have recommended this set to several of my friends and family who like this series as much as I do. BUT, I had an ulterior motive for recommending this set so strongly, I don't want to lend my set to ANYONE no matter if they were friend and/or family. To lend this set is just setting me up to have arguments due to a disc being returned with a scratch/scratches, being returned with one or more discs missing or other damage that can happen. So....rather than go through stressful arguments I ALWAYS recommend and  NEVER loan.

Even though they follow a set story development line, you are still guessing with them what's wrong with the patient. Watching the character House come up with the solution is always fun. Hugh Laurie is a brilliant actor. His characterization of Gregory House has been created down to the use of his clear, blue eyes to express what is going on. The writers gave us what we wanted in his relationship with Cuddy, yet didn't forget about the other people on the ""team"". Making House the disgruntled doctor and saying what he's actually thinking, vs being tactful is what started us to watch this series.  Now that we have the entire series on DVD, the story lines that continue are exciting and interesting. I can't watch just one episode at a time. I do laugh at some of their surgery techniques. Taking out an appendix from the left side of the body or removing a spleen from the right side of the body is not proper.
