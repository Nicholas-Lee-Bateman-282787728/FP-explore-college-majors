8561678,4,B00B2TUS6E,"An interesting documentary.  Not for the faint of heart, it is very graphic.  Shows a side of life that most of us don't relate to.  Felt a lot of sympathy for the women who live this lifestyle.",1453248000,,194,4.1891891891891895
8561679,5,B00B2TUS6E,"A truly charming & bittersweet look at the world's oldest profession.
Martine and Louise charmed me and reminded me of days in Amsterdam.
A must-see for anyone with fond memories of A'dam.",1389052800,,188,4.90625
8561680,5,B00B2TUS6E,My Dutch friend and I loved this movie. It is a look in to the lives of two sisters who are doing it for themselves.,1376956800,,116,3.68
8561681,3,B00B2TUS6E,"A window into the lives of aging identical twin prostitutes, Louise and Martine Fokkens, and their 50-some years in Amsterdam's red light district. The women are a little kooky, but very likable, and the sex business has never been less arousing (which is a good thing here). There are some explicit scenes, but they mostly elicit giggles. The girls share stories about their private lives but nothing ever goes too deep. I don't know what I expected, but I mostly enjoyed it because there aren't many documentaries out there about this subject matter.",1370649600,3,552,4.946236559139785
8561682,5,B00B2TUS6E,"I didn't know what to expect based on the name and jacket cover.  What a pleasant surprise it turned out to be. Imagine a story of two old prostitutes (one still practicing her art until March 2013) being poignant, but it really was. These two sisters deserve their retirement and a happy one at that.  I highly recommend this film (for adults only of course.)",1367280000,2,360,4.523076923076923
8561683,5,B00B2TUS6E,"I loved this movie. These two ladies are so sweet and spunky.  Watch it, you'll love it. Not a sob story and they are both amazing painters as well",1366243200,2,147,4.068965517241379
8561684,5,B00B2TUS6E,I was in Amsterdam last June... I would have looked for these two.  I loved the film....  I want to chat with them and would buy the art..,1365292800,3,138,3.892857142857143
