8281785,2,B001B3LIT2,"Tanny Tien Ni and Chen Chi Lin are the best things by far in this movie.  They are beautiful and they occasionally get to kick some butt or throw snakes at enemies.  The movie itself is disjointed and the kung fu is really not up to the standard set by other Shaw Brothers productions of the period.  The cheesy FX are great but the silly premise and the script just drag this one down into the 2 star bucket for me.

I got this DVD as part of the Shaw Brothers Collection box set that also includes The Heroic Ones, The Duel of the Century, and Two Champions of Shaolin.  All of those are better movies and the set is a bargain at just over $20.

As usual the Celestial remaster is very nice.  The English audio and the English subtitles don't always match up which is interesting in a few instances.",1366416000,,801,4.230263157894737
8281786,3,B001B3LIT2,"One woman uses snakes and a venomous frog as her weapons, another uses what looks like a femur bone.. but not as a blunt object.. it shoots small red arrows.  Lots of dismembered limbs.. mostly from laser beams that come out of people's hands.  A bit of decent kung fu, but mostly rampant absurdity.  Highlights include a fight with a man in a gorrilla suit, Tuan Yu gaining super-human ability through biting and drinking the blood of a large rubber python and the fact that the film is hardly longer than an hour.

I'd also give this 3 and a half stars, so this works out.

If you don't have the other films in the set, buy the first shaw brothers collection instead of purchasing this individually.  That is, if you don't mind slim cases.  It includes the remastered version of this film (identical to the one being sold here individually) as well as The Heroic Ones, The Duel Of The Century and Two Champions Of Shaolin.

8281787,5,B001B3LIT2,"I have been waiting for this movie to be released for quite  some time now (years). I remember seeing a poster or lobby card of a white haired master spewing fire from from his mouth. Needless to say that's pretty much all I needed to sell me on this film. So finally it's here and it does not disappoint. Well, it would probably would disappoint martial arts purist nerds that want their movies to be ""real"". I however love to find wildest and weirdest movies possible. The picture and sound quality are really amazing. I won't go into a extensive plot review, but the movie is essentially a fairy tale. There isn't necessarily a lot of martial arts but there is plenty of super powered magic. The fact this movie is Shaw Bros. just makes it all the better! Ok, so here's a few things that make this movie great...fire breathing bird leg extending wizard, extensive animated ""ch'i"" laser blasts from hands and fingers, giant red snake whose blood gives you super strength, berserk gorilla with arm chopped off, horny bald ogre with chain extending claw hand, pit of death, glowing attack frog, dagger shooting bone, snakes inside a man, technicolor melting face, and more! It all must be seen to be believed. If you are a fan of bizarre cinema give this one a try it really is a lot of fun. This movie is also sold in a four movie box set which is also worth looking into.",1240704000,7,1373,4.492
