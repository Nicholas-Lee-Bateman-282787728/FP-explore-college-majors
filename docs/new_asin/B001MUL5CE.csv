8321868,4,B001MUL5CE,"Although this is a fairly new movie, the special effects are not nearly as believable as in some of the big-budget fantasy movies.  A 'Lord of the Rings' this is not.  But then, the movie isn't designed for adults; it is very much a children's movie.  It is the kind of movie that parents can enjoy watching with their pre-teen children.  The brother and sister in the story are real-life brother and sister, and also children of the director.  But, they do a pretty good job of acting; not really polished, but your children will certainly find them believable.

It is a cute fantasy story involving trolls, fairies, and an evil witch.  I don't believe there is anything in the story that would be too frightening for school-age children.  There are two swear words we heard, however; one by the evil witch and, amazingly, by the young boy.  So, the movie has a U.K. PG rating.  This movie should be safe for traditional values families' children see.  It would be great to see it in Region 1 format so more Americans and Canadians could watch it.",1233878400,2,1048,4.580645161290323
