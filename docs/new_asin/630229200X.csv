454167,5,630229200X,"There are two episodes on this video:
""Unidentified Flying Leonardo""
""The Foot Soldiers Are Revolting""
In the first episode, we soon learn that April is off to a small country town to investigate some UFO sightings in the area.  Leonardo, ever the resourceful leader of our Favorite Foursome, decides he will keep on eye on her just in case there's trouble.  Little does he know that all the trouble lying ahead will be for him!
First a farmer he befriends, Billy Jim Bob McJames, thinks he's an alien.  Then he gets buzzed by a UFO.  Then he gets tossed around by giant beanstalks.  And to make matters worse, a lot of townfolk are after him to try and catch him!
Eventually, all this running around leads Leonardo to a crazy scientist who has captured a very snoopy April.  He plans on using his super ray gun to enlarge his vegetables and run all the other farmers of the world out of business.  Can Leonardo stop this crazy man from making vegetables so big that little kids will be forced to eat them?
In the second episode, Shredder and Krang experience a malfunction with some of the Technodrome's equipment, and when the smoke clears, a super version of a Foot Soldier stands in its wake.  This Foot Soldier is no pushover; he exiles Bebop and Rocksteady from the Technodrome and then he sends Shredder and Krang on an endless joyride through Dimension X.  It looks like it's up to our Fabulous Foursome to save the day!
The super Foot Soldier plans on beaming everyone on the planet to Dimension X via his, what else, super ray transporter gizmo.  This would lead to only he and his fellow Foot Soldier minions ruling the planet.
Can the Turtles, with the surprising help from Bebop and Rocksteady, outwit this brainy robot?  Or will everyone be calling Dimension X their new home?  To find out, you're gonna have to buy the video, dudes.",1006819200,2,1847,4.597560975609756
454168,5,630229200X,"There are two episodes on this video:
""The Turtles and the Hare""
""Once Upon a Time Machine""
In the first episode, we learn that Shredder and Krang are up to their all too familiar shenanigans - this time, in the spirt of Easter, they dress up Bebop and Rocksteady in bunny suits and send them to earth with a ray to zap everyone into timid little creatures.  Just like terrified rabbits!
Meanwhile, Donatello is busy showing the Turtles his latest invention - an automatic Easter egg-making machine.  Of course, anyone who has watched the Ninja Turtles for any amount of time knows what eventually happens - Donatello's invention eventually goes haywire, and his latest failure leaves egg on his face.  Literally!
When the Turtles learn of the nefarious scheme that Shredder and Krang have orchestrated, they quickly discover that the only way to reverse the effects of the ray is to travel to the Fairy Tale Dimension and nab some shiny red stone.  Along the way, they meet the Three Little Pigs, the Big Bad Wolf, the characters from Jack and the Beanstalk . . . and also one other character named Hokum Hare.
Together, Hokum and the Turtles set out to reverse what has happened on Earth.  Do they succeed?  Um, I can't remember - my memory seems to have eluded me.  Guess you'll just have to buy the video to find out!
The second episode is definitely one of the more funny episodes in the history of the series.  This time Shredder and Krang have hatched a plot to rule the future!  Hokum Hare returns in this episode, and eventually all characters (Shredder and his cronies; the Turtles and Hokum) end up in the future.
What makes the episode a treat is watching the old Ninja Turtles.  Michaelangelo and is fat and out of shape; Donatello is blind as a bat; Raphael's legs are shot; and Leonardo has memory problems.  This makes for some hilarious scenes in the episode that have made this reviewer crack up every time.
Can the old Turtles save the future?  Can the young Turtles save the future?  Once again, my memory escapes me - in other words, buy the video!  You won't regret it!!",1003449600,7,2092,4.60377358490566
454169,5,630229200X,"Even though the Teenage Mutant Ninga Turtle era ended years ago there is still a part of me that loves those 4 green guys!  This movie is one of the best, if you like Leonardo, like I do, you'll love this movie!  Not only does it focus on the turtles as they battle another evil, but this time it takes place in outer space, which adds a whole other element to a great movie.  The fact that the movie deals with alien and UFO things makes it even more exciting and suspenseful(well, as suspenseful as a ninga turtle movie can get!) If your a TMNT fan you won't be sorry with this classic Leonardo video!",996105600,,603,4.226086956521739

454171,5,630229200X,"This video features 2 episodes from the 1991 season called ""The Turtles and The Hare"" and ""Once Upon A Time Machine"". I think this video is really good because it brings back memories of a great  cartoon and lets me see episodes never shown in the UK before.
In the  first episode Shredder tries to make a ray that makes everyone really timid  - as bunnies, in fact. Our heroes tavel to the Fairy Tale dimension and  meet a rabbit called Hokum who helps them stop Shredder. In the next  episode, Shredder has a scheme to change the future! He thinks he`ll be  able to conquer the universe if the Turtles aren`t around. But, in true  cartoon style, something goes wrong...
I would reccomend this tape to  anyone who is a fan of the cartoon show or just ""TMNT"" in  general. This is a great cartoon.",954115200,5,796,4.397260273972603

7824562,5,630229200X,"Each new season of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise brought better and better episodes.  Unfortunately, the AMOUNT of episodes was rather shortened.  In 1991, there were 20 episodes; in 1992, there were 16 episodes; and in 1993, there were 14 episodes.

These 2 particular episodes I happen to like watching over and over again.  In Episode #166, ""Atlantis Awakes"", the Turtles come across a ""merman"", Alim.  He can't seem to find his way back home to Atlantis, so the T.M.N.T. offer to help him out.  Along the way, Shredder and Krang find Atlantis as well.  Shredder, Bebop and Rocksteady go out in their amphibious module and find more than they bargained for.  The Atlanteans seem to think that Bebop is their king, so he goes along with it and overacts the part.  He even tries to overthrow Shredder, but the caped archvillain gets the upper hand.

So with Bebop's help, Shredder gets ahold of the ""Star of Atlantis"", which Krang intends to use as his new focusing heat ray.  Now it's up to Alim and the T.M.N.T. to convince the population that Bebop is NOT their true king, and that Alim actually IS!!  The only way to do that is to challenge Bebop in a gladiator-type battle!  Bebop loses out in the end and asks Shredder for his old job back.  Once Shredder and the gang leave Atlantis a little ""parting gift"", they return to the Technodrome so that Krang can install the crystal.

But the T.M.N.T. quickly follow suit and manage to stop him from destroying Atlantis with the Technodrome's eye.  But Shredder isn't quite done chasing the Turtles just yet -- he drives the Technodrome towards Atlantis itself, wanting to lay it to waste!  After the T.M.N.T. steal back the ""Star of Atlantis"", they use it to fire some good rounds at the Technodrome, forcing it to quickly retreat!

In Episode #170, ""Shredder Triumphant"", Shredder distracts the T.M.N.T. by pretending to rob an art museum.  After the Turtles make short work of him and his two minions, they soon realize that it was just a ruse.  During the robbery, Krang and his Foot Soldiers went to a space station to steal a powerful fuel cell, which he can now use to re-energize his Technodrome!  So the T.M.N.T. was unsuccessful in stopping Krang this time, and further insult is added to injury when the Technodrome finally gets out from its watery grave and heads towards NYC, crushing everything in its path!

Krang then summons General Traag and the Rock Soldiers to take over NYC.  When the T.M.N.T. break into the Technodrome and try to remove the power cell, Shredder manages to capture them and send the Turtles straight to Dimension X!  So now they are helpless to stop Shredder and now have to contend with another archvillain, Vorx.  Not to worry, though, the T.M.N.T. will eventually gain an ally, Weasel, who helps them stop the reckless beast and his slave drivers.

Meanwhile, Channel 6 is taken hostage by Shredder, Krang, Bebop and Rocksteady.  The only person who can rescue April, Irma and Vernon is Master Splinter himself!  After he stops the two crones, Splinter, April and Irma head out to find Krang and his Technodrome.  In Dimension X, after Vorx and his slave drivers are captured by the T.M.N.T., they manage to talk Shredder into battling with them.  But the only way to do that is by letting them out of Dimension X!  The Turtles succeed, and the battle quickly takes place.  Meanwhile, Krang gets stopped by Splinter, April and Irma.

The entire gang and the T.M.N.T. use all resources necessary to get the Rock Soldiers back inside of the Technodrome.  Once they are captured, Donatello sends the Technodrome right back into Dimension X (for the third time, if you've been paying attention to Episodes #5 and #65, respectively) -- but WITHOUT Shredder and Krang!!  So now they are forced to retreat to a brand new hideaway called the Hall of Science, which will reveal itself in the 1994 season of T.M.N.T.

Whew -- lots of great episodes to be had in the final 3 seasons of the franchise!  If you are a hardcore fan, you don't want to miss out!!  :)",1394064000,,4057,4.7102272727272725
7824563,1,630229200X,"Just confirming what the reviewer below stated. When I was a kid, I saw the TMNT miniseries in December of '87 and loved it. When it came out on video a few years later, I begged my parents to rent it and even on the first viewing, I realized that a lot of footage was missing (particularly the scenes where the Channel 6 building floods, and the scene where the Turtles fight Bebop and Rocksteady at the zoo). The full miniseries (uncut) gets five stars from me, but the heavy editing of this release is unnecessary since huge plot elements were cut.",1123372800,,551,4.411764705882353
7824564,5,630229200X,"To tell you the truth, I'm a little suprised to see that there aren't any reviews for this tape. ""Bye, Bye Fly"" (one of the two episodes from Season 3 included on this tape) is not only one of my favorite TMNT episodes, but it's also probably one of the most surreal things you'll ever see on television.

""Bye, Bye Fly"" - You get to see four mutated turtles battling a giant, human-sized fly...do you really need a plot? Anyway, the show starts off with a group of archaeologists on the news, talking to April about a temple they have just found (which is coincidentally located near the Turtle's home). The Turtles are rightfully worried about their home being discovered, but never fear, as Baxter Stockman (ironic that he's a giant fly that has the word 'man' in his name, isn't it?) comes out and scares the archaeologists. Baxter decides to search the temple, which turns out to be a talking spaceship that seems to want to help him (when you're a talking spaceship located in the sewars, I guess it's kind of hard to make new friends). Baxter learns that this is no ordinary talking spaceship, this is a spaceship that is able to travel through different dimensions and also has a magical gun on board that will turn people into animals, insects, etc.

Eventually, the Turtles, Shredder, and Rocksteady & Bebop are lured to the spaceship. This is where a few memorable moments occur, as Baxter turns Shredder into a miniature fly (complete with tiny helmet), and turns Michaelangelo into a small ""Teenage Mutant Gerbil"" (quite an adorable sight, as the little gerbil has a little orange headband as well).

Everything goes right in the end though, since the Turtles recover the gun and turn Mikey back to normal. Baxter attempts to leave to Dimension X, causing everyone to flee (while Rocksteady and Bepop leave with the gun). Shredder begs to be turned back to normal, but R&B decide to make him stay like that for awhile. Meanwhile, Baxter's trip to Dimension X fails as the spaceship completely falls apart and Baxter is thrown into some other weird dimension where he eventually lands on a giant spider-web.

Comments: You know, I actually feel a little bad for Baxter. The guy started out as a dorky inventor, but with his bad luck, the only person who would buy his products was Shredder. He's not really evil or anything, but he seems to suffer the worst fate. He used to be a dorky inventor with weird hair and a Richard Simmons voice, now he's a huge giant fly with weird hair and a Richard Simmons voice. Then in this episode, he just wants a little revenge (if you were turned into a giant fly, I know you'd want revenge too), but things turn out even worse.

The other episode included on this tape is ""Shredderville"", which is highly entertaining, yet so predictable that even six year olds will be able to figure out the ending within the first five minutes. So overall, you get one amazing episode and an average one. Not bad for a tape that you can probably get for under 5 bucks.",1098144000,5,3004,4.607476635514018
