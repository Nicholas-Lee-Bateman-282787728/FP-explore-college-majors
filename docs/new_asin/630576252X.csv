Save your money, but if you want it in your Jennifer Beals collection like I did then buy it.",1506470400,,245,3.823529411764706

7896181,3,630576252X,"Jennifer Beals did not have enough sound speaking parts in this movie.  I do not like movies that have young Black American women playing roles as a prostitute or hooker.  She could have had a role playing an intelligent woman who was interested in a man who wanted to be a boxer or to do better in his life.  Jennifer was supportive to the main character.

The outcome of the movie was predictable.",1385683200,,399,4.424657534246576
7896182,1,630576252X,"I purchased this item for two reasons; I like Ray Mancini; and the original with John Garfield, and the Bowery Boys, was top notch(and the only version worth seeing). I was hoping that this version would capture some of the magic of the original. It didn't. It was so bad, that I'm going to give it away-rather than try to sell it to some other unsuspecting soul. Carboard characters, cheap sets, and an awful acting job by Mancini. Next time I want to see him, I'll throw in an old VHS of one of his fights. Don't waste your money on this one.",1276300800,,544,4.29126213592233
7896183,3,630576252X,"I found this film too be pretty good overall. Most of the actors are names we know, and those that are not turn out too be pretty fair. The story makes sence and the chariters are interesting. Worth watching on a day with nothing to do.",1264809600,,236,4.1521739130434785

Perhaps I will buy others movies soon.",1184284800,,137,3.9285714285714284
7896186,5,630576252X,"I loved the movie. Jennifer Beals has played several different roles in the movies she has been in and every preformance has been excellent. She puts 100% into everything she does. The movie was worth watching again. My husband even watched it. There were several other actors I remembered from other shows. As I understand, Ray Mancini was a real boxer at one time. All in all it was a great movie.",1126569600,,399,4.555555555555555
7896187,3,630576252X,"I laughed reading that last review, I also had small parts. I'm the red-haired female reporter during press conference where fight breaks out... Joe Montagna gets cold cocked and takes out a row of reporters! You guessed it. No they DIDN'T mention that part when they cast me and the ""hazard pay"" never arrived. But how many can say Joe Montagna fell on them? I also helped choreograph some fight scenes. BOOM-BOOM Mancini and ""Papa BOOM"" (his real father, former world champion boxer) are the funniest, sweetest people ever. This film is meant to serious, but it's just fun entertainment!",1093824000,,589,4.9
