8017885,2,B0001XIZK8,"I was disappointed in this DVD.  It was not quite the story line that I expected.  I did not use it for my CCD students and most likely will not do so at all.  It is not that the story is objectionable it is that the story is slow moving, drawn out, and boring.",1372550400,,261,3.7962962962962963
8017886,5,B0001XIZK8,"We received the tape and it was in great condition I really appreciate that,we've gotten others that had like staples in the actually tape...
The message in this tape is so needed in our churches,to remind us that we are to serve NOT be served. There are whole generations of children growing up feeling like they are owed something. When in truth the only thing they are ""owed"" is hell. Its only through the blood of Jesus can our sins be forgiven. Its only through His sacrifice and repentance and faith in Him can we be saved! There is only One Way,and it is through Jesus Christ the Son of God and get God,fully God and fully man,who was born of a virgin,lived a sinless perfect life and was obedient to the will of the Father,even to His death on Calvary's cross. But death could not hold Him and on the third day He arose victorious and sits at the right hand of the Father in heaven. It is only through Him can there be a true change and a true understanding of service and truly loving others. Buy this movie,you will be blessed by it as in was and am!",1365724800,2,1060,4.278606965174129
8017887,5,B0001XIZK8,"The products from Nest Family entertainment are the best I have found. The stories are mostly accurate and the animation is very good. I have looked everywhere for accurate Bible stories for children and all but these take ""artistic license"" and significantly modify what is explicitly stated. I have no problem with adding context, but there simply isn't any justification for modifying what is written. Furthermore, some products use rock and roll music, which I detest, but the music is the Nest products is wholesome.",1190592000,3,521,5.141176470588236
