In this video Bruce Webber is apparently speaking at a coaches conference somewhere out of his home state.  It gives the impression he jotted down a few notes on a yellow legal pad on the flight over and he is holding onto these notes throughout the video.

The kids he uses to demonstrate his talk have obviously not been prepped at all and are not at all familiar with him or his system.  I'm guessing they were local college bench players probably offered a few dollars to stand in for the coaches seminar.

The result is a lot of confusion when given directions.  Eventually the kids do what kids always do when bored and start just playing ball.

If you can wade through that, you can pick up the basics of a motion zone offense, but you will not be an expert by any means.

If you have no clue how to run an offense against the zone there are better books, and Lord knows this video could have been better.

However, you will pick up the basics, and only the basics of running a zone motion offense.",1149033600,,1120,4.29047619047619
