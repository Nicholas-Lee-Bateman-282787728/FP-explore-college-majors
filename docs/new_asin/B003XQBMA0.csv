8462000,1,B003XQBMA0,"This drama sucked. English subtitles were bad...very bad. Too much pandering for sympathy. Plot situations were too convenient and often illogically written which would make you laugh at the ""lack of sophistication"" in the writing scheme. Background music was at best ""a cliche"". And often the background was ""photoshoped"" to add things like ""stars"" for the night sky ...and ""dolphins"" for the ocean.

D Movie. You will do better watching something else.",1311984000,,454,5.305555555555555
